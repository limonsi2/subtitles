The expedition to recover

551
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:54,854
subject N's body from the
glacier was a success.

552
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:57,857
But the human trials have
proved devastating.

553
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,946
The foreign blood acts
like a parasite,

554
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:01,948
and attacks the human DNA.

555
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:04,167
A theory has arisen among
some of the scientists

556
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:06,866
that this specimen is
the biblical species

557
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:08,607
from the book of Enoch.

558
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,827
And if so, maybe we should have
left it in the ice. Maybe -

559
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:17,093
Let me sum it up for you.

560
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:20,967
Man plays God, and ends up
creating the fucking Devil.

561
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,272
Do you remember
in Sunday school

562
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:23,317

us about fallen angels

563
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,884
and Noah's ark?

564
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:27,190
I think I missed that day.

565
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:29,845
The fallen angels raped
the daughters of men,

566
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:33,371
and they created this species of
monster, called the Nephilim,

567
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:35,982
that would wage war on mankind.

568
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:38,027
Mankind had lost the battle,
and they were on the verge

569
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:42,249
of extinction when
Noah built the Ark.

570
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:44,817
