3
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,322
Look. It's snow.

4
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,406
Yes.

5
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,830
Here I come!

6
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,388
Heads up!

7
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,726
- We give up! We give up!
- Yeah!

8
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,838
Linus, watch out.

9
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,964
What? What is it?

10
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,759
- I just fluffed that pillow.
- What's gotten into you?

11
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,512
- The holiday spirit.
- Already?

12
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,514
It's the first weekend of December,

13
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:41,560
and that means Christmas and Grandma
will be here soon.

14
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,354
Well, I'm excited about
the Christmas part.

15
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,647
Linus.

16
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,232
I like seeing Grandma too,

17
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:50,110
but she's always trying to
get me to give up my blanket.

18
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,029
Enjoy that blanket while you can,

19
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,948
because you know what happens
when Grandma gets here.

20
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,284
Not if she can't find it.

21
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:09,253
- What are you watching, big brother?
- <i>Citizen Kane</i>. It's a famous old movie.

22
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,465
Why are you watching that?
It looks boring.

23
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,926
If you must know, it's almost Christmas

24
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,553
and that means New Year's
is right around the corner.

25
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:20,766
And I haven't completed any of
my New Year's resolutions from last year.

26
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,685
One of them was
"view a great work of art."

27
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,562
So I'm watching this.

28
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,731
"Rosebud"? What's "rosebud"?

29
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,234
I don't know, Sally. I'll tell you later.

30
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,154
Aren't you going to get that?

31
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,201
Andy, Olaf.

32
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,911
You're the first ones to arrive.

33
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,122
Snoopy's very excited to
have you all here for the holidays.

34
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,209
He's waiting for you in the back… yard.

35
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,385
Make yourselves at home.

36
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,141
- It's for you.
- How do you know it's not for you?

37
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,393
I'm indisposed.

38
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,772
Marbles. Long time no see.

39
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,573
Belle. Happy holidays.

40
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,283
Snoopy! It's your sister!

41
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,967
Spike. You're looking… good.

42
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,638
You're the last one to arrive.

43
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,850
I'll bet you're excited
for your family reunion to begin.

44
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,981
They're all in the back.

45
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,820
"Rosebud" was the sled.

46
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,826
So much for that resolution.

47
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,134
Five cents, please.

48
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,431
It's been a good year.

49
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,059
What seems to be the problem,
Charlie Brown?

50
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:30,812
Last year I made this list
of New Year's resolutions,

51
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,815
and I haven't accomplished a single one.

52
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,192
I feel like a failure.

53
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,487
It's more than a feeling, Charlie Brown.
Let me see that.

54
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:43,450
Here's your problem. These resolutions
are completely unrealistic.

55
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,870
You need to adjust your expectations
to match your abilities.

56
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,331
- What do you mean?
- Resolution number three,

57
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,084
"build the world's tallest snowman."

58
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,587
How about just "build a snowman"?

59
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,423
Or number nine, "paint a masterpiece."

60
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,261
Maybe just settle for
"do something remotely creative."
Maybe just settle for
"do something remotely creative."

61
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,763
That doesn't seem very ambitious.

62
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:08,725
Exactly. All you need to do
is complete one realistic resolution

63
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,519
and you're covered for the year.

64
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:17,526
One realistic resolution? Why not?
Anyone can do that, even me.

65
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,946
Sensible mediocrity. That's the spirit.

66
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,907
Now, what type of gingerbread house
will Grandma like?

67
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,286
Traditional or something postmodern?

68
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,040
<i>Grandma's coming to my house</i>

69
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,626
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la</i>

70
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,878
<i>Grandma's coming to my house</i>

71
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,756
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la</i>
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la</i>

72
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,175
<i>Party gifts and hugs for me</i>

73
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,928
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la</i>

74
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:12,808
<i>Cookie here, a cookie there
Cookies all the way</i>

75
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:17,771
<i>Oh, what fun it is to laugh
When Grandma comes to stay, hey</i>

76
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,732
<i>Oh, Grandma</i>

77
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:26,113
<i>Brings comfort and joy</i>

78
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,700
Linus, what are you doing?
I just made this room perfect.

79
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:34,037
A boy's gotta do what he's gotta do to
hide his blanket before Grandma visits.

80
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,958
Well, that's the first place she'll look.
No one outsmarts Grandma.

81
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,547
Hello, van Pelt's residence.
Happy Christmas Eve.

82
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,633
Grandma! I can't wait to see you today.

83
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,760
The decorations are up
and everything is ready.

84
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,557
What? What do you mean
you're not coming?

85
00:07:54,558 --> 00:08:00,022
But we were going to bake cookies
and play games and go caroling.
But we were going to bake cookies
and play games and go caroling.

86
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,192
But I've been planning all month.

87
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,652
I thought we were going to--

88
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:10,574
Oh, no. It's fine. I'm-- I'm fine.

89
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:16,079
Merry-- Merry Christmas, Grandma.

90
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,272
Lucy! Wake up! It's Christmas!

91
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,565
For you.

92
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,275
Happy holidays!

93
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,864
<i>Six geese a laying
Five golden rings</i>

94
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,202
<i>Maybe Grandma didn't want to come.</i>

95
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,746
<i>Didn't she wanna see me?</i>

96
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,249
<i>Was it because of me?</i>
<i>Was it because of me?</i>

97
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,670
<i>She does love me, doesn't she?</i>

98
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,304
Am I not lovable?

99
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,393
If my own grandma doesn't wanna see me…

100
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,773
how do I know
anyone really loves me?

101
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:43,292
Lucy, you gotta pull yourself together.

102
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:47,212
You have friends. Lots of them. Yeah.

103
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:51,508
That's right.
You are Lucy "Lovable" van Pelt.

104
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,012
And I know just how to prove it.

105
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:02,102
Linus. Wake up. Christmas was a letdown,
but New Year's is going to be perfect.
Linus. Wake up. Christmas was a letdown,
but New Year's is going to be perfect.

106
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,479
I'm going to throw a party!

107
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,566
Linus! Did you hear me?

108
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:11,028
Throw a party. Sounds like fun.

109
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,654
And you're going to help.

110
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,865
Do you promise?

111
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,868
- I promise. Just let me sleep.
- Deal.

112
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,621
It's not going to be just
any old New Year's Eve party.

113
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,123
It's going to be an elegant affair.

114
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:29,129
I'm calling it "Lucy's Gala: A New Year's
Eve Celebration of Elegant Perfection."

115
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,881
That's a mouthful.

116
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,966
I know. Impressive, isn't it?

117
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,969
And everyone's going to be there
to celebrate me.

118
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,722
I mean with me. You know why?

119
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:43,727
Because I am lovable!
There's so much we need to do.

120
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,357
Rise and shine!
That's enough sleep for one day.

121
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,360
What did I just get myself into?

122
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:54,446
As you know, Linus,
to make a perfect party,

123
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,824
everyone should dress up and be on time,
and good manners only.

124
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,618
Are you getting all of this?

125
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,538
"Good manners only."
"Good manners only."

126
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,498
And at midnight,

127
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:08,085
I want someone to sing that New Year's
song that people always sing.

128
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,294
"Auld Lang Syne?"

129
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:13,298
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

130
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,926
That's the one.
Hey, why don't you sing it?

131
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,261
Oh, okay.

132
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:21,640
But not with those dusty old lyrics.
Here. I wrote some of my own.

133
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:25,644
<i>One thing should never be forgot</i>

134
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:29,314
<i>Lucy's party blew my mind?</i>

135
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:33,402
- Really?
- Of course. I'm a lot of fun to be around.

136
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:37,197
I made some calls this morning
and rented a ballroom. Isn't this great?

137
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,741
I'm not even thinking
about Grandma anymore.

138
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,660
You rented a ballroom?

139
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,545
You wanna throw your party
in this crummy old building?

140
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:19,132
Well, it's a little rough on the outside,
but inside…

141
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,094
she's a real charmer.

142
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,646
How did you pay for a ballroom?

143
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:36,650
In nickels.
Charlie Brown has a lot of problems.

144
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,944
This is perfect.

145
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:42,239
The picture of elegance.
Can't you see it, Linus?

146
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,616
Oh, I see it. I just don't believe it.

147
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,619
Nonsense.
When we're done, it will be amazing.

148
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:53,333
All it needs is a few decorations,
some music and a lot of elbow grease.

149
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:57,254
I don't think I have enough elbows,
and it sure is a big space.

150
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,465
Of course it is.
I'm inviting all of my friends.
Of course it is.
I'm inviting all of my friends.

151
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:04,428
I can't wait to see their adoring faces
smiling back at me,

152
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,722
their gracious and lovable host.

153
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:11,685
Okay. I'm off to prepare the invitations
so I can deliver the good news.

154
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,481
The things a brother will do
for his sister.

155
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:24,031
Build a snowman.
That's a simple resolution. I can do that.

156
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,542
Rats.

157
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,559
Here's the carrot you wanted.

158
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:01,443
Today is your lucky day, Charlie Brown.
I've solved your resolution problem.
Today is your lucky day, Charlie Brown.
I've solved your resolution problem.

159
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:02,528
You have?

160
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,030
I'm inviting you
to my New Year's Eve party,

161
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,866
- and you're in charge of decorations.
- I am?

162
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,035
Am I invited to your party?

163
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,120
Can you stay awake until midnight?

164
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:15,290
If that's a challenge, challenge accepted.

165
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,792
You got some moxie, kid.

166
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:21,630
Okay. Here's your invitation
to Lucy's Gala:

167
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:25,175
A New Year's Eve Celebration
of Elegant Perfection.

168
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,385
That's a mouthful.

169
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,178
Do you wanna go or not?

170
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:33,183
Remember, elegant. Think silver and gold.

171
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:36,520
I want streamers, bows,
festive centerpieces,

172
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,147
and a balloon drop at midnight.

173
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,777
What does decorating
have to do with my resolutions?

174
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:46,071
Your list. Number nine.

175
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:50,617
Number nine, "do something
remotely creative." That's right.

176
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:51,994
Count me in.

177
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,498
And you'll be in charge of the snacks.
Can you handle that?

178
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:57,708
Yes!

179
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,626
- You can count on us.
- What do we bring?

180
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,796
Think "elegant." Finger foods
are the perfect way to go.
Think "elegant." Finger foods
are the perfect way to go.

181
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:06,884
You two are in charge
of getting everyone up and dancing.

182
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,011
- I love to dance.
- Who doesn't?

183
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,762
See you there.

184
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:17,436
You are formally invited
to my New Year's Eve party.

185
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,520
Yes!

186
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:21,899
I was hoping you could make
an ice sculpture of the very lovable host.

187
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,525
- Who's that?
- Me!

188
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:25,986
That's it? No problem.

189
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:30,490
"Lucy's Gala: A New Year's Eve
Celebration of Elegant Perfection."

190
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,160
- That's a mouthful.
- I know!

191
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,457
At the party,
I want you to play something significant.

192
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,125
Do you have anything like that?

193
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,966
No. Do you have something with
a bouncy rhythm you can dance to?

194
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,095
That's it!

195
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:56,183
I can't stand it! I just can't stand it.

196
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,769
Musicians are far too temperamental.

197
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,889
Hey, now that's a beat
you can dance to.

198
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:38,642
What do you say to playing
my New Year's Eve party?

199
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:43,105
I can pay in dog biscuits.

200
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,655
Oh, a photo? I'd be delighted. Cheese.

201
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,241
Enjoy.

202
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,464
Looking good, boys.

203
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,260
You've really outdone yourself,
Charlie Brown.

204
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,721
Yeah. My resolution is within reach.

205
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,181
Hey, what's that?

206
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,184
That's the pull cord
for the balloon drop.

207
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,393
Balloon drop?

208
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:25,105
Of course.
Now let's go over the grand finale.

209
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:28,859
Charlie Brown, come listen.
Your role is very important.

210
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:32,696
As midnight approaches, Linus and I
will be on stage with the band.

211
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:37,284
And when I yell "Happy New Year
to you too," you pull that cord.

212
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,579
- Got it?
- "Happy New Year to you too." Got it.

213
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,122
Happy New Year to you too.

214
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:44,333
I've been thinking about
"Auld Lang Syne" too.

215
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,293
I'm not sure if we're doing it justice.

216
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,463
I agree. We should go back
to the original lyrics.

217
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:53,300
- They have a kind message all about--
- No. I mean the song needs a beat.

218
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:58,138
Now this is the kind of music
to start the New Year off right!

219
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:00,974
Yeah.
Yeah.

220
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:05,145
Lucy, "Auld Lang Syne"
is not a dance number.

221
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:07,356
It's a traditional song with deep meaning.

222
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,066
And it's depressing.

223
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:14,947
A grand finale requires a balloon drop,
flashy costumes and catchy music.

224
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,616
Do it for me, dear brother.

225
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,411
Catchy it is.

226
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:25,040
Perfect. Now I need to get home
so I can start getting ready.

227
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:29,253
Better pick up the pace if we're going to
be ready before our guests arrive.

228
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,880
Linus, how are you with knots?

229
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,125
I'm gonna dance all night.

230
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:53,587
You are lovable,
and this party is going to prove it.

231
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:57,925
Now! The event
you've been waiting for all week!

232
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:00,677
Welcome to Lucy's Gala:
Welcome to Lucy's Gala:

233
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,387
A New Year's Eve Celebration of--

234
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,142
Elegant Perfection.

235
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,605
Party! Look at that! Let's go!

236
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,941
Come on, everyone!

237
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,485
Okay, let's get to work.

238
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,445
Work? I thought this was a party.

239
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,491
Enjoying yourself? Good!

240
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,993
Having a nice time? Wonderful.

241
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:28,247
- Good to see you.
- Don't you just love this party? Me too.

242
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:30,415
Have fun.

243
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,418
"Happy New Year to you too."

244
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,923
Where is my band?

245
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,758
Midnight, you're mine.

246
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:41,176
You said it, sister.

247
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:44,096
Boys!

248
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:48,267
The invitation clearly stated good
manners only. That means no running.

249
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,185
<i>Vámonos</i>.

250
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:52,271
What is this?

251
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:56,024
Where are the fancy little sandwiches
with the crust cut off?

252
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:58,068
I specifically asked for finger food.

253
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,195
You can eat jelly beans with your fingers.
You can eat jelly beans with your fingers.

254
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,364
- And tapioca pudding?
- Yes?

255
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,200
Forget it.

256
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:06,618
What are those?

257
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:10,414
I thought it would be nice if I brought
my world-famous mud pies for dessert.

258
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:15,002
Pigpen, you can't expect anyone
to eat this disgusting slop.

259
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,963
- They're delicious. Hey.
- Linus!

260
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:20,549
I was eating that.

261
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,343
- Here. Take these.
- Mud pies.

262
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:25,637
No, take these away.

263
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,097
We were just trying to help.

264
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,558
We wanted to bring fun party food.

265
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,143
This party is already fun.

266
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:33,645
Look at everyone having fun.

267
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,151
What is the meaning of this?

268
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:40,819
We wanted to dance.

269
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:42,571
So we brought our favorite music.

270
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,782
No, no, no. I have a real band coming.
Thank you.

271
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:49,828
Linus! Where's the band? Where's my music?

272
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:51,580
I'll go find out.

273
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:54,625
Mingle among yourselves.
Have fun!

274
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,711
Schroeder, you're having fun, aren't you?

275
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,756
Doesn't this elegant party
remind you of anyone?
Doesn't this elegant party
remind you of anyone?

276
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,049
I guess so.

277
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:05,969
I knew you'd think so. Would you say
this evening is lovable?

278
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:11,183
I'm gonna go check out
those chairs over there.

279
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,143
Nine o'clock.

280
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,647
Gonna stay awake. Come on, Sally.

281
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,484
It's only nine o'clock?
Being this lovable is exhausting.

282
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,320
Make way. Coming through.

283
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,113
My ice sculpture!

284
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:28,575
Gather round! Gather round, everyone,
for the big reveal!

285
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,244
Finally something exciting.

286
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,120
Drumroll, please.

287
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:39,878
What is so funny? Linus!

288
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:45,968
Linus, find somewhere
to put that… ice thing.

289
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:48,762
What? She didn't like it?

290
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:51,098
Where is my band?

291
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,899
- The band is here.
- Who's ready to dance?
- The band is here.
- Who's ready to dance?

292
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:04,194
- Come dance, Charlie Brown.
- I'll be right back.

293
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:07,447
- Is that a dog band?
- Why not?

294
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:11,535
Good. You're finally here.
Let's get this party started.

295
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,842
No, no, no. I didn't hire you for this.

296
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:29,761
Play something peppy
that everyone can dance to.

297
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:38,061
- I'm gonna sit down.
- I give up.

298
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:43,734
I'm back.

299
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:47,404
Nobody can dance to that.
Dog music stinks.

300
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,949
Linus!

301
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:54,286
I don't understand.

302
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:58,707
This party is the perfect reflection
of me, but no one is having fun.

303
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,834
- Why don't they love me?
- What?
- Why don't they love me?
- What?

304
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:03,045
My party. Why don't they love my party?

305
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:06,089
Maybe if you didn't have
so many expectations and rules--

306
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:10,010
With no rules, this would be a madhouse.
No. We are not trying hard enough.

307
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:11,470
- We?
- Yes.

308
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:14,264
The tone of an elegant party
is set by its hosts.

309
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:18,435
We can still save this night.
Time for a costume change.

310
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:20,646
You're gonna put that on?

311
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:24,525
Don't be silly. No, this is for you.

312
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:28,278
- This is for me.
- But I--

313
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:31,156
The future of my party
is depending on you.

314
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,658
Please, Linus.

315
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,243
If you don't wear this costume

316
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:37,079
and sing that song at midnight
for our grand finale,

317
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:42,709
the night will end in failure and this
whole thing will have been for nothing.

318
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:45,337
You promised you'd help me, so help.

319
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:49,299
I knew I could count on you.

320
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:53,095
And to think,
all my problems would be solved

321
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:55,597
if Grandma had just showed up
for Christmas.

322
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:59,101
Hey! No double-dipping, Maynard.

323
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,103
You're banned from the crudités.
You're banned from the crudités.

324
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:18,412
No, no. I'm awake. I'm awake.

325
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,749
Quiet down, everybody.

326
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,585
Are you all having a good time?

327
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:25,711
Not really.

328
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:30,883
Well, it's 30 minutes until midnight
when we will count down to the New Year.

329
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:32,384
Won't that be fun?

330
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:37,055
Then Linus will lead us in singing
that "Auld Lang"-- whatever song.

331
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:41,185
Come on out here and show everyone
how excited you are for the New Year.

332
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:42,561
I don't want to.

333
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:47,983
Linus, get out here.

334
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:49,318
Oh, my goodness.

335
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,321
Are those feathers?

336
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,948
Go on. Say something.

337
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:01,997
My Sweet Babboo.

338
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,415
So much for elegant.

339
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,253
Linus, get up. You're ruining everything.

340
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:16,929
Lucy, I've done everything I can
to make you happy.

341
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:19,806
I worked all night, all week, even.

342
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,894
And now you're saying
I'm ruining everything. Me?

343
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,729
This could've been a fun party,

344
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,148
but it's you and your perfect rules

345
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:32,027
that have turned a perfectly good holiday
into a perfectly terrible party.

346
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,237
He's right.

347
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:38,784
That's right. I said it.
This party is terrible!

348
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,286
I hereby quit
your terrible party committee.

349
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,789
You can find someone else
to take for granted.

350
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,415
I'm done.

351
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:50,754
- He said it.
- That was a bust.

352
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:53,048
- Come on. Let's go.
- It's not fun at all.

353
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:55,217
- Wait.
- Come on. Let's go.

354
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,387
Go ahead. Leave! This isn't my fault.

355
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,306
I planned a perfectly elegant party.
I planned a perfectly elegant party.

356
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,185
- I never asked for disappointing snacks.
- Hey.

357
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:06,854
Or boring music.

358
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:09,940
And don't get me started
on that ice sculpture.

359
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:12,067
I thought it was good.

360
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,196
Oh, I almost forgot. Happy New Year!

361
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:21,410
Well, happy New Year to you too!

362
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,495
"Happy New Year to you too."

363
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:30,294
Good grief.

364
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:39,511
I'm awake. I'm awake.

365
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:42,306
Wait! It's almost midnight.
Please. Please.

366
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,725
Goodbye, resolution.

367
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,656
You left too?

368
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,160
Yeah. The party
kind of broke up after you left.
Yeah. The party
kind of broke up after you left.

369
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:06,163
- I really hoped it would work.
- What would work?

370
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:09,583
I tried to help Lucy because she thought
that if she threw a party

371
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,668
and everyone showed up
and had a good time,

372
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:14,046
it would prove somehow that she is loved.

373
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:17,674
But that doesn't make any sense.
Of course she's loved.

374
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:18,842
You and I know that.

375
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:23,013
But our grandma didn't come for Christmas
this year, and Lucy took it pretty hard.

376
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:25,349
She thought it was because of her.

377
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,477
Well, that certainly explains a lot.

378
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:30,729
Poor Lucy.

379
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:35,484
"Should auld acquaintance be forgot
and never brought to mind?"

380
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:38,570
It's from the song "Auld Lang Syne."

381
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:42,658
I always sing along
and pretend to know the words.

382
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:43,992
Most people do.

383
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:46,245
As one year turns into the next,

384
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:48,705
"Auld Lang Syne" is a heartfelt reminder

385
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:52,459
that we should never forget our friends
or the good times we've shared.

386
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:55,838
And hopefully,
they will do the same for us.

387
00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:00,342
That's a really nice idea.
That's a really nice idea.

388
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,887
Yeah. Lucy sure could've
used a reminder like that.

389
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:05,532
…eight, seven, six,

390
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:10,579
five, four, three, two, one.

391
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,289
Happy New Year!

392
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:19,421
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

393
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:23,926
<i>And never brought to mind?</i>

394
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:26,845
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

395
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:33,852
- "Should auld acquaintance be forgot?"
- <i>And days of auld lang syne?</i>

396
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:37,523
<i>For auld lang…</i>

397
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,491
One happy New Year to me.

398
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,376
Lucy?

399
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:59,253
I'm sorry about your party.

400
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:03,382
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

401
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:05,133
I ruined everything.

402
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:09,721
I should've been more appreciative
of everything you did. Sorry.

403
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:11,807
Here's your blanket.

404
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:15,561
I should've known my party
was going to be a bust.

405
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:18,981
I'm just… unlovable.

406
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:20,649
That's not true.

407
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:23,110
I love you.

408
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:26,780
You're my brother. You have to love me.

409
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:30,158
Actually, that's not true either.
But I do.

410
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:32,119
And so do a lot of other people.

411
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:34,246
Like who?

412
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,125
Like me, Lucy.

413
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:44,756
Good old Charlie Brown.

414
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,217
Linus told me about your grandma

415
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,344
and what that party meant to you.

416
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:53,265
I know what it's like when things
don't work out the way you'd hoped.

417
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,475
Can I ask you a question?

418
00:32:56,185 --> 00:33:00,898
You fail over and over
and over and over and--
You fail over and over
and over and over and--

419
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:02,149
What's the question?

420
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:06,069
Right.
Well, how do you do it, Charlie Brown?

421
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:10,240
How do you manage to keep going
when life gets you down?

422
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:15,996
I remember that no matter how bad things
may seem, I can always rely on my friends.

423
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:22,503
Thanks, you two. But I'm not sure
how many friends I have after tonight.

424
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:25,839
Good night.

425
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:26,924
Lucy.

426
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:38,393
- Heya, Lucy.
- Good to see you.

427
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:39,728
Hey, old friend!

428
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:43,941
Wha-- What's going on?

429
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:47,069
Charlie Brown let us know
you were going through a hard time.

430
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:48,153
He did?

431
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:49,446
It's okay, Lucy.

432
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,365
Yeah. We all wanted to be here.

433
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:53,742
To remind you that you're not alone.

434
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,620
- But why would you--
- It's what friends do, Lucille.

435
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:58,914
- We're here for you.
- We love you, Lucy.

436
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:00,457
You do?
You do?

437
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,960
I'm… lovable?

438
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,963
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on. Don't be silly.

439
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:11,802
But midnight. The countdown.
The singing. You all missed it.

440
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,388
Because of me.

441
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:15,681
I'm so sorry.

442
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:18,308
Can you ever forgive me?

443
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:21,645
In case you hadn't noticed,
we already have.

444
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,190
Lucy, it's never too late
to make things right.

445
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:27,275
Ten.

446
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,277
Nine, eight,

447
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,322
seven, six, five,

448
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:36,284
four, three, two, one.

449
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,871
Happy New Year!

450
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:48,422
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

451
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:52,759
<i>And never brought to mind?</i>

452
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:57,431
- <i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>
- Who? Me?

453
00:34:57,514 --> 00:35:01,810
<i>And days of auld lang syne?</i>
<i>And days of auld lang syne?</i>

454
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:06,231
<i>For auld lang syne, my dear</i>

455
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:10,277
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

456
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,990
- Hey, Snoopy.
- <i>We'll take a cup of kindness yet</i>

457
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:19,328
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

458
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:23,123
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

459
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:25,709
You know what, Linus? I was wrong.

460
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:30,631
This song is wonderful, and it will always
remind me of all my friends.

461
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:32,549
I thought you might see it that way.

462
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:37,179
<i>For days of auld lang syne</i>

463
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:42,017
<i>For auld lang syne, my dear</i>

464
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,062
Now this is a perfect party.

465
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:48,732
Here. Write this down. "Be a good friend."

466
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,442
"Good friend."

467
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:52,069
- Now cross it off.
- But--

468
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:54,780
Go on. Cross it off. Good.

469
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:57,616
You may not have completed
any resolutions last year,

470
00:35:57,699 --> 00:36:00,244
but you're already covered for this year.
but you're already covered for this year.

471
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:01,995
Happy New Year, Lucy.

472
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,039
Happy New Year, Charlie Brown.

473
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:09,419
<i>We'll take a cup of kindness yet</i>

474
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:15,425
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

475
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:26,687
You should've seen it, Grandma.

476
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,899
We had food, decorations,
music and dancing.

477
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:34,027
And the best part,
all my friends were there.

478
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,072
Yes, Linus was there too.

479
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:39,533
He even led us in singing
"Auld Lang Syne."

480
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:43,537
No, he did not give up his blanket,

481
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,331
but we can work on that
when you visit for my birthday.

482
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:52,838
I love you too, Grandma.
