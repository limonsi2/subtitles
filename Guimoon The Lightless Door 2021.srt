Gosh.

10
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,710
What's up?

11
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,131
That guy tries
to find any excuse not to work.

12
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,676
We gotta get this done today
to be on schedule!

13
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,304
Hey!

14
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,771
-Look.
-What is it?

15
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,275
A body?

16
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,162
{\an8}<i>A concealed body was discovered</i>

17
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,456
{\an8}<i>while renovating</i>
<i>a derelict community center…</i>

18

{\an8}<i>The unidentified body has found</i>

19

00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,347
{\an8}<i>bodies without kin were found</i>
<i>at the community center,</i>

23
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,769
{\an8}<i>and gruesome murders</i>

24
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,063
<i>More information is expected</i>
<i>after the investigation.</i>

25
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,236

We got a nasty restligeist.

30
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,910
As if devouring people wasn't enough,
it took over the entire building.

31
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,939

<i>Do-jin,</i>

37
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,010
<i>my frail body cannot handle this case.</i>

38
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,471
<i>Could you take over?</i>

39
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,271
<i>I can do nothing about my blood,</i>
<i>but I ain't no shaman.</i>

40
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,857
<i>Let's end the shaman heritage with you.</i>

41
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,193
<i>All right.</i>

42
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:37,368
<i>I'm sorry for passing on</i>

00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:55,636
<i>all national highways are breezy</i>
<i>without any congestion.</i>

47
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,599
<i>Due to a large accident</i>

48
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:05,563

TEMPORARILY CLOSED

51
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,760
It wasn't easy
obtaining evidence for an open case.

52
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,345
You know.

53
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,973
And? So what?

54
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,313
-Well, I'm just saying…
-Your wife's cheating, right?

55
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,900
She's about to take off with your seal.
Shouldn't you go?

56
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,494
My mom sure is stubborn.

57
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,748
You can't hold me back.

58
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,168
You know no one can stop me
when I put my mind to it.

59
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,632
So stop pestering and ascend, will you?

60
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,178
Whatever happened in there
that made you do that,

61
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,390

69
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,305
<i>Mom died like that. I can't lose you too.</i>

70
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,642
<i>I'm going there so I can live. All right?</i>

71
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:12,732
<i>I have to release all</i> restligeists

91
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,090
{\an8}-Take a picture of us.
-Here we go.

92
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,716
{\an8}One, two…

93
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,470
{\an8}I got a hold
of last year's contest winner film.

94
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,139
{\an8}It's so bad that I almost puked.

95
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,225
{\an8}Stop bullshitting me.

96
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,351
{\an8}It's not bullshit.

97
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:13,438
{\an8}Look at it.
Everything looks amazing to shoot.

98
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,110
{\an8}No one will know
if someone gets killed here.

99
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,112
{\an8}Holy shit!

100
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,780
{\an8}Your face is hellish!

101
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,367
{\an8}-You ignorant bastard.
-What?

102
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,328
{\an8}Heavy makeup will scare away the ghosts.

103
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,540
{\an8}My mom even puts on chicken blood
when performing a ritual.

104
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,209
{\an8}Chicken blood? So nasty.

105
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,212
{\an8}Tae-hun was here.

106
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,672
{\an8}Write it bigger. Way bigger.

107
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,257
{\an8}-In bloody red.
-Hey!

108
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,801
{\an8}-What about it?
-That's bad luck!

109
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,637
{\an8}Leaving a trace behind
is a tradition for a place like this.

110
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,306
{\an8}But why leave my name?

111
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,225
{\an8}-We're here because of you.
-Goddamnit.

112
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,269
{\an8}Don't you dare swear at me again.

113
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:56,064
{\an8}-What if we can never get out of here?
-Stop jinxing with that crap!

114
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,942
{\an8}-Holy shit, stop shouting!
-Why? You scared?

115
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,360
{\an8}That graffiti…

116
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,822
{\an8}I think I saw it before.

117
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,491
{\an8}-He's scared.
-So scared.

118
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,493
{\an8}It rubs me the wrong way!

119
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,663
{\an8}Why is he being a bitch?
I'll smack you with the shovel.

120
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:17,502
{\an8}What should we do with this scaredy cat?

121
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,968
{\an8}What was that?

122
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,861
Sorry! I'm sorry.

123
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,700
Why are you two so chickenshit?

124
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,870
-Do we really have to do this?
<i>-</i>Absolutely.

125
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,831
You're dropping out
because you can't pay the tuition.

126
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,666
The prize for this contest is huge.

127
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,294
Seeing and analyzing
all the past contest winners,

128
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,838
this will definitely work.

129
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,841
-But even so…
-Stop that.

130
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,843
Aren't you thankful of us?

131
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,553
If you are, then say so.

132
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,846
Yeah, man.

133
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:15,560
Hey! It's almost time. Let's get going!

134
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,401
Geez.

135
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,821
Wait for me!

136
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,416
-It's almost time. Four minutes left.
-Hey.

137
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,501
Geez.

138
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,294
I told you to wait for me.

139
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,047
Are you a child?
There's no time. Start shooting.

140
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,591
If we don't get this, we're so screwed.

141
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,386
Then Tae-hun will shave his head
and be drafted to the military.

142
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,471
All right. I'm feeling it. It's coming.

143
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,395
One, two, three.

144
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,857
{\an8}Many years ago,

145
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,402
{\an8}the custodian of this building…
Damn it. The community…

146
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:10,532
{\an8}killed the owners and guests
on the third floor with a crowbar…

147
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:16,163
{\an8}A shovel.
We're standing at that very crime scene.

148
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:22,544
<i>The custodian's motive is still unknown.</i>

149
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,587
<i>Why?</i>

150
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,008
<i>Because he committed suicide afterwards.</i>

151
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:33,388
<i>Other mysterious and fatal incidents</i>
<i>continued to take place here.</i>

152
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,892
{\an8}Then a strange rumor started to spread.

153
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,644
{\an8}On Old Year's Night,
the last day of lunar year!

154
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,607
{\an8}The moon normally
does not shine at midnight,

155
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:48,528
{\an8}but it's supposedly visible
only from this roof.

156
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,999
{\an8}If a moon really does show up
at midnight tonight,

157
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:05,462
{\an8}it's the moon of the afterlife,
not of the living.

158
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:10,217
{\an8}The energy from it
is passed down the hallway

159
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,928
{\an8}and opens the door.

160
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,848
<i>Guimoon…</i>

161
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:23,772
{\an8}a boundary
between the dead and the living.

162
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,984
Forget it. That's enough.

163
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,111
Screw Guimoon. It's freezing here.

164
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,698
{\an8}The shaman said it'd be here 100%…

165
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,283
Screw the afterlife moon.

166
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,745
-Maybe she lied.
-Let's just go get drunk.

167
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:39,996
I'm buying.

168
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,623
-Let's go. Come on.
-Hold on.

169
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,500
Wait, stop.

170
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,876
What is it?

171
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,877
Shit.

172
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:47,879
-It's up.
-What?

173
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:48,880
Don't mess around.

174
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,674
-I don't see anything.
-Let's just go.

175
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,717
-It's really up.
-Let me see.

176
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,269
{\an8}Oh, my God. It was for real.

177

{\an8}You see that?

181
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,459
What the hell?

182
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,462
It's locked.

183
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,465
-What?
-It won't open. Damn it!

184
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,094
Move aside.

185
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,055

Hey.

207
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,590

208
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,426
Can you talk?

209

Talk to me.

You're Park Dae-hyeok, born 1968.

211

Right?

212
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,667
I have a particular skill,
so I want to help you,

213
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,461
but let me ask you one thing.

214
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:07,800
Before Kim went nuts
on that night in 1990,

215
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,261
what happened in this building--

216
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,848
I'll help you get out of here.

217
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,102
So hang in there.

218

Shit!

221
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,792
Sorry.

222
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,295
{\an8}It's a piece of glass. Why is this here?

223
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,757
{\an8}How could it only appear on the camcorder?

224
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,801
{\an8}No one's gonna believe it, right?

225
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:35,054
{\an8}This is the perfect time to spot a ghost.

226
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,639
{\an8}What?

227
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,017
{\an8}What is it?

228
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,561
{\an8}There's…

229
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,272
{\an8}What? Saw something?

230
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,691
{\an8}-No, it's nothing.
-What is it?

231
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,777
Something's there?

232
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,446
Move out of the way.

233
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,661
{\an8}Guys, it's ten past midnight.

234
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,997
{\an8}-We're in the third-floor hallway.
-Hey.

235
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,543
{\an8}-This is where Kim Seok-ho killed people.
-Let's just leave.

236
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,296
{\an8}That's why most ghost sightings
happened here.

237
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,506
{\an8}-Damn it!
-Gosh. What?

238
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,467
{\an8}Stupid punk!

239
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,927
{\an8}Did you breathe into my neck?

240
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,930
Are you nuts? You stink.

241
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,976
{\an8}Someone definitely breathed into my neck!

242
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,021
What was that?

243
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,776
Hang on. We have to shoot something
to win the prize.

244
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,822
{\an8}We definitely heard a strange noise.

245
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,492
{\an8}Could it be Kim Seok-ho?

246
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,036
-Damn it.
-Holy crap.

247
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,290
-You startled me.
-Hey. This is crazy.

248
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,127
Something's definitely in there.

249
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,338
Guys.

250
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,425
If we get something,
we'll win grand prize for sure.

251
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,303
-Yeah, grand prize.
-You morons…

252
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,516
Hey, Hye-yeong! Hey!

253
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,186
-Damn it.
-Geez.

254
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,564
You idiot. What's with you?

255
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,776
I told you.
We shouldn't be here any longer.

256
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:12,735
My gosh.

257
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,862
Then you should've stopped us
from the beginning.

258
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,494
-Hey.
-Hye-yeong!

259
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,125
-You scared the crap out of me!
-Hey!

260
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:32,046
What? You nuts? What are you doing alone?

261
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,507
You chickenshits.

262
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,051
Hey. Take a look.

263
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,392
{\an8}That was it?

264
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,939
You guys are so funny.

265
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:53,734
Didn't you just tease me
for getting scared?

266
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,613
But there's

267
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,991
no draft here.

268
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:07,707
What?

269
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,430
What is it?

270
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,975
Someone breathed down my neck again.

271
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,686
{\an8}-I heard a laugh right beside me too.
-Geez.

272
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,771
{\an8}-You heard it wrong.
-I didn't!

273
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,857
Let's get out of here!

274
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,445
Guys.

275
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,197
What?

276
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,907
-What's wrong?
-What is it?

277
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,160
Hye-yeong…

278
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,539
What the hell is it?

279
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,967
Fuck! What was that?

280
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,346
It was a ghost!

281
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,513
Shut the hell up!

282
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:15,316
Hye-yeong. It's us. Snap out of it!

283
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,286
Fuck.

284
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,039
You disloyal bastards.

285
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,458
Are you even my friends?

286
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,169
Hey. My camera…

287
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,673
Where's my camera?

288
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,432
Do you know how expensive that is?

289
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,309
You can't get it in Korea!

290
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,894
Screw your camera.

291
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,771
Let's just leave!

292
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,817
Hey! Dude!

-Wait for me.
-Come on, man!

296
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,491
Get down here!

298
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,584
<i>-You heard it wrong.</i>
<i>-I didn't!</i>

299
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,712

300
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,797

<i>It could be our delusion.</i>

308
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,326
<i>Or we didn't see the floor number…</i>

309
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,952
<i>We kept walking down.</i>

310
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,413
What the hell?

311
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,085
What the shit?

312
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,379
You scared me!

313
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,760
Won-jae, why are you here?

314
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,553
I should be asking you that.

315
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,014
Shit, I'm sure we came down
from the second floor.

316
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,265
Guys.

317
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:15,311
There's something in here.
I heard voices. Ours!

318
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,068
Shit.

319
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:24,987
What's that?

320
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,750
Bastards…

321
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,754
I should have been careful.
Goddamn it. Now they know.

322
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,846
What was that?

323
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,899
<i>Won-jae, come on! Get over here!</i>

324
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,025
Damn it.

325
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,154
The dimensions are intertwined?

326
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,906
<i>Come on, asshole!</i>

327
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,241
<i>Hey, Won-jae!</i>

Answer me.

Who are you? How did you get in here?

332
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,967
We're college students…

333

Please help us!

334
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,513
We can't find the exit!

335
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,642
There are monsters! No, ghosts!

336
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,185
Find somewhere to hide!

337
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,604

I'm not Na Hyeon-jeong.

348
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,624
Then who are you?

349
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,212
Yun Mi-rin.

350
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,466
Yun Mi-rin?

351
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,847
All right.

352
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,395
I don't know who you are…

353
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,527
but a <i>restligeist</i> can't be here.

354
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,541
Yun Mi-rin!

355
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,982
Just run! What's that black thing?

356
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,485
Shut the hell up and run!
We have to get out of here!

357
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,278
Shit!

358
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,574
It's the same place! Same hallway!

359
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,285
We ran down here,
but we're on the second floor again!

360
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,746
Just go! Hurry!

361
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,500
Goddamn! Second floor again!

362
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,133
Won-jae, get the hell up!

363
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,437
Born 1976…

364
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,774
Yun Mi-rin.

365
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,442
MISSING CHILD

366
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,415
First floor.

367
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,634
What?

368
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,802
There's no door.

369
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,805
The damn door is gone!

370
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:28,071
-I heard my voice.
-There was one right here.

371
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:31,366
These glyphs weren't here when we came in.

372
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,118
I am sure it was my voice.

373
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:38,165
We will all die here.

374
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,375
Shut your damn mouth!

375
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,336
I told you we should leave!

376
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,171
You didn't listen to me then--

377
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,672
Hey! Stop it!

378
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,639
The roof.

379
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,433
Let's get to the roof.

380
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,354
Jump off or whatever. There will be a way.

381
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,578
You stupid idiot.

382
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,027
No.

383
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:33,859
Mom!

384
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,736
Mom!

385
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,667
I'm sorry, Mom.

386
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,216
Son of a bitch.

387
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,351
You can't go.

388
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,439
If you go now, you'll die.

389
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,953
Come with me, please.

390
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:31,541
Hurry!

391
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,153
It's Kim Seok-ho!

392
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,447
It was definitely Kim Seok-ho.

393
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,074
Hey!

394
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,453
It'd be better to hide until sunrise.

395
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,538
Wherever we go, it's the same…

396
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,004
The door opened by itself.

397
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,215
Where is this voice coming from?

398
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:22,926
Mister.

399
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,263
Hurry.

400
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:29,891
Who is that?

401
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,563
Hye-yeong, what are you doing?
Hye-yeong!

402
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,233
Hye-yeong!

403
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,402
Won-jae, what are you doing?

404
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,738
Hye-yeong!

405
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:58,795
Won-jae!

406
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,602
Where am I?

407
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,526
Won-jae! Tae-hun!

408
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,987
Yun Mi-rin went missing in 1990.

409
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,619
That's you, right?

410
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:18,041
I didn't go missing.

411
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:19,793
What?

412
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,379
I was…

413
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,341
always here.

414
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:32,180
<i>It wasn't me. It wasn't me!</i>

415
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,598
<i>Shut up!</i>

416
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,558
Where did this crazy bitch come from?

417
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,019
It wasn't me! She did it!

418
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,313
It wasn't me!

419
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,733
It wasn't me!

420
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:44,984
Dad!

421
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,320
Please!

422
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,115
No!

423
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,701
Dad!

424
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,120
Dad! I'm sorry!

425
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,759
If you hit me again…

426
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,557
I'll kill you bastards first.

427
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,945
<i>The missing case of Yun Mi-rin,</i>

428
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:33,032
<i>who went missing last August,</i>
<i>is at a standstill for several months.</i>

429
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:37,704
<i>The police are unable to rely on</i>
<i>testimonies of the parents,</i>

430
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,081
<i>and will expand the search nationwide.</i>

431

432
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,463

433
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:10,570
Free me at once!

434
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,947
I'll kill you all!

435
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:17,202
Let go of me!

436
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,141
Who are you?

437
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:20,473
"Multiple personality disorder."

438
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,019
MPD GHOST IS HERE

439
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:31,693
The one in control
of this place isn't Kim…

440
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,404
<i>Kill...</i>

441
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,699
It's another you.

442
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:43,496
The other you is controlling him to kill.

443
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,876
From that night in 1990 on…

444
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,340
<i>You killed everyone who came here.</i>

445
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,276
<i>No.</i>

446
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,320
<i>It wasn't me!</i>

447
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,071
No…

448
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,573
I can make this go away.

449
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:23,036
You want to flee from her, no?

450
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:25,330
No.

451
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,875
She shouldn't be messed with…

452
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,794
-No…
-It's okay, Mi-rin.

453
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,588
That girl hiding inside you.

454
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:34,922
What's her name?

455
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:38,509
This will be all over when she's gone.

456
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,472
Her name is Kim…

457
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:47,602
Kim…

458
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:50,605
Yu…

459
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:53,399
No.

460
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:57,445
-No.
-Tell me again. What did you say?

461
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,821
What's her name?

462
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,950
Tell me!

463
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,831
Get off me!

464
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,893
{\an8}<i>Something's wrong.</i>
<i>I have to block the door!</i>

465
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:31,896
{\an8}FEBRUARY 10, 1990
MAY 7, 1995

466
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:35,168
Name and date of birth.

467
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:42,425
Hong Hye-yeong…

468
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,472
born in 1975.

469
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:52,977
1975, Hong Hye-yeong.

470
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:59,650
What are you doing?

471
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:03,654
You okay?

472
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,741
What the hell.

473
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,495
-I'll kill you all!
-Wait! Stop!

474
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:20,129
Mister,

475
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:24,717
you're a human, aren't you?

476
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,224
Stupid punks.

477
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,601
It was you guys?

478
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:36,103
Mister!

479
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,355
Lower your voice.

480
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,442
How did you kids come in here?

481
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,277
Are you guys crazy?

482
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,531
I know, really.

483
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,783
You can help us, right?

484
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,661
Can't you help us find our friend?

485
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,496
What the hell for?

486
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,582
If they took him away, he's a goner.

487
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:00,002
"They"?

488
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,676
Would you even understand?

489
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,264
Instead of finding him,
worry about getting out of here.

490
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:12,348
Hold up.

491
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:15,768
Look in front of you.

492
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:20,815
They're all walls.

493
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,155
No way. I got out of Guimoon already.

494
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,615
No, that can't be.

495
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,410
There was a door when we came down here!

496
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:33,703
Goddamnit!

497
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,456
Something's messed up.

498
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,334
We have to hurry. Hurry!

499
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:52,346
I came back to the building,
but now the dimension has changed.

500
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,557
-We're here!
-Shit!

501
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,933
Please! Help us!

502
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,602
-Won-jae?
-Open this door!

503
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:00,646
What is it?

504
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,680
Won-jae! Lee Won-jae!

505
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,475
Do you want to die? That's a bait.

506
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,605
If you approach him,
you'll end up like him.

507
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:43,522
He's right.

508
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,025
Our lives come first.

509
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,778
Tae-hun, are you nuts?

510
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,404
He said Won-jae's dead!

511
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,826
Won-jae's dead.

512
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:58,579
There's nothing we can do.

513
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:13,678
Guys, I can't see.

514
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,931
Get me out of here.

515
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,558
She said so.

516
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:22,728
We can get out if we find the key.

517
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:23,771
Won-jae!

518
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:30,861
You there?

519
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,325
There you are.

520
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,574
Don't kid around.

521
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:17,950
If you do…

522
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,874
-Open the door!
-If you do, I'll kill you all!

523
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,759
Hey, Kang Tae-hun!

524
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,720
Let go! Damn it!

525
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:38,888
I'm gonna live.

526
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,849
-I'm going home!
-Wake up, you bastard!

527
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:43,893
We can go together.

528
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:45,686
Tae-hun.

529
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,153
Son of a bitch.

530
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,045
I want to live.

531
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:13,631
Fuck.

532
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,760
I want to go home.

533
01:08:56,632 --> 01:09:00,052
IT'S ALL

534
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,889
Something's…

535
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,935
Something's wrong.

536
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:09,603
IT'S ALL OVER

537
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:13,315
Why is he spraying that message there?

538
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:20,906
What do you mean?

539
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,075
Also…

540
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,496
that's not the end of what I saw earlier.

541
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:31,208
There's one more line below.

542
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,088
"MPD…

543
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,008
ghost…

544
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:42,928
is here."

545
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,698
I certainly got out of there.

546
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,242
How did a<i> restligeist…</i>

547
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:07,912
What the hell's going on here?

548
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,499
How do you know about the graffiti,

549
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,460
and how does Tae-hun know about that too?

550
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:15,794
What's today's date?

551
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:23,427
February 19 of…

552
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:25,930
1996.

553
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:42,196
<i>Here is the traffic report</i>
<i>for February 11, 2002.</i>

554
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:47,201
What the hell's happening around here?

555
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:52,748
What's that for?

556
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,378
You'll do to us what you did to Won-jae?

557
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:00,422
You'll kill me too?

558
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:04,051
I'm not trying to kill you.

559
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,138
You are already dead.

560
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:12,935
No, I'm not.

561
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:16,021
You're so full of shit.

562
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:20,276
No! No way!

563
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,885
No.

564
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,555
I can live! I really can!

565
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,276
I can live if you die.

566
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:14,747
You'll regret this.

567
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:19,960
When I die, you'll be stuck here forever.

568
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:23,756
She said when she has your life,

569
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,050
she'll let me live!

570
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:28,385
<i>-Kill him.</i>
-She'll send me home!

571
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:30,012
<i>Kill him.</i>

572
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:41,982
But…

573
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,653
it might be different this time.

574
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:48,614
She told me that.

575
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:52,993
She said she'll let me live
if I kill you all.

576
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:56,997
Kill.

577
01:12:57,081 --> 01:13:00,459
She'll let me go home.

578
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:30,572
Kill everyone! So you can live!

579
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:32,825
No, stop it!

580
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:35,369
You stupid bitch, do you want to die?

581
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:38,288
Please stop!

582
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:12,739
I need to kill you quick...

583
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:28,005
I'm the one who'll leave, not you!

584
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:30,174
Me!

585
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,140
The dead cannot walk out of that door.

586
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:56,992
I remember…

587
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,037
Son of a bitch.

588
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,207
You did it last time too.

589
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:07,878
You killed us all.

590
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:23,602
Help me!

591
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,245
Let me…

592
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,958
Let me go.

593
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:50,629
I don't want to rot here forever.

594
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:04,518
Please…

595
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,819
Born 1975…

596
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,114
Hong Hye-yeong.

597
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:23,495
Rest in peace.

598
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:28,875
No! Please let me go!

599
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:30,669
Please!

600
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:06,473
What the hell?

601

Shut your mouth!

605
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:00,944
You think you can take me on?
