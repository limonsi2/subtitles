No, no, fuck that. You'd have to pay me.

[Macon] What? Pay you?
She's throwing herself at you!

No, I'm serious.
Not even for, like, a million--

[Macon] We really can't all be

Why are you so serious right now?

'Cause it's like pure protein.

Why would I want good protein
out of my body before--

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,000
[Macon] All right, but do not oversleep.

Yeah, I'll be there.
Kickoff's in like four hours.

in her infinite wisdom,

that, "The greatest problem
in the world today is intolerance."

instead of someone actually oppressed?

217
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,416

showed me the meaning of courage

218
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,041

to our school as she, he, and they,

219
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,083

220
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,250

225
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,041

00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,208
right?

349
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,208
I mean, who do you think it--

350
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Marcus?

351
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,000
[harp ringtone playing]

352
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,625
[ominous music playing]

353
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,541
-Seriously, stop it.
-[Marcus] Uh, what?

354
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,125
-I know you're not sick.
-[Marcus] What are you talking about?

355
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,708
'Cause I was just talking to you. Here.

356
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,916
You were right here.

357
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,625
[Katie on recording] Some races
have higher IQs than other races.

358
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,750
-It's basic science. Look it up.
-[Marcus] I'm not lying.

359
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,166
Marcus, I'll call you back.

360
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,833
[Katie on recording]
And yet these libtard academics,

361
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:49,041
who keep proclaiming
to be the protectors of science,

362
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,125
suddenly start crying, "Fake news!"

363
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:54,708
when all we're doing
is presenting scientific fact.

364
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,250
And why is that?

365
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:00,458
Because liberals worship
at the altar of equality and diversity.

366
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,208
Which means every little snowflake

367
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:06,208
has to be exactly the same,
and there can be no differences.

368
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,750
Oh my…

369
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,458
[Katie on recording] Makes you wonder

370
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,291
-how many good white Americans…
-Look.

371
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:15,250
Hey, I don't know who…
what this is. [laughs nervously]

372
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:22,958
Okay. Okay, so maybe I recorded,
like, one episode of a podcast,

373
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,458
but no one was supposed to…

374
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,208
l posted it anonymously.

375
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,541
Also, it's like…
it's like satire, you know?

376
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,291
It's a goof.
I… I'm making fun of these fucks, right?

377
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,791
[Katie on recording]
I am a racial realist, people.

378
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:41,583
Listen to my words,
not your moonbat zombie groupthink.

379
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,041
I'm not out here saying, "I'm a racist."

380
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,125
I'm just saying
they're not as smart, okay?

381
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,208
[sinister music playing]

382
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,208
[panting]

383
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:54,833
[screams]

384
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,125
[screams]

385
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:03,958
[woman] …the occasion,
I love that you wore yellow.

386
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,291
It should be open by now, right?

387
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,375
[Katie gasping]

388
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,125
[whimpering]

389
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:24,750
[Katie on recording] Each ethnicity
has strengths and weaknesses.

390
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:27,541
Truth is, these SJWs,

391
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:31,875
all they want to do
is destroy white society.

392
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,666
To them, if you're white,

393
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,041
you're the enemy.

394
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,666
You're guilty.

395
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:42,666
Just makes you wonder
how many good white Americans

396
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,166
are gonna be sacrificed on that altar

397
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,500
before we realize
the emperor has no clothes.

398
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,375
[yelping]

399
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:54,750
[screams]

400
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,583
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry!

401
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,875
[panting]

402
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:06,083
[Katie on recording] Don't need Wikipedia
to figure that out. It's history.

403
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,541
But that does not make us superior.
They just…

404
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,125
[screams]

405
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,666
[Katie on recording]
…on average, than all other races.

406
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,666
-[operator] 911, what's your emergency?
-[Katie] Hi, the killer's here.

407
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,250
He's wearing a mask of my face,

408
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:26,541
and he's forcing me to record
offensive hate speech at knifepoi--

409
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,791
[Katie on recording]
Unlike a progressive,

410
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:37,333
who'd argue even an aborted fetus
can qualify for the Olympics.

411
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,833
…use it for something.

412
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:40,500
-Hi, Father!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

413
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:41,875
[woman] No, no.

414
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,625
[Katie speaks indistinctly on recording]

415
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:46,083
-Do you hear that?
-[indistinct whispering]

416
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:49,791
[Katie on recording]
…establish our own white communities,

417
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:52,250
our own white school system.

418
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,500
-I mean, that's the dream, right?
-Goodness!

419
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:58,083
[Katie on recording]
White kids actually getting to celebrate

420
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:02,083
their beautiful, God-given white skin.

421
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,875
[sheriff] Rest assured,
we are following every lead,

422
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,541
working 24-7 to solve these crimes,

423
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:15,166
which is why we're enacting
a citywide curfew, 8:00 p.m.,

424
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,916
merely as a precaution,
but one thing is clear.

425
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,333
The killer or killers seem intent

426
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:24,416
on exposing intimate information

427
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,041
about his or her or their victims.

428
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:31,083
And since both victims
were seniors at Osborne High,

429
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:33,791
that's where we're gonna start looking.

430
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,916
There's a lot of rumors going around

431
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,583
that the killer wore a mask
of victims' faces

432
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:39,958
or has cameras.

433
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:42,750
We're just focusing on what we know.

434
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:54,916
[sighs]

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,458

[phone ringing]

438
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,791
Hey.

439
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,833
-[banging on door]
-Aren't you glad you moved here?

440
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:29,625
-[woman] Let me in!
-[Makani] What?

441
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:32,583
-I'm on the phone!
-[woman] Did you lock the door?

442
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,125
-[sighs]
-[woman] Goddamn it!

443
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:39,875
-Sorry, my mom is just like--
-[Makani] I know. I know.

444
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:41,583
You ain't gotta apologize.

445
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,416
[Rodrigo] You know, you're
so lucky you don't live with parents.

446
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:46,458
You all right?

447
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,208
Oh yeah. I just-- I have a cold.

448
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,625
Just been taking some cold medicine.

449
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:54,541
Hmm.

450
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:58,333
[Rodrigo] Look,
I know this sounds selfish,

451
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,750
but can't I just have a normal life
where no one gets murdered,

452
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:05,416
and I get a girlfriend, and I go
to college, and I get to program games?

453
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,791
I mean, is that stupid?

454
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,916
It's stupid. Just-- You can ignore me.

455
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,625
You keep calling me, Ro,
when I know you really wanna call Alex.

456
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,250
I'm just kind of afraid, maybe.

457
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:20,666
[Makani] You hide it so well.

458
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:24,500
I guess we can't hide
anything anymore. Can we?

459
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,791
[ominous music playing]

460
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:35,125
[indistinct chattering]

461
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,833
What do you think they're asking?

462
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:41,750
If you're white, "What's good on TV?"
If you're brown, "Why are you murdering?"

463
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,458
Yeah, hence this itchy-ass suit.

464
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:45,083
[deputy] Uh, Macon Bewley.

465
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,291
Think the killer's in this room right now?

466
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,833
I don't know.

467
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,791
Makes my head hurt.
Doesn't make sense, you know?

468
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:53,916
Like, why would the killer go after Katie?

469
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,833
Because Katie
and Jackson both had secrets.

470
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:02,208
-[Rodrigo] Hey, look at his body language.
-Look at his face.

471
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:05,125
He's touching his mouth.
He's not making any eye contact.

472
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:07,541
It's the two top-ten tells
someone's full of shit.

473
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:08,500
Hmm.

474
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,458
You see everything, Ro.

475
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:11,458
[chuckles]

476
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:12,708
It's exhausting.

477
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:16,541
[Alex] You know,
this happens all the time.

478
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:19,333
Football players getting brain damage.
They start stabbing people.

479
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:21,333
It's like-- It's a thing.

480
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:24,458
You know it's just as cliché
to hate football as it is to play it?

481
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:27,625
-They're not the worst.
-[Alex] They're the worst to you.

482
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,583
Confused, okay. There's a difference.

483
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:32,375
Mmm.

484
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:35,625
You guys are looking
at the wrong side of the table.

485
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,916
-[Alex] The sheriff?
-Hello?

486
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,708
There's a referendum
on the ballot next month

487
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:42,125
to dissolve the Police Department.

488
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,875
-That's legal?
-Replace it with private security.

489
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:47,958
But not if he solves a series of murders,

490
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:51,333
and by that, I mean blaming it
on someone who's not white

491
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:52,875
and becoming a local hero.

492
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:54,166
Comforting.

493
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:01,708
Or it could just be the most obvious.

494
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:04,458
Tragic past, no friends.

495
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:05,791
So, basically us.

496
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:06,875
What? No.

497
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:09,958
No, you guys just are who you are.

498
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,541
That's your thing.
You don't have any secrets.

499
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:16,000
Unless you got something
you wanna let us know.

500
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,000
[deputy] Zachariah Sandford.

501
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:21,750
Your dad's lawyer
just invoked your constitutional rights,

502
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,833
so you're free to go.

503
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,875
[girl] What a joke!

504
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:29,208
[boy] Of course. Lucky him. Whatever.

505
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:35,916
Careful out there, friend.
I mean that with love.

506
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:38,333
There's some crazy fucks in this town.

507
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:43,041
RIP with Dave,
the best and only Uber driver in town.

508
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,250
That's "ride in peace." Want a flyer?

509
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,041
How about you guys? Are you going in?

510
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,250
[sighs]

511
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:58,875
I, uh… I drove myself. So…

512
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:13,375
Dad, I'm sorry.

513
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,500
I'm trying to put those boys
out of business this next election.

514
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:18,583
-I know.
-Yet here you are.

515
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:21,708
I was halfway to
the International Terminal in Omaha when--

516
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:23,125
Everyone was coming.

517
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:26,291
-My friends--

01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,875
Your grandma called. Are you-- Jesus!

1046
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:07,791
Yeah, my friend's been attacked.
1412 Prescott! Hurry!

1047
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:11,000
-[woman] Sending a patrol car right away.
-[sobbing] It was Ollie. It was Ollie!

1048
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:12,750
You were right.

1049
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:15,291
[sobbing] They're gonna know.

1050
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:16,916
They're all gonna know.

1051
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:17,958
Know what?

1052
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:20,000
[sobbing continues]

1053
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:20,916

[sinister music playing]

1055
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:41,791
Mmm.

1056
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,958
Hey, baby.

1057
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:50,333
What?

1058
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:53,125
He was there.

1059
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:57,375
Gam, he was there. He was there.

1060
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:58,708
They got him, sweetie.

1061
01:06:58,791 --> 01:07:00,500
-They found him.
-You're safe.

1062
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,083
[Gam] It's okay.

1063
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:03,541
You're okay.

1064
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:05,333
We're all here.

1065
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:10,041
Did he text everyone?

1066
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:13,125
[Darby] I stopped reading.

1067
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:17,458
Thought you'd maybe like us
to hear it, you know, from you.

1068
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:23,375
I'm gonna get a coffee.

1069
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:24,666
Give you a few.

1070
01:07:37,041 --> 01:07:38,458
[girl] Open your eyes.

1071
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:41,500
[girls laughing]

1072
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:47,208
Okay, bitches. You think
you got what it takes to win State?

1073
01:07:47,958 --> 01:07:49,750
'Cause I don't see shit.

1074
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:51,791
[girls continue laughing]

1075
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:53,500
What's your name, bitch?

1076
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:59,583
[gagging]

1077
01:07:59,666 --> 01:08:02,416
-Hold up. These girls kidnapped you?
-These were your friends?

1078
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:05,541
Sometimes friends, I don't know.

1079
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:09,541
They were seniors.
It was my first year on varsity.

1080
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:12,083
-Varsity what?
-You played sports?

1081
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:14,500
[girl] Are you a hungry little bitch?

1082
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:15,833

1085
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:21,000
[girl] Drink up, bitches!

1086
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:24,916
[Makani] They were hazing us.
Tried to get us to turn on each other.

1087
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,416
-[girl] You can do better than that!
-[Makani] We were out of our minds.

1088
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,458
[girl] How's that taste, Makani, huh?

1089
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,583
Hey, Jasmine.

1090
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:39,666
[gasps, screams]

1091
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:46,666
I just…

1092
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:49,625
pushed.

1093
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:55,583
Jasmine survived, but there were burns.

1094
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,000
Her face was, um…

1095
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:06,083
I got charged and went to trial.

1096
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:11,083
Even after I was acquitted,
I still got threats

1097
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:12,958
daily.

1098
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:17,208
My parents blamed each other.

1099
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:21,250
[scoffs] They'd been looking
for a reason to break up anyway.

1100
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:30,166
I was so ashamed of myself.

1101
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:33,833
So I moved here.

1102
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:39,500
Took my mom's maiden name and just…

1103
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:43,375
[sighs] …tried to become
a different person.

1104
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:44,833
You are a different person.

1105
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,833
I've never met
the person you're talking about.

1106
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:52,083
You bring me doughnuts
because you know they soothe me.

1107
01:09:52,708 --> 01:09:56,916
You proofread my essays.
You stand up for me in public.

1108
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,583
That's who you are.

1109
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:03,125
I mean, you gave Ollie Larsson
the benefit of the doubt.

1110
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:04,541
And he's a murderer.

1111
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:07,750
Yeah, you gave a fucking murderer
the chance to show he's decent.

1112
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:14,416
-To no more secrets between friends.
-[chuckles]

1113
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,708
It's a fucking hospital, Zach!
Wait till we get her home!

1114
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:20,583
I'm not saying that we have to smoke it.
It… it's symbolic.

1115
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:23,458
I'm not really good with hugs.

1116
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,125
-[Alex] Come on.
-[Makani chuckles]

1117
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:40,916
[reporter] KRDY News has learned
that the Sloan County sheriffs

1118
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,125
have made an arrest,

1119
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:44,958
and suspect Oliver Larsson is in custody.

1120
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:47,875
A sense of calm has returned
to this small Nebraska town,

1121
01:10:47,958 --> 01:10:51,666
and plans to move forward
with the Corn in the USA Festival next--

1122
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:56,708

1123

[country music playing]

1124
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:35,625
[Skipper] This year, the Fall Harvest
Festival should be a celebration.

1125
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,750
People here, they have
a right to feel safe, protected,

1126
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:44,000
and our little police force, good men all,
but they are sadly undermanned.

1127
01:11:44,083 --> 01:11:47,000
That's why
Sandford Family Farms has stepped in.

1128
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:48,958
We've hired private security,

1129
01:11:49,041 --> 01:11:50,625
free of charge.

1130
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:52,125

1131
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:53,333
These men are here

1132
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:56,750
so people can enjoy themselves
and these fine festivities.

1133
01:11:57,583 --> 01:12:02,333
Nothing, absolutely nothing's
gonna stop this proud corn town

1134
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:04,416
from shucking the events of the past

1135
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:08,666
and buttering itself up
for another great year to come.

01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:15,750
Um, yeah, but I… I thought…
I thought Zach was picking you up?

1138
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:19,541
[Alex] Fuck. I forgot to tell you.
His dad's making him work the corn maze.

1139
01:12:19,625 --> 01:12:23,125
-Can't you just take the bus?
-Oh shit. Alex, they all just left.

1140
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:25,333
[Alex] All right, we'll turn around.
We're not far.

1141
01:12:25,416 --> 01:12:27,666

[Ollie] Hi. Yes.

1168
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:46,166
We need an ambulance at Osborne High.
Someone's been stabbed.
