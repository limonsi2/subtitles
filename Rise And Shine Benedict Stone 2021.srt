5
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,266
Why don't we, uh,
take a vacation, you know?

6
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,433
That's a break from everything.

7
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:06,100
And then...

8
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,567
we can try again,

9
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,934
when it feels right.

10
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:36,767
Is Emilia here?

11
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,767
Oh! Coffee shop.

12
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,700
Okay, okay.

13
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:51,700
Hey there.

14
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:53,867
Hi. I only have the half-hour.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,500
I know.
I'm sorry, Emilia.

16
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:58,266
I got all the stuff
that you asked for.

17
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,300
Took a while to find
that blue scarf.

18
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,000
I know you would've walked
right toward it.

19
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:04,300
Thank you for bringing these.

20
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,233
How's the painting?
Did you find a place to work?

21
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:10,967
Uh, it's small,
but it has decent light,

22
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,500
-so it'll do for now.
-Only for now?

23
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,300
Um...

24
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,433
I, um, ordered you
a chocolate croissant.

25
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,934
Benedict... please.

26
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:25,133
It's been months.

27
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:26,100
Two months.

28
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:29,900
Are you really this...
okay with this?

29
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,834
We both need the time.

30
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:32,967
Yeah. Okay.

31
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,433
All right.
Let's take a vacation.

32
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:38,233
Right? You're a teacher,
you get the whole summer off.

33
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,133
I close the shop
for a couple of months,

34
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,500
I mean,
that's a real break.

35
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:43,166
Then we can
recharge our batteries,

36
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,200
come back here,
try again.

37
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,834
Um...

38
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:51,200
We don't even have to try.

39
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:54,633
You talked about
having a family

40
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,333
since the day we met.

41
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,900
Yeah, 'cause I thought
that's what we both wanted.

42
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:01,033
It was, and...

43
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,200
heaven knows we tried,

44
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,333
but I can't anymore.

45
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm... I'm tired

46
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:09,066
of feeling like a failure
for it.

47
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,066
It...

48
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
I have-- I have to go
and open the shop.

49
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,600
Hey, hey, no. Adriana's there.
There's no need to rush. Just--

50
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,567
Look.

51
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,500
You're not a failure.

52
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,900
Why don't you come over
tonight, okay?

53
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:23,033
We'll talk.

54
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,066
Come to the house,
I'll make dinner.

55
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,367
It's not a break
if we don't take the space.

56
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,967
You should try that too, Ben.

57
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,400
Just take time, please.

58
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:33,900
Just find something
that makes you happy.

59
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,567
Here you go.

60
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,033
They're beautiful. Thanks.

61
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,200
Bye, Emilia!

62
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,400
Ciao.

63
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,967
Okay, I don't care
how busy you look.

64
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,700
Tell me--
how was breakfast?

65
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:57,233
Ah, it's the same, Adriana,
no matter what he claims.

66
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:58,233
Just the same.

67
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:00,300
Oh, he can change.

68
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,500
No. Benedict does not change.

69
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:03,367
The furniture in the living room

70
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,867
hasn't moved an inch
in 25 years.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,667
Well, that never
bothered you before.

72
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,667
Maybe I should have
paid more attention

73
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,133
to what that meant.

74
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,533
One can be happy being single.

75
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:16,867
You are a beautiful proof
of that.

76
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,667
Oh, Pedro may be the reason
I came to Washington,

77
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,533
and why I opened this store,

78
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,467
but he wasn't a good husband.

79
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,033
Now, if the right man
were to come along tomorrow...

80
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,433
Only if he was
the right man for you.

81
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:30,867
Por supuesto.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,033
Why settle?

83
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,667
Even if I can't have a baby,
I can still be happy.

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,533
You know,
happy with what I have,

85
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:39,600
with what I am,

86
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:43,467
'cause life is happening
right here, right now.

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,367
I can't wait.

88
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,834
If Benedict cannot see that,
if he can't get unstuck, then...

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,266
Hey, guys.

90
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,333
-Hey, Ben.
-Hey.

91
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:04,734
Anything biting today?

92
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:06,533
Ah, caught
a couple of rockfish.

93
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,834
I caught a sunburn.

94
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:08,867
-Oh.
-The usual?

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,533
Oh. Always.

96
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:13,333
Steve and Sean work here now?

97
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:15,000
Uh, yeah, if you want
to call it that.

98
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:16,200
It's more like work release
with these two.

99
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,567
Owen, the boys
are on probation?

100
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,767
Yeah.

101
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,400
They're doing time here
until they leave for school.

102
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,233
Their Ma needs the peace
and I need the help.

103
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:24,800
Hey, guys. Knock it off. Go.

104
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,367
So what's the occasion?

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,433
Huh?

106
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,400
All dressed up.

107
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:33,066
Oh. Uh, breakfast with Emilia.

108
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,567
Ah.

109
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,867
I saw your face
when you walked in.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,900
Hmm.

111
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,400
Well, uh...

112
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,667
I don't know
what to say to her.

113
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,900
I don't...

114
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:47,767
We just always come back
to the same thing,

115
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,800
every time.

116
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,100
She's not ready
to try for a baby again.

117
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,700
I get it. You know?

118
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:56,567
All the doctors
and procedures

119
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,100
and hormones

120
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:59,734
and then it doesn't,
you know...

121
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:02,834
Ben, maybe
it's not meant to be.

122
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:06,400
No. She, I mean...

123
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:08,633
she just needs more time.

124
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:10,767
You know?

125
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,033
Yeah.

126
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:23,200
You need to finish
that necklace, Benedict.

127
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:28,166
The joints are messy.

128
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,667
You can clean that up.

129
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,233
The lines of it are beautiful.
It's a good design.

130
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:34,100
You're really talented.

131
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:38,567
Are you sure you can handle
Charlie while we're gone?

132
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,266
Yeah. I've got it, Mom.

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,600
Don't worry so much.

134
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:43,266
Ahh. Here it is.

135
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,800
Look at the veins
in that stone.

136
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,400
It's Madagascar agate.

137
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,667
It's a powerful healer.

138
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,467
Is that where
you and Mom are going?

139
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,567
-Madagascar, right?
-Mm-hmm.

140
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,900
Take me with you, please.

141
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,166
You have school, Charlie.

142
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,767
Come on!
I'm gonna run away.

143
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,600
-I'll help you pack.
-Stop.

144
00:07:56,734 --> 00:08:00,233
Hey! I want to see both of you
right here when we get back.

145
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:01,834
All right,
can you give that to Dad?

146
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:03,633
-Here you go.
-Mom, can you pass me the bowl?

147
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:04,567
Yes.

148
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:11,867
Emilia, you can use your key.

149
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:17,100
Can I help you?

150
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,567
Are you Benedict Stone?

151
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,867
Yeah.

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,367
I'm Gemma.
Your niece.

153
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,066
Gemma?

154
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,066
Charlie's daughter.

155
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,834
Your brother?

156
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,467
He did tell you about me, right?

157
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,567
Uh, your mom sent

158
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,467
a birth announcement
to the store,

159
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,500
-but that was just--
16 years ago.

160
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:40,900
Can I come in?

161
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,600
Sorry. Yeah. Come in.

162
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,000
-You're...

163
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,567
Charlie's daughter.

164
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,667
You're his brother, right?

165
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,333
You're my uncle?

166
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:58,233
Uh, yeah, I guess I am.

167
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,867
So, what...

168
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,467
what are you doing here?
What-- how did you...

169
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,567
I wanted to meet you.

170
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:06,100
So I took a bus and a ferry.

171
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:07,300
From where?

172
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:08,533
New Mexico.

173
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:09,433
Is that where Charlie lives?

174
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:10,467
What--

175
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,800
How did you get here?

176
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:13,533
I just said.

177
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,033
I know, besides the bus.
Did Charlie tell you about me?

178
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,133
My mom did.

179
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,767
She said you and Dad
did not get along.

180
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,100
"Don't bring it up."
So I didn't.

181
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:24,133
-But then I found the bag.
-What bag?

182
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,734
Do you have any juice?

183
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,433
I haven't had anything to drink
since Seattle.

184
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,834
Sure.

185
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:38,734
That's expired coffee creamer.

186
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:40,433
Yeah.
I wasn't expecting anyone.

187
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,467
Yeah, I can see that.

188
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,000
Maybe just some water?

189
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,300
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

190
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:56,433
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

191
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,166
-Um, yeah, sure.

192
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,467
You know what this is?

193
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,800
I found it
in my dad's study last month

194
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,533
and he told me
it was his inheritance

195
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:08,734
from his brother.

196
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,867
And at first, I thought,

197
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,467
"a bunch of rocks?"

198
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,133
But I started looking them up,

199
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:21,266
and they're all
gemstones of some kind.

200
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,433
Not tons-of-money jewels,
but...

201
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,133
you'd put them in jewelry.

202
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,600
But you knew that.

203
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:32,967
I knew Dad
grew up in Washington,

204
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,133
and I found your shop
and your name,

205
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:36,433
and then this address.

206
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,033
So...

207
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,300
what did Charlie say about me,
when you asked to come here?

208
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:41,934
He said

209
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:44,200
he hasn't spoken to you
in years

210
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,967
and you guys were never close,

211
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,266
and I should forget about you.

212
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:50,600
Does my brother

213
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,066
-know you're here?
-Sure.

214
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
All right,
we need to call him.

215
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,033
My purse got stolen
when we stopped in Seattle.

216
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,433
Oh. What's the number?

217
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,800
It's in my phone.
In my purse?

218
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,633
I don't know, like,
actual digits--

219
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:03,667
it's in my phone.

220
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,567
Oh.

221
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,433
Oh! Are you, um, cold?

222
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,800
Do you want me
to make you some tea?

223
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:10,867
You know,
something hot?

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,533
Oh, no. No, I'm beat.

225
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:15,367
Maybe just a towel,
and show me where I can sleep?

226
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,033
Yeah.

227
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,033
Okay, so there isn't really
a guest room.

228
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,533
There's, uh, an office
and then there's

229
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,000
this.

230
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:28,100
Wow.

231
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,367
This'll work.

232
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,533
Did you paint these?

233
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:35,500
No. My wife did.

234
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:37,600
She picked up the hobby
a few years ago.

235
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:38,967
I have an aunt? Awesome.

236
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,700
Can I meet her?

237
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:41,767
She's not home.

238
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,934
Look, you can stay tonight,

239
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:45,767
but, uh, tomorrow,
we've gotta contact your dad.

240
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,467
I texted him from Seattle,
but, yeah, okay, whatever.

241
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,200
Thanks, Uncle B.

242
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,467
That's not my name.

243
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:57,700
Okay.

244
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,300
Rest up.

245
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,567
Angel Aura Quartz.

246
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,667
Connection.

247
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,000
Positivity.

248
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:12,600
Joy.

249
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,700
Hey, Uncle B?

250
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:24,433
Your wife is beautiful.

251
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,834
Oh. I didn't even know
you were up.

252
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:29,533
Is this you and my dad?

253
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,233
Yup.

254
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:32,500
And who are these people?

255
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:36,266
That's Emilia and her family.
They live in Buenos Aires.

256
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:38,333
Yeah.

257
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,333
Ohh... these are Aunt Emilia.

258
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:42,433
Totally.

259
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:45,400
And all this...

260
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,000
is yours.

261
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,867
Well, this was my father's,
and, uh...

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,333
yeah, it's mine now.

263
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,734
All their stuff is here.

264
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:56,567
If Charlie wanted
any of it, okay,

265
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
he could have had anything.

266
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:01,133
He's good for furniture.
Thanks.

267
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:02,834
I've been looking it up.

268
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:04,100
and there are eight
"Charles Stones"

269
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:05,133
in the New Mexico area--

270
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:07,333
but none of them the right age.

271
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,600
Oh, well, we live
off the grid, actually.

272
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:11,500
-Where?
-It's a ranch.

273
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:13,300
Honestly, GPS doesn't even
get it right.

274
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:17,934
My dad knows where I am.
What's the problem?

275
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:20,467
Well, this isn't... normal.

276
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,433
Well, what did "normal"
ever get anyone?

277
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:23,900
It's an adventure!

278
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:25,667
Yeah, but you need--

279
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,433
I need food.
I need breakfast.

280
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:29,500
I didn't eat at all yesterday.

281
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:31,233
All right,
I can make you breakfast.

282
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:32,467
No, I've seen your fridge--

283
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,667
no offense.

284
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,900
Is there somewhere we can go?

285
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:37,734
My treat!

286
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:40,633
I'll pay you back,
or I can work at the shop.

287
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,133
Or both.

288
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:46,767
Uh, don't worry,
I-- I'll get you breakfast.

289
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:49,633
So, what about your mother?

290
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:52,066
-Uh, she's gone.
-Gone?

291
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,800
Hey, Ben!

292
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,166
This is my niece!
She's visiting.

293
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,734
-Hi!
-Hi.

294
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:00,367
Wait. Why aren't we stopping?
Am I embarrassing?

295
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,667
No. I've got to get
to the shop.

296
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,734
Wait. Wait, please?

297
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,533
Please, can
we go check out the pier?

298
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:07,567
I've never seen
the ocean before,

299
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,133
and it was too dark last night
to even see.

300
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
Ple-e-e-ease?

301
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:14,467
Sure.

302
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,734
Gemma, slow down.

303
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:18,400
What do you mean,
your mom's "gone"?

304
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:20,200
Whoo!

305
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,734
I'm the queen of the world!

306
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:25,567
Whoo!

307
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,600
Whoo-oo!

308
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:36,800
You make the jewelry?
You're an artist!

309
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:39,400
No. It's a... craft.

310
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:41,467
Hi, cutie.

311
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,467
Don't touch him, he's feral.

312
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,633
Oh! But he's so cu-u-ute.

313
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:45,734
Been here for days.

314
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,700
Anyways, I looked up

315
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:54,567
a bunch of the stones
from my bag,

316
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,500
and did you know every stone
has a meaning?

317
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:58,300
Well, of course, you do,

318
00:14:58,433 --> 00:14:59,467
because you have to pick out
the right ones

319
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,400
for your jewelry,

320
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,600
but I thought it was amazing.

321
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:05,800
Hey, that woman looks
like your wife.

322
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:07,700
Good eyesight.

323
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,200
20/10 vision,
even at night.

324
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,033
So what's the deal?

325
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,633
-Excuse me?
-With your wife?

326
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:14,734
Why wasn't she
at your house last night?

327
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:16,600
She likes to hang out
with her cousin, you know.

328
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:18,133
She's an elementary school
teacher,

329
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:19,900
and helps at the flower shop
during the summer.

330
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:21,066
So I'll see her tonight?

331
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,467
We should go over
and introduce me--

332
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,133
No! We're...
We're on a break.

333
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:26,200
She left you.

334
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,533
How long
have you been married?

335
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,367
-Ten years next month.
-Then how'd you meet?

336
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,467
Gemma, I got
a lot of work to do today.

337
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,967
Do you have plans?
Stuff to do?

338
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,033
How'd you meet?

339
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,033
Can we just take a minute,
catch our breath--

340
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,900
Oh, come on, Uncle B.

341
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,266
It was a hike.

342
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,467
There was a club with an ad
in the back of the paper--

343
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,233
anyone who was interested
in hiking Green Falls Trail.

344
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:50,066
Wow. I can see it now.

345
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,900
A steep, dangerous climb...

346
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:56,233
with a great view--
it had to be!

347
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:58,767
And only the two of you
showed up.

348
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,834
No, there was
a bunch of people.

349
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:03,333
But you spotted her
and... what?

350
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:06,133
Oh, come on!

351
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,900
Was it "hi," "hi,"
"what do you do," blah, blah?

352
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,767
"Shoulder."

353
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,467
That's your big opening?

354
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,200
I was hiking

355
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,967
and I heard a voice behind me
say, "Shoulder."

356
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,800
So, I stopped, turned around,

357
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:24,100
and it was Emilia.

358
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,033
She had a rock in her shoe,

359
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,100
so she leaned on my shoulder
and took off her shoe,

360
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,333
and shook it out.

361
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:32,967
Then you looked in her eyes

362
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,300
and she looked in yours,

363
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:35,934
and that was it?

364
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,200
No, wait!
You definitely

365
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,600
put her slipper back on
for her, right?

366
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:40,133
It was a running shoe.

367
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:41,533
Okay, but you slipped it
back on,

368
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,967
you looked in her eyes,
and you said...?

369
00:16:46,934 --> 00:16:48,266
I don't remember.

370
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,367
You were speechless.

371
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,433
Okay.

372
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:51,800
You had to be.

373
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:54,700
I mean,
the power of that moment.

374
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,300
So what're you gonna do?

375
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,300
Excuse me?

376
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,600
To win her back!

377
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,266
She left you,

378
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,834
but you want her back--
how're you gonna woo her?

379
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:03,600
"Woo"?

380
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:06,367
Oh! You are so lucky
that I am here.

381
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,367
This is a mission.

382
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,734
-Oh, no.
-Oh... yes.

383
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:12,233
"W.E.B."
"Win Emilia Back."

384
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:13,600
We're gonna get you in shape,

385
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:15,600
you're gonna be
a boyfriend again.

386
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,767
You need romance
and big gestures!

387
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,700
We're gonna remind Emilia
why she fell in love with you.

388
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:23,300
She will be back!

389
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:25,934
We should make notes.

390
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:27,367
Are you cold?

391
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
You're shivering.

392
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:30,667
Yeah. This is summer?

393
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,433
Welcome to Washington.

394
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:35,000
Here. Go buy yourself
some warm clothes.

395
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:36,166
You can't have much
in that little backpack.

396
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,200
You're gonna need some things.

397
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,767
Seriously? Thanks.

398
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,400
Um, before you go,

399
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:42,700
does Charlie have an email?

400
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:44,200
-Do you remember that?
-Um, yeah.

401
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,600
It's "CS...

402
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:47,734
88001

403
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,367
@SW.Net."

404
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,700
It's our zip code.

405
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:55,934
I'll get us something low-fat
and healthy for lunch.

406
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,633
Tiger's Eye.

407
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:34,700
Protection.

408
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:36,333
Making Contact.

409
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:38,533
New Changes.

410
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:50,533
All the prices are marked,

411
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,000
except for
the consignment pieces.

412
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,033
Thanks.

413
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:07,100
They're from
the set of a movie.

414
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:08,066
They just arrived.

415
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,567
Can I put these here
while I look?

416
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,433
Yeah, sure.

417
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,200
That is for the town's
end-of-summer block party.

418
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,767
It's really fun,
if you're around.

419
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,333
I plan to be.

420
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:19,333
I'm Maggie, by the way.

421
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:20,767
Gemma.

422
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:26,500
-Hi.
-Hi.

423
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:29,266
Um, I'd love
to come by the house today

424
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,433
to pick up some canvases
from my studio.

425
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:34,066
Oh, yeah.
You want them for your show?

426
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,934
Yeah, I got the flyer.
Congratulations.

427
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:39,333
Yeah.
Um, I may need some of them.

428
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:42,166
I'm still making decisions.

429
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,000
A-About the show.

430
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:44,900
Right.

431
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:46,033
Okay.

432
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:49,166
Um, uh... uh...

433
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,667
That's very exciting--

434
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,834
first time out,
solo show.

435
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:57,867
I guess Lawrence
has big plans for me.

436
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,100
I don't know.

437
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,233
Um, when is it
a good time to come by?

438
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:04,834
Uh... those canvasses
are heavy.

439
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:05,934
I can manage.

440
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:08,367
No, no. I'll bring them
by Adriana's tonight.

441
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,367
Um, I'm not staying there.

442
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
I'm at Veronica's.

443
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:13,533
She's in the city,
so I'm staying at the apartment.

444
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,600
Oh, okay. Great.

445
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,333
I can bring them--

446
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,033
I can bring them there.

447
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,100
-Okay.
-Okay. See you.

448
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:23,467
Ciao.

449
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,433
Super-awkward!

450
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:31,633
Sorry.

451
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:33,066
It just wasn't the right time
to introduce you two.

452
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,100
Yeah, I got that by the look.

453
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,233
Well, I got pretty much
everything I need

454
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,400
at the secondhand store.

455
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:39,934
-Mm-hmm?
-There's your change.

456
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,400
Who's Lawrence?

457
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:42,667
He's the gallery owner.

458
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,033
What's this?

459
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,433
Lunch. For "W.E.B."

460
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:49,100
We might need you to recreate
your hike, when you met,

461
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:50,233
or something,

462
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:52,033
but we need you
in tip-top shape.

463
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,433
Never get the "sale" salad.

464
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,000
This one's turquoise, right?

465
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:05,066
Only it's raw?

466
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,600
Looks like it.

467
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:08,333
We have a lot of it back home.

468
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,567
Turquoise promotes healing
and communication

469
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,633
and...

470
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,867
Can I use your computer
and look it up?

471
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,567
I have a better idea.

472
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:29,567
Wait.

473
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,500
This is a treasure chest.
Are we rich?

474
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,734
Depends on what
you count as rich.

475
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:37,734
All right.

476
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:38,700
Let's see here.

477
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,100
-That's you and Dad?
-Yeah.

478
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:48,333
Why do you look like that?

479
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:51,133
Well, it was right after
your grandparents' funeral.

480
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,734
Dad said they drowned together.

481
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:57,133
Yeah, they were overseas,
uh, buying gemstones.

482
00:21:57,266 --> 00:22:00,266
I was here,
babysitting your dad.

483
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,800
And there was a tsunami.

484
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:05,367
It took everyone by surprise.

485
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,967
When I didn't hear from my mom,
I just knew...

486
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,133
and the next morning,
I got the call.

487
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:13,266
Their stuff arrived
three weeks later.

488
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,400
Here. Go ahead.
Take it out.

489
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,967
What did your dad tell you
about his family?

490
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,700
Um...

491
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:30,200
that his parents were magical

492
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,834
and died tragically.

493
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,100
That was true.

494
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,800
He said he was an orphan.

495
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:37,567
We were.

496
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,734
You stayed here?

497
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:41,567
In this house?

498
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,900
Yeah, I was 18, so...

499
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:47,200
I raised Charlie.

500
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:52,633
Thank you.

501
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:54,567
I did the best I could.

502
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,367
I don't understand.

503
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,100
You raised my dad
and we couldn't ever visit you?

504
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,200
If, uh, you want what
we're looking for,

505
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,333
it's gonna be over here.

506
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:17,400
Did my grandmother make these?

507
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:19,233
Your grandmother?

508
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:21,567
Uh, no,
she was better than that.

509
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,200
Those are some practice pieces
that I was working on.

510
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,567
I don't even know
what they're doing in there.

511
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,233
Because they're awesome!

512
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:28,200
No! They're really flawed.

513
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,934
These are way more interesting

514
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:32,100
than all the stuff
in the shop now.

515
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:33,467
Gee, thanks.

516
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,767
There we go.

517
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,633
All right. Here.

518
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,600
My dad started
this gemstone book

519
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:45,834
when he was younger.

520
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,400
Wow.

521
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:58,467
There's a lot
of blank pages here.

522
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,166
If I stay longer,
I can fill them in for you.

523
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,166
Look up the stones,
like he did.

524
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,533
"Peridot--

525
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:08,700
rich green stone,
sometimes called Chrysolite.

526
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:09,934
It can lessen stress,

527
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:13,133
and help us find
what is lost..."

528
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:16,133
You so need some peridot,
Uncle B!

529
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:19,066
Maybe!

530
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,166
Oh...

531
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,033
What are the holes for?

532
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,867
Uh...

533
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,633
I told Emilia
I'd bring those paintings over.

534
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:30,133
You keep that.

535
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:36,266
I meant to ask
about the weapon earlier.

536
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,200
Deserted Dog
had props from some movie.

537
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,300
Whoa.

538
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:40,967
I got it cheap.

539
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,333
Don't worry.
Check it.

540
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:46,667
It's surprisingly solid, right?

541
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
You need to make
a statement to Emilia.

542
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:50,734
Yeah, I'm gonna bring
the canvases over to her.

543
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:54,300
That's like... an errand!

544
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:56,367
Like she sent you to the store.

545
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,133
And, okay,
that's a husband thing,

546
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:00,400
but you need to be
her boyfriend again.

547
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,200
I'm not really sure what the--

548
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,533
Her boyfriend!

549
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,033
The man who will fight for her,

550
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,333
if need be.

551
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:07,567
Yeah, well, I mean,

552
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,700
I can see where, you know,

553
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,400
some of that would be...

554
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,600
Okay, yeah,

555
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:14,066
but I'm not sure
this is the message!

556
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,500
Because it's silly?

557
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:16,767
Well, for starters, yeah!

558
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,600
Unpredictable?

559
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,767
A big gesture?

560
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,066
Why not?

561
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,767
I mean, look--
Emilia is a few pillows

562
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,233
and a couple throw rugs away
from out of here.

563
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,066
What have you got to lose,
Uncle B?

564
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,934
This apartment...

565
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:37,266
is there a balcony?

566
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,533
Uh... yeah.

567
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,767
Then it's perfect!

568
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,266
You're there to fight for her,
like Romeo!

569
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,000
Mm.

570
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:47,233
None of that ended well,
if I remember correctly.

571
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:48,300
It didn't?

572
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:56,066
You know,
we should go to Argentina.

573
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,000
What?

574
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:58,867
I want to see everything
that molded you.

575
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,934
All the influences.

576
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,600
Did you paint there?

577
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:04,433
-I actually started here.
-Mm.

578
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:06,667
It's a bit chilly.

579
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,834
Hmm.

580
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,867
-Uh, do you want to--?
-Yeah.

581
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:17,133
Hi.

582
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:22,767
Ahh.

583
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:27,900
Dinner tomorrow?

584
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,266
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.

585
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:34,066
How about if I promise
it's only work?

586
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,300
Would that be true?

587
00:26:35,433 --> 00:26:36,500
Eh...

588
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:40,233
I'll be sorting the art
in the gallery next week.

589
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:42,734
We can go over things then.

590
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,000
Sure.

591
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:46,300
-Great.
-Good day.

592
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:54,166
-Ben?
-As promised.

593
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,600
Hope I'm not too late.

594
00:26:55,734 --> 00:26:57,967
I--
Is that a sword?

595
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,934
Yeah!

596
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:01,734
Were you expecting pirates
on the way?

597
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:03,000
Oh, you never know.

598
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:08,033
Uh, no, actually, uh,
Gemma gave it to me.

599
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,667
-Gemma?
-Yeah. The girl

600
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,333
who came in the shop earlier,
when you were there.

601
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:14,667
Um...
she's Charlie's daughter.

602
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,300
-That's incredible!
-Mm-hmm.

603
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:17,867
You heard from Charlie?

604
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,300
No. She just showed up
last night out of nowhere,

605
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:21,400
unexpectedly.

606
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,300
What did Charlie say?

607
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,133
I couldn't call--
she doesn't have his number,

608
00:27:25,266 --> 00:27:26,967
and her phone and bag
were stolen on her trip.

609
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,867
Ben, this girl
could be anyone.

610
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,166
She looks exactly like him.

611
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:32,567
She's Charlie's kid.

612
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,133
Ben, this is huge.

613
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:36,800
Yeah, she is something.

614
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:38,233
I'd love to meet her.

615
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,367
-Yeah. Can we do that soon?
-Please.

616
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,000
The last of your summer roses.

617
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:47,700
Thank you.

618
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,400
[Gemma narrat.

619
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:01,600
Initiating.

620
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:02,834
Life force.

621
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:04,934
Self-confidence.

622
00:28:13,533 --> 00:28:15,300
There were muffins
on this plate last night!

623
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:16,734
-No starchy carbs

624
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:17,900
until day eight.

625
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:19,000
This feels like day--

626
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:20,100
Five.

627
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:22,166
Three more days
and you can have a cheat day.

628
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,266
You're doing great.

629
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:30,000
Mm.

630
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,100
Hey, guys!

631
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:35,900
Hi, Harry. Hi, Owen.

632
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:37,166
Hey, hey.

633
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,300
Anything biting?

634
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:39,967
Mosquitoes.

635
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,100
How's your day, Gemma?

636
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:42,433
Going good.

637
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:44,600
Started
with a healthy breakfast,

638
00:28:44,734 --> 00:28:47,567
followed by
a 15-minute cardio blast.

639
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,734
I blasted.

640
00:28:49,867 --> 00:28:51,500
-Oh, it shows.

641
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:53,133
Yeah.

642
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:24,300
Oh, hi, Maggie.

643
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:26,133
Hey, Gemma.
This is Tony.

644
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:27,200
S'up?

645
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,967
We're here looking
for an engagement ring.

646
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,233
Congratulations!

647
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:37,800
Okay, well, we have
some, you know, old, standard--

648
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:39,233
"classic" rings...

649
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:43,533
...but my Uncle B can design
something just for you--

650
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:46,500
one of a kind,
with any stone you want.

651
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:47,633
Wow!

652
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:48,734
We just want
a little diamond.

653
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:53,233
That's cute.

654
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:54,834
Oh... yeah.

655
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:57,233
Tony proposed to me
at a party

656
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:59,200
and it was all we had.

657
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,000
It's actually gonna be hard
to let it go.

658
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,233
Well... I have an idea.

659
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:06,467
This... is aquamarine,

660
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,834
and you would love it

661
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:09,500
because it promotes openness

662
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:12,500
and communication
and imagination,

663
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:14,233
and my Uncle B can design

664
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:15,734
something like your ring,
but put that in--

665
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:16,867
Can we just be normal?

666
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,066
What about these?

667
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,567
Can you just look at this
before you decide?

668
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,066
You telling me you're not
gonna show them to me?

669
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:31,066
Um, honey, you know what?
Why don't we do this later?

670
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
I've got to get back.

671
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,900
Thank you so much, Gemma.

672
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,867
Come on.

673
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,967
Ugh! That wedding is doomed!

674
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,033
She needs
to ditch that guy.

675
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,633
Uh, we sell the client
what they want, all right?

676
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,667
Do you know how much I clear
on an engagement ring?

677
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
And they're already made.

678
00:30:46,934 --> 00:30:48,400
But it wasn't right!

679
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:50,800
You didn't see her face.
She loved this idea.

680
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:51,834
But she didn't buy it,
did she?

681
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:53,667
Okay, but people browse!

682
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,967
I'm just trying to help.
But whatever!

683
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,233
I need air.

684
00:30:57,367 --> 00:30:58,667
Wait!

685
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,633
Oh. Sorry. Oh...

686
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:01,934
-Hey.
-Emilia.

687
00:31:02,066 --> 00:31:04,100
Okay, now I'm really sorry.

688
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:05,934
Gemma, I was just coming
to meet you.

689
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:07,734
Ben is so happy you're here.

690
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,567
Well, not today.

691
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,533
He can be so,
"This is how it is."

692
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:12,600
Yes, he can.

693
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,967
But, you know he's...

694
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,033
such a great guy,
when he's not...

695
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:18,967
you know.

696
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,066
I do.

697
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,367
Do you think you need
a little break this week?

698
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,700
That'd be great.

699
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:27,066
But, um, look,
it can be all three of us.

700
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,367
We're not speaking
till after lunch.

701
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,266
Be ready for the hike.

702
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,900
-See you soon?
-See you.

703
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:35,200
That's Gemma.

704
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,700
She just got so mad.
I don't know why.

705
00:31:36,834 --> 00:31:38,567
She can turn on a dime.

706
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,533
-She's like...
-A teenager?

707
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:42,734
Yeah.

708
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:46,100
Have you heard from Charlie?

709
00:31:46,233 --> 00:31:47,734
No answer.

710
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:49,033
She says her mom's "gone."

711
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,600
No explanation.

712
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:53,033
Something's not right here.
You know that.

713
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,166
I know, but I don't know
what to do about it yet.

714
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,834
Are you two free
on Thursday?

715
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:00,667
We can be.

716
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:11,333
Hey, what are you
doing in here?

717
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:13,133
Get off of there.
Come on. Get, get, get.

718
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:15,233
Little guy.

719
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
So...

720
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:38,033
Thursday,
what do you want to do?

721
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:41,133
Uh, the three of us?
I don't know.

722
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:43,467
Something different,
like...

723
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,133
I've never had lobster before.

724
00:32:45,266 --> 00:32:46,367
Oh, good! Yeah. Lobster.

725
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:49,333
Hey, you know,
Charlie loved lobster.

726
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,800
When he was little,
he'd, uh...

727
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:53,834
eat it in a big bowl of butter.

728
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:55,633
Must be hard to find
out in the desert.

729
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,700
Uh, maybe in
a casino dining hall,

730
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:01,166
but that's definitely
not fresh.

731
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,900
Yeah.

732
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:04,667
So Charlie goes to casinos?

733
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,333
Around us,
they have the best restaurants.

734
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:09,567
Let's ride bikes, too.

735
00:33:10,867 --> 00:33:12,767
Why not?

736
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:15,767
I'm really glad
you're here, Gemma.

737
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,934
So am I.

738
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:18,900
You're doing great.

739
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:21,066
That was easier
than yesterday, right?

740
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,533
Yeah.

741
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,600
The air here...

742
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:26,867
the water,

743
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,266
and all the birds!

744
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,934
I love it!

745
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,834
-What?
-Come on!

746
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:38,333
Let's see some moves...

747
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:39,834
or it's more jumping jacks.

748
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:42,700
Come on, Uncle B!
Come on.

749
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:44,233
I don't really...

750
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:45,266
Yeah-yeah-yeah! You got it!

751
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,200
Yeah-yeah-yeah!
You got it!

752
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,000
You got it! You got it!
You got it!

753
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:48,533
-No, I'm gonna do this.
-No!

754
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:49,600
-No!
-Yeah.

755
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:51,367
-I'm gonna switch to this.
-What?

756
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:56,400
So, I was thinking,
for the show--

757
00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:57,567
we get the same flower,
the same plant,

758
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,900
for as many paintings
as we can.

759
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:01,433
I love it.
What did Lawrence say?

760
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:02,800
If you love it,
he'll love it.

761
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:05,300
I see the looks he gives you.

762
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:07,834
Adriana--

763
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:09,166
I'm not blind.

764
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,734
If you threw a stick,
he would fetch it.

765
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:13,400
I'm still married

766
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:15,100
and you love Benedict.

767
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:16,900
I do, but I am your team--

768
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:18,667
whoever makes you happy.

769
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,734
I think these are ready
to go into a pot.

770
00:34:21,867 --> 00:34:24,400
That's why you make
the best malfatti in the family.

771
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:25,467
You're patient.

772
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,567
You're gonna
teach Marcos for me.

773
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,133
That's your job.

774
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:31,400
Oh, you raised him
just as much as I did.

775
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:34,300
I was so busy opening the shop,
and Pedro was gone--

776
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:35,834
you were the one
taking care of him.

777
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

778
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:42,567
That didn't help.

779
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,734
You know, I'm...

780
00:34:43,867 --> 00:34:47,133
I'm fine. Really. I am.

781
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,100
Sometimes, it just
sneaks up on me, that's all.

782
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:53,133
Come here.

783
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:56,100
That couch,

784
00:34:56,233 --> 00:34:57,467
this shoulder...

785
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,633
yours,
whenever you need.

786
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:02,300
I want you know
how grateful I am

787
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,033
that you let me tag along
with you and Pedro moved here.

788
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,533
Tag along?
Are you kidding?

789
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:08,667
My husband was dragging me
to Washington

790
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,400
and I was gonna face winter
on my own?

791
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:11,900
No, thank you.

792
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:13,033
It was an adventure.

793
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:16,800
Well, whatever happens,
it still is an adventure.

794
00:35:16,934 --> 00:35:18,800
It sure is.

795
00:35:18,934 --> 00:35:20,233
Salud.

796
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:21,367
-Salud.

797
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,633
That's what I was saying.
We know each other, right?

798
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:32,500
Hey. Check the cooler.
We need more limes.

799
00:35:34,767 --> 00:35:36,000
Sean, limes.

800
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:37,000
-You get 'em.
-No, you get 'em!

801
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:38,066
Knock it off.

802
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,734
-Steve. Limes.
-Yeah.

803
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:41,500
You're a brave man
for hiring your sons.

804
00:35:41,633 --> 00:35:43,567
Oh! What was I thinking?

805
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,400
Cola with lime,

806
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:47,700
and we're getting more limes,
fresh.

807
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:48,867
Thanks.

808
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,800
All right, all right.
We're-- We're fresh enough.

809
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:53,500
-Thanks.
-Anyway, anyway.

810
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:55,300
back to what I was saying--

811
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:57,033
Diane, it's like she knows
what I'm gonna say--

812
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,200
-Before you say it.
-...Before I even say it.

813
00:35:58,333 --> 00:35:59,567
Yeah, well, she can depend
on you--

814
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,667
that's what counts.

815
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,533
Yeah, well, I mean,
her birthday's coming up

816
00:36:02,667 --> 00:36:05,266
and I want to get her
something special,

817
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,233
you know, something
she won't expect.

818
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:07,800
What, like a surprise?

819
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:10,767
Don't say it like that.
It's totally romantic.

820
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,200
And Uncle B
can design it for you!

821
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,867
-You can?
-I can?

822
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,300
You can.

823
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:16,433
Okay.

824
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:18,533
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

825
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:23,100
Um, yeah, so, Diane--
I'm thinking, um... a bracelet?

826
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:26,300
Trust us to pick out the stone?
I can look it up.

827
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:27,266
You can do it?

828
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,300
Her birthday's in 10 days.

829
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:30,367
Yeah. We'll use her birthstone.

830
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,600
-Yeah.
-All right.

831
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:33,967
Hey, can we get the check?
We have a big day tomorrow.

832
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,033
That's right!
"W.E.B." in action.

833
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:37,400
Does that mean you'll be
wearing your good flannel?

834
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:39,100
You know it.

835
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:40,900
No! No, no, no, no.
"Good flannel"?

836
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,967
Those two words
don't go together.

837
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,633
-No, I can pull it off.

838
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,600
This one brings out his eyes.

839
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,467
Kunzite.

840
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,633
Love.

841
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:54,967
Mood lifting.

842
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,467
Frees emotions.

843
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,333
Okay, that's huge.

844
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:08,667
You guys'll help me, right?

845
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,500
I'll help you
with the leftovers.

846
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:12,700
Mom had a shellfish allergy,

847
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:14,800
so I could never even
try lobster.

848
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:15,934
Is your mom
from New Mexico?

849
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:16,800
She was.

850
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,166
Where is she now?

851
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,533
Who knows?
She and her Trevor travel a lot.

852
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:22,033
"Her Trevor"?

853
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:23,600
It's what Mom calls
her new husband.

854
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:24,767
"Her Trevor".

855
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,266
He does something with money.

856
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,800
That's exciting.
You can see new places.

857
00:37:28,934 --> 00:37:30,200
-Mm!
-Like I'm invited?

858
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:33,333
They'd seriously
be no fun anyway.

859
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:34,633
Do you ever see her?

860
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:35,834
Once a year,
and that's plenty.

861
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,000
Did you see a ladies' room?

862
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,367
Yeah, right over there.

863
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,333
I'll be right back.

864
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:45,567
Please change the subject.

865
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,633
Thank you.

866
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,767
It's not a chore.
She's a sweet girl.

867
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,000
No, I know, but I can't get her
to open up like that.

868
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:54,767
She never wants
to talk about family.

869
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,767
It's so strange that Charlie
hasn't answered you.

870
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,700
What happened
between the two of you?

871
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:01,900
You said you had a fight
and he left,

872
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:03,900
but that cannot be all.

873
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:05,767
I never understood.

874
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,333
Neither did I.

875
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:10,000
I know you don't
like to talk about it.

876
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:11,667
It wasn't good,

877
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,033
and I can't be
the only one to fix it, so...

878
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:17,300
People gotta give you
a chance.

879
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,400
Can I help you find something?

880
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:21,767
No.

881
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,066
Spying.

882
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,500
Those two
are hopelessly in love.

883
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:27,567
Or just hopeless.

884
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,000
One of the two--
I can't tell yet.

885
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:30,467
Okay.

886
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,667
This is a good model.

887
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,233
No, that's too flawed.

888
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:03,467
No, it isn't.

889
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,233
Yeah, it is,
I made it as a kid.

890
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:07,500
Look, look at this line,
and these melds...

891
00:39:07,633 --> 00:39:10,133
It could be straighter,
but not better.

892
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:16,000
Hey, Reggie can be kind of
argumentative, he's a lawyer.

893
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:17,800
-I'll take him.
-No, it's okay, I got it.

894
00:39:17,934 --> 00:39:18,900
No, he can be really tough.

895
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:21,233
No, it's really okay.

896
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:23,166
Hi!

897
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,834
Can I help you?

898
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,100
Those earrings.

899
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:27,934
-For your wife?
-My daughter.

900
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,333
How old's your daughter?

901
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,900
-Excuse me?
-Hey, Reggie.

902
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:32,567
What can we do for you today?

903
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,633
Lisa's going away to college.

904
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:36,300
I want some nice earrings.

905
00:39:36,433 --> 00:39:38,266
-Your best.
-Okay.

906
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,867
Right here.

907
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:42,133
Some of these are good.

908
00:39:42,266 --> 00:39:43,100
The best ones aren't here.

909
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:46,834
Uncle B has to make them
just for your daughter.

910
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:47,900
A unique design.

911
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:48,934
Really?

912
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:51,800
That's what you do?

913
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:53,433
Uh, yeah.
That's what I do.

914
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:54,600
I want custom-made.

915
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:57,400
Okay.

916
00:39:57,533 --> 00:39:59,834
Personally, I really love

917
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:02,433
how Uncle B combines
different stones.

918
00:40:05,133 --> 00:40:07,133
I think
she'd really like those.

919
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:09,800
Well, these stones
in particular

920
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:12,633
bring peacefulness
and healing...

921
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:14,834
and calmness,
and soothe emotions...

922
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,900
Well, if those stones
can do all that,

923
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:19,300
I'll pay top dollar.

924
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:22,100
So, this is a rough sketch,
but...

925
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,400
It's good.
It's different.

926
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:27,266
Different's good.

927
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:30,800
I'll take 'em.

928
00:40:34,233 --> 00:40:35,433
I'll write you up.

929
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,433
Lisa would never believe it,

930
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:44,333
but she means the world to me.

931
00:40:44,467 --> 00:40:45,567
Then tell her!

932
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,066
Make her believe it.

933
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,333
She's your kid!

934
00:40:49,934 --> 00:40:51,133
Gemma.

935
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:54,934
Excuse me.

936
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,867
Sorry about that.

937
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:03,333
Teen girls.

938
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:29,667
I have something for you.

939
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,166
Follow me.

940
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,967
What is that sound?

941
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,033
Seagulls.

942
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:38,066
Okay, you say seagulls--

943
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
there's no way
that sound is birds.

944
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:41,834
Just wait.

945
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,700
When our parents brought stones
back from their travels,

946
00:41:55,834 --> 00:41:58,867
some were too flawed
to work with or sell,

947
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,700
but Mom loved flawed things.

948
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:01,934
You remind me of her.

949
00:42:03,033 --> 00:42:05,633
And she believed everything
had its perfect place,

950
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:07,900
so this became ours.

951
00:42:08,033 --> 00:42:11,467
After every trip,
we'd come out here

952
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,300
and hang all
the imperfect stones together.

953
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:19,867
This is
our real family tree, Gemma.

954
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,266
And you might be

955
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,700
the only Stone left
to carry on that tradition,

956
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,934
which makes you

957
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:29,900
the most important thing
in the world to us.

958
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,400
This is Kyanite.

959
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:34,367
It's for new beginnings.

960
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,300
Here. Find your spot.

961
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,600
Welcome home.

962
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:45,433
Poppy Jasper.

963
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:46,567
Enthusiasm.

964
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,734
Enjoyment.

965
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:49,767
Fresh energy.

966
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,800
It's only been two weeks,

967
00:43:50,934 --> 00:43:54,000
but no sugar,
daily cardio,

968
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:55,333
and some hiking,

969
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:57,233
and look at you.

970
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:58,400
I feel...

971
00:43:58,533 --> 00:43:59,667
Better?

972
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,233
"Thank you, Gemma.
You're a great coach."

973
00:44:02,367 --> 00:44:03,900
Yes, and thank you.

974
00:44:04,033 --> 00:44:05,967
-Oh, your dad emailed me back.
-Oh, yeah?

975
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,867
He didn't have much to say,
like when school starts or--

976
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,367
Oh, I still have
a few weeks, relax.

977
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,133
We'll figure it out,

978
00:44:13,266 --> 00:44:15,700
but can't we just decide
to be happy for a while?

979
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,900
Yeah. We can.

980
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,667
We only have one week
until Emilia's big opening,

981
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,233
so what're you gonna wear?

982
00:44:25,367 --> 00:44:26,300
Well, I don't know.

983
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:27,667
What, like a tuxedo?

984
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,633
I mean, that--

985
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,734
Mm. Not the vibe.

986
00:44:30,867 --> 00:44:32,133
Hey, Harry!

987
00:44:32,266 --> 00:44:33,333
Hey.

988
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:37,800
Hey, wait, what if I rode up
on a big white stallion

989
00:44:37,934 --> 00:44:39,967
and swept Emilia off her feet?

990
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,133
-It's kinda old-school.
-Yeah, but it's a classic.

991
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,533
Hey! Hi, Gemma.

992
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:44,667
Hi, Harry.

993
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,700
Hey, can I rent this horse
for something next week?

994
00:44:46,834 --> 00:44:49,567
Bingo?
Well, I don't see why not.

995
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,500
Ah! All right.
I'll call you with details.

996
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:53,400
-All right.
-All right.

997
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:55,133
I didn't know
Uncle B could ride.

998
00:44:55,266 --> 00:44:56,500
Yeah, I wasn't sure
that he could, either.

999
00:44:56,633 --> 00:44:59,200
Hey, Uncle B?

1000
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:00,433
Mm-hmm?

1001
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:02,367
Can you ride a horse?

1002
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,633
Well, I'm not gonna be,

1003
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,433
like, jumping any fences
or anything.

1004
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:07,400
You know?
I'll, like, watch a video.

1005
00:45:07,533 --> 00:45:09,567
Mm.

1006
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,567
I got a better idea.

1007
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,266
You sure
you know what you're doing?

1008
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,867
How hard can it be?

1009
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,900
Hey, it's your first ride,
in a long time,

1010
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:18,600
so go slow.

1011
00:45:18,734 --> 00:45:20,133
It's better
for the horse's back anyway.

1012
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,734
Hello! I grew up on a ranch.
Okay.

1013
00:45:23,867 --> 00:45:25,633
Let foot goes in that stirrup,

1014
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:27,700
and your right leg,
swing it over,

1015
00:45:27,834 --> 00:45:29,767
but not too hard.

1016
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,433
-Oh! Yeah.
-Okay. I got it.

1017
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:32,700
Well, that would be
"too hard."

1018
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:34,567
-Got it.

1019
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,867
Okay, now remember--
separate the reins, thumbs up.

1020
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,533
heels down--
like that.

1021
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:41,700
When do I pull the reins?

1022
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:44,467
Okay, your legs
are what move the horse

1023
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,266
and then the reins
help steer the horse.

1024
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,233
So squeeze your legs
against him,

1025
00:45:48,367 --> 00:45:50,400
-but not too hard--
-Oh, here we go.

1026
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:53,734
I think I squeezed him
too hard.

1027
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:54,800
He looks scared.

1028
00:45:54,934 --> 00:45:56,066
Don't worry.

1029
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,066
Uncle B will be fine.

1030
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,300
No, I meant Bingo.

1031
00:45:58,433 --> 00:45:59,467
-Oh!

1032
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,600
It's good, right?

1033
00:46:01,734 --> 00:46:03,266
-Yeah--
-Where is he going?

1034
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,333
-Yeah, you got it, Uncle B!
-Whoo!

1035
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:08,033
-Hey! This is easy!
-Yeah!

1036
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,867
Heels down!

1037
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,400
There you go!

1038
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:17,500
Way to go, Uncle B.

1039
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:18,767
I think I need some chaps.

1040
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,500
-No.

1041
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:31,934
Hi.

1042
00:46:32,066 --> 00:46:33,200
Mind if I browse?

1043
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:34,500
Sure.

1044
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:37,567
Who's that?

1045
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,166
A stray.

1046
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,467
With a cat carrier and toys?

1047
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,467
Well...

1048
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,767
it-- it's now "Kimberly".

1049
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,934
"Kimberly".

1050
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:49,800
Uh, Gemma bonded with it.

1051
00:46:49,934 --> 00:46:52,000
I said "yes" to the store,
but a hard "no" to the house.

1052
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:54,533
Oh, you pick your battles.

1053
00:46:54,667 --> 00:46:55,934
You got to.

1054
00:46:56,066 --> 00:46:57,333
Uh...

1055
00:46:57,467 --> 00:46:59,133
so, it's nice to see you.

1056
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:01,500
I'm looking for a pin...
a brooch.

1057
00:47:01,633 --> 00:47:03,000
It's for Veronica,

1058
00:47:03,133 --> 00:47:05,100
'cause for letting me
stay in her apartment.

1059
00:47:05,233 --> 00:47:06,900
She collects them--
brooches.

1060
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:09,000
Right. When is she back?

1061
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:11,400
In two weeks.

1062
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:12,900
Uh, I can
make a brooch for you--

1063
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:13,934
uh, her.

1064
00:47:14,066 --> 00:47:15,200
-Really?
-Yeah.

1065
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,533
Let's see...

1066
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,900
I was just working on something.

1067
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,867
I mean, this is just something
I've been noodling.

1068
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,567
I think this could probably
work as a-- as a brooch.

1069
00:47:26,233 --> 00:47:27,867
That's very Veronica.

1070
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
-Right?
-What are these?

1071
00:47:29,133 --> 00:47:31,367
Uh, those are...

1072
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,233
uh-- oh, here we go.

1073
00:47:33,367 --> 00:47:35,266
Tourmaline quartz, so...

1074
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,400
let's say like that.

1075
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:38,834
She wears
a lot of black and white,

1076
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:40,000
so this is perfect.

1077
00:47:40,133 --> 00:47:41,700
Oh, look.

1078
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:43,500
The reflection on the stone...

1079
00:47:43,633 --> 00:47:45,800
deepens the design.

1080
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:47,800
Yeah. Look at that.

1081
00:47:47,934 --> 00:47:50,667
You didn't notice
you had done that?

1082
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,500
You know, sometimes,
you're just in it,

1083
00:47:52,633 --> 00:47:54,266
and-and, uh, things happen...

1084
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,400
Yes.

1085
00:47:55,533 --> 00:47:58,133
Tourmaline quartz is, uh...

1086
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:01,300
...it heals,

1087
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:02,567
and it brings
inspiration and...

1088
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,633
confidence.

1089
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:05,400
-Where did you get that from?
-The journal.

1090
00:48:05,533 --> 00:48:07,266
My dad's journal.
I dug it out of the trunk.

1091
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,000
Gemma reads it out loud to me.

1092
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:10,100
She loves it.

1093
00:48:10,233 --> 00:48:12,133
You've been busy.

1094
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:14,233
May I?

1095
00:48:14,367 --> 00:48:16,567
Sure.

1096
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,934
It's a lot of commissions
and one-offs.

1097
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:23,000
Uh...

1098
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:26,734
Wow! I've never seen
you design like this.

1099
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:29,500
I'm just giving it a try.

1100
00:48:30,567 --> 00:48:34,333
Gemma has been
a really good influence on you.

1101
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,800
-Yeah.

1102
00:48:37,934 --> 00:48:38,734
Benedict.

1103
00:48:38,867 --> 00:48:41,500
-Are the earrings ready?

1104
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:44,166
Yeah.

1105
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,734
Ohh! Emilia,
it's nice to see you.

1106
00:48:45,867 --> 00:48:47,467
Hi, Reggie.

1107
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,567
Uh...

1108
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,900
these are--

1109
00:48:50,033 --> 00:48:51,633
Oh! Look at that.

1110
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:52,633
Oh, wow.

1111
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,433
They're for Lisa.

1112
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:58,100
They're beautiful.

1113
00:48:58,233 --> 00:49:00,367
She's gonna love them.

1114
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:03,533
Um, I'm late.

1115
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:05,300
No, this is just
gonna take a minute.

1116
00:49:05,433 --> 00:49:06,500
But you're coming
to the opening, right?

1117
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:07,400
On Thursday? With Gemma?

1118
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:08,834
I'll see you there.

1119
00:49:13,133 --> 00:49:15,066
Don't let that one get away.

1120
00:49:16,934 --> 00:49:17,800
Though, from what I've heard,

1121
00:49:17,934 --> 00:49:19,400
if you do need a lawyer...

1122
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,367
Let's take a look
at these together

1123
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,734
and make sure
that we love them.

1124
00:49:43,867 --> 00:49:45,066
What?

1125
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,333
I don't think
I can put this up for sale.

1126
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:49,734
Oh, but it's one of your best.
It has to be in the show.

1127
00:49:49,867 --> 00:49:51,667
This should stay
in the family.

1128
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,300
Let's mark it "sold"

1129
00:49:53,433 --> 00:49:55,233
and you can still show it
for everyone to see.

1130
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,233
That's a good idea.

1131
00:49:58,033 --> 00:49:59,367
Is Ben coming?

1132
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,533
Yes. You should see
the work he's doing.

1133
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:05,233
Gemma has him designing--
really designing.

1134
00:50:05,367 --> 00:50:06,400
Very creative stuff.

1135
00:50:06,533 --> 00:50:07,667
Good for him!

1136
00:50:09,433 --> 00:50:10,800
Isn't it?

1137
00:50:10,934 --> 00:50:12,734
I'm just...

1138
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:15,567
I don't know why didn't do that
when we were together.

1139
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,500
Who knows?

1140
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:20,800
I mean,
why did you start painting?

1141
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,033
I was restless.

1142
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:25,033
I wanted to express myself.

1143
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:27,667
Be me,
apart from anyone else.

1144
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,900
And you found this self,
and you made something good.

1145
00:50:30,033 --> 00:50:31,800
You got inspired.

1146
00:50:31,934 --> 00:50:33,166
I guess I did.

1147
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,033
Benedict was stuck.

1148
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:37,734
Now he makes something good
out of it, too.

1149
00:50:37,867 --> 00:50:39,900
He's finding himself,
and that's a good thing.

1150
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:41,266
You're right.

1151
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:29,266
Fire Opal.

1152
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,934
Individuality.

1153
00:51:31,066 --> 00:51:32,166
Awakening.

1154
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,600
Progress.

1155
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:46,767
Hello?

1156
00:51:54,433 --> 00:51:55,400
Gemma!

1157
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:57,166
Gemma? Hey, where are you?

1158
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,700
Come on.

1159
00:52:06,834 --> 00:52:07,934
You gotta go to school tomorrow.

1160
00:52:11,133 --> 00:52:12,333
-What are you doing?
-Waiting.

1161
00:52:12,467 --> 00:52:13,734
They're just late.

1162
00:52:13,867 --> 00:52:15,700
But they can't come back,
Charlie.

1163
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:17,200
Mom and Dad are gone.

1164
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:19,033
You don't "know" know that.

1165
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:21,367
Y-You didn't see them
in those boxes.

1166
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,000
They can get lost sometimes.

1167
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:32,734
It's gonna be okay.

1168
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:56,133
Who are we listening to?

1169
00:52:56,266 --> 00:52:58,066
"Restore the Hope."

1170
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,934
They're playing a concert
here next week.

1171
00:53:01,066 --> 00:53:02,800
Where have you been?

1172
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,066
I was at work.
I got caught up.

1173
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,266
You didn't even call!

1174
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,433
Do you even know what kind
of sound this house makes?

1175
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:10,967
Things were hitting the roof.

1176
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,734
Uh, branches.

1177
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:15,800
They didn't sound
like branches.

1178
00:53:15,934 --> 00:53:17,900
Sorry. You're right.
I should've called.

1179
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:24,834
Washington must sound different
than New Mexico.

1180
00:53:26,934 --> 00:53:28,300
Do you miss home?

1181
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:29,767
No.

1182
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:33,100
I love adventures.
I want to see everything.

1183
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:36,400
Yeah, you come by that
honestly.

1184
00:53:36,533 --> 00:53:38,800
But both things can be true.

1185
00:53:52,433 --> 00:53:53,600
Hi!

1186
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,900
Hi.

1187
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:57,934
Hi. Thank you so much
for coming.

1188
00:53:58,066 --> 00:53:59,767
-Hi!
-Hi.

1189
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:08,100
Hi!

1190
00:54:08,233 --> 00:54:11,367
Everything looks great.

1191
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,166
You okay?

1192
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,667
I should've practiced riding
in these pants.

1193
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,600
Oh, that's the least
of our worries.

1194
00:54:19,734 --> 00:54:22,467
Who's the guys with his hands
all over Aunt Emilia?

1195
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,533
-Lawrence Donnington.
-That's no good.

1196
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:26,300
Couldn't agree with you more.

1197
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:28,433
Okay. Um, listen,

1198
00:54:28,567 --> 00:54:30,533
in a half an hour,
meet me outside with Harry

1199
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:31,567
and the horse.

1200
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,333
I'll bring Emilia out there,
and off we go.

1201
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,467
And where are you going?

1202
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,100
Into the sunset.

1203
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:38,200
Romantic, right?

1204
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:39,300
Totally.

1205
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,934
Oh.

1206
00:54:46,066 --> 00:54:48,033
Go ahead.

1207
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:50,333
-Hey.
-Hey.

1208
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:51,400
-All right.
-How's it going?

1209
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,767
There he is!

1210
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,133
Benedict!

1211
00:54:58,266 --> 00:54:59,433
Thank you so much.

1212
00:54:59,567 --> 00:55:01,367
I love it.

1213
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,867
It was all Owen's idea.

1214
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,734
Yeah, I would've harvested
those pearls myself,

1215
00:55:04,867 --> 00:55:06,667
if I had to.

1216
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,600
Uh, anyone seen the bar?

1217
00:55:08,734 --> 00:55:09,700
It's over there.

1218
00:55:09,834 --> 00:55:12,700
Fair warning--
white wine only.

1219
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:18,333
Hi. I'd like to grab
this painting over here.

1220
00:55:18,467 --> 00:55:19,934
Purchase it.

1221
00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:22,266
Perfect.

1222
00:55:24,066 --> 00:55:25,834
The Powells want to meet you.

1223
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:28,767
They have an art gallery
in San Francisco--

1224
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,934
very high-end market.

1225
00:55:31,633 --> 00:55:32,700
Hey.

1226
00:55:32,834 --> 00:55:35,700
Remember that concert
that I was telling you about?

1227
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:37,166
Guess who's going.

1228
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,200
Um...

1229
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:40,066
the goofballs?

1230
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,500
Come on, you know their dad
and everything.

1231
00:55:42,633 --> 00:55:44,567
I'll think about it.

1232
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,433
Remember, be outside
in 20 minutes.

1233
00:55:46,567 --> 00:55:47,934
-I won't forget.
-Okay, okay, okay.

1234
00:55:48,066 --> 00:55:49,200
Focus.

1235
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,600
Okay.

1236
00:56:03,734 --> 00:56:05,433
You bought it?

1237
00:56:05,567 --> 00:56:06,633
Yeah, it was the first one.

1238
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:08,467
I couldn't let that go.

1239
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,967
I wanted to get the gem tree,
but it's already been sold.

1240
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,667
No. It's just not for sale.

1241
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:15,934
I couldn't let that one go.

1242
00:56:17,266 --> 00:56:18,433
Shoulder?

1243
00:56:23,934 --> 00:56:25,300
I'm not used to these heels.

1244
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,233
Uh, if I could have
everybody's attention, please,

1245
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:29,266
for a moment.

1246
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,300
I have to go.

1247
00:56:34,033 --> 00:56:34,967
Hello, everyone.

1248
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,333
I wanted to thank you all
for coming tonight,

1249
00:56:37,467 --> 00:56:38,567
to welcome

1250
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,133
a bright new light

1251
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:42,633
to the art world
on the West Coast.

1252
00:56:42,767 --> 00:56:45,400
Emilia brings her passion
and a sense of color

1253
00:56:45,533 --> 00:56:46,900
and light

1254
00:56:47,033 --> 00:56:48,467
from her Argentinean roots,

1255
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,900
and gives our Washington flora
and countryside

1256
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,367
a special glow.

1257
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,800
Hard to believe
this is her first show.

1258
00:56:56,934 --> 00:57:00,734
I'm grateful to be
the art dealer who found her.

1259
00:57:00,867 --> 00:57:01,800
Emilia...

1260
00:57:01,934 --> 00:57:03,200
congratulations.

1261
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:04,367
Thank you.

1262
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,400
Well, this is a first
for me--

1263
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:15,800
to be showing my art

1264
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:17,467
and also to be talking to

1265
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,700
what looks like

1266
00:57:18,834 --> 00:57:19,834
the whole population
of the island.

1267
00:57:21,266 --> 00:57:23,000
I didn't know
you were such art lovers.

1268
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:28,300
When I started painting,
I did it for myself,

1269
00:57:28,433 --> 00:57:29,533
and I've never dreamt

1270
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:33,200
that I would be showing
these paintings here tonight,

1271
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:35,734
so I want to say thank you.

1272
00:57:35,867 --> 00:57:37,166
I am so grateful
for your support.

1273
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:44,467
Only vintage
would be worthy of you tonight.

1274
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,700
Oh, thank you.

1275
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,734
Hey.

1276
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,333
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1277
00:57:52,467 --> 00:57:53,633
I have a surprise for you.

1278
00:57:53,767 --> 00:57:54,834
Outside.

1279
00:57:54,967 --> 00:57:56,800
-Where?
-Just out front.

1280
00:57:56,934 --> 00:57:58,800
Okay.

1281
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,467
Uh, Emilia, where are you--?

1282
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,533
There's a surprise
for me outside.

1283
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:04,066
A surprise?

1284
00:58:16,867 --> 00:58:17,867
What's this?

1285
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,233
Maisy.

1286
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:20,734
Where's Bingo?

1287
00:58:20,867 --> 00:58:22,734
He twisted his ankle
in the turnout.

1288
00:58:22,867 --> 00:58:24,133
He should be good
in a week or two.

1289
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:25,533
I didn't want to leave you
high and dry,

1290
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:27,200
so here's Maisy.

1291
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:29,233
What in the blazes
am I supposed to do with Maisy?

1292
00:58:29,367 --> 00:58:31,300
Uh, who's your furry friend,
Benedict?

1293
00:58:32,533 --> 00:58:34,533
Uh, Maisy.

1294
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:36,800
Everyone...
Everyone, Maisy.

1295
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:39,066
Um...

1296
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,400
Llamas...

1297
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:44,233
represent strength...

1298
00:58:44,367 --> 00:58:45,734
and perseverance--

1299
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:46,800
Beauty.

1300
00:58:46,934 --> 00:58:47,934
Beauty!

1301
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,934
And grace in rocky places.

1302
00:58:51,066 --> 00:58:54,200
And that's what Emilia is...

1303
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:55,467
beauty and grace, I mean.

1304
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,767
Not rocky.

1305
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,734
She's adorable.
Thank you.

1306
00:58:59,867 --> 00:59:03,633
An opening-night llama?
That's, uh, definitely a first.

1307
00:59:04,967 --> 00:59:06,300
Emilia, your husband's a hoot.

1308
00:59:07,567 --> 00:59:08,734
I love llamas.

1309
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,500
Could you give us a minute?

1310
00:59:14,633 --> 00:59:15,934
This wasn't the plan.

1311
00:59:16,066 --> 00:59:16,867
Bingo twisted an ankle.

1312
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,300
"Bingo"?

1313
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:20,266
Uh, there was a white stallion
to ride

1314
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,000
and, you know, sweep you away.

1315
00:59:23,133 --> 00:59:24,633
Who was gonna ride it?

1316
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:25,700
You?

1317
00:59:25,834 --> 00:59:26,967
And you.

1318
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,967
Uh, Emilia?

1319
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,033
Some buyers
want to say hello.

1320
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:33,600
I'll be right there.

1321
00:59:33,734 --> 00:59:34,700
I have to go.

1322
00:59:35,834 --> 00:59:37,133
Okay.

1323
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,133
Uncle B?

1324
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,700
You ready to call it a night?

1325
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:54,700
Hey... what do you
want me to do with Maisy?

1326
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:01,633
Bloodstone.

1327
01:00:01,767 --> 01:00:02,533
Courage.

1328
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:03,533
Guidance.

1329
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:04,934
Instinct.

1330
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,133
Great job under pressure.

1331
01:00:08,266 --> 01:00:09,400
Bonus points!

1332
01:00:09,533 --> 01:00:11,800
No more big gestures.

1333
01:00:11,934 --> 01:00:14,567
Oh, no, no.
You just need the right one.

1334
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,900
Honestly, it was 50-50

1335
01:00:16,033 --> 01:00:17,800
you would even
stay on the horse.

1336
01:00:17,934 --> 01:00:19,700
And where were you gonna
put Aunt Emilia?

1337
01:00:19,834 --> 01:00:22,900
Yeah, I just realized,
I didn't really work that out.

1338
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:25,033
I think she was impressed.

1339
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:26,300
Seriously.

1340
01:00:26,433 --> 01:00:28,934
Anybody can give out
a bottle of champagne.

1341
01:00:29,066 --> 01:00:30,767
Which one do you think
she's gonna remember?

1342
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,233
Heh! There is that.

1343
01:00:32,367 --> 01:00:35,066
Also, you don't have to worry
about that Lawrence.

1344
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,433
-Oh?
-I figured it out.

1345
01:00:36,567 --> 01:00:38,066
-Really?
-He may sell art--

1346
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,200
-Uh-huh?
-...But you make art.

1347
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:43,033
I saw two Benedict Stone
originals in there tonight,

1348
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:45,300
and they look amazing.

1349
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,433
You may not know it,

1350
01:00:46,567 --> 01:00:49,133
but you had a great night,
Uncle B.

1351
01:00:49,266 --> 01:00:51,867
You really want to go
to that concert, don't you?

1352
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,934
Oh! So much!

1353
01:00:54,066 --> 01:00:55,100
But that's not why--

1354
01:00:55,233 --> 01:00:57,100
Oh, give me a break.

1355
01:00:57,233 --> 01:00:59,300
I raised a teenager.
I'll see you coming.

1356
01:00:59,433 --> 01:01:02,333
Okay, well, I'm glad
you've been trained.

1357
01:01:02,467 --> 01:01:04,233
I know I can be a handful.

1358
01:01:05,734 --> 01:01:06,867
Why would you say that?

1359
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,200
"Handful."

1360
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:10,500
Oh, it's just something
Dad always said.

1361
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:11,433
Says.

1362
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:13,100
Hey! The ice cream shop's
still open.

1363
01:01:13,233 --> 01:01:14,233
My treat.

1364
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,467
I guess my tab with you's
getting pretty big now.

1365
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,333
Okay, every single piece sold,
Emilia.

1366
01:01:27,467 --> 01:01:28,800
Now, that never happens.

1367
01:01:28,934 --> 01:01:29,834
These are friends
and neighbors.

1368
01:01:29,967 --> 01:01:30,967
They were just being supportive.

1369
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,000
Nobody's polite
with their money.

1370
01:01:33,133 --> 01:01:34,633
Ah! Listen to your cousin.

1371
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:36,667
Okay, I've got to run,

1372
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,934
but this is just the beginning
for you and I, Ms. Ramirez.

1373
01:01:39,066 --> 01:01:40,000
Ciao.

1374
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,700
Don't.

1375
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:46,500
Everything's
still up in the air.

1376
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,500
Thank you.

1377
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:02,934
Gemma, I need to ask you--

1378
01:02:03,066 --> 01:02:05,600
we haven't heard from your dad
since that one email.

1379
01:02:05,734 --> 01:02:08,233
Why do you got
to "make it work"?

1380
01:02:08,367 --> 01:02:09,633
What?

1381
01:02:10,834 --> 01:02:12,834
"Everything is beyond ruined.

1382
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:15,700
If you don't belong here,
then there's nowhere else."

1383
01:02:18,233 --> 01:02:19,767
I didn't write that.

1384
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:22,433
What's ruined?

1385
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:23,934
Why do you have
nowhere else to go?

1386
01:02:24,066 --> 01:02:25,500
You want me to go?
Fine! I'll leave.

1387
01:02:25,633 --> 01:02:27,266
Gemma, is Charlie still alive?

1388
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,400
What?

1389
01:02:28,533 --> 01:02:30,600
Of course, he's still alive!

1390
01:02:30,734 --> 01:02:31,700
Then what's going on
with you two?

1391
01:02:31,834 --> 01:02:32,767
Tell me the truth.

1392
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,333
The truth...

1393
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,433
My dad's actually
just really happy

1394
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:41,266
that I'm gone right now.

1395
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,734
He's remarried--

1396
01:02:43,867 --> 01:02:45,767
Haley--
and they're having a lot of fun,

1397
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,533
so I wanted to spend
the whole summer here.

1398
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,333
Not just a few days,
that's why I had to...

1399
01:02:52,467 --> 01:02:53,300
"Make it work."

1400
01:02:56,834 --> 01:02:58,100
All right.

1401
01:02:58,233 --> 01:02:59,600
Is there anything else
I need to know?

1402
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,066
No.

1403
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,734
Well, there is one thing.

1404
01:03:02,867 --> 01:03:03,967
Mm?

1405
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,100
This shop needs a makeover.

1406
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,433
Okay, I see it.

1407
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,667
A total...

1408
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,500
extreme...

1409
01:03:12,633 --> 01:03:14,100
makeover!

1410
01:03:14,233 --> 01:03:16,467
Whoa. One coat of paint,

1411
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,600
maybe,

1412
01:03:17,734 --> 01:03:18,834
but I pick the color.

1413
01:03:18,967 --> 01:03:20,667
We'll see.

1414
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:37,834
Nice, right?

1415
01:03:39,967 --> 01:03:42,467
This is the gesture
Emilia needs.

1416
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:48,433
Watch your step.

1417
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:50,567
We're going through the door.

1418
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,834
Careful.

1419
01:03:52,967 --> 01:03:54,734
-A few more steps...
-Okay.

1420
01:03:54,867 --> 01:03:56,266
Almost...

1421
01:03:58,133 --> 01:03:59,166
Okay.

1422
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,300
Stay there,
stay there, stay there.

1423
01:04:01,433 --> 01:04:02,333
Open your eyes.

1424
01:04:03,834 --> 01:04:05,200
Ta-dah!

1425
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:07,867
Wow.

1426
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,066
Looks like
a completely different shop.

1427
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,433
Right?

1428
01:04:14,133 --> 01:04:15,867
Oh... Benedict.

1429
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,567
You didn't have to do that.

1430
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,967
It's perfect there.

1431
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,000
I mean...

1432
01:04:22,133 --> 01:04:23,600
you belong here.

1433
01:04:25,467 --> 01:04:27,266
Your work does.

1434
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,700
Let me take you both
out to celebrate.

1435
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,333
Oh. Well,

1436
01:04:33,467 --> 01:04:35,333
I have a headache
from all the fumes.

1437
01:04:35,467 --> 01:04:36,700
So does Kimberly,

1438
01:04:36,834 --> 01:04:37,967
so I should take us both
back home,

1439
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,000
but you two go.

1440
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,133
Ben?

1441
01:04:41,266 --> 01:04:43,166
-Alfie's Bistro.
-Yeah.

1442
01:04:44,834 --> 01:04:47,467
Hey, the cat stays
in the crate, all right?

1443
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,400
Okay.

1444
01:04:54,467 --> 01:04:56,166
To your show.

1445
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,533
-To your new shop.
-To us!

1446
01:04:58,667 --> 01:04:59,667
What?

1447
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,900
Is it Lawrence?

1448
01:05:02,033 --> 01:05:03,734
Ben! We're still married.

1449
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:05,533
And that's stopping him?

1450
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:06,900
He's a gentleman,

1451
01:05:07,033 --> 01:05:09,500
and I keep things
professional.

1452
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,633
Come home, Emilia.

1453
01:05:12,767 --> 01:05:13,734
It is different.

1454
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:15,367
-How?
-I mean...

1455
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,066
I know I wasn't very open
to adoption before,

1456
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,266
but now I can see it.

1457
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,767
Benedict.

1458
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,100
You don't want to adopt?

1459
01:05:22,233 --> 01:05:24,867
It's not about kids anymore.

1460
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,300
It's about us.
You and me.

1461
01:05:28,433 --> 01:05:30,967
Could you be happy
with just the two of us?

1462
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:33,133
I mean, that's how it's been
for the past 10 years.

1463
01:05:33,266 --> 01:05:34,734
I'm-- I was...

1464
01:05:34,867 --> 01:05:36,633
-Happy?
-Yeah.

1465
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,567
We were,
but waiting, always--

1466
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,233
waiting on treatments

1467
01:05:40,367 --> 01:05:42,567
and test results.

1468
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:45,300
It was as if
waiting for a child meant

1469
01:05:45,433 --> 01:05:47,967
we were waiting
for our own lives to start.

1470
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,133
That has to stop.

1471
01:05:49,266 --> 01:05:50,734
You're right.

1472
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:54,467
Just like that?

1473
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,734
Why not?

1474
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,100
Could you be happy
with just the two of us?

1475
01:05:59,233 --> 01:06:00,200
Yes.

1476
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:01,667
I could.

1477
01:06:03,266 --> 01:06:04,867
It's a big change.

1478
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,166
But...

1479
01:06:09,934 --> 01:06:11,934
There's no answer tonight.

1480
01:06:12,066 --> 01:06:13,033
Just dinner.

1481
01:06:24,033 --> 01:06:25,400
Azurite.

1482
01:06:25,533 --> 01:06:26,500
Memories.

1483
01:06:26,633 --> 01:06:27,734
Release.

1484
01:06:27,867 --> 01:06:29,133
Mysteries.

1485
01:06:33,867 --> 01:06:34,934
Hey, since when
do you wear makeup?

1486
01:06:35,066 --> 01:06:36,800
Aunt Emilia gave it to me.

1487
01:06:36,934 --> 01:06:38,900
Her cousin's hilarious,
by the way.

1488
01:06:39,033 --> 01:06:39,967
She gave me the eyeliner.

1489
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,600
This is not a date.

1490
01:06:41,734 --> 01:06:43,166
With either Steve or Sean,
correct?

1491
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,633
It's just a concert.

1492
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:46,300
I think
their dad's even going.

1493
01:06:46,433 --> 01:06:47,834
Here, um...

1494
01:06:47,967 --> 01:06:51,133
a phone
and some emergency cash,

1495
01:06:51,266 --> 01:06:53,000
in case you get separated
in the crowd.

1496
01:06:53,133 --> 01:06:54,266
I don't need it.

1497
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,834
Listen, um...

1498
01:06:55,967 --> 01:06:57,900
there's plenty of minutes
already prepaid on that thing.

1499
01:06:58,033 --> 01:06:58,934
Set up a meeting spot,

1500
01:06:59,066 --> 01:07:00,400
just in case
you get separated.

1501
01:07:00,533 --> 01:07:02,667
Relax!
You get the night off from me.

1502
01:07:03,867 --> 01:07:05,500
Have fun.

1503
01:07:05,633 --> 01:07:07,700
Not too much fun.

1504
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,133
And there's a hit
up the third base line

1505
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:18,734
into left field.

1506
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:20,367
That's going
to bring in a run.

1507
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,533
And Davis,
with a one-out single,

1508
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:24,333
gets it,

1509
01:07:24,467 --> 01:07:25,500
and it's 3-2.

1510
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:51,667
Something new.

1511
01:07:53,834 --> 01:07:55,834
You're supposed
to be in your crate, cat.

1512
01:07:55,967 --> 01:07:57,567
How did you even get out here?

1513
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,166
Yes. You forget your key?

1514
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:03,467
Well, don't go up there.

1515
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,734
Hey.

1516
01:08:06,367 --> 01:08:07,800
I'm not kidding.

1517
01:08:07,934 --> 01:08:09,266
Just stay put.

1518
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,133
I'm coming up to get you.

1519
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,467
No, no, no, no, no!

1520
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,934
Oh, my...

1521
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:20,633
Hey, kitty-cat. Kimberly.

1522
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:22,133
Get outta there.

1523
01:08:22,266 --> 01:08:24,233
I'll get some snacks
for your crate.

1524
01:08:51,133 --> 01:08:53,533
Hey. It's Charlie.
Leave a message.

1525
01:08:53,667 --> 01:08:55,867
Hey, Charlie. It's Ben.

1526
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,367
Your brother... Benedict.

1527
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,367
Uh, Gemma's here.

1528
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,266
She's in Washington.

1529
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,834
Um, she said you knew,

1530
01:09:03,967 --> 01:09:06,500
but I just found her phone
and saw your messages.

1531
01:09:06,633 --> 01:09:09,333
Uh, she gave me
an email for you,

1532
01:09:09,467 --> 01:09:11,266
but it's obviously
an address that she controls,

1533
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,667
not yours.

1534
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,200
Um...

1535
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:16,767
anyway, she is safe,

1536
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:18,767
and she is home--

1537
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:20,266
uh, at the house.

1538
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,934
So...

1539
01:09:22,066 --> 01:09:23,300
call me, Charlie.

1540
01:09:23,433 --> 01:09:24,734
It's the old number.

1541
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,433
That drummer was amazing!

1542
01:09:37,567 --> 01:09:38,400
Unreal!

1543
01:09:38,533 --> 01:09:43,000
Shh! I think
Uncle B's probably asleep.

1544
01:09:43,133 --> 01:09:44,100
Whoa.

1545
01:09:44,233 --> 01:09:45,467
That tree is sick.

1546
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,600
So big.
How old is it?

1547
01:09:47,734 --> 01:09:50,000
I don't know, but it's been
in the family for forever.

1548
01:09:50,133 --> 01:09:51,700
-Yo! Let's climb it.
-Race you to the top!

1549
01:09:51,834 --> 01:09:52,800
Guys.

1550
01:09:52,934 --> 01:09:54,100
No! Wait! Please!

1551
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:55,166
Dude!

1552
01:09:56,467 --> 01:09:58,100
Whoa!

1553
01:09:58,233 --> 01:09:59,333
What is this?

1554
01:09:59,467 --> 01:10:01,166
No, please. Please.
It's private.

1555
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:02,667
A private tree?

1556
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,734
You hang rocks from a tree?

1557
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:06,433
No, you don't understand.
Please just get out.

1558
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:07,633
We're not gonna hurt it.

1559
01:10:07,767 --> 01:10:09,133
It's a tree.

1560
01:10:09,266 --> 01:10:10,967
It's not just "a tree."

1561
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,100
-Steve, listen.

1562
01:10:12,233 --> 01:10:14,033
No, please. Please stop.

1563
01:10:14,967 --> 01:10:16,000
Gemma.

1564
01:10:20,767 --> 01:10:21,834
Look what you've done!

1565
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:22,734
You don't even know!

1566
01:10:22,867 --> 01:10:24,633
You stomp in here,
out of nowhere,

1567
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,266
and ruin everything!

1568
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,600
Guys, I think
it's time to go home.

1569
01:10:27,734 --> 01:10:28,800
Sorry, we didn't mean to--

1570
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:31,500
I'll handle it.
Just go.

1571
01:10:31,633 --> 01:10:32,734
Sorry.

1572
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,934
Hey.

1573
01:10:35,066 --> 01:10:36,367
Let's go inside.

1574
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,500
I'm sorry I lost it out there.

1575
01:10:51,233 --> 01:10:53,266
I just need sleep.

1576
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,600
We'll talk in the morning.

1577
01:11:13,567 --> 01:11:15,367
Gemma?

1578
01:11:17,066 --> 01:11:20,266
Are you awake?

1579
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,734
I made breakfast.

1580
01:11:21,867 --> 01:11:23,400
I can't.

1581
01:11:23,533 --> 01:11:25,500
I'm sick.

1582
01:11:25,633 --> 01:11:26,834
Should I call a doctor?

1583
01:11:26,967 --> 01:11:29,333
No.

1584
01:11:29,467 --> 01:11:30,834
I just need sleep.

1585
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,734
I'll come back at lunch
and check on you.

1586
01:11:40,367 --> 01:11:41,834
Charlie didn't know
Gemma was here?

1587
01:11:41,967 --> 01:11:42,900
Doesn't look like it.

1588
01:11:43,033 --> 01:11:44,567
Which makes more sense,

1589
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,900
rather than let her
take off on her own.

1590
01:11:47,033 --> 01:11:48,500
Yeah.

1591
01:11:48,633 --> 01:11:50,233
Did she stay in bed today?

1592
01:11:50,367 --> 01:11:52,567
Oh, yeah,
she doesn't want to talk.

1593
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:53,767
She knows what's coming.

1594
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,000
What is coming?

1595
01:11:55,133 --> 01:11:57,333
I gotta take her home.

1596
01:11:57,467 --> 01:11:59,767
At least now you're gonna
be able to see Charlie.

1597
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,233
This is what
you always wanted, right?

1598
01:12:02,367 --> 01:12:04,300
-Ben, please.

1599
01:12:04,433 --> 01:12:07,133
Why can't you just tell me?

1600
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:12,100
You ever do something
you were ashamed of,

1601
01:12:12,233 --> 01:12:14,800
but if you were in
the same place,

1602
01:12:14,934 --> 01:12:17,400
you'd do it all over again?

1603
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:19,567
I'm not sure.

1604
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:22,667
When our parents died,
there was life-insurance money.

1605
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,934
It would've been split
between us,

1606
01:12:25,066 --> 01:12:26,333
and the lawyer told both of us,

1607
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,100
so Charlie knew,
when he turned 18,

1608
01:12:28,233 --> 01:12:29,233
he'd get his share.

1609
01:12:29,367 --> 01:12:32,066
He wanted to travel,
he wanted to see the world,

1610
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,367
like our parents.

1611
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,467
He talked about it all the time
and it became his way out.

1612
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,166
I was already 18,
so I took over the shop.

1613
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,333
I didn't know
what I was doing,

1614
01:12:40,467 --> 01:12:42,300
but I needed
to keep us afloat,

1615
01:12:42,433 --> 01:12:45,166
so, I took
all the insurance money,

1616
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,834
and I paid off the house,
and I paid off the shop.

1617
01:12:48,967 --> 01:12:50,667
I didn't even ask him.

1618
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,133
I didn't even tell him
until the day he turned 18.

1619
01:12:52,266 --> 01:12:53,800
Oh...

1620
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:57,166
We both said a lot of things
that we shouldn't have.

1621
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,133
But the next day,

1622
01:12:59,266 --> 01:13:01,000
he took off,

1623
01:13:01,133 --> 01:13:02,834
and I haven't heard
from him since.

1624
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,500
You were in
a desperate situation, Ben.

1625
01:13:06,633 --> 01:13:09,166
You were a kid yourself,
trying to take care of you both.

1626
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,834
He thought I cheated him.
And maybe I did, you know?

1627
01:13:11,967 --> 01:13:14,066
I did what I wanted--

1628
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,867
to keep everything the same,
no more surprises,

1629
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,266
to keep Charlie here.

1630
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,033
You don't like
to let go of what you love.

1631
01:13:21,266 --> 01:13:22,667
But you have to.

1632
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,200
I do get that now.

1633
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,166
To give them room...

1634
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,467
to come back.

1635
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,867
That's what I want, Emilia.

1636
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,400
I'm ready to let go of anything.

1637
01:13:31,533 --> 01:13:33,467
Everything
that gets in the way.

1638
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,734
I don't need
somebody else's idea of perfect.

1639
01:13:35,867 --> 01:13:36,734
I don't need that.

1640
01:13:36,867 --> 01:13:38,233
I need what's real.

1641
01:13:38,367 --> 01:13:40,166
And that's you.

1642
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:45,967
What if I, um...

1643
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,033
pick up some groceries,

1644
01:13:47,166 --> 01:13:48,467
come over,

1645
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,300
cook some dinner,

1646
01:13:50,433 --> 01:13:53,333
and we can talk about
what that may look like.

1647
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,567
What else do you need?

1648
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,066
This.

1649
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,400
You and me.

1650
01:14:02,533 --> 01:14:03,467
That's all.

1651
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,066
Do you want me
to talk to Gemma?

1652
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,300
And that. Yes.

1653
01:14:07,433 --> 01:14:08,233
Yeah, please.

1654
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:10,567
I'll pick up some things
and come home.

1655
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,767
I'll be there.

1656
01:14:22,433 --> 01:14:23,433
Ben.

1657
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:26,700
Charlie.

1658
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,734
Onyx.

1659
01:14:34,867 --> 01:14:36,166
Gives strength.

1660
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,467
Old sorrows.

1661
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,300
Letting go.

1662
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:42,133
Where's my daughter?

1663
01:14:42,266 --> 01:14:43,734
She's in the house.

1664
01:14:44,967 --> 01:14:46,667
Why didn't you contact me?

1665
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,400
I told you, I tried to.

1666
01:14:48,533 --> 01:14:49,400
I didn't know where you were.

1667
01:14:49,533 --> 01:14:51,066
Obviously,
Gemma didn't want me to know.

1668
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,834
So you didn't think
it was strange that a teenager

1669
01:14:52,967 --> 01:14:54,533
would just take off
without talking to anyone?

1670
01:14:54,667 --> 01:14:57,166
She's your daughter, man.
I don't know.

1671
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,667
Did you hear what you just said?
Do you want to play that back?

1672
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,400
Hey! That's not the same, okay?
This is different.

1673
01:15:02,533 --> 01:15:04,300
She's only 16.
She just ran away.

1674
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:06,033
Hey, man, she told me
she had permission.

1675
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:07,266
I reached out to you--

1676
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,233
Do you honestly think

1677
01:15:08,367 --> 01:15:10,200
I would let her
come anywhere near here?

1678
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:12,700
I don't want anything
to do with you

1679
01:15:12,834 --> 01:15:15,033
or the Stone family "museum"
you're living in--

1680
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:15,967
That's hilarious.

1681
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:17,934
You named
your only daughter "Gemma".

1682
01:15:18,066 --> 01:15:20,800
That was for Mom and Dad,
not this.

1683
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:24,700
Okay, I would never have--
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1684
01:15:24,834 --> 01:15:25,800
-...anything
they don't want to do.

1685
01:15:25,934 --> 01:15:27,800
I made sure
you had a home, Charlie.

1686
01:15:27,934 --> 01:15:31,400
A home that wouldn't blow away
with some storm, okay?

1687
01:15:31,533 --> 01:15:34,266
I didn't ask Gemma to come here,
but she likes it here.

1688
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,533
She feels like she belongs.

1689
01:15:35,667 --> 01:15:36,633
Gemma has a home!

1690
01:15:36,767 --> 01:15:37,800
Oh, really?
Why'd she run away?

1691
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:41,233
I don't know, okay?

1692
01:15:43,567 --> 01:15:44,767
Come on.
You must have some idea.

1693
01:15:48,767 --> 01:15:50,633
My wife's pregnant.

1694
01:15:50,767 --> 01:15:53,233
Twins.

1695
01:15:53,367 --> 01:15:55,300
Gemma's been
pretty quiet about it.

1696
01:15:55,433 --> 01:15:58,633
I knew she was upset,
I just didn't realize how much.

1697
01:15:59,934 --> 01:16:01,533
I'll just take her home.

1698
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:02,667
And that's it?

1699
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,834
See you in another 20 years?

1700
01:16:04,967 --> 01:16:06,100
Never?

1701
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:07,467
I don't even
know you anymore.

1702
01:16:08,633 --> 01:16:12,367
And you know nothing about
what I had to do to survive,

1703
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,467
let alone--

1704
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,200
No. I'm not doing this with you.

1705
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:17,467
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

1706
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,033
-Where is she?
-She's in your old room.

1707
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:20,800
Okay.

1708
01:16:22,967 --> 01:16:24,333
Gemma?

1709
01:16:24,467 --> 01:16:26,033
Gemma, come down here, please.

1710
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:27,033
Charlie, wait.

1711
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:28,500
She's gone.

1712
01:16:28,633 --> 01:16:30,000
What?

1713
01:16:30,133 --> 01:16:32,333
Yeah. And she took her phone.

1714
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:35,934
I'll get my car.

1715
01:16:36,066 --> 01:16:36,967
She's on foot.

1716
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:40,133
If she overheard us,
she can't have gone far.

1717
01:16:40,266 --> 01:16:41,800
We'll find her--

1718
01:16:41,934 --> 01:16:44,033
Hey, it's Gemma.

1719
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,000
Leave a message.

1720
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:46,367
Is that Charlie?

1721
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,834
Yeah. Gemma ran away.

1722
01:16:47,967 --> 01:16:50,100
Gemma, it's Dad.
Where are you?

1723
01:16:50,233 --> 01:16:51,467
What happened?

1724
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,333
We were arguing
and she heard us.

1725
01:16:53,467 --> 01:16:54,333
Ohh...

1726
01:16:54,467 --> 01:16:55,600
I'm not mad.

1727
01:16:55,734 --> 01:16:57,600
Please call me back.

1728
01:16:57,734 --> 01:16:59,000
No answer.

1729
01:16:59,133 --> 01:17:00,834
Hi. I'm Emilia.
I'm Ben's wife.

1730
01:17:00,967 --> 01:17:03,400
-Hi. Charlie.
-Hi.

1731
01:17:03,533 --> 01:17:05,667
Where could she be?
Where could she go?

1732
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,433
Everywhere. She thinks
the whole place is an adventure.

1733
01:17:07,567 --> 01:17:10,400
Wait. No. She likes to hike
Green Falls Trail.

1734
01:17:10,533 --> 01:17:12,333
She loves the smell
of the trees and the ocean.

1735
01:17:12,467 --> 01:17:14,600
Okay. Let's go.

1736
01:17:14,734 --> 01:17:15,934
I'll put this here.

1737
01:17:22,734 --> 01:17:23,934
Gemma!

1738
01:17:24,066 --> 01:17:25,767
Gemma...

1739
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,100
Gemma?

1740
01:17:27,233 --> 01:17:29,133
Gemma!

1741
01:17:32,767 --> 01:17:33,633
You hear that?

1742
01:17:33,767 --> 01:17:34,834
Yeah. This way.

1743
01:17:37,433 --> 01:17:39,100
-Gemma?
-I'm over here.

1744
01:17:40,734 --> 01:17:42,567
Oh... sweetie.

1745
01:17:43,767 --> 01:17:45,433
I'm sorry.

1746
01:17:45,567 --> 01:17:46,467
Okay.

1747
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,567
What happened?

1748
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,633
I heard you two yelling
and I had to get away,

1749
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:52,400
but I fell off the path
and I got stuck.

1750
01:17:52,533 --> 01:17:54,266
Okay, okay. It's okay.

1751
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,734
Uh, can you wiggle your toes?

1752
01:17:55,867 --> 01:17:58,400
-Yeah.
-Okay. That's good. That's good.

1753
01:17:58,533 --> 01:18:00,166
This is just gonna be
like that rockslide

1754
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,333
on the West Mesa.
Remember that?

1755
01:18:01,467 --> 01:18:02,600
I'm gonna lose a boot?

1756
01:18:02,734 --> 01:18:04,367
But you get to keep your foot.

1757
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,133
That's fair.

1758
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:07,500
Okay, honey, listen,
look at me,

1759
01:18:07,633 --> 01:18:09,100
this is what
we're gonna do, okay?

1760
01:18:09,233 --> 01:18:10,800
On the count of three,
he's gonna lift,

1761
01:18:10,934 --> 01:18:13,133
and then I'm gonna pull
your leg out, okay?

1762
01:18:13,266 --> 01:18:14,633
Nice and easy, all right?

1763
01:18:14,767 --> 01:18:15,967
-Yeah.
-Okay. You ready?

1764
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:17,834
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay. Let's go.

1765
01:18:17,967 --> 01:18:19,133
One...

1766
01:18:19,266 --> 01:18:20,300
two...

1767
01:18:20,433 --> 01:18:22,367
three!

1768
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,333
Ow!

1769
01:18:23,467 --> 01:18:24,266
-Oh. It's okay.

1770
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,266
It's okay. It's okay.
It's not so bad.

1771
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,100
-You hurt?
-Mm-hmm.

1772
01:18:29,233 --> 01:18:30,133
Okay, can you stand?

1773
01:18:30,266 --> 01:18:31,834
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Yeah?

1774
01:18:31,967 --> 01:18:33,467
Okay, let's give it a go.
Nice and easy.

1775
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,633
Ahh!

1776
01:18:34,767 --> 01:18:36,667
-Try not to stand on it.
-I got you.

1777
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,800
Ow.

1778
01:18:37,934 --> 01:18:39,300
Okay, here we go.

1779
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,533
Okay. Okay.

1780
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:47,500
Okay. Come here.

1781
01:18:50,166 --> 01:18:52,233
Don't scare me like that.

1782
01:18:54,567 --> 01:18:56,133
You're never in the way.

1783
01:18:56,266 --> 01:18:58,200
I don't fit anymore.

1784
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:00,467
You're always gonna be
my little girl, okay?

1785
01:19:02,066 --> 01:19:03,900
Come here.

1786
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:10,233
Let's get out of here.

1787
01:19:10,367 --> 01:19:12,266
Let's go. Let's go.
Nice and easy.

1788
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,934
Look at them.

1789
01:19:15,066 --> 01:19:16,667
They look close.

1790
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,266
It's a good thing.

1791
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,800
Yeah.

1792
01:19:22,667 --> 01:19:24,133
Nice and easy.

1793
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,767
Right this way.

1794
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:27,900
I haven't heard.

1795
01:19:28,033 --> 01:19:30,233
Hey. You scared me.

1796
01:19:30,367 --> 01:19:31,266
I'm sorry.

1797
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,266
So are you okay?

1798
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,400
Yeah, I just need these
for a few days.

1799
01:19:34,533 --> 01:19:36,066
I booked a hotel,

1800
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,233
so I'm gonna take Gemma
there tonight.

1801
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,000
Grab her stuff tomorrow?

1802
01:19:40,133 --> 01:19:41,834
Yeah. I'll pack it up.

1803
01:19:41,967 --> 01:19:43,266
It looks like your old room's

1804
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,433
gonna be an art studio again
real soon.

1805
01:19:48,533 --> 01:19:50,100
Mission accomplished!

1806
01:19:50,233 --> 01:19:51,266
Thank you.

1807
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,867
For everything.

1808
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,033
Hey, if you're up for it,

1809
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:56,834
we're heading
to the block party.

1810
01:19:56,967 --> 01:19:57,934
Are you coming?

1811
01:19:58,066 --> 01:20:00,333
Oh, Dad, can we? Please?

1812
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:03,266
I've been waiting all summer.
Just for a bit?

1813
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,734
than the numbers

1814
01:20:21,033 --> 01:20:22,000
Gemma!

1815
01:20:22,133 --> 01:20:24,400
Hey! Come meet Jason!

1816
01:20:24,533 --> 01:20:25,433
Be right there!

1817
01:20:25,567 --> 01:20:27,166
Jason?
What happened to Tony?

1818
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,066
Oh, that was
obviously doomed, Uncle B.

1819
01:20:33,633 --> 01:20:35,734
Hey, Charlie...

1820
01:20:35,867 --> 01:20:37,166
you don't have to rush off,
you know,

1821
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,767
you could stay for awhile.

1822
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,033
You could stay for lunch.

1823
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:41,066
Look.

1824
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,266
It doesn't matter
how Gemma feels about you,

1825
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,367
"Uncle B."

1826
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,000
It doesn't erase what happened.

1827
01:20:47,133 --> 01:20:48,333
I know it won't.

1828
01:20:48,467 --> 01:20:50,100
But it's lunch, Charlie.

1829
01:20:50,233 --> 01:20:51,333
It's a start.

1830
01:20:51,467 --> 01:20:52,567
Dad!

1831
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,367
Come on.

1832
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,367
Yeah, I'll be right there.

1833
01:21:02,266 --> 01:21:03,266
Lunch.

1834
01:21:06,767 --> 01:21:08,066
Hey.

1835
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,800
If she had to run,

1836
01:21:09,934 --> 01:21:12,900
I'm glad
she had somewhere to run to.

1837
01:21:13,033 --> 01:21:13,934
Dad, come on.

1838
01:21:14,066 --> 01:21:15,266
All right, I'm comin',

1839
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,800
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

1840
01:21:20,567 --> 01:21:22,300
Ohh...

1841
01:21:22,433 --> 01:21:23,600
We should put that
in the living room,

1842
01:21:23,734 --> 01:21:24,800
then everyone can see it.

1843
01:21:24,934 --> 01:21:26,333
For now, this is for us.

1844
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,066
Hey, I know
it's a few days early,

1845
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,066
but, um...

1846
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,633
happy anniversary.

1847
01:21:36,233 --> 01:21:37,900
Ben...

1848
01:21:38,033 --> 01:21:40,533
it's spectacular.

1849
01:21:46,567 --> 01:21:48,667
I love it.

1850
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,667
There's 10 different stones.

1851
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,300
One for each year?

1852
01:21:52,433 --> 01:21:53,967
Mm-hmm.

1853
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:56,500
Rose quartz
for unconditional love,

1854
01:21:56,633 --> 01:21:58,400
forgiveness, trust...

1855
01:21:58,533 --> 01:22:00,367
where we started.

1856
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,734
Aventurine--

1857
01:22:01,867 --> 01:22:05,166
harmony, prosperity.

1858
01:22:06,533 --> 01:22:08,200
And this year--

1859
01:22:08,333 --> 01:22:11,033
topaz.

1860
01:22:11,166 --> 01:22:12,934
Eternal romance.

1861
01:22:14,967 --> 01:22:17,200
You have a lot of those
on here.

1862
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:19,700
I'm hopeful.

1863
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:20,867
Me too.

1864
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,567
Would you?

1865
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:24,700
Mm-hmm.

1866
01:22:48,033 --> 01:22:49,667
Will you marry me again?

1867
01:22:59,033 --> 01:23:00,600
Today,
you have renewed

1868
01:23:00,734 --> 01:23:02,300
the promises and vows
you made to each other

1869
01:23:02,433 --> 01:23:03,900
on your wedding day.

1870
01:23:04,033 --> 01:23:05,934
So, it is with pleasure
that I conclude

1871
01:23:06,066 --> 01:23:08,000
the ceremony
that has joined you...

1872
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:11,900
...and forever binds you
as husband and wife.

1873
01:23:12,033 --> 01:23:15,200
I totally called it.
They're made for each other.

1874
01:23:15,333 --> 01:23:16,967
Please celebrate this renewal

1875
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,567
with a sign of affection

1876
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,033
and ongoing love
for one another.

1877
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:22,133
You may kiss!
