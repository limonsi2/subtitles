Our daddy is still sleeping.

36
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,900
We don't wanna wake him up.

37
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,092
You know how grumpy he gets
if he wakes up ahead of time.

38
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:36,903

50
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:24,893
I want you to meet someone.

51
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,850
See. Nothing.

52
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,450
She just sits there. Not a word.

00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,156
(Monica sighs)

54
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,880
- Good afternoon, Claire.
My name is Monica.

55
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,550
- She's here to help, Claire.

56
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,940
- Tell me, is it more convenient for you

57
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,283
to come into my office?

58
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,850
Well, would you rather have sessions here?

59
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,193
Okay. Then I'm gonna come here.

60
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,090
Would you like that?

61
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,430
It's not necessary for
us to discuss anything

62
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,680
you don't want to talk about, you know?

63
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,773
I'll just come here and
spend time with you. Okay?

64
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,293
Great. And how about we start today?

65
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,580
- So you'll take us?
- Yes.

66
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,840
- Oh, thank you.
- It's fine.

67
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,053
- All right. Please.

68
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,850
- Claire, do you want
Eric to stay with us?

69
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,430
Eric, you have to leave.

70
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,640
- It's family therapy. Well
the whole family's here.

71
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,600
- You heard her wishes.

72
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,677
- No, I didn't.

73
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,900
I haven't heard a thing.

74
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,200
- That's not gonna work.

75
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,265
We won't get any positive results.

76
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:07,300
(Eric scoffs)

77
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,470
- Claire, why don't you talk to me?

78
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,773
Please. Why don't you talk to me?

79
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:10,606
- Eric, you-
- No, tell me,

80
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:12,300
No, I shouldn't!
- Eric!

81
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,820
This is Claire's time.

82
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,600
If you want a session, you
should schedule an appointment.

83
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,433
- Fine.

84
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:23,937
(footsteps thudding)

85
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:27,850
(door opens and slams)

86
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,903
- Quite a temper.

87
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,203
Is he abusing you?

88
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,763
So did you ask for me?

89
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,213
- No.

90
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,353
- I see.

91
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,243
- What's there?

92
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,103
- It's your case.

93
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,153
It's so big already?

94
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,190
- No, this one's your medical.

95
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,233
- May I?

96
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,763
- Do you wanna talk?

97
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:16,350
- I do.

98
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,313
- About this?

99
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,783
- No.

100
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,873
- About your mom?

101
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,883
- No.

102
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,570
- What about your husband?

103
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,228
- He just can't stand
the silent treatment.

104
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:41,583
(Monica chuckles)

105
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,333

(phone ringing)

114
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:19,610
- [Mary Voicemail] Hello.
This is Mary Clarks.

115
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,490
Please leave me a message after the tone

116
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,670
and I'll call you back
as soon as possible.

117
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,300
Oh, and if this is Claire, don't worry.

118
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,068
I'm fine. I'm probably just asleep.

119
00:13:29,068 --> 00:13:29,910
(machine beeps)
- Mom, I know

120
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,110
what you're gonna say,

121
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,870
that I'm overreacting or something,

122
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,890
but anyways, I have a question.

123
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,513
Do you know how I can tell
if a hair is mine or not?

124
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,400
This is so stupid.

125
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,790
Ah, (chuckles) I don't even know how

126
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,670
to ask this question properly.

127
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,290
In conclusion, I will
only say that I found

128
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,500
someone else's hair in Eric's bag

129
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,363
and that he is cheating on me.

130
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,770
Mom, I know what you're going to say.

131
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,650
And please don't, okay?

132
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,700
I already caught him
lying to me several times.

133
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,230
(chuckles) What lies you ask?

134
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,180
Well, I will tell you.

135
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,060
First of all, he spends three
nights a week at the gym.

136
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,850
And second of all, he
keeps having these dinners

137
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,253
with clients which I'm
not even invited to.

138
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,310
No, of course he spends
every night in our bed

139
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,600
but still something is happening.

140
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,020
And I know it. I mean,
I can, I can feel it.

141
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,673
They say that a woman knows
when her man is betraying her.

142
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,203
Did you feel this way with Dad?

143
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,570
Well, why didn't you ever tell me?

144
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,270
Well, if you told me maybe I would...

145
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:46,603
(sighs) Yes, I don't know
what I would have done.

146
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,593
But who knows?

147
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,903
Maybe it would help.

148
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,002
Mom. Why didn't you...
(machine beeping)

149
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:02,752
(Claire sighing)

150
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:18,365
Oh my God.

151
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:25,248
(dial pad beeps)
(phone ringing)

152
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:26,680
- [Mary On Voicemail]
Hello. This is Mary Clarks.

153
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,570
Please leave me a message after the tone

154
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,760
and I'll call you back
as soon as possible.

155
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,400
Oh, and if this is Claire, don't worry.

156
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,201
I'm fine. I'm probably just asleep.

157
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,300
(machine beeps)
- You're right.

158
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,050
I just screwed myself up again. (chuckles)

159
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,873
I, the hair just seemed darker.

160
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,243
Call me when you wake up, please.

161
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,783
I, I had another bad dream.

162
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:59,208
(ominous music)
I ran and I ran

163
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,576
(footsteps pattering)
and my boy cried

164
00:16:02,576 --> 00:16:04,789
(baby crying)
and he cried.

165
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:06,396
(footsteps pattering)
(Claire panting)

166
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:08,770
(baby crying)

167
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,220
And then the cries got louder

168
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,520
and I couldn't find him.

169
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,393
I lost him. I don't know where I put him.

170
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,898
And then I'm getting closer,

171
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:29,410
(Claire panting)

172
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,860
but he's nowhere to be found.

173
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:37,614
(phone clicks)

174
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:41,780
(message dings)

175
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:56,234
Babe.

176
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:20,584
(phone vibrates)

177
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:24,827

00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,597
(Claire sighs)

182
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:37,460
(dial pad clicking)

183
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,293

(soft jazz music)

186
00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:14,860
- Are we celebrating something tonight?

187
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:17,127
How could I forget?

188
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,477
Oh, whoa, my God, look at you.

189
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:25,590
You look amazing.
(Claire laughing)

190
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,940
Wow. Let's take a look.

191
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,790
Hold on. Hold on.

192
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:30,292
(whistles) Whoo.

193
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:33,080
(Claire laughing)
What is going on?

194
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,390
Ah. Why don't we just
skip the main course?

195
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,757
We'll go right to the dessert.

196
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:38,800
- No, we should enjoy it fully.

197
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,970
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

198
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,204
- And how long have you been
enjoying it fully without me?

199
00:19:42,204 --> 00:19:44,060
- (laughing) Sit.

200
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,040
- Okay. My God.

201
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,873
Whoo.

202
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,670
(sighs) I actually just
got done with dinner

203
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,270
but how much can you eat

204
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,116
when you're talking the whole time, right?

205
00:19:54,116 --> 00:19:56,010
(Claire chuckles)

206
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,943
- Do not spoil the atmosphere.

207
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:01,767
(phone and keys bang)

208
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,770
(soft jazz music continues)

209
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,620
How was your day?

210
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,963
- Good. How was your day?

211
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:16,793
- (chuckling) Fantastic.

212
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:20,906
(Eric chuckles)

213
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,280
So let's have a drink.

214
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,113
- Let's drink.

215
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:35,092
(Claire gulping)

216
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:36,415
(glass clacks)

217
00:20:36,415 --> 00:20:39,480
(Claire sighs)

218
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,623
What happened?

219
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:46,173
- (chuckles) Any ideas?

220
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,533
What day is today?

221
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,032
- Thursday.

222
00:20:54,032 --> 00:20:56,790
- No, I mean, what day is today?

223
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,913
- Ah, it's March 26th.

224
00:21:00,523 --> 00:21:02,127
(utensil clinks)

225
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,627
(Eric sighs)

226
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,287
- Is something wrong?

227
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:10,787
(Eric spits)

228
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,563
Look at me.

229
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,023
Look at me!

230
00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:21,890
- What exactly are you celebrating?

231
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,457
- Why just me. We.

232
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,270
- No, I am not celebrating this with you.

233
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,021
(chair slams)

234
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,033
(keys jangling)
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

235
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:32,113
No, no, no, no, no!

236
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:34,534
No, don't go, don't go, don't go, please!

237
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:35,729
Please, please, don't! I'm sorry!

238
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,318
I'm sorry! I didn't mean it!

239
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:39,686
(panting) I'll be better.

240
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:41,073
I'll be better.
- Okay.

241
00:21:41,073 --> 00:21:44,177
(soft jazz music continues)

242
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,857
Do you wanna call Monica?

243
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:49,212
Okay, I'm gonna call Monica.

244
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:54,745
(dial pad clicking)

245
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,836
(Eric sighs)

246
00:22:38,027 --> 00:22:39,965
What time is it?

247
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:41,382
- It's too early.

248
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,987
I'm just fixing your pillow.

249
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:44,820
- Mm.

250
00:23:09,403 --> 00:23:11,986
(phone clicks)

251
00:23:43,527 --> 00:23:45,879
(crickets chirping)

252
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:48,962
(footsteps thudding)

253
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:07,598
(pants unzip)

254
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:10,015
(Eric sighs)

255
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,091
(watch clicks)

256
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:18,008
(watch clattering)

257
00:24:25,468 --> 00:24:27,968
(Eric sighs)

258
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,473
Are you asleep?

259
00:24:54,983 --> 00:24:57,950
You could respond. You know?

260
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,123
I had a very difficult day.

261
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,743
- As every day.

262
00:25:01,743 --> 00:25:04,333
- Well gotta pay the
bills somehow, don't we?

263
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,233
- I missed you.

264
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:24,488
(Eric sighs)

265
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,453
And you?

266
00:25:29,701 --> 00:25:32,003
- (sighs) Of course I missed you.

267
00:25:38,673 --> 00:25:41,066
(Eric chuckles)

268
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:43,160
(Eric sighs)

269
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,355
- How was your day?

270
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:45,783
- (sighs) Fine.

271
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,410
- Well, you said it was difficult.

272
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,523
- Yeah, like everyday.

273
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,939
- I want you.
(Eric chuckles)

274
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:03,772
- Mm.

275
00:26:06,777 --> 00:26:08,323
I'm so tired, babe.

276
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,166
- Please?

277
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,150
I really want you.

278
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,880
- I'm all sweaty and smelly.

279
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,270
I should really take a
shower before we do this.

280
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,728
In the morning.

281
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:23,624
- A shower will only take a
couple of minutes. Come on.

282
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:26,374
(Eric chuckles)

283
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,913
- Let's just do it in the
morning. I'm so relaxed right now.

284
00:26:31,952 --> 00:26:34,000
- (chuckles) Well I love you

285
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,397
and I don't care if
you're sweaty and smelly.

286
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:39,230
(Eric chuckling)

287
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,173
- Come on, babe. Tomorrow.

288
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:48,254
(Eric sighs)

289
00:26:48,254 --> 00:26:51,120
- Well you're always in a hurry
to leave me in the mornings.

290
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,953
- Mm.

291
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,180
- You're always in a hurry to leave me.

292
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,830
- That's not fair.

293
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,823
Okay. I'm working for two here.

294
00:27:02,817 --> 00:27:05,470
- (scoffs) What do you want from me?

295
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,020
You want me to go back to work?

296
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,363
- That would be nice. You know?

297
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,150
Your place is still your place.

298
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:17,334
- Did you contact them?

299
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:26,870
- (sighs) Your boss called me.

300
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,840
He just wanted to check up
and see how things were.

301
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,301
He wanted to see how
you were feeling. Okay?

302
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:32,134
- And?

303
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:39,040
- And I told him that you

304
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,463
were feeling, ah, better.

305
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,143
- (chuckles) Better?

306
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,570
So you think that I feel better?

307
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,530
- I don't know.
I'm just ready...

308
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,652
Just ready to go back to what?

309
00:27:57,652 --> 00:28:00,230
- I don't know. I just thought
it would be nice for you

310
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,450
to get out of the house, you know,

311
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,680
and, and get your mind off of-

312
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,060
- So I should just forget about everything

313
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,110
as if nothing happened, right?

314
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,517
- I don't know.

315
00:28:08,517 --> 00:28:11,410
Do as you see fit. Okay?

316
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,680
- No, no, you tell me.

317
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,300
You tell me what I need to do.

318
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,050
You know better!

319
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,790
- I wanna go to sleep. Okay?

320
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,210
And you're not understanding
what I'm saying.

321
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,780
So please just lie down.

322
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:32,842
(Claire scoffs)

323
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,793
- How can you be okay?

324
00:28:43,283 --> 00:28:44,866
How can you be okay

325
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,483
when I'm suffocating?

326
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,710
How can you be so insensitive

327
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,795
that we can't even share a word about it?

328
00:28:58,795 --> 00:29:01,686
- About what, Claire? Huh?

329
00:29:01,686 --> 00:29:03,050
Because there is an unbearable amount

330
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,983
of its going on right now!

331
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,270
God, we need to live a normal life

332
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,800
and not in a fucking cemetery!

333
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,093
We need to live a normal life, Claire!

334
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,130
I love you and the only reason

335
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,760
I haven't grabbed my shit
and left is because of that.

336
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,260
- But?
- But what?

337
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,270
Huh? Say it.

338
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,810
But what? But what?

339
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,310
You went an entire month,

340
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,630
an entire month without talking to me

341
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,770
and not a fucking single word, Claire.

342
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,020
You didn't say anything.

343
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,810
And I thought, I thought
that was horrible.

344
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,070
I thought that was so bad.

345
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,680
But now look this? Look at this.

346
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,360
You're, you're, you're constantly talking,

347
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,900
even in your sleep.

348
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,400
And at work you're calling me

349
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,010
and you're calling me
every 15 minutes, Claire.

350
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:49,290
And if I don't answer right
away, you're texting me!

351
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,713
And if I don't answer that you call again.

352
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,130
And I don't know, I don't know how long

353
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:55,963
you can do this to me.

354
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:57,900
I don't know how long
you can do this to me

355
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,750
because I need some fucking peace!

356
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,660
Okay? I need some peace
in my own home, Claire.

357
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,663
Fuck!

358
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,590
I am not a clown.

359
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,120
Do I look like a fucking clown?

360
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,670
I am not a clown!

361
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,450
I am not some fucking
monkey that's gonna jump

362
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,030
when you say jump.

363
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,930
- I don't do that!

364
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,920
- It's either talk or fuck with you. huh?

365
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,690
You either wanna talk or you wanna fuck.

366
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,990
And it's not even good!

367
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,630
Look at me!

368
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:32,940
I'm fucking tired!

369
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,243
And I'm going to sleep
on the fucking couch!

370
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:40,671
(melancholy music)

371
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,650
(Claire sobbing)

372
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,657
(phone ringing)

373
00:31:17,254 --> 00:31:18,680
- [Mary On Voicemail]
Hello. This is Mary Clarks.

374
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,570
Please leave me a message after the tone

375
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,780
and I'll call you back
as soon as possible.

376
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,380
Oh, and if this is Claire, don't worry.

377
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,360
I'm fine.

378
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,965
I'm probably just asleep.

379
00:31:27,965 --> 00:31:29,280
(machine beeps)
- I told you

380
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,113
this is it.

381
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,263
Yes.

382
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,440
No. Please, please, Mom.

383
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,283
Tell me how can I save my marriage?

384
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,827
Well, what can you tell me?

385
00:31:44,827 --> 00:31:46,723
You couldn't make it work with Dad.

386
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,153
You don't want me to be happy.

387
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:56,160
(Claire scoffs)

388
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,833
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

389
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,050
Yeah, no, you're right.

390
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,400
You're right. You're right.

391
00:32:06,404 --> 00:32:08,553
(sighs) A woman should always be a woman.

392
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,073
Yeah.

393
00:32:12,612 --> 00:32:15,693
(chuckling) Who would ever want this?

394
00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:20,387
(phone clicks)

395
00:32:20,387 --> 00:32:23,137
(birds chirping)

396
00:32:40,703 --> 00:32:42,290
(baby crying)

397
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,463
Hush, my love.

398
00:32:46,176 --> 00:32:49,123
It's your mommy. Mommy remembers you.

399
00:32:49,123 --> 00:32:49,956
Mommy loves you.

400
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:54,617
(baby cooing)

401
00:32:54,617 --> 00:32:56,303
And Mommy loves your Daddy.

402
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,168
And there is no way that we can lose him.

403
00:32:59,168 --> 00:33:01,668
(baby cooing)

404
00:33:15,456 --> 00:33:18,456
(suspenseful music)

405
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:38,750
(shower spraying)

406
00:33:49,873 --> 00:33:51,577
- I don't know why you
don't just go with me.

407
00:33:51,577 --> 00:33:54,490
- And how exactly do you
think I'm gonna do that?

408
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:59,330
- Well, you would go upstairs
and get ready quickly

409
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,650
- Mm-hmm.
- And we'd go.

410
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:02,963
Preferably using your feet.

411
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,130
- Come on. You're out every evening.

412
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,535
- Well, you like this body, don't ya?

413
00:34:11,535 --> 00:34:13,283
- (chuckles) Yes.
- Yes.

414
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,370
- Ah, seriously, I don't
know how you do it.

415
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,683
You here all day by yourself.

416
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,660
Come on. Let's train together.

417
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,260
- I have so much to do.

418
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:31,040
- Oh yeah? Like what?

419
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,928
- Why don't you just
take me out on a date?

420
00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:36,064
- (laughing) We're married.

421
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:38,240
I don't have to do that anymore.

422
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,900
I'm kidding. Baby.

423
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,400
Baby, baby. Exactly, baby.

424
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,293
What about that?

425
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:47,634
- What about that?

426
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:50,560
(soft piano music)

427
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,473
- Nothing, I had a few bad days.

428
00:34:52,473 --> 00:34:53,306
It's fine.

429
00:34:57,299 --> 00:34:58,299
- Okay. Hey.

430
00:35:04,149 --> 00:35:05,066
I love you.

431
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:08,963
- Really?

432
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,483
- I swear on my abs.

433
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,490
All six of them.

434
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,703
- Go.

435
00:35:19,098 --> 00:35:20,430
- (sighs) You sure?

436
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,530
- Yes.
- All right.

437
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,363
- Go.

438
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,540
Hey, wait.
- Hey?

439
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,570
- Um, I read an article

440
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,710
that we can bring intimacy
back into our relationship

441
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,710
if you just carry me to bed every night.

442
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:38,533
(Eric laughing)

443
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,053
- Where did you hear that?

444
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,398
- Go.

445
00:35:44,398 --> 00:35:46,190
- (chuckles) Okay, baby.

446
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,632
I'm gonna carry you. You
get ready. (chuckling)

447
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:54,632
(water spraying)
(suspenseful music)

448
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:22,122
(birds chirping)

449
00:36:22,122 --> 00:36:23,622
- What do you see?

450
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,433
- It's obvious.

451
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,573
The woman.

452
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,593
- The woman?

453
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,203
- Free woman.

454
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,020
- Who is a free woman for you.

455
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,653
- Do you feel like a free woman, Monica?

456
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,930
- I could say that.

457
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,423
- But?
- There is no but.

458
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:55,503
- Oh. Then I envy you.

459
00:36:58,077 --> 00:36:59,573
- Don't you feel free?

460
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,273
- I felt like that before.

461
00:37:07,906 --> 00:37:10,273
(sighs) Years later, here I am,

462
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:13,883
scared,

463
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,173
hopeless,

464
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,383
useless.

465
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,140
- I wouldn't use those words.

466
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,673
- And what words would you use?

467
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:36,010
- Let's see, tired, confused, and, um...

468
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,863
- I only feel pity for myself.

469
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,723
You know I only have you?

470
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,637
I mean, there's only you for me.

471
00:37:58,596 --> 00:37:59,930
I don't have anybody else.

472
00:38:07,028 --> 00:38:08,528
God, I'm pathetic.

473
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,420
- You named the qualities
which as you believe

474
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,313
belong to you now, what about before?

475
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,223
- Oh, I was fearless.

476
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,303
Full of life.

477
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:25,667
In love.

478
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,180
- Do you love your husband?

479
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,520
- Of course I love my husband.

480
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,333
But I can't give my love to him alone.

481
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,393
- Who else?

482
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,232
- If I were free as before,

483
00:38:49,232 --> 00:38:50,600
(soft piano music)

484
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,980
I wouldn't suppress my desires.

485
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,813
I wouldn't

486
00:39:01,695 --> 00:39:03,278
ignore my impulses.

487
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,837
- It's not right.

488
00:39:10,837 --> 00:39:12,170
- I don't care.

489
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,650
There's a connection between us.

490
00:39:18,628 --> 00:39:19,878
I can feel it.

491
00:39:23,015 --> 00:39:25,932
Why did you decide to take my case?

492
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:29,149
Why did you come here?

493
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,981
(both laughing)

494
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:29,281
(Monica moaning)

495
00:40:31,248 --> 00:40:32,415
- And who else?

496
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,540
- Only you.

497
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,906
To show you how free I am.

498
00:40:37,906 --> 00:40:40,739
(shower spraying)

499
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,137
- Claire?
- Oh.

500
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,493
- Claire?

501
00:40:55,617 --> 00:40:57,143
Claire, do you hear me?

502
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,454
- Hmm?

503
00:40:59,454 --> 00:41:02,887
(Monica groaning)
To show how free I am.

504
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:05,937
- You wanted to show me something.

505
00:41:08,082 --> 00:41:08,915
- What?

506
00:41:09,898 --> 00:41:11,210
- You left our conversation

507
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,760
and you mumbled about
wanting to show me something.

508
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,813
- Nevermind.

509
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,510
Why did you take my case?

510
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,700
- I took your case because
I wanted to be close to you.

511
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,749
I agreed to come here 'cause
I wanted us to be alone.

512
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:29,199
Because I wanted to help you.

513
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,740
- Not that.

514
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,440
- Because I knew I could help you.

515
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,773
- Why did you agree to come here?

516
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,100
- Because you refused
to come to my office.

517
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,775
- No, no.

518
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:46,610
(dishes clacking)

519
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,460
- Who else should you give your love to?

520
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,430
- Do you want a coffee?

521
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,930
- Claire, we're not done here.

522
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,810
- I wanna stop now.

523
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,660
- Who else should you give your love to?

524
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,910
- I'm tired. Okay?

525
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,680
- Who else, Claire.

526
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,903
This needs to be said.

527
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,920
- I want you to leave my house.

528
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,170
We're finished for today.

529
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,084
(Claire gasps)

530
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:34,840
- You know you can trust me, right?

531
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,140
- What are you doing here?

532
00:42:37,105 --> 00:42:38,740
- Are you all right?

533
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,040
Come sit.

534
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,000
- You shouldn't be here.

535
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,620
Get out of here.

536
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,640
- Calm down.

537
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,456
- Get out or I'll call the police.

538
00:42:48,456 --> 00:42:51,456
(suspenseful music)

539
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:58,746
- Oh, hey.
(Monica sighs)

540
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:01,060
How was today?
- We need to talk.

541
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,100
- Ah, okay. Yeah, let's
just, come on inside-

542
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:03,933
- No, listen.

543
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,833
Your wife is losing the
boundaries of reality.

544
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:12,833
(toothbrush scraping)
(water running)

545
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,500
No, you're not listening to me.

546
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,530
Do you think I'm joking?

547
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,420
- No, I don't think you're joking. Okay?

548
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,810
I just, I don't think
that this is critical.

549
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:38,110
You know, things just
started getting better.

550
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,740
- This is a problem.

551
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,610
And it's not going to get
solved by ignoring it.

552
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:45,740
If you don't see it, it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

553
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,410
You've completely stepped aside.

554
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:48,523
It's not right.

555
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,570
Why did you stop keeping the diary?

556
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:53,120
- Well that's why she has
the meetings with you.

557
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,830
- No, look, I can't keep
coming here anymore.

558
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,240
- Why?
- It only fuels

559
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,440
her disease.

560
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,960
She feels too comfortable at home.

561
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,220
You need to come to my office

562
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,680
and you must bring her in person.

563
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,320
In this setting, she
assumes that I'm her friend.

564
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,390
- Okay. So what's wrong with that?

565
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:10,980
She's creating a trusting relationship

566
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,717
with her therapist, right?

567
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:14,410
- I'm not her friend.

568
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:15,920
She's my patient.

569
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,814
(Eric sighs)

570
00:44:18,814 --> 00:44:22,064
(hair dryer whirring)

571
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,323
- He's so cute.

572
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:41,103
He's literally the most
beautiful baby in the world.

573
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,883
Mom, how can he ignore him?

574
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,433
I don't understand.

575
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,290
You're right.

576
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,933
Parental instinct does
happen much later in men.

577
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:01,010
He just needs to spend
more time with the kid.

578
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:02,560
- [Eric] Babe, I'm home.

579
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,480
- Okay. I love you.

580
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,733
I gotta go. Bye.

581
00:45:06,097 --> 00:45:07,593
(Eric sighs)
(footsteps thudding)

582
00:45:07,593 --> 00:45:08,426
- Hey.
- Hey.

583
00:45:09,613 --> 00:45:10,891
- What were you doing in there?

584
00:45:10,891 --> 00:45:12,510
- Mm.

585
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,343
- Oh. Mm.

586
00:45:19,326 --> 00:45:20,159
Mm.

587
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:22,284
Mm.

588
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:27,040
Well someone's in a mood.

589
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,873
- You hungry?

590
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,983
- I ate already.

591
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,823
- Oh.

592
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:36,655
- I didn't know there was gonna be food.

593
00:45:36,655 --> 00:45:39,280
- Well, then there's always gonna be food.

594
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,243
- Oh, okay.

595
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,440
- You go change.
- Okay.

596
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,790
- And I'm gonna bring
us some wine and cheese.

597
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:47,215
- Wine and cheese?
- Mm-hmm.

598
00:45:47,215 --> 00:45:48,048
- Okay.

599
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,330
Wow.

600
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,163
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

601
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:56,890
- Wine and cheese.

602
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,620
- Hey, you wanna watch something?

603
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,053
- Sure. Yeah, just something light.

604
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:11,520
- You know, I've been thinking for a while

605
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,333
that I don't need therapy anymore.

606
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,193
- Really?

607
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,403
- Yeah. I feel much better.

608
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,633
- What does Monica have to say about it?

609
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:24,523
- Who cares?

610
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,978
I feel great.

611
00:46:27,978 --> 00:46:29,950
(soft piano music)

612
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,600
Besides, she's not gonna let me go.

613
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,223
It's probably just a money thing.

614
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,590
- Red?
(wine pouring)

615
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:37,870
- Of course.

616
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:38,703
- Since when?

617
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,084
- Um, (clears throat) it was on sale.

618
00:46:43,084 --> 00:46:45,310
(wine pouring)

619
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:48,010
- That's my girl. (chuckles)
- Ooh, careful, careful.

620
00:46:49,758 --> 00:46:52,925
(Eric clears throat)

621
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,590
- So...(chuckles)

622
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,393
I got a call from the funeral home.

623
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,270
They said they didn't
receive last month's check.

624
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:07,572
Did you, did you send it?

625
00:47:07,572 --> 00:47:08,405
(wine spilling)
- Oh my God!

626
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:09,738
- Oh, goodness.
- I'm so clumsy.

627
00:47:09,738 --> 00:47:11,499
I, oh, Jesus.

628
00:47:11,499 --> 00:47:14,100
Uh, (chuckles) um, I probably just forgot.

629
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,400
Can you just do it for me?

630
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:19,200
- Claire, that's really
your responsibility.

631
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,660
- Please.

632
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,093
Just do it for me. Okay?

633
00:47:23,921 --> 00:47:25,581
You know I'm not good with numbers.

634
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:27,340
(towel scratching)

635
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,340
- You're in financing. What do you mean?

636
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,393
Claire?

637
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:35,677
Claire?

638
00:47:35,677 --> 00:47:38,594
(towel scratching)

639
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,209
- Ow!

640
00:47:43,209 --> 00:47:44,893
Ah, fuck.

641
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:51,965
(Claire scoffs and sighs)

642
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:00,050
- What did you say?
- Your mom was there.

643
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,560
She, she, she couldn't stay till the end

644
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,850
because she felt so bad.

645
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:03,990
- You're lying.
- Claire, and, and,

646
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,470
and soon she...

647
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:06,303
- No.

648
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,740
- Claire, your boss was there. Okay?

649
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,950
He showed up and he gave you time off

650
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:13,561
so you'd get ahold of yourself.

651
00:48:13,561 --> 00:48:14,913
- Oh, fuck.

652
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:22,272
(Claire sighing)

653
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:40,190
(suspenseful music)

654
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:45,807
(door opens)

655
00:48:45,807 --> 00:48:48,557
(keys jangling)

656
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,563
- Leave already. I'm all right.

657
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:56,291
(engine revving)

658
00:48:58,325 --> 00:49:00,825
(lock clicks)

659
00:49:11,425 --> 00:49:13,572
Oh God. (sobbing)

660
00:49:13,572 --> 00:49:14,822
Oh God! Oh God!

661
00:49:16,226 --> 00:49:20,298
Oh God, forgive me! (sobbing)

662
00:49:20,298 --> 00:49:22,851
(somber music)

663
00:49:22,851 --> 00:49:24,434
I didn't want that.

664
00:49:27,046 --> 00:49:28,629
I didn't want that.

665
00:49:30,828 --> 00:49:33,911
Oh my God. This was everything to me.

666
00:49:36,899 --> 00:49:39,066
(sobbing)

667
00:49:41,507 --> 00:49:44,140
I didn't, I didn't do it on purpose!

668
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,356
Oh my God!

669
00:49:45,356 --> 00:49:47,689
(screaming)

670
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,270
He's wrong! He's wrong!

671
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,980
I didn't want it at first.

672
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:01,280
But I thought maybe it was just too early.

673
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,910
Oh God!

674
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:05,057
Oh my God, forgive me!

675
00:50:05,057 --> 00:50:08,307
(sobbing hysterically)

676
00:50:19,539 --> 00:50:21,956
Our father who art in heaven,

677
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,110
hallowed by thy name.

678
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:27,075
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

679
00:50:27,075 --> 00:50:29,395
on earth as it is in heaven.

680
00:50:29,395 --> 00:50:32,021
(whimpering)

681
00:50:32,021 --> 00:50:32,854
Oh my God!

682
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:37,931
Give us this...

683
00:50:44,983 --> 00:50:47,090
Give us this day our daily bread

684
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:50,533
And forgive us our
trespasses as we forgive...

685
00:50:50,533 --> 00:50:53,233
As we forgive those who
trespass against us.

686
00:50:58,742 --> 00:51:00,392
(sighs) Let's do something nicer.

687
00:51:29,383 --> 00:51:31,680
- Hey, hey, you.

688
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,920
Come on. What are you doing?

689
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,920
You need to stop running
around the house and sit.

690
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,050
- I spend all day in this chair.

691
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:40,485
- Yeah, you look great in
it and you can have it.

692
00:51:40,485 --> 00:51:43,158
- All right.
- Okay, all right.

693
00:51:43,158 --> 00:51:44,653
- Hi.
- Look at you.

694
00:51:44,653 --> 00:51:46,030
You're glowing.

695
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,948
How's my baby? Huh?

696
00:51:47,948 --> 00:51:50,397
How's my little guy? You okay in there?

697
00:51:50,397 --> 00:51:52,710
Mm. (laughing)

698
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,250
- He's gonna be able to reply soon.

699
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,300
- Yeah.

700
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,900
It's going to be a little
while before he can

701
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,697
understand what we're saying.

702
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:01,783
Oh, mama.

703
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,753
Hmm?

704
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,373
Pretty soon.

705
00:52:09,657 --> 00:52:11,207
Ee, so close.

706
00:52:11,207 --> 00:52:12,880
- You can't be scared.

707
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,144
- Ah, I can be scared.

708
00:52:14,144 --> 00:52:15,500
(both laughing)

709
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,972
- I read an article yesterday.

710
00:52:16,972 --> 00:52:18,860
- Mm-hmm.
- Actually, what do you think?

711
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,780
Where do birth pains score on the list?

712
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,870
- What?

713
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:24,323
- The list.
- Yeah.

714
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,140
- The score number two.

715
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,533
Guess what number one is?

716
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:30,208
- What?

717
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:33,223
- The pain you feel when your
limbs are severed by a bomb.

718
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,133
Mm-hmm.
- Oh my God.

719
00:52:35,133 --> 00:52:36,523
- And I have to go through this.

720
00:52:36,523 --> 00:52:37,715
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

721
00:52:37,715 --> 00:52:38,617
- Ah.

722
00:52:38,617 --> 00:52:39,780
- Oh.
- Oh.

723
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,763
- Oh.
- Oh, what?

724
00:52:40,763 --> 00:52:42,150
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

725
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:43,047
- Just kicking. Just kicking.

726
00:52:43,047 --> 00:52:44,635
- Just kicking? He's kicking?

727
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:48,000
- Yeah, it tickles.
- Oh, he's excited for Daddy.

728
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,610
Kick again, buddy! Kick for Daddy!

729
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:51,792
Come on!

730
00:52:51,792 --> 00:52:54,410
- (laughs) Stop screaming.

731
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,050
Let me, let me get on the floor.

732
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:56,883
- Okay.
- He kicks more

733
00:52:56,883 --> 00:52:57,820
when I'm laying down.
- All right,

734
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:58,653
let's get you down.

735
00:52:58,653 --> 00:53:00,434
Oh, my baby.

736
00:53:00,434 --> 00:53:01,710
(Claire sighs)
Here we go, easy.

737
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:02,783
Let me get the dress.

738
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,470
- Oh my God. I am so ready.

739
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:07,303
- Mm.

740
00:53:07,303 --> 00:53:08,620
- Ready, ready, ready.

741
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,640
- Oh.
- Ah, severed limbs or not.

742
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,610
- I got ya.
- I'm ready.

743
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:14,370
- Okay, okay, easy, easy.

744
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:16,320
Watch your head on the desk.

745
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,128
Give me this. You good?
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

746
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,069
- How are those feet?
- Good, okay.

747
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:22,050
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

748
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:24,714
Stay. I'll go get a pillow, okay?

749
00:53:24,714 --> 00:53:25,907
(Claire sighs)

750
00:53:25,907 --> 00:53:27,110
(soft piano music)

751
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:29,120
Oh, here we are.

752
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,910
There we go.

753
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:31,743
- All right.
- Okay.

754
00:53:31,743 --> 00:53:32,743
- There we go.

755
00:53:33,858 --> 00:53:36,570
- Oh, that's it, that's the spot.

756
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:37,600
- So what did you do?

757
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,093
- Oh, what did I do? What?

758
00:53:40,725 --> 00:53:41,558
- What did you do?
- What?

759
00:53:41,558 --> 00:53:44,483
- Oh, no, I didn't do, I was, ah, nothing.

760
00:53:45,668 --> 00:53:47,010
- Please?
- No.

761
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:48,970
That's my little secret.
You're not gonna know.

762
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:50,790
- I'll tell you if you want.

763
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:52,900
- Okay.
- I got you a T-shirt

764
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,126
that says, Best Dad Ever."

765
00:53:54,126 --> 00:53:55,500
- (chuckles) Jeez.

766
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,400
- That you can wear when
you go walking with the boy.

767
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,740
- That's very sweet of you,
but a little bit too soon.

768
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,020
- Oh yeah.

769
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,120
Yeah. You're right.

770
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,664
Especially since you said you
wouldn't change any diapers.

771
00:54:06,664 --> 00:54:07,520
- No. No.

772
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,193
I just think that there's
a person for that,

773
00:54:09,193 --> 00:54:12,610
that we can pay that's more
qualified to deal with that...

774
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,700
- You're joking, right?

775
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,500
- Absolutely not. I will, I will-

776
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,940
- But you said, we agreed.

777
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,030
- No, mm-mm.

778
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:20,383
- No.
- I signed nothing.

779
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,853
- The dad has to take part.

780
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,340
- Okay. Okay.

781
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:30,958
I will change one diaper per week.

782
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:32,170
- No!

783
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,680
What if I have to go somewhere

784
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,330
and you have to be alone with the kid?

785
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:37,310
He's just gonna sit in a stinky diaper?

786
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,510
- Okay. Well, first of
all, where are you going?

787
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,423
And second, why are you leaving us?

788
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,393
- Well, maybe I have to do my nails.

789
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:48,496
Actually, yeah. I'm gonna do my nails.

790
00:54:48,496 --> 00:54:51,410
- Oh, the nail, okay. Okay.

791
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:53,230
Easy-peasy. That takes an hour tops.

792
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,320
I can let him sit.

793
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,260
- Hands and feet.
- Okay.

794
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,732
- Plus the traffic.

795
00:54:57,732 --> 00:54:59,519
And I'm gonna need a coffee.

796
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:00,352
- Oh.
- That's like

797
00:55:00,352 --> 00:55:01,770
three to four hours at least.

798
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:02,740
- Okay. Fine.

799
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:06,163
I will change him while
you're gone for that one time.

800
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:10,850
- No, no, no!
(Eric chuckles)

801
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,520
- Fine, I will change all the diapers.

802
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,000
- You don't get it, do you?

803
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,790
You're gonna fall in love with
your son when you see him.

804
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:20,450
- I know.

805
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,333
- And his poops are gonna
smell like roses to you.

806
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:27,530
- (laughs) You're exaggerating.

807
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:30,500
No poop smells like roses.

808
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,890
- Look, I'm voluntarily
agreeing to go through this pain

809
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:36,890
so you can change half of the diapers.

810
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:39,590
- Ah, fun fact. That Pain?

811
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,800
Orgasms. Yeah.

812
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,500
When you're going to birth
all of the endorphins,

813
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:48,870
they, they act up and, and
those, those are orgasms,

814
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:52,040
but the contractions are,
are covering them up.

815
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,490
So you don't realize it.

816
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:54,930
You just feel pain.

817
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:57,440
So I mean, that's why the baby and the mom

818
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,880
like have such a good
connection after birth.

819
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,840
- Hmm.
- Yeah, I'm jealous

820
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:06,130
'cause I'm just gonna
to be in the hallway,

821
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,410
pacing back and forth,

822
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:09,430
waiting for this to all be over,

823
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:10,970
banging my head against the wall.

824
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:13,160
- What? The hallway?

825
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,950
- Yeah. Where else would I be?

826
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:17,170
- You're gonna be in the room with me.

827
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:18,123
- What?
- Yeah.

828
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:20,840
I need you to hold my hand.

829
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,460
Hold my leg.

830
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,940
- Seriously?
- Help me push.

831
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:25,793
- Oh God.

832
00:56:28,872 --> 00:56:30,843
(Claire laughing)

833
00:56:30,843 --> 00:56:34,071
(suspenseful music)

834
00:56:34,071 --> 00:56:34,904
- Oh shit.

835
00:56:51,857 --> 00:56:53,930
(Claire laughing)

836
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:55,830
- Oh, don't, don't. That's not funny.

837
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,508
I don't wanna, no.

838
00:56:57,508 --> 00:57:00,550
Oh, don't do that. Oh.

839
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,904
- Come on, I wanna have sex
with my husband after that.

840
00:57:02,904 --> 00:57:03,737
- I want you to have sex
with your husband after that.

841
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:06,740
- All right. Help me up.

842
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,074
- Are we having sex right now?

843
00:57:08,074 --> 00:57:10,670
(Claire scoffs)

844
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,750
- I can't stay in one
position for too long.

845
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:13,720
Come on.

846
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,940
- Okay, yeah. Let's do this.

847
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,773
Here.
- Oh.

848
00:57:17,946 --> 00:57:19,007
- Mm.
- Oh God, okay.

849
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:21,744
- Gotcha, I gotcha.
- All right.

850
00:57:21,744 --> 00:57:22,674
- Okay.
- Okay.

851
00:57:22,674 --> 00:57:24,225
- Here we go, yeah?
- Yep.

852
00:57:24,225 --> 00:57:26,140
- All right.
(Claire sighs)

853
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,210
- You know, you're gonna fight me

854
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,861
for the right to change the diaper.

855
00:57:28,861 --> 00:57:30,063
- (laughs) Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

856
00:57:30,063 --> 00:57:32,622
- Well that's a fight
I am willing to lose.

857
00:57:32,622 --> 00:57:34,710
(Claire chuckles)
Here we go.

858
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,330
- Do I look like a goddess?

859
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:38,843
- You, you kidding me? Yes,
of course, you look like-

860
00:57:38,843 --> 00:57:41,280
- I feel like a goddess.
- You are the goddess.

861
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,418
Goddess of God's.

862
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:43,600
- That's why I like this dress.

863
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,260
- This, this dress is amazing.

864
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,650
All right. Ready?

865
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:50,310
Twirl, loop, hold.

866
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:51,500
I got ya, I got ya.

867
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,992
And dip.
- Oh God, oh God!

868
00:57:52,992 --> 00:57:56,312
- Oh, you're so light.
- Oh, okay.

869
00:57:56,312 --> 00:57:57,145
Yeah, yeah.

870
00:57:57,145 --> 00:57:59,243
- You're the lightest pregnant,

871
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:01,565
pregnancy baby ever.
(Claire laughing)

872
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:03,036
Here we go.

873
00:58:03,036 --> 00:58:04,655
(Claire sighs)
Huh?

874
00:58:04,655 --> 00:58:06,697
- Oh, baby.
- And feet.

875
00:58:06,697 --> 00:58:08,410
- Okay.
- The feet, the feet,

876
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,086
the beautiful feet.
- Yeah, thank you.

877
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:11,650
- There we go.

878
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:12,533
- Oh baby.

879
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,610
- What?
- I wanna eat now.

880
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,370
- Oh, of course.

881
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,486
What would you like to eat?

882
00:58:19,486 --> 00:58:21,569
- Hmm, I want ice cream.

883
00:58:22,491 --> 00:58:23,324
- That is a good choice.

884
00:58:23,324 --> 00:58:25,380
- Mm-hmm.
- I second that.

885
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,171
Ice cream coming up.

886
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:28,004
Mm-hmm.

887
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,690
- Oh wait, wait, wait, wait.

888
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:33,563
- Yes, Madame?

889
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,910
- And a sausage.

890
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:36,743
- Sausage?

891
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,100
- Do we have any ice cream
that tastes like sausage?

892
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:46,950
- No, but I will scoop out some ice cream

893
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,210
and instead of chocolate
chips, I'll put in sausage.

894
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,043
Deal?

895
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:55,450
- No, keep it separate.

896
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,853
- I hear and I obey.

897
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,493
Coming up.

898
00:59:08,923 --> 00:59:11,256
(lips kiss)

899
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:19,583
(birds chirping)

900
00:59:56,077 --> 00:59:59,077
(suspenseful music)

901
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:04,659
(monitor buzzing)

902
01:01:06,902 --> 01:01:09,402
(baby crying)

903
01:01:13,082 --> 01:01:15,915
(monitor beeping)

904
01:01:34,451 --> 01:01:36,951
(baby crying)

905
01:01:41,696 --> 01:01:44,529
(monitor beeping)

906
01:01:45,822 --> 01:01:48,322
(baby crying)

907
01:01:54,642 --> 01:01:57,225
(baby crying)

908
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,683
Baby, what are you doing?

909
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,967
- Oh, thank God you're here.

910
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:25,253
Can you help me? I can't figure this out.

911
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:34,220
- Honey.

912
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:36,340
- Hmm?
- What are you doing?

913
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:37,740
- Seriously, they're writing this

914
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,800
for some kind of genius or something.

915
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,543
I mean, I literally don't
understand any of it.

916
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:45,163
Can you help me?

917
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:47,100
- I, uh...

918
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:02,190
- Here, let me see. Right
there is this piece.

919
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:06,170
But this has three holes
and that has five holes.

920
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:10,143
- Claire, we, we, we put the
crib away several months ago.

921
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,525
Why did you bring it back out?

922
01:03:13,525 --> 01:03:16,433
- (chuckles) You're joking.

923
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,160
- Claire, why did you bring it back out?

924
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:24,093
- Our baby's gonna be home
soon and we have to be ready.

925
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:29,440
Look, if you don't wanna help me,

926
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,030
I'll just handle it myself.

927
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:32,405
Okay?

928
01:03:32,405 --> 01:03:34,809
(paper tears)

929
01:03:34,809 --> 01:03:36,609
What did you do?
- We lost our kid.

930
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:40,800
- What did you say?

931
01:03:45,642 --> 01:03:48,430
- I can't, I can't do this.

932
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:49,500
- What did you say?

933
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,600
- Talk to her, please?

934
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:54,580
I can't do this. You just, you-

935
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,823
- What did you say, you bastard?

936
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,440
Have you already buried our child?

937
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,273
- Stop it!

938
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,260
We buried him together.

939
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,520
- What kind of father are you?

940
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,640
- We buried him together.

941
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,530
It was a small ceremony, Claire.

942
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:11,980
It was the smallest coffin
I've ever seen in my life.

943
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,390
- No.
- Your mom was there

944
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:15,810
and she, she didn't stay to the end

945
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,780
because she, she couldn't take it.

946
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:20,050
- You're lying.
- Yeah, and then soon she...

947
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,700
Claire, you were sitting right
next to me the whole time

948
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:24,940
and you didn't make a sound.

949
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,550
- No, you're lying.

950
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:28,370
- Your boss showed up.

951
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:30,710
Your boss was there and
he gave you some time off

952
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:32,940
so you could collect your things

953
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,393
and get ahold of yourself.

954
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:38,530
- No.
- Yes, yes!

955
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:40,340
I thanked people for coming!

956
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:42,693
- No, no, no.

957
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,199
There were some complications.

958
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:46,270
- No, there weren't any complications.

959
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:48,900
- And, and, and, and the doctor

960
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,440
needed to keep him for a checkup.

961
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,650
- No.
- And the hospital's

962
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,950
gonna call any moment, any moment.

963
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:55,790
And they're gonna give him back to us

964
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:58,810
and they're gonna call
and we have to be ready.

965
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:01,690
Okay? We're such silly heads.

966
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:06,090
We left everything to the
last minute. (chuckles)

967
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:07,883
- Why doesn't he have a name?

968
01:05:07,883 --> 01:05:09,899
(somber piano music)

969
01:05:09,899 --> 01:05:10,732
Hmm?

970
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,643
What is his name, Claire?

971
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:21,093
How old is he?

972
01:05:26,453 --> 01:05:28,410
- Eight months.
- Eight months ago

973
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:29,920
we lost our kid, Claire.

974
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,370
It was March 26th, our due date.

975
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:33,730
We already headed to the hospital

976
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:34,910
but you wanted to run upstairs

977
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:36,220
and take a shower and you did.

978
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:37,520
And you know what? You tripped.

979
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,090
You tripped on the belt of your rope

980
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:40,630
and you fell on your belly, Claire.

981
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:41,740
You fell hard.
(Claire whimpering)

982
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,110
We didn't know what to do.

983
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:44,310
And so we rushed you to the hospital

984
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:46,873
but the surgeons couldn't
find a heartbeat.

985
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:51,877
They gave you a shot and you had the baby.

986
01:05:51,877 --> 01:05:53,430
And he was dead.
- No.

987
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:55,650
- Our baby's dead.
- Mm-mm.

988
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:56,550
- Our baby's dead.

989
01:05:58,444 --> 01:05:59,277
- No.

990
01:06:02,809 --> 01:06:05,540
Why my baby? Oh, God!

991
01:06:09,161 --> 01:06:13,760
Oh my boy, my boy. (sobbing)

992
01:06:17,999 --> 01:06:19,582
I can't, I can't...

993
01:06:21,012 --> 01:06:22,345
I, I, I can't...

994
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:25,800
- I pay you to do this!

995
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,633
So you fucking do it!

996
01:06:26,633 --> 01:06:29,580
- You need to remind her every day. Okay?

997
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:30,413
Every day.

998
01:06:35,504 --> 01:06:36,337
- Okay.

999
01:06:36,337 --> 01:06:39,004
(heart beating)

1000
01:06:48,111 --> 01:06:50,861
(Claire gasping)

1001
01:07:01,507 --> 01:07:04,257
(Claire sobbing)

1002
01:07:11,113 --> 01:07:13,780
(intense music)

1003
01:07:34,856 --> 01:07:36,681
(machinery beeping)

1004
01:07:36,681 --> 01:07:37,514
Oh God.

1005
01:07:39,899 --> 01:07:42,899
(Claire whimpering)

1006
01:07:44,592 --> 01:07:47,509
(Claire screaming)

1007
01:07:55,143 --> 01:07:59,676
Oh God. (sobbing)

1008
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,520
(Claire whimpering)

1009
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:41,785
(key pad beeping)

1010
01:09:05,995 --> 01:09:08,995
(suspenseful music)

1011
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:25,698
(Claire gasps)

1012
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:41,073
It was fun.

1013
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:44,810
(footsteps shuffling)

1014
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:47,083
- Hey, how are my girls?

1015
01:09:57,645 --> 01:10:00,700
- How is she?
- You tell me.

1016
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:01,900
- It's gonna get better.

1017
01:10:06,313 --> 01:10:08,730
(Eric sighs)

1018
01:10:10,137 --> 01:10:10,970
- No, no.

1019
01:10:13,192 --> 01:10:15,112
(Claire gasping)
(water running)

1020
01:10:15,112 --> 01:10:16,440
- Oh, so you'll take us?

1021
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,520
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1022
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,130
What does Monica have to say about it?

1023
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:21,310
Hey, do you wanna call Monica?

1024
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:22,473
My girls.

1025
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,247
That was my baby too!

1026
01:10:26,553 --> 01:10:31,553
(water splashing)
(Claire sobbing)

1027
01:10:52,761 --> 01:10:53,761
- Of course.

1028
01:10:58,104 --> 01:10:59,437
(baby cooing)

1029
01:10:59,437 --> 01:11:02,218
(water running)

1030
01:11:02,218 --> 01:11:04,040
I lost our baby.

1031
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,207
(sobbing)

1032
01:11:13,375 --> 01:11:15,208
No, I killed our baby.

1033
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,523
(sobbing)

1034
01:11:20,523 --> 01:11:24,063
Because I didn't wanna
stink when giving birth!

1035
01:11:25,909 --> 01:11:29,909
(sobbing) This is unforgivable!

1036
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:35,140
Does he have a right to forgive me?

1037
01:11:37,544 --> 01:11:39,893
(sobbing) Do you hear me?

1038
01:11:43,972 --> 01:11:45,920
I'll never forgive myself ever.

1039
01:11:48,553 --> 01:11:50,720
(sobbing)

1040
01:11:53,587 --> 01:11:56,274
(hand slams)
(water dripping)

1041
01:11:56,274 --> 01:11:59,314
Monica would never make
these kinds of mistakes.

1042
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:02,064
(birds chirping)

1043
01:12:06,372 --> 01:12:07,205
Bitch!

1044
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:14,648
This is how you wanted to help me?

1045
01:12:14,648 --> 01:12:17,348
This is how you wanted to
solve my problems with Eric?

1046
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,143
Simply by stealing my husband?

1047
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:27,124
(Claire laughing)

1048
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:34,110
And here I'm thinking,
why is he pushing me

1049
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:35,663
to go back to work so hard?

1050
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:40,623
What did I do to you?

1051
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:47,260
We were fine before you
came into this house

1052
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,637
Where are you going?

1053
01:13:04,536 --> 01:13:07,217
(Monica and Eric groaning)

1054
01:13:07,217 --> 01:13:10,217
(suspenseful music)

1055
01:13:24,998 --> 01:13:29,331
(Monica and Eric continue groaning)

1056
01:13:43,498 --> 01:13:46,609
(heart beating)
- Oh my God.

1057
01:13:46,609 --> 01:13:47,708
Oh my God.

1058
01:13:47,708 --> 01:13:51,062
(both continue groaning)

1059
01:13:51,062 --> 01:13:52,809
(Claire screaming)

1060
01:13:52,809 --> 01:13:55,309
(knife stabs)

1061
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,167
(alarm beeping)

1062
01:14:02,948 --> 01:14:05,698
(Claire yawning)

1063
01:14:07,236 --> 01:14:10,087
(birds chirping)

1064
01:14:10,087 --> 01:14:13,225
- It's time to wake up, baby? (chuckles)

1065
01:14:13,225 --> 01:14:15,240
(lips kissing)

1066
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,083
I have an idea.

1067
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,536
Let's spend the entire day together.

1068
01:14:19,536 --> 01:14:22,453
(phone vibrating)

1069
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:26,323
Eric's phone?

1070
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:30,660
He's gonna need a sick day.

1071
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:32,060
Yeah. He's not feeling well.

1072
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:36,123
Actually, he's gonna need several days.

1073
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:39,720
Yeah, I don't want him
to spread his infection

1074
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:40,903
around the office.

1075
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:43,710
I'll let you know how he is.

1076
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,187
Okay, bye.

1077
01:14:45,187 --> 01:14:47,770
(phone beeps)

1078
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:50,920
This is gonna be the
vacation that we needed.

1079
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,440
- [Mary Voicemail] Hello,
this is Mary Clarks.

1080
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,558
Please leave me a message
- We'll even get to go

1081
01:14:54,558 --> 01:14:55,391
- after the tone
- to the park.

1082
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:57,810
- and I'll call you back.
- The whole family.

1083
01:14:57,810 --> 01:14:59,310
Let me just talk to Mom, okay?

1084
01:15:00,836 --> 01:15:03,040
(voicemail beeps)
Mom,

1085
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,350
