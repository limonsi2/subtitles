This is suicide. Where are we going?

488
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,361
[Manny] There's a door behind the bar.

489

-Madam.
-[Sutton] We need cover.

Come on.

[Elena hyperventilating]

492
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,252
Until I give the signal,
I need you to stay, okay?

493
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,378
Okay.

494
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,754
She's having panic attack.

-Go.
-Okay.

00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,074

[hushed] Take off our conference bands.
They have a chip that can track us.

508
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,894
We need to keep moving, Madam President.

509
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,104
How'd you find this?

510
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:15,564
Saw the blueprints.

511
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,816
I found the door in my advance work.

512
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,485
[Sutton] Well, you might have
saved all of us.

You guys okay?

521
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:53,936
Let me say this again so you can get it
through your thick skull.

522
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,397
How many others are hiding in here?

523
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,567
Tell me or I'm going to shoot you.

524
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,193
[hushed] Okay.

[pots clatter]

526
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,242
Two tangos with weapons
right outside those doors.

527
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,953
-Right.
-Maybe if I surprise them...

528
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,496
Okay, give me your secondary.

529
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,790
Two against two, we eliminate the maybe.

530

Ma'am, zero chance

-that you're going in there.
-What do you think this is?

532
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,795
It's not the ideal,
but I've handled weapons before,

533
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,130
and I've seen my share of combat.

534
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,007
-I know. I was there.
-Where do you think this goes?

535
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,633
With all due respect,
that was two decades ago, ma'am.

536
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,136
-Well, that's more than you can say
about any of those.
-[overlapping hushed chatter]

537
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,596
I'm not worried about the others

538
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,806
because they aren't
the president of the United States.

539
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,767
Agent Ruiz, do you know
that rank has its privileges?

540
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,352
We're doing it, and that's an order.

541

Eighteen out of 20.

548
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:26,945
The American president and British gone.

549
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,405
How?

550
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:31,867
I don't know, boss,
but I found where they escaped.

[murmuring]

552
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,589
I told you that
she was gonna be a problem.

00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:46,924
Yeah, your problem.

554
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,177
She's the linchpin to all of this.

555
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,054
That's why I gave her to you.

556

'Cause I trusted you.

and you bring me the American president.

Do not let me down.

-Mm-hmm.

560

It wasn't your fault.

00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,034
That was his job.

Hey, son, come help me.

-And you know the prime minister.
-[Everett] Yes, splendid.

Yes, we're all, we're all good friends.

581
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:15,679
Manny, you have the evacuation routes,
contingency plans?

582
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,055
So do they.

583
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,475
This has to be an inside job.

584
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,060
Well, you Americans never leave home
without your Special Forces.

585
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,270
Where are they?

586
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,063
We believe that
after the first explosions,

587
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:27,274
our entire team was eliminated.

no U.S. base in South Africa.

Any QRF is hours out.

592
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:40,913
And... I'm not sure how effective
they would be with high-value hostages.

593
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,581
So what do we do?

594
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,630
We have to breach the perimeter.

[mutters]

596
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:55,344
And that's a good mile away,
so we'll need cover.

597
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,012
Any ideas?

598
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,390
What about The Beast?

599
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:02,226
Is it underground?

It is.

601

Which kind of animal is this beast?

Oh, no, that's my ride.

It's a military vehicle
disguised as a luxury sedan.

But, uh, h-how do we get to it?

605
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,947
Need to get to the ground floor.

606
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,616
Cross the service entrance.

607
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,953
That elevator's our way out,
but we tossed our security keys.

Even if we hadn't,
I'm sure they changed the codes by now.

We are not.

What we are is a group of individuals
who refuse to stand by

637

and let world leaders strip away
the rights and wealth of their citizens.

This currency
that President Sutton is proposing

Are you needing a translator?

699

'Cause I don't think
any of my boys speak Asian.
