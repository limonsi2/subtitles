And who are you?

00:32:04,207 --> 00:32:06,125
Uh, Plankton? [grunts]

658
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:08,332
I've been your roommate for four years!

You und Karen worked together.

But we still haven't
discovered what went wrong.

Oh! [laughs]

So this would be kind of
your basement of failures, huh?

What? Do these look like failures to you?

740

Can I touch this? Sorry,
Plankton, I have to touch this.

How about if I touch
this one with my pinkie?

Oh, so you were still working together.

closer to your breakthrough.

will swing your face in front of it.

So, after college, what
happened to you und Karen?

787
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:46,000
We were two evil partners,
ready to take over the w-world.

788
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:52,125
Our freeze ray was such a
success, we decided to supersize it.

Aye, aye, Captain.

And so, our mega ice tank was locked,
loaded, and ready to invade the surface.

this chip back inside Karen,

and everything goes back to normal!

1123
