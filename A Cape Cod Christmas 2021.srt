3
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:48,472
-Hi!

4
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:50,735
If it isn't my favorite sister.

5
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:53,608
- Well, I'm your older sister,
but I'll take it.

6
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:55,175
So you're down there already?

7
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:56,611
And in the Christmas spirit,
I see.

8
00:02:56,654 --> 00:03:00,049
-Yeah, I just walked in.

9
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,398
- How does the place look?
-Good.

10
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:03,835
The same. A little dusty.

11
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,229
Look.

12
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:08,797
Can't believe I didn't get
down here once last year.

13
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,929
- Oh, really? Wow.

14
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:14,019
It's been probably a couple
of years since I've been there.

15
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:16,239
-Really?

16
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:18,023
- Kind of bittersweet, huh?

17
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,939
-I'm not sure I can taste
the sweet part of this.

18
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:23,725
- Come on, Margs. Come on.
We talked about this.

19
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:25,988
It's the right thing to do.
-Is it?

20
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:28,991
- Yes.
It's too expensive to keep.

21
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,862
-Well, if Tom would just
pull his weight...

22
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:33,038
- Hey, come on, now. Come on.

23
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:34,823
It's the season of the year
to be charitable.

24
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:36,999
Besides, we've already made
this decision, right?

25
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,827
-I know,
but then I got down here

26
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,006
and this place is filled
with so many memories.

27
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:46,748
- Well, I'll be there in
a couple of days.

28
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,098
At least we'll be able
to say goodbye together.

29
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:53,798
-Yeah.
- And cheer up! It's Christmas.

30
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,803
-Okay.

31
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:01,284
Bye.
-Bye.

32
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:34,448
-"It was then
that Caroline realized

33
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,102
that it didn't matter
if her house was big or small

34
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:38,887
or not much of a house at all.

35
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,802
A home is more than
bricks and blocks

36
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,543
and windows and locks.

37
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:46,155
A home is more than a bed
or where you rest your head.

38
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:48,331
They say that home
is where the heart is,

39
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,028
and Caroline
knew that to be true.

40
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:52,335
But what she didn't realize

41
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,164
is that your home
is within you."

42
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:01,388
Thank you all so much
for coming.

43
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:05,305
It's such a pleasure to read
in a place that I love so much,

44
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:09,657
and in a place that I call home.

45
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,268
I'm going to be sticking around
for a little bit

46
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,315
if anybody would like to get
a copy of their book signed.

47
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:25,194
Hey, Jackie. Thanks again.

48
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:27,544
-Are you kidding me?
You're really getting good.

49
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:29,720
-Think so?
-Yeah, I know so.

50
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:32,810
Did you see those kids faces?
They loved it.

51
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,377
You know,
you pull in more customers

52
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,074
than most of the other authors
I have in here.

53
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,860
-It's the local draw,
but it did feel nice.

54
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:41,384
-Great message, too.

55
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:42,733
-Mm. I wish I believed it.

56
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:45,388
-Shh. Your fans.

57
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,912
-Yeah, right.

58
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:50,175
-Hey, what's going on?

59
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:53,048
You look like you saw a ghost.
-N--Nothing.

60
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:54,223
I'll tell you about it later.

61
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:55,790
-You better.

62
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,053
In the meantime,
your adoring public awaits.

63
00:05:58,096 --> 00:05:59,620
-Mm.

64
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:01,186
Hi, guys. What's your name?

65
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,101
Do you want me
to sign this for you?

66
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:04,886
-Yes, please.
-Okay.

67
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,067
-Is your family here yet?

68
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,288
-No, Meredith, Jeff, and Ace
get in on Thursday.

69
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:20,423
-What about Tom?
-Mr. Reliable?

70
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,425
He's probably
in the Caribbean somewhere.

71
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,427
-Good for him.

72
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:27,909
-He's supposed to come, but
I'll believe it when I see it.

73
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:31,695
He'll settle down someday.
Or maybe he won't.

74
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:35,220
-So what's your plan
while you're here?

75
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:36,744
-Oh...

76
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:39,355
This is actually
our last Christmas here.

77
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,574
We have to sell the house.

78
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,793
-What?
-Yeah.

79
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:45,187
-How long have
we known about this?

80
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,147
-A few months now, but it didn't
seem final until I got here.

81
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:52,412
Meredith and Tom hired a realtor
who evidently has a buyer

82
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,718
that wants to close
before the end of the year,

83
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:57,199
sight unseen.
-So what does that mean?

84
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:59,723
You won't
come down here anymore?

85
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:02,596
-I guess not.
-How do you feel about that?

86
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,554
-Terrible.

87
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:05,860
I mean, it makes sense
with Mom and Dad gone,

88
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:09,037
but the Cape is part of me.

89
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,606
-Oh, Margot, I'm so sorry.

90
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,042
Well, if this is
your last Christmas,

91
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:15,783
then you better
make it a good one.

92
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:17,437
-See, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

93
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,135
I want to make this
the most special Christmas ever.

94
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:21,702
-That's the spirit.

95
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:24,139
-And then maybe I can convince
Tom and Meredith

96
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:26,663
that this place is so great,
they shouldn't sell.

97
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,056
-How likely is that?

98
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:30,624
-At this point, not very.

99
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:37,587
-Ahh.
-You need to take that?

100
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:40,372
-No, that's my agent.
-Then answer it.

101
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,027
-No, she's just calling to see
if I have any new pages.

102
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,159
-And I take it you don't.

103
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:46,335
-No.

104
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:48,293
I've been feeling
pretty stuck the last few weeks.

105
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,382
My mind's been on other stuff.

106
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:53,081
-Well, that's understandable.

107
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:57,389
Hey, I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

108
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,479
-I hope you're right.

109
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,744
-Christian.

110
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:46,341
-Hey, can I help you something?

111
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:47,821
-Yeah, this gallery.

112
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:49,605
I haven't seen it before.
Is it new?

113
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,215
-Yeah, we just opened.

114
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,826
Let me know if you have
any other questions.

115
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:56,743
-I was just looking at
these beautiful paintings.

116
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:59,267
They capture
the feel of the Cape so well.

117
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,660
Who's the artist?

118
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,444
-It's a local artist, actually.

119
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:06,361
I think his name
is Christian something?

120
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:08,189
-Christian?
-Yeah.

121
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:11,366
Do you know him?

122
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:15,892
-I...We were k--

123
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,938
Christian?
-Yeah.

124
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:19,853
I am Christian, the artist.

125
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,464
I just -- I don't
like to lead with that.

126
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:25,423
I don't want to taint
people's opinions of the work.

127
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:29,340
-Christian, it's Margot.

128
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:31,299
Bradford.

129
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,431
-I know. I'm so sorry,
I'm messing with you,

130
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,085
I saw you at your book reading.

131
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,392
-What? You...?

132
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,916
I thought I recognized you.
-Yeah.

133
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,136
Wow, how long has it been?

134
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,268
-It must be 20 years.

135
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:48,446
My gosh,
you look exactly the same

136
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,927
-Taller.

137
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:52,363
-Yeah.

138
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,365
-And you're...
-Not a ponytailed tomboy?

139
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:57,064
-Hardly.

140
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,066
-Wow.

141
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:01,111
The last time I saw you
was right before

142
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,765
your family moved to Michigan.

143
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:06,900
-Yeah, that's right.
Grand Rapids. You remember.

144
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,858
-Of course I did. Yeah.

145
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:11,252
-Wow.

146
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:14,211
-So are you here now
for good or...?

147
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:15,647
-Uh, for now.

148
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,214
Yeah, after Michigan,

149
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:20,087
my dad got transferred
to Sydney, Australia.

150
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,045
-You're kidding.
-No, it was great.

151
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:24,439
We spent about 10 years
Down Under

152
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:28,008
and then we went to Europe,

153
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:29,836
studied there
for a couple of years,

154
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,361
traveled around a lot, and
landed back here on the Cape.

155
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:36,364
-Wow.
-How about you?

156
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:39,106
-I live in Boston.
I have since college.

157
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:41,325
Seems very boring
compared to your world travels.

158
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:44,372
-And you write children's books.
That's not boring at all.

159
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,635
-Well, I guess that's true.

160
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:48,332
-How's the family?

161
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:51,292
-Oh...they're good.

162
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:54,686
Yeah, my mom and dad died
a few years back.

163
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,387
My mom from cancer and my dad
from a broken heart.

164
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,954
-Yeah, they say that happens.

165
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:02,694
I'm sorry.

166
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:05,262
I remember them well.
They were great people.

167
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:06,873
-Thanks.

168
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,353
-So are you here alone or...?

169
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:11,094
-Yeah, it's just me.
-Oh.

170
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:13,618
-My sister and her family
and hopefully my brother

171
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:15,229
are coming next week
to celebrate Christmas.

172
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:16,708
-Oh, like the good old days.

173
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:18,275
-Yeah.

174
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:25,979
It is so great to see
all of your artwork.

175
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:28,677
You always were
such an incredible artist.

176
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,376
-Yeah, I guess it just
kind of stayed with me.

177
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,987
-It sure did.

178
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:42,256
It was such a nice surprise
running into you.

179
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:45,389
-Yeah, it was
a wonderful surprise.

180
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:47,783
Come back in anytime.

181
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,960
-Bye.
-Bye.

182
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:53,006
Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

183
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,011
-Oh, you, uh -- you've
got to really push it.

184
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:01,057
It gets stuck.

185
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:03,668
-Bye.

186
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:09,098
-Hello.
-Hi.

187
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,405
-Fancy seeing you here.
-Oh, not really.

188
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:14,190
There's only a couple
of coffee shops in town.

189
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:16,236
Do you wanna join me?

190
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,455
-Sure.

191
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:19,891
-Um...

192
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:22,329
you sit and I'll
grab you a coffee.

193
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:24,853
-Thanks.

194
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:27,029
-Oh, regular coffee,

195
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,988
or are you like
a sophisticated, urban author

196
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,685
that only drinks lattes now?

197
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:33,905
-Regular coffee,
black, strong, unadulterated.

198
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:37,083
-Okay. I remember that
decisive quality about you.

199
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:38,693
-Can I get another coffee,
please?

200
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:50,574
-It is so weird seeing you.

201
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:51,836
-Good weird or bad weird?

202
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,664
-Good weird.

203
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,320
Yeah, I feel like
I know you so well,

204
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:59,496
but I missed
the whole growing-up part,

205
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,846
and I'm just wondering
if you're the same guy.

206
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,502
-I'm the same guy.
-Just with facial hair.

207
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:07,635
-Yeah.

208
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:10,681
-So I woke up this morning
and something occurred to me.

209
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:13,162
-What was that?
-Well...

210
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:15,469
this is actually our last
Christmas on the Cape.

211
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:17,558
-You're kidding.
-I wish I was.

212
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:21,170
We have to sell the house.
-Why?

213
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:23,259
-Well, my siblings don't want
to keep it up anymore,

214
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:27,089
and I don't have enough money
to buy the other two out.

215
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,657
-It's far too common a scenario.
-But I was wondering

216
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,443
if maybe I could commission you
to paint a picture of our house.

217
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:34,966
I want to give it to my sister
for Christmas.

218
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,794
I think she would love it.

219
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:39,797
-Sorry, you can't commission me.

220
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,582
-Oh, why, are you booked?

221
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:47,979
-I don't do commissioned work.
-Oh, okay.

222
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:50,634
-But I will make you a deal.

223
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:52,767
-What kind of deal?

224
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:58,033
-Do you remember years ago,
I drew a portrait of you?

225
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,382
-Yeah, I still have it.

226
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:01,776
-You do?

227
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:05,345
Okay, well,
I will paint your house

228
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:08,130
if you'll let me draw you again.

229
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,697
-I don't think a picture of me

230
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,134
would warrant a place
on your gallery wall.

231
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:15,746
-I disagree.

232
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,314
-Really, you'll paint
a picture of our house?

233
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:20,838
-Yeah. I'd be honored.

234
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:23,189
-Okay, you have a deal.

235
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:26,322
-Great. How long do I have?

236
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:30,196
-Until Friday, Christmas Eve.
-Oh. Oh, okay.

237
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:32,850
-My sister and her family
get in on Thursday.

238
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,504
Is that enough time?

239
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,071
-Uh, it's going to be tight.

240
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,727
I'd have to come over
every day to work on it.

241
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,164
-Okay.
-That works for you?

242
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,949
-Yeah, that'd be great,
catching up.

243
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,647
-And what will you be doing?

244
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,562
-Oh, I will be busy

245
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:50,477
providing you
with snacks and drinks

246
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,087
and anything else
you might need.

247
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,697
-Yeah, that'll be helpful.

248
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,177
-And I'll be
decorating the house

249
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:57,223
and getting ready for
the Christmas Eve feast.

250
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:59,050
-That sounds nice.

251
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:02,184
-Well, unfortunately, my motives
aren't quite so selfless.

252
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:03,664
I'm hoping to make it so special

253
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,666
that my sister
reconsiders selling.

254
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:09,322
-Gotcha.

255
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:13,282
-So I'll see you tomorrow?
-Yeah. Bright and early.

256
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:15,850
-Thanks for the coffee.
-You're welcome.

257
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,954
Hey, Jackie.

258
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:01,303
I'm kind of in
Christmas overload.

259
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:03,174
What time are you done
with work?

260
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:15,535
Mm. I so needed this.

261
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:18,146
-So, any progress
on the new book?

262
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,626
-Uh...no.

263
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:21,323
I've been too distracted.

264
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:22,977
-What's it going to be about?

265
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,718
-I'm thinking it's going to have
a Christmas theme.

266
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:26,676
-So you haven't
even started it yet?

267
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,461
-Well, uh...no.

268
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,854
But I ran into
a Christmas angel this morning

269
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:32,508
and it sparked an idea.

270
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:34,771
-A Christmas angel, huh?

271
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,860
-Do you remember
Christian Williams?

272
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:38,471
-Of course I do.

273
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:40,560
He just opened up
the new gallery right next door.

274
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:43,563
-He's who I thought I saw the
other day at the book signing.

275
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:45,956
-He's your Christmas angel?

276
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,829
-He's painting our house for me,
for my sister.

277
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:50,483
It's going to be
the best Christmas present.

278
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:52,006
-You're kidding me.

279
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,487
And he's not even charging.

280
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,140
-What--

281
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:58,969
Oh, you guys had
a little something, right?

282
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:04,105
-Oh, no. Come on.
We were just kids.

283
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:05,846
But he was my first kiss.

284
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:08,065
-Well, now.

285
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:10,546
Any rekindled feelings there?

286
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,940
-I don't know. Maybe.

287
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:14,811
-He's ridiculously cute.

288
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:16,291
-It probably won't even matter.

289
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,858
In all likelihood,
I won't be spending

290
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:20,774
very much time down here
in the future anyway.

291
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:22,689
-I believe in angels, you know.

292
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,473
-Please.

293
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:26,345
We're getting way
too ahead of ourselves.

294
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,956
-A girl can dream, can't she?

295
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,523
-Oh,

296
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:33,134
I had such a crush
on him when we were kids.

297
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:36,311
I think I cried for a week
when he left.

298
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,793
-Well, just be careful.

299
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,534
Rumor is, he's got a reputation.

300
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:44,363
-Reputation for what?

301
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,930
-It's just what
people say about him.

302
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,497
Be careful, you hear me?

303
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,978
-Oh, thanks, Mom.

304
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:05,487
-Good morning, sunshine.
-Hi.

305
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:07,620
I--I fell asleep on the couch.

306
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:09,578
-Good thing you had
your Santa hat on.

307
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:14,714
-It was for inspiration.
-Ah.

308
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:16,846
-Come in.
I'll put on some coffee,

309
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,022
-I actually brought you some.

310
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:21,285
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

311
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:24,027
And I brought you
a breakfast sandwich.

312
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:26,639
-Gosh, thank you so much.
The house doesn't have any food.

313
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,031
I haven't had a chance
to go to the store yet.

314
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:31,948
-Yeah, I figured.
-What time is it?

315
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:35,996
-7:00.
-You do start early.

316
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,346
-Yeah, I've always been
a bit of an early riser.

317
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,435
I like to walk on the beach
first thing in the morning.

318
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,784
Best time of day.

319
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:44,221
-Have you been already?
-Yep.

320
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:45,919
Maybe I'll take you with me
one of these mornings.

321
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:48,356
-Yeah.

322
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:51,054
-Oh, wow.

323
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:53,361
You have
a fake Christmas tree?

324
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:54,754
-Yeah.

325
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:57,626
Like, in the box. It's--

326
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,542
That's not not going to do.

327
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:02,370
-Of course it will do.

328
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:05,547
-I mean, not if you're trying
to impress anyone.

329
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:08,115
-What are you talking about?
It's completely practical.

330
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:10,117
You set it up
and then when Christmas is over,

331
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,293
you stuff it back in the box and
you're good to go for next year.

332
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:13,729
It's what we've always done.

333
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:17,037
-Okay. Suit yourself.

334
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,778
-Are you getting self-righteous
right now

335
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:20,562
about a Christmas tree?

336
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:24,087
-I'm just saying, it's...
you know.

337
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:25,828
-I don't have time
to go get a real tree anyway.

338
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:28,527
-Okay, well,
I'd better to get to work.

339
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,181
I wanted to see the house
in the morning light.

340
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:34,054
-Thank you for the coffee.
-You're welcome.

341
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,280
Mm.

342
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:19,403
Hmm.

343
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:21,101
Painter's block?

344
00:26:21,144 --> 00:26:25,409
-Something like that.
-I can relate.

345
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:28,978
Blank canvas is probably
as intimidating as a blank page.

346
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,720
-I actually can't get over how
big the red beech has gotten.

347
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:34,418
I remember being like
half the size.

348
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:37,857
-Yeah, it's my favorite tree.

349
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,641
-Secret fort
in the cedar bushes?

350
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,512
-Still there.

351
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:45,212
-Hmm.

352
00:26:45,255 --> 00:26:47,257
-Listen, I know you said you
wanted a painting of the house,

353
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:48,998
but...

354
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:50,739
as I was sitting there,
I started thinking,

355
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:55,570
is it really the house
or is it this?

356
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,008
-I hadn't considered that.

357
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:01,663
-What is your absolute
favorite memory of this place?

358
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:42,008
-My favorite memories
are down on the beach.

359
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:43,705
-I thought so.

360
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:46,316
-But without the house,
no beach.

361
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,057
-Exactly.

362
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:49,885
C'mere.

363
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:59,547
Okay. Here, sit down.

364
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,157
This is what I'm saying.

365
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:06,859
You see, it is this view
framed in by the porch.

366
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:09,209
It's special.

367
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:11,385
-You're so right.

368
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:13,126
-"Home is more than
bricks and blocks

369
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:15,258
and windows and locks.

370
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:20,220
A home is more than a bed or
where you rest your head."

371
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:23,571
Somebody very wise
once wrote that.

372
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:28,228
-"Your home is within you."

373
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:29,708
-I'm gonna
bring my stuff up here.

374
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:34,713
Hey, so how did you get into

375
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:38,586
writing children's books,
anyway?

376
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:40,196
-I don't know.

377
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:46,899
I guess I've always loved the
way that children see the world.

378
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:50,250
Naive,
but inquisitive and honest.

379
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:52,034
-That makes sense.

380
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:53,949
-Plus, reading's always been
such an escape for me.

381
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:56,082
- Anne of Green Gables, right?

382
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,779
-I can't believe you
remember that.

383
00:28:57,823 --> 00:29:00,608
Yeah, I have that book
upstairs in my room.

384
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:02,479
-No way.
-Yeah.

385
00:29:02,523 --> 00:29:04,612
That's the book that
made me want to be an author.

386
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,092
Not that my children's books

387
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:07,876
hold a candle
to Lucy Maud Montgomery,

388
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,793
but least I can give back
a little bit.

389
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:13,142
Here, let me help you.

390
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:15,928
-Oh, thanks.

391
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:17,886
So do you want kids
of your own one day?

392
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,280
-Yeah, if the right person
comes along.

393
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:21,716
-Hmm.
-You?

394
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,979
-Definitely,
as long as they're boys.

395
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:27,417
No, I'm kidding.

396
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:29,463
-I've been meaning to ask,
where are you living now?

397
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,247
-I actually got a little place
down by the water.

398
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,815
-Oh.
-Next to a lighthouse

399
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:34,990
that you might remember.

400
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:37,732
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

401
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,647
-Is it just you, or...?

402
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,870
-It is just me, but I do have
a special lady in my life.

403
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:47,437
-Oh.
-Yeah, her name's Maggie.

404
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:51,050
-What's she like?
-Well, she's got brown hair.

405
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:55,315
She's about 80 pounds
and she drools a lot.

406
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:59,406
-She sounds lovely.
-Maggie is my chocolate lab.

407
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:01,234
I was in a relationship
not too long ago,

408
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:03,714
but we wanted different things.

409
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:05,629
-Is that why you moved back?

410
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:07,327
-I'd rather not talk about it,
if that's okay.

411
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,504
Just -- old relationships
are super boring.

412
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:13,420
-Yeah, you're right.

413
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:15,161
-Hey, do you remember
when we were kids

414
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:18,468
and you gave me
that little compass?

415
00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:19,861
-Of course.

416
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:21,210
-I was just about to
move to Michigan,

417
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:23,256
and you told me that
I could use it

418
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:25,040
to find my way back home.

419
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:27,347
-Exactly.

420
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,957
-I guess it worked.

421
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,080
-I guess it did.

422
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:54,956
-Hey, sorry I'm late.
I was cutting this thing down.

423
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,480
-Christian!
-What you think? Is it too tall?

424
00:31:57,524 --> 00:31:58,873
If it is, I can trim the bottom.

425
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,962
-I told you I didn't need
a real tree.

426
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,616
-Yeah, and I think you do,

427
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:04,052
because Christmas is not
the time for practicality.

428
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,662
It's the time for authenticity,

429
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:08,404
especially if you want to
impress your siblings.

430
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,319
-I don't know what to say.
-Say "thank you."

431
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:12,800
-Thank you.

432
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:15,890
-You're welcome. Come on,
let me help you set it up.

433
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,718
-I cannot believe this.

434
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:20,982
-It was just sitting there,
begging to be cut down.

435
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:25,117
Okay, how's that?
Is it straight?

436
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,770
-Hang on. Uh, nope.

437
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:28,772
-No?
-This way.

438
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:29,904
Okay, right there.
Tighten that up.

439
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,037
-Okay.

440
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,429
Got it.

441
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:36,955
-Oh.
-Wow.

442
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,478
-Thanks.

443
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,306
-Tell me again
why practical is bad?

444
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:41,785
-Oh, come on.

445
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:43,526
You got to admit,

446
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,225
a real tree
is way more Christmas-y.

447
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:47,748
Can't beat that smell.

448
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:50,446
-It does smell wonderful.

449
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,622
-It'll make a difference,
even if it only

450
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:56,931
elevates your Christmas spirit
a degree or two.

451
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,021
-It was very thoughtful of you.
I really appreciate it.

452
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:03,198
Thank you.
-You're welcome.

453
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:28,310
-Hey, sis!

454
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:29,746
I'm just unloading
the car from the grocery store

455
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,270
I'm making Grandma's pot roast
for dinner.

456
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:33,141
-Alright.

457
00:33:33,185 --> 00:33:34,664
I guess we sort of have to have
the pot roast, don't we?

458
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,101
-Of course you have
to make the pot roast.

459
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:38,407
We always make the pot roast.

460
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:39,887
Alright, well,
we'll be down there

461
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,758
sometime around noon
day after tomorrow,

462
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:43,804
so hopefully we'll be there
in time for dinner.

463
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:46,241
-Cool, I was thinking we could
just have Chinese that night.

464
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:49,114
-Oh, that sounds great.
Anything else you need?

465
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:53,814
-Mm, some wine.
-I'm on it.

466
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:56,338
-Hey, do you remember
Christian Williams?

467
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:59,776
-Oh, my gosh, wow. Course.

468
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,951
You two were inseparable.

469
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:03,258
-He's here.
-What?

470
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:05,043
-Yeah, it's kind of
a long story.

471
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,131
I'll tell you all
about it later.

472
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:08,872
-No, no, no. Margot, spill it.

473
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,223
-Jeez, I bet he grew up
to be incredibly hot.

474
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:12,572
-Times ten.

475
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:14,878
-Margot!

476
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:16,750
-Alright, I got to go.
I'll talk to you later.

477
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:18,665
- Margot --
-Bye!

478
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:22,016
-Don't--did you
just hang up on me?

479
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,974
You did, didn't you?

480
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:25,585
You're unbelievable.

481
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,636
-Hey.
-Hi.

482
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,203
-How long you been
standing there?

483
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:04,249
-Not long. How's it going?

484
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:07,077
-Oh, no, you don't get to see
until it's done.

485
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:09,732
-Come on.
-No, stop. Uh-uh.

486
00:36:09,776 --> 00:36:12,431
-Okay, well,
I could use some help

487
00:36:12,474 --> 00:36:15,085
decorating that gorgeous
Christmas tree you brought me.

488
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:16,609
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

489
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:18,611
You want to take
a break and give me a hand?

490
00:36:18,654 --> 00:36:20,178
-Sure.

491
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,745
We've got about
an hour until sunset.

492
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:24,182
I don't wanna miss that light.

493
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,488
-Okay.
-Okay.

494
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,887
Oh, hey, it's starting
to look pretty good.

495
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,845
-Yeah, we still have
a long way to go.

496
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:39,719
-Yeah.

497
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:43,810
-Oh. I know this girl.

498
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:45,725
-No. No, no!
Give me that. Give me that.

499
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:48,815
-Oh, come on.

500
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,338
You were adorable.

501
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:57,258
-So are you going
to help me or what?

502
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:58,781
-Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

503
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:01,044
-Okay.
-Okay, what do you need?

504
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:02,872
-Hand me the box.
-Box.

505
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:54,010
-I can see that
it's a chocolate bar now.

506
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:01,801
Yeah. You got it?

507
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:03,933
Thank you.

508
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:28,131
-Hey.
-Hey.

509
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,655
-I made us some hot chocolate.

510
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:34,224
-Oh.

511
00:38:34,268 --> 00:38:36,749
-Ooh, that is good. Thank you.

512
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,664
-Well, thank you
for all of your help.

513
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:40,448
I could not have
done this without you.

514
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:42,363
-It's my pleasure.

515
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:44,974
-Sorry I didn't leave you
very much time to paint.

516
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:47,063
-That's okay.
I'm making mental notes.

517
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:49,327
I'll get back to it tomorrow.

518
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:53,896
-You know,
seeing the place like this,

519
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,986
I have no idea
how I'm going to let it go.

520
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,379
-Do you have to let it go?

521
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:00,468
-Yeah, I don't really
have a choice.

522
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:03,558
My siblings want to sell it,
particularly my brother,

523
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:07,257
-But you don't want to sell.
-Are you kidding? No.

524
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:10,565
-Well, it sounds like you
might have some thinking to do.

525
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:13,220
-Yeah, I guess you're right.

526
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:15,048
You have been
so incredibly helpful.

527
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:17,833
Can I take you
to dinner tonight?

528
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:19,531
-Ahh...

529
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:25,275
I'm--I'm sorry, I can't,
but maybe some other time.

530
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,365
-Okay, sure.

531
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:30,193
-But I will be back tomorrow
to paint.

532
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:33,109
-Okay. Yeah, yeah.

533
00:39:33,153 --> 00:39:34,850
I should work on my book anyway.

534
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:36,983
It's not going to write itself.

535
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:39,028
-Yeah.

536
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:45,905
-Here you go. Thank you.

537
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:47,254
Um.

538
00:39:47,297 --> 00:39:48,777
I'll see you tomorrow.

539
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,605
Oh, and please don't look
at the painting yet,

540
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:52,302
'cause it's not ready.

541
00:39:52,346 --> 00:39:54,435
Promise?

542
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:55,828
-I promise.

543
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:58,787
-Okay. Have a nice night.

544
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,662
-Margot, sweetheart,
where have you been?

545
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:48,924
-Hey, Judith.

546
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:50,883
Sorry, I go away
for the holidays.

547
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:53,973
-Holidays, schmalidays.
Where are my pages?

548
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,454
Publishing waits for no one.
- I know.

549
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:58,412
I promise I'll have
something brilliant for you

550
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,979
in the next few days.

551
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:01,371
-Mm, okay, doll.

552
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:02,938
Where do you go again
every year?

553
00:41:02,982 --> 00:41:04,331
Nantucket?

554
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:08,378
-Cape Cod.
- Right.

555
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:10,337
-That's -- that's actually
one of the things

556
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,295
that I wanted to
talk to you about.

557
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:13,732
-What do you need?

558
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:15,603
-I was wondering
if it might be possible

559
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:18,258
to get an advance
on my next book.

560
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:20,826
I've decided I want to buy
my family's Cape house

561
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:23,655
and my brother and sister
don't really want to sell it,

562
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:26,266
and some extra money
could help me figure it all out.

563
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:30,226
-Honey, you know I'd love
to negotiate in advance for you,

564
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,881
but -- --
the sales on your last book

565
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:35,188
weren't quite what
the publisher expected.

566
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:37,103
I'm really not sure
I can get approval

567
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:38,757
for something like that.

568
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,280
I can barely get advances on

569
00:41:40,323 --> 00:41:41,760
our established
children's authors.

570
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:43,588
-Right.

571
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:46,852
I guess I'll just reason
with my unreasonable siblings.

572
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:48,941
Do you know, we've come here
every year since I was a kid?

573
00:41:48,984 --> 00:41:52,858
- Hmm. Sounds darling.

574
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:54,555
-How could they want
to sell this place?

575
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,991
-What, dear?

576
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:57,689
-Nothing.

577
00:41:57,732 --> 00:42:01,606
-So what's your next book?
How far into it are you?

578
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:05,044
-Oh, about halfway.

579
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:09,048
Um, it's about a...
family tree at Christmas.

580
00:42:09,091 --> 00:42:11,050
-Mmm.

581
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:13,574
Why don't you write another book
because your character Caroline?

582
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:15,576
People love a series.

583
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,752
-Or I could do that.

584
00:42:17,796 --> 00:42:20,494
- I'm sorry I can't get you
that advanced, Margot.

585
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,237
Maybe if you or a little more
well-known internationally.

586
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,282
Let's try to get you there,
okay, doll?

587
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:27,980
-Okay.

588
00:42:28,023 --> 00:42:30,852
Hey, merry Christmas.
-You too, kiddo.

589
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,283
-Good morning.

590
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:11,763
-Is everything okay?
What time is it?

591
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:14,156
-Oh, yeah, everything's okay.
It's early.

592
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,768
Do you want to go for that
walk on the beach with me?

593
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:18,813
-Wow, you are a morning person,
aren't you?

594
00:43:18,857 --> 00:43:22,774
-Yeah. Coffee?

595
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:24,950
Plus, I want to
show you something.

596
00:43:24,993 --> 00:43:27,474
Go get dressed.
I'll meet you out front.

597
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:39,007
-I've never seen it like this.

598
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:42,663
-Something about it, right?

599
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:44,360
-Magical.

600
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:51,324
-We get so caught up in our busy
lives and our cellphones,

601
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:54,849
we forget to stop and take in
where we are.

602
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:57,722
-I think this might be
my favorite place on Earth.

603
00:43:57,765 --> 00:44:00,681
-Me too. It's why I came back.

604
00:44:00,725 --> 00:44:03,597
Maggie! Come here.

605
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,599
Come here.

606
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,862
-Hi. What's up?

607
00:44:10,473 --> 00:44:12,040
What are you going to do
if you have to sell the house?

608
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:14,129
-I don't know,

609
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:16,262
but I think it's
going to break my heart.

610
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:24,400
Do you remember when we used to
dig up quahogs under the dock?

611
00:44:26,315 --> 00:44:27,969
Do you remember when we carved
our initials under there?

612
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,539
I'll race you.

613
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:34,541
-Oh, like the good old days.

614
00:44:34,584 --> 00:44:36,021
On three?
-Mm-hmm.

615
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:37,675
-Okay.

616
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:39,285
-One.
-Uh-huh.

617
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:41,156
-Two.

618
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:47,728
You're such a cheater!

619
00:44:47,772 --> 00:44:50,470
-Maggie, come on!

620
00:44:53,212 --> 00:44:54,735
-Do you see it?

621
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:57,042
-No.
-Ahh.

622
00:44:57,085 --> 00:45:00,306
-Oh, hey, here it is.

623
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:01,916
-Wow.

624
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:06,442
-So many years have gone by.

625
00:45:06,486 --> 00:45:08,096
It's still there.

626
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:12,057
-Yeah.

627
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:18,977
-We should probably get going.

628
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,066
-Why, what's the rush?

629
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,679
-My family's coming,

630
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,726
and you need
to finish your painting,

631
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:32,077
and I don't want to hurt you
when I leave.

632
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,645
-Yeah. Right.

633
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:42,827
Maggie, c'mon.

634
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,415
-Hey, how's it going?

635
00:46:06,459 --> 00:46:08,374
-Uh, pretty good.

636
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:11,725
-Do you want some tea?

637
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,032
-No, thank you.

638
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:16,121
Listen, I'm going to take the
painting home with me tonight

639
00:46:16,164 --> 00:46:18,819
and then work on
the finishing touches there.

640
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:21,822
-Oh, okay.

641
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:23,781
Do you think you're
going to be done in time?

642
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:27,741
-Yeah, absolutely.

643
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,178
-But you won't be
coming by tomorrow?

644
00:46:30,222 --> 00:46:34,922
-Uh, no, I think you should
probably be with your family.

645
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:37,490
Let them know how you feel
about selling the house.

646
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:40,623
-Yeah, sure.
-I don't wanna be in the way.

647
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,712
Plus, it'll ruin the surprise.

648
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:47,456
-Yeah.
Yeah, I guess you're right.

649
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,850
-Yeah, but...

650
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:54,855
you could call me or text me
and let me know how it's going.

651
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:57,815
-Okay, I'll do that.

652
00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:01,427
-Okay.

653
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,212
-So I guess I'll see you
Christmas Eve?

654
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:07,259
-Yeah, I'll see you
Christmas Eve.

655
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,480
Don't look at it.

656
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:44,296
-Hey!
-Hi!

657
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:47,212
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!

658
00:47:47,255 --> 00:47:49,475
-How was the drive?
-Not too bad.

659
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:51,390
So how are you? You look great.

660
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:52,695
-I'm so glad you're here.

661
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:54,088
-Hey, Margot.
-Hey, Jeff. Hey!

662
00:47:54,132 --> 00:47:55,655
-Hi, Aunt Margot!

663
00:47:55,698 --> 00:47:57,439
-I'm so glad you could make it!

664
00:47:57,483 --> 00:48:00,442
-I'm going to go check out
the fort in the cedar bush.

665
00:48:00,486 --> 00:48:03,010
-Can you believe this wind?
-Oh, my gosh.

666
00:48:38,002 --> 00:48:40,613
-What is it?

667
00:48:40,656 --> 00:48:43,442
-Uh -- deja vu.

668
00:48:43,485 --> 00:48:46,532
Christian and I were that
exact same age when we...

669
00:48:46,575 --> 00:48:47,968
-Have you seen him?

670
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:49,883
-Yeah.

671
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,319
-Well?

672
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:53,495
Enough already. Spill it!

673
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:56,368
-Not right now.
-Come on.

674
00:48:56,411 --> 00:48:59,545
Hey, Ace, honey!
-What?

675
00:48:59,588 --> 00:49:01,242
Come on, let's wait till
we unpack, okay?

676
00:49:01,286 --> 00:49:03,288
-Aw, Mom!

677
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:05,812
-Come on.

678
00:49:05,855 --> 00:49:07,640
-Don't worry. I got these.

679
00:49:13,602 --> 00:49:15,300
-Whoa.

680
00:49:15,343 --> 00:49:19,173
-Margot, you did all this?
-Yep.

681
00:49:19,217 --> 00:49:22,785
It's mostly our old decorations
mixed in with a few new ones.

682
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:25,353
-Yeah, and all the poinsettias
on Cape Cod.

683
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:27,225
It looks really wonderful.

684
00:49:27,268 --> 00:49:29,923
Boy, if
Mom and Dad could see this.

685
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,492
Oh, Grandma's Santas!
I always loved these.

686
00:49:33,535 --> 00:49:35,059
-What's the big deal?

687
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:37,191
-Well, Grandma Mary
used to collect Santas,

688
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:40,934
and then she passed them down
to our mom, your grandma, Angie.

689
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,024
Oh, we should continue
that tradition.

690
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:47,636
-Whoa. Am I in the wrong place?
Is this the North Pole?

691
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,508
-Very funny.
-Lame joke, Dad.

692
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:51,814
-Looks great, Margot.
Nice job, really.

693
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:53,425
-Thanks.
Your rooms are all set up,

694
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:54,600
if you want to
take your luggage up.

695
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:56,819
-Alright, thanks.

696
00:49:56,863 --> 00:49:59,997
-You've become quite
the hostess, haven't you?

697
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,042
-Just trying to make
a good impression.

698
00:50:02,086 --> 00:50:05,002
-Oh, I've been meaning to
read your last book.

699
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:07,308
We've just been so busy
with Ace's hockey.

700
00:50:07,352 --> 00:50:08,701
-Oh, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

701
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:11,486
-Is something burning?
-The cookies!

702
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:16,535
No, no, no, no, no!

703
00:50:16,578 --> 00:50:18,493
Ahh!

704
00:50:18,537 --> 00:50:21,235
-Everything okay?
-I burned the cookies!

705
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:22,628
-Don't worry about it.

706
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:24,978
-No, I want everything
to be perfect.

707
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,589
-Everything's great.

708
00:50:27,633 --> 00:50:29,635
You okay? You seem off.

709
00:50:31,593 --> 00:50:32,768
-Yeah, everything's fine.

710
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:34,640
I just --

711
00:50:34,683 --> 00:50:36,598
I'll tell you about it later.
It's okay.

712
00:50:36,642 --> 00:50:38,687
You go up, get settled.

713
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:40,733
-Okay, well, don't worry
about the cookies.

714
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:42,213
I like mine
a little crunchy anyway.

715
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:43,736
-Me, too.

716
00:50:50,308 --> 00:50:52,092
Have you heard
anything from Tom?

717
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:53,789
-No, nothing.

718
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:57,967
He's supposed to arrive
tomorrow, but who knows?

719
00:50:58,011 --> 00:51:01,754
But forget about him.
Tell me about Christian.

720
00:51:01,797 --> 00:51:04,409
I haven't heard
that name in years.

721
00:51:04,452 --> 00:51:06,367
Boy, did you
have a crush on him.

722
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:09,066
-Was it that obvious?
-Obvious?

723
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:11,459
The whole town knew it.
-Oh, get out of here.

724
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:13,113
So what's he doing now?

725
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:15,463
-He's an artist. He just
opened a gallery in town.

726
00:51:15,507 --> 00:51:17,074
-Wow.

727
00:51:17,117 --> 00:51:19,685
Is he single?

728
00:51:19,728 --> 00:51:21,687
-Yeah.

729
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,515
-So...

730
00:51:23,558 --> 00:51:25,647
what are you waiting for?

731
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:27,301
-It's not that simple.

732
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:29,825
We were just kids.
You can't relive the past.

733
00:51:29,869 --> 00:51:32,176
-Why not?

734
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,962
-Oh, must be the Chinese food.

735
00:51:38,747 --> 00:51:41,359
-Hong Kong Cafe.
-Hi, thank you.

736
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:44,666
-Thanks. Have a good night.

737
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:46,059
-Dinner is here!

738
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,897
-This looks great, Margot.

739
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,942
-It's really good.
-Yeah, this is awesome.

740
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:02,423
-I slaved.

741
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:04,512
-Here, I'll pass that
down to you.

742
00:52:06,297 --> 00:52:07,689
-I'd like to make a toast.

743
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:11,432
-Ooh, okay.
-Okay.

744
00:52:11,476 --> 00:52:13,782
I would like to propose
a toast to Margot,

745
00:52:13,826 --> 00:52:15,523
for putting this all together

746
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:19,788
and making our last Christmas
here so special.

747
00:52:19,832 --> 00:52:22,269
This is really a great tribute
to Mom and Dad.

748
00:52:22,313 --> 00:52:23,662
-To Margot!

749
00:52:23,705 --> 00:52:24,924
-To Margot.
-To Margot.

750
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:27,796
-Cheers.

751
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,716
-Margs, what is it?

752
00:52:38,242 --> 00:52:40,505
-I came here knowing that
this would be our last Christmas

753
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:44,422
at this house
and here on the Cape.

754
00:52:44,465 --> 00:52:47,729
But after I got here and saw
how final all this was,

755
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:51,124
I realized how much I really
don't want to sell this house.

756
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,126
-Margot.

757
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:57,783
We have so many memories here.
I don't want to let that go.

758
00:52:57,826 --> 00:53:01,265
-Well, Jeff,
you want to chime in?

759
00:53:01,308 --> 00:53:05,182
-It's not really my place.

760
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:07,401
-I thought you knew
this was for the best.

761
00:53:07,445 --> 00:53:09,098
-Is it though?

762
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,538
-Margs, we could
really use the money.

763
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:17,672
I mean, we have college
to think about.

764
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:21,241
-Right, but it's not just
about the money for me.

765
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:24,636
-This place will fall apart
if no one's here to maintain it.

766
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:27,726
Who's going to take care of it
when you go back to Boston?

767
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:30,207
-I don't know. I haven't got
that far in my thinking yet.

768
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,295
-Well, it sounds like
you haven't

769
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:32,905
thought this through at all,

770
00:53:32,948 --> 00:53:34,994
that you're just basing it
on emotion.

771
00:53:35,037 --> 00:53:36,952
-And what's wrong with that?

772
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:40,608
-It's too expensive to keep.
The property taxes alone.

773
00:53:40,652 --> 00:53:44,264
I mean, look, the realtor
already has a buyer lined up.

774
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:47,441
All we have to do
is sign the papers.

775
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:50,792
-I love this house and
I don't want to sell it.

776
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:53,012
-Margot.

777
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:54,753
-We already lost Mom and Dad.

778
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:57,712
How can you let
this place go too?

779
00:53:57,756 --> 00:53:59,758
-Of course I miss Mom and Dad,

780
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:02,674
but I was really hoping not to
have this kind of conversation.

781
00:54:02,717 --> 00:54:07,026
-Avoiding a conversation is not
the way to solve a problem.

782
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:08,941
-Okay, think practically.

783
00:54:08,984 --> 00:54:12,031
Both Tom and I believe that this
is the best thing for all of us.

784
00:54:12,074 --> 00:54:13,380
-You know what?

785
00:54:13,424 --> 00:54:15,295
Christmas isn't the time
for practicality.

786
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:17,689
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going for a walk.

787
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:21,813
-Margot?

788
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:23,771
Hey.

789
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,426
Oh, honey.

790
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,036
Come on in.

791
00:56:39,831 --> 00:56:41,441
-Hey, you still awake?

792
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:43,443
-Yeah.

793
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:44,966
-What you reading?

794
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,794
-Aunty Margot's book.

795
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:50,929
-Cool. What do you think?

796
00:56:50,972 --> 00:56:53,148
-Why was she so upset
tonight at dinner?

797
00:57:01,635 --> 00:57:05,334
-She loves this house
and doesn't want to sell it.

798
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:08,033
-Do you want to sell it?

799
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:11,471
-Well, it's not really up to me.

800
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:15,257
It's up to your mother
and her siblings.

801
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:18,086
-I don't have to go
to college, Dad.

802
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,958
I want to keep the house, too.

803
00:57:24,005 --> 00:57:25,572
-Did you read all the way
to the end of the book?

804
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:27,182
-Yeah.

805
00:57:27,226 --> 00:57:28,749
-Read me
the last couple of pages.

806
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:32,797
-"A home is more than
bricks and blocks

807
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,016
and windows and locks.

808
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,758
A home is more than a bed
or where you rest your head.

809
00:57:39,934 --> 00:57:41,588
They say that home
is where the heart is,

810
00:57:41,632 --> 00:57:43,503
and Caroline knew
that to be true.

811
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:48,595
What she didn't realize is
that your home is within you."

812
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:51,468
-And what does
that mean to you?

813
00:57:51,511 --> 00:57:53,078
-I guess that no matter
where you go,

814
00:57:53,121 --> 00:57:54,688
you take your home with you?

815
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:57,256
-That's right.

816
00:57:57,299 --> 00:58:01,390
We'll always have the memories
of this place in our hearts,

817
00:58:01,434 --> 00:58:03,088
and we'll always
have each other,

818
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:05,394
no matter where we go,

819
00:58:05,438 --> 00:58:07,396
especially at Christmas time.

820
00:58:10,095 --> 00:58:14,055
-I still don't want to
sell the house, Dad.

821
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:17,537
-I know.

822
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:19,147
You get some sleep.

823
00:58:26,894 --> 00:58:30,202
-Good night, champ.
-Good night, Dad.

824
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:45,739
-Hey.
-Hey.

825
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:49,613
-Can we talk?

826
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:51,310
-Sure.

827
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,273
Why don't you sit down?

828
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,327
-So I --
-Look...

829
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:11,809
I shouldn't have
run out on you like that.

830
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:13,724
-I did a lot of thinking
while you were gone.

831
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:16,422
-No, no, no.

832
00:59:16,465 --> 00:59:18,598
You were right.

833
00:59:18,642 --> 00:59:21,819
I've decided to
agree to sell the house.

834
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:23,734
It's the practical thing to do.

835
00:59:23,777 --> 00:59:25,649
-What?

836
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:27,868
-It's just a house.

837
00:59:27,912 --> 00:59:30,436
It's not my family.
You are my family.

838
00:59:30,479 --> 00:59:34,179
-That's right, we are,
and we love you.

839
00:59:34,222 --> 00:59:36,007
We can have Christmas anywhere.

840
00:59:39,793 --> 00:59:42,013
But why the sudden change?

841
00:59:46,887 --> 00:59:49,411
-I think that the House

842
00:59:49,455 --> 00:59:53,241
helped me to feel connected
to Mom and Dad,

843
00:59:53,285 --> 00:59:54,765
but you can't relive the past.

844
00:59:54,808 --> 00:59:56,767
I know that now.

845
00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:00,858
You can remember it fondly,

846
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:03,774
but you can't relive it.

847
01:00:03,817 --> 01:00:05,471
-Well, you have us,

848
01:00:05,514 --> 01:00:07,604
and we're your
connection to Mom and Dad

849
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:10,215
and all the amazing memories
that we have.

850
01:00:14,306 --> 01:00:16,177
-I'm just having a hard time
letting go.

851
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:21,008
-It's totally understandable.

852
01:00:21,052 --> 01:00:22,836
-But I'll be okay.

853
01:00:25,926 --> 01:00:30,278
-Well, while you were gone,
I read your book "Homesick,"

854
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:35,675
and you talk about a home
not defining you,

855
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,416
that your home is within you.

856
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:44,989
-I guess it's hard to practice
what you preach sometimes.

857
01:00:45,032 --> 01:00:47,513
-You have given us
such an amazing

858
01:00:47,556 --> 01:00:51,865
Christmas gift this year,
just making it all so special.

859
01:00:54,172 --> 01:00:57,958
Hey, let's --
let's not spoil it, okay?

860
01:00:58,002 --> 01:01:00,439
-Okay.

861
01:01:00,482 --> 01:01:03,268
In my head, I know you're right.

862
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:06,140
It's just my heart, you know?

863
01:01:08,534 --> 01:01:10,971
-Yeah, I know.

864
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:13,931
-I want you to have that money
for Ace and his college

865
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:15,236
and for your family.

866
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,499
It's important.

867
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:25,072
I'm going to head off to bed.
It's been a long day.

868
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:27,814
-Okay, sleep tight.

869
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:31,122
Love you, sis.
-I love you, too.

870
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,910
-Here we go.

871
01:03:46,953 --> 01:03:48,737
-Oh!
-Oh, big five!

872
01:03:48,781 --> 01:03:51,088
One, two, three, four -- ohh!

873
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:52,872
On Vienna? Ace?
-Yes!

874
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,787
-How did you do it? Alright.

875
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,049
-So good.
-$2,000.

876
01:03:56,093 --> 01:03:57,746
-You got me. I'm out.

877
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:02,751
-You did it!
Alright, your turn.

878
01:04:09,715 --> 01:04:11,673
-Hi.
-Hi, is Margot here?

879
01:04:11,717 --> 01:04:14,024
I'm --
-Christian Williams.

880
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:17,592
-Yeah. How'd you know?
-I remember you.

881
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:18,898
Come on in.
-Thanks,

882
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:20,291
-Margot.

883
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:24,164
-Hey.

884
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:25,774
I brought you guys
some Christmas cookies

885
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:27,124
from that new bakery in town.

886
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:29,082
-Oh, thank you.
-Best on the Cape.

887
01:04:29,126 --> 01:04:31,998
-So nice of you.

888
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:33,870
-Thanks.

889
01:04:36,437 --> 01:04:39,005
-Ace, why don't you you come
help me get lunch organized?

890
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:47,579
-So it's, uh, it's all done.

891
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:51,104
I think you're really
gonna like it.

892
01:04:51,148 --> 01:04:53,846
-Thank you. Really.

893
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,543
-So how'd dinner go last night?

894
01:04:55,587 --> 01:04:58,503
Did you get her to agree
not to sell the house?

895
01:04:58,546 --> 01:05:03,073
-I changed my mind. I decided
I'm going to let them sell it.

896
01:05:03,116 --> 01:05:07,164
-Really?
-Yeah. I was being selfish.

897
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:08,730
They could use the money,
and I was just

898
01:05:08,774 --> 01:05:10,297
holding on to old memories.

899
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:12,386
-Surprised to hear you say that.

900
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:15,476
-I think reality finally set in.

901
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,478
-Hey, did I...

902
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:20,960
do something to upset you,
because you seem angry with me.

903
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:23,441
-No.

904
01:05:23,484 --> 01:05:25,443
-Margot.

905
01:05:25,486 --> 01:05:27,314
Talk to me.

906
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,369
-What?

907
01:05:38,412 --> 01:05:41,111
-I saw you.
-You saw me what?

908
01:05:41,154 --> 01:05:43,940
-Last night, at the restaurant,
I saw you.

909
01:05:43,983 --> 01:05:45,419
-That.

910
01:05:45,463 --> 01:05:47,639
-And I mean,
I have no right to be mad.

911
01:05:47,682 --> 01:05:49,597
It's your life, you've traveled
all over the world,

912
01:05:49,641 --> 01:05:51,686
and it would be naive to think
that you and I

913
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:53,384
could even possibly...

914
01:05:53,427 --> 01:05:55,864
I mean, what we had was
when we were kids.

915
01:05:55,908 --> 01:05:57,214
It's so long ago.
-Margot.

916
01:05:57,257 --> 01:05:58,955
-And it's none of my business.

917
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:01,392
It's just that
I was caught by surprise

918
01:06:01,435 --> 01:06:02,959
and I was hurt.
-Margot!

919
01:06:03,002 --> 01:06:05,396
-But I'm fine.
-Margot, that was my sister.

920
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:10,444
-What?
-Yeah, that was my sister.

921
01:06:10,488 --> 01:06:13,186
She's in town for a few days
before Christmas.

922
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:16,233
She leaves for New York
to see her fiance today.

923
01:06:16,276 --> 01:06:18,757
-Oh.

924
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,586
I feel like an idiot.

925
01:06:21,629 --> 01:06:26,417
-Listen, there is no
other woman in my life,

926
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:30,116
and ever since I saw you
a few days ago at the bookstore,

927
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,033
I haven't been able to think
about anybody but you.

928
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:36,253
-Really?
-Really.

929
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:39,734
But it is kind of cute.

930
01:06:39,778 --> 01:06:42,128
-What?
-You were jealous.

931
01:06:42,172 --> 01:06:43,956
-Yeah.

932
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,479
-That means you care.

933
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:49,353
-I do.
-Yeah.

934
01:06:51,572 --> 01:06:53,487
-Christian.
-Hmm?

935
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:56,186
-Would you like to
join us for dinner tonight?

936
01:06:56,229 --> 01:06:58,057
We're going to
the Christmas stroll after.

937
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:01,060
-I would love to.

938
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:02,496
-Did I interrupt something?

939
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:05,064
-Kinda.

940
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:06,587
-Okay, we'll see you later then.

941
01:07:06,631 --> 01:07:08,850
-Okay, what time should I be
back for dinner?

942
01:07:08,894 --> 01:07:12,941
-5:00.
-Yeah, 5:00 is great.

943
01:07:12,985 --> 01:07:15,509
-Okay. Thank you for the invite.

944
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:19,992
Are you sure you want me
to come back for dinner?

945
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,995
-Yes, absolutely.
-Okay.

946
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,128
I just have to take care
of a few things.

947
01:07:25,171 --> 01:07:27,695
-Okay.
-Okay.

948
01:07:27,739 --> 01:07:30,785
And I am really sorry
for the misunderstanding.

949
01:07:30,829 --> 01:07:32,613
I never meant to hurt you.

950
01:07:32,657 --> 01:07:36,965
-No, I'm the one who should be
apologizing to you.

951
01:07:37,009 --> 01:07:39,055
I'm not normally like this,
I swear.

952
01:07:39,098 --> 01:07:41,666
I just -- I have
a lot going on right now.

953
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:45,104
-I know.
I hope you like the painting.

954
01:08:21,271 --> 01:08:23,142
-Oh, wow.

955
01:09:06,751 --> 01:09:08,709
- Hi, you've reached Judith!

956
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:12,191
Unlike most people, I still
listen to voice messages,

957
01:09:12,235 --> 01:09:14,062
so why don't you leave me one?

958
01:09:15,716 --> 01:09:17,283
-Hey, Judith, it's Margot.

959
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:19,503
You mentioned that I needed

960
01:09:19,546 --> 01:09:22,419
some more international
recognition as an author.

961
01:09:22,462 --> 01:09:25,291
I'm not saying it's a done deal,
but I might have the opportunity

962
01:09:25,335 --> 01:09:28,164
to have Christian Williams
illustrate my next book.

963
01:09:28,207 --> 01:09:29,730
I was just wondering
what that would mean

964
01:09:29,774 --> 01:09:31,428
in terms of an advance.

965
01:09:31,471 --> 01:09:33,256
Thanks.

966
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:35,258
Oh, and merry Christmas.

967
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,527
-I can't believe you guys
are leaving tomorrow.

968
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:45,006
-I know.

969
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,747
Jeff's parents
are dying to see Ace.

970
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:49,446
-I bet. He's the best.

971
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:52,449
-Hey, thanks for
making this so special.

972
01:09:52,492 --> 01:09:55,060
Let's enjoy our last night here
as a family, though, okay?

973
01:09:55,103 --> 01:09:56,757
-Deal.

974
01:09:56,801 --> 01:09:59,891
-It's been so great
hanging out with you.

975
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:01,632
We shouldn't let it go
so long next time.

976
01:10:01,675 --> 01:10:03,677
-Yeah.
-Once we sell the house,

977
01:10:03,721 --> 01:10:05,723
I'll be able to afford to come
visit you more in Boston.

978
01:10:05,766 --> 01:10:08,073
-That'd be great.

979
01:10:08,116 --> 01:10:12,338
-So...what was going on
with you and Christian?

980
01:10:12,382 --> 01:10:15,298
-Well, nothing. I just made
a total idiot of myself.

981
01:10:15,341 --> 01:10:16,864
-How?
-Well...

982
01:10:16,908 --> 01:10:19,171
I saw him out last night
with another woman.

983
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,652
Turns out, it was a sister.
-Oh boy.

984
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:24,220
-And you thought...
-Yeah.

985
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:26,134
-You're such a drama queen.

986
01:10:34,578 --> 01:10:36,057
-Hi.
-Hi.

987
01:10:36,101 --> 01:10:37,407
-Come in.
-Merry Christmas.

988
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:39,887
-Merry Christmas.
-I brought you guys wine.

989
01:10:39,931 --> 01:10:43,891
-Oh, awesome. Wow.

990
01:10:43,935 --> 01:10:44,979
I'm going to go
let this baby breathe.

991
01:10:45,023 --> 01:10:47,678
-Okay.

992
01:10:47,721 --> 01:10:49,549
-Do you want to take
off your coat?

993
01:10:49,593 --> 01:10:51,377
-Yes, please.

994
01:10:55,686 --> 01:10:59,559
-Wow. You look amazing.

995
01:10:59,603 --> 01:11:01,474
-You don't look too bad
yourself.

996
01:11:01,518 --> 01:11:03,911
-Thanks.
-Come on.

997
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:10,875
-Christian, it's a pleasure
having you here.

998
01:11:10,918 --> 01:11:13,269
-Oh, thank you.
This all looks delicious.

999
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:14,705
-Margot really stepped up
to the plate this year

1000
01:11:14,748 --> 01:11:16,446
with all the cooking
and decorating.

1001
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:18,622
-Hello!

1002
01:11:18,665 --> 01:11:20,580
-Tom!
-Whoa!

1003
01:11:20,624 --> 01:11:22,669
-Merry Christmas!

1004
01:11:22,713 --> 01:11:24,105
-Oh, my gosh!

1005
01:11:24,149 --> 01:11:25,803
-We didn't think
you were coming!

1006
01:11:25,846 --> 01:11:27,370
-I couldn't not show up

1007
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:29,328
on our last Christmas
in this house.

1008
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:31,722
-Come on, Uncle Tom.
Dinner's getting cold.

1009
01:11:31,765 --> 01:11:33,985
-Whoa.
-Merry Christmas, Tom.

1010
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:36,335
-Merry Christmas, everyone.

1011
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:39,469
-Hey, I know this pot roast.
-Mm-hmm.

1012
01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:41,253
-Let me do the honors.

1013
01:11:47,433 --> 01:11:49,957
-It's so good to see you, Tom.

1014
01:11:50,001 --> 01:11:52,830
-I can't believe all you've
done to this place.

1015
01:11:52,873 --> 01:11:54,484
I haven't seen the house
look this Christmas-y

1016
01:11:54,527 --> 01:11:56,137
since we were kids.

1017
01:11:56,181 --> 01:11:58,096
-I can't believe you came.

1018
01:11:58,139 --> 01:12:01,360
-Wow.
My reputation's that bad, huh?

1019
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:03,406
-I'm just glad to see you.

1020
01:12:03,449 --> 01:12:05,451
-Well, I canceled the last leg
of my trip

1021
01:12:05,495 --> 01:12:06,670
and hopped on a flight standby.

1022
01:12:06,713 --> 01:12:08,193
I would have called,

1023
01:12:08,236 --> 01:12:10,761
but I thought a surprise
would be more fun.

1024
01:12:10,804 --> 01:12:13,851
-Yeah, it was a great surprise.

1025
01:12:13,894 --> 01:12:17,724
-Christian,
what a blast from the past.

1026
01:12:17,768 --> 01:12:21,380
I think the last time I saw you,

1027
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:24,078
Margot was all gaga,
chasing you around.

1028
01:12:24,122 --> 01:12:26,342
-I was not gaga.

1029
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:31,259
-What was that old
Paul Anka song, "Puppy Love."

1030
01:12:31,303 --> 01:12:33,392
-Stop it.

1031
01:12:33,436 --> 01:12:37,962
-No, it's been really
nice getting reacquainted.

1032
01:12:38,005 --> 01:12:40,399
-Oh, so I brought the papers
from the realtor

1033
01:12:40,443 --> 01:12:42,314
for everyone to sign
for the house.

1034
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,839
-We can deal with that later.
-Excuse me for a moment.

1035
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:50,017
-Uh, what'd I say?

1036
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:53,456
-She's just taking it harder
than the rest of us.

1037
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:56,894
-Hmm.
-Is she okay?

1038
01:12:56,937 --> 01:12:58,591
-I don't know.

1039
01:12:59,984 --> 01:13:02,465
So, Christian,

1040
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:04,075
how long have you
been back on the Cape?

1041
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:05,946
-A couple of months.

1042
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:08,427
-Is it the same as you remember?

1043
01:13:08,471 --> 01:13:13,954
-With age comes perspective,
so I have to say it's better.

1044
01:13:18,785 --> 01:13:21,135
I just wanted to say
that this has been

1045
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:22,485
one of the best Christmases

1046
01:13:22,528 --> 01:13:26,880
that I've had
in a really long time.

1047
01:13:26,924 --> 01:13:28,621
Ever since Mom and Dad died,

1048
01:13:28,665 --> 01:13:32,756
I got so focused on my career
and then this house

1049
01:13:32,799 --> 01:13:36,412
that I didn't take any time
to focus on all of you,

1050
01:13:36,455 --> 01:13:39,023
my family.

1051
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:40,851
I came back here
and I ran into Christian

1052
01:13:40,894 --> 01:13:43,027
and found out
that he was an artist.

1053
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:46,160
Well, actually, you've been
an artist your whole life,

1054
01:13:46,204 --> 01:13:48,511
ever since we were kids.

1055
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:53,341
But it turns out that
you're quite the famous artist.

1056
01:13:53,385 --> 01:13:54,778
But of course, you being you,

1057
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:57,737
you didn't say anything
about that.

1058
01:13:57,781 --> 01:13:59,609
Anyway,

1059
01:13:59,652 --> 01:14:03,351
I had Christian paint you
a Christmas present, Meredith.

1060
01:14:05,571 --> 01:14:08,922
-Wow.

1061
01:14:08,966 --> 01:14:12,230
-Wow!

1062
01:14:12,273 --> 01:14:15,494
-It's beautiful, Christian.
-That's -- that's incredible.

1063
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:18,715
-I want you to know I'm okay
with selling the house.

1064
01:14:18,758 --> 01:14:20,760
I wasn't initially, but I'll
sign whatever paperwork

1065
01:14:20,804 --> 01:14:23,415
you need me to sign
before you go.

1066
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,547
I just wanted you
to have something

1067
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:26,462
to remember the place by.

1068
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:28,333
-It's so lovely.

1069
01:14:30,422 --> 01:14:32,990
Really. Thank you, Margot.

1070
01:14:33,033 --> 01:14:35,775
But I really feel like you
should keep the painting.

1071
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:40,171
-Absolutely not. It's yours.

1072
01:14:40,214 --> 01:14:41,955
-Margs,

1073
01:14:41,999 --> 01:14:44,088
I had no idea
he didn't want to sell,

1074
01:14:44,131 --> 01:14:47,657
but I'm glad
you're okay with it.

1075
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,137
-Me, too.

1076
01:14:50,181 --> 01:14:55,316
-Okay, so I know
I haven't been around much,

1077
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:59,582
but I'm going to make it
my Christmas promise

1078
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:02,367
to try and make you guys
more of a priority.

1079
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:04,412
-You better.

1080
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:07,938
-Who's ready for
the Christmas stroll?

1081
01:15:07,981 --> 01:15:10,375
-Yeah!
-Yes, let's roll.

1082
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:07,345
-You know, you really
are quite the artist.

1083
01:16:07,388 --> 01:16:09,652
-And you are quite the writer.

1084
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:11,523
-No, I mean it.

1085
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,265
Even before I knew it was you,
I was drawn to your work.

1086
01:16:14,308 --> 01:16:16,441
And then Jacklyn said
that you had a reputation

1087
01:16:16,484 --> 01:16:20,053
and I was worried you were
a ladies man, a Casanova.

1088
01:16:20,097 --> 01:16:21,489
-Hardly.

1089
01:16:21,533 --> 01:16:23,753
But that does explain a lot.

1090
01:16:23,796 --> 01:16:25,189
-Well, then I looked you up
and it turns out

1091
01:16:25,232 --> 01:16:27,017
that you do have a reputation --

1092
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:29,236
a worldwide reputation.

1093
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,369
-You didn't know that?
-Mnh-mnh.

1094
01:16:31,412 --> 01:16:34,372
Not before last night.
-You're kidding.

1095
01:16:34,415 --> 01:16:36,635
I thought that's why you
wanted me to paint your house.

1096
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:38,724
-No, I wanted you
to paint the house

1097
01:16:38,768 --> 01:16:42,946
because I like your work
and I kind of like you.

1098
01:16:45,862 --> 01:16:50,736
-Where are we going?
-Come with me.

1099
01:16:52,085 --> 01:16:53,957
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1100
01:17:01,486 --> 01:17:02,835
-The carolers were
really good this year.

1101
01:17:02,879 --> 01:17:04,707
-They were.

1102
01:17:06,839 --> 01:17:08,798
-What are we doing?

1103
01:17:08,841 --> 01:17:11,975
-Oh, well, it is time to make
good on your end of the bargain.

1104
01:17:12,018 --> 01:17:14,238
-What?
-Oh, I want to draw you again.

1105
01:17:14,281 --> 01:17:17,371
-I don't know what to do.
I feel so awkward.

1106
01:17:17,415 --> 01:17:20,810
-No, you're just going
to sit right over here.

1107
01:17:20,853 --> 01:17:23,160
-Yep. Perfect. Down there.

1108
01:17:23,203 --> 01:17:26,642
And then talk to me.

1109
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:29,645
-I look a mess.
-No, you look beautiful.

1110
01:17:36,129 --> 01:17:38,392
This is so uncomfortable.

1111
01:17:38,436 --> 01:17:40,786
-No, this is perfect.

1112
01:17:42,614 --> 01:17:44,616
Tell me a story.

1113
01:18:39,018 --> 01:18:41,368
-Tilt your chin
just a little bit up.

1114
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,025
-Can I look yet?

1115
01:18:46,069 --> 01:18:47,592
-It's almost done.

1116
01:18:47,635 --> 01:18:49,768
-Ugh, the anticipation
is killing me.

1117
01:18:49,812 --> 01:18:51,944
-Patience.

1118
01:18:55,992 --> 01:18:58,124
-Oh, one sec.
-Yeah, go ahead.

1119
01:18:58,168 --> 01:18:59,691
-Hi, Judith.

1120
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,955
-Margot, it's Judith.
-I know.

1121
01:19:02,999 --> 01:19:04,870
Who else is working
at 9:00 on Christmas Eve?

1122
01:19:04,914 --> 01:19:07,525
It's my agent.
-Oh, okay.

1123
01:19:07,568 --> 01:19:10,484
-I got your message
and I ran your idea about

1124
01:19:10,528 --> 01:19:12,660
Christian Williams
illustrating your new book

1125
01:19:12,704 --> 01:19:14,184
up the flagpole.

1126
01:19:14,227 --> 01:19:16,969
-And?
-The publishers love it.

1127
01:19:17,013 --> 01:19:19,624
Christian's global fan base
could mean big business for us.

1128
01:19:19,667 --> 01:19:21,495
It's a whole different
audience.

1129
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:24,107
-Wow, that's fantastic.

1130
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:30,026
-And they're willing to offer
you a six-figure advance.

1131
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:32,942
-What? That's incredible.

1132
01:19:32,985 --> 01:19:36,641
-I figured that was news worth
sharing on Christmas Eve.

1133
01:19:36,684 --> 01:19:39,600
-Is it ever?
W-- Thank you, Judith.

1134
01:19:39,644 --> 01:19:41,994
-We'll sort out the details
after the holidays.

1135
01:19:42,038 --> 01:19:44,344
-Yes, of course, yeah.

1136
01:19:44,388 --> 01:19:47,652
That is one heck
of a Christmas gift.

1137
01:19:47,695 --> 01:19:52,048
-Merry Christmas, doll.
-Merry Christmas.

1138
01:19:52,091 --> 01:19:53,832
-What?

1139
01:19:53,876 --> 01:19:56,835
Come on, now the anticipation
is killing me.

1140
01:19:56,879 --> 01:19:58,663
-I think I have a way of
buying out my siblings

1141
01:19:58,706 --> 01:20:00,012
and keeping the house.

1142
01:20:00,056 --> 01:20:02,232
-How?

1143
01:20:02,275 --> 01:20:06,149
-Oh, my gosh.
This is unbelievable.

1144
01:20:06,192 --> 01:20:08,020
Um...

1145
01:20:08,064 --> 01:20:09,630
Christian, that was my agent.

1146
01:20:09,674 --> 01:20:11,632
-Yeah, I know. You said that.
What did she say?

1147
01:20:11,676 --> 01:20:14,113
-I sort of bounced
the idea off of her

1148
01:20:14,157 --> 01:20:19,684
about the possibility of you
illustrating my next book.

1149
01:20:19,727 --> 01:20:22,992
-I see.

1150
01:20:23,035 --> 01:20:24,776
-And she just told me that
the publishing company

1151
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,343
loves that idea

1152
01:20:26,386 --> 01:20:29,389
and they'd be willing
to give me -- us --

1153
01:20:29,433 --> 01:20:31,739
They'd be willing to give us
a big advance.

1154
01:20:36,353 --> 01:20:38,398
-If you're interested,
of course.

1155
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,011
-I don't know, uh...

1156
01:20:42,054 --> 01:20:45,362
I've never illustrated
a children's book before.

1157
01:20:45,405 --> 01:20:48,756
-I know, but you're going to be
amazing. I know it.

1158
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,672
It's --

1159
01:20:51,716 --> 01:20:54,458
That's beautiful.

1160
01:20:54,501 --> 01:20:58,331
-Yeah, do you think
I have the chops?

1161
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:00,812
-You definitely have the chops.

1162
01:21:03,032 --> 01:21:04,860
-And...

1163
01:21:07,297 --> 01:21:10,648
I'd be honored to illustrate
your children's book with you.

1164
01:21:13,651 --> 01:21:16,088
-Really?
-Really.

1165
01:21:16,132 --> 01:21:18,961
-Really?
-Really.

1166
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:21,267
-Oh.
-Thank you.

1167
01:21:21,311 --> 01:21:25,054
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1168
01:21:25,097 --> 01:21:27,317
You've no idea
how much this means to me.

1169
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,754
-Oh, I think I have an inkling.

1170
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,884
-This has been
the most wonderful Christmas,

1171
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:15,582
but I have one more gift
for both of you.

1172
01:22:15,626 --> 01:22:17,933
-No more gifts.
You've given us enough already.

1173
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:19,760
-You sure have.

1174
01:22:19,804 --> 01:22:23,939
This has been the perfect
goodbye to this place.

1175
01:22:23,982 --> 01:22:26,985
And now I don't have to leave
Harbour Island anymore

1176
01:22:27,029 --> 01:22:29,292
when it's freezing cold up here.

1177
01:22:29,335 --> 01:22:32,512
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1178
01:22:32,556 --> 01:22:34,906
-Hey, am I too late?
-No, no, no.

1179
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:38,040
I just gave them their presents.
Come in.

1180
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,607
Open them up! Open them up!
-Margs.

1181
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:43,871
What's going on?
-Open your present.

1182
01:22:49,877 --> 01:22:51,662
I want to buy the house.

1183
01:22:51,705 --> 01:22:56,145
I'll give both of you full
market value for your third.

1184
01:22:56,188 --> 01:22:58,277
Christian and I just got

1185
01:22:58,321 --> 01:23:00,453
quite a lucrative deal
for a new children's book,

1186
01:23:00,497 --> 01:23:02,542
which I'll write
and he'll illustrate.

1187
01:23:02,586 --> 01:23:04,588
It's called "The Family Tree,"

1188
01:23:04,631 --> 01:23:07,199
and it's about
a giant red beech tree

1189
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:11,203
that grows in the yard
of a very special Cape Cod home.

1190
01:23:11,247 --> 01:23:14,337
The tree, in its quiet wisdom,
is the guiding force

1191
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:18,167
for the generations of family
that live in this house.

1192
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:22,171
My Christmas wish
is that you'll allow me

1193
01:23:22,214 --> 01:23:25,870
to be the steward of this place
and keep it in the family

1194
01:23:25,913 --> 01:23:29,917
because we, this family,
are what make a house a home.

1195
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:34,661
-Jeez. Wow.

1196
01:23:36,707 --> 01:23:38,796
-Does this mean we're
keeping the house, Dad?

1197
01:23:38,839 --> 01:23:40,450
-It means Auntie Margot's
keeping the house,

1198
01:23:40,493 --> 01:23:42,930
but I'll bet
she'll let us visit.

1199
01:23:42,974 --> 01:23:45,977
-Anytime you want.

1200
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,500
So is that a yes?

1201
01:23:47,544 --> 01:23:49,372
-Yes!
-Yes!

1202
01:23:54,246 --> 01:23:55,943
-You better come back
next year, Tom.

1203
01:23:55,987 --> 01:24:00,383
-I wouldn't miss it.
Hey, I'm proud of you, sis.

1204
01:24:00,426 --> 01:24:02,863
You made it happen,
and nothing makes me happier

1205
01:24:02,907 --> 01:24:05,127
than keeping
this house in the family.

1206
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:07,433
-I love you.
-Love you, too.

1207
01:24:12,003 --> 01:24:15,398
-See you, Tom.

1208
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:17,182
-You better take good care
of this house.

1209
01:24:17,226 --> 01:24:20,707
-You hear me?
-I will. You know I will.

1210
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:22,927
-Well, actually, go ahead
and trash it. It's yours now.

1211
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:24,929
-No, it's still all of ours.

1212
01:24:24,972 --> 01:24:27,627
I'm just paying
the mortgage now.

1213
01:24:27,671 --> 01:24:29,325
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1214
01:24:29,368 --> 01:24:32,023
-Thanks, Margot.
That was wonderful.

1215
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,764
-Happy New Year, Aunt Margot.

1216
01:24:33,807 --> 01:24:35,026
I'm glad you're
keeping the house.

1217
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,550
-Me, too.

1218
01:24:37,594 --> 01:24:39,770
-Nice to meet you, Christian.
-See you.

1219
01:24:42,164 --> 01:24:45,036
-Drive safe, guys.

1220
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,082
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

1221
01:24:51,651 --> 01:24:53,740
C'mere,
I have something for you.

1222
01:24:53,784 --> 01:24:56,178
-What, why?
-'Cause it's Christmas.

1223
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:58,441
-No, you've given me
so much already.

1224
01:24:58,484 --> 01:25:00,530
-Come on.

1225
01:25:11,715 --> 01:25:16,676
-What is this?
-Just sit.

1226
01:25:23,379 --> 01:25:25,163
-Merry Christmas.

1227
01:25:27,992 --> 01:25:29,559
-You kept it,
after all this time?

1228
01:25:29,602 --> 01:25:31,343
-Of course I did.

1229
01:25:31,387 --> 01:25:34,781
And it led me home,
just like you said it would.

1230
01:25:38,785 --> 01:25:40,787
-It led me home, too.

1231
01:27:42,039 --> 01:27:45,999
Snow is falling down

1232
01:28:26,736 --> 01:28:30,348
- Snow is falling down

1233
01:28:59,421 --> 01:29:03,468
- Snow is falling now
