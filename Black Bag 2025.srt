1
00:01:14,212 --> 00:01:16,455
I’m here to see Mr. Meacham.

2
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,545
You were right, George.

3
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:48,961
We have a traitor in the house.

4
00:02:50,308 --> 00:02:53,207
There are five names on there.

5
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:55,899
Your wife’s one of them.

6
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:57,246
Why is that?

7
00:02:57,384 --> 00:02:58,730
You asked me
to look at everyone.

8
00:02:58,868 --> 00:03:00,525
I looked.

9
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:02,354
She has the security clearance,
she has the motive,

10
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:04,425
and she has the capability.

11
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:06,738
I had to put her down.

12
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:09,016
How long do you think
you’ll need?

13
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:10,811
Give me two weeks.

14
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:13,054
If Severus is deployed
as intended,

15
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,125
thousands of innocent people
will die.

16
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:17,231
Okay. One week.

17
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:21,235
If it is Kathryn, do you
really think you can do that?

18
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:25,032
How’s Anna?

19
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:29,899
Still mad.

20
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:32,488
- I’m sorry.
- I made a mistake, that’s all.

21
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,075
She just can’t let it go.

22
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,663
She will, eventually.

23
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:37,389
Yeah?

24
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:41,393
Some things really are best
swept under the rug.

25
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:45,570
I just wish
it wasn’t so fucking easy.

26
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:48,331
To cheat.

27
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:49,401
For us.

28
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:51,403
Mm.

29
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:57,029
Not everyone aspires to
your flagrant monogamy, George.

30
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,102
If you’d like Anna
to be less angry,

31
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,898
you might consider going home.

32
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:15,047
Good luck finding the rat.

33
00:05:35,058 --> 00:05:37,682
I can feel
when you’re watching me.

34
00:05:38,786 --> 00:05:40,098
Sorry.

35
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:42,859
I like it.

36
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:46,932
I understand this is not

37
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,658
the casual dinner you’d prefer.

38
00:05:48,796 --> 00:05:51,696
Yeah. It’s an unusual group.

39
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:57,322
Data scraper, two agents
and the in-house shrink.

40
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:01,361
What are we hunting this time?

41
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:03,121
Severus.

42
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:06,883
And you think
one of them took it?

43
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:08,644
Possibly.

44
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,024
Hmm.

45
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:15,271
It’s been a while since
we had a traitor to dinner.

46
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,377
At least knowingly.

47
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,897
We shouldn’t be discussing this.

48
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:22,796
No, probably not.

49
00:06:23,762 --> 00:06:26,489
I would’ve thought
you’d start with polygraphs.

50
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:29,872
I wanted to try something
more elegant first.

51
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:33,910
What’s on the menu?

52
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:35,912
Fun and games.

53
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:38,915
Will there be
a mess to clean up?

54
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:40,296
With any luck.

55
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,819
- They suit you.
- Mm.

56
00:06:45,957 --> 00:06:48,580
No, you spent too much.

57
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:51,514
It’s boring how much
you think about money.

58
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:56,726
It’s terrifying
how much you don’t.

59
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,592
Avoid the chana masala.

60
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,320
Contains a healthy amount
of DZM 5.

61
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:08,220
Darling, you may not
dose our guests.

62
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,741
One of them is a liar.

63
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,398
I want to know which.

64
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:15,262
♪ I never thought
it would happen ♪

65
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,023
♪ With me and the girl
from Clapham ♪

66
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:19,956
♪ Out on the windy common ♪

67
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:21,855
♪ That night I ain’t forgotten ♪

68
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:23,615
♪ When she dealt out
the rations ♪

69
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:25,306
♪ With some
or other passions... ♪

70
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,101
- Matthew.
- Hello, sir.

71
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,587
I want to settle up
for the table by the door.

72
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:31,520
- Of course.
- And I’ll have a double Jameson.

73
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:32,762
Straightaway, sir.

74
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,974
I know they’re not
that much older, really,

75
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:41,426
but I kind of feel like
I’m going to my parents’ house.

76
00:07:41,564 --> 00:07:44,843
If-if they weren’t divorced
and didn’t hate each other.

77
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:46,396
Well, here’s what I know.

78
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:47,915
You don’t get invited
to dinner twice

79
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:49,952
if you say no the first time.

80
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,023
But why now?

81
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:54,128
With 24 hours’ notice?

82
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,405
And why us?

83
00:07:55,544 --> 00:07:57,511
We all work together.

84
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,755
Two couples in the same field.
It’s not that much of a reach.

85
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:01,722
So you believe
this was just spontaneous?

86
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,898
I’m assuming so until I see
reason to believe otherwise.

87
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:06,934
You and Freddie sitting
across from each other

88
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:08,729
after what just happened?

89
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,559
That could be read
as provocative.

90
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:13,113
Freddie’s fine.

91
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:14,286
Right?

92
00:08:15,702 --> 00:08:17,462
How should I know?

93
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,843
Ask the shrink.

94
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,569
Whose idea was it, do you think?

95
00:08:20,707 --> 00:08:22,260
- George or Kathryn?
- STOKES and CLARISSA: George.

96
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:24,469
- Sorry, sorry. So sorry.
- For fuck’s sake, Freddie.

97
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:26,195
I mean, you booked the table.

98
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,541
You’re the one that wanted
to meet beforehand.

99
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,060
I am absolutely at fault,
I admit it.

100
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:31,200
And Dr. Vaughan,
were she allowed to say so,

101
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:33,133
would claim
there’s a certain hostility

102
00:08:33,271 --> 00:08:34,514
in my chronic tardiness.

103
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:36,205
But in order
to make it up to you all,

104
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:37,344
I have paid the bill
and tipped like a gangster.

105
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:38,932
Oh, come on.

106
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,003
We are celebrating
James’s well-deserved,

107
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:43,764
meteoric ascent
through the ranks.

108
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:45,283
Cheers.

109
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:52,221
- Shall we?
- Right.

110
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:55,362
Wait.

111
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:59,918
I was hoping for some pointers.
I mean, how shall I behave?

112
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:03,715
Praise his cooking, and
I promise all will be magical.

113
00:09:16,935 --> 00:09:18,074
-Hello.
-Kathryn.

114
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:19,110
- Hello.
- On time and everything.

115
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:21,664
- Come in.
- Thank you.

116
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:22,838
Oh, shall I take that?

117
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,805
No, I’ll take it to the kitchen.

118
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:26,566
Come in.
Yes, it’s cold, isn’t it?

119
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:27,912
Hello.

120
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,396
- Lovely to see you.
- All right.

121
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:30,570
- I should take your coat.
- Wow.

122
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,399
Thank you.

123
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:35,713
This is, um... beautiful.

124
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:37,853
Oh, yeah.

125
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:39,924
The joys of
not having children, hey?

126
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:42,823
- What would you like to drink?
- Rum.

127
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:44,618
- Rum.
- Mmm.

128
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:47,690
- ’98 for the table.
- Right.

129
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:49,105
Oh, yes, lovely.

130
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:53,523
Should we get this over with?

131
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:56,078
I get it, why you went with him.

132
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:58,943
- Yes?
- James is the smart play.

133
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:01,290
Young, aggressive and--

134
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:03,361
How shall we say it?

135
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:05,087
Uncompromised.

136
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:06,778
I’d always hoped
it would be you.

137
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,297
I drink too much,
I fuck too much,

138
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:10,126
and I owe more than I’m worth.

139
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:16,892
The pills are becoming
a problem as well.

140
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,240
I’m so glad I can
confide in you, George.

141
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,484
I need to change.

142
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,525
<i>Oh, give them a break.</i>

143
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,908
Most of NCSC is 25-year-olds.

144
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:34,599
They were just mucking around,

145
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:36,359
trying to zero-day
a central router.

146
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:39,328
They didn’t know
they’d brick the whole system.

147
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:42,642
Wait. Syria 2012?

148
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,505
That was you?

149
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,024
- That was us?
- I don’t know.

150
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,612
I don’t work
on that side of the house.

151
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,649
That op was tight.
I’ve read that string.

152
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:51,409
It’s a very sexy piece of code.

153
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:54,067
Mm. It was all fine
till little Eddie Snowden

154
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:57,242
decided to call everybody out,
said it was a fuckup.

155
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,693
It shut Assad’s ass right down,
didn’t it?

156
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:02,489
How many civilians died
as a result?

157
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,077
Greater good.

158
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:06,251
Yeah, I don’t find
amorality attractive.

159
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:08,875
Then give up either your
profession or your sex life.

160
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:11,601
I give it two weeks.

161
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,017
Optimistic.

162
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:15,433
Did you get hell from oversight?

163
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:17,021
- Nothing I couldn’t handle.
- Oh, please.

164
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,436
The committee fucked with
Kathryn exactly once.

165
00:11:18,574 --> 00:11:20,024
Half of them lost
their assignments.

166
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:21,404
’Cause that’s what
bad bitches do.

167
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:27,203
Chana masala is fantastic,
by the way.

168
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:28,446
Absolutely delicious.

169
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:29,896
-Mm.
- Thank you.

170
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:31,691
Come on.

171
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:33,347
Syria’s hardly the worst thing
we’ve ever done.

172
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,142
I once outed my kid’s teacher
as a pedophile

173
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,281
just to get him fired.

174
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:37,593
Oh.

175
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,353
Figures.

176
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,079
Turns out the guy’s
eight-year-old had a rash.

177
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:42,667
Guess he shouldn’t have
emailed those pictures.

178
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:44,324
That is uniquely loathsome,
Freddie.

179
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:45,705
You hand me an angle, I play it.

180
00:11:45,843 --> 00:11:47,707
New teacher gave Matty an "A."

181
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:49,639
- Don’t fuck with SIS dad.
- So we’re all horrible people.

182
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:51,400
Is that what the point is here?

183
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:52,884
I prefer to say "complex."

184
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:55,024
And what’s wrong with
"patriotic"?

185
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:56,612
Come on, most of us
are sick as shit.

186
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,925
Nobody can lay a glove
on Oedipus over there.

187
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,860
What, you all don’t know
about that?

188
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:04,654
- Careful, Freddie.
- It’s common knowledge.

189
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:06,277
Well, that’s for him, not you.

190
00:12:06,415 --> 00:12:08,624
It’s all right.
But thank you, darling.

191
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,143
See?

192
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:12,904
- George can handle it.
- Handle what?

193
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:15,976
Little Georgie surveilled
his own father.

194
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:17,978
Ouch.

195
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:19,531
Oh, my.

196
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:20,947
Well...

197
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:25,261
Daddy was
an inveterate cheater.

198
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,608
Rarely if ever kept it
in his pants.

199
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,302
But he was senior service,
and he was,

200
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,477
shall we say, careful.

201
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,446
When half your life’s
in the black bag,

202
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:40,000
how’s little civilian wifey
ever gonna have a prayer

203
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:42,244
of knowing where
you’re sticking it?

204
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:44,971
- That’s crass.
- So was Thomas Woodhouse.

205
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:47,594
And his boy didn’t like that
one bit.

206
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:48,940
So what happened?

207
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:51,149
George got the goods on him.

208
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,358
On video.

209
00:12:53,496 --> 00:12:55,947
Played the tape one
Sunday night at a family dinner

210
00:12:56,085 --> 00:13:00,193
I would have paid money
to be present at.

211
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:04,093
George torched Daddy’s marriage

212
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:08,408
and his career at the same time.

213
00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:11,791
Who will ever hire a field op
who’s bested by his own kid?

214
00:13:13,137 --> 00:13:15,277
I don’t like liars.

215
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:19,799
You are so rock and roll.

216
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:22,663
That must have been
deeply traumatic.

217
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,148
How old were you?

218
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:26,529
Thirty-seven.

219
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,117
Oh.

220
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:29,463
Did your father not know
what you do for a living?

221
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,362
Oh, no, he knew.

222
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,882
Thomas just thought
he was very good.

223
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,745
George was better.

224
00:13:35,884 --> 00:13:38,748
I hear you’ve never been beaten
in the chair.

225
00:13:38,887 --> 00:13:41,406
You’re like some kind of legend.

226
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:43,477
Is it true?
No one can lie to you?

227
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,307
Better not to find out.

228
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:47,343
Well, when are you gonna
poly me, George?

229
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,834
Sorry.

230
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:56,939
Of course, what came after

231
00:13:57,077 --> 00:13:58,389
can hardly be blamed on George.

232
00:13:58,527 --> 00:13:59,873
I think that’s enough.

233
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:01,841
The man had been depressed
for 30 years.

234
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:03,394
Freddie, it ends.

235
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:04,774
- Right now.
-Shut the fuck up

236
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:06,086
when you talk to people,
Freddie.

237
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:08,399
I have a game.

238
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:14,025
We go around the table and
each of us makes a resolution.

239
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:16,683
The way you might at New Year.

240
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:20,825
Some personal issue
that needs to be addressed.

241
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:24,070
"I resolve to quit smoking,"
for example.

242
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:29,040
Oh, this is some
groundbreaking shit, George.

243
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:33,010
But we don’t make
the resolution for ourselves.

244
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:37,014
We make it for the person
to our right.

245
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,533
I’m not sure that’s a good idea.

246
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,604
I’m certain it’s a terrible one.

247
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:43,054
Are you joking?

248
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:44,642
I don’t believe he is.

249
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,852
- I’m in.
- I’m getting another bottle.

250
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,061
This is a new one.

251
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:52,201
Brand-new.

252
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:57,586
Well, I wasn’t aware
the agency would track that,

253
00:14:57,724 --> 00:14:59,553
but I’ll, um...
I’ll keep it in mind.

254
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,934
Thank you, George.

255
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:03,557
So, when you say
"erotic fiction..."

256
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,180
Leave the poor woman alone.

257
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:06,733
I don’t need defending.

258
00:15:07,837 --> 00:15:09,253
I like a dirty story.

259
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:11,980
It’s not a crime.

260
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:14,016
I believe it’s my turn.

261
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:15,293
Yeah?

262
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:16,398
Okay.

263
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:18,987
"I resolve to--"

264
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,749
Wait, I’m speaking
in his voice, yeah?

265
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:24,716
Okay.

266
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:27,133
"I resolve to do my best

267
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:28,962
to finish second
whenever possible."

268
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,722
Or once, even.

269
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,277
Once would be
a refreshing change of pace.

270
00:15:33,415 --> 00:15:35,175
- Sing it, sister.
- Trust me,

271
00:15:35,313 --> 00:15:37,005
one day, you’ll be thrilled
to finish at all.

272
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:39,662
You are so
full of shit, Freddie.

273
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,113
Note taken.
You’ll be begging me to stop.

274
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:44,115
Oh, what every woman longs for.

275
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:46,014
An endless, abrasive experience.

276
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:47,981
Let’s move on.

277
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,672
My turn.

278
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,950
This one’s for you, right?

279
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:53,538
Okay.

280
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:55,816
"I resolve to figure out

281
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,233
this old man obsession of mine."

282
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,304
Oh.

283
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:02,202
I figured that one out
a long time ago, hon.

284
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,343
Young men bore the shit
out of me.

285
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:08,036
I mean, you, you know,
you haven’t done anything.

286
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:09,830
You haven’t been anywhere.
All you want to do

287
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,832
is invite me over
to watch you play video games.

288
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:14,663
Oh, God.

289
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:16,044
Did I get that one right?

290
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:17,838
Second date:

291
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,358
<i> </i><i>Call of Duty: Pacific Theater.</i>

292
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:21,981
Well, this has been

293
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,879
- absolutely delightful.
-I may be old

294
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,398
and wizened, but at least I know

295
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:27,227
how to book
a decent restaurant, Major.

296
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:28,953
- It’s Colonel.
- Colonel Xbox.

297
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:30,748
- Okay.
- Major Minecraft.

298
00:16:30,886 --> 00:16:32,681
Fucking hilarious shit, mate.

299
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:34,407
Promise you’ll go down on him
while he plays <i>Zelda</i>

300
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:36,857
so he can die a happy
little soldier, won’t you?

301
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,514
Shut the fuck up, Freddie.

302
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:40,275
What is your problem tonight?

303
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:42,208
You know,
the real problem with old men

304
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:47,247
is the miserable,
suffocating fear of death.

305
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:50,181
I mean, it’s there, so...
so they can feel it,

306
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:54,047
and they are quite literally
pissing themselves with fear,

307
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:56,049
which I-I suppose explains

308
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:59,673
their pathetic, priapic lunging
at anything that moves.

309
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,090
I’m wondering if perhaps
you’ve had enough to drink.

310
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:05,679
But it’s my turn now, right?

311
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,234
I get to speak
for Freddie now, right?

312
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:19,797
"I’m gonna stop fucking her."

313
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:21,040
Well, I’m afraid I can’t,
gorgeous.

314
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:23,111
I am powerless before you.

315
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:25,216
Not me.

316
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:27,632
Her.

317
00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:35,537
Is this some sort of prank?

318
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:40,162
This is why you can’t
date SIGINT.

319
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,475
They’re all fucking insane.

320
00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:49,965
It would appear...

321
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,761
it would appear my young friend
and I might benefit

322
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:54,245
from a private conversation.

323
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:56,454
I’m not going anywhere.

324
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:58,801
I am...

325
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:00,320
You know, maybe on Monday,
the two of you

326
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,357
could find a few minutes
to come by my office.

327
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:04,186
We could sit down and then...

328
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:06,257
- I’m not going anywhere.
- My God, you are an infant.

329
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:09,053
- It’s not the issue.
- You’re psychotic.

330
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:12,953
Pathological.

331
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,439
I have indulged
your constant need for support

332
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:17,337
and encouragement
and reassurance

333
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:20,961
and fucking paternal engagement
for a year and a half now,

334
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,654
and I’m sick
to fucking death of it.

335
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,276
He left.

336
00:18:25,414 --> 00:18:27,347
I’m so sorry
Daddy walked out the door,

337
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:28,969
probably because
he didn’t love Mummy,

338
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,971
but maybe because
he became so hopelessly bored

339
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,835
with your needy,
constant demands

340
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:35,321
that he figured getting out
was better!

341
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:38,117
And that is a shitting tragedy,
but it happens.

342
00:18:38,255 --> 00:18:40,464
It happens, and you move on!

343
00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:42,362
That’s what
a healthy human being does.

344
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,400
You are a perversion of
what a man is supposed to be.

345
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:47,747
-Stop it.
- You are a diseased creature

346
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:49,852
who has spent
the last 20 years of her life

347
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,028
running in frantic circles,
trying to compensate

348
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,135
for a so-called tragedy
that is quite possibly

349
00:18:56,273 --> 00:18:58,206
the most boring story ever told,

350
00:18:58,344 --> 00:18:59,724
and I’ve had it with you.

351
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:01,968
I hate you.
I hate you so fucking much!

352
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:05,040
I have slept with no one but you

353
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,974
for the past year and a half,

354
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:11,874
you sweet fucking lunatic!

355
00:19:12,012 --> 00:19:13,876
No one!

356
00:19:14,014 --> 00:19:16,500
And, my God,
how I regret it now.

357
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:18,226
Get some help!

358
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:21,815
And stop spraying your sickness
on the rest of us,

359
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,853
on the loyal, faithful,
decent men

360
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:26,406
who have only tried to love you

361
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:30,514
as well and as truly
as they possibly could.

362
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:34,725
The Zetter Hotel in Clerkenwell.

363
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:39,868
I beg your pardon?

364
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:42,560
That’s the hotel you prefer.

365
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,150
Normally, Mondays and Thursdays,

366
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:49,188
easiest for you because
it’s the department meetings

367
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:51,086
and you can slip away.

368
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,710
Your lover pays with
a credit card in her own name.

369
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:59,888
I assume you split it in cash,
but that’s immaterial.

370
00:20:00,026 --> 00:20:01,717
As is her name.

371
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:06,550
The junior suite with city view
is your favorite.

372
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:11,175
I don’t like liars.

373
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:15,835
Fucking hell!
Wait, don’t move it.

374
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:17,250
Don’t move it.
Don’t fucking move it!

375
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:18,941
Okay, I got it.
I got it. I got it.

376
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,462
That is the most
boring thing you’ve ever done.

377
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:25,051
- Hands down.
- Stay still. Stay still.

378
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:26,777
Look at me. Look at me.

379
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:27,985
All right, I’ll swap you.

380
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:28,399
-Okay.
- Give me the arm.

381
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:35,993
I wonder if it’s possible
you went just a bit heavy

382
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:37,995
on the DZM 5.

383
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,100
I may well have.

384
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:44,795
Did you see
what you needed to see?

385
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,245
I don’t know yet.

386
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:49,834
That was the rock.
Now I watch the ripples.

387
00:20:54,322 --> 00:20:55,599
Leave the rest.

388
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:57,290
I will.

389
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:59,396
Just give me two minutes.

390
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:04,021
Leave it.

391
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,023
I will.

392
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,715
What does it do?

393
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:10,752
What does what do?

394
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,926
Severus.

395
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,722
I’m afraid
that’s in the black bag.

396
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:19,761
Want me to guess?

397
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:21,797
No.

398
00:21:21,935 --> 00:21:26,285
Dirty tricks, malware,
meant to disable a government.

399
00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:30,012
Why would you say that?

400
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,153
Hmm? Oh, Severus Alexander.

401
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,708
You know, the Roman emperor
whose, uh...

402
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:40,229
uh, assassination
led to 50 years of civil war.

403
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,129
If you like.

404
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:46,339
You know what I like. Hurry up.

405
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:50,723
George.

406
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:52,380
Sorry.

407
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:55,866
Come here.

408
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:06,255
If you were in a situation,
if you needed my help...

409
00:22:06,394 --> 00:22:08,465
I do need your help.

410
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:11,709
Scratch my back.

411
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,128
- Wouldn’t matter what it was...
- Please stop talking.

412
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:20,339
I would do anything for you.

413
00:22:20,477 --> 00:22:22,099
Would you?

414
00:22:22,237 --> 00:22:23,376
Yes.

415
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:25,274
Anything at all?

416
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:27,000
Yes.

417
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:30,659
Would you lie?

418
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,561
Yes. But never to you.

419
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:37,873
That’s sweet.

420
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:40,255
Would you lie to me?

421
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:42,568
Only if I had to.

422
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:48,367
- Would you kill for me, George?
- Yes.

423
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:49,920
- Would you?
- Yes.

424
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:05,349
I’m going to bed.

425
00:23:08,214 --> 00:23:10,250
What’s wrong?

426
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,942
Nothing.

427
00:23:17,706 --> 00:23:19,536
Maybe this weekend?

428
00:23:24,264 --> 00:23:26,163
Someplace nice.

429
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:31,030
Don’t stay up too late.

430
00:23:55,986 --> 00:23:57,574
The fuck?

431
00:24:24,635 --> 00:24:26,395
Wait, wait, wait.

432
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:29,468
Phil? Phil?

433
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,041
I thought maybe a movie
this week.

434
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:55,114
Uh, I’m out of the country
Wednesday, back Thursday.

435
00:24:55,252 --> 00:24:56,598
Maybe tomorrow, then.

436
00:24:56,736 --> 00:24:58,669
Sure.

437
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,293
Is anything playing?

438
00:25:02,431 --> 00:25:04,399
I hear <i>Dark Windows</i>is good.

439
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:06,539
<i>Dark Windows.</i>

440
00:25:06,677 --> 00:25:08,645
Don’t know that one.

441
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:12,200
Should we see it?

442
00:25:12,338 --> 00:25:13,581
Love to.

443
00:25:27,664 --> 00:25:30,114
Where are you off to
on Wednesday?

444
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:35,844
Black bag.

445
00:25:35,982 --> 00:25:36,983
Right.

446
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:04,908
George Woodhouse.

447
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:08,187
Forgot my badge.
Can I get a temporary?

448
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,296
Proper badge protocol
is essential, Mr. Woodhouse.

449
00:26:14,434 --> 00:26:16,022
Never happen again.

450
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:36,284
- Great party.
- Glad you could make it.

451
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:37,906
Fingers still work.

452
00:26:38,044 --> 00:26:39,736
Look, I know she’s crazy
as a fucking loon,

453
00:26:39,874 --> 00:26:41,461
but she makes me happy.

454
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,429
My whole life,
all I’ve done is do for people,

455
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:44,603
Susan and the kids.

456
00:26:44,741 --> 00:26:46,328
I get nothing but hate for it.

457
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:48,917
Clarissa expects
exactly nothing.

458
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:50,125
Okay.

459
00:26:50,263 --> 00:26:52,783
You’ve heard about Meacham?

460
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:54,613
He’s dead. Coronary.

461
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:56,097
- When?
- Last night.

462
00:26:56,235 --> 00:26:58,824
- I just saw him.
- People always say that.

463
00:26:58,962 --> 00:27:01,654
Little young for a
heart attack, don’t you think?

464
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,069
Yes.

465
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:05,831
Do you know
what he was working on?

466
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:07,280
No.

467
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,110
I need to see Kathryn.

468
00:27:09,248 --> 00:27:12,147
She’s got Stieglitz in there.
You might want to...

469
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:37,276
...all here, the task at hand,

470
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:40,348
to fully express
those needs and desire to you

471
00:27:40,486 --> 00:27:42,039
over the last month and a half.

472
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:44,766
But have I seen it? Do I...

473
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:54,017
Sorry to interrupt.

474
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:58,504
Why would your key be in my bag?

475
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:01,472
Found it on the closet floor
and thought it was yours.

476
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,682
They all look alike.

477
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:07,858
My bag’s by the desk.

478
00:28:07,996 --> 00:28:10,205
I need my key back by 1:00.

479
00:28:10,343 --> 00:28:12,207
Two minutes.

480
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:14,554
You okay?

481
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,488
I just heard about Meacham.

482
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:19,283
Terrible.

483
00:28:21,354 --> 00:28:22,390
Anything else?

484
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:24,288
No.

485
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:26,739
Grab yourself something on
the way home, if you don’t mind.

486
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:29,190
I might stop off at the lake.

487
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:29,457
Zurich?

488
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:37,637
47.3701 north,

489
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,951
8.5411 east.

490
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:53,792
Sorry. Running behind.

491
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,345
Mm-hmm.

492
00:29:58,175 --> 00:30:00,315
Can you go a few minutes late?

493
00:30:01,972 --> 00:30:05,182
If we don’t do 45,
I can’t clear the mandate.

494
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,117
Uh, I make that 2:06.

495
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,051
Fine.

496
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:30,967
Uh, sleep remains inconsistent.

497
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:36,973
I take two-point-five to
three milligrams of lorazepam,

498
00:30:37,111 --> 00:30:39,907
the first at 8:00,
the second at 11:00

499
00:30:40,045 --> 00:30:42,185
and the third in the night.

500
00:30:43,186 --> 00:30:44,704
After the first nightmare.

501
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,466
You’re still having them
every night?

502
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,400
Yes.

503
00:30:50,538 --> 00:30:53,230
Um... the herbal sleep aids

504
00:30:53,368 --> 00:30:56,406
leave me groggy,
so I-I discontinued,

505
00:30:56,544 --> 00:31:00,306
and zolpidem is at most
an every-other-day option.

506
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:03,792
More than point-five milligrams
two days in a row

507
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:07,037
produces unmotivated rage
the next morning.

508
00:31:08,521 --> 00:31:12,180
And three or more days
in a row...

509
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:16,875
...things get even uglier.

510
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:20,395
What?

511
00:31:22,742 --> 00:31:28,921
I just-- I-I think that’s
an extremely careful report.

512
00:31:30,578 --> 00:31:31,993
How so?

513
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:34,858
Uh, lorazepam
three milligrams or below,

514
00:31:34,996 --> 00:31:39,138
zolpidem below
20 milligrams per month,

515
00:31:39,276 --> 00:31:41,969
and the herbal, that’s...
that’s ashwagandha, right?

516
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:44,833
- Yes.
- Yeah. Yeah.

517
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:46,939
I think those amounts
and dosages

518
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:49,977
are just under
my reporting requirements.

519
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:51,910
And you know that.

520
00:31:52,048 --> 00:31:56,673
And you feel it’s duplicitous
for me to want to avoid

521
00:31:56,811 --> 00:32:00,642
involvement in psych services
reporting chains?

522
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,713
As I said,
I-I think it’s careful.

523
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:05,337
I’m the head of sig ops;
of course I’m careful.

524
00:32:05,475 --> 00:32:07,442
Well, that’s not the goal
in here.

525
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,929
The goal is
to satisfy the mandate

526
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:13,345
so I can get back to work.

527
00:32:18,315 --> 00:32:23,596
Why on earth are you sleeping
with Ramrod Jimmy Stokes?

528
00:32:24,632 --> 00:32:27,324
- He’s beneath you.
- Let’s keep this professional.

529
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:28,498
Professional?

530
00:32:28,636 --> 00:32:30,293
You came to my home.

531
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:32,398
You drank, you ate,
you talked about your sex life.

532
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:35,022
What in God’s name is
professional about that?

533
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,162
Maybe it was
an observational visit.

534
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,991
I’ve had it up to my eyeballs

535
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:42,063
being watched by
every single person around me.

536
00:32:43,478 --> 00:32:46,516
Oh, yes, by all means,
write that one down.

537
00:32:46,654 --> 00:32:48,311
Paranoid ideations.

538
00:32:48,449 --> 00:32:51,693
Buy me another mandatory
six months.

539
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,801
You know, I always know
when you’re arriving.

540
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:59,839
Because the aroma of hostility
wafts in ahead of you.

541
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,119
Oh, well, that’s the first
interesting thing you’ve said.

542
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:06,570
How are things with George?

543
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:13,163
The other day,
Arthur Stieglitz told me

544
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:19,583
that my devotion to my marriage
is my professional weakness.

545
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:23,242
That my feelings for George
are a gaping wound

546
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,487
through which
any idiot can attack me.

547
00:33:27,729 --> 00:33:33,356
He told me I want too much
and that I cannot have it all.

548
00:33:34,357 --> 00:33:36,290
I’m going to have his job.

549
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:38,740
You watch.

550
00:33:38,878 --> 00:33:40,673
Is he right?

551
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,572
If a situation presents itself,

552
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,332
would you choose your marriage
over everything else?

553
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,403
I value loyalty.

554
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:48,233
To what?

555
00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:53,376
You were raised Catholic,
weren’t you?

556
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,068
Hmm? Mm.

557
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:57,966
Never mind. You were.

558
00:33:58,105 --> 00:34:00,728
12 years at St. Anthony’s
in Blackpool.

559
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:05,215
Yeah. Did they tell you
you were a bad little girl?

560
00:34:05,353 --> 00:34:07,493
Oh, is that why
you like erotica?

561
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:09,426
Because it’s naughty.
It’s against the rules.

562
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:12,222
Says everything you can’t.

563
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,881
Yeah. Oh, I bet you go
for dirty talk, too.

564
00:34:19,436 --> 00:34:22,267
I’ll report
you completed the session.

565
00:34:22,405 --> 00:34:23,923
- You can go.
- Why?

566
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,684
This is just getting good.

567
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:29,895
Zoe Vaughan, nice Catholic girl
from the North,

568
00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:31,690
just wants to help people,

569
00:34:31,828 --> 00:34:34,382
wants to talk about
their problems.

570
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,764
Come on. Why us?

571
00:34:36,902 --> 00:34:38,904
I’m curious about people.

572
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:41,458
And right now,
I’m curious about you.

573
00:34:49,432 --> 00:34:50,916
Zolpidem.

574
00:34:51,813 --> 00:34:54,437
After three days, you said
"things get even uglier."

575
00:34:56,749 --> 00:34:58,786
- I get moods.
- What kind of moods?

576
00:34:58,924 --> 00:35:01,340
- Dark.
- Suicidal?

577
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,792
No.

578
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:08,727
Panicked.

579
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:10,763
Over money still?

580
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,765
Despite all evidence
to the contrary?

581
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,216
Well, I’ll not end up
like my mother.

582
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,980
That’s the first interesting
thing you’ve said.

583
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:33,398
If Severus is deployed
as intended,

584
00:36:33,536 --> 00:36:36,711
thousands of innocent people
will die.

585
00:36:50,484 --> 00:36:52,555
When are you gonna
poly me, George?

586
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:28,176
Shit.

587
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,065
Sorry.

588
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:57,275
I know I’m intruding.

589
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,313
A situation’s come up
that I think falls

590
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:04,627
outside our usual
reporting parameters.

591
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,046
If you prefer,
we could use a SCIF.

592
00:38:10,184 --> 00:38:11,358
Go on.

593
00:38:11,496 --> 00:38:14,430
- It’s awkward.
- Preamble noted.

594
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:19,331
Our financial people have been
working with HMRC,

595
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:23,059
running a sweep of banks
in tax haven countries.

596
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:25,199
They routinely run
ID scrapes past us

597
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:27,166
for non-insignificant balances,

598
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,376
in case one of
our persona IDs is used

599
00:38:29,514 --> 00:38:31,205
to open an offshore account.

600
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:33,345
Never once has been.

601
00:38:33,483 --> 00:38:35,899
This time, they got a hit.

602
00:38:36,037 --> 00:38:37,384
What’s the fake name?

603
00:38:37,522 --> 00:38:39,282
"Margaret Langford."

604
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,009
DOB and name match
an SIS-generated passport

605
00:38:42,147 --> 00:38:43,493
from 2008.

606
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:46,220
- Who registered it?
- Scrubbed in ’09.

607
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,362
Search old case files
for the name and date of birth.

608
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,159
Also scrubbed.
She’s a nonentity post-2009.

609
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:57,542
- Thumbprint?
- None required.

610
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,199
It was just before Phase II.

611
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,098
What bank holds the account?

612
00:39:02,236 --> 00:39:04,411
Asia Trust & Capital.

613
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:07,345
Obscure choice.
It’s what I would’ve picked.

614
00:39:09,105 --> 00:39:12,108
Facial rec on surveillance cams
outside the bank

615
00:39:12,246 --> 00:39:13,937
the day the account was opened.

616
00:39:14,075 --> 00:39:17,389
That was eight months ago,
and Myanmar’s non-co-op.

617
00:39:17,527 --> 00:39:20,254
Sometimes if you know
who to ask...

618
00:39:21,842 --> 00:39:24,845
If it’s Myanmar, how do we know
about the account at all?

619
00:39:24,983 --> 00:39:26,778
Well, somebody got jumpy
and transferred the money

620
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:29,781
out of there when it looked
like there’d be another coup.

621
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:32,162
We got a hit on the
incoming SWIFT at the new bank.

622
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,269
- Where?
- Raffenkalt/Suisse AG.

623
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:36,443
Zurich.

624
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,618
Zurich?

625
00:39:39,756 --> 00:39:41,724
That mean something?

626
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:46,176
How much is in the account?

627
00:39:46,314 --> 00:39:47,902
Seven million.

628
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,594
Pounds.

629
00:39:52,942 --> 00:39:55,772
So one of our people stole
a straw man identity

630
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:58,844
and has been paid
seven million pounds under it.

631
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:01,606
Yes.

632
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:06,818
What?

633
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:10,822
"Margaret Langford" was used
a handful of times

634
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,515
by a SIGINT op in 2008
before discontinuance.

635
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:16,275
Used by whom?

636
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,967
Your wife.

637
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:21,419
I see.

638
00:40:22,558 --> 00:40:24,145
I see.

639
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:26,354
As I said, I thought this was

640
00:40:26,493 --> 00:40:29,634
outside our normal
reporting parameters.

641
00:40:29,772 --> 00:40:31,981
- Who else knows?
- No one.

642
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:35,294
Leave it with me, please.

643
00:40:38,953 --> 00:40:39,989
James.

644
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:44,096
Was the money deposited
in increments or lump sum?

645
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:45,650
Lump sum.

646
00:40:45,788 --> 00:40:48,480
Someone sold something
extremely valuable.

647
00:40:48,618 --> 00:40:49,999
Alice?

648
00:40:51,794 --> 00:40:54,003
Alice, are you here?

649
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,696
Alice?

650
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:00,561
Richard, what are you doing?!

651
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:02,149
What? I just opened the door.

652
00:41:02,287 --> 00:41:04,013
- Where’s Monica?
- She’s gone to get help.

653
00:41:07,948 --> 00:41:09,363
You should’ve heard yourself.

654
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:12,331
I hate birds.
Give me the torch.

655
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,678
I like the torch.

656
00:41:13,816 --> 00:41:15,576
Use your phone.

657
00:41:19,856 --> 00:41:21,030
Trout?

658
00:41:21,168 --> 00:41:23,342
- Vendace.
- Oh.

659
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,519
- Been saving it.
- Delicious.

660
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:31,040
Is it a difficult catch?

661
00:41:31,178 --> 00:41:33,214
Next to impossible.

662
00:41:37,702 --> 00:41:39,082
When will you be back?

663
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,878
Oh, tomorrow, late.

664
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:43,742
Don’t wait up.

665
00:41:46,193 --> 00:41:47,712
I hate the distance.

666
00:41:48,747 --> 00:41:51,060
Well, we’re pretty good at it.

667
00:41:51,198 --> 00:41:53,821
It seems grotesque.

668
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:56,479
What’s asked of a person.

669
00:41:57,998 --> 00:41:59,689
Oh, shit.

670
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:07,559
Bon voyage.

671
00:42:09,043 --> 00:42:10,424
Or <i>Gute Reise.</i>

672
00:42:18,743 --> 00:42:20,572
Love you.

673
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:38,279
♪ To love, to love, to love ♪

674
00:42:46,253 --> 00:42:47,634
Shit.

675
00:42:48,945 --> 00:42:52,190
♪ Oh, how lucky we are... ♪

676
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,754
What the fuck, George?!

677
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:15,454
Am I in trouble?

678
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,422
Not at all.

679
00:43:19,286 --> 00:43:21,391
So what’s up, man?

680
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:26,776
I understand, uh, you and
Freddie are still together.

681
00:43:26,914 --> 00:43:29,089
Yeah.

682
00:43:29,227 --> 00:43:31,332
Isn’t that a bit awkward?

683
00:43:32,471 --> 00:43:36,165
Because I pinned his hand
to the table with a steak knife?

684
00:43:36,303 --> 00:43:38,719
That comes to mind.

685
00:43:38,857 --> 00:43:41,170
He forgave me. I forgave him.

686
00:43:41,308 --> 00:43:45,001
You know? The hand thing
kind of evened us out.

687
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:46,693
Okay.

688
00:43:50,835 --> 00:43:54,010
George, you come to
my apartment at 11:00 at night

689
00:43:54,148 --> 00:43:57,151
asking about my relationship.

690
00:43:58,325 --> 00:44:02,329
I’m not shocked, and I’m not
even sure I’m saying no,

691
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:06,264
but are you actually doing this?

692
00:44:08,128 --> 00:44:10,233
Uh, no.

693
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:12,719
Then what do you want?

694
00:44:16,964 --> 00:44:21,348
You have MOD imagery oversight
in Building 321

695
00:44:21,486 --> 00:44:23,557
on one of the 64 eyes.

696
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:27,147
For a minute there,
I thought you were human.

697
00:44:27,285 --> 00:44:31,185
I need a brief Keyhole redirect
tomorrow morning,

698
00:44:31,323 --> 00:44:34,637
and it needs to be
un-logged and unrecorded.

699
00:44:35,811 --> 00:44:37,364
I don’t even think
that’s possible.

700
00:44:37,502 --> 00:44:38,537
It is.

701
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:42,265
There are brief periods
between satlink handovers

702
00:44:42,403 --> 00:44:44,716
where a satellite could be used
for another purpose

703
00:44:44,854 --> 00:44:46,407
without detection.

704
00:44:46,545 --> 00:44:48,789
I’ve done it, in Ratcliffe.

705
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:52,413
But this one
has to be unofficial.

706
00:44:54,415 --> 00:44:56,901
Why would I do
something like that?

707
00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:59,800
I would consider myself
in your debt.

708
00:45:00,974 --> 00:45:03,701
What does that get me?

709
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,599
Privacy.

710
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,604
I have personally never found

711
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:13,089
ecstasy use to be
a compromising factor.

712
00:45:13,227 --> 00:45:16,092
But combined with
multiple sexual partners...

713
00:45:17,645 --> 00:45:19,751
...it would be of issue,
to Freddie.

714
00:45:21,063 --> 00:45:24,480
His infidelity is one thing,
but yours...

715
00:45:25,964 --> 00:45:28,208
Freddie’s old-fashioned.

716
00:45:30,589 --> 00:45:33,523
- You’re a bastard.
- It’s important.

717
00:45:36,043 --> 00:45:37,424
What if I love him?

718
00:45:37,562 --> 00:45:40,220
Then you’ll help me.

719
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:42,981
But does that matter to you?

720
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,431
You know, the human part.

721
00:45:44,569 --> 00:45:47,814
Does that-- do you care
about that?

722
00:45:47,952 --> 00:45:50,402
Who am I supposed to be with?

723
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,508
Tell me.

724
00:45:53,336 --> 00:45:55,442
Sorry, uh, it seemed rhetorical.

725
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,789
I can’t date outside.

726
00:45:57,927 --> 00:45:59,791
They don’t understand.

727
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:02,552
And I can’t date inside
because we’re all fucking liars.

728
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:03,933
You know, professional ones

729
00:46:04,071 --> 00:46:06,108
with a perfect excuse
every time.

730
00:46:06,246 --> 00:46:07,626
"Well, where were you
last week?"

731
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,421
"Black bag."

732
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:11,907
"What did you do on Friday?"
"Black bag."

733
00:46:12,045 --> 00:46:13,494
When you can lie
about everything,

734
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:15,013
when you can deny everything,

735
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:17,705
how do you tell the truth
about anything?

736
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:21,192
How does that work?

737
00:46:22,365 --> 00:46:24,954
How can that possibly work?

738
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,888
I don’t know.

739
00:46:28,026 --> 00:46:30,235
But you do know.

740
00:46:31,236 --> 00:46:33,860
You do know
because it works for you.

741
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,690
And you’re the perfect
fucking couple,

742
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:39,279
and everyone knows it,
so tell me.

743
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:41,833
Tell me how it works.

744
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,664
6:30 a.m. tomorrow.

745
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,667
A few minutes early to be safe.

746
00:46:50,635 --> 00:46:52,982
Is there a secure view site?

747
00:46:56,537 --> 00:46:59,713
There’s a lookdown SCIF
off the main 64.

748
00:47:01,646 --> 00:47:02,681
Good.

749
00:47:03,993 --> 00:47:05,684
Thank you for the wine.

750
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,342
You didn’t have to come at me
like that, you know.

751
00:47:09,274 --> 00:47:11,863
I would’ve done it
for you anyway.

752
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:20,759
Ready for some treason?

753
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,313
That isn’t funny.

754
00:48:22,451 --> 00:48:23,624
Sure it is.

755
00:48:23,762 --> 00:48:24,936
Where are we looking?

756
00:48:25,074 --> 00:48:28,457
47.3701 north,

757
00:48:28,595 --> 00:48:31,391
8.5411 east.

758
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,671
Okay. There’s only
one good option there.

759
00:48:35,809 --> 00:48:39,399
Very masculine Milstar
satellite up at 938 miles.

760
00:48:39,537 --> 00:48:41,642
Ops arc isn’t used much.
It’s over Liechtenstein.

761
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,611
It’s that one. Second row down,
third from the right.

762
00:48:45,784 --> 00:48:47,269
<i>About to hand off</i>
<i>to a Gaofen-4.</i>

763
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:48,753
<i>How long will we have?</i>

764
00:48:48,891 --> 00:48:50,617
<i>Three minutes, 20 seconds.</i>

765
00:48:50,755 --> 00:48:52,515
Does he miss anything?

766
00:48:52,653 --> 00:48:55,277
The major? Never once.

767
00:48:55,415 --> 00:48:57,451
Ready?

768
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,145
- Wait.
- George.

769
00:49:02,353 --> 00:49:05,390
No, George, I’m naked out here.
Are we doing this or not?

770
00:49:05,528 --> 00:49:06,564
Go.

771
00:49:07,634 --> 00:49:08,946
Handoff.

772
00:49:14,813 --> 00:49:16,677
Zurich?
What the hell’s in Zurich?

773
00:49:16,815 --> 00:49:18,472
Move in.

774
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:24,030
Closer. Same coordinates.

775
00:49:26,825 --> 00:49:28,517
Closer.

776
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:35,489
Nice bench. Are we done?

777
00:49:35,627 --> 00:49:37,181
Wait.

778
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:39,355
They’re late.

779
00:50:04,656 --> 00:50:08,074
You are one naughty husband,
George.

780
00:50:08,212 --> 00:50:10,041
You asked how it works.

781
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:11,629
To be with someone
in this business.

782
00:50:11,767 --> 00:50:13,562
This is how.

783
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,702
You each know what you know,
and you know what you’ll do,

784
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,187
and you never discuss
certain things again.

785
00:50:18,325 --> 00:50:22,053
I watch her.
I assume she watches me.

786
00:50:22,191 --> 00:50:24,952
If she’s in trouble,
even of her own making,

787
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:29,543
I will do everything
in my power to extricate her.

788
00:50:30,544 --> 00:50:32,236
No matter what that means.

789
00:50:32,374 --> 00:50:34,238
You understand?

790
00:50:35,618 --> 00:50:37,793
My God, that’s so hot.

791
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:40,830
That’s how it works.

792
00:50:40,968 --> 00:50:42,936
It’s the only way.

793
00:50:47,216 --> 00:50:49,011
Can you get any closer?

794
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:55,121
Facial rec?

795
00:50:59,263 --> 00:51:00,505
Nothing?

796
00:51:00,643 --> 00:51:01,782
Give it a minute.

797
00:51:10,205 --> 00:51:11,344
Kulikov.

798
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,313
- One minute.
- Hang on.

799
00:51:15,451 --> 00:51:17,384
Trying something.

800
00:51:20,456 --> 00:51:21,802
It’s a lipreading AI.

801
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,563
Still in beta.

802
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,360
Audio coming.

803
00:51:27,498 --> 00:51:29,500
The money’s in place.

804
00:51:29,638 --> 00:51:31,916
Do your fucking job,
and I’ll release.

805
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,678
She isn’t selling.
She’s buying.

806
00:51:35,816 --> 00:51:38,164
It’s a complicated situation.

807
00:51:38,302 --> 00:51:39,613
14 seconds.

808
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:40,442
You need to think
about it.

809
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:43,824
- Get them back.
- Yeah, trying.

810
00:51:43,962 --> 00:51:45,654
- I’ve got to let them go.
- Get them back!

811
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:48,139
I’ve got to let them go!

812
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:50,762
- Shit.
- What?

813
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,281
It’s not responding.

814
00:51:52,419 --> 00:51:53,834
- Get rid of it.
- I don’t know what--

815
00:51:53,972 --> 00:51:55,664
I’m trying. I--

816
00:51:55,802 --> 00:51:57,114
Why the--

817
00:51:57,252 --> 00:51:58,977
Shit!

818
00:52:09,091 --> 00:52:10,230
<i>Did he see?</i>

819
00:52:10,368 --> 00:52:11,818
I don’t know. Did you record?

820
00:52:11,956 --> 00:52:13,302
It’s automatic.

821
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,097
Go into the root files
and delete.

822
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:16,685
Keystroke logs, too.

823
00:52:16,823 --> 00:52:18,376
Yeah, well, I hope
you got what you wanted.

824
00:52:18,514 --> 00:52:21,103
If I’m going down,
you’re coming with me.

825
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:23,347
I’ll keep that in mind.

826
00:52:32,045 --> 00:52:34,668
I don’t understand.

827
00:52:36,532 --> 00:52:38,396
Which part?

828
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:40,364
All of it.

829
00:52:40,502 --> 00:52:41,882
James, come on. How old are you?

830
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,021
Come over here.

831
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,196
What?

832
00:52:45,334 --> 00:52:47,025
Come over here.

833
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,579
It’s not that kind of visit.

834
00:52:48,717 --> 00:52:50,546
What kind of visit is it, then?

835
00:52:50,684 --> 00:52:53,308
The kind where I say we’re not
seeing each other anymore.

836
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:57,519
And why not again?

837
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:02,869
Because I don’t want to.

838
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:06,631
What about the times we had
our little sessions, over there?

839
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:09,116
- You wanted to then.
- Yeah.

840
00:53:09,255 --> 00:53:11,118
And now I don’t.

841
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:13,914
You see, this isn’t normal.

842
00:53:14,052 --> 00:53:16,020
The way you’re doing this,
just so you know.

843
00:53:16,158 --> 00:53:18,091
And what we did in here...

844
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:19,541
None of this is normal.

845
00:53:20,956 --> 00:53:22,716
No, it isn’t.

846
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:26,720
You’re as sick as your patients.

847
00:53:26,858 --> 00:53:28,446
Possibly.

848
00:53:28,584 --> 00:53:30,207
But there’s no law that says

849
00:53:30,345 --> 00:53:31,794
that therapists can’t have
issues of their own.

850
00:53:31,932 --> 00:53:33,520
- Are you seeing someone else?
- Yes.

851
00:53:34,521 --> 00:53:36,903
Fuck me, you’re cold.

852
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:38,939
Yeah, a bit.

853
00:53:39,077 --> 00:53:41,735
Yeah, you’re even cold about
whether or not you’re cold.

854
00:53:49,743 --> 00:53:53,126
I’m gonna clear your mandate
permanently.

855
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:55,473
I’ll tell psych services
to recommend a psychiatrist

856
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:57,648
for any prescriptive issues
you might have in the future.

857
00:53:57,786 --> 00:53:59,926
I told you things.

858
00:54:00,892 --> 00:54:04,275
All your thoughts and feelings
are confidential.

859
00:54:04,413 --> 00:54:06,001
Our relationship can just...

860
00:54:06,139 --> 00:54:07,796
Yeah, I don’t give a shit
about the relationship.

861
00:54:07,934 --> 00:54:10,005
I’m over it. I got something
else on the side, too.

862
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:14,768
I told you operational things.

863
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:18,565
Are you referring to Severus?

864
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:22,604
I was drunk as hell.

865
00:54:22,742 --> 00:54:26,297
Anything you told me regarding
Severus is also privileged.

866
00:54:28,195 --> 00:54:29,783
That’s great.

867
00:54:30,819 --> 00:54:33,442
’Cause it’d be a real drag
to have to kill you.

868
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:36,618
I’ve never appreciated
that sort of humor.

869
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:38,551
Yeah, and I never liked that
about you either.

870
00:54:38,689 --> 00:54:41,001
You know what you could use
in here?

871
00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:45,523
A velvet Jesus
with eyes that follow you.

872
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:47,974
You’d like that, wouldn’t you?

873
00:54:48,112 --> 00:54:49,976
It’s duty desk.

874
00:54:50,114 --> 00:54:51,357
Go ahead.

875
00:54:51,495 --> 00:54:53,738
Thanks, Mom.

876
00:54:53,876 --> 00:54:55,257
Yes?

877
00:54:56,776 --> 00:54:58,156
When?

878
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:00,435
How long?

879
00:55:01,263 --> 00:55:03,127
I’ll be right there.

880
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:07,787
I got to go.

881
00:55:08,822 --> 00:55:10,583
I left some things
at your place.

882
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:14,241
They’re in a pouch at the desk
under your name.

883
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:17,452
I left it there this morning.

884
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,525
This is the best breakup
I ever had.

885
00:55:21,663 --> 00:55:23,941
Seriously, I enjoyed myself.

886
00:55:24,804 --> 00:55:26,530
Take care, Zoe.

887
00:55:26,668 --> 00:55:29,153
You’re a fucking piece of work.

888
00:55:39,715 --> 00:55:41,372
The major called.

889
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:42,994
We’ve got a breach.

890
00:55:44,755 --> 00:55:47,654
It’s me. Don’t be a dick.
Come on.

891
00:55:50,485 --> 00:55:53,004
Jesus.

892
00:56:00,736 --> 00:56:02,255
You’ll want to know about this.

893
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,371
Oh, no, no, no.

894
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:47,473
All right.

895
00:56:47,611 --> 00:56:49,613
Let’s get started.

896
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:51,925
Ms. Childs, would you please?

897
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:54,825
Okay, so this is
Vadim Pavlichuk,

898
00:56:54,963 --> 00:56:57,137
the dissident Russian general
under house arrest

899
00:56:57,275 --> 00:56:59,795
in Liechtenstein
for the past six months.

900
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:01,970
Pavlichuk’s been known to be
working with a network

901
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:05,560
of exiled militarists for the
overthrow of the Russian regime

902
00:57:05,698 --> 00:57:07,769
due to its mismanagement
of the war.

903
00:57:07,907 --> 00:57:10,530
We’ve had the house on lockdown
for 24 hours since he arrived.

904
00:57:10,668 --> 00:57:13,291
If Pavlichuk made a move,
we wanted to know first.

905
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,501
He has now made a move.

906
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:17,123
These are the heat signatures

907
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:20,367
in the house at 6:31 a.m.
Central European Time.

908
00:57:20,506 --> 00:57:22,197
Seven unique sigs.

909
00:57:22,335 --> 00:57:23,716
We then lost signal
with the house

910
00:57:23,854 --> 00:57:27,202
during a routine
satlink handover for about...

911
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,962
- Three minutes, 20 seconds.
- Thank you.

912
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,792
Three minutes, 20 seconds.

913
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:34,243
When we regained signal
and ran thermals again at 6:35,

914
00:57:34,381 --> 00:57:36,522
this is what we see.

915
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,109
There are now only five.

916
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:39,732
For the last two hours,

917
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:42,010
we’ve been accounting for
all the individual sigs.

918
00:57:42,148 --> 00:57:44,357
We got all five
as they came and went.

919
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:46,635
None of them were Pavlichuk.

920
00:57:46,773 --> 00:57:48,741
So the son of a bitch
is out, hmm?

921
00:57:48,879 --> 00:57:50,674
How could that happen?

922
00:57:50,812 --> 00:57:52,572
How would he know the exact
timing of a satlink handover?

923
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:55,023
Well, fucking exactly.

924
00:57:55,161 --> 00:57:58,302
How could he know
unless someone here told him?

925
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:03,031
We look away, he takes off.

926
00:58:03,169 --> 00:58:05,343
It was an operation.

927
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,035
Very precise.

928
00:58:07,173 --> 00:58:08,450
Hmm?

929
00:58:08,588 --> 00:58:11,211
There is a stranger
in our house.

930
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:16,182
Have we picked up
Pavlichuk since he left?

931
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,701
He’s good.

932
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:20,566
He’s hunched over
in a black van somewhere,

933
00:58:20,704 --> 00:58:22,878
off to malefact.

934
00:58:23,016 --> 00:58:24,639
Uh, well, our assumption is

935
00:58:24,777 --> 00:58:28,090
that his right-hand former
lieutenant Andrei Kulikov

936
00:58:28,228 --> 00:58:30,576
is en route to pick him up now.

937
00:58:30,714 --> 00:58:32,370
Their intentions are unclear.

938
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,165
Kulikov had a meeting with
an unknown party in Zurich

939
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:37,237
this morning, so we’re waiting
on visuals for that.

940
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:39,343
Mm-hmm. Keep at it.

941
00:58:39,481 --> 00:58:41,241
Should we...

942
00:58:41,379 --> 00:58:43,209
Should we notify CIA?

943
00:58:43,347 --> 00:58:44,900
Oh, fuck them.

944
00:58:45,038 --> 00:58:47,903
I’m sick of being treated
like an ATM for intel.

945
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:50,906
And I’m certainly not
showing them our dirty linens.

946
00:58:51,044 --> 00:58:52,425
If there’s a traitor
in the house,

947
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:54,910
I want to know who it is
before they do.

948
00:58:55,048 --> 00:58:57,534
This stays in the room.

949
00:59:04,817 --> 00:59:06,750
You said the major was, uh...

950
00:59:06,888 --> 00:59:08,372
...aware of the redirect?

951
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:10,754
Yes. I got a signal alert
and called him.

952
00:59:10,892 --> 00:59:13,170
- He already knew.
- Hmm.

953
00:59:13,308 --> 00:59:16,691
Have him reassigned--
somewhere lovely, the Bahamas.

954
00:59:16,829 --> 00:59:20,971
Tell him it’s a promotion,
effective immediately.

955
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:23,180
He travels tomorrow.

956
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:25,803
Can I ask, strategically,

957
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:28,150
why do we care
that Pavlichuk is out?

958
00:59:32,534 --> 00:59:36,296
S-6 and below, please clear.

959
00:59:53,935 --> 00:59:55,592
Severus.

960
00:59:57,663 --> 01:00:00,424
We believe Pavlichuk has been
given a physical copy.

961
01:00:00,562 --> 01:00:02,184
That’s why we watched him.

962
01:00:02,322 --> 01:00:06,223
If Kulikov manages to get him
back into Moscow with it,

963
01:00:06,361 --> 01:00:07,638
well...

964
01:00:07,776 --> 01:00:11,262
Mr. Smalls,
educate our colleagues.

965
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,575
Severus is a Stuxnet polymorph

966
01:00:13,713 --> 01:00:14,956
we developed with NSA.

967
01:00:15,094 --> 01:00:16,785
It has to be
physically introduced

968
01:00:16,923 --> 01:00:19,685
to a nuclear reactor
to get past an air gap.

969
01:00:19,823 --> 01:00:24,482
But once it’s in, it can target
and melt down the reactor core.

970
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,829
It was a CYBERCOM op.

971
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:28,245
Why the fuck would we make that?

972
01:00:28,383 --> 01:00:30,178
Theoreticals. Capabilities.

973
01:00:30,316 --> 01:00:31,869
It shouldn’t have left
the building.

974
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:33,802
And we realized,
if we can do it to them,

975
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:36,667
- once the thing is out there...
- They can do it to us.

976
01:00:36,805 --> 01:00:39,325
It was a good idea.

977
01:00:39,463 --> 01:00:40,706
Hmm?

978
01:00:40,844 --> 01:00:43,881
A meltdown would cause
political havoc.

979
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:46,712
For an enemy involved
in an endless war

980
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:48,403
and a teetering government,

981
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:51,233
they’d run dear leader
out of Moscow on a rail.

982
01:00:51,371 --> 01:00:54,029
We’d be rid of the prick
once and for all.

983
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:56,342
We didn’t do it...

984
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,380
...but it was a damn good idea.

985
01:01:00,518 --> 01:01:02,866
It would appear
someone here felt the same way.

986
01:01:03,004 --> 01:01:05,592
Mm-hmm. And redirected the eye

987
01:01:05,731 --> 01:01:09,735
so Pavlichuk could escape
with the drive.

988
01:01:09,873 --> 01:01:12,634
He’s on his way to Russia now
to initiate a meltdown,

989
01:01:12,772 --> 01:01:15,672
and it’ll be our goddamn fault!

990
01:01:17,777 --> 01:01:19,814
Find the leak.

991
01:01:20,918 --> 01:01:22,886
Methods won’t be questioned.

992
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:10,243
This can’t be good.

993
01:02:10,381 --> 01:02:11,589
It isn’t.

994
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,868
George ordered the redirect.

995
01:02:14,006 --> 01:02:16,249
I helped him do it.

996
01:02:50,594 --> 01:02:52,320
Thanks.

997
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,704
Kathryn.

998
01:02:57,843 --> 01:02:59,361
Jesus, Freddie.

999
01:02:59,499 --> 01:03:01,329
Got a minute?

1000
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:03,814
Does anyone else know?

1001
01:03:03,952 --> 01:03:05,816
No.

1002
01:03:05,954 --> 01:03:08,163
- Can you trust Clarissa?
- Not particularly.

1003
01:03:08,301 --> 01:03:10,510
- To keep it to herself, I mean.
- I think so.

1004
01:03:10,648 --> 01:03:12,512
She’s fond of George.
She’s concerned.

1005
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:15,343
Whatever operation he’s running,
he’s in a very leaky boat.

1006
01:03:15,481 --> 01:03:18,173
If Pavlichuk gets back
to Russia, it’s on him.

1007
01:03:18,311 --> 01:03:19,968
He’d get 35 years.

1008
01:03:20,106 --> 01:03:22,488
Is there anything you can do?

1009
01:03:25,629 --> 01:03:27,493
How was Zurich?

1010
01:03:28,356 --> 01:03:30,841
It was pointless.
He had nothing.

1011
01:03:30,979 --> 01:03:32,878
I don’t know why I was there.

1012
01:03:33,016 --> 01:03:35,846
I spent the rest of the day
chasing down Gunther at FIS,

1013
01:03:35,984 --> 01:03:38,366
but he was useless.

1014
01:03:38,504 --> 01:03:41,472
Do you have any idea why
George would be watching you?

1015
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,820
None whatsoever.

1016
01:03:47,858 --> 01:03:49,239
All right.

1017
01:03:49,377 --> 01:03:51,551
You be ready in the morning.

1018
01:03:51,689 --> 01:03:53,346
I need a night to think.

1019
01:03:53,484 --> 01:03:54,761
Okay.

1020
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,040
Just you and me.

1021
01:03:57,178 --> 01:03:58,248
Yes?

1022
01:03:58,386 --> 01:04:00,146
Of course.

1023
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:39,876
I believe I’ve been set up.

1024
01:04:42,395 --> 01:04:44,777
I think I have been, too.

1025
01:04:46,054 --> 01:04:48,919
By Freddie, of all people.

1026
01:04:49,816 --> 01:04:51,404
Why?

1027
01:04:53,441 --> 01:04:55,615
Well, he’s playing me.

1028
01:04:55,753 --> 01:04:58,549
He thinks I’ll take action
to protect you.

1029
01:05:01,035 --> 01:05:02,760
And he’s right.

1030
01:05:04,624 --> 01:05:07,041
I will kill for you, George.

1031
01:05:08,974 --> 01:05:10,389
You know that.

1032
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:17,637
Freddie stole Severus.

1033
01:05:17,775 --> 01:05:19,916
Ah, maybe, maybe not.

1034
01:05:20,054 --> 01:05:22,608
It’s not really about that
anymore, is it?

1035
01:05:22,746 --> 01:05:24,610
Somehow it’s...

1036
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:28,614
...it’s about us.

1037
01:05:30,443 --> 01:05:32,825
There’s a plan.

1038
01:05:32,963 --> 01:05:35,207
And a counterplan.

1039
01:05:35,345 --> 01:05:39,763
One is using you to get to me,
the other, me to get to you.

1040
01:05:43,146 --> 01:05:45,976
Well, what are we going to do
about that?

1041
01:05:47,253 --> 01:05:49,014
Disrupt.

1042
01:05:49,152 --> 01:05:50,808
All of it.

1043
01:05:52,465 --> 01:05:55,330
Bait someone into
an overreaction.

1044
01:05:58,023 --> 01:06:00,611
Will there be another mess
to clean up?

1045
01:06:02,544 --> 01:06:04,857
Only if we do it right.

1046
01:06:52,732 --> 01:06:55,735
Wish you’d called sooner.
I didn’t really have any gear.

1047
01:06:55,873 --> 01:06:57,806
Hop in.

1048
01:06:59,463 --> 01:07:01,224
Fishing’s not really my thing.

1049
01:07:01,362 --> 01:07:03,571
Patience. All you need.

1050
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:11,889
We’ll be back in plenty of time.

1051
01:07:13,236 --> 01:07:15,445
It’s easier to think out here.

1052
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,220
I need something.

1053
01:07:33,946 --> 01:07:36,673
Geofencing on Andrei Kulikov.
Last known is Zurich.

1054
01:07:36,811 --> 01:07:38,606
I want a moving trace
on his cell,

1055
01:07:38,744 --> 01:07:41,436
and I want it to be un-logged.

1056
01:07:41,574 --> 01:07:44,232
I’m not going to prison
for you psychos.

1057
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:46,510
Oh, you’re too far in
to worry about that now,

1058
01:07:46,648 --> 01:07:48,167
don’t you think?

1059
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,520
Fucking made for each other.

1060
01:07:58,281 --> 01:08:00,559
I’d like to set up
a series of polygraphs.

1061
01:08:00,697 --> 01:08:01,939
Today.

1062
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,252
The usual room at Vauxhall.

1063
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:06,979
Who did you have in mind?

1064
01:08:07,117 --> 01:08:08,843
Freddie Smalls.

1065
01:08:08,981 --> 01:08:10,672
Clarissa Dubose.

1066
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:13,503
Dr. Zoe Vaughan.

1067
01:08:13,641 --> 01:08:15,367
Why her?

1068
01:08:15,505 --> 01:08:18,128
Freddie saw her twice a week
for the past eight months.

1069
01:08:18,266 --> 01:08:19,923
Leakage.

1070
01:08:21,027 --> 01:08:22,512
And I’ve seen her, too.

1071
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:25,308
I know.
Put yourself down as well.

1072
01:08:26,378 --> 01:08:28,380
Transparency.

1073
01:08:31,728 --> 01:08:33,143
Anyone else?

1074
01:08:33,281 --> 01:08:35,283
Not for the moment.

1075
01:08:37,768 --> 01:08:41,013
So, that Swiss banking issue.

1076
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:43,395
I’d been meaning
to follow up with you.

1077
01:08:43,533 --> 01:08:44,879
Of course one’s mind

1078
01:08:45,017 --> 01:08:47,847
goes to a possible
Severus connection.

1079
01:08:47,985 --> 01:08:49,366
That had occurred to me.

1080
01:08:49,504 --> 01:08:51,334
Had it?

1081
01:08:52,335 --> 01:08:54,716
It would appear to be linked.

1082
01:08:55,821 --> 01:08:58,686
Have you shared your suspicions
with anyone else?

1083
01:09:02,793 --> 01:09:04,450
Of course not.

1084
01:09:06,176 --> 01:09:08,178
But you still feel certain
of the identity

1085
01:09:08,316 --> 01:09:11,285
of the person who opened
the offshore account?

1086
01:09:11,423 --> 01:09:13,149
No.

1087
01:09:13,287 --> 01:09:15,047
No, that’s the thing.

1088
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:17,670
That’s why I’d been meaning
to follow up with you.

1089
01:09:17,808 --> 01:09:19,362
Oh.

1090
01:09:21,018 --> 01:09:22,399
"Margaret Langford."

1091
01:09:22,537 --> 01:09:24,470
The passport name
that Kathryn used in ’08.

1092
01:09:24,608 --> 01:09:26,092
Turns out there was
some sort of glitch.

1093
01:09:26,231 --> 01:09:28,060
It was repeatedly recycled
by the system,

1094
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:29,544
passed around SIS for a decade.

1095
01:09:29,682 --> 01:09:31,132
There’s at least a dozen uses.

1096
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:33,376
40 or 50 border records.

1097
01:09:34,377 --> 01:09:36,033
Seems odd you’d miss that.

1098
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,276
Yes.

1099
01:09:37,414 --> 01:09:40,072
Yeah, I’m kicking myself.

1100
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,246
It was sloppy.

1101
01:09:41,384 --> 01:09:43,627
The point is...

1102
01:09:43,765 --> 01:09:45,181
it could’ve been anyone.

1103
01:09:47,286 --> 01:09:49,185
We’re no longer looking
at Kathryn.

1104
01:09:49,323 --> 01:09:51,325
"We"?

1105
01:09:54,328 --> 01:09:56,226
You and me.

1106
01:09:58,401 --> 01:10:00,851
Whoa, whoa! Wh-What do I do?

1107
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:04,786
Let him run for a minute.

1108
01:10:10,344 --> 01:10:12,069
Americano for Emma.

1109
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,864
Thank you.

1110
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:39,476
Live cell zone lock.
That’s the trace log-in.

1111
01:10:39,614 --> 01:10:41,098
He’s moving.

1112
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,445
What is this, my birthday?

1113
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:44,101
Can you get it approved quickly?

1114
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,620
To keep Severus
from getting out?

1115
01:10:45,758 --> 01:10:47,001
Speed of light.

1116
01:10:47,139 --> 01:10:48,796
I’ll owe you.

1117
01:10:48,934 --> 01:10:50,694
Really, why do you care?

1118
01:10:50,832 --> 01:10:52,765
It’s a private agenda.

1119
01:10:52,903 --> 01:10:55,078
That’s not really an answer.

1120
01:10:55,837 --> 01:10:57,149
One of our people
is compromised.

1121
01:10:57,287 --> 01:10:59,116
Drone strike resets everything.

1122
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,049
Just Kulikov or am I taking
anybody else out with him?

1123
01:11:01,187 --> 01:11:02,499
It’s a gift from fucking heaven.

1124
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:04,052
- Do you want it or not?
- Yes, we want it.

1125
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:06,331
I’m just getting my arms
around the global.

1126
01:11:06,469 --> 01:11:08,988
He’s traveling across Poland
for the next three hours.

1127
01:11:09,126 --> 01:11:10,335
Don’t wait.

1128
01:11:41,883 --> 01:11:43,920
This is ikizukuri.

1129
01:11:44,058 --> 01:11:45,991
Thank you, Jimmy.

1130
01:11:54,379 --> 01:11:56,519
What do you want? Hmm?

1131
01:11:56,657 --> 01:11:59,418
Ikizukuri is illegal in the U.K.

1132
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:02,387
If you don’t mind,
I prefer to eat alone.

1133
01:12:02,525 --> 01:12:04,768
You know, I can’t see
all the corners,

1134
01:12:04,906 --> 01:12:07,668
but I can tell the shape.

1135
01:12:08,634 --> 01:12:10,981
And this, all yours.

1136
01:12:12,673 --> 01:12:14,744
What could you possibly be
talking about?

1137
01:12:14,882 --> 01:12:16,918
Oh, please.

1138
01:12:17,056 --> 01:12:20,128
Your operation stops.

1139
01:12:20,266 --> 01:12:21,785
Right now.

1140
01:12:21,923 --> 01:12:23,718
Mm.

1141
01:12:23,856 --> 01:12:25,686
You’re a little late for that.

1142
01:12:25,824 --> 01:12:27,757
- Yeah?
- Mm.

1143
01:12:27,895 --> 01:12:31,174
Ask for the CIA drone logs
when you get back.

1144
01:12:35,661 --> 01:12:38,215
How many would
a meltdown have killed?

1145
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:41,322
10,000? 20,000?

1146
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,599
What did you do?

1147
01:12:42,737 --> 01:12:44,429
Hmm?

1148
01:12:45,326 --> 01:12:47,224
Canceled your op.

1149
01:13:17,703 --> 01:13:21,569
You stupid son of a bitch.

1150
01:13:23,364 --> 01:13:26,747
You cannot imagine
the damage you just did.

1151
01:13:26,885 --> 01:13:28,611
Mm?

1152
01:13:28,749 --> 01:13:30,820
Now, I don’t know
who you enlisted to help,

1153
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:33,305
but George has got
his teeth in it now.

1154
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:35,134
- Mm.
- Have you seen him

1155
01:13:35,272 --> 01:13:37,551
when his jaws lock on something?

1156
01:13:38,586 --> 01:13:41,796
You’ll rip yourself apart
before he’ll let go.

1157
01:13:46,663 --> 01:13:48,320
Eat up.

1158
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:52,117
This ends with someone
in the boot of a car.

1159
01:14:10,825 --> 01:14:12,965
If we could make this quick.

1160
01:14:13,103 --> 01:14:15,140
- Shall we?
- Be my guest.

1161
01:14:23,804 --> 01:14:25,184
Is today Friday?

1162
01:14:25,322 --> 01:14:26,634
Yes.

1163
01:14:26,772 --> 01:14:27,911
Do you reside
in the United Kingdom?

1164
01:14:28,049 --> 01:14:29,499
Yes.

1165
01:14:29,637 --> 01:14:31,605
Is Frederick Alan Smalls
your true legal name?

1166
01:14:31,743 --> 01:14:33,020
Yes.

1167
01:14:33,158 --> 01:14:34,504
Did you masturbate this morning?

1168
01:14:34,642 --> 01:14:36,126
Oh, good.

1169
01:14:36,264 --> 01:14:38,301
The embarrassing
personal questions start early.

1170
01:14:38,439 --> 01:14:40,303
Yes or no
whenever possible, please.

1171
01:14:40,441 --> 01:14:43,375
You know, I’ve been
looking forward to this.

1172
01:14:43,513 --> 01:14:45,929
Did you masturbate this morning?

1173
01:14:46,067 --> 01:14:47,483
No.

1174
01:14:47,621 --> 01:14:48,863
Didn’t have time.

1175
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:50,244
Are you sitting down?

1176
01:14:50,382 --> 01:14:51,417
Yes.

1177
01:14:51,556 --> 01:14:53,868
Are the lights on in this room?

1178
01:14:54,006 --> 01:14:55,560
Yes.

1179
01:14:55,698 --> 01:14:58,701
Are you now
in the City of Westminster?

1180
01:14:58,839 --> 01:15:00,426
No.

1181
01:15:00,565 --> 01:15:03,015
Do you enjoy toast?

1182
01:15:03,153 --> 01:15:04,741
Very much.

1183
01:15:04,879 --> 01:15:06,709
Yes or no.

1184
01:15:06,847 --> 01:15:08,331
Yes.

1185
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:11,955
<i>Have you ever physically</i>
<i>assaulted a significant other</i>

1186
01:15:12,093 --> 01:15:13,370
<i>during an argument?</i>

1187
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,614
Girl, you know I have.

1188
01:15:15,752 --> 01:15:18,548
Again, yes or no.

1189
01:15:18,686 --> 01:15:19,687
Yes.

1190
01:15:19,825 --> 01:15:21,724
Enthusiastically.

1191
01:15:21,862 --> 01:15:23,242
<i>Do you wear contact lenses?</i>

1192
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,727
Yes.

1193
01:15:24,865 --> 01:15:26,038
Do you smoke cigarettes?

1194
01:15:26,176 --> 01:15:27,557
No.

1195
01:15:27,695 --> 01:15:29,490
Are you seated at the moment?

1196
01:15:29,628 --> 01:15:31,009
Yes.

1197
01:15:31,147 --> 01:15:32,458
<i>Is it morning or afternoon?</i>

1198
01:15:32,597 --> 01:15:34,564
Afternoon.
Can we go back to the EPQs?

1199
01:15:34,702 --> 01:15:36,117
They’re more fun.

1200
01:15:36,255 --> 01:15:38,499
Is your mother’s name Quiana?

1201
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,433
Yes.

1202
01:15:41,571 --> 01:15:44,194
When did you first
become aware of Severus?

1203
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:48,889
What’s Severus?

1204
01:15:52,651 --> 01:15:56,379
Have you ever failed
to support any child of yours?

1205
01:15:56,517 --> 01:15:58,208
Uh...

1206
01:15:58,346 --> 01:15:59,934
only emotionally.

1207
01:16:00,072 --> 01:16:01,211
Yes or no.

1208
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:03,006
Yes.

1209
01:16:04,283 --> 01:16:06,941
Were you resentful that I
passed you over for the CI job?

1210
01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:09,323
- I’m fucking human.
- Yes or no.

1211
01:16:09,461 --> 01:16:11,428
Were you resentful that
I passed you over for the job?

1212
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,396
Yes.

1213
01:16:15,294 --> 01:16:18,159
Did you steal Severus
as a means of getting even?

1214
01:16:20,265 --> 01:16:21,956
No.

1215
01:16:22,094 --> 01:16:24,096
<i>When did you first</i>
<i>become aware of Severus?</i>

1216
01:16:24,234 --> 01:16:26,547
About two months ago.

1217
01:16:26,685 --> 01:16:28,307
How did you become aware?

1218
01:16:28,445 --> 01:16:29,964
Professional restrictions
prevent me

1219
01:16:30,102 --> 01:16:31,725
from answering the question.

1220
01:16:31,863 --> 01:16:33,140
How did you become aware?

1221
01:16:33,278 --> 01:16:34,797
Same answer.

1222
01:16:34,935 --> 01:16:36,937
Did a patient divulge
the information to you?

1223
01:16:37,075 --> 01:16:38,145
Same answer.

1224
01:16:38,283 --> 01:16:39,560
Outside of war,

1225
01:16:39,698 --> 01:16:42,390
have you ever killed
another person?

1226
01:16:42,528 --> 01:16:44,289
Define "war."

1227
01:16:44,427 --> 01:16:47,085
Declared or undeclared conflict
between the United Kingdom

1228
01:16:47,223 --> 01:16:50,640
and another country
or non-state actor.

1229
01:16:50,778 --> 01:16:52,608
No.

1230
01:16:52,746 --> 01:16:54,713
Outside of war,
have you ever been

1231
01:16:54,851 --> 01:16:57,164
in a shooting, knifing or fight

1232
01:16:57,302 --> 01:16:59,960
where someone was
seriously injured?

1233
01:17:00,098 --> 01:17:01,755
Yes.

1234
01:17:01,893 --> 01:17:02,963
<i>Have you ever</i>
<i>betrayed your country?</i>

1235
01:17:03,101 --> 01:17:04,689
No.

1236
01:17:06,794 --> 01:17:08,209
What is your relationship

1237
01:17:08,347 --> 01:17:10,315
with Dr. Zoe Vaughan?

1238
01:17:11,765 --> 01:17:15,182
Patient and social acquaintance.

1239
01:17:16,804 --> 01:17:19,117
Would you like to take a break?

1240
01:17:20,187 --> 01:17:21,533
I’m good.

1241
01:17:21,671 --> 01:17:23,777
Is your middle name Beatrice?

1242
01:17:25,744 --> 01:17:26,780
No.

1243
01:17:29,023 --> 01:17:31,647
Is your middle name Beatrice?

1244
01:17:31,785 --> 01:17:33,303
No.

1245
01:17:40,794 --> 01:17:42,485
Please answer the question
truthfully.

1246
01:17:42,623 --> 01:17:44,487
Is your middle name Beatrice?

1247
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:46,109
Yeah.

1248
01:17:48,456 --> 01:17:51,701
Are you tightening your anal
sphincter muscle right now?

1249
01:17:51,839 --> 01:17:53,841
Yes.

1250
01:17:53,979 --> 01:17:56,223
Have you read
<i>Physiological Stress Response</i>

1251
01:17:56,361 --> 01:17:59,053
<i>and Polygraph Deception</i>
by Weymouth and Coombs?

1252
01:17:59,191 --> 01:18:00,710
Cover to cover.

1253
01:18:00,848 --> 01:18:02,194
Yes or no.

1254
01:18:02,332 --> 01:18:03,851
Yes.

1255
01:18:03,989 --> 01:18:06,716
Will you please release
your sphincter muscle?

1256
01:18:08,994 --> 01:18:10,893
Sure thing, George.

1257
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:14,034
Who asked you to plant
the movie stub

1258
01:18:14,172 --> 01:18:15,345
in the wastebasket
in my closet?

1259
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:16,415
What?

1260
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,211
No one.

1261
01:18:19,349 --> 01:18:20,903
How many people are you
personally connected with

1262
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:23,250
who were aware of Severus?

1263
01:18:23,388 --> 01:18:27,081
That question is
inappropriately operational.

1264
01:18:27,219 --> 01:18:28,945
How many people
are you personally...

1265
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:31,499
George, you’re CI.
You know I can’t answer that.

1266
01:18:31,637 --> 01:18:33,398
Did you steal Severus?

1267
01:18:33,536 --> 01:18:34,744
No.

1268
01:18:34,882 --> 01:18:36,850
Did you steal Severus for money?

1269
01:18:36,988 --> 01:18:38,265
No.

1270
01:18:38,403 --> 01:18:41,164
Did you steal Severus
for ideology?

1271
01:18:41,302 --> 01:18:42,890
What ideology?

1272
01:18:43,028 --> 01:18:45,617
Did you steal Severus
because of your ideology?

1273
01:18:45,755 --> 01:18:49,310
The question assumes
I stole Severus.

1274
01:18:49,448 --> 01:18:52,555
True or false: There is no God.

1275
01:18:54,177 --> 01:18:55,454
False.

1276
01:18:55,592 --> 01:18:57,077
How many sexual partners

1277
01:18:57,215 --> 01:18:59,148
have you had
in the last three months?

1278
01:18:59,286 --> 01:19:00,874
Two.

1279
01:19:03,497 --> 01:19:04,981
True or false:

1280
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:06,362
The greater good outweighs

1281
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,674
immediate legal
or ethical limits.

1282
01:19:10,228 --> 01:19:12,506
Impossible to answer
without specifics.

1283
01:19:12,644 --> 01:19:14,750
<i>Do you think you’re</i>
<i>smarter than most people?</i>

1284
01:19:14,888 --> 01:19:16,441
Georgie, I know I am.

1285
01:19:16,579 --> 01:19:18,788
Yes or no.

1286
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:20,307
Yes.

1287
01:19:20,445 --> 01:19:21,791
Would you like
to come for dinner

1288
01:19:21,929 --> 01:19:23,310
at our home tomorrow evening?

1289
01:19:23,448 --> 01:19:25,036
Huh?

1290
01:19:25,174 --> 01:19:28,625
I need your help individually
to figure something out.

1291
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,179
Can you come?

1292
01:19:30,317 --> 01:19:32,975
Um...

1293
01:19:33,113 --> 01:19:34,424
Yeah, sure.

1294
01:19:34,562 --> 01:19:37,186
Well, I had so much fun
last time.

1295
01:19:37,324 --> 01:19:38,463
Yes or no.

1296
01:19:38,601 --> 01:19:40,154
Is this an order?

1297
01:19:40,292 --> 01:19:41,777
We’ll expect you at 8:00.

1298
01:19:46,298 --> 01:19:48,300
Wait, what the fuck
did we just learn here?

1299
01:19:48,438 --> 01:19:49,785
See you tomorrow.

1300
01:19:54,272 --> 01:19:56,205
You okay?

1301
01:19:56,343 --> 01:19:58,172
Just nerves.

1302
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:01,382
Only one thing left to learn.

1303
01:20:02,383 --> 01:20:04,696
Will it go there?

1304
01:20:04,834 --> 01:20:06,663
That’s what scares me.

1305
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,665
It should.

1306
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:16,156
I haven’t had
this much fun in years.

1307
01:20:17,674 --> 01:20:19,090
What’s with
the command performance?

1308
01:20:19,228 --> 01:20:20,643
Come in.

1309
01:20:20,781 --> 01:20:22,058
Work or social?

1310
01:20:22,196 --> 01:20:23,749
Yes.

1311
01:20:26,028 --> 01:20:27,684
I thought it was just me.

1312
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:28,996
We all did.

1313
01:20:32,758 --> 01:20:34,208
So where’s this fucking dinner?

1314
01:20:34,346 --> 01:20:36,348
- I didn’t cook.
- We have a game.

1315
01:20:36,486 --> 01:20:38,074
Ah, shit. Really?

1316
01:20:38,212 --> 01:20:40,249
I don’t think I’m willing
to submit to this.

1317
01:20:40,387 --> 01:20:41,698
And here’s how it works.

1318
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,390
We go around the table

1319
01:20:43,528 --> 01:20:46,324
and George will ask
each one of you a question.

1320
01:20:46,462 --> 01:20:48,809
And if you get it wrong,
you lose.

1321
01:20:48,947 --> 01:20:49,914
This is inappropriate.

1322
01:20:50,052 --> 01:20:52,226
And the loser

1323
01:20:52,364 --> 01:20:54,159
doesn’t get up from the table.

1324
01:20:57,162 --> 01:20:58,992
- For fuck’s sake.
- Are you out of your mind?

1325
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:00,407
The two of you, I swear to God.

1326
01:21:00,545 --> 01:21:02,547
- I’m leaving.
- Sit down.

1327
01:21:02,685 --> 01:21:03,859
You are cordially
invited to an evening

1328
01:21:03,997 --> 01:21:06,620
of fun and games
with George and Kathryn.

1329
01:21:06,758 --> 01:21:08,484
That’s a new rug.

1330
01:21:08,622 --> 01:21:10,313
Anyone who’d prefer
to answer the questions

1331
01:21:10,451 --> 01:21:13,627
in front of an OSRAC committee
is free to go.

1332
01:21:13,765 --> 01:21:15,456
Why is there a new rug?

1333
01:21:15,594 --> 01:21:17,389
You’re disturbed. All of you.
Do you realize that?

1334
01:21:17,527 --> 01:21:18,977
You’re sick!

1335
01:21:19,115 --> 01:21:20,599
I mean, you just fuck
each other, literally,

1336
01:21:20,737 --> 01:21:21,980
and back and forth
and back and forth.

1337
01:21:22,118 --> 01:21:23,326
Is there one normal person

1338
01:21:23,464 --> 01:21:25,190
inside that
entire fucking building?

1339
01:21:25,328 --> 01:21:26,398
Fine!

1340
01:21:26,536 --> 01:21:28,607
I’ve got nothing to hide.

1341
01:21:28,745 --> 01:21:30,609
Then we’ll start with you.

1342
01:21:30,747 --> 01:21:32,888
When did you first
sleep with Freddie?

1343
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:36,132
Oh, that’s just gross.

1344
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:37,409
Sick.

1345
01:21:37,547 --> 01:21:38,859
My apologies.

1346
01:21:38,997 --> 01:21:41,206
That was ungentlemanly
but necessary.

1347
01:21:41,344 --> 01:21:43,277
<i>Dr. Vaughan is the woman</i>
<i>Freddie’s been meeting</i>

1348
01:21:43,415 --> 01:21:45,210
<i>at the Zetter Hotel</i>
<i>in Clerkenwell.</i>

1349
01:21:45,348 --> 01:21:46,936
<i>You motherfucker.</i>

1350
01:21:47,074 --> 01:21:48,834
<i>Seven or eight weeks ago.</i>

1351
01:21:48,973 --> 01:21:50,906
-<i>Thank you.</i>
-<i>Is that a joke?</i>

1352
01:21:51,044 --> 01:21:53,287
<i>With him? Why?</i>

1353
01:21:53,425 --> 01:21:55,289
<i>Manipulation.</i>

1354
01:21:55,427 --> 01:21:57,326
<i>She thought she’d need </i><i> </i>
<i>something from him eventually.</i>

1355
01:21:57,464 --> 01:21:59,397
Ah, come on. Don’t be a prick.
Isn’t it just possible...

1356
01:21:59,535 --> 01:22:01,986
No, it isn’t.

1357
01:22:02,124 --> 01:22:03,573
He’s right.

1358
01:22:03,711 --> 01:22:06,128
After the redirect
was discovered,

1359
01:22:06,266 --> 01:22:08,371
you alerted Dr. Vaughan,
didn’t you?

1360
01:22:08,509 --> 01:22:11,823
Yes, that’s right.

1361
01:22:12,824 --> 01:22:14,619
You’ll want to know about this.

1362
01:22:14,757 --> 01:22:16,000
I need you to do something.

1363
01:22:16,138 --> 01:22:17,725
I am putty in your hands.
What is it?

1364
01:22:17,863 --> 01:22:20,659
<i>So, you told me</i>
<i>about the redirect,</i>

1365
01:22:20,797 --> 01:22:24,008
<i>knowing that I would take</i>
<i>action to cover for George.</i>

1366
01:22:24,146 --> 01:22:26,217
He’s traveling across Poland
for the next three hours.

1367
01:22:26,355 --> 01:22:27,321
Don’t wait.

1368
01:22:38,056 --> 01:22:39,747
Yes.

1369
01:22:39,885 --> 01:22:41,749
Clarissa.

1370
01:22:43,096 --> 01:22:44,752
What the fuck do you want?

1371
01:22:45,753 --> 01:22:47,790
Only to congratulate you.

1372
01:22:47,928 --> 01:22:51,104
You’re the best manipulator
of the polygraph I’ve ever seen.

1373
01:22:52,829 --> 01:22:54,521
- I didn’t lie.
- I know.

1374
01:22:54,659 --> 01:22:55,971
You didn’t need to.

1375
01:22:56,109 --> 01:22:58,145
You had nothing to do
with any of it.

1376
01:22:59,698 --> 01:23:02,874
Was it your idea to plant
the movie ticket so I’d find it

1377
01:23:03,012 --> 01:23:04,945
or someone else’s?

1378
01:23:05,083 --> 01:23:06,912
What movie ticket?

1379
01:23:07,051 --> 01:23:08,397
Did catch my eye.

1380
01:23:08,535 --> 01:23:10,537
Not so hard to do,
given my profession.

1381
01:23:10,675 --> 01:23:12,263
The hell are you
talking about, George?

1382
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:14,886
Was Stieglitz the one
who came to you with the idea

1383
01:23:15,024 --> 01:23:16,819
of stealing Severus?

1384
01:23:16,957 --> 01:23:20,167
<i> </i><i>That would make the most sense.</i>

1385
01:23:20,305 --> 01:23:22,894
To destabilize Moscow,
to implicate Kathryn,

1386
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:26,208
who threatened Stieglitz,
and to move me out of your way.

1387
01:23:26,346 --> 01:23:28,451
Three birds, one stone.

1388
01:23:28,589 --> 01:23:30,591
<i>Somehow, you removed</i>

1389
01:23:30,729 --> 01:23:33,387
<i>the Severus malware</i>
<i>from the building.</i>

1390
01:23:33,525 --> 01:23:36,080
<i>But you got excited</i>
<i>about your plan,</i>

1391
01:23:36,218 --> 01:23:39,911
<i>you drank too much </i><i> </i>
<i>and told Dr. Vaughan about it.</i>

1392
01:23:40,049 --> 01:23:41,499
What you didn’t know

1393
01:23:41,637 --> 01:23:43,984
is how profound
her religious beliefs are.

1394
01:23:44,122 --> 01:23:45,503
You’re turning on me

1395
01:23:45,641 --> 01:23:47,229
to cover up
your own treasonous actions.

1396
01:23:47,367 --> 01:23:49,300
The kind of beliefs
that would not permit her

1397
01:23:49,438 --> 01:23:51,992
to allow the deaths of tens
of thousands in a meltdown.

1398
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:53,511
This is a fantasy.

1399
01:23:53,649 --> 01:23:56,065
This is all one of
his fucking fantasies.

1400
01:23:56,203 --> 01:23:58,136
It’s why I had
a hard time at first.

1401
01:23:58,274 --> 01:24:01,036
It wasn’t one plan,
you see, it was two.

1402
01:24:01,174 --> 01:24:03,072
Separate but interlocking.

1403
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:06,593
Working for and against
each other.

1404
01:24:06,731 --> 01:24:10,390
You manipulated me
so Pavlichuk could escape.

1405
01:24:10,528 --> 01:24:12,771
And you and Freddie
did the same with Kathryn

1406
01:24:12,909 --> 01:24:16,568
so she would have him killed
to bail me out.

1407
01:24:16,706 --> 01:24:19,502
<i>Causa et effectus.</i>

1408
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,677
Isn’t that right?

1409
01:24:21,815 --> 01:24:23,955
You two make it almost easy.

1410
01:24:24,093 --> 01:24:26,647
The only thing you give a shit
about is each other.

1411
01:24:26,785 --> 01:24:28,097
For the record, I knew.

1412
01:24:28,235 --> 01:24:30,789
I did it anyway
because it needed doing.

1413
01:24:30,927 --> 01:24:33,551
And you had me lured to Zurich.

1414
01:24:34,586 --> 01:24:37,451
I thought I was
buying back Severus,

1415
01:24:37,589 --> 01:24:40,040
but you made it look like
I was selling.

1416
01:24:40,178 --> 01:24:42,767
You opened the account
in Myanmar yourself,

1417
01:24:42,905 --> 01:24:44,527
didn’t you?

1418
01:24:45,597 --> 01:24:47,944
This is all conjecture.

1419
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:49,463
Turns out

1420
01:24:49,601 --> 01:24:52,811
Myanmar does cooperate.

1421
01:24:52,949 --> 01:24:57,920
You just have to know
who to ask.

1422
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,929
Razman still owes me.

1423
01:25:13,349 --> 01:25:15,834
Severus was a good plan.

1424
01:25:17,042 --> 01:25:19,976
I’d do it again,
ten times out of ten.

1425
01:25:21,012 --> 01:25:22,324
It was a decent frame,

1426
01:25:22,462 --> 01:25:25,534
and it would have ended
the fucking war!

1427
01:25:28,157 --> 01:25:32,541
It was right, it was brave,
and it was noble.

1428
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:34,612
Which one was the reason
you killed Meacham?

1429
01:25:37,304 --> 01:25:41,032
<i>Because it was right</i>
<i>or because it was noble?</i>

1430
01:25:43,241 --> 01:25:45,140
Because it was necessary.

1431
01:25:45,278 --> 01:25:46,865
I never told you all
the name of the game.

1432
01:25:47,003 --> 01:25:48,695
What’s the game, Kathryn?

1433
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:50,006
"See Who Picks Up the Gun."

1434
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,767
For fuck’s sake.

1435
01:25:51,905 --> 01:25:53,527
Come on, George.

1436
01:25:53,665 --> 01:25:55,702
What? You take me out
in handcuffs,

1437
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,842
you say your bit,
I say mine, then what?

1438
01:25:57,980 --> 01:26:00,362
You still go down.

1439
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,191
Maybe she doesn’t, but you will.

1440
01:26:03,779 --> 01:26:06,540
You got nothing-- nothing hard.

1441
01:26:06,678 --> 01:26:09,612
You got suspicions,
hearsay and pillow talk.

1442
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:13,720
And, you know,
your recorded confession.

1443
01:26:17,206 --> 01:26:19,588
Shall we discuss the terms
of your surrender?

1444
01:26:19,726 --> 01:26:22,453
You’re bluffing.

1445
01:26:22,591 --> 01:26:24,731
You should’ve killed me
on the boat, George.

1446
01:26:37,916 --> 01:26:39,608
Now, I don’t mind
what you two did.

1447
01:26:39,746 --> 01:26:41,299
You saved lives.

1448
01:26:41,437 --> 01:26:44,578
But don’t ever fuck
with my marriage again.

1449
01:26:45,924 --> 01:26:47,581
Okay.

1450
01:26:50,308 --> 01:26:52,690
Freddie. Table.

1451
01:26:58,074 --> 01:27:00,456
Darling, we need the rug.

1452
01:27:47,607 --> 01:27:49,229
Ninth floor.

1453
01:27:49,367 --> 01:27:50,403
Doors opening.

1454
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,311
Lift going down.

1455
01:28:02,449 --> 01:28:04,279
Doors closing.

1456
01:28:06,902 --> 01:28:09,353
Terrible about Stokes.

1457
01:28:09,491 --> 01:28:11,596
- So strange.
- Mm.

1458
01:28:11,734 --> 01:28:13,322
Disappearing like that.

1459
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,979
It’s a very dangerous
line of work.

1460
01:28:15,117 --> 01:28:16,912
Mm, I’ll say.

1461
01:28:19,017 --> 01:28:20,916
Given all you’ve accomplished,

1462
01:28:21,054 --> 01:28:25,300
maybe it’s time to consider
stepping away, Arthur.

1463
01:28:26,991 --> 01:28:28,717
Feet first.

1464
01:28:28,855 --> 01:28:29,752
Second floor.

1465
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:32,410
Doors opening.

1466
01:28:32,548 --> 01:28:34,723
Any way you like.

1467
01:28:36,518 --> 01:28:38,382
Lift going down.

1468
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,349
<i>He’s completely rattled.</i>

1469
01:28:40,487 --> 01:28:42,109
<i>Fantastic.</i>

1470
01:28:42,247 --> 01:28:44,008
He won’t be able to sleep
for a whole month.

1471
01:28:44,146 --> 01:28:45,389
He wasn’t rattled.

1472
01:28:45,527 --> 01:28:48,253
He took credit
for the whole thing.

1473
01:28:48,392 --> 01:28:52,534
The CIA is lap dancing
all over him.

1474
01:28:52,672 --> 01:28:54,052
It’s a fiction.

1475
01:28:54,190 --> 01:28:55,709
He won’t be able
to keep it up forever.

1476
01:28:55,847 --> 01:28:58,194
And Stieglitz bores me.

1477
01:29:00,783 --> 01:29:04,580
Let’s... let’s talk about you.

1478
01:29:04,718 --> 01:29:08,239
Why didn’t you just ask me
about the movie ticket?

1479
01:29:08,377 --> 01:29:11,035
Hmm? See if I was lying?

1480
01:29:11,173 --> 01:29:13,071
Faith.

1481
01:29:13,209 --> 01:29:15,246
You’d never be that sloppy.

1482
01:29:15,384 --> 01:29:17,213
A movie stub. Please.

1483
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,492
Well, exactly.

1484
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:22,357
It’s almost insulting.

1485
01:29:26,602 --> 01:29:29,433
- I knew you’d never lie to me.
- Only if I had to.

1486
01:29:29,571 --> 01:29:31,538
Obviously.

1487
01:29:33,195 --> 01:29:35,093
One thing.

1488
01:29:35,231 --> 01:29:37,406
The, uh, seven million pounds

1489
01:29:37,544 --> 01:29:40,961
Stokes put into
the Swiss bank account?

1490
01:29:41,099 --> 01:29:42,238
Still there.

1491
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,551
Oh. Is it?
