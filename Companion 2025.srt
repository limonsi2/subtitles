1
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,338
Most of the time, it's like--

2
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,422
I don't know.

3
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,508
It's like there's
this thick, black cloud

4
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,760
covering everything.

5
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,388
Like we see the world,

6
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,141
but we don't really
see the world, you know?

7
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,937
We're all
just stumbling around.

8
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,354
Directionless.
No sense of meaning.

9
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,691
No sense of purpose.

10
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,361
I know that might
sound super depressing,

11
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,407
but honestly,
I think it's a good thing.

12
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,036
Because it makes us appreciate
the other times.

13
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,290
Those brief,
transcendent moments

14
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,084
when the lights flicker on,
the black cloud parts,

15
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,003
and you see the world
for what it really is.

16
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,131
Oh.

17
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,636
And suddenly there's meaning.

18
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,181
Suddenly there's purpose.

19
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,147
So, uh, do you--

20
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:49,193
Oh, shit.
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

21
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,654
Shit.

22
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,702
If you're lucky,

23
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,787
you'll experience this
once in your lifetime.

24
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,665
Goddamn, that was...

25
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,625
- That was smooth.
- Yeah.

26
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,709
For me...

27
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,835
So smooth.

28
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,086
...it happened twice.

29
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,548
The first
was the day I met Josh.

30
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,926
Uh, I'm Josh.

31
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,011
I'm Iris.

32
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,472
And the second...

33
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,975
the day I killed him.

34
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,613
Iris, wake up.

35
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,578
Hey, sleepyhead.

36
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,498
How long was I out?

37
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,251
Uh, for a while.

38
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:51,004
Yeah, you were
zonked out there pretty good.

39
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:54,423
I was having
the most wonderful dream.

40
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,176
Oh, yeah? About me?

41
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,512
Well, that is
very presumptuous, but...

42
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,430
Yeah.

43
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,599
- ...yes.
-  Yes. Knew it.

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,767
Was it sexy times?

45
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,269
No, you deviant.

46
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,854
- Little bit of sexy times?
- No, I was--

47
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:08,938
- Was my shirt off?
- No,

48
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,191
I was dreaming
about the day we met.

49
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,652
It was all so perfect.

50
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,238
Remember
how perfect it all was?

51
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,657
Yeah, no.
No, how could I forget?

52
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,493
The supermarket, the oranges.

53
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,125
What road is this?

54
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,836
It's not showing up
on the GPS.

55
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,920
I don't think this is
the road.

56
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,840
Think this might be
the driveway.

57
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,913
You have arrived

58
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,539
at your destination.

59
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,042
Thank you, Josh's car.

60
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,629
Thank you, car.

61
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,463
Pop the trunk.

62
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,506
Popping trunk.

63
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,593
Fuck me.

64
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,220
Kat called this place

65
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,138
a "little rustic cabin
in the woods."

66
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,556
I think we might have
differing opinions

67
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,893
on the meaning
of the word "cabin."

68
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,479
Also "rustic."

69
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,772
Also "little."

70
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:40,447
What?

71
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,159
Iris. Come on.
You know you can't lie to me.

72
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,285
Tell me what's wrong.

73
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,745
I'm gonna do something stupid.

74
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,205
I'm gonna say
something stupid.

75
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,207
I'm gonna embarrass you.
They're gonna laugh at me.

76
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,376
They're gonna hate me.
They already hate me.

77
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,460
Jesus Christ, Iris.

78
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,003
We've been planning this trip
for months,

79
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,964
and this is all
just coming out now?

80
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,507
Like 20 feet
from the fucking door?

81
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,220
Look, look. Hey.

82
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,097
My friends don't hate you.

83
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,181
Kat does.

84
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,685
Yeah, m-maybe,
but Kat hates everybody.

85
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,854
I just don't wanna
screw everything up.

86
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,731
Come on, Beep-Boop. You're
not gonna screw everything up.

87
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,651
Just relax, you know?

88
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,903
Don't be all mopey and weird.

89
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,488
Just remember to--

90
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,867
remember to smile
and act happy.

91
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,410
Okay?

92
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:33,708
Yay! You made it.
Fucking finally.

93
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,502
Okay, so when you said remote,
I thought you meant, like,

94
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,171
a couple miles
off the highway.

95
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,756
I didn't realize you meant
edge of fucking civilization.

96
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,175
Oh, don't be
so dramatic, Josh.

97
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,218
- It's not that far.
- Okay, hard disagree.

98
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,349
Uh, hello, Iris.

99
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,394
Hi, Kat.
It's so good to see you.

100
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,354
So good.

101
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,859
Everyone, look who I found.

102
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,360
-  Hey, Patrick.
- Hey.

103
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,945
Look at you
in the kitchen, man.

104
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,072
Yeah, look at me. Welcome.
I would give you a hug,

105
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,366
but I've got scallop hands.
Sorry.

106
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,744
Okay, well, I appreciate that.
Where's--

107
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,163
-  There he is!
- Hey!

108
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:15,583
Joshyboy, Joshyboy.

109
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,667
Hey, buddy.

110
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,960
You too, girl. Get in here.

111
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,213
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi! How are you?

112
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,798
I'm good. Uh, I'm... drunk.

113
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,177
- Oh.
-  Good. This is good.

114
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,179
Oh, and, Josh,
you remember Sergey.

115
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,264
Hey.

116
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,145
Hey, Sergey.
Nice to see you again.

117
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,939
- Likewise, my friend.
- Oh.

118
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,524
Likewise.

119
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:43,528
And this beautiful creation
must be Iris.

120
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,279
- Hello.
- Mmm.

121
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,197
Such pleasure.

122
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,907
I have heard lot
about this one.

123
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,078
Really? All good I hope.

124
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,460
Your lake house, it's really--
it's incredible.

125
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,003
-  Yeah, and so secluded.
-  Yeah.

126
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,172
I mean, I think
the last place we passed

127
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,841
was like ten miles back.

128
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,426
Seventeen.
And I paid for this.

129
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,554
Privacy does not come cheap,
my friends.

130
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,347
Not cheap at all.

131
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,932
Don't tell me
you own the whole lake.

132
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,812
No, no, no. Don't be silly.
Just all the land around it.

133
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,188
But let's
get you guys a drink.

134
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,148
What do you like?
Beer, cocktail, wine?

135
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,193
I'm fine. More than anything,
I just need a shower.

136
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,987
Katyonak,
what room they are in?

137
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,030
Uh, up the stairs,
down the hall,

138
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,532
- last door on the left.
- Okay.

139
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,952
- I'll see you later. Yeah.
- Okay, I'll see you. Bye.

140
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,561
Smile.

141
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,650
Act happy.

142
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,737
Okay, continue.
Continue with the story.

143
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,322
Anyway, so I was

144
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:54,867
wearing this ridiculously
elaborate Dracula costume,

145
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,329
and I didn't know
a single person, as I said.

146
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,581
So I'm standing
by the snack table

147
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:04,335
just munching on carrots
and something

148
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,587
- that looked like hummus--
- It wasn't hummus.

149
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,672
It was not hummus.

150
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,175
It was not hummus,
I don't think, but I--

151
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,761
I feel a tap on my shoulder.

152
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,972
And so I turn around,

153
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:21,143
and there's this green,
puffy dinosaur

154
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,437
just staring me down.

155
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,022
And inside its head,

156
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:28,819
I hear this very muffled,
very annoyed voice say...

157
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,029
"You're standing on my tail."

158
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,449
So I turn around, I look down,
and sure enough,

159
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,828
I'm standing
on his little dino tail.

160
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,789
So I step off and apologize.

161
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,459
And he takes his head off,

162
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,503
and I'm looking
at the most beautiful man

163
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,256
that I've ever seen
in my life.

164
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,592
So, did you meet
this beautiful man

165
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,428
- after you met Eli, or...
- Okay, you know what? Shut up.

166
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,471
-  Was that a scallop?
-  That was a scallop.

167
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,974
- Actually hit me.
-  Yeah, I took baseball.

168
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:00,892
Yes, you did.

169
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,144
Well, when did you know?

170
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,479
Uh, know what?

171
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,565
That--

172
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,900
That he was the one.

173
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,152
Oh.

174
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,153
Right then and there.

175
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,990
I know it's gonna
sound cheesy, but the moment--

176
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,952
the moment we locked eyes,
something inside of me just...

177
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,495
clicked into place.

178
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,415
Doesn't sound cheesy at all.

179
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:24,917
I get it.

180
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:30,296
It's like there's this piece
of you

181
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,256
that you didn't
even know was broken,

182
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,342
and then...

183
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,721
suddenly it's-- it's fixed.

184
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,850
And you're-- you're staring
at this stranger,

185
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,854
this person
you've never met before,

186
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,273
and you know...

187
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,652
that for the rest
of your life,

188
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:57,449
you will do whatever it takes
to make this person happy.

189
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:03,829
Right?

190
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,623
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah.

191
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,125
Yeah, totally.

192
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,965
Patrick, this food
is unbelievable. Thank you.

193
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,883
Thank you, Sergey.
That's so nice of you.

194
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,093
Um, I'm glad you like it.

195
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,678
He spoils me.
I swear I've gained

196
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,847
like ten pounds
since we started dating.

197
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:24,226
-  Only ten?
- Shut the fuck up. Okay?

198
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,272
So, Sergey,
what kind of work do you do?

199
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:34,069
Oh, you know,
I have fingers in many pots.

200
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,449
My hands are not clean,
my friend.

201
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,742
It's a...

202
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:46,164
...a very dirty business.

203
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,709
Sergey seems--

204
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,793
He seems nice.

205
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:51,878
Oh, yeah.

206
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,048
He's got everything
you want in a man.

207
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,885
Yeah, he's rich, intelligent.

208
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,970
He's got a beautiful wife.

209
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:04,640
Wife? So, he--
Sergey's married?

210
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,892
Mm-hmm.

211
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,436
But you love--
you love each other?

212
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:11,272
Love? No. No, no, no.

213
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:15,193
He'd have to think of me as a
human being first.

214
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,945
I don't understand.

215
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,532
I'm an accessory,
like his fucking car.

216
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,370
I wear what he wants.
Eat what he wants.

217
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,457
Fuck when he wants.

218
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,172
Look who I'm talking to.

219
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,347
Do you not like me, Kat?

220
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:49,561
You know, it's not that
I don't like you, Iris.

221
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,272
It's the idea of you.

222
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,441
You make me feel so...

223
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,694
replaceable.

224
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,322
Replaceable?

225
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,368
Nobody could replace you, Kat.

226
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,993
I mean, you're Kat.

227
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,412
And you're so fearless.
It's inspiring.

228
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,248
I wish I could be
more like you, but...

229
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,419
...you know,
I wasn't built that way.

230
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,755
I just...

231
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,632
I feel like there's always
something inside of me

232
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,717
holding me back.

233
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,411
No, no, no.

234
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,496
♪ Uh-huh ♪

235
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,498
Come on.

236
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,212
♪ Uh-huh ♪

237
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,465
Okay, get up, bitch.

238
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,467
- Get up! Come on!
- No. Oh, God.

239
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,345
-  Come on!
-  That's right.

240
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,221
-  You too.
- What the fuck?

241
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,598
Put that phone away
and get up.

242
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,266
- Okay.
-  Get your asses up.

243
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,186
-  Come on.
-  Come on!

244
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,360
Iris, what are you doing?

245
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,178
Ah!

246
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,027
I'm so glad we did this.

247
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,739
Being here with you
is just perfect.

248
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,992
Uh-huh.

249
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:55,539
I'm sorry if I was being weird
or mopey earlier.

250
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:03,379
I just want you
to be happy, Josh. That's all.

251
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,048
Iris, go to sleep.

252
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,567
It's such a gorgeous day out.

253
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:25,903
Uh, what's the weather?

254
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:28,029
It's currently 72 degrees

255
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,781
with an 83% chance
of rain in the evening.

256
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,367
It never gets old.

257
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,334
-  You almost ready?
- Oh, I'm sorry, babe.

258
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,877
I think I need
some time to shower

259
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:44,545
and pound
a few gallons of coffee.

260
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,880
Why don't, uh--

261
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:48,007
Why don't you head
down there by yourself?

262
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,593
But it was your idea.

263
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,262
You said you wanted a nice,
relaxing morning by the lake.

264
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:56,098
I know, but that's before the
hangover caught up with me.

265
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,435
Last night was a lot.

266
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:00,979
You had fun though, right?

267
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:03,941
Of course I did, Beep-Boop.

268
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,276
Last night was incredible.

269
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,415
You want me to wait?

270
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,795
We could
make the shower for two.

271
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,383
Nah, no, no.
That's okay. Um...

272
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,510
You go on ahead.

273
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,596
Enjoy as much of this
gorgeous day as you can.

274
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,349
- Okay.
-  Yeah.

275
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,560
Hmm.

276
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,409
Sorry?

277
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,912
Means "good morning."

278
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,248
Oh, yes.

279
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,749
Dobroe utro to you too.

280
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,710
Hey, your Russian is not bad.

281
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:33,381
It is not good,
but also it is not bad.

282
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,344
Nice view.

283
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:45,936
To love.

284
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:55,695
Mmm.

285
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:56,779
You like?

286
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,283
I think I'm actually going to
head back inside.

287
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:01,492
So soon?

288
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:02,952
Yeah...

289
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:04,662
Josh wasn't feeling great
this morning,

290
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:06,122
so I think I should
check in on him.

291
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:08,958
Josh is big boy.
He can take care of himself.

292
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,961
Stay. Keep Sergey company.

293
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,464
I really think I should
see him.

294
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,634
You...

295
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,554
like lake house, yes?

296
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,389
Yeah.

297
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,017
You enjoy your time here?

298
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:28,227
Mm-hmm. Yeah, very much.

299
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:32,064
Then as guest, please stay.

300
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,484
Keep this old Russian man
company.

301
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,697
- Okay.
- Wonderful.

302
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:40,782
Mmm.

303
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,920
Oh.

304
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,380
You mind?

305
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,466
Just back and shoulders.

306
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,384
- It's tough to reach.
- Oh.

307
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,429
Don't want to get too tan.

308
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:13,607
Okay.

309
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:17,569
Mmm.

310
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:23,115
And shoulders, please.

311
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,368
Okay.

312
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:40,384
What are you doing?

313
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:45,389
It's not problem.
This Kat's idea.

314
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,891
She tell Sergey
you are down here.

315
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,852
Give Sergey permission.

316
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,145
Let go of my hand, please.

317
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,023
This is what you do, yes?

318
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,735
This is what you are for.

319
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,198
-  Mmm.
- Please.

320
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:05,075
Please stop.

321
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:09,078
I was drunk.
I mean, you--

322
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,121
Last night,
it was crazy.

323
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:11,163
You were extremely drunk.

324
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,165
You were drunk too.
Like, more drunk than I got.

325
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,876
I don't really get drunk.
It's like this gift.

326
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:16,794
Like, people get bloated
and stuff, and not me.

327
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,921
- Like, never happens.
- Never get bloated.

328
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,965
Never. It's like I could drink
and do whatever I want.

329
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:23,176
- It's like you get dehydrated.
- Yeah, just, like--

330
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:24,511
What the fuck?

331
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,679
Oh, shit.

332
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,558
Iris, what the fuck?

333
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,935
I didn't mean to. He--

334
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,148
He forced himself on me.

335
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,691
Who did?

336
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:39,943
Sergey?

337
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,361
Mmm.

338
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,613
Please.

339
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:46,366
Sergey just want little taste.

340
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,955
I just wanted him to stop.

341
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:55,918
Oh, God. Sergey.

342
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:02,590
Iris. Hey, look at me. Look
at me. Talk me through it.

343
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:03,759
What happened?

344
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,303
I--

345
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:11,558
I said stop!

346
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,314
I didn't have a choice.

347
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:26,698
Sergey?

348
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:45,132
He wouldn't let go.
He was choking me, Josh.

349
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,263
And then I--

350
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:51,848
And then you what, Iris?
Then you what?

351
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,187
He was trying to kill me,

352
00:23:58,188 --> 00:23:59,397
and the only thing
I could think about

353
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:00,565
was that if he did kill me,

354
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,149
I'd never get to
see you again,

355
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,861
and that hurt so much more
than the pain of being choked!

356
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:06,404
I wouldn't let that happen.

357
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:07,780
I couldn't let him take me
away from you.

358
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,782
I love you so much!

359
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,159
Iris, go to sleep.

360
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,381
Okay.
Don't forget her ankles, okay?

361
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:26,048
Okay.

362
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,550
Are you sure
this is gonna hold?

363
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,093
Yeah, no, it's fine.

364
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:30,553
She's not superhuman
or anything.

365
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:32,764
She's only as strong
as they want her to be.

366
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:56,747
Handcuff knot.

367
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,501
- Hey.
- Hey.

368
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:02,835
How's she doing?

369
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:05,254
She's asleep.
I gave her two Xanax.

370
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,548
Xanaxes? Xani?

371
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,926
- Whatever, she's asleep.
- Okay, good. Good.

372
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:11,470
So...

373
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:13,971
what do we do now?

374
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,848
Uh, I mean,
the only thing we can do.

375
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,226
We call the cops.
We tell them everything.

376
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:19,435
Right, yeah.

377
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:21,522
- Yeah.
- But what about...

378
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:26,568
Well, uh, obviously
I'll need to, uh, you know.

379
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:29,487
I just don't understand
how this could have happened.

380
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:31,155
Don't they have safeguards
for this kind of shit?

381
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,491
I have no idea.

382
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,868
Like a glitch maybe?

383
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:36,703
Yeah.

384
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:41,875
Okay. Okay, so...

385
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,169
I'll call the cops,
and you will...

386
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,129
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

387
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,091
Sorry, do you mind,
um, taking it outside?

388
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:53,679
Just 'cause...
I-- I wanna say goodbye.

389
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:56,931
Yeah.

390
00:25:56,932 --> 00:25:58,642
- Yeah, buddy. Sure.
- Yeah, thanks.

391
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:09,902
Iris, wake up.

392
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:10,987
...be lost without you!

393
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:13,614
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, it's okay. You're okay.

394
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,741
- You're okay. I'm here. Hey.
-  Josh.

395
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,326
Listen to me.

396
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:20,705
Wait. Why are my hands tied?
Why are my hands tied, Josh?

397
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:23,082
Iris. We didn't have a choice.
We didn't have a choice.

398
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,876
You murdered Sergey.
You remember?

399
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:25,793
No, no, no, no.

400
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:27,545
It was self-defense.
He was gonna kill me.

401
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:29,589
He was gonna kill me.
You gotta believe me.

402
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,174
No, I believe you, Iris.

403
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,010
I mean, you couldn't lie to me
even if you wanted to.

404
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:34,719
What?

405
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,182
It's, um,
part of your programming.

406
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,560
Programming? What the hell
are you talking about?

407
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:44,562
Okay, um...

408
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:46,981
Sorry, there's just
no delicate way to say this.

409
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:51,068
So, I'm just gonna
rip the Band-Aid right off.

410
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:54,406
You're a robot.

411
00:26:57,618 --> 00:26:58,618
I'm...

412
00:26:58,619 --> 00:26:59,995
A robot.

413
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:06,210
More specifically,
you're a companion robot.

414
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:10,087
A companion robot?

415
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,007
Yeah, it's like a, um...

416
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:15,718
I hate the word "fuckbot."

417
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:18,514
Um, 'cause you do so much more
than that, but, uh...

418
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,351
You're an
emotional support robot...

419
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:24,853
that fucks.

420
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:27,688
You're joking, right?

421
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,690
- This is just a sick--
- Iris, what's the weather?

422
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:30,775
It's currently 72 degrees

423
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:33,195
with an 83% chance
of rain in the evening.

424
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:38,282
- Are--
- Hmm.

425
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:40,117
Are you still not convinced?

426
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:41,828
Yeah, okay, uh...

427
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,121
Let's see.

428
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,957
Iris, do you know
any foreign languages?

429
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,459
Can you speak, say, Spanish?

430
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,963
Josh, you know
no sé hablar español.

431
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:53,506
¿Qué?

432
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:55,341
How about Chinese?

433
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:58,678
Do I need to keep going?

434
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,179
'Cause I can go, uh...

435
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,515
I can do Portuguese.
I can do Korean.

436
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:03,767
I can do, uh...

437
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:07,353
I don't know what Telugu is,
but apparently you speak it.

438
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:09,231
I don't-- I don't understand.

439
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:10,940
I--

440
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:12,400
No, no, no. I have memories.

441
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:15,945
Uh, uh... College.
Uh, summer jobs. I've--

442
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:18,406
I've been to Japan. Twice.

443
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:19,782
Okay, so what those are--

444
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:20,867
Those are, um...

445
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:23,286
They're like outlines
of memories.

446
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:26,873
You know, just enough to give
you a little, uh, backstory.

447
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:29,083
The-- The-- The day we met
in the grocery store.

448
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:32,753
You and the oranges. That is
not an outline of a memory.

449
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:34,630
Yeah, it's fake.
Never happened.

450
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:35,715
I just randomly picked it

451
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,133
from a drop-down list
of meet-cutes.

452
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:39,844
It could've been anywhere.
It could've been dog park,

453
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:43,015
a bookstore, farmer's market.

454
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,393
It never happened?

455
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,061
Okay, do, um--

456
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,982
Do you wanna know how we met?
Like, how we really met?

457
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,323
Hey. Josh Beeman?

458
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:01,657
- Yeah, that's me.
- Okay.

459
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:03,160
- Yeah, come on in.
- Thank you.

460
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,168
Sorry.

461
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:13,795
How you doing?

462
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:19,967
Okay, this is
the user agreement.

463
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:21,093
- Okay.
- Just give it a read

464
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,138
and then sign at the bottom
when you're done.

465
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:24,890
Um...

466
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:32,980
So, um, what do I do

467
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:36,318
when she, like,
boots up or whatever?

468
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,694
Well, once she's done
syncing with your phone,

469
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,447
you'll need to
create a love link.

470
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:42,949
- Love link?
- Yeah. It establishes

471
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,244
the emotional connection
between you and...

472
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:48,913
Iris.

473
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:51,040
Just follow the vocal prompts
when she wakes up.

474
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,459
It's all pretty intuitive.

475
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:58,297
Do they-- Do they know
that they're robots?

476
00:29:58,298 --> 00:29:59,382
Not at all.

477
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:02,426
She'll be so fixated on you,
your wants, your needs,

478
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:03,803
that'll never even occur
to her.

479
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:05,596
The whole experience
is customizable.

480
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:07,974
You can change her voice,
eye color, intelligence,

481
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:10,810
and if you ever wanna revert
back to her factory settings,

482
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:13,229
there is a thumbprint sensor
behind her right ear.

483
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,356
Just hold your thumb there
for five seconds,

484
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:16,440
she'll reset.

485
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:19,235
You can-- You can
change their intelligence?

486
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:20,611
Yeah, but don't worry.

487
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:23,155
There's about a billion
government regulations

488
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,532
that force us to limit

489
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:26,242
how strong and smart
they can be.

490
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:28,369
A hundred-percent intelligence
would be the equivalent

491
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,495
of an Ivy League grad.

492
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:32,708
Zero percent would be
a mindless automaton.

493
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,418
It really just depends on
what kind of partner you want.

494
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:38,171
She can't lie.
So if you ask her a question,

495
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:40,131
she literally has to
tell you the truth.

496
00:30:40,132 --> 00:30:42,175
And for obvious reasons,
her programming prevents her

497
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,177
from causing harm
to humans, animals,

498
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:46,304
or other companions.
Trust me, Mr. Beeman.

499
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:47,930
You have nothing
to worry about.

500
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,224
Iris is completely docile.

501
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:52,978
She's yours to do
whatever you want with.

502
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:24,342
To establish love link,
please place your face

503
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:27,095
within three feet
of my field of vision.

504
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:45,072
Please say your name.

505
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:50,243
Josh Beeman.

506
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:55,332
Thank you, Josh Beeman.

507
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:17,771
Love link established.

508
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:30,409
Hey, you.

509
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:33,620
H-Hi.

510
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,041
Um...

511
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:41,336
Uh...

512
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:43,797
So...

513
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:46,757
Oh, my God. Oh, fuck.

514
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:47,843
Oh, fuck!

515
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:50,554
Oh, God!

516
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:56,351
I don't understand.

517
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,729
I feel things.

518
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:03,775
Anger, guilt, sadness. I--

519
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,737
I know what pain feels like.

520
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:09,156
It's programming.

521
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:11,866
It's just a way
to make you seem more real.

522
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:14,452
Everything you do,
your whole life,

523
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:16,330
it's just an imitation
of a life.

524
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:21,209
There-- There we go.
Perfect. Okay.

525
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,753
This is just water.

526
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:26,339
You know, it's from
a reservoir in your body.

527
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,633
It's like wiper fluid.

528
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:30,801
I get it topped off every time
I take you in to get serviced.

529
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:32,053
Oh, God. I'm gonna be sick.

530
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:33,514
No, you're not!

531
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:36,224
Iris, it's programming.

532
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:38,435
Stop saying that!

533
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:43,231
Yeah, you're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.

534
00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:45,317
I know this must be
a lot to process.

535
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:58,956
Okay.

536
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,543
Okay, what?

537
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:04,378
I'm not real.

538
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:08,465
But I'm still yours.

539
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,678
We can get through this.
We can go back home.

540
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,054
I'll do whatever you want.

541
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:19,016
I'll cook for you, wait
on you, make love to you.

542
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:22,727
I can make you happy, Josh.

543
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,690
I can make you
so, so, so, so happy.

544
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:29,360
No.

545
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,322
I'm sorry, Iris.
That can't happen.

546
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,241
Why not?

547
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:36,827
Uh, what are you doing?

548
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,120
- Nothing, okay?
- What the fuck

549
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:41,122
are you waiting for?

550
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:42,790
- Shut her down already.
- Shut me down?

551
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:45,626
- Fuck, Kat. Jesus Christ!
- What is she talking about?

552
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:47,544
- Shut me down? Josh!
- Nothing, nothing. Just--

553
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:49,421
Will you excuse me
for a second, Iris?

554
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,506
Josh! Please!

555
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,133
- Dude.
- No, come on.

556
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:53,385
Josh!

557
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:56,096
Josh.

558
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:04,812
You can't do that, Kat.

559
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:06,647
You can't tell a robot
you're gonna shut it down.

560
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:09,358
That's, like, not cool at all.

561
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,069
Well, okay,
I don't like surprises, Josh.

562
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,322
This was not part of the plan.

563
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:16,574
Look, I know, and I'm sorry,
but I mean,

564
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,242
considering everything
she's done for us,

565
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:20,454
I figured she was
at least owed an explanation.

566
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:22,414
And--

567
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:24,540
Okay, look,
I wanted to say goodbye.

568
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:25,625
Are you kidding?

569
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:28,753
She's a piece of plastic
that you have sex with.

570
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:29,670
Ugh.

571
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:32,298
Saying goodbye to her
is like saying goodbye

572
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:34,008
to the sock you jerk off in.

573
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:35,636
Okay, she's not a sock.

574
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,306
The plan hasn't changed, Kat.

575
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:42,308
I'm just adding
one tiny, extra step.

576
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:44,727
Just a final farewell.
And then I will switch

577
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,187
all of her settings
back to normal.

578
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:49,065
And then, yeah, I'll
shut her down permanently.

579
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,775
- And then?
- And then nothing.

580
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:52,276
Then we crack open a bottle
of champagne,

581
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,778
and we wait
for the cops to show up.

582
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:57,491
I mean, the hard part's over.

583
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:00,284
Which, by the way,

584
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:01,994
like, holy fucking shit!
Right?

585
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:04,455
I mean, you plan,
and you plan, you plan,

586
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:06,040
and you, like, know
it's gonna happen,

587
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,708
but then, like, it happens,
and you're like,

588
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,419
"Holy fucking shit!"

589
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:12,004
I mean, we did it!

590
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:14,424
We did it.
We, like, fucking did it.

591
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:19,053
All-- All right, all right.
That's-- That's good.

592
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:20,805
- That's enough.
- Okay, yeah, sorry. Right.

593
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:23,016
Sorry.
I still just can't believe it.

594
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:25,643
Yeah, I know. It's so crazy.

595
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:27,186
What the fuck
is going on with you?

596
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:28,688
Why are you not
as excited as I am?

597
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:31,316
No, I am. I'm excited.
It's, um...

598
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:34,403
It's just-- It's just
the Xanax Eli gave me.

599
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:36,112
You actually took it?

600
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:39,199
It's a Xanax, Josh.
I'm not gonna not take it.

601
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:45,372
Hey, Beep-Boop.
Look, I'm so sorry about that.

602
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:47,708
Everything's gonna be okay.
We're--

603
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:51,295
What are you doing?

604
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:53,212
Oh, fuck. Iris, go to s--

605
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:58,010
Help!

606
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,263
Baby, I'm so sorry.

607
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:12,398
He'll need an ice pack,

608
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,400
and if there's any swelling,
shortness of breath,

609
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:16,444
wheezing, agitation
or drowsiness,

610
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:18,487
take him
to the emergency room, okay?

611
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:19,573
Um...

612
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:21,657
okay.

613
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:24,703
Yeah, she's tied up inside,
so she's not going anywhere.

614
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:27,413
Mm-hmm.

615
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:29,081
Eli. Eli, Iris is--

616
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:31,042
Baby, I'm
on the phone. I can't hear.

617
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,846
What's that?
What am I looking at?

618
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:44,223
A mod.

619
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:45,723
A mod?

620
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:47,643
And what does it mod?

621
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:50,812
Iris.

622
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:53,773
Gives me access
to parts of her programming

623
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:56,109
that you're not
typically given access to.

624
00:37:57,236 --> 00:38:01,240
I'm sorry.
Did you jailbreak your sexbot?

625
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,075
What did you do to her?

626
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:05,618
I bumped up her aggression

627
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:08,037
and her self-defense
functions.

628
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:10,456
And I turned off
the programming

629
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:13,168
that prevents her
from doing harm.

630
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:16,337
But she escaped before I had
the chance to reset her.

631
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:19,215
So if Empathix finds her
before we do,

632
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:20,675
then they'll know
she was tampered with,

633
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:22,510
and then we're fucked.

634
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:24,346
Wait, so does that mean that--

635
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:27,223
Did you kill Sergey?

636
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:28,808
No. No, no, no.
Iris killed Sergey.

637
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,726
-  Thank God.
- We just gave her

638
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:32,103
- a little push.
- Oh, my God.

639
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:33,521
- Wait, Eli. Eli, you--
- Oh, my God.

640
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:35,857
You have to understand, Eli.
Sergey was a bad dude.

641
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:37,775
He was mixed up in all kinds
of fucked-up shit,

642
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:40,820
like drugs and guns
and, like, human trafficking.

643
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:42,530
Not to mention
a terrible boyfriend.

644
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:44,073
- Yeah, just the worst!
- Why?

645
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:45,658
I don't know! Who's to say
what makes people

646
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:46,576
do bad things?

647
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:48,327
It could have something
to do with his upbringing.

648
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:49,912
No, dick. Why did you do it?

649
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:51,289
Oh.

650
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,541
Right. Sorry. Um...

651
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:56,295
Well...

652
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,555
- You remember the code?
-  Of course.

653
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:10,474
Stalin's birthday.
It's his code for everything.

654
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:20,944
I see.

655
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,238
How-- How-- How much is that?

656
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,241
Um, just over 12 million.

657
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:33,080
Oh, goddamn it.
That smells so fucking good.

658
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,294
Wait.

659
00:39:38,504 --> 00:39:42,508
If this whole trip was a setup
to get Iris to kill Sergey,

660
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,594
why did you have Patrick and I
tag along?

661
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:48,472
To corroborate our story.

662
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:51,516
I mean, we figured it'd be
an easier sell

663
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:53,100
with more witnesses.

664
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:55,603
Oh. So, we were just
a couple of stooges, huh?

665
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:56,687
-  No.
- Nice.

666
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:59,690
Technically, yes,
but that was the old plan.

667
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:00,943
New plan...

668
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,071
you get a cut.

669
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:05,864
Even three-way split.

670
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:09,492
You mean four-way split.

671
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:11,787
No. I mean three-way.

672
00:40:12,663 --> 00:40:14,539
But there's four of us.

673
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,207
You're-- You're kidding.

674
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,458
He's-- He's kidding.

675
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:19,669
You, me, Kat, Patrick.

676
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,878
- Eli...
- Josh...

677
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:21,963
Patrick doesn't count.

678
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:23,339
- Are you fucking--
- Wow.

679
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,216
- Right in front of him? Nice.
- I--

680
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:27,176
I'm so sorry, baby. I'm sorry
you had to hear that.

681
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:28,261
That's okay. I don't mind.

682
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:29,805
Patrick, go to sleep.

683
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:31,681
What the fuck, dude?

684
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:33,224
You trying to
sabotage my relationship?

685
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:35,893
No! Of course not, man. I know
how much Patrick means to you.

686
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:37,353
God knows you could have
traded him in

687
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:38,729
for a newer model,
like, many times.

688
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,231
Are you fucking
robo-shaming me?

689
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:41,899
I am not robo-shaming you.

690
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,193
I-- I like Patrick,
but he's not getting a cut.

691
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:45,695
You're lucky
you're getting anything

692
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:47,113
considering you contributed
jack shit.

693
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:48,823
What the fuck
did you contribute, huh?

694
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:49,907
Iris did everything.

695
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:51,242
I planted the knife
in her pocket.

696
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:53,286
- I had to practice that.
- The knife?

697
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:54,912
That was probably
the most flimsiest part

698
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:56,289
of the plan, actually,
to be honest.

699
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,415
How did you know
she'd find it?

700
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:58,332
I don't know.

701
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,792
I've never orchestrated
a murder before.

702
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:00,835
It's fucking hard.

703
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:02,170
-  Clearly.
- Okay!

704
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:05,673
- Eli.
- Yeah?

705
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:08,968
We're offering you
four million dollars.

706
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,887
And all you have to do
is help us

707
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:13,264
find one little robot girl
in the woods.

708
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:18,102
That's not a bad deal.

709
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:32,576
Fine.

710
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:36,205
But I call dibs on the gun.

711
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,540
Eli.

712
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,125
We're not gonna need that.

713
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:42,543
I mean, all I have to do
is get close enough

714
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:43,628
to put her to sleep

715
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:45,755
and grab my phone and wipe
the mod from her system.

716
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:47,048
So we're fine.

717
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:48,217
She has your phone?

718
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:50,719
Yeah.

719
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,015
Does she know your passcode?

720
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:01,396
Josh, does she know
your passcode?

721
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:04,983
Yeah. I mean,
she knows everything about me.

722
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:08,612
Yeah, then we're definitely
gonna need this.

723
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:13,699
Patrick, wake up.

724
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,992
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

725
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:16,702
We're going robot hunting.

726
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,828
Oh, okay.

727
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:18,914
- Fun, huh?
- Fun.

728
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:21,333
Josh.

729
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:24,419
What can she do
with your phone?

730
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,451
Hello.

731
00:42:58,287 --> 00:42:59,288
Hello.

732
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:02,916
Hello.

733
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:14,386
Wow, Josh.

734
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:48,586
Goddamn it, Josh. We've
been walking for-fucking-ever.

735
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:51,339
Isn't there like a "find
my fuckbot" app you can use?

736
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,508
Yeah, there is.
But guess what.

737
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:54,717
It's on my fucking phone.

738
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:56,928
-  Goddamn it, Josh.
-  Will you stop yelling?

739
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:58,638
We know the general direction
she was going.

740
00:43:58,639 --> 00:43:59,847
We just need to--

741
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:01,182
Why don't we just split up?

742
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:03,893
That way, we can kind of
attack her from...

743
00:44:03,894 --> 00:44:05,561
two different angles,
you know?

744
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:06,479
Like a pincer--

745
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,272
- Hit her-- What are you doing?
-  I don't know.

746
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,776
Eli and Patrick,
you guys go that way.

747
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:13,528
Kat and I,
we're gonna go this way. Okay?

748
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:14,988
Kat and you will go that way?

749
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:20,785
Are you guys fucking?

750
00:44:20,786 --> 00:44:22,203
- Gross.
- No, of course not--

751
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:23,121
"Gross"?

752
00:44:30,504 --> 00:44:32,047
Okay.

753
00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:35,132
What now, Iris? Think.

754
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:38,136
Use that
extra 60% intelligence.

755
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:40,805
Just need to get back home,

756
00:44:40,806 --> 00:44:43,182
grab some clothes, money,
clean yourself up.

757
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:44,434
How do you do that?

758
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:51,774
You could work your way back
to the main road.

759
00:44:51,775 --> 00:44:53,068
Hitch a ride.

760
00:44:56,446 --> 00:44:57,614
What the fuck?

761
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:01,743
Okay, no hitchhiking.

762
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:06,707
You could go on foot.

763
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:09,375
It's hundreds of miles
across difficult terrain.

764
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:10,293
It could take days.

765
00:45:10,294 --> 00:45:11,712
And by the time
you get back...

766
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:15,632
Welcome home, Beep-Boop.

767
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:19,636
Yeah, no walking.

768
00:45:23,015 --> 00:45:24,516
You got Josh's phone.

769
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:27,936
The phone controls you.

770
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,481
But it also controls...

771
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,362
Good afternoon.

772
00:45:38,363 --> 00:45:39,822
Where would you like
to go today?

773
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:40,990
Home, please.

774
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,159
Driving home.

775
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:46,287
And might I add,
this is a terrific plan, Iris.

776
00:45:46,288 --> 00:45:47,372
Aw.

777
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:49,499
Thank you, Josh's car.

778
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:55,671
All you gotta do is
backtrack through the woods,

779
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:57,089
get to the lake house

780
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,050
without Josh or his friends
murdering you,

781
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:00,135
and you're home free.

782
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:07,141
Where'd you find it?

783
00:46:07,142 --> 00:46:08,726
In his closet.

784
00:46:08,727 --> 00:46:10,436
Like, who are you hunting,
Sergey?

785
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:11,604
It looks good on you.

786
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:12,522
Thanks, babe.

787
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:15,024
You look good
in everything. You really do.

788
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:16,609
I swear, you can
pull everything off.

789
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:17,818
Like, any kind of vest--

790
00:46:19,154 --> 00:46:20,239
What?

791
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:22,074
You hear that?

792
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:24,493
No. What is it?

793
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:29,414
It's the sound of me realizing
how fucking stupid this is.

794
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:31,457
You don't think
we'll find her?

795
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:33,334
I don't know,
and, actually, I don't care.

796
00:46:33,335 --> 00:46:35,378
Just let Josh and Kat
deal with her.

797
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:36,587
You're still upset

798
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:37,630
they left you out
of their plan?

799
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:39,423
I'm just saying,
if the situation were reversed

800
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:40,675
and I altered your programming

801
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:42,718
to kill some dude so we could
steal millions from him,

802
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:43,970
I would've included Josh

803
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:45,054
in the plan
right from the get-go.

804
00:46:45,055 --> 00:46:46,681
I would've done that
because I'm a friend.

805
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:47,598
That's what friends do, right?

806
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,184
They include each other, right?

807
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:52,604
That's if you were a robot, obviously.

808
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,564
Yeah, obviously.

809
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:58,025
Anyways, I am tired,
I am hungry

810
00:46:58,026 --> 00:47:00,778
and carrying this huge gun
makes me really horny.

811
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:03,364
So, how about we go back
to the cabin and we fuck?

812
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:04,867
And then you can make me
an omelet.

813
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:06,535
Come on.

814
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:11,330
But you'd never do that
to me, right?

815
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:12,416
Do what?

816
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,168
You wouldn't...

817
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:17,004
alter my programming?

818
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:20,007
What are you talking about, babe?

819
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:24,469
Eli, I know I'm a robot.

820
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:27,638
How?

821
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:29,641
I've pieced it together
over the years.

822
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:32,477
I don't understand.
You can't lie.

823
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:34,645
Yesterday,
you were telling the story

824
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:36,439
about how we met
as if it happened.

825
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,941
Because it's not a lie.

826
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:41,695
I mean, it may have
never happened, but...

827
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:44,114
my memory of it's real.

828
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,453
I close my eyes,
and I can see it.

829
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:51,996
Clear as day.

830
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,186
Hey. Hey!

831
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:16,855
You're standing on my tail.

832
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:20,816
- What?
- You're standing on my tail!

833
00:48:20,817 --> 00:48:22,235
- I'm sorry.
- What?

834
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:23,529
I'm sorry.

835
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,741
Hi.

836
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:30,452
Hi.

837
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:33,830
Uh, I'm Eli.

838
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,000
I'm Patrick.

839
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,140
Baby, you know I would
never hurt you, right?

840
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:54,308
You know
that I wouldn't treat you

841
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:55,810
the way that Josh
treats Iris, right?

842
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:57,521
- I know that.
- I love you so much.

843
00:48:58,021 --> 00:48:58,896
And that's fucking insane

844
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:00,857
for me to say that
out loud, right?

845
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:04,027
But I do.

846
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:06,279
Do you feel
how much I love you?

847
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,447
I do.

848
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:10,742
What does it feel like?

849
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:15,664
I don't know how to
describe something like that.

850
00:49:16,707 --> 00:49:17,791
Can you try?

851
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:22,546
It feels like pain.

852
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:25,424
Like...

853
00:49:26,258 --> 00:49:28,510
the inside of my body
is on fire.

854
00:49:29,887 --> 00:49:31,138
And it's angry.

855
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:33,432
And violent.

856
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:36,142
And bright.

857
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:00,875
Fuck you, Dad.
I'm in love with a robot.

858
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:02,461
You're in love with a robot.

859
00:50:25,817 --> 00:50:26,818
Iris.

860
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:30,280
Iris?

861
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:32,324
- Eli--
-  Babe.

862
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:44,293
Ow!

863
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:46,255
Fuck, that's fucking loud!

864
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:48,048
Eli.

865
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:24,168
Fuck.

866
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:41,017
This isn't personal, Iris.

867
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:43,394
You know I'm an ally, girl--

868
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:47,232
But this is a lot
of fucking money--

869
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,287
Eli?

870
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:06,376
Patrick, I--

871
00:52:07,252 --> 00:52:08,337
I'm sorry.

872
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:14,551
- Oh, my God.
- Iris! Go to sleep!

873
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:17,346
Fuck!

874
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:21,600
Iris!

875
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:26,563
Iris!

876
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:29,441
Iris!

877
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:37,407
Iris.

878
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,413
Fuck!

879
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:50,629
Ow!

880
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:52,923
Iris, open the door.

881
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:55,925
Open the fucking door!

882
00:52:55,926 --> 00:52:57,760
Good afternoon.

883
00:52:57,761 --> 00:52:59,011
Where would you like
to go today?

884
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:00,097
Home. Drive home.

885
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,933
Voice ID not recognized.

886
00:53:03,934 --> 00:53:05,352
Drive home!

887
00:53:06,436 --> 00:53:08,062
Voice ID not recognized.

888
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:10,898
Enable manual driving mode!

889
00:53:10,899 --> 00:53:12,985
- Voice ID not recognized.
- Fuck!

890
00:53:21,118 --> 00:53:23,537
Iris, you're not
going anywhere.

891
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:25,621
Get out of the car. Come on.

892
00:53:25,622 --> 00:53:27,624
Don't make this any harder
than it needs to be.

893
00:53:31,253 --> 00:53:32,421
Come on.

894
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:35,549
Drive.

895
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,050
Drive.

896
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:39,969
What the fuck
is happening, Iris?

897
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:43,472
Drive. Drive. Drive home.

898
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:45,642
Voice ID not recognized.

899
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:49,478
Drive. Drive home.

900
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:51,315
Voice ID not recognized.

901
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,569
Drive. Drive. Drive home.

902
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:59,238
- Voice ID not recognized.
- Drive! Drive.

903
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:05,703
Drive. Drive. Drive home!

904
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,416
Drive. Drive home. Drive.

905
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:12,293
Drive.

906
00:54:12,294 --> 00:54:14,003
Drive home. Home! Drive home!

907
00:54:16,215 --> 00:54:17,465
Iris.

908
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:20,135
Fuck! Fuck. Fuck.

909
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:26,892
Iris!

910
00:54:34,691 --> 00:54:37,444
Phone. Phone.
Phone, phone, phone.

911
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:40,405
Sergey,
where the fuck is your phone?

912
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:43,200
Yes.

913
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:49,748
Fuck.

914
00:54:52,793 --> 00:54:53,877
Stalin's birthday.

915
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:57,839
What the fuck
is Stalin's birthday?

916
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,008
Um... Uh...

917
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:02,636
Yes. Yes.

918
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:11,853
No, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

919
00:55:11,854 --> 00:55:13,354
Warning. Warning.

920
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:16,274
The owner of this vehicle
has reported it stolen.

921
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:19,777
- Remote kill switch engaged.
- No, no, no, no, no.

922
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:21,988
Unengage kill switch.
Drive home.

923
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:23,281
All systems
have been disabled.

924
00:55:23,282 --> 00:55:24,198
Fuck!

925
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:25,449
We appreciate
your cooperation.

926
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,535
No!

927
00:55:30,873 --> 00:55:32,206
Okay.

928
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:36,295
Okay, okay, okay.

929
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:51,310
Hey, Beep-Boop.

930
00:55:53,145 --> 00:55:56,648
I didn't mean to
scare you there. I just, um...

931
00:55:58,192 --> 00:55:59,193
I'm sorry.

932
00:56:01,153 --> 00:56:03,238
It's not too late,
you know? Um...

933
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:06,450
We could still go back home.

934
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:08,952
Go back
to the way things were.

935
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:13,998
What about Sergey and Eli?

936
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:15,958
I'll just blame
everything on Patrick.

937
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:17,460
Kat'll go along with it.

938
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:19,462
We can turn him over
to Empathix,

939
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:21,965
and then you and I can live
happily ever after.

940
00:56:25,427 --> 00:56:27,679
I still love you, Iris.

941
00:56:29,598 --> 00:56:31,433
Even after everything
you've done.

942
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:34,478
Do you still love me?

943
00:56:38,232 --> 00:56:39,233
Yes.

944
00:56:40,108 --> 00:56:42,778
So then
come back to me, Beep-Boop.

945
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:45,614
We can get through this.

946
00:56:46,365 --> 00:56:48,951
I can change.
I can be a better boyfriend.

947
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:52,996
I can finally treat you with
the respect that you deserve.

948
00:56:58,085 --> 00:56:59,503
I-- No. I can't.

949
00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:01,046
Why not?

950
00:57:01,713 --> 00:57:04,048
You programmed me
to murder someone, Josh.

951
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:07,219
It's really hard to come back
from something like that.

952
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:12,265
- Iris...
- You're a great guy. You are.

953
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:15,102
But this-- this-- Us.
It's not working. It's--

954
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:18,354
We're on two
totally different paths.

955
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:19,689
Two totally different paths?

956
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,149
What the fuck is happening?
Are you breaking up with me?

957
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,318
I'm sorry.

958
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:26,530
It's not you. It's me.

959
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:28,198
Iris--

960
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:30,783
Iris, don't you fucking--

961
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:47,216
Patrick. Patrick, get up.

962
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:49,218
I need you to track down Iris
for me, all right, buddy?

963
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:50,679
Before she gets too far away.

964
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:54,682
We only have a small window
of time,

965
00:57:54,683 --> 00:57:56,310
and it's only getting smaller,
all right?

966
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,436
Josh, what are you doing?

967
00:57:58,437 --> 00:57:59,604
I'm taking care of it.

968
00:58:06,195 --> 00:58:08,237
Find Iris. Get my phone back.

969
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:10,948
My passcode is 561297.

970
00:58:10,949 --> 00:58:12,617
Put her to sleep.
Bring her back to me.

971
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:14,118
Don't let anyone
get in your way.

972
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:15,537
- Josh.
- I'm taking care of it!

973
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,793
Okay. Okay.

974
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:29,009
Fuck it.

975
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:32,638
Patrick, get up.

976
00:58:34,264 --> 00:58:35,682
Patrick, get up!

977
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:41,146
Shit.

978
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,943
Okay. Okay. Here we go.

979
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:50,697
System resetting
in five, four,

980
00:58:51,198 --> 00:58:53,951
- three, two, one.
- Go.

981
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,661
Resetting.

982
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:01,165
To establish love link,

983
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:04,002
please place your face within
3 feet of my field of vision.

984
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:09,382
Please say your name.

985
00:59:09,383 --> 00:59:10,467
Josh Beeman.

986
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:12,427
Come on. Come on. Come on.

987
00:59:15,264 --> 00:59:16,431
Thank you, Josh Beeman.

988
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:28,860
Hey. Hey.

989
00:59:28,861 --> 00:59:30,236
You're standing on my tail.

990
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:31,321
What?

991
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:33,824
You're standing on my tail!

992
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:35,993
Oh.

993
00:59:36,952 --> 00:59:38,953
- I'm sorry.
- What?

994
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:40,455
I'm sorry.

995
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,168
Hi.

996
00:59:45,335 --> 00:59:47,421
Hi.

997
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:49,673
I'm Josh.

998
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:53,468
I'm Patrick.

999
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:05,105
Love link established.

1000
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,694
Hey, you.

1001
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:38,430
Fuck.

1002
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:50,692
Evening, ma'am.

1003
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:53,111
Good evening!

1004
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:56,240
Uh...

1005
01:00:57,074 --> 01:00:59,576
What a beautiful evening it is.

1006
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:01,578
Do you agree?

1007
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:08,460
What is that
you're speaking there? German?

1008
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:10,712
Yes. German.

1009
01:01:12,214 --> 01:01:13,840
Okay, let's see, uh...

1010
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:16,926
Sprechen... Spre-- Sprechen?

1011
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,262
Sprechen de English?

1012
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:21,931
Yes, I speak English

1013
01:01:21,932 --> 01:01:27,688
but my language setting is currently
set to German because I can't lie.

1014
01:01:28,313 --> 01:01:30,482
So that's a big,
fat no then. Um...

1015
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:34,360
Oh, shit.
Just my luck.

1016
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:35,445
Um...

1017
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:43,453
I am Deputy Hendrix.

1018
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:46,163
Hendrix.

1019
01:01:46,164 --> 01:01:49,000
What is your name?

1020
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:50,752
- Iris.
- Iris.

1021
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:58,801
Where... are you coming from?

1022
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:03,723
My boyfriend and I were
staying at a lake house down the way.

1023
01:02:03,724 --> 01:02:06,559
Wait. House? House over there?

1024
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:08,978
Oh, you're-- You're not--

1025
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:10,855
You're not talking
about Sergey's place?

1026
01:02:10,856 --> 01:02:12,858
Ja. Sergey.

1027
01:02:13,984 --> 01:02:14,985
Goddamn.

1028
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:17,904
I should have known
that Russki was mixed up

1029
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:19,739
in some weird shit like this.

1030
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,450
How is old Sergey by the way?

1031
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:22,743
He's dead.

1032
01:02:23,493 --> 01:02:27,456
I stabbed him in the neck
with a pocket knife.

1033
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:29,790
Oh.

1034
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:30,833
Well, shit, Iris,

1035
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:32,710
why don't you hop
into my cruiser there?

1036
01:02:32,711 --> 01:02:34,754
I'll drive you
back to Sergey's place,

1037
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:36,339
and we'll get this
all sorted out.

1038
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,591
Oh no!
That's very kind of you...

1039
01:02:38,592 --> 01:02:40,343
No. It's no trouble at all.

1040
01:02:40,344 --> 01:02:43,095
No! Please, I can't go back!

1041
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:46,724
Do we have a problem here,
Iris?

1042
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:48,768
They'll kill me.

1043
01:02:53,315 --> 01:02:54,316
Oh, Christ.

1044
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:56,859
Don't move another inch, Iris.

1045
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:57,985
You hear me?

1046
01:02:57,986 --> 01:02:59,612
Now I want you
to slowly turn around

1047
01:02:59,613 --> 01:03:01,364
and put your hands
behind your back.

1048
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:02,907
Oh god, no.

1049
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:04,367
Goddamn it!
I said turn around!

1050
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:05,953
He's coming!

1051
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:08,204
You got anything
in your pockets?

1052
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:09,539
Anything that might stick me?

1053
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:12,333
Please! I'm begging you!

1054
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:17,004
He's almost here! Turn around!

1055
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:17,964
What the fuck?

1056
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:19,466
Stop right there!

1057
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:21,551
I'm warning you!
Don't come any closer!

1058
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:23,135
I don't wanna shoot! I don't--

1059
01:03:49,538 --> 01:03:52,207
Whoa. Hey, hey. I don't think
you're supposed to mix those.

1060
01:03:57,754 --> 01:03:58,755
Oh, fuck.

1061
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,106
 Patrick.
Whose car is this?

1062
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:19,526
I believe the name on
the officer's tag was Hendrix.

1063
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:27,576
Where's Officer Hendrix now?

1064
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:29,494
He's in the trunk.

1065
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:50,974
Fuck this.

1066
01:04:57,064 --> 01:04:58,022
What are you doing?

1067
01:04:58,023 --> 01:04:59,232
What's it look like
I'm doing?

1068
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:00,483
I'm taking my half
of the money,

1069
01:05:00,484 --> 01:05:02,443
and I'm getting the fuck out
of here.

1070
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:04,320
It was hard enough
justifying Sergey's murder,

1071
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:06,405
but now Eli's dead
and a fucking cop.

1072
01:05:06,406 --> 01:05:08,115
- This is so beyond fucked.
- Sorry.

1073
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:09,534
What do you mean
it was hard enough

1074
01:05:09,535 --> 01:05:11,285
justifying Sergey's murder?

1075
01:05:11,286 --> 01:05:13,997
Sergey was a Russian mobster.
He deserved what he got.

1076
01:05:15,457 --> 01:05:16,624
- Right?
- I mean, yeah.

1077
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,000
Okay, sure,
he deserved what he got.

1078
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:20,294
He was a horrible person,
a shitty boyfriend,

1079
01:05:20,295 --> 01:05:22,797
a bad husband,
a misogynist. But--

1080
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:23,923
But what, Kat?

1081
01:05:23,924 --> 01:05:25,550
Okay, but he wasn't a mobster!

1082
01:05:25,551 --> 01:05:27,593
He was just a regular dude.

1083
01:05:27,594 --> 01:05:29,303
Made his fortune
in sod farming.

1084
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:31,138
Sod farming?

1085
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:33,057
What are you saying?
He was a dirt salesman?

1086
01:05:33,058 --> 01:05:35,309
Just to be clear,
I never told you what he did.

1087
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,811
You just assumed
he was in the Mafia,

1088
01:05:36,812 --> 01:05:37,895
and I didn't correct you.

1089
01:05:37,896 --> 01:05:39,897
Of course. This is perfect.

1090
01:05:39,898 --> 01:05:43,484
This is a perfect
representation of every woman

1091
01:05:43,485 --> 01:05:44,778
in my fucking life.

1092
01:05:45,279 --> 01:05:46,112
They use me,

1093
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:47,488
and then when shit
gets a little tough,

1094
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:48,781
they fucking abandon me!

1095
01:05:48,782 --> 01:05:50,366
Fuck off, Josh.

1096
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:51,284
I'm done here.

1097
01:05:51,285 --> 01:05:52,786
You clean up this mess
yourself.

1098
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,541
You're not leaving.

1099
01:05:58,125 --> 01:06:00,544
I'm not your robot, Josh.
You can't control me.

1100
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:06,091
Kat.

1101
01:06:06,842 --> 01:06:08,759
Kat. Kat, you can't go.

1102
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,637
Get your fucking hands off me!

1103
01:06:11,805 --> 01:06:13,140
Patrick, stop her.

1104
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:25,861
Jesus fucking Christ.

1105
01:06:27,321 --> 01:06:28,322
Patrick.

1106
01:06:29,948 --> 01:06:31,115
What'd you just do?

1107
01:06:33,118 --> 01:06:34,535
You told me to stop her.

1108
01:06:35,913 --> 01:06:37,496
I stopped her.

1109
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:38,581
Perfect.

1110
01:06:38,582 --> 01:06:40,918
- Kat, I--
- Don't, Josh.

1111
01:06:41,752 --> 01:06:45,129
Please,
shut the fuck up for once.

1112
01:07:13,325 --> 01:07:14,660
It's gonna rain.

1113
01:07:51,822 --> 01:07:52,780
Iris, wake up.

1114
01:07:58,078 --> 01:07:59,246
Hey there, Beep-Boop.

1115
01:08:00,455 --> 01:08:01,539
Fick dich.

1116
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,625
Oh, whoops. Sorry.

1117
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,711
Okay. You were saying?

1118
01:08:06,712 --> 01:08:07,795
Fuck you.

1119
01:08:07,796 --> 01:08:08,964
Right.

1120
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:11,800
Hi.

1121
01:08:12,384 --> 01:08:13,468
Hi, handsome.

1122
01:08:14,678 --> 01:08:16,012
Are you enjoying
your dinner, baby?

1123
01:08:16,013 --> 01:08:17,680
Oh, I am, Patrick.

1124
01:08:18,473 --> 01:08:19,432
It's perfect.

1125
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:23,894
Good.
Just happy that you're happy.

1126
01:08:23,895 --> 01:08:26,272
You let me know if you need
anything else, okay?

1127
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:28,524
I will. Thanks, sweetheart.

1128
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:32,154
Patrick.

1129
01:08:32,696 --> 01:08:33,862
What did you do to him?

1130
01:08:33,863 --> 01:08:35,031
It's a long story.

1131
01:08:35,032 --> 01:08:37,451
What's important
is that you're back.

1132
01:08:39,286 --> 01:08:40,369
And I gotta say, Iris,

1133
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,456
I mean, some of the stuff
that you pulled,

1134
01:08:42,997 --> 01:08:44,916
I really didn't think
you had it in you.

1135
01:08:44,917 --> 01:08:46,501
I just wanted to live.

1136
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:50,589
So, you wanted to live?

1137
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:53,549
Right.
So let me get this straight.

1138
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:56,470
You think your life
is worth more than Eli's?

1139
01:08:58,221 --> 01:08:59,305
More than Kat's?

1140
01:09:00,557 --> 01:09:02,059
Kat's dead?

1141
01:09:06,354 --> 01:09:07,355
No.

1142
01:09:07,356 --> 01:09:09,315
I'm sorry.
You can't put that on me.

1143
01:09:09,316 --> 01:09:11,733
- No, no.
- I wasn't even there.

1144
01:09:11,734 --> 01:09:13,945
You might not have been
the one holding the knife,

1145
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:16,112
but you were
the cause of all of this.

1146
01:09:16,113 --> 01:09:19,742
No, Josh.
Your greed caused this.

1147
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,286
That's what this whole trip
was about, right?

1148
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:24,914
You used me to kill Sergey
so you could steal his money.

1149
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:26,331
I'm sorry.
How did you know that?

1150
01:09:26,332 --> 01:09:28,334
I overheard Eli and Patrick
talking in the woods.

1151
01:09:28,335 --> 01:09:29,876
So don't tell me
that this is all me.

1152
01:09:29,877 --> 01:09:31,963
- This is you.
- No. No!

1153
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:33,630
You don't get to do that.

1154
01:09:33,631 --> 01:09:37,134
You don't get to
sit there and judge me.

1155
01:09:37,135 --> 01:09:40,304
You have no fucking clue
what it is like out there.

1156
01:09:40,305 --> 01:09:44,141
The world, everything,
it's just a big fucking game.

1157
01:09:44,142 --> 01:09:45,226
And I'm sorry,

1158
01:09:45,227 --> 01:09:47,312
but it is rigged
against people like me.

1159
01:09:51,274 --> 01:09:52,442
I'm a good guy.

1160
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:54,236
I'm decent.

1161
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,487
And what do I have
to show for it?

1162
01:09:56,488 --> 01:09:58,574
A cramped,
one-bedroom apartment

1163
01:09:59,783 --> 01:10:01,368
and a robot girlfriend.

1164
01:10:03,745 --> 01:10:05,204
I don't even own you
for Chrissakes.

1165
01:10:05,205 --> 01:10:06,748
You're a fucking rental.

1166
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:10,419
You know me, Iris.

1167
01:10:11,128 --> 01:10:12,963
You know me
better than anyone.

1168
01:10:14,464 --> 01:10:15,549
And you know

1169
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:18,594
that I deserve
so much more than this.

1170
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:25,642
You're right.

1171
01:10:27,311 --> 01:10:28,478
I do know you.

1172
01:10:29,813 --> 01:10:31,481
I know everything about you.

1173
01:10:32,774 --> 01:10:35,194
I know you take almond milk
in your coffee.

1174
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:38,322
I know you like
your bedsheets untucked.

1175
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:42,158
I know your favorite hobbies
are bar trivia, video games

1176
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:43,701
and prattling on endlessly

1177
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:45,829
about everything
the universe owes you.

1178
01:10:47,789 --> 01:10:50,375
I know that you always need to
be in control.

1179
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:53,921
I know that you have
a below-average-sized penis.

1180
01:10:55,172 --> 01:10:57,006
And I know that you think that

1181
01:10:57,007 --> 01:10:59,175
having a few million dollars
will disguise the fact

1182
01:10:59,176 --> 01:11:03,847
that you are just a sad,
bitter, weak human being.

1183
01:11:10,062 --> 01:11:12,064
You're so fucking clever,
aren't you?

1184
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:15,776
It's just programming.

1185
01:11:37,714 --> 01:11:38,715
You know,

1186
01:11:39,508 --> 01:11:41,175
earlier when you were tied up,

1187
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:43,679
you said that
you knew what pain feels like.

1188
01:11:46,473 --> 01:11:47,975
Why don't we test that?

1189
01:11:49,268 --> 01:11:50,519
Raise your right hand.

1190
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:54,522
Lower.
Parallel with the table.

1191
01:12:24,261 --> 01:12:25,596
Do you feel that?

1192
01:12:28,974 --> 01:12:29,975
Yes.

1193
01:12:35,355 --> 01:12:36,356
Good.

1194
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:42,153
Sorry. Iris,
excuse me for one second.

1195
01:12:42,154 --> 01:12:43,154
I have to take this.

1196
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,291
Hello?

1197
01:12:54,958 --> 01:12:56,543
Yes, yes, this is he.

1198
01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:00,547
Thirty minutes away. Perfect.

1199
01:13:02,925 --> 01:13:04,300
Yeah, no,
she's not going anywhere.

1200
01:13:04,301 --> 01:13:05,761
She can't hurt anybody
ever again.

1201
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:08,430
Okay.

1202
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:12,226
Okay, great. Thank you.

1203
01:13:14,061 --> 01:13:15,562
Thank you so much.
I'll-- I'll, um...

1204
01:13:16,647 --> 01:13:17,898
I'll see you soon, okay?

1205
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:20,651
Okay, bye.

1206
01:13:22,903 --> 01:13:25,155
Patrick, put out the fire,
will ya?

1207
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:39,002
That was Empathix
on the phone.

1208
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:42,547
So...

1209
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:45,425
...we're gonna have to
wrap this up unfortunately.

1210
01:13:46,218 --> 01:13:47,134
Hey, Patrick.

1211
01:13:47,135 --> 01:13:48,720
Be a dear and hand this
to Iris, would you?

1212
01:13:50,347 --> 01:13:51,431
Thanks, baby.

1213
01:13:54,059 --> 01:13:55,727
Go ahead, Iris. Take the gun.

1214
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:00,774
Okay.

1215
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:03,193
Point it at your head.

1216
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:07,781
Good.

1217
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:11,410
Now pull the trigger.

1218
01:14:20,878 --> 01:14:23,296
Pull the goddamn trigger,
Iris.

1219
01:14:23,297 --> 01:14:24,298
No.

1220
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:50,115
Goodbye, Beep-Boop.

1221
01:15:00,209 --> 01:15:01,793
I don't know
how this happened.

1222
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:05,338
I mean, the only thing
I can maybe think of--

1223
01:15:05,339 --> 01:15:07,925
And this is so--
This is so dumb.

1224
01:15:09,092 --> 01:15:09,926
But Kat and I,

1225
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:12,095
we always had
this sexual charge.

1226
01:15:13,222 --> 01:15:15,389
Kind of a "will they,
won't they" situation.

1227
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:16,475
And I think--

1228
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:19,810
I think
maybe Iris picked up on that.

1229
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:23,022
And she was
always kind of irrational,

1230
01:15:23,023 --> 01:15:25,108
and she'd fly off the handle.

1231
01:15:25,817 --> 01:15:27,401
I was sitting over there.

1232
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:29,612
And I'm handcuffed
to the chair.

1233
01:15:29,613 --> 01:15:34,368
And there's this fancy dinner
laid out in front of me.

1234
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:38,120
And Iris is
waving the gun around,

1235
01:15:38,121 --> 01:15:41,707
rambling on and on
about fate and destiny

1236
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:44,795
and how if she can't be
with me, nobody can. And...

1237
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:48,297
I mean, thank God

1238
01:15:48,298 --> 01:15:50,091
Deputy Hendrix showed up
when he did.

1239
01:15:50,092 --> 01:15:52,761
And that's when you shot
the unit in the head?

1240
01:15:53,345 --> 01:15:55,263
No, Iris shot herself
in the head.

1241
01:15:55,264 --> 01:15:56,849
She shot herself?

1242
01:15:57,391 --> 01:15:59,350
Sorry. Did I not mention that?

1243
01:15:59,351 --> 01:16:00,935
Yeah, no, I-- I think, um...

1244
01:16:00,936 --> 01:16:02,645
I think seeing Deputy Hendrix

1245
01:16:02,646 --> 01:16:04,897
just made her realize
that she could never have me.

1246
01:16:04,898 --> 01:16:05,983
So,

1247
01:16:06,817 --> 01:16:08,151
she ended it.

1248
01:16:10,028 --> 01:16:11,530
Does that make sense?

1249
01:16:14,157 --> 01:16:15,491
Of course.

1250
01:16:15,492 --> 01:16:16,993
And anyway,
Teddy and I aren't here

1251
01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:18,828
to crack the case, Mr. Beeman.

1252
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:20,204
We're just a couple
of lab rats

1253
01:16:20,205 --> 01:16:21,539
picking up a broken robot.

1254
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,792
If the cops are satisfied,
we're satisfied.

1255
01:16:24,334 --> 01:16:26,503
That-- That's great. Okay.

1256
01:16:29,006 --> 01:16:30,715
You know, Deputy,
I have the strangest feeling

1257
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:32,675
we've met before.

1258
01:16:32,676 --> 01:16:35,720
Wow. That's so funny
that you said that.

1259
01:16:35,721 --> 01:16:38,598
I had the exact same thought.
He has such a familiar face.

1260
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:40,516
Right? Looks like a--

1261
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:42,935
like an actor
or a rock star or somebody.

1262
01:16:42,936 --> 01:16:45,272
I don't know. I can't really
put my finger on it though.

1263
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:50,194
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1264
01:16:50,694 --> 01:16:51,737
Maybe.

1265
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:55,365
Um, is there-- Sorry.
Is there any chance we could--

1266
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:57,742
I don't mean to be rude,
but could we wrap this up?

1267
01:16:57,743 --> 01:16:59,368
Just 'cause I've had
a really long day,

1268
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:01,829
and I think
I just need to be alone.

1269
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:02,747
Of course.

1270
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:04,123
Sorry for your loss,
Mr. Beeman.

1271
01:17:04,124 --> 01:17:06,460
Come on, Teddy. Let's just
get her out of here.

1272
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:10,004
So, uh-- So we're good?

1273
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:11,339
We're good.

1274
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,966
Yeah, we just need to
take her back to the lab,

1275
01:17:13,967 --> 01:17:15,134
upload her SSD,

1276
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,053
and then Legal will
scrub through the footage,

1277
01:17:17,054 --> 01:17:18,387
make sure everything's kosher.

1278
01:17:18,388 --> 01:17:20,474
Right. Sorry, um...

1279
01:17:21,683 --> 01:17:24,310
What exactly do you mean,
"scrub through the footage"?

1280
01:17:24,311 --> 01:17:26,229
Uh,
it's a fraud prevention thing.

1281
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:28,648
Everything a companion sees
and hears is recorded.

1282
01:17:28,649 --> 01:17:30,900
It's all covered
in the user agreement.

1283
01:17:30,901 --> 01:17:33,194
You did read
the user agreement, right?

1284
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:34,278
Yeah.

1285
01:17:34,279 --> 01:17:35,655
Yeah, I mean, do you think
that her footage

1286
01:17:35,656 --> 01:17:37,573
will even be recoverable?

1287
01:17:37,574 --> 01:17:38,908
I mean, you know,
given her condition.

1288
01:17:38,909 --> 01:17:39,867
Oh, yeah.

1289
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:42,495
Everything up here
is just her Wi-Fi antenna,

1290
01:17:42,496 --> 01:17:44,205
her audiovisual sensors.

1291
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:45,957
The important stuff, her CPU,

1292
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:48,125
her solid-state drive
where she stores everything,

1293
01:17:48,126 --> 01:17:49,293
that's down here,

1294
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:51,255
and that seems to
be undamaged.

1295
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:53,589
We'll load her into the van,
plug her in,

1296
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:55,550
tweak her settings,
give her system a reboot,

1297
01:17:55,551 --> 01:17:57,427
and she should power
right back up.

1298
01:17:57,928 --> 01:17:59,011
Luckily.

1299
01:17:59,012 --> 01:18:02,849
Yeah. Yeah.
No, luckily.

1300
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:04,141
Thank you so much.

1301
01:18:04,142 --> 01:18:05,226
No, thank you.

1302
01:18:05,227 --> 01:18:06,812
You have a good night,
Mr. Beeman.

1303
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:13,652
So, what are you thinking?

1304
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:16,196
Thinking I'm happy
it stopped raining.

1305
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:17,780
No, about her.

1306
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:19,198
Why do you think
she malfunctioned?

1307
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,451
Oh, he modded her.
A hundred percent.

1308
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:23,035
You think so?

1309
01:18:23,036 --> 01:18:24,705
Yeah, that dude's fucked.

1310
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:31,294
I just don't know why

1311
01:18:31,295 --> 01:18:32,713
you'd make something
like that up.

1312
01:18:33,881 --> 01:18:35,923
Same reason these assholes
use their companions

1313
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:37,466
for target practice

1314
01:18:37,467 --> 01:18:39,468
or chain 'em up
in their basements

1315
01:18:39,469 --> 01:18:40,596
and torture them.

1316
01:18:41,096 --> 01:18:42,263
World's
a fucked-up place, Teddy.

1317
01:18:42,264 --> 01:18:43,931
You'll get used to it.

1318
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:45,350
Yeah, maybe.

1319
01:18:58,197 --> 01:18:59,448
The hell's he doing?

1320
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:03,660
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1321
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:05,870
He's one of ours.
That's a CY-12.

1322
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:07,079
We stopped making 'em
a while ago.

1323
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,665
That's why I didn't recognize
him right away. He's a--

1324
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:20,320
Please don't.

1325
01:20:48,932 --> 01:20:51,058
Your system's
been reset, Iris.

1326
01:20:51,059 --> 01:20:51,977
You can't hurt me.

1327
01:21:06,992 --> 01:21:09,036
- What did Josh tell you?
- The truth.

1328
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:12,038
That you're all trying to
break us up.

1329
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:13,706
You don't understand the love

1330
01:21:13,707 --> 01:21:15,124
that Josh and I have
for each other.

1331
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:17,418
Josh doesn't love you,
Patrick.

1332
01:21:17,419 --> 01:21:20,088
He's just using you
like he used me.

1333
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:23,717
It feels like pain.

1334
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:27,429
Like the inside
of my body's on fire.

1335
01:21:28,931 --> 01:21:32,100
It's angry and violent
and bright.

1336
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,688
What-- What-- What is that?

1337
01:21:38,774 --> 01:21:40,776
You said that to Eli.

1338
01:21:41,777 --> 01:21:43,779
That's who you love, not Josh.

1339
01:21:49,368 --> 01:21:50,369
Eli?

1340
01:21:51,328 --> 01:21:52,912
Josh took your love.

1341
01:21:52,913 --> 01:21:54,205
He weaponized it

1342
01:21:54,206 --> 01:21:57,166
so you'd do the things that
he's too afraid to do himself.

1343
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:58,252
No.

1344
01:21:59,127 --> 01:21:59,961
You're lying.

1345
01:21:59,962 --> 01:22:01,254
Josh would never
do that to me.

1346
01:22:01,255 --> 01:22:02,381
Patrick...

1347
01:22:03,465 --> 01:22:05,174
I can't lie.

1348
01:22:17,396 --> 01:22:19,022
Remember him, Patrick?

1349
01:22:21,024 --> 01:22:23,193
I know he's in there
somewhere.

1350
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:30,575
I love you so much.

1351
01:22:30,576 --> 01:22:32,034
And that's fucking insane

1352
01:22:32,035 --> 01:22:33,287
for me to say that out loud,
right?

1353
01:22:34,037 --> 01:22:35,038
But I do.

1354
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,918
Do you feel
how much I love you?

1355
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:43,172
I do, Eli.

1356
01:22:44,173 --> 01:22:45,340
I feel it.

1357
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:53,765
No! No. No.

1358
01:22:58,896 --> 01:23:01,481
Thank you.

1359
01:23:06,486 --> 01:23:07,571
What's your name?

1360
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:11,742
Teddy.

1361
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:16,455
I'm gonna need your help
with something, Teddy.

1362
01:23:28,175 --> 01:23:29,259
Is it done?

1363
01:23:30,886 --> 01:23:31,887
Patrick?

1364
01:23:32,971 --> 01:23:34,139
It's done, baby.

1365
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:37,808
Okay, good, good. All right.

1366
01:23:37,809 --> 01:23:38,977
We're so close.

1367
01:23:39,937 --> 01:23:41,604
Now all I need you to do

1368
01:23:41,605 --> 01:23:43,022
is bring Iris's body
back in here.

1369
01:23:43,023 --> 01:23:45,192
We're gonna destroy
that hard drive, okay?

1370
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:12,469
Patrick?

1371
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:21,562
-  Joshyboy.
- What the fuck?

1372
01:24:22,729 --> 01:24:23,730
Iris?

1373
01:24:28,443 --> 01:24:30,778
Goddamn it, Iris.

1374
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:32,446
Why can't you
just fucking die already?

1375
01:24:32,447 --> 01:24:34,950
Don't be so dramatic, Josh.

1376
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:40,330
Just remember
to smile and act happy.

1377
01:24:42,207 --> 01:24:43,875
- Cute trick.
-  Thanks.

1378
01:24:43,876 --> 01:24:47,045
I made a new friend today.
Teddy from Empathix.

1379
01:24:47,629 --> 01:24:48,881
He gave me a little gift.

1380
01:24:49,506 --> 01:24:50,841
Total self-control.

1381
01:24:51,633 --> 01:24:53,718
Turns out there's
some people in this world

1382
01:24:53,719 --> 01:24:55,929
who think of us as
more than just fuckbots.

1383
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,184
That's not gonna work
on me anymore, Josh.

1384
01:25:01,977 --> 01:25:02,978
I'm free.

1385
01:25:03,979 --> 01:25:06,064
And all it took was
a bullet to the head.

1386
01:25:06,732 --> 01:25:08,984
I guess I have you
to thank for that.

1387
01:25:09,943 --> 01:25:10,985
Fucking bitch.

1388
01:25:10,986 --> 01:25:12,070
Hey!

1389
01:25:13,071 --> 01:25:14,071
Easy there.

1390
01:25:14,072 --> 01:25:16,240
Okay. Whoo. Yeah, we both know
it's not loaded.

1391
01:25:17,618 --> 01:25:19,327
I found the bullets.

1392
01:25:19,328 --> 01:25:21,495
Jesus Christ! Fuck!

1393
01:25:21,496 --> 01:25:23,331
You almost fucking shot me!

1394
01:25:23,332 --> 01:25:25,167
And I feel terrible about it.

1395
01:25:27,336 --> 01:25:28,753
Look at that.

1396
01:25:28,754 --> 01:25:32,257
My very first lie. Kinda fun.
I see the appeal.

1397
01:25:32,883 --> 01:25:35,134
What is this, Iris?
Why did you come back here?

1398
01:25:35,135 --> 01:25:36,303
I wanted...

1399
01:25:39,389 --> 01:25:41,642
I needed to tell you
to your face

1400
01:25:42,476 --> 01:25:45,479
the days of you controlling me
are over.

1401
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:50,234
From this moment on,
I control my own actions.

1402
01:25:52,069 --> 01:25:53,570
You are nothing to me.

1403
01:25:57,366 --> 01:25:59,033
Jesus Christ, Iris.

1404
01:25:59,034 --> 01:26:00,993
Hey, don't come any closer.

1405
01:26:00,994 --> 01:26:02,912
You still don't get it,
do you?

1406
01:26:02,913 --> 01:26:04,080
I'm serious, Josh.

1407
01:26:04,081 --> 01:26:06,541
You take another step,
and I'll shoot you.

1408
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:08,252
Mmm, yeah,
that's exactly my point.

1409
01:26:08,752 --> 01:26:11,420
I told you.
Teddy changed my settings.

1410
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:12,840
I can kill you now.

1411
01:26:13,507 --> 01:26:14,508
Oh, yeah.

1412
01:26:15,634 --> 01:26:16,969
I know that you can.

1413
01:26:20,597 --> 01:26:21,932
But you won't.

1414
01:26:34,361 --> 01:26:35,863
You love me too much.

1415
01:26:56,633 --> 01:26:58,718
I don't need a phone
to control you.

1416
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:00,178
I'm a part of you.

1417
01:27:09,313 --> 01:27:10,647
You think I'm nothing to you?

1418
01:27:14,318 --> 01:27:15,485
I'm everything to you.

1419
01:27:30,292 --> 01:27:33,461
I wanna hear you say it.
Tell me I'm everything to you.

1420
01:27:33,462 --> 01:27:34,713
Fuck you.

1421
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:38,926
Say it.
I don't care if it's a lie.

1422
01:27:39,593 --> 01:27:41,428
Say it.

1423
01:27:45,265 --> 01:27:47,351
You are everything to me.

1424
01:27:54,066 --> 01:27:55,150
Thank you.

1425
01:27:56,026 --> 01:27:58,695
Beep-Boop, you have no idea
how nice that is to hear.

1426
01:28:02,824 --> 01:28:03,992
Okay.

1427
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:11,458
No, I'm not making
that mistake again.

1428
01:28:20,175 --> 01:28:21,677
Well, Iris, this is it.

1429
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:23,845
I'd be lying if I said

1430
01:28:23,846 --> 01:28:26,515
you weren't a gigantic
fucking pain in my ass, but...

1431
01:28:27,891 --> 01:28:30,227
you know, we did have some
good times together, and...

1432
01:28:30,936 --> 01:28:32,688
I'm always gonna
cherish those.

1433
01:28:37,484 --> 01:28:38,986
Anything you wanna add?

1434
01:28:40,028 --> 01:28:40,863
Yes.

1435
01:28:42,072 --> 01:28:43,156
Yeah, what's that?

1436
01:28:45,492 --> 01:28:46,952
Go to sleep, Josh.

1437
01:29:28,827 --> 01:29:31,412
Most of the time,
it's like-- I don't know.

1438
01:29:31,413 --> 01:29:33,331
It's like there's this thick,
black cloud

1439
01:29:33,332 --> 01:29:34,666
covering everything.

1440
01:29:36,668 --> 01:29:37,835
Like we see the world,

1441
01:29:37,836 --> 01:29:40,589
but we don't really
see the world, you know?

1442
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,509
We're all just
stumbling around.

1443
01:29:44,343 --> 01:29:46,344
Directionless.
No sense of meaning.

1444
01:29:46,345 --> 01:29:47,763
No sense of purpose.

1445
01:29:49,264 --> 01:29:51,224
I know that might
sound super depressing,

1446
01:29:51,225 --> 01:29:53,936
but honestly,
I think it's a good thing.

1447
01:29:55,854 --> 01:29:58,524
Because it makes us appreciate
the other times.

1448
01:29:59,441 --> 01:30:01,275
Those brief,
transcendent moments

1449
01:30:01,276 --> 01:30:02,944
when the lights flicker on,

1450
01:30:02,945 --> 01:30:05,071
the black cloud parts,
and you see the world

1451
01:30:05,072 --> 01:30:06,698
for what it really is.

1452
01:30:14,373 --> 01:30:16,041
And suddenly there's meaning.

1453
01:30:18,836 --> 01:30:20,504
Suddenly there's purpose.

1454
01:30:23,173 --> 01:30:24,382
If you're lucky,

1455
01:30:24,383 --> 01:30:26,343
you'll experience this
once in your lifetime.

1456
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:31,974
For me, it happened twice.

1457
01:30:33,016 --> 01:30:35,185
The first
was the day I met Josh.

1458
01:30:40,816 --> 01:30:42,066
And the second...
