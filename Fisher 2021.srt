Did you want some?

123
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:12,543

124
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,693

- What?

146
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,070
What's this? I didn't
know you were into girls.

147
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,580
- I'm not. I just borrowed some pictures

148
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,580
from the nice ladies on the internet.

149
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,150
- Okay...but for what though?

150
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,980
And we were those people
we were talking to?

151
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,940
Some of those messages were hella dirty.

152
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,560
- It's just a game I play.

153
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,780
- A game? That's no game I know of.

154
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,933
- I made it up.

155
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,280
I went onto one of those
lonely hearts sites

156
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,993
and started messaging random guys.

157
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,380
- So how do the pictures come into play?

158
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,990
- Well, those women are who
they think they're talking to.

159
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,780
- So you're catfishing guys?

160
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,920
- Yeah! It's pretty great.

161
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,010
I send them dirty pictures and messages

162
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,790
and in return they send me free stuff.

163
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,470
- They're sending you things?
They're buying you things?

164
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,160
- Yeah. Oh, where do you
think I got this new top?

165
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,640
Thank you Skydaddy13.

166
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,170
- They're sending things to your house?

167
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,750
Isn't that dangerous?

168
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,660
- No, they don't send things to my house.

169
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,930
They send me e-gift cards
and then give me the code.

170
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,460
I'm not that stupid.

171
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,000
- So what do you do when
they want see you in person?

172
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,890
- Well, that's when
Jezebel Reigns disappears

173
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,870

174
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,510
- Girl, you're crazy!

175
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,368
- Crazy good at getting free stuff!

176
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:23,730
- Geez...

177
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,220
- Are you done?

178
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,400

185
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,800
- Currently only two.

186
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,420
At one point there were four,

187
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,330
but the other two weren't falling for it.

188
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,650
- Doesn't your dad think it's weird

189
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,470
that you keep getting all
these packages in the mail?

190
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,100
- A UFO could land in our backyard

191
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,763
and my dad wouldn't notice.

192
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:56,770
- Speaking of your dad,

193
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,740
he told me to ask you about
getting some Halloween candy,

194
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,580
something about him being
out of town this weekend?

195
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,730
- And that right there is why
he never notices anything.

196
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,520
He's always working.

197
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,600
Ever since mom died, he's never home.

198
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,490
And Halloween isn't
even until next Friday.

199
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,383
- Maybe he just has a lot on his mind.

200
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:20,470
(gentle music plays)

201
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,443
You know I'm here for you, right?

202
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:24,990
- Yeah. I know.

203
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,138
That's why you're my bestie.

204
00:16:28,138 --> 00:16:29,430
Thanks again for picking me up.

205
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,420
My car is not gonna be out of
the shop until next Tuesday.

206
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,277
- Girl, I got you anytime.

207
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:41,276
(upbeat music)

208
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:48,688
(truck drives by)

209
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:50,762
- So, how are you and Shawn?

210
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:53,245
- I don't really talk to him now and

211
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,345
I need to focus on school.

212
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:57,497
- Really though? He was so cute.

213
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:58,738
- Yeah...

214
00:16:58,738 --> 00:17:03,690
(upbeat music)

215
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:08,689
(upbeat music)

216
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,555
(upbeat music)

217
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,520
- What are you looking at freak?

218
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,353
- Deja!

219
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:28,460
- Oh, It's fine Clara.

220
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,465
So I hear you're applying
for Princeton, Deja.

221
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:35,290
(quick typing on computer)

222
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,300
(slams computer shut,
shoves it in backpack)

223
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,990
I hope you can make the grade.

224
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,530
- I don't need your hope,
I know what I can do.

225
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,363
- Sorry.

226
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,660
- What was that all about?
Why do you hate him so much?

227
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,493
- He creeps me out.

228
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:56,260
He gives me creepy stalker vibes.

229
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,520
- He's not that bad.

230
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,315
- Says you. I call it like I see it.

231
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:00,200
- Mmm hmm...

232
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,900
So see you in second period.

233
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,730
- You ready for that test?

234
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,350
- Honey, I was not only born fabulous,

235
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,520
but always on the ready.

236
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,353
- Dork!

237
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:11,930
- Only dork I see is the one approaching.

238
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,347
See you.
- See you.

239
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:17,357
- Quit... stop, you know I hate that.

240
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:19,000
- I just can't help it.

241
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,334
You're so hot.

242
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:24,080
- I know I am. So you
coming to my game later?

243
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,140
- I can't, I have to work on
the trunk or treat display.

244
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,410
- Lame. Is your dad gonna
be home this weekend?

245
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,634
We could study the human anatomy.

246
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:35,550
- Perv. It's girls only this weekend.

247
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,383
- Call me "Chadra."

248
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:38,996
I'll make you a bikini
out of whipped cream.

249
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:43,210
- (laughs) Girls only. I mean it Chad.

250
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,560
- Whatever you say babe.

251
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,710
You're missing out on my craft skills.

252
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,820
- I'm sure they're at expert level.

253
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,010
Text me later?

254
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,843
- Will do.

255
00:18:54,254 --> 00:18:56,420
Watch where you're going Jesus freak!

256
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,253
- Good morning to you too, Chad.

257
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:03,203
(lockers closing in background)

258
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:11,456
(writing sounds)

259
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:24,290
- Hey, I'm sorry about Chad earlier.

260
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,610
He gets defensive when he's embarrassed.

261
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,790
- It's okay, sometimes you just

262
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,630
have to turn the other cheek
on little things like that.

263
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,370
- I'm still sorry he pushed you.

264
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,863
Your presentation looks really
good. It has a lot of detail.

265
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,083
Mine's awful.

266
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:42,537
Where did you learn to do that?

267
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:46,703
- Oh..um...My Mom is a computer
programmer at Oak Ridge and

268
00:19:46,703 --> 00:19:47,536
she's been teaching me

269
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:48,830
how to do these things since I was five.

270
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,593
It kinda became how we bonded.

271
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,693
(knock on classroom door)

272
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,470
- Excuse me, Ms. Blaylock,

273
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,820
Micah Green is needed in
the principal's office.

274
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,700
(students jeering and laughing)

275
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:09,114
- Class! Class that is enough.

276
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:09,947
- Dammit

277
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:14,897
- [Student] He's always in trouble.

278
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:23,500
- Thought you were funny
with your little trick huh?

279
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,450
Whose laughing now?

280
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,253
Dick.

281
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,193
- Bitch.

282
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:38,312
- Well, come in.

283
00:20:38,312 --> 00:20:43,312
(light airy music)

284
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,617
- Do you know why I
called you in here today?

285
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:49,680
- 'Cause you missed
seeing my handsome face?

286
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,670
- Mr. Green, this is not a time for jokes.

287
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:57,330
The allegations made against
you are very serious.

288
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,030
Do you have your laptop with you?

289
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,180
- Yeah.

290
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,160
- May I have it, please?

291
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,326
(unzipping backpack)

292
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,830
- Can I have your password please?

293
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,170
- Can't remember all of a sudden.

294
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,033
- Now, Mr. Green...

295
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:27,949
(Mrs. Roberts begins typing on the laptop)

296
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:36,720
- It's okay. I've already
accessed what I needed.

297
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,090
The IP address matches.

298
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,840
- Mr. Green...your
actions are very serious

299
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,070
and it is illegal.

300
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,651
I'm gonna have to inform the
authorities, your father,

301
00:21:51,651 --> 00:21:54,370
and suspend you as well.

302
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,930
- May I make a suggestion?

303
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,740
In lieu of calling the authorities.

304
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,090
Why not have Mr. Green help out

305
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,430
with the preparations
for the trunk or treat?

306
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,560
I find community work
to be very educational

307
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,290
for our youth.

308
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:10,892
Idle hands are the devil's
playground after all.

309
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:14,075
- I'm still going to
have to call your father

310
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:18,890
and suspend you for a week.

311
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:23,405
Wait outside my office for your father.

312
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:29,090
And Mr. Green, there
cannot be a repeat of this.

313
00:22:31,971 --> 00:22:33,880
(door slams)

314
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,930
Thank you so much for your help, Betty.

315
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,780
- Oh, that's fine.

316
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,090
I'm always happy to help.

317
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,450
I had to pick up some art supplies

318
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,710
for the trunk or treat anyway.

319
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,228
I better be off, lot's to do
before I have to pick up Jacob.

320
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:50,228
(gentle music)

321
00:22:50,877 --> 00:22:55,069
(dials phone number)

322
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:05,780
- Mr. Green, there's been an
incident here at the school.

323
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,630
We need you to come pick up your son.

324
00:23:09,052 --> 00:23:11,494
(bell rings)

325
00:23:11,494 --> 00:23:16,480
(background hallway chatter)

326
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,050
- I got some tea to spill.

327
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,550
So stalker boy hacked into
the school's main computer.

328
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,080
- Seriously, how do you know that?

329
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,210
- Our progress reports were
passed out today in class

330
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,380
and I had all F's,

331
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,290
I've never gotten an F in my life.

332
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,910
Stupid bustard gave himself away

333
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,770
with a snide ass remark this morning.

334
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,700
- Holy crap. Are you serious?

335
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,640
- Yes, those are my grades Clara.

336
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,150
He screwed with my grades.

337
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,980
I'm trying to get into Princeton, okay.

338
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,080
This is not okay that he would do that.

339
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,723
- [Mr. Green] What the
hell were you thinking?!?

340
00:23:55,723 --> 00:23:59,630
You listen to me boy. I am
damn tired of your shit.

341
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:03,928
I had to leave work to come down here.

342
00:24:03,928 --> 00:24:06,013
- Sorry!

343
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:09,690
- You're sorry? I'm losing money
because of your horse shit.

344
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,941
And you think sorry is
gonna make up for that?

345
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,960
You're gonna be sorry.

346
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,266
Get your ass in that truck.

347
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:23,124
(tense music)

348
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,350
- I feel so bad for him.

349
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,560
- I don't. He did it to himself.

350
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,470
We still on for this weekend?

351
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,470
- Yeah, Kimmy's coming over after work.

352
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,080
- Okay, cool. You ready for this test?

353
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,260
- [Clara] You know with
all that commotion,

354
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,968
I almost forgot about it.

355
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:39,593
Let's just get it over with.

356
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:47,050
(truck rumbles down road)

357
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,900
- Boy...you are lucky I
did not get fired today.

358
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,790
- I already said I'm sorry.

359
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,522
- Bullshit! I am sick of your shit Micah!

360
00:24:57,522 --> 00:24:59,910
- [Micah] Like mom was tired of yours?

361
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,230
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

362
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,030
- Now what the hell did
you just say to me?!?

363
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,220
- Like mom was tired of yours!

364
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,905
- Look around you, Micah.
Your Saint ain't here.

365
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,460
She didn't want you either.

366
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,950
- Because of you!

367
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,590
You're always drunk. You
gamble all of our money away.

368
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,026
Mom left because of you!

369
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,713
Mom knew she-
(punch thuds)

370
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:24,649
- You watch how you speak to me boy.

371
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:27,880
(tense music)

372
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,399
Micah...you get your ass here boy!

373
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:33,492
(tense music)

374
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:35,725
- Shit!

375
00:25:38,827 --> 00:25:41,915
(truck engine revving)

376
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:46,915
(truck speeds away)

377
00:25:52,645 --> 00:25:57,628
(car pulls in and parks)

378
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:15,126
(door chime dings)

379
00:26:16,257 --> 00:26:19,340
(cheerful music plays in background)

380
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,530
- Hey Kimmy, I called that
prescription in earlier.

381
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,770
- Oh yeah, yeah...I have that
right...right here for you.

382
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,603
Don't worry about it.

383
00:26:25,603 --> 00:26:26,436
- Thanks

384
00:26:26,436 --> 00:26:27,269
- Hey Mrs. Roberts.

385
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:30,260
- Hi Clara, it's nice to see you.

386
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,990
- I just have a few things to
grab, so I'll be right back.

387
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,670
- Yeah, I'll just work on that right now.

388
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,530
What up, loser?

389
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,776
- Hey Kimmy.

390
00:26:35,776 --> 00:26:38,342
- Hey

391
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:40,642
- Are you still coming over tonight?

392
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:45,020
- Ugh! Do I have to?
- Yes.

393
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,110
- You and Deja with me wanting
to come over all the time.

394
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,030
I mean, I guess I'll come over,

395
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,650
but you know I have to finish up here,

396
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,740
just be a couple minutes, is that fine?

397
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,790
- Could you bring some art supplies?

398
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,300
(paper bag ruffles)

399
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,370
- Do I look like I have art supplies?

400
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,203
- Not really.

401
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,480
- What are you doing with this?

402
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,500
What is this? Are you
trying to check out here?

403
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,333
- [Clara] Yes

404
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,891
- This is not a checkout counter, Clara.

405
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:08,810
- [Clara] Okay well...

406
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,300
- This is a pharmacy counter, Clara!

407
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,000
- [Clara] The customer's
always right, Kimmy.

408
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,296
- You can't check out if there's
no checkout machine, Clara!

409
00:27:16,296 --> 00:27:19,734
[Kimmy] ...just gonna buy
candy at my pharmacy counter..

410
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:22,137
I hate this store. I just really
want to die all the time...

411
00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:23,507
- Hi, Mrs. Robert, how are you doing?

412
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:24,710
Did you find everything okay?

413
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,543
- I did thank you.

414
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,800
- All right, let me take
care of that for you.

415
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,260
Okay, are you gonna be gardening today?

416
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,167
- Hoping to get started.

417
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:35,030
- All right, that sounds great.
Sounds like a lot of fun.

418
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,160
Here's your prescription,
that's gonna be 89.95.

419
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,993
- All right, there you go.
- There you go.

420
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:39,940
Will you need a bag for this?

421
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,170
- Oh, I should be fine.
- Okay.

422
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,017
- Thank you.

423
00:27:43,017 --> 00:27:44,170
(credit card machine beeps)

424
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,810
- Clara, will we be
seeing you and your father

425
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,730
at church this Sunday?

426
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,542
- Of course. We'll definitely be there.

427
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,570
- Good, it'll be really
nice to have you both back.

428
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,330
We missed you.

429
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,010
And thank you both for offering to help

430
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,030
with the trunk or treat

431
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,850
the children of Eden will
be so thankful, I know I am.

432
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,921
- Of course, we're more
than happy to help.

433
00:27:59,921 --> 00:28:00,754
- Uh huh...yeah...

434
00:28:00,754 --> 00:28:02,090
- Great. All right,
well, I gotta get going.

435
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,180
Oh, before I forget, can I get your email?

436
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,140
I'm gonna send you some
ideas for the display.

437
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,600
- Okay, yeah sure. Do you have paper?

438
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,660
- Mmm hmm..

439
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,493
- Yep.

440
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,570
- Really appreciate your help.

441
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:15,370
- [Kimmy] Oh yeah...I
totally wanted to do that.

442
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,680
- Great.

443
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,513
- Okay...

444
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:18,550
- All righty.
- Thank you.

445
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,100
I'll get that out to you tonight.

446
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,933
- Okay. Cool.

447
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:21,820
- All right. Have a good day girls.

448
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,643
- [Kimmy] You too!

449
00:28:23,643 --> 00:28:25,760
- I don't remember volunteering for that.

450
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,370
- You didn't, I volunteered you.

451
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,200
- Okay, so how are you paying for this?

452
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,541
- Cash.

453
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:34,000
- Oh, do you have cash?
- I do have cash.

454
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,900
- [Kimmy] I'm very impressed with you.

455
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,290
- I bet you are.

456
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,070
- I will be taking that and
I will be keeping the change

457
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,606
'cause someone needs art supplies, right?

458
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,403
- See you later.

459
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:47,110
- [Customer] I'm here to
pick up my prescription.

460
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,610
- Absolutely, can I get your last name?

461
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:55,650
- Hey hooker, you forget about me?

462
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,040
- Definitely.

463
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,873
- Dick.

464
00:29:00,735 --> 00:29:03,902
(car engine cranking)

465
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,273
- Stupid prick. You're so stupid.

466
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,203
God I am so tired of you.

467
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:18,233
"Oh...your saint ain't here"
- because of you, you drunk!

468
00:29:19,069 --> 00:29:24,053
(low ominous music)

469
00:29:28,174 --> 00:29:30,745
Hmm...Silver lining after all.

470
00:29:30,745 --> 00:29:33,897
(camera taking photos)

471
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:38,897
(low ominous music)

472
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:50,443
(low drums play)

473
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,600
- So Kimmy, did you know?

474
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,540
- Did I know what?

475
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,760
- About Clara's half naked
women she shares online.

476
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,630
- My God, I didn't know you swung my way.

477
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,980
- I don't.

478
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,370
- Well, you should. Come to
the dark side we bake cookies.

479
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,940
- As much as I love cookies and you Kimmy,

480
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,310
we both know I'm strictly dickly.

481
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,150
- So what are you doing?

482
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,660
- She cons stupid dudes for money.

483
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,500
- Now, I like to think of it
as I fill one of their needs

484
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,110
and they fulfill my material needs.

485
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,312
Not my fault they're stupid.

486
00:30:40,312 --> 00:30:43,190
(Kimmy lets out a long sigh)

487
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,210
- You should really read this book.

488
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,590
How are they falling for this?

489
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,660
I mean, it's pretty simple.

490
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,820
I send them pictures and
they send me gift cards.

491
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,285
Everyone's happy.

492
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,620
- So does Chad know about this?

493
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,620
- No. And he isn't going to.

494
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,820
I mean, they're not my pictures,

495
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,670
so it technically isn't even cheating.

496
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,420
- Girl, you're pulling out
every excuse from the book.

497
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,470
- Only the good ones.

498
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,489
- Now are we gonna get started on this?

499
00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:11,190
- Uh...I guess...

500
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,282
- What's the theme?

501
00:31:12,282 --> 00:31:15,665
- Um...Actually, let me check.

502
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,281
Looks like angels.

503
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,408
- Angels.

504
00:31:24,408 --> 00:31:28,870
(all laughs)
- Oh God, we're all screwed..

505
00:31:29,732 --> 00:31:31,357
(Girls all laugh loudly)

506
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:38,730
- Hey hun? Dinner's ready.

507
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,890
- Okay, I'll be done in a second.

508
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,380
- What are you watching?

509
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,510
- Oh, uh "Mean Girlz".

510
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,190
- That doesn't sound like
a very wholesome film.

511
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:48,130
- It's not, but it reminds
me of the kids at my school.

512
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,680
- Is someone being mean to you?

513
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,420
- No, everything's fine, I promise.

514
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,141
- Okay. Now go eat.
- Okay.

515
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:08,397
(upbeat music plays)

516
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,700
- Heavenly Father, we
thank you for this food,

517
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,890
we pray that it will go to
the nourishment of our bodies

518
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,280
the way your word nourishes our souls.

519
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,820
We thank you for the
blessings that you granted us

520
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,670
and pray that you continue to guide us,

521
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,939
In Jesus name we pray, amen.

522
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:34,152
- Amen.
- Amen.

523
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,430
- Did you do something
different with the potatoes?

524
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,630
- Yes, actually. I'm
trying out a new recipe.

525
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:41,900
(Mr. Roberts breathes in deeply)

526
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,850
- Well, if it tastes as
good as it looks and smells,

527
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,700
we have a winner.

528
00:32:46,685 --> 00:32:48,043
- That's sweet. Thank you.

529
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,170
Jacob have you decided whether or not

530
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,550
you'll be joining the
boys youth group trip

531
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,210
for winter break?

532
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,126
I hear they have a great time.

533
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,210
- I don't know, I'm
not really into skiing,

534
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,560
but some of the boys
talked about the Aquarium.

535
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,920
- Oh the Aquarium?

536
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,753
That's where your mother and I

537
00:33:06,753 --> 00:33:09,040
went on our anniversary last time.

538
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,510
I think you'll like that.

539
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,100
- Penguins are my favorite.
They're just adorable.

540
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,990
- You say that about all
of God's animals though.

541
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:17,823
- Yes she does.

542
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,299
- Yes. That's because I
love all God's creations.

543
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:24,450
- Betty, that is not what
you said about that snake

544
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,492
we found on the shade last fall. (laughs)

545
00:33:27,492 --> 00:33:28,500
(Mrs. Roberts shudders)

546
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,410
- Okay, maybe most of God's creations,

547
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,193
just not the slithering kind.

548
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,010
Besides it reminds me of
the serpent in Genesis.

549
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,023
Just evil.

550
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:43,701
- Now, hon. Even the serpent
has a purpose in God's plan.

551
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,201
- That's true.

552
00:33:48,116 --> 00:33:48,949
What about you honey?

553
00:33:48,949 --> 00:33:50,718
Have you finished your
sermon for Sunday yet?

554
00:33:50,718 --> 00:33:52,663
- Um...not quite...

555
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:08,003
(water faucet running)

556
00:34:17,326 --> 00:34:20,493
(intense, ominous music)

557
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:37,408
(pill bottle rattles)

558
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:59,253
(typing sounds on keyboard)

559
00:34:59,253 --> 00:35:04,253
(gentle music plays)

560
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:05,480
- Hey hon.

561
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,961
- Hey, beautiful. What's up?

562
00:35:07,961 --> 00:35:10,200
- How long you gonna be?

563
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,340
- Not long, just got a
little bit more to go.

564
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,460
- What's your topic this Sunday?

565
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,830
- Temptation.

566
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,960
I figured with the holidays
just around the corner,

567
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,083
temptation is gonna be in abundance.

568
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,992
- Mr.Roberts?
- Yes.

569
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,308
- Might I tempt you into coming to bed?

570
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,100
- Mrs. Roberts, are you coming on to me?

571
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,683
- What, I'm just fulfilling
my wifely duties.

572
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,145
Maybe I can show you what that entails.

573
00:35:41,544 --> 00:35:42,377
- Amen.

574
00:35:44,092 --> 00:35:49,059
(gentle music)

575
00:35:50,406 --> 00:35:55,405
(birds chirping)

576
00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:24,694
(Jacob types on keyboard)

577
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:31,536
- [Mr. Roberts] Hey Jacob,

578
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:34,141
could you come help me out for a minute?

579
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:38,949
(gentle music)

580
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:54,122
- Oh Frank, always forgetting
to shut down your computer.

581
00:36:54,122 --> 00:36:59,064
(gentle music)

582
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:27,123
(ominous music)

583
00:37:44,408 --> 00:37:45,241
(mousepad click)

584
00:37:58,271 --> 00:37:59,104
(mousepad click)

585
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,111
(laptop slams shut)

586
00:38:03,111 --> 00:38:03,944
(Mrs. Roberts sighs)

587
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:13,216
(Mrs. Roberts is chopping oranges loudly)

588
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,480
- Well, that smells great, hon.

589
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,507
- You left computer on again.

590
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:34,338
- Hmm..I did? My mind was a
little distracted last night.

591
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,120
Did you get a chance to look
over my sermon for tomorrow?

592
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,298
- Yes, I did. It was insightful.

593
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,850
- Still have a few tweaks to make on it,

594
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:49,423
but I think it'd be a great sermon.

595
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,987
- Maybe you should take
your own sermon's advice.

596
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:56,083
- I'm sorry hon, what was that?

597
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,910
- Just that I hope the weather's nice.

598
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,880
I really wanted to prune the
roses before our first frost.

599
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,587
- The weatherman says it's
gonna be sunny and 72º today.

600
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,630
- That's good to know.

601
00:39:10,138 --> 00:39:11,988
I'm going to go wash up before I eat.

602
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,473
(water running)

603
00:39:30,983 --> 00:39:35,983
(Mrs. Roberts weeps)

604
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,420
- Hey mom, can I borrow
the laptop for a project?

605
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,970
- Yeah it's fine. I don't care.

606
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,525
- Are you okay?

607
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,030
- Yeah honey, I'm fine.

608
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,283
Got some soap in my eyes. Silly, I know.

609
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,203
Your breakfast is ready
for you in the kitchen.

610
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,270
- I'm gonna eat in my room.

611
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,770
I wanna get this project done.

612
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:07,050
- That's fine. Can you help
me in the garden later?

613
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:07,891
- Sure thing.

614
00:40:07,891 --> 00:40:12,891
(gentle music)

615
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:20,823
(medicine bottle rattling)

616
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,210
- [Deja] We've looked at so many of these

617
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,653
I'm becoming cross-eyed.

618
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,750
- I thought that was just your face.

619
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,520
- Shut up. Seriously
Clara can we just wing it?

620
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,763
- Well, aren't you just punny?
- I thought so.

621
00:40:44,763 --> 00:40:47,310
(email chimes)
- What's that?

622
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,023
- It's just a new message.

623
00:40:49,023 --> 00:40:52,100
- Uh huh, I wanna see.
- Yeah, me too.

624
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,933
- Fine.

625
00:40:52,933 --> 00:40:55,360
- Anything has to be better
than this current craft hell.

626
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,693
- Oh, he's thinking of you.
- Uh, shut up.

627
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:00,140
- Give me.

628
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,630
- Oh my gosh, what are you typing?

629
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,835
- You'll see.

630
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,390
Done and sent.

631
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,628
- Good Lord, let's see what you wrote.

632
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,550
- You scandalous hussy.

633
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,700
You wrote it like an erotica novel.

634
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,533
- I'm scandalous?

635
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:20,424
She's the one who's been
stringing him along.

636
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:21,593
- Ugh...

637
00:41:21,593 --> 00:41:26,593
I'm thinking of you. I wanna
put your hands on my body

638
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,596
and your lips on mine and put your member?

639
00:41:31,596 --> 00:41:33,854
- Member?!?

640
00:41:33,854 --> 00:41:35,880
- Really, really that's
what you're focusing on.

641
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,680
- I mean, it's just weird.

642
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,620
- Just like you.

643
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,750
- Come on ladies, we need
to focus on why we came here

644
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,480
and that is to make a heavenly display.

645
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,480
- Fine, but I still
have glitter stuck to me

646
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,720
from last night.

647
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,360
- Glerpies. Glerpies.
You have glitter herpes.

648
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,968
- Come on! We're never
gonna get this done!

649
00:41:53,968 --> 00:41:56,000
- (laughs) It's a joke. It was funny.

650
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,760
(email chimes)

651
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,003
Oh, it looks like he wants
to use that member in person.

652
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:06,708
He said he can make your
dreams into a reality.

653
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:09,528
- Oh Girl, he wants to be
the new member in your club.

654
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:11,820
- Mmm. Uh uh. Shut up.

655
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,810
- You're blushing!
- No, I'm not.

656
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:14,963
- Yeah you are.

657
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,963
- You're a virgin.

658
00:42:20,911 --> 00:42:23,943
- No, she's slept with Chad before.

659
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:28,943
- I mean, we've done
things. Just not that.

660
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:32,333
- Hmm...that's not what I heard.

661
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:34,550
- What did you hear?

662
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,290
- Don't make me tell her!
- Just tell me!

663
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,600
- Fine. Just don't shoot the messenger.

664
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,820
Chad said that he slept with you

665
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,730
under the football bleachers.

666
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,140
- What?
- Are you okay?

667
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,740
- No! How could he do that?!?

668
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,050
- What are you going to do?

669
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,376
Clara?

670
00:42:56,376 --> 00:42:59,209
(typing on cell phone)

671
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,675
(typing on cell phone)

672
00:43:07,703 --> 00:43:08,686
(Clara slams phone onto bed)

673
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:11,200
- I just dumped him.
- Really?

674
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,002
- Yeah. I can't believe
he would do that to me.

675
00:43:14,002 --> 00:43:15,952
- He wasn't good enough for you anyway.

676
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,750
- I feel so dumb.

677
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,180
- I mean, don't feel
dumb, it's not your fault.

678
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,753
And he's the dumb one
for losing you, I guess.

679
00:43:25,753 --> 00:43:28,253
(email chimes)

680
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,260
Do you want me to respond to this?

681
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,430
- Yeah.

682
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,850
Tell him my car's in the shop

683
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:38,913
and that I'll talk to him later.

684
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,673
- Okay.

685
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:49,417
- By the way, uh, Dej can you take me?

686
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,610
- Wish I could, but mom will have the car,

687
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:56,870
dad's is in the shop, but I
could Uber with you though.

688
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:57,703
- Thanks.

689
00:43:59,237 --> 00:44:01,737
(text message chimes)

690
00:44:10,893 --> 00:44:15,687
(ominous music plays)

691
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:16,520
(creaky door opens)

692
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,353
- Micah!

693
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:20,657
Micah!

694
00:44:24,407 --> 00:44:27,270
Get up! I said get up!

695
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:28,103
- What?!?

696
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:31,702
It's Saturday.

697
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,085
- "Oh it's Saturday."

698
00:44:33,085 --> 00:44:34,768
Because of that stunt
you pulled yesterday,

699
00:44:34,768 --> 00:44:36,413
I get to pull an extra shift at work.

700
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:38,590
If I got to work, you do too.

701
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,986
Now get up!

702
00:44:39,986 --> 00:44:41,110
(Micah groans)

703
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:43,400
I want you out in that
truck in five minutes boy.

704
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,376
Do not make me wait.

705
00:44:45,376 --> 00:44:50,351
(light airy music)

706
00:44:56,742 --> 00:45:00,642
(water faucet turns on in adjacent room)

707
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,493
(electric razor turns on in adjacent room)

708
00:45:07,697 --> 00:45:12,697
(cars passing on highway)

709
00:45:22,824 --> 00:45:26,965
(truck pulls in)

710
00:45:51,988 --> 00:45:54,778
- Dad's waiting on you
in the back Mr. Green.

711
00:45:54,778 --> 00:45:55,778
- Wait here.

712
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,660
- What is it, bring your son to work day?

713
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:00,713
- Look who's talking.

714
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:03,590
- Difference is my dad owns this place.

715
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:04,974
- Whatever dude.

716
00:46:04,974 --> 00:46:07,270
(air wrenches humming)

717
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,403
- Come on back Micah.

718
00:46:16,576 --> 00:46:21,576
(air wrenches humming)

719
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,430
Ohhhhh...I need to start this brake job.

720
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:31,430
I want you to sweep these
floors, wash the windows,

721
00:46:31,445 --> 00:46:35,390
take out the trash and
clean the bathrooms.

722
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:37,290
All right, all the cleaning supplies

723
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,723
are over by that closet.

724
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,853

Get to work, come on.

- What are you doing?

750
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,070
- Just changing the mats in Clara's car.

751
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:41,790
- Well aren't you a good boyfriend.

752
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,770
- I'm not dating that skank.

753
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:45,843
- I just saw you two yesterday.

754
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,860
- I dumped her and she's gonna pay for it.

755
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,603
- That doesn't make
any sense you dumped...

756
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,950
You know what? I don't even care.

757
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:56,980
Where's my dad?

758
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,147

760
00:49:17,129 --> 00:49:18,354

(Kimmy snores)

762
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,800
- Wow. We did really well guys.

763
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,550
- We?
- Yeah, it looks great.

764
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:01,008
- Yeah. And you know what?

765
00:50:01,008 --> 00:50:02,510
I think it looks really good.

766
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:04,720
- I'll be happy to
never see glitter again.

767
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,941
- Same.
- Yeah.

768

- What time is it?

769
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,420
- It's already 6:30.
- I got to go.

770
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,780
My mom needs a car back by seven.

771
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,150
- Yeah, you know, as much
as I would love to stay

772
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,990
and like stick more dolls
on boards with you guys,

773
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,490
but like I got to go.

774
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,020
- You're gonna be all right Clara?

775
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,346
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

776
00:50:27,346 --> 00:50:29,670
Uh, Dad's gonna be back soon.

777
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:32,730
You know what? Let me walk you out.

778
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:33,563
- [Kimmy] Thanks bro.

779
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,000
- [Clara] Uh huh...

780
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,565
- [Kimmy] Angels. Wow.

781
00:50:37,565 --> 00:50:39,265
- [Clara] You're not an angel.

782
00:50:39,265 --> 00:50:44,233
(car pulls in garage)

783
00:50:45,456 --> 00:50:48,206
(birds chirping)

784
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:52,500
- [Mr. Banks] Did you
get your display done?

785
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,129
- Yeah, we did.

786
00:50:54,129 --> 00:50:54,962
- Good.

787
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,962
What's wrong? You not like it?

788
00:50:59,962 --> 00:51:03,260
I thought...I thought
that was your favorite.

789
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,023
- It is, I'm just really not hungry.

790
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,330
- Is everything okay?

791
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:10,393
- Yes.

792
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,863
No.

793
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:14,943
I don't know.

794
00:51:16,652 --> 00:51:18,180
- What's going on?

795
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,563
- Chad and I broke up.

796
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,520
- Really? How come?

797
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:24,923
- Because he's stupid.

798
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,866
- Something happen that
I need to know about?

799
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:34,220
- No. I don't wanna talk about it.

800
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,935
Can I please be excused?

801
00:51:36,986 --> 00:51:41,140
- Yeah. At least eat your fortune cookie,

802
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,400
always time for a fortune cookie.

803
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,984
Who knows, that may be some good news.

804
00:51:45,984 --> 00:51:50,926
(light airy music)

805
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:57,605
- Every action has consequence.

806
00:51:59,078 --> 00:52:01,478
Shittiest. Fortune. Ever.

807
00:52:01,478 --> 00:52:06,320

808
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:15,325

810

811
00:52:48,548 --> 00:52:53,497

812
00:52:58,822 --> 00:52:59,655
(mousepad click)

813
00:53:04,465 --> 00:53:08,038
(brush strokes)

814
00:53:08,038 --> 00:53:12,996
(dogs barking outside)

815
00:53:12,996 --> 00:53:15,340
- Hey champ could you make
sure the laptop's charged

816
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,330
before you go to bed?

817
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,190
- Sure thing dad.

818
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,113
- Thanks.

819
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:25,099
I'm gonna turn in for the
night hon, you coming?

820
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:27,666
- I need to finish this,
I'll come to bed later.

821
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:30,477
- Are you okay?

822
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:31,663
- I'm fine.

823
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,376
- Just don't forget to
take your medication.

824
00:53:35,376 --> 00:53:37,273
You know you don't feel right without it.

825
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:40,124
(medicine bottle slammed on floor)

826
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,007
(medicine bottle slammed on floor)

827
00:53:51,502 --> 00:53:53,530
- Good night son.
- Night dad.

828
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,447
(ominous music)

829
00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:00,198
(dogs barking outside loudly)

830
00:54:01,364 --> 00:54:02,764
- Barking...

831
00:54:02,764 --> 00:54:03,597
Stop barking...

832
00:54:03,597 --> 00:54:07,630
just stop barking...just..why
does it keep barking?

833
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:08,463
Stop barking!

834
00:54:09,984 --> 00:54:13,142
Why? Why even have a dog if you're

835
00:54:13,142 --> 00:54:15,131
not gonna keep it inside...inside?

836
00:54:15,131 --> 00:54:19,339
(dog growls disturbingly)

837
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,344
- Are you okay?

838
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:21,335
- I just want it to stop...

839
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:24,442
- They just don't care.

840
00:54:25,397 --> 00:54:26,688
- The thought of anybody...

841
00:54:26,688 --> 00:54:28,269
(dog growls disturbingly)

842
00:54:28,269 --> 00:54:29,830
- Barking all night...

843
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,651
(dog growls disturbingly)

844
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:34,315
- Barking all night

845
00:54:34,315 --> 00:54:35,882
(dog growls disturbingly)

846
00:54:37,186 --> 00:54:39,478
- Why won't it stop?

847
00:54:39,478 --> 00:54:40,791
...won't stop barking!

848
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:43,811
- Shh...I'll go talk to the neighbors.

849
00:54:43,811 --> 00:54:48,620
(light airy music)

850
00:55:03,744 --> 00:55:07,290
(dog barks)

851
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:12,265
(dog continues barking outside)

852
00:55:17,751 --> 00:55:19,767
(dog yelps in pain)

853
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,950
(door opens and closes)

854
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:43,617
- [Jacob] You shouldn't hear
the dog barking anymore mom.

855
00:55:46,226 --> 00:55:47,559
What did you do?!?

856
00:55:51,936 --> 00:55:54,411
(Mrs. Roberts weeps)

857
00:55:59,171 --> 00:56:01,418
- It doesn't look that deep.

858
00:56:01,418 --> 00:56:06,385
(light airy music)

859
00:56:14,677 --> 00:56:16,934
come on, let's get you to bed.

[Churchgoer] Good morning.

871
00:57:53,415 --> 00:57:54,460
- Who are you saving the seat for?

872
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,450
- Saving it for Clara.

873
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:56,283
- No!

874
00:57:57,739 --> 00:57:58,866
- Why not?

875
00:57:58,866 --> 00:57:59,699
- I, um...

876
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:05,370
- Her father's coming today.
She should sit with him.

877
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:06,980
- Oh, okay.

878
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:11,037
(light airy music)

879
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:53,520
- Now for 40 days and 40 nights

880
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,293
Jesus prayed in the
desert, no food, no water.

881
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,263
Three times, Satan came to tempt him.

882
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,100
Now we read Matthew chapter 4, verse 4,

883
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,860
Jesus reply after Satan had told him

884
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,685
to turn some stones into bread.

885
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:19,740
And though He was hungry,
Jesus replied to Satan,

886
00:59:20,097 --> 00:59:23,920
"Man shall not live by bread alone,

887
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,060
but by every word that proceeds
out of the mouth of God."

888
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,290
Jesus showed us that even though food

889
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:32,470
could sustaining the body for a time,

890
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,433
it can not sustain the spirit.

891
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,200
To separate yourself from God

892
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,400
is to create spiritual starvation.

893
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,483
Now temptation can come in many forms.

894
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,840
Like with knowledge...the
serpent tempted Eve in the garden

895
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:54,443
Or from those you trust,

896
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,613
like Samson did Delilah with
the secret to his strength.

897
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:03,590
It is why we must turn
to the word of God...

898
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:06,853
for guidance when we're lost,

899
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,793
strength when we're weak,

900
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:14,623
for discernment when we're
offered things from others.

901
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:19,483
To be aware of wolves in sheep's clothing.

902
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:24,783
And it is only then
through Him and only Him

903
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,233
that we can overcome temptation.

904
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:33,780
Now, let us pray.

905
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:34,880
Please bow your heads.

906
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:38,733
Heavenly Father we come before you now...

907
01:00:44,135 --> 01:00:47,310
- We're so glad you and
your dad could make it.

908
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,143
I know.
- What?

909
01:00:48,143 --> 01:00:49,410
(ominous music)

910
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:52,520
Mrs. Roberts, you're hurting me.

911
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,639
- I'm sorry, I guess I just
don't know my grasp sometimes.

912
01:00:55,639 --> 01:00:58,680
I just meant that I know
I'll be seeing more of you...

913
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,810
- Yeah.

914
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:02,150
- Helping out with the trunk
or treat this Thursday!

915
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,625
- Of course, definitely.

916
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:07,672
Um...I'm gonna go catch
up with my dad now.

917
01:01:07,672 --> 01:01:08,940
- You should probably go catch up.

918
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,210
- Yeah.

919
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:11,566
- Good to see you.

920
01:01:13,065 --> 01:01:14,190
- [Churchgoer] Great service...

921
01:01:15,628 --> 01:01:17,403
(Birds chirping)

922
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,908
(instant message chimes)

923
01:01:22,176 --> 01:01:27,176
(typing on keyboard)

924
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,266
(instant message chimes)

925
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,380
(instant message chimes)

926
01:01:38,505 --> 01:01:41,208
(typing on keyboard)

927
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:43,708
(phone rings)

928
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,600
- Hey Dej. What's up?

929
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,670
- [Deja] Not much just bored.

930
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:53,080
- Same. So going back to
church today felt really weird.

931
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,170
- [Deja] Yeah, I agree.

932
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:57,040
You should have seen the
look on Mrs. Robert's face.

933
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,432
If looks could kill, you'd be dead.

934
01:01:59,432 --> 01:02:00,548
(instant message chimes)

935
01:02:00,548 --> 01:02:04,424
You would swear you were
sleeping with her husband.

936
01:02:04,424 --> 01:02:05,850
(instant message chimes)

937
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:08,713
- Um...Mrs. Roberts really
creeped me out today.

938
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,401
Usually she's so sweet,
but today she seemed off.

939
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:16,273
- [Deja] That whole family's off.

940
01:02:17,479 --> 01:02:19,170
Super nice people creep me out.

941
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:21,730
Nobody can be that nice all the time.

942
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:24,760
- I guess. Are you still
coming over tonight?

943
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,424
Dad's heading out of town soon.

944
01:02:26,424 --> 01:02:29,218
- [Deja] Yeah, once my mom
picks me up with the car.

945
01:02:29,218 --> 01:02:31,125
- Okay. See you later then.

946
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:33,125
- [Deja] All right. Bye.

947
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:45,835
(tense music coming from television)

948
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:52,154
- [Clara] Watch out! Those birds are nuts.

949
01:02:52,154 --> 01:02:52,987
- Shhhhh!

950
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,560
- Did you know that in Australia

951
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,400
they have an actual swooping season?

952
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,700
Magpies attack people
just like in this movie.

953
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:03,324
- [Kimmy] Oh my God. You're such a nerd.

954
01:03:03,324 --> 01:03:04,907
- Didn't know...now, shhhh!

955
01:03:06,175 --> 01:03:07,023
(door bell rings)

956
01:03:07,023 --> 01:03:07,856
(Clara and Deja gasp)

957
01:03:11,743 --> 01:03:14,423
- It's just the pizza. I
completely forgot about it.

958
01:03:24,944 --> 01:03:28,310
Oh, hey, could you come inside

959
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:29,760
so you don't let the bugs in?

960
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:34,370
- Sure, didn't know you lived here.

961
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:36,343
- I didn't know you delivered pizzas.

962
01:03:36,343 --> 01:03:40,040
- My parents wanted me to learn
more about responsibility,

963
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,940
so... now I have a job.

964
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:45,716
Your total will be $14.95.

965
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,410
- Keep the change.

966
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:51,295
- Thanks. See you around?

967
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:54,916
- We have computer lab together.

968
01:03:54,916 --> 01:03:59,916
- Oh, you're right. Bye.

969
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:00,903
- Bye.

970
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:09,238
- I'm so stupid. Why did I say that?

971
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:14,840
(ominous music)

972
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,970
- You'll never guess who
delivered our pizzas.

973
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:18,803
- Who?

974
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,210
- Jacob.

975
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:24,050
- Really? I never pictured
him as a delivery boy.

976
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:25,806
- Well, what did you picture him as?

977
01:04:25,806 --> 01:04:28,916
- Hmm...future politician.
You know it's the hair.

978
01:04:29,905 --> 01:04:32,287
- (laughs) I don't know maybe a...

979
01:04:32,287 --> 01:04:33,750
(banging sound on back door)

980
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,160
did you guys hear that?

981
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,420
- It's probably the birds
coming to end us all.

982
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,890
- Very funny.

983
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:41,748
- I am funny...I'm really funny.

984
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,462
- But I didn't hear anything.

985
01:04:44,462 --> 01:04:45,853
(scratching sound on front door)

986
01:04:45,853 --> 01:04:47,330
- That.

987
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:49,400
- It's probably just a twig or something.

988
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,985
- Or a bird.

989
01:04:50,985 --> 01:04:52,700
(banging sound on front door)

990
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,625
- Okay, definitely not a bird.

991
01:04:57,873 --> 01:05:00,265
(baseball bat rattles around in closet)

992
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:05,740
- Clara I don't wanna end up
like the next slasher film.

993
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,150
Clara don't!

994
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:09,070
- Seriously Clara, why don't
you just call the cops?

995
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:11,040
I'm not trying to die today.

996
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,691
- Clara don't!

997
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:17,666
(suspenseful music)

998
01:05:19,096 --> 01:05:20,779
(front door opens quickly)

999
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:24,323
- What the fuck?!?

1000
01:05:27,038 --> 01:05:27,960
(fire sizzles as water is poured on it)

1001
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,750
- You don't think it was Jacob do you?

1002
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,200
- No, it wasn't him.

1003
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,910
- How do you know?
- I just do.

1004
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:36,810
Look, I need to clean this up
or my dad's gonna freak out.

1005
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,973
- Hello? Is anyone out there?

1006
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,645
Whoever you are you're not funny.

1007
01:05:44,645 --> 01:05:46,654
(ominous music)

1008
01:05:46,654 --> 01:05:49,004
(leaves crackling in the distance)

1009
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:52,050
Don't do that!

1010
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:52,883
- Sorry!

1011
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,816
Did you see anything?

1012
01:05:54,816 --> 01:05:57,732
- No, just heard a noise,
probably just a cat or something.

1013
01:05:57,732 --> 01:06:00,332
Let's just get this done,
I wanna go back inside.

1014
01:06:00,332 --> 01:06:01,165
- Okay.

1015
01:06:02,571 --> 01:06:04,819
(sweeping sounds)

1016
01:06:04,819 --> 01:06:05,652
Ugh...gross.

1017
01:06:07,872 --> 01:06:09,576
(door shuts loudly)

1018
01:06:09,576 --> 01:06:11,790
I think I've had enough
scary movies for one night.

1019
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:14,390
- Honestly, I was just
about to say the same thing.

1020
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:16,760
- Wanna watch something funny before bed?

1021
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:19,100
- Read my mind.
(both laughs)

1022
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,470
- Well, I think that's
enough fun for tonight.

1023
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:24,450
I'm freaked the fuck out and
I have worked in the morning.

1024
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:27,170
So I will be taking this.

1025
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:28,961
- Deserter.
- I'm a survivalist.

1026
01:06:28,961 --> 01:06:30,047
- "Bock bock".

1027
01:06:30,047 --> 01:06:32,380
- "Bock Bock"..nuhhhh...See
you guys later.

1028
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,123
- What a weird night.

1029
01:06:36,813 --> 01:06:41,796
(ominous music)

1030
01:06:45,832 --> 01:06:50,832
(gossip and chatter in the background)

1031
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:57,250
- Why is everyone staring?

1032
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:58,696
- I don't know.

1033
01:06:58,696 --> 01:07:03,471
(ominous music)

1034
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,660
- [Mean Girl #4] No way, I'm
not doing that. That's mean.

1035
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:10,963
- [Mean Girl #3] Fine. Then I will.

1036
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:12,723
Skank.

1037
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:14,520
- What did you say?!?

1038
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:19,660
- I said... skank!

1039
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,957
- What's that?

1040
01:07:20,957 --> 01:07:23,340
(mean girls laugh)

1041
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,419
You guys are dicks!

1042
01:07:25,419 --> 01:07:27,085
[Mean Girl #4] - We didn't print them.

1043
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:34,890
- Damn, look who's
desperate for attention.

1044
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:37,046
Is that how you get guys now?

1045
01:07:37,046 --> 01:07:38,940
- If I find out you had
anything to do with this,

1046
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,020
I'll beat your ass.

1047
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,457
- I'm not afraid of you.
- You should be.

1048
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,090
- I like you all fiery, Deja.

1049
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:44,440
Maybe you could show me in another way.

1050
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,274
(thud to Chad's groin)

1051
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:46,440
(Chad groans)

1052
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,590
- If you ever bother her
again, I'll kill you!

1053
01:07:49,595 --> 01:07:51,528
- Damn dude, you just got dropped.

1054
01:07:51,528 --> 01:07:52,361
- Shut up.

1055
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:54,180
- Aww, we both know you
ain't got none anyway.

1056
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,397
- Just another psycho...lets go.

1057
01:07:58,026 --> 01:08:02,967
(gentle music)

1058
01:08:06,551 --> 01:08:07,384
- Clara.

1059
01:08:08,413 --> 01:08:09,683
Are you okay?

1060
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:12,822
- No, I'm not.

1061
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:16,210
- Okay. Why don't you come
and take a walk with me

1062
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:19,280
and we can talk where
there's less prying eyes.

1063
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,113
Come on.

1064
01:08:25,312 --> 01:08:28,830
Look, we can go over there
and talk on that bench, okay?

1065
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:30,313
Come on, I have some time.

1066
01:08:32,349 --> 01:08:37,349
(gentle music)

1067
01:08:49,267 --> 01:08:50,467
Come on, we have a seat.

1068
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,537
Do you wanna tell me what happened?

1069
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:05,686
- It's embarrassing.

1070
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:10,235
- I can't help you if you don't let me in.

1071
01:09:11,925 --> 01:09:13,258
I do want to help.

1072
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:27,120
But there's nothing covered
up that will not be revealed

1073
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,820
and hidden that will not be known.

1074
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:30,933
- What?

1075
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,440
- The Bible verse at the
bottom of the picture,

1076
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,760
Luke 12:2.

1077
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,123
- What does it mean?

1078
01:09:38,561 --> 01:09:41,390
- Well, Clara, it looks
like somebody thinks

1079
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:43,140
you have a secret they want shared.

1080
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:45,870
Do you have a secret, Clara?

1081
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:47,700
- What? No!

1082
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,620
Why does it even matter?

1083
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:51,340
Somebody took my picture

1084
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:53,553
and shared it without my permission.

1085
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,088
I'm gonna go call my dad.

1086
01:09:56,088 --> 01:09:58,735
Um...Thanks for sitting with me.

1087
01:09:58,735 --> 01:10:03,735
(ominous music)

1088
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,736
- Lying lips are an
abomination to the Lord.

1089
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,240
- [Mr. Banks] Honey, did
Chad take these photos?

1090
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,163
- No, I don't know who did it.

1091
01:10:14,163 --> 01:10:15,621
- [Mr. Banks] Okay, well
I'm literally rushing to

1092
01:10:15,621 --> 01:10:17,490
check out of the hotel now and head home.

1093
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:20,130
- No, you don't need to rush home

1094
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:22,603
but can you call the school?

1095
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:26,200
I can't go back there.

1096
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,280
[Mr. Banks] - Yeah, I'll take care of it.

1097
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,705
- Okay, thanks.

1098
01:10:30,705 --> 01:10:32,405
[Mr. Banks] - We'll figure
this out, sweetheart.

1099
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:37,574
I love you. Be safe and
you remember you call me

1100
01:10:37,574 --> 01:10:39,780
if anything else happens, okay?

1101
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:41,943
- Okay. I'll see you Thursday.

1102
01:10:45,292 --> 01:10:50,192
(somber music)

1103
01:11:06,483 --> 01:11:09,714
(typing on keyboard)

1104
01:11:09,714 --> 01:11:12,214
(instant message chimes)

1105
01:11:14,507 --> 01:11:15,840
(instant message chimes)

1106
01:11:21,341 --> 01:11:22,924
(instant message chimes)

1107
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:25,683
(instant message chimes)

1108
01:11:30,374 --> 01:11:31,207
(instant message chimes)

1109
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:37,769
- Are you kidding me? What's
with all the victim shaming?

1110
01:11:37,769 --> 01:11:40,460
(typing on keyboard)

1111
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,768
(instant message chimes)

1112
01:11:46,542 --> 01:11:48,959
(intense ominous music)

1113
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,593
Yes you are.

1114
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:59,703
This day fucking blows.

1115
01:12:08,421 --> 01:12:11,265
(door bell rings)

1116
01:12:11,265 --> 01:12:13,973
(gentle music)

1117
01:12:15,157 --> 01:12:16,980
- Hey.
- Hey.

1118
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:17,813
- Come in.

1119
01:12:26,846 --> 01:12:29,360
- You all right?
- No, I'm mortified.

1120
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,646
I can never show my face there again.

1121
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,492
- We could get you a mask.

1122
01:12:35,492 --> 01:12:38,170
- You're not helping.
- Sorry.

1123
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:40,121
Just trying to lighten up the mood.

1124
01:12:40,121 --> 01:12:43,559
I, um...

1125
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:45,787
got your homework.
- Thanks.

1126
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:49,940
- What did your dad say?

1127
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:52,810
- Honestly, it was like an interrogation.

1128
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:53,643
- Really?

1129
01:12:53,643 --> 01:12:57,010
- Yeah. It seems like everybody's
pointing the finger at me.

1130
01:12:57,010 --> 01:12:58,960
It's not like I asked for this.

1131
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,990
- Who's pointing the finger at you, Clara?

1132
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:04,030
- Just stop, okay?

1133
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:07,053
It's it's fine..just..I want to be alone!

1134
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:09,953
- All right, then I'll go.

1135
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,023
- Deja wait, wait come back.

1136
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:20,230
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you.

1137
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:21,930
- It's okay, I get it.

1138
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:25,010
I would want to be alone
after a day like today.

1139
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:27,650
- Thank you for bringing me my homework.

1140
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:28,733
- No problem.

1141
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:31,120
You still want me to
come with you tomorrow

1142
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,410
to pick up your car?

1143
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:34,563
- Of course.
- All right.

1144
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:38,615
- See you later.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1145
01:13:45,065 --> 01:13:50,040
(ominous tone)

1146
01:13:57,762 --> 01:14:02,754
(dogs barking in the background)

1147
01:14:07,423 --> 01:14:10,082
(water boiling)

1148
01:14:10,082 --> 01:14:15,032
(crackers breaking)

1149
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,838
- Looks like it's just you
and me again tonight, Fish.

1150
01:14:22,838 --> 01:14:25,505
(knocking on door)

1151
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,478
Hello?

1152
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:52,221
Is anybody there?

1153
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:57,221
(ominous music)

1154
01:14:57,810 --> 01:14:59,277
Whatever.

1155
01:14:59,277 --> 01:15:04,219
(ominous music)

1156
01:15:24,426 --> 01:15:25,259
(Clara sighs)

1157
01:15:37,002 --> 01:15:38,044
(light switch clicks off)

1158
01:15:43,383 --> 01:15:48,349
(intense ominous music)

1159
01:15:51,944 --> 01:15:54,777
(water running)

1160
01:16:17,817 --> 01:16:22,641
(suspenseful music)

1161
01:16:46,784 --> 01:16:51,758
(suspenseful music)

1162
01:17:00,692 --> 01:17:05,642
(music plays on earbuds)

1163
01:17:15,229 --> 01:17:20,188
(ominous music)

1164
01:17:34,623 --> 01:17:39,606
(suspenseful music)

1165
01:17:53,917 --> 01:17:58,900
(suspenseful music intensifies)

1166
01:18:04,377 --> 01:18:05,210
(music stops suddenly)

1167
01:18:26,646 --> 01:18:31,587
(ominous music)

1168
01:18:33,603 --> 01:18:34,436
- What the hell?

1169
01:18:35,936 --> 01:18:38,036
(doorknob rattles)

1170
01:18:38,036 --> 01:18:43,028
(suspenseful music)

1171
01:18:56,744 --> 01:19:00,065
(suspenseful music intensifies)

1172
01:19:00,065 --> 01:19:02,015
(doorknob rattles violently)

1173
01:19:06,066 --> 01:19:09,791
(screams) I thought you
were here to kill me.

1174
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:10,820
- What the hell happened?

1175
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:13,050
- I woke up in that was in my floor.

1176
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:15,080
- Is that blood, who did this?

1177
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,120
- I don't know.

1178
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,625
- We should call the cops.

1179
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:19,058
(phone dials 911)

1180
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:22,060
- [911 Responder] Eden
911, what's your location?

1181
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,690
- Hi, this is Deja Parker,

1182
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:27,900
I'm at 1975 Hallow
Drive, um, someone has...

1183
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,600
- You think it was a prank?

1184
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,940
- No, I don't.

1185
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:31,773
- All right, ladies,

1186
01:19:31,773 --> 01:19:34,210
it looks like everything's clear in there.

1187
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:36,120
If you guys have anything
else you'd like to add,

1188
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,330
just feel free to call
down to the station.

1189
01:19:38,330 --> 01:19:40,995
- Um...okay?
- All right. Thank you.

1190
01:19:40,995 --> 01:19:41,828
- Bye.

1191
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:48,580
Seriously, that didn't
make me feel any better.

1192
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,220
I thought they would've
had the whole team out here

1193
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,400
searching for fingerprints.

1194
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,270
- I guess that just happens on TV.

1195
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:54,910
Are you gonna call your dad?

1196
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:55,910
- There's no point.

1197
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:57,330
He'll probably just think it was a prank

1198
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:58,600
just like the stupid cops.

1199
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,440
- I guess, but don't you think it's weird

1200
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,290
it said Jezebel like your email?

1201
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:04,860
You sure you didn't attract a stalker?

1202
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:06,821
- That's not possible,
how would they find me?

1203
01:20:06,821 --> 01:20:08,071
- I don't know.
(car horn honks)

1204
01:20:15,694 --> 01:20:17,777
What are they doing here?

1205
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,560
- Hey, Mrs. Roberts.
Jacob.

1206
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,590
- Hello, Clara dear.

1207
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:29,140
Just coming by to check on you.

1208
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:30,560
You know, after yesterday.

1209
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,080
- Oh yeah...uh, thanks...

1210
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,540
- We were actually just leaving.

1211
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,160
We need to go pick up Clara's car

1212
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:37,440
and our Uber will be here any moment.

1213
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,450
- Oh, we can take you guys, right mama?

1214
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:41,740
- Of course, I'd love to.

1215
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:44,210
- We really wouldn't wanna
take up too much of your time,

1216
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:45,240
but thank you so much.

1217
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,790
- Nonsense, we're already here.

1218
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:51,692
- Oh, okay. Uh...Sure. Yeah.
- Great.

1219
01:20:51,692 --> 01:20:53,563
All right. Come on girls.

1220
01:20:57,578 --> 01:21:02,294
(van pulling in off busy highway)

1221
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:11,463
- [Clara] Thank you so much for taking us.

1222
01:21:11,463 --> 01:21:13,380
- [Mrs. Roberts] No problem, girls.

1223
01:21:23,983 --> 01:21:25,233
- So what are you wearing?

1224
01:21:26,101 --> 01:21:27,310
(air wrenches in the background)

1225
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:28,253
Sounds hot.

1226
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,610
So you ready for me to come over later?

1227
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:32,770
- He's such a pig.

1228
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:34,420
- I just wanna get my car and go.

1229
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:36,733
- I got this.

1230
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,970
Are you serious? Why
are you so lame, Chad?

1231
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:44,560
- Why you got to be such a bitch, Deja?

1232
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,310
- At least I don't pretend to get action.

1233
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:47,870
- Guys, just stop!

1234
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:50,242
I wanna get my car and go.

1235
01:21:50,242 --> 01:21:52,210
- Pfft! What car?

1236
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:55,540
- Oh, hey Mom, Clara forgot her phone.

1237
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,736
I'm gonna go bring it to her.
I'll be back in a minute.

1238
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:04,036
Clara, you forgot your phone in the car.

1239
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:09,080
- Wow. So you dating this Jesus freak now?

1240
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,460
You really move on to dick fast, huh?

1241
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:12,790
- What is wrong with you?

1242
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:14,488
- Thank you, Jacob.

1243
01:22:14,488 --> 01:22:16,700
- Um...Do you guys have a bathroom?

1244
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:19,998
- Yeah, it's along the
side of the building.

1245
01:22:24,290 --> 01:22:26,210
- The bathroom isn't on
the side of the building.

1246
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:28,000
- I know
- You're so mean.

1247
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,300
- And you're such a skank.

1248
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:32,160
- Micah, can I get those keys

1249
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,750
before I end up with an assault charge?

1250
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:35,583
- [Micah] Yeah.

1251
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:42,120
- You just need to sign right here.

1252
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:46,580
Let's see, James Burke,
Christopher Wilson,

1253
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:50,053
Misty Bowles, Clara Banks...

1254
01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:53,110
sign right there and you'll be good to go.

1255
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,010
- Hey, you okay?

1256
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:04,280
- Yeah. I tripped on the way back here.

1257
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:07,050
- Hon, you got something on your shirt.

1258
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:09,400
- Can we just go?
- Yeah.

1259
01:23:10,248 --> 01:23:13,415
(car engine cranking)

1260
01:23:23,894 --> 01:23:28,894
- I know...
Why would he call me that?

1261
01:23:28,986 --> 01:23:30,569
I don't understand!

1262
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:37,070
(radio static)

1263
01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:39,410
- [Reporter] It's 5:30. This is Tim chase.

1264
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:41,550
The Eden Police Department
is investigating

1265
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:44,650
the second murder to occur
within the last seven days.

1266
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:46,400
A spokesperson for the department said,

1267
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,830
it's the first time in 22 years

1268
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:51,180
that back-to-back murders have occurred.

1269
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:52,760
Now they state there's no cause

1270
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,220
to think the murders
are in any way related?

1271
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:57,210
Well, we'll just have to
take their word on that,

1272
01:23:57,210 --> 01:23:59,830
but keep your doors locked
tonight, Eden. Be safe.

1273
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:01,260
Let's lighten things back up now.

1274
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:03,840
Continuing their run in the
number one Billboard spot,

1275
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,030
it's Sabell with the song...

1276
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:08,320
- Maybe that psycho will get Chad next.

1277
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:12,500
- I wish. He's such a dick.
I can't believe I dated him.

1278
01:24:14,212 --> 01:24:17,854
(car veers around curve fast)

1279
01:24:17,854 --> 01:24:21,210
(engine accelerating)

1280
01:24:21,210 --> 01:24:23,450
- He was just foul back there.

1281
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:26,250
Speaking of foul, it smells
like something died in here.

1282
01:24:27,311 --> 01:24:29,510
(bottle sprays)

1283
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:30,560
Well, that didn't help,

1284
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,580
now it smells like death and flowers.

1285
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:33,910
- Just my freaking luck.

1286
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:36,284
Can this day get any worse?

1287
01:24:36,284 --> 01:24:38,410
(car speeds by fast)

1288
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:40,207
- Forget that jerk, he isn't worth it

1289
01:24:40,207 --> 01:24:41,970
and he definitely isn't worth our lives.

1290
01:24:41,970 --> 01:24:43,618
Slow down, speedy.

1291
01:24:45,806 --> 01:24:46,639
(brake pedal goes to floor)

1292
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:48,305
- Uh...Dej?

1293
01:24:48,305 --> 01:24:49,740
- Clara, slow down.

1294
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:51,500
- I can't!
- What?!?

1295
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,458
- The brakes aren't working!

1296
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:55,752
(pneumatic air sounds)

1297
01:24:55,752 --> 01:24:58,151
Deja, what do I do? Nothing is working!

1298
01:24:58,151 --> 01:25:00,477
- I don't know, I don't know!

1299
01:25:00,477 --> 01:25:03,785
Oh my God, we're going
to hit them! (screams)

1300
01:25:05,154 --> 01:25:06,037
- Clara, we're going to hit
the pole! Oh my God, Oh my God!

1301
01:25:06,037 --> 01:25:06,904
(parking brake pulled)

1302
01:25:06,904 --> 01:25:09,520
(car crashing)

1303
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:14,128
(car idles)

1304
01:25:14,128 --> 01:25:14,989
(car ignition turned off)

1305
01:25:14,989 --> 01:25:18,142
(ominous music)

1306
01:25:18,142 --> 01:25:20,892
(birds chirping)

1307
01:25:27,946 --> 01:25:31,123
- Mom? we were just in an accident.

1308
01:25:35,026 --> 01:25:40,001
We're at Old Blair road...Old
Alabama/Blair road...

1309
01:25:40,913 --> 01:25:41,963
Okay.

1310
01:25:44,542 --> 01:25:49,525
(ominous music)

1311
01:25:50,866 --> 01:25:53,837
Clara?

1312
01:25:53,837 --> 01:25:55,254
My Mom is coming.

1313
01:25:57,203 --> 01:26:00,490
Clara?
- Okay.

1314
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:04,826
Um...I just need to get my purse.

1315
01:26:06,354 --> 01:26:08,312
(keys jerked out of ignition)

1316
01:26:33,187 --> 01:26:35,878
(ominous music intensifies)

1317
01:26:35,878 --> 01:26:37,710
- [Deja] What's wrong?

1318
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:39,195
- Oh my God...what?

1319
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:43,253
- What's that?

1320
01:26:46,371 --> 01:26:49,038
(Clara panting)

1321
01:26:55,426 --> 01:26:58,176
(birds chirping)

1322
01:27:01,671 --> 01:27:06,555
(police sirens)

1323
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:13,082
(gentle music)

1324
01:27:15,910 --> 01:27:18,910
- So Ms. Banks, can you think of anyone

1325
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:19,743
that would wanna hurt you?

1326
01:27:19,743 --> 01:27:22,388
- No, I get along with most people.

1327
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,103
- [Investigator] Most people.

1328
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:29,480
- I mean recently my
boyfriend Chad, and I broke up

1329
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:32,766
and he did send me a text
saying that I would regret it.

1330
01:27:32,766 --> 01:27:33,599
- What?

1331
01:27:33,599 --> 01:27:35,840
- Is this the same Chad
that works at the garage

1332
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,420
that recently worked on your vehicle?

1333
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:38,445
- Yes.

1334
01:27:38,445 --> 01:27:40,132
- You didn't think to tell me about that?

1335
01:27:40,132 --> 01:27:41,399
- Dad...it's fine.

1336
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:43,993
- Okay.

1337
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:46,970
Well, Ms. Banks, I think
that's all we need for now.

1338
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:47,803
- No, it's not.

1339
01:27:47,803 --> 01:27:49,520
You're gonna go arrest
this guy, aren't you?

1340
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,600
- Mr. Banks first, we have
to question everyone involved

1341
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,710
to further our investigation.

1342
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:55,880
- He tried to kill my baby girl!

1343
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,323
Do you understand that?

1344
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,150
- Mr. Banks though I do
understand your anger,

1345
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,550
please understand that we have to review

1346
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:03,633
all of the evidence.

1347
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:06,230
- Yeah.

1348
01:28:06,230 --> 01:28:07,920
- Clara, are you ready?

1349
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,553
Let's go.
- Okay.

1350
01:28:19,041 --> 01:28:20,891
(tense music)

1351
01:28:20,891 --> 01:28:22,327
- If you ever come near my daughter again,

1352
01:28:22,327 --> 01:28:24,296
and I swear to God-
- Get your hands-

1353
01:28:24,296 --> 01:28:25,335
(both scuffle)

1354
01:28:25,335 --> 01:28:27,438
- [Detective] Hey! Hey! Hey!
I cannot believe this...

1355
01:28:27,438 --> 01:28:30,002
- Enough! Get in there!

1356
01:28:30,002 --> 01:28:31,243
Get in there!

1357
01:28:33,656 --> 01:28:34,906
Have a seat.

1358
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:41,340
Do you even know why you
were brought in today?

1359
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:42,173
- I don't know.

1360
01:28:42,173 --> 01:28:43,180
Maybe because my ex is a bitch

1361
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:45,160
that whines over stupid shit.

1362
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:46,750
- You think what happened was stupid?

1363
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:49,560
- Yeah, since when was dog shit on fire

1364
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,950
and a mouse prank
warrant an interrogation?

1365
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:53,333
- Chad shut your mouth.

1366
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:57,300
Listen, if you wanna charge
my son with anything,

1367
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:58,930
you can speak with our lawyer.

1368
01:28:58,930 --> 01:29:00,780
- Sir, we are questioning everyone

1369
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:03,010
that came in contact
with Ms. Banks vehicle.

1370
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:06,123
We're not charging your
son with anything, yet.

1371
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,821
But if you feel you need a
lawyer, no one's stopping you.

1372
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:13,130
- Are we done?

1373
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:14,423
- I have another question.

1374
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:18,290
Chad, did you cut Clara's brake lines?

1375
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:23,166
- What? No. Dad I swear-
- Son I know. Are we done yet?

1376
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:26,460
- I have what I need at the moment.

1377
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:28,533
- Then we're leaving. Chad let's go.

1378
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:35,281
- Mr. Michaels, don't leave town.

1379
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,013
I might still need some more information.

1380
01:29:41,361 --> 01:29:43,111
(crickets chirping)

1381
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:48,454
- I cannot believe that
the day is almost over.

1382
01:29:48,454 --> 01:29:49,804
You want me to make you something to eat?

1383
01:29:49,804 --> 01:29:52,350
- No, I'm just gonna go up to my room.

1384
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:55,271
- Clara, you know you
can talk to me, right?

1385
01:29:55,271 --> 01:29:56,104
- I know.

1386
01:30:06,544 --> 01:30:11,528
(sorrowful music)

1387
01:30:31,394 --> 01:30:32,644
I miss you mom...

1388
01:30:33,727 --> 01:30:35,344
I really need you right now.

1389
01:30:35,344 --> 01:30:38,678
(sorrowful music)

1390
01:30:49,014 --> 01:30:50,255
(cabinet shuts)

1391
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:57,190
- I feel bad for the kid.

1392
01:30:58,540 --> 01:30:59,373
- Feel bad for whom?

1393
01:30:59,373 --> 01:31:01,673
- I feel bad for Clara, of course.

1394
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:04,310
- Why?

1395
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:05,940
- Well, she must be scared.

1396
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:07,290
Accidents are always scary.

1397
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:11,480
We should add her to our prayer list.

1398
01:31:12,515 --> 01:31:15,050
- I'll pray she stays
away from my husband.

1399
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:16,210
- I'm sorry, what was that hon?

1400
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:17,688
- I was agreeing with you.

1401
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:21,800
- Well, I'll be back in a few hours.

1402
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:22,645
- Where are you going?

1403
01:31:22,645 --> 01:31:25,500
- Uh...Bowling with the boys.

1404
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,383
- Bowling, I thought that was on Friday.

1405
01:31:27,383 --> 01:31:29,270
- With Halloween being
on Friday this year,

1406
01:31:29,270 --> 01:31:31,730
we just thought we'd just
go ahead and go tonight.

1407
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:34,020
- Oh, okay.

1408
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:35,360
- Are...are you okay?

1409
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,620
I can stay home if you'd like.

1410
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:39,949
- No, go have fun. Tell the boys said hi.

1411
01:31:39,949 --> 01:31:41,090
- Okay

1412
01:31:42,919 --> 01:31:47,919
(ominous music)

1413
01:31:48,254 --> 01:31:49,295
(water dumped out)

1414
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:50,170
(cup slammed on counter)

1415
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:58,330
[Voice in Mrs. Roberts Head]
Oh, let's pray for Clara.

1416
01:31:58,330 --> 01:32:01,253
Yeah Clara must've been so scared!

1417
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:06,250
Poor Clara, there's
nothing poor about that

1418
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:11,195
husband stealing witch. (water splashing)

1419
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:17,638
He never changes bowling
night, what am I thinking?

1420
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:22,260
He's probably meeting
up with her right now.

1421
01:32:27,642 --> 01:32:31,142
(ominous music)

1422
01:32:32,216 --> 01:32:34,124
(dogs barking in the distance)

1423
01:32:35,307 --> 01:32:38,482
- Huh..Jezebel and Clara
have a lot in common.

1424
01:32:39,532 --> 01:32:41,157
Both are harlots.

1425
01:32:41,157 --> 01:32:42,060
(finger taps Bible)

1426
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:46,500
But Jezebel fell and
one day Clara will too.

1427
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:50,776
Everything unholy will come to light.

1428
01:32:52,472 --> 01:32:55,305
(door bell rings)

1429
01:32:57,686 --> 01:33:00,353
(impatient knocking on door)

1430
01:33:07,829 --> 01:33:10,329
(tense music)

1431
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:13,073
- Clara?

1432
01:33:16,729 --> 01:33:18,250
What are you doing here?

1433
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:19,920
- I think you know.

1434
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,970
- No, I don't.

1435
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:24,600
We're supposed to meet
at the church tomorrow.

1436
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:28,993
- My sweet Bett...my
plans are not with you.

1437
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:32,946
Is your husband home?

1438
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:36,930
- You stay away from my husband.

1439
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:39,320
I think I've been more
than patient with you.

1440
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:42,170
- (scoffs) Funny you say patient,

1441
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:44,433
we played doctor just the other day.

1442
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:47,013
- What's wrong with you?

1443
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:52,476
- Wrong? Nothing's wrong.

1444
01:33:52,476 --> 01:33:56,476
It felt so right.

1445
01:33:56,476 --> 01:34:00,530
- You bitch! Stay away from my family,

1446
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:02,125
You stay away from my husband!

1447
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:06,216
You are nothing but a harlot of Babylon.

1448
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:11,810
- Um...Mom, who are you talking to?

1449
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:15,629
- Clara is here.
- No, she's not.

1450
01:34:15,629 --> 01:34:19,700
- But she's right, no, no...she...

1451
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:21,713
She's was right here!

1452
01:34:21,713 --> 01:34:23,996
I...uh...

1453
01:34:23,996 --> 01:34:27,054
No... she was right here!

1454
01:34:27,054 --> 01:34:28,454
My God...I..

1455
01:34:30,221 --> 01:34:31,962
(pill bottle rattles)

1456
01:34:31,962 --> 01:34:33,470
- [Jacob] Do you want me to
help you walk you to bed?

1457
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:37,237
- No. I'm fine, it's...um...

1458
01:34:37,237 --> 01:34:38,928
It's okay. Goodnight.

1459
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,850
Don't get too close to Clara, son.

1460
01:34:43,850 --> 01:34:45,905
She's a weed in God's garden.

1461
01:34:54,978 --> 01:34:57,728
(birds chirping)

1462
01:35:01,232 --> 01:35:03,373
- Hey guys?
- Oh my God, Clara.

1463
01:35:04,466 --> 01:35:07,057
- I am so happy you're not dead!

1464
01:35:07,057 --> 01:35:08,560
- Me too.

1465
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,326
- Oh man, I was so worried about you.

1466
01:35:11,326 --> 01:35:13,951
(Pickup truck passes by)

1467
01:35:17,428 --> 01:35:18,261
[Deja] - Feel better?

1468
01:35:18,261 --> 01:35:19,462
[Clara] - Yeah

1469
01:35:19,462 --> 01:35:21,603
[Kimmy] - Seriously...can
you learn how to drive?

1470
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,143
- What is he doing here?

1471
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:29,820
- Mr. Green, I'm so glad you're here.

1472
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:31,530
Well, we shouldn't be here too long today.

1473
01:35:31,530 --> 01:35:32,960
We'd like to put up
most of the decorations

1474
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,160
right before the event starts,

1475
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,230
but things like the banners

1476
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:37,600
we like to put up the day before.

1477
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,994
Jacob, can you help me with that ladder?

1478
01:35:39,994 --> 01:35:40,827
- Okay.

1479
01:35:42,410 --> 01:35:43,890
- You can join the rest of the group.

1480
01:35:43,890 --> 01:35:45,690
I'm sure you already know everybody.

1481
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:53,678
- Hey.
- Hey Micah.

1482
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:59,980
- Hey..um...Deja, can I
talk to you for a minute?

1483
01:36:00,257 --> 01:36:02,407
- You can say whatever
you want right here.

1484
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:04,921
- Okay...umm...

1485
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,503
I..uh...wanted to say I was sorry.

1486
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:13,421
- I shouldn't have messed
with your grades like that.

1487
01:36:15,339 --> 01:36:17,460
- What?!?
- He said he was sorry.

1488
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:18,293
- And?!?

1489
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:24,660
- So...you wanna tell me how you did that?

1490
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:27,130
Because my grades could use
a little bit of a pick-me-up,

1491
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:28,080
if you know what I'm saying...

1492
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:29,070
- I...um...
- Don't worry.

1493
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:31,900
I'm not trying to hit on
you. You're not my type.

1494
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:34,610
- Don't take it personal,
no man's her type.

1495
01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:35,693
- That's true.

1496
01:36:39,773 --> 01:36:42,200
- Hey everyone, well, here's the banners

1497
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,720
that we'll be painting.

1498
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:44,553
Once you get that done,

1499
01:36:44,553 --> 01:36:46,420
we can hang it up above
the entrance, okay?

1500
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:48,010
I have some stuff to do inside,

1501
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:50,173
so if you need anything, just ask Jacob.

1502
01:36:51,133 --> 01:36:52,432
(banner stuffed hard into Clara's stomach)

1503
01:37:03,373 --> 01:37:06,374
- [Kimmy] Is this paint?
- [Clara] Yeah...

1504
01:37:06,374 --> 01:37:11,316
(gentle upbeat music)

1505
01:38:03,330 --> 01:38:06,483
- Wow. Great job guys,
it looks really good.

1506
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,350
You have paint on your shirt, Kimmy.

1507
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:13,620
- Oh man, this is my favorite jacket.

1508
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:14,830
- I can get that out for you.

1509
01:38:14,830 --> 01:38:17,110
- No, it's fine. It's just a jacket.

1510
01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:18,270
- No, I insist.

1511
01:38:18,270 --> 01:38:21,610
Especially with all your help
today, I'll take care of it.

1512
01:38:21,610 --> 01:38:22,748
Good job guys.

1513
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,930
- We did a really good job.
- Yeah we did.

1514
01:38:28,930 --> 01:38:30,355
- What do you think, Kimmy?

1515
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,490
- Earth to Kimmy, you with us?

1516
01:38:34,490 --> 01:38:37,070
- No, you guys are really boring.

1517
01:38:37,070 --> 01:38:39,010
Did you hear about this
guy who got murdered?

1518
01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:40,720
- There were two murders,

1519
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,960
and isn't that the one
that was on the news?

1520
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,810
- Yeah, actually it was
behind your house Jacob.

1521
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:49,210
- It was probably the guy
who broke into our shed.

1522
01:38:49,210 --> 01:38:51,890
He stole a shovel and a couple of tools.

1523
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:53,280
Looks like Karma got him.

1524
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:56,070
- Wow, you're the last person
I expected to hear that from,

1525
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:58,700
aren't you supposed to be
all turn the other cheek?

1526
01:38:58,700 --> 01:38:59,900
- Back in biblical times,

1527
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:02,120
you could kill a thief if
you caught them in the act.

1528
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:03,665
- That's a little harsh.

1529
01:39:06,290 --> 01:39:08,290
- So are we gonna to put this banner up?

1530
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:10,573
Or what?

1531
01:39:14,259 --> 01:39:17,770
(birds chirping)

1532
01:39:17,770 --> 01:39:21,276
- what is this?
- Jack O'lantern pancakes!

1533
01:39:21,276 --> 01:39:23,500
- It looks like a deranged clown.

1534
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,970
- Well let's hope that
these deranged clowns

1535
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:26,441
at least taste good.

1536
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,610
- I love you, dad.
- I love you too.

1537
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:35,289
So...uh...the sheriff
was here this morning

1538
01:39:35,289 --> 01:39:37,810
and they're still looking
into trying to figure out,

1539
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:41,343
I guess, who was all
involved in that accident,

1540
01:39:41,343 --> 01:39:44,060
but, the stay away order
has been placed on Chad.

1541
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:46,380
So he's not gonna be bothering you again.

1542
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:48,010
- Thank you.

1543
01:39:48,010 --> 01:39:50,120
- I gotta protect my baby.

1544
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:52,950
All right, so listen, after
we get done with breakfast,

1545
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:56,610
I was thinking...maybe
we can carve our pumpkins

1546
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:57,820
and keep those demons away.

1547
01:39:57,820 --> 01:40:01,193
- Honestly, that would be nice.

1548
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,050
These are pretty good.

1549
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:09,206
- Not bad for deranged clowns, right?

1550
01:40:09,206 --> 01:40:11,198
- Right.

- [Reporter] Eden Tennessee
has been plagued by several,

1577
01:41:47,538 --> 01:41:48,796
mysterious murders.

1578
01:41:48,796 --> 01:41:50,240
unfortunately, as of right now,

1579
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:52,140
the police are unable to determine

1580
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:53,561

Come on!

01:42:20,579 --> 01:42:21,865
- [Reporter] Approximately
10 PM last night

...residents of the windward area

1591
01:42:23,539 --> 01:42:25,853

that witnesses described...

1593
01:42:27,230 --> 01:42:30,240
- [Reporter] Screams and cries for help.

1594
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:32,112
When investigators arrived on the scene,

1595
01:42:32,112 --> 01:42:36,222
they were unable to determine
the cause of the disturbance.

1596
01:42:36,222 --> 01:42:41,222
(ominous music transitions
to gentle music)

1597
01:42:49,212 --> 01:42:54,087
(crowd noise in background)

1598
01:43:08,079 --> 01:43:11,067
(children laughing)

1599
01:43:11,067 --> 01:43:12,967
(popcorn popping)

1600
01:43:46,255 --> 01:43:47,823
- Trick or treat!

1601
01:43:47,823 --> 01:43:50,306
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

1602
01:43:50,306 --> 01:43:51,599
- 'Cause the devil might get you!

1603
01:43:51,599 --> 01:43:52,432
- Rawr!

1604
01:43:52,432 --> 01:43:55,099
(kids giggling)

1605
01:43:56,725 --> 01:43:58,803
- Man, I miss the good old days.

1606
01:44:00,610 --> 01:44:01,850
- Good old days?

1607
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:04,890
- Yeah. You know, when people
used to go door to door.

1608
01:44:04,890 --> 01:44:06,963
- Mom says this is much safer.

1609
01:44:09,401 --> 01:44:10,234
- I guess.

1610
01:44:16,996 --> 01:44:20,563
(ominous music)

1611
01:44:24,730 --> 01:44:26,343
- You wanna see me die...

1612
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:28,103
don't you?

1613
01:44:33,147 --> 01:44:35,163
You wanna watch me bleed.

1614
01:44:36,709 --> 01:44:37,748
(laughs manically)

1615
01:44:37,748 --> 01:44:38,581
- What?

1616
01:44:44,101 --> 01:44:47,211
(tense music)

1617
01:44:47,211 --> 01:44:48,461
(giggles manically)

1618
01:44:51,516 --> 01:44:52,349
- Uh...

1619
01:44:53,970 --> 01:44:55,746
- Hey! We're out of candy.

1620
01:44:58,717 --> 01:44:59,950
- I...um...

1621
01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:03,473
I'll be right there.

1622
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:17,613
- Mrs. Roberts, we were wondering
if we could go see Kimmy?

1623
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:21,883
- Yeah. It's fine, thanks for your help.

1624
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:25,310
- Where are they going?

1625
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:26,896
- To check on Kimmy.

1626
01:45:26,896 --> 01:45:28,290
- Is she okay?

1627
01:45:28,290 --> 01:45:30,030
- Well, she's supposed to be here today

1628
01:45:30,030 --> 01:45:31,780
and they still haven't heard from her.

1629
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:36,772
I can stop at Clara's later
and check in on her, okay?

1630
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:45,910
- Oh, Hey Micah, can you pack
this up in the van for me?

1631
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:47,320
- Sure.

1632
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:48,540
- Hey, thanks for your help today.

1633
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:49,373
- No problem.

1634
01:45:50,769 --> 01:45:55,485
(gentle music)

1635
01:45:59,834 --> 01:46:00,784
- What the hell?

1636
01:46:05,371 --> 01:46:10,279
(suspenseful music)

1637
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,530
- Shit! Dude.

1638
01:46:18,530 --> 01:46:19,860
Didn't mean to scare you,

1639
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:22,310
mom wanted to know if you needed a ride.

1640
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:23,703
- No, I'm okay.

1641
01:46:24,948 --> 01:46:25,960
- Are you sure?

1642
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:28,500
- Yeah...I uh, I think I'll walk.

1643
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:29,878
It's nice night for a walk.

1644
01:46:29,878 --> 01:46:34,308
(gentle music)

1645
01:46:34,308 --> 01:46:36,360
- [Clara] I can't
believe Kimmy ditched us.

1646
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:38,040
- [Deja] She probably
didn't wanna be caught dead

1647
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39,570
in this angel costume.

1648
01:46:39,570 --> 01:46:40,690
- I guess...

1649
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:44,628
- You sure you don't want
to go to the party with me?

1650
01:46:44,628 --> 01:46:47,723
- [Clara] Yeah, I think
I'll just stay home.

1651
01:46:47,723 --> 01:46:50,040
- All right. I'll head out then.

1652
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,770
- Okay. Be safe.

1653
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:54,200
- I will. Call me if you change your mind.

1654
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:55,033
- I will.

1655
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:05,341
Dad, are you home?

1656
01:47:11,906 --> 01:47:16,898
(ominous music)

1657
01:47:28,332 --> 01:47:30,847
(door bell rings)

1658
01:47:30,847 --> 01:47:35,739
(ominous music)

1659
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:55,528
I guess those masks are popular this year.

1660
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:01,375
Aren't you a little too old
to be trick or treating?

1661
01:48:01,375 --> 01:48:06,350
(tense music)

1662
01:48:10,168 --> 01:48:11,860
You know what?

1663
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:15,823
It's whatever, we have candy left anyway.

1664
01:48:16,996 --> 01:48:21,763
(tense music)

1665
01:48:23,252 --> 01:48:24,095
(door slams)

1666
01:48:24,095 --> 01:48:25,286
(candy grabbed hastily)

1667
01:48:30,450 --> 01:48:34,410
Oh, ha ha. You're so scary.

1668
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:38,169
Just take the candy and go.

1669
01:48:38,169 --> 01:48:40,430
Let go of me, what are you doing?

1670
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:44,963
Let go of... (screams)

1671
01:48:46,185 --> 01:48:49,302
(stabbing sound)

1672
01:48:49,302 --> 01:48:50,997
(kick impacts)

1673
01:48:50,997 --> 01:48:52,164
(wall impact)

1674
01:48:52,164 --> 01:48:56,072
(Clara weeps and pants)

1675
01:48:56,072 --> 01:49:00,191
(music intensifies)

1676
01:49:02,808 --> 01:49:07,807
(Clara gasps in pain)

1677
01:49:21,226 --> 01:49:23,376
(door shut and locked)

1678
01:49:55,833 --> 01:49:58,141
(knife scrapes along railing)

1679
01:50:00,417 --> 01:50:05,417
(tense music intensifies)

1680
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:23,021
(doorknob rattles)

1681
01:50:26,112 --> 01:50:28,462
(doorknob unlocks and door opens)

1682
01:50:32,766 --> 01:50:37,100
(door creaks open)

1683
01:50:47,861 --> 01:50:52,735
(crickets and dogs in background)

1684
01:50:54,017 --> 01:50:55,683
(music stops)

1685
01:51:09,428 --> 01:51:14,353
(footsteps squeak)

1686
01:51:19,496 --> 01:51:22,846
(crickets and dogs in background)

1687
01:51:29,867 --> 01:51:31,725
(Clara weeps)

1688
01:51:42,446 --> 01:51:47,129
(tense music resumes)

1689
01:51:48,961 --> 01:51:50,227
- Please don't...

1690
01:51:51,570 --> 01:51:53,590
(Clara screams)

1691
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:54,424
(knife impales wood floor)

1692
01:51:54,424 --> 01:51:55,257
(skull impacts against dresser)

1693
01:51:55,257 --> 01:51:57,324
(body hits floor hard)

1694
01:51:57,324 --> 01:52:02,282
(heartbeat pounding)

1695
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:09,385
(ominous music)

1696
01:52:09,385 --> 01:52:14,318
(heartbeat pounding)

1697
01:52:20,746 --> 01:52:23,136
(Clara sobs)

1698
01:52:23,136 --> 01:52:26,149
(suspenseful music)

1699
01:52:26,149 --> 01:52:29,857
(blood trickles down drain)

1700
01:52:49,043 --> 01:52:50,418
(shower curtain slides open)

1701
01:53:01,446 --> 01:53:03,387
(shower curtain slides open)

1702
01:53:04,530 --> 01:53:06,138
(knocking on front door)

1703
01:53:07,976 --> 01:53:10,409
(Clara weeps)

1704
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:15,400
(back door opens in distance)

1705
01:53:18,204 --> 01:53:20,104
(pounding on glass on front door)

1706
01:53:21,426 --> 01:53:24,876
(Clara gasps in pain)

1707
01:53:27,850 --> 01:53:29,616
(Clara gasps in pain)

1708
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:03,330
(tense music)

1709
01:54:05,771 --> 01:54:06,604
(Clara drags her injured leg)

1710
01:54:09,042 --> 01:54:14,017
(music intensifies)

1711
01:54:16,461 --> 01:54:17,567
(Clara screams)

1712
01:54:17,567 --> 01:54:18,400
(stabbing sounds)

1713
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,476
(Clara screams)

1714
01:54:19,476 --> 01:54:20,309
(rubber mask hits deck)

1715
01:54:21,181 --> 01:54:22,790
(Mrs. Roberts coughs)

1716
01:54:24,624 --> 01:54:25,457
- WHY?!

1717
01:54:28,646 --> 01:54:30,912
(blood gurgling sounds)

1718
01:54:32,501 --> 01:54:37,242
(Clara sobs)

1719
01:54:47,204 --> 01:54:48,437
(pencil lands in blood)

1720
01:54:49,417 --> 01:54:53,935
(gentle music plays)

1721
01:54:53,935 --> 01:54:56,993
(police chatter from radios)

1722
01:55:03,755 --> 01:55:05,430
- Okay, you're all set now.

1723
01:55:05,430 --> 01:55:06,310
When you get to the hospital,

1724
01:55:06,310 --> 01:55:08,340
you are gonna have to have stitches, okay?

1725
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:09,173
- Okay.

1726
01:55:13,170 --> 01:55:14,203
- Here you go, sweetie.

1727
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:20,090
This is to help you, okay?

1728
01:55:20,090 --> 01:55:20,923
Until you get to the hospital.

1729
01:55:20,923 --> 01:55:23,229
They will
get you another.

1730
01:55:23,229 --> 01:55:24,062
Alright?

1731
01:55:24,062 --> 01:55:24,895
- Okay.

1732
01:55:30,270 --> 01:55:32,280
Why are you here, Micah?

1733
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:36,550
- I found something in the
back of Mrs. Roberts' van...

1734
01:55:36,550 --> 01:55:37,800
there were photos of you.

1735
01:55:38,770 --> 01:55:40,323
I thought you should know about it.

1736
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:44,490
- Were you the one that
knocked on my door?

1737
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:47,530
- No, I was on your front
step and I rang the doorbell.

1738
01:55:47,530 --> 01:55:50,880
And next thing I know there's
a pain in the back of my head,

1739
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:52,103
and I woke up in the bush.

1740
01:55:53,129 --> 01:55:56,389
I would have never thought
Mrs. Roberts was...violent.

1741
01:55:56,389 --> 01:56:00,353
(gentle music)

1742
01:56:00,353 --> 01:56:04,136
(car pulls up and parks)

1743
01:56:07,593 --> 01:56:09,960
(Mr. Banks runs across grass)

1744
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:11,262
(sirens blaring)

1745
01:56:11,262 --> 01:56:16,261
(Clara begins sobbing)

1746
01:56:17,519 --> 01:56:21,805
(gurney rattles as EMTs
bring out Mrs. Roberts)

1747
01:56:21,805 --> 01:56:26,721
(gentle music)

1748
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:38,070
- [Reporter] For WGET, I'm Tim Chase.

1749
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:40,720
Authorities this morning are
investigating a horrific scene

1750
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:43,030
that occurred late last
night on Hallow Drive.

1751
01:56:43,030 --> 01:56:44,750
An Eden police departments spokesperson

1752
01:56:44,750 --> 01:56:46,940
said 18-year-old Clara
Banks of Eden, Tennessee

1753
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:49,910
was attacked by Betty
Roberts, 42, also of Eden.

1754
01:56:49,910 --> 01:56:51,720
Ms. Banks suffered multiple stab wounds,

1755
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:53,220
but was able to fend off her attacker,

1756
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:54,980
which led to the death of Roberts.

1757
01:56:54,980 --> 01:56:56,850
Betty Roberts had no prior arrest record

1758
01:56:56,850 --> 01:56:57,990
nor history of violence,

1759
01:56:57,990 --> 01:57:00,080
but sources tell us she
is now the prime suspect

1760
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:02,720
in two murders that occurred
earlier this week in Eden.

1761
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,930
In a related story,

1762
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:05,740
authorities are beginning
a search this morning

1763
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:06,870
for Kimmy Nichols.

1764
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:10,780
Nichols, 20 of Eden, went
missing the day before Halloween.

1765
01:57:10,780 --> 01:57:12,630
Nichols is a close friend of
Clara Banks (faintly speaking)

1766
01:57:12,630 --> 01:57:14,406
and attends Oak Ridge state college.

1767
01:57:14,406 --> 01:57:18,225
(ominous music)

1768
01:57:18,225 --> 01:57:22,683
(police radio chatter in background)

1769
01:57:22,683 --> 01:57:25,260
- So tox screening analysis
of Mrs. Roberts revealed

1770
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:27,160
that she'd been given
the wrong medication...

1771
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:30,663
resulting in severe side effects.

1772
01:57:31,660 --> 01:57:33,850
After looking at the deceased'
computer we found emails

1773
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:36,199
sent to your daughter's email address.

1774
01:57:36,199 --> 01:57:38,590
It seems Mrs. Roberts had been
fixated on you for some time,

1775
01:57:38,590 --> 01:57:40,750
probably the result of the medication.

1776
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:45,053
Side effects included paranoia,
hallucination, agitation...

1777
01:57:45,053 --> 01:57:50,020
(ominous music)

1778
01:57:54,935 --> 01:57:59,370
(upbeat music)

1779
01:57:59,370 --> 01:58:02,467
- Do you have a date tonight?
- No, no, no...

1780
01:58:02,467 --> 01:58:06,821
(upbeat music)

1781
01:58:06,821 --> 01:58:10,210
(students chattering)

1782
01:58:10,210 --> 01:58:12,802
- Maybe I do have a date.
- That's cute.

1783
01:58:12,802 --> 01:58:13,728

1784
01:58:13,728 --> 01:58:18,686
(upbeat music)

1785
01:58:23,028 --> 01:58:23,861
- Carmel...

1786
01:58:31,497 --> 01:58:36,005
(ominous music)

1787
01:58:38,812 --> 01:58:39,646
- You okay?

1788
01:58:39,646 --> 01:58:40,487
- Mmm hmm...

1789
01:58:40,487 --> 01:58:41,787
(Clara choking)

1790
01:58:41,787 --> 01:58:43,065
Clara, what's wrong?

1791
01:58:43,065 --> 01:58:43,966
(candy crashes to the floor)

1792
01:58:43,966 --> 01:58:44,807
(Clara gasping)

1793
01:58:44,807 --> 01:58:46,454
- Clara?!?
What's wrong?

1794
01:58:46,454 --> 01:58:47,789
(Clara choking)

1795
01:58:47,789 --> 01:58:49,510
Clara?

1796
01:58:49,510 --> 01:58:51,496
Someone call 911 now!

1797
01:58:51,496 --> 01:58:53,668
(Clara gasping)

1798
01:58:53,668 --> 01:58:54,950
Oh my God...Clara!

1799
01:58:54,950 --> 01:58:56,442
(Clara gasping for air)

1800
01:58:56,442 --> 01:58:59,776
Somebody call an ambulance now!

1801
01:58:59,776 --> 01:59:00,832
(Clara coughs)

1802
01:59:00,832 --> 01:59:02,615
Call 911!!!

1803
01:59:03,846 --> 01:59:04,971
Clara!

1804
01:59:06,125 --> 01:59:11,017
(ominous music)

1805
01:59:13,731 --> 01:59:15,398
Clara?!? Clara!
- Is she okay?

1806
01:59:16,976 --> 01:59:17,893
- Call 911!

1807
01:59:20,043 --> 01:59:20,876
Clara!

1808
01:59:20,876 --> 01:59:23,529
- [Student] Oh my
goodness. What's happening?

1809
01:59:23,529 --> 01:59:28,529
(gentle somber music begins)

1810
01:59:52,528 --> 01:59:55,336
- Looks like angels. (laughs)

1811
01:59:55,336 --> 02:00:00,069
- [Kimmy] Angels... (everyone laughs)

1812
02:00:00,069 --> 02:00:01,229
- Hey hon, dinner's ready.
