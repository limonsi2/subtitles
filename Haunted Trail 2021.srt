3
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,827
What are you wearing Portia?

4
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:38,448
Whatever Zay likes.

5
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:45,827
Here you go!

6
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,586
What Jackie?

7
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,620
That man don't want you.

8
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:51,000
He doesn't know what he wants.

9
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:52,793
He knows he doesn't want you.

10
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:53,448
See.

11
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:05,000
How long have you
known Zay, Portia?

12
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:05,965
Oh, wow!

13
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,862
Come on man, come on. Crazy!

14
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:15,827
I don't want that man.

15
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,482
I'm not doing this with you.

16
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,551
Yeah. Come on, yes

17
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:19,517
I'm not doing this.

18
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:21,034
How long, tell me. Do it.

19
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:23,103
I'm not doing this with
you. I'm not doing this.

20
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:23,965
Do it.

21
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,862
Since middle school.

22
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:30,034
Okay, here we are
now in college,

23
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:34,551
and he hasn't asked you
on a date, kiss you,

24
00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:36,379
said he saw he's
more than a friend.

25
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:40,000
I mean no, but like.

26
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:41,827
Okay, then my case
here is closed.

27
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:46,517
Oh, Portia!

28
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:48,137
I don't know what it is,
nobody like that girl.

29
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:50,965
What? She bad though.
Is she persistent?

30
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,137
Persistent.

31
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:53,517
Oh, that's what you
call her? Persistent?

32
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:56,379
Look man that girl love you.
Cool.

33
00:05:56,413 --> 00:05:58,620
And no matter what you do
she's still here that's
called loyalty my boy.

34
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,413
Loyalty.

35
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:05,448
Man, whatever! Craig, what you
think? Tell me what you think?

36
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:07,758
I mean look she a little
high maintenance, but.

37
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:09,448
She good for you bro.

38
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:11,758
She ain't nothing too crazy
for you. Crazy about you.

39
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:13,448
What happened?
Man.

40
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:16,034
I mean you look at it like
this, if you go to the league,

41
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:18,034
you ain't gotta worry about
trying to take your prayer
because some momma got

42
00:06:18,068 --> 00:06:19,758
mad money, bro.

43
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:22,000
See that's the point, right,
baba got bread but she don't.

44
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:23,724
But look she's always
been like fabulous,

45
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,517
man, would y'all want me
date my sister or something?

46
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:25,965
Yep.

47
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:28,896
Whatever man, let's go.

48
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:33,965
Like I said he doesn't
know what he wants.

49
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:41,931
You know you want Portia there.

50
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:44,655
Why are you talking about
her? Talk about some business.

51
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:47,586
I mean, man, if you
feeling Portia, you feeling
Portia. Whatever man.

52
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,724
I know who I'm
feeling. She pretty.

53
00:06:49,758 --> 00:06:51,034
Yeah, your mama pretty too.

54
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:53,206
Oh, he gotta go
with the mama jokes.

55
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:55,620
Oh, I believe so early anyway.

56
00:06:55,655 --> 00:06:58,551
You already know why we
leave me early, so I get
some of these new girls,

57
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,758
new girls.

58
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:02,793
And you know I'm surprised
y'all wanting to go
to the trailer anyway.

59
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:03,931
What you mean?

60
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,620
What?

61
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:08,000
You know I mean the girls
want to be scared out
there tonight. I know,

62
00:07:08,034 --> 00:07:08,586
that's what I know.
Oh. That's what we went on a man

63
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,275
like me. Man, exactly.

64
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,586
And you want to keep
coming out to the Portia,

65
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,551
we ain't got no time
for that. Finally, said
y'all boys agree on.

66
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:16,655
Of course.

67
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:17,827
Hold on.

68
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:19,137
I also said meet up at night.

69
00:07:22,862 --> 00:07:26,620
Yes, sir, we are on for now.

70
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:28,586
Oh, we're going to attend.

71
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,689
It is.

72
00:07:30,655 --> 00:07:32,689
Only on that free time.

73
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:35,689
Exactly. Let's not
forget your complexion.

74
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:39,620
Right. So, I'm supposed
to be walking some trail.

75
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:41,862
I told you a thousand
times, Jordan.

76
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,689
It's a haunted trail.

77
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:45,103
It's like a haunted
house but you're just
going through the woods.

78
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:46,827
Bro, I bet that shit
ain't even scary.

79
00:07:46,862 --> 00:07:49,137
Well, I'm tired of doing the
same damn things, alright.

80
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:51,517
If you don't want to come
with us and be a part
of the Halloween spirit

81
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,206
then just stay your ass home.
Chill.

82
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:56,034
No, bruh! Cause you always got
something to complain about.

83
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:59,034
Bro, complain? Bro, I wasn't
complaining. I was working
your mom's last night.

84
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:01,620
Shut up. Just shut up.
Hey, guys!

85
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:05,793
Bro, what the fuck!

86
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:07,793
Bro, you got problems man.

87
00:08:07,827 --> 00:08:10,586
Well, I went on this trail
last year with some teammates

88
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,827
and it's actually really fun.

89
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:13,724
Bro whatever, Amy.

90
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:15,896
I'm serious. In fact, how'd
you even get us a reservation?

91
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:19,068
Last year, it took us like
hours. I know the owner's son.

92
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:21,310
Owner's son!

93
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:23,206
You know that man
winning and everything,

94
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:25,931
you'll never beat him in
there. Every single time.

95
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:29,068
And I want you to know,
I can't drive either.

96
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:30,172
Oh, me?

97
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:32,344
My butt, my head like messed up.

98
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,172
Greg?

99
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:35,034
He ain't got no car.
You know I ain't got no car.

100
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:36,034
Stupid fool.
Alright.

101
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:38,931
Just know we hired
the whole ride.

102
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:39,724
Yeah.

103
00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:41,103
That's five feet.

104
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:43,206
Y'all gonna be had.
Hook them away.

105
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:45,344
Hey, you think you can
spot when we get there.

106
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:48,586
Greg, I know mommy.
Man, you better spot
your ass in this car.

107
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,862
Oh, man.

108
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,172
Oh my god.

109
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:07,793
Did you know we're gonna
be running around, right?

110
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:09,655
For what?

111
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:11,965
What do you mean for what?
It's a haunted trail.

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,379
People jump out of the
woods and chase you.

113
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:14,379
Chase you?

114
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:15,793
Yeah.

115
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:16,965
What did you think
was about to happen?

116
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,689
I don't know. I've
never done this before.

117
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,310
I did it last year and
you were running around.

118
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:24,931
I mean well, was
it actually scary?

119
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,758
Hell, yeah. It was scary.

120
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:30,206
Maybe Zay will hold my hand.

121
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:31,206
You need help.

122
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:32,206
No, I don't.

123
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:33,965
Change your shoes, Portia.

124
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why if I can run in them? Look
the heels are thick. I'm good.

125
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:38,862
Change your shoes.

126
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:40,379
Why if I can run in them.

127
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,103
Portia!

128
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:42,103
Jackie!

129
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,793
Fine. Do what you want.

130
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:46,931
Let's just go before we're late.

131
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:48,413
Oh, wait, you need to eat.

132
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:50,103
I'm not hungry.

133
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:52,068
Didn't you just say we're
gonna be running around.

134
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:54,241
If you go into diabetic
shock or something,

135
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:55,827
that's not going to be on me.

136
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:58,137
Wow! You're such a great friend.

137
00:09:58,172 --> 00:09:59,413
The best.

138
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:01,689
Oh, dope earrings.
Are they real?

139
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:04,413
Jackie, have I ever
worn anything fake?

140
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:06,275
Yeah. Yeah.
Exactly. Come on.

141
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,793
When's the last time
you actually paid for
a speeding ticket?

142
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:11,241
Mr.! My dad is a judge,
can get me out of anything.

143
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:13,965
Hold on. Hold on. It was
only two or three times.

144
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,241
About two or three times. But
let's try five in the past year.

145
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,896
But how many of those
did you pay for?

146
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:21,068
Oh, leave me alone.

147
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:23,241
Bruh, chill!
Also, we just playing a little.

148
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:24,655
Yeah whatever, man!

149
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:25,137
Gosh!

150
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:28,379
You're driving, right.

151
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:31,068
Don't I always drive?

152
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:32,758
Yeah. Okay.

153
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:56,103
Bitch, I got it. Bitch,
I get on my shit.

154
00:10:56,137 --> 00:10:57,655
She gonna be strange or what?

155
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:01,034
Hold on. Hold on.

156
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:03,034
She's coming in with
a big bun. Big pops.

157
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:05,000
She gonna be like, yes, no.

158
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:07,724
Oh, man!
Enough.

159
00:11:07,758 --> 00:11:09,310
Bruh, what's wrong with you?

160
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:13,724
I've been a damn.

161
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:15,448
Man, you too have followed
crazy stuff. Bitch
ain't got time for it.

162
00:11:17,896 --> 00:11:19,034
Exactly. You fool.

163
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:20,482
You got the girl smoked up.

164
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:21,310
We here?

165
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:22,000
We here.

166
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,965
With the grace of me.

167
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,344
With the grace of nothing.

168
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:32,206
Yo! This place is
a little empty.

169
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:34,862
There were more
people here last time.

170
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:37,896
I thought you said it
was hard to get in here.

171
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,896
Well, I don't know,
maybe we're late.

172
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:43,034
Well, Mark said he
gave us the last slide.
So, we should be fine.

173
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,344
This shit better be scary.

174
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,137
You come here for
the ladies, man.

175
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,689

years ago when we came,

237
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:17,655

Oh, no, come on. Jackie,
you didn't tell me that.

350
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:18,241
Yeah, she.

351
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:19,517
You ain't saying none of that.
I honestly forgot about that.

352
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:22,344
Well, somebody tried to come
get it what we're gonna do.

353
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:24,689
I know it may seems
like a strange request.

354
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:25,896
Wow.

355
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:28,862
Kinda. Our customers
have the best experience

356
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,241
when they don't
bring their phones.

357
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:35,758
This way, you are fully
present and you can
experience all of them real.

358
00:20:35,793 --> 00:20:37,448
Oh, you just gonna
drop the hand.

359
00:20:37,482 --> 00:20:41,724
So, you could all put
your phones in this tray.

360
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,379
I'm ready for this.

361
00:20:45,793 --> 00:20:48,896
So, tray will be locked and
placed at the end of the trail,

362
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:51,620
just fine lock box laboratory.

363
00:20:55,275 --> 00:20:59,482
And who want to keep the keys?

364
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:03,034
Oh, do you?
Thank you.

365
00:21:03,068 --> 00:21:07,655
So, before we get
started, I have to ask
you some weak questions.

366
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:08,482
Please.

367
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,793
Does anyone have asthma?

368
00:21:10,827 --> 00:21:11,689
No.

369
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:14,586
Does anyone have heart disease?

370
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,620
No. No. No. No.

371
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:18,068
Is anyone pregnant?

372
00:21:18,103 --> 00:21:19,965
Not yet.

373
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,793
That's it. Okay, awesome.

374
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:25,793
So, once you get to the
end of the trail, don't
forget to find your lock

375
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,965
box with all of
your cell phones.

376
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,793
There will be also the
signs to lead you back
to the parking lot.

377
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:33,413
Are you guys ready
to get started?

378
00:21:33,448 --> 00:21:33,965
Yeah.

379
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,551
Yayyy!

380
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,965
Ooh!!

381
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,793
Here we go!

382
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:09,000
What the hell is wrong with her?
I don't know.

383
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:11,517
What is she doing?

384
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:16,689
You better get that
ugly baby out or I slap
the shit out of you.

385
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:32,379
You need to help you.
You need to help my baby.

386
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:33,724
I don't know who's
thanked you or that baby.

387
00:22:33,758 --> 00:22:35,413
Please help, help.

388
00:22:35,448 --> 00:22:37,068
Got a head like a tennis ball.

389
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:40,896
She always did that.
Motherfucker dead, alright.

390
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:43,482
Motherfucker dead.
The bitch is dead.

391
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:45,482
Who cares.

392
00:22:45,517 --> 00:22:48,482
I don't know.

393
00:22:48,517 --> 00:22:52,689
Help me please.

394
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:54,482
Yayyy!
Come on, y'all.

395
00:22:54,517 --> 00:22:56,517
I don't know who.

396
00:23:24,758 --> 00:23:26,724
She smells like empty pot.
You need to go girl. Great.

397
00:23:26,758 --> 00:23:30,758
One more. Come on, y'all.

398
00:23:50,758 --> 00:23:51,827
Oh, thank god.

Ow!

420
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:43,862
Who's there?

421
00:25:43,896 --> 00:25:46,241
What the hell?

422
00:25:48,758 --> 00:25:50,206
That's me.

423
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:53,206
I can't see.

424
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:57,034

00:25:57,068 --> 00:25:59,206
Jackie!
I'm right here, Portia.

426
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:01,793

00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:04,034
Shit.

428
00:26:04,068 --> 00:26:06,034
Let's get out of here.

429
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:07,068
Shit.

430
00:26:28,275 --> 00:26:29,689
Alright.

431
00:26:29,724 --> 00:26:31,655
Who is this? Back

00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,862
Okay.
Can everyone just stop moving?

433
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:35,931
Let's find the final wall.

434
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,689
We need to be finding
the damn door. Shit,
forget this damn wall.

Oh, it's wet.

436
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,137
It's probably just water.

437
00:26:59,344 --> 00:27:03,896
Okay. Okay, everyone, just
grab a hand. Let's form a line.

438
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:05,068
Give me your hand, man.

439
00:27:17,275 --> 00:27:20,068
Casey, just keep going
until you find the door.

440
00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:37,137
Wait, Zay, are you there?

441
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:40,137
Don't worry about me. I'm

442
00:27:41,206 --> 00:27:43,413

Hello!

You were definitely scared.

463
00:29:28,137 --> 00:29:29,344
Yes, you were.

464
00:29:31,965 --> 00:29:34,931
What the hell is wrong with

465
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:39,034

466
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,034
Zay.

467
00:29:40,068 --> 00:29:40,862
Shut up. Just shut up.

468
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:44,896
What the hell?

469
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:46,275
I don't give a fuck.
Alright.

470
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,310
Not going with y'all.

471
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,137
That's a clown house.

472
00:29:52,172 --> 00:29:54,068
I don't do clowns.

473
00:29:54,103 --> 00:29:55,275
Wait, you're the clown.

474
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,586
Yes sir, that was lit. Yes.

475
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,482
Yes sir.

476
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:02,241
This one.

477
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:03,482
No.
Yeah.

478
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:09,931
Y'all trynna suck the fuck
out of everything. I'll trynna
suck the fun out of something.

479
00:30:09,965 --> 00:30:11,931
Yo what?

480
00:30:11,965 --> 00:30:15,482
Get out of here.

481
00:30:20,206 --> 00:30:22,172
What's up with Zay and Portia?

482
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:25,517
I don't know. He used to
be like her best friend
a couple years ago.

483
00:30:27,172 --> 00:30:29,103
What happened? I mean I've heard
bits and pieces of the story.

484
00:30:29,137 --> 00:30:31,620
Well, our senior
year, he was just

485
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:34,034
dating this chick that just

486
00:30:34,068 --> 00:30:36,413
wasn't good for him and
everybody knew that Zay was
gonna make it with football.

487
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:38,965
So, when Portia
tried to tell him,

488
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:42,448
he thought she couldn't
be happy for him.

489
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:49,310
Calm down. Stop!

490
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:56,172
I mean like he knew
the chick wasn't right.

491
00:30:56,206 --> 00:31:00,896
And so, then like Portia just
professed her love and that's
when things kind of went left.

492
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:03,517
But I mean how can
Zay not like Portia?

493
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:05,517
I think he just wants to
keep his options open.

494
00:31:05,551 --> 00:31:06,413
So, it's complicated.

495
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,206
Exactly.

496
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,206
Hey.
Oh, shit!

497
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:14,206
Holy shit!

498
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:17,206
Hey, I know you're
new to the groove

499
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:19,034
but I like you Casey.

500
00:31:19,068 --> 00:31:20,172
I like you too, Jackie.

501
00:31:30,206 --> 00:31:31,482
Get off me.

502
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:35,482
Damn! Look at his face.
How did that happen?

503
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:37,517
Shut up. Damn!

504
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:41,206
Alright. That feels great.

505
00:31:43,206 --> 00:31:45,000
Bruh, what about you?

506
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:47,000
You need to close your mouth.
I don't like the smell.

507
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:48,000
Crazy.

508
00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:51,034
It's bullshit.
Oh!

509
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:08,034
I think eventually they're going
to hook up. I mean I can see it.
I'm just like not here for it.

510
00:32:08,068 --> 00:32:09,413
Yeah that seemed
like a lot of drama.

511
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:11,448
Woah! How was it?

512
00:32:11,482 --> 00:32:13,137
Guys, it was scary.

513
00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:14,137
No, so scary.

514
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:14,586
Yeah, it was so scary.

515
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:22,137
Ayo!

516
00:32:22,172 --> 00:32:23,586
Oh god!

517
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,034
Hey, that's what we're talking
about. Merry Christmas!

518
00:32:27,068 --> 00:32:29,689
What? Thank you,
Jesus. Merry Christmas

519
00:32:29,724 --> 00:32:32,103
cause we see no excitement
all fucking days.

520
00:32:32,137 --> 00:32:34,275
Thank you. Let us even see
blood. Can we see blood, please?

521
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,551
Hey, slice them up. Stop.

522
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:38,586
Playing with them. Hey. Hey,
man, do something to crank
for a little bit of change.

523
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:43,275
Hey!Get the fuck off me.

524
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,103
I thought they weren't
allowed to touch us.

525
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:47,965
Oh, baby. Y'all went over this.
This is like excitement, look.

526
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:52,103
Hey, watch his fucking head off.

527
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,482
I thought they weren't
allowed to touch us.

528
00:32:53,517 --> 00:32:55,275
Yeah, don't worry
about that, okay.

529
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,275
Come on. Let's
not talk about it.

530
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,724
I wanna be scared like
a bitch. Kill him.

531
00:33:01,758 --> 00:33:05,517
Hey, look, watch me.
Watch me. Do this.

532
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:08,344
Get that motherfucking. Yeah.

533
00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:11,517
Hey. Shut up. Let him do
what he did off of him.
You act like a bitch.

534
00:33:15,724 --> 00:33:17,551
I don't think this is okay.

535
00:33:17,586 --> 00:33:18,689
That's a real knife?

536
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:21,103
Shit. What the fuck!
Oh, shit.

537
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:23,551
Come. Come.

538
00:33:41,724 --> 00:33:42,827
Jesus.

539
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:44,655
That was awesome.
Oh, shit!

540
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,586
Guys, come help me.
Come, help me, guys.

541
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,586
I'm scared. Yeah.
It's too big for that.

542
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,448
I can't believe that's
how you be on the field
too. Oh, yeah. Fuck.

543
00:34:03,482 --> 00:34:07,655
He's, he's, he's a baby.
He's a baby. I'm telling him.
Hey, bro, shut the fuck up.

544
00:34:07,689 --> 00:34:10,448
Oh, now, you big man. Oh, you
should have did that when the
man had you about your neck.

545
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:11,241
Like that.

546
00:34:11,275 --> 00:34:14,310
Get the fuck off me.

547
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:17,724
All I know is I need some
more action. I got. Yeah,
yeah, come on baby. Y'all

548
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:21,413

levels. Come on, man. Od damn.

549
00:34:21,448 --> 00:34:23,413
Hey, guys, wait up.

550
00:35:10,793 --> 00:35:12,448
You having fun?

551
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:14,758
Of course, and I'm with
you. I was kind of scared.

552
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:17,172
Yeah, I know you're scared.

553
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:18,758
But we're on a haunted trip,
so I mean, right. We're
supposed to be scared here.

554
00:35:18,793 --> 00:35:20,793
Alright, come on, we
gotta go. Come here.

555
00:35:24,379 --> 00:35:25,172
What are you doing?

556
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:26,689
What do you mean?

557
00:35:28,344 --> 00:35:30,206
What do you mean what do I
mean? You know what I mean.

558
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:33,172
Bro, I am so tired
of Zay, bro, like.

559
00:35:33,206 --> 00:35:35,172
Bro, he honestly just
be messing with you bro.

560
00:35:35,206 --> 00:35:37,517
That's what your ass thinks.
Bro, for real.

561
00:35:37,551 --> 00:35:39,620
So, you think he was
playing when he took
my damn receiver spot.

562
00:35:39,655 --> 00:35:41,310
One day, you're all over me.

563
00:35:41,344 --> 00:35:43,310
The next day, you want to
act like I don't even exist.

564
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:46,310
Jackie is convinced you
want nothing to do with me.

565
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,310
Portia, baby, now I
feel about you. I don't.

566
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,724
You really going to
do this right now.

567
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:53,896
Where else would you
like me to do it, Zay?

568
00:35:53,931 --> 00:35:56,931
I'm telling you, you're
always tripping like damn.

569
00:35:58,344 --> 00:36:00,517
Bro, hold up.

570
00:36:00,551 --> 00:36:02,517
Listen your ankle mess up, bro,
what are you supposed to do?

571
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:03,965
Turn down the opportunity?

572
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,517
No, that's not what I said.
That's not what I said.

573
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:06,896
So, what is you saying?

574
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,241
I'm saying I need my
receiver spot back bro.

575
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:11,241
And my dad, bro, I know
you're gonna be tripping.

576
00:36:11,275 --> 00:36:13,241
Bro, there you go with
your dad again bro.

577
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:15,241
We were best friends, Zay.

578
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:17,517
And we still are.
No, we're not.

579
00:36:19,931 --> 00:36:21,689
Your dad gonna cut you out
regardless just like he did
last week during the game.

580
00:36:21,724 --> 00:36:23,620
Coach shouldn't have took
me out the game, bro.

581
00:36:23,655 --> 00:36:25,206
Mark overthrew me
and you know that.

582
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,724
Come on, man.
Bro, whatever you say, Austin.

583
00:36:28,758 --> 00:36:30,551
Wait, hold on. What you trying
to say, Zay better than me?

584
00:36:31,827 --> 00:36:33,344
Bro, I thought you
were Zay's biggest fan.

585
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,034
Hell, nah! I'm just trying to
be a good teammate, that's it.

586
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:40,034
All I know is bro I'm
trying to win that national
championship this year, bro.

587
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:42,241
It can't be nothing like
last year when we lost.

588
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,413
We could have won that man.

589
00:36:45,448 --> 00:36:47,896
Once marked through
that interception I
knew, it was over, bro.

590
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:49,896
But don't worry about
it. Hey, this year,

591
00:36:51,758 --> 00:36:54,793
this year. Yes, sir. Yes,
sir. Yes, sir. I like that.

592
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:56,448
That's that energy.

593
00:37:32,344 --> 00:37:34,482
Sometimes, things are weird.
Sometimes, they're not.

594
00:37:34,517 --> 00:37:36,827
Okay, damn, what do you
want me to do? Damn,

595
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:38,931
what you want me to get
on my knee right now? Ask
you to marry me right now?

596
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,620
Nobody, like somebody please
give me a pastor right now,

597
00:37:41,655 --> 00:37:43,413
so I can marry this girl, like
damn what do you want me to do?

598
00:37:43,448 --> 00:37:45,586
I want you to make up your mind,

599
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:51,310
do you want me or do you not?

600
00:37:56,896 --> 00:38:00,758
Do you know how hard
it is to always see you
entertain another female?

601
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:10,758
Yeah, forget it.
Oh, come here.

602
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:13,758
Okay, Portia, look

603
00:38:16,034 --> 00:38:17,689
you remember seeing you in
high school you told me,
a girl was just using me.

604
00:38:19,068 --> 00:38:22,724
What else did you tell
me? What did you tell me?

605
00:38:25,724 --> 00:38:27,724
That I loved you.
Exactly.

606
00:38:29,413 --> 00:38:31,000
And that scared
the hell out of me

607
00:38:32,137 --> 00:38:32,931
look

608
00:38:34,586 --> 00:38:36,413
besides the fact that you're
annoying as hell sometimes,

609
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:38,586
you're low-key perfect.

610
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,896
You're the best girl that
I ever had in my life.

611
00:38:44,482 --> 00:38:47,758
And it's just easier to
keep you at a distance
than to just dive all in.

612
00:38:49,137 --> 00:38:50,965
And that's just me
keeping it real.

613
00:38:55,137 --> 00:38:56,655
I can appreciate the honesty.

614
00:39:00,068 --> 00:39:04,068
Thank you. Look, can
we just enjoy the rest
of this night and just

615
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:06,724
leave this deep ass
conversation for tomorrow?

616
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:09,724
I guess.

617
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:11,000
Thank you.

618
00:39:12,724 --> 00:39:13,931
Why you always doing it?

619
00:39:15,068 --> 00:39:16,793
Come on, nurse,

620
00:39:16,827 --> 00:39:20,586
why you always doing that?
Oh, Zay, stop. Oh my gosh.

621
00:39:24,137 --> 00:39:28,931
Doing all that baby stuff.
Everybody got tired.

622
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:33,586
Is that too damn?

623
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,586
Zay, okay.
Where's Casey?

624
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,586
Where's Casey?

625
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,482
I don't know man.

626
00:39:37,517 --> 00:39:39,000
We gotta go. Sure.

627
00:39:39,034 --> 00:39:41,586
That was fucking crazy,
bro. She's been real bro.

628
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,413
That's some bullshit.

629
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,413
All these clowns, bruh.

630
00:40:01,655 --> 00:40:02,931
Shit. Fucking crazy.

631
00:40:06,965 --> 00:40:08,620
Oh.

632
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:11,206
Did you come here
to play with me?

633
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:13,206
Oh, I gotta come play
with your ass. Oh my god.

634
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:16,551
Come on. Darling,
you could stay alone.

635
00:40:16,586 --> 00:40:19,000
Don't you. I'm not the one.
Alright.

636
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:30,034
My girls, where we going?

637
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,034
Just stay with us. I'm
not staying with you.

638
00:40:50,206 --> 00:40:51,931
Hello!

639
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:54,103
Jackie?

640
00:40:54,137 --> 00:40:55,965
Why do you want to leave?

641
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,551
Get away your ass that's
why we want to leave.
Can you, please, go?

642
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:07,000
What the hell is wrong? Go.

643
00:41:15,034 --> 00:41:16,137
What the fuck!

644
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:22,137
Where you going?

645
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,172
Hey, what's up?

646
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:51,862
This is what I was talking
about. What I was talking about.

647
00:41:51,896 --> 00:41:54,862
Fucking white people shit.

00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:58,482
Oh, why are we here? Why

649
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:02,172
You need to tell her how they
fucking get out of here. You
don't want been here before.

650
00:42:02,206 --> 00:42:03,931
I don't know.

00:42:03,965 --> 00:42:07,034
I'm finna go, man. I'm going.
I'm about to leave, man.

652
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:09,344
No. No. No. Let's just think.

653
00:42:09,379 --> 00:42:11,931
We gotta get out of
here. We go back.

654
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:14,724
Where do we go back? I can't
remember. I can't remember
how do we get out of here.

655
00:42:14,758 --> 00:42:16,103
So, what do we do?

Everybody just leave from

Where the fuck we go, Jackie?

672
00:43:06,724 --> 00:43:07,896
Jackie.

673
00:43:07,931 --> 00:43:09,896
Guys, how do we live?

674
00:43:09,931 --> 00:43:11,137
What do we do?

675
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:13,655
I don't know a fucking thing.

676
00:43:13,689 --> 00:43:15,862
What do we do?
Can we go back?

Yo, what the fuck how

What the fuck man!
No. come on man. yeah.

00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,655
The only way out is through.

What the fuck are you
talking about man?

686
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:47,896

They're football players with

Don't look back but I think

Nothing's back there. No, I

01:02:41,206 --> 01:02:42,551
Jackie!

857
01:02:42,586 --> 01:02:44,241
Jackie, you okay?

858
01:02:49,965 --> 01:02:53,103
Fuck. Go. Go. Go.

859
01:02:56,827 --> 01:02:57,413
Fuck you.

860
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:36,517
This way. Come on. Come on.

861
01:03:39,137 --> 01:03:41,103
Amy has the keys.

862
01:03:41,137 --> 01:03:42,586
Fuck.

863
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,586
Fuck it. Fuck it.

864
01:03:49,206 --> 01:03:53,137
It's open. It's open.
Take it. Take that.

865
01:03:54,137 --> 01:03:56,310
Call the fucking police.

866
01:03:56,344 --> 01:03:59,137
I never say to call
that. Call that ass, man.

867
01:04:02,724 --> 01:04:05,000
Hey, guys!

868
01:04:07,034 --> 01:04:08,000
Wait up.

869
01:04:09,206 --> 01:04:10,689
Yes, hello! We need help.

870
01:04:10,724 --> 01:04:13,379
Guys, wait.

871
01:04:14,689 --> 01:04:15,482
Wait up.

872
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,241
Guys. Guys.
Please. Please.

873
01:04:24,206 --> 01:04:26,206
Come on. Come on.

874
01:04:30,206 --> 01:04:31,620
Are you good?

875
01:04:31,655 --> 01:04:34,206
No, it's not a joke.
Where have you been?

876
01:04:34,241 --> 01:04:36,068
Trynna fucking kill me.

877
01:04:36,103 --> 01:04:40,034
My friends are all dead.
We're at the end of
the trail. Please come.

878
01:04:40,068 --> 01:04:40,965
Come on. You sure?

879
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,586
I'm straight. I'm straight.

880
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:46,068
Oh, everything was fun.
Everything was just
fine a few hours ago.

881
01:04:46,103 --> 01:04:47,275
Everything was fun.

882
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:25,620
So, it was you?

883
01:05:26,758 --> 01:05:28,482
This was you the
whole fucking time?

884
01:05:31,689 --> 01:05:34,482
You always know how to
ruin something, Zay.

885
01:05:36,103 --> 01:05:37,586
What the fuck are
you talking about?

886
01:05:39,275 --> 01:05:40,586
That starter spot.

887
01:05:41,655 --> 01:05:43,103
It was never yours to have.

888
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:46,482
What?

889
01:05:48,103 --> 01:05:50,758
Coach would switch stuff
around but that started spot

890
01:05:50,793 --> 01:05:52,103
was always mine.

891
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:57,965
So, you telling me you
trying to kill me cause
you got fucking outplayed.

892
01:05:59,379 --> 01:06:01,241
I need to go to the league, Zay.

893
01:06:02,206 --> 01:06:03,344
I need this shit.

894
01:06:05,551 --> 01:06:07,034
This shit is all I got.

895
01:06:08,724 --> 01:06:12,241
Nobody ever fucking believed in
me, not even my fucking father.

896
01:06:15,448 --> 01:06:17,724
You killed all you
fucking friends.

897
01:06:17,758 --> 01:06:21,137
Your own fucking
friends! Fuck them.

898
01:06:21,172 --> 01:06:22,827
Fuck you.

899
01:06:22,862 --> 01:06:25,068
Fuck you and fuck them.
They were never my friends.

900
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:28,172
Fuck you.

901
01:06:38,379 --> 01:06:41,172
You get this shit all
fucking planned one.

902
01:06:43,689 --> 01:06:44,517
Bitch!

903
01:06:56,068 --> 01:06:56,724
Fuck.

904
01:07:04,793 --> 01:07:06,793
So, who's the other killer?

905
01:07:07,379 --> 01:07:08,551
That don't even matter.

906
01:07:08,586 --> 01:07:10,793
Who wants it? Who wants it?

907
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,689
Oh, man!

908
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:29,827
I'm out.

909
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,172
What you mean you out?

910
01:08:35,517 --> 01:08:36,827
I should never have
agreed to this.

911
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:39,793
So, what you bailing on me?

912
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:42,827
I ain't helping you
kill any more people.

913
01:08:43,896 --> 01:08:45,689
I mean I can't stand Zay either

914
01:08:47,379 --> 01:08:48,172
but this isn't right.

915
01:08:56,896 --> 01:08:57,689
Not right.

916
01:09:02,344 --> 01:09:05,758
You really think I give a fuck
about what you think is right.

917
01:09:12,551 --> 01:09:14,551
I own you.

918
01:09:16,758 --> 01:09:21,000
And you're gonna kill
as many fucking people
that I tell you to kill.

919
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,758
Mark,

920
01:09:28,413 --> 01:09:29,206
let's not forget

921
01:09:30,793 --> 01:09:33,206
you were the one that threw
the national championship game.

922
01:09:35,275 --> 01:09:37,896
You wouldn't want
millions of fans to know
that now, would you?

923
01:09:39,724 --> 01:09:41,896
I can't let you keep
holding that over my head.

924
01:09:43,724 --> 01:09:44,724
Mark,

925
01:09:45,586 --> 01:09:46,206
think!

926
01:09:48,586 --> 01:09:49,827
Think about what your
father was saying.

927
01:09:51,793 --> 01:09:53,931
My star quarterback son

928
01:09:55,931 --> 01:09:59,551
is a punk-ass bitch
cause he don't give a
fuck about his team.

929
01:10:05,965 --> 01:10:07,931
Oh, shit!

930
01:10:10,965 --> 01:10:13,413
You tell him, I'll kill you.

931
01:10:19,689 --> 01:10:20,620
Where's my shit?

932
01:10:24,551 --> 01:10:25,551
Over there.

933
01:10:48,068 --> 01:10:49,896
Not unless I kill you first.

934
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:26,965
Oh, fuck!

935
01:11:28,206 --> 01:11:32,862
Casey laughed at me. Amy laughed
at me. Jordan laughed at me.

936
01:11:34,448 --> 01:11:35,965
Fuck you.

937
01:11:41,344 --> 01:11:43,344
Ah fuck!

938
01:11:58,482 --> 01:12:03,379
You can dream this is all
part of a fucking play, huh?

939
01:12:03,413 --> 01:12:05,103
Exactly.

940
01:12:05,137 --> 01:12:09,517
All I needed to do is get
your fucking ass here.

941
01:12:09,551 --> 01:12:12,655
I couldn't just kill you. I
had to make it look random.

942
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Come on.

943
01:12:58,551 --> 01:13:01,896
Help!
Go, get him! Go, get him!

944
01:13:01,931 --> 01:13:05,103
Why would he do that?

945
01:13:05,137 --> 01:13:06,758
Help!

946
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:15,413
Help! We need help!

947
01:13:30,551 --> 01:13:33,896
Help! Help!

948
01:13:33,931 --> 01:13:35,103
Girl, look!

949
01:13:35,137 --> 01:13:37,689
We need help. We
need help please.

950
01:13:37,724 --> 01:13:39,931
This is the best haunted trial
I've ever been to in my life.

951
01:13:40,931 --> 01:13:44,068
We need help! Help!

952
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,896
Help!

953
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:55,103
Oh,

954
01:15:22,068 --> 01:15:24,793
so much fun.

955
01:15:25,793 --> 01:15:27,793
Wasn't that fun, Austin?

956
01:15:28,379 --> 01:15:29,758
That was fun.

957
01:15:30,827 --> 01:15:33,172
I fucking spared his life.

958
01:15:36,655 --> 01:15:38,241
I could have killed him.

959
01:15:39,344 --> 01:15:41,793
I could have fucking killed him.

960
01:15:41,827 --> 01:15:44,068
I could've fucking killed him.

961
01:15:44,103 --> 01:15:48,172
Fuck you. Fuck you, Zay.
Fuck you, Zay. Fuck you.

962
01:15:48,206 --> 01:15:49,551
Fuck you.

963
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:57,551
Oh, I'm gonna fucking kill
this. It's okay, Austin.

964
01:15:58,758 --> 01:16:01,206
You'll get her next.
