3
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,874
They were left in cardboard boxes,

4
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,671
found near a bridge or on the sidewalk.

5
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:54,888
There used to be so many of them.
More than 30 of them in a shift.

6
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,351
We nannies had different tasks.

7
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,688
Some fed the babies milk.

8
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,190
Some did the laundry.

9
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,277
I looked after the babies.

10
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,823
I remember many of them.

11
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,954
These babies… I brought them up.

12
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,667
I held them in my arms
and fed them slowly,

13
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,753
as if they were my own children.

14
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:35,136
My heart ached
whenever I sent a baby away.

15
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,141
They'd be sent so far away.

16
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,603
What was to become of them?

17
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,534
Can you speak Chinese?

18
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,665
I mean, you used to live there.

19
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,626
What origins are you?

20
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,169
Like, what's your…

21
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:36,641
She was taken to Huazhou Welfare
Institute around December, 1999.

22
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,352
You gotta be more detailed…

23
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,565
I know it's like
finding a needle in a haystack, but…

24
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,652
Of course it's impossible to find them.

25
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,696
Yeah, I know it's quite difficult.

26
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,740
No, it's impossible.

27
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,950
You're talking about ancient history.

28
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,250
No, we don't keep such records.

29
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:15,972
Someone told my mom a baby photo online
looked like me and my sister.

30
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,190
I had to give birth secretly.

31
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,193
I don't know
where the midwife sent the baby.

32
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,910
Let's see if you recognize
the nanny in the photo.

33
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,726
I didn't even know you were Jewish.

34
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,113
My mom's Greek Orthodox,

35
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,865
so when I say I'm Greek,
it doesn't make any sense.

36
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,551
Do you know what's your real birthday?

37
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,888
I thought I came with a little tag
or something, but my mom,

38
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,307
she was like, "They guessed."

39
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,488
I did the 23andMe thing too.

40
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,159
But I haven't done anything.
But that's cool that you found them.

41
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,915
You're not gonna try?

42
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,169
'Cause you don't want to or just…

43
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,213
But where would you even start?

44
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,643
Are you meeting your mom or something?

45
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,863
I love to see that this can happen.

46
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,158
We grow red peppers here.

47
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:14,205
I've been farming since I was a teenager.

48
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,374
-Who taught you?
-My mom.

49
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,214
Our place is messy.

50
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,175
What's this right here?

51
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:30,388
That? When the one-child policy
was strict back in the days,

52
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,973
we were told to get these things.

53
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,184
Oh! It's the document for birth control!

54
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,356
After I gave birth to my first daughter,
I went back to work.

55
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,693
They would make me get "coil checks."

56
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,320
-IUD?
-Right.

57
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,197
They required you
to be examined every three months.

58
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,658
It was really strict back then,
not like now.

59
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:59,042
Have you ever thought about the life
of the daughter you gave away?

60
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:04,005
Whether she is living a good life?

61
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:09,135
Yeah. How can I not think about that?

62
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,639
So it was your second child
who was sent away.

63
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,267
-It was late in the night.
-At midnight.

64
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,062
Someone took the baby away.

65
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,229
Who was it?

66
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,107
We asked a neighbor.

67
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,444
He said he would find
someone to adopt her.

68
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,405
We wrapped her in a small blanket.

69
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,617
Did you talk to him after that?

70
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,162
He wouldn't tell us
who he gave the baby to.

71
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,915
He was afraid we'd want her back.

72
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:07,193
I know it must be a painful history
for you. It's not easy.

73
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,994
Right. That's the tube.

74
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,872
There's a black line to indicate
the amount of saliva necessary.

75
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,752
Okay, that's good.

76
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,381
We'll send you a report
even if the DNA doesn't match.

77
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:35,054
When you are listening
to other people's stories,

78
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,349
what they have been through,

79
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,518
I think you can understand a lot of things

80
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,771
that you never know
you would understand before.

81
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,902
They do love their kids,
they want to find their babies.

82
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,030
It's so sad.

83
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:22,240
We are on the Two Bridge
where Sadie was found.

84
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,202
Hello, auntie.

85
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,205
Has anyone near here ever…

86
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,917
-Found a baby?
-Yes, have you ever seen one?

87
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,669
-No, I haven't.
-You haven't?

88
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,463
No, I only sell things here.

89
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:53,062
I always knew
about the one-child policy 'cause…

90
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,239
And my parents, they almost gave up me,

91
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,825
because they don't want
to pay the penalty.

92
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:11,289
But I'm very lucky
because my grandparents,

93
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,666
they said, "No, we want to keep her."

94
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,671
So I just don't have
a very good relationship with my father.

95
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,758
I remember one time,
my father wanted to…

96
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,561
And he just wanted
to take my brother there,

97
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,730
and I asked him if I can…

98
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,576
It was very difficult for me
because you know you're not welcome.

99
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:53,289
You are in the wrong gender,
they don't want you, and you know that.

100
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:02,465
So that's why I feel
so connected with the girls.

101
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:42,166
A neighbor saw the ad. He saw the photo.

102
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,712
He told me, "That girl
looks like your daughter a lot."

103
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,303
How long have you been living here?

104
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,180
-Me?
-Right.

105
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,975
I've been living here since I was born.

106
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,187
I work in the rice fields.

107
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,197
So… did you make the decision
to give up the baby

108
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,784
before she was born or after?

109
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:22,748
I decided after she was born.
Because the village officials found out.

110
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:28,462
If we kept her,
it was going to cost us at least $8,500.

111
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:33,008
We were forced by the circumstances.
We had no choice at all.

112
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,557
I left her at the People's Hospital.
Next to the main entrance.

113
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:46,105
It was four or five o'clock
in the morning.

114
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,194
Because it would have been too cold
to leave her there overnight.

115
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,990
I left a note with her date of birth.

116
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,910
I left 300 RMB in her clothes.

117
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,164
Nothing else.
Just the money in her clothes.

118
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,876
That's what happened.

119
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,467
Of course I felt awful.

120
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,095
My own child
would be taken by someone else.

121
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,892
Doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl,
it's my own child.

122
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,905
Did your wife know
that you were giving up the baby?

123
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,575
She knew what I was doing.

124
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,370
She was crying.

125
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,414
She couldn't bear it.

126
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,964
She wanted me to get the baby back.
I said I didn't know who took her.

127
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,433
Mom, cut up the onion for me.

128
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,478
Just that.

129
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,104
Cut it in slices.

130
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,157
Who taught you to cook?

131
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,410
I've taught myself
since I was very little.

132
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,581
You know, my mom doesn't cook.

133
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,169
I can only ask her
to help with simple tasks.

134
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:38,092
Do you work in the fields?

135
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:42,805
I used to. But not anymore.

136
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:51,230
I couldn't manage it. It's a tough job.

137
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,735
So, when did you find out
you had a little sister?

138
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,989
When I was in the fourth
or fifth grade, I think.

139
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:06,954
My mom, sometimes
she would talk to other people

140
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:12,626
about babies who got adopted.

141
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,172
She would ask around.

142
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,510
She talks about it less often now.

143
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:29,059
I had a chance to grow up
with my parents around.

144
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,311
I feel lucky.

145
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:37,443
But she didn't have
the same opportunity like I did.

146
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,736
I feel guilty.

147
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,574
It was my parents who made the decision.

148
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:49,163
But we are sisters, after all.

149
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,803
So, let me ask you,

150
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:56,308
where did you see the ad?

151
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:59,603
I saw it on my husband's phone.

152
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:04,441
I gave up a daughter in 2001.

153
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:07,903
We sent another one away in 2003.

154
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:12,240
Do you remember
if she had any birthmarks?

155
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,284
I didn't pay attention.

156
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:19,581
I only looked at her face,
which had no marks on it.

157
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,770
Hello. My name is Liu Hao.
Nice to meet you.

158
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,816
I don't want to be filmed.

159
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,402
We won't film you.

160
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,655
If you sit behind that,
they won't be able to see you.

161
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,409
I knew it was a girl.

162
00:49:55,492 --> 00:50:00,205
I couldn't bear to have another abortion,
so I gave birth to the baby instead.

163
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:06,420
-You had the baby in a hospital?
-Right. I knew a doctor there.

164
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:10,590
He told me to wait
until I was about to give birth,

165
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,260
and then he would help me deliver.

166
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:17,764
Because if you went
to the hospital too early,

167
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,643
the doctors would find out
you were having an extra child.

168
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:27,441
When they took my daughter away,
I fainted and fell to the floor.

169
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:32,279
I have no idea where she ended up.

170
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:39,494
I know she wouldn't understand
or forgive me if I found her.

171
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,204
She wouldn't be nice to me.

172
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:43,415
Let me ask you.

173
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,751
Would you forgive me at all?

174
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,004
I ask myself this question.

175
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:56,219
My dad, he and his mother
didn't want me when I was born.

176
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:01,266
If she wants to forgive me, she will.
If not, let it be.

177
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,585
It is what my mom
had been through, you know?

178
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,548
My father wanted to leave her
because I'm not a boy.

179
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,171
Hello!

180
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:59,593
You said you know Sadie's nanny?

181
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,262
Oh, right, right.

182
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,889
I saw her picture online.

183
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,266
I'm a friend of the nanny.

184
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,350
That is awesome.

185
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,354
She has worked
in the orphanage for over 20 years.

186
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:17,235
Do you mind giving me her number
so I can contact her?

187
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:23,867
People never talk about these women
who took care of thousands of babies.

188
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:13,935
-Do you remember her?
-Yes, I took care of her.

189
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,688
This is what she looks like now.

190
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,356
Is she a good height?

191
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,860
-Yes. She's tall.
-I knew, just by looking at her picture.

192
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:28,575
She has long hair,
like many foreign girls.

193
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,744
Right. Long hair.

194
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:38,084
When you were a kid, did you think
about what you wanted to do in the future?

195
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,336
Not really.

196
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,505
People from the countryside
don't have dreams.

197
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,883
I can't write.

198
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:49,346
I quit school in the second grade.

199
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,597
Why did you stop?

200
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:54,142
We were poor with so many kids.

201
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,310
No money to study.

202
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:02,609
Life is much better now.
We even throw the leftovers away.

203
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,528
So, you remember her.

204
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,906
Yeah, I remember many of them.

205
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:12,452
She was skinny when she first came.

206
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,538
It was a freezing day.

207
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:21,711
A passerby found her on the sidewalk

208
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,839
and brought her to us.

209
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:31,012
I fed her gently in my arms,
as if she was my own.

210
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,974
I brought her up and had to send her away.

211
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:43,066
We nannies… We aren't cold-hearted.

212
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:48,571
My heart aches
whenever I send a child away.

213
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:56,704
They'd be sent so far away.
I'd think, "What's to become of them?"

214
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,571
Hello?

215
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,323
Good morning! Did you have breakfast?

216
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,124
Hi! Nice to see you, Mr. Xu.

217
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,591
When was the last time I was here?

218
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,175
In October.

219
00:59:58,052 --> 01:00:03,725
I'm here to show you the test results.
It's here.

220
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:06,728
It shows that your DNA

221
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:11,983
doesn't match with the girl's.

222
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,652
You can take a look.

223
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,617
I won't give up looking for your daughter.

224
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:27,332
Because your DNA is already at the lab,

225
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:33,671
in the future,
if your daughter takes a test,

226
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,632
there will be a match.

227
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:40,428
It's okay. We're not giving up.

228
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,658
I know it's hard for you, auntie.

229
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,701
I'll keep searching.

230
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,892
I do not have a boyfriend.

231
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,693
You were found on the Two Bridge.

232
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:56,238
That is me. I didn't realize it at first.

233
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,838
First, I washed diapers.

234
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:19,595
Then I started taking care of the babies
from 2001 to 2005.

235
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,932
When did Sadie come to the orphanage?

236
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:27,978
In early December.

237
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:32,608
She wasn't wearing pretty clothes,
like the other babies.

238
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:35,528
She was no more than 5 pounds.

239
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:51,961
Although she isn't my daughter,
I raised her until she was adopted.

240
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:55,840
You are so sweet.

241
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,510
It's a shame you can't find your mom.

242
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,100
Please keep an eye out for us.

243
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:08,394
Please tell us if anyone reaches out.

244
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,359
Sadie used to live here, right?

245
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:17,194
Yes, in this room.

246
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:38,729
Thanks for bringing
so many gifts for the kids.

247
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:56,413
This is where the kids live.

248
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,792
Hello, everyone.

249
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,251
Say hi to your sisters.

250
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:36,203
How many babies
did you take care of back then?

251
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:41,917
After 2001, it was the peak time.
Over 200 kids.

252
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:45,337
The conditions in the orphanage
weren't optimal.

253
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:49,675
We had only two nurses and no doctor.

254
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,468
There were many babies.

255
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:56,056
We weren't able to take them
to the hospital whenever they got sick.

256
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:59,560
But since there wasn't a doctor,
we couldn't use prescription drugs.

257
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:02,688
So I went to medical school in 2002.

258
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:11,238
I gave her this vaccine shot.
I did for all the babies.

259
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:13,657
No.

260
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,702
She only cried
when she was taking vaccination.

261
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:18,203
She usually didn't cry.

262
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,956
She was outgoing and alive.

263
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:25,961
When Chloe first came to the orphanage,
how old was she?

264
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:29,506
We think she was born that day.

265
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:32,885
Who brought her to the orphanage?

266
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,429
It would have been
the local police department.

267
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:37,551
Hello, auntie.

268
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,222
-This is Lily.
-I recognize her.

269
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:44,349
-You recognize her?
-I do, I do.

270
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:47,686
This is her mother.

271
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:57,279
Can you tell us how long Lily lived here?

272
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:59,823
I brought her up until she was adopted.

273
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:02,868
When there were
too many babies in the orphanage,

274
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:05,078
we'd raise them at home
until they're sent away.

275
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,914
How many babies lived here?

276
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:12,336
Sometimes over 10,
sometimes just a few.

277
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,173
You were living in that room.

278
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:23,388
You were here.

279
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:28,602
She was a mischievous girl.
A bit naughty.

280
01:17:28,685 --> 01:17:33,106
My grandma used to

281
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,692
tickle her and call her a bun.

282
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:07,557
I was sad that she was crying.

283
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:12,437
When I put her in her mom's arms,
she cried a lot.

284
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:16,066
I raised her
and grew feelings for her.

285
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:25,534
Lily and her mom got this for you.

286
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,036
Oh, thank you so much.

287
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,747
Auntie, please open it
and see what's in it.

288
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,423
Can you help me with it?

289
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:40,882
Can you?

290
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,809
This gift means a lot to her.

291
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:53,979
I see. I will have it on all the time.

292
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:57,941
Always.

293
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:15,876
I am grateful to her mom for bringing
her up to be an excellent girl.

294
01:19:51,703 --> 01:19:52,621
Thank you.

295
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:06,468
So, we are heading
to the Yangmei Township.

296
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:13,099
Your finding place is
in a government building of that town.

297
01:20:13,683 --> 01:20:16,645
So we'll go there first and walk around.

298
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:19,856
And then the family
that could be your birth family,

299
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:23,151
I will come over there
and tell them the results,

300
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:24,903
that it doesn't match.

301
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:28,114
That family really wanted
to find their child,

302
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,909
and that sister, that girl I talked to,

303
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:34,412
she really wants to find her sister.

304
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:16,139
This is the government building.

305
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:21,227
You were left on the stairs
to the entrance of the building.

306
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:49,881
Oh! You are cooking here, Chunjiao?

307
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,008
I haven't seen you in so long.

308
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,552
Why are you cooking so much today?

309
01:22:54,844 --> 01:22:57,013
Because we have more than 20 people today.

310
01:22:57,097 --> 01:22:59,182
-Are the workers coming today?
-Yes.

311
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:01,559
Mr. Chen!

312
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,479
Let me show you the report.

313
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:06,356
-Take a seat.
-It's okay.

314
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:13,113
It turns out your DNA didn't match.

315
01:23:13,196 --> 01:23:15,615
It wasn't a match, was it?

316
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:17,033
Chunjiao?

317
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:21,162
The test results show
that the DNA didn't match.

318
01:23:21,287 --> 01:23:22,163
No match?

319
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:26,251
So, Lily is not your little sister.

320
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:27,419
She isn't, is she?

321
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:38,638
I know you will find her in the future.

322
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:41,975
Even though I'm not sure when,
I think there's a chance.

323
01:23:42,058 --> 01:23:46,396
Because as the technology develops,

324
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:49,733
DNA tests will be more and more common.

325
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:55,530
I don't wanna dwell on it.
There's nothing to do.

326
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,408
It is what it is.

327
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:04,664
However…

328
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:09,210
However, Lily is here today
with her cousins.

329
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:12,172
-I wonder if she's welcome to--
-Let's meet her, then.

330
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:14,966
Let's meet her. She also thinks
it's fate that brought her here.

331
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,093
-It's okay for us to meet her.
-Okay.

332
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:19,387
I'll let her know now.

333
01:24:27,353 --> 01:24:29,522
-Lily.
-I recognize her.

334
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:37,947
You really look alike.

335
01:24:41,284 --> 01:24:43,369
Does she? Does she look like me?

336
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:45,830
A little bit.

337
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,834
Hello, miss.

338
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:51,795
Hello, miss.

339
01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:15,944
-Thank you.
-If you want, I can get more.

340
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:20,031
Come back to China anytime!

341
01:25:25,578 --> 01:25:28,414
She looks like my daughter,
just like the photo showed.

342
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:31,876
Her eyes are like mine, right? Her eyes.

343
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,880
But she's not the one.
There's nothing I can do.

344
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,773
I hoped she was the one.
But it is what it is.

345
01:25:54,774 --> 01:25:58,778
It is not up to what I say, right?

346
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:03,158
We have to go, Mr. Chen.

347
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:05,493
-Okay.
-Thank you, Mrs. Chen.

348
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:06,786
Much obliged.

349
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:20,383
His eyes were watering.

350
01:26:20,466 --> 01:26:24,095
I feel like he's holding, you know,
because he's a man.

351
01:26:24,387 --> 01:26:26,264
He can't cry.

352
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:51,594
Class is starting.

353
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:53,513
What is your nationality?

354
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:55,973
I am Chinese.

355
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:58,726
There are four people in my family.

356
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:01,312
My dad is a businessman.

357
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:04,023
My mom isn't working.

358
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:07,735
My sister is a college student.

359
01:31:47,418 --> 01:31:49,337
Hello, auntie.

360
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:54,509
Let me show you the report.

361
01:31:55,426 --> 01:31:56,928
It must be negative.

362
01:31:59,805 --> 01:32:01,182
Where is my name?

363
01:32:03,267 --> 01:32:04,352
Your name is here.

364
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:06,312
Look.

365
01:32:06,395 --> 01:32:08,439
It shows "Matched."

366
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:15,321
You didn't match with Sadie,
but with another girl born in 2000.

367
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:18,658
Her name is Amanda Phillips.

368
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:21,202
Does she look like me?

369
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:22,662
I think so.

370
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:27,917
She speaks English.

371
01:32:28,584 --> 01:32:29,418
Pardon?

372
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:32,838
She speaks English.
I don't know English.
