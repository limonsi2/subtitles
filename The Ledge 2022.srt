3
00:01:50,536 --> 00:01:52,672
So, here we are,

4
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:56,042
trying to get our packs down
as light as we can.

5
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:58,811
Otherwise, halfway up that rock, they're
going to feel like SUVs on our backs.

6
00:01:58,844 --> 00:01:59,843
We don't want that.

7
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,446
Roger that.

8
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:22,168
<i>Are you ready?</i>

9
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:23,767
<i>I think so.</i>

10
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:33,546
Yeah!

11
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:35,548
Geez. That scared
the crap out of me.

12
00:02:38,817 --> 00:02:41,254
Yeah, come on!
Let's do this!

13
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,422
Come here, big guy.
Give me a hug.

14
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,092
Well, this weekend just got
a whole lot more interesting.

15
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,594
Ah! Smell that air, dudes.

16
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,963
And none of that NYC smog shit
up here, huh?

17
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:53,599
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

18
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:02,139
Get up that mountain!

19
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:08,478
Hmm.

20
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:13,252
Hey, I'm Josh. We just arrived.

21
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:16,255
You, um, <i>parle americano?</i>

22
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:19,258
I'm Sophie. And that's Kelly.

23
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,227
- Hey.
- American.

24
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,592
LA.

25
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:26,599
Sophie,
that was my mother's name.

26
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:29,399
Geez, bud,
is that the best you got?

27
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:34,974
So, me and my boys are wondering if
you wanted to come and, uh, party.

28
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,810
- We're having kind of a celebration.
- What are you celebrating?

29
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,781
Being in the middle of nowhere like four
homos when a couple of movie stars show up.

30
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:44,881
Seriously, dude, 1980 called,
it wants its pickup lines back.

31
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:53,192
Anyway, um,
thanks for the offer, but...

32
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:56,626
Well, if you and your mom
change your mind...

33
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,667
Cheers.

34
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,266
- <i>Ciao.</i>
- <i>Ciao.</i>

35
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:08,841
Hey, the locals, they just tried to climb
the face but couldn't get past the ledge.

36
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,678
They said there's already ice up there.
We're the only ones going up.

37
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,814
Even left some of their gear.

38
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:17,650
Well, what do you expect?
This ain't California.

39
00:04:17,683 --> 00:04:21,120
- Where's Josh?
- Where do you think he is?

40
00:04:21,153 --> 00:04:24,457
- Well, he doesn't waste much time.
- Isn't he supposed to be engaged?

41
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,325
Yeah. To Amy Manners.

42
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:29,128
Taylor and me were talking
on the way out here.

43
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:32,031
We can't keep doing the same shit forever,
man. We're not in college anymore.

44
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,467
We thought with you guys
both living in New York...

45
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,504
I hardly see him. The truth is,
Jessica can't stand him or his fiancÃ©e.

46
00:04:38,537 --> 00:04:40,873
- She won't even have them in the house.
- Holy shit.

47
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,175
We come halfway around the world
to nail some Euro tail

48
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,811
and end up next to
a couple of Cali prick-teasers.

49
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:47,344
What are you fags doing anyway?

50
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:53,085
I'm out there trying to get us laid and
you're here playing with your dicks.

51
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:55,054
In which case, I'm in.

52
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,822
- Oh, shit! No, no.
- Come on!

53
00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:58,924
- No, man.
- Yeah! I love you, dude.

54
00:04:58,957 --> 00:05:01,494
I miss you. Don't believe me?

55
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:04,730
- Can you feel my wood right now?
- Oh, get that thing away from me.

56
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,032
Just because you're working for
some congressman doesn't mean

57
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:09,702
you can forget your friends.
I know stuff about you, don't forget.

58
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:11,771
- Yeah, what's that supposed to mean?
- You know how it is.

59
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:13,272
You're having
a couple of drinks,

60
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:15,541
start to shoot the shit,
and all of a sudden

61
00:05:15,574 --> 00:05:17,843
you're telling a stranger at
a bar how that guy up on TV

62
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:20,079
used to be a crazy son of
a bitch back in the day.

63
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,947
You want more money?
Is that it?

64
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,750
- What did you say?
- Ah! You're hurting me!

65
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:28,020
You might be able to fool those assholes
in Washington your shit don't stink,

66
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:30,389
but don't forget
how far we go back.

67
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:31,955
Get off me!

68
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,992
You're one dumb son of a bitch,
you know that?

69
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,570
- One drink.
- We're planning to leave at first light.

70
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:46,705
And we will, come on.

71
00:05:46,738 --> 00:05:48,705
I'll even let you have
the pretty one.

72
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:53,779
I'm sorry,
that's not what I meant.

73
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,879
You're allowed
to have fun, Kel.

74
00:05:56,582 --> 00:05:59,151
Okay. One drink.

75
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:02,588
Really? Yay, thank you!

76
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:04,423
Stop! Get off me!

77
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:07,824
Get off me
or I'll change my mind.

78
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:12,498
All I'm saying is it takes a woman

79
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:14,667
to know her way around
another woman's body.

80
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,804
I mean, guys just dive in like
they're eating an orange or something.

81
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,507
With girls,
we know what each other wants.

82
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,843
Is that how you keep each other
warm at night in that cabin?

83
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:26,645
Well, yeah.
What do you think this is for?

84
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,679
I just came in my pants.

85
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:33,617
So how long have you guys known each other?
Wait, let me guess.

86
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:36,155
Frat boys, right?

87
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,091
You were the cool kids in college.
Best days of your lives.

88
00:06:39,124 --> 00:06:41,527
And now you're out here
trying to relive your youth.

89
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,129
We met at summer camp
and started climbing.

90
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:45,998
We meet the same week
every year,

91
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,033
pick a spot and away we go.

92
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:49,702
You know where you are, right?

93
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:52,972
The Dolomites.
These are some pretty big rocks.

94
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:55,641
- Well, if you need any help up there...
- We can take care of ourselves.

95
00:06:55,674 --> 00:06:57,510
Okay.

96
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,712
Geez, when you walked
into the store,

97
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:02,515
I'm guessing they didn't
have the big watch that day.

98
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:05,217
Isn't that supposed to say
something about the size of your...

99
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,856
No, wait, that's a car. I bet you have,
what now, a big red, shiny Ferrari?

100
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,626
- Right?
- Ooh. She got you, man.

101
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:16,161
- It's a Maserati.
- Oh, shit!

102
00:07:18,764 --> 00:07:21,800
Now, this baby is
the Ritmo Mundo Quantum Elite,

103
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,802
with personalized
locator beacon.

104
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:27,473
Now, anywhere I am in the world,
I just push this button

105
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:30,809
and all of a sudden a bunch of
secret ninjas come out of nowhere.

106
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:34,246
I'm sure it's really useful when you're
cruising your Maserati through Manhattan.

107
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,016
Oh, so you want to see it?
You want to see? You want to...

108
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:39,718
- Should we meet the ninjas?
- Don't start, man. Don't do it.

109
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,154
- No, no. I'm doing it.
- He's doing this.

110
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:44,690
- No, no. Don't do it.
- She's asked for it. Here come the ninjas.

111
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:47,593
Here we go. They're coming.

112
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:50,260
Ooh, ooh!

113
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:53,165
Maybe not this time.

114
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:54,197
Hallelujah.

115
00:07:58,236 --> 00:08:00,439
- No ninjas today.
- That was close, dude.

116
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:02,038
So, hey, what's your story?

117
00:08:03,976 --> 00:08:05,275
You don't want to know.

118
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:09,114
We're going on Antelao,
taming the king.

119
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:10,282
Oh, so are we.

120
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:11,450
I'm talking sheer.

121
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:12,849
The face?

122
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:15,318
That's 10,000 feet.

123
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,457
You guys are for real, huh?

124
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,893
- How about you guys?
- Uh, you know,

125
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:24,029
we may be pretty high right now,
but we're not crazy.

126
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:27,399
We're taking the scenic route,
up the back passage.

127
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:31,403
Four guys in one cabin? I bet there's
bound to be some back passage involved.

128
00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:33,205
I'm not a fucking asshole man.

129
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,642
I'm going to hit the sack.

130
00:08:39,945 --> 00:08:42,281
- Don't forget this.
- Thanks.

131
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,083
- Um, I kind of like it here.
- Okay.

132
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:45,548
Why don't you stay?

133
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:48,587
Let go of my arm.

134
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,823
- She's tired, man.
- Yeah, man, let her go.

135
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:52,422
Let go of my arm.

136
00:08:58,697 --> 00:09:00,530
Well, your friend's
a real buzzkill.

137
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:07,006
<i>We've been
planning this trip for two years.</i>

138
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:09,441
<i>This is our hero, Luca.</i>

139
00:09:09,474 --> 00:09:11,076
<i>Say hi to the camera, Luca.</i>

140
00:09:11,109 --> 00:09:13,912
<i>Hi to the camera, Luca.</i>

141
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:16,281
<i>Tell them how many times
you've climbed Antelao.</i>

142
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:19,184
<i>Ah,
this is actually number five.</i>

143
00:09:19,217 --> 00:09:21,654
<i>And how does it feel
to be taking a virgin with you?</i>

144
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,356
<i>A virgin? I thought
I was climbing with you today.</i>

145
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,460
- <i>Hey!</i>
- <i>This is Kelly's first attempt to climb Mount Antelao.</i>

146
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:30,560
<i>Stay tuned to see how she...</i>

147
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,224
- Yo, maybe she's had enough.
- Maybe you should shut your mouth.

148
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:07,332
Hey, um, so tomorrow,
why don't we climb with you?

149
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:10,569
What's so funny?

150
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:12,037
Well, you guys are tourists.

151
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,039
Tourists?

152
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,309
Well, yeah. You're taking the
pussy route to the shoulder

153
00:10:17,342 --> 00:10:19,878
and then walking
the path to the top.

154
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,414
I've got a ten-year-old niece
who could do that climb.

155
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:25,317
Why don't I take you back to my
cabin, show you who the pussy is?

156
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,254
Oh. Well, if you don't have the
balls to climb that rock like a man,

157
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:32,357
you're not going to be of any
use to me in that cabin, sweetie.

158
00:10:49,908 --> 00:10:52,578
Hey, guys, can I get in on this?
Sharing is caring, right?

159
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,111
Come on. I need to pee.

160
00:10:57,816 --> 00:11:00,719
Hey, man, maybe you shouldn't.

161
00:11:00,752 --> 00:11:03,522
You know, what with...
with Amy and all.

162
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:07,426
- Amy? Amy who?
- Come on, man.

163
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,395
You think I'm going to dip my dick in the
same grease pot for the next 40 years?

164
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:13,432
I don't know, man.
She's, uh, had a lot to drink.

165
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,100
You guys should cool off.

166
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,534
So says the voice
of marital bliss.

167
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,304
Tell you what, why don't you
put the kids to bed.

168
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,173
Don't wait up.

169
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:33,316
Look, one of us is going
to have to say something. Right?

170
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:35,919
We tell him together?

171
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:42,258
You scared me.

172
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:46,596
Hey, slow down, cowboy.

173
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,603
Get off me! Stop it!

174
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:54,106
- You got a pretty little mouth, don't you?
- Let go of me!

175
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,143
- Fucking bitch!
- No! Leave me...

176
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,344
- Let go of me!
- You hear that?

177
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:09,688
- Stop it! Stop!
- Don't have the balls.

178
00:12:09,721 --> 00:12:11,156
Isn't that what you said?

179
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:20,029
- Fucking... Get the fuck off me!
- Cut it out! Stop it! Stop it!

180
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:22,031
Stop it, both.

181
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,169
What the fuck are you doing?

182
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,702
What happened to your face?

183
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:31,476
We've just got to find her and talk to her.
Okay? You were drunk.

184
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:33,846
- He was trying to rape her!
- It's just a little misunderstanding.

185
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,648
Right, Josh? Right?

186
00:12:36,681 --> 00:12:39,151
- Sure.
- So, we've just got to find her

187
00:12:39,184 --> 00:12:40,550
and talk to her, okay?

188
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,919
Come on.

189
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:47,993
- Sophie!
- Hey, come on, we're not going to hurt you!

190
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:50,629
Sophie, come on.
It's a misunderstanding!

191
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:51,897
Sophie?

192
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,463
Hey, where have you gone?

193
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:55,798
Sophie, come on!

194
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:59,304
- Hey!
- Sophie!

195
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:00,737
Yo, where are you?

196
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:03,773
Sophie, it's okay!

197
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:09,047
Hey, come on, Sophie!

198
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,179
She's over here.

199
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:12,815
There!

200
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:19,589
Get her!

201
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:25,428
Come on.

202
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:37,276
Grab her!

203
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:38,744
Just want to talk to you.

204
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:44,013
She bit me!

205
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:47,984
No, Josh!

206
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,153
No!

207
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,598
Oh, shit.

208
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,254
Help me.

209
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:23,655
She's still breathing.

210
00:14:25,757 --> 00:14:28,160
- What are you doing?
- Calling 911.

211
00:14:28,193 --> 00:14:31,296
- And tell them what?
- There's been an accident and she needs help.

212
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,898
What are you doing?

213
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:35,098
You think they'll believe you?
What about this?

214
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,200
What about the bite marks?

215
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:43,275
How long do you think it'll take for
them to realize there was a fight?

216
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:45,978
But it was an accident.
She... She tripped and fell.

217
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,343
Right, Zach?

218
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,679
Give me your phone.

219
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:55,187
Are you all
out of your fucking minds?

220
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,120
We need to get help!

221
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:01,626
What do we do, Taylor?

222
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:04,296
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding me?

223
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:06,765
Half a mil on a law degree
and you don't know?

224
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:08,700
This is Italy, man.
Who the fuck knows?

225
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:11,503
- What about back home?
- Um...

226
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:15,040
At best, the defense would be
a charge of manslaughter.

227
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:19,111
But with the scratches on your face,
your skin under her fingernails,

228
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:22,514
there's not a prosecutor around who
couldn't convict on a murder charge.

229
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,715
That's 20 years in jail.

230
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:25,183
I told you guys.

231
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,985
I warned you
he would do it again.

232
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:28,820
That was a long time ago!

233
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:35,291
We didn't get caught then.
We're not going to get caught now.

234
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:44,803
She fell from the rock doing
what she loved. Sad, but true.

235
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:46,538
You mean just
leave her like this?

236
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:52,175
Please. Please.

237
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:55,311
No.

238
00:15:57,682 --> 00:15:58,781
We can't do that.

239
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:00,683
What are you doing?

240
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,853
- What does it look like I'm doing?
- No way!

241
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:07,592
Listen to me.

242
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,262
We are not going down for this.

243
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:13,598
We're going to stick together
like we always do.

244
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:16,799
Now you're either with us
or you're against us.

245
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:19,302
So, what's it going to be?

246
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,877
Zach? Taylor?

247
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:32,751
She's still alive.

248
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:33,950
Oh, no!

249
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,023
You can't do this!

250
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:39,555
Jesus Christ, no!

251
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:45,931
Take it.

252
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,363
Josh, she's already dead.

253
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:50,533
Take the rock.

254
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:16,025
You always were a little pussy.

255
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:24,000
Well, now you're just as guilty
as the rest of us.

256
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,272
What do we do now?

257
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:37,547
Fuck.

258
00:17:50,628 --> 00:17:51,761
Wait.

259
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:55,231
Her fingernails.

260
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:09,147
You really think they're going
to believe that someone like her

261
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,049
would try to climb that at night
without ropes?

262
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:12,717
She was wasted.

263
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,787
She was drinking all night
and getting high.

264
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,955
Do you know how much alcohol and
weed they'll find in her body?

265
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:24,896
You guys heard her. She called us
pussies for not climbing the face.

266
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:28,598
Suddenly, she says she can climb the
first 50 feet faster than any of us.

267
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:41,577
We tried to stop her.

268
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:47,516
Nobody who's here says it
happened any other way, right?

269
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:01,631
Oh, my God.

270
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,273
What was that?

271
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:19,284
It's Kelly. The camera.

272
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:20,549
Get her.

273
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:26,122
Go, go, go!

274
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:37,369
Get the camera! Get it! Come on!

275
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:39,035
No, no, no.

276
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:41,170
Where is she?

277
00:19:43,908 --> 00:19:45,443
Kelly, wait!

278
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,343
- Come on, come on!
- Through here! Come on!

279
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:49,712
Come on!

280
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:51,881
Fuck! Get her!

281
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,217
After her! Come on!

282
00:20:02,593 --> 00:20:04,429
Where the fuck is she?
Where is she?

283
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:05,995
Where is she?

284
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:11,936
Fuck!

285
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:14,439
We can't let her
leave with that camera.

286
00:20:14,472 --> 00:20:16,474
- Kelly!
- Go back to the camp.

287
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:20,178
If you find her there,
you stop her and you wait for us.

288
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:22,545
- You got that?
- Okay, okay.

289
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:24,547
We split.

290
00:20:25,316 --> 00:20:26,985
But if you find that bitch,

291
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:30,186
- you hold her, okay?
- All right.

292
00:20:31,222 --> 00:20:32,455
All right.

293
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:58,414
It's okay.
I haven't seen you.

294
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:26,308
Hey! Hey!

295
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,146
Oh, shit! Fuck!

296
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:34,283
She's going for the face!

297
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:46,698
Kelly! Stop!

298
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:47,763
It's over.

299
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,699
Fuck!

300
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,135
Kelly, you're fucking crazy!

301
00:21:54,372 --> 00:21:56,138
Don't do it!

302
00:21:56,908 --> 00:21:58,774
Oh, shit! Fuck!

303
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,659
You get that bitch down, Taylor!

304
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,401
Watch your step!

305
00:22:29,407 --> 00:22:30,506
Go on, Taylor.

306
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:43,719
- Taylor!
- Guys, get the gear!

307
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,656
Fuck this!

308
00:22:48,926 --> 00:22:50,226
Fuck.

309
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:55,664
- Goddamn it.
- Get her down, Taylor!

310
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:04,075
- Get that camera!
- Come on, man!

311
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,713
Oh, shit...

312
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:13,084
Hold on there.

313
00:23:13,117 --> 00:23:14,586
- Come on, Taylor.
- Shit!

314
00:23:42,413 --> 00:23:43,546
Yes!

315
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,790
Oh, my God.

316
00:23:52,823 --> 00:23:55,157
- Looks like his leg's busted bad.
- My leg!

317
00:23:59,363 --> 00:24:02,033
I told you to stop
her getting back to the cabin.

318
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,502
You don't get it, do you?
We're on that camera.

319
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:07,238
We're all on that camera,
including you!

320
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:08,470
Oh, God!

321
00:24:10,675 --> 00:24:12,810
I'm coming for you, bitch!

322
00:24:12,843 --> 00:24:16,679
Do you hear me?
I'm coming for you!

323
00:24:28,893 --> 00:24:32,461
No, no!

324
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:36,401
Breathe, man, breathe.
Hey dude, keep the fire going.

325
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,169
We can see the smoke
and know you're okay.

326
00:24:38,202 --> 00:24:39,904
We can't just leave him
here like this.

327
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,437
Here, I found these
in the girls' cabin.

328
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,581
Here, drink it.

329
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:51,683
- Drink it, man.
- Josh, it's enough, man!

330
00:24:51,716 --> 00:24:54,452
You're going to be okay, dude.
Twenty-four hours, okay?

331
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:56,287
If we're not back by then,
you call for help.

332
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,058
You're going to be all right,
buddy. Okay. Let's go.

333
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:02,558
Got to go, guys. Come on, man.

334
00:25:03,928 --> 00:25:05,060
Wait.

335
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:07,291
<i>You're allowed
to have fun, Kel.</i>

336
00:26:08,392 --> 00:26:09,725
Get off me!

337
00:26:34,985 --> 00:26:37,386
She's too high
to come back down without ropes.

338
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:41,492
Guys.

339
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:44,696
Look what I found.
It's her phone.

340
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,662
- Toss it.
- It's still working.

341
00:26:53,838 --> 00:26:58,142
They said they were going to climb up
the face. None of us can climb that.

342
00:26:58,175 --> 00:27:00,712
You know how cold
it's going to be up there?

343
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,980
She's already lost
half her equipment.

344
00:27:03,013 --> 00:27:06,482
If she doesn't fall, she'll freeze
to death before we even get up there.

345
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:11,489
Let's climb to the shoulder

346
00:27:11,522 --> 00:27:14,123
and take the trail around
the back so we're above her.

347
00:27:15,126 --> 00:27:16,425
She'll have nowhere to go.

348
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:23,165
Shit, I left my gloves
back at the cabin.

349
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:25,667
You two wait here.

350
00:27:38,215 --> 00:27:41,686
Zach, listen to me. We can
tell them the truth about what happened,

351
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:44,856
that Josh killed her and she was
already dead when we dropped her.

352
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:48,526
What about the bite marks on my hand?
They'll know something happened.

353
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,095
Well, she bit you because
Josh made you go after her.

354
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,866
He says all this stuff about us being in
it together, but if it wasn't for him,

355
00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:56,934
none of this shit would be
happening in the first place.

356
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,970
How long have we all
known each other?

357
00:27:59,003 --> 00:28:00,905
I don't remember you complaining
when Mikey Edwards

358
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:02,874
was beating your ass
in the schoolyard.

359
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:06,444
Who was it who stood up
for you then? Josh.

360
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:09,080
That was in the third grade,
for Christ's sake.

361
00:28:09,113 --> 00:28:11,480
We're only here because we
don't have the balls not to be.

362
00:28:15,252 --> 00:28:16,652
You know, I saw him,

363
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,488
when I went back home
for Christmas.

364
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:23,060
He can't walk anymore, man.

365
00:28:23,093 --> 00:28:26,097
He sucks his food up through a straw,
all because of what we did to him.

366
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,566
You need to cut that shit out.

367
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:31,066
You heard what Taylor said.
Twenty years?

368
00:28:33,971 --> 00:28:35,871
We got away with it then.
We'll get away with it now.

369
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:40,042
Now keep your mouth shut
and stick to the fucking plan.

370
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,883
Where the hell is he?

371
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:04,936
I thought I told you to wait.

372
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:06,201
Did you get them?

373
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,270
The gloves?

374
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,241
Let's go.

375
00:29:15,246 --> 00:29:16,478
Come on!

376
00:29:42,006 --> 00:29:45,009
<i>Climbing is like
chess mixed with ballet.</i>

377
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,510
It's all a game.

378
00:29:46,543 --> 00:29:48,911
Use your mind, not your muscles.

379
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:19,788
Fuck!

380
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:38,006
Oh! That is so good!

381
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:56,925
Hey, I got
your follow request, Kelly!

382
00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:02,299
I hope you're not one of these
stalkers I've been reading about.

383
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:08,036
"Met some cute guys climbing.

384
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:12,107
Josh is really hot!"

385
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,179
Oh!

386
00:34:15,212 --> 00:34:17,546
I got a DM from Kelly!

387
00:34:19,316 --> 00:34:20,751
She thinks I'm hot!

388
00:34:20,784 --> 00:34:22,417
Fuck you!

389
00:34:22,886 --> 00:34:24,553
Thanks, Kelly!

390
00:34:57,487 --> 00:35:01,192
Whoo! You go, Kelly!

391
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:04,559
Only a few thousand feet
to climb!

392
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:17,138
He's crazy.

393
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:40,344
- You're doing great.
- Whoo!

394
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:41,543
Yes!

395
00:40:11,902 --> 00:40:14,702
<i>Use your mind,
not your muscles.</i>

396
00:40:23,513 --> 00:40:24,746
Fuck!

397
00:40:30,854 --> 00:40:32,453
Where is she?

398
00:40:42,532 --> 00:40:43,965
Is that you, Kelly?

399
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:50,271
Can you hear me?

400
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:56,844
What took you so long?

401
00:41:06,022 --> 00:41:08,156
All we want is that camera.

402
00:41:12,128 --> 00:41:13,928
We're going to throw
a rope down.

403
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,834
- Take it.
- You tie the camera to the rope

404
00:41:17,867 --> 00:41:20,201
and nobody's going
to get hurt, okay?

405
00:41:44,094 --> 00:41:46,394
Last chance, Kelly!

406
00:42:37,447 --> 00:42:38,680
Hey, hey.

407
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:45,586
I knew you'd see sense, Kelly.

408
00:42:52,962 --> 00:42:55,430
Well, if this
is the way you want it!

409
00:42:58,535 --> 00:42:59,767
What do we do now?

410
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:03,206
She's trapped.

411
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:06,808
She can't come up and she can't go down.
She's lost all her kit.

412
00:43:08,511 --> 00:43:09,711
So we wait.

413
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:52,253
There's no smoke.

414
00:43:57,794 --> 00:44:00,597
You know,
even if we get that camera,

415
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,430
she's still a witness,
don't you?

416
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,836
What are you saying?

417
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:08,205
I'm saying he's not going to
let her off this mountain alive,

418
00:44:08,238 --> 00:44:10,271
that he came up here
to kill her.

419
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,510
He's a psycho, man.

420
00:44:13,543 --> 00:44:16,043
We knew it then
and we know it now.

421
00:44:17,413 --> 00:44:19,180
He was 16 years old.

422
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:24,318
You know what was in my brother's
coffin when they flew him back home?

423
00:44:25,421 --> 00:44:29,290
Sandbags filled with
the same shit sand he died on.

424
00:44:32,996 --> 00:44:35,132
It's what they do when they
can't find enough of the body

425
00:44:35,165 --> 00:44:37,768
to make the crate
feel heavy enough.

426
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:41,304
And then Taylor's sister
starts dating some raghead,

427
00:44:41,337 --> 00:44:44,074
- and you think we were gonna let that slide?
- He was just a kid.

428
00:44:44,107 --> 00:44:48,111
Whether he was a kid or not,
you were there with us.

429
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:51,148
You beat the crap out of him.
You threw him in the back of that truck.

430
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:53,648
You dumped him on the street
the same as we did.

431
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:57,420
We did it for Taylor
and my brother,

432
00:44:57,453 --> 00:44:59,156
because that's what friends do.

433
00:44:59,189 --> 00:45:00,688
So, we just kill her?

434
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:45,626
We need to call Taylor,
see what's happening down there.

435
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:48,598
- Can't do that.
- Why not?

436
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:50,867
Because they'll
check our phone records.

437
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,770
And the story is
we're climbing up here together.

438
00:46:53,803 --> 00:46:56,671
Nobody does anything until we
get that camera, understand?

439
00:47:36,346 --> 00:47:37,712
Hey, look at this.

440
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,921
You must be really hungry
after that climb.

441
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:52,159
Why don't you come and join us?

442
00:48:19,055 --> 00:48:21,188
Don't worry, I've got you.

443
00:48:31,501 --> 00:48:33,670
Hey, look at this.

444
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:36,270
She tried to climb the mountain
before but didn't make it.

445
00:48:37,073 --> 00:48:39,042
It looks like he fell.

446
00:48:39,075 --> 00:48:42,443
Look, see the day it was taken?
It was one year ago tomorrow.

447
00:48:43,479 --> 00:48:45,148
That's why she's here.

448
00:48:45,181 --> 00:48:47,248
She's climbing
in the memory of him.

449
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:34,028
Nighty night, Kelly!

450
00:49:35,364 --> 00:49:37,331
You sleep tight, you hear?

451
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:23,511
Hey, Kelly!

452
00:50:25,515 --> 00:50:29,886
I almost forgot
to say happy anniversary!

453
00:50:29,919 --> 00:50:32,589
What a shame that Luca
couldn't be here,

454
00:50:32,622 --> 00:50:35,089
but he's just so dead!

455
00:51:08,824 --> 00:51:10,457
Wakey wakey, Kelly.

456
00:51:35,818 --> 00:51:36,917
Pull it up.

457
00:51:40,156 --> 00:51:41,255
It's caught on something.

458
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:47,628
Let go. Drop it, drop it.

459
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:54,635
Give me the knife. I've tried to be nice, Kelly.

460
00:51:56,872 --> 00:51:58,939
But now you're
just pissing me off!

461
00:52:31,807 --> 00:52:33,941
<i>You can do this, Kelly.</i>

462
00:53:37,606 --> 00:53:38,741
<i>Nice.</i>

463
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:41,942
Ooh!

464
00:53:45,114 --> 00:53:47,047
Yeah! Oh my God.

465
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:51,354
- I'm shaking.
- Proud of you, Kelly.

466
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:37,700
We've got you now.
Where's the camera?

467
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,233
Give it to me!

468
00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:41,602
Where's the camera?

469
00:54:42,338 --> 00:54:44,171
I said, where's the camera?

470
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:48,075
It's in the bag!
It's in the bag!

471
00:55:03,959 --> 00:55:06,360
Zach,
what's going on down there?

472
00:55:16,872 --> 00:55:19,173
- Josh!
- Zach?

473
00:55:23,712 --> 00:55:25,281
Zach, what's going on, man?

474
00:55:25,314 --> 00:55:27,283
You tell him
we're both on this rope.

475
00:55:27,316 --> 00:55:29,252
He's going to cut it
and kill us both.

476
00:55:29,285 --> 00:55:31,421
So, what now?

477
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:33,856
You're going to have
to swing me back to the wall.

478
00:55:33,889 --> 00:55:35,889
Zach? Come on, man!

479
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:40,430
- Pull me up!
- No!

480
00:55:42,331 --> 00:55:43,900
Pull me up! Pull me up!

481
00:55:43,933 --> 00:55:46,867
- Pull the rope!
- Go!

482
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:48,938
Go!

483
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:50,039
- No!
- Pull it, man!

484
00:55:50,072 --> 00:55:51,274
Josh!

485
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:53,340
- No!
- Go!

486
00:55:55,578 --> 00:55:57,878
Keep hold of that bitch!

487
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:10,760
Oh, God!

488
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:29,843
Holy shit!

489
00:56:36,385 --> 00:56:38,120
- Did you get the camera?
- No!

490
00:56:38,153 --> 00:56:40,587
Fuck. Fuck!

491
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:38,812
Where the fuck
are the painkillers?

492
00:57:40,449 --> 00:57:41,582
Fuck.

493
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:48,925
Go to Italy, bang some chicks,

494
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:51,394
get high and climb a rock.

495
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:52,929
That's what you said.

496
00:57:52,962 --> 00:57:55,264
We have to stop this thing now.

497
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:57,733
She can't come up and she'll
never make it back down.

498
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:01,037
When she falls,
the camera falls with her

499
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:02,505
and it'll be smashed to pieces.

500
00:58:02,538 --> 00:58:04,540
It'll look like
they both just fell.

501
00:58:04,573 --> 00:58:06,442
We say Taylor fell with them

502
00:58:06,475 --> 00:58:08,878
and snapped his leg,
but he managed to hold on,

503
00:58:08,911 --> 00:58:10,877
and we carried him
back to the cabin.

504
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:12,980
And you agree with him?

505
00:58:16,485 --> 00:58:17,618
Okay.

506
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:21,424
This is a democracy,
after all.

507
00:58:21,457 --> 00:58:23,557
We head back down
at first light.

508
00:58:25,394 --> 00:58:27,828
I'll call Amy and tell her
there's been an accident.

509
00:58:28,831 --> 00:58:29,963
She'll send help.

510
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:51,485
<i>I think I'm going
to take you to Antelao.</i>

511
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:53,789
You mean the Dolomites?

512
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:55,322
Yeah, you're ready.

513
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:58,992
Maybe.

514
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:20,213
Reynolds.

515
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:25,921
You've got to get me off this
mountain before I bleed to death, man.

516
00:59:25,954 --> 00:59:28,357
Taylor will have called
for help by now.

517
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:31,193
We said 24 hours, remember?
They should be here soon.

518
00:59:31,226 --> 00:59:33,393
We've got to get off
this mountain on our own.

519
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:36,165
What do you mean?

520
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,765
You know when Josh went back
to the cabin to get his gloves?

521
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:42,469
I think he went back there
and killed Taylor.

522
00:59:44,473 --> 00:59:47,643
You know what he said
about calling Amy for help?

523
00:59:47,676 --> 00:59:50,846
He hasn't spoken to her for six months.
Why would he call her now?

524
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:53,049
Well, I thought you said
they were engaged.

525
00:59:53,082 --> 00:59:55,785
She caught him cheating on her.

526
00:59:55,818 --> 00:59:58,621
She was in town picking out
a wedding dress.

527
00:59:58,654 --> 01:00:01,755
She sees him going into a hotel
with some blonde.

528
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:04,527
Turns out they meet there
every week,

529
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,260
checking in as man and wife
for the past two years.

530
01:00:09,198 --> 01:00:12,201
She tells her father
who's already 30 million down

531
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:13,934
from Josh's fuck-ups
at the firm.

532
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:17,604
He's been kicked out
of the house, man.

533
01:00:18,273 --> 01:00:19,840
There is no wedding.

534
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:24,978
Look, if I'm right, he'll have
Taylor's phone in his pack.

535
01:00:26,448 --> 01:00:28,014
Nobody's coming, man.

536
01:00:28,884 --> 01:00:30,753
It's up to you
to get us out of here.

537
01:00:30,786 --> 01:00:32,119
How?

538
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,157
The watch.

539
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:36,926
The emergency beacon.

540
01:00:36,959 --> 01:00:39,161
You've got to get to it.
Send a signal.

541
01:00:39,194 --> 01:00:43,566
- We don't even know if that thing works.
- Look, I'm dying here, man.

542
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,800
And he's going to kill you too
if you don't do something.

543
01:01:28,944 --> 01:01:31,580
If you wanted to know the time
you could have just asked.

544
01:01:34,283 --> 01:01:36,750
Josh, that's enough, man!

545
01:01:37,786 --> 01:01:39,319
Josh! Stop it!

546
01:01:48,297 --> 01:01:50,399
You Judas prick son of a bitch.

547
01:01:50,432 --> 01:01:52,334
You think I don't hear
you two gossiping?

548
01:01:52,367 --> 01:01:54,568
You choose her over me?

549
01:01:56,038 --> 01:01:58,941
She's just a whore
like the rest of them.

550
01:01:58,974 --> 01:02:05,114
There isn't a single woman alive with a
loyal fucking bone in their entire body.

551
01:02:05,147 --> 01:02:07,414
Am I right, Zach? Tell him.

552
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:10,750
Oh, that's right.

553
01:02:11,653 --> 01:02:13,386
You don't even know.

554
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,526
What are you talking about?

555
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:20,460
I'm talking about this chick
I've been banging since college.

556
01:02:21,396 --> 01:02:24,266
Boyfriend doesn't know
a thing about it.

557
01:02:24,299 --> 01:02:26,535
We meet at the hotel around
the corner from their place,

558
01:02:26,568 --> 01:02:29,636
when he thinks
she's doing Pilates

559
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:34,276
every Friday night.

560
01:02:34,309 --> 01:02:37,880
That's how he thinks she's
keeping that ass of hers in shape,

561
01:02:37,913 --> 01:02:40,115
when the truth is,
I'm holding a pillow over her head

562
01:02:40,148 --> 01:02:42,651
and banging that
tight little peach.

563
01:02:42,684 --> 01:02:44,951
You know what
the funniest part of it is?

564
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:48,023
She tells him she hates me,

565
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:50,726
can't stand to have me
in the house.

566
01:02:50,759 --> 01:02:54,830
- And that way he doesn't suspect a thing.
- You son of a bitch.

567
01:02:54,863 --> 01:02:58,298
How else do you think Jessica
learned to be so good at blow jobs?

568
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,809
You knew about this?

569
01:03:10,779 --> 01:03:12,012
And Taylor?

570
01:03:14,449 --> 01:03:16,316
What, so you
all knew except me?

571
01:03:17,686 --> 01:03:20,222
What were you all doing?
Laughing behind my back?

572
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:22,522
- It wasn't like that.
- Then what was it like?

573
01:03:25,861 --> 01:03:27,327
You're supposed to be my friend.

574
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:35,435
Hey, bitch! Can you hear me?

575
01:03:36,571 --> 01:03:39,108
You fucked my buddy up
pretty good.

576
01:03:39,141 --> 01:03:42,278
I mean, a girl's got to do
what a girl's got to do

577
01:03:42,311 --> 01:03:46,046
in this world to survive,
but that shit's fucked up.

578
01:03:47,783 --> 01:03:49,482
Is it money you want?

579
01:03:50,585 --> 01:03:52,588
A girl like you would have
to be down on her knees

580
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:55,090
sucking cock for
the next 50 years

581
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,324
to earn the kind of money
we could give you.

582
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,860
How much do you want
for that camera, huh?

583
01:04:02,431 --> 01:04:04,066
200 grand?

584
01:04:04,099 --> 01:04:05,498
Half a mil?

585
01:04:06,234 --> 01:04:08,134
Everybody has a price.

586
01:04:09,104 --> 01:04:11,740
You could be
on a beach somewhere,

587
01:04:11,773 --> 01:04:15,008
topping up that tan,
forget this ever happened.

588
01:04:23,919 --> 01:04:29,522
Okay, then. When the shit hits the
fan, don't forget I tried to be nice.

589
01:06:03,051 --> 01:06:03,983
Zach?

590
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:09,989
- Where's Zach?
- Took the trail down.

591
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:14,260
Said he could make it there
by first light.

592
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:18,200
Soon as he gets to Taylor,
he'll make the call

593
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:19,599
and get someone up here.

594
01:06:22,137 --> 01:06:23,503
I called Amy.

595
01:06:25,373 --> 01:06:27,774
Told her there had been
an accident but we were okay.

596
01:06:30,645 --> 01:06:32,479
It's just you and me now, buddy.

597
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:36,316
We have to finish this
before they get here.

598
01:06:55,003 --> 01:06:56,202
I'll go.

599
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,442
You don't send a boy
to do a man's job.

600
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:02,778
She knows you're going
down there to kill her.

601
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:05,547
That means she isn't going
to give you that camera.

602
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:08,550
I'll tell her we'll follow
Zachary back down the trail.

603
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:12,121
When we get to the bottom,
it'll be her word against the four of us.

604
01:07:12,154 --> 01:07:14,490
And when I get close enough,

605
01:07:14,523 --> 01:07:15,655
I'll kill her.

606
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:19,225
Give me the hammer.

607
01:07:20,795 --> 01:07:22,162
The hammer!

608
01:07:46,655 --> 01:07:49,791
Hey, hey, I'm not going to hurt you.

609
01:07:49,824 --> 01:07:53,560
I'm not going to hurt you.
I... I brought you some food.

610
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:07,807
I'm sorry about your friend.

611
01:08:10,011 --> 01:08:12,548
- You killed her.
- I didn't kill her.

612
01:08:12,581 --> 01:08:14,550
Josh hit her and she fell
and hit her head.

613
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:16,718
It was his idea
to throw her off that ledge

614
01:08:16,751 --> 01:08:19,821
- and make it look like she fell.
- Why would I believe you?

615
01:08:19,854 --> 01:08:22,958
Because I'm your only chance
of getting out of here alive.

616
01:08:22,991 --> 01:08:25,992
You know he's going to kill you unless
you give him what he wants, don't you?

617
01:08:26,995 --> 01:08:29,364
Give me the camera.
I'll say I grabbed it

618
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:30,930
and pushed you off the mountain.

619
01:08:31,866 --> 01:08:34,136
Zachary, the guy
you attacked yesterday.

620
01:08:34,169 --> 01:08:35,904
He's gone back down the trail.

621
01:08:35,937 --> 01:08:38,071
He'll get help.
He'll tell them you're up here.

622
01:08:40,108 --> 01:08:41,507
Your friend,

623
01:08:42,444 --> 01:08:44,513
he's not going to tell
anybody anything.

624
01:08:44,546 --> 01:08:46,582
What are you talking about?

625
01:08:46,615 --> 01:08:48,014
He's dead.

626
01:08:49,351 --> 01:08:51,420
I saw his body
drop from that ledge.

627
01:08:51,453 --> 01:08:53,319
That's a lie.

628
01:08:54,022 --> 01:08:57,924
I stabbed a knife in his leg.

629
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:01,294
Do you really think he got up
and walked out of here?

630
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:05,865
Bet you didn't see him leave,
did you?

631
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:09,168
And do you know what that means?

632
01:09:10,038 --> 01:09:12,007
That means you're next.

633
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:15,441
So, it really doesn't matter whether
I give you the camera or not.

634
01:09:16,978 --> 01:09:21,583
Because he's going to kill me.
And then he's going to kill you.

635
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:24,686
If you don't give me the camera, he's
gonna come down here and get it himself.

636
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,052
Is that what you want?

637
01:09:33,428 --> 01:09:34,527
Okay.

638
01:09:51,913 --> 01:09:53,646
Now scream.

639
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:56,985
If you don't scream,

640
01:09:57,018 --> 01:09:58,885
I'll have to make you scream.

641
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:05,758
What's going on down there?

642
01:10:10,465 --> 01:10:12,234
- Pull me up.
- Did you get the camera?

643
01:10:12,267 --> 01:10:13,468
- Pull me up!
- Did you get it?

644
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:14,434
I got it!

645
01:10:15,637 --> 01:10:17,906
- Let me see it.
- What is wrong with you? I got it!

646
01:10:17,939 --> 01:10:19,272
What about her?

647
01:10:20,141 --> 01:10:21,341
It's over.

648
01:10:21,976 --> 01:10:23,412
I didn't see her.

649
01:10:23,445 --> 01:10:26,415
Hey, I said I'd take care
of it and I did.

650
01:10:26,448 --> 01:10:27,680
Now pull me up!

651
01:10:38,993 --> 01:10:40,293
Give me the camera.

652
01:10:48,503 --> 01:10:50,005
Where's the memory card?

653
01:10:50,038 --> 01:10:52,872
- The memory card isn't in the camera.
- What?

654
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,043
She must have taken it out.

655
01:10:55,076 --> 01:10:56,609
Kidding me!

656
01:11:02,417 --> 01:11:05,485
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling Taylor.

657
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:26,672
Oh, God!

658
01:11:49,397 --> 01:11:52,167
Josh, what... No, what the...

659
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,769
No, no, Josh.

660
01:11:53,802 --> 01:11:58,371
- No. Josh, no.
- I'm sending you a gift, Kelly!

661
01:11:59,073 --> 01:12:00,609
I hope you like it.

662
01:12:00,642 --> 01:12:03,578
No, no!

663
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:06,615
Fireworks for your anniversary,
Kelly!

664
01:12:06,648 --> 01:12:08,350
Oh, God!

665
01:13:11,713 --> 01:13:13,546
Oh...

666
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:36,638
No!

667
01:13:36,671 --> 01:13:38,137
No!

668
01:14:00,695 --> 01:14:02,295
<i>Come on, Kelly.</i>

669
01:14:19,781 --> 01:14:21,314
Time's up, Kelly.

670
01:16:09,824 --> 01:16:11,292
It's over.

671
01:16:11,325 --> 01:16:13,261
Now give me the card
and I'll make it quick.

672
01:16:13,294 --> 01:16:16,362
You're never, ever
getting that card.

673
01:16:19,834 --> 01:16:22,368
Give me the card!

674
01:16:26,474 --> 01:16:29,010
It doesn't matter
what you do to me,

675
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:31,680
because I've hidden it
somewhere on this wall.

676
01:16:31,713 --> 01:16:33,779
And one day,
someone's going to find it.

677
01:16:47,662 --> 01:16:49,128
I'll make a trade with you.

678
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:53,499
The card for the ring.

679
01:16:55,103 --> 01:16:56,569
Now, where is it?

680
01:16:58,406 --> 01:17:00,106
It's in a hole
in the wall over there.

681
01:17:01,209 --> 01:17:03,109
I've hidden it in a bag inside.

682
01:17:05,613 --> 01:17:07,580
You'd better not
be fucking with me.

683
01:17:17,191 --> 01:17:18,924
Bitch!

684
01:17:50,224 --> 01:17:51,860
Please.

685
01:17:51,893 --> 01:17:53,192
Please, help me.

686
01:17:53,995 --> 01:17:55,161
Help me!

687
01:17:58,132 --> 01:17:59,198
Help me.

688
