<i>Do not get trapped in
desperate quests for love.</i>

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,083
<i>We acknowledge your generation's
right to be happy.</i>

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,541
<i>We will find your true soulmate for life.</i>

00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:58,416
<i>A bright future awaits you</i>

7
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,833
Wow! this gives me goosebumps

8
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:12,750
It's all because of
the narrator's voice, right? So fatherly.

9
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,250
Every time I see you post
childhood pictures with your dad,

10
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,916
I'm always envious.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,666
I've never experienced moments like that.

12
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,916
Ulfah can only post pictures of her dad.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,083
It's obvious that she has no choice.

14
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:27,333
I've long accepted that life isn't fair.

15
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,625
I actually want to be like you, Ul.

16
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't have to stress over replying
to all these guys' comments.

17
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,583
The point is,
we're going to find everything

18
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:39,291
we've been searching for at The Light.

19
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,625
And we can always be together.

20
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,208
<i>Today, I'm just grateful
to be chosen by The Light</i>

21
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,458
<i>along with my childhood BFFs.</i>

22
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,666
<i>Almost all girls
have their own version of a dream wedding.</i>

23
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:57,250
<i>In this uncertain era,
many of us become numb,</i>

24
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:58,875
<i>losing hope.</i>

25
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,916
<i>After the pandemic,
our space to grow is still limited.</i>

26
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,416
Are we there yet?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,208
I'm so nervous.

28
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:11,333
<i>Many of us have never
even directly experienced</i>

29
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,958
<i>the beauty of forests and nature.</i>

30
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,125
The last time I saw green forests
surroundings like this

31
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,666
was seven years ago.

32
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,583
My mom said that
after the pandemic, the world rapidly aged

33
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,083
and that's probably why she's depressed.

34
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,666
<i>Well… I'm Salina.</i>

35
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,041
<i>My late father used to teach me
to believe in dream manifestations.</i>

36
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,083
The Light is going to be
beautiful like this, right?

37
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,458
-What's wrong?
-What's happening?

38
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,541
What's going on?

39
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,625
Let's see.

40
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,375
Hurry up.

41
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,708
Oh, my goodness!

42
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,625
Help us, sir.

43
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,416
-Are you okay?
-Don't worry. I wasn't hit.

44
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,750
-I was only shocked.
-Are you hurt anywhere?

45
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,000
I saw the big bus and fell.

46
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,500
-Maybe you should walk with her, sir.
-No need. I'm fine.

47
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,000
Here, let me help.

48
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,583
Watch your step.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,416
Careful, ma'am.

50
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,416
You're the one who ought
to beware, young one.

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,625
Yes, ma'am.

52
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,208
Come on, let's move.

53
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:27,458
<i>And definitely, at The Light,
all of my dreams will become reality.</i>

54
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,333
<i>We have arrived at
The Light Training Center.</i>

55
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,500
<i>-Please get off the bus carefully.</i>
-Thank you.

56
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,250
<i>-We will distribute your luggage.</i>
-You are welcome. Hello!

57
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,250
I'm Santi. This is my husband, Iwan.

58
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,500
-Good morning.
-Look towards the camera.

59
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,250
Straight at the camera. So beautiful.

00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,166
CLASS OF JANUARY 2030
REGISTERED

61
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,583
Okay.

62
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,333
Please enjoy yourself.

63
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,958
-Salina.
-You guys are free to explore The Light.

64
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,416
You have 15 minutes to explore.

65
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,375
The map of The Light
has already been sent so don't get lost.

66
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,833
-Thanks!
-How nice!

67
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,500
Is this for real?

68
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,625
<i>Congratulations, Salina.</i>

69
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,708
<i>You have become a part
of The Light's family.</i>

70
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:33,791
<i>From now on, we shall make all
your dreams and aspirations come true.</i>

71
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,500
<i>All your dreams…</i>

72
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,666
<i>And congratulations, Hafiz.
By becoming a part of The Light,</i>

73
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,791
<i>you don't need to worry.</i>

74
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,125
<i>Everyone here is considered equal.</i>

75
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,291
<i>We don't believe in rich or poor.</i>

76
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,458
<i>Welcome to The Light, Tara.</i>

77
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:52,208
<i>We accept members
regardless of their past.</i>

78
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,625
How much do they know?

79
00:04:56,708 --> 00:05:00,750
I bet they did a ton of research on us
before accepting us.

80
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,958
But they still want me, how come?

81
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,458
That's a good thing!

82
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,250
I wonder why.

83
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,958
<i>Did you know that 20% of all profits
from my makeup line</i>

84
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,625
<i>are donated to people with disabilities?</i>

85
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:17,166
<i>You can fight the good fight
by swiping right, right now.</i>

86
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:22,166
So cute! So precious!

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,750
Excuse us. Ul, let's go.

88
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,375
-Excuse me.
-Go ahead.

89
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:37,291
<i>This is the reality that
your generation has to face</i>

90
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,625
<i>after the pandemic
that happened ten years ago.</i>

91
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,583
<i>Plastic continues to contaminate
our sea and land,</i>

92
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,958
<i>hazardous waste polluting most of the soil</i>

93
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,833
<i>on our planet.</i>

94
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,333
<i>Soon our ocean will die.</i>

95
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,958
<i>Global warming is at its peak.</i>

96
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,500
<i>All beings' quality of life</i>

97
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,458
<i>is in critical condition.</i>

98
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,583
<i>Birth rate has been drastically declining,</i>

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,125
<i>incomparable to the death rate.</i>

100
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,916
<i>Will the human race survive?</i>

101
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,291
<i>Only at The Light</i>

102
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:34,083
<i>can you be a real agent of change.</i>

103
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,333
Welcome to The Light!

104
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,791
You came here

105
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,541
with a clear purpose.

106
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,833
Now, I'd like all of you
to repeat after me.

107
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,791
On my cue.

108
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,708
But in order to do that,

109
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,125
you need a support system.

110
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,583
For a sustainable future.

111
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,625
You need to be married,

112
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,083
not just dating.

113
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,666
Find the ideal spouse.

114
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,083
And you do not need to worry.

115
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:49,208
At The Light, we have
prepared everything for you.

116
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,083
Now, I proudly present

117
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,333
my number one support system.

118
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,375
My wife, Sofia.

119
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,208
Ten years ago,

120
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,541
the prototype
of the matchmaking system I invented

121
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,333
led us to each other.

122
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,125
Good morning, everyone.

123
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,000
I am well aware

124
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,666
that you're all at the age
of raging hormones.

125
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,500
And that is the perfect time for you

126
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:36,000
to practice abstinence and control.

127
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,166
Yes.

128
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,625
Keep this in mind. Control.

129
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:43,125
Control the lust and urge to date.

130
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:45,500
Because there will come a time

131
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:49,458
where all of you here will be married
to your perfect match.

132
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:53,333
Rest assured
that each of your future spouses

133
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,208
are here in the training center.

134
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,000
However, if any of you
are still feeling doubtful…

135
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,291
that's normal.

136
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,000
Does anyone want to share their feelings?

137
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,708
Please don't hesitate. We're here for you,

138
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,625
so please raise your hand.

139
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,000
You.

140
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,125
Salina.

141
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,625
Thanks for raising your hand.

142
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,333
I reckon the three of you…

143
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,625
are best friends?

144
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,125
I notice that Tara, in the middle,

145
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,750
is keeping her head down.

146
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,416
Is there anything wrong?

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,083
Tara?

148
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,916
Excuse me.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,833
Tara.

150
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,666
I…

151
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,791
I don't think…

152
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,916
I deserve to be here.

153
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,375
Why?

154
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:52,875
I…

155
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,083
I've been dating

156
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,000
since sixth grade.

157
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,875
I switched boyfriends around a lot.

158
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,375
I'm not here to judge you, Tara.

159
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,666
What's your biggest wish at this moment?

160
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:20,750
I…

161
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,916
I want to apologize…

162
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,125
to everyone

163
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,583
that I've hurt.

164
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:39,208
But I can't.

165
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,083
Okay.

166
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,083
What you have to do…

167
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,375
is to forgive yourself.

168
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,791
Will you do that?

169
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,416
Now, I would like

170
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,916
everyone in this room…

171
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,750
to stand up.

172
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,041
We should support Tara,

173
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,500
we should send positive energy to her.

174
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,541
Close your eyes.

175
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:31,458
Put your right hand on your chest.

176
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,625
Feel the rhythm

177
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,541
of your heartbeat.

178
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,208
Inhale…

179
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,708
Exhale.

180
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,500
Whisper to your heart…

181
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:56,250
Forgive all of your past mistakes.

182
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,750
You may slowly open your eyes.

183
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,375
Reset and start over, okay?

184
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,458
Salina.

185
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,416
You have been an excellent friend to Tara.

186
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,750
Now I want to ask you a question.

187
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:47,916
Are you willing to accept all of us here,

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,250
including me…

189
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,916
as your new family?

190
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,166
So?

191
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,625
Are you relieved?

192
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,791
I only hope that…

193
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:20,458
those who got hurt
from that highway accident

194
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,125
would forgive me.

195
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:27,666
It was your ex, Andi,
who drove that car, not you.

196
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,083
Yeah, but I started kissing him

197
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,125
so he lost control of the wheel.

198
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,416
Tara…

199
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,375
Just remember what Ali said to us earlier.

200
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,208
Here, we have to reset and start over.

201
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,166
I'm happy

202
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,125
to see you calm like this, Na.

203
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,375
It's only today that I feel
so protected as if I have a dad again.

204
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,458
Ali's future child

205
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,666
is going to be so lucky.

206
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,375
It's also the first time that
I don't feel insecure about myself.

207
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,666
I'm ready

208
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,666
for whoever my partner will be.

209
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:29,000
You're so lucky to be the first
to turn 17, Ul.

210
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,541
It's going to be beautiful, Ul.

211
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,666
You have chosen training programs

212
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,541
in the fields you're passionate about.

213
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,750
We have prepared the best mentors for you.

214
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,750
The girls' dormitory

215
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,458
will be supervised by Ms. Nanik.

216
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,458
She will act as a mother to you all.

217
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,750
I will now read you the house rules.

218
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,333
First rule.

219
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,833
<i>Keep your rooms clean and tidy.</i>

220
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,666
<i>Our Extraordinary Leader</i>

221
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,708
<i>has built all these accommodations
and facilities</i>

222
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,666
<i>for us to maintain together.</i>

223
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,333
<i>Secondly, everyone is expected
to get up and get ready</i>

224
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,250
<i>at 5 a.m.</i>

225
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,750
Good morning, Tara.
It's already five past five o'clock.

226
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,708
<i>Third rule. There is only one
mandatory class</i>

227
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,666
<i>for all members,</i>

228
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,875
<i>which is home economics.</i>

229
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,958
<i>Fourth. In order to protect you
from lustful urges,</i>

230
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,333
<i>members of the opposite sex
are forbidden to meet</i>

231
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,458
<i>other than for work purposes.</i>

232
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,250
<i>Fifth. Our shuttle vans</i>

233
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,166
<i>can only be used for work purposes,</i>

234
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,791
<i>and everyone is obligated</i>

235
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,125
<i>to return to the dormitories by 8 p.m.</i>

236
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,791
You will only live here
for a maximum of one year

237
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,208
until you get married

238
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,791
at 17.

239
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,375
<i>After getting married,
you will transfer to</i>

240
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,791
<i>and live independently</i>

241
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,416
<i>in the apartments
built specially by The Light.</i>

242
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,666
Automatically,
this will make you property owners,

243
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,208
which is a rare privilege these days.

244
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,625
Optimize the teachings of The Light

245
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:15,291
and spread them to your family,
friends, and the world.

246
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,666
<i>Female activists are gathering signatures</i>

247
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,000
<i>for a petition to raise the
legal marital age in this country</i>

248
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,375
<i>from 17 to 19 years old.</i>

249
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,333
<i>Meanwhile, The Light,</i>

250
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,916
<i>an educational institution
for youth training</i>

251
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,500
<i>led by the handsome
and charismatic Ali Khan,</i>

252
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:43,041
<i>has managed to gather many more signatures</i>

253
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:47,500
<i>to maintain the legal marital age
at 17 years old.</i>

254
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,875
All the news outlets

255
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,166
always use the words
handsome and charismatic

256
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,000
to describe you these days.

257
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,583
Turn around.

258
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,458
It's our third time.

259
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,165
Let's hope it works this time.

260
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,875
Okay. Stay still.

261
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,875
Almost there.

262
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,458
Remember. God is testing us.

263
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,291
Our child will be perfect.

264
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,916
Today, you will all be trained

265
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,333
to present yourselves on social media

266
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,291
as a new person

267
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,500
who will redefine beauty
to be healthy and natural.

268
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,291
In front of you are several products.

269
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,291
You are free to make captions
and take photos as you will,

270
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:04,750
just make sure to include
the hashtag #BeautyAlaSofia.

271
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,291
But beforehand,

272
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,500
you must change your
profile picture and delete

273
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:14,791
all your pre-existing social media feeds.

274
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,708
We will all start anew with a clean slate.

275
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:21,958
Tara.

276
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,708
I know

277
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,750
you have the most followers
among everyone.

278
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,375
This must be hard for you.

279
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:46,083
I will make a new line
for tan-skinned girls like you.

280
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,000
Do you want to help me develop it?

281
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,208
Seriously?

282
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,500
I feel like hugging you!

283
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:59,541
Not here.
This is still confidential. Okay?

284
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,750
Got it.

285
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,000
Attention! We'll go to the city

286
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,375
to practice shooting content.
After that, we'll come back here.

287
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,416
Good morning, everyone!

288
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
-Good morning!
-Morning, sir.

289
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,000
Joko Liauw!

290
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,500
I've watched his video

291
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,666
about the origins of the pandemic virus
a thousand times!

292
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,208
Welcome to The Light's content lab.

293
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,333
You have chosen to be
The Light's content creators.

294
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,541
Keep this in mind.

295
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,458
The media is our strength.

296
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,291
Contents are our weapons.

297
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,916
As for this man standing next to me,
he does not need any introductions.

298
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,958
Your duty is to create content

299
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,041
that can garner the most likes.

300
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,416
If you succeed,

301
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,916
one of you

302
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,541
will have the honor

303
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,458
of working with me

304
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,791
on a prestigious

305
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,416
documentary project.

306
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
-That's right.
-As…

307
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,583
a co-dir.

308
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,000
"Co-dir" means

309
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,416
co-director.

310
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,708
What does the job entail?

311
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:02,750
That depends.

312
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,708
If I'm not in the mood,

313
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,750
you have to do the job.

314
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,125
If I get confused on
how to direct some scenes,

315
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,916
you'll be the one doing the thinking.

316
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,333
But this is about teamwork.

317
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,083
That's right.
That's the most important thing.

318
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,000
Teamwork, however small,

319
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,916
is key.

320
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,041
-Best of luck!
-Thank you!

321
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,250
Do your best!

322
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,291
Let's go, guys,

323
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,291
make teams of two.

324
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,125
Once you've found
your teammate, follow me.

325
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,500
Hurry now. We don't have much time.

326
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,333
I'm better at editing. Is that fine?

327
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,416
Perfect, because I prefer filming.

328
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,333
Let's go.

329
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,041
All right, you can spread out.
Be back within two hours.

330
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,791
The more shots you can get of
immoral attitudes and behaviors,

331
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,666
such as extramarital hand-holding
and kissing,

332
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,416
girls wearing miniskirts,
the more the better, okay?

333
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,583
Got it!

334
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,000
Hurry now!

335
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,625
What a ridiculous instruction.

336
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,750
We'll work with what we get.

337
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,750
VERBAL ABUSE IS NOT TRIVIAL ISSUE

338
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,125
Salina?

339
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,833
Hi, do I know you?

340
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,333
I was your senior in middle school.

341
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,000
I can't believe you've joined The Light!

342
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,833
Sorry, I'm doing an assignment.

343
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:42,833
No, wait!

344
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,666
I managed to leave The Light.

345
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,500
Don't believe their propaganda.

346
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,708
Leave before it's too late.

347
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,333
Just search the keywords, Arya Teja!

348
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,583
-Let's turn right.
-Okay.

349
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,583
Who are you?

350
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,750
-Sorry, it's for a school assignment.
-About what?

351
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,125
-About people dating.
-The hell you are.

352
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,000
Dating? This is my husband!

353
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,875
-I'm sorry!
-Screw you!

354
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,541
I'm sorry!

355
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,416
<i>Judgy title bitch!
Don't you see we are old?</i>

356
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,875
<i>Let it go, honey.</i>

357
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,583
Hafiz, this definitely needs
your magic touch.

358
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:20,583
Please make it work.

359
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,666
I'm sorry…

360
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,375
I couldn't capture anything good.

361
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,666
Relax.

362
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,833
I can combine them with my footage.

363
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:41,125
But your footage is only shots
of ads and posters…

364
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,000
Be patient.

365
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,208
Is there anything I can see?

366
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,041
Yes, there is.

367
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:05,750
<i>-Screw you, bitch!
-Enough, darling.</i>

368
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:07,708
<i>Stupid bitch!</i>

369
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,125
<i>Have mercy.</i>

370
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,250
<i>You dumb idiot!</i>

371
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:12,416
<i>Let it go, honey.</i>

372
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,125
NO DATING, NO VIOLENCE

373
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,583
I'm speechless.

374
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,916
I love this one.

375
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:32,916
Don't be scared

376
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,875
to explore different styles.

377
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,875
Improvise.

378
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,708
Our admins…

379
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:44,458
will only upload your best works.

380
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,500
Okay?

381
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,041
Go on.

382
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,208
-Good job, Iwan.
-Thank you, sir.

383
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,666
All right, improvise!
Dig deep for new ideas!

384
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,666
Thank you, Fiz.

385
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,916
It's a bit slippery here.

386
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,333
Watch your steps.

387
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,750
The almonds here are so plentiful.

388
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,250
But I still couldn't bring myself
to eat all of them.

389
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:16,958
Why not?

390
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,958
Go to town with it.

391
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,583
They're so expensive in the city.

392
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:23,666
That's right,

393
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,583
the almonds are among
the most popular items in my Light Mart.

394
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:31,250
But I think the packaging can be
redesigned to be more appealing.

395
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,958
If you have ideas
for the packaging, you should draw them.

396
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,916
We can present them to The Extraordinary.

397
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,125
Are you sure I'm allowed to do that?

398
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:39,208
Of course.

399
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,916
Oh, both my husband and son are here.

400
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,750
How nice, to be able to come home
with your husband and son.

401
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:52,041
Little baby, you're so cute.

402
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,625
Hi, little baby.

403
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:54,916
What's his name?

404
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Edy.

405
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:58,333
Hi, baby Edy.

406
00:24:58,416 --> 00:24:59,750
You're so cute!

407
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,791
Your time will come, Ul.

408
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,875
Okay.

409
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,125
Bye, you!

410
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:12,375
Bye!

411
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,375
See you soon.

412
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:27,041
EDITING LAB AT THE LIGHT

413
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,875
Hi.

414
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,000
Just for you girls.

415
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,666
Are you sure you can give these away?

416
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,833
Of course!

417
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:54,416
Plus, I'm the only one
Sofia gave extra bottles to.

418
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:58,333
I have a confession to make.

419
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:04,333
I actually feel so at home here.

420
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,250
And surprisingly,
I don't miss dating at all.

421
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,041
And I love your new image on social.

422
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,333
Wait, I haven't seen it.

423
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,875
A lot of people unfollowed me
and bashed me

424
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,916
for being part of The Light.

425
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,583
But I have gained even more
new followers ever since.

426
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,416
There are bound to be haters

427
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,000
trying to bring down The Light.

428
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:32,750
That's right.

429
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:36,500
Welcome, Father.

430
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:48,958
I really like the renovations
you've done to this house.

431
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,625
Sofia.

432
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,041
Thanks, Father.

433
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:58,708
I'm certain

434
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:03,666
that your establishment
will bring in a revolution.

435
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,833
It's still in its early stages, Father.

436
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,625
Since you were a boy, I've always known

437
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:12,583
you'll be a great leader.

438
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,541
We have started

439
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:17,791
planting the seeds.

440
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,791
And soon, you'll reap your harvest.

441
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,166
Careful, don't look down all the time.

442
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,166
-You'll fall.
-Hafiz!

443
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,875
Our new video got uploaded!

444
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,125
Check this out.

445
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:37,791
<i>I gained weight,</i>

446
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,916
<i>but my husband doesn't mind!</i>

447
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,750
-<i>To me, you're sexier.</i>
-Yes, nice.

448
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,208
You should read the comments too.

449
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:44,625
It's so much fun.

450
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:53,750
Salina, let's go.

451
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,333
Sure, I'll be right with you!

452
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,750
There you are.

453
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,875
"I really want to be like them…"

454
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,250
"How do I apply?"

455
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,166
"Oh, couple goals."

456
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,666
"Bless this perfect couple."

457
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,583
You're too funny…

458
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:26,375
-"Love this!"
-Stop it, Hafiz!

459
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,125
Oh, no. Is there a CCTV here?

460
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:35,625
You're so annoying!

461
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,458
You almost gave me a heart attack!

462
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:38,708
Na.

463
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:42,166
Stop being silly.

464
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:46,541
Ul, don't look too gloomy.

465
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,375
You have to own it, Ul!

466
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,833
Their concepts
are quite interesting after all.

467
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,833
Like this?

468
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,958
Tara's makeup turned out well.

469
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:57,125
You look very pretty, Ulfah.

470
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:03,291
Because it all depends
on the makeup artist!

471
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,166
You're really glowing.

472
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:09,750
All right, just like that!

473
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,250
Hold that pose,

474
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,875
remember the words, and action!

475
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:15,708
-Hi.
-Cut!

476
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:17,666
Hafiz!

477
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,958
Fiz, do you have an extra memory card?

478
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,750
-Mine is full.
-Ulfah, look.

479
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,833
That must be Salina's match.

480
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:24,750
But…

481
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,583
he looks weird.

482
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:36,541
How come your memory card is full?

483
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:38,708
I thought you had backups.

484
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:40,708
Error, I think.

485
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:42,750
Okay, Ulfah, stand by.

486
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:44,291
I've been standing by for ages.

487
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:50,083
Okay, now it's The Light's
male sports team's turn.

488
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:52,458
You boys need help with the makeup?

489
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,583
Tara, resist temptations!

490
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,000
Hi, I'm Ulfah.

491
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,541
I'm about to turn 17,

492
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,250
and I'm ready for my match!

493
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,000
There you are.

494
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,291
I've been looking for you.

495
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,875
I've been here waiting for you.

496
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:25,375
Sorry about earlier.

497
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:28,541
Ulfah and Tara
have a habit of making fun of me.

498
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,458
I don't mind.

499
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,958
You girls were cute teasing
and bullying each other.

500
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,458
I know right, they always make up stuff.

501
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,916
Oh, so that was made up?

502
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,875
What if…

503
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:50,666
it's true?

504
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,750
What do you mean?

505
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,458
You miss dating that much, huh?

506
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,833
-Hi, Fiz.
-Hey.

507
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,166
To be honest…

508
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,833
I'm 17…

509
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,083
and I have never dated anyone.

510
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:30,916
And I've always wanted
to know what it feels like.

511
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,208
Dating's not all that.

512
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:36,291
I've experienced it, and I don't miss it.

513
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:40,375
When's your birthday?

514
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,416
The day I got here.

515
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,458
I see.

516
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:48,583
Congrats.

517
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,083
That means you're going to marry soon.

518
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:58,291
Well, I'm just waiting.

519
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,875
There are lots of guys here

520
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:03,208
who are already 17 and still unmarried.

521
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:06,166
Maybe…

522
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:12,000
the algorithm hasn't found the match.

523
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:15,708
Fiz, this is forbidden.

524
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:23,125
But I'm so certain you're my match.

525
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,666
Why are you so sure?

526
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,750
I knew it…

527
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:33,958
since I saw you step down
from the bus to help that old lady.

528
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:38,833
I'm certain because
you appreciated my editing

529
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,708
so sincerely.

530
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,666
I know you come from a rich family

531
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,166
but you have empathy…

532
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,166
and ambition.

533
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,541
And you're not lazy
to actually put effort into things.

534
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:58,041
Don't you feel any kind of certainty…

535
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:00,250
that we're meant for each other?

536
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:05,875
I'm afraid to expect too much, Fiz.

537
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,708
I'M ON THE WAY
TO TAKE PHOTOS OF THE SUNRISE

538
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:32,458
I'M ALREADY HERE WAITING YOU

539
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:47,375
Let's set up here.

540
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:49,250
Sure.

541
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:57,041
Ever wonder what the people
in the city are doing?

542
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:00,500
It's absolutely better here.

543
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,708
You miss living in the city?

544
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:17,166
I only miss…

545
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,000
my parents.

546
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,666
When we're married…

547
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,291
and live in an apartment,

548
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:28,958
they will be so proud to see
I have a cool wife like you.

549
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:32,125
Your imagination's running too wild, Fiz.

550
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,916
Just enjoy what's in front of you.

551
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,375
It's you then.

552
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:48,666
Hopefully, your parents
will be proud of me too.

553
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:54,166
My late father would definitely be proud.

554
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:59,625
Once we live in the apartment,
we won't get this view anymore.

555
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:03,125
I'll be your view.

556
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:13,791
Bye!

557
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:17,166
Where have you been?
Did you bring the candles?

558
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,166
Of course, relax.

559
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,958
Can I have a taste?

560
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:30,458
ACCORDING TO YOUR CHOSEN FIELD

561
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:32,291
YOU WILL MANAGE THE LIGHT MART DESIGN
AFTER GETTING MARRIED

562
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:04,916
Make a wish first.

563
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:08,916
Okay.

564
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:13,833
-Yay!
-Hurray!

565
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:18,625
How's the bride-to-be?

566
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:19,541
Are you nervous?

567
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:23,250
I'm so happy this day has finally arrived.

568
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:25,708
By the way, look at this.

569
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:28,750
Ms. Nanik sent me this.

570
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,458
She said this is how my store
is going to look.

571
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,916
So how do you feel

572
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,875
about marrying someone you've never met?

573
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,666
I'm fine. I'm only worried
about the first night…

574
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,000
Will it hurt?

575
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,958
Just chill, Ulfah. Let it go.

576
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,500
Can we have one last sleepover?

577
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:55,125
This is my last night here.

578
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:57,041
Shoot, that's true.

579
00:36:57,125 --> 00:37:00,041
-Tar, do you dare?
-No.

580
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:03,958
I need to keep Sofia impressed.

581
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:07,416
Can't taint my record.

582
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,500
With our matchmaking system,

583
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:02,333
two fated souls shall meet today

584
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:05,833
in this beautiful and sacred place.

585
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:30,416
I thought he was going to be your match!

586
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,166
Ulfah and Hafiz.

587
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,333
Hafiz.

588
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:42,750
Do you accept Ulfah

589
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:46,541
whom we've chosen as your wife?

590
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,666
She's the best match for you, Hafiz.

591
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:01,875
I accept.

592
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:06,500
Ulfah, do you accept Hafiz

593
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:09,500
whom we've chosen to be your husband?

594
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:13,458
I accept.

595
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,875
-Our Extraordinary Leader.
-Please don't mind me.

596
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,791
Continue with what you're doing.

597
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:36,750
You've been chosen
as Joko Liauw's co-director…

598
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:41,208
for our special documentary project.

599
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:46,125
Wow, thank you so much

600
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:48,000
for this opportunity.

601
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,458
You're very welcome.

602
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,000
No need to be so tense.

603
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:01,791
You pushed yourself too hard.

604
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:04,208
You need to take care of yourself.

605
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:05,916
If I may know…

606
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,291
What's the documentary going to be about?

607
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:14,833
Me.

608
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:19,250
All right.

609
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:22,875
I shall not disappoint you.

610
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:29,916
Remember to rest.

611
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:41,875
FIZ! I HAVE BEEN CHOSEN…

612
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:55,500
I don't think my clothes

613
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,333
would fit into our small apartment.

614
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,125
Let's put them in the stock room here
until we get a bigger unit

615
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:03,500
once we have children.

616
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:07,708
Sure. I'll head upstairs.

617
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:11,250
Aren't you going to help me?

618
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:13,666
I'll help tomorrow morning.

619
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:16,958
When will your parents be here?

620
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:19,166
I want to get to know them.

621
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:22,250
That will have to wait.

622
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,833
Na. Oh, my god.

623
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:37,708
Ulfah's wedding video is dope!

624
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:39,875
-Here, look at it!
-I'm the one who made it.

625
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:44,375
I know, I mean, look how beautiful she is.

626
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:46,375
And Hafiz looked so good with his haircut,

627
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:48,833
even more dashing in a suit.

628
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:50,125
Yeah.

629
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:53,583
What do you mean?

630
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:56,833
Ulfah and Hafiz. They don't seem
to have anything in common.

631
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:58,333
Unlike you and him.

632
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:00,875
We're just co-workers.
Don't get the wrong idea, Tar.

633
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:03,916
-Chill. Don't get all defensive.
-Of course not.

634
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,041
Anyway, I have to focus on a new project.

635
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:10,375
A documentary about the life
of The Extraordinary Leader.

636
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:12,333
That's very cool!

637
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:14,833
Please find out about my match.

638
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:20,875
I've got to go. I need to pee.

639
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:22,208
NA, MY MARRIAGE
IS ONLY AN OBLIGATION.

640
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:23,500
YOU MUST KNOW MY LOVE IS ONLY FOR YOU.

641
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,541
The test results came out really good.

642
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:53,500
We can start the transfer
to the mother's uterus.

643
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,291
Are you ready to be filmed?

644
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:06,208
Okay, go ahead.

645
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,541
Are you ready, Sofia?

646
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:31,416
-Let's wait for Ali first.
-Sure.

647
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,916
Take the book with you.

648
00:44:42,791 --> 00:44:43,708
Keep it.

649
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:52,083
-Thank you, Extraordinary Leader.
-You're welcome.

650
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,750
Capture me and Sofia's moments well.

651
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,958
I want the audience to relate to us.

652
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:04,500
-Doc, please excuse…
-Hi.

653
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:05,625
-our documentation team.
-Go ahead.

654
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,750
Just relax. We'll begin
the procedure shortly.

655
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,083
Direct it to me, please.

656
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:17,833
Inhale. Control your breathing.

657
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:28,750
Control your breathing.

658
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:37,791
What a tragedy, to lose one's child.

659
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:40,833
But they are very strong together.

660
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:43,708
This is confidential stuff, Tara.

661
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:45,833
My responsibilities are huge
in this project.

662
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:46,958
Okay.

663
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,416
My, it's almost 8 p.m.

664
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,916
Relax,

665
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,791
they are still glam living

666
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:54,833
like a king and a queen…

667
00:45:58,666 --> 00:45:59,541
I'M BACK TO WORK SOON,

668
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:01,500
CAN'T WAIT TO BE WITH YOU
IN THE EDITING LAB. PLEASE REPLY, NA.

00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:03,416

672

eco-friendly fashion,

and beauty products.

675
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:26,791
And now, let me show you

676
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:28,875
The Light's Beauty Lab.

677
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:32,458
Now we have to study the product.

678
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:33,708
Let's start working!

679
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,083
<i>At The Light, we have many facilities.</i>

680
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:37,416
<i>This is one of them.</i>

681
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,375
Good morning, everyone.

682
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,416
Sorry to interrupt.

683
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,416
Sofia sends her regards.

684
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,541
Tara is here and I am sure
you will learn a lot from her.

685
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,583
<i>This is unusual
for our Extraordinary Leader</i>

686
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:59,416
<i>to stop by.</i>

687
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:02,708
Let's all take a selfie.

688
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:06,166
-Salina, please join us.
-It's okay.

689
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:07,708
-Come, Na.
-Don't just stand there.

690
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:09,541
Come here,

691
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:11,416
let's take a photo together.

692
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,125
Okay. Santi, you too.

693
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,875
Okay. Tighter, please.

694
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:21,500
One, two…

695
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:23,708
Three.

696
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,250
Hey.

697
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,708
Na?

698
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,750
Can I preview your cut?

699
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,000
<i>Just relax. We'll begin
the procedure shortly.</i>

700
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,125
<i>Direct it to me, please.</i>

701
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:03,041
-<i>Inhale…</i>
-There are no interviews yet.

702
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:05,041
But I'm certain it'll turn out great.

703
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:08,666
I didn't expect the editing
to turn out like this.

704
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:14,208
I'm taking a short break.

705
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:52,291
Wow, the decor's cute.

706
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:55,208
-Very Ulfah.
-I've missed you both!

707
00:48:57,666 --> 00:48:59,416
Hey, girl.

708
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:05,916
Have you done it? Awesome, right?

709
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:09,833
It hurts a bit at first.

710
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:12,333
But Hafiz was gentle

711
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,333
and he turned out to be so sweet.

712
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:19,791
Watch over him, please?
Since he's your co-worker.

713
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,291
What do you mean?

714
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:25,916
He keeps skipping lunch at work.

715
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,791
Please remind him to eat.

716
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:29,625
All right, I will.

717
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:32,916
By the way,
how is the documentary going so far?

718
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,750
It's cool to be able to work
on such an important project.

719
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,958
I've been tagging along
on all of his activities.

720
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:43,166
It's exhausting but very rewarding.

721
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:46,541
But

722
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,083
something felt off yesterday.

723
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:53,833
Really? What happened?

724
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,958
Ali caressed my cheeks.

725
00:49:57,541 --> 00:49:58,958
Was that captured by your camera, Na?

726
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:02,750
He was really handsy.

727
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:06,500
Oh, please.
Tar, he's just being attentive.

728
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:09,083
He's harmless. Don't overreact.

729
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:10,416
Let's just shoot.

730
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:12,416
Are you ready?

731
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,500
Smile, Ul.

732
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:21,833
<i>Chief Ali, Sofia,</i>

733
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:25,000
congratulations. You're finally expecting.

734
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:27,791
Thank you, Endru.

735
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:29,750
But please keep this to yourself.

736
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:32,458
This is still at a very early stage.

737
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:33,625
Noted, ma'am.

738
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:36,916
Okay. Good.

739
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:40,625
Who else are we going to send off

740
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:42,166
for marriage this time?

741
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,750
Please start, Ms. Nanik.

742
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,791
Diana and Doni.

743
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:47,666
Diana's skills include sewing

744
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:51,291
and making patterns, but she can't draw,

745
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:55,041
while Doni is a great illustrator.

746
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,500
I think they are compatible.

747
00:50:57,583 --> 00:51:00,583
-They're going to be a productive couple.
-Agreed.

748
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:02,583
Who's next?

749
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:05,333
Tara's supposed to be next,

750
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:07,875
but it's hard to find a match for her.

751
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:12,375
She's influential, with lots of followers.

752
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:14,625
Tara is too progressive
for someone her age,

753
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:19,083
She even made a digital marketing plan
for Sofia's makeup line.

754
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:22,250
I can't picture any boys here
to be her match.

755
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:24,625
Endru?

756
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,375
Ever think of taking a second wife?

757
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:30,958
No, not for me, sir.

758
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:33,500
Don't you want to have more children?

759
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:35,875
-Tara can…
-Al.

760
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:39,458
Endru's wife is battling cancer,
don't you remember?

761
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:43,583
Oh, sorry, I forgot.

762
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:44,500
Dru.

763
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:47,083
It's okay, chief.

764
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:49,750
How about we focus on Diana first?

765
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:52,208
Tara can wait.

766
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:59,250
What did you shoot today?

767
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,916
The next wedding plan.

768
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,791
My batch! So?

769
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:07,458
I felt uncomfortable.

770
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:09,916
I didn't expect

771
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,583
Ali to talk about polygamy so casually.

772
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:14,666
You mean

773
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,833
we'll be matched
to an already married guy?

774
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:19,958
Shit.

775
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:22,625
Where's the file?

776
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:24,791
I already submitted it
to the editing room.

777
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,333
I don't feel good about this.

778
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:29,750
That's why you always have to keep a copy.

779
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:31,250
Go rogue a bit, Na!

780
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:33,416
I know.

781
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:49,875
<i>Na, I understand
you want to keep your space.</i>

782
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,166
<i>Hopefully, we can stay friends.</i>

783
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,333
<i>That's enough for me.</i>

784
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:55,666
<i>I want to remind you</i>

785
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,583
<i>to always delete
all of our chats and emails.</i>

786
00:52:58,666 --> 00:52:59,708
<i>Thank you.</i>

787
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:03,166
DON'T WORRY, I ALWAYS DELETE ALL.
WE'RE WRONG FOR HOPING TOO MUCH.

788
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,708
PLEASE TAKE CARE OF ULFAH.
SHE'S THE BEST. STOP TEXTING ME.

789
00:53:06,791 --> 00:53:08,458
I WILL EDIT MY FILM MYSELF.

790
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:12,583
It always feels like paradise here.

791
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:15,708
It's been a while since my last visit.

792
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:17,250
Yes, it has, sir.

793
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:20,791
I've been too busy with my constituents.

794
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:24,916
Of course, sir,
I understand that you're busy.

795
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,833
If you ever feel tired,

796
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:32,166
or in need of a change of scenery,

797
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,083
this place is always open for you, sir.

798
00:53:34,166 --> 00:53:35,958
Thank you.

799
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:38,375
Without you, Mr. Frans,

800
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:41,333
none of this would have prospered.

801
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:44,500
When many were skeptical…

802
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:48,541
you, sir, were the first one to invest.

803
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:53,708
Ali.

804
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:56,208
Now it's my turn

805
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:58,791
to ask you for a favor.

806
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,833
Please find a wife for my son, Aditya.

807
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:07,833
He's already 25

808
00:54:07,916 --> 00:54:11,458
and he should marry soon.

809
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:13,833
I might just have
the perfect solution for you, sir.

810
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:24,083
Tara.

811
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,083
Wake up, Tara.

812
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:27,916
Go take a shower.

813
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:34,166
It's not even 5 a.m. yet.

814
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,833
Today you'll have breakfast
with The Extraordinary,

815
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:41,125
Sofia, and your future husband.

816
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,750
Since when do we have
this breakfast thing?

817
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:53,666
Since we found you a match.

818
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,416
What is she talking about?

819
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,750
Na!

820
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:10,250
Maybe he's not a member of The Light.

821
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:13,833
My bad karma is haunting me,

822
00:55:13,916 --> 00:55:15,291
even now that I'm here.

823
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:18,458
What repentance must I make now?

824
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:21,500
Don't be a drama queen.

825
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:23,375
Just meet him first.

826
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,833
Okay?

827
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:36,333
We'll leave you guys to it,

828
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:40,583
so you can get to know each other better.

829
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:45,291
Tara, Aditya,

830
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:48,000
you will become an exceptional couple.

831
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,083
Thank you.

832
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:00,958
HOW IS IT?

833
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:04,416
FINALLY, A GOOD KARMA. MY FUTURE HUSBAND
IS HANDSOME LIKE A MOVIE STAR.

834
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,250
-So, Tara.
-Yeah?

835
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:11,333
So happy to see both of them.

836
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,375
I'll make Tara the spokesmodel
for my makeup line.

837
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:18,875
Mr. Frans will have stronger ties to us.

838
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,958
Your gut is never wrong, Sof.

839
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:22,458
-Of course.
-Watch out.

840
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,416
I want you to slow down.

841
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,916
Don't work too much.

842
00:56:30,416 --> 00:56:31,666
Tara will do all the work

843
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,041
UL, FINALLY SOF AND ALI
GOT THE BEST MATCH FOR ME

844
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:38,583
I MISS YOU, UL. READ THIS!
HOPE YOU ARE HAPPY FOR ME.

845
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:44,000
RICH, YOUNG, HANDSOME ENTREPRENEUR
ADITYA FRANS PROFILE BY JAFAR KURSIDIN

846
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:50,791
Hey.

847
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:55,583
Hey. How's work today?

848
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,166
The usual.

849
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:13,791
Don't you want to know how my day went?

850
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:18,208
Oh, yeah. How was it?

851
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:22,458
I was sick all day.

852
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:25,333
And I can't stand your smell.

853
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,541
Go take a shower after this.

854
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:34,750
Are you that hungry?

855
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:36,500
Poor thing.

856
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:53,958
Thank you.

857
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:56,166
Tara's perfect for Aditya.

858
00:57:57,791 --> 00:57:59,166
Here.

859
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,583
A little something as a form
of my appreciation.

860
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:06,166
Mr. Frans, please.

861
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:10,375
There's absolutely no need for this.
We're just returning the favor to you.

862
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:12,416
Ali, no matter what,

863
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,083
cash is important.

864
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:15,916
Think of a car.

865
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,583
And that car is your ambition.

866
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:20,000
But it doesn't have fuel.

867
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,041
Can the car go without fuel?

868
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,750
This cash is just that.

869
00:58:26,541 --> 00:58:28,541
-Mr. Frans…
-We will not disappoint, sir.

870
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:30,750
Great. Let's greet our guests.

871
00:58:30,833 --> 00:58:33,583
Sofia! What the hell is Salina doing here?

872
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:37,041
Now!

873
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:41,041
Salina.

874
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:46,250
Yes?

875
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:48,541
Delete the footage you shot just now.

876
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:51,375
Why, is something wrong?

877
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:52,458
Delete it now.

878
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:55,500
You should only focus
on Tara and Aditya today.

879
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:56,458
Not us!

880
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:59,166
Yes, ma'am.

881
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,416
Na?

882
00:59:32,625 --> 00:59:34,125
Ulfah?

883
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:36,125
Looking gorgeous!

884
00:59:38,916 --> 00:59:40,500
Let's congratulate Tara.

885
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:46,916
It turns out that married life
is not as easy as it seems.

886
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,583
I shouldn't be saying this.

887
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:54,500
But I don't think Hafiz is for me.

888
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:01,125
It's probably because
you're just getting to know each other.

889
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:03,541
It takes time.

890
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:07,166
You're probably right.
I shouldn't complain.

891
01:00:08,416 --> 01:00:10,250
Actually, I have great news
to share with you.

892
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:12,750
Oh, what is it?

893
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:14,750
I'll tell you when we're with Tara.

894
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,666
Look at her. Isn't she the luckiest?

895
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:22,666
I mean, look at him!
Aditya is so handsome!

896
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:28,041
His father is The Light's main donor,

897
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,541
a powerful businessman,

898
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:32,583
and a politician.

899
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,833
Congrats, newlyweds!

900
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:41,750
You look stunning!

901
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:45,750
Finally, dreams do come true!

902
01:00:46,458 --> 01:00:47,916
For me too.

903
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,291
I'm pregnant!

904
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:51,875
Oh. my god, Ul,

905
01:00:51,958 --> 01:00:53,875
this is my wedding day

906
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:56,125
and you're stealing my thunder!

907
01:00:58,333 --> 01:01:01,416
Congratulations, you two!

908
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:05,125
Adit?

909
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,791
-Adit?
-We'll be on our way then.

910
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:12,416
These are my childhood best friends.

911
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,125
-Ulfah and Salina.
-Thank you for coming.

912
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:16,708
Congrats.

913
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:20,250
-We'd better head on.
-Don't go home just yet!

914
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:22,833
-Bye.
-Congratulations!

915
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:27,166
-Ul. Are you done?
-Yes.

916
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:29,333
What took you so long?

917
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:30,875
-Sorry.
-All right then

918
01:01:30,958 --> 01:01:33,875
-There was a long queue over there.
-Na, where are you going?

919
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,666
I have to continue working.

920
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:39,458
-You go ahead.
-All right.

921
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:06,708
NA, I JUST REALIZED I'LL BECOME
A DAD SOON. ULFAH'S BELLY IS GETTING BIG.

922
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:13,791
I MISS EDITING WITH YOU,
HOPE YOU GET THE BEST MATCH.

923
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:23,833
-I'm hungry.
-She always counts calories.

924
01:02:44,583 --> 01:02:45,958
Here's your clip-on mic.

925
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:51,333
Can you put it on?

926
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:02,958
Okay.

927
01:03:05,791 --> 01:03:07,250
Where should we start?

928
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,750
First question.

929
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,416
Can you…

930
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,666
Sorry.

931
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,958
-Kids my age think…
-Salina.

932
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:29,708
Right.

933
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,375
Are you ready?

934
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:36,666
I think…

935
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:40,125
my generation

936
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:43,750
would be more interested in the love story

937
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:45,208
of Your Extraordinary and Sofia.

938
01:03:46,625 --> 01:03:48,250
There's no love story.

939
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:52,708
Our love starts right after marriage.

940
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:57,500
So when did Your Extraordinary
realize that Sofia was the one?

941
01:03:58,375 --> 01:03:59,458
<i>When I first presented</i>

942
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:02,541
<i>the matchmaking system that I developed</i>

943
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:05,166
<i>to fellow student activists.</i>

944
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,291
They all laughed at the idea.

945
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:10,375
<i>But not Sofia.</i>

946
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:22,541
Next question.

947
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:26,250
Sorry.

948
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:30,166
Can we talk about
the funding of The Light?

949
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:31,750
<i>Funding?</i>

950
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,000
<i>Salina.</i>

951
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,666
Instead of funding,

952
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:44,041
why don't we talk about
the humanistic side of things?

953
01:04:44,916 --> 01:04:48,291
Such as the traumas we experienced.

954
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,375
Sure.

955
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:56,166
The reason that I believe everyone
should have a match,

956
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,541
<i>and that no one should postpone</i>

957
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:02,125
<i>or refuse the arrival
of children in their lives.</i>

958
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,583
<i>It's because of Rama,</i>

959
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,541
<i>our firstborn.</i>

960
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:11,750
<i>City life after the pandemic,</i>

961
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:14,791
plastic pollution,

962
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,625
illnesses, those were the forces
that killed Rama.

963
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,125
Meanwhile, the world completely neglected

964
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:23,500
the rights for babies to live.

965
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:26,416
That urged me to take action.

966
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:30,875
I understand how you feel.

967
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:33,791
Those who had suffered loss
would understand.

968
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:35,791
Sofia!

969
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:38,708
Sof!

970
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:41,375
-I'm bleeding, Al.
-It's okay.

971
01:05:42,083 --> 01:05:43,375
-Let's go to the hospital now.
-No.

972
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:45,333
-Sofia.
-I don't have the energy, Al.

973
01:05:45,416 --> 01:05:46,625
I called our doctor already.

974
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:51,083
Excuse me,

975
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:52,833
can I be of any help?

976
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,375
Salina!

977
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:01,583
Sorry.

978
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,208
We need privacy.

979
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:15,291
Al, it's time for you to take my advice.

980
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:18,083
Our legacy can't end here.

981
01:06:18,166 --> 01:06:21,875
Sofia, please don't.
Don't think about that now.

982
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:24,500
-You…
-You need to recover!

983
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:26,666
-But you have to…
-Sofia.

984
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,875
-Madam Sofia.
-Please, Doctor.

985
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,250
-Doc, my wife.
-Al!

986
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:36,583
<i>I have to choose for you, Al.</i>

987
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:43,875
Salina,

988
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,208
are you asleep?

989
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:51,083
It's not even 8 p.m.

990
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:53,250
Yes, ma'am.

991
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:55,375
I feel so tired today.

992
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:01,166
I know

993
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,208
you've witnessed the tragedy

994
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:08,083
befalling His Extraordinary and Sofia.

995
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,083
We're all mourning.

996
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:17,875
I'm always here for you.

997
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:21,541
Especially since
your best friends are both married

998
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:23,500
and are no longer here.

999
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:26,500
You can tell me.

1000
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:33,750
I just miss everyone so much.

1001
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,041
I miss Ulfah,

1002
01:07:37,666 --> 01:07:38,916
Tara…

1003
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:44,250
and I also feel sorry for Sofia.

1004
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:48,041
I know. What a pity.

1005
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:52,958
But as a filmmaker,

1006
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:56,791
you have to be strong
and ready to face anything

1007
01:07:56,875 --> 01:07:59,208
that befalls your subject.

1008
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:03,500
I have to be strong.

1009
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:11,833
The Extraordinary Leader
is so proud of you.

1010
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:15,708
So is Mr. Joko.

1011
01:08:16,207 --> 01:08:19,375
You are our pride.

1012
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:42,457
Hello, darling.

1013
01:08:42,541 --> 01:08:43,791
Hey.

1014
01:08:45,207 --> 01:08:46,041
Darling.

1015
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:48,750
This is the new ad for Sofia Makeup.

1016
01:08:48,832 --> 01:08:51,332
It will be uploaded tomorrow,
do you like it?

1017
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,082
It looks great.

1018
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:09,500
Darling, please.

1019
01:09:09,582 --> 01:09:10,707
What is it, Tar?

1020
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:13,082
Aren't we shooting for The Light tomorrow?

1021
01:09:13,166 --> 01:09:14,832
We have to sleep.

1022
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:20,707
But, your mom keeps reminding me

1023
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:22,791
to get pregnant soon.

1024
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:25,291
Don't worry about Mom,
it's typical of her.

1025
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,207
Relax.

1026
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:36,832
Sofia.

1027
01:09:38,082 --> 01:09:39,250
I hope you're feeling better.

1028
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:41,582
I'm fine.

1029
01:09:43,332 --> 01:09:45,832
Let's not talk about my miscarriage.

1030
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:50,375
You have to continue working
on the documentary, my dear.

1031
01:09:50,457 --> 01:09:54,625
Now please make
a good video for Tara. Understood?

1032
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:58,041
Welcome, newlyweds!

1033
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:03,000
-So sweet!
-So sweet!

1034
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:05,333
-So sweet!
-So sweet!

1035
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:06,750
So sweet!

1036
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:14,708
<i>I'm honored to be able to work here</i>

1037
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:16,791
<i>in Sofia Makeup.</i>

1038
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:21,500
And also to have
a very supportive husband.

1039
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:25,916
<i>I'm delighted to accompany Tara
on her first day back at work as my wife.</i>

1040
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:32,958
<i>Every dedication</i>

1041
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:36,666
<i>and the hard work we put in,
they will all pay off.</i>

1042
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:41,708
SALINA, EXTRAORDINARY LEADER AND I
NEED TO MEET YOU. NOW.

1043
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,958
What position do you prefer this time?

1044
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:07,583
Wait. Hold on a second.

1045
01:11:08,666 --> 01:11:10,458
Hold on a second, Tar.

1046
01:11:10,958 --> 01:11:11,791
-Who are you?
-Evening, boss.

1047
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:12,708
Leo.

1048
01:11:12,791 --> 01:11:13,916
-Shall I make it quick?
-Adit…

1049
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,166
Don't be scared,
I'll be watching over you.

1050
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:40,041
Take it easy.

1051
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:41,791
Easy, Tar.

1052
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,333
Are you crazy?

1053
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:52,250
Leo!

1054
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,875
He's not moving…

1055
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:58,125
Go to hell!

1056
01:11:58,208 --> 01:12:00,250
Tar, don't!

1057
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:22,041
Good evening.

1058
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:23,458
Hi, Salina.

1059
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:26,958
We're not shooting today.

1060
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:29,125
Oh, I see.

1061
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:31,791
Okay then.

1062
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:38,708
You look like a mess.

1063
01:12:40,666 --> 01:12:44,875
Sorry, all I had
on my schedule today was editing.

1064
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:51,958
You'll be turning 17 soon, right?

1065
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,083
Yes, ma'am.

1066
01:12:56,791 --> 01:13:00,583
And you are the only member

1067
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:03,666
that I ever summoned…

1068
01:13:09,208 --> 01:13:10,583
before your birthday.

1069
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:12,166
Yes,

1070
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:14,291
only you.

1071
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:17,750
Did I do something wrong?

1072
01:13:45,791 --> 01:13:46,625
Salina?

1073
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:50,750
Salina?

1074
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:53,625
<i>Because there will come a time</i>

1075
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:57,166
<i>where all of you here will be married
to your perfect match.</i>

1076
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:02,625
<i>Our baby hid</i>

1077
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:05,041
<i>from the sonogram.</i>

1078
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:08,208
<i>-Right, Fiz?
-Probably shy just like the dad.</i>

1079
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:11,000
<i>I'm strong enough to not
be poisoned by romance.</i>

1080
01:14:11,083 --> 01:14:12,791
<i>My husband and I</i>

1081
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:14,916
<i>accept each other as who we are.</i>

1082
01:14:15,916 --> 01:14:19,083
<i>Rest assured
that each of your future spouses</i>

1083
01:14:19,166 --> 01:14:21,750
<i>are here in the training center.</i>

1084
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:25,083
Tara.

1085
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:47,458
ARYA TEJA, YEAR 2028

1086
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:52,625
OUR SON NEVER CAME BACK FROM TL

1087
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:54,250
"Our son joined The Light

1088
01:14:54,333 --> 01:14:56,375
without our consent."

1089
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:59,958
"His name is Arya Teja,
missing since 2028."

1090
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:05,166
"We cannot contact him ever since."

1091
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:15,666
THOSE WHO SUCCESSFULLY ESCAPED FROM TL

1092
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:20,041
"I survived escaping The Light."

1093
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:23,333
"But one of my friends is still inside,

1094
01:15:23,416 --> 01:15:27,750
with no news of where they are
and how they are doing."

1095
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:39,750
I understand. Thanks, Doctor.

1096
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:42,541
Na. What's up, Na?

1097
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:45,750
Tara. I want to escape The Light.

1098
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,083
<i>But we must do it together.</i>

1099
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:49,916
<i>Na…</i>

1100
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:52,916
-<i>I…</i>
-I sent you a few articles.

1101
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,333
Check your email.

1102
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:55,916
<i>Tomorrow before 12,</i>

1103
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,375
<i>meet me at Ulfah's Light Mart
with your car, okay?</i>

1104
01:15:58,958 --> 01:16:01,916
-Okay.
-I'll handle the payment. Surely.

1105
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:05,958
Tar, all has been taken care of.

1106
01:16:33,958 --> 01:16:36,208
<i>Stay tuned for more!</i>

1107
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,333
Tara!

1108
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:03,750
You left this,

1109
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:06,083
you won't be able to get in without it.

1110
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:09,541
It doesn't matter.

1111
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,541
People already know I'm your wife.

1112
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:13,125
They'll let me in no matter what.

1113
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:17,416
Tara, are we cool?

1114
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:20,791
Don't worry about it.

1115
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:22,875
Just forget it.

1116
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:36,250
Na, why didn't you tell me
you're visiting?

1117
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:39,041
I sent you a link.
You must be ignoring your emails.

1118
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:40,208
Here.

1119
01:17:40,791 --> 01:17:42,166
What do you mean?

1120
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:46,833
Ul, you know that my birthday
is approaching, right?

1121
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:48,416
Yes, I've been praying
for you to find the best match.

1122
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:50,500
Sofia and Ali…

1123
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:53,666
They want me to…

1124
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,250
to be his second wife.

1125
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:02,000
-The fuck?
-Isn't that insane?

1126
01:18:03,791 --> 01:18:06,833
Ul, I have to get out of The Light.

1127
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:08,416
Calm down, Na.

1128
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:11,208
But you have to come with me!

1129
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:13,000
Read the emails I sent you.

1130
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:17,208
It's about an ex-member
who successfully escaped.

1131
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:19,708
But it endangered their friends
who were still inside.

1132
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:21,958
I don't want to leave by myself

1133
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:23,958
and put you and Tara at risk.

1134
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:26,083
Endangered? At risk?

1135
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:28,750
Yes, Ul.

1136
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:30,291
I feel so dizzy.

1137
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:33,833
Fiz, where's my juice

1138
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:35,333
and vitamins?

1139
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,541
At the back, Ul.

1140
01:18:38,416 --> 01:18:40,166
Na, sorry. I'll be back.

1141
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:50,416
What was that? They're going to
make you his second wife?

1142
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:53,666
Motherfuckers!

1143
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:56,125
I'll kill that bastard!
This is unacceptable!

1144
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:58,791
Hafiz, calm down!

1145
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:00,750
You can help

1146
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:03,541
by editing our own version
of the documentary, okay?

1147
01:19:04,333 --> 01:19:08,791
-Forget about that!
-We're leaving all of this together, okay?

1148
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,291
Calm down.

1149
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:14,875
We're leaving all of this together, okay?

1150
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:17,375
I will leave with you.

1151
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:19,666
Wait…

1152
01:19:21,916 --> 01:19:23,125
What…

1153
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:25,500
What is this?

1154
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:29,250
-Ul, I can explain.
-Ulfah,

1155
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:30,916
Salina and I love each other.

1156
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:33,000
-What the fuck, Fiz? Shut up!
-Na?

1157
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:35,625
I can explain, that was long
before you two were matched.

1158
01:19:35,708 --> 01:19:37,583
It's over now, there's nothing

1159
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:40,083
-going on with us.
-Ulfah, you're a nice person, but…

1160
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:41,458
-Shut up! Stop it, Fiz!
-I don't feel the same way about you.

1161
01:19:42,833 --> 01:19:45,375
-Ulfah, please trust me.
-Listen to me.

1162
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:46,583
-Leave me alone!
-It's over!

1163
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:48,166
-Leave me alone!
-It was way before you were married.

1164
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,916
You're a good person
but you need to know, Ulfah.

1165
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,333
Leave me alone!

1166
01:19:51,416 --> 01:19:53,750
Get the fuck out of here!

1167
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:55,291
Get out!

1168
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:56,875
Get out!

1169
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,541
Ul, I'm so sorry, please hear me out!

1170
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:06,583
I know, but we really have to leave!

1171
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,583
Ul!

1172
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,333
<i>Salina, please take a break from work.</i>

1173
01:20:18,416 --> 01:20:21,125
<i>I want to have brunch with you
in the gazebo. Tara is here too.</i>

1174
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:22,041
<i>I'm waiting!</i>

1175
01:20:43,416 --> 01:20:44,625
Is that all?

1176
01:20:45,791 --> 01:20:47,458
That's it?

1177
01:20:56,958 --> 01:21:00,166
It is your duty to serve your husband.

1178
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:03,666
I never imagine…

1179
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:08,416
to be a good wife
includes permitting that.

1180
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:11,500
Your husband is Aditya.

1181
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:17,125
You are aware of that, right?

1182
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:20,541
But this counts as
domestic violence, right?

1183
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,750
Don't rant about
your husband's flaws to other people.

1184
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:26,500
But you are not just some other people.

1185
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:28,208
Please hear me out.

1186
01:21:28,875 --> 01:21:32,416
I don't want it to happen again.

1187
01:21:34,833 --> 01:21:36,666
As women,

1188
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,500
we have to benefit

1189
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,958
from the power of our men.

1190
01:21:41,041 --> 01:21:44,333
So just make up with your husband, okay?

1191
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,916
I'm even traumatized by our own bed.

1192
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:51,875
I need to file a report.

1193
01:21:52,916 --> 01:21:55,208
You think they'll believe you?

1194
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,083
Tara.

1195
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:03,458
You should be grateful.

1196
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:06,166
We couldn't find a match for you here.

1197
01:22:07,416 --> 01:22:08,541
But Aditya

1198
01:22:09,541 --> 01:22:13,833
was willing to accept you
despite your wild dating records.

1199
01:22:15,916 --> 01:22:16,958
Fuck you!

1200
01:22:20,541 --> 01:22:21,583
Okay.

1201
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:25,375
Guess I'll have to learn more
about gratitude.

1202
01:22:28,916 --> 01:22:32,916
Think of this as a process.

1203
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:35,458
Where you can atone

1204
01:22:35,541 --> 01:22:37,250
for your past sins.

1205
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:39,458
Okay?

1206
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:53,625
NA, HURRY UP!
I'VE BEEN WITH SOF, I LOST MY MIND…

1207
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:55,291
PLEASE WAIT…

1208
01:23:01,833 --> 01:23:04,083
I'LL JUST SMACK THIS DRIVER,
AND WE CAN ESCAPE

1209
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:16,750
Na?

1210
01:23:31,125 --> 01:23:33,791
-Stay put.
-What's this?

1211
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,291
Come with us.

1212
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:38,916
-Why?
-Take him.

1213
01:23:40,208 --> 01:23:41,333
Salina?

1214
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:43,166
Scoot, Tara.

1215
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:45,083
-Hello.
-Tara's been waiting.

1216
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:46,250
Let's all eat together.

1217
01:23:47,083 --> 01:23:49,000
-Just stick to our plan, Tar.
-How's Ulfah?

1218
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:51,750
She must be so happy having a baby.

1219
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:54,166
You didn't tell her anything yet, right?

1220
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:57,708
Ulfah is well and healthy,

1221
01:23:57,791 --> 01:23:59,416
always so energetic.

1222
01:24:00,083 --> 01:24:02,666
So who's going to break the news?

1223
01:24:03,958 --> 01:24:05,291
The mic's yours, Sofia.

1224
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:09,500
So…

1225
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:13,541
This is the rundown for Salina

1226
01:24:13,625 --> 01:24:15,041
and Ali's wedding.

1227
01:24:17,041 --> 01:24:19,541
You'll walk onto the altar.

1228
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:21,833
The screen of our matchmaking system

1229
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:24,041
<i>will do the usual shuffling.</i>

1230
01:24:27,083 --> 01:24:28,875
The Extraordinary Leader's photo
will pop up next to you

1231
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:31,000
and the crowd will be amazed

1232
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:32,791
So the system can be manipulated?

1233
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:35,833
Of course, you know that
it is just for show, right?

1234
01:24:35,916 --> 01:24:38,708
I can tinker with the matchmaking
system according to my will.

1235
01:24:45,416 --> 01:24:46,375
What is it, Endru?

1236
01:24:49,166 --> 01:24:50,875
An emergency has occurred, ma'am.

1237
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:52,416
Regarding what?

1238
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,083
About Ulfah.

1239
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,916
Salina was just at her place
and she's fine.

1240
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,625
She has evidence that
her husband has been unfaithful.

1241
01:25:02,666 --> 01:25:04,625
For God's sake.

1242
01:25:06,958 --> 01:25:08,458
Tara.

1243
01:25:08,541 --> 01:25:12,083
Go ahead and give
the most special treatment for Salina.

1244
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:14,125
Let me handle this first.

1245
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,291
Salina,

1246
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,125
dinner tonight at ours, okay?

1247
01:25:23,958 --> 01:25:25,500
What the hell?

1248
01:25:26,916 --> 01:25:28,875
-Stupid boy!
-Have mercy, please!

1249
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:30,500
Please have mercy on me.

1250
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:33,583
Please…

1251
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:38,250
He finally confessed, ma'am.

1252
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:39,833
The letters…

1253
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,666
were from before his marriage.

1254
01:25:42,375 --> 01:25:44,416
In accordance with our protocols,

1255
01:25:45,083 --> 01:25:46,500
we have to investigate further.

1256
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:48,875
And make sure that this does not
involve another member of The Light.

1257
01:25:49,458 --> 01:25:50,708
Yes, ma'am.

1258
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:55,000
Ma'am, his wife's here.

1259
01:25:56,041 --> 01:25:56,875
Sofia.

1260
01:26:00,166 --> 01:26:02,375
You have to protect
your health and your baby.

1261
01:26:02,458 --> 01:26:03,458
That is what matters most.

1262
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:08,208
Maybe this is just me being hormonal.

1263
01:26:08,833 --> 01:26:10,416
-So I overreacted.
-Okay.

1264
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,416
I fully understand.

1265
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:20,250
Is it possible to revoke the charges?

1266
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,833
The two of you need to have
a heart-to-heart talk first.

1267
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,375
You stay here, watch over her.

1268
01:26:34,333 --> 01:26:36,333
What have I done?

1269
01:26:41,041 --> 01:26:44,541
I should be running away
and yet I have to do this shit!

1270
01:26:47,125 --> 01:26:49,750
Don't!

1271
01:26:49,833 --> 01:26:51,416
Where did you keep the footage?

1272
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,083
In that bag.

1273
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:59,583
My goodness, you should never
smuggle it all in one bag. It's risky.

1274
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,125
Here.

1275
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:09,208
Go sneak into the basement first.

1276
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:10,666
Here's my car key. At B2.

1277
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:12,416
I'll catch up with you.

1278
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:14,625
Ulfah.

1279
01:27:14,708 --> 01:27:17,166
-How about Ulfah?
-We'll go to her apartment.

1280
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:20,000
No alarms in The Light Daily

1281
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:22,000
about you and Hafiz or the affair.

1282
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,333
-Tara.
-Yes, Ms. Nanik?

1283
01:27:26,416 --> 01:27:29,083
Why don't you put on
a hair mask for Salina as well?

1284
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:32,541
Wow, it's full-service today!

1285
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:39,458
I can call in new members to help.

1286
01:27:39,541 --> 01:27:42,041
It's okay, I can handle this.

1287
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:48,666
Ma'am.

1288
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:53,583
Where are you taking those?

1289
01:27:53,666 --> 01:27:54,916
To class.

1290
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,958
But they're face powders, ma'am.

1291
01:27:57,041 --> 01:27:59,000
We're only doing skincare today.

1292
01:27:59,083 --> 01:28:01,750
The class demo will be
using these cleansers…

1293
01:28:01,833 --> 01:28:04,250
My goodness, I really am getting old.

1294
01:28:04,833 --> 01:28:06,083
Thank you, love.

1295
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:13,125
Please forgive me, Ulfah.

1296
01:28:23,083 --> 01:28:24,416
Ulfah.

1297
01:28:26,166 --> 01:28:27,666
The moment we were married,

1298
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:31,541
I tried with all my might to be faithful.

1299
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,416
Yet, I made the situation worse.

1300
01:28:39,125 --> 01:28:40,083
Ulfah.

1301
01:28:42,875 --> 01:28:43,708
Ulfah.

1302
01:28:44,791 --> 01:28:46,083
I'm powerless.

1303
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:51,166
But there might still be a way
for you three to get out of here.

1304
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:56,333
Hafiz,

1305
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,125
no one deserves to be locked up

1306
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:02,916
in a place like this

1307
01:29:03,583 --> 01:29:05,208
just for falling in love.

1308
01:29:15,208 --> 01:29:16,041
Tar.

1309
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:18,125
Ul?

1310
01:29:18,208 --> 01:29:20,916
I got mad and didn't know what else to do.

1311
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:25,250
But I just revoked
the charges against Hafiz.

1312
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:28,583
Ul.

1313
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:31,750
Once again, I'm truly sorry.

1314
01:29:33,833 --> 01:29:35,791
But we have to leave all this behind.

1315
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:38,458
Together.

1316
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:43,666
I prefer to raise my child alone

1317
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:46,750
instead of staying with a husband
who's in love with someone else.

1318
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:50,041
You're not alone,

1319
01:29:50,666 --> 01:29:52,291
you have us.

1320
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:55,125
But I don't want you to leave
your perfect life with Aditya,

1321
01:29:55,208 --> 01:29:57,250
just because of us.

1322
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:00,583
You don't need to worry, Tara.

1323
01:30:00,666 --> 01:30:03,000
Just drop us off in the city.

1324
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:06,333
No.

1325
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:09,208
I want out too.

1326
01:30:11,666 --> 01:30:14,000
To hell with Aditya,

1327
01:30:14,083 --> 01:30:16,208
to hell with The Light.

1328
01:30:32,416 --> 01:30:34,000
What a waste of time,

1329
01:30:34,083 --> 01:30:36,000
handling some jealous brat.

1330
01:30:37,458 --> 01:30:39,208
Ulfah is pregnant,

1331
01:30:39,291 --> 01:30:41,375
so she's just being hormonal.

1332
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,166
We must focus on my wedding ceremony.

1333
01:30:50,666 --> 01:30:52,083
Is the rundown still the same?

1334
01:30:52,166 --> 01:30:53,000
Yes.

1335
01:30:57,166 --> 01:30:59,083
I think that

1336
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:01,541
Endru should be the one officiating.

1337
01:31:07,041 --> 01:31:08,541
Sounds good.

1338
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:36,875
Salina?

1339
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,000
Done with the treatment?

1340
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:42,166
Oh, not yet.

1341
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:43,875
I just need to use the toilet.

1342
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:51,041
To the apartment, please.

1343
01:32:59,416 --> 01:33:00,333
Ma'am.

1344
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:12,208
Is dinner with Salina still on?

1345
01:33:12,291 --> 01:33:13,625
Of course.

1346
01:33:14,625 --> 01:33:15,666
I texted her.

1347
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:18,333
Ask Ms. Nanik to fetch her.

1348
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:22,791
<i>Stay put until we reach the highway.</i>

1349
01:33:22,875 --> 01:33:26,333
Tara, please slow down.

1350
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:28,791
The road's too bumpy, my tummy hurts.

1351
01:33:30,083 --> 01:33:33,208
Okay, I'll slow down.

1352
01:33:43,708 --> 01:33:46,291
I'm sorry, girls. I can't bear it anymore.

1353
01:33:46,958 --> 01:33:48,291
My tummy hurts so much.

1354
01:33:48,375 --> 01:33:50,458
Try the breathing exercises.

1355
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:52,208
Do you remember it?

1356
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:03,541
-What was that?
-Are you okay, Ul?

1357
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:05,791
I think I peed my pants

1358
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:07,083
I'm so sorry, ma'am!

1359
01:34:07,166 --> 01:34:08,250
Are you okay, ma'am?

1360
01:34:08,333 --> 01:34:10,291
-Wow, it's you again?
-We're so sorry, ma'am!

1361
01:34:10,875 --> 01:34:12,250
Na! Ulfah's peed her pants.

1362
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:13,458
What?

1363
01:34:13,541 --> 01:34:14,916
It's not pee…

1364
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,166
Remember what we learned in class?
Our water breaks before birth?

1365
01:34:19,875 --> 01:34:21,625
How far along are you, child?

1366
01:34:21,708 --> 01:34:24,333
She's seven months pregnant.

1367
01:34:24,416 --> 01:34:25,583
Seven months, ma'am.

1368
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:28,166
Oh, a baby born

1369
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:30,250
during the 7th month of pregnancy

1370
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:32,208
brings a prophecy.

1371
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:34,083
What's she talking about?

1372
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:37,208
Follow me, we must help her.

1373
01:34:37,291 --> 01:34:38,958
Come with me.

1374
01:34:39,041 --> 01:34:40,916
I can't hold it in anymore.

1375
01:34:59,791 --> 01:35:01,916
Ulfah?

1376
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:15,666
Inhale, Ul.

1377
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:16,958
Come on breathe, Ul! Push!

1378
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:30,708
It's almost there.

1379
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:48,208
Yes, Ms. Nanik?

1380
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:49,375
<i>Salina is nowhere to be found.</i>

1381
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:53,791
<i>Her room is empty.</i>

1382
01:36:00,208 --> 01:36:01,291
Ms. Nanik,

1383
01:36:01,875 --> 01:36:03,333
check with security now.

1384
01:36:04,416 --> 01:36:05,916
-Now.
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

1385
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:12,583
Has anyone seen Salina?

1386
01:36:12,666 --> 01:36:14,208
Maybe in the restroom, ma'am?

1387
01:36:18,791 --> 01:36:19,916
Push, Ulfah.

1388
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:23,083
Stop saying that!

1389
01:36:23,166 --> 01:36:25,333
You don't know how this feels.
It hurts so much!

1390
01:36:25,416 --> 01:36:27,125
-Yes, Ul.
-Keep calm.

1391
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:30,208
Calm and in the name of Allah…

1392
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:32,958
That's it!

1393
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:36,041
Thank God, it's a girl!

1394
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:39,458
Here, cut the umbilical cord.

1395
01:36:47,416 --> 01:36:48,875
I want to hold her.

1396
01:36:49,458 --> 01:36:50,708
There you go!

1397
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:56,125
You must take this baby to the hospital.

1398
01:36:59,958 --> 01:37:01,333
Baby Padma.

1399
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:05,500
Her name is Padma.

1400
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:10,375
Spoiled brat!

1401
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:13,375
She even went to the Beauty Lab!

1402
01:37:14,166 --> 01:37:15,500
I can't do this anymore.

1403
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:19,458
How can we be fooled by these brats!

1404
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:23,583
Where the hell was our surveillance team?

1405
01:37:24,708 --> 01:37:27,041
Fucking brats!

1406
01:37:31,541 --> 01:37:34,166
Our guards are all idiots!

1407
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:35,333
How…

1408
01:37:35,958 --> 01:37:38,333
It's comfortable enough. Thank you, Tar.

1409
01:37:39,666 --> 01:37:41,666
Take a picture of Baby Padma
and send it to Hafiz.

1410
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:42,833
What should I write?

1411
01:37:42,916 --> 01:37:44,833
Anything that will lift his spirit.

1412
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:55,000
THIS IS BABY PADMA,
SHE WAS BORN EARLY, STRONG, HEALTHY,

1413
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:56,708
AND WE'RE OKAY.

1414
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:02,416
Take a look at this, Ms. Nanik.

1415
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:05,083
We've checked the GPS tracking
and it seems that they have stopped.

1416
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,708
They're not too far away from here.

1417
01:38:08,666 --> 01:38:11,208
Shall I command security
to search the area?

1418
01:38:11,291 --> 01:38:15,041
You should've done that ages ago! Quickly!

1419
01:38:16,083 --> 01:38:16,916
Yes, sir.

1420
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:19,208
Bring Hafiz here!

1421
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:22,041
He must be sacrificed.

1422
01:38:22,125 --> 01:38:24,958
Coordinate with the entire
apartment security team.

1423
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:32,250
This is exactly like
the incident two years ago!

1424
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:37,291
I terminated those punks easily.

1425
01:38:37,375 --> 01:38:39,000
But not these girls!

1426
01:38:42,791 --> 01:38:44,625
How will our relationship
with Mr. Frans be?

1427
01:38:44,708 --> 01:38:45,875
And tomorrow's your wedding day!

1428
01:38:45,958 --> 01:38:49,000
Don't you dare force me
to marry a spoiled traitor!

1429
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:57,666
<i>Fiz, thank you for reminding me
what's important in life.</i>

1430
01:39:00,583 --> 01:39:03,166
<i>Now, we need your magical editing touch.</i>

1431
01:39:04,375 --> 01:39:06,166
Okay, I've sent the files

1432
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:07,916
and uploaded my first video online.

1433
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:36,083
<i>I'm Salina and I'm turning 17.</i>

1434
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:40,833
<i>This is my room
at The Light, and joining them</i>

1435
01:39:40,916 --> 01:39:43,208
<i>was the biggest mistake
I've ever made in my life.</i>

1436
01:39:43,791 --> 01:39:45,916
<i>-Stay tuned for more!</i>
-Bastards!

1437
01:39:47,708 --> 01:39:49,208
@ME_LISA: I CAN HACK THEIR FUND SOURCES

1438
01:39:49,291 --> 01:39:53,291
Sof, we must protect
our estate and assets.

1439
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,750
<i>You know that it is just for show, right?</i>

1440
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:07,708
<i>I can tinker with the matchmaking
system according to my will.</i>

1441
01:40:07,791 --> 01:40:09,833
<i>Call our lawyer now, Sof.</i>

1442
01:40:12,916 --> 01:40:17,291
You know. I never approved
of your narcissistic documentary.

1443
01:40:30,291 --> 01:40:31,416
Damn!

1444
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:32,833
The apartment is empty too.

1445
01:40:32,916 --> 01:40:34,833
<i>-I hope Hafiz is safe.</i>
-The boy is gone.

1446
01:40:34,916 --> 01:40:36,916
<i>I never regret being in love</i>

1447
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,833
<i>as it trains me to be courageous.</i>

1448
01:40:39,416 --> 01:40:42,333
<i>Also, I've understood heartbreak,
which developed my intuition.</i>

1449
01:40:42,416 --> 01:40:44,625
Go back to sleep, Padma

1450
01:40:45,833 --> 01:40:48,750
By the way, what did
the old lady say earlier?

1451
01:40:49,333 --> 01:40:50,750
That?

1452
01:40:51,583 --> 01:40:53,791
She said that in ancient times,

1453
01:40:53,875 --> 01:40:56,166
babies born at seven months young

1454
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:57,791
bring along a message,

1455
01:40:58,458 --> 01:41:00,291
like a prophecy.

1456
01:41:01,375 --> 01:41:04,291
A message for her mom and aunties

1457
01:41:04,375 --> 01:41:07,166
to stick together and love each other.

1458
01:41:10,083 --> 01:41:11,791
Ul, how do you feel?

1459
01:41:11,875 --> 01:41:13,708
It must have hurt like crazy.

1460
01:41:15,166 --> 01:41:16,791
It still hurts everywhere.

1461
01:41:18,291 --> 01:41:20,000
But I feel like gaining a superpower.

1462
01:41:25,083 --> 01:41:27,166
<i>I think Tara and I can totally relate</i>

1463
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:29,291
<i>to Ulfah's embracing her superpower.</i>

1464
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:32,125
<i>As girls, we've never been taught</i>

1465
01:41:32,208 --> 01:41:34,291
<i>that strength
and independence are possible</i>

1466
01:41:34,375 --> 01:41:35,833
<i>even without the approval of others.</i>

1467
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:39,333
<i>But now, the three of us
definitely believe</i>

1468
01:41:39,833 --> 01:41:42,833
<i>that the superpower
has always been embedded in us.</i>

1469
01:41:43,666 --> 01:41:44,916
<i>Since forever!</i>
