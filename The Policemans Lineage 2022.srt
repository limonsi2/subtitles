00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:08,080
Let go!

10
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,080
Son of a bitch!

11
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:13,121
Stay where you are.

12
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,955
Your head’s next.

13
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:15,913
Detective!

14
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:18,663
I’m coming down, please...

15
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
Here it is.

16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,580
Who are you handing this to?

17
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:27,830
You just saw me come in.

18
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:31,246
Listen to this guy.

19
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:32,871
No security cams nearby.

20
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:41,163
So you came in here
by sheer chance?

21
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:41,830
Yes.

22
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:43,038
I’ll count to three.

23
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:44,496
One.

24
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,330
Two!

25
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,830
Hey, listen, this isn’t yours, right?

26
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,246
Right.

27
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:54,788
Sir, we should take him in.

28
00:02:54,788 --> 00:02:56,788
Let go, we were staking out
for days for him.

29
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:58,288
This is next.

30
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:00,663
Is it yours or not?

31
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,955
It’s mine! That drug is mine!

32
00:03:07,913 --> 00:03:10,871
Witness, please come forward.

33
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:20,288
As a Seocho Police
Major Crimes officer

34
00:03:21,205 --> 00:03:24,371
you’ve investigated my client
with Det. Sohn Byung-sik,

35
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:29,371
and you were present at
the crime scene during his arrest.

36
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,288
Is this correct?

37
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:35,830
Was my client forcibly arrested?

38
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:41,205
Yes.

39
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,580
Defense rests.

40
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:43,871
There he comes.

41
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:44,913
Choi Min-jae!

42
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:46,038
Backstabbing bastard!

43
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:46,996
Easy, easy!

44
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:50,746
Don’t do this here,
take it easy.

45
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,413
I understand who you are,

46
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:57,038
I do, but I’m still dumbfounded.

47
00:03:58,788 --> 00:03:59,871
You go on ahead.

48
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:05,580
It was a month-long stakeout,
stupid bastard...

49
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,121
- I’ll arrest him again...
- Shut your mouth.

50
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:12,080
Lay low and come back
when things die down.

51
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:14,913
Choi Min-jae.

52
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:18,205
You’re the only one just?

53
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:24,080
That’s what I’m saying!

54
00:04:25,413 --> 00:04:27,788
Why are you so anal?

55
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:29,955
Stay outside for a while and go home.

56
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:32,205
All right.

57
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:33,955
Oh yeah, Choi.

58
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:37,246
Internal Affairs wants you.

59
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:43,413
Choi Min-jae?

60
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:45,621
We’re from the Metro.

61
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:51,205
This is Det. Hwang In-ho,
Internal Affairs section chief.

62
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:54,246
Major Crimes, Choi Min-jae, sir.

63
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,288
I called you here for a favor.

64
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:01,371
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:05,788
We’d like you to covertly
carry out an internal investigation.

66
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:08,288
Police Record: Park Kang-yoon

67
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:11,621
Go after a cop, you mean?

68
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,080
Is this an order?

69
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:17,830
It’s nothing like that,
the decision is yours.

70
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:20,955
Then I’d like to decline.

71
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,705
This is dishonorable.

72
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:25,205
It’s also outside of my duties.

73
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:30,163
My apologies,
I’ll head out.

74
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:35,663
A cop died because of
this incident.

75
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,663
Honor of the police
is on the line.

76
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:42,663
We must get to the bottom of it
before it gets out.

77
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:50,871
Ever heard of Investigation Unit’s
Park Kang-yoon?

78
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:52,621
He’s a major player at Metro.

79
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:54,080
His specialty is intel gathering.

80
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,288
From gangs, drugs to gambling,

81
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:58,705
he’s got informants at every level.

82
00:06:00,455 --> 00:06:02,038
He’s simply unrivaled.

83
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:13,288
Heard about the Wonju
factory drug bust 3 years ago?

84
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:14,538
Yes, I remember.

85
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:17,746
Wasn’t it a joint op
between NIS and narcos...

86
00:06:17,746 --> 00:06:22,038
It looked that way,
but Park did that alone.

87
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,246
New Drug Distribution Gang Arrested

88
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:31,705
It’s possible,
if he crossed the line.

89
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,746
Roundup of New Gang 21st Century Clan

90
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:37,871
We believe that Park is backed
by a special organization.

91
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:45,455
He’s given tens of thousands
of dollars to investigate,

92
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:47,663
which are all from unknown source.

93
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:50,913
So how does the death
of a cop fit into this?

94
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,996
We had a man in his unit
digging into him.

95
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,913
Sgt. Lee Myung-ju,
he was killed.

96
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:01,580
We believe that he instigated
Lee’s death after finding out,

97
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,621
and destroyed the evidence.

98
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:07,038
Which means, a cop had
another cop killed.

99
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:09,496
Why me, sir?

100
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,330
Why did you become a cop?

101
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:17,621
My...

102
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:23,663
father walked this path.

103
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:26,121
I wanted to follow...

104
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:27,913
That’s it, lineage.

105
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:32,330
Grandfather, Choi Eul-young,
father, Choi Dong-su, and you.

106
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:34,246
Three generations of cops.

107
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,246
A cop’s blood flows in you.

108
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:44,496
Your father passed away
in the line of duty, no?

109
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:45,746
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:51,538
Everyone knew the man
who dissolved the 3-Way clan.

111
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:52,871
Is that so?

112
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:55,163
But his on the job death
was never acknowledged?

113
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:56,580
No, sir.

114
00:07:56,746 --> 00:08:00,705
Did you know there is
a secret report on him?

115
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:07,080
I’ll share it with you
after this detail.

116
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,878
He took a child hostage!

117
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:20,080
Min-jae, it’s your dad.

118
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,455
I heard he was a cop.

119
00:08:25,496 --> 00:08:27,913
Jeon Yong-bae!
This is Choi Dong-su!

120
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:30,080
Let’s talk, okay?

121
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:39,330
Let your daughter go,
take me instead.

122
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:41,455
Good to see you.

123
00:08:41,746 --> 00:08:45,996
This bitch tried to kill me
with poison...

124
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:49,913
Jeon, please don't do this.

125
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,496
Mister...

126
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:11,455
Please let me go,
someone’s taking my child...

127
00:09:27,038 --> 00:09:27,955
Dad!

128
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:32,038
Dad! Dad!

129
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,205
No!

130
00:09:36,288 --> 00:09:38,788
Dad! Dad!

131
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,330
Dad! No!

132
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:17,455
This was your father's.

133
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:33,663
Internal Affairs
Hwang In-ho

134
00:10:36,955 --> 00:10:39,080
Hello, this is Choi Min-jae.

135
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:53,705
Sir, it was an order
from the section chief...

136
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:55,955
What are you doing?
Put the mask back on.

137
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,455
I could be hunted down, sir.

138
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:57,955
Take him.

139
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:00,246
Detective, sir!

140
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:02,080
You don’t know
what they’ll do!

141
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,580
He exploits the media like this.

142
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,246
Customs Agent Killed
Colleague For Drugs

143
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:07,455
Customs Agent Killed
Colleague For Drugs

144
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:11,705
But there’s someone
who’s driving Park crazy.

145
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:15,955
Na Young-bin,
I’m sure you’ve heard of him.

146
00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:17,455
CEO of Mirae Corp.

147
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:19,288
3 convictions for production
and distribution of illegal drugs

148
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:21,830
He comes from money,
studied overseas.

149
00:11:22,913 --> 00:11:26,913
He doesn’t need to do this,
but he’s got the smarts.

150
00:11:28,038 --> 00:11:30,663
From politics to media,
his connections are limitless.

151
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,496
Park arrested Na 3 times,
but Na got away every damn time.

152
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,413
No wonder Park’s pissed.

153
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:44,455
Here, the one handing over
the bag is Cha.

154
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,038
The one receiving it
is presumed to be Park,

155
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:51,496
but we only got this shot
from his back.

156
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:55,788
Why is Park protecting Cha?

157
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:58,955
Cha is a small fish
compared to Na,

158
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:00,913
and not as meticulous.

159
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:04,663
And he puts up with Park.

160
00:12:04,663 --> 00:12:07,163
Which means,
with Na locked up,

161
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:09,913
Park can do whatever he wants,

162
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,288
with Cha as his front.

163
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,121
Cha has been expanding
to the Japanese market

164
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,080
when Na got out.

165
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:26,621
This is our chance to get Park.

166
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:33,330
Who’s the victim?

167
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,413
The customs agent whom
Park put in front of the media.

168
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:37,288
Son of a...

169
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:38,871
Which way?

170
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:43,080
Jesus!

171
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:45,413
Out of the way.

172
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:51,413
What are you doing?

173
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:53,746
Park, you’re amazing.

174
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,121
You used a man’s life
as a bait for your case.

175
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:57,955
Pardon?

176
00:12:58,746 --> 00:12:59,913
What happened?

177
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:02,288
It must be Na Young-bin.

178
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:05,830
He was released recently,
and started cutting his tails.

179
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,705
Everything’s Na to you,
what about Cha?

180
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,621
I heard he’s flexing
his muscles overseas.

181
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:15,038
I was told that Cha’s clan
has been disbanded.

182
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:20,621
So you’re cleaning up the mess
out of pure sorrow?

183
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:21,580
Chief Han.

184
00:13:21,996 --> 00:13:24,705
If it wasn’t for us, you wouldn’t
have known about Na’s return.

185
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:29,121
If you’re gonna eat
my crumbs, do it quietly.

186
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:31,830
Are you serious?
I’ve had it with you!

187
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,871
Come on!

188
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:37,121
It’s barely been a month
since Na got out.

189
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:42,705
Sort this out before
shit hits the fan, got it?

190
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:44,413
Of course, sir.

191
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:48,330
Bring me something
to lock him up for good!

192
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:49,996
Yes, sir.

193
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:53,621
I’ll give you 10 days.

194
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:55,830
Sir.

195
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:04,371
I’ve assigned you
to Park’s unit.

196
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:07,955
Remember, you can
never be exposed.

197
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:10,288
Det. Choi Min-jae?

198
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:25,788
Chief’s desk over there,
captain’s over here.

199
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:26,996
And this is yours.

200
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:28,788
Thank you.

201
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:30,538
Put your bag down and report in.

202
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:31,538
Yes, sir.

203
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:34,871
My name is Choi Min-jae.

204
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:36,496
Good to meet you all.

205
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:37,705
Here.

206
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Investigation expenses,
absentee logs.

207
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:44,580
Good luck!

208
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,288
I’ll do my best, sir.

209
00:14:46,538 --> 00:14:47,205
Good!

210
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,621
What’ll help you adapt
and endure here?

211
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:54,746
In the end, it’s men.

212
00:14:55,788 --> 00:15:00,621
No matter how difficult things get,
the man beside you will help.

213
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:02,663
I’ll remember that, sir!

214
00:15:03,913 --> 00:15:05,205
Wait, hold up.

215
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,663
We have to head out soon,

216
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:11,746
cuff this fat bastard up,
he might wake up later.

217
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:12,455
Don’t have a pair yet?

218
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:13,205
Not yet, sir.

219
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,663
This bastard’s a weirdo.

220
00:15:28,038 --> 00:15:29,080
Wait!

221
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:32,705
Who’s this asshole?

222
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:36,913
Sing a song.

223
00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:37,913
Like this?

224
00:15:37,913 --> 00:15:39,496
Then just stand there.

225
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:44,496
Make sure to dance too,
don’t spoil the mood.

226
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:45,788
Go on.

227
00:15:46,788 --> 00:15:50,121
Uh, all right.

228
00:15:51,205 --> 00:15:53,371
I’ll do my best.

229
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,330
One, two, three, four!

230
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:08,621
Be careful of
those cherry lips

231
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:11,746
- Be careful of those...
- Stop, stop, stop!

232
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,038
- Good morning.
- Sir.

233
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:14,663
Salute.

234
00:16:16,288 --> 00:16:17,330
You should continue.

235
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:23,371
You know those
passport counterfeiters?

236
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:25,163
They opened up a shop
in Ahyun district.

237
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:27,913
- Make note of it.
- Thank you, boss!

238
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:30,830
Damn...

239
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:33,246
Choi Min-jae,

240
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:35,413
you’re with me.

241
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:36,496
Pardon?

242
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,246
You’ll keep him around?

243
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:39,996
Hey, hey, hey!

244
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:41,663
- Stay with him.
- Okay...

245
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:00,371
Get changed first.

246
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:20,746
Come on.

247
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:21,830
Sir?

248
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:25,871
Drive, Cheongdam district.

249
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:26,913
Yes, sir.

250
00:17:33,871 --> 00:17:34,621
Deputy Manager Choi.

251
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,080
Me, sir?

252
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:39,038
Wanna be ‘Supervisor’?

253
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:40,913
No, chief.

254
00:17:40,913 --> 00:17:42,871
Don’t call me that,
call me ‘boss’.

255
00:17:43,288 --> 00:17:45,996
Don’t sound like a cop
out here.

256
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:47,830
Yes, boss.

257
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,621
Okay, give me
a rundown of you.

258
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:51,830
Yes, boss.

259
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,121
Born in 1990, majored law,

260
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:56,121
graduated the academy in 2015,

261
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:59,121
worked in Major Crimes
before my transfer here.

262
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:03,038
My hobbies are judo, tennis,
currently single.

263
00:18:07,237 --> 00:18:08,362
I knew your father.

264
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,047
My father?

265
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,884
We had a history.

266
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,373
I didn't know.

267
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:01,446
My boss is out at the moment...

268
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:03,363
Good to see you, Mr. Kwon.

269
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,071
You startled me...

270
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,030
Why did you suddenly...

271
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:15,405
Who is he?

272
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,780
You’ll get to know him.

273
00:19:19,363 --> 00:19:20,613
I’m Kwon Ki-ahn.

274
00:19:21,863 --> 00:19:23,696
Choi Min-jae,
deputy manager.

275
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:30,113
You’re a cutie
with terrible manners.

276
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:31,655
You got a bark in you.

277
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,071
Na didn’t contact you?

278
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:37,863
I cut all ties with him,
you know that.

279
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:45,738
I got coffee, have some.

280
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:47,821
What’s Na’s product?

281
00:19:48,238 --> 00:19:48,988
Something new?

282
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,238
Don’t be like that,
I really don’t know.

283
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:54,071
Several men are dead,
including a customs agent.

284
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:55,446
My company thinks
it’s a big case.

285
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:59,071
If you don’t cooperate,
it’ll get difficult for you.

286
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:01,821
When I think about that asshole,

287
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:04,446
I feel like shit, that’s all...

288
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:09,363
I heard the business was bad,
you got into retail too?

289
00:20:09,363 --> 00:20:12,696
What’s with you today,
you’re embarrassing me!

290
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:16,738
What’s got into you...

291
00:20:20,405 --> 00:20:22,488
You’re under arrest
for illegal substance abuse.

292
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,321
Mr. Choi, could you step outside?

293
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,988
But chief...

294
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:34,280
Go outside.

295
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:04,821
I really don’t know anything
about some customs agent...

296
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,696
I only heard that he was
gathering potential investors.

297
00:21:09,113 --> 00:21:09,655
Money?

298
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:12,071
He needs money?

299
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:17,655
I heard he bought an expensive
license to a new technique.

300
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:21,696
It’s expensive enough
to buy Major Leaguers.

301
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:25,696
I’m serious,
that’s all I heard.

302
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:30,571
Please believe me,
look at my eyes, please!

303
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:32,780
Okay, understood.

304
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:39,946
Are we gonna overlook
his needle marks?

305
00:21:40,655 --> 00:21:42,821
We don’t go after small timers.

306
00:21:43,946 --> 00:21:46,530
Kwon may be a junkie,
but he’s got good ears.

307
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,321
It’s better to use him
as an informant.

308
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,071
Did you receive the key?

309
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:11,780
She changed it to a keypad,
28487898.

310
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,030
Asshole.

311
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:18,321
Don’t be scared, I drank
a barrel when I got in.

312
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:19,738
Stay frosty.

313
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:27,530
So? Was it cool
accompanying the chief?

314
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:30,071
I’m not sure yet.

315
00:22:31,113 --> 00:22:32,446
Where did you go?

316
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:35,363
A furniture shop in Cheongdam.

317
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:40,530
So you were there
when he met his informant?

318
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,196
Yes.

319
00:22:46,363 --> 00:22:49,113
Kiddo, the thing about
informants is,

320
00:22:49,113 --> 00:22:50,446
you don’t tell anyone
about them.

321
00:22:50,655 --> 00:22:51,738
Not even your wife.

322
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,530
Do you know what I’m saying?

323
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,530
I’m so jealous!

324
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:02,488
Hazing is still a thing?

325
00:23:02,488 --> 00:23:03,738
It’s a tradition, sir.

326
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,780
It’s been too long
since we got a new member.

327
00:23:07,155 --> 00:23:08,613
All right, let’s drink.

328
00:23:08,738 --> 00:23:09,321
Go!

329
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,738
- Go!
- Go!

330
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:11,946
For Unit 3!

331
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:13,613
Go on, kiddo.

332
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:14,530
Here.

333
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:16,821
Grow some balls.

334
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:18,905
You still got a long way to go.

335
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:20,196
Pour!

336
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,321
Get over here.

337
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:29,613
You're driving.

338
00:23:30,113 --> 00:23:30,863
Drink!

339
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,571
17:20, Cheongdam furniture shop.

340
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,821
A front for loan shark Kwon Ki-ahn.

341
00:23:55,321 --> 00:23:57,821
Park let his substance abuse slide,

342
00:23:58,113 --> 00:24:02,405
to presumably receive intel on Na.

343
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:05,363
Considering Park and Kwon’s relationship,

344
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:08,280
a partnership with Cha is feasible.

345
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:12,030
21:05, arrived at Banpo home.

346
00:24:13,113 --> 00:24:14,405
Thanks.

347
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:16,238
Come here starting
tomorrow morning.

348
00:24:16,238 --> 00:24:17,613
Okay, good night.

349
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:18,946
Good night.

350
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,696
170cm wide.

351
00:24:36,905 --> 00:24:37,946
170...

352
00:24:38,155 --> 00:24:39,446
125cm long.

353
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:40,446
125?

354
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:43,196
That’s the window measurement
without the frame.

355
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:46,988
Depending on his shoes,
there may be some discrepancies.

356
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,780
Between 184 and 185.

357
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:55,946
Between 184 and 185...

358
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:57,321
Height: 184.5cm

359
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:00,655
And his ear...

360
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:04,488
This is close to a 90% match.

361
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:06,780
It’s hard to be this close.

362
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:13,571
Yes, sir?

363
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:14,946
Where are you?

364
00:25:15,488 --> 00:25:17,030
I’m almost there, sir.

365
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,155
Come up when you get here.

366
00:25:18,155 --> 00:25:19,571
The passcode is my license plate.

367
00:25:19,571 --> 00:25:20,238
Yes, sir.

368
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:47,196
- You’re here?
- Sir.

369
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,905
I’m gonna wash up,
so change into that.

370
00:25:51,113 --> 00:25:51,905
Right.

371
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,530
- Size okay?
- Yes.

372
00:26:21,905 --> 00:26:23,530
- You look good in it.
- Thank you.

373
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,113
Are we going
somewhere in this?

374
00:26:27,113 --> 00:26:28,821
Isn’t it obvious?
To work.

375
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:30,571
Consider it your work uniform.

376
00:26:30,863 --> 00:26:32,946
Grab these jackets
and a watch too.

377
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,696
But sir...

378
00:26:35,238 --> 00:26:35,988
Too much?

379
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:39,613
My salary is hardly enough
to buy any of these...

380
00:26:39,613 --> 00:26:41,405
It’s from the top,
so don’t worry.

381
00:26:42,821 --> 00:26:43,655
The top?

382
00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:45,988
Let’s call them
key players of this society.

383
00:26:46,363 --> 00:26:48,113
Including a few Metro Police brass.

384
00:26:49,071 --> 00:26:51,363
No need to feel nervous,
just focus on work.

385
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:57,030
Chief, could I change my tie?

386
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,321
Pick whatever you want!

387
00:27:43,238 --> 00:27:44,655
Na Young-bin

388
00:28:20,696 --> 00:28:23,738
Why do we need suits
to catch criminals?

389
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,613
Never faced the super rich?

390
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:32,155
They only deal with
top 1% of society.

391
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:35,821
You can’t go near them
in a jacket you wore earlier.

392
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:39,238
Why do we take that into account?

393
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,113
We have to meet them
to catch them.

394
00:28:42,446 --> 00:28:46,280
They use money
to keep us far away.

395
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,113
Without a warrant,
you can’t even get close.

396
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:50,613
Consider it your uniform.

397
00:28:51,905 --> 00:28:52,488
Yes, sir.

398
00:29:00,863 --> 00:29:03,238
Mercedes was paid entirely in cash.

399
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:08,238
One-year lease and deposit
for luxury apartment paid in cash,

400
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:10,696
funding source unconfirmed.

401
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,071
Sir, you can’t park here,
move along please.

402
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:31,905
I’m an on-duty officer.

403
00:29:34,696 --> 00:29:36,738
I’ve never seen
a police Mercedes, sir.

404
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
Pardon me.

405
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:42,905
He’s a cop.

406
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:45,155
Vehicle Restoration

407
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:47,446
A few days ago,

408
00:29:47,446 --> 00:29:49,821
one of Cha’s cars
was totaled and brought in.

409
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:53,113
It’s true that Cha is
working with Yakuza.

410
00:29:53,113 --> 00:29:55,821
He must be trying to
push out Na for good.

411
00:29:56,488 --> 00:29:59,155
If there’s no game in town,
he will create one.

412
00:30:00,321 --> 00:30:02,113
Send me this photo,
got the plate number too?

413
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:17,821
Sorry for everything
and thank you.

414
00:30:18,238 --> 00:30:19,613
- Take care.
- See you.

415
00:30:29,488 --> 00:30:31,613
No contact with Cha yet,

416
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:35,946
but the man in the photo
is presumed to be Park.

417
00:30:44,488 --> 00:30:46,863
Na’s investigation is carried out alone.

418
00:30:47,488 --> 00:30:51,280
So is the Sgt. Lee murder case,

419
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,696
and his team is left out of the loop.

420
00:30:54,905 --> 00:30:57,238
A private safe was found in his study.

421
00:30:58,113 --> 00:30:59,821
Contents unknown.

422
00:31:57,571 --> 00:32:00,530
I’ll submit a separate report
in the future...

423
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,213
Could I take your...

424
00:32:21,421 --> 00:32:23,046
Na was released recently.

425
00:32:23,046 --> 00:32:25,546
So how much more
do you need?

426
00:32:25,755 --> 00:32:27,713
$500,000 should do.

427
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:30,046
This year’s expense rose
quite sharply.

428
00:32:30,505 --> 00:32:32,838
Is it because Na
causing problems?

429
00:32:33,005 --> 00:32:35,171
He’s a poisonous fungus.

430
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,588
I know you’re doing your best.

431
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:42,130
And you’re right,
he’s a poisonous fungus.

432
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:44,796
He must be removed
before he spores.

433
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:45,630
Yes.

434
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:50,171
He jacked up the cover,
and raised the barrier.

435
00:32:50,255 --> 00:32:52,380
I’ll use the money
for the informants,

436
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,005
and cut down my
investigation expenses.

437
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:57,380
No, you have a reputation
to maintain.

438
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,005
Sponsorship is there
to be spent on the field.

439
00:33:00,463 --> 00:33:04,213
I’ll talk to the elders
and send it right away.

440
00:33:04,838 --> 00:33:05,755
My apologies...

441
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:08,296
It’s quite all right.

442
00:33:28,713 --> 00:33:30,838
So it is from higher ups...

443
00:33:35,088 --> 00:33:36,546
But why’d a cop...

444
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:38,546
Chief Park Kang-yoon

445
00:33:40,171 --> 00:33:40,921
Yes, chief.

446
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:43,630
Sorry to bother you on the weekend,
but I need your help.

447
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,255
Right away, sir.

448
00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:57,296
Good to see you.

449
00:33:57,463 --> 00:33:58,921
What you asked for.

450
00:33:59,255 --> 00:34:01,213
It’s nice to see you so often.

451
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:06,380
If you miss the deadline,
get me a gun, okay?

452
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:08,838
Kidding.

453
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:13,005
Whenever you need money,
make sure to call me first.

454
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:14,546
- Drive.
- Yes, sir.

455
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:17,255
Oh yeah, I got a gift for you.

456
00:34:18,421 --> 00:34:21,963
This has a discreet camera
and you can record the footage

457
00:34:22,088 --> 00:34:24,671
on your phone,
the quality is incredible.

458
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:26,921
I gave it a spin,
it’s stunning!

459
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,005
You’ll feel like a spy,
James Bond!

460
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,963
Forget the gift,
put it on my tab.

461
00:34:34,296 --> 00:34:36,130
Catch plenty of bad guys!

462
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:37,380
Salute!

463
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,296
Boss...

464
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:54,588
Should you borrow so much
from a loan shark?

465
00:34:54,713 --> 00:34:57,380
Why? Scared that
you’ll get shit stained?

466
00:34:57,921 --> 00:35:00,505
I can pay back quickly,
watch and learn.

467
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,880
But even so that much is...

468
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,380
Investigation Unit had a cop
named Sgt. Lee Myung-ju.

469
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:06,546
The murdered cop?

470
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,880
The perp who stabbed him
is supposedly inside.

471
00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:12,838
Under Na’s roof, cool, huh?

472
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:14,588
Is that true?

473
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,005
It was an expensive intel.

474
00:35:16,921 --> 00:35:19,088
If it’s wrong,
I’ll fuck up the informant.

475
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,130
Isn’t there a membership
to these events?

476
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:34,796
Guess how much.

477
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:36,546
$30,000 maybe?

478
00:35:36,796 --> 00:35:39,380
Depending on credit
$200,000 to 600,000 annually.

479
00:35:39,546 --> 00:35:42,630
A non-member cover
is $20,000 for a day.

480
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:46,546
We’re closed today.

481
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:49,755
I’m not here for the club,
I came to see Mr. Na.

482
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:50,963
It’s a private event.

483
00:35:51,171 --> 00:35:52,505
If you do not have a warrant,
please move along.

484
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,046
Piss off.

485
00:35:55,088 --> 00:35:56,421
Walk away while you can.

486
00:36:00,588 --> 00:36:01,588
Here, cover fee.

487
00:36:02,505 --> 00:36:05,296
I came to play poker,
he’s my bodyguard.

488
00:36:08,255 --> 00:36:10,005
Chief Park is coming in.

489
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,421
Mid-30s, about your height,

490
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:18,796
he has a scar on his right ear.

491
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:20,963
I’ll be at the poker table.

492
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,130
Scan Na’s associates
and slip out to the back.

493
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,255
Text me if you find him.

494
00:36:26,296 --> 00:36:27,088
I understand.

495
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,046
Mr. Na, it’s been a while.

496
00:36:34,588 --> 00:36:36,338
As you can see,
the table’s full.

497
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,380
So I should just go?
But we’re friends.

498
00:36:39,796 --> 00:36:40,796
I’ll wait.

499
00:36:47,213 --> 00:36:48,505
I fold.

500
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:49,546
I fold too.

501
00:36:49,546 --> 00:36:50,380
Fold.

502
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,588
Mr. Kim, leaving already?

503
00:36:58,963 --> 00:36:59,755
Jesus Christ...

504
00:36:59,755 --> 00:37:01,171
Terrible manners.

505
00:37:03,671 --> 00:37:05,838
Sit if you’re gonna play poker
quietly and leave,

506
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:07,796
or piss off.

507
00:37:28,671 --> 00:37:29,880
He’s heading up.

508
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,713
Oh my...

509
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,171
Mr. Na.

510
00:37:39,505 --> 00:37:42,296
Too bad for you, Det. Park.

511
00:37:42,296 --> 00:37:44,671
Jang, did you suck him dry?

512
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:48,255
Bring me some more chips.

513
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:51,380
$50,000

514
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,463
It was great today,
thank you.

515
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:55,963
No, this is expensive stuff...

516
00:37:57,171 --> 00:37:59,713
I can’t wait any longer.

517
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:04,671
I’m sorry.

518
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:05,713
It’s all right.

519
00:38:12,963 --> 00:38:14,921
... a scar on his right ear.

520
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,463
Found him.

521
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,171
Okay, thank you.

522
00:38:23,588 --> 00:38:24,796
My, my.

523
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,130
Mr. Na, what are you
up to nowadays?

524
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,255
Give me a business card.

525
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:29,838
I don’t have stuff like that.

526
00:38:30,338 --> 00:38:32,380
I’m officially unemployed.

527
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,505
I heard you started
a venture business.

528
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:39,771
I got bad credit,
no money whatsoever.

529
00:38:40,938 --> 00:38:45,480
It sounds so awkward to
hear that you’re penniless.

530
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:47,230
Give me your phone number.

531
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:48,980
I’m told this is a cordial event.

532
00:38:49,313 --> 00:38:50,938
No reason not to give me yours.

533
00:39:01,771 --> 00:39:02,813
Happy?

534
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,271
Remember him?

535
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:48,855
National ID: Lee Man-seok

536
00:39:51,646 --> 00:39:54,396
Lee Man-seok, you’re under arrest
for the murder of Lee Myung-ju.

537
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,938
What are you doing?
You’re guests here.

538
00:40:03,605 --> 00:40:06,646
Touch me again, I’ll arrest you
for obstruction of justice.

539
00:40:06,646 --> 00:40:07,896
Are you thugs or cops?

540
00:40:08,063 --> 00:40:09,896
Hey, that’s enough.

541
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,438
Pull your men back.

542
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:16,938
Let them go.

543
00:40:31,313 --> 00:40:32,688
He confessed.

544
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,730
Motive?

545
00:40:34,063 --> 00:40:35,980
It looks to be a simple robbery.

546
00:40:36,146 --> 00:40:38,730
No gang affiliation
and no known grudges.

547
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:43,021
An inspector was killed
in a simple robbery?

548
00:40:43,438 --> 00:40:45,855
And the perp’s employer
is Na Young-bin?

549
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:49,396
Not feeling well?
Get someone else?

550
00:40:50,313 --> 00:40:51,271
No, sir.

551
00:40:53,313 --> 00:40:56,188
Get him to fess up
by Monday morning.

552
00:40:56,396 --> 00:40:57,605
Understood, sir.

553
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,396
Det. Choi!

554
00:41:00,146 --> 00:41:01,021
Good work.

555
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:22,605
So Intelligence Unit 2 chief
is providing the funds?

556
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,063
Yes, if the fund source
is internal,

557
00:41:26,271 --> 00:41:28,521
I don’t know if it’s
a cause for concern.

558
00:41:28,855 --> 00:41:31,146
And Sgt. Lee’s killer,

559
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:35,105
Chief Park caught him himself.

560
00:41:35,355 --> 00:41:36,605
That’s more suspicious.

561
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:38,396
Why?

562
00:41:40,646 --> 00:41:42,730
This is confirmed to be Park, right?

563
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,146
Yes.

564
00:41:44,563 --> 00:41:49,396
Aside from the sponsorship,
prove that he took Cha’s dirty money.

565
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:52,771
Didn’t you say he borrowed
money from Kwon too?

566
00:41:54,521 --> 00:41:58,271
We need irrefutable evidence,
rather than suspicion.

567
00:41:59,688 --> 00:42:01,730
What you see isn’t everything.

568
00:42:08,646 --> 00:42:10,646
It’s an intense speed boat race!

569
00:42:10,646 --> 00:42:14,896
Of the 6 boats, #3 and #5
are leading the charge!

570
00:42:17,896 --> 00:42:21,605
#3’s Bae and #5’s Kim,
they’re on their final lap!

571
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:23,105
#3! Come on!

572
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:24,813
#3 vs. #5! It’s close!

573
00:42:24,813 --> 00:42:25,646
#3!

574
00:42:25,646 --> 00:42:27,438
The gap with the pack is widening!

575
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:28,980
They turned the final corner,

576
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,230
#3’s Bae Hyemin
and #5’s Kim Jong-min!

577
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,855
They’re fast approaching
the finish line!

578
00:42:35,813 --> 00:42:37,188
Come on! Catch up!

579
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:39,438
#3 and #5 are at the finish line!

580
00:42:39,438 --> 00:42:41,230
Neck and neck race
ends with #5 on top!

581
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,396
Come on!

582
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:48,938
Please keep your ticket
until the final decision.

583
00:42:49,438 --> 00:42:51,605
Boss, didn’t we finish first?

584
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:53,605
- #3.
- #3!

585
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:55,230
Yeah, Bae Hyemin!

586
00:42:55,438 --> 00:42:57,105
We did it! We won!

587
00:42:58,896 --> 00:43:00,855
I saw him finish first.

588
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:05,230
Can we have a feast tonight?

589
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,980
No can’t do,
gotta repay my debt first.

590
00:43:07,355 --> 00:43:09,813
The gambling debt from Kwon?

591
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:12,188
Better me than gamblers here,

592
00:43:12,188 --> 00:43:14,605
so the money is used
for the public good.

593
00:43:15,271 --> 00:43:16,146
Over there.

594
00:43:17,146 --> 00:43:19,230
Loan repaid in full.

595
00:43:19,438 --> 00:43:23,230
No evidence of bribery
or conspiracy with Kwon.

596
00:43:23,521 --> 00:43:26,563
No defraudation for
personal gain found.

597
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,646
No proper contact with Cha.

598
00:43:39,605 --> 00:43:40,730
Chief!

599
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:43,271
Is this also part of
your sponsorship?

600
00:43:43,271 --> 00:43:48,271
No, this is my treasure #1
with a 20-year loan.

601
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,771
I’m going to live here
when I retire.

602
00:43:50,855 --> 00:43:54,188
I’ll float around
and fish for life.

603
00:43:54,188 --> 00:43:56,855
It’s a bit small for that.

604
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,146
I’ll have less physical
and material baggage by then.

605
00:44:00,146 --> 00:44:04,480
A sleeping bag, dishware,
a camping stove and booze.

606
00:44:05,813 --> 00:44:06,605
Be careful.

607
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:07,855
Holy cow!

608
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,063
Cool, huh?

609
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:09,896
Whoa!

610
00:44:09,896 --> 00:44:10,980
That’s what I’m talking about.

611
00:44:13,063 --> 00:44:14,521
- Chief.
- Yeah?

612
00:44:14,938 --> 00:44:17,105
You said you knew my father.

613
00:44:19,105 --> 00:44:20,563
You really don’t remember?

614
00:44:22,021 --> 00:44:23,230
What do you mean?

615
00:44:35,688 --> 00:44:37,105
Dad!

616
00:44:37,688 --> 00:44:41,771
Dad! Dad!

617
00:44:42,021 --> 00:44:42,896
Let me go!

618
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:43,646
That’s my dad!

619
00:44:43,646 --> 00:44:44,605
No! Stop!

620
00:44:44,855 --> 00:44:47,313
I never thought
you’d become a cop.

621
00:44:48,563 --> 00:44:53,230
I was so proud of him
when as a kid.

622
00:44:56,271 --> 00:44:57,188
But...

623
00:44:59,605 --> 00:45:03,188
after those incidents...

624
00:45:06,355 --> 00:45:08,396
I became suspicious of him...

625
00:45:10,563 --> 00:45:13,688
And resented him
for letting it happen.

626
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:20,646
So I wanted to know
what being a cop entailed.

627
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:28,771
When I transferred to Bangbae
it was January.

628
00:45:28,938 --> 00:45:31,980
An old drug addict froze to death

629
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,688
by the police station wall.

630
00:45:36,605 --> 00:45:37,396
It was my father.

631
00:45:38,063 --> 00:45:41,688
An addict and an ex-con.

632
00:45:42,771 --> 00:45:44,438
He probably came looking for me.

633
00:45:45,521 --> 00:45:50,605
I was so ashamed of him
that I held his funeral

634
00:45:50,605 --> 00:45:54,480
without ever telling my colleagues.

635
00:45:56,146 --> 00:46:00,230
I don’t know how he found out,
but he came to the funeral.

636
00:46:01,105 --> 00:46:02,521
Sgt. Choi Dong-su.

637
00:46:04,938 --> 00:46:08,605
That’s who your father was.

638
00:46:19,813 --> 00:46:21,230
Just don’t become a cop.

639
00:46:22,355 --> 00:46:23,271
Never.

640
00:46:29,938 --> 00:46:33,313
Can I ask you
more about him?

641
00:46:33,896 --> 00:46:38,313
Don’t rush it,
I’ll tell you little by little.

642
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:42,563
Nothing’s biting,
let’s call it a day.

643
00:46:53,396 --> 00:46:55,480
Name:

644
00:47:00,605 --> 00:47:01,980
Park Kang-yoon

645
00:47:09,355 --> 00:47:10,688
Seoul Metro Police
Investigation Unit

646
00:47:29,563 --> 00:47:31,646
Final Report

647
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:42,896
...no evidence of embezzlement,
or illegal slush fund for investigation...

648
00:47:49,688 --> 00:47:51,563
Na Young-bin

649
00:47:52,146 --> 00:47:54,480
These are videos of
Na’s investor meetings.

650
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,021
Cross reference it
with today’s attendees,

651
00:47:57,313 --> 00:47:59,521
ID everyone you can.

652
00:47:59,813 --> 00:48:02,730
Once verified, figure out
their relation to Na,

653
00:48:03,105 --> 00:48:05,563
criminal records, financials,
recent business transactions,

654
00:48:05,563 --> 00:48:07,605
and any notable figures
they’re in close contact with.

655
00:48:07,771 --> 00:48:09,688
Most importantly,
get their numbers.

656
00:48:09,938 --> 00:48:11,188
Report to me when you do.

657
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:11,980
Yes, sir.

658
00:48:14,105 --> 00:48:16,896
I need to get my stuff,
stand by here.

659
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,021
Yes, sir.

660
00:48:45,896 --> 00:48:47,021
Section Chief Hwang

661
00:48:54,663 --> 00:48:55,871
Something wrong?

662
00:48:56,413 --> 00:48:59,413
No, behind us...

663
00:49:02,246 --> 00:49:03,538
It’s probably nothing.

664
00:49:10,413 --> 00:49:11,496
Back it up.

665
00:49:35,288 --> 00:49:38,455
You’re charged with violation
of code of conduct, get out.

666
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:47,996
Give us a tour of your home.

667
00:49:48,455 --> 00:49:49,371
I heard you’re well off.

668
00:49:56,788 --> 00:49:57,663
Why not.

669
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:08,121
Sir.

670
00:50:09,413 --> 00:50:10,996
What’s going on?

671
00:50:11,871 --> 00:50:15,121
I wrote in my report that
there aren’t any problems.

672
00:50:15,121 --> 00:50:16,621
I’m the one who decide.

673
00:50:17,871 --> 00:50:20,830
Don’t worry, I’ll make sure
you’re not exposed.

674
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:25,663
So?

675
00:50:27,621 --> 00:50:29,288
Should we open it,
or will you?

676
00:50:32,371 --> 00:50:32,913
Open it.

677
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:01,996
What the hell?
There are only contracts.

678
00:51:03,621 --> 00:51:05,246
Okay, we’re done here,
take him away.

679
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,080
This way.

680
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,288
Who’s your source?

681
00:51:24,288 --> 00:51:25,205
I’ve told you already.

682
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:26,955
I received sponsorship.

683
00:51:26,955 --> 00:51:27,788
From whom?

684
00:51:28,496 --> 00:51:29,788
Yeonnam Association?

685
00:51:30,996 --> 00:51:33,413
Sir, can you take the heat?

686
00:51:41,621 --> 00:51:43,913
I could never take heat
for that much money.

687
00:51:44,163 --> 00:51:45,996
That money can’t be clean.

688
00:51:46,496 --> 00:51:48,538
Is there such a thing
as clean money?

689
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,955
I have no problem stripping
your uniform immediately.

690
00:51:54,538 --> 00:51:57,496
But one man behind bars
isn’t good enough.

691
00:51:58,038 --> 00:52:00,746
I’m going to uproot
your entire organization.

692
00:52:00,955 --> 00:52:02,496
Sure, do your thing.

693
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:06,705
Sponsorship? Right,
they really like to spurge.

694
00:52:07,205 --> 00:52:09,996
But don’t you know they’ll
use you and toss you out.

695
00:52:10,871 --> 00:52:12,746
You’re just a prop to them.

696
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,705
You’ll use that money
to catch criminals?

697
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:19,288
Those who ignore principles
and laws and accept dirty money

698
00:52:19,288 --> 00:52:21,705
are corroding the entire
police organization.

699
00:52:22,163 --> 00:52:26,330
You’re a disgrace to
all the honest cops.

700
00:52:27,288 --> 00:52:29,830
Do you actually think
what you’re doing is just?

701
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:32,830
I don’t care what others think,

702
00:52:33,163 --> 00:52:36,496
cops are only cops when
we catch perps and close cases.

703
00:52:37,413 --> 00:52:41,746
I heard you let your
child’s killer walk free.

704
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:44,163
You fucking trash!

705
00:52:44,455 --> 00:52:45,496
Listen.

706
00:52:47,288 --> 00:52:48,996
Let’s just do our jobs.

707
00:52:49,538 --> 00:52:53,705
I’ll stick to investigation,
and you pretend to be a cop,

708
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:58,038
and go after hard-working
police officers, got that?

709
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:01,080
You are a tumor.

710
00:53:01,996 --> 00:53:03,871
You must be removed
with a scalpel.

711
00:53:05,288 --> 00:53:06,871
Try it, if you can.

712
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,038
Sir, you got a phone call.

713
00:53:17,788 --> 00:53:22,246
Let’s see how long
you remain on top.

714
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,705
- Back?
- Yes, sir.

715
00:53:29,996 --> 00:53:32,538
What happened?

716
00:53:32,705 --> 00:53:34,746
Uh, the thing is...

717
00:53:35,288 --> 00:53:37,538
they ambushed us, so...

718
00:53:37,788 --> 00:53:38,580
That’s all?

719
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,330
Yes...

720
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,830
Call me with updates.

721
00:53:42,955 --> 00:53:44,455
Yes, captain.

722
00:53:46,663 --> 00:53:47,663
Choi Min-jae.

723
00:53:47,996 --> 00:53:51,121
If you were by his side,
you should’ve watched him.

724
00:53:51,246 --> 00:53:52,538
Right...

725
00:54:19,205 --> 00:54:20,413
It’ll be in the 2nd report.

726
00:54:21,038 --> 00:54:25,246
Financial, call records, wiretaps,
we gotta be thorough, sir.

727
00:54:26,746 --> 00:54:28,580
Laying down the charge
won’t be a problem.

728
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,663
We’re close to uncovering
the Yeonnam...

729
00:54:31,871 --> 00:54:33,496
What exactly is the reason?!

730
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,871
My apologies, sir.

731
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,705
But this time we have to...

732
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,788
Choi Min-jae

733
00:55:08,288 --> 00:55:10,580
Come to the diner,
contingency meeting

734
00:55:15,955 --> 00:55:17,288
Ma’am, could you leave us?

735
00:55:20,788 --> 00:55:22,913
Get the shutter.

736
00:55:28,913 --> 00:55:29,788
What are you up to?

737
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:31,413
Did something happen?

738
00:55:31,538 --> 00:55:32,913
Why do you think
we called you here?

739
00:55:34,496 --> 00:55:36,538
Hur, stay out of this.

740
00:55:40,746 --> 00:55:41,788
Come here.

741
00:55:48,455 --> 00:55:51,871
Min-jae, let me ask you
a serious question.

742
00:55:52,121 --> 00:55:54,038
We’re not 100% certain,

743
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,746
but there’s a rumor going around.

744
00:56:00,996 --> 00:56:02,205
Are you the mole?

745
00:56:06,371 --> 00:56:08,205
Why can’t you talk?!

746
00:56:08,205 --> 00:56:11,080
Are you the mole
who backstabbed our chief?!

747
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,705
Asshole, is that true?

748
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,455
Search him.

749
00:56:17,246 --> 00:56:18,205
One second...

750
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:23,246
Bastard...

751
00:56:28,163 --> 00:56:30,038
Your fingers will break.

752
00:56:30,288 --> 00:56:31,371
Let go!

753
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,913
I’ll break them!

754
00:56:50,246 --> 00:56:51,038
What’s going on?

755
00:56:59,371 --> 00:57:00,705
They worked us.

756
00:57:03,913 --> 00:57:06,913
It looks like Internal Affairs
planted him.

757
00:57:11,455 --> 00:57:13,413
Everyone out except Min-jae.

758
00:57:15,538 --> 00:57:16,496
Let’s go.

759
00:57:35,246 --> 00:57:36,538
What was the reason?

760
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,163
Promotion?

761
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,663
It’s nothing like that.

762
00:57:44,663 --> 00:57:47,996
So? What are my charges?

763
00:57:49,871 --> 00:57:55,288
I concluded my report
with no charges laid.

764
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,371
Let me ask you something.

765
00:58:00,538 --> 00:58:03,996
Internal Affairs and
my orders contradict.

766
00:58:04,246 --> 00:58:05,288
Who will you follow?

767
00:58:10,121 --> 00:58:14,996
Listen, you’re in my team
and we are a unit.

768
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:18,746
So you just have to
follow my order.

769
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,371
Even if it breaks rules
and deemed illegal?

770
00:58:22,996 --> 00:58:26,996
Going after perps can’t be illegal,
no matter the situation and method.

771
00:58:30,413 --> 00:58:35,205
It’s about choosing
to become a real cop,

772
00:58:36,121 --> 00:58:37,830
or a bureaucrat.

773
00:58:38,663 --> 00:58:44,288
There will be a time
you’ll be forced to choose.

774
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:47,038
I’ll follow the call of the police.

775
00:58:53,955 --> 00:58:56,121
This does not change
you and I.

776
00:59:00,121 --> 00:59:03,705
But things will be difficult
at the office for a while.

777
00:59:10,538 --> 00:59:12,413
My report won’t have any effect?

778
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,371
Chief paid Kwon back in full.

779
00:59:16,746 --> 00:59:20,455
Or is there other charges
that I don’t know about?

780
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,430
Park’s charges...

781
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:26,888
Are you protecting that bastard?

782
00:59:27,403 --> 00:59:28,388
Sir.

783
00:59:29,846 --> 00:59:32,805
Did you know Park
served under your father?

784
00:59:33,305 --> 00:59:34,346
I knew.

785
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,263
What about his mother,
who committed suicide?

786
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:45,680
Your father locked up Park’s
father for substance abuse,

787
00:59:46,087 --> 00:59:48,837
and his mother killed herself
from the shock.

788
00:59:49,846 --> 00:59:50,930
Did he tell you that?

789
00:59:51,305 --> 00:59:54,680
Your father checked in on him
while he was in the system.

790
00:59:54,805 --> 00:59:57,846
Maybe he felt responsible,
or sympathetic.

791
00:59:57,971 --> 01:00:03,846
When Park became a cop,
he joined your father’s team.

792
01:00:05,513 --> 01:00:06,930
Like a foster son.

793
01:00:09,721 --> 01:00:12,055
As promised...

794
01:00:14,263 --> 01:00:15,388
your father’s record.

795
01:00:28,888 --> 01:00:31,263
Sgt. Choi Dong-su
Investigation Report

796
01:00:34,471 --> 01:00:37,596
Joined Yeonnam, a Private
Organization Within the Police

797
01:00:39,888 --> 01:00:42,638
Superintendent Seo Joong-ho

798
01:00:46,888 --> 01:00:48,055
It was your father’s.

799
01:00:49,763 --> 01:00:51,555
Ever heard of Yeonnam?

800
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:55,805
What is that?

801
01:00:56,221 --> 01:00:59,513
It started when Yeonnam district
was established in Western Seoul.

802
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:04,346
There was a time when cops
took donations to investigate.

803
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,263
They didn’t even have
gas money to do their jobs.

804
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:10,596
Police agency was shit poor.

805
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,805
When they had to travel
without any money,

806
01:01:17,846 --> 01:01:20,346
they were still expected
to perform.

807
01:01:20,596 --> 01:01:22,971
Some cops gave up
and let criminals go,

808
01:01:24,096 --> 01:01:27,346
while others spent their
own money to investigate.

809
01:01:30,471 --> 01:01:33,013
That’s how Yeonnam got started.

810
01:01:34,013 --> 01:01:37,096
They gathered sponsors,
donations and managed them,

811
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,263
it became an organization
operating in secrecy.

812
01:01:40,888 --> 01:01:42,638
In other words, it’s illegal.

813
01:01:42,638 --> 01:01:46,596
At first their work produced
results and praises.

814
01:01:47,388 --> 01:01:50,096
But still water is bound to rot.

815
01:01:50,096 --> 01:01:53,055
The donation pooled
to be spent on investigation

816
01:01:53,055 --> 01:01:57,096
became allowances
and slush funds,

817
01:01:57,471 --> 01:02:00,805
and they took bribes for
going easy on syndicates.

818
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,055
Stop it!

819
01:02:07,263 --> 01:02:11,513
Later, it became hard to
discern cops from criminals.

820
01:02:13,471 --> 01:02:17,013
Your father and Park
were prime examples.

821
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,096
In other words,
he created Park.

822
01:02:20,846 --> 01:02:23,888
Breaking laws and acting
without oversight,

823
01:02:24,221 --> 01:02:26,180
he learned them all
from your father.

824
01:02:26,513 --> 01:02:27,638
That can’t be.

825
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,471
I hear your father
became a junkie too.

826
01:02:31,055 --> 01:02:32,096
Dad!

827
01:02:33,305 --> 01:02:35,263
- Dad!
- No!

828
01:02:35,305 --> 01:02:36,471
Dad!

829
01:02:42,138 --> 01:02:43,263
So many needle marks...

830
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,888
I’m sorry to say, it’s true.

831
01:02:47,888 --> 01:02:50,763
Undercover methods back then
were very primitive.

832
01:02:52,721 --> 01:02:56,638
The best cover was to
become an addict himself.

833
01:02:57,263 --> 01:03:00,138
His killer was a Yeonnam affiliate,

834
01:03:00,138 --> 01:03:01,930
until he became an addict.

835
01:03:02,013 --> 01:03:05,388
If your father wasn’t murdered,
he’d have shared the same fate.

836
01:03:05,805 --> 01:03:11,096
With enough support,
they want absolute obedience.

837
01:03:12,471 --> 01:03:15,388
Before the media got
ahold of this story,

838
01:03:16,138 --> 01:03:18,638
Yeonnam was covered up internally.

839
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:22,555
Then someone lit the fire
on Yeonnam again.

840
01:03:23,263 --> 01:03:27,180
Park was the fire starter.

841
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:33,805
Is that why you sent me?

842
01:03:34,305 --> 01:03:36,638
You calculated that
Park’d take me in

843
01:03:37,888 --> 01:03:40,138
because I’m Choi Dong-su’s son?

844
01:03:40,138 --> 01:03:44,805
Without digging into the soil,
one can’t uproot the weed.

845
01:03:46,096 --> 01:03:49,721
I’m done with this,
do what you will.

846
01:03:49,721 --> 01:03:52,221
Who do you think led
your father to his demise?

847
01:03:53,555 --> 01:03:54,638
It’s Yeonnam.

848
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,346
Park is ripe for picking.

849
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:02,180
Na is no easy foe,

850
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:05,055
and the sponsorship alone
can’t lead to his arrest.

851
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,055
Next step is obvious.

852
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:11,471
Cha is his ace in the hole,
and he will use it soon.

853
01:04:16,013 --> 01:04:17,055
Think carefully.

854
01:04:18,013 --> 01:04:20,471
This is our last chance
to right the wrong.

855
01:04:22,846 --> 01:04:27,638
Choi Min-jae, you’re a cop,
don’t forget that.

856
01:04:28,638 --> 01:04:31,888
Prove that you’re
not like your father.

857
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:46,805
Get over here at once,
starting stakeout

858
01:05:02,013 --> 01:05:03,638
Yeah, I understand.

859
01:05:12,263 --> 01:05:14,680
Got it, good work.

860
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:26,680
Please!

861
01:05:28,346 --> 01:05:30,471
I’ll pay you back
within this month!

862
01:05:30,471 --> 01:05:33,846
If you got money to burn,
you gotta pay me back first.

863
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:37,013
If you spurge on everything,

864
01:05:38,096 --> 01:05:39,138
when will you pay back?

865
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:43,305
You still managed to send
kids overseas to study.

866
01:05:45,805 --> 01:05:46,763
Them, right?

867
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:57,096
No, not that,
please, I can’t!

868
01:05:57,388 --> 01:05:58,471
I really can’t!

869
01:05:58,471 --> 01:06:00,013
Please, don’t do this!

870
01:06:05,096 --> 01:06:06,388
Will you look at that...

871
01:06:11,388 --> 01:06:13,930
You made 2 calls
to Na each time.

872
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:16,263
Is it against the law
to call him?

873
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:17,430
Of course not.

874
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:19,930
Then why are you
doing this?

875
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:23,096
You have an illegal loan
business at gambling dens,

876
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:26,471
and opened up shops
to sell drugs to youths,

877
01:06:26,638 --> 01:06:30,513
and facilitated sex trade,
those are illegal though.

878
01:06:30,513 --> 01:06:32,805
This is abuse of
police authority!

879
01:06:32,805 --> 01:06:34,346
Filthy piece of shit.

880
01:06:34,346 --> 01:06:36,221
Did you bring a warrant?
You didn’t?

881
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:37,138
Listen up.

882
01:06:37,138 --> 01:06:40,430
You said Na started a venture,
what exactly is that?

883
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:41,930
What? What are you
talking about?

884
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:44,680
- What the hell?!
- Hold on, asshole.

885
01:06:45,513 --> 01:06:47,555
Hold still, you son of a bitch!

886
01:06:49,096 --> 01:06:51,013
If you move,
you’ll lose your chin.

887
01:06:51,638 --> 01:06:53,138
Can’t you let me
in on the secret?

888
01:06:54,305 --> 01:06:56,055
Stay the fuck back.

889
01:07:00,555 --> 01:07:01,638
That’s enough, chief.

890
01:07:05,763 --> 01:07:07,680
If you get in my way,

891
01:07:08,305 --> 01:07:11,263
it means you can die
by my hands, got that?

892
01:07:19,388 --> 01:07:21,971
Yes, venture! You’re so right!

893
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:24,221
He’s starting a venture!
Let me tell you about it!

894
01:07:24,221 --> 01:07:25,555
He’s producing drugs!

895
01:07:25,555 --> 01:07:26,555
- Producing drugs?
- Drugs!

896
01:07:26,555 --> 01:07:27,513
- Here?!
- In Ansan!

897
01:07:27,513 --> 01:07:29,305
- You sure?!
- I’m sure!

898
01:07:30,221 --> 01:07:31,680
Chief, it sounds legit.

899
01:07:47,805 --> 01:07:48,930
What happened was,

900
01:07:50,221 --> 01:07:53,388
I attended Na’s investor meeting.

901
01:07:53,555 --> 01:07:56,013
What he said was fantastic.

902
01:07:56,013 --> 01:07:57,513
It was a sexy proposition.

903
01:07:57,805 --> 01:07:59,138
You may all know already,

904
01:07:59,138 --> 01:08:02,596
you’ll take home
as much as you put in.

905
01:08:03,305 --> 01:08:05,680
Whether intentional or not,
if you leak anything,

906
01:08:05,971 --> 01:08:08,388
you and your family
will be in great danger.

907
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:10,763
All right.

908
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,013
Let’s start with samples.

909
01:08:15,763 --> 01:08:18,471
The ingredients have been approved.

910
01:08:18,471 --> 01:08:21,971
When they mix with
caffeine in coffee,

911
01:08:23,638 --> 01:08:27,138
that’s when you get high,
it’s revolutionary.

912
01:08:27,138 --> 01:08:30,430
Na bought the rights
to the mixing technique.

913
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:35,055
To regulate this psychotropic drug,
it’ll take at least 3 years.

914
01:08:35,055 --> 01:08:35,846
Why?

915
01:08:37,388 --> 01:08:41,055
It’s hard to tell whether
this powder alone is a drug.

916
01:08:41,055 --> 01:08:43,013
When mixed with coffee,
there’s no odor at all.

917
01:08:43,013 --> 01:08:45,805
That’s why he disguised it
as a coffee roaster.

918
01:08:46,346 --> 01:08:48,971
It’s the perfect front.

919
01:08:49,555 --> 01:08:50,805
If it’s distributed all over,

920
01:08:51,096 --> 01:08:55,596
kids get high while
drinking coffee and hanging out.

921
01:08:55,596 --> 01:08:57,305
Getting a warrant
is impossible.

922
01:08:57,846 --> 01:08:59,846
It’s legal in a constitutional country.

923
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:05,221
Detective, I’ll stitch you up
in no time.

924
01:09:05,221 --> 01:09:08,013
Yong, you’ll have to help us.

925
01:09:08,305 --> 01:09:11,763
You’re a funny guy,
you want me to die?

926
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:15,555
Or rot away for 5 years.

927
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,763
You can’t handle the cover.

928
01:09:30,555 --> 01:09:31,430
How much?

929
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:32,596
$2 million is my cut.

930
01:09:32,596 --> 01:09:35,888
It’s not much compared to others,
but I got off the bandwagon.

931
01:09:36,388 --> 01:09:38,305
I got no cash to spare.

932
01:09:38,305 --> 01:09:41,221
So? Will you front the cover?

933
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,430
Yes.

934
01:10:06,888 --> 01:10:08,138
Dad.

935
01:10:15,721 --> 01:10:17,430
Just don’t become a cop.

936
01:10:53,471 --> 01:10:54,221
What, man?

937
01:10:54,221 --> 01:10:56,680
Shit, you’re so childish...

938
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,346
There are other ways
to catch a mole.

939
01:11:03,221 --> 01:11:04,096
Goddammit...

940
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:05,055
So what then?

941
01:11:05,055 --> 01:11:06,888
- Drop the case.
- What?

942
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,513
Wait, sir!

943
01:11:13,288 --> 01:11:14,580
Authorized Personnel Only

944
01:11:14,663 --> 01:11:16,371
What can you do with
a rejected warrant?

945
01:11:16,371 --> 01:11:17,288
Who’s blocking this?

946
01:11:17,288 --> 01:11:18,496
What are you implying?

947
01:11:18,663 --> 01:11:21,330
You got no evidence,
it’s all based on a testimony.

948
01:11:22,205 --> 01:11:24,038
It’d be strange
if a warrant was issued.

949
01:11:24,038 --> 01:11:27,246
So who’s the one
blocking this warrant?

950
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:28,330
Jesus...

951
01:11:30,246 --> 01:11:35,121
All right, then submit a report
on how you got this intel.

952
01:11:38,955 --> 01:11:40,330
We got a lead...

953
01:11:42,955 --> 01:11:46,996
about passport counterfeiters
leaving for the Philippines.

954
01:11:47,663 --> 01:11:51,246
Why don’t you take on this case?
We got a quota to fill.

955
01:11:52,121 --> 01:11:55,121
Let’s get the counterfeiters first.

956
01:12:00,288 --> 01:12:01,288
Mole

957
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:15,830
Head to Namsan.

958
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:24,121
It’ll be tough this time.

959
01:12:24,371 --> 01:12:26,080
Is something wrong?

960
01:12:26,538 --> 01:12:27,705
We received an order.

961
01:12:29,371 --> 01:12:31,830
Can’t I get a partial funding?

962
01:12:32,038 --> 01:12:34,538
It’s not about the money,
but a problem of will.

963
01:12:36,288 --> 01:12:37,705
Just like rejecting the warrant?

964
01:12:37,955 --> 01:12:39,330
That’s the situation we’re in.

965
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:43,788
Is it because of
Chairman Kim’s son?

966
01:12:44,496 --> 01:12:48,246
All households have
a problematic child.

967
01:12:48,621 --> 01:12:50,788
No amount of scolding
will do the trick.

968
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:53,413
With some time,
he’ll pull out.

969
01:12:53,621 --> 01:12:55,955
But it’ll stir trouble
if you ambush them now.

970
01:12:57,913 --> 01:13:00,413
Look the other way on this,
you got bigger things to do.

971
01:13:00,621 --> 01:13:01,288
No.

972
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:05,121
A new type of drug could
flood the country in no time.

973
01:13:05,621 --> 01:13:08,538
If they hit hard and pull out,
there won’t be a next time.

974
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:09,788
Park Kang-yoon.

975
01:13:10,871 --> 01:13:12,955
You’re being dramatic.

976
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:15,038
The decision has been made.

977
01:13:15,663 --> 01:13:19,580
Chairman Kim is Yeonnam’s
biggest supporter.

978
01:13:25,496 --> 01:13:27,080
Cheongdam furniture shop.

979
01:13:27,913 --> 01:13:30,496
- To Kwon’s office?
- Yeah.

980
01:13:31,663 --> 01:13:32,871
For operation fund?

981
01:13:33,038 --> 01:13:34,913
I’ll use it to get in,
then return it.

982
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:37,371
By winning the speed boat race?

983
01:13:39,413 --> 01:13:40,663
I can do far worse.

984
01:13:41,788 --> 01:13:42,330
Drive.

985
01:13:49,121 --> 01:13:51,705
Yo, where’s Kwon?

986
01:13:52,288 --> 01:13:53,705
He’s abroad.

987
01:13:53,871 --> 01:13:55,038
He took off running?

988
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:57,330
No, he travels abroad regularly...

989
01:13:57,621 --> 01:13:58,246
You laugh?

990
01:13:58,955 --> 01:14:00,746
Did you just laugh? Huh?

991
01:14:12,538 --> 01:14:14,330
Are we some kind of thugs!

992
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:15,913
Is Cha the only option left?

993
01:14:16,913 --> 01:14:17,830
Watch your mouth.

994
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,663
What about Yeonnam?
They won’t back you?

995
01:14:22,663 --> 01:14:25,705
Yeonnam? Is that
what Hwang fed you?

996
01:14:26,413 --> 01:14:27,538
Come on, chief.

997
01:14:28,538 --> 01:14:31,246
One must find a rightful option,

998
01:14:31,246 --> 01:14:32,913
why must you resort
to an illegal option?

999
01:14:34,496 --> 01:14:36,746
Can we do our jobs without
getting our hands dirty?

1000
01:14:37,205 --> 01:14:41,455
Are you saying nothing is illegal
when going after criminals?

1001
01:14:41,455 --> 01:14:44,496
What exactly is the call
of the police you speak of?

1002
01:14:46,121 --> 01:14:46,955
Listen up.

1003
01:14:47,246 --> 01:14:51,996
Us cops are always
standing over the boundary.

1004
01:14:52,371 --> 01:14:55,455
We can’t be black nor white.

1005
01:14:55,955 --> 01:14:57,830
- Is that even possible?!
- It is!

1006
01:14:58,038 --> 01:15:00,038
So long as people
support our work,

1007
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:03,121
we can stand above the gray zone.

1008
01:15:03,371 --> 01:15:07,580
At times, they will push us
towards the black.

1009
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:08,788
That’s being a cop.

1010
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:12,871
If you can’t do that,
just quit.

1011
01:15:17,855 --> 01:15:18,771
That’s just it!

1012
01:15:20,063 --> 01:15:25,438
This is precisely why my father
didn’t want me to be a cop!

1013
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:28,938
Yeah? That’s weird.

1014
01:15:29,855 --> 01:15:33,438
He suggested that
I become one.

1015
01:15:34,646 --> 01:15:36,938
A cop who could
move the world.

1016
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:57,271
So Na is finally going down.

1017
01:15:58,021 --> 01:15:59,146
Damn.

1018
01:16:00,313 --> 01:16:02,938
I couldn’t even shit properly
because of that bastard.

1019
01:16:03,605 --> 01:16:04,646
A few days ago,

1020
01:16:04,855 --> 01:16:09,021
my fortuneteller said
I’ll live a long life.

1021
01:16:09,438 --> 01:16:10,980
That’s fine and all,

1022
01:16:11,771 --> 01:16:14,896
but he said I’ll outlive Na.

1023
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,021
So I asked him
how he knew that.

1024
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:20,438
He said he saw Na’s fortune too.

1025
01:16:22,146 --> 01:16:23,105
Fucking hell.

1026
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:25,938
What do you think I did?

1027
01:16:26,355 --> 01:16:27,313
What did you do?

1028
01:16:28,188 --> 01:16:29,730
I buried him!

1029
01:16:30,271 --> 01:16:34,896
What are the chances of him
seeing both me and Na?

1030
01:16:35,188 --> 01:16:40,313
I got the chills and thought
maybe he was trying to bury me.

1031
01:16:40,313 --> 01:16:41,688
Have you forgotten, asshole?

1032
01:16:42,771 --> 01:16:44,021
I’m a cop.

1033
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:50,688
Why?

1034
01:16:53,188 --> 01:16:54,480
Gonna lock me up?

1035
01:16:55,896 --> 01:16:56,896
Go ahead.

1036
01:16:57,855 --> 01:17:02,271
I’ll have to get your loan back
from jail then, bro.

1037
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,063
Don’t call me that.

1038
01:17:05,188 --> 01:17:05,896
Bring it.

1039
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:18,855
I put a GPS tracker
on the bottom of the bag.

1040
01:17:37,896 --> 01:17:40,355
Choi, come with me.

1041
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:48,646
Give this to him.

1042
01:17:55,938 --> 01:18:00,105
Fine, after this job,
leave my unit.

1043
01:18:01,938 --> 01:18:04,230
Go back to your team, good?

1044
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,355
Oh my.

1045
01:18:31,813 --> 01:18:34,855
Good job putting together
$2 million.

1046
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:44,063
Protect that money.

1047
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:48,896
If we don’t recover this,
we’re all dead.

1048
01:19:14,021 --> 01:19:15,646
The rabbit is going in.

1049
01:19:15,813 --> 01:19:17,521
Copy, standing by.

1050
01:19:23,355 --> 01:19:24,480
Choi Min-jae.

1051
01:19:25,355 --> 01:19:27,021
I expect big things.

1052
01:19:40,146 --> 01:19:41,896
I had some money stashed away!

1053
01:19:41,896 --> 01:19:43,605
Perfect timing, huh?

1054
01:19:44,855 --> 01:19:45,771
$2 million!

1055
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:50,063
Out?

1056
01:19:58,688 --> 01:20:00,271
Safe, just barely.

1057
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:02,188
Safe!

1058
01:20:03,605 --> 01:20:04,563
Safe...

1059
01:20:27,021 --> 01:20:28,938
The rabbit is inside.

1060
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:38,521
I’ll now activate the machine.

1061
01:21:21,313 --> 01:21:23,938
Raising both of your hands
will be our signal.

1062
01:21:23,938 --> 01:21:28,813
Signal us only after
the final product is out.

1063
01:21:28,813 --> 01:21:30,105
No mistakes.

1064
01:21:35,521 --> 01:21:37,480
Boss, cops are here!

1065
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:44,521
Park Kang-yoon, that asshole...

1066
01:21:45,688 --> 01:21:47,355
Turn the machine off.

1067
01:21:47,521 --> 01:21:48,271
Pardon?

1068
01:21:49,563 --> 01:21:50,563
Turn it off.

1069
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:51,896
Yes, right away.

1070
01:21:58,313 --> 01:21:59,980
Attention please.

1071
01:22:00,563 --> 01:22:01,688
It’s the police.

1072
01:22:03,105 --> 01:22:05,021
Easy, don’t worry.

1073
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:09,730
You’ll now witness
your top dollars at work.

1074
01:22:10,605 --> 01:22:14,396
They’re simply imported
coffee ingredients, right?

1075
01:22:14,688 --> 01:22:16,063
- Yes.
- That’s right.

1076
01:22:16,438 --> 01:22:18,730
Cops don’t have a warrant.

1077
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:21,021
No evidence either, right?

1078
01:22:21,563 --> 01:22:23,313
But why is the police coming?

1079
01:22:36,355 --> 01:22:38,105
All units, we got the signal.

1080
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,896
Move in, move in!

1081
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:40,730
Go.

1082
01:23:07,188 --> 01:23:08,105
Son of a...

1083
01:23:10,105 --> 01:23:10,813
Bring him.

1084
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:13,855
Come on, Mr. Na!

1085
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:15,188
Can’t I adjust my hair?!

1086
01:23:16,146 --> 01:23:17,313
Don’t move!

1087
01:23:17,313 --> 01:23:18,771
Everyone freeze!

1088
01:23:18,771 --> 01:23:19,813
Stay where you are!

1089
01:23:28,438 --> 01:23:30,146
Get back in! Now!

1090
01:23:30,146 --> 01:23:32,105
Don’t move!
Against the wall!

1091
01:23:32,396 --> 01:23:33,938
Stand against the wall!

1092
01:23:36,063 --> 01:23:37,688
Show me your warrant.

1093
01:23:37,688 --> 01:23:38,605
Na Young-bin,

1094
01:23:38,605 --> 01:23:41,105
you’re under arrest for
production of an illegal substance.

1095
01:23:41,105 --> 01:23:44,230
What illegal substance?
This isn’t drug...

1096
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:45,021
Det. Ahn.

1097
01:23:51,521 --> 01:23:53,896
Chief, nothing came out yet.

1098
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,505
Switch it on.

1099
01:23:56,671 --> 01:23:57,296
Yes, sir.

1100
01:23:58,588 --> 01:24:00,380
It’s got a passcode lock.

1101
01:24:00,505 --> 01:24:02,171
Where’s the code generator?

1102
01:24:03,588 --> 01:24:04,963
Who knows...

1103
01:24:06,463 --> 01:24:07,505
Where the hell is it?

1104
01:24:09,046 --> 01:24:09,880
You son of a bitch.

1105
01:24:10,088 --> 01:24:10,963
Don’t move!

1106
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,880
I swallowed it, asshole!

1107
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,380
Do Not Enter

1108
01:24:34,046 --> 01:24:37,421
Wait till I shit it out tomorrow!

1109
01:25:06,588 --> 01:25:08,046
Get back! Don’t move!

1110
01:25:08,921 --> 01:25:10,046
- Det. Ahn.
- Yes, sir.

1111
01:25:17,171 --> 01:25:18,421
Who are you?

1112
01:25:18,421 --> 01:25:19,463
Stab him!

1113
01:25:21,213 --> 01:25:23,380
That bastard saw my face,
stab him!

1114
01:26:04,713 --> 01:26:06,713
Chief Park

1115
01:26:28,213 --> 01:26:30,046
- Arrest him.
- Yes, sir.

1116
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:34,338
Buddy.

1117
01:26:35,588 --> 01:26:38,755
You made that yourself,
don’t forget.

1118
01:26:42,005 --> 01:26:43,088
Come on out.

1119
01:26:43,088 --> 01:26:44,380
See you again.

1120
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:46,296
Get over here.

1121
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:08,296
Chief,

1122
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:09,921
I don’t see Min-jae.

1123
01:27:10,963 --> 01:27:12,463
The entry was chaotic...

1124
01:27:56,796 --> 01:27:58,671
Hey, Choi Min-jae!

1125
01:27:59,171 --> 01:28:00,088
Min-jae!

1126
01:28:02,421 --> 01:28:03,296
You okay?

1127
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,088
Are you all right?
Get up!

1128
01:28:06,630 --> 01:28:08,546
He’s conscious,
get the EMT!

1129
01:28:08,755 --> 01:28:09,421
Yes, sir!

1130
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:14,088
Lee Myung-ju... Lee...

1131
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:16,255
- Ear...
- What?

1132
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:17,463
Chief!

1133
01:28:18,463 --> 01:28:19,088
Sir...

1134
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:22,046
The rabbit is gone.

1135
01:28:36,838 --> 01:28:40,421
A drug producer disguising
narcotics as coffee was arrested.

1136
01:28:40,755 --> 01:28:44,088
Over $100 million in cash
was found on the scene,

1137
01:28:44,088 --> 01:28:46,880
and the police is focusing
on the source of this money.

1138
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:48,921
Drug Org’s Connection to
Daeho Group Heir

1139
01:28:54,088 --> 01:28:56,713
I told Park not to stir trouble.

1140
01:28:56,796 --> 01:28:58,630
He wasted our business funding.

1141
01:28:59,255 --> 01:29:02,880
It’s likely he took money
from the Yakuza.

1142
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:07,130
The Internal Affairs is digging
into us due to this incident.

1143
01:29:08,046 --> 01:29:09,421
Park Kang-yoon...

1144
01:29:09,838 --> 01:29:12,005
I don’t know how to thank you.

1145
01:29:12,005 --> 01:29:13,213
Not at all, sir.

1146
01:29:13,213 --> 01:29:16,213
We should’ve paid
more attention, my apologies.

1147
01:29:17,963 --> 01:29:21,671
Since this case is related
to the death of an officer,

1148
01:29:21,671 --> 01:29:24,088
the Internal Affairs is
keeping eyes on it.

1149
01:29:24,588 --> 01:29:26,838
Chairman, I’m sorry
to bring this up but...

1150
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:30,963
I was thinking of sending him
to Europe somewhere...

1151
01:29:30,963 --> 01:29:34,796
Yes, I’ll make arrangements.

1152
01:29:39,796 --> 01:29:42,130
It’s time to dump Park.

1153
01:29:47,671 --> 01:29:49,588
Cha

1154
01:29:55,005 --> 01:29:55,421
Yes?

1155
01:29:55,421 --> 01:29:57,671
Yo, bro! Come by!

1156
01:29:58,130 --> 01:30:00,463
We gotta celebrate
Na’s grand exit!

1157
01:30:00,463 --> 01:30:02,880
I told you not to call me that.

1158
01:30:03,088 --> 01:30:05,046
It’s a cause for celebration.

1159
01:30:05,921 --> 01:30:07,463
Is it because of
the runaway money?

1160
01:30:08,838 --> 01:30:12,380
Yakuza is already talking
about gutting you,

1161
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:15,421
I’m barely holding them back.

1162
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:20,671
Bro, I got a proposition
that’ll wipe away your debt.

1163
01:30:21,005 --> 01:30:23,088
You won’t be able to refuse.

1164
01:30:34,030 --> 01:30:35,446
I heard you’re getting a medal.

1165
01:30:36,655 --> 01:30:37,780
You’re a made man.

1166
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:39,488
Hardly.

1167
01:30:40,446 --> 01:30:43,280
This is what you asked for.

1168
01:30:48,113 --> 01:30:51,071
The knife wielder who was
charged with Sgt. Lee’s murder.

1169
01:30:55,488 --> 01:31:02,238
He had a scar when I arrested him,
but not in the photo.

1170
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:08,863
The fucker who stabbed me
also that the scar.

1171
01:31:08,863 --> 01:31:10,821
And Sgt. Lee’s killer,

1172
01:31:10,821 --> 01:31:13,988
Chief Park caught him himself.

1173
01:31:14,238 --> 01:31:15,738
That’s more suspicious.

1174
01:31:16,696 --> 01:31:18,071
For operation fund?

1175
01:31:19,613 --> 01:31:20,905
I can do far worse.

1176
01:31:20,905 --> 01:31:22,446
If you get in my way,

1177
01:31:23,488 --> 01:31:25,821
it means you can die
by my hands, got that?

1178
01:31:27,571 --> 01:31:30,155
Hey, what are you doing?

1179
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:32,988
Where will you go?

1180
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:51,655
Yes?

1181
01:31:51,946 --> 01:31:54,696
Tick, tock, time’s running out.

1182
01:31:55,655 --> 01:31:56,488
I know.

1183
01:31:56,488 --> 01:32:01,405
I thought you couldn’t come out
because of a rat outside your place.

1184
01:32:01,530 --> 01:32:02,363
Who?

1185
01:32:02,655 --> 01:32:07,655
The kid you hung out with,
he’s guarding the door.

1186
01:32:27,696 --> 01:32:30,071
You should’ve called ahead.

1187
01:32:32,155 --> 01:32:33,780
How are you feeling?

1188
01:32:34,446 --> 01:32:35,321
Fine, sir.

1189
01:32:37,321 --> 01:32:38,488
That’s good.

1190
01:32:40,238 --> 01:32:44,238
The guy who stabbed me
at the factory...

1191
01:32:44,863 --> 01:32:46,321
had a scar on his earlobe.

1192
01:32:51,446 --> 01:32:55,405
And this is the perp we caught
at Na’s gambling joint.

1193
01:32:56,863 --> 01:32:58,863
This was taken only a month ago.

1194
01:32:58,988 --> 01:33:00,738
He doesn’t have the earlobe scar.

1195
01:33:01,738 --> 01:33:03,030
And he’s in final stage of cancer.

1196
01:33:03,863 --> 01:33:06,946
He recently received
a large deposit to his account.

1197
01:33:08,405 --> 01:33:09,280
So?

1198
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:12,405
Sgt. Lee Myung-ju...

1199
01:33:14,571 --> 01:33:15,946
You killed him.

1200
01:33:17,655 --> 01:33:19,738
And to cover up the murder,

1201
01:33:19,988 --> 01:33:22,946
you created a fake,
and arrested him.

1202
01:33:26,405 --> 01:33:27,280
No?

1203
01:33:30,405 --> 01:33:32,446
If I tell you,
will you believe me?

1204
01:33:32,571 --> 01:33:36,071
What about the $2 million
you took from Cha?

1205
01:33:36,363 --> 01:33:38,071
I saw you taking it at the port.

1206
01:33:39,571 --> 01:33:41,155
That’s my debt to repay.

1207
01:33:41,155 --> 01:33:43,196
So how exactly will you do that?!

1208
01:33:43,196 --> 01:33:44,238
If you cannot pay back,

1209
01:33:45,905 --> 01:33:47,988
you do it with your life.

1210
01:33:47,988 --> 01:33:49,946
You sure you weren’t
in bed with Cha?

1211
01:33:50,113 --> 01:33:52,946
Are you bugged?

1212
01:33:53,613 --> 01:33:54,571
Hold still!

1213
01:34:04,821 --> 01:34:05,655
Go home.

1214
01:34:09,071 --> 01:34:14,821
You took out Na for Cha
to take over the turf, no?

1215
01:34:17,238 --> 01:34:18,405
Choi Min-jae.

1216
01:34:18,738 --> 01:34:20,905
Learn how to see
the world properly first.

1217
01:34:21,196 --> 01:34:26,030
No one in my unit joined me
to stuff their pockets.

1218
01:34:26,155 --> 01:34:30,238
No, speak for yourself!

1219
01:34:31,821 --> 01:34:33,946
A cop must stand
above the gray zone?

1220
01:34:34,113 --> 01:34:36,946
You’ve already fallen
in the black muddy water.

1221
01:34:37,738 --> 01:34:41,655
The world will not
stand with you this time.

1222
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:45,446
Okay, I’m the evil.

1223
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:53,530
But I will lock up those
who are worse than me,

1224
01:34:54,238 --> 01:34:56,196
only then I’ll quit this,

1225
01:34:56,613 --> 01:35:02,363
so mind your own business.

1226
01:35:03,305 --> 01:35:04,221
Got that?

1227
01:35:05,346 --> 01:35:09,180
No, you won’t be able to.

1228
01:35:11,388 --> 01:35:14,971
I’m going to stop you.

1229
01:35:30,346 --> 01:35:33,430
Don’t resent me,
you started this.

1230
01:35:58,138 --> 01:35:59,013
Who’s that?

1231
01:36:02,305 --> 01:36:02,971
Who are you?

1232
01:36:04,346 --> 01:36:05,846
Hey! Answer me!

1233
01:36:15,346 --> 01:36:16,346
Welcome!

1234
01:36:18,555 --> 01:36:21,596
A $2 million gig won’t be
a cake walk.

1235
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:26,888
Go to these coordinates,
pay the money and get the stuff.

1236
01:36:29,346 --> 01:36:31,888
Now that you confirmed it,
I’ll take your phone.

1237
01:36:35,221 --> 01:36:38,596
They’ll cut the power,
and contact you with this.

1238
01:36:38,846 --> 01:36:43,638
Thanks to your intel,
coast guards and narcos

1239
01:36:43,638 --> 01:36:46,055
won’t come near here.

1240
01:36:49,555 --> 01:36:51,346
I got a present for you there.

1241
01:36:55,055 --> 01:36:55,930
What are you doing?

1242
01:36:57,846 --> 01:36:59,388
You know what’s inside.

1243
01:37:03,263 --> 01:37:03,805
Hey!

1244
01:37:07,096 --> 01:37:07,596
Stop!

1245
01:37:08,805 --> 01:37:09,555
That’s enough!

1246
01:37:22,846 --> 01:37:24,596
Give me the key.

1247
01:37:24,763 --> 01:37:26,763
He’s probably not your
illegitimate son,

1248
01:37:26,763 --> 01:37:28,430
why are you protecting him?

1249
01:37:28,555 --> 01:37:31,430
It’s obvious he’s buying
his time to backstab you.

1250
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:33,013
I’m getting rid of him for you.

1251
01:37:33,013 --> 01:37:34,055
Give me the key!

1252
01:37:34,221 --> 01:37:35,471
What’s with you?

1253
01:37:35,471 --> 01:37:39,055
You’re in a bind because
you won’t clean up your shit...

1254
01:37:40,596 --> 01:37:41,305
Buddy.

1255
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,346
Bud.

1256
01:37:45,096 --> 01:37:46,513
You got shit for brain?

1257
01:37:48,471 --> 01:37:50,096
This is the west sea.

1258
01:37:51,138 --> 01:37:55,263
By morning with the tide gone,
everyone will see that car.

1259
01:37:55,263 --> 01:38:00,680
And a body is found in the trunk,
whom I beat up and put in.

1260
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:04,596
If I’m labelled a cop killer,
I won’t be able to work.

1261
01:38:05,805 --> 01:38:11,346
Maybe I’ll wrap it all up here.

1262
01:38:14,388 --> 01:38:16,263
Or pull him out.

1263
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:25,305
All right.

1264
01:38:26,346 --> 01:38:27,305
You’re a prickly one.

1265
01:38:43,971 --> 01:38:45,721
Look at that bastard!

1266
01:38:45,805 --> 01:38:47,096
Uh, bro?

1267
01:38:48,013 --> 01:38:49,346
This is what it comes to?

1268
01:38:49,888 --> 01:38:51,805
Delivering drugs to
pay back your debt?

1269
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:57,930
Chief, it’s not too late
to give this up.

1270
01:38:58,013 --> 01:38:59,888
Don’t be cute in front of me.

1271
01:39:04,013 --> 01:39:06,805
There’s so much money here,
how much are you bringing in?

1272
01:39:06,805 --> 01:39:09,013
If a police chief is delivering,

1273
01:39:09,013 --> 01:39:10,805
wouldn’t you try to
get as much as possible?

1274
01:39:21,055 --> 01:39:21,846
Choi Min-jae.

1275
01:39:24,138 --> 01:39:27,096
I’m giving this to you
so that you don’t get killed.

1276
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:32,430
Until I give you an order,
stay here like a ghost.

1277
01:39:32,721 --> 01:39:34,346
Got it? No matter what.

1278
01:39:49,638 --> 01:39:50,221
Chief.

1279
01:39:50,221 --> 01:39:53,721
I can’t be responsible
if you get yourself killed.

1280
01:39:53,971 --> 01:39:56,971
Remember, stay down,
got that?

1281
01:40:41,805 --> 01:40:42,596
Boss,

1282
01:40:43,263 --> 01:40:45,013
should we check the money first?

1283
01:40:45,805 --> 01:40:46,721
Hey.

1284
01:40:47,346 --> 01:40:48,680
Fucking pay me.

1285
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:43,763
Count properly.

1286
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:05,971
Police! Police!

1287
01:42:29,138 --> 01:42:31,055
Why isn’t that bastard
coming back?

1288
01:42:31,221 --> 01:42:32,930
Go check it out.

1289
01:42:33,888 --> 01:42:34,555
Yes, boss.

1290
01:43:17,513 --> 01:43:18,638
Chief!

1291
01:43:28,846 --> 01:43:30,263
Stop!

1292
01:43:42,846 --> 01:43:44,555
You fucking bastard!

1293
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:48,555
Nobody move!

1294
01:43:49,888 --> 01:43:51,680
Drop your weapons
and surrender!

1295
01:43:52,013 --> 01:43:53,596
This is the narcotics!

1296
01:43:55,013 --> 01:43:57,555
I say it again,
drop your weapons!

1297
01:44:01,930 --> 01:44:02,721
Where are you going?!

1298
01:44:03,555 --> 01:44:04,471
Goddammit!

1299
01:44:05,263 --> 01:44:06,638
What are you gonna
do with that?

1300
01:44:08,221 --> 01:44:09,471
You son of a bitch!

1301
01:44:13,805 --> 01:44:14,888
Dammit!

1302
01:44:14,888 --> 01:44:16,430
Get me Park Kang-yoon!

1303
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:18,138
Park! Get him down here!

1304
01:44:26,346 --> 01:44:27,721
Can I help you?

1305
01:44:37,596 --> 01:44:39,805
When we arrest Na,
slip out with the bag.

1306
01:44:40,013 --> 01:44:42,721
And lay low until I call you.

1307
01:44:44,830 --> 01:44:46,621
Chief Park Kang-yoon

1308
01:44:47,108 --> 01:44:50,871
asked me to drop
this off here at 11 PM.

1309
01:44:52,705 --> 01:44:55,038
$2 million, not a single bill missing.

1310
01:44:55,871 --> 01:44:58,621
It’s exactly 11 PM.

1311
01:45:04,121 --> 01:45:05,705
Park, that bastard...

1312
01:45:16,163 --> 01:45:19,288
Police! I’m a cop!

1313
01:45:20,455 --> 01:45:22,496
Chief, chief!

1314
01:45:24,205 --> 01:45:26,080
Over here!
Get me a stretcher!

1315
01:45:33,955 --> 01:45:36,288
Chief, is this fun?

1316
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:38,496
This is the sweetest moment.

1317
01:45:39,746 --> 01:45:41,455
I told you to stay down.

1318
01:45:42,121 --> 01:45:42,746
Chief!

1319
01:45:43,621 --> 01:45:44,413
Sir!

1320
01:45:46,205 --> 01:45:48,871
This kid’s not obedient,
go educate him properly.

1321
01:45:48,955 --> 01:45:50,246
All right, thanks.

1322
01:45:53,496 --> 01:45:55,038
- Take care of him.
- Yes, sir.

1323
01:45:55,455 --> 01:45:56,330
Who’s that?

1324
01:46:03,246 --> 01:46:05,121
Park Kang-yoon,
you’re under arrest.

1325
01:46:07,288 --> 01:46:09,080
There’s been some misunderstanding,

1326
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:13,538
we’re wrapping up another case,
and making arrests here.

1327
01:46:13,538 --> 01:46:15,121
I understand, do your thing.

1328
01:46:15,163 --> 01:46:16,455
On what charges?

1329
01:46:16,746 --> 01:46:19,871
For fabricating a suspect for
the death of Sgt. Lee Myung-ju.

1330
01:46:20,121 --> 01:46:22,288
Wait a minute, sir.

1331
01:46:22,705 --> 01:46:24,830
You can explain this, right?

1332
01:46:24,830 --> 01:46:26,121
Lt. Park Kang-yoon,

1333
01:46:26,955 --> 01:46:31,580
you’re under arrest for
evidence tampering among others.

1334
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:33,038
You have the right to
retain a lawyer,

1335
01:46:33,038 --> 01:46:35,621
blah blah blah,
you know the drill.

1336
01:46:37,705 --> 01:46:39,038
Got anything to say?

1337
01:46:42,188 --> 01:46:42,896
Take him away.

1338
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:45,313
Wait a minute! Stop!

1339
01:46:47,938 --> 01:46:48,855
Chief!

1340
01:46:50,146 --> 01:46:52,563
This doesn’t make any sense!

1341
01:46:52,938 --> 01:46:54,480
Chief!

1342
01:47:18,688 --> 01:47:22,646
Park was arrested for
suspect fabrication.

1343
01:47:22,938 --> 01:47:27,271
We switched Chairman Kim’s
slush fund account to his.

1344
01:47:27,521 --> 01:47:30,563
I made sure Internal Affairs
won’t dig in any further.

1345
01:47:34,063 --> 01:47:36,063
Did Chairman Kim’s son fly out?

1346
01:47:36,605 --> 01:47:37,230
Yes, sir.

1347
01:47:44,396 --> 01:47:47,355
It’s too bad about Park.

1348
01:47:54,855 --> 01:47:57,188
Visitation Request: Park Kang-yoon

1349
01:48:05,230 --> 01:48:06,063
Chief.

1350
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:16,438
I...

1351
01:48:19,521 --> 01:48:21,938
should have consulted you first...

1352
01:48:22,771 --> 01:48:23,521
It’s okay.

1353
01:48:24,521 --> 01:48:25,771
You were right to be suspicious.

1354
01:48:26,105 --> 01:48:28,396
You didn’t order
the suspect fabrication.

1355
01:48:28,688 --> 01:48:33,230
I didn’t but I’ll become
the fall guy for it.

1356
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:39,271
It’s my fault as well,
Na was too good of a prey.

1357
01:48:39,688 --> 01:48:40,980
That’s why I bit down.

1358
01:48:42,688 --> 01:48:43,980
You can’t always win.

1359
01:48:45,438 --> 01:48:46,480
You sometimes lose some.

1360
01:48:47,146 --> 01:48:49,646
And get backstabbed too.

1361
01:48:52,188 --> 01:48:53,855
I did more than enough.

1362
01:48:56,521 --> 01:48:57,896
No regrets either.

1363
01:49:02,688 --> 01:49:10,230
When I get out of here,
I’m done catching bad guys.

1364
01:49:11,646 --> 01:49:13,813
I’ll live my remaining days
fishing instead.

1365
01:49:15,271 --> 01:49:16,021
That’s good.

1366
01:49:17,605 --> 01:49:20,230
By the way,
about my boat,

1367
01:49:20,688 --> 01:49:22,688
I didn’t get to put it away
since I was rushed in here.

1368
01:49:22,688 --> 01:49:24,438
There was a storm recently.

1369
01:49:25,146 --> 01:49:27,813
Could you go check
if it’s doing okay?

1370
01:49:30,938 --> 01:49:31,813
Sure.

1371
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:57,063
Plants send a signal
before roots rot.

1372
01:49:58,188 --> 01:50:00,771
Leaf tips turn yellow like this,

1373
01:50:02,355 --> 01:50:04,063
or they shed leaves.

1374
01:50:05,105 --> 01:50:07,438
Park was tossed out like that.

1375
01:50:08,396 --> 01:50:13,021
You know that he didn’t do it.

1376
01:50:13,563 --> 01:50:14,771
That’s not important.

1377
01:50:15,063 --> 01:50:17,271
It’s about whether or not
the root is rotting.

1378
01:50:19,355 --> 01:50:24,230
It’s up to you to decide
how you determine it.

1379
01:50:30,730 --> 01:50:33,063
Sgt. Choi Dong-su
Investigation Report

1380
01:50:53,813 --> 01:50:55,980
Suspect Profile: Jeon Yong-bae

1381
01:51:05,271 --> 01:51:06,730
- A new addition?
- Yes.

1382
01:51:15,980 --> 01:51:16,855
Welcome.

1383
01:51:21,146 --> 01:51:23,980
Didn’t you come with
Chief Park some time ago?

1384
01:51:26,563 --> 01:51:30,146
I’m the son of Sgt. Choi Dong-su,
whom you killed.

1385
01:51:48,563 --> 01:51:52,730
It’s Jeon Yong-bae,
Choi Dong-su’s son will come by.

1386
01:51:54,688 --> 01:51:57,730
- You worked for Park?
- Yes, I did.

1387
01:51:58,271 --> 01:52:00,271
So? What’s this about?

1388
01:52:00,271 --> 01:52:00,896
I would...

1389
01:52:02,271 --> 01:52:03,980
like to meet the man on top.

1390
01:52:07,271 --> 01:52:09,188
What are you talking about?

1391
01:52:09,438 --> 01:52:14,771
He’ll surely come if it’s
about my father’s case.

1392
01:52:15,688 --> 01:52:20,063
If there’s no way from inside,
I’ll have to find a way from outside.

1393
01:52:21,646 --> 01:52:24,855
That’d ruffle a lot of feathers, no?

1394
01:52:25,855 --> 01:52:27,021
Is that a threat?

1395
01:52:27,730 --> 01:52:28,605
No, sir.

1396
01:53:08,063 --> 01:53:09,271
It’s been a while.

1397
01:53:10,355 --> 01:53:11,021
Yes, sir.

1398
01:53:11,605 --> 01:53:13,271
You asked for me?

1399
01:53:18,355 --> 01:53:19,355
What’s this?

1400
01:53:20,105 --> 01:53:23,563
It’s a report on my father Choi Dong-su,
and former officer and his murderer

1401
01:53:23,563 --> 01:53:24,855
Testimony of Jeon Yong-bae

1402
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:27,480
Jeon Yong-bae’s testimony.

1403
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:30,230
It details activities of
Yeonnam-sponsored officers,

1404
01:53:30,230 --> 01:53:34,688
and injustice suffered by
field officers from those activities.

1405
01:53:35,146 --> 01:53:38,230
There are other testimonies
and evidence as well.

1406
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,896
Testimony?

1407
01:53:42,105 --> 01:53:44,813
It’s still just hearsay.

1408
01:53:45,271 --> 01:53:48,355
You do not have any
irrefutable evidence.

1409
01:53:48,688 --> 01:53:51,313
It won’t get past arraignment.

1410
01:53:51,521 --> 01:53:53,896
Details of the report are
quite powerful,

1411
01:53:53,896 --> 01:53:57,688
and the media will latch on to it,
turning it into a scandal.

1412
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:02,563
Yeonnam sent Kim Jung-gyun
to Europe.

1413
01:54:03,230 --> 01:54:06,188
I’ve secured evidence that
he contracted a hit man,

1414
01:54:06,313 --> 01:54:08,813
and figured out
his escape route as well.

1415
01:54:11,855 --> 01:54:13,813
You wanted to ask for a favor.

1416
01:54:33,396 --> 01:54:34,563
You’ve grown up well.

1417
01:54:36,896 --> 01:54:39,521
You’re fiercer than your father.

1418
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:49,730
Siheung Penitentiary

1419
01:55:16,646 --> 01:55:17,313
Buddy!

1420
01:55:18,521 --> 01:55:19,730
What have you done?

1421
01:55:19,896 --> 01:55:20,938
I’m not sure.

1422
01:55:21,146 --> 01:55:22,938
Don’t you always go by the book?

1423
01:55:23,896 --> 01:55:24,563
Sure.

1424
01:55:25,813 --> 01:55:28,146
But I might do this

1425
01:55:28,688 --> 01:55:31,771
until I catch all the bad guys
worse than me.

1426
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:45,771
Boss.

1427
01:55:46,271 --> 01:55:48,021
Should we head to
Hapjeong district first?

1428
01:55:48,847 --> 01:55:51,263
A new drug from Thailand
flooded the market there.

1429
01:55:52,938 --> 01:55:54,480
Okay, Deputy Manager Choi.

1430
01:55:55,021 --> 01:55:56,771
- Drive.
