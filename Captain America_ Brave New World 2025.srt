1
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,500
Sir, one minute warning.

2
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,340
Congratulations again.

3
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,500
Heard anything from Betty,
from my daughter?

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,510
No, sir.
We tried her several times.

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,300
Okay.

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,410
Thank you.

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,330
All right, New Hampshire,

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,370
we are moments away.

9
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,500
Are you ready?

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,450
Ready for Ross!
Ready for Ross!

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,480
Ready for Ross!
Ready for Ross!

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,520
Ready for Ross!
Ready for Ross!

13
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,470
Ladies and gentlemen,

14
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,500
the next President of
the United States of America,

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,330
Thaddeus Ross!

16
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,470
Thank you.

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,390
Tonight, America has spoken

18
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:39,390
in one of the most important
elections of our lifetimes.

19
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,320
We've recognized the urgency
of this moment.

20
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,490
From the disappearance
of half of mankind

21
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,480
to the emergence
of a celestial mass

22
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,480
in the Indian Ocean,

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
the threats we face show
no signs of slowing down.

24
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,520
But the only way we can
overcome them is together!

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,310
Tonight, President Ross

26
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,500
embraced
the theme of togetherness

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,320
in his acceptance speech,

28
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,340
but his past
tells a different story,

29
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,410
especially when it comes to
working with heroes

30
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,510
like Captain America.

31
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,390
As two of our nation's
most important leaders,

32
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,400
some question
if they can overcome

33
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,510
their at-times
tumultuous history

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,470
to face the challenges ahead.

35
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,470
Here you go, Cap.

36
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,480
During his time as a...

37
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,280
Put your money away.
It's on the house.

38
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,390
Thanks, Charlie.

39
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,330
...leading to Ross

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,500
being branded with the moniker
of "the Hulk Hunter."

41
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,450
Following Hulk
and the Abomination's

42
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,520
destruction of Harlem,

43
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,370
Ross was criticized
for what some called

44
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,450
"an unwarranted outburst"
during a press conference.

45
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,360
In fact, many blamed Ross
for the collateral damage,

46
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,320
believing it was his
relentless pursuit

47
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,510
of Banner's Hulk
that led to the rampage.

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,320
It also resulted in
the President-elect's

49
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,460
estrangement from
his daughter,

50
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,360
Doctor Betty Ross,
Bruce Banner's ex-girlfriend.

51
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,510
But in a surprising turn
of events,

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
he managed to
shift the narrative,

53
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,400
and silence
his harshest critics

54
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,430
by apprehending
the man responsible

55
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,510
for the Abomination.

56
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,390
How we lookin' down there?

57
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,370
Well, SERPENT mercenaries

58
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,320
entered with a package
about an hour ago.

59
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,390
They're handing it
to the buyer any minute.

60
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,280
We know what they're carrying?

61
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,520
That is classified
per the White House.

62
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,400
Of course it is.

63
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,290
Where's Eagle-One?
We have strike authorization.

64
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,520
Eagle-One is entering
the target airspace now.

65
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,400
Upload the compound's
covert entry points.

66
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,320
Covert? Really?
You must be new.

67
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,490
Wait for it.

68
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,410
Sam, SEAL team
is six minutes out.

69
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,410
Copy that.

70
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,310
How the hell
did he just do that?

71
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,460
Cap's gear was a gift
from the Wakandans

72
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,460
for helping them out.

73
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,420
I heard even the wrapping
paper was made of vibranium.

74
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,400
No, man. I'm kidding. Come on.

75
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,290
Joaquin, Redwing's pickin' up
hostages inside.

76
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,460
-I'm goin' in.
-Negative.

77
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,500
The package is the priority.

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,430
Have
the SEALs track the package.

79
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,310
I'm on the hostages.

80
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,460
Redwing, send them a scan
of the building.

81
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,370
What is it?

82
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,400
That's Sidewinder.

83
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,390
He's the head of SERPENT.

84
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,340
He's not supposed to be here.

85
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,460
Ah.

86
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,500
You're praying, Padre.

87
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,520
Padre.

88
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,380
Padre. Padre, Padre, Padre.

89
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,470
Kill them.

90
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,310
- No. No!
- Kill them one at a time.

91
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,490
Silencio!

92
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,510
Captain America is here.

93
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,490
Do you copy?

94
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,450
Move, move, move!

95
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,300
Vámonos, vámonos.

96
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,470
Get the package outta here.

97
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,510
SERPENT's on the move
with the canister, Sam.

98
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,470
I'm kinda busy right now!

99
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,510
Redwing, on my mark.

100
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,310
Stop.

101
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,510
Stay back!
Or we'll shoot them.

102
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,300
SERPENT's gettin' farther away
with the canister, Sam,

103
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,460
and Sidewinder's
headed to the chapel.

104
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,390
I already know
what you're trying to do.

105
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,330
You can't be at two places
at once.

106
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,470
All right, this time.

107
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,300
But don't get yourself killed.

108
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,300
No dying. Copy that.

109
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,490
Buyer didn't show.

110
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,400
Looks like you need
better clients.

111
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,340
You don't need to worry.

112
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,400
I'll find whoever
wasted my time.

113
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,330
You have bigger concerns.

114
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,440
The Captain America
I dreamt of killing

115
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,460
was bigger than you.

116
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,410
I'm happy to disappoint.

117
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,460
I bet you break easy.

118
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,420
Not that easy.

119
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,420
Not that hard.

120
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,370
I heard your rib go.

121
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,360
You need a minute?

122
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,410
Nope. Nope,
let's get this over with.

123
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,390
I got shit to do today.

124
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,460
Whoo-hoo!

125
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,510
Damn.

126
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,380
Nobody saw that.

127
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,310
Sam, package is secured.

128
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,470
I'll add your star
to my collection.

129
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,410
Need a minute?

130
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,340
That's what I thought.

131
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,480
Save some for us, Cap.

132
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,510
He has a fractured arm,
so be gentle.

133
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,390
"Keep your face

134
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,280
always to the sunshine,

135
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,360
and the shadows
will fall behind you."

136
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,500
The quote was Betty's idea.

137
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,500
She's still not speaking
with you?

138
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
No.

139
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,360
She doesn't believe
I've changed.

140
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,370
Really changed.

141
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,450
I don't think I'm gonna get
another shot.

142
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,420
Comin' up on the end of
my first hundred days, Leila.

143
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,440
They're gonna define me.

144
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,360
This treaty's gotta work.

145
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,290
Hello.

146
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,320
Mr. President,
the mission was a success.

147
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,280
All right, fill me in.

148
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,460
Cap and the
SEAL team saved the hostages.

149
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,520
The package is secure
and en route to the US.

150
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,320
How's your brother?

151
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,480
Oh, wow, you remember.

152
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,400
-He's in the Air Force.
-Yeah.

153
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,290
Probably 'cause of you.

154
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,490
I try not to hold that
against him.

155
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,430
It's a weird place

156
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,300
-for a handoff, right?
-Mm-hmm.

157
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,280
Wide open, soft perimeter.

158
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,490
You think the buyer
ever intended on showin' up?

159
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,370
You think SERPENT got played?

160
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,390
What are they sayin'?

161
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,470
Same thing.
Contract was anonymous.

162
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,520
Fifty mil to steal the
canister en route to Japan.

163
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,460
Then show up here
and meet the buyer.

164
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,330
Hmm.

165
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,300
Let us know if you get a trace
on Sidewinder.

166
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,430
-Good work.
-Thank you.

167
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,500
You'll notice, I did not die,

168
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,280
and people are saying
I did not die in style.

169
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,320
Who is saying that?

170
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,490
-People.
-What people?

171
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,500
Everybody.

172
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,400
Everybody is saying that.

173
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,380
Look, tell me I don't make
your old gear look brand-new.

174
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,500
You've got on the greaves
upside down.

175
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,330
I'm joking.

176
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,470
You look good, man.

177
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,300
All right. Fair enough.

178
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,420
That means that
you're finally gonna

179
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,430
introduce me to Ant-Man?

180
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,480
Nope.

181
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,500
Well, at least
you gotta teach me

182
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,300
your aerial kick, man.

183
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,360
Look, if I'm gonna be Falcon,
I gotta know everything.

184
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,320
In no way
are you ready for that.

185
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,300
But I got a guy who'll
teach you the fundamentals

186
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,310
from the ground up

187
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,330
Absolutely.

188
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,320
Now, he's not a people person.

189
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,290
So you gotta learn
how to keep your mouth shut.

190
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,330
Can you do that?

191
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,380
He's gonna love me, bro!
Are you kidding me?

192
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,480
-That's not the right answer.
-He's gonna love me.

193
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
What's up, OG?

194
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,320
Who's the pretty boy?

195
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,520
"Pretty boy"? You didn't
tell gramps about me?

196
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,290
I'm the new Falcon.

197
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,470
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

198
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,440
This is Joaquin Torres.

199
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,390
Been workin' with him
for three years.

200
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,360
I haven't figured out
how to shut him up yet.

201
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,450
So what are we doing here?
Orthopedics? Uh...

202
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,470
How to relearn how to walk
after you break a hip?

203
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,310
Oh, sh--

204
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,310
Oh, shit.

205
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,430
That's Isaiah Bradley.

206
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,490
The-- The Isaiah Bradley?

207
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,280
You brought me to
the forgotten Cap?

208
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,300
Why didn't you say something?

209
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,310
It is a pleasure to meet you.

210
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,480
Your missions in Korea
are legendary.

211
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,370
And what, and after that,
no action?

212
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,480
I mean, a lot's changed
in the world.

213
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,340
We could've used
another super soldier.

214
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,420
The United States government

215
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,480
threw me in prison
for 30 years.

216
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,510
They experimented on me
for decades.

217
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,370
Yikes, that's-- that sucks.

218
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,440
Can we start?

219
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,420
Let's do it.

220
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,330
No vibranium wings,

221
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,400
no shield,
no super soldier serum.

222
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,390
I wanna see
if he's got three in him.

223
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,380
Get those flags, Sam!

224
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,460
Cap v Cap!

225
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
That's one.

226
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,320
Let's go!

227
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,300
Orthopedic.

228
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,520
That's two.

229
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,430
I'm sorry.
What were you sayin'?

230
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,290
See? Not a people person.

231
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,310
-In a fight, the last hit...
-Is the only hit that matters.

232
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,510
I know. Shut up, but thanks.

233
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,460
All right, that's it.
Tag me in. I'm ready.

234
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,360
Captain America doesn't
get to take five. Let's go.

235
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,480
I need to take this.

236
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,520
I'm not takin' five.

237
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,300
-You still got the plastic on.
-No! I don't...

238
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,380
Maybe I wanted it on there.

239
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,510
Oh, you want me
to make the text bigger?

240
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,430
So you can read it?

241
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,360
Yeah, I'll hold
for the President.

242
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,280
Where you going?

243
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,380
You wanna talk about it?

244
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,440
It just doesn't
sit right with me.

245
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,340
Captain America,
answering to the President.

246
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,500
The President of the country
who stole your life?

247
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,280
It's not just that.

248
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,500
We're talkin' about
Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross.

249
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,490
Son of a bitch
earned that nickname, too.

250
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,290
Look, I know, Isaiah,
firsthand.

251
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,430
Remember,
Ross threw me in the Raft.

252
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,380
Hounded me, Steve and Natasha
for years.

253
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,370
So why are you
workin' for him?

254
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,460
As long as you do,

255
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,520
Captain America
stands for people like him.

256
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,410
You've got no business
workin' for the government.

257
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,340
You see what's going on
out there?

258
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,480
The country is lost.

259
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,500
Standing next to
the President,

260
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,330
even if it's Ross...

261
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,480
it gives people hope.

262
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,410
Now, come on,
give me some credit.

263
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,420
I have a friend who works
in the White House.

264
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,400
She'll let me know if Ross
starts acting out of turn.

265
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,280
None of this means
I forgot about you.

266
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,440
I see what you're doin'.

267
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,310
What?

268
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,450
Pullin' that counseling
bullshit on me.

269
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,290
Look, trust me.

270
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,390
My eyes are wide open on
this, okay?

271
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,360
I know Ross will never change,

272
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,390
but he is the President.

273
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,490
So you gonna tell me
what he wanted

274
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,450
or are you plannin' on
makin' me guess?

275
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,460
He invited Joaquin and I
to the White House,

276
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,380
and I said
under one condition.

277
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,450
If he extended an invitation
to you as well.

278
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,370
I know you're gonna say no,

279
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,420
but it would mean a lot to me
if you were there.

280
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,480
We just...

281
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,340
gotta get you a suit.

282
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,510
I have a damn suit.

283
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,340
For real?

284
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,440
Then why are you
always wearin'

285
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,360
that ratty-ass sweatsuit?

286
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,300
Come on,
you gonna come or what?

287
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,320
See, Isaiah? This is
what I'm talking about.

288
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,500
Now you're going to
the White House. Look at that.

289
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,360
- You look good, OG.
- Wow, man. Damn.

290
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,280
I told you I was gonna get you
out of those sweats.

291
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,460
Look at you now, man.

292
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,310
Yeah, I didn't know
Men's Warehouse
made that size.

293
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,490
Hey, Faith and I
got married in this.

294
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,420
Okay, all right, all right.

295
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
I'm sure she would be proud.

296
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,290
I hope so.

297
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,480
Feels strange to walk right
into the belly of the beast.

298
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,460
Hey, I'm sure
it can't be easy.

299
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,440
It ain't.

300
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,490
Which is why
we gotta celebrate.

301
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,370
I don't care
if it is Ross in charge.

302
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,380
We are guests of honor
at the White House, man!

303
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,500
- When does that ever happen?
- Right.

304
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,380
And they sent us a limo, man.

305
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,450
What?

306
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,390
And we look good.

307
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,370
- Yeah.
- What?

308
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,390
Old school,
you got your smell-good on.

309
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,420
What?

310
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,370
And you got
the houndstooth on.

311
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,490
And we got the good stuff.

312
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,290
It's party time.

313
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,280
Captain America!

314
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,500
Captain, Captain, over here.

315
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,340
- Cap, over here!
- Mr. Bradley.

316
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,370
Over here!

317
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,500
-Hey, Isaiah. Check it out.
-Oh.

318
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,380
Whoa, man, look at this!

319
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,310
Oh, we gotta get a pic.

320
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,330
Let's do it.

321
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,460
Tres amigos on three.

322
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,470
Uno, dos, tres. Ah!

323
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,440
Yeah, that's my
new wallpaper. Look at that.

324
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,470
- Pretty good.
- It's good?

325
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,450
Can you send it to me?

326
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,360
Yeah, I'll AirDrop it to you
right now.

327
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,360
You do know
what AirDrop is, right?

328
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,380
Of course,
I know what AirDrop is.

329
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,340
What's AirDrop?

330
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
You see, you should have it.

331
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,360
Just hit "Accept"
and it pops up.

332
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,360
- I did that.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

333
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,320
The President
needs Mr. Wilson.

334
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,430
I'll see you guys inside.

335
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,450
-Hey.
-Hey.

336
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,330
Sam, just keep an open mind.

337
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,320
Why? What am I walking into?

338
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,420
Thi-- This is not
the picture you took.

339
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,280
Oh, I sent you
the wrong picture.

340
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,300
Oh, my Lord.

341
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Well, that's
a very good point.

342
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
I'll consider it.

343
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,470
Wilson.

344
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,440
Folks, can you give us
the room?

345
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Uh...

346
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,480
Thanks.

347
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,340
Doctor's orders.

348
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,460
Not quite a cigar,
but better than that damn gum.

349
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Hmm.

350
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Thanks for comin' in.

351
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,410
Welcome to the White House.

352
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,340
Well, thank you
for the invite, sir.

353
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,460
I have to admit, I'm still
gettin' used to the new look.

354
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,460
Yeah, well,
they said lose the mustache

355
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,310
or lose the election.

356
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,330
Thanks for your help
down in Mexico.

357
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,400
Retrieving that canister might
just have saved this treaty.

358
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,390
I was just doing my job, sir.

359
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,470
You and I
haven't always agreed

360
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,310
on how much latitude
enhanced individuals deserve.

361
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,500
But what you've accomplished

362
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,290
has given me reason
to reconsider.

363
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,340
Which is why I want you,
Captain America,

364
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,390
to help me
rebuild the Avengers.

365
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,420
-The Avengers?
-Yes, sir.

366
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,320
Well, with
all due respect, sir,

367
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,460
when you passed
the Sokovia Accords,

368
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,300
you tore the Avengers apart.

369
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,330
Why the change of heart?

370
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,280
I represent all Americans now.

371
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,500
Hell, half of 'em
wouldn't even
be here without the Avengers.

372
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,520
The country needs this.

373
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,440
And when we disagree on
how to manage a situation...

374
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,450
what happens then?

375
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,420
We figure it out together.

376
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,490
Look, you don't have to
give me an answer now.

377
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,510
Just think about it.

378
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,460
Prime Minister Ozaki.

379
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,370
-Great to see you, sir.
-And you.

380
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,440
Thank you for being here.

381
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,410
Here we are.

382
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,320
Sam Wilson,
Prime Minister Ozaki.

383
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,340
Not bad.

384
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,400
Would you like a picture?

385
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,400
Sure.

386
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,470
Sam, please.

387
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,380
Now,
stand a little bit closer.

388
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,300
-Thank you, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

389
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,410
Thank you.

390
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,460
Work with me, Sam.

391
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,460
We'll show the world
a better way forward.

392
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,470
That was unexpected.

393
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,400
Maybe it's an opportunity.

394
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,390
So?

395
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,480
How was it?

396
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,510
He asked me
to restart the Avengers.

397
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,310
Wait, what now?

398
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,470
-That's huge, man.
-I don't know.

399
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,370
We'd have to work for him.

400
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,410
Ladies and gentlemen,

401
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:21,310
the President of the
United States, Thaddeus Ross.

402
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,450
Good evening, everyone.
Good evening.

403
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,500
It's my great privilege
to host you

404
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,330
at the White House
on this historic evening.

405
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,280
When the celestial mass
emerged in the Indian Ocean,

406
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,410
we did what we often do.

407
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,430
We squabbled over it.

408
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:45,310
Countries rushed in
to claim it as their own,

409
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,290
setting up research facilities
to exploit its resources.

410
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,340
What was found
inside that island

411
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,400
is nothing short of
the discovery
of the millennium.

412
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,280
Its potential applications
in tech, in medicine,

413
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,490
in defense are immeasurable.

414
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,440
It's even more indestructible
than vibranium.

415
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,520
And it's not controlled
by an isolationist nation.

416
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,490
Ladies and gentlemen,

417
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,400
I present to you...

418
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,320
adamantium.

419
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,370
The first and only
refined sample

420
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,460
was stolen from
a Japanese mining site.

421
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,370
But happily,
it's been recovered
and is in a secure location.

422
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,340
And we have two incredibly
brave men to thank for that.

423
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,520
Joaquin Torres and our own
Captain America, Sam Wilson.

424
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,410
What we do next
with this discovery

425
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,320
will determine
how history judges us.

426
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,330
If we ratify this treaty,

427
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,470
together we can produce
enough adamantium

428
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,510
to fairly and equitably
distribute it
around the world.

429
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,500
Sir, you need to sit down.

430
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,280
Isaiah! What are you doing?

431
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Sam!

432
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,400
-Sir, are you hit?
-No.

433
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,320
Go, go, go!

434
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,520
Mr. President, come with me.

435
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,490
Shit.

436
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,400
Isaiah!

437
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,490
-Get on the ground now!
-Do not move.

438
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,520
What's happening?

439
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,360
I don't know.
But you gotta stop.

440
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,480
- Stop!
- Don't!

441
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,490
I can't go back inside, Sam.

442
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,370
Run, and it'll be
worse than that.

443
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,280
Please, Isaiah.

444
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,390
Hey, take it easy!

445
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,510
Watch my suit.

446
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,290
Please, watch my suit.

447
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,430
Cap, I can't let you in.

448
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,330
Hey!

449
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,420
Sam!

450
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,310
Sir, you can't-- you can't--

451
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:25,500
Sir!

452
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,430
- Sorry, Mr. President.
- Hey, hey, hey.

453
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,500
He stays.

454
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,390
Everybody else, out.

455
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,480
Agent Taylor, you too.

456
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,430
Are you okay?

457
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,340
I should be asking
you that, sir.

458
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,520
Not my first time
being shot at.

459
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,400
Look, I know how
this must look, but...

460
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,490
Can we have a minute?

461
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,450
She stays.

462
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,310
Meet Ruth Bat-Seraph,
my security advisor.

463
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,340
Sir, there's no way
Isaiah could have done this.

464
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,290
-Except he did.
-Maybe somebody got to him.

465
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,370
You're really defending a man

466
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,430
who just tried to kill
the President in front...

467
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,430
-We don't know what happened.
-Enough.

468
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,440
What do we know?

469
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,520
There were five shooters.

470
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,480
Isaiah was one of them.

471
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,520
As was Secret Service
and active military.

472
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,430
This was a coordinated
terrorist attack, sir.

473
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,420
What else do you have?

474
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,380
The song
that preceded the shooting,

475
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,320
we think it was a cue
for the attack.

476
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,290
Sir, Isaiah looked like
he wasn't in control.

477
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,460
He had no idea where he was.

478
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,420
So you're suggesting what?

479
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,490
Let me investigate.

480
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,330
Don't you think you're
a little too close to this?

481
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
Sir, your inner circle
has been compromised.

482
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,400
There's possibility
of another attack now.

483
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,290
And what exactly
do you have to offer

484
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,510
that our entire intelligence
and defense apparatus can't?

485
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,420
Well, I won't sit around
and let Isaiah...

486
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,330
Look, I know how important
Bradley is to you.

487
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,310
But consider the optics.

488
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,500
Captain America conducts
a personal investigation

489
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,440
of a friend who tried
to assassinate the President.

490
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,450
Isaiah sacrificed everything
for this country.

491
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,520
He's a soldier. A patriot.

492
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,390
He had no reason to do this.

493
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,360
He had every reason.

494
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,450
Bradley was in prison
for rescuing his own men,

495
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,320
experimented on for 30 years.

496
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,490
The things done to him are
enough to make anyone snap.

497
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,430
Sir, you invited me here
to work together.

498
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:37,400
-So let's work together.
-I'm afraid that offer expired

499
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,370
when your friend tried
to kill me.

500
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:48,410
Sam, you shouldn't even be
in these situations.

501
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,300
You're not Steve Rogers.

502
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,490
Ruth,

503
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,370
you have my full authority
to put this thing to bed.

504
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,500
Before this treaty
gets compromised any further.

505
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
So that's it?

506
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
I'm done?

507
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,440
You're done.

508
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,460
This is bullshit,
and you know it.

509
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,320
This is politics.

510
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,500
So you better wise up, son.

511
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,500
"Son." Who you calling "son"?

512
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,490
Sam. What the hell
are you doing?

513
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,300
I'm going to clear Isaiah.

514
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,460
Storming in there
ain't gonna help him.

515
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,470
-You need Ross on your side.
-Ross?

516
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,430
Open your eyes.

517
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,320
I offer to help,
and he sends me packin'.

518
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,520
Ross is on his own side.
He always has been.

519
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,300
Either you can't see that,
or you don't want to.

520
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,280
Hey.

521
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,320
Don't be that guy.

522
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,510
And what guy is that?

523
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,430
The one who has to do it
the hard way.

524
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,450
Looks like I am that guy.

525
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,290
The nation remains
on high alert.

526
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,330
The Justice Department has
signaled a death penalty case

527
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,520
will be pursued
against Isaiah Bradley.

528
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,470
Just five minutes, Cap.

529
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,510
I could be court-martialed
for this.

530
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,330
I appreciate it, Payumo.

531
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Yes, sir.

532
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,390
How you holdin' up?

533
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,310
Not so good, brother Sam.

534
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,370
Isaiah.

535
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,390
Look me in the eye.

536
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,470
Tell me you didn't
conspire to kill Ross.

537
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,510
Of course I didn't.

538
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,300
What in the world happened

539
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,450
to make you shoot
at the President?

540
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,470
I don't know.

541
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,470
You gotta give me more
than "I don't know."

542
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,380
Is there anything
you remember?

543
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,390
I got a haircut,

544
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,480
picked my suit up at
the cleaners and came to you.

545
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,320
We rode in the limo,

546
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,380
took our photo.

547
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,520
But my phone was on the fritz.

548
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:36,450
And then, we went over
to the East Room.

549
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,470
One moment I'm sittin' there,

550
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,490
the next I'm standin'
in that park.

551
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,390
I should have stayed
in my damn house,

552
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,520
minded my business.

553
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,280
No, this isn't on you.

554
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,430
Someone's behind all this.

555
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:54,450
Sam, the last thing I want
is for this to touch you.

556
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,490
Besides...

557
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,520
Look, there ain't no escapin'
for me this time.

558
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,450
I'm gonna die in here.

559
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,400
No, you're not.

560
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,480
I'm gonna get you out.

561
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,440
- You wanna help me?
- Of course.

562
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,320
Don't come back.

563
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,360
Guard.

564
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,520
Sergeant Payumo, get me
a copy of that conversation.

565
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,380
I wanna take another look.

566
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,410
Yes, ma'am.

567
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,420
And good work with Wilson.

568
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,280
Let me know
if he pays another visit.

569
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,300
Roger that.

570
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
You get in?

571
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,390
I think I committed
treason and espionage,

572
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,470
but I made it into
the White House's CCTV system.

573
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,320
What am I lookin' for?

574
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,290
When Isaiah went off
in the White House,

575
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,520
it made me think
of a friend of mine.

576
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,330
He was being controlled
by trigger words.

577
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,390
Do you see any strangers
talkin' to Isaiah?

578
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:27,340
No, well,
we got there, took a picture,

579
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,370
I AirDropped it to him,
but nothin' crazy.

580
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,430
Yeah, but he said his phone
was on the fritz.

581
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,470
Ah. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

582
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,290
Sam, I think I got something.

583
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,460
What is it?

584
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,290
His phone is like
flashing at him.

585
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,310
Oh, shit, I got
the same thing happening

586
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,410
to one of the other shooters.

587
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,360
What the hell?

588
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,500
Warden Cooper, Ross here.

589
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,460
The prisoner, he's secure?

590
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,490
I can confirm the prisoner
is in his cell.

591
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,400
Do we have eyes
on the bastard?

592
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,410
Personally.

593
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,360
I'm looking at him
right now, sir.

594
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,410
Thank you, Cooper.

595
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,520
Thank you, Mr. President.

596
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,410
I keep goin' back to Mexico.

597
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,460
We were at the White House

598
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,300
because the buyer
never showed.

599
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,460
Why hire SERPENT if you have
no intention on collecting?

600
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,450
Maybe they were expecting
Captain America to come.

601
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,520
What if the buyer wanted
Captain America to come?

602
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,460
And what if they wanted us
at the White House?

603
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,310
But how would
the buyer predict

604
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:56,490
that we'd get the invite, or
that you would invite Isaiah?

605
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,500
The buyer must be
watching us somehow.

606
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,490
Another thing.

607
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:04,400
Ruth Bat-Seraph,
Ross's security advisor,

608
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,500
find out what you can
about her.

609
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,300
Copy that.

610
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,390
I'll call you back later.

611
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,290
Target eliminated.

612
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,430
Stand by for proof of death.

613
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,340
Hmm.

614
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,470
No way you came
all the way from Mexico

615
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,340
just to blow up my car.

616
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,370
So you must have made up
with the buyer.

617
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,360
Get him on the phone.

618
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,290
Let me see
if I can resolve this.

619
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,320
"Resolve this"?

620
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,520
The buyer told me everything.

621
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:30,410
He mentioned that if you
survived the grenade,

622
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:36,390
there was a 77% chance
you'd try to talk me down.

623
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,280
Hmm.

624
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,340
Look at that.

625
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,500
The buyer told me
a lot actually.

626
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,490
After he didn't show
in Mexico,

627
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:18,420
he agreed to pay me double
to take you out.

628
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,340
What he doesn't know is that
I would kill you for free.

629
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,390
How often do you get a chance
to kill Captain America?

630
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,370
You're desperate
without your gear.

631
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,370
Nope.

632
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,480
Just a little meaner.

633
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,340
Hello.

634
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,490
Well done, Captain.

635
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,380
But you're not going to like
what's coming next.

636
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,440
Who is this?

637
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,360
How can we trust you to lead

638
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,430
when you can't even keep
your own house in order?

639
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,330
We have the shooters
in custody.

640
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,300
All I'm asking for
is patience.

641
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,460
Patience?

642
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,380
From the Hulk Hunter?

643
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,380
That was a long time ago.

644
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,360
Well, Mr. President,

645
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,510
I was almost killed
in your home yesterday.

646
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,400
And today, you are still
locked in your bunker.

647
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,490
You are not in a position
to be asking for anything.

648
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,510
I agree.

649
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,450
We should continue this
conversation another time.

650
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,440
Gentlemen, wait.

651
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,510
Please.

652
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,460
This treaty is too important
to let it fall apart now.

653
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,400
We made a promise
to our people.

654
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,460
We made a promise
to the world.

655
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,370
We must prevail.

656
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,330
We'll need Japan to proceed.

657
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,340
And
Prime Minister Ozaki's absence

658
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,450
speaks volumes.

659
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,500
I'll get Japan back
to the table.

660
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,310
Ozaki and I go back
a long way.

661
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,470
He's running for re-election.

662
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,510
He needs to assert leadership
on this treaty.

663
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:26,390
All right, Mr. President,
we'll remain patient

664
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,340
while you try
to get Japan on board.

665
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,310
But if you don't,

666
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,430
we'll have to take
measures into our own hands.

667
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,340
I've gotta get out of here.

668
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,340
Sit down.

669
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,470
Sir, the sweep's not complete.

670
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,400
The longer I stay here,

671
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,470
the weaker I look.

672
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,340
The hell happened to you?

673
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,490
Sidewinder tracked me down.

674
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,310
Well, it looks like
he did a lot more than that.

675
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,490
He's in police custody now.

676
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,410
-Shit, you good?
-I will be.

677
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,390
Last call, trace it.

678
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,460
All right.

679
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,290
Yo, get this.

680
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,380
Ross' advisor,
Ruth Bat-Seraph,

681
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,430
she was born in Israel
and trained in the Red Room.

682
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,440
She's ex-Widow.

683
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,480
That basically means
stay the hell out of her way.

684
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,480
Trust me.

685
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,520
Yep.

686
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,290
Now, this is weird.

687
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:47,390
Isaiah had Ross
in his crosshairs.

688
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,330
Couldn't miss.

689
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,340
I don't get it.

690
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,450
Why go through all that
trouble just to not kill Ross?

691
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,320
I don't know.

692
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,300
Oh, shit.

693
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,380
I think I located
Sidewinder's last caller.

694
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,450
It's in the middle of nowhere,
West Virginia.

695
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:03,360
It's just, like,
near some forest.

696
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,370
Database only shows one name.

697
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,280
Camp Echo One.

698
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,520
No satellite imagery.

699
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,370
Away from air traffic.

700
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,450
No infrastructure in the area.

701
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,440
-Do you think it's military?
-Yep.

702
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,510
It's a place they send you
and you never leave.

703
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,440
Ross told me stay out of this.

704
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,440
Eh, he's just the President
of the United States.

705
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,480
You don't have to come
with me.

706
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,310
Duh, I know.
That's what makes it so noble.

707
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,400
Pack as much gear
as you can carry.

708
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,320
I don't know
when we'll be back.

709
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,470
What, you mean like,
"right now" right now?

710
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,280
Yeah.

711
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,300
Oh, shit. Okay.

712
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,420
Well, it's a long-ass drive
to West Virginia,

713
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,510
so we're gonna need
some snacks.

714
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,430
Why did I invite you?

715
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,300
What? Wait, wait, wait.

716
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,300
Wait up!

717
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,510
Ruth Bat-Seraph.

718
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,310
Isaiah Bradley's
in holding cell 14.

719
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,300
-The other shooters are in 15.
-Okay.

720
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,360
Do you need an escort?

721
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,470
Think I'll be just fine.

722
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,310
-Thanks.
-Yes, ma'am.

723
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,440
I'd like to speak to them
one at a time.

724
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,420
Can you... Excuse me?

725
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,520
Payumo.
I'm talking to you. Hey.

726
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:43,480
Stop! Drop your weapon!

727
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,420
Payumo, what are you doing?

728
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,370
Drop it.

729
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,430
Increase that cadence

730
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,480
and resistance.

731
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,330
Or do whatever the hell
you need to do to get there,

732
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,360
all right?

733
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,480
Just stay in your lane.
Stay in your lane. Here we go.

734
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,380
Out to third!

735
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,380
Eye on the prize.
Eye on the target, baby.

736
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,440
- That's enough.
- Don't think about speed now.

737
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,360
Think about direction.
Think about intention.

738
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:29,300
If Doctor Eccles asks,

739
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,500
you tell her
I did the whole five miles.

740
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,290
That look.

741
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,500
We touch down in Tokyo
at 0600.

742
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,330
You still think
this is a bad idea?

743
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,450
Sir, whoever orchestrated
the attack

744
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:49,470
on the White House is still
in the wild.

745
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,510
International travel
brings security risks

746
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,330
we can't anticipate.

747
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:57,300
We barely got Congress
together on this thing.

748
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,340
If we lose
our international partners,

749
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,450
this treaty's toast.

750
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,490
I have to make this work.

751
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:08,470
Three miles and change.

752
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,400
I'll let Dr. Eccles know.

753
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,280
Five.

754
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,480
-Five.
-Five.

755
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,370
Do we have eyes on Wilson?

756
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:17,500
He left the base a few hours
ago with Joaquin Torres.

757
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,280
They ditched
their smartphones.

758
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,400
They're off-grid.

759
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,300
Well, I don't want a variable
out there

760
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,460
that I can't control.

761
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,320
Get a team,
pick him up, bring him in.

762
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,440
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah.

763
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:29,500
Breaking
news out of Washington,

764
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,470
President Ross is
on his way to Japan

765
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:33,520
just a day after surviving
an assassination attempt...

766
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,340
Bet you used to play this
old-ass game all the time.

767
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:37,370
Damn it.
This is hard.

768
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:38,370
Right.

769
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,470
The high-stakes
diplomatic visit...

770
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,360
How far are we
from Camp Echo One?

771
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,450
...over control
of Celestial Island.

772
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:47,280
We're about, like,
an hour away.

773
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,340
Sam, shit. They just
shot up Isaiah's prison.

774
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,310
Is he okay?

775
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:58,500
Yeah, Isaiah's good,
but the others...

776
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:00,390
they're dead.

777
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:01,450
Shit.

778
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,490
Should we go back?

779
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,320
No.

780
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,330
We keep going.

781
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,330
The buyer is pretty smart,
but we're not taking the bait.

782
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,370
Only way to help Isaiah is to
figure out who's behind this.

783
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:15,500
And whoever is behind it,

784
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,400
they do not want
us getting closer.

785
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,310
Cooper.

786
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,440
What's happening?

787
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,400
Mr. President,
as a precautionary measure,

788
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,290
I have moved the prisoner to--

789
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,320
President Ross,
I miss our little visits.

790
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:38,490
Tell me something.

791
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:41,340
Do you ever stop
to ask yourself

792
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:42,500
who's playing the music?

793
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,320
It's you.

794
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,370
The White House,

795
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:47,490
the assassination attempt.

796
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,490
That's a way of putting it.

797
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:52,520
I helped you more
than anyone else.

798
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,430
Only to get what you want.

799
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:55,450
What do you want?

800
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:59,380
I wanted my life back, but
it's too late for that now.

801
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,440
You've gotta--

802
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,460
You gotta understand
my position.

803
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,430
-I...
-Oh, I do.

804
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,360
You let me rot in this prison.

805
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,470
And it was my curse
to watch your betrayal

806
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:12,440
written in probabilities.

807
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,410
I'm making my own choices now.

808
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:19,280
So many surprises left.

809
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,300
When I'm done,

810
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,310
everyone will know
just who you are,

811
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:26,330
and Betty will despise you
even more.

812
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,390
Goodbye, Mr. President.

813
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,370
The hell is going on?

814
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,410
I'm putting you in solitary.

815
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:36,430
Yeah.

816
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,400
Nobody's gonna put me
in solitary ever again.

817
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,500
It's for your protection.

818
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,460
I'll tell you this one more
time for your protection,

819
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,390
I ain't goin'
in a box ever again.

820
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,470
I won't be able to
guarantee your safety.

821
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,480
Safety ain't all
it's cracked up to be.

822
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,300
You still think

823
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,430
I had somethin'
to do with all of this?

824
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:58,410
I don't know.

825
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,440
Mr. President.

826
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,410
I need you
to drop whatever you're doin'.

827
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:09,330
Camp Echo One's
been compromised.

828
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:11,280
Yes, Mr. President.

829
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,500
This is it.

830
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,490
Camp Echo One.

831
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,380
Telescopes must be a facade.

832
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,280
We gotta see
what's underneath.

833
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:53,500
We've got cameras and guards.

834
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,340
Redwing, cut the fence
and go loop the feed.

835
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:04,500
Yeah, we got a 28-second
window to get past the guards.

836
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,450
We gotta do the door manually.

837
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:10,490
Three, two, one,

838
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,330
go.

839
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:26,510
15 seconds.

840
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,430
I'm trying, man!

841
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:30,420
Shit!

842
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,460
There's no prisoners in here.

843
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,460
Why is there a lab
in this prison?

844
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:20,360
What the hell is this place?

845
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,410
What the hell?

846
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,420
Ozaki-san,

847
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,300
I want to assure you

848
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,360
America remains committed
to sharing our adamantium

849
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,330
with the rest of the world.

850
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,440
I trust Japan shares
that commitment.

851
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,300
The world needs this treaty.

852
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:00,390
Diplomacy must be hard
for you

853
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:02,480
A man in a country

854
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,370
so used to taking
whatever he wants by force.

855
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,390
Excuse me?

856
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:09,510
How else to explain your theft
of our adamantium,

857
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,300
only to return it to us
in Washington.

858
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:16,430
What you're accusing us of
is baseless

859
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:18,470
and insulting.

860
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:22,400
So, the information
my intelligence team received

861
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,520
and verified

862
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:25,470
is incorrect?

863
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,300
Wh--

864
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,320
I'm a fool.

865
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,490
I'm a fool to negotiate
with someone so naive

866
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:47,370
they don't realize
they're being played.

867
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:49,330
Naive?

868
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,380
If I'd stolen the sample,

869
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:56,470
why would I order Captain
America to retrieve it?

870
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:59,420
I suppose
we'll never know the truth.

871
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,460
Whatever game you're playing,
Japan wants no part in it.

872
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,330
Don't test us, Mr. President.

873
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,480
He's got optogenetic data
on a lot of people.

874
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,390
Don't make me look up words,
Joaquin.

875
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:25,330
I think he's figured out a way
to plant commands

876
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,360
into people's subconscious

877
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,280
using flashes of light.

878
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:31,310
This "Mr. Blue" song seems
to be some kind of trigger.

879
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:32,370
Mind control.

880
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:34,290
Yeah.

881
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,470
That explains Isaiah.

882
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,480
And that's more important.

883
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:45,370
Take risks.

884
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,360
Use those incredible brains
of yours.

885
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,400
Wasn't
half bad-looking, was I?

886
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,360
Samuel Sterns.

887
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,300
You know, it takes
an awful lot to surprise me.

888
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:09,430
There was an 89% chance
you'd turn around

889
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,510
if I put Isaiah Bradley
at risk,

890
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,460
yet here you stand.

891
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,370
You're the buyer.

892
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:18,390
Indeed.

893
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:21,290
Hiring SERPENT was
a necessary step

894
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:24,330
to create a chain
of statistical certainties.

895
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,310
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

896
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,310
I am, actually.

897
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:32,280
My mind sees it all,
every probable outcome.

898
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,480
So you hire SERPENT
to steal the adamantium,

899
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,330
shoot up Ross' summit
announcing it

900
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,380
and now you're just
sitting here, waiting.

901
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:43,290
Why do you wanna kill Ross?

902
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:47,280
Why does everyone think that
I wanna kill Ross?

903
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:51,410
Is it because he imprisoned me
here without a trial

904
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:54,370
after an infusion of gamma
warped the structure

905
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,390
of my brain?

906
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:01,340
Damn.

907
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:04,300
Once Ross discovered
how useful I could be,

908
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,330
he kept me here for 16 years,

909
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,300
turning my mind
to solving his problems.

910
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,520
My solutions brought him the
highest office in the country.

911
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,510
If I wanted Ross dead,
he'd be dead.

912
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,280
Well, whatever you're doing,

913
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:24,380
you're hurting a lot of
people, including my friend.

914
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,330
So this is the last chance
I'm gonna give you to stop it.

915
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,320
Why are you protecting him?

916
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:32,360
Ross knows I'm responsible
for the White House,

917
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:35,340
yet he's still letting Isaiah
sit in prison for it.

918
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:36,460
You know he'll never change.

919
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:38,410
Let me finish my work.

920
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,290
I'm afraid I can't do that.

921
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:48,370
Please don't be boring!

922
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,390
You think they'll stop us?

923
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:58,500
For long enough.

924
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,440
You're a fascinating problem.

925
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,510
But soon
you'll be off the board,

926
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,520
so you don't
surprise me again.

927
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:09,380
This is messed up, man.
It's not even their choice.

928
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,320
I know.
Just try and neutralize.

929
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:19,490
Punk-ass.

930
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,370
Stand down!

931
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,500
I'm taking them in.

932
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,490
I'll deal with these two.

933
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,460
Okay.

934
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,330
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

935
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,360
Well, that's what
I should be asking you.

936
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,480
Where's Sterns?

937
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:20,460
If Sterns is in the wind,
we need to set a perimeter,

938
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,330
roadblocks, air support.

939
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,450
He can't have gone far.

940
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:24,520
Why are you helping us?

941
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,480
'Cause you were right.
I thought that was obvious.

942
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:29,470
- Freeze!
- Oh. It's okay.

943
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:32,290
We have orders to take
Captain America into custody.

944
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:33,500
You already have one
Captain America in custody.

945
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,310
You want another?

946
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:36,440
You're under arrest
for trespassing

947
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,390
on restricted
government property.

948
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,320
Being right
always go like this?

949
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,400
Most of the time.

950
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,360
I have the clearances.
It's been a long day.

951
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,490
She's ex-Widow.
Just zap the guy.

952
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:52,310
These orders come
from the President himself.

953
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:53,420
Get them out of here.

954
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,510
Then we'll just call him.

955
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:58,410
Ruth, uncuff us now!

956
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,460
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Not again.

957
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,470
- Run!
- Go, go, go. Come on.

958
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:13,450
Go!

959
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,440
Mr. President,

960
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:22,290
Japan's claim
seems to be true.

961
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,500
We're trying to determine
the point of the breach.

962
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,490
Sir, we have to tell
Ozaki's team something.

963
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:29,320
We've got to stop
the bleeding.

964
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,450
I need some time alone.

965
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:32,300
We don't have much time, sir.

966
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,300
Ozaki just decided to advance
his navy on Celestial Island.

967
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,450
He intends to secure
the adamantium for himself.

968
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:38,470
Jesus.

969
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:40,480
France and India are drawing
up occupation strategies...

970
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,290
Mr. President, I suggest that
we return to DC immediately.

971
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,340
-No, I disagree.
-Immediately.

972
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:45,480
We are going to lose
our opportunity with Ozaki.

973
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,440
We need to regroup and figure
out a different solution.

974
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,380
We can't do that.
No, absolutely not!

975
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,410
We need to ask
for another meeting, sir.

976
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:51,400
If we call on Ozaki now,

977
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:53,430
and try to reach out to him,
we can...

978
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,330
We're not gonna miss
the opportunity.

979
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,520
We have to have
another meeting!

980
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,390
I want Carrier Strike Group
Five deployed immediately.

981
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,280
Tell 'em
I'm on my way there now.

982
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,460
Sir, are we seriously
talking about taking control

983
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,490
of Japan's adamantium?

984
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,440
I'm not going home
empty-handed.

985
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:27,320
If only one country is going
to control adamantium,

986
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,510
it's going to be us.

987
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,450
Make the call!

988
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,450
Taylor!

989
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:40,490
The President has informed me

990
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:42,320
that we need to move
Strike Group Five

991
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,480
to Celestial Island
immediately.

992
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:47,490
I want to be en route to the
Indian Ocean within the hour.

993
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:51,400
Mr. President,
this is extremely dangerous.

994
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,420
If a war breaks out...

995
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,330
I was a wartime general.

996
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:58,370
Now I'm a wartime president.

997
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:02,510
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

998
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:28,370
What are we doing here?

999
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:30,480
You say Ross' orders was
to take us into custody

1000
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,440
so I called in a favor.

1001
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,430
Thanks for doing this.

1002
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,370
No problem, Cap. Brass never
makes it down here.

1003
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:39,280
Terminal's set up,
ready to go.

1004
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:42,280
You sure you can knock out
Sterns' mind control?

1005
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,380
I should be able
to run a program

1006
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,450
that blocks the light signals

1007
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:47,360
that Sterns has been
sending out to control people.

1008
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:49,400
What if
he's already gotten someone?

1009
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:51,430
That's a good point.

1010
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:56,520
Are you crazy?

1011
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,430
We're clear here, at least.

1012
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:07,330
You have anybody
that you trust

1013
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,370
that can take a look at these
and tell me what's in 'em?

1014
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:10,490
Sure, I got someone.

1015
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:12,280
I'll get on it.

1016
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,310
-Thanks. Our guy here?
-Through there.

1017
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:16,310
Listen in.

1018
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,450
I'm amazed
you're still standing. Hmm.

1019
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:25,480
Most men don't survive
an axe to the gut.

1020
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,380
Kevlar weave, I presume?

1021
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,450
Perks of the job.

1022
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,360
You said you were gonna find
the man who wasted your time.

1023
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:34,290
I wanna know what you learned.

1024
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,370
Samuel Sterns.

1025
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:37,380
Gruesome fella,
don't you think?

1026
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,280
I've seen worse.

1027
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,370
Not without your Avengers.

1028
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,520
Full immunity and I'll talk.

1029
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:45,340
You're crazy.

1030
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:46,370
Who you kiddin'?

1031
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:48,290
You're here because
you're all out of options.

1032
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:49,490
You heard
what he did to those shooters.

1033
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:52,460
A guy like Sterns doesn't like
loose ends alive.

1034
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:57,480
Reduced sentence,
Allenwood, my own cell.

1035
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,320
Lemme hear what you got first.

1036
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:05,470
You know, it was my old unit
that found Sterns

1037
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:06,500
in the wreckage of Harlem.

1038
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:10,310
They said he'd been infected
with Bruce Banner's blood,

1039
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:11,500
but it didn't
give him strength.

1040
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,500
What did it give him?

1041
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:16,290
A mind capable
of impossible calculations.

1042
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,460
Ross being Ross,

1043
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,310
he saw an opportunity.

1044
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:23,430
Instead of removing the gamma
from Sterns' blood,

1045
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:25,500
he upped the dose.

1046
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:29,440
Made Sterns his own
personal think tank,

1047
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,360
creating technology
and weapons for the state.

1048
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:35,440
Holy shit.

1049
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,480
Why did Sterns
go along with it?

1050
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,400
Camp Echo One was the stick.

1051
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:43,360
I imagine
a pardon was the carrot.

1052
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:49,400
Ross told Sterns he'd let him
go once he became president.

1053
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,520
And yet, here we are.

1054
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:57,460
So Sterns hired you
to steal Japan's adamantium

1055
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,500
knowing it would divide
the two countries.

1056
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,520
He paid us
through a CIA black fund.

1057
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:07,450
That could kill the treaty
and start a war.

1058
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,410
And Ross would be blamed
for the chaos.

1059
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,380
How do you think a man
with Ross' temperament

1060
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,420
will deal with being caught
in a trap?

1061
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,370
If you break out of Allenwood,
I'll find you.

1062
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:24,360
When I break out, Captain,

1063
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,440
you won't walk away alive.

1064
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,520
-Did you know?
-Of course not.

1065
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:32,310
But Ross is not
that man anymore.

1066
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:34,400
None of us have to be
defined by our past.

1067
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:37,330
Cap, my guy needs 24 hours
on the pills.

1068
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,420
Okay. We need to get to DC

1069
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,400
and tell Ross
what Sterns is planning.

1070
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:41,500
President Ross isn't in DC.

1071
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:43,510
He's on the USS Milius.

1072
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,470
They just moved
into the Indian Ocean.

1073
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:47,480
Japan's warships are also
in proximity.

1074
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,320
Shit. Suit up.
We need to move.

1075
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:58,290
May I help you?

1076
01:05:58,310 --> 01:05:59,360
Hello, Admiral.

1077
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:01,310
May I use your phone?

1078
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:03,290
Hey, honey.
Who's at the door?

1079
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,340
Holy shit.

1080
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:10,510
You ever see
anything like this?

1081
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,340
No, I haven't.

1082
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,320
Let me do the talking
or he'll never listen.

1083
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,390
I haven't seen Ross like this
since the army.

1084
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:44,430
He better snap out of it.

1085
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:47,440
Because whatever Sterns is
planning, it's happening soon.

1086
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:51,480
I want a fleet of F-18s
ready to catapult.

1087
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,280
If they turn that ship around,
I want...

1088
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,280
What's he doing here?

1089
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,280
I told you not
to get involved, Wilson.

1090
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,360
I brought him, sir.

1091
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,380
I want him outta here!

1092
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,430
Sir, you asked me
to run this investigation,

1093
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:06,430
-and the situation is--
-Don't bother with excuses.

1094
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:09,290
You had a simple job
and you failed.

1095
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:10,310
Mr. President,

1096
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:13,440
we've uncovered intel
at Camp Echo One

1097
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:16,340
that could put millions
of lives at risk.

1098
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:18,380
Now, you and I both know
Isaiah's innocent.

1099
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:22,320
I'm happy to have
this conversation in public,

1100
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:23,340
if you like.

1101
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:33,320
This is crazy.
Japan's supposed to be our--

1102
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,390
Jackal?

1103
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:36,460
Jackal, do you copy?

1104
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:43,490
Make it quick, Wilson.

1105
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:47,420
I've got Japan's fleet
on my ass

1106
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,420
trying to make it to
that island before we do.

1107
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,280
That's exactly what he wants.

1108
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,280
Sterns has been pulling
the strings on everything.

1109
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,510
SERPENT's theft
of the adamantium,

1110
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,410
the attack on the White House.

1111
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:59,360
The CIA leak to Japan.

1112
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:02,370
He's pitting you and Japan
against each other

1113
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:04,370
to ensure that
this moment happens.

1114
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,420
How the hell did he do
all that from prison?

1115
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,450
Mind control.
He created a technology

1116
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:11,360
that allowed him
to control the minds

1117
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:12,490
of anyone he targeted.

1118
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:14,480
Including maybe you, sir.

1119
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,480
Have you been feelin'
like yourself lately?

1120
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:30,460
Of course I have.

1121
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,470
But he has
your data, sir. Why?

1122
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:33,500
I don't know.

1123
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:38,320
If he can control minds,
surely he can hack files.

1124
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:41,360
The logs show that you visited
Camp Echo One numerous times.

1125
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:45,490
To ensure a high-value
prisoner was secure.

1126
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:47,330
Yeah, but the scans, the EKG,

1127
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,310
the blood work
was all taken there, sir.

1128
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:50,340
This is ridiculous.

1129
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:52,280
Mr. President,
answer the question.

1130
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,320
I don't have to answer you!

1131
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:55,380
Why visit a Black Site,

1132
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,330
-in the middle of nowhere...
-Wilson, stop!

1133
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,410
I order you to stop!

1134
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:00,310
-...to conduct these tests?
-I order you to stop!

1135
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:02,400
-Why?
-Because I was dying,

1136
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,460
goddamn it!

1137
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,520
Because my heart was failing!

1138
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:15,300
No one could figure it out
until he did.

1139
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,310
These things
have kept me alive.

1140
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:27,310
And in return, I gave him hope

1141
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,300
that he might get
his life back.

1142
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:33,420
He got a lab to do the work.

1143
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,390
I even tried
to get him moved but--

1144
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:38,330
But you couldn't risk
losing the pills.

1145
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:46,500
After your friend the Hulk
and the Abomination

1146
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:50,490
destroyed Harlem,
someone had to take the fall.

1147
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:52,440
Sterns was just...

1148
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,370
collateral damage.

1149
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:01,380
I have dedicated
my entire life

1150
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,310
to serving this country.

1151
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:10,310
The one person that matters...

1152
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,490
doesn't seem to understand.

1153
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:21,380
Betty never forgave me for
sending the army after Banner.

1154
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,290
I had to survive...

1155
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:33,390
...so that my daughter knew

1156
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:35,500
that there was more
to her father.

1157
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,510
That I'm the same man
that used to take her

1158
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,450
to see the cherry blossoms.

1159
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,390
She still can, sir.

1160
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:48,400
I know what it's like...

1161
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:53,280
to feel you have
somethin' to prove.

1162
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,430
Everyone only seeing
one thing.

1163
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:00,430
But when showing
there's more to you,

1164
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:03,440
it's not about
when times are easy.

1165
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:06,520
It's about moments like this.

1166
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,300
Now, we're here
because Sterns wants revenge

1167
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,410
and doesn't care
if he incites a war.

1168
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:16,500
We're playing right
into his hand.

1169
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:19,390
Mr. President,
two of our F-18s

1170
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:21,470
just fired
on the Japanese fleet.

1171
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:26,450
Keep hailing those pilots.

1172
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:30,290
Damage
to Japanese fleet minimal.

1173
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:32,360
Ready air defense systems.

1174
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:34,380
What the hell
are those pilots doing?

1175
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,400
Call them back in.

1176
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,420
We tried, sir.

1177
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,300
Jackal and Whiskey
won't respond.

1178
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,310
We gotta get our birds
in the air.

1179
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,330
You have two ready
to fly now, sir.

1180
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:44,490
Go.

1181
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:01,360
Sterns got to our pilots

1182
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:02,450
before I shut down the system.

1183
01:12:03,410 --> 01:12:05,470
We need to get the Japanese
out of the air.

1184
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,340
Stay close
and don't get yourself killed.

1185
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:09,510
No dying, copy that.

1186
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,480
Return to your fleet.

1187
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:37,500
Jackal's headed towards
the Japanese fleet.

1188
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:41,280
Shit! He just fired on them.

1189
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,310
Mr. President,
do not send more fighters up.

1190
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:46,440
We need Japan to see
we're trying to deescalate.

1191
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:03,450
Sir,
six Japanese missiles inbound.

1192
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:07,520
Launch intercept missiles.

1193
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,390
Damn, two got through.

1194
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:23,510
Take the one on the right.

1195
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:31,500
Redwing, a little help.

1196
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:54,330
Sir, you need to convince
Japan to ground their planes.

1197
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,280
This is what we expected

1198
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,280
from a Ross presidency.

1199
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:04,480
Mr. Prime Minister, two
of our pilots have gone rogue.

1200
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,310
Call off your planes.
We're being manipulated.

1201
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:08,290
Certainly.

1202
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:09,390
By you.

1203
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:11,500
Hiding your assassins
behind Captain America.

1204
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:16,420
He's trying
to bring them down now, sir.

1205
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:19,440
If those pilots are not
taking orders from you,

1206
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:23,290
then who gives them
their commands?

1207
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,500
That's what I thought.

1208
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:31,480
Mr. President?

1209
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:39,370
Ah,
now we're getting somewhere.

1210
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:43,280
That fire in the belly.
The rage.

1211
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,300
Why don't you just let it out?

1212
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,400
Are you all right, sir?

1213
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,450
I just need a moment.

1214
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,390
Joaquin,
Whiskey's coming at you.

1215
01:14:58,410 --> 01:14:59,520
Copy that.

1216
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,360
Sam, once we're done,
you gotta teach me your moves!

1217
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:19,330
Altitude. Altitude.

1218
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,490
Altitude.

1219
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,510
Whiskey's away.
Send rescue.

1220
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,390
Roger, sending rescue.

1221
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:31,390
You have two Japanese fighters
coming up on your tail.

1222
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:33,380
Why the hell
are they still chasing us?

1223
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,400
We're trying to help them.

1224
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:37,320
Because Ross won't tell
them who's really behind this.

1225
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:43,310
All that hatred
you try to hide,

1226
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:47,410
all the ugliness,
it's still there, Ross,

1227
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,480
smoldering behind the eyes.

1228
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,400
Joaquin,
I'm goin' after Jackal.

1229
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,390
Roger that.
I'll keep these guys busy.

1230
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,440
What have you done to me,
you bastard?

1231
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:24,310
What we agreed on.
Maybe a hair more.

1232
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:25,470
You poisoned me!

1233
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:27,510
Stop taking the pills then.

1234
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,330
But we both know you won't.

1235
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:34,340
Give me what I want.
Stop fighting it.

1236
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:35,440
No!

1237
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:08,430
Sam, Jackal
just fired his last missiles!

1238
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,440
I got one.
Going after the another.

1239
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:17,500
- Back off! I'll get it!
- No, no! I got it.

1240
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,340
-Back off!
-I got it.

1241
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:23,500
Joaquin!

1242
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,390
Joaquin's down!
I'm goin' after him.

1243
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:34,460
We'll send search and rescue.

1244
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,400
You have to stop Jackal.

1245
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:37,440
Damn it!

1246
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,520
I'm putting an end
to this now.

1247
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:41,510
Give in to your rage.

1248
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:45,500
I'm taking your legacy
as we speak.

1249
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,390
Come on, Ross.
You're almost there.

1250
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:53,430
You can rip their fleet apart
with your bare hands,

1251
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:55,340
and kill Captain America.

1252
01:18:00,490 --> 01:18:01,460
Oh, shit.

1253
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:10,510
Let the monster
inside you out.

1254
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,400
Altitude, altitude, altitude.

1255
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,450
Altitude, altitude, altitude.

1256
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:27,340
Unleash your anger.

1257
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,290
Unleash your hatred.

1258
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:30,430
Redwing, stabilize!

1259
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,360
Nothing can stop you, Ross.

1260
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,300
You can crush them all.

1261
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,370
Mr. President?

1262
01:18:57,490 --> 01:19:00,360
Sir. Are you okay?

1263
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:02,490
Captain America neutralized
the rogue pilots.

1264
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,510
Japan's recalling
their planes.

1265
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,420
Get Ozaki back on the line.

1266
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,320
We can fix this.

1267
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:29,360
Where's Joaquin?

1268
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:31,280
Med-evac just got to him.

1269
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:32,390
Thank God.

1270
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,440
A crisis was narrowly avoided

1271
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,370
when a brief dogfight
broke out

1272
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:46,420
between Japanese
and US military forces

1273
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,400
over Celestial Island.

1274
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,410
US Air Force Lieutenant
Joaquin Torres

1275
01:19:50,430 --> 01:19:52,410
was shot down
during the skirmish,

1276
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:53,480
and is now in surgery at

1277
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:56,400
Walter Reed National Military
Medical Center.

1278
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:58,420
His condition is critical.

1279
01:19:58,440 --> 01:19:59,490
Here, give me that clamp.

1280
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:01,300
Gonna need to pack this!

1281
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,440
The pressure's stable.

1282
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,280
Suction!

1283
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:07,360
I can't see anything.
More suction.

1284
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,320
Retractors.

1285
01:20:14,290 --> 01:20:15,430
It's a private room.

1286
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:18,520
Go away.

1287
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:26,320
I missed you, too.

1288
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:37,440
I hate to admit it,
I'm glad you're here.

1289
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:47,280
You looked good out there
on that six o'clock.

1290
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:49,360
But then I saw this.

1291
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:52,460
The doctors had to
restart his heart.

1292
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:56,280
They don't know if...

1293
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,390
This isn't your fault.

1294
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,410
It makes me think of Steve.

1295
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:07,510
How many alien invasions
did he stop again?

1296
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,330
Two.

1297
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,340
Two.

1298
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:13,320
Wow.

1299
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:17,500
What made me think
I could follow that?

1300
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:25,320
I should've took the serum.
Like Steve, like you.

1301
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:27,490
Why?

1302
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:34,390
Because this is all startin'
to seem much bigger than me.

1303
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:41,320
Ross, he asked me
to restart the Avengers, Buck.

1304
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,280
But Joaquin's in here,

1305
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:46,300
Isaiah's in prison,
and Sterns...

1306
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:51,340
I had him. I had Sterns
right in my hands.

1307
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:53,440
And he got away.

1308
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,420
He damn near pushed us
to the brink of war,

1309
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,280
because I wasn't...

1310
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:01,520
Say what you need to say.

1311
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,430
Steve made a mistake.

1312
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,330
No, he didn't.

1313
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,310
He gave you that shield

1314
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:17,280
not because
you're the strongest,

1315
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,380
but because you're you.

1316
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,420
You think
if you had that serum

1317
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,290
you'd be able to protect
all the people you care about.

1318
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:30,280
Steve had it, and he couldn't.

1319
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,420
You're a human being,
and you're doing your best.

1320
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:36,440
Steve gave people
something to believe in.

1321
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:37,460
But you...

1322
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,280
you give 'em
something to aspire to.

1323
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,480
Did your speechwriters
help you with that?

1324
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,390
They did, yeah.
The ending, a little bit.

1325
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:49,390
Well, did you like it?

1326
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:51,440
No, no, it was good.
Solid B-plus.

1327
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:53,520
-Emotional.
-Yeah, very. I felt it.

1328
01:22:54,290 --> 01:22:55,320
But just enough.

1329
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:56,310
Yeah.

1330
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:59,480
Listen, I gotta catch a plane.

1331
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:02,410
I have a campaign fundraiser.
It's so stupid.

1332
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:09,280
It's gonna be all right, man.

1333
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,360
Thanks, Buck.

1334
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:19,320
I love you, buddy.

1335
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,340
-Was that...
-Yep.

1336
01:23:30,490 --> 01:23:34,340
Future Congressman
James Buchanan Barnes.

1337
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:41,340
He's taller in real life,
nice smile too,

1338
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:43,500
good amount of teeth,
great posture.

1339
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,480
He's 110 years old.

1340
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:47,360
I can work with that.

1341
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:48,450
While the investigation

1342
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:50,480
into the White House
assassination attempt

1343
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,340
and the shocking shooting at

1344
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:55,340
Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling
is still under way,

1345
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:57,400
Isaiah Bradley is set to go

1346
01:23:57,420 --> 01:23:58,450
before a military judge
tomorrow.

1347
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:59,480
I need some air.

1348
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:02,360
It's a stunning
fall from grace for a man

1349
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:05,320
brought out from the shadows
by Captain America.

1350
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,410
Just two years after
being exonerated

1351
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:08,490
for unjust charges,

1352
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:12,310
Bradley now finds himself
held in solitary confinement

1353
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:15,390
and facing a possible
death sentence.

1354
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:29,400
Okay, reset.
Let's go again.

1355
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:32,430
Talk to me.

1356
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:34,370
Dunphy,
you check out my report?

1357
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:35,410
All right,
what am I looking at?

1358
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:37,340
Those pills you gave me,

1359
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:38,420
they're loaded
with gamma radiation,

1360
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,460
engineered to be
absorbed into the blood.

1361
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,360
Where the hell
did you get these?

1362
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:44,310
Shit. I gotta make a call.

1363
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:55,490
This sound is currently
affecting your equilibrium.

1364
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,300
When I turn this dial,

1365
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:00,480
it will disrupt
your heartbeat.

1366
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:04,300
I take no pleasure
in your death,

1367
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:06,490
but I can't have you
calling the Captain.

1368
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:09,440
Who are you?

1369
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:12,390
Isn't it obvious?

1370
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:14,490
I'm the hero.

1371
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:38,370
Sir.

1372
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,470
Agent Taylor.

1373
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,360
Just wanted to let you know

1374
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:44,420
that every guest
has been screened,

1375
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,440
and we also did three sweeps
of the Rose Garden.

1376
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,320
Thank you.

1377
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,470
-See you out there.
-Yes, sir.

1378
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:12,340
Hello?

1379
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:15,400
Hello. Hi.

1380
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,400
I... how are you?

1381
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:22,330
I'm sorry,
I should have called

1382
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,380
after the attack
at the White House.

1383
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,480
Are you okay?

1384
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,500
Oh...

1385
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:28,460
I'm fine.

1386
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,370
It's really good
to hear your voice.

1387
01:26:33,390 --> 01:26:35,280
I didn't think you'd answer.

1388
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:40,480
Betty, I... I know I've made
a lot of mistakes.

1389
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:47,430
But I'm trying to change,
to be a better person.

1390
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,280
Um...

1391
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:55,420
Maybe we could take a...
a walk sometime?

1392
01:26:56,380 --> 01:27:01,400
See the cherry blossoms,
like the old days.

1393
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:08,470
Yeah. That could be nice.

1394
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:14,300
Okay. I love you.

1395
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,310
Bye, Dad.

1396
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,460
Please.

1397
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,330
Good afternoon, everyone.

1398
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:45,290
When I took office,

1399
01:27:45,310 --> 01:27:50,380
I promised we would create
a true, lasting peace.

1400
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:55,440
Today, we begin
to realize that promise.

1401
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,460
Captain America...

1402
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:02,520
would you do me the kindness

1403
01:28:03,290 --> 01:28:07,360
of counseling a bitter man
at the end of his rope?

1404
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:09,300
That's what you do, isn't it?

1405
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:11,420
Guess we have five minutes

1406
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,450
until the MPs drag your ass
outta here.

1407
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:17,320
You ruined my grand finale
on the Indian Ocean.

1408
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:19,340
So now I'm forced
to turn myself in

1409
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:20,370
to get what I want.

1410
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:22,450
Well, if you're waitin'
for an apology,

1411
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:24,280
we'll be here awhile.

1412
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,500
I'm waiting for you to realize

1413
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,520
that we both want
the same thing,

1414
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,480
for the world to see Ross
as he truly is.

1415
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:36,290
I'm proud to say our treaty
will finally be signed.

1416
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:38,330
I'll take a couple questions.

1417
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:40,320
Sir, what do you say
to reports

1418
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:41,520
that relations with Japan
broke down

1419
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:43,280
over your handling

1420
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:44,470
of the White House
assassination attempt?

1421
01:28:44,490 --> 01:28:47,440
Despite fabrications
that some have used

1422
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:49,400
to turn us against each other,

1423
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:52,430
our bonds have proved strong.

1424
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:55,280
You kept Ross alive for years.

1425
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:58,420
Didn't kill him when you had
the chance at the White House.

1426
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:01,360
The way I see it,

1427
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:05,430
the Indian Ocean
wasn't about starting a war.

1428
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,480
You wanted to
destroy his legacy.

1429
01:29:09,490 --> 01:29:11,280
Yes.

1430
01:29:12,410 --> 01:29:14,360
But you haven't
figured out how.

1431
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:15,510
The pills.

1432
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:17,390
I got somebody on that, too.

1433
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,450
Not anymore, you don't.

1434
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:22,430
Is it true hostilities
in the Indian Ocean

1435
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:24,430
occurred because
the Japanese discovered

1436
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:26,330
it was, in fact,
your government

1437
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,310
who paid for the SERPENT
mercenary group

1438
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:29,480
to steal their adamantium?

1439
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,380
We did not pay them.

1440
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,370
Ross turned me into a monster.

1441
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:37,440
It's only right that I do
the same thing to him.

1442
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:39,510
Why aren't you smiling?

1443
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:42,360
-On the ground!
-Hold it!

1444
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,340
You ever use
that big brain of yours

1445
01:29:49,370 --> 01:29:52,370
to consider that maybe
you're wrong about Ross?

1446
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,500
Wanna bet?

1447
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,490
Yeah.

1448
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:58,370
-Where are you going?
-To stop this.

1449
01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:00,510
Get on the ground, now.

1450
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,460
You have the right
to remain silent...

1451
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:04,520
Captain America!

1452
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:09,400
If I'm right about Ross,
you're going to die.

1453
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,410
You're going to die!

1454
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,320
Mr. President,
Dr. Samuel Sterns

1455
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:16,480
just turned himself in.

1456
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:19,380
He claims you
promised him a pardon

1457
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:22,320
if he worked on secret
government projects for you.

1458
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:23,360
That is a lie.

1459
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:25,500
President Ross,

1460
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:26,520
I miss our little visits.

1461
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:28,450
What do you want?

1462
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:30,320
I wanted my life back,

1463
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:31,420
but it's too late
for that now.

1464
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,450
Sir...

1465
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:34,280
I helped you
more than anyone.

1466
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:35,400
Well, let me explain.

1467
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:36,460
They have to know.

1468
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,420
You gotta
understand my position.

1469
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:42,320
Oh, I do.
You let me rot in this prison.

1470
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:43,450
Leave me alone!

1471
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:45,420
- Leave me! Let me go!
- Sir! Sir!

1472
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,520
I cannot let you.

1473
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:49,290
-You can't let me? Let me?
-I cannot...

1474
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:52,500
Everyone will know
just who you are.

1475
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:55,330
And Betty will despise you
even more.

1476
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,520
Sir, please.

1477
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:07,470
Sir.

1478
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:15,480
Oh, my God.

1479
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,380
Since when were they red?

1480
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:45,290
President Ross?

1481
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:49,470
Agent Taylor, do we fire?

1482
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,500
This is what Sterns wanted.

1483
01:32:37,490 --> 01:32:38,500
Jesus.

1484
01:32:44,510 --> 01:32:46,410
Sam, I gotta get these people
outta here.

1485
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:47,470
Set a perimeter
around the White House.

1486
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:17,430
No.

1487
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:19,370
Fall back. Fall back!

1488
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:27,320
Get down!

1489
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:31,330
Sam, drones incoming.

1490
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:18,310
Ruth, I need you to
clear Hains Point.

1491
01:34:18,330 --> 01:34:19,450
I'll lure Ross there.

1492
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:21,520
Sam, are you crazy?
He'll kill you.

1493
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:23,320
Do it!

1494
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:22,390
You can still fight this,
Ross.

1495
01:35:22,410 --> 01:35:24,290
Do you see where you are?

1496
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:28,300
You remember this place?

1497
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:31,300
You used to come here
with Betty.

1498
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:35,410
That didn't work.

1499
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:45,360
Okay.

1500
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:46,400
You want me?

1501
01:35:47,470 --> 01:35:49,310
Come and get me!

1502
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,470
Sam?
Sam, can you hear me?

1503
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,480
Sam, are you okay?

1504
01:37:48,450 --> 01:37:51,280
Please tell me I knocked
that son of a bitch out.

1505
01:37:57,510 --> 01:37:58,510
Shit.

1506
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:06,320
Backup's five minutes away.

1507
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:08,340
No, tell them wait.

1508
01:38:08,370 --> 01:38:09,440
What?

1509
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,480
Should've taken that serum.

1510
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,460
Bucky is full of shit.

1511
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:28,420
I'm gonna lose that bet.

1512
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:36,490
Ross.

1513
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:39,480
We both know you can
take me out with one punch,

1514
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:42,320
but I don't think
you wanna do that.

1515
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:52,510
I know you've done
some terrible things.

1516
01:38:54,490 --> 01:38:56,300
Now, I might be crazy...

1517
01:38:57,370 --> 01:38:59,430
but I think you're
trying to change.

1518
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,440
Now's the time to prove it
to the world.

1519
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,280
Prove it to Betty.

1520
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:03,280
The army is transferring
Sterns to a secure facility.

1521
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,510
We should get you
to the hospital.

1522
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:09,290
There's somewhere
we gotta go first.

1523
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:22,510
That's three, old man.

1524
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:26,400
I told you I'd get you out.

1525
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:28,460
Took you so long?

1526
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:34,340
Thank you, Sam.

1527
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,310
I got you.

1528
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:38,280
I have a few broken bones,
so...

1529
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:43,290
Come on, Mr. Bradley.

1530
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:45,300
We got a little paperwork
to fill out,

1531
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:47,280
and then you're free to go.

1532
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:55,300
Worldwide talks continue

1533
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:58,330
in the arms race
for the new element

1534
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:01,420
as we enter the
brave new world of adamantium.

1535
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,500
Back in our nation's capital,
ground was broken

1536
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,280
on the restoration
of the White House,

1537
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:08,440
marking a significant step
towards normalcy

1538
01:41:08,460 --> 01:41:09,430
for the country.

1539
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:29,340
Right this way.

1540
01:41:37,370 --> 01:41:41,320
Mr. President.
How're your digs?

1541
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,480
Intentionally uncomfortable.

1542
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:54,370
I heard the food
hasn't got any better either.

1543
01:41:54,390 --> 01:41:56,360
You heard right.

1544
01:41:57,290 --> 01:41:58,370
Bradley got out?

1545
01:41:58,390 --> 01:41:59,360
Yes, sir.

1546
01:41:59,470 --> 01:42:00,500
That's good.

1547
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:03,380
Mr. President,
about your blood work.

1548
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,510
It seems Sterns raised
the level of gamma

1549
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:07,510
in those pills over time.

1550
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:10,410
It built up in your body
over the years.

1551
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:11,390
That led to your...

1552
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:13,300
Led to my little tantrum.

1553
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,440
Which is why I have to be
in here.

1554
01:42:17,490 --> 01:42:19,510
Good solid walls, these.

1555
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:21,300
Yeah.

1556
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:22,510
But I have to say,

1557
01:42:23,390 --> 01:42:24,430
it wasn't nothin' to see you

1558
01:42:24,450 --> 01:42:27,390
take full responsibility
for your actions.

1559
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:32,290
Give up your office.
Accept your sentence.

1560
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:34,310
I had to let the country
move on.

1561
01:42:35,380 --> 01:42:37,430
Japan decided to uphold
the treaty, by the way.

1562
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:38,410
Us too.

1563
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,420
The Ozaki-Ross Accords.

1564
01:42:42,370 --> 01:42:43,380
You did it.

1565
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:45,440
Sam, why are you here?

1566
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:47,470
Sir?

1567
01:42:49,450 --> 01:42:51,410
We were on different sides
of this thing

1568
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:52,500
every step of the way.

1569
01:42:54,470 --> 01:42:56,440
Look, if we can't see
the good in each other,

1570
01:42:58,280 --> 01:42:59,390
we've already lost the fight.

1571
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:04,380
Besides, I wanted to make sure
an old soldier was okay.

1572
01:43:06,510 --> 01:43:10,390
I'd love to stay, but looks
like you have another visitor.

1573
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:20,480
Hi, Dad.

1574
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:28,290
I guess I have to give you
a raincheck on that walk.

1575
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:30,440
It's all right.

1576
01:43:32,450 --> 01:43:34,520
We could just sit and talk
for a little while.

1577
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:38,330
I'd like that.

1578
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:41,310
Me too.

1579
01:43:54,450 --> 01:43:56,290
How's the kid doin' today?

1580
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:59,320
He's still a little out of it
but doin' better.

1581
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:01,450
I'm gonna let you two
catch up.

1582
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:03,520
Hey, where you headed?
Back to Baltimore?

1583
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:05,410
No.

1584
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:09,410
I got Ruth and me tickets
for tonight's game, courtside.

1585
01:44:10,290 --> 01:44:12,330
It's the least I could do
for gettin' me out.

1586
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:13,490
You know,
I'm happy you found a friend

1587
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:15,490
as grumpy as you are
to go to games with.

1588
01:44:18,330 --> 01:44:19,330
Say it again.

1589
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:25,310
I'm playing.
Got you.

1590
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:33,440
The Falcon awakens.

1591
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:36,470
Couldn't let you
have all the fun.

1592
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:44,390
I'm sorry I screwed up.

1593
01:44:44,410 --> 01:44:46,370
Screwed up? Get out of here.

1594
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:47,430
I did.

1595
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:49,420
You never messed up
like I have.

1596
01:44:50,490 --> 01:44:52,440
You never got
shot out of the sky

1597
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:55,450
and nosedived into
the Indian Ocean.

1598
01:44:56,440 --> 01:44:58,290
You're always on point.

1599
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:01,290
Yeah.

1600
01:45:03,310 --> 01:45:04,520
Because if I'm not on point...

1601
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,400
I feel like I let down

1602
01:45:10,420 --> 01:45:13,360
everyone else who was fightin'
for a seat at that table.

1603
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:18,290
That's pressure, man.

1604
01:45:20,310 --> 01:45:21,420
It weighs on you.

1605
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:27,380
Makes you wonder
if you'll ever just be...

1606
01:45:29,380 --> 01:45:30,440
enough.

1607
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:41,280
Where I grew up,

1608
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:44,440
I only ever got
to see heroes online.

1609
01:45:45,310 --> 01:45:46,400
Or on TV.

1610
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:49,440
It always felt so far away.

1611
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,380
And I kept thinkin' maybe
if I get out of Miami,

1612
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,340
you know,
maybe one day I could be...

1613
01:45:56,370 --> 01:45:58,280
Don't say Ant-Man.

1614
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:02,510
No, man.

1615
01:46:07,290 --> 01:46:08,330
I wanted to be you.

1616
01:46:09,470 --> 01:46:10,430
Well...

1617
01:46:10,450 --> 01:46:12,280
Sam Wilson.

1618
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:17,380
Because that guy?
That guy won't ever give up.

1619
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:21,290
That pressure,
that responsibility

1620
01:46:21,310 --> 01:46:22,320
you talk about?

1621
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:24,400
I want that too, man.

1622
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:35,460
You know it's all
about timin', right?

1623
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:41,400
Control your spin, then hit
your thruster before you kick.

1624
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:48,310
- No.
- Yeah.

1625
01:46:48,330 --> 01:46:49,430
No. That's...

1626
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:51,320
That's it.

1627
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:53,510
I should get shot out
of the sky more often.

1628
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:55,360
Yeah, you will.

1629
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:57,400
Okay.

1630
01:46:58,390 --> 01:47:00,390
You know, you're gonna
come back from this.

1631
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:02,290
I know.

1632
01:47:03,410 --> 01:47:07,470
And when that time comes,
make sure the suit's ready,

1633
01:47:07,490 --> 01:47:09,510
'cause Ross was right
about one thing.

1634
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:13,310
The world needs the Avengers.

1635
01:47:13,330 --> 01:47:15,390
-For real?
-Yeah.

1636
01:47:15,410 --> 01:47:17,290
Hell, yeah.

1637
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:20,300
I wasn't thinking
about it before,

1638
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:21,500
but now that
you bring it up...

1639
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:22,480
Oh, boy.

1640
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,380
...since the wings
are damaged,

1641
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,280
I was thinking, I'm like,
what could make--

1642
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:27,300
No.

1643
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:28,280
You didn't hear

1644
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:30,280
-what I was gonna ask you.
-No. Whatever you ask, nope.

1645
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:32,360
I'm just saying,
maybe you have, like,

1646
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:33,490
the Wakandans on speed dial

1647
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:35,320
and could get me some...

1648
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:38,500
A hookup on an upgrade
on the wings.

1649
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:42,440
You're gonna ask the Wakandans
for a hookup?

1650
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:43,430
Yeah.

1651
01:47:43,450 --> 01:47:45,370
That is the most Miami thing
in the world.

1652
01:47:45,390 --> 01:47:48,310
Are you kidding? They gonna
hook me up, man. Yo.

1653
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:36,830
Told you you were gonna
lose that bet.

1654
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,470
You wanna know what's funny?

1655
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:42,390
I'm not in the mood
for your jokes.

1656
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:45,420
You killed a lot of good men
trying to get your revenge.

1657
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:48,380
Trust me, we don't share
the same sense of humor.

1658
01:50:48,670 --> 01:50:51,500
We share the same world,
don't we?

1659
01:50:52,130 --> 01:50:54,230
This world you would
die to save?

1660
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:57,440
It's coming.

1661
01:50:58,370 --> 01:51:00,340
I've seen it
in the probabilities,

1662
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,340
seen it plain as day.

1663
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:06,330
All you heroes
protecting this world...

1664
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:08,880
do you think
you're the only ones?

1665
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:12,300
Do you think
this is the only world?

1666
01:51:14,170 --> 01:51:15,370
We'll see what happens

1667
01:51:15,390 --> 01:51:19,900
when you have to protect
this place from the others.
