00:00:52,643 --> 00:00:54,061
You punk...

4
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:57,106
Think you can pick a fight with yakuza

5
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,316
and get away with it?

6
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:00,150
As of today

7
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:03,487
this is Tokyo Manji Gang's territory

8
00:01:04,154 --> 00:01:05,030
Got it?

9
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:10,410
No...stop!

10
00:01:26,176 --> 00:01:28,637
Shit

11
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:35,895
[ Alarm ]

12
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:41,191
Yo! Get up!

13
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:43,861
Get up!

14
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:47,197
- Sorry...   - Shut the alarm!

15
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,868
- Sorry!   - Turn it off!

16
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,040
OK, it's off. Sorry

17
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,377
Don't rely on me to get you up!

18
00:02:01,378 --> 00:02:02,880
Thanks...

19
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:07,384
Ugh

20
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,105
This is still edible

21
00:02:20,856 --> 00:02:22,983
Don't hesitate, Takemichi

22
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:24,568
Just do it

23
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:26,320
A dumptruck rode up onto

24
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:27,738
the sidewalk

25
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:29,073
in Shibuya yesterday

26
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,241
killing two pedestrians

27
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:37,497
The victims were Hinata Tachibana, age 27

28
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,000
and Naoto Tachibana, age 25

29
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:42,294
Both were pronounced dead

30
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:43,754
at the hospital

31
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:47,007
Tachibana...

32
00:02:52,262 --> 00:02:53,597
Hinata...

33
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,771
The only girlfriend I ever had is dead...

34
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:04,817
The victims were Hinata Tachibana, age 27

35
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:07,444
and Naoto Tachibana, age 25

36
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,989
Police believe an escalating turf war

37
00:03:10,072 --> 00:03:12,282
between Tokyo Manji Gang known as "Toman"

38
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:14,785
and yakuza are behind the...

39
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,911
Morning

40
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:17,454
Good morning, Manager!

41
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:19,289
I told you

42
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:21,291
no smartphone during work

43
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,960
Porn, right?

44
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:25,504
- No...   - You can go now

45
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:27,547
Go to a club and get laid

46
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:31,760
No girlfriend at your age?

47
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:32,636
And still a virgin?

48
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,805
Trying to set a record?

49
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:40,895
Are you mad?

50
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:44,439
Like, "If I was still in high school

51
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:46,150
I'd kick you hard"?

52
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:49,278
Guys like you glorify the past

53
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:51,446
You peaked in high school

54
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:52,907
Am I right?

55
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:56,618
Sorry...

56
00:03:57,077 --> 00:03:59,496
That's all you ever say

57
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,332
I bet you've gotten away with

58
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,418
apologizing your whole life

59
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:06,962
Sorry...

60
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:08,505
Move

61
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:13,427
Darn guy needs to shave

62
00:04:14,011 --> 00:04:16,388
I hate guys with stubble

63
00:04:17,347 --> 00:04:21,101
So what if I'm a virgin?

64
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:23,938
I'll set a world record!

65
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,731
I did have a girlfriend

66
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:28,608
even though she was my one and only...

67
00:04:32,863 --> 00:04:35,365
Was that my peak?

68
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:38,953
Where did I go wrong?

69
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:41,205
This crappy life...

70
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:00,390
Ow!

71
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:03,018
What the hell, Takemichi?

72
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,104
- Did I just die?   - Huh?

73
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:07,898
Akkun?

74
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,069
- Is it you?!   - What, dude?

75
00:05:12,194 --> 00:05:14,154
Yamagishi! Oh my god!

76
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,323
- What's wrong with you?   - What's up?

77
00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:17,908
Makoto!

78
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:19,576
Still scratching your crotch

79
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:20,995
Takuya!

80
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:23,538
- What?   - What's with you?

81
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:26,333
We're the Mizo High 5, right?

82
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:29,794
Wait a minute... What?

83
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,631
You're so obsessed with Tachibana

84
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:34,299
you can't even think straight

85
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:38,095
Why is Hinata Tachibana dating you?

86
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:39,804
I get it!

87
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:41,473
This is a flashback

88
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:43,475
What's a flashback?

89
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,559
You know!

90
00:05:44,684 --> 00:05:46,311
When you see your life flash before you

91
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:47,896
right before you die?

92
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:57,406
You're really funny

93
00:05:57,906 --> 00:05:58,698
Let's go

94
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,085
What the hell?

95
00:06:10,794 --> 00:06:14,506
Who is this lame punk?

96
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:20,262
Oh my god, I remember now

97
00:06:20,387 --> 00:06:23,307
This was me, back in the day!

98
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:24,975
Enough already!

99
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:26,977
Get serious!

100
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:29,813
We need to get into fight-mode

101
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:31,023
Fight?

102
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,107
With who?

103
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:34,068
Shibuya High sophs

104
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:40,157
Make way for the future hair stylist

105
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:42,492
Takemichi, call Masaru again

106
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:43,618
Masaru?

107
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:46,580
Masaru at Shibuya High

108
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:49,166
Your mad dog cousin

109
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,793
He'll keep the seniors away, right?

110
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:54,296
Oh, yeah... I remember now

111
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:57,174
Where's your phone, Takemichi?

112
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:00,427
Whoa! Flip phone!

113
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:01,845
What? Flip phone?

114
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,807
July 2nd... 2010?

115
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,766
Takemichi

116
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:10,020
I'll take on the boss

117
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,022
You take his #2

118
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:16,443
Hold on...

119
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,696
Can I get something straight?

120
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,241
It seems we're going to fight

121
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,868
Seems? We are

122
00:07:24,993 --> 00:07:26,078
But why?

123
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:28,622
They treat us like wimps!

124
00:07:29,164 --> 00:07:30,082
Wimps...

125
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:31,125
who cares?

126
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,335
You're gonna whack 'em

127
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:36,796
with your backhand, right?

128
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:38,382
I'm counting on you

129
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:45,389
I was cool...

130
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:50,060
I was so cool back then!

131
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:52,729
- So cool   - Yeah, cool

132
00:08:18,922 --> 00:08:23,343
Yo, Shibuya High soph!

133
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:25,429
- Come down here!   - Running away?

134
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:27,097
Idiot!

135
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:28,557
Idiot

136
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:30,100
Was that cool?

137
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:32,477
- Yeah, perfect   - Yeah, Takemichi

138
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:33,728
That's good

139
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:34,771
Yo!

140
00:08:45,615 --> 00:08:46,991
So you're the ones

141
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:50,954
messing with our sophomores

142
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:54,166
It's the seniors!

143
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,126
For real...

144
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:58,253
That's... Kiyomasa

145
00:08:58,378 --> 00:09:01,173
Mr. Kiyomasa to you

146
00:09:02,132 --> 00:09:04,968
Mr. Kiyomasa of Tokyo Manji Gang...

147
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:07,179
Tokyo Manji Gang...

148
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:08,597
Shit, Takemichi!

149
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,308
Call Masaru, quick!

150
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:12,934
Sorry!

151
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:20,900
That's Masaru right there...

152
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:23,737
They were out of cream puffs

153
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:25,655
so I bought an éclair

154
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,159
Cream puffs and eclairs

155
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:30,660
are totally different

156
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:33,037
Yes. Total opposites...

157
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:35,999
Masaru, the mad dog?

158
00:09:36,124 --> 00:09:38,042
Loyal dog, more like!

159
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:42,005
Go buy me some cream puffs!

160
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:46,343
We came to fight!

161
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:56,353
Where's the punchline?

162
00:09:57,812 --> 00:10:00,064
There isn't one

163
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:06,530
Akkun, no!

164
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:08,490
- I can't turn back now   - You have to!

165
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:10,116
He'll will thrash us

166
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,035
and make us slaves for life!

167
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,203
What are you talking about?

168
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,496
Let's run!

169
00:10:14,704 --> 00:10:15,705
Run!

170
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:26,425
Hold it!

171
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:30,387
No one gets away

172
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:37,977
This was the start of my lifetime of apologies

173
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:39,896
Ready? Bark!

174
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:42,816
Let me hear you bark

175
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,819
We got beaten up every day

176
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:48,780
I dropped out of school to escape

177
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:53,577
Nothing went right after that

178
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:55,912
- Sorry!  - You piece of crap!

179
00:10:56,037 --> 00:10:57,456
Notthing goes well

180
00:10:57,581 --> 00:10:58,957
You're in the way

181
00:10:59,082 --> 00:10:59,916
Sorry

182
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,125
Apology...

183
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:04,045
after apology...

184
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,088
Sorry

185
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:07,507
My life went off track

186
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,220
because of him...

187
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:16,766
I'm sorryyyyy!

188
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:18,602
Kneel!

189
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:23,106
Head on the ground

190
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:25,108
From today

191
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:29,195
you're property of Toman

192
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,366
Answer!

193
00:11:32,532 --> 00:11:35,410
Yes! Please!

194
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:46,129
50-page essay on the difference

195
00:11:46,254 --> 00:11:47,964
between cream puffs and éclairs

196
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,967
You're too easy on them!

197
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:52,594
These punks can't write

198
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:54,137
Neither can you!

199
00:11:56,473 --> 00:11:58,642
You have 'til tomorrow

200
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:09,319
That really hurt...

201
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:21,373
Don't tell anyone I cried...

202
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:24,250
You alive, Akkun?

203
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:30,632
How about you guys?

204
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:34,218
Is everyone OK?

205
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:36,346
Yamagishi?

206
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:38,473
Where's my glasses?

207
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:50,902
Your date with Tachibana...

208
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:56,199
Sorry you missed it

209
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:57,617
Shut up!

210
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:06,751
Is your leg asleep?

211
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:08,044
Lamer!

212
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:15,259
This flashback sucks

213
00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:24,811
I thought I escaped all this

214
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:32,652
Why am I reliving it?

215
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:38,992
Where you going, Takemichi?

216
00:13:42,746 --> 00:13:44,873
This ain't no joke!

217
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:50,504
This isn't how it should end!

218
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:57,176
I know my life sucks

219
00:13:57,594 --> 00:14:00,555
I know my life sucks!

220
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:13,067
Hinata Tachibana...

221
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:21,951
What did she look like?

222
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,841
[ TACHIBANA ]

223
00:14:59,322 --> 00:15:01,616
You always appear out of nowhere

224
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:08,498
Hinata...Tachibana...

225
00:15:18,842 --> 00:15:20,384
Did you fight again?

226
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:24,848
I'll fix you up

227
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:27,684
I have some bandages

228
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:32,522
Does it hurt?

229
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:49,205
What the...

230
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:57,714
- Sorry   - Does it hurt that much?

231
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:00,174
Why do you keep fighting

232
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:02,051
when you always get hurt?

233
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:04,846
Aren't you tired of it?

234
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:13,104
I was. 10 years ago

235
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:15,189
10 years ago?

236
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:17,859
Nothing...

237
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:23,156
Anyway, I'm glad I met you

238
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:25,158
What?

239
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:27,535
I saw you yesterday and today

240
00:16:27,827 --> 00:16:29,746
and I'll see you tomorrow

241
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:38,755
Actually, I'll be dead 10 years from now

242
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:42,926
This is a just flashback...

243
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:45,595
Dead?

244
00:16:46,596 --> 00:16:48,598
You won't die

245
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,226
Why not?

246
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:54,896
Why not?

247
00:17:01,945 --> 00:17:03,112
Because you're tough

248
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:06,282
Who, me?

249
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,038
Let's just say you die 10 years from now

250
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:14,457
But you're still with me

251
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,292
10 years from now, right?

252
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:20,504
Unfortunately

253
00:17:21,047 --> 00:17:23,717
I'll be even more worthless then

254
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:29,472
Then be a man

255
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,267
And be with me 10 years from now

256
00:17:38,314 --> 00:17:42,861
Why did you decide to go out with me?

257
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:51,369
I'm going home

258
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:52,829
See you tomorrow

259
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,717
Tomorrow...

260
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:10,388
You're tall for a middle schooler

261
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:12,056
How tall are you?

262
00:18:12,348 --> 00:18:13,474
Sit down

263
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:15,309
Sit down!

264
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:17,771
I bet you drink milk every day

265
00:18:17,854 --> 00:18:21,524
That's Tachibana's brother...

266
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:24,360
- Where's your money?   - Found it

267
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:26,195
I'll buy you a roll

268
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:34,287
Why are you messing with a middle school kid?

269
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:38,207
Who are you?

270
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,376
Get lost, punk

271
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:43,546
- Punk?   - He's so cool!

272
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:47,842
I'm emotionally unstable right now

273
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,427
I'll kill you!

274
00:18:55,892 --> 00:18:56,893
Here

275
00:18:57,143 --> 00:18:58,186
Thanks

276
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:03,441
Don't tell your sister

277
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:04,984
It ain't cool

278
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:08,905
OK. I won't tell her

279
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:11,240
You're so big

280
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:15,119
You should learn how to defend yourself

281
00:19:16,204 --> 00:19:17,956
I don't like fighting

282
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,586
The victims were Hinata Tachibana

283
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:25,755
and Naoto Tachibana

284
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:28,174
What's wrong?

285
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:30,093
I know...

286
00:19:32,178 --> 00:19:33,512
You protect her!

287
00:19:33,596 --> 00:19:37,100
You protect Tachibana!

288
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:38,935
What are you...

289
00:19:39,018 --> 00:19:40,728
This sounds crazy but listen!

290
00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:42,313
I die 10 years from now

291
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:44,941
then time travel back to my high school days

292
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:47,193
It sounds unreal

293
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,153
but you and Hinata

294
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:51,489
are gonna die on July 1, 2020

295
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:54,951
In a truck accident

296
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,537
involving the street gang called Tokyo Manji Gang

297
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:00,790
- Street gang?   - Listen!

298
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:03,084
You protect Tachibana!

299
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:11,300
Unfortunately...

300
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:15,179
I just see it on the news

301
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:20,768
Pitiful, huh?

302
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:23,980
What am I talking about?

303
00:20:24,063 --> 00:20:25,564
This is a flashback...

304
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:32,655
I'm in love with your sister

305
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:36,242
I'm crazy about her

306
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:37,994
I remember now

307
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:43,749
She really sees me

308
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,711
A poor loser like me

309
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:49,923
What are you saying?

310
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,799
Just remember!

311
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:54,177
10 years from now on July 1

312
00:20:57,263 --> 00:21:01,017
I'm off to my next flashback now

313
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,771
I'm counting on you

314
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:17,616
Are you OK?

315
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,286
He's awake

316
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:21,996
- Did I die?   - You're alive

317
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:23,206
I'm alive?

318
00:21:23,331 --> 00:21:24,498
I survived?

319
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:25,749
And died?

320
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:27,793
- I'm alive!   - Yes!

321
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:31,297
This detective rescued you

322
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:32,381
just in time

323
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:34,258
Long time no see, Takemichi

324
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,759
Naoto!

325
00:21:36,427 --> 00:21:37,971
Why are you wearing a suit?

326
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,597
Is this a flashback?

327
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,265
What year is this? Where am I?

328
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:43,559
July 2, 2020

329
00:21:44,393 --> 00:21:46,520
You wet yourself a little, that's all

330
00:21:47,396 --> 00:21:48,272
No way...

331
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:53,736
But why are you alive, Naoto?

332
00:21:57,406 --> 00:21:59,075
I knew it

333
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:02,411
In the world you know

334
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:04,413
I'm supposed to be dead

335
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,418
"In the world I know"?

336
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:11,921
What the hell is that?

337
00:22:15,091 --> 00:22:18,219
On July 2, 2010

338
00:22:18,594 --> 00:22:21,973
you appeared and prophesied that

339
00:22:22,598 --> 00:22:25,268
my sister and I would die 10 years later

340
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:30,356
Wasn't that a flashback?

341
00:22:30,773 --> 00:22:33,943
You travelled back in time

342
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:37,196
Somehow I survived

343
00:22:37,821 --> 00:22:39,782
and was able to rescue you

344
00:22:46,122 --> 00:22:47,123
Time travel?

345
00:22:47,248 --> 00:22:48,958
I should've died yesterday

346
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,584
Yeah. I saw it on the news

347
00:22:50,709 --> 00:22:52,045
But you warned me

348
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:53,504
and here I am

349
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:55,798
You changed my destiny

350
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:59,885
I believed you that day

351
00:23:00,386 --> 00:23:02,263
and became a detective

352
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:05,641
To protect my sister

353
00:23:07,226 --> 00:23:11,064
So...is Tachibana alive too?

354
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:13,607
She died

355
00:23:14,775 --> 00:23:16,777
I couldn't change that

356
00:23:20,156 --> 00:23:22,325
How did you survive then?

357
00:23:23,617 --> 00:23:24,493
Ow!

358
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:28,039
I warned her many times

359
00:23:28,122 --> 00:23:29,498
but she wouldn't believe me!

360
00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:30,583
I don't blame her

361
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,793
She knew nothing about Toman!

362
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:34,128
Ow, that hurts...

363
00:23:34,253 --> 00:23:36,047
It's going to hurt a lot more

364
00:23:36,422 --> 00:23:37,090
What do you mean?

365
00:23:37,173 --> 00:23:38,674
Did you forget what you said?

366
00:23:38,841 --> 00:23:42,970
Toman is responsible for my sister's death!

367
00:23:56,442 --> 00:23:57,818
Sorry...

368
00:23:57,943 --> 00:24:01,239
You can't even kill one lousy person

369
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:07,120
You haven't progressed at all in 10 years

370
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:16,212
That's her pet goldfish from 10 years ago

371
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:18,922
She won it at the festival you both went to

372
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:20,924
I adopted it

373
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,477
Back then, Toman was just a street gang

374
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:33,187
Now they're a powerful

375
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,980
crime organization

376
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:37,566
They developed drug routes

377
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:39,735
and are behind many

378
00:24:39,818 --> 00:24:41,820
unexplained deaths in recent years

379
00:24:42,738 --> 00:24:45,408
Even the police can't pin them down

380
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:48,411
This is insane...

381
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,832
Who's this?

382
00:24:53,957 --> 00:24:55,126
Manjiro Sano

383
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:58,296
Tokyo Manji Gang's leader and...

384
00:24:59,588 --> 00:25:01,090
Tetta Kisaki

385
00:25:01,174 --> 00:25:02,716
another key player

386
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:05,052
Manji wouldn't be what it is today

387
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,096
if these two had never met

388
00:25:08,722 --> 00:25:10,891
I called you because I want you

389
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:12,643
to travel back in time again

390
00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:14,728
Are you crazy?

391
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:16,939
Shaking hands with me seems to be the key

392
00:25:17,106 --> 00:25:20,151
Remember our handshake 10 years ago?

393
00:25:20,401 --> 00:25:23,946
At that moment, your essence disappeared

394
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:26,990
No way...

395
00:25:27,116 --> 00:25:29,952
Your mission is to return to high school

396
00:25:30,035 --> 00:25:32,121
and stop Sano and Kisaki from meeting

397
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:34,957
They met in July 2010

398
00:25:40,588 --> 00:25:41,922
I'm going home

399
00:25:42,047 --> 00:25:43,257
Takemichi!

400
00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:45,301
I can't do it!

401
00:25:45,384 --> 00:25:46,635
I can't!

402
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:49,930
What do you expect from a loser like me?

403
00:25:50,055 --> 00:25:51,807
I believed in you 10 years ago!

404
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,143
It's your turn to trust me!

405
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:02,151
The next time you return

406
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,071
I believe my sister will be alive

407
00:26:11,952 --> 00:26:13,746
Hinata Tachibana...

408
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:17,166
Alive...

409
00:26:22,796 --> 00:26:24,298
Once you complete your mission

410
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,759
shake my hand and come back

411
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,894
I'm telling you, I don't think I can do it

412
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,189
- Not a loser like me   - Takemichi

413
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:43,734
You can change destiny

414
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,126
What day is it?

415
00:27:09,885 --> 00:27:11,387
You OK, Takemichi?

416
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:17,059
Akkun, Makoto, Takuya, Yamagishi

417
00:27:17,893 --> 00:27:19,895
So I'm really here

418
00:27:19,978 --> 00:27:21,355
Of course you are

419
00:27:21,897 --> 00:27:24,400
We have no right to refuse

420
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:25,526
Why?

421
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:29,071
It's a gladiator match sponsored by Toman

422
00:27:30,573 --> 00:27:32,032
That's right!

423
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:34,117
I remember now

424
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:36,704
Kiyomasa forced us to fight...

425
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:38,038
Next match!

426
00:27:38,914 --> 00:27:41,667
From Mizo High, Takuya!

427
00:27:44,587 --> 00:27:46,046
From Shibuya High

428
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,466
Kishino!

429
00:27:51,594 --> 00:27:53,804
Can you fight, Takuya?

430
00:27:54,096 --> 00:27:55,973
You're kind of sickly, right?

431
00:27:56,432 --> 00:27:57,975
I'll avenge you

432
00:27:58,058 --> 00:27:59,935
- Buy me a beef bowl later...   - Let's go!

433
00:28:00,018 --> 00:28:00,894
Takuya

434
00:28:02,271 --> 00:28:04,315
I wanna fight in his place

435
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:07,776
But if we defy Kiyomasa, we're dead

436
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:10,779
I have to do this

437
00:28:13,031 --> 00:28:14,533
Do what, Akkun?

438
00:28:24,627 --> 00:28:26,253
Look at that

439
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:33,135
Akkun stabbed Kiyomasa on July 7

440
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,970
We'll never laugh again

441
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:36,805
as long as you're alive...

442
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:39,975
What day is it?

443
00:28:40,267 --> 00:28:41,435
The 7th

444
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,354
We should be at the fireworks festival

445
00:28:47,983 --> 00:28:49,568
Akkun, don't do it...

446
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:52,112
Takemichi

447
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:57,993
How did you know?

448
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:02,456
Go back

449
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,668
I'll take care of this

450
00:29:16,011 --> 00:29:17,971
Stop this match!

451
00:29:29,442 --> 00:29:31,860
What do you think you're doing?

452
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:40,619
These matches are getting boring

453
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:49,878
Kiyomasa! King versus slave

454
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:52,590
Fight me

455
00:29:54,883 --> 00:29:56,259
You talking to me?

456
00:29:56,927 --> 00:30:00,305
I don't see any other lame kings around here!

457
00:30:12,693 --> 00:30:13,486
Takemichi...

458
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:14,737
Move!

459
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:16,905
Has he lost his mind?

460
00:30:26,749 --> 00:30:31,253
Kiyomasa, you belong to Toman, right?

461
00:30:33,046 --> 00:30:34,757
If I win

462
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:38,719
introduce me to Manjiro Sano

463
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,018
You punk!

464
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:48,479
How dare you call his name?

465
00:31:22,471 --> 00:31:24,515
You die. Right now

466
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,984
Takemichi!

467
00:31:38,153 --> 00:31:40,113
You can run and beg forgiveness

468
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,199
all your life

469
00:31:42,783 --> 00:31:44,076
but you'll still be

470
00:31:44,242 --> 00:31:46,161
a worthless piece of shit

471
00:31:48,831 --> 00:31:50,332
Then be a man

472
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:53,418
And be with me 10 years from now

473
00:31:57,005 --> 00:31:58,757
Takemichi! Enough!

474
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:00,593
Mr. Kiyomasa! I'll fight!

475
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:02,803
- Takemichi!   - Don't do it

476
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:07,683
You guys need to shut up

477
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,688
For the first time in my life

478
00:32:13,689 --> 00:32:15,858
I ain't running away

479
00:32:17,943 --> 00:32:19,361
Shut up, all of you!

480
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:03,071
If I win...

481
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:09,077
I wanna meet Manjiro Sano

482
00:33:11,914 --> 00:33:13,165
You...

483
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:17,586
Someone! Bring me a bat!

484
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:19,797
Stop, Takemichi!

485
00:33:19,922 --> 00:33:21,715
- Takemichi!   - You'll die!

486
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,258
Enough! Give it up!

487
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:24,927
I can't!

488
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:27,596
I can't give up now!

489
00:33:30,432 --> 00:33:31,892
There's a reason

490
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:36,521
why I can never give up

491
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,611
Give me the bat!

492
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:56,583
Fine

493
00:34:00,295 --> 00:34:03,173
You'll have to kill me to win

494
00:34:07,302 --> 00:34:08,971
Yo, Kiyomasa

495
00:34:11,306 --> 00:34:13,058
You lost your audience

496
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:18,438
It's him!

497
00:34:18,563 --> 00:34:20,858
It's the boss!

498
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,487
The big boss?

499
00:34:26,905 --> 00:34:30,158
No, that's Draken, the #2

500
00:34:31,827 --> 00:34:35,080
The small one's the boss. Mikey

501
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:38,000
The leader of Toman?

502
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:57,394
Remember this angle when you bow to the boss

503
00:34:57,602 --> 00:34:58,436
Yes, sir...

504
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:05,027
Your head's right in the strike zone

505
00:35:05,318 --> 00:35:07,570
Wanna see what happens

506
00:35:08,822 --> 00:35:10,032
if I use this?

507
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:13,201
My apologies!

508
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:30,803
Your name?

509
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,432
Takemichi...Hanagaki

510
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,351
I see

511
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:40,979
Takemitchy

512
00:35:41,814 --> 00:35:42,981
Takemitchy

513
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:46,484
From today, we're buddies!

514
00:35:47,527 --> 00:35:48,403
What?

515
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,613
What Mikey says goes

516
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,240
Right Takemitchy?

517
00:35:54,827 --> 00:35:58,621
So who's in charge here?

518
00:36:22,562 --> 00:36:24,689
Gladiator matches are stupid

519
00:36:26,942 --> 00:36:29,361
Don't disgrace Toman's name!

520
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:31,196
We're sorry!

521
00:36:32,405 --> 00:36:34,241
What, Boss?

522
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:38,036
Kenchin, I dropped my bean bun

523
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,747
- It's still good!   - The 3 second rule!

524
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,917
- Pick it up! Hurry!   - Go buy a new one!

525
00:36:44,042 --> 00:36:45,794
Don't call me Kenchin

526
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:49,214
See ya, Takemitchy

527
00:36:52,134 --> 00:36:56,096
That's Manjiro Sano...

528
00:36:59,307 --> 00:37:02,644
Is our life of slavery over?

529
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:05,313
It's over!

530
00:37:06,314 --> 00:37:10,152
Lie down here. Just do it

531
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:14,948
From today, you're Takemitchy

532
00:37:15,615 --> 00:37:18,827
What Mikey says goes. Right?

533
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,960
- It wasn't like that   - Stupid

534
00:37:35,844 --> 00:37:36,970
Thanks...

535
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,849
I wet my pants a bit, though

536
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:49,357
You were so cool

537
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,193
Takuya

538
00:37:52,194 --> 00:37:54,196
You were so cool

539
00:37:56,114 --> 00:37:57,157
What?

540
00:37:57,866 --> 00:37:59,701
- Nothing   - Were you copying me?

541
00:37:59,784 --> 00:38:02,037
I wasn't copying you

542
00:38:04,372 --> 00:38:06,541
This fight was too much

543
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:08,376
Nah, he just bashed my head

544
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,170
into the railing, that's all

545
00:38:10,295 --> 00:38:11,379
Railing?

546
00:38:13,048 --> 00:38:16,384
Why do you have to fight day after day?

547
00:38:16,551 --> 00:38:20,222
I'd like to live in peace, too

548
00:38:36,905 --> 00:38:38,406
She's so cute!!

549
00:38:39,074 --> 00:38:41,159
Life was good 10 years ago!

550
00:38:41,243 --> 00:38:43,536
Why don't I just stay here?

551
00:38:52,087 --> 00:38:53,630
She's my girlfriend...

552
00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:01,263
I wish I was a guy

553
00:39:02,097 --> 00:39:03,098
What?

554
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:05,934
Then I could protect you

555
00:39:13,108 --> 00:39:16,987
No, I'll protect you, Hina

556
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:24,286
I can't imagine a world without you

557
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:28,081
So I'll protect you

558
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,669
You called me Hina...

559
00:39:35,964 --> 00:39:38,300
Yeah. First-name basis

560
00:39:40,593 --> 00:39:41,636
I...

561
00:39:43,638 --> 00:39:45,890
was a real loser until now

562
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:50,312
I ran away from trouble

563
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,649
and apologized whenever

564
00:39:57,986 --> 00:39:58,861
But I...

565
00:40:01,656 --> 00:40:03,408
Naoto!

566
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:06,828
Naoto!

567
00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:11,333
You came back

568
00:40:14,669 --> 00:40:16,963
I didn't mean to shake your hand

569
00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:19,549
So my theory was correct

570
00:40:20,008 --> 00:40:22,177
What date and time did you return to?

571
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:25,263
July 7th. Around 5 pm

572
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:26,931
And you shook my hand...

573
00:40:27,474 --> 00:40:28,725
Around 8 pm?

574
00:40:29,434 --> 00:40:31,019
What's going on over here?

575
00:40:31,186 --> 00:40:32,895
I knew it. It all makes sense

576
00:40:33,021 --> 00:40:34,689
So what happened to me?

577
00:40:34,772 --> 00:40:36,774
When you went back in time

578
00:40:36,858 --> 00:40:39,319
you were fast asleep, like in a coma

579
00:40:39,527 --> 00:40:40,862
Suspended animation

580
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:47,535
It seems you can travel back

581
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:49,912
to the same day and time as now

582
00:40:50,122 --> 00:40:52,124
So if you travel back in time today

583
00:40:52,207 --> 00:40:54,000
it'll be 10 years ago today

584
00:40:54,126 --> 00:40:56,211
If you stay a week

585
00:40:56,294 --> 00:40:58,796
you'll return to this world a week later too

586
00:40:58,921 --> 00:41:00,673
I'll be fired from my job

587
00:41:00,798 --> 00:41:02,467
Who cares?

588
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,261
My sister's life is on the line

589
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,012
What about your mission?

590
00:41:06,554 --> 00:41:07,847
I met Mikey

591
00:41:08,306 --> 00:41:11,684
- Mikey?   - Manjiro Sano, head of Toman

592
00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:14,104
That was fast...

593
00:41:14,562 --> 00:41:17,399
But I haven't met Kisaki yet

594
00:41:21,736 --> 00:41:24,614
Forget Kisaki

595
00:41:26,158 --> 00:41:28,826
But he can't meet Sano, right?

596
00:41:30,703 --> 00:41:32,580
Kill Sano

597
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:39,587
If Manjiro Sano dies

598
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:41,173
they'll never meet

599
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:42,715
Then my sister will live

600
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:43,925
It's simple

601
00:41:46,344 --> 00:41:47,762
But I can't...

602
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:49,931
How much damage have they done?

603
00:41:50,056 --> 00:41:51,349
The head of Manji killed my sister

604
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:53,601
Does he deserve to live?

605
00:42:06,406 --> 00:42:09,201
Kill Mikey?

606
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:12,120
How am I supposed to do that?

607
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:15,748
Think outsiders can just

608
00:42:15,915 --> 00:42:17,875
walk in here and leave alive?

609
00:42:20,128 --> 00:42:21,129

610
00:42:21,296 --> 00:42:23,673
There you are, Takemitchy!

611
00:42:27,594 --> 00:42:29,304
Hey. Watch your back

612

613

but reckless too

to pick a fight with someone tougher

701
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,992
You remind me of him

00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:58,617
Wanna fight or not?

762
00:54:01,996 --> 00:54:03,164
I wanna fight

763
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:07,043
I wanna kill them!

764
00:54:11,672 --> 00:54:12,714
Of course you do

765
00:54:14,633 --> 00:54:15,759
Hey!

766
00:54:17,178 --> 00:54:19,263
Anybody here gonna feel troubled

767
00:54:19,346 --> 00:54:21,515
if we avenge Pah's buddy?

768
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:25,352
Anybody here

769
00:54:25,436 --> 00:54:27,688
wanna make peace with Moebius?

770
00:54:33,027 --> 00:54:35,529
Nobody, right?

771
00:54:42,995 --> 00:54:44,080
It's decided

772
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:49,251
We crush Moebius!

773
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:04,725
July 13

774
00:55:05,351 --> 00:55:07,519
Showdown at Musashi Festival

775
00:55:11,565 --> 00:55:13,567
Whoa!

776
00:55:15,194 --> 00:55:17,738
So this is Toman's boss...

777
00:55:49,686 --> 00:55:50,980
What, punk?

778
00:55:57,945 --> 00:56:02,283
Mikey may be a good guy after all

779
00:56:03,617 --> 00:56:04,535
Sano, a good guy?

780
00:56:04,618 --> 00:56:05,577
Are you kidding?

781
00:56:05,702 --> 00:56:07,538
He's the head of Tokyo Manji Gang

782
00:56:07,621 --> 00:56:09,748
I know that's bad

783
00:56:09,873 --> 00:56:12,251
- But he's not really evil...   - What are you saying?

784
00:56:12,334 --> 00:56:13,877
Forgive Sano for killing my sister?

785
00:56:13,961 --> 00:56:14,795
Never!

786
00:56:14,878 --> 00:56:16,547
I wish I could kill him!

787
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,632
I swear, he's not like that!

788
00:56:19,633 --> 00:56:21,969
When Hina slapped him

789
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:24,096
he just laughed and forgave her

790
00:56:24,596 --> 00:56:27,641
He's capable of laughing!

791
00:56:31,979 --> 00:56:33,730
The Tokyo Manji Gang of today

792
00:56:33,939 --> 00:56:36,067
isn't what Mikey envisioned

793
00:56:37,568 --> 00:56:39,861
So I want to talk to him in person

794
00:56:40,904 --> 00:56:42,823
Ask him why Toman changed

795
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:43,865
I don't care

796
00:56:43,949 --> 00:56:45,826
Just go back in time, kill Sano

797
00:56:45,951 --> 00:56:47,411
and destroy Toman

798
00:56:47,619 --> 00:56:50,081
It's the only way to save my sister!

799
00:56:51,999 --> 00:56:55,336
Nobody can see him now anyway

800
00:56:55,461 --> 00:56:58,505
Unless you know someone in their executive ranks

801
00:57:01,008 --> 00:57:02,884
Do I?

802
00:57:10,809 --> 00:57:12,103
That's Akkun!

803
00:57:12,978 --> 00:57:15,772
Atsushi Sendo isn't a member

804
00:57:16,857 --> 00:57:19,360
He was arrested for stabbing Kiyomasa

805
00:57:19,526 --> 00:57:20,902
I stopped him

806
00:57:23,489 --> 00:57:26,450
I stopped him, didn't I?

807
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,202
I did...

808
00:57:29,036 --> 00:57:32,498
Things are a little off

809
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:35,167
What do you mean?

810
00:57:39,463 --> 00:57:40,547
Takemichi

811
00:57:41,548 --> 00:57:44,635
Even if you meet Sendo, don't say anything

812
00:57:45,886 --> 00:57:47,513
Aren't you coming?

813
00:57:48,013 --> 00:57:51,142
They're Toman. I'm a cop

814
00:57:52,851 --> 00:57:54,103
Welcome

815
00:57:57,189 --> 00:57:58,315
Good evening

816
00:57:59,191 --> 00:58:00,817
Any preferences?

817
00:58:02,027 --> 00:58:03,487
Akkun...

818
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:07,616
You must be Mr. Hanagaki, the owner's friend

819
00:58:08,742 --> 00:58:10,077
He's in the VIP Room

820
00:58:11,412 --> 00:58:12,413
Owner...

821
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:57,124
Long time, no see, Takemichi

822
00:59:02,129 --> 00:59:03,255
Long time...

823
00:59:05,257 --> 00:59:06,300
I...

824
00:59:08,969 --> 00:59:11,222
was waiting for you

825
00:59:21,148 --> 00:59:22,316
Wow

826
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:33,369
You're lucky, Takemichi

827
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:35,496
You haven't changed at all

828
00:59:38,332 --> 00:59:40,334
I wish I had, but...

829
00:59:41,918 --> 00:59:44,129
You stay the way you are

830
00:59:45,964 --> 00:59:49,009
So you own this huge club

831
00:59:50,511 --> 00:59:53,096
We live in different worlds

832
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:01,021
But my world is empty

833
01:00:09,321 --> 01:00:13,074
The guy with you was a cop, right?

834
01:00:16,912 --> 01:00:19,039
Uh, no...

835
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,041
Naoto Tachibana

836
01:00:22,876 --> 01:00:25,337
Hinata's brother

837
01:00:29,049 --> 01:00:33,429
He saved you on the train tracks that day

838
01:00:38,225 --> 01:00:39,393
How'd you know?

839
01:00:43,689 --> 01:00:44,981
Because it was me...

840
01:00:49,403 --> 01:00:50,571
That day

841
01:00:53,073 --> 01:00:55,367
I pushed you off the platform

842
01:01:00,664 --> 01:01:01,790
It was me

843
01:01:18,932 --> 01:01:20,100
It can't be...

844
01:01:20,267 --> 01:01:21,602
It's true

845
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:26,147
- I tried to kill you   - Stop it!

846
01:01:28,359 --> 01:01:30,652
It's not even funny!

847
01:01:34,448 --> 01:01:35,616
Akkun...

848
01:01:38,452 --> 01:01:39,786
You would never...

849
01:01:49,713 --> 01:01:51,006
You were gonna stab Kiyomasa

850
01:01:51,089 --> 01:01:53,258
to save Takuya

851
01:01:55,135 --> 01:01:57,178
You're tough, but kind-hearted...

852
01:01:59,306 --> 01:02:00,432
I...

853
01:02:02,976 --> 01:02:05,437
consider you my best friend!

854
01:02:08,315 --> 01:02:09,983
It's been 10 years

855
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:13,069
but that...

856
01:02:15,614 --> 01:02:17,616
has never changed!

857
01:02:28,627 --> 01:02:29,878
That's nice to hear

858
01:02:32,088 --> 01:02:34,383
But I still tried to kill you

859
01:02:42,974 --> 01:02:46,812
I'm Kisaki's slave now

860
01:02:50,774 --> 01:02:52,901
I'm terrified of him

861
01:02:54,861 --> 01:02:58,198
You haven't progressed at all in 10 years

862
01:03:04,037 --> 01:03:06,582
How did it come to this?

863
01:03:07,624 --> 01:03:10,293
Toman wasn't like this 10 years ago

864
01:03:15,632 --> 01:03:17,300
Once Draken died

865
01:03:18,677 --> 01:03:20,429
Mikey changed

866
01:03:23,306 --> 01:03:24,850
Draken...

867
01:03:27,394 --> 01:03:28,687
died?

868
01:03:30,814 --> 01:03:33,066
He shouldn't have died

869
01:03:49,541 --> 01:03:50,584
Hey

870
01:03:55,088 --> 01:03:57,215
You can travel through time, right?

871
01:04:02,429 --> 01:04:06,224
That's the only way certain things make sense

872
01:04:10,186 --> 01:04:12,731
How did you know that I tried

873
01:04:14,733 --> 01:04:16,443
to stab Kiyomasa?

874
01:04:19,946 --> 01:04:22,032
How did Naoto Tachibana know

875
01:04:22,866 --> 01:04:25,118
you were going to fall on the tracks?

876
01:04:49,142 --> 01:04:50,143
What?

877
01:04:51,144 --> 01:04:53,104
I wish we could stay innocent

878
01:04:53,188 --> 01:04:55,148
like we were back then

879
01:04:55,398 --> 01:04:57,568
Ow! That hurts!

880
01:04:57,651 --> 01:04:59,653
- Does it?   - Yeah!

881
01:05:00,487 --> 01:05:03,156
Wait. My nose is running

882
01:05:14,501 --> 01:05:15,502
Akkun

883
01:05:26,096 --> 01:05:27,806
I don't really understand

884
01:05:30,141 --> 01:05:32,227
but I know you're trying

885
01:05:36,982 --> 01:05:38,609
Akkun, be careful

886
01:05:42,362 --> 01:05:45,574
I kinda admired you back then

887
01:05:47,826 --> 01:05:49,870
Crying, but never giving up

888
01:05:52,038 --> 01:05:54,040
Akkun, watch out!

889
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:55,709
If...

890
01:05:57,711 --> 01:05:59,546
you can really go back...

891
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:10,724
save everyone, will ya?

892
01:06:13,059 --> 01:06:14,728
Crybaby hero

893
01:06:20,025 --> 01:06:21,067
Akkun

894
01:06:22,986 --> 01:06:24,070
Akkun!

895
01:06:28,867 --> 01:06:30,827
Akkun!

896
01:06:30,911 --> 01:06:31,870
Takemichi!

897
01:06:41,421 --> 01:06:43,757
No! Akkun!

898
01:06:58,438 --> 01:07:02,943
[ THE MIZO HIGH 5 ]

899
01:07:06,947 --> 01:07:08,198
Are you OK?

900
01:07:10,992 --> 01:07:12,452
They want to question me

901
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,121
I'll go

902
01:07:15,622 --> 01:07:16,414
It's fine

903
01:07:17,332 --> 01:07:18,959
I filled them in

904
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:21,419
Please rest for a while

905
01:07:25,799 --> 01:07:26,925
Naoto...

906
01:07:31,387 --> 01:07:32,973
Find out about the day...

907
01:07:37,894 --> 01:07:40,480
Draken...Ken Ryuguji, died

908
01:07:40,647 --> 01:07:42,065
You should calm down...

909
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:44,317
Just do it!

910
01:07:49,656 --> 01:07:51,032
Akkun said...

911
01:07:53,326 --> 01:07:55,871
Mikey changed when Draken died

912
01:07:56,037 --> 01:07:57,789
If Draken didn't die

913
01:07:59,082 --> 01:08:01,084
Toman wouldn't be like this

914
01:08:02,669 --> 01:08:04,170
Ryuguji was stabbed to death

915
01:08:04,337 --> 01:08:07,340
by a fellow gang member

916
01:08:07,966 --> 01:08:09,259
They were still minors

917
01:08:09,342 --> 01:08:10,677
so their names aren't disclosed

918
01:08:11,803 --> 01:08:13,013
I'll find out

919
01:08:19,686 --> 01:08:21,396
I had my doubts

920
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:23,231
if I could save Hina

921
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:27,819
If I could change anything

922
01:08:35,702 --> 01:08:37,537
But it's not a matter of "if"

923
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:40,331
I just have to do it

924
01:08:43,209 --> 01:08:46,755
You've changed, Takemichi

925
01:08:51,885 --> 01:08:53,929
Who cares if I've changed?

926
01:08:54,846 --> 01:08:56,807
Destiny has to be changed

927
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:01,227
Takemichi...

928
01:09:02,228 --> 01:09:04,272
You don't know anything yet!

929
01:09:04,355 --> 01:09:06,107
Why'd you shake my hand, you idiot!

930
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:12,197
Makoto's crotch turned black

931
01:09:12,447 --> 01:09:14,074
from all that scratching

932
01:09:14,532 --> 01:09:15,826
Hilarious, huh?

933
01:09:18,536 --> 01:09:19,579
Akkun?

934
01:09:21,414 --> 01:09:23,583
- It's Akkun!   - Huh?

935
01:09:23,708 --> 01:09:27,628
- Akkun! It's you!   - What the hell, dude?

936
01:09:31,257 --> 01:09:32,258
Ow!

937
01:09:37,097 --> 01:09:39,099
Stop it, you idiot

938
01:09:39,474 --> 01:09:41,684
What's your problem, Takemichi?

939
01:09:42,227 --> 01:09:43,353
You're alive...

940
01:09:45,188 --> 01:09:46,439
You're alive...

941
01:09:51,111 --> 01:09:52,570
Sorry, Akkun

942
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:54,447
I have to go to see Naoto!

943
01:09:55,949 --> 01:09:57,743
That idiot shook my hand

944
01:09:57,909 --> 01:09:59,953
before telling me anything!

945
01:10:03,915 --> 01:10:05,792
What's with him?

946
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:11,297
Akkun!

947
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:15,260
Your dream of becoming a hair stylist!

948
01:10:15,886 --> 01:10:17,262
You will be!

949
01:10:18,805 --> 01:10:20,640
I know it!

950
01:10:23,268 --> 01:10:25,145
Of course I will!

951
01:10:27,814 --> 01:10:29,524
See you at school!

952
01:10:35,655 --> 01:10:36,823
Hawaii?

953
01:10:37,698 --> 01:10:38,909
That idiot!

954
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:41,828
On a school trip. Why?

955
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,246
Thanks!

956
01:10:43,329 --> 01:10:44,831
I'm off to Hawaii!

957
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:49,419
Are we still on for tomorrow?

958
01:10:53,006 --> 01:10:54,007
Tomorrow?

959
01:10:55,675 --> 01:10:56,676
On for what?

960
01:10:56,968 --> 01:11:00,513
You promised we'd go to the Musashi Festival

961
01:11:01,681 --> 01:11:03,850
Crush Moebius!

962
01:11:04,184 --> 01:11:08,063
Ryuguji was stabbed in the stomach by a fellow gang member

963
01:11:08,188 --> 01:11:09,355
July 13

964
01:11:09,856 --> 01:11:11,858
Showdown at Musashi Festival

965
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:14,569
- Showdown at Musashi Festival!   - Showdown?

966
01:11:14,861 --> 01:11:15,904
Moebius…

967
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:17,864
stabbed Draken

968
01:11:18,364 --> 01:11:20,158
- What day is it?   - The 12th

969
01:11:20,283 --> 01:11:21,117
Tomorrow...

970
01:11:21,242 --> 01:11:23,661
I just remembered something

971
01:11:28,374 --> 01:11:30,877
You always appear out of nowhere

972
01:11:32,545 --> 01:11:36,049
I have to stop the fight with Moebius!

973
01:11:36,883 --> 01:11:41,262
Or else Draken, Akkun and Hina will die!

974
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:46,226
[ SETAGAYA HOSPITAL ]

975
01:12:05,328 --> 01:12:07,747
That's Pah's best friend's girl

976
01:12:11,459 --> 01:12:14,587
Head crushed, left retina detached

977
01:12:15,588 --> 01:12:17,257
Bruised all over

978
01:12:17,757 --> 01:12:20,426
Scars on her face may never heal

979
01:12:25,015 --> 01:12:26,432
Moebius...

980
01:12:35,191 --> 01:12:36,901
Who the hell are you?

981
01:12:37,068 --> 01:12:39,695
You did this to my daughter?

982
01:12:40,363 --> 01:12:42,448
Go home, trash!

983
01:12:42,573 --> 01:12:44,742
- Dad!   - Go home, trash!

984
01:12:44,867 --> 01:12:47,078
We didn't touch her

985
01:12:53,793 --> 01:12:55,378
We're sorry

986
01:12:56,296 --> 01:12:58,131
Why are you bowing your head?

987
01:12:59,882 --> 01:13:01,634
- What the...?   - Just do it!

988
01:13:04,637 --> 01:13:06,597
It's our responsibility

989
01:13:10,101 --> 01:13:11,644
We are very sorry

990
01:13:18,234 --> 01:13:19,819
Does bowing your heads

991
01:13:20,903 --> 01:13:22,655
help my daughter heal?

992
01:13:23,156 --> 01:13:24,532
You worthless shits!

993
01:13:24,907 --> 01:13:25,741
Mikey!

994
01:13:25,866 --> 01:13:27,827
Dad, please...

995
01:13:30,496 --> 01:13:31,872
Why...?

996
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:36,461
Why would you do that to her?

997
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,759
Bring her back!

998
01:13:44,927 --> 01:13:47,180
Bring my daughter back!

999
01:14:18,211 --> 01:14:19,879
Toman members

1000
01:14:22,215 --> 01:14:23,966
have families too

1001
01:14:26,552 --> 01:14:28,096
People we love

1002
01:14:30,848 --> 01:14:33,059
We can't hurt innocent people

1003
01:14:35,061 --> 01:14:37,063
Or make them cry

1004
01:14:40,024 --> 01:14:42,026
We have to settle...

1005
01:14:42,902 --> 01:14:44,779
our feuds amongst ourselves

1006
01:14:47,573 --> 01:14:49,700
You don't have to bow your head

1007
01:14:52,245 --> 01:14:54,872
but have a heart

1008
01:15:01,546 --> 01:15:03,256
You're so nice, Kenchin

1009
01:15:09,429 --> 01:15:10,971
Sorry, Kenchin

1010
01:15:17,437 --> 01:15:19,980
I'm glad you're the one by my side

1011
01:15:29,615 --> 01:15:31,284
I knew it!

1012
01:15:33,203 --> 01:15:35,455
Draken is Mikey's conscience

1013
01:15:36,914 --> 01:15:38,458
As long as he's alive

1014
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:42,337
Toman won't change!

1015
01:15:48,926 --> 01:15:50,010
Wait!

1016
01:15:55,975 --> 01:15:58,144
Takemitchy. What's up?

1017
01:16:11,324 --> 01:16:13,117
The feud with Moebius

1018
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:15,953
Do you have to go?

1019
01:16:18,248 --> 01:16:19,665
What the hell?

1020
01:16:21,459 --> 01:16:23,669
You're out of line, punk!

1021
01:16:25,838 --> 01:16:27,089
Why?

1022
01:16:30,593 --> 01:16:32,637
I have a bad feeling about it

1023
01:16:34,972 --> 01:16:36,474
If you go on with it

1024
01:16:37,099 --> 01:16:39,185
someone may die

1025
01:16:42,188 --> 01:16:44,357
I've heard enough! Get lost!

1026
01:16:44,649 --> 01:16:47,360
I can't do that. I've...

1027
01:16:47,485 --> 01:16:49,195
I already decided

1028
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:51,113
to go head to head with Moebius

1029
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:52,240
Mikey!

1030
01:16:52,323 --> 01:16:53,199
Give it up!

1031
01:16:53,449 --> 01:16:54,534
Pah

1032
01:16:58,329 --> 01:17:00,290
What did you say?

1033
01:17:00,831 --> 01:17:02,542
Who's gonna die?

1034
01:17:06,379 --> 01:17:07,838
I can't...

1035
01:17:08,298 --> 01:17:11,050
You may have your reasons

1036
01:17:11,133 --> 01:17:12,968
but it's too late now

1037
01:17:13,135 --> 01:17:13,969
Mikey!

1038
01:17:14,094 --> 01:17:15,763
Moebius is here

1039
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:30,903
Moebius! It's starting already

1040
01:17:34,407 --> 01:17:36,617
We heard you wanted to fight

1041
01:17:37,201 --> 01:17:38,953
so here we are

1042
01:17:41,414 --> 01:17:43,249
We'll bill you for expenses!

1043
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:46,294
No! Don't fight!

1044
01:17:49,755 --> 01:17:52,049
That girl the other day was tougher than you

1045
01:17:58,264 --> 01:17:59,849
Osanai, you're a piece of shit

1046
01:17:59,974 --> 01:18:01,934
Just like I thought...

1047
01:18:06,772 --> 01:18:07,940
I'll kill him

1048
01:18:09,567 --> 01:18:10,776
He's mine

1049
01:18:17,283 --> 01:18:18,826
No, Pah!

1050
01:18:19,076 --> 01:18:20,828
You can't fight Moebius

1051
01:18:26,584 --> 01:18:27,585
Who're you?

1052
01:18:43,309 --> 01:18:44,685
A boxer, huh?

1053
01:18:44,977 --> 01:18:45,978
Bring it!

1054
01:18:51,484 --> 01:18:53,193
Come on, bring it!

1055
01:19:09,168 --> 01:19:10,002
Pah!

1056
01:19:10,169 --> 01:19:11,462
Shut up and watch

1057
01:19:11,629 --> 01:19:13,005
It's his fight

1058
01:19:28,354 --> 01:19:29,689
He's unconscious

1059
01:19:31,691 --> 01:19:33,317
Mikey! Stop them!

1060
01:19:33,443 --> 01:19:35,570
Why? He hasn't given up yet

1061
01:19:36,028 --> 01:19:37,154
It's gone too far

1062
01:19:38,197 --> 01:19:39,865
Too far, Mikey!

1063
01:19:56,215 --> 01:19:58,133
Stand there

1064
01:19:58,384 --> 01:20:01,011
and I'll show you what my Moebius hook looks like

1065
01:20:14,484 --> 01:20:15,568
Sorry...

1066
01:20:16,819 --> 01:20:18,112
I'm not worthy

1067
01:20:19,029 --> 01:20:20,322
Why?

1068
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:22,116
You haven't lost

1069
01:20:25,411 --> 01:20:27,246
What is he talking about?

1070
01:20:27,413 --> 01:20:30,290
How hasn't he lost?

1071
01:20:30,416 --> 01:20:31,876
On your knees!

1072
01:20:42,887 --> 01:20:44,555
Gonna fight, Mikey?

1073
01:20:49,894 --> 01:20:51,270
I'll kill you in 10 seconds

1074
01:21:10,122 --> 01:21:11,499
Whoever thinks Pah lost

1075
01:21:11,582 --> 01:21:12,958
step forward

1076
01:21:15,878 --> 01:21:17,421
I'll kill you

1077
01:21:21,634 --> 01:21:23,761
Toman is mine

1078
01:21:24,428 --> 01:21:25,971
As long as I'm the boss

1079
01:21:26,055 --> 01:21:27,640
no one loses

1080
01:21:30,476 --> 01:21:33,145
You're all property of Mikey now

1081
01:21:36,398 --> 01:21:38,609
From today, Moebius

1082
01:21:39,819 --> 01:21:41,946
belongs to Toman

1083
01:21:43,906 --> 01:21:45,199
Is it over?

1084
01:21:52,164 --> 01:21:53,583
Watch out, Mikey!

1085
01:22:08,514 --> 01:22:11,016
I couldn't... stop it

1086
01:22:14,061 --> 01:22:17,189
Wanna know why you lost?

1087
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:26,949
Because you're trash

1088
01:22:33,372 --> 01:22:35,207
That's why my hand hurts!

1089
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:41,338
He can't hear you anymore

1090
01:22:47,511 --> 01:22:48,638
You're right

1091
01:22:51,891 --> 01:22:53,517
Thanks Takemitchy

1092
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,227
You saved us

1093
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:13,328
Draken didn't die!

1094
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:15,915
The feud with Moebius is over!

1095
01:23:16,666 --> 01:23:18,333
Hinata is alive!

1096
01:23:18,417 --> 01:23:20,085
Akkun too!

1097
01:23:20,419 --> 01:23:22,087
Mission accomplished!

1098
01:23:29,178 --> 01:23:30,262
It was exactly

1099
01:23:31,764 --> 01:23:33,808
10 years ago today

1100
01:23:45,778 --> 01:23:49,907
Draken is alive right here

1101
01:23:54,453 --> 01:23:56,706
That will never disappear

1102
01:24:03,796 --> 01:24:05,380
Takemichi is there

1103
01:24:05,464 --> 01:24:07,758
10 years ago today

1104
01:24:11,929 --> 01:24:14,431
The victim was Hinata Tachibana

1105
01:24:14,514 --> 01:24:15,850
age 27...

1106
01:24:17,643 --> 01:24:19,979
Which one should we go for?

1107
01:24:21,271 --> 01:24:22,314
This one

1108
01:24:25,776 --> 01:24:28,028
- I did it!   - Wow!

1109
01:24:29,321 --> 01:24:32,491
Darn Takemichi, at the festival with Hina

1110
01:24:32,616 --> 01:24:34,702
Should we go tease them?

1111
01:24:34,785 --> 01:24:36,328
Grow up

1112
01:24:37,121 --> 01:24:39,539
So you're OK with Takemichi

1113
01:24:39,623 --> 01:24:41,709
losing his cherry today?

1114
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:48,298
Of course not! Never!

1115
01:25:10,362 --> 01:25:11,864
The seeds have been planted

1116
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,044
Let's take one each

1117
01:25:25,169 --> 01:25:26,879
I don't have a goldfish bowl

1118
01:25:27,046 --> 01:25:28,505
You can have this one

1119
01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:33,010
Moebius...

1120
01:25:36,889 --> 01:25:40,059
Sorry, Hina

1121
01:25:40,726 --> 01:25:41,560
What?

1122
01:25:41,727 --> 01:25:43,395
Wait right here

1123
01:25:44,063 --> 01:25:45,189
I'm really sorry!

1124
01:25:52,905 --> 01:25:55,240
Mikey's late

1125
01:25:57,743 --> 01:25:59,745
Kenchin's late

1126
01:26:03,582 --> 01:26:05,084
Why is Moebius here?

1127
01:26:09,839 --> 01:26:10,923
Kiyomasa...

1128
01:26:19,181 --> 01:26:22,101
Draken kicked me out of Toman

1129
01:26:23,102 --> 01:26:24,436
I lost everything

1130
01:26:25,104 --> 01:26:26,856
But he's a monster

1131
01:26:27,189 --> 01:26:29,441
You can't take him head on

1132
01:26:30,109 --> 01:26:33,612
So stab him when he's down

1133
01:26:33,946 --> 01:26:36,406
Our feud's not over yet

1134
01:26:38,784 --> 01:26:39,910
The feud...

1135
01:26:40,577 --> 01:26:42,079
isn't over yet

1136
01:26:42,412 --> 01:26:44,331
Destiny hasn't been changed!

1137
01:26:46,125 --> 01:26:47,793
Draken will be stabbed

1138
01:26:49,628 --> 01:26:50,712
by Kiyomasa!

1139
01:26:58,137 --> 01:27:01,181
Kiyomasa! Found a live one

1140
01:27:01,306 --> 01:27:04,143
What's up, Draken?

1141
01:27:07,146 --> 01:27:08,563
Thought it was over?

1142
01:27:09,398 --> 01:27:11,483
Crush 'em one at a time!

1143
01:27:12,276 --> 01:27:14,736
Moebius is late

1144
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:17,823
They're under us, right?

1145
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,993
We have to make that clear!

1146
01:27:25,330 --> 01:27:27,249
Who said they were coming here?

1147
01:27:27,499 --> 01:27:30,752
Osanai. Unit 3 got the message

1148
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:32,504
Not me. Must've been Unit 2

1149
01:27:32,671 --> 01:27:33,923
It wasn't you?

1150
01:27:37,801 --> 01:27:39,386
We've been duped...

1151
01:27:39,511 --> 01:27:41,513
- Out of my way   - Hey, Mikey!

1152
01:27:46,977 --> 01:27:48,896
Someone may die

1153
01:28:10,375 --> 01:28:11,751
Who the hell are you?

1154
01:28:30,896 --> 01:28:33,899
Draken shouldn't be by your side

1155
01:28:35,734 --> 01:28:36,860
It should be me

1156
01:29:13,063 --> 01:29:14,273
What are you looking at?

1157
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:19,278
Bring it on!

1158
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:23,032
You monster

1159
01:29:28,787 --> 01:29:30,789
You think hanging with Mikey

1160
01:29:30,956 --> 01:29:33,125
made you tough?

1161
01:29:35,961 --> 01:29:37,046
Sit!

1162
01:29:44,678 --> 01:29:49,016
You stink, slave

1163
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:52,477
Anything to say?

1164
01:29:56,815 --> 01:29:58,275
I'm sorry

1165
01:29:58,483 --> 01:29:59,818
He's saying something

1166
01:29:59,985 --> 01:30:01,153
Louder

1167
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,404
I'm sorry

1168
01:30:11,455 --> 01:30:12,747
Takemichi...

1169
01:30:16,418 --> 01:30:17,586
Takemichi!

1170
01:30:21,506 --> 01:30:23,050
Are you OK?

1171
01:30:24,426 --> 01:30:26,720
- Hina   - I'll take these off

1172
01:30:30,932 --> 01:30:32,684
Leave me alone

1173
01:30:35,479 --> 01:30:36,896
Leave me alone!

1174
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:49,826
If I were...

1175
01:30:51,703 --> 01:30:53,330
Draken...

1176
01:30:55,374 --> 01:30:57,042
Or Mikey...

1177
01:30:58,335 --> 01:31:00,545
This would be nothing

1178
01:31:03,298 --> 01:31:04,883
Shit!

1179
01:31:09,054 --> 01:31:12,391
I can't do anything

1180
01:31:14,684 --> 01:31:16,686
I'm just a piece of trash!

1181
01:31:19,648 --> 01:31:21,400
No matter how hard I try

1182
01:31:22,984 --> 01:31:24,569
I can't change anything

1183
01:31:27,656 --> 01:31:29,491
I can't save anyone

1184
01:32:06,278 --> 01:32:07,946
I told you

1185
01:32:10,031 --> 01:32:12,117
You're strong

1186
01:32:17,122 --> 01:32:19,624
Remember when we first met?

1187
01:32:21,084 --> 01:32:24,129
- Let's go   - I can't

1188
01:32:24,254 --> 01:32:26,298
I'm not asking. Come with me

1189
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:29,551
Wanna be crushed?

1190
01:32:32,346 --> 01:32:34,598
Punk? Talking to me?

1191
01:32:34,723 --> 01:32:36,141
I can't stand it anymore

1192
01:32:36,475 --> 01:32:38,185
I'll crush you!

1193
01:32:41,938 --> 01:32:44,649
How does it feel?

1194
01:32:44,941 --> 01:32:46,025
Who're you talking to?

1195
01:32:46,109 --> 01:32:47,236
Wipe it up!

1196
01:32:47,402 --> 01:32:48,653
The floor's a mess

1197
01:32:49,154 --> 01:32:50,322
Yes, sir!

1198
01:32:56,411 --> 01:32:58,872
What? You next?

1199
01:32:58,955 --> 01:33:01,333
I'll shred you, punk!

1200
01:33:03,293 --> 01:33:04,336
Please stop!

1201
01:33:04,419 --> 01:33:07,005
I don't want to be shredded or crushed!

1202
01:33:07,172 --> 01:33:09,174
Girl, call the police!

1203
01:33:09,841 --> 01:33:12,219
- This guy's crazy!   - Fly away, birdie!

1204
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:19,518
Um...

1205
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:23,021
Sorry

1206
01:33:24,356 --> 01:33:26,358
I couldn't think of any other way...

1207
01:33:28,693 --> 01:33:30,487
You say, "I can't do it"

1208
01:33:31,363 --> 01:33:33,907
"I'm shaking in my pants"

1209
01:33:35,825 --> 01:33:37,744
But you always try your best

1210
01:33:42,374 --> 01:33:44,501
You're not Draken

1211
01:33:46,545 --> 01:33:48,213
Or Mikey...

1212
01:33:54,344 --> 01:33:56,763
You sob out loud for others

1213
01:33:58,557 --> 01:34:00,434
You grit your teeth

1214
01:34:03,687 --> 01:34:05,397
Even if that's all you can do

1215
01:34:08,692 --> 01:34:10,694
that's you, Takemichi

1216
01:34:15,824 --> 01:34:18,076
The guy

1217
01:34:20,203 --> 01:34:21,746
I love

1218
01:34:46,688 --> 01:34:49,232
Are you OK?

1219
01:34:53,362 --> 01:34:54,446
No!

1220
01:34:58,575 --> 01:35:02,287
No! This is me!

1221
01:35:09,628 --> 01:35:11,129
I may be pitiful

1222
01:35:14,299 --> 01:35:16,551
but I'm gonna protect you

1223
01:35:26,395 --> 01:35:30,815
I'll make it up to you,10 years from now

1224
01:35:34,486 --> 01:35:35,987
I'll come to see you

1225
01:35:50,251 --> 01:35:52,629
You can do it!

1226
01:36:24,869 --> 01:36:27,997
I'm really outnumbered here...

1227
01:36:30,875 --> 01:36:32,377
Give up now

1228
01:36:33,545 --> 01:36:35,589
You gonna take them all on?

1229
01:36:36,381 --> 01:36:38,091
I knew you were stupid

1230
01:36:38,174 --> 01:36:39,884
but are you deaf, too?

1231
01:36:42,721 --> 01:36:45,890
I'm not alone

1232
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:51,229
That's Mikey's motorbike

1233
01:37:11,082 --> 01:37:13,209
Hey, big boy

1234
01:37:13,793 --> 01:37:15,629
What's your name again?

1235
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,714
Mikey!

1236
01:37:17,839 --> 01:37:21,134
Osanai! Whose hair are you pulling?

1237
01:37:21,259 --> 01:37:22,719
Mitsuya, Unit 2...

1238
01:37:22,844 --> 01:37:24,345
He's tough

1239
01:37:24,471 --> 01:37:28,141
How many of them are there?

1240
01:37:28,224 --> 01:37:30,393
Don't bother counting

1241
01:37:30,727 --> 01:37:33,312
You made us wait so you could attack Kenchin

1242
01:37:36,608 --> 01:37:37,776
So what if we did?

1243
01:37:37,942 --> 01:37:40,194
Whose plan is this?

1244
01:37:41,112 --> 01:37:43,031
You don't need to know

1245
01:37:43,698 --> 01:37:45,742
'cause I'm gonna kill you anyway

1246
01:37:49,621 --> 01:37:51,122
Still alive, Kenchin?

1247
01:37:54,626 --> 01:37:56,377
It's festival day!

1248
01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:00,965
I'm ready to party!

1249
01:38:02,967 --> 01:38:05,762
Stop blabbering!

1250
01:38:06,471 --> 01:38:07,806
Kill 'em!

1251
01:38:08,848 --> 01:38:10,183
Crush 'em!

1252
01:38:54,435 --> 01:38:55,604
I'm getting tired

1253
01:39:11,369 --> 01:39:15,373
The end of peace for Toman

1254
01:40:09,761 --> 01:40:12,430
The war's started

1255
01:40:27,278 --> 01:40:28,321
Draken!

1256
01:40:36,204 --> 01:40:37,288
Kiyomasa!

1257
01:40:49,884 --> 01:40:51,928
Right to the liver

1258
01:40:52,929 --> 01:40:54,222
It's over

1259
01:41:04,899 --> 01:41:05,984
Draken!

1260
01:41:24,335 --> 01:41:28,882
Draken... been stabbed!

1261
01:41:34,846 --> 01:41:35,847
Draken!

1262
01:41:37,015 --> 01:41:39,851
Draken!

1263
01:41:44,313 --> 01:41:45,899
Move!

1264
01:41:49,610 --> 01:41:51,570
Worry about yourself!

1265
01:42:09,672 --> 01:42:10,799
He's alive!

1266
01:42:13,051 --> 01:42:14,052
He's alive!

1267
01:42:15,219 --> 01:42:16,930
Draken's still alive!

1268
01:42:20,058 --> 01:42:22,268
Takemitchy! Take care of him

1269
01:42:25,354 --> 01:42:26,480
Who, me?

1270
01:42:30,985 --> 01:42:31,820
Me...

1271
01:42:38,076 --> 01:42:39,577
You're all he's got!

1272
01:42:53,174 --> 01:42:54,342
I won't...

1273
01:42:58,179 --> 01:43:01,474
...let anyone die!

1274
01:43:19,242 --> 01:43:20,785
Sorry, no passage

1275
01:43:21,202 --> 01:43:22,787
Hanagakiiiii!

1276
01:43:33,131 --> 01:43:34,757
Go Takemichi!

1277
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:36,843
We owe them!

1278
01:43:37,468 --> 01:43:39,804
Takemichi! You're still a virgin, right?

1279
01:43:48,938 --> 01:43:50,731
I called the ambulance

1280
01:43:52,942 --> 01:43:54,235
Just a little...

1281
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:57,989
Further...

1282
01:44:11,502 --> 01:44:14,463
You should've minded your own business

1283
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:31,730
Thanks

1284
01:44:33,524 --> 01:44:34,984
Takemitchy

1285
01:44:37,278 --> 01:44:38,821
I'm heavy, huh?

1286
01:44:42,158 --> 01:44:46,829
I'll take care of my own shit

1287
01:44:49,874 --> 01:44:51,042
Let me down

1288
01:44:53,211 --> 01:44:54,378
I'll fight him

1289
01:45:27,036 --> 01:45:28,162
Draken

1290
01:45:31,832 --> 01:45:33,709
Think I'd run away?

1291
01:45:34,793 --> 01:45:36,587
Be scared shitless?

1292
01:45:40,424 --> 01:45:42,218
Who do you think I am?

1293
01:45:46,597 --> 01:45:48,724
Shut up and rest

1294
01:45:51,936 --> 01:45:53,354
This is my fight!

1295
01:46:12,373 --> 01:46:14,458
This is my life...

1296
01:46:17,878 --> 01:46:19,047
My revenge!

1297
01:46:23,592 --> 01:46:24,969
What are you talking about?

1298
01:46:25,261 --> 01:46:26,470
Let's settle this

1299
01:46:29,307 --> 01:46:31,225
Gladiator style!

1300
01:46:35,646 --> 01:46:37,606
Then I'll...

1301
01:46:42,486 --> 01:46:45,114
bet a 100 million on Takemitchy

1302
01:46:55,666 --> 01:46:57,543
Wanna die?

1303
01:46:57,668 --> 01:47:00,254
No one wants to die, you idiot!

1304
01:47:15,519 --> 01:47:16,645
I...

1305
01:47:18,481 --> 01:47:20,274
always blamed you

1306
01:47:24,862 --> 01:47:25,904
Get up

1307
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:46,592
I thought it was your fault

1308
01:47:48,886 --> 01:47:51,305
my life was screwed up

1309
01:48:03,984 --> 01:48:07,738
But that's bullshit!

1310
01:48:09,698 --> 01:48:13,077
Persistent idiot!

1311
01:48:33,389 --> 01:48:34,473
You...

1312
01:48:35,933 --> 01:48:38,602
...don't deserve to change my life!

1313
01:49:06,922 --> 01:49:09,007
I'll take you down now

1314
01:49:09,342 --> 01:49:11,885
and change my own destiny!

1315
01:49:16,890 --> 01:49:21,145
Don't bite me, you lame piece of shit!

1316
01:49:21,979 --> 01:49:25,483
So what if I'm lame? Or pitiful?

1317
01:49:29,153 --> 01:49:30,404
That's me...

1318
01:49:31,447 --> 01:49:34,492
Takemichi Hanagaki!

1319
01:50:38,347 --> 01:50:40,182
Mitsuya, Pah

1320
01:50:40,724 --> 01:50:42,310
You alive?

1321
01:50:49,733 --> 01:50:50,818
I got some juice left

1322
01:50:53,987 --> 01:50:55,113
What about Draken?

1323
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:07,876
Boss!

1324
01:51:08,377 --> 01:51:10,504
- Yo   - You're late, Mikey!

1325
01:51:10,588 --> 01:51:11,630
