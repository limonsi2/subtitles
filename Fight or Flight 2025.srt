00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,080
Just a minute!

521
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,560
(FOOTSTEPS SQUELCH)

522
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
(BANGING ON DOOR)

523
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,080
I'm a sky marshal, open the door.

524
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,480
(PHONE BEEPS)

525
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,520
(SOFTLY) FFFFuck.

526
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,800
(PHONE CLICKS)
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

527
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,960
I've been airsick.

528
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,040
Sir, for the safety
of all passengers,

529
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,600
I'm going to need to ask you
a couple questions.

530
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Are you currently on narcotics?

531
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,440
Is he really a sky marshal?
You can vouch for him?

532
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,080
Excuse me?

533
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,160
Oh, my God. Is that blood dripping
from the ceiling?

534
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,800
(GUN COCKS)
(GASPS)

535
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,240
(CRASHES ONTO FLOOR)
Inside, both of you.

536
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,560
(WHIMPERS)

537
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,200
Oh, God.
(GLASS CRACKS UNDERFOOT)

538
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,040
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

539
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,080
(CLEARS THROAT)

540
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,480
(INHALES SLOWLY)

541
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
(SOFT, GRIPPING MUSIC)

542
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,640
I don't wanna have to use these.
(BOTH WHIMPER)

543
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,120
What do you want?

544
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,160
Uh... (SUCKS AIR IN)

545
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,680
Your help.
With what?

546
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,680
He's gonna kill us.
He's actually gonna kill us.

547
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,800
He's a bloody maniac in pink.
Stay calm.

548
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,160
Relax, OK? Just...
try to relax, calm down, OK?

549
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,720
There's another sky marshal on board.
He'll come looking for us.

550
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,400
(GASPS)
What the fuck?!

551
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,440
Exactly. Listen,
what I'm about to tell you guys

552
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,160
is gonna sound absolutely crazy,

553
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,480
but you're gonna have
to trust me.OK?

554
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,240
Why should we?

555
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I didn't kill him.

556
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,000
Well, him, I had to kill.
He made me. (INHALES)

557
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,200
He made you?
Mm.

558
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,040
Who are you?!

559
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm FBI.

560
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,840
(MOUTHS) FBI?
I...Identification?

561
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
(SIGHS)

562
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,640
Department of Justice
to Attache to Thailand.

563
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,640
Agent Lucas Daniel Reyes.
Officer number 808.

564
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,280
Sorry, but do you have a badge?
I don't have time for this shit!

565
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,080
This is the situation that you,
me and everyone else on board

566
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,840
suddenly find ourselves in.
Wait.

567
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,320
What?
I-I don't understand.

568
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,360
You're looking for someone
that's on this plane?

569
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,200
Yep.
And other people are looking too?

570
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,800
Uh-uh. (SIGHS)

571
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,280
To kill him?

572
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,640
Right.

573
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,560
That's just lovely, isn't it?
We need to tell the pilots.

574
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,080
Yes! Do that.

575
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,040
And find the other sky marshal.
Get me the manifest, all right?

576
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,200
And maybe...

577
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,960
put a sign on the door?

578
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,800
Let's go. No, wait!

579
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,960
Can you find me something
to change into?

580
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,040
Hm.

581
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Hmm.

582
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,720
(SIGHS)

583
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,680
All good?

584
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,520
Doesn't quite fit, but...
You're making it work.

585
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,480
Can you guys do something with this?

586
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,800
(BOTH GASP)What the fuck?!
For crying out loud!

587
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,720
I don't have a place to put it,
do I?

588
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,000
You cannot just walk round
this plane with a gun!

589
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,240
No shit. That's why I asked you
to do something with it.

590
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,440
What if...What if it goes off?

591
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,720
It won't, the safety's on.
The what?

592
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,240
That the manifest?
Yeah.

593
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,480
Oh, good. It's Ambien time.
Most people will be going to sleep.

594
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,200
We'll start with the
people that haven't.

595
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Mm...

596
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,000
You guys speak to the pilots?

597
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,640
No, not yet.

598
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,120
Go do that.

599
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,680
We'll start with this cabin.
We'll circle anyone who looks...

600
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,880
dubious. Yeah?
(SCOFFS SOFTLY)

601
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,160
Let's go.
Oh, no.

602
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,120
Oh, no, no, no...
What? What?

603
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,200
36D, they asked for
some peppermint tea 15 minutes ago.

604
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,840
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm sorry,

605
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,360
but I'm trying to do a job as well.
Hey, hey, hey!

606
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,640
Stop being such a little pusswah.
You don't understand.

607
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,160
I have extreme OCD
with these kind of things.

608
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,480
You know what?
Would you rather I knocked you out

609
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,200
and zip-tied you to the sky marshal?

610
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,680
Could I get the tea first?

611
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,640
Fine.

612
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

613
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,840
Yes, rear galley. Lower deck.
Get here right now.

614
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,120
What's up?
I found these in the bin.

615
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,320
Where does this go?
Down to the cargo hold.

616
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,240
(PANTS) What happened?

617
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,760
I need to go down to the cargo hold.
My God, is this blood?

618
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,720
Is there another way down,
or do I have to slide?

619
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,240
There is a way, but I don't know
if I'm the best person to...

620
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,280
I'll take you.
Right.

621
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,120
Yeah, you guys go ahead,
and I'll just...

622
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
keep an eye on things here.

623
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,080
That's him. That's the sky marshal.

624
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,480
(SOFTLY) Fuck.

625
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,400
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
I don't understand.

626
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,280
How is this possible?

627
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,440
Who is this guy
that you're looking for?

628
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,240
Are you hot?
What?

629
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,680
You're sweating.

630
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,760
That's a cold sweat.

631
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
It's your immune system fighting.

632
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,600
I used to do that too,
touch all the places I was wounded.

633
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,520
And I've been shot, stabbed,
burned, run over, you name it.

634
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,960
Gotta hand it to you. Flight
attendant's a pretty good cover.

635
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,200
Cover? This is my job.

636
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,880
Lift up your shirt.

637
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,440
Fuck you.

638
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,600
(LAUGHS) Goddamn it, man.

639
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,120
Everybody thinks
the Ghost is a middle-aged man.

640
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,600
And the Ghost is a what?
Like, what are you, 16?

641
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,240
The Ghost is a 16-year-old girl!

642
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,120
(LAUGHS)

643
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,600
You're crazy.

644
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,160
I-I can't even engage with this.

645
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,480
I've got a job to do.

646
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,280
Look out!

647
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,720
No!
(GUNSHOT)

648
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,040
What the hell are you thinking?

649
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,280
You could blow the fuselage
and get us all killed.

650
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,400
Only if you miss.

651
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,920
There you are.
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

652
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,600
You're bleeding.

653
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,520
I had an appendectomy.

654
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,560
(LAUGHS) Yeah, with a bullet.

655
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,400
You do realise that there are
dozens of people on the plane

656
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,360
looking to kill you, right?

657
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,600
And I'm the only person
that needs you alive.

658
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,040
No-one else knows who I am.
Is that how you wanna play it?

659
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,600
It took me 15 minutes
to figure out who you are.

660
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,920
It's a pretty long fucking flight.

661
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,440
Who hired you?

662
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,040
You're clearly not FBI.
I mean, look at you.

663
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,800
You're not even sober.

664
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,680
Getting way closer
than I'd like to be.

665
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,800
Look, I don't need your help.

666
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,000
I can take care of myself.

667
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,920
You don't get it.

668
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,840
There is no scenario

669
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,720
in which I do not hand you in
at the end of this flight.

670
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,680
That's cute.

671
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,000
But you do know I can't just
disappear for ten hours, right?

672
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,360
People will come looking for me.
We have security protocols.

673
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,520
Did you not think
any of this through?

674
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,720
Goddamn it.
What?

675
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,800
This is gonna be
so fucking annoying.

676
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,840
You mean I'm gonna be annoying?

677
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,120
Yeah.

678
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,120
Well, you're right.
Listen...

679
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,800
Isha the Ghost, here's the plan.

680
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,320
You'll stick with me and keep
your head down while I protect you

681
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,840
and we figure out
who we're up against. You got it?

682
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,640
No.
You got a better idea?

683
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,560
Yeah, I do. I've got lots, actually.

684
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,800
And they all have
one thing in common.

685
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,880
They don't include you.
They don't include me. Mm-hm.

686
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,560
Yeah, unfortunately
none of those are gonna work

687
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,680
because you're in my custody now.

688
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,680
Like I said...

689
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,720
you need me out there
doing flight-attendant shit,

690
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,640

1047
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,240
I was sold to
a child-trafficking ring at seven,

1048

worked for warlords,

1052

digitally exposed.

1060
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,800

I could bypass any firewall,
