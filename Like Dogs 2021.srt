166
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,379
I can hear you.

167
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:55,882
Do you know you snore?

168
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,096

it's okay.

171
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,147
Listening to you these past
few days, it's been the first

172
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,609
time I haven't felt alone
since this whole thing began.

173
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,362
- Uh, the past few days?

174
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,783
I was out that long?

175
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,535
- [5399] Did you know there's
other rooms like this?

176
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,620
At least two of 'em.

177
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,871
I saw them when they wheeled me
in here.

178
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,832
They thought I was
unconscious, but I wasn't.

179
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,751
Did you know that they also drug
our food?

180
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,003
Stopped eating that shit days
ago.

181
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,547
I know that must sound
crazy, but it's this place.

182
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,550
- Do you know where we are?

183
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,514
- [5399] Looks like some
sort of slaughter house.

184
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,521
- What do you think they want
from us?

185
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,231
- [5399] I'm not planning
on sticking around

186
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,482
long enough to find out.

187
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,947
- I'm with you there. (chuckles)

188
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,241
What's your, uh, what's
your name, crazy boy?

189
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,535
- [5399] Adam.

190
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,123
- Adam.

191
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,626
I'm, I'm Lisa.

192
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,797
And no offense, but I'm not 100%
convinced

193
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,299
that you're not some
figment of my overactive

194
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,052
and possibly chemically-altered
imagination right now,

195
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,888
so I'm gonna need some
proof of your existence.

196
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,017
I just wanna see you.

197
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,645
- I'm at the end of the aisle.

198
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,484
(chain clinks)
(groans)

199
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,902
See?

200
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,238
I'm real. (chuckles)

201
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,909
You have no idea how nice it
is to see a friendly face.

202
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,747
No, I guess you do.

203
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,457
(Lisa chuckles)

204
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:57,462
(alarm blares)
(door opens)

205
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,132
(plate clacks)

206
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,678
Don't eat it!

207
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,557
It makes you compliant.
It makes you hallucinate.

208
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,394
(alarm blares)

209
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,228
Please!

210
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,856
I need you to be lucid.

211
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,816
(door closes)
(sighs)

212
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,610
I don't wanna go through this
alone.

213
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:23,946
- Number one.

214
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,159
I'm as lucid as it gets.

215
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,078
Number two. You really
should eat something.

216
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,455
You're only making yourself
weaker.

217
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,957
And number three. (chuckles)

218
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:40,088
It appears we are in this
together, so we're not alone.

219
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,381
- You're right.

220
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,052
We're not alone.

221
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,933
(ominous music)

222
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,270
(Lisa sighs)

223
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,730
- How long has he been there?

224
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,235
- I don't know, but this isn't
the first time I've seen him.

225
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,196
There's three, maybe four of
them?

226
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,282
All they do is just stand there
and watch.

227
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,742
- Well, fuck them!

228
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,661
I'm not gonna give them
anything worth watching.

229
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,247
- How can you be so chill about
all this?

230
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,792
- Look, these fucking people
abducted us off the street,

231
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,586
are forcing to live in these
shitty concrete cubicles

232
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,839
and are treating us like god
damn dogs.

233
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,300
I don't give a fuck what they
think.

234
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:29,804
- [Captor] Eat.

235
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,557
Eat!

236
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,268
- Yeah, okay, I have a
bad feeling about this.

237
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,102
You, you should eat.

238
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,770
- [Captor] Eat, now!

239
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,898
- (spits) I won't.

240
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:41,732
- [Captor] Bad dog.

241
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,608
(alarm blares)

242
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,318
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

243
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,612
- Hey! Leave him alone.

244
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,114
- [Captor] Shut it, bitch!

245
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,241
(cattle prod zaps)

246
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,077
You've been a very bad dog.

247
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,954
- No! Please, please, please,
please!

248
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,581
(cattle prod zaps)

249
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,500
Do not fuck with me, boy.

250
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,336
(keyboard clacks)

251
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,344
(Lisa gasps)

252
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,806
(Lisa sighs)

253
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:24,692
- Adam?

254
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:31,949
Adam!

255
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,367
(ominous tones)

256
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:38,372
(door handle rattles)
- Help! Help!

257
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,876
(Lisa gasps)

258
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:48,049
(tense music)
(Lisa gasps and grunts)

259
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,031
- Fuck.

260
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,203
- [Adam] You curse a lot.

261
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,957
- Shit.

262
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:21,999
They moved us.

263
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,169
Are you okay?

264
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:27,964
- I'm all right.

265
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,676
Hey, look, I'm sorry they tased
you.

266
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,929
You didn't have to do that.

267
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,558
You don't have to help me, but
thank you.

268
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,395
(Lisa sighs)

269
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,562
Where did they take you?

270
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:46,899
- I don't know.

271
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,987
It was like a room smaller than
this.

272
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,656
Like a solitary confinement.

273
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,991
I had the weirdest fucking
dream.

274
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,035
I saw my ex-boyfriend
from like three years ago.

275
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,456
How long was I gone?

276
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,586
- I don't know.

277
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,963
- (sighs) Was it more
like an hour or a day?

278
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,591
- I can't remember the last time
I ate.

279
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:15,803
I feel like I'm starting to lose
it,

280
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,638
and when you're not here, I
just-

281
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,472
- Adam.

282
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,686
We're gonna be fine.
(Adam sighs)

283
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:24,520
I promise.

284
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,691
Tell me about your family.

285
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,905
- I'm the youngest of three
brothers.

286
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,199
By about eight years.

287
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,412
My oldest brother was the worst.

288
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:44,582
I remember sneaking into his
room one day after school.

289
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,625
He just bought himself
this brand new PlayStation

290
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,378
with all the money he saved
up from working all summer.

291
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,382
I knew he wasn't gonna
be home until after dark,

292
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,886
so I snuck in, lost track of
time,

293
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,723
and heard his angry voice at the
door.

294
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,726
He got home early from football
practice

295
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:07,688
and beat my kneecaps so
hard that I could not walk.

296
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,274
I had to grip the carpet
and claw my way out.

297
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,111
It was worth it.

298
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,573
- Brothers are the worst.

299
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,783
- [Adam] Hm?

300
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:22,870
- My mom worked a lot.
(chuckles)

301
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,624
And my older brother would
watch me when I was young.

302
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:33,089
Once he got his license he'd
tell her he was babysitting me,

303
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,341
but really he would
lock me in the basement

304
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,802
so I wouldn't get into
trouble while he was gone.

305
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,890
One time, my mom was away all
weekend,

306
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,436
and my brother went out, Friday
night,

307
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,855
and didn't come home until late,
Sunday.

308
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,234
She didn't find me until the
next morning.

309
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,070
My brother convinced her

310
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,740
that I locked myself in the
basement during the night.

311
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:04,703
She continued to let him watch
me for the next few years.

312
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:11,711
And every time, I ended up
locked in that basement.

313
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,589
I can't shake the feeling
that I'm still waiting

314
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,258
for someone to find me.

315
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,927
(Adam chuckles)

316
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,264
(Adam sighs)

317
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,266
(chuckles)

318
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,936
(alarm blares)
(door opens)

319
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,397
(plate clacks)

320
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,066
(plate scrapes)

321
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,237
(footsteps clack)

322
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,784
(plate scrapes)

323
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,994
(alarm blares)

324
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,078
(door slams)

325
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,746
- You sure you still wanna eat
that?

326
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,207
He literally just touched
that with a 10-foot pole.

327
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,667
(Lisa chuckles)

328
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,962
- Aww. You almost made a joke.
(giggles)

329
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:55,963
- I'm serious.

330
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,298
- Yeah, so am I.

331
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,092
Eat!

332
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,643
(Adam sighs)

333
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,902
- That's not bad.
(Lisa chuckles)

334
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,237
- Right? (chuckles)
- Mm-hm! (chuckles)

335
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,614
- All right.

336
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,990
It could just be that
we've been in here so long

337
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,450
that we're delusional, but...

338
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,701
(Adam laughs)

339
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,870
It isn't nearly as bad
as it looks. (giggles)

340
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,456
- Mm-hm! (chuckles)

341
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,875
(both laugh)

342
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:38,506
(Adam coughs)
(Lisa laughs)

343
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:43,511
(ominous music)
(both laugh)

344
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,721
(buzzing)

345
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,474
(peaceful music)

346
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,065
(Lisa chuckles)

347
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,527
(Lisa gasps)

348
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,905
(Lisa pants)

349
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,793
(Lisa sighs)

350
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,254
(Adam snores)

351
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,966
(Lisa sighs)

352
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,011
(Adam snores)

353
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,520
(Adam snores)

354
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,150
- Hey.

355
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,237
(Adam moans)

356
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,405
- [Adam] What?

357
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:49,618
- Turns out you snore, too.
(Adam chuckles)

358
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,787
- Hell, I could've told you
that.

359
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,955
(grunts)

360
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,623
- [Lisa] How do you feel?

361
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,916
(Adam inhales sharply)

362
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,586
- (sighs) Pretty good, actually.

363
00:22:58,586 --> 00:22:59,420
- Me too.

364
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,550
This is the best I've
slept since I got here.

365
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,594
- (chuckles) I don't care if
they are spiking our food,

366
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,512
I'll definitely have some more
of that.

367
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,640
Wow.

368
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,269
I can't believe I just said
that.

369
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,520
Wait a second.

370
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,397
What was the first thing
I said about the food?

371
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,732
- Something about hallucinating?

372
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,026
- Look at my eyes. Are my pupils
dilated?

373
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,904
(ominous tones)

374
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,742
- Your pupils look fine.

375
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,453
Okay, but let's not ignore
the elephant in the room.

376
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,246
They moved us in our sleep
again.

377
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,207
- If we whisper, they can't hear
us.

378
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,460
Now is the time to plan our
escape.

379
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,670
- Yeah, great. What you got in
mind?

380
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,135
Okay, well don't hit me
with all your ideas at once.

381
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:52,598
- I've got an idea. I just
need to work out a few details.

382
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,392
- Fine.

383
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,268
Keep your secrets.

384
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,647
Just, (sighs) relax.

385
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,107
You know, let it come to you.

386
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,942
(chuckles) Rome wasn't built in
a day.

387
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,444
- What about you? You got any
ideas?

388
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,946
- First thing, we have to
take off these collars.

389
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,115
I mean, as long as we have
these on, they can take down.

390
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,952
- Come here, let me see.

391
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,500
(both chuckle)

392
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,335
- You feel so warm.

393
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,378
- (chuckles) You too.

394
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,132
(sighs)

395
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,219
Look, I wouldn't wish this on
anyone,

396
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,889
but I'm so glad you're here.

397
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,435
- Me too.

398
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:42,481
- Promise me, if we get out-
- When we get out.

399
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,400
- When we get outta here,

400
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,028
we find the son of a
bitch that did this to us.

401
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,662
- [Captor] Uh, uh, uh!

402
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,663
No touching!

403
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,292
- Hey. You don't have to hide,
okay?

404
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,544
Fuck this guy!

405
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:05,838
- Just go to sleep.

406
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,842
We don't want him to separate
us.

407
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,096
(Lisa sighs)

408
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,139
(captor grunts)

409
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,975
- [Captor] You will not ignore
me.

410
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:20,978
- Adam.

411
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,772
(button clicks)

412
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,275
(collar hums)

413
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,028
(chokes)

414
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,741
(grunts and gasps)

415
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,117
- Lisa.

416
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,287
(Lisa gasps and chokes)

417
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,539
Lisa, hey! Are you okay?

418
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,000
(Lisa chokes)

419
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,293
Shut it off!

420
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,462
Shut if off! Come on, please!

421
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:50,340
(pants)
(Lisa groans)

422
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,803
(keyboard clacks)
(eerie music)

423
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,389
(alarm blares)
(door closes)

424
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,225
(plate scrapes)

425
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,061
(footsteps clack)

426
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,075
(plate scrapes)

427
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:22,122
(tense music)

428
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,707
(plate clangs)

429
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,459
- What are you doing?

430
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,753
- Getting out of here.

431
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,172
(keys clink)

432
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,259
(pants)

433
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,803
- We'll never make it out right
now, okay?

434
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,095
Look, they're watching us!

435
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:38,972
- Trust me.

436
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,308
This was my plan.

437
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:45,938
Okay.

438
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:46,772
(plate clangs)

439
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,691
(body clunks)

440
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,526
- Shit.

441
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,237
(sighs) May day.

442
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,698
May day! Pineapple pizza!

443
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:03,288
(alarm blares)
(doors open)

444
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,878
(door closes)

445
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,632
(computer chirps and bleeps)

446
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,824
- What the hell happened in
there?

447
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,076
Are you trying to make
our lives more difficult?

448
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,078
- I thought you had this under
control?

449
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,705
- I do!

450
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,124
I mean, I did. It just,
it happened so fast.

451
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:49,626
- I told you this was a bad
idea.

452
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,461
- Adam is an unknown variable.

453
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,589
That makes him
unpredictable and dangerous.

454
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,176
- Lisa, this is not what we had
in mind

455
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,012
when we developed the
experiment.

456
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,346
- Yeah, let's talk about that.

457
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,223
I mean, since when did
this behavioral experiment

458
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,183
involve electric shock
and psychotropic drugs?

459
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,936
- [George] Fine, fine.
We'll deactivate the fences.

460
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,938
But I'm keeping the cattle prod.

461
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,150
- Who said anything
about psychotropic drugs?

462
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,860
We're administering a mild
sedative

463
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,528
to keep the subjects obedient.

464
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,322
- "Obedient."

465
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,074
How do you explain what I saw in
solitary?

466
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,952
- Look, I'm not gonna say
you didn't hallucinate,

467
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,539
but you're probably just
malnourished and dehydrated.

468
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,373
Eat.

469
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,252
- Look, you don't have to
continue,

470
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,463
if you feel like you're
putting your health at risk.

471
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,423
There are plenty of other
subjects.

472
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,969
(door closes)

473
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,472
Room three is particularly
fascinating.

474
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,057
We're integrating two alphas-

475
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,684
- From rival fraternities on
campus.

476
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,353
And once we introduce a female
in there,

477
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,480
it's gonna get primal.

478
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,565
(laughs)

479
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,151
- Honestly?

480
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,570
It might be for the best
if we pull you two out

481
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,781
before anyone else gets hurt.

482
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,032
- And how exactly

483
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,785
are you gonna explain
this to Adam anyways?

484
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,162
I mean, at least everyone
here is getting paid for this.

485
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,956
- I told you. I have a plan for
that.

486
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,749
- What're you gonna say?

487
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,709
"Oh, sorry I kept you chained
up.

488
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,003
Uh, thanks for not calling the
cops."

489
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,214
Or were you hoping to get
him so sexually aroused

490
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,049
that all the blood runs
to his little dick,

491
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,926
and he forgets everything
that happened here? (laughs)

492
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,970
- Stop.
- What? That shit's funny.

493
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,596
- It's funny.
- Yeah, laugh it up.

494
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,765
But if Fischer finds out about
any of this

495
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,102
off-the-record shit, she's
gonna have our asses.

496
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,478
You know, she demanded to be
informed

497
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,563
the moment anything out
of the ordinary happened.

498
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,815
- Where is Fischer now?

499
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,528
- Home, asleep? It's almost
three AM.

500
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,406
- Why the fuck are you feeding
us at three in the morning?

501
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,577
(phone rings)

502
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,580
(suspenseful music)

503
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,251
(phone rings)

504
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,335
- Shh! Quiet!

505
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,882
Hey, what're you doing up?

506
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,386
Yeah, well, the power just went
out,

507
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,472
so the cameras are offline
until we can reset the router.

508
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,849
The network in this building is
terrible.

509
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,351
You know, if you had just
let me hard wire this...

510
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,232
No, you do not need to come down
here.

511
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,442
We'll have the cameras back up

512
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,027
and running within five minutes.

513
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,320
10 minutes, tops. Okay?

514
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:27,743
And she hung up.

515
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,204
- Fuck.

516
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,250
- You're welcome?

517
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,084
- For?

518
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,294
- For killing the cameras,

519
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,337
when your boyfriend
pulled his little stunt.

520
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,965
You're lucky the livestream
is on a 10-second delay.

521
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,178
- I could kiss you right now,
George.

522
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,596
- Tease.

523
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,764
- I have to go back in.

524
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:51,975
I have come too far to quit now.

525
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,519
- Fine. I just bought you 10
minutes.

526
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,522
Do what you need to do, then
you're going back in your cage.

527
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,861
(Lisa sighs)

528
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,863
Did you see me, how I
just handled Fischer?

529
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,656
- Oh, shut the fuck up.

530
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,491
- That's macho.

531
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,577
(Lisa sighs)

532
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,578
- You know, I really wasn't
expecting you

533
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,121
to kidnap me right off the
street.

534
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,083
- [Erika] We wanted to give
you the same experience

535
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,167
we give the others.

536
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,711
- I'm doing my part.

537
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,256
Playing it up for the
cameras and the interns.

538
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,717
- You were very convincing, by
the way.

539
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,927
Especially with Adam.

540
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,847
- Erika, let me borrow your
phone for a few minutes.

541
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,766
- No! No tech for you.

542
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,309
You know the rules.

543
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,269
- I made the rules.

544
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,729
- Social media deprivation

545
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,941
is a huge component of the
experiment.

546
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,818
Yeah. (chuckles)

547
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,445
Besides, I don't want your poop
fingers all over my screen.

548
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,321
- Okay, fine.

549
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,242
Well, how about letting me close
the door?

550
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,744
- Come on, you know we have to
keep watch

551
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,747
to make sure you don't take
any contraband back with you.

552
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,499
- [George] Yeah, Fischer will
know.

553
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,128
- Okay what the fuck, guys? Can
I get a little privacy here?

554
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:04,631
- Well, you do always say
I'm just one of the girls.

555
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,759
- (sighs) Jesus, George,
I can't go like this.

556
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,302
- Bitch, please.

557
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,721
Do you really there's anything
these cameras haven't seen?

558
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,933
Besides, this is
technically the men's room.

559
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,145
(fly unzips)

560
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,564
(urine splashes)

561
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,233
(Lisa chuckles)

562
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,196
- All the other rooms are doing
fine.

563
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,990
You two are the only problem so
far.

564
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,369
- Look, Adam's not there
yet, okay? But we're close.

565
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,621
I just need another day or two
with him.

566
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,415
- I don't get what makes
him worth all this trouble.

567
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,042
You could have any other guy you
want.

568
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,670
- Okay, that's the point,
George. He's the one I want.

569
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,006
- (scoffs) You know, you're
lucky that this happened

570
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,883
in the middle of the night
while Erika and I are here.

571
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,634
Do you have any idea how much
pizza-

572
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,969
- Or weed.

573
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,554
- Or weed we're gonna
have to give these interns

574
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,056
to keep them quiet about this?
- Okay, hey! Get off my dick!

575
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,392
It was an accident, okay? Fuck!

576
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,187
(George sighs)

577
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,646
(chuckles)

578
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,648
I'm sorry! I just, he can't-

579
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,109
- I get it. You're agitated.

580
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,069
Probably exhausted.

581
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,696
Shit, I can't imagine my mental
state

582
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,031
if I spent two weeks in there.

583
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,240
- Wait, is that how long it's
been?

584
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,035
- Fuck. I'm sorry, just
forget I said that.

585
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:18,038
(suspenseful music)

586
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,166
(chuckles)

587
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,584
George made that himself.

588
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,587
Calls himself the Kennel Master.

589
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,756
- It's creepy as fuck.

590
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:32,010
I hate it. I mean, I'm
seeing it in my dreams.

591
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,346
- Well, then it's having
the desired effect.

592
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,642
- At least something is
working the way it should.

593
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:42,437
Fuck. I am so close to
phase two with Adam.

594
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,523
- Just relax. Let it happen
naturally.

595
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,524
(Lisa chuckles)

596
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,777
Well, as much as it can in
there.

597
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,111
And try not to sabotage

598
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,489
the rest of the experiment
in the process, okay?

599
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,700
(phone whistles)

600
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,203
(sighs) 60 seconds. I gotta
get you back in there.

601
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,375
(ominous tones)

602
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:13,009
- Hey. What's really in
the food you're giving us?

603
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,594
It's not just a sedative, is it?

604
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,056
- I mean, it's 99-cents
store chipped beef,

605
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,394
so it's barely a grade above
dog food, but that's it.

606
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,437
Nothing psychotropic.

607
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,481
- (chuckles) Are you sure?
- Lisa.

608
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,901
Honey, you are the closest
thing I have to a real family.

609
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,069
Why would I lie to you?

610
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,907
(Lisa chuckles)

611
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,495

612
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,414

615
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,336

616
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,755
(door slams)

617
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:02,684
(padlock clicks)

618
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,685
- Thank you.

619
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:05,812
- For what?

620
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,816
(Lisa chuckles)
(brooding music)

621
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,736
- For being my light in the
dark.

622
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,155
I need you.

623
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:20,535
Okay? I won't be able to get
through this without you.

624
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,080
- Stay strong.

625
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,957
(Lisa chuckles)

626
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,959
(sighs)

627
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,177
(lights thud)

628
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,596
(door slams)

629
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,391

00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:07,540
(computer chirps and bleeps)

633
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,669
- And we're streaming.

634
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,838
That should keep Fischer out
of our asses for a few hours.

635
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,174
- Do you mind if I got lay
down for a little while?

636
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,259
I've got a splitting headache.

637
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,594
- Yeah, I've got this covered.

638
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,721
I don't think we'll have
any more problems tonight.

639
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,765
- What do you wanna do about the
interns?

640
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,396
- Barter some of our
edibles for their silence.

641
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:35,026
Just a handful each, okay?
I want that bag back.

642
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,739
(door squeaks)

643
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,242
(door closes)

(alarm blares)
(door opens)

650
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,005
- Adam.

651
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,344
(door slams)

652
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,139
Adam.

653
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,391
(chuckles)

654
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:17,777

00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,448
(Adam pants)

657
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:22,866
- What the fuck?

658
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:23,700
Lisa!

659
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,786
I had the keys.

660
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,788
We were gonna get the
hell out. What happened?

661
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,790
- You, you must have been
hallucinating.

662
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,127
Maybe you were right about the
food.

663
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,546
(Adam sighs)

664
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,177
- It felt so real.

665
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,344
- Well, you're my hero.

666
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,431
(chuckles)

667
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,016
You're the only man who's
ever wanted to rescue me.

668
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,809
- To be fair,

669
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,437
you probably haven't needed
much rescuing, until now.

670
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,606
- You'd be surprised.

671
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,108
It's good to see you smiling
again.

672
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,861
I'm just glad you woke up before
the...

673
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,656
Lights out.

674
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:21,132

675
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,967

♪ Die, die ♪

677
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,803
- [Interns] Oh!

678
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,305
- Don't eat too many,

679
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,225
and don't tell anyone what
went on here tonight, got it?

680
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,976
♪ Die, die ♪

681
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,437
- Let's go over the rules one
more time.

682
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,189
- [Woman Over PA] Be good.

683
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,023
Walk only.

684
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,904

(PA system chimes)

688
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:55,625
Be good.

689
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,502
Walk only.

690
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,758
- Why do you suppose
they let us out together?

691
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,678
- We are being integrated.

692
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,558
Trust through familiarity
and repeated exposure.

693
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:15,520
(PA system chimes)

694
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,938
Sorry.

695
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,440
Uh, I studied animal behavior.
- Be good. Walk only.

696
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,026
- Before realizing there
was no money in it, so...

697
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,821
- Is there a scientific name for
that,

698
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,864
or are you just making it up as
you go?

699
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,284
- It's one of the -ologies.

700
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,953
(Lisa chuckles)

701
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,999
- I didn't realize you were so
worldly.

702
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,835
- Well, there's actually a
lot you don't know about me.

703
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,504
Just as I'm willing to bet
there's a lot I

704
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,547
don't know about you?

705
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,300
- True.

706
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,221
- (chuckles) I used to think
this fence was electrified.

707
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,347
So I never touched it.

708
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,980
(Lisa chuckles)
(PA system chimes)

709
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,858
After being in here for a
while, I started to hope it was.

710
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,069
- Walk only.
- Imagine my disappointment.

711
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,156
- No.

712
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,533
You can't mean that.

713
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,702
You're not the suicidal type.
(Adam sighs)

714
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:15,538
- I just figured, might as
well go out on my own terms.

715
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,043
- I don't know. (chuckles)

716
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,420
I think I'd try to take out

717
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,089
as many of those bastards as I
can.

718
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,007
If I had to go.

719
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,552
- See that old tire over there?

720
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,722
This one time, I hopped the
fence,

721
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,599
before anyone knew what was
happening.

722
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:40,688
I told myself if you could
just make it past that tire,

723
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,316
you'd be home free.

724
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,109
- [Woman Over PA] Be good.

725
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,903
- How far did you get?

726
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,404
- I don't know.

727
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,531
The tire was the last thing
I saw before I blacked out.

728
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,866
(Lisa sighs)

729
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,118
- I didn't even make it
past the fence. (chuckles)

730
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,412
- Yeah, that's because you're
predictable.

731
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,622
(Lisa scoffs)

732
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,248
- I am?

733
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:02,085
- You gotta go all-in when
they're expecting you to fold.

734
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,089
Like right now.
- Be good. Walk only.

735
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,007
- They don't think we're
gonna make a run for it.

736
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:10,927
- That may be.

737
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:15,014
But as long as we have on
these, what's the point?

738
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,392
- The point...

739
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,605
Is showing them we're not giving
up.

740
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,401
- [Woman Over PA] Be good.

741
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,193
Walk only.

742
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,821
- Then I'll race you to the
tire.

743
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,700
On three.

744
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,452
One.

745
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,121
Two.
- Two.

746
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:43,084
Three!
(dramatic music)

747
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,048
(Lisa groans)

748
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,135
(groans)

749
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,607
(Lisa pants)

750
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,495
(both choke)

751
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:29,505
(ominous music)
(door creaks)

752
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,633
(door closes)

753
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,719
(slap)

754
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,305
(chain clinks)

755
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,934
- [George] You don't like
to follow the rules? Fine.

756
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,728
We'll do things my way.

757
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,062
- Why are you doing this?

758
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,732
Why are you doing this? Please!

759
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,192
Help!

760
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,026
Help!

761
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:54,155
- [George] Make all the noise
you want.

762
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,532
(Adam moans)

763
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,867
These rooms are designed to
silence

764
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,535
the barking of bitches like you!

765
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,455
- No! (pants)

766
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,999
(moans and pants)

767
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,918
(sobs)

768
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:11,005
(stopwatch bleeps)

769
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,007
What do you want from me?

770
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,175
(intense music)

771
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,761
- I don't want a god damn thing
from you!

772
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,679
(Adam screams)
(snarls)

773
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,514
- No! No!

774
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:24,143
(screams and sobs)

775
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:33,277
(screams and sobs)

776
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,203
- (sighs) What am I gonna do
with you?

777
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,454
(door closes)

778
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,288
Little Miss

779
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,708
"I made the rules."

780
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,670
Why do you have to make things
so fucking difficult, huh?

781
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,467
(suspenseful music)

782
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:14,861
(Lisa wheezes)

783
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,331
(Lisa gasps)

784
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:30,459
(Lisa gasps)
(George grunts)

785
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:34,046
(computer chimes)
(static hisses)

786
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,632
(mouse clicks)

787
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:44,265
- Hey. So, what have you been up
to?

788
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,434
I came in to relieve you
about half an hour ago,

789
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,728
but I haven't seen you
on any of the monitors.

790
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:51,564
- Well, you know.

791
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:54,358
Just had to take care of
a couple troublemakers.

792
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,359
- Lisa again?

793
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,361
- They both made a run for it,

794
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,030
when I let them out this
afternoon.

795
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,033
- Why would they try to escape?

796
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,285
- Why the hell does Lisa do
anything?

797
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,164
And I had to administer a
sedative.

798
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:10,124
- I hate when you do that,
George.

799
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,501
- Hey, someone has to
keep the subjects in line.

800
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,631
- And why can't I access

801
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,633
any of the cameras from the east
wing?

802
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,343
- Huh, they must've gone down,

803
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,929
but I'll get them back online
when I come back from lunch.

804
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,139
Do you want me to, uh,
pick you up anything?

805
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,726
- Uh...

806
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,269
No?

807
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,480
- Oh, and Mark and Sara didn't
show up for their shifts,

808
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,982
but I wouldn't worry, things
should be pretty quiet.

809
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,400
- What about Fischer?

810
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,778
- In a meeting all afternoon,
(chuckles) we're good!

811
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,954
(brooding music)
(door closes)

812
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:49,747
- What are you up to, George?

813
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,419
(chain clacks)

814
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,838
(door slams)

815
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,137
(keys clink)

816
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:09,767
George?

817
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,602
You better not be fucking
around.

818
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:22,488
Hey, guys.

819
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,781
I know this is a little off
schedule,

820
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,700
but I feel like something
strange is going on,

821
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,869
and I hate walking around
this place by myself.

822
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,454
- Yeah. Okay.

823
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,541
I need a break anyways.

824
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:36,043
(tense music)

825
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,430
(doors thud)

826
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,977
(doors slam)

827
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,152
(keypad bleeps)

828
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:09,243
(door closes)

829
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,289
(ominous music)

830
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,967
(Lisa screams)

831
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:29,263
(Lisa chokes)

832
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:34,852
- I found the other one.
I'm gonna need a hand.

833
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,571
It took four shocks to get this
guy down.

834
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,656
What the hell are you
dosing them with now?

835
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,450
- I don't know.

836
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:50,785
But I know who does.

837
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,914
(tense music)

838
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:55,956
I understand.

839
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:57,917
Thank you.

840
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,716
(George sighs)

841
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,555
- Is that live?

842
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,058
- Yep.

843
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,560
- Huh.

844
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,188
Looks like you've been
busy while I was at lunch.

845
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,022
- Not really.

846
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,859
It was pretty quiet, like you
said.

847
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:27,947
I just had Joel and Preston
move 'em back into the kennels.

848
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:32,243
I figured if all you did was
sedate them,

849
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,703
they could sleep it off back
in familiar surroundings.

850
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:35,538
Right?

851
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,249
- What did I tell you about the
east wing?

852
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,918
- You told me not to
worry about it, George,

853
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,878
but that's what I do, I worry.

854
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,380
- Erika, I specifically-

855
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,006
- And Fischer's on her way here.

856
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,883
- What?

857
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,593
Why didn't she call me?

858
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,554
Wait. Did you call Fischer?

859
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,015
- What did you dose them with,
George?

860
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,184
That is not a sedative.

861
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,519
I think we're losing sight

862
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,729
of what this experiment
was supposed to be about.

863
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:04,942
Maybe she can get us back on
track.

864
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,362
(chuckles) She's here.

865
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,448
- Fuck, fuck, fuck! (sighs)

866
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,700
No, no, no, no.

867
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,828
(suspenseful music)

868
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:18,330
- You have five minutes to
explain to me

869
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,624
why I shouldn't pull the
plug on this project.

870
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,293
- Please, we're only halfway
there.

871
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,712
If you cut it off now,
we'll have learned nothing.

872
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,589
And think about all
the wasted grant money.

873
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,340
- Why are they sleeping?

874
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,259
This is not a scheduled sleep
cycle.

875
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:32,761
- I had to sedate them. They
tried to escape earlier.

876
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,681
- This is a behavioral
experiment!

877
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,266
You have no medical training.

878
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,684
I am the only one authorized

879
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,477
to administer any kind of drugs.

880
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,190
You've crossed the line this
time!

881
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:47,568
Go pull Lisa out.

882
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,613
I'm telling her this is done.

883
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,323
- What about the experiment?

884
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,408
- Forget the experiment.

885
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,826
Forget about school.

886
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,330
Just be thankful no one got
hurt,

887
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,706
or you'd be going to prison.

888
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:10,216
(door closes)

889
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:13,219
(suspenseful music)

890
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:22,061
- [George] No, no! I'm not
going to fucking prison!

891
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:26,023
(grunts) It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

892
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:33,322
- Leave us.

893
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,038
(door creaks)

894
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,540
(door closes)

895
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,088
(button clicks)

896
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:01,433
(button clicks)

897
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,143
I told you it was ill-advised

898
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,979
to be a subject in your own
experiment.

899
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,398
(bag unzips)

900
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,192
Now, this...

901
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:13,737
Is the good stuff.

902
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:16,657
(ominous tones)

903
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:19,118
A spike in adrenaline
should be all we need

904
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,161
to get Sleepy Beauty talking.

905
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,462
(Lisa grunts and coughs)

906
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,715
(Lisa gasps)

907
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:36,051
(Lisa grunts and pants)

908
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,388
(Lisa coughs)

909
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,602
(Lisa pants)

910
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:51,442
- Fuck.
(keyboard clacks)

911
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,319
(groans) Damn it.

912
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:54,820
She locked us out.

913
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,822
Fucking prison. She said
we were going to prison.

914
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,199
- [Erika] Well, if those
sedatives are as harmless

915
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,661
as you say they are, you have
nothing to worry about, right?

916
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,164
(tense music)

917
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,794
(Lisa clears her throat)

918
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,005
(Lisa chuckles)

919
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:16,383
- Professor Fischer. (chuckles)

920
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,552
- I pulled you out because I
need answers.

921
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,679
Who authorized the use of
sedatives

922
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,598
and other drugs to the subjects?

923
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:25,225
(Lisa chuckles)

924
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:28,812
- (chuckles) I don't know.

925
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,106
- I have release forms and
physicals

926
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,941
for every one of the
participants,

927
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,777
except the one you call Adam.

928
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,028
Why?

929
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:38,655
- I'm sure it's in there
with the rest of them.

930
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,199
- He's not.

931
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,033
I checked.

932
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:47,998
- Maybe, (chuckles)
you should check again.

933
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,794
- Do not presume to tell
me how to do my job!

934
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,883
- I could help. (chuckles)

935
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,427
- I'm shutting this down.

936
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:05,391
Do you have any idea the kind of
liability

937
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,851
the university assumes
with a project like this?

938
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,646
What if he gets hurt?

939
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,023
What if he dies?

940
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,526
There would be a lawsuit.

941
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,863
It would be your fault,
but it would be my ass!

942
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,992
- Professor Fischer, can
we talk about this later?

943
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,285
- Why?

944
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,286
What are you hiding?

945
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,749
- I, I just think I'm gonna be
sick.

946
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:34,837
- Where is that document?

947
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,046
I know you.

948
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,882
I know you are not sloppy enough

949
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,592
to miss a detail like that.

950
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,101
Unless he doesn't know.

951
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,984
Please tell me he's a willing
participant.

952
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:05,200
I took the liberty of having
the university pull your file.

953
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:09,079
No high school transcripts.

954
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,124
No emergency contact numbers.

955
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:16,044
No public record of a Lisa
Green before three years ago.

956
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,839
Now you're taking hostages?

957
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,300
I'm reporting this to the
autho...

958
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:26,138
(dramatic music)
(chokes)

959
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,354
- Bet you regret that spike
of adrenaline now, huh?

960
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:41,195
(Fischer chokes)

961
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:56,502
(Fischer chokes)

962
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:09,681
(Fischer gasps)

963
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,516
Shit.

964
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,228
(Fischer gasps)

965
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,231
Fuck, shit! Shit, fuck!

966
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,525
(pants)

967
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:23,028
(Fischer whines)

968
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,781
(exhales deeply)

969
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,535
(chuckles) The good stuff, huh?

970
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:31,954
(spits)

971
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,248
(chuckles)

972
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,082
Let's see

973
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,918
how you like this shit.

974
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:41,046
(Fischer sobs)

975
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:43,173
That's the thing about
adrenaline.

976
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,424
A little bit brings you up,

977
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:47,135
but a whole fuckin' lot
takes you straight down.

978
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,432
(sighs)

979
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,685
- Please!

980
00:55:58,605 --> 00:55:59,898
You don't have to do this.

981
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,943
(Lisa chuckles)

982
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:03,944
- God, look at you.

983
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,907
Where's the stone-cold bitch
persona now?

984
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,452
- Please, help me.
(suspenseful music)

985
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,121
Help me!

986
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,372
Please!

987
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,791
(door slams)

988
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:20,752
- We've been drugging
them for three weeks.

989
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,838
Why the fuck did you call
Fischer now?

990
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,215
- No, I've been sedating them.

991
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,968
You've been drugging them
illegally.

992
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,095
- Fucking Fischer! This
is your god damn fault!

993
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,097
- Listen to yourself, George!

994
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,056
- Fischer's done!
- Fuck!

995
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,977
- I'm ready to go back in!

996
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,395
- (chuckles) Well, you heard the
lady.

997
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,980
Let's get her back in there.

998
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:43,191
- Where's Fischer?

999
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,946
- So, Fischer just fucked off

1000
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,240
and left without saying
anything?

1001
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,825
- I guess?

1002
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,994
I mean, she bitched and moaned
about liability and paperwork

1003
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:56,163
for a couple of minutes, but
then I just reasoned with her.

1004
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,956
- You reasoned with her?

1005
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,499
- I mean, I pretty much had to
promise her

1006
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:02,836
the soul of my firstborn, but
she agreed.

1007
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,129
Gave me a few more days.

1008
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,341
(chuckles)
- All right, wait here.

1009
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,009
I'm gonna suit up, just in case.

1010
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,015
- I don't know what kind of
voodoo you used on Fischer,

1011
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,516
but you got lucky.

1012
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,894
It's only a matter of time
before it all falls apart.

1013
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:21,063
- Don't worry about Fischer.

1014
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:24,191
Look, Adam came back for me.

1015
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:26,735
Okay? Phase two is done and
the end game starts tonight.

1016
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,945
- I need to know what your plan
is.

1017
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,489
You keep saying you have one,

1018
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,699
but I don't see a clean way out
of this!

1019
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,661
- It ends the same way it began.

1020
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:37,204
Just drop us off in
the middle of the night

1021
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:38,747
with bags over our heads, okay?

1022
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:40,957
He doesn't know any of you.
He doesn't know where we are.

1023
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,250
It is perfect.

1024
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,629
I just need to prep him tonight
and then we'll disappear.

1025
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:48,173
- Disappear?
- You know what I mean!

1026
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,758
Drop off Fischer's radar.

1027
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,220
- What about the rest of us?

1028
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,183
- Remember, I need you.

1029
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,561
Okay? You're my light in the
dark.

1030
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,231
Just... (sighs)

1031
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:06,650
(keys clink)

1032
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:11,947
Just keep the light burning

1033
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:13,115
(keys clink)

1034
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:14,491
a little while longer.

1035
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,327
Okay?

1036
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,330
(door opens)

1037
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,833
(door closes)

1038
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,754
(keypad bleeps)

1039
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,340
(alarm blares)

1040
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:55,198
(padlock clicks)

1041
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,784
(alarm blares)

1042
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:03,790
(door closes)
(somber music)

1043
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:13,216
(computer chirps and bleeps)

1044
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,303
- No, this doesn't feel
right. I'm calling Fischer.

1045
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,848
- But everything else up to this
point

1046
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:21,558
has felt just fine, huh?

1047
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,976
- Give it back!

1048
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,312
- If Fischer comes back here,
we're all going to jail.

1049
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:26,772
Is that what you want?

1050
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,690
Just go outside, get some fresh
air,

1051
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,567
and mellow out a little bit,
okay?

1052
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,526
You'll feel better.

1053
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,404
I'll do the rounds, all right?

1054
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,864
And if you still wanna
call her when you get back,

1055
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:37,908
then I won't stop you.

1056
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:43,246
- Fine.

1057
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,669
(Adam groans)

1058
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,381
(Adam sighs)

1059
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:56,259
- I don't know what's happening
to me.

1060
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,093
- You're awake.

1061
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:02,599
Look, it's this place,
okay? It is getting to us.

1062
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:09,064
Just think of a pleasant memory,
you know, from the outside.

1063
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,821
- I can't think of anything.

1064
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,491
- Hey.

1065
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:23,995
You must have had some
joy in your life. Just...

1066
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,705
Just think of a happy memory.

1067
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:31,002
(suspenseful music)

1068
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:42,973
- Got ya.

1069
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:49,479
- Fischer's done!

1070
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,481
I'm ready to go back in.

1071
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,247
(door closes)

1072
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:09,207
- Ah-hah. What have we here?

1073
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:21,720
(Erika gasps)

1074
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,442
- [Erika] What the fuck, George?

1075
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:59,090
(George whispers)

1076
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:03,428
(intense music)

1077
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,479
(gasps) Oh, fuck!

1078
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,397
(pants)

1079
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,231
- Help me.

1080
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,108
- What happened?

1081
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,320
- Lisa's dangerous.

1082
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,906
She, she's not who she says she
is.

1083
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:24,282
(George chuckles)

1084
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,492
- Oh, I know.

1085
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,704
You don't know Lisa the way I
do.

1086
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:30,580
Nobody does.

1087
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,501
I would do anything

1088
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,253
for

1089
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,589
her.

1090
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,383
(Fischer screams)

1091
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:46,388
(ominous music)
(blood splatters)

1092
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:54,145
(water splashes)

1093
01:02:56,231 --> 01:03:01,236
(pants)
(suspenseful music)

1094
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:14,374
Fuck. (pants)

1095
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:21,715
(breathes deeply)

1096
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:30,015
(Erika gasps)

1097
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:32,100
(door closes)

1098
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,103
(suspenseful music)

1099
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:42,193
(keys clink)

1100
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,449
(ominous tones)

1101
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:04,716
- Love.

1102
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:06,468
- What?

1103
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:08,428
- Tell me about your first love.

1104
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:10,430
(Adam chuckles)

1105
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:13,099
- Love is just one of
those words, you know?

1106
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,101
I love my parents, I love my
dog, but-

1107
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,186
- Come on.

1108
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,440
Look, maybe you've never said
it,

1109
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,693
but you must have felt it.

1110
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:26,946
(Adam chuckles)

1111
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:31,242
- Yeah, sure, but it
wasn't anything serious.

1112
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:35,246
What about you?

1113
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,207
(Lisa chuckles)
You ever been in love?

1114
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:38,917
- Yeah.

1115
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:46,382
It was one of those moments.

1116
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:51,096
He was standing there, in the
quad, and,

1117
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:55,225
our eyes locked as he was
walking towards me and...

1118
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:00,063
And in that instant, I saw
our whole future together.

1119
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:02,107
I mean, (sighs)

1120
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:06,444
a wedding and kids and
vacations and growing old.

1121
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:09,489
I mean, everything. Like,
all from a single glance.

1122
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:12,700
(chuckles)

1123
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:15,453
He kept walking.

1124
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,499
And I just stood there.

1125
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:22,836
Like hypnotized, just waiting
for him to

1126
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:26,881
turn around, you know,
expecting him to turn around and

1127
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:30,009
for that last look.

1128
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:34,264
I mean, that's what guys do,
right?

1129
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:38,351
That's, (chuckles) that is
what every guy has done.

1130
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,562
Just, just not him.

1131
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:46,401
(chuckles)

1132
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,279
I didn't even know his name.

1133
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:52,657
And that I loved him.

1134
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:57,078
Then I lost him in 30 seconds
and...

1135
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:00,790
And there hasn't been a day

1136
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,500
that I haven't thought about him
since.

1137
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,466
I bet that sounds silly, huh?

1138
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,803
- That's not silly at all.

1139
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,180
I get it.

1140
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,598
Sometimes you just connect.

1141
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,684
(suspenseful music)

1142
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:22,770
(lights thud)

1143
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,314
(lights thud)

1144
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:27,525
- (chuckles) Yeah, exactly.

1145
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:30,236
Yeah, like, like the
way I connect with you.

1146
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,488
- Something's wrong.
- What?

1147
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,324
- The bell didn't ring before
lights out.

1148
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:47,420
(keys clink)
(tense music)

1149
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:19,535
(Erika screams)

1150
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:21,996
- Shit.

1151
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,124
Did you hear that?

1152
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:29,671
(suspenseful music)

1153
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,424
(sighs)

1154
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:42,141
(padlock clicks)

1155
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,896
(pants)

1156
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,775
- How did you-
- Shh.

1157
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,195
- What're you doing? Is that a
key?

1158
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:55,029
- Shh!

1159
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:59,951
I am going to remove your chain,

1160
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:02,954
but you have got to be keep
quiet, okay?

1161
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:07,166
(pants)

1162
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,210
Look around. Not a single light
is on.

1163
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:12,005
There is no power, okay?
This is our chance.

1164
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,007
(pants)

1165
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,263
(George pants)

1166
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:21,180
- Lisa did this.

1167
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:25,143
I, I just found her like this
and I was gonna come tell you,

1168
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:27,562
but the, the power went out
and...

1169
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,690
- I don't believe it.

1170
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:33,443
- She wasn't gonna let Fischer
pull the plug on this thing.

1171
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,113
- We've gotta call the police.
- Now, hold on!

1172
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:41,326
Don't you wanna see how
this is gonna play out?

1173
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:43,328
Like you said, no one's
gonna miss Fischer.

1174
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:45,330
- I can't pretend this never-
- Shh!

1175
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:49,167
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1176
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,675
(lights thud)

1177
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:01,429
(computer chirps and bleeps)

1178
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:10,313
Okay.

1179
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,399
(suspenseful music)

1180
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,401
(sighs)

1181
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:21,783
(sighs) Damn it.

1182
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:23,117
(sighs)

1183
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,535
What am I gonna do with you?

1184
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:29,665
(Lisa and Adam gasp and choke)

1185
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:38,091
(Lisa and Adam gasp and choke)

1186
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:57,193
(suspenseful music)

1187
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,027
- Adam?

1188
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:07,036
(restraints clink)

1189
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:13,501
Adam?

1190
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:17,130
I know you don't know me,
but you have to listen to me.

1191
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:21,592
Adam!
- I know who you are.

1192
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:26,931
You're one of them.

1193
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:29,684
- I was.

1194
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:32,478
I was one of them, but now I'm
one of you.

1195
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:35,815
I'm friends with Lisa.

1196
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:40,319
And we have to get out
of here. Where is she?

1197
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:44,991
Where is Lisa?

1198
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,159
- You tell me!

1199
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:50,496
Where did you people take her?
- I don't know!

1200
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:53,833
This whole experiment got out of
hand,

1201
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,126
and now people are dying!

1202
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,502
- What experiment?

1203
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,465
What experiment!

1204
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:02,592
Tell me!

1205
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:06,304
- This whole thing is a
behavioral experiment,

1206
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:10,266
treating humans like animals,
funded by the university.

1207
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,728
Lisa dragged you into it
because she's had this

1208
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:17,106
mad crush on you from the
moment she first saw you.

1209
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:20,276
She's been fixated on
that for over a year now.

1210
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,736
- That story she told me.

1211
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:29,160
That was about me?

1212
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:34,874
No.

1213
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,667
No, no, no, no, no. No, stop it!

1214
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,628
You're trying to get inside of
my head!

1215
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:39,754
Fuck you!

1216
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,255
- I get it.

1217
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:45,176
Fuck me, fuck this place and
fuck this shitty situation!

1218
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:49,805
But I know the way out of here
and you need me to get there.

1219
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,474
- Why should I trust you?

1220
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,269
- (sighs) You still don't
believe me?

1221
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,148
Okay, uh...

1222
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:03,611
You tried to escape
when I was feeding you.

1223
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:07,073
You hit me over the head and
took my keys.

1224
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:08,616
- That was you?

1225
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:10,159
- Yeah.

1226
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,578
Lisa, she told you you were
hallucinating, but you weren't.

1227
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:15,998
It really happened and you were
drugged to forget about it.

1228
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,708
We almost pulled you out, then
and there,

1229
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:21,462
but Lisa wanted to keep going
'cause

1230
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:24,215
she wanted more time to wear you
down.

1231
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:26,467
(Adam breathes sharply)

1232
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,427
That story she told you about
her brother

1233
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:29,845
locking her in the basement?

1234
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,307
Yeah, she told me the same
story,

1235
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:35,268
but she said her shitty mother
did it,

1236
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,144
'cause she knew I'd relate to it
more.

1237
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,440
That's what she does.
She gets in our heads.

1238
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:46,654
- That crazy bitch.

1239
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:51,117
- No.

1240
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,494
No. No, you bitch, you're
ruining it!

1241
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:59,292
(dark music)

1242
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,256
- How's the view from under that
bus?

1243
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:08,009
(Lisa screams)

1244
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:11,137
So emotional. (laughs)

1245
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:15,683
It's a bitch losing trust in
the ones you love, isn't it?

1246
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:16,976
- This must be a hallucination.

1247
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,519
- [George] This is very real.

1248
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:21,480
- She is ruining it, okay?
Just get him out of there.

1249
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,983
I can salvage this!
- You heard what he just said.

1250
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:25,526
Why can't you just let him go?

1251
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,070
- Please.

1252
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:32,575
George, I... (sighs) Let me fix
this.

1253
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:37,622
- Okay.

1254
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:39,373
Okay, okay, okay.

1255
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,045
But first, there's a couple
things I wanna show you.

1256
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:50,843
(chuckles)

1257
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:53,262
(door slams)

1258
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,103
Look familiar?

1259
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,022
(chuckles) They should.

1260
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:06,317
(men mumble and murmur)

1261
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:10,905
- They're...

1262
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:14,200
My ex-boyfriends.

1263
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:17,328
- Not just your ex's.

1264
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:21,749
This is a collection of every
man who has ever wronged you,

1265
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:23,417
and they're here to be punished.

1266
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:27,421
But here's the interesting part.

1267
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,341
The recent ones call you Lisa.

1268
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:35,930
And more than a few years
back, they call you Natalie.

1269
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:40,726
And further still, they
know you as Ashley.

1270
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,604
(chuckles)

1271
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:45,940
So I guess you could say that

1272
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:48,317
I'm the only one who knows the
real you.

1273
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:56,325
That's the difference between me

1274
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,411
and every other man in this
room.

1275
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:01,038
I know who you really are.

1276
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:04,417
I know what you've done
and I'm not scared.

1277
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,504
See, you think I haven't been
listening,

1278
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:11,799
but I've heard everything
you've ever told me.

1279
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:16,679
And I see how these men
treat you and I understand.

1280
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:21,142
I understand why you wanted
to do this whole damn project

1281
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:22,351
in the first place.

1282
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,229
But your mistake was Adam.

1283
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,691
He's not right for you.

1284
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:30,985
I'm right here.

1285
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,283
- I thought you were gay.

1286
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,788
- I might as well be, in your
eyes.

1287
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:47,501
You were never gonna see me as
any legitimate love interest.

1288
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:50,713
Okay? I've been stuck in the
friend zone since day one.

1289
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:57,678
But I couldn't bear the thought
of being invisible to you.

1290
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:03,684
And I couldn't bear the
way you look at Adam.

1291
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:07,021
I needed to make you see.

1292
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:12,443
The same way you were gonna make
Adam see.

1293
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:24,455
I have one more thing to show
you.

1294
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:30,669
(sighs)
(men murmur and mutter)

1295
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:36,383
When I say I'll do anything
for you, I mean it.

1296
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,262
(sighs) All those alpha male
jock types?

1297
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,764
I mean, you know they're
just gonna use you

1298
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:43,849
and use you up until there's
nothing left.

1299
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,186
That's not love, Lisa.

1300
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:50,606
This...

1301
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:53,984
This is love.

1302
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:00,616
(sighs)

1303
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:03,244
I finished what you started,

1304
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:05,955
and I know you're no stranger to
death,

1305
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:08,916
but we did this, together.

1306
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:13,295
And I'm in this with you now,

1307
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,588
and it feels...

1308
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:19,260
It feels amazing.

1309
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,305
And now...

1310
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,016
Our final destination.

1311
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:41,407
Would you like to know
what they're saying?

1312
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:44,201
(chuckles)

1313
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:47,955
Well, don't be a wallflower.
Get in there and dance.

1314
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:50,207
(chuckles)

1315
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:55,754
(suspenseful music)

1316
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,513
(door closes)

1317
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,181
- George, stop.

1318
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:08,934
This experiment is over!

1319
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,686
Fischer is dead.

1320
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,229
Get these collars off.

1321
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:16,358
- There's been a lot of talk
about losing focus and I agree.

1322
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:20,237
I don't like the direction
this shit-show is going.

1323
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,990
So, Lisa is gonna help me turn
it around.

1324
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:31,332
- What is this?

1325
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:33,125
- It's a choice.

1326
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:35,836
- Lisa.

1327
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:40,215
What the fuck is goin' on?

1328
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:44,803
- It's clear one of these
two is just a distraction.

1329
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:45,721
Choose.

1330
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,810
- This is crazy, Lisa.

1331
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:54,897
You don't have to play his game.

1332
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,566
You're my best friend.

1333
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:00,736
- Is this part of the
experiment?

1334
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:04,698
What am I doing here?

1335
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:07,368
Are you playing me?

1336
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:09,954
- No. Hey, don't say that.

1337
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:14,375
Adam, you know me better
than that, okay? You...

1338
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:16,710
You know me.

1339
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:20,005
- I know you're all fucking
batshit.

1340
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:23,258
(George chuckles)

1341
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:25,344
(George sighs)

1342
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,554
- Talk, talk, talk, talk. Choose
one!

1343
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,265
- Lisa?

1344
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:31,141
You were right.

1345
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:34,103
George is drugging you.
This isn't your fault.

1346
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:35,980
- No, you know what? It is your
fault!

1347
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:37,773
It's your fault!

1348
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,235
I mean, I heard everything that
you said!

1349
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:43,529
What, you're turning him against
me?

1350
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:45,197
- You've done that yourself.

1351
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:48,325
You're obsessed and you can't
even see

1352
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:50,661
how many people are
getting hurt because of it!

1353
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,123
Fischer was right.

1354
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:59,044
(tablet chirps)

1355
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,462
(collar hums)

1356
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:05,467
(dramatic music)
(Adam gasps)

1357
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:10,097
(Adam chokes)

1358
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:13,600
- Hey.

1359
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,768
Make it stop!

1360
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:20,399
- I can't do that, Lisa.
The choice has been made.

1361
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:24,320
Though it was never really yours
to make in the first place.

1362
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:28,198
- But I didn't choose Adam.

1363
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,617
- To be fair, you really
haven't displayed much prowess

1364
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:33,787
in the decision-making
department lately, have you?

1365
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:36,290
So, maybe it's for the
best that I step in.

1366
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:38,167
- Please.

1367
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,336
I'll do anything you want.

1368
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,714
- (sighs) I know you would.

1369
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:48,385
- I am willing to give
myself to you, okay? That...

1370
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:49,762
That's what you want, right?

1371
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:53,807
- Jesus, George, you're a
fuckin' lunatic.

1372
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,727
(button clicks)
(collar hums)

1373
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,562
(chokes)

1374
01:20:58,562 --> 01:20:59,646
- That's what you wanted, wasn't
it?

1375
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:02,566
I mean, you did press her
button.

1376
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:06,570
See? This is us coming up with
a solution together, okay?

1377
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:10,115
I chose Adam and you chose
Erika.

1378
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:12,367
(Erika chokes)

1379
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:13,702
And no one's gonna miss her.

1380
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,080
She has no family, no
friends beyond this room.

1381
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,624
And no one even knows he's here,
okay?

1382
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:21,877
Just make his body
unidentifiable
and we're in the clear.

1383
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:24,213
This is always how it
was gonna end, wasn't it?

1384
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:28,383
Burn it down, disappear
and do it all over again.

1385
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:31,720
- Please.

1386
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:36,141
He doesn't have to die.

1387
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:39,478
(George chuckles)
(Erika chokes)

1388
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,897
- Did you hear that?
(Erika chokes)

1389
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:44,400
She said "he doesn't have to
die."

1390
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,819
She doesn't give a shit about
you.

1391
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:51,573
(button clicks)
(Erika pants)

1392
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,075
Apparently...

1393
01:21:53,075 --> 01:21:54,910
(Erika coughs)

1394
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,079
She doesn't give a shit about
me, either.

1395
01:21:57,079 --> 01:21:58,872
After all of this.

1396
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:01,667
- That is not what I meant!
Look, just...

1397
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:04,461
(sighs)

1398
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:05,879
(button clicks)
(ominous tones)

1399
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:06,713
Stop.

1400
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,843
Think about what you're doing.

1401
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,594
(Adam chokes)

1402
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:15,264
- Once you put Fischer in the
freezer,

1403
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,350
you passed the point of no
return.

1404
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,477
Now we finish this.

1405
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:30,487
- I will give you what
you have always wanted.

1406
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:33,323
(Adam chokes)

1407
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:34,199
- There's nothing you could
offer me

1408
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,034
that I haven't already taken.

1409
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:40,873
"I've not taken." (chuckles)

1410
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:43,667
That sounds inappropriate.

1411
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:49,173
Let's just say

1412
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:51,592
you are very, very generous

1413
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:53,635
when properly dosed.

1414
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:02,477
(ominous music)

1415
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,486
- That may be.

1416
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:16,325
But what about a real
relationship?

1417
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:21,205
Burn it all down

1418
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:22,956
and disappear with me, George.

1419
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:26,251
- Do you... Do you mean that?

1420
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:28,503
- I do.

1421
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:35,302
- (sighs) Don't, don't
toy with my emotions.

1422
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:36,178
- I wouldn't.

1423
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:38,847
- You are.

1424
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:41,892
You are, you're, you're, you're
using sex and relationships

1425
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:44,228
like a currency and you're
weaponizing them against me!

1426
01:23:44,228 --> 01:23:45,604
- God! Let's just talk about
this!

1427
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:47,189
Just deactivate his collar!

1428
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:49,900
- (groans) I'm done talking!

1429
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,820
All we do is talk, and talk, and
talk,

1430
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,615
and talk, and talk, and talk!

1431
01:23:56,615 --> 01:23:58,825
Talking doesn't get us anywhere.

1432
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:00,744
It's never gonna get us
anywhere!

1433
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:02,246
So I'm gonna tell you something

1434
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:05,749
in the only fucking
language you understand.

1435
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:06,917
(Adam gasps)

1436
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:07,709
Okay.

1437
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,048
- George!

1438
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:13,840
George!

1439
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:20,472
(door closes)
(Adam chokes)

1440
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:23,016
(Adam chokes)

1441
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:23,850
- Why?

1442
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:30,983
(collar chimes)
(collar hisses)

1443
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:33,902
(Lisa sobs)

1444
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:35,237
(somber music)

1445
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:36,738
- You petty bitch.

1446
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:44,579
All this because he was the
one man who didn't want you.

1447
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:45,914
- [Lisa] Erika.

1448
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:48,375
- You pushed my fucking button!

1449
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:52,421
You were my best friend, my
family.

1450
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,341
You and George really are
perfect for each other.

1451
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:58,927
Two sadistic peas in a fucking
pod.

1452
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,805
- Look, I know that you
hate me right now, okay?

1453
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,682
I fucking hate myself,
but the only way that we

1454
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:06,435
are getting out of this
is if we work together.

1455
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:09,438
- What can we do like this?
(restrains clink)

1456
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:11,398
(George sighs)

1457
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:12,691
- What did I miss?

1458
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:14,985
Oh.

1459
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:17,237
(chuckles)

1460
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:20,907
(sighs)

1461
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:22,367
That's on you, princess.

1462
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:26,038
Some damsels aren't in distress.

1463
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:27,873
They cause it.

1464
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:30,792
And remember, I did say
every man who wronged you

1465
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:32,753
was here to be punished, didn't
I?

1466
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:37,382
And how much heartache did
Adam here provide you with?

1467
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:41,511
(chuckles)

1468
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:43,513
(sighs)

1469
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:44,348
Come on.

1470
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:49,102
Let's turn that frown upside
down.

1471
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:53,857
Just push this button,

1472
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,860
and all of this will be over.

1473
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:01,490
I understand your hesitation.

1474
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,116
Last time I asked you to press a
button,

1475
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,201
it didn't do anything.

1476
01:26:05,452 --> 01:26:07,037
But I guarantee this one does.

1477
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:19,716
(sighs)

1478
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:22,177
(chuckles)

1479
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:23,470
(tablet chirps)

1480
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:27,933
(men choke)
(chuckles)

1481
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:30,268
It's good. (laughs)

1482
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:31,853
It's good, it's good.

1483
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:35,524
This will heal you. Make you
whole again.

1484
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:39,277
And we can't have a room
full of witnesses, can we?

1485
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:43,031
(chuckles)

1486
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,742
What're you... Wait, what're you
doing?

1487
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:48,286
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1488
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:50,038
No! No, no, no, no!
(tablet clacks)

1489
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:52,666
(Lisa pants)

1490
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:53,542
(Lisa chokes)
No!

1491
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:57,504
No, no, no, Lisa! Wait, hold on!

1492
01:26:57,504 --> 01:26:59,214
No, no, no! Fuck.

1493
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:02,175
Fuck, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no! Fuck!

1494
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:04,886
Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
(Lisa chokes)

1495
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:08,723
No, Lisa, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1496
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:10,934
No, no! Lisa, Lisa!

1497
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:11,768
No, no!

1498
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:16,481
(moans and groans)
(dramatic music)

1499
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,108
(flesh tears)
(screams)

1500
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:19,317
(Lisa spits)

1501
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:20,193
Bitch!

1502
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:22,737
(whines and groans)

1503
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:26,741
(thud)
(groans)

1504
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,581
(tense music)

1505
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,586
(Erika gasps)

1506
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:38,503
- Okay, no!

1507
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:43,967
Shit, shit!

1508
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:46,970
- All I wanted was to love you,
Lisa!

1509
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,388
You fucked it up!

1510
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,143
(door slams)

1511
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:54,811
- We've gotta get that collar
off, okay?

1512
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:56,021
He still has your remote.

1513
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:58,023
(door opens)

1514
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:58,857
- [George] Lisa!

1515
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:02,986
I know all your secrets!

1516
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:05,405
I devoted years to you, Lisa.

1517
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:11,453
Your Mom blamed herself
when you sister drowned,

1518
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:13,330
but it wasn't an accident, was
it, Lisa?

1519
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:14,873
- Okay. Go, come on.

1520
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:17,375
- And your roommate never killed
herself.

1521
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:20,086
You got rid of her, then
fucked her boyfriend!

1522
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:21,463
(pants)

1523
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:22,589
Ah!

1524
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:24,424
You can't run from your past
this time!

1525
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:26,760
(sighs)

1526
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,428
I fought for you!

1527
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:29,888
I sacrificed for you!

1528
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:36,061
Unlike the rest of these
fuckers, I will not die for you!

1529
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,479
Look at me, Lisa!

1530
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:41,274
Don't ignore me!

1531
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:43,902
(thud)
(groans)

1532
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:46,655
(dramatic music)

1533
01:28:57,916 --> 01:28:59,125
(clattering)

1534
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:00,627
(pants)

1535
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:03,380
I would've been good to you,
Lisa.

1536
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:05,423
(groans)

1537
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:07,425
(gurney clatters)

1538
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:09,427
(pants)

1539
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,851
(grunts)
(Lisa chokes)

1540
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:19,646
I loved you, and you wasted it.

1541
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:21,064
(Lisa chokes)

1542
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:25,944
You fucking wasted it,
Lisa. You fucking wasted it.

1543
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:27,571
(pants)

1544
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:31,116
You fucking... You fucking
wasted it!

1545
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:33,368
Why couldn't you see me?

1546
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:34,619
Why couldn't you love me?

1547
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:38,039
I don't wanna do this!

1548
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,125
I didn't wanna do this!
You made me do this!

1549
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:43,503
(wrench clangs)
(groans)

1550
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:45,922
(Lisa pants)

1551
01:29:51,177 --> 01:29:54,097
(suspenseful music)

1552
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:57,934
- Hey! (chuckles)

1553
01:29:57,934 --> 01:29:58,810
Look what I found.

1554
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:02,230
(George sighs)

1555
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,315
- Oh, wait.

1556
01:30:03,315 --> 01:30:04,107
- You know, you really shouldn't
leave

1557
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:06,151
your toys laying around.

1558
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:07,652
- Wait, wait, wait. Please,
let's talk-

1559
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:08,862
- Shh!

1560
01:30:08,862 --> 01:30:10,447
(button clicks)

1561
01:30:10,447 --> 01:30:13,116
(George chokes)

1562
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:17,829
- Hm. (chuckles)

1563
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:20,707
You're right. Talking
never got us anywhere.

1564
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:24,753
So!

1565
01:30:24,753 --> 01:30:26,212
(chuckles)

1566
01:30:26,212 --> 01:30:27,297
We're gonna tell you

1567
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:29,966
in the only language
that you'll understand.

1568
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:33,178
(button clicks)

1569
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,388
- Please! Please, please don't!

1570
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:37,307
No! Oh, my god, no!

1571
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:38,725
No! Wait, I'm sorry!

1572
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:39,809
- Don't worry!

1573
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:41,227
- No, no, no!

1574
01:30:41,227 --> 01:30:43,104
- It's just the tip.

1575
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:45,148
(cattle prod zaps)
(George screams)

1576
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:49,486
(button clicks)
(George groans)

1577
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:52,238
(sighs)

1578
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:54,324
(laughs)

1579
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:57,035
Don't turn away.

1580
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:01,790
It's okay to look.

1581
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:04,459
(chuckles)

1582
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,628
The son of a bitch is
never gonna hurt us again.

1583
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:15,679
(George chokes)

1584
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:18,056
- I almost left.

1585
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:21,559
(somber music)

1586
01:31:21,559 --> 01:31:24,771
I made it to the door,
but I couldn't leave you.

1587
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:29,526
(wrench scrapes)

1588
01:31:29,526 --> 01:31:30,777
You need help.

1589
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:33,697
And I love you.

1590
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:36,366
(wrench clangs)

1591
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:43,123
(Lisa sighs)

1592
01:31:43,123 --> 01:31:44,791
- I didn't want this to
be painful, (chuckles)

1593
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:47,877
but you know, we've gotta
make your body unidentifiable.

1594
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,048
(chuckles)
(Erika wheezes)

1595
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:56,010
(sighs) You know, dental
records, fingerprints, all that.

1596
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:03,435
It wasn't lying, you know,
when I said I needed you.

1597
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:05,437
And... (chuckles)

1598
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:07,897
It's true. I consider you
family, too.

1599
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,693
But that's the thing about
family.

1600
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:14,279
They make sacrifices for each
other.

1601
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:17,407
(collar chimes)
(collar hisses)

1602
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:19,993
(Erika chokes)

1603
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:25,665
Thank you for your sacrifice.

1604
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:29,961
(ominous music)

1605
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:31,963
