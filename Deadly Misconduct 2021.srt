00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:12,594
Mr. Halley, is it true that
on the night in question

4
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,389
that you told the police
that you saw the defendant,

5
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:19,184
Sergei Ivanov, loading some
very suspicious looking

6
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:22,187
containers into the storage
unit that you rented him?

7
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,399
No, I... don't
remember saying that.

8
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:27,901
But you very clearly told
the police that you were

9
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,863
so suspicious that you
went there that night

10
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:34,241
-Objection. Asked
and answered.

11
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,284
Sustained.

12
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,914
Mr. Halley,
you very clearly

13
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,083
have changed
your testimony.

14
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:47,713
Did the defendant
threaten you in any way?

15
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:52,885
Because if he did,
we can protect you.

16
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,929
Okay.

17
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,014
Yeah.

18
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,477
What
happened was...

19
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:05,939
I am so sorry,
Your Honor.

20
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,859
I apologize to the
court, Ms. Sagan.

21
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:16,200
Mr. Halley, you
were saying?

22
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,619
-No. No one
threatened me.

23
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,954
I didn't
see anything.

24
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,457
Am I done here?

25
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:24,917
I'm done.

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,126
Judge: It's
getting late.

27
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,544
Let's adjourn
for the day.

28
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,671
We'll continue this
Monday morning at 8:00.

29
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,137
You look
horrible, Annie.

30
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,348
If I was you I'd get
some rest on the weekend.

31
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,183
Go to
hell, Larson.

32
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:43,185
Thank you.

33
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:52,736
So, I think I
should get my

34
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,822
public YouTube
channel this week.

35
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,865
I have so much
great content.

36
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,617
No, You have a
private channel

37
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:01,370
so your Grandpa can
watch and that's that.

38
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,747
Jamie's is public!

39
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,582
That's just
not fair, mom!

40
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,626
She's already
monetizing!

41
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,170
We could
make money!

42
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,256
I'd get a ton
of subscribers

43
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,341
and I could get
merch and sell it

44
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,635
and even
become famous!

45
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,345
Crystal, How
many times

46
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,305
do we need to have
this conversation?

47
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,974
You do not need to
worry about making money.

48
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,767
You should focus on
getting good grades

49
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,519
and being a
regular kid.

50
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:28,313
That IS being a
regular kid nowadays!

51
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,565
Do you know how
many of my friends

52
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:30,899
have YouTube
channels?

53
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,652
Yeah, well, not
you, and that's final.

54
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:46,373
I still think you're
being old-fashioned.

55
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:49,042
Great. Look, your tennis
coach is right there.

56
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,377
Hurry up.

57
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:51,503
Love you.

58
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,338
-Love you, too.

59
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,030
Sorry about that. Had to
drop Crystal off at tennis.

60
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,573
-That's fine.
How's Crystal?

61
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,074
Haven't seen
her in a while.

62
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,409
She's great.

63
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:25,204
Other than the fact she
wants to be YouTube star.

64
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,872
Yeah, don't lose too
much sleep over it.

65
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,415
She'll be on to
something else next week.

66
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,917
I sure hope so.

67
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,336
Hey, I'm sure that
as the most promising

68
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,879
Assistant DA
in the state

69
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:35,714
there's nothing
you can't handle.

70
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,633
That's not true. A
ten-year-old preteen

71
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,259
is definitely
more tough than

72
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,094
the criminals
I prosecute.

73
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:44,097
But I'm sure as the most
promising DA investigator

74
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,933
you already
know that.

75
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,769
Speaking of, how'd
the Ivanov case go?

76
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,062
-Ugh. Don't
get me started.

77
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,772
I had the prime
witness on the stand

78
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,066
then of course Larson
pulls one of his antics

79
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,817
to disrupt my
cross examination

80
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,402
so the judge
adjourned for the day

81
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,196
and I have to start
all over tomorrow.

82
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,573
He's
such a sly bastard.

83
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,658
-Yeah.

84
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,579
Listen, Mark...

85
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,290
there's something
I want to discuss.

86
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,501
What's up?

87
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,294
Who's the girl you
were with last night

88
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,921
at The Grove?

89
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:18,590
What, so I can't
go out with a friend

90
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,342
anymore just 'cuz
I'm dating you?

91
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,969
You kissed
her, Mark.

92
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,429
Danielle saw you in the
parking lot kissing her.

93
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,847
I don't know what
she thinks she saw,

94
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,391
but there
was no way-

95
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,810
Mark! Why are
you lying to me?

96
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,353
Danielle's my
best friend,

97
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,230
she wouldn't just
make that up.

98
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:35,315
-A garden salad
for the lady...

99
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,235
and the salmon eggs
Benedict for you, sir.

100
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,199
What do you want
me say, Annie?

101
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:45,784
The truth. It's
not that hard.

102
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,077
Okay.

103
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,913
The only time I ever
see you is at work, Annie.

104
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,416
And then I get a lunch
or maybe a dinner,

105
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,126
what, once
a week?

106
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,461
I miss you. I want
to be around you.

107
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,505
I want to speak to you
face-to-face instead of the

108
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,590
five-minute phone calls
and text messages we have.

109
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,426
You knew the
situation, Mark.

110
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,261
Crystal is my
first priority.

111
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:06,513
We have school and tennis
on top of trying to

112
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,724
juggle a career
at the DA's office.

113
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,560
All of which existed before
you were in the picture.

114
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,354
Except I'm not actually in
the picture, Annie, okay?

115
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,315
You say I am,
but I'm not.

116
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,653
So where do we
go from here?

117
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,614
I think you know
the answer to that.

118
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,283
We still have to
work together.

119
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,201
Well, that's
what we'll do.

120
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,124
Hello?

121
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,625
Oh, Danielle, thank
god you answered.

122
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,627
Do you happen to
be free tonight?

123
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,796
-Hmm.. let me
check my calendar.

124
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,591
No job, divorced,
no hot date...

125
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,426
Yeah, I think
I'm good.

126
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,970
-Well, I also just joined
the 'no hot date club'

127
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,430
if that's any
consolation.

128
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:49,890
-I'm sorry, Annie.

129
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,391
It's for the
better though.

130
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,893
-I know. Thanks for
letting me know

131
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,353
you saw him
last night.

132
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,021
-I hated having
to tell you.

133
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,814
So, what's up? You
need me to hang out

134
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,441
with my bestie
Crystal tonight?

135
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,568
-I totally forgot I have
a work function tonight

136
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,737
at some fundraiser
at the DA's office.

137
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,489
-Hey, no need
to explain.

138
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,948
You know I love
spending time

139
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,492
with that
wise old gal.

140
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,077
-Thanks, you're
a godsend.

141
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,578
So, um, swing
by for 7:00 pm?

142
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:12,871
-Yeah, TTYL.

143
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,164
-What?

144
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,500
-TTYL... talk
to you later.

145
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,835
It's all about the
acronyms, Annie.

146
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,462
C'mon, get
with the ages.

147
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,422
-Okay, okay.

148
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,723
Blue is A
favorite color of mine.

149
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:35,602
AN umbrella is
useful when it rains.

150
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:42,025
He ate A enormous
Pop-Tart.

151
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,819
You sure about
that one?

152
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,363
Yeah. He ate a
enormous Pop-Tart.

153
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,407
'Enormous'
starts with a vowel.

154
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,950
It's the grammatical
rule that counts;

155
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,536
not how it sounds
to the ear.

156
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,456
He ate AN
enormous Pop-Tart.

157
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,542
Good job.

158
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,711
-I'm here!
-Danielle!

159
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,755
-Hi, my BFF!

160
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,802
Where's Hector?

161
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,179
Oh, he's fine. Um,
my best pair of shoes,

162
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,181
on the
other hand..

163
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,978
It's motion-activated
so I get an alert

164
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,855
any time
something happens.

165
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,189
Wait, did you just
say that those are

166
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,899
your best pair
of shoes?

167
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,568
Hey, I'm not
pushing 40.

168
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,485
You know what,
I've gotta run.

169
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,611
Okay, so dinner's
in the oven,

170
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,488
it'll be ready in like
15 minutes or so.

171
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,657
And then just call me if
you need anything, okay?

172
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,577
And in bed by
8:30 this time.

173
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,833
Love you.

174
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,501
-Love you, too.

175
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,163
Hey, Annie.

176
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,123
On the cell phone
at the fundraiser.

177
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,625
What is that,
the new standard

178
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,293
at the DA's office
these days?

179
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,669
Yeah. Well, it's
been a long day,

180
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:25,962
so I called
my ride home.

181
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,214
You're leaving
so soon?

182
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,632
Not soon
enough, I guess.

183
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,801
Wait a
minute, why is it

184
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,845
I get the feeling
that you don't like me?

185
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,223
Maybe it's because
I don't like you, Larson.

186
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,641
-Perfect.

187
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,060
This place is a little too
lame for my taste as well.

188
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,103
I'm outta here.

189
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,981
So, how about I
give you a ride home

190
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,566
and you join me
for one drink.

191
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,193
What d'you say?

192
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,237
I'll pass. The joy
of rideshare apps.

193
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,613
-C'mon, Annie.

194
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,114
What am I gonna
do, bite you?

195
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,741
One drink, c'mon.

196
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,038
Wait a minute.

197
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,415
You don't wanna be
seen with me, is that it?

198
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,292
-Well, I have a
reputation to protect.

199
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,211
Your reputation
will not be tarnished.

200
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,088
You're opposing
counsel, yes, it will.

201
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,714
It's a little thing
called the appearance

202
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,341
of impropriety,
or did you just

203
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,051
skip that section
in law school?

204
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,803
I have a tidbit of
information about the

205
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,305
Ivanov case that will
make you very, very happy.

206
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,182
And why would
you give me that?

207
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,601
Oh, come on,
Annie. Really?

208
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,853
We both know
this case is shut

209
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,690
and closed in my
favor, right?

210
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,984
So me giving you a
tidbit of information,

211
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,528
a little bit of discovery
to get a drink with you,

212
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,363
hey, I got
nothing to lose.

213
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,031
But you, on the
other hand,

214
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,617
you have a lot to
gain.. trust me.

215
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,166
Fine. One drink.

216
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,723
So, after your
husband passed,

217
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,391
where'd you
go from there?

218
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,936
-That's about it. I,
uh, went to law school,

219
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,606
did my best to
raise Crystal,

220
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,484
and the rest, as
they say, is history.

221
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,908
You know, I'd like to
meet her some time.

222
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:19,951
Hmm.

223
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,414
So, what
about you?

224
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,832
You went to
Yale, right?

225
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,292
That's right.

226
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:30,587
-I don't get it.
You're a smart guy.

227
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:35,759
Why do you..
why are you a...

228
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,304
-Why am I a
drug lawyer?

229
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:40,805
Yeah.

230
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,603
You know, Annie, I uh..
I'm very well aware

231
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,938
I've got a pretty
bad reputation.

232
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,316
But to be honest with
you, it doesn't bother me.

233
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,443
Everyone's entitled
to a defense, right?

234
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,236
Yeah, but..

235
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,488
In some
strange way,

236
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,865
I think I'm a little
bit like them. Okay?

237
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,409
You know, I like to
live my life on the edge.

238
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,579
To be honest, I think it's
gonna be a little difficult

239
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,706
for someone like
you to understand.

240
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,751
Seems like you've lived
quite a disciplined life.

241
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,628
Why do you
think that?

242
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,339
-Well, it's just the
vibe you project, Annie.

243
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,633
You know, you
always seem so..

244
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,052
I dunno..
buttoned up, maybe.

245
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,054
And to be honest
with you, Annie,

246
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,764
I didn't even
recognize you

247
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,516
when you walked
in this evening.

248
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,685
You know, generally,
you're always so

249
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:30,605
I dunno..
prissy, maybe.

250
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,151
And tonight?

251
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,070
Well, tonight,
you look luscious.

252
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,242
I'm gonna go to
the ladies' room.

253
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,910
-Sure.

254
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,287
So, what about that
"tidbit" of information

255
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,164
about the
Ivanov case?

256
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,457
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

257
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,417
I'm gonna have
to show you.

258
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,963
What? No,
it's not-

259
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,257
I don't have it with me,
Annie. It's at my place.

260
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:42,719
Nice
try, Larson.

261
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,679
C'mon, I'm not
trying anything.

262
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,432
Really? Hey, look,
it's up to you, okay?

263
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,850
If you want a chance
of cracking this case,

264
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,435
entirely
up to you.

265
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,895
Finish your drink,
we'll head right over

266
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,480
and I'll show
it to you.

267
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:12,999
Hey, hey...
are you okay?

268
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,543
-Uh, yeah.

269
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,504
I feel like
I'm drunk.

270
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,756
I only had one
drink, though.

271
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,466
-Maybe you didn't have
enough to eat today.

272
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,218
I dunno.

273
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,344
Hey! There he is!
How you doing, Rex?

274
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,805
Rex, uh, Annie.
Annie, Rex.

275
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,140
-"Rex", that's
original.

276
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,517
-Hey, c'mon, buddy.

277
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,477
Can I get you a drink
while you wait, Annie?

278
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,937
-No, I'm good.

279
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:01,274
-Okay. I'll be right
back. C'mon, champ.

280
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,459
Hey.

281
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,127
-Wow, read much?

282
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,212
Yeah.

283
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,715
It is one of my
vices, actually.

284
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,384
So, uh, the thing
about the case?

285
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,970
Yeah. It's
upstairs. C'mon.

286
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,431
I'll give you a tour
while we're at it. C'mon.

287
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,141
Whoa..

288
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,688
My room...

289
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,403
Do you know I've always
thought you were

290
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,739
the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen?

291
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,616
Annie... What
do you think?

292
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,992
No!

293
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:56,329
No, that is
not the deal.

294
00:15:56,373 --> 00:16:00,166
-Okay. Okay.
I had to try.

295
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,417
Nice try.

296
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,044
I'm ordering
a ride home.

297
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,337
No, no, no.
It's okay.

298
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:05,880
I'll give you
a ride home.

299
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,675
Let me grab you the
thing I promised you.

300
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,394
Oh, no.

301
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,230
Oh, god..

302
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,330
Have you seen
my phone?

303
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,749
Larson? Larson!

304
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:09,045
Oh, my
god! Oh, my god!

305
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:35,316
911, what's the
nature of your emergency?

306
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,236
911...

307
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,850
High-profile defense
attorney Doug Larson

308
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,602
was found shot to
death in his home

309
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,354
at 3:00
this morning.

310
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:15,523
Detectives say that the
suspect is still at large

311
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,024
but they will
work diligently

312
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,527
to bring the person
responsible to justice.

313
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,153
Officials are still
unsure if this was a

314
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,281
robbery gone wrong or
a targeted shooting.

315
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,286
We'll keep you updated
on the situation...

316
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,996
Hey, ugh, thank
you so much

317
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,914
for dropping her
off at school.

318
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,958
Again, I am so
sorry about last night.

319
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,710
-Hey, you have nothing
to be sorry about.

320
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,712
You figured out what
you're gonna do yet?

321
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,631
Yeah. I'm gonna do
what I should've done

322
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,508
last night and
go to the cops.

323
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,802
Get fired probably,
even disbarred.

324
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,679
C'mon, it can't
be that bad.

325
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,556
Well, it is. It's
called the appearance

326
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,808
of impropriety,
and yeah, it's bad.

327
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:52,310
I didn't even
sleep with the guy

328
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,811
but who's gonna
believe that?

329
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,521
I fled the scene,
wiped my prints,

330
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,064
which is
obstruction.

331
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,400
-Wait, so you could go
to jail for something?

332
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:05,489
What would
happen to Crystal?

333
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,992
Annie, you did
nothing wrong!

334
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,076
Just don't
say anything.

335
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,329
I can't do that.

336
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,247
That just makes
things worse.

337
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,338
Hi, Annie.

338
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,507
-Hi, Sarah. Is
George available?

339
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,676
Yeah, he said to
just go on in.

340
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,719
-Thanks.

341
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,181
George?

342
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:34,268
Hi, um... I wanted
to talk to you

343
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,103
about the Doug
Larson murder.

344
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,772
Yeah, right.

345
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,441
You were up against him
on the Ivanov case, right?

346
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,485
Uh, yeah. See,
the thing is-

347
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:43,944
Yeah, I know.

348
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,571
You have a
perfect record

349
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,740
and you want to
prosecute this case.

350
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,784
But so does everyone
else in the office.

351
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:52,119
No, the thing is I've
really messed up and-

352
00:22:56,459 --> 00:23:02,421
Damn. Right now?
Yeah, yeah, fine.

353
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,548
Press conference.
Downstairs. Five minutes.

354
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:05,508
-For what?

355
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,717
For the
Larson murder.

356
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:07,927
I guess it's big
news whenever

357
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,387
a client offs
his own lawyer.

358
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,471
A client?

359
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,932
Yeah. Jimmy Perriera.
Didn't you hear?

360
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,850
Yeah, he
murdered Larson

361
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,519
because he didn't
get his son off.

362
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,313
Maybe this time
we'll get the guy.

363
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:22,233
-And so after fine police
work by our detectives,

364
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:26,362
at 8:00 this morning we
arrested James Perriera

365
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,531
a known criminal
and former client

366
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,324
of Doug Larson's.

367
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,618
-Sir, we heard rumors
that someone was spotted

368
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,703
leaving Larson's in
the middle of the night.

369
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,497
Was that Perriera?

370
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,291
-We don't know that yet
but we have a special

371
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:43,546
DA investigator on
the case: Mark Evans.

372
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,339
-Are you prosecuting
this one yourself?

373
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:47,425
-No. As you know,
I'm in the middle of

374
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,176
prosecuting another
major case.

375
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,970
This case will
be handled by

376
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,930
a very capable
young DA who

377
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:55,516
happens to have
a perfect record:

378
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,059
Miss Annie Sagan.

379
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,110
-Miss Sagan, is it
true that Larson was

380
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,237
laundering money
for Perriera?

381
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,614
-How do you respond to
Perriera's lawyer's claim

382
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:11,824
that he was
set up?

383
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:13,951
Um..

384
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,744
-How long do you think
this trial will last?

385
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,872
-Do you anticipate an
open and shut case?

386
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,248
No comment.

387
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,416
-Miss Sagan...

388
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,876
Hmm. No comment.

389
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,675
-We'd like to thank you
for coming out today-

390
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,886
Thanks for saving
me back there.

391
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,388
Yeah, seemed like he kind
of sprung it on you, huh?

392
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,682
Still, it's pretty good
for someone so young.

393
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:37,683
George must hope
that some of your

394
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,685
old man's talent
rubbed off on you.

395
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:42,354
Mark, I can't
prosecute this case.

396
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,316
What? Isn't this what
you always wanted?

397
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,109
This is your first
homicide case.

398
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,403
You've been begging for
this and now here it is.

399
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:50,821
Look, it's
complicated. Okay?

400
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:53,199
I'll tell you
about it later?

401
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,131
Guess who?

402
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,758
-Danielle!

403
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,219
-Hey sweetie, can you go
to your room, please?

404
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,346
I need to have a grownup
conversation with Danielle.

405
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,347
-Mom..

406
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,098
-Please?

407
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,142
Thank you.

408
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,019
-What's up, Annie?

409
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:29,026
Look at this.

410
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,905
"I'm going to
kill you bitch."

411
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,865
Do you know
who it's from?

412
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,659
Yeah. His name
is Quentin Cruz.

413
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,327
I put him away
two years ago and

414
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,162
he's been harassing
me ever since.

415
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,122
Okay, why haven't you
told me this before?

416
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,124
Because it wasn't really
a big deal before and

417
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,960
honestly I thought he
would just get over it

418
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,546
but now it's escalated
to death threats.

419
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,589
Have you reported
this to anyone?

420
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,424
Yeah, I told Judge
Miller this morning

421
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,968
and he told me
to tell some lady

422
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,636
with Judicial
Protection...

423
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,471
Officer Mendez,
I think.

424
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:58,681
Well, did you?

425
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,391
-No. Not yet.

426
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,434
I didn't want to make
a big fuss about it.

427
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,103
I just wanted someone
outside the courts

428
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,981
to be aware, that's
why I'm telling you.

429
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:12,236
Look, I'm here for you
every step of the way.

430
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,529
-I know.

431
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:16,615
-Mitch Warner, appearing
on behalf of the defense.

432
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,285
-Annie Sagan,
appearing for the people.

433
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,121
-Do you have a copy
of the police report?

434
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,664
-We have yet to
receive a full report

435
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,291
from the police,
Your Honor,

436
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,293
despite the numerous
attempts from my office.

437
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,003
Based on that,
and other factors,

438
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,630
we strongly recommend
that bail be granted.

439
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:44,893
Miss Sagan... Miss
Sagan, did you hear me?

440
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,229
I said I wanted to hear
the People's position

441
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,189
on the
matter of bail.

442
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:53,152
Miss Sagan? Bail!

443
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,487
Right. Um, sorry.

444
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,740
Due to the serious
nature of the crime

445
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,409
we request that he be
held without bail, sir.

446
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,871
-Your Honor, my client
has strong ties

447
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,372
to the community.

448
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,291
He's in no way
a flight risk.

449
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,460
He has a wife,
children, home,

450
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,337
and businesses
in this community.

451
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,505
Based on that, I
strongly feel that

452
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,883
Mr. Perriera should
have bail granted.

453
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:19,345
Fine. Bail is set at
half a million dollars.

454
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,983
Hey, don't feel
too bad about it.

455
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:34,276
-Huh?

456
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,778
That he
got bail.

457
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,529
-Oh, yeah. Right.

458
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,948
So, you heard
the latest, right?

459
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:43,160
Perriera has an alibi for
the night of the murder.

460
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:44,828
-It's because
it wasn't him.

461
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,665
Yeah. It
was him, alright.

462
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,876
His alibi's his mistress
who's lying for him.

463
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,836
I already found a
witness who'll testify

464
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,672
she wasn't even with
Perriera that night,

465
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,465
that she was
home alone.

466
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:59,134
I can't prosecute
an innocent man.

467
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,595
Innocent? Are
you kidding me?

468
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,807
Perriera's a drug
dealing, murdering scum.

469
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,267
Hey. Hold up.

470
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,354
That witness who can
break Perriera's alibi,

471
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,940
he wants to cut a
deal... like now.

472
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,275
Wanna discuss it
over a drink?

473
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,695
Mark, you
know it's over.

474
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,655
Okay, how about
a coffee shop?

475
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:21,490
Nothing romantic
about that, right?

476
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,158
Yeah. Well,
it can be.

477
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,577
Walk me to
my car?

478
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,551
So what did they
pick this guy up for?

479
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,344
-Uh, robbing
a liquor store

480
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,179
while high
on heroin.

481
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,306
Great. Sounds like
a reliable source.

482
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,808
I mean, this guy's
obviously a junkie

483
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:49,351
who's lying.

484
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,103
And it seems to me
you're trying to do

485
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:52,646
the defense's
job for them.

486
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,273
You know what?
Yeah, I am,

487
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,858
because the
defense is gonna

488
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,526
rip this guy apart
on the stand.

489
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,361
-Okay. Fine. Whatever.
You're the boss.

490
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,988
I will look into
other suspects.

491
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,281
-Great.

492
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,824
-I've been meaning
to track down that

493
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,743
mystery
blonde anyway.

494
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,286
-The what?

495
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,663
-The blonde woman
who was with Larson

496
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:11,081
the night of
the murder..

497
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,750
you read the
file, right?

498
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,793
You know they found
two long blonde hairs

499
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,962
on the pillow next
to Larson's body.

500
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:18,881
I dunno. Maybe
she did it.

501
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,591
Maybe Perriera
put her up to it.

502
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:24,094
No! I mean,
no, that's-

503
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:26,180
that's not
Perriera's style.

504
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,848
Larson was a
total horndog.

505
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,683
He probably slept with a
new woman every night.

506
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:31,393
Those hairs could've
been there for weeks.

507
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,437
Still, it's a lead that
we have to follow up on.

508
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,355
No. Listen,
Larson is no angel.

509
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,608
I'm sure he has enemies
against him, right?

510
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,109
-Yeah. You
got that right.

511
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:40,778
Larson
was a jerk.

512
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,279
Right. So, why
don't you work on

513
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:44,114
finding out who else
wanted him dead.

514
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,200
What is this? Is
this some kind of

515
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:49,036
women's intuition,
"feeling" thing?

516
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,954
Does George know about
this feeling of yours?

517
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,706
No. And he
doesn't need to.

518
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,793
This is my case. I've
gotta get back to work.

519
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,754
-Hey. You up for
a drink tonight

520
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,007
in a NON-romantic
setting?

521
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:04,593
Definitely not. I'll be
working well into the night.

522
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,386
I'll talk to
you later.

523
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,788
That was
so fun.

524
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:30,178
I must say, Danielle sure
is great with Crystal.

525
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,222
Looked like they had a
great day at the lake.

526
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:34,933
Sorry, what?
Who is this?

527
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,685
Crystal didn't
even wake up

528
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:39,146
when I was in
her room tonight.

529
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:42,024
Who is this?
Quentin Cruz?

530
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,876
Oh, come
on. Go, go, go.

531
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,345
Oh, come on,
Danielle, pick up.

532
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:21,271
Please, answer.

533
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,669
Crystal!

534
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,545
Hello?

535
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,924
Crystal!

536
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,930
Crystal? Oh,
thank god.

537
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:59,559
Baby? Hey, how are
you? You okay?

538
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:00,686
-Hi, Mom.

539
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,020
-Hi.

540
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,313
-Time to
go home?

541
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:04,106
-Yeah.

542
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,399
-What's going on?

543
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,442
Oh my god, I've been
calling you and no answer!

544
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,069
I've been worried
out of my mind!

545
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:10,487
Why? You know
she's with me.

546
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:12,155
My phone's
probably dead.

547
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,323
-You okay?

548
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:14,866
-Mm-hmm.

549
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,951
-Okay.

550
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,316
Did you get my
package, Annie?

551
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,611
I'm quite a
good photographer,

552
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,030
don't you think?

553
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,322
You're out of
your mind.

554
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,949
I know who this is, I'm
gonna have you arrested!

555
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,492
Oh, I don't think
you'll do that, Annie.

556
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,119
Not when I have
more pictures

557
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,371
I could show them
from THAT night.

558
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:02,706
Cruz, what
do you want?

559
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,916
Isn't it obvious? I'm
going to ruin your life

560
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,795
the way you ruined
mine.

561
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,298
Who was that?

562
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,717
-He knows
where you live.

563
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:16,636
Pack your bags,
we're going to a hotel.

564
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,068
Judge, I'm-I'm so
sorry to bother you.

565
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,652
-When I said any
time, I meant it.

566
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,529
What's wrong?

567
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:38,617
Everything.

568
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,578
I mean, the stalker,
the Larson case...

569
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:44,122
-Oh, right,
congrats on that.

570
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,832
It'll be a real
feather in your cap,

571
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,709
putting that
guy away.

572
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:50,670
The thing
is, um...

573
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,097
He didn't
do it.

574
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,101
Perriera, he
didn't do it.

575
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,727
His hands are
totally different

576
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,521
than the
killer's hands.

577
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,356
-How do you
know that?

578
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:12,901
You have a witness who
saw the killer's hand?

579
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,490
Yeah.

580
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:24,621
Me.

581
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:28,041
I was there
that night.

582
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:30,377
I know. I'm so sorry.
It was a total mistake.

583
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,337
It was the night of
the benefit and I just

584
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:34,381
got drunk and I went
over to Larson's house

585
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,424
and then I was there
when the killer came in

586
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,135
and I was
hiding and-

587
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,178
-And you didn't
come forward?

588
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:42,848
-I tried, okay,
but now I can't

589
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,100
and.. and now I
can't prosecute

590
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,477
an innocent man
and the guy that

591
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:49,354
they'll replace
me with is just

592
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,940
gonna be hell-bent
on putting him away.

593
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,276
-No, stop! STOP.

594
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,986
I don't want to
hear any of this.

595
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:57,863
I'm about to
be nominated

596
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,824
to the Federal
Court of Appeals.

597
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:05,453
You're
right. I'm sorry.

598
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,707
Actually, I didn't
hear any of it.

599
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,585
You have got to figure
this out yourself

600
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,587
before they do.

601
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,896
Hey, Danielle. Is
everything okay there?

602
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:34,941
Thank you again. I
won't be too much longer.

603
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,990
Find anything,
counselor?

604
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,409
-Oh, god. I didn't
realize anyone was here.

605
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,327
-I just went out
to grab dinner.

606
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,121
It's hard work
searching for a clue

607
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,123
to who
knows what.

608
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,874
Yeah, well, isn't
that your job?

609
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,669
Hey look, I'm satisfied
that Perriera did it, okay?

610
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,296
If you want to go on
some wild goose chase

611
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,964
based on some
women's intuition thing,

612
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:22,632
that's your business
but, you know, please,

613
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,467
forgive me if I don't
share your beliefs.

614
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:25,969
-You know what
strikes me is that

615
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,470
this place has
been trashed.

616
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,347
But not just
randomly trashed.

617
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,141
Like the drawers and
the filing cabinet,

618
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,767
which indicates
to me that

619
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,186
someone was.. was
looking for something.

620
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,939
I mean, if Perriera
killed Larson because

621
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,649
he couldn't keep
his son out of jail,

622
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,901
revenge pure
and simple,

623
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:47,657
but then.. what
was he looking for?

624
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:50,243
Maybe it was
another motive

625
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,329
or maybe it was
someone else.

626
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,997
Let's see...

627
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,169
Are you
gonna help?

628
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:11,306
Look, it's Larson's
bank statements.

629
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:16,353
He makes a deposit for
$9,000 every month..

630
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:18,897
going back
for years.

631
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,025
-They could be
perfectly innocent.

632
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:25,236
Yeah, but...

633
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,072
Alright, um..

634
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,911
He made the
same notations

635
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,205
on every time that
he made a deposit.

636
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:39,209
TOC, SM, SL?

637
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,835
Someone's
initials maybe?

638
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:44,130
Yeah, maybe, but
TOC and the others,

639
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,716
what are they
paying Larson for?

640
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,593
-Blackmail
comes to mind.

641
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:52,430
Yeah. That's what
I was thinking too.

642
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:55,392
But who is Larson
blackmailing?

643
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:09,906
Yeah, this is he.
Yes, that's right.

644
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,283
Thanks for
getting back to me.

645
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,953
Uh-huh...
Great.

646
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,663
That's exactly what
I wanted to know.

647
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:17,997
Thanks for
your help.

648
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,667
Remember those
long blonde hairs

649
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,127
they found on
Larson's pillow?

650
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,169
-Yeah.

651
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,838
That was Larson's
maid on the phone.

652
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,589
Turns out she changed
Larson's sheets earlier

653
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,341
on the day of
the murder so the

654
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,301
blonde hairs were left
on his bed that night.

655
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,011
Larson was with
the mystery blonde

656
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,930
the night of
the murder.

657
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:36,391
So maybe Larson
left the party

658
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,309
with somebody
that night after all.

659
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,191
Ooh, I gotcha...

660
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:52,282
Wow, that's
pretty intense.

661
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,534
-Oh. Yeah. It's
just a stalker

662
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:56,453
who's been
threatening me.

663
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,455
He got out of jail a
couple of weeks ago.

664
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:00,498
-What? Why wouldn't
you tell me?

665
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:03,835
-Because it wasn't
that serious at first.

666
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,628
Now it's
escalated.

667
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,298
He broke into
Danielle's house

668
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,883
the other day and left
a threatening note

669
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,468
next to
Crystal's bed.

670
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:12,927
-Are you kidding me?
Get out of your house!

671
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,304
-We did, okay?
We're at a hotel.

672
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,306
We're fine.

673
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:21,519
-Good job today.

674
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,229
-Thanks.

675
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:26,191
So how long do we get
to stay at the hotel?

676
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,650
-Not too
much longer.

677
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,319
Just until they
fix the house.

678
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:32,363
-Well, tell them to take
their time 'cuz I love it!

679
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,782
- Well, I
prefer our house.

680
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,326
-I know. I do too

681
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,369
but it's so much
fun at the hotel.

682
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,579
-Hey, sweetie,
gimme a sec.

683
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:41,164
-Mm-hm.

684
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,749
Hey, George.

685
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,376
I got a call from a lawyer
today named Simmons

686
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,879
and he said that his
client was willing to

687
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:50,590
testify that Perriera
wasn't anywhere near

688
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:52,258
his girlfriend at the
time of the murder

689
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:53,760
and you
wouldn't deal.

690
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:56,095
Well, George, his client
is totally unreliable.

691
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,597
He's a junkie
who didn't even-

692
00:41:57,641 --> 00:42:01,601
-Annie, listen to
me.. very carefully.

693
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:03,436
I want Perriera.

694
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,687
But George, I-

695
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,606
Rumor has it that you
are not pursuing this

696
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,233
with the vigor
that you should,

697
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,984
that you're off on
some wild goose chase

698
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,694
of your own.
Listen to me, Annie.

699
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,029
if you cannot
handle this

700
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:14,447
I want you to let
me know right now

701
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,074
because I do not
want you to blow this.

702
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,742
The guy took
Simmons' deal,

703
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:19,202
you got a problem
with that?

704
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:20,411
-No. I..

705
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,372
-Good.

706
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,626
Are you okay, Mom?

707
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,546
Yeah, just some work
stuff. You ready to go?

708
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,005
Mm-hmm.

709
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:47,438
Ooh!

710
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,523
-Is Danielle
here?

711
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:50,567
-Yeah, I
think so.

712
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:57,657
Hey, Counselor.
Let's go for a ride.

713
00:42:57,701 --> 00:42:59,576
How did you
know we were here?

714
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,327
It's what I do
for a living.

715
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,079
C'mon. I got something
important to show you.

716
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,247
-Maybe not.

717
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:06,124
Oh, come on.
What is it now?

718
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,334
Here I thought we'd
reached an understanding

719
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:10,920
and now you're
being all weird again.

720
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:12,672
Can you give us
a sec, sweetie?

721
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:14,924
Mm-hmm.

722
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:18,344
Are you out of your
mind? I'm being weird?

723
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:20,013
I just got chewed out
by George because

724
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,348
someone told him I was
on a wild goose chase.

725
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:23,766
Now where would he
get that idea, huh?

726
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,226
-Beats me.

727
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:29,981
Okay. So, maybe I
complained about you

728
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:31,482
to someone and it
got back to him.

729
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:32,775
I didn't mean to
get you in trouble.

730
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:33,776
-Well?

731
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,653
I really am
sorry, okay?

732
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,822
And in fact, I'm
thinking you might be

733
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:39,907
onto something, this
whole someone else

734
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,826
being involved in
Larson's murder thing.

735
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,662
If you get in the car
we can go find out.

736
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:47,624
Fine. Let me put Crystal
in Danielle's room.

737
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,375
-Okay.

738
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:50,960
-So what's the
big surprise?

739
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,545
You figure out who
Larson was blackmailing?

740
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,306
Wait, this isn't the
way to Larson's house.

741
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,224
-No, it isn't.

742
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:08,144
I thought first we'd make
a little stop at Scratch.

743
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:09,646
Scratch?

744
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,606
-Yeah. It's a
jazz club nearby.

745
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,816
I found a drinks
receipt on Larson's

746
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,069
credit card bill from
the night of the murder.

747
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,029
I'm thinking maybe
he met the mystery

748
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:19,781
blonde woman there
that night and

749
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,658
maybe someone got
a good look at her.

750
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,993
Anyway, the waiter who was
on that night is working

751
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:27,330
so, uh.. let's
go find out.

752
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,103
Annie? You coming?

753
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,399
Yeah.

754
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:16,462
Um, I'm gonna go
to the restroom.

755
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:20,717
Are you Tony?

756
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,009
-Yeah.

757
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,052
Great.

758
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:49,954
I don't know if he met
her here that night

759
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:51,497
or if he came
in with her, okay?

760
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:54,000
Annie! Over here.

761
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,169
Sorry, you
were saying?

762
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,254
-Yeah, like
I was saying,

763
00:45:58,298 --> 00:46:00,423
I don't know if he met
the girl here that night

764
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:02,133
or if he came
in with her, okay?

765
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,468
It was a really
busy Friday night.

766
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:04,886
But you do remember
a woman being here

767
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,471
that night
with Larson?

768
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:07,513
-Yeah.

769
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:08,681
-Do you think
you'd recognize her

770
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:09,766
if you saw
her again?

771
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:10,975
-Maybe. Okay?
I don't know.

772
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:12,977
There were so many
people here that night.

773
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:14,312
-What about
surveillance cameras?

774
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,314
You guys have any kind of
security cameras in here?

775
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:19,192
-Yeah, we do but
they erase themselves

776
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,402
and then get re-taped
over every couple days.

777
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,321
-Okay,if you think
of anything else,

778
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:24,405
give me a call.

779
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:25,406
-Yeah.

780
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,532
-Thanks for
your help.

781
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:27,575
Mm-hmm.

782
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:28,951
It was
worth a shot.

783
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:34,207
Are you okay?

784
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,501
Uh, yeah...

785
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,420
I think I left my
phone in the bathroom.

786
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,823
-So how long until
we can go back home?

787
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,908
-Mm. Hopefully not
too much longer.

788
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:10,868
You know, I
can't stand it.

789
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,872
I think I'm just gonna
call Officer Mendez

790
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,166
with Judicial Protection
at this point.

791
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,001
Hopefully they'll
find him soon.

792
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,545
Yeah, that's
fine, I'm sure,

793
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:23,130
but you should get a
gun for your own safety.

794
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:26,509
Ever since Evan left, I
made a point to get one.

795
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:28,928
I keep it in my
nightstand and..

796
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:31,514
It just.. it makes me
feel more comfortable

797
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:34,058
being in the
house all alone.

798
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:37,770
I'm sure that they'll
find him soon enough

799
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:40,231
so cheer up.

800
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:43,609
Think of this as like
a fun girls' getaway.

801
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,030
At least we don't have to
cook and clean, right?

802
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:49,824
Mm. Haven't had to do
that since my divorce

803
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:51,784
so it's
nothing new.

804
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:53,578
Well, Crystal
told me that she

805
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,664
prefers the
hotel life, so...

806
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,165
Get that forehand..

807
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,917
Good job!
Good hustle!

808
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:02,086
Here we go...

809
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,131
Good job!
Excellent.

810
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,633
Well done.

811
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,806
-So what's going on
with the Larson case?

812
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,893
Well, I have a couple ideas
that probably all lead to

813
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:20,605
dead ends, but you know,
what scares me the most

814
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,940
is that they found my
hair on the pillow

815
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:24,650
and that Mark
talks about

816
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:26,652
"the woman with
blonde hair" all the time

817
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:29,196
and I know fully
well it's me.

818
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,789
Bring it in.
Awesome job!

819
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:39,957
-Thanks!

820
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,042
-Ooh!

821
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:04,106
You're Crystal,
right?

822
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,818
-Oh, yes, that's
me.. Crystal.

823
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,111
Hi!

824
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,780
-Well, hi
to you too!

825
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,365
Your mom asked
me to pick you up

826
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:14,075
and give you
a ride home.

827
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,201
-My mom?

828
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:16,786
Mm-hm

829
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,663
-Um, no she's
not coming.

830
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,665
My grandpa's coming
to pick me up.

831
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,501
Oh, hm. Well, must be
some kind of mix-up

832
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,087
but since I'm
already here,

833
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,631
why don't I just
drop you off at home?

834
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:32,051
My car's
right there...

835
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:35,137
and that way it won't
be a trip for nothing.

836
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:37,640
Hey, Crystal. Is
this your grandpa?

837
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:41,310
Oh, no. He's
on his way.

838
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:43,312
Annie's a
friend of mine.

839
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,648
She asked me to
pick Crystal up.

840
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,358
There's been some
kind of mix-up.

841
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,151
I'm gonna
head out.

842
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:50,820
I'll see you
next time, Crystal.

843
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,029
-Bye!

844
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:53,114
Bye.

845
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:02,206
He did find a
lead though. Um...

846
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,750
he found Larson's
safety deposit box

847
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:09,547
so maybe that'll lead to
something that we can use.

848
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,424
Well, is there
any way I can help?

849
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:13,509
I'll do anything
for you,

850
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:15,428
for Crystal,
for that matter.

851
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:17,972
I know.

852
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:21,308
You know...

853
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:24,520
it just
scares me...

854
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:29,025
I mean, you know
what's at stake.

855
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:34,697
I could go to
jail, or worse,

856
00:50:34,741 --> 00:50:37,324
I could..
lose Crystal.

857
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:46,375
Mark, please tell me
you found something

858
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:47,585
in Larson's safety
deposit box

859
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:48,836
that'll crack this
case wide open.

860
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,837
-I think I did.

861
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,547
I'm still looking
through it all.

862
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,924
Oh, great. Okay.
I'm on my way.

863
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:06,145
Please tell me you
found something.

864
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:08,439
-Take a look.

865
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:21,702
These look like
docket numbers.

866
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:22,787
-That's what
I figured.

867
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,622
Larson had 'em in
his safe deposit box

868
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:26,499
and needless to say
his sister couldn't

869
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:28,501
make heads or tails
of 'em so I kindly

870
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:30,419
volunteered to try and
decipher them for her.

871
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:31,629
And?

872
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,005
-And do you
want a beer?

873
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:35,007
Yeah, sure.

874
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:37,384
So I presume that Larson
handled all the cases?

875
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,136
-Yeah, some of 'em.

876
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,638
His old partner
handled some of 'em too

877
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:44,517
and in each of the
cases the defendant won

878
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,769
due to some evidence
that wasn't allowed in.

879
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:48,020
-Wait, so you're
saying that the

880
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:49,855
judge was on the take?
Or the prosecutor was?

881
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:51,440
I don't know. It
could be either.

882
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:53,025
Though, that kind of
thing is particularly

883
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:55,152
hard to prove 'cause
judges, or whoever,

884
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:57,113
can always claim
they made a decision

885
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,739
based on the
merits of the case.

886
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:00,324
I'm still looking
through the files

887
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:01,992
but, um,
hold on a second,

888
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:04,411
I gotta grab a
bottle opener.

889
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:28,894
To finding
the truth.

890
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:30,396
Truth.

891
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,277
You're leaving?

892
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,653
Ah, yeah.
You know, I..

893
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:38,946
I forgot to feed
my neighbor's dog.

894
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,906
I'll see
you later.

895
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:04,597
Hi. I am here
for that video.

896
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,058
Hey, um, I was expecting
the guy, a Mr. Evans.

897
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,852
Right. Um, I
work with him

898
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:11,187
and he wasn't
able to make it

899
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,438
so he told me
to come grab it.

900
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,106
Mm-hmm. Okay. So, it's
not actually our video

901
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:16,442
but we have this guy,
Leon, who's a regular here

902
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,360
he was actually having
a party that night.

903
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:19,945
So he's taken a bunch
of videos on his phone

904
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:21,739
and I think that
one of them caught

905
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,282
the woman you guys
are looking for.

906
00:53:23,326 --> 00:53:25,618
Here, I put it on a
thumb-drive for you.

907
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,707
Thanks.

908
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:34,460
-Yeah. You know,
it is funny though.

909
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:37,880
You do look a lot like
the woman on the film

910
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:40,883
with your hair
and your eyes.

911
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:44,386
People say I have a
common face. Thanks!

912
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,919
Great.

913
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,591
Whoa, Annie.
What happened?

914
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,801
Where's Crystal?

915
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,094
She's fast
asleep in my bed.

916
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:08,929
What happened here?

917
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:11,849
-I don't know. Quentin
Cruz, I imagine.

918
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,448
"I'm watching you.

919
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,825
Time for your
mentor to die too."

920
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:30,868
-Wow.

921
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,496
"Time for your
mentor to die too."

922
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,041
He's talking
about Judge Miller.

923
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:40,669
Oh, my god!

924
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:45,841
That means that
Cruz killed Larson.

925
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:48,093
I mean, I knew he
was following me

926
00:55:48,137 --> 00:55:50,346
but I never thought
he would kill somebody

927
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,556
in order to get
back at me.

928
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,184
Oh, my god...

929
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,436
Oh, my god!
It's all my fault.

930
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,272
It's all my fault
that Larson's dead.

931
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:02,816
I have to
warn the judge.

932
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:13,202
Come on. Pick up,
pick up, pick up.

933
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:15,079
Hey, Judge,
It's me, okay,

934
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,623
you need to be careful.
Cruz killed Larson

935
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,416
and now I think
he's after you.

936
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,586
Can you just please
call me back. Please.

937
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:29,426
Annie, where
are you going?

938
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,969
-Listen, I have
to warn the judge.

939
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:32,513
I need you to take
Crystal to my dad's.

940
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:33,931
It is not
safe here.

941
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:36,850
I'll let him know
that you're on the way.

942
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:08,942
Please leave a message
after the tone.

943
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,611
Hi, Officer Mendez.

944
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,863
Yes, this is Annie
Sagan, Assistant D.A.

945
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:15,032
Um, Judge Miller
referred me to you.

946
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,909
I believe he spoke
to you about this and

947
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:19,161
I apologize for not
following up with you.

948
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:21,747
I just honestly was hoping
that this all would pass

949
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,166
but it seems like Quentin
Cruz is a bigger danger

950
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,792
than we
originally thought.

951
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,461
He broke into my
hotel room tonight

952
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:29,421
and made some
pretty serious threats.

953
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:31,215
He needs to
be arrested.

954
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,799
Um, can you please
just give me call back

955
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,551
when you have
a moment.

956
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:56,615
Judge? Judge?

957
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:00,160
Judge!

958
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:18,345
Judge! Judge!
Judge!!

959
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,888
Annie! What
the hell?

960
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:21,515
Oh, my god,
you're okay!

961
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:22,933
-What are
you doing?

962
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:24,518
Didn't you get any
of my messages?

963
00:59:24,562 --> 00:59:26,311
-No. What
messages?

964
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:28,772
Oh god. Uh,
Cruz, you know,

965
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:30,816
the guy who's been
stalking me, right?

966
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:32,067
-Yeah. Yes.

967
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:33,735
Yeah. Well, he
trashed my place

968
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,571
and he threatened
to kill you

969
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:37,322
which means that
he killed Larson

970
00:59:37,366 --> 00:59:39,116
and now he's
coming after you.

971
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,909
I'm.. I'm fine.
Everything's alright.

972
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:43,328
Oh god.

973
00:59:43,372 --> 00:59:46,832
It was Quentin
Cruz the whole time.

974
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,918
He followed me there and
when he thought I'd left

975
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:51,628
he went in
and shot him.

976
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:52,921
-Hmm.

977
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:55,007
Probably to put
the blame on me.

978
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,175
It's okay.

979
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:01,096
You'll have him arrested
and turn yourself in.

980
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:15,485
Officer Mendez? Yeah,
did you find him?

981
01:00:19,575 --> 01:00:21,575
Are you sure?

982
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:28,540
Yeah. Okay.

983
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:31,460
Um... Thank you
for letting me know.

984
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:38,258
What is
it? Annie?

985
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:42,638
It wasn't
Quentin Cruz.

986
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,932
She said that he's been
dead for three days.

987
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:48,310
His body washed up
on a beach yesterday

988
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:50,312
and they
just ID'd him.

989
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,652
It doesn't
make sense.

990
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:58,195
I talked to him
on the phone

991
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,530
the night he left the
photos in the room.

992
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:03,200
I mean, it was.. it
was definitely him.

993
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:05,035
Annie, exactly how
long has it been

994
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:08,121
since you've had
anything to eat?

995
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:10,999
I thought so.

996
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:12,876
I'm gonna go
get us something.

997
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,921
Also, we need to
call your father.

998
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:26,056
Hey, Mark.

999
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,225
-How about that? I've
only been trying to

1000
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,102
reach you for the
last few hours.

1001
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:31,353
I'm sorry, okay?

1002
01:01:31,397 --> 01:01:33,438
I just.. I've had
a lot going on.

1003
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,190
Great. So, I guess
you don't care that

1004
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:38,235
I finally figured out who
Larson was blackmailing.

1005
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:43,323
What? You
did? Who?

1006
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:45,242
Okay. So, I went
through all the

1007
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:47,035
case files and in
two-thirds of them

1008
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:48,870
the same judge
was on the bench.

1009
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:50,956
My guess is he's
the dirty one.

1010
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:52,666
Okay, who?

1011
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,251
It's hard to believe
but in each case

1012
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:57,504
it was distinguished
Judge Ryan Miller.

1013
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:03,468
-You still there?

1014
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:10,100
Yeah...

1015
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:16,815
..and you think that
Miller killed Larson?

1016
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:18,108
-Yeah. Well, I
guess he got

1017
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:19,317
tired of having
Larson dogging him.

1018
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,652
Miller wants to go all
the way to the top.

1019
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:22,154
I doubt he wanted
Larson following him

1020
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:23,947
and asking for more
and more money.

1021
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:25,741
But this leaves us
with a problem because

1022
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,242
no judge is gonna
issue a warrant

1023
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:28,577
for Miller's
bank accounts,

1024
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,703
not without
more proof.

1025
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:31,037
What if we can link
him to the codes

1026
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:32,164
in the
appointment book?

1027
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:33,331
-I'm working on it
but I still haven't

1028
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,458
been able to
figure it out.

1029
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:35,542
I think I'm
gonna have to

1030
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:36,793
look for that
mystery blonde again.

1031
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:38,170
Maybe she has
something to do with it.

1032
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:43,049
No! I mean, please,
just stay on the files.

1033
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,262
I.. I may have
a way to get into

1034
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:49,014
Judge Miller's
bank accounts.

1035
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:50,474
-Yeah? What're
you going to do,

1036
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:51,850
go over to his
house for dinner and

1037
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:53,894
start hunting through
his personal papers?

1038
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:55,228
Something
like that.

1039
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:57,189
Just work on
deciphering those codes

1040
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:58,774
and I'll talk
to you soon.

1041
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:02,694
-Here we go.

1042
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:05,280
-Great.
I'm starved.

1043
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:13,205
I thought you said
you were hungry.

1044
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,748
Yeah, sorry...

1045
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:18,210
I must not be as
hungry as I thought.

1046
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:20,921
Actually, can I
use your restroom?

1047
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:23,298
If that's okay?

1048
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:26,259
Of course. You
know where it is.

1049
01:05:00,439 --> 01:05:02,939
Annie? What
are you doing?

1050
01:05:02,983 --> 01:05:05,025
I know what
you did.

1051
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:07,611
Annie, what are
you talking about?

1052
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:11,239
The blackmail.
The payoffs.

1053
01:05:11,283 --> 01:05:13,408
Blackmail?
What are you-

1054
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:15,243
Stop lying!

1055
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:17,621
I know that you
fixed those cases

1056
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:19,456
and that Larson was
blackmailing you

1057
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:21,333
so you
killed him.

1058
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:24,628
Killed him?
No, Annie.

1059
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,504
I would never do
anything like that.

1060
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,757
Annie, please.

1061
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,468
Yes, he was
blackmailing me.

1062
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:33,720
It was just a couple
of cases that I fixed

1063
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:36,097
for the mayor's son
several years ago

1064
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:38,058
but I was paying
Larson off.

1065
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:41,227
I wasn't happy about it
but I could afford it.

1066
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,854
Why would
I kill him?

1067
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:44,147
I don't know.

1068
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,149
Maybe because you're up
for an important new job

1069
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:48,610
and Larson was
threatening to expose you.

1070
01:05:48,654 --> 01:05:50,195
I don't know
and I don't care

1071
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:51,696
But I'm going
to the cops.

1072
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,531
Annie, you can't.

1073
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,700
You can't go without
revealing that you were

1074
01:05:55,744 --> 01:05:57,535
in Larson's
house that night.

1075
01:05:57,579 --> 01:06:00,956
If I go down,
so do you.

1076
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,457
You stay away
from me.

1077
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:03,875
What do you have
there? My files?

1078
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:05,085
Are you crazy?

1079
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,128
You're not getting
out of here with those.

1080
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:09,381
I said stay
away from me.

1081
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:10,882
Jesus. You
are crazy.

1082
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:12,676
I trusted you!

1083
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,971
I thought you were
my father's friend!

1084
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:18,807
I drove over
here to save you

1085
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:21,351
and you trashed
my place

1086
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:23,645
to make it look like
Quentin Cruz did it.

1087
01:06:23,689 --> 01:06:25,897
No. I had nothing
to do with that.

1088
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:28,817
Stop lying! I
know it was you!

1089
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:32,153
And you knew I was at
Larson's the entire time

1090
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,030
and you
acted surprised.

1091
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:36,032
I'd like to think it
was because you wanted

1092
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:38,535
to protect me, but
no, now knowing

1093
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:40,787
that you just wanted
something on me.

1094
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:42,580
You know what, it
doesn't matter anymore

1095
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,499
I'm going to the cops
and turning myself in

1096
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:46,334
right after I
turn you in!

1097
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:47,752
Annie, I don't
have anything

1098
01:06:47,796 --> 01:06:49,587
because I
wasn't there!

1099
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,673
Annie? Geez. Where
have you been?

1100
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:53,133
I've been
worried about you.

1101
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:55,593
I've been calling you
for the last two hours.

1102
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:58,596
Are you okay?

1103
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,559
-It's Miller. He
did everything -

1104
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,436
the blackmail,
the murder...

1105
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:06,980
-Shhh, it's
gonna be okay.

1106
01:07:07,024 --> 01:07:10,358
It's not.

1107
01:07:10,402 --> 01:07:12,444
Look, I've done some
pretty messed up things

1108
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:15,196
and things you don't
even know anything about.

1109
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:21,244
It's okay. Whatever
you did, it's okay.

1110
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:58,531
WHAT THE
HELL, ANNIE!!!

1111
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:02,410
I know I can't fix what
I did and I'm sorry.

1112
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:09,709
Here's all
the evidence.

1113
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:13,004
Miller's bank account
withdrawals, the gun...

1114
01:08:13,048 --> 01:08:15,632
you can check it against
the slugs that killed Larson.

1115
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,550
-And I was about to
put Jimmy Perreira

1116
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,469
away for this and
you said nothing!

1117
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:21,471
Well, this is no
laughing matter, Annie.

1118
01:08:21,515 --> 01:08:24,516
This goes way
beyond impropriety.

1119
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:27,143
I mean, we are talking
criminal charges here!

1120
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:30,355
Starting with
obstruction of justice.

1121
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:32,273
And let's just hope that
they don't slap you with

1122
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:34,192
an accessory to
murder charge.

1123
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:44,119
You know what I
have to do, Annie.

1124
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,454
Because of your father
I will make the process

1125
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:48,039
as easy as I
can make it

1126
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:49,958
but there is only
so much I can do.

1127
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:54,879
Now get the hell
out of my office.

1128
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:58,967
And don't
come back!

1129
01:09:25,704 --> 01:09:27,745
I appreciate you
calling me over

1130
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:30,832
to tell me this, Annie.
At least now we know

1131
01:09:30,876 --> 01:09:34,335
who the mystery
blonde is, right?

1132
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,546
You'll be fine.

1133
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:37,881
No, I'm
not fine.

1134
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:40,550
I lost everything that
I ever worked for.

1135
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:41,926
Not only may I
get disbarred but

1136
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:44,387
I may also get slapped
with criminal charges!

1137
01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:45,889
Do you know what
that means for Crystal?

1138
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:47,307
We'll get you
out of this mess.

1139
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,683
Everyone's
behind you.

1140
01:09:48,727 --> 01:09:50,185
I know George was
hard on you today

1141
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:52,145
but you know
he's on your side.

1142
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:54,022
And who better to
have on your side

1143
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:56,608
than the District
Attorney himself?

1144
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:58,776
Is Crystal
already in bed?

1145
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,486
No, um, she's
over at my dad's.

1146
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,572
I didn't feel comfortable
with her staying here

1147
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:04,949
ever since my
place got trashed.

1148
01:10:04,993 --> 01:10:07,869
About Judge Miller, I
spoke to George today

1149
01:10:07,913 --> 01:10:09,204
and it looks like
he's getting off

1150
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:10,788
due to lack
of evidence.

1151
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:14,209
What? Are kidding me?
Lack of evidence?

1152
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:15,627
What about the
bank statements?

1153
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,128
Or the gun?
I mean,

1154
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:19,214
I can't believe they're
not pressing charges.

1155
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:20,632
The gun
didn't match.

1156
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:24,177
It didn't?

1157
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:26,137
-Doesn't
sound like it.

1158
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:28,348
And those withdrawals
he made every few months

1159
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:30,391
he said he was buying a
lot of expensive artwork.

1160
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:32,185
There's really no
definitive proof

1161
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:33,811
linking him to the
blackmail or the murder.

1162
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:35,230
You know, I wish we
could've figured out

1163
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:36,522
what those
initials meant.

1164
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,191
Then we could've linked
Judge Miller to Larson

1165
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:39,609
to the blackmail,
and he wouldn't have

1166
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:41,361
been able to wiggle
his way out of that one.

1167
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:43,363
Yeah. But
we couldn't.

1168
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,741
-You know...

1169
01:10:46,785 --> 01:10:51,329
I guarantee that there
are answers in that house.

1170
01:10:51,373 --> 01:10:53,289
-Yeah? Well, they're
releasing the house

1171
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,166
back to Larson's
sister tomorrow and

1172
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:58,211
you legally can't work the
case anymore anyway, so...

1173
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:00,505
Yeah, I know.

1174
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:11,808
Hey Annie, I really hate
to ask, but do you mind

1175
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:13,518
taking care of
Hector for the night?

1176
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,645
I have a date and you
know what a baby he is

1177
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:17,272
about staying
home alone.

1178
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:18,648
-No, of course.
Come on, Hector.

1179
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:19,983
-Thanks. I
really owe you.

1180
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,609
No, you don't.
Who's the date?

1181
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:23,403
Uh... MYOB.

1182
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:25,029
MYOB?

1183
01:11:25,073 --> 01:11:26,489
Mind Your
Own Business?

1184
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:27,949
Remember
what I said:

1185
01:11:27,993 --> 01:11:29,409
it's all about
the acronyms?

1186
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:31,869
Geez, Annie.. Seriously,
sure it's not a problem

1187
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:33,162
'cause I might not
be home until late.

1188
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:35,039
No, go and
have fun.

1189
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:36,374
All right.
Bye, Hector.

1190
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:37,458
-Say bye.

1191
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:38,584
-I love you.

1192
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:39,919
Let's go.
Come on.

1193
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:42,588
Oh! Here
we go! Oh!

1194
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:45,550
-Who was that?

1195
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,552
It's Hector...

1196
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:49,470
Hi, buddy.

1197
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:57,603
I have a date and you
know what a baby he is

1198
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,314
Who's the date?

1199
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:00,857
MYOB. Mind Your
Own Business?

1200
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,317
What?

1201
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,027
TTYL. Talk
to you later.

1202
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,695
It's all about the
acronyms, Annie.

1203
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:07,405
Come on, get
with the ages!

1204
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:08,948
-You okay?

1205
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:12,577
Annie? Hello?

1206
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,871
Oh, my gosh.

1207
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:19,709
I think I figured out
what the initials could be.

1208
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:21,252
What?

1209
01:12:21,296 --> 01:12:22,962
I have to go
to Larson's

1210
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:24,839
-Whoa, no.
No way.

1211
01:12:24,883 --> 01:12:26,591
You can't go
back to that house.

1212
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,593
I have to. I understand
if you don't want to

1213
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:30,303
go with me but I have
to get in that house.

1214
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:31,763
Come on, Hector,
let's go.

1215
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:33,556
-Seriously? We
bring him too?

1216
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,099
-Yeah, well, he's
gonna eat my shoes.

1217
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:37,143
Let's go.

1218
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:12,261
Okay. We're here.

1219
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:14,514
So what exactly
are you looking for?

1220
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:15,807
-Larson's books.

1221
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,308
-I thought you already
checked those code books.

1222
01:13:17,352 --> 01:13:18,684
-I did, but I
didn't really

1223
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,228
pay much attention
to the titles.

1224
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:25,274
I have this
idea... Ah!

1225
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:31,322
Dang, I could
have sworn...

1226
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:38,037
-Find something?

1227
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:39,956
-Yeah.
Here it is.

1228
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,842
...so we won't have any
problem with his case?

1229
01:13:50,885 --> 01:13:53,970
No. No problem. It's
a felony gun charge.

1230
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:57,014
I'll reduce it
to a misdemeanor.

1231
01:13:57,058 --> 01:14:00,935
But this is
the last time.

1232
01:14:00,979 --> 01:14:03,771
I can't believe
we got him.

1233
01:14:03,815 --> 01:14:05,606
Yeah. Judge Miller
won't be able to

1234
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,900
weasel his way
out of that one.

1235
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,694
How'd you know?

1236
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:11,446
-I didn't.. not until
Danielle mentioned

1237
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,281
the acronyms
thing,

1238
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:15,199
the MYOB thing
or whatever it is

1239
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:17,076
and then it just all
clicked that Larson

1240
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,870
had to have hid
evidence in the house

1241
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:20,997
in case the
authorities came.

1242
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,332
What better place to
hide things than a book?

1243
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,126
It's hidden
in plain sight.

1244
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:26,586
You don't know
where it is

1245
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,379
unless you know
where to look.

1246
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:29,964
So the letters "TOC"
aren't necessarily

1247
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:31,674
a person's
initials.

1248
01:14:31,718 --> 01:14:33,509
They could be an
acronym for anything

1249
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:35,720
like the book title
Tropic of Cancer

1250
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:37,889
by Henry Miller.

1251
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:39,682
Wow. Looks like
you just found

1252
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:41,350
the last piece of
evidence they need

1253
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:42,768
to put the good
judge away.

1254
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:43,936
Good work, Sagan.

1255
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,480
-Thanks, Mark.

1256
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:46,731
But where are
you going?

1257
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:48,232
We still have
two more titles.

1258
01:14:48,276 --> 01:14:51,402
Um, I... S... SL.

1259
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:54,906
Let's see...

1260
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:58,409
SL.... SL..
oh, here it is!

1261
01:14:58,453 --> 01:15:00,620
Salem's Lot by
Stephen King.

1262
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,330
Uh-huh.

1263
01:15:02,373 --> 01:15:04,332
All right. So that
means the King

1264
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,666
would be the
name of the guy

1265
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,001
Larson was
blackmailing, right?

1266
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:08,002
-Yeah.

1267
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:09,795
You know, there
used to be a very

1268
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,589
distinguished judge
named Trevor King.

1269
01:15:11,633 --> 01:15:12,882
You think it
could be him?

1270
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:14,425
Maybe...

1271
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:20,014
Wow. Judge King.

1272
01:15:20,058 --> 01:15:22,350
Never would
have thought.

1273
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:25,102
Okay. So what's the
other one? Um, S.M.

1274
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:28,105
Here it is. Silas
Marner by George Eliot.

1275
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:33,694
All right...

1276
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:35,446
There's something
wrong with this,

1277
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:37,532
it's not fitting in.
Goddamn!

1278
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:39,075
-Oh, no. Can
your tech guys

1279
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,701
find the information
or something?

1280
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:42,078
Yeah, sure.

1281
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:43,663
But for now let's
just get out of here.

1282
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:45,248
-Okay. Yeah.

1283
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,541
We finally
figured it out.

1284
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:48,167
Finally be able
to prove it.

1285
01:15:52,173 --> 01:15:53,673
Ah. I wonder who
that third man or...

1286
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:55,383
or woman is.

1287
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:57,301
Well, the last name of the
person being blackmailed

1288
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:58,844
would have to
be Eliot, right?

1289
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:00,137
Like in
George Eliot.

1290
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:01,430
-Right.

1291
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:03,432
I don't know any judges
by that name, do you?

1292
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:05,268
It doesn't need to be
a judge necessarily,

1293
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:06,894
just someone who
could fix a case...

1294
01:16:06,938 --> 01:16:09,397
a judge, cop,
DA, anybody.

1295
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,983
Yeah, then you're
probably right.

1296
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:15,278
Wait, wasn't there a
lawyer named Eliot?

1297
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:18,155
Yeah. A guy who wore
a bowtie and glasses.

1298
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:19,365
-Maybe.

1299
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:22,368
Uh, no, I think Eliot
was his first name.

1300
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:24,912
-Uh, are
you sure?

1301
01:16:24,956 --> 01:16:26,372
-Not really.

1302
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,925
Everything okay?

1303
01:16:37,969 --> 01:16:39,760
-Yeah. I just
think I may have

1304
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:41,596
left my cell phone
at your place

1305
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:43,556
so can we maybe
swing by for it?

1306
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,849
-Yeah. Of course.

1307
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:57,403
Man, I think my allergies
are starting to kick up.

1308
01:16:57,447 --> 01:16:58,904
You have allergies?

1309
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:00,364
Yeah. Sometimes.

1310
01:17:00,408 --> 01:17:01,824
I don't have
my pills on me.

1311
01:17:01,868 --> 01:17:03,951
Can we just
drop him at home?

1312
01:17:07,582 --> 01:17:11,626
Come on, Hector.
Come on.

1313
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:13,919
Gotta go in
here. Okay.

1314
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:15,504
Come here.
Come here.

1315
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:18,424
Good boy. All right.
Go in. Good job.

1316
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:32,188
Okay, while
you're finding your phone

1317
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:34,231
I'm going to check
the directory and

1318
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:36,484
try to figure out
who George Eliot is.

1319
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:39,195
I won't be able to sleep
if I don't figure it out.

1320
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:42,531
Wait.

1321
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:44,867
You know, maybe we're
looking for a woman

1322
01:17:44,911 --> 01:17:46,994
since George Eliot
was a woman.

1323
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:49,955
And George Eliot
was a pen name,

1324
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:52,083
I'm pretty
sure. Right?

1325
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:55,294
Yeah. I learned
it in school.

1326
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:57,296
What was it? Um...

1327
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,843
-I hate to ask, but
could you please

1328
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:04,720
do something
about this dog?

1329
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:06,347
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

1330
01:18:06,391 --> 01:18:07,890
Come on
Hector. Let's go.

1331
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:10,267
Go back to your
room. Let's go.

1332
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:14,313
Go in, go in.
Good boy.

1333
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:17,274
Um. Where
was I?

1334
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:20,653
Pen name. Pen
name. Pen name.

1335
01:18:20,697 --> 01:18:21,946
Right, right, right.

1336
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:23,572
Okay, pen name,
pen name...

1337
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,074
You know what?

1338
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:26,992
I bet it's in the
preface of Silas Marner.

1339
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,327
Let's see.

1340
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:31,205
Oh, yeah, here
it is. Okay.

1341
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:32,957
So George Eliot is
the nom de plume

1342
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,543
for Mary
Anne Evans.

1343
01:18:37,714 --> 01:18:44,468
Huh. The only
Evans I know is...

1344
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:07,324
You...

1345
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:08,909
Mark Evans.

1346
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:11,537
You were the one being
blackmailed by Larson

1347
01:19:11,581 --> 01:19:13,164
and you
killed him?

1348
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:20,838
-Guilty.

1349
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:25,009
Oh, come on, Annie.
Larson was scum.

1350
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:26,927
I did the world a favor
getting rid of him.

1351
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:28,846
Why? Why did
you kill him?

1352
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:32,600
It was one
case. One.

1353
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:35,519
Early in my career, I
really needed the money

1354
01:19:35,563 --> 01:19:38,314
and his client was
willing to pay my price.

1355
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:40,608
That case got thrown
out on a technicality.

1356
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:42,818
Yeah, but after that
he thought he owned me.

1357
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:44,737
He had a tape of me
accepting the bribe.

1358
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:47,990
I just had to find
it and get rid of it.

1359
01:19:48,034 --> 01:19:50,034
And him.

1360
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:52,453
That's what you
were looking for

1361
01:19:52,497 --> 01:19:54,288
the night that
you killed him.

1362
01:19:54,332 --> 01:19:56,999
You ransacked his
house.. the tape.

1363
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:59,794
Yeah.
What can I say?

1364
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:02,546
I don't like to be
owned by anyone.

1365
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:06,300
And now thanks to you
I found the evidence.

1366
01:20:06,344 --> 01:20:09,053
-No.

1367
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:14,225
-No more evidence.

1368
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:16,769
You're psycho.

1369
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:18,896
I can't believe I
didn't see it before.

1370
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:20,815
I guess you
were too busy

1371
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,817
trying to cover
your own ass.

1372
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,485
Screw you.

1373
01:20:24,529 --> 01:20:27,029
-Ah, if only
there were time.

1374
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,284
-So you knew I was
the mystery blonde

1375
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:33,953
the whole time.

1376
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:35,579
-Yeah.

1377
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:37,873
It was really funny
how freaked out you got

1378
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,792
when I took you
back to the jazz club,

1379
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:42,086
how you tried to
change your appearance

1380
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:44,338
so the waiter
wouldn't recognize you.

1381
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:46,799
You should've
seen your face.

1382
01:20:46,843 --> 01:20:49,969
Thing was, I had
been following Larson

1383
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:52,513
all night after
the charity event

1384
01:20:52,557 --> 01:20:55,724
and I saw you go
into his house..

1385
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,686
and I saw
you leave.

1386
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:01,188
And then I went
in and killed him

1387
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:03,899
and I set it up to look
like Perreira did it.

1388
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:06,360
Did you trash my place
to make it look like

1389
01:21:06,404 --> 01:21:08,821
Quentin did it?
Not Judge Miller?

1390
01:21:08,865 --> 01:21:11,657
-Yup. Guilty again.

1391
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:14,702
Thing was, we were getting
way too close for comfort

1392
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:17,121
with that whole
blackmail investigation

1393
01:21:17,164 --> 01:21:19,290
So I thought I'll just
throw a wrench in those

1394
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:22,251
tracks and just derail
that train completely.

1395
01:21:22,295 --> 01:21:24,378
The problem was they
found Cruz's body

1396
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:26,547
way too soon.

1397
01:21:26,591 --> 01:21:30,134
His body? You
killed Cruz too?

1398
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:32,970
Yeah, I had to. After
I saw the photos he took

1399
01:21:33,014 --> 01:21:34,972
of you and Larson on
the night of the murder

1400
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:37,224
I got worried he might
have photos of me too.

1401
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:39,310
But, don't
worry, he didn't.

1402
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:41,353
I made sure to search
his place really well

1403
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:42,980
before I
killed him.

1404
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:47,651
So what are you planning
on doing with me?

1405
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:54,575
I think suicide
would make more sense.

1406
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:57,953
Would you please stop
that dog from howling?

1407
01:21:57,997 --> 01:21:59,413
You know what?
maybe I should shoot-

1408
01:21:59,457 --> 01:22:01,248
-No! Stop! Okay.
Look, I'll just...

1409
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:03,334
can I just take him
to Danielle's please.

1410
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:04,793
-Are you serious?

1411
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,837
Yes! It'll blow your
cover if you kill him

1412
01:22:06,881 --> 01:22:09,381
and if he keeps
barking, well,

1413
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,175
the neighbors are
gonna call the cops.

1414
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:14,845
Please.

1415
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:20,684
Fine. Do not do
anything stupid.

1416
01:22:20,728 --> 01:22:23,520
I will be right
behind you.

1417
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:31,612
Okay. Come
on, Hector.

1418
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:33,238
I'm gonna put
him in here.

1419
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,699
Come on, Hector.
Come on.

1420
01:22:35,743 --> 01:22:37,910
Good boy. Stay.

1421
01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:39,495
-All right.
Come on.

1422
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:41,497
Let's go
over there.

1423
01:22:53,803 --> 01:22:55,886
Anti-depressants.

1424
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:58,013
No one's gonna believe
I committed suicide.

1425
01:22:58,057 --> 01:22:59,848
They'll believe it.

1426
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:03,185
Start swallowing.

1427
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:07,106
I'm just... can I
write a note first?

1428
01:23:09,944 --> 01:23:10,901
Please.

1429
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:15,739
Fine...

1430
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:18,283
Go. Go.

1431
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:38,303
Okay. That's enough.
Take the pills.

1432
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:39,430
Please. Just...

1433
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:41,640
Enough!!

1434
01:23:46,147 --> 01:23:47,938
Faster.

1435
01:23:47,982 --> 01:23:52,317
Mark.. please,
don't do this.

1436
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:54,903
We still like each
other, right?

1437
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:56,405
Are you serious?

1438
01:23:56,449 --> 01:23:59,616
You think I'm
gonna fall for that?

1439
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,036
This dog...

1440
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:12,463
You're
hurting me.

1441
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:14,548
-Yeah, really?

1442
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:18,969
No, no... don't.

1443
01:24:19,013 --> 01:24:20,387
You just need
to go, okay?

1444
01:24:20,431 --> 01:24:21,472
The cops will be
here any minute.

1445
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:23,807
-I'm telling
the truth.

1446
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:25,642
Danielle has a
motion-activated camera

1447
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:27,394
and she probably saw
that I was in trouble

1448
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:29,104
and called the
cops. Just go.

1449
01:24:29,148 --> 01:24:33,901
You are so full
of shit, Annie!

1450
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:37,738
You should get a gun
for your own safety.

1451
01:24:37,782 --> 01:24:39,448
..made a point
to get one.

1452
01:24:39,492 --> 01:24:42,826
I keep it in my
nightstand and...

1453
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:05,641
Open the
door, Annie!!

1454
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:53,897
Are you okay?

1455
01:25:56,944 --> 01:25:59,820
Yeah...

1456
01:25:59,864 --> 01:26:01,280
I guess.

1457
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:09,538
Is he dead?

1458
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:31,935
How are
you feeling?

1459
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:33,896
-Good, I guess.

1460
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:36,398
'relieved' is probably
the better word.

1461
01:26:36,442 --> 01:26:39,651
Any issues with work
considering you were

1462
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:42,446
there the night
Larson got killed?

1463
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:44,156
Well, the
charges got dropped

1464
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,991
so that's
something.

1465
01:26:46,035 --> 01:26:48,118
Mm-hmm. Shouldn't
you be happy?

1466
01:26:48,162 --> 01:26:52,206
I am. It's just..

1467
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:54,708
I mean, that
job was everything

1468
01:26:54,752 --> 01:26:57,002
I ever dreamed
of, you know?

1469
01:26:57,046 --> 01:27:00,088
With everything I
witnessed, it's...

1470
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:03,091
it's not what I
signed up for.

1471
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:06,053
It's not the reason
I went to law school.

1472
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:07,721
It's definitely
not the example

1473
01:27:07,765 --> 01:27:10,724
I want to set
for my daughter.

1474
01:27:10,768 --> 01:27:12,392
Well, I'll tell
you something.

1475
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:14,102
There's no
better example

1476
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:16,313
you could have set
for OUR little girl.

1477
01:27:16,357 --> 01:27:19,191
Yes, she's my
little girl too.

1478
01:27:19,235 --> 01:27:20,984
But you're the
greatest mom

1479
01:27:21,028 --> 01:27:23,278
she could ever
have had.

1480
01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:25,822
I know your dad
is proud of you.

1481
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,991
Thanks.
