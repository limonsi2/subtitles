00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,416
You're bailing, aren't you?

170
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,583
I bet you no one would notice
if we snuck back home right now.

171
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,875
I would notice!

172
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,916
You know
that these people are terrible, right?

173
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,208
They're just trying to have a good time,
which is exactly what you should be doing!

174
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,583
-Come on.
-I like having a good time too.

175
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,583
Only I wanna do it

176
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,958
with people who'd actually care
if something happened to me,

177
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:18,666
or who would like me even if I didn't rent
a very dangerous waterslide.

178
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,916
Don't tell me you're jealous.

179
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,750
I am not jealous
of people who look filtered 24/7.

180
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,666
[under breath] I don't know!
Kinda sounds like you're jealous to me!

181
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,041
-[woman] Come on, Cassie, let's go!
-[laughing] Okay, one second!

182
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,541
You know,
you're different when you're with them.

183
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,458
[Cassie] I'm what?

184
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,833
It's like you think you aren't
worth anything if you aren't seen.

185
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:44,833
Well, at least I'm out making friends,
and I'm not hiding at my desk.

186
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,583
Because I think
that there is more to life than partying

187
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,833
or knowing
all the names of bartenders in town.

188
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,375
Here we go! My life isn't as important
because it's social.

189
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,291
Just because
I'm not one of your science friends

190
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,625
doesn't mean I don't work hard.

191
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,458
-I didn't say that!
-But you meant it!

192
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,458
I see how you only pretend
to be interested

193
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,333
when I tell you about some event I planned

194
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,041
or your offhanded comments
about how I'm never home.

195
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,291
Like you don't pretend
to understand my life?

196
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:07,833
[sighs]

197
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,416
Tell me what I do.

198
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,166
You work at the museum.

199
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,916
But what do I do there?

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,666
I don't know.
I don't understand that stuff.

201
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,458
And I don't understand your stuff.

202
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,500
[scoffs, chuckles wryly] Classic.

203
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,375
We never hang out anymore.

204
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,375
Just the two of us.

205
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,875
We're busy. We'll just have to get better
at making time for each other.

206
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,750
I don't know, Cassie. I don't think
being friends should feel like work.

207
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,875
I don't think it does, Lisa.

208
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,250
[emotional music playing]

209
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,083
But I can tell from your face that you do.

210
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,458
It's fine.

211
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,208
I don't wanna stay best friends
out of habit anyway.

212
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,083
I'm a habit?

213
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,000
Th-- That's it?

214
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,208
You're just gonna say something like that
and walk away?

215
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,291
Maybe it's time we both admit
that we've outgrown each other.

216
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,166
-[Cassie] Who's ready to go to Roddy's?
-[friends cheering]

217
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,083
[Cassie laughs] Let's do it.
Sorry about that, guys.

218
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,125
[door lock clicks]

219
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,666
[chuckles]

220
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,250
[shushing]

221
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,250
[laughing]

222
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,125
[breathes deeply]

223
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,833
[laughs]

224
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:42,791
Aw.

225
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,750
Mona's missing her smile.

226
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,375
Hmm.

227
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:53,541
Here's one.

228
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,500
Put this here.

229
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,000
[sighs]

230
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,416
That'll fix it.

231
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,416
Oh no.

232
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,083
No, no, no, no.

233
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,625
No. No, no, no.

234
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,958
So stupid.

235
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,750
[sighs] So stupid.

236
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,500
[sighs]

237
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,416
[knocking at door]

238
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,291
[knocking continues]

239
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,208
[sighs deeply]

240
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,750
Ow! [grunts]

241
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,458
[groans]

242
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,416
[sighs]

243
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,750
[exhales sharply]

244
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,208
[exhales sharply]

245
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,583
[pensive music playing]

246
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
[music fades]

247
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,833
[gasps, sniffs]

248
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,583
Ugh.

249
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,833
[groans]

250
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,000
[groans]

251
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,875
[pensive music continues]

252
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,041
[groans]

[groans]

254
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,541
Ow! [winces, sighs]

255
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:01,916
[exhales sharply]

256
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,500
[sighs]

257
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,625
[yelps]

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,250
[toilet playing "Ring Around the Rosy"]

259
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,041
[song ends]

260
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,875
[whooshing]

[ethereal music playing]

263
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,833
[inhales sharply]

264
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,875
[groans]

265
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,625
Ugh.

266
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,416
[ethereal music continues]

267
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:15,541
[chattering on video]

268
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,250
Uh, hi.

269
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,125
[video rewinding]

270
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:27,708
[clears throat]

271
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,125
Excuse me?

272
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,500
-[brooding music playing]
-[thud]

273
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,291
Did that go viral?

274
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,500
Oh, you're awake!

275
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,250
Welcome. Welcome.

276
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,875
No, no, don't worry.
No, it's research. It's not gone viral.

277
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:43,958
I'm Val.

278
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,333
I'll be your handler
through this transition.

279
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,791
Well, it's nice to finally meet you,
Miss Cassandra Adeline Garcia.

280
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:54,416
Now, according to my notes,
you go by Cassie. You're 25--

281
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,041
-In a few days.
-Huh?

282
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,291
Parents, Howie and Sofia, divorced.

283
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,958
Born May 31st, died May 25th.

284
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:01,875
Died?

285
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,500
Oh, I'm sorry. Died May 26th.

286
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,583
[chuckles]

287
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,333
Who… who are you?

288
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:12,041
I'm Val. Otherwise known
as your temporary guardian angel.

289
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,041
[chuckles]

290
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,458
You don't look like a guardian angel.
Shouldn't you have a halo?

291
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,750
-Oh, special occasions only.
-Okay, what about wings?

292
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,583
Oh, no, we phased those out years ago.

293
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,791
Okay.
This… this can't really be happening.

294
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,416
I was… I was just with my friends.

295
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,666
Oh! I know!

296
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,750
I… I had…
I had champagne with gold flakes in it,

297
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,166
and sometimes it makes you hallucinate.
[laughs] I'm hallucinating.

298
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,000
[laughs] No. This isn't a hallucination.

299
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,458
Oh, this… this part's always hard.

300
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,791
How can I put this?

301
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,958
Yeah, um, you died.

302
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,250
-Stop saying that!
-I mean, you saw it yourself, so--

303
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,958
-I died in the bathroom?
-Yeah.

304
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,708
Oh! Oh, this keeps getting worse!

305
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:58,833
[splutters] Look, it's going to be okay.

306
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,000
And the good news is that
the worst is over now that you're d--

307
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,041
No longer living.

308
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,875
You don't have to deal
with all of those human annoyances,

309
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,875
you know, like heartbreak or PMS.

310
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:14,291
Just think of the afterlife
as one long spa day.

311
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,625
And if you're one of the lucky ones,
it could last for an eternity.

312
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,416
So, I went up?

313
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,708
-[inhales] Well--
-Is this down? I went down?

314
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,125
You're in the middle.

315
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,750
We call this the In-Between.

316
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,208
So like general admission?

317
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,250
Sure. This is your personal waiting room.

318
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,000
It's your safe space.

319
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,916
It's designed specifically to your taste

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,125
to make your transition
more… [inhales] …comfortable.

321
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,833
So everyone who dies is in the In-Between?

322
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:52,041
Oh no. No, no, no.
Maybe I should give you a pamphlet.

323
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,458
No, no!
I don't need a pamphlet. Just tell me.

324
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,500
It can't be crazier
than anything that's happening.

325
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:01,375
Well, the In-Between
is for those who have unfinished business

326
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,375
back on Earth,

327
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:03,875
like yourself.

328
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,458
What unfinished business?

329
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,458
Well, you get a second chance
to make things right

330
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,041
with a select list of people,

331
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,375
you know, and if you succeed,
you get sent to the Above.

332
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,416
And if you don't, well, you know, it's…

333
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:21,000
it's just, it's… Yeah, it's, you know…
[whistles]

334
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,333
-It's… Yeah.
-It…

335
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,458
Yeah.

336
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:27,541
But I thought it was for murderers
and people who don't like Beyoncé.

337
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,083
-I'm a proud member of the Beyhive.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

338
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,166
No, no, it's a tiered system. Yeah.

339
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,333
You want the Above. Trust me.

340
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,125
You ready to meet your list?

341
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,458
Now? No. I'm not ready! Oh!

342
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,166
[Cassie screaming]

343
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,666
[Cassie grunts, pants]

344
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,125
Oh!

345
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,375
That was like riding a roller coaster
backwards and blindfolded.

346
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,083
[chuckles] You get used to it.

347
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,250
Wait, we're at my dad's house.

348
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,000
[whooshing]

349
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,708
[gasps, exhales sharply]

350
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,916
-[TV plays indistinctly]
-[exhales sharply]

351
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,583
Hey, Dad!

352
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,250
Hey.

353
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,166
Hey!

354
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,583
[Cassie] Why isn't he responding?

355
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,583
He can't see or hear you.

356
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,791
No one can.

357
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,708
What? No, that can't be right.

358
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,541
Well, we can't risk
scaring people on Earth.

359
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,958
They're so fragile.

360
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,208
[Cassie] Hello? Dad?

361
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,583
It's me! It's Cassie,
your favorite and only child.

362
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,291
[melancholy music playing]

363
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,916
He never let me eat junk food.

364
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,083
What is goin' on?

365
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,208
And why is this house such a mess?

366
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,541
This… this is not like him.

367
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,750
He's Downward Dad.
He's all about healthy living,

368
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,583
and he even makes his own kombucha.

369
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,750
[Val sighs]

370
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,208
How long have I been gone?

371
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:11,833
Val, how long?

372
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:12,958
-A year.
-A year?

373
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,833
It feels like a day.

374
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,708
Well, time works differently up there.

375
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,500
[sighs]
Maybe I should've taken a pamphlet.

376
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,541
[Val] Hmm.

377
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,791
[Cassie] The last time he was like this
was when my mom left.

378
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,500
After you passed,

379
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,541
he gave up.

380
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,750
When was the last time you saw him?

381
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,750
I… I don't know. I…

382
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,833
I kept meaning to visit,
but there were all these events.

383
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,625
I liked one of his posts. Does that count?

384
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,291
Mmm.

385
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,208
Yeah.

386
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,958
Is that why he's on my list?

387
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,625
He's in mourning.

388
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,791
He needs a reason to feel hopeful again.

389
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,541
Tell me what I should do.

390
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,541
You should see the rest of your list.

391
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,000
-[whooshing]
-[grunts]

392
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,083
[exhales sharply]

393
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,916
Lisa? Really, Val? No. Pass. Hard pass.

394
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,875
There is no hard pass.

395
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,875
There isn't even a regular pass.

396
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:17,458
What about if I kill it with my dad?
Not kill kill. You know what I mean.

397
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,125
Can we pretend Lisa isn't on the list?

398
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,666
Why are you so afraid
of seeing your best friend again?

399
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,291
-My former BFF, and I'm not.
-Mm.

400
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,166
[Cassie]
There's too much history between us.

401
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,375
Besides, I don't know if I want to.
Some friendships just end, you know?

402
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,791
Shouldn't I have a say
in who's on my list?

403
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,625
This is my afterlife we're talking about.

404
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,916
[inhales sharply] She's been hiding
in her work ever since you left.

405
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,958
Last one out. It's the same every day.

406
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,708
How about we skip Lisa
and move to the next name?

407
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,375
-I'll take it. No complaints. Pinky swear.
-No. I don't do that.

408
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,083
But I will show you
who's next on your list.

409
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,500
Please be Koop.
Please be Koop. Please be Koop.

410
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,291
-[whooshing]
-[Cassie gasps]

411
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,791
How are you doing that?

412
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:00,666
Oh, you can do it too.
It's all part of your basic angel package.

413
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,458
You just focus on where you want to go,
give a little snap or a nod.

414
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,375
One angel I know likes to wink.

415
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,291
[laughs]

416
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,666
Just make it your own.
And then you're there.

417
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,125
So, I can go anywhere?

418
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,291
Oh, no, not anywhere.

419
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:17,083
Your teleporting is limited
to places that you're needed only.

420
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,333
No detours.

421
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,708
-Got it.
-Right.

422
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,708
Now, back to the list.

423
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:26,708
-Ugh. I don't know if I'm ready for more.
-[woman] Morgan, slow down!

424
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,125
-Wait for Mommy!
-[Morgan giggles]

425
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,541
[woman speaks Spanish]

426
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,083
[in English] Hi, you're so fast.
[kisses] Oh.

427
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,958
-That's--
-[Val] Your mother.

428
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,541
I haven't called her that
since the day she moved out.

429
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,666
-She's Sofia to me.
-[Sofia speaks indistinctly]

430
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,416
[Morgan giggling]

431
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,125
[Cassie] Is that my half sister?

432
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,458
I've never met her.

433
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,208
-[Morgan laughing]
-[Sofia kisses]

434
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:55,375
So, you do have
some unfinished business, then.

435
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,708
[Sofia laughs]

436
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,083
[Sofia speaks indistinctly, laughs]

437
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,083
Can we go now, please?

438
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:05,750
[whooshing]

439
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,833
[emotional music playing]

440
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,750
[scoffs] It's only three names.

441
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,125
Not easy ones.

442
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,125
[tuts] Oh, you can do this, Cassie.

443
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,166
-I believe in you.
-That makes one of us.

444
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,083
You have the five Earth days leading up
to your birthday to complete this list.

445
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,625
Wait, five days?

446
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:26,875
Oh. [laughs]

447
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,875
Sure. Why not? Hey, you know what?
Why don't we make it two days?

448
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,208
Or better yet,
we can just cram it all into one!

449
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:36,750
Well, just think of it as Cassie-palooza,
the afterlife edition.

450
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,208
[laughs] It's…

451
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,125
It's… it's like Cassie…

452
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,208
No. No, you're right. Yeah.

453
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,125
Okay, right.

454
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,416
Right, so a name will disappear

455
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,083
each time
it's deemed that you have closure.

456
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,125
How am I supposed to do this
if I can't communicate?

457
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,875
Well, you'll find a way.

458
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,208
Can I text? Tweet? TikTok?

459
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,583
No, no, and definitely negatory.

460
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,166
Do I at least get cool superpowers,
like mind control or something?

461
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,416
It's guardian-angel level only.

462
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,791
This is about you learning
to really connect

463
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,333
with the people closest to you.

464
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,750
Yeah, and what if I can't?

465
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,750
Well, I'll be here if you need me.

466
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,000
Except between noon and 4:00. [chuckles]

467
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:23,166
[chuckling] I'm kidding. It's a joke.

468
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,291
Look, I'm always going to be here for you.

469
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:32,125
Now,
is there anything else before go time?

470
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,250
Well,

471
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,291
actually, I, um…

472
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:43,750
I was wondering--

473
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,833
Yeah, yeah. I know what you're thinking.

474
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,208
And, uh, yes,

475
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,250
you do get a wardrobe change.

476
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,166
[exclaims]

477
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,916
Yeah, yeah. You just close your eyes
and envision what you want to wear.

478
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But just so you know, you only get
one wardrobe change a day,

479
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,375
so make it count.

[yelps, gasps]

483
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:19,166
-It's so sparkly.
-[rock music fades]

484
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,833
I think this might be
my favorite part about being here.

485
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,083
[Val clears throat]

486
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,458
Oh.

487
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,250
I guess it really is time.

488
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:30,666

[ethereal music playing]

493
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:54,541
Somebody call Marie Kondo
because joy is not sparking here.

[sighs]

495
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,250
Lisa first.

496
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,458
Great.

497
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:13,083
Guess I'm ripping the Band-Aid off.

498
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:20,458
Okay.

499
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:23,708
What would Val do?

500
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:27,291
[inhales, exhales sharply]

[snoring continues]

509
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:04,875
Who are you,
and what did you do to my room?

-Oh.

Oh, the cute neighbor still lives here.
Are you two in love yet?

516
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:28,500
-Hey, you.
-Hey. Morning.

517
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:30,458
-Are you just getting home now?
-Yeah.

00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:32,916
I'm, uh, in the process
of scoring this game

519
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,125
about, uh, post-apocalyptic,
motorcycle-riding zombie Vikings.

520
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,458
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

521
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:40,791
It sounds lame now I'm saying it out loud,
but it's pretty dope

522
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:45,083
if post-apocalyptic, motorcycle-riding
zombie Vikings are your thing.

523
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:46,041
[chuckles]

524
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,458
You're heading to work early.
Oh, no watch.

525
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,041
Yeah, yeah, I, um…

526
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,791
I like getting to work
before everybody else, you know?

527
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:54,250
The calm is… is, um--

528
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,375
Calming.

529
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,375
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

530
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:58,875
-You get it.
-Yeah, I do.

531
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:00,250
-[Max chuckles]
-Yeah.

532
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:06,583
Cool, well, hopefully one day,
when our schedules can align,

533
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,958
um, we can properly hang out? Me and you?

534
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:10,625
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

535
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,666
-Yeah, okay. Okay. Yes, yes.
-Yeah.

536
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,041
-Yeah, I would… I would like that.
-Brilliant.

537
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:17,083
-Okay, well, um, I'm gonna go.
-Yeah.

538
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:19,416
-Cool. Well, have a good day.
-Thank you. You too.

539
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,125
-Good seeing you. Bye.
-Bye.

540
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:24,583
It's been a year,
and you still haven't gone out with him?

541
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,458
It is a good thing I'm back.

542
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:31,958
So the way we ended things…
Talk about bad timing!

543
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,458
Are you still mad at me?

544
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:39,500
I know I should still be mad at you,
but it doesn't feel right anymore.

545
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,875
-When did this place open?
-[Lisa laughs]

546
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,958
Ugh! I hate being so out of touch!

547
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,541
Morning, Emme. How are you?

548
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,083
Hi. I've got your order waiting.

549
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,916
Oh my-- Emme, you spoil me.

550
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,708
Who is Emme? I know all your friends,
and I don't know her.

551
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:58,750
-[Lisa] Okay.
-Ta-da!

552
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:02,000
Oh. Ooh. What is that smell?

553
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:06,291
I'm working on a new brownie recipe.
They're just out of the oven. Wanna try?

554
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,041
I will always be your guinea pig.

555
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,166
[Emme laughs]

556
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:17,958
So, um, how has everything been?
Are you feeling a little bit more settled?

557
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,125
[Emme] Things are good.

558
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:22,500
Haven't seen much of the town yet.
I should probably get out more.

559
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:25,083
Baked goods
aren't the best conversationalists.

560
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,041
Well, neither are bones.

561
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,125
[Emme, Lisa chuckle]

562
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:31,875
I am thinking of throwing
a one-year anniversary party for the shop.

563
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,750
That would be so cool.

564
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:34,833
Careful. It's hot.

565
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:36,958
-Oh!
-[Lisa] Okay.

566
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,791
I miss brownies. Why couldn't
I have had death by chocolate?

567
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,791
Wow. Wow.
I mean, this is… this is incredible.

568
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:46,208
Oh, it's made with love. And agave.

569
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,041
I need to go to work, but thank you.
I'll see you later, okay?

570
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,208
-Ciao for now.
-Bye!

571
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:51,125
Bye.

572
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,958
[uplifting music playing]

573
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:02,041
So, how's your list coming along?

574
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,083
The quiet type, huh?

575
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:08,166
[echoing growling]

576
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,583
[pensive music playing]

577
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:18,916
[Cassie sighs]

578
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,291
So…

579
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:27,041
this is your life now.

580
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:29,666
[groans]

581
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,333
[yawns]

582
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:34,625
Okay.

583
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:37,250
[sighs]

584
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,916
[typing]

585
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,791
-You beat me to work. Again.
-[gasps, exhales]

586
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:43,708
Oh, jumpy.

587
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,125
Are you on something?

588
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,625
Next time,
bring enough for the whole class! [laughs]

589
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:49,625
[groans]

590
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:51,458
Yeah.

591
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,916
-What do you want, Raj?
-[Raj] Did you hear?

592
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,833
Uh, hear what?

593
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:57,416
Dr. Redding's leading a dig
at Hell's Creek this summer,

594
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,166
and she's looking
for a junior field researcher to join.

595
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,583
Wait, Dr. Marion Redding?
Are you messing with me?

596
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:05,250
Not only that, the GOAT herself
is coming into the office

597
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:08,083
to hold interviews.
I'm about to go sign up over at the…

598
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:10,625
break room.

599
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,125
[whimsical music playing]

600
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,375
[Cassie] A sign-up sheet.

601
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,000
How retro. But I dig it.

602
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:23,166
What are you waiting for?
Just write your name.

603
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:25,666
L-I--

604
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,916
-[Raj] Pretty competitive, huh?
-[groans]

605
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,083
And she's only picking one person.

606
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,833
I think we all know who that'll be.

607
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:36,166
R-A-J.

608
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,750
B-R-I-T-T-O.

609
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,375
Ooh.

610
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:43,458
[winces] Only four spots left.

611
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,916
Don't listen. He's trying to psych you out
in the lamest way possible.

612
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,708
I'm gonna sign up later.

613
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:49,916
I have a lot of work to do,

614
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,750
so I can't really think
about this kind of thing right now.

615
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:54,208
Sure.

616
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:56,708
You're giving up?

617
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:59,541
In the bag, Britto.

618
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:02,916
What's so important?

619
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,166
I left a farmer in his barn-themed
waiting room for you. Are you okay?

620
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,666
It… it's Lisa. She's so stubborn.

621
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,583
You know,
I don't think this is gonna work.

622
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:14,791
She doesn't seem to miss me.
There's no trace of me anywhere.

623
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:18,750
Oh, and get this. I've been replaced
by this roommate who is full-on dark web.

624
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:23,083
-Why aren't you saying anything?
-You're saying enough for the both of us.

625
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:27,208
Look, I know going back is hard,

626
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:29,041
but you aren't forgotten.

627
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,708
Oh, I don't know about that.

628
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:36,041
Well, maybe if we cut out
all the "I"s and "me"s and look harder,

629
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:38,666
you'll find
that she actually does need you.

630
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:41,708
Whoa!

631
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:43,333
[groans]

632
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,208
[exhales sharply]

633
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:48,458
[groans]

634
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:51,583
[sighs]

635
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:54,916
Why are you sleeping?

636
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,583
There is a whole world out there,
and you are missing it.

637
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,875
Lisa. Lisa, wake up.

638
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,291
I need to talk to you.

639
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:08,958
Lisa, wake up!

640
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,583
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

641
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:15,666
Wake up! Wake up!

642
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:17,666
[sighs]

643
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,333
Come on, Val. This isn't fair.

644
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:22,375
How am I supposed to do this
if my best friend can't see or hear me?

645
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,166
I need a little help here, please!

646
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:29,875
[grunts]

647
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,916
[sighs]

648
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:44,625
[humming "Blush"]

649
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:47,041
[Lisa] Piper, turn down your game.

650
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:57,250
[humming "Blush"]

651
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,083
Trying to sleep.

652
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:04,791
[humming loudly]

653
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:08,208
-Why won't you let me sleep?
-[humming continues]

654
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:13,833
-[tinkling]
-[humming continues]

655
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:20,208
[both screaming]

656
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:23,375
[both gasping, screaming]

657
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:25,875
-What's happening?
-[splutters] I don't know.

658
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:27,791
Oh, but it worked!

659
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,791
You can't be… you can't be here. No.

660
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,333
Oh, you can see me?

661
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:33,791
This is a dream. Maybe a nightmare.

662
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,708
Work… work… work has been stressful.

663
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:37,500
You can hear me too?

664
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:40,500
[gasps]
This isn't supposed to be happening.

665
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:44,375
This is awesome,
and crazy, but mostly awesome.

666
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,708
You aren't here. Nope. You died.

667
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:47,916
Yeah, that sucked.

668
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,125
[breathing heavily]

669
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:51,375
I don't believe in whatever you are.

670
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:53,833
I'm nothing scary!
I'm like a junior guardian angel.

671
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:56,000
Well, not officially.
I don't know if that's a thing,

672
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:58,833
but that's how I make sense of it.
Titles aren't important right now.

673
00:33:58,916 --> 00:33:59,833
Oh.

674
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,125
I'll be back.

675
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,916
Not… not in an ominous way! In a good way.

676
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:07,875
It's really nice
to be able to talk to you again.

677
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,166
[Lisa hyperventilating]

678
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:16,041
[whispering] Please be gone. Please be…

679
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,708
[breathes heavily]

680
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:26,833
[exhales sharply]

681
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,666
Sorry for interrupting, but you'll never
believe what happened. Lisa--

682
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,333
Can see and hear you. Yep. Yep.
Everyone knows. You're trending.

683
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,583
I've heard rumors of this,
but I've never experienced it.

684
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:43,916
Making contact used to be fairly common,

685
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,875
but now, with all the distractions,
it's practically non-existent.

686
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:48,958
Well, it happened.

687
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:52,333
You never forget the first time
your friend looks at you in sheer terror.

688
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:54,416
[reverential music playing]

689

[angels whispering]

690
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,708
Everyone's staring at me
like I'm a unicorn.

691
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:10,083
This is the Angels' Den.

692
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,041
It's the central command
of the In-Between.

693
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:14,583
Unicorns are in a different area.

00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:23,166
[coughs]

696
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,541
A book? Really?

697
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:27,583
Yes. Don't you just love books?

698
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,166
Okay.

699
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,500
Mm. Here.

700
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,458
Yep, yep, yep. There we are.

701
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:39,333
Okay. It's quite rare.

So,

709
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:00,500
it might be a fluke in the system,

710
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:02,500
or it's just you and Lisa.

711
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,416

-Okay.

-[jazz music playing]

714
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:13,958
Go on, then. Start talking to someone.
Let's see what happens.

715
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,916
Okay. Hey! What's up?

716
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:19,250
Go on.

717
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:25,083
Hey, guys. How's it goin'?

718
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:28,375
[men speaking indistinctly]

719
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:29,708
Hello?

720
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:38,625
Hey, ladies!
Ooh! I like your shoes. [chuckles]

721
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:41,500
-[women speaking indistinctly]
-No? Nothing?

722
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:44,125
Okay. No one's responding.

723
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:50,083
I'm usually the center of the party,
not on the sidelines. This feels odd.

724
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,291
You seem strangely cheerful for someone
trying to solve a fluke in the system.

725
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,416
There's just so much energy.

726
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,875
Isn't it beautiful?

727
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:04,250
You know the saying
"angel on your shoulder"?

728
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:05,833
That's who I want to be.

729
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,583
A guardian angel who's there
through all of these stages of life.

730
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,125
Not just at the end.

731
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:13,791
So why don't you?

732
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,125
It's not my decision to make.

[barking continues]

736
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:26,500
Is this dog barking at me?

737
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:28,833
[Val] Oh, he can see you!

738
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,375
Yeah. Animals are more open
to the spiritual world.

739
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,750
Some kids are too.

740
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:36,750
No, poppet, we're working.
Go back to your owner.

[barking]

742
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:39,541
[Val] Go on.

743
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,625
So we can talk to animals?

744
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:47,875
Not we. I can.
Yeah, it's above your power grade.

745
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:49,500
-Oh.
-Sorry.

746
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:53,500
Right, so nothing from strangers.

747
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:56,083
-Nope.
-That's good, actually. Less cleanup.

748
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,333
We should try someone close to you.

[emotional music playing]

751
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,750
Not much to report
since I talked to you last.

752
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,208
Is he trying to talk to me?

753
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:18,708
I stopped seeing
that woman I told you about, Maria.

754
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:21,958
She's nice. I'm just not ready yet.

755
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:25,958
He's been doing this since you left.
Brings him comfort.

756
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:27,750
This whole room does.

757
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,791
The yoga studio's doing fine.

758
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:36,916
I'm still more focused on running it
than teaching.

759
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:42,541
There's been requests for me to teach
my sunrise class again. I probably should.

760
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:46,750
I just feel so guilty going on like normal
when you can't.

761
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,666
I miss you, kiddo.

762
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:52,250
[emotional music continues]

763
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,583
All I ever wanted was to protect you,
and I couldn't even do that.

764
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,458
Oh, Dad, but you did.

765
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:02,458
Remember that song I used to sing to you
when you were little?

766
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,166
I don't remember.

767
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:07,958
Try. Maybe I will.

That was a long time ago.

00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:40,625
I'm sorry for not visiting much.

774
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:44,791
For making fun of your Downward Dad posts.

775
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,708
I'm gonna let you know I'm okay.

776
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,333
Somehow.

777
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,166
We can try your mum.

778
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,500
I'm not ready for her yet.

[exhales sharply]

780
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm going back to Lisa. I wanna fix this.

781
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:14,208
It'll be day two, so make it count.

-You felt that too?
-[whispering] This isn't happening.

785
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:33,791
Let me explain, okay? Or at least try.

786
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:37,500
Uh, there's this list. And for me
to get to the big party in the sky--

00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:38,666
[whispering] Go away.

I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.

[sighs]

793
00:40:56,708 --> 00:41:00,333
Okay. If you don't wanna talk right now,
then we don't have to. Fine.

794
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But I'm not going anywhere until we do.

[Lisa] No, no. I'm just working too hard.

797
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:15,666
Because I'm working hard,
it could cause the visions.

Don't be shy. Come and try.

801
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,583
Why wait till it's too late?

802
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:32,166
Uh-oh. You look like you could do with
a caramel mocha pretzel bite.

803
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:33,708

804
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:36,125

This place has so much potential,
but what is with all the doilies?

00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:44,916
Would you like a calming tea or…

808
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,958
[whispering] No. I… I don't need calming.

809
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:50,500
I need an exorcist.

00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:53,125
[scoffs] Well, I can't help you with that.

811
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:55,083
[Lisa] Okay. So, um,

00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:58,041
this is the one-year anniversary
of my best friend's death.

813

-I think it's making me a little crazy.
-Your flatmate, the one you told me about?

814
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:03,625
-You told her about me?
-Yeah, Cassie.

815
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:06,708
This is gonna sound really weird, but, um,

816
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,583
she talks to me, and… [breathes heavily]

817
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:11,416
…I can see her.

818
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,541
That doesn't sound weird at all.
She was your best mate. She's part of you.

819
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:19,375
-Thank you for letting me lay this on you.
-[Emme laughs]

I just… I really, really needed
to talk to someone.

00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,541
Is she here now?

822
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:26,458
-Boo!
-Uh-huh.

823
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,791
-Yeah. Yeah. She, uh…
-[Emme] Oh.

824
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:31,166
…she thinks your store needs a makeover.

825
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,125
Oh! Well, I'm open to anything
that will encourage people to hang out.

826
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:36,750
See? She agrees with me.
I'm starting to like this Emme.

827
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:39,583
[Emme] Look, everyone deals with grief
in their own way.

828
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:43,541
-It's a compliment when they come back.
-This doesn't feel like a compliment.

829
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:49,500
-Would your friend like an eclair?
-Don't… don't encourage her, please.

830
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:52,833
Thank you for understanding, Emme.
Thank you. I just…

831
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:56,875
I think that I need to go and be by myself
for a while. I'm just gonna do that.

832
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:59,625
Who turns down a free eclair?
I can't eat, and I'd still take it.

833
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:02,791
[whispering] Could you please
just give me a little bit of space?

834
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:05,583
Okay.

-[sighs]
-How was your walk?

839
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,750
Okay, that's it. I'm Googling therapists.

840
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,125
I didn't mean to scare you. Okay?

841
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:45,708
[splutters] I am also trying
to make sense of everything.

842
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:48,791
Look, is this happening
because of that fight we had?

843
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:51,958
If I had known that was the last time
we would see each other, I--

844
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,000
I would have done things differently too.

845
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:57,041
Is that why you're here?
Be… because of what I said?

846
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:58,000
According to…

847
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,291
-Do you mean God?
-Val.

848
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:02,875
A woman? I knew it.

849
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:05,875
Val's my handler.
She's like my temp guardian angel.

850
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:08,125
In order for me to move up,
fingers crossed,

851
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:11,791
I'm supposed to help you,
my dad, and my mom for some reason.

852
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,291
Well, I don't need help.

853
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:15,916
Look, I didn't make the list.

854
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:19,416
I wanna show you something.

855
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:31,916
I found it under your bed.

856
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,541
Your dad took the rest of your stuff.

857
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:37,208
Um… [smacks lips]
You wouldn't recognize your room.

858
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:39,041
-Oh, I saw.
-Huh.

00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:11,416
Yeah. That happened.

1029
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:16,166
Um, yeah, I… I mostly work with fossils.

1030
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:20,125
I just find something so comforting
in… in holding history in your hands.

1031
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:21,583
Yeah, I get that.

1032
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:24,666
The tangible
is easier to believe in, right?

1033
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,500
Exactly. Yeah, I've always thought that.

1034
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:29,791
-On a scale of one to ten…
-Mm-hmm.

1035
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:31,916
…how big of a Jurassic Park fan are you?

1036
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,083
-No, like a 20.
-[Cassie] Twenty!

1037
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:35,916
She watched it all the time!

1038
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,416
All the time.

1039
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:41,791
I… I, um, I watched it a lot.

1040
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:43,750
And Indiana Jones.

00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:47,041

on those movies actually.

I like your geekiness.

1044
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,208
Late. It's getting late.

1045
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:55,708
Um… I…

1046
00:52:58,125 --> 00:52:59,750
I have to work tomorrow.

1047
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,875
Yeah, no. Yeah, of course.

1048
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:04,916
Um, well, look,

1049
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:07,625
thanks for having me. [chuckles]

1050
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:10,166

-That was great.

1052
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:13,916
And I'll see you soon. Yeah?

1053
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,916
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1054
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,291
-Cool.
-Cool.

I think I really like him.

1060
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:27,500
Well, then it's good you kicked him out.

1061
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,791
Okay. I need to go to bed.

1062
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,666
And don't watch me sleep tonight.

1063
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,666
It's creepy.

1064
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:35,791
Aye, aye, Captain.

1065
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:37,916
Proud of you!

1066
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:45,750
[Lisa] God, I'm so stupid.

1069
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:51,041
Why did I kick him out?

1070
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:53,083
[sighs] Smart.

1071
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:54,250
I totally blew it.

1072

Like she's my waiter for the evening.

1075
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:15,541
For God's sake, why can't I just
ask her out like a normal human being?

1076
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:17,458
I had the chance, and I blew it.

1077
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:19,291
Oh, what was I thinking?

I mean, who says that?

and you'll never speak to me again."

01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:53,708
Well,

1366
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:57,000
I'd like to be there for you
one last time.

1367
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:03,000
I don't know
why I'm supposed to care about her.

1368
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,125
She left me, you know?

1369
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,500
[inhales sharply]

1370
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:08,750
But she's on my list, so… [exhales]

1371
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,166
Well, hey, if you don't care,
then why keep her postcards?

1372
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:17,750
How can I help you with your mom?

1373
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,125
[Cassie scoffs]

1374
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,791
I can't believe she lives here.

1375
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,458
This is exactly what she ran away from.

1376
01:11:46,416 --> 01:11:49,166
-Hi.
-Hi. I was so glad you called.

1377
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:50,750
Come in.

1378
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:51,791
Thanks.

1379
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,250
[emotional music playing]

1380
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:58,750
I, um, thought
we could catch up on the patio.

1381
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:05,750
I made lemonade.
Would you like some? I have tea.

1382
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:08,416
I have one of those Jarritos.
You used to love those.

1383
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,375
[Lisa] Oh.

1384
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:11,833
Um, I think water is fine. Thanks.

1385
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:17,333
-[Sofia] How are you, Lisa?
-Good.

1386
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,250
-[Sofia] Still working at the museum?
-Yeah.

1387
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,833
[Lisa] Yeah, it's been busy,
but it's been really good.

1388
01:12:24,916 --> 01:12:26,916
-[Sofia] Good.
-How are you?

1389
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:29,708
[Sofia] Busy. Busy with Morgan.

1390
01:12:30,666 --> 01:12:32,583
-This is Morgan.
-Oh, let me see.

1391
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:36,833
-Oh, she's so cute!
-She's like Cassie in a lot of ways.

1392
01:12:36,916 --> 01:12:40,500
Yeah, look,
she's got that same mischievous grin.

1393
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:43,791
They would've liked each other.
I always wanted to introduce them,

1394
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:46,708
but I wanted Cassie and I
to be okay first.

1395
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:48,166
I'd like to get started.

1396
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:49,708
So,

1397
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:54,125
I found these
in Cassie's box of keepsakes.

1398
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:56,083
[Sofia] Oh my gosh. [chuckles]

1399
01:12:57,708 --> 01:12:58,791
She kept them?

1400
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:02,208
It was my only way to know you.
Tell her that, please.

1401
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:05,500
Yeah. I think
they made her feel closer to you.

1402
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:10,083
I used to read her Mary Poppins. [laughs]

1403
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:12,375
She always wanted to see London.
Did she ever go?

1404
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:16,041
No, I didn't go anywhere.
I was hoping you would come back to me.

1405
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:18,041
No, she didn't.

1406
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:20,708
Too bad. She would have loved it.

1407
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:24,958
Mmm. Her first crush, actually, was
this guy who moved here from England.

1408
01:13:25,041 --> 01:13:26,041
-Ian.
-[Lisa] Ian.

1409
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:30,041
It's one of the many things we have…
had in common.

1410
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:32,958
I missed so much of her life.

1411
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:36,541
It must have been confusing for her,
dealing with boys and dating.

1412
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:40,958
Yeah, but my mom was there for both of us
to answer some of the tough questions, so…

1413
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:42,416
Ask her why she left.

1414
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:44,541
[breathes deeply]

1415
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:48,208
I'm sure that this is, like,
really hard to talk about, but, um…

1416
01:13:50,625 --> 01:13:52,541
Cassie always wanted to know why you left.

1417
01:13:53,458 --> 01:13:55,875
There's not one reason.

1418
01:13:56,541 --> 01:13:57,875
What did I do to make you leave?

1419
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,916
Was it something Cassie did?

1420
01:14:01,791 --> 01:14:03,333
No, never.

1421
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:06,583
Cassie, she was an angel.

1422
01:14:08,375 --> 01:14:09,541
It was all me.

1423
01:14:10,416 --> 01:14:11,250
I…

1424
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:12,958
I was young.

1425
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:16,333
And I thought I knew more
than anyone around me.

1426
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:17,291
Sounds like Cassie.

1427
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:19,833
I, uh, had this romantic idea

1428
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:22,458
of what I thought
being a wife and mother was like.

1429
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:23,458
[Lisa] Mm.

1430
01:14:24,458 --> 01:14:25,416
But in reality,

1431
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,958
I wasn't ready
to be responsible for anyone.

1432
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:34,375
Looking back at it,
I see how patient and loving Howie was,

1433
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,458
but at the time,

1434
01:14:37,791 --> 01:14:39,750
I found that suffocating.

1435
01:14:39,833 --> 01:14:41,208
I said the same thing.

1436
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:44,416
For a while, Howie used to send me

1437
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:47,666
pictures and letters,

1438
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,000
telling me about her.

1439
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:50,500
I never knew that.

1440
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,458
But I was too ashamed to respond,
so he stopped.

1441
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:59,541
I convinced myself that postcards
were an adequate placeholder,

1442
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:03,833
and one day I'd be able to explain it all,
and we'd actually laugh about it.

1443
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,125
[laughs]

1444
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:09,458
Sounds so ridiculous
when I say it out loud.

1445
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:12,333
I… I let her down.

1446
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:16,166
The last time I saw her
was college graduation,

1447
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:17,625
and we were like strangers.

1448
01:15:17,708 --> 01:15:18,708
I remember.

1449
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:21,916
Now it's too late to make it right.

1450
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:26,125
And I'll never forgive myself for that.

1451
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:29,333
Okay, I've heard enough.
[clears throat] I need to go.

1452
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:30,750
If Cassie was here right now,

1453
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:33,500
what would you say to her?

1454
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:35,625
What are you doing? I didn't ask that.

1455
01:15:39,375 --> 01:15:41,708
That I regret not taking her to London.

1456
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:46,375
I should have been there

1457
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:48,958
to help her with her homework,

1458
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:52,916
hold her when she had a nightmare.

1459
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:57,916
I made a lot of selfish decisions.

1460
01:15:59,666 --> 01:16:01,500
But one thing that never changed--

1461
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:02,708
[sobs]

1462
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:07,583
One thing that never changed
was my love for her. [clears throat]

1463
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:10,000
If Cassie were here…

1464
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:14,875
I would tell her that the day she was born

1465
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:18,625
was one of the brightest moments
of my life.

1466
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:24,208
And running away,

1467
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:26,958
it was my worst.

1468
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:33,750
I just hope she knows how sorry I am.

1469
01:16:35,541 --> 01:16:36,416
She does.

1470
01:16:37,416 --> 01:16:38,250
She knows.

1471
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:52,041
Are you okay?

1472
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:56,541
[sighs]

1473
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:58,833
[engine starting]

1474
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:04,291
[emotional music playing]

1475
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:16,541
[door lock clicks]

1476
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:20,708
[Lisa] Hey.

1477
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:22,458
Hey.

1478
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:29,416
How are we supposed to we finish this
if we don't have all the pieces?

1479
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:33,333
God, this is so frustrating.
Why did you even choose this puzzle?

1480
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:35,750
Uh, you sure
you wanna talk about the puzzle?

1481
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:39,208
Do you know how hard it was

1482
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:41,250
not being able
to say everything I wanted to her?

1483
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:42,916
I really don't.

1484
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
[scoffs]

1485
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:45,875
I have years of questions.

1486
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:51,333
Yet standing next to her, I found
that I just wanted to yell or run away.

1487
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,500
Like mother, like daughter.

1488
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:56,500
Yeah, but you didn't,
and that's a really good thing.

1489
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:58,291
Would you have translated if I did?

1490
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,791
It upset me
that you took the conversation over.

1491
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:03,750
No, no. I didn't take anything over.

1492
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:06,291
I could tell
that she needed to talk to you,

1493
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:08,291
and you needed to hear
what she had to say.

1494
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:09,500
That was for me to decide!

1495
01:18:10,416 --> 01:18:12,583
-I'm on your side, Cassie.
-Ugh.

1496
01:18:12,666 --> 01:18:16,208
I could tell she needed to talk.
You needed to hear what she had to say!

1497
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,291
You don't get it!

1498
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:18,708
How could you?

1499
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:21,958
You have a perfect life, a perfect future.
I have none of those.

1500
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:27,416
Okay, okay. You're mad at your mom.
That's totally understandable, but…

1501
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:30,041
You know what? It's… [sighs]

1502
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:32,333
It's not okay
for you to take it out on me.

1503
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,625
Sorry. Does my messy non-life
make you uncomfortable?

1504
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:35,916
Here we go again. Classic.

1505
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,416
I died before I ever got a chance to live!

1506
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,875
Well, I'm hurt too!
Did you think about that, huh?

1507
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:43,250
God, after our fight,

1508
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:46,541
after you left, I had to carry around
the guilt of our fight.

1509
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:49,625
I had to pick up the pieces,
put my life back together without you.

1510
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:52,625
Well, you did a great job.
Look around! There's nothing left of me!

1511
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:55,125
I've been reduced to a box of knickknacks!

1512
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:56,500
[both sob]

1513
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,083
After everything that's happened,
I can't believe we're back to arguing.

1514
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:01,916
Yeah.

1515
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:03,958
Well, I'm dead,

1516
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:07,291
so you don't have to worry
about arguing with me ever again.

1517
01:19:09,125 --> 01:19:10,416
[whooshing]

1518
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:14,541
[melancholy music playing]

1519
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:15,791
[whooshing]

1520
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,750
You cannot bring that anger in here.

1521
01:19:20,833 --> 01:19:24,416
Look, I… I met with my mom.
I got Lisa a boyfriend.

1522
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,875
I've been talking to my dad
even though he can't hear me.

1523
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:29,291
Isn't that enough? Do I have to go back?

1524
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:31,041
Well, not if you don't want to.

1525
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:32,125
Thank you.

1526
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:36,708
Well, then, why don't I just walk you
over to the elevator?

1527
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:39,375
When you get there, hit "B" for Below.

1528
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:41,833
-Very funny. I get it.
-No, you don't.

1529
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:45,833
Why would you risk throwing away
everything you've worked toward?

1530
01:19:45,916 --> 01:19:47,125
And over an argument?

1531
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:49,541
You were doing so well.

1532
01:19:49,625 --> 01:19:52,791
-You think I'm doing well?
-Yes, I do. Don't you?

1533
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,250
I don't know. Maybe.

1534
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:59,750
I hoped I wouldn't have to tell you this,
but here we are.

1535
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:03,833
If you really want this to end now,
I can make that happen.

1536
01:20:03,916 --> 01:20:07,875
But just know,
if you leave the list unfinished,

1537
01:20:07,958 --> 01:20:10,666
then all the good you've been doing
will be undone.

1538
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:12,333
Poof.

1539
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:15,458
Everything?

1540
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:17,458
Lisa?

1541
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:18,916
My dad?

1542
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,250
Everything.

1543
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:26,916
Oh, that's… that's terrible.

1544
01:20:28,208 --> 01:20:29,416
[sighs]

1545
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,791
I can't… I can't do that to them.

1546
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:38,250
-[exhales sharply]
-So, you've made your decision?

1547
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:49,041
[whooshing]

1548
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:50,416
[exhales]

1549
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,458
Dad, I really need to talk--

1550
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:55,875
-What is she doing here?
-More tea?

1551
01:20:55,958 --> 01:20:56,875
Please.

1552
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:01,083
I still can't believe
you left your accounting practice

1553
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:02,500
to open a yoga studio.

1554
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:05,666
You always joked about it,
but I never thought you'd actually do it.

1555
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:08,625
[Howard] I also joked about
becoming a drummer in an '80s cover band.

1556
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:12,083
-[chuckles] I remember that one.
-This was a better lifestyle choice.

1557
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:14,041
[chuckles] It suits you.

1558
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,666
You might not have said that
a few days ago.

1559
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,833
This past year has been a challenge.

1560
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,833
[Sofia] You know, Lisa visited me today.

1561
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:23,583
I know this may sound nutty.

1562
01:21:23,666 --> 01:21:25,083
During that visit, it…

1563
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:29,291
it was almost as though
Cassie were standing right beside me.

1564
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:30,750
I know what you mean.

1565
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,625
She was a lot like you though.

1566
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:36,041
Fearless, independent.

1567
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:39,958
She'd dive headfirst
into… [chuckles] …any situation.

1568
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:42,166
But more than anything,

1569
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:45,875
she was this force of energy
who lit up every room she entered.

1570
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:51,375
After Lisa left, I, um…

1571
01:21:52,916 --> 01:21:55,291
I had this overwhelming urge to see you.

1572
01:21:56,041 --> 01:22:00,916
I just need you to know
how deeply sorry I am for walking out.

1573
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:05,166
It wasn't how I saw life going,
that's for sure.

1574
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:09,166
Your leaving forced me to become
a better man, a better parent,

1575
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:11,666
even when she didn't want me to,

1576
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:16,458
and I hope that in some way I was able
to minimize whatever scars she had.

1577
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,166
Yeah, I know you did.

1578
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:24,750
[clears throat]
Look, I've kept you long enough.

1579
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:26,666
Thanks for this. [chuckles]

1580
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:31,125
You know, I don't know
if it's the palo santo in the air

1581
01:22:31,208 --> 01:22:32,958
or this dandelion tea talking,

1582
01:22:33,041 --> 01:22:35,583
but I feel as though Cassie,
wherever she is--

1583
01:22:35,666 --> 01:22:36,875
Brought us back together.

1584
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:41,625
[emotional music playing]

1585
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:53,916
[Cassie] Mom, wait!

1586
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:58,875
[emotional music continues]

1587
01:23:03,291 --> 01:23:04,583
[tinkling]

1588
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:09,041
I forgive you.

1589
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:20,000
[engine starting]

1590
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:36,708
[tinkling]

1591
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:48,083
-[whooshing]
-[sighs]

1592
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:50,041
So proud of you.

1593
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:51,166
That felt good.

1594
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:54,250
I can tell. I mean, you seem lighter.

1595
01:23:56,666 --> 01:23:57,750
Hey, so, um…

1596
01:23:58,916 --> 01:24:01,333
I need a favor.
It's for a good cause, I swear!

1597
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:02,458
No swearing.

1598
01:24:02,541 --> 01:24:03,750
I didn't actually swear!

1599
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:08,166
There's this bakery, and the owner
seems like a really thoughtful person.

1600
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:12,583
I know she's not on my list, but I think
I can help her and help my dad.

1601
01:24:12,666 --> 01:24:14,541
We're not running
a matchmaking service here.

1602
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:17,458
I know, but they could both use
a kind person in their life.

1603
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:19,333
This could also be a thank-you to Emme

1604
01:24:19,416 --> 01:24:21,916
for being such a good friend to Lisa
since I've been gone.

1605
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,083
[Val scoffs]

1606
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:29,625
I've never had anyone
want to add to their list before.

1607
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:33,958
I've also never had
anyone like you before.

1608
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,375
[clicks tongue] I'll allow it.

1609
01:24:36,458 --> 01:24:38,833
-[exclaiming] Thank you!
-Oh!

1610
01:24:38,916 --> 01:24:41,291
You're the best! Thank you! Thank you!

1611
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:43,625
Yeah, but you're
still on the same timeline.

1612
01:24:43,708 --> 01:24:45,833
Tomorrow is your last day, Cassie.

1613
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:47,791
I got this. [sighs]

1614
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:49,958
[whooshing]

1615
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:52,083
Perfect.

1616
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:55,750
[whimsical music playing]

1617
01:24:57,041 --> 01:25:00,750
I can't leave it like this.
It's a bakery, not Grandma's basement.

1618
01:25:00,833 --> 01:25:02,833
[uplifting music playing]

1619
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:09,666
[whimsical music playing]

1620
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:23,875
[door closes]

1621
01:25:45,375 --> 01:25:47,083
Are you behind this too, Cassie?

1622
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:52,208
I like your faith in me, Dad.

1623
01:25:59,333 --> 01:26:00,666
[whooshing]

1624
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:02,458
[TV playing indistinctly]

1625
01:26:02,541 --> 01:26:05,916
[woman on TV] …and has traveled the world
searching for the perfect dessert…

1626
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:10,083
[Sofia] Morgan, mijita, are you dressed?

1627
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:12,833
[in Spanish]
We're leaving in five minutes.

1628
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:14,958
[in English] We don't wanna be late again.

1629
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
[emotional music playing]

1630
01:26:30,708 --> 01:26:32,083
Would you like some tea?

1631
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:35,458
You can see me?

1632
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:37,875
I saw you at the park too.

1633
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:44,083
Aren't you scared?

1634
01:26:45,208 --> 01:26:46,958
You're my guardian angel.

1635
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:55,666
Ask your mom to read this to you.

1636
01:26:57,625 --> 01:26:58,750
I will.

1637
01:26:58,833 --> 01:27:00,625
This is our secret, okay?

1638
01:27:03,666 --> 01:27:05,666
[emotional music continues]

1639
01:27:13,541 --> 01:27:14,791
[woman whispers] Dr. Redding.

1640
01:27:14,875 --> 01:27:17,541
[upbeat music playing]

1641
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:34,625
[exhales sharply]

1642
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:40,541
[pensive music playing]

1643
01:27:42,375 --> 01:27:43,875
I wish Cassie was here.

1644
01:27:45,541 --> 01:27:46,750
[Cassie] I'm right here.

1645
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:49,333
Hey.

1646
01:27:49,416 --> 01:27:50,250
Hey.

1647
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,958
I do have a piece of you.

1648
01:27:58,041 --> 01:28:00,125
-It's from our very first puzzle.
-Yeah.

1649
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:03,000
It's, uh, it's kinda like my lucky charm.

1650
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,541
I thought you were done with me.

1651
01:28:08,666 --> 01:28:10,916
There are no grudges in the afterlife.

1652
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:13,458
Are there any here?

1653
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:18,000
No. No, no. I do not wanna lose
any more time with you.

1654
01:28:18,083 --> 01:28:20,416
-[sobs] Neither do I.
-[whispering] No, no, no!

1655
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:23,458
-I don't think I can explain an air hug.
-Good point.

1656
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:24,375
Yeah.

1657
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:27,583
Okay, so what's the problem?
Why are you hesitating?

1658
01:28:27,666 --> 01:28:28,875
This is yours to lose.

1659
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:30,041
Yeah, exactly.

1660
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:32,500
Cassie, what if I don't get it? What then?

1661
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:35,208
You'll survive, and you'll go on
to something even better.

1662
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:37,000
No. No.

1663
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:40,166
[sighs] Look at me. Do you want this?

1664
01:28:42,666 --> 01:28:45,166
-Yeah.
-Are you the best person for this job?

1665
01:28:46,875 --> 01:28:47,958
[hesitates] Yeah.

1666
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:49,791
I'm not buying that yeah.
You gotta try again.

1667
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:51,791
Are you the best person for this?

1668
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:54,083
Yeah! I am the best person for this!

1669
01:28:54,166 --> 01:28:56,916
Yes! There's my strong friend!
Life is too short to be fearful.

1670
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,791
Yeah, Cassie,
I eat, I sleep, I drink this job.

1671
01:28:59,875 --> 01:29:03,666
If I got this job, I'd crush it so hard,
they'd name a freaking fossil after me.

1672
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:05,833
-I would--
-Use that energy and go sign up!

1673
01:29:05,916 --> 01:29:09,166
Right! Sign up first. Dominate second.

1674
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:11,291
-Yes.
-[exhales sharply, grunts]

1675
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:13,250
Oh, I've created a monster.

1676
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:15,083
I love it.

1677
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,291
Phew. Bam, bam. Good luck.

1678
01:29:27,166 --> 01:29:28,166
[sighs]

1679
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:33,916
Hi. [chuckles]

1680
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:37,416
I've heard nice things about you, Lisa.

1681
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,333
-Thanks.
-I'm glad you decided to interview.

1682
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:41,791
And last too.

1683
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:43,625
That's a bold move.

1684
01:29:44,208 --> 01:29:47,375
Shows the competition
you're not worried about who came before.

1685
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:49,416
Oh, um, I didn't plan that--

1686
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,750
Modesty's a myth
that was sold to women a long time ago.

1687
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:54,666
Be proud of your work.

1688
01:29:55,875 --> 01:29:57,375
Why paleontology?

1689
01:29:59,416 --> 01:30:01,000
I love digging in dirt,

1690
01:30:01,083 --> 01:30:05,458
and I hated when people told me
that it wasn't a proper career for a lady.

1691
01:30:05,541 --> 01:30:10,750
But, uh, mostly, I found it comforting
studying what is real.

1692
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:15,125
With fossils, it's like this tangible
connection to the past, you know?

1693
01:30:15,708 --> 01:30:17,583
But, uh, now I've…

1694
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:20,416
I've started learning from what I…

1695
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:22,625
I can't see.

1696
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:26,625
-Bye.
-Bye.

1697
01:30:26,708 --> 01:30:27,833
-Bye.
-See you.

1698
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:34,125
Cassie?

1699
01:30:36,125 --> 01:30:38,541
-I got it! I got it!
-[screaming]

1700
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:41,583
-I got the job! I got it!
-You got it! [squeals]

1701
01:30:41,666 --> 01:30:44,750
Thank you so much for the push.
I couldn't have done it without you.

1702
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:47,708
-It was all you.
-No, I can't even believe I did it.

1703
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:50,875
-Um, I can!
-This is, like, the best day of my life.

1704
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:53,291
-So proud of you!
-Thank you.

1705
01:30:53,875 --> 01:30:57,541
So, are you gonna come to Emme's tonight?
I'm bringing Max.

1706
01:30:57,625 --> 01:30:58,916
I wouldn't miss it.

1707

1709
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:19,458
You made it!

1710
01:31:20,916 --> 01:31:22,750
[Emme] Thank you so much for coming.

1711
01:31:26,041 --> 01:31:28,083
Excuse me. Hello.

1712
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:30,125
I think I'm in the right place?

1713
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:33,291
If you're here for the party,
then yes, you are. I'm Emme.

1714
01:31:33,791 --> 01:31:35,833
Would you like a homemade fortune cookie?

1715
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:37,500
-Don't mind if I do.
-[Emme chuckles]

1716
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:44,083
-"You don't need to look any further."
-[Emme] Oh.

1717
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:46,000
I guess this is the right place.

1718
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:48,833
How did you hear about my little soiree?

1719
01:31:48,916 --> 01:31:51,333
Honestly,
my home was filled with your fliers.

1720
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:55,958
No explanation. I have my suspicions,
but no one would believe them.

1721
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:57,791
Well, since we're being honest,

1722
01:31:57,875 --> 01:32:00,166
my shop didn't look like this
when I closed up last night.

1723
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,916
I woke up this morning, and voilà.

1724
01:32:04,208 --> 01:32:06,041
I've got my suspicions too.

1725
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:09,958
Someone's either looking out for us,
or we need to get our locks changed.

1726
01:32:10,041 --> 01:32:12,125
[both laugh]

1727
01:32:12,208 --> 01:32:13,541
Can I get you a green tea?

1728
01:32:13,625 --> 01:32:15,625
-I've got sencha, matcha--
-Matcha?

1729
01:32:15,708 --> 01:32:16,791
Of course.

1730
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:20,208
-What did you say your name was again?
-Howard.

1731
01:32:21,208 --> 01:32:23,291
-Some people call me Howie.
-Howard.

1732
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:25,500
It means "strong heart."

1733
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:28,166
Well, that went better than expected.

1734
01:32:29,958 --> 01:32:31,708
-[indistinct chattering]
-[Max] Wow.

1735
01:32:32,625 --> 01:32:36,250
It is fascinating the many ways
that people can make a living, isn't it?

1736
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:37,791
-Look at that.
-Come on.

1737
01:32:37,875 --> 01:32:39,041
[both chuckle]

1738
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:42,041
Okay.

1739
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,750
[Emme] I'd really love to do
gluten and dairy-free.

1740
01:32:45,833 --> 01:32:47,541
That's a new development.

1741
01:32:48,416 --> 01:32:49,708
Come on. I'll introduce you.

1742
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:51,541
[Emme] Hey, look.

1743
01:32:52,625 --> 01:32:54,458
-Hi, Mr. Garcia.
-Lisa!

1744
01:32:54,541 --> 01:32:55,791
-Hi.
-Oh!

1745
01:32:56,708 --> 01:32:58,791
-What are you doing here?
-I could ask you the same.

1746
01:32:58,875 --> 01:33:01,250
-Welcome to the party.
-Hi, Emme! Hi!

1747
01:33:01,333 --> 01:33:05,750
She's one of my regulars. And I suspect
is some of the reason I had this makeover.

1748
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:07,375
If only I knew how you got in here.

1749
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:09,375
Well, I'll never tell.

1750
01:33:09,958 --> 01:33:12,083
So this is Max. He's, um,

1751
01:33:13,916 --> 01:33:14,791
my…

1752
01:33:15,625 --> 01:33:17,000
[splutters] Boyfriend. Hi.

1753
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:20,666
-Uh, wait, sorry. Is that cool?
-One hundred percent.

1754
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:22,541
And how do you two know each other?

1755
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:24,833
Lisa and my daughter were best friends.

1756
01:33:24,916 --> 01:33:27,125
-What? Are you Cassie's dad?
-Yeah.

1757
01:33:27,208 --> 01:33:28,958
[Emme] I've heard a lot about her.

1758
01:33:29,041 --> 01:33:31,041
[indistinct chattering]

1759
01:33:34,166 --> 01:33:36,708
Um, I just have to make a call.
I'll be right back.

1760
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:37,958
-All right.
-Okay.

1761
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:42,333
Someone has been busy.
Are you still playing Cupid?

1762
01:33:42,416 --> 01:33:45,041
Can I help it if their paths crossed?
[laughs]

1763
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:46,708
You still can't talk to him, huh?

1764
01:33:46,791 --> 01:33:47,666
No.

1765
01:33:48,166 --> 01:33:52,250
It's my last day. But he seems happier,
and that's what's important.

1766
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:53,416
Huh.

1767
01:33:54,041 --> 01:33:55,166
What's with the "huh"?

1768
01:33:56,208 --> 01:33:58,041
You can go anywhere I can go, right?

1769
01:33:58,125 --> 01:33:59,791
I mean, if I'm needed. Why?

1770
01:33:59,875 --> 01:34:03,375
After this party,
I need you to find me. No questions asked.

1771
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:06,833
-What are you up to?
-You're not the only one with surprises.

1772
01:34:07,541 --> 01:34:10,541
You have to find me after
and not before, okay?

1773
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,250
-Okay.
-Okay.

1774
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:20,125
[whooshing]

1775
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:21,666
[Lisa] Hey, everyone.

1776
01:34:22,166 --> 01:34:24,583
I wanna thank you so very much for coming.

1777
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:29,000
We're obviously here
because of our beloved Cassie,

1778
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:33,166
um, who left us a year ago this week,
but, um,

1779
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:36,375
I really don't want this to be about loss

1780
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:40,125
because this is also the week
that she came into our lives.

1781
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,458
One thing we know about our Cassie
is that her joyous life was a party.

1782
01:34:45,958 --> 01:34:47,416
[laughter]

1783
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:51,375
Especially the week of her birthday,
or as she called it…

1784
01:34:52,208 --> 01:34:53,708
-Cassie-palooza.
-Cassie-palooza.

1785
01:34:54,791 --> 01:34:58,333
[smacks lips] So, these wish lanterns
that you're holding

1786
01:34:58,416 --> 01:35:00,833
will carry whatever you wanna say to her.

1787
01:35:00,916 --> 01:35:03,708
And as they float across the water,

1788
01:35:03,791 --> 01:35:07,791
your thoughts will be sent to her.

1789
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:11,458
[whispers] Okay, Morgan,
why don't you go first? Okay?

1790
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:17,291
Hey.

1791
01:35:17,375 --> 01:35:21,750
Hey. This entire time, I thought
I was the one helping all of you, but…

1792
01:35:23,666 --> 01:35:25,250
all this has me realizing that…

1793
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:29,000
you were the ones helping me.

1794
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:33,291
I'm not… I'm not ready to lose you again.

1795
01:35:33,375 --> 01:35:36,708
We got a second chance.
Not everyone can say that.

1796
01:35:37,916 --> 01:35:40,541
I want you to know
you're more than just my best friend

1797
