1
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,226
Farewell, Pinky.

2
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,634
The potatoes!

3
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:03,996
Potatoes?

4
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:05,995
Potatoes...

5
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:07,394
Pinky...

6
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,202
Pinky, what do you mean?

7
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:12,136
Oh...

8
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:15,202
Oh, Pinky.

9
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:43,400
Be free, Sylvia.

10
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:47,336
Don't worry.

11
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:48,735
I'll be OK.

12
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:51,836
I wasn't always this alone.

13
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:54,763
My childhood
was full of people.

14
00:03:55,437 --> 00:03:57,103
Hmm...

15
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,299
Dad used to say that childhood
was like being drunk.

16
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,496
Everyone remembers
what you did, except you.

17
00:04:05,497 --> 00:04:08,328
But my childhood
was sobering, Sylvia.

18
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:10,361
I remember everything,

19
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:13,562
right from the start.

20
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:16,833
I'd always liked
feeling caged in,

21
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:20,103
snug, and protected.

22
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:24,569
It was a shock
to be born premature.

23
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,933
I wasn't fully baked,

24
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:29,136
and looked like a baby rabbit.

25
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:33,427
I was named
Grace Prudence Pudel.

26
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:36,769
My twin brother, Gilbert.

27
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,162
The nurse said
we had two souls,

28
00:04:39,163 --> 00:04:41,502
but one heart.

29
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:44,200
Mmm. I liked that.

30
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,535
Our birth was
very strenuous for Mum,

31
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:50,535
and she died.

32
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:52,569
We left her womb

33
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,268
and she entered her tomb.

34
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:57,835
Mother snails do the same

35
00:04:57,836 --> 00:05:00,070
after they've had their babies.

36
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:02,532
Don't they, Sylvia?

37
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:08,101
As I grew older,

38
00:05:08,102 --> 00:05:10,635
I suffered a smorgasbord
of afflictions.

39
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:16,134
I was always back in hospital
for something.

40
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:18,595
The doctor said
I was like a china doll

41
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:21,268
you could shatter
with just a stare.

42
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:26,262
Eventually, they needed to
fix my floppy lip.

43
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,466
Things went bad.

44
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:41,668
I lost so much blood,

45
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:43,870
I needed a transfusion.

46
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:47,670
The doctor asked Gilbert
if he'd give me his.

47
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:49,293
Huh?

48
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,532
Oh.

49
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,334
He said yes,

50
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:04,460
even though he thought
he'd have to die to save me.

51
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:06,633
How long before I die?

52
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:10,164
They quickly explained
he wouldn't die.

53
00:06:10,165 --> 00:06:12,160
His body would make new blood.

54
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:14,364
Oh.

55
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:16,865
He became everyone's hero
that night.

56
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:19,169
Especially mine.

57
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:21,232
To cheer me up,

58
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:24,332
Dad gave me
Mum's old jewellery box.

59
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,433
Ooh!

60
00:06:32,035 --> 00:06:34,436
Inside, it had
her snail collection,

61
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,768
and her ring.

62
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:38,768
She'd loved snails as well,

63
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:41,233
and had been a malacologist.

64
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,766
I thought Gilbert
should have the ring.

65
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,235
Ooh.

66
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:48,598
I'm going to wear this
till the day I die, Gracie.

67
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,961
Despite my woes, Sylvia,

68
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:21,827
I believed in glasses half-full
and silver linings.

69
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:25,066
Gilbert's glass
was half-empty, though.

70
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:28,037
I remember
how he was often sad.

71
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:31,500
It seemed like he had a secret
he wanted to tell.

72
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:36,569
He was like Holden Caulfield,
James Dean and Charlie Brown

73
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,527
all rolled into one.

74
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:40,402
He saw people as a threat.

75
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:45,935
At school, he was always
my warrior, my defender.

76
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:48,427
Rabbit face, rabbit face,

77
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:50,732
rabbit face, rabbit face.

78
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:54,427
Give me that.

79
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:05,401
Hey, morons.

80
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,467
Hmm?

81
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:35,898
Agh!

82
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,935
...able to breed
a chicken with a giraffe.

83
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:53,266
He said that
he's able to lay eggs,

84
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,900
but has a really long pecker.

85
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,493
Our home was our sanctuary,

86
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:59,465
a place where we felt safe

87
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:03,865
to read our books
and watch our favourite shows.

88
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:10,562
I loved my bedroom.

89
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:15,969
It's where
everything was just so.

90
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,866
Right angles brought me
enormous comfort,

91
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:21,400
as did my snails, Sylvia.

92
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:25,229
They were my friends,

93
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,296
so I made more of them.

94
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:30,830
I knew they'd never leave me,

95
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:32,598
hurt me.

96
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:35,202
Or die.

97
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:39,534
I didn't like people dying.

98
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:44,162
I wanted to save people.

99
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:46,235
Save the homeless.

100
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,734
My favourite was James.

101
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:56,100
One Christmas,
I covered him in decorations

102
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:58,532
so he could feel
some Christmas cheer.

103
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:02,466
He loved his tea.

104
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,995
Huh?

105
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:07,668
Ah! Ah.

106
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:09,431
Ah...

107
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:14,103
Good on ya, little possum.
Good on ya.

108
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,969
He was once a magistrate,

109
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,734
but was defrocked
for masturbating in court.

110
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,533
Back then,

111
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:26,197
I thought masturbation meant
chewing your food thoroughly.

112
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,935
He once told me that

113
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:32,268
masturbation
was the thief of time.

114
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,103
- Ooh!
- Huh?

115
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:40,533
James gave me
my first real snail.

116
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:41,766
Ah!

117
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,664
Your mum, Sylvia.

118
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:48,097
He told me to put her
in a big jar

119
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:51,529
and feed her Vegemite.

120
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,166
While I was busy
trying to save the world,

121
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,502
Gilbert wanted to
break free from it.

122
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:00,031
Free others.

123
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:01,467
Huh?

124
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:05,299
Ugh!

125
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,235
Once, he let our neighbour's
cockatoo escape.

126
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,333
Fly, Mildred!
Come on, fly!

127
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:23,301
Bye, Mildred!

128
00:11:23,302 --> 00:11:26,532
Gilbert said Mildred
never seemed so happy.

129
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:33,602
If he wasn't
letting animals free,

130
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:35,499
he was rescuing them.

131
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:40,268
He didn't
care about the dangers.

132
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,763
I'll save it, Gracie!

133
00:11:49,638 --> 00:11:51,499
- Gilbert!
- Ah!

134
00:11:57,604 --> 00:11:59,428
Come on, fella!

135
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:01,995
Agh!

136
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,532
Over here, Gracie!

137
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,899
Gilbert loved animals
so much

138
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,598
he became a vegetarian.

139
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:31,367
Aww!
Now she's got a boyfriend.

140
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:38,532
Look, Gracie,
they're hugging.

141
00:12:40,768 --> 00:12:42,730
Ugh...

142
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:47,101
Eggs, wow!

143
00:12:47,102 --> 00:12:49,596
We'd created
our own little family.

144
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:52,631
They hatched, Gracie!
Babies!

145
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:58,133
You became
my favourite, Sylvia.

146
00:12:58,134 --> 00:13:02,233
Your swirl went opposite
to the others.

147
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:06,532
Gilbert named you after
Mum's favourite author.

148
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:14,097
But the thing that
made Gilbert really unique

149
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:17,697
was his love of fire.

150
00:13:19,935 --> 00:13:21,763
He wanted to eat it.

151
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:29,433
He'd spend hours
playing with fire.

152
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:58,301
I remember how he always
smelt like burnt matches.

153
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,836
At school, the girls swooned.

154
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:05,897
He was the flame,
they were the moths.

155
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:11,364
But he was more interested
in reading, and magic.

156
00:14:11,365 --> 00:14:14,365
I think he just wanted
to disappear.

157
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:18,334
And spend all his pocket money
at Bert's.

158
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:26,364
Bert was the type of person

159
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,795
parents told you to avoid,
Sylvia.

160
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:33,499
Someone who might offer you
boiled lollies.

161
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,466
Ooh.

162
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:39,499
Bert seemed
anything but magical.

163
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,198
Gilbert's dream was

164
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,199
to be a street performer
in Paris.

165
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,862
Look, Gracie!

166
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:08,664
He was always practising.

167
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:13,037
Oh, shit!

168
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:17,033
Ow, ow, ow!

169
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:19,400
And often burnt himself.

170
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:24,770
We got little scars
from the sparks.

171
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:27,262
And when we
put our arms together,

172
00:15:27,263 --> 00:15:30,362
they formed a face.

173
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,935
Oh, look, Gracie!

174
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:35,295
It felt great
when we did this.

175
00:15:35,296 --> 00:15:37,829
Our feelings aligned.

176
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,799
A lot of twins
say this, Sylvia,

177
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,097
and it's true.

178
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:46,197
I felt his emotions,

179
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:50,261
his happiness
and his sadness.

180
00:15:50,262 --> 00:15:51,561
Which seemed to be

181
00:15:51,562 --> 00:15:54,662
the fourth member
of our family.

182
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,627
Mum's death had left a hole.

183
00:15:57,628 --> 00:16:00,066
Dad had tried to fill the void,

184
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:03,466
but... he had his own problems.

185
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,661
Dad was French,

186
00:16:06,662 --> 00:16:11,536
and had once been
an animator in Paris.

187
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,328
He made stop-motion films

188
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:15,463
with an old Bolex camera.

189
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:20,697
He showed them to us
sometimes.

190
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,602
To pay for his art form,

191
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:32,568
he busked on the streets.

192
00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:37,562
Bonjour, messieurs dames,

193
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,470
Je suis
l'incroyable Percy Pudel.

194
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:40,695
Mum met him on a holiday

195
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:43,169
she'd won in
the Woman's Weekly magazine.

196
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,466
Hep-ah!

197
00:16:50,497 --> 00:16:52,536
Oh!

198
00:16:52,537 --> 00:16:54,631
Et voila, messieurs dames.

199
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:58,295
Ohh...

200
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:02,396
Wow!

201
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,430
Bonjour,
mademoiselle d'escargot.

202
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:13,402
Ooh! Ooh, la, la!

203
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:17,596
They fell in love,

204
00:17:17,597 --> 00:17:20,131
and he followed her
back to Australia.

205
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:28,037
Bonjour! Je suis
l'incroyable Percy Pudel.

206
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,565
Wanker!

207
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:33,735
Hey, w... Watch out!

208
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:35,764
Agh!

209
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,970
Mum had only just
got pregnant

210
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:49,729
when his career was cut short
by a drunk driver.

211
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,436
He never juggled again,
and became a paraplegic.

212
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:56,469
Then, slowly,

213
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,934
an alcoholic,

214
00:17:57,935 --> 00:18:00,895
just like the guy
who'd hit him.

215
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:04,768
Money had
always been a problem.

216
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:07,269
Much worse since his accident.

217
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:11,631
His pension barely paid
for his wheelchair batteries.

218
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:15,002
Winning Scratchies

219
00:18:15,003 --> 00:18:18,130
was the only thing
that brought him hope.

220
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,797
We found them everywhere.

221
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:24,329
To make matters worse,

222
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,763
he developed sleep apnoea.

223
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:33,334
Huh?

224
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,568
We'd have to clap
to wake him up.

225
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,595
Despite our hardships,

226
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:58,933
our little family unit
was strong.

227
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:01,700
And there was plenty of joy.

228
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:03,070
Ready!

229
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:14,433
Our happiest day was
when we went on the Big Dipper.

230
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:19,103
It was scary.

231
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:23,070
Scary because it was
100 years old.

232
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,767
Wah!

233
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:27,766
Dad felt alive,

234
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,496
escaped his body.

235
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:38,061
When he died,

236
00:19:38,062 --> 00:19:42,070
he said he wanted his ashes
sprinkled off the Big Dipper.

237
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:45,564
The day got even better
on the way home

238
00:19:45,565 --> 00:19:49,029
when Gilbert found a Scratchie
on the ground.

239
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,895
We won $20!

240
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,601
So Dad bought 20 more.

241
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,200
Too bad, Dad.

242
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:00,436
He hated we had to
look after him.

243
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:08,462
I suppose his cage
was his body.

244
00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:11,327
His glass wasn't full or empty.

245
00:20:11,328 --> 00:20:13,301
Just... a glass.

246
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,697
Knitting and black jelly beans
were his other addictions.

247
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:21,961
He was the one
who knitted my snail hat

248
00:20:21,962 --> 00:20:25,533
and made the eyeballs out of
his old juggling balls.

249
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:29,067
The jelly beans
made his tongue all black,

250
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:30,601
and his breath...

251
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:32,536
...aniseedy.

252
00:20:32,537 --> 00:20:33,661
Watch, Gracie.

253
00:20:33,662 --> 00:20:34,935
We arranged them
on his head

254
00:20:34,936 --> 00:20:37,263
while he pretended
to be asleep.

255
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:39,202
He let us do stuff like that.

256
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:47,130
We were free to
do what we wanted, Sylvia.

257
00:20:47,131 --> 00:20:48,633
Ah!

258
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:54,101
He said childhood
was life's best season.

259
00:20:54,102 --> 00:20:57,593
It never lasts,
but everyone deserves one.

260
00:20:57,594 --> 00:21:00,360
Oh, mon fils!

261
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:02,061
Bravo, Gilbert!

262
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:06,262
He was so proud Gilbert
wanted to be a performer,

263
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:08,229
follow in his footsteps.

264
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,469
Ah... Ohh!

265
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,466
Bravo!

266
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:16,460
That night, we got out
mum's jewellery box

267
00:21:16,461 --> 00:21:18,801
and sang our heads off.

268
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:20,834
# ...gentille alouette

269
00:21:20,835 --> 00:21:23,967
♪ Alouette, je te plumerai

270
00:21:23,968 --> 00:21:26,866
♪ Je te plumerai la tete... ♪

271
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:28,835
♪ Je te plumerai la tete

272
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:30,701
# Et la tete!
Et la tete!

273
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:32,733
♪ Alouette!
Alouette!

274
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:34,899
♪ O-o-o-oh... ♪

275
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:40,936
Hah. Good one, Dad.

276
00:21:40,937 --> 00:21:43,728
Later, dad got out
his old Bolex camera

277
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:46,862
and gave me some tips
on how to animate.

278
00:21:50,797 --> 00:21:54,335
I wanted to become an animator,
just like him.

279
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,869
To top the day off,
we had a competition

280
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,733
to see who could create
the best hairdo.

281
00:22:06,163 --> 00:22:07,466
I won.

282
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:13,261
I remember
the stillness that night...

283
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:17,569
...the wonderful memories
of that day,

284
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,466
fresh in our heads.

285
00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:24,862
A day so precious...

286
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,928
...but fleeting.

287
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:40,532
Huh?

288
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:55,928
Despite our clapping...

289
00:22:56,769 --> 00:22:58,634
...this time,

290
00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:00,868
Dad never woke.

291
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,398
We couldn't afford
a proper funeral,

292
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:17,761
so Dad was cremated
by the government,

293
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:22,167
his ashes given to us
in a cardboard box.

294
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:25,965
I sprinkled him
into his jellybean jar.

295
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:27,895
He would have liked that.

296
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:39,529
Child services came
to take us away.

297
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:42,862
Come on, you two.
Let's go.

298
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:45,965
And we were to be
sent to foster homes

299
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,103
in separate states.

300
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:52,232
We had no relatives,

301
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:54,900
and no-one wanted to
adopt twins,

302
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,928
especially weird ones like us.

303
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:08,534
Look after it, Gilbert.

304
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,133
Hurry up.
Say your goodbyes.

305
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:22,463
Bye, Gracie.

306
00:24:22,464 --> 00:24:26,037
Bye, Gilbert.

307
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:33,433
That was the last time
I saw my brother.

308
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:37,499
The last time I smelled
his scent of burnt matches.

309
00:24:43,304 --> 00:24:46,503
We never got to sprinkle Dad
off the Big Dipper.

310
00:24:54,938 --> 00:24:57,197
Our lives were
turned upside down

311
00:24:57,198 --> 00:25:00,364
and back to front, Sylvia.

312
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,599
We had no choice
but to move onwards.

313
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,336
Upwards.

314
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,697
Sidewards.

315
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,003
I was sent to live with
a childless couple in Canberra,

316
00:25:15,004 --> 00:25:18,565
which had won safest city
three years in a row.

317
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:23,070
Some people
even wore helmets driving.

318
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:33,070
Back then, Canberra wasn't
the exciting place it is today.

319
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:40,268
I suppose 'settled' is
the wrong word for how I felt.

320
00:25:41,136 --> 00:25:44,169
'Traumatised'
was more accurate.

321
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,268
The separation from Gilbert
made me anxious.

322
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:53,329
But you and your siblings,
Sylvia,

323
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,565
you brought me some comfort.

324
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,501
Lovely.

325
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:05,130
My new foster parents,
Ian and Narelle,

326
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:08,635
were... pleasant enough.

327
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:09,936
They were accountants

328
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:12,367
for a company that made
traffic lights.

329
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:15,132
They were well-meaning,

330
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:17,064
and addicted to
self-help books.

331
00:26:17,065 --> 00:26:19,702
Hm?

332
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,498
- Good morning!
- Hey!

333
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:25,601
They believed
a good dose of self-esteem

334
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:28,366
cured everything.

335
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:31,662
Every week, they'd make me
a new certificate.

336
00:26:31,663 --> 00:26:35,103
Our little baby.
Oh, we're so proud!

337
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:37,766
Now, watch this.

338
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:39,102
My finger work!

339
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:41,763
On the weekends,
they'd play netball.

340
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:45,398
Gracie, can you
get the ball for us?

341
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:47,631
They tried to get me
to play as well.

342
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:51,763
Here we go.

343
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:55,095
Catch it!

344
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:56,468
Oof!

345
00:26:56,469 --> 00:26:57,697
Oh, no!

346
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:01,200
Ian!
What's happened to her?

347
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:03,535
-You're right, babe.
-Babe?

348
00:27:03,536 --> 00:27:05,233
She's going blue!

349
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:06,563
Sometimes I faked
asthma attacks.

350
00:27:06,564 --> 00:27:09,164
Hey, Narelle,
better get the puffer!

351
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:10,836
I felt bad telling lies,

352
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,428
but sport was
one of my allergies.

353
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:15,197
You alright, babe?

354
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:17,466
Breathe, pumpkin, breathe!

355
00:27:25,202 --> 00:27:28,730
Their favourite colour
was beige.

356
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,232
They even had guinea pigs
that were beige.

357
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:37,334
OK,
we're off now, pumpkin.

358
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:40,235
- See you later.
- Bye.

359
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,932
On Saturdays,
they went to key parties.

360
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:45,133
Ready, love?

361
00:27:45,134 --> 00:27:47,202
I'm looking forward
to tonight, babe.

362
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,397
They were swingers,
Sylvia.

363
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:53,602
Darryl!

364
00:27:59,536 --> 00:28:00,662
Back then,

365
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:03,895
I thought swinging
meant something else.

366
00:28:06,532 --> 00:28:09,198
My new school
was predictably bad.

367
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,767
-Grace Pudel!
- Huh?

368
00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:12,598
Stop daydreaming.

369
00:28:16,135 --> 00:28:18,235
I tried to make friends.

370
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:23,666
But Gilbert wasn't there
to break their fingers.

371
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,668
So... Hmm...

372
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:27,662
I absorbed the abuse,

373
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:32,296
came home, and played with
my clay friends.

374
00:28:32,297 --> 00:28:35,131
I missed Gilbert like crazy.

375
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:36,663
We wrote each other letters,

376
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:40,433
and I saved every cent I could
to go see him.

377
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,062
He'd been sent to live with
a family of fruit farmers

378
00:28:45,063 --> 00:28:46,730
near Perth.

379
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:50,931
I definitely got
the better family, Sylvia.

380
00:28:50,932 --> 00:28:53,796
He HATED his.

381
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,728
Dear Gracie,

382
00:28:56,729 --> 00:29:00,297
my new parents, Ruth and Owen,
are strange,

383
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:02,698
and do a weird sort of praying.

384
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:14,094
They make me pray
four times a day.

385
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:17,235
They said the more I pray,

386
00:29:17,236 --> 00:29:19,928
the more the pain of
Dad's death will disappear.

387
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:25,761
They're really old-fashioned,
and don't even have a phone.

388
00:29:25,762 --> 00:29:29,662
We all have to have magnets
taped to us.

389
00:29:29,663 --> 00:29:32,494
They reckon it keeps
our auras balanced,

390
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:34,763
protects us from the devil.

391
00:29:36,499 --> 00:29:40,235
Ruth is obsessed
with her poor budgies.

392
00:29:41,402 --> 00:29:44,697
I reckon she loves them
more than her own kids.

393
00:29:48,262 --> 00:29:50,037
Worship thy apple!

394
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,565
They've built
their own church and school.

395
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,129
Owen is the minister.

396
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,097
Cleanse thy soul!

397
00:30:04,731 --> 00:30:09,466
Cast out thy demons,
and worship thy fruit!

398
00:30:13,163 --> 00:30:14,829
Hm?

399
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:19,999
He's got
stomach ulcers,

400
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,037
which he blames on the devil.

401
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:33,400
My new brothers
are all morons.

402
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:37,961
One of them is always staring.

403
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:45,499
Worship the baby Jesus!

404
00:30:48,568 --> 00:30:52,166
I have to work in
the orchard after school.

405
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:55,433
The brothers
get the better jobs.

406
00:30:57,435 --> 00:31:00,532
Ruth said if I'm going to be
a good orchardman,

407
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:04,433
I'd have to start at the bottom
and work my way up.

408
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:08,433
I'd rather eat glass.

409
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:11,796
Hmph!

410
00:31:12,734 --> 00:31:13,794
Ugh!

411
00:31:13,795 --> 00:31:16,165
Anyway,
they can all get stuffed,

412
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,162
'cause as soon as
I'm old enough,

413
00:31:18,163 --> 00:31:19,427
and got money,

414
00:31:19,428 --> 00:31:21,332
I'm coming to get you.

415
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:24,697
I'll walk across
that big, burning desert.

416
00:31:25,902 --> 00:31:27,361
We'll escape to Paris.

417
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:29,331
I'll become a fire eater.

418
00:31:31,004 --> 00:31:33,895
And you'll become
an amazing animator!

419
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:44,733
It'll be great.

420
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:01,736
Gilbert's letters
gave me hope,

421
00:32:01,737 --> 00:32:04,497
so I tried to get on with life,

422
00:32:04,498 --> 00:32:07,932
squashing my sorrows
down into my shoes

423
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:10,436
as the years dragged on.

424
00:32:10,437 --> 00:32:11,728
To pass time,

425
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,765
I began volunteering
at the local library.

426
00:32:16,171 --> 00:32:20,733
One of my jobs was to erase
rude drawings done by boys.

427
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:22,461
Ugh...

428
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:25,195
That's when I first met Pinky.

429
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:31,265
I saw her returning books
into a rubbish bin.

430
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:33,694
She thought it was
the return chute.

431
00:32:33,695 --> 00:32:36,532
And had been doing it
for months.

432
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:39,665
- Excuse me?
- Hm?

433
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,695
Um...

434
00:32:40,696 --> 00:32:43,731
She was mortified
when I explained.

435
00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:45,099
Ah, poo.

436
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,569
Don't worry,
I won't turn you in.

437
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,866
Oh, thank you, dear.

438
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:52,228
Bless your cotton socks.

439
00:32:52,229 --> 00:32:53,963
What's your name?

440
00:32:53,964 --> 00:32:55,963
Grace Pudel.

441
00:32:55,964 --> 00:32:58,402
Uh, I'm Pinky.

442
00:32:58,403 --> 00:32:59,897
Just Pinky.

443
00:32:59,898 --> 00:33:01,732
Like Cher.

444
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:04,194
Or Liberace.

445
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:06,160
Or Prince.

446
00:33:06,161 --> 00:33:08,764
Casanova!

447
00:33:08,765 --> 00:33:10,433
Popeye.

448
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,561
People call me Pinky
'cause of this.

449
00:33:13,562 --> 00:33:16,428
Lost it dancing
in Barcelona.

450
00:33:22,098 --> 00:33:23,796
Agh!

451
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:30,160
Why are you dressed
like an ant?

452
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:32,162
Oh, um...

453
00:33:33,503 --> 00:33:35,336
No, I'm a snail.

454
00:33:35,337 --> 00:33:37,302
Oh!

455
00:33:37,303 --> 00:33:39,198
Funny.

456
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:41,401
I used to think I was a pigeon.

457
00:33:43,661 --> 00:33:45,861
She was
a true eccentric,

458
00:33:45,862 --> 00:33:49,730
and smelt like ginger
and second-hand shops.

459
00:33:53,062 --> 00:33:54,598
Dickhead!

460
00:33:55,698 --> 00:33:57,794
She clothed herself
in corduroy,

461
00:33:57,795 --> 00:34:01,365
And her face had more wrinkles
than her jacket.

462
00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:03,195
It was hard to know
where the fabric ended

463
00:34:03,196 --> 00:34:05,229
and her skin began.

464
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,164
Apart from you, Sylvia,

465
00:34:07,165 --> 00:34:09,533
she was my first real friend.

466
00:34:10,702 --> 00:34:13,029
My only real friend.

467
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:17,498
She'd lived an amazing life.

468
00:34:17,499 --> 00:34:20,202
I thought one day I might
make a film about her.

469
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,268
She'd seen the Northern Lights.

470
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,402
Floated in the Dead Sea.

471
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:33,929
Been an exotic dancer
in a schnitzel bar.

472
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,301
Ha!

473
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,004
Won a bee-beard contest.

474
00:34:43,704 --> 00:34:45,803
Hee! My turn.

475
00:34:45,804 --> 00:34:48,565
Bathed with
a snow monkey.

476
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,862
Made love to John Denver...

477
00:34:53,868 --> 00:34:55,034
In a helicopter.

478
00:34:55,035 --> 00:34:58,235
Take me home,
country road!

479
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,664
And once...

480
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,629
...played ping pong
with Fidel Castro.

481
00:35:10,332 --> 00:35:11,530
She'd never been sick.

482
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:14,363
Her secret to longevity
were coffee enemas

483
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:16,869
and a daily shot
of ginger wine.

484
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:22,063
She'd outlived
two husbands.

485
00:35:22,064 --> 00:35:23,729
The first, Hector,

486
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,602
had died just a week
after they got married.

487
00:35:26,603 --> 00:35:28,428
Careful, sweetie.

488
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:29,703
Agh!

489
00:35:31,536 --> 00:35:33,070
Bugger.

490
00:35:37,897 --> 00:35:41,829
Her second husband, Bill,
had been a postman.

491
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:45,667
Who wrote love notes
on her mail.

492
00:35:47,428 --> 00:35:48,997
Roses are red,

493
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:50,767
Violets are camp,

494
00:35:50,768 --> 00:35:52,370
I'll be your letter,

495
00:35:52,371 --> 00:35:54,635
You be my stamp.

496
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:56,361
You are the clouds,

497
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,701
And I am the skies,

498
00:35:58,702 --> 00:36:01,262
Let me shipwreck meself

499
00:36:01,263 --> 00:36:03,061
Between your thighs.

500
00:36:03,062 --> 00:36:04,502
Smile.

501
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,697
Ready for my close-up,
Mr DeMille.

502
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:15,828
They'd just begun
a trek across Australia...

503
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:17,999
Just a little
to your left, sweetheart.

504
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,627
...when nature struck.

505
00:36:19,628 --> 00:36:22,197
Oh! Oh! Oh!

506
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:25,028
No!

507
00:36:27,096 --> 00:36:28,733
Bugger.

508
00:36:37,397 --> 00:36:39,396
Careful, kiddies.

509
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,635
She was a real survivor,

510
00:36:41,636 --> 00:36:43,796
and had so many jobs.

511
00:36:44,932 --> 00:36:46,301
Dickhead!

512
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:48,133
Dickhead!

513
00:36:48,134 --> 00:36:50,297
But they never
lasted long.

514
00:36:50,298 --> 00:36:52,701
You're fired.

515
00:36:52,702 --> 00:36:54,762
On her 80th birthday,

516
00:36:54,763 --> 00:36:58,961
she'd got a job
promoting pineapple chunks.

517
00:36:59,998 --> 00:37:01,596
Oh! Oh!

518
00:37:01,597 --> 00:37:04,763
Gosh, she had
a great sense of humour.

519
00:37:06,731 --> 00:37:09,127
She drove her dead husband's
postal truck

520
00:37:09,128 --> 00:37:12,068
and once told me she wanted to
die peacefully in her sleep

521
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:14,827
like her cousin
who was a bus driver.

522
00:37:14,828 --> 00:37:18,935
Not screaming in horror
like his passengers.

523
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,834
I'm not sure
whether she was joking.

524
00:37:20,835 --> 00:37:23,004
It was hard to know with her.

525
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:28,037
Her house was fabulous.

526
00:37:30,806 --> 00:37:32,734
It smelt like popcorn
and mothballs.

527
00:37:38,566 --> 00:37:41,433
She had an enormous
trophy collection,

528
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:44,727
which I soon discovered
were other people's trophies

529
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:46,928
she'd found
at second-hand stores.

530
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:54,900
There were Post-it notes
everywhere.

531
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:57,268
She had a dreadful memory.

532
00:37:59,805 --> 00:38:01,395
She was terrified
of Alzheimer's

533
00:38:01,396 --> 00:38:03,694
and had taken up tap dancing.

534
00:38:03,695 --> 00:38:05,895
She'd read it
staved off dementia.

535
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,265
She didn't believe in banks,

536
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:13,795
and put her savings
in an old tin.

537
00:38:13,796 --> 00:38:17,427
She said she kept her secrets
in there as well.

538
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,661
You know, Gracie,

539
00:38:18,662 --> 00:38:22,136
biscuit tins
rarely contain biscuits.

540
00:38:23,665 --> 00:38:25,827
I'd never seen
her mysterious tin.

541
00:38:25,828 --> 00:38:28,660
She was always hiding it
in different places,

542
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:31,796
and often
couldn't remember where.

543
00:38:33,037 --> 00:38:36,365
Her home was also
full of seedlings,

544
00:38:36,366 --> 00:38:41,902
which she later confessed
were marijuana.

545
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:45,360
She loved to bake
ginger hash-people,

546
00:38:45,361 --> 00:38:47,461
because, she said,

547
00:38:47,462 --> 00:38:49,895
they relieved her arthritis.

548
00:38:50,606 --> 00:38:52,728
She also enjoyed gardening,

549
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:55,461
especially when
she felt a bit miserable.

550
00:38:55,462 --> 00:38:57,795
She called it her Pity-Pit.

551
00:38:57,796 --> 00:39:02,361
She wanted her ashes
sprinkled in her Pity-Pit,

552
00:39:02,362 --> 00:39:04,503
be returned to nature,

553
00:39:04,504 --> 00:39:07,037
fertilise her veggies.

554
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:11,202
Gardening fixes everything.

555
00:39:17,872 --> 00:39:19,702
She also
enjoyed mini-golf,

556
00:39:19,703 --> 00:39:22,301
and had built her own course.

557
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:37,334
Ha-ha! Hole in one!

558
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:40,527
But the thing that
made Pinky truly remarkable

559
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:42,361
was what she did every Monday.

560
00:39:42,362 --> 00:39:43,631
There, there.

561
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:47,903
She'd visit the lonely,
and hold their hands.

562
00:39:47,904 --> 00:39:50,832
She said the thing
the elderly craved most

563
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:52,695
was human touch.

564
00:39:52,696 --> 00:39:56,068
She'd sit with them calmly,
in silence.

565
00:39:56,069 --> 00:40:00,103
Something so simple,
yet so comforting.

566
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:02,566
- Hm?
- Ah!

567
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:06,136
An occasional ginger
hash-person helped as well.

568
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,169
Pinky told me she'd never got
to hold her own parents' hands.

569
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:17,966
She never said why.

570
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:22,195
Her childhood was off-limits.

571
00:40:22,196 --> 00:40:24,334
Woo-hoo!

572
00:40:25,196 --> 00:40:26,464
You know,

573
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,735
life isn't about
looking backwards, Gracie.

574
00:40:29,736 --> 00:40:33,235
It's about living forwards.

575
00:40:33,236 --> 00:40:36,968
She was the jewel
in the Canberra junk heap.

576
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:39,800
She'd crammed so much
into her life,

577
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:42,394
and I'd crammed nothing.

578
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:47,800
Pinky's friendship
helped ease my sadness,

579
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:50,166
my feelings of loss.

580
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:54,470
I suppose SHE was
the medicine I needed,

581
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:57,194
a vitamin for hope.

582
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,735
Bugger.

583
00:41:00,736 --> 00:41:03,235
Better luck next time, Gracie.

584
00:41:05,939 --> 00:41:09,136
The years
fluttered past, Sylvia.

585
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:14,134
Apart from Pinky,

586
00:41:14,135 --> 00:41:16,064
letters from Gilbert
were the only things

587
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:18,433
that confirmed I existed.

588
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:32,565
I missed Gilbert like crazy.

589
00:41:58,169 --> 00:42:00,163
Ian and Narelle
were still obsessed

590
00:42:00,164 --> 00:42:01,836
about my mental health,

591
00:42:01,837 --> 00:42:03,596
and sent me
to self-help classes.

592
00:42:03,597 --> 00:42:06,398
Which was supposed to
raise my endorphins,

593
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:10,469
balance my chakra,
and cleanse my third eye.

594
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,732
Ready, set, go!

595
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:27,368
Ha! Ha! Ha!

596
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:29,470
Ha! Ha!

597
00:42:29,471 --> 00:42:30,700
- Ooh.
-Ha!

598
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:33,232
- Ha!
- Hm.

599
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:35,665
Ah! Oh, Craig!

600
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:39,636
- Mm! Heal me! Heal me!
-I'll heal you, Vicky.

601
00:42:39,637 --> 00:42:41,599
- I'll heal you.
- Oh, Craig!

602
00:42:42,904 --> 00:42:46,500
-  Oh, Craig!
-Oh, Vic.

603
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,103
Part of me died
in those classes, Sylvia.

604
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:09,669
Self-help was just
a shallow, quick fix.

605
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,235
None of it actually worked.

606
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:16,202
I just wanted the earth to stop
so I could get off.

607
00:43:17,905 --> 00:43:21,433
Puberty arrived,
and brought its gifts.

608
00:43:22,365 --> 00:43:24,796
I'd have loved a boyfriend.

609
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:33,199
It didn't help matters

610
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,631
when Pinky convinced me
to get a perm.

611
00:44:03,968 --> 00:44:05,533
Nice hairdo.

612
00:44:07,029 --> 00:44:08,664
Ha-ha!

613
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:16,334
Dickhead!

614
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:18,897
There, there, love.

615
00:44:18,898 --> 00:44:20,734
Ignore him.

616
00:44:20,735 --> 00:44:22,801
I think we look fabulous.

617
00:44:22,802 --> 00:44:24,869
Thank God for Pinky.

618
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,429
She became
my real foster parent.

619
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,329
Especially as
Ian and Narelle

620
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,462
weren't around much anymore.

621
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:33,496
They'd discovered nude cruises,

622
00:44:33,497 --> 00:44:35,329
and were gone for weeks
at a time.

623
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:37,665
- Whee!
- Good morning.

624
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:39,664
Oh, hi!

625
00:44:46,336 --> 00:44:49,368
I still grieved
the loss of my family,

626
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:55,202
and continued filling the void
with more and more snails.

627
00:44:57,771 --> 00:44:59,865
If I saw something snail-y,

628
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:02,935
it HAD to be mine.

629
00:45:02,936 --> 00:45:06,364
My obsession
had blossomed, Sylvia.

630
00:45:06,365 --> 00:45:10,263
My room had become
a snail... shrine.

631
00:45:10,264 --> 00:45:14,202
I'd become a snail hoarder.

632
00:45:19,837 --> 00:45:22,895
Oh, I missed Gilbert so much.

633
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:26,866
His letters still gave me hope,

634
00:45:26,867 --> 00:45:29,727
but he began to worry me.

635
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:31,895
I felt he wasn't
telling me everything.

636
00:45:32,902 --> 00:45:34,533
Dear Gracie,

637
00:45:34,534 --> 00:45:38,462
life at the Garden of Eden is
certainly no Garden of Eden.

638
00:45:38,463 --> 00:45:41,431
Gilbert!
Get back to work!

639
00:45:41,432 --> 00:45:44,800
Ruth seems to
have it in for me,

640
00:45:44,801 --> 00:45:46,701
but I don't give a stuff.

641
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,095
- Sorry, Ruth.
- Ugh!

642
00:45:49,096 --> 00:45:54,367
Oh, and she hates that
I call her Ruth instead of Mum.

643
00:45:54,368 --> 00:45:57,466
And she hates that I won't
let Owen shave my head.

644
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:01,764
They make me work really hard
for lousy money.

645
00:46:04,135 --> 00:46:05,961
There's no-one here to talk to.

646
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,532
I try to be friendly,

647
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:12,832
but their weirdo religion
has them all brainwashed.

648
00:46:14,267 --> 00:46:16,829
The brothers
really hate me.

649
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,533
Poofter.

650
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:35,461
Owen forces me
to read the Bible,

651
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:37,394
and Ruth...

652
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:39,064
...forces me to eat meat.

653
00:46:39,065 --> 00:46:40,929
Hello, piggies.

654
00:46:47,231 --> 00:46:48,564
Eat it!

655
00:46:48,565 --> 00:46:51,301
She's barred me
from playing with fire.

656
00:46:51,302 --> 00:46:56,099
She's bonkers, and thinks
magic is the devil's vice.

657
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,498
And she's always
trying to stick

658
00:46:57,499 --> 00:47:01,261
more and more magnets
on me to fix my aura.

659
00:47:01,262 --> 00:47:03,070
But I don't care.

660
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,866
I hide behind the church
to practice my stuff,

661
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,899
with one of the brothers,

662
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,466
who... seems to like me.

663
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:17,631
Ruth reckons Lucifer's
trying to invade my soul.

664
00:47:19,365 --> 00:47:21,427
So they tried to baptise me,

665
00:47:21,428 --> 00:47:23,466
to get the devil out!

666
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:38,998
Dunk thee,

667
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:42,094
and cleanse thy demons!

668
00:47:42,095 --> 00:47:43,598
Ugh!

669
00:47:44,598 --> 00:47:47,103
I pretended
I was possessed.

670
00:47:47,104 --> 00:47:50,094
I hid some of Owen's
antacid tablets in my pockets.

671
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:53,166
-  Oh, my!
- Ooh...

672
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:55,061
It was hilarious.

673
00:47:57,867 --> 00:47:59,500
Ben loved it.

674
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:09,098
Ruth is always
trying to control me.

675
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:11,436
She even tried drugging me.

676
00:48:17,066 --> 00:48:18,730
Eat it.

677
00:48:20,668 --> 00:48:21,961
Hmm.

678
00:48:35,065 --> 00:48:36,796
But I'm not dumb.

679
00:48:38,561 --> 00:48:41,433
I hid the pills in my cheeks.

680
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:46,727
Ruth says,
Jesus's love isn't free.

681
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:49,536
So, what money
we do earn, Gracie,

682
00:48:49,537 --> 00:48:51,361
goes back to Jesus.

683
00:48:51,362 --> 00:48:55,763
Pennies for Jesus.

684
00:49:01,235 --> 00:49:05,162
Pennies for Jesus.
Pennies for Jesus.

685
00:49:05,163 --> 00:49:07,235
That's a good boy.

686
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,830
Huh?

687
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:19,895
Gilbert!

688
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,631
And Jesus then
gives his money back to Owen.

689
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:29,965
Thank you, Jesus.

690
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:31,829
And his vices.

691
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:38,160
Oh, Owen, how are you?
The usual?

692
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:45,961
Have a good night.

693
00:49:50,072 --> 00:49:53,568
Pennies for Jesus,
and whiskey for Owen.

694
00:49:53,569 --> 00:49:55,701
Hm!

695
00:50:04,437 --> 00:50:06,297
Ah!

696
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:08,436
They're such hypocrites!

697
00:50:09,604 --> 00:50:11,296
But I made them pay for it.

698
00:50:11,297 --> 00:50:14,427
Run free, guys. Come on! Run!

699
00:50:21,406 --> 00:50:23,534
I hate it here.

700
00:50:23,535 --> 00:50:25,361
No!

701
00:50:25,362 --> 00:50:27,698
- My budgies!
- Heh.

702
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,598
And I hate her.

703
00:50:31,868 --> 00:50:33,896
She punished me.

704
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:35,565
Big time.

705
00:50:43,463 --> 00:50:45,631
Hold him tight.

706
00:50:47,772 --> 00:50:51,430
Sinners must be punished,
Gilbert.

707
00:50:51,431 --> 00:50:54,360
Leviticus 24 -
an eye for an eye,

708
00:50:54,361 --> 00:50:56,536
a tooth for a tooth.

709
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:02,763
Burn thy
wicked box of pleasures!

710
00:51:02,764 --> 00:51:06,863
She punished
me, but it didn't bother me.

711
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:08,268
I'm fine.

712
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,796
Anyway, I'd better go.

713
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:16,564
I'm saving my money,
and I'll be escaping soon

714
00:51:16,565 --> 00:51:19,268
and crossing that desert
to come and get to you.

715
00:51:32,572 --> 00:51:34,565
Hang in there, Gracie.

716
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:37,730
Everything is OK.

717
00:51:39,538 --> 00:51:41,336
See you soon.

718
00:51:41,337 --> 00:51:42,865
Hopefully.

719
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:45,730
Love, Gilbert.

720
00:51:55,906 --> 00:51:59,235
Puberty finally finished
its cruelty, Sylvia.

721
00:52:00,299 --> 00:52:03,070
The season of our teens ended.

722
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:05,562
Oh, bubbles!

723
00:52:05,563 --> 00:52:07,500
But life got even lonelier

724
00:52:07,501 --> 00:52:11,697
when Ian and Narelle retired
to a nudist colony in Sweden.

725
00:52:12,972 --> 00:52:15,364
It's a shame
we never really connected.

726
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:18,063
What family
we did have, though,

727
00:52:18,064 --> 00:52:20,296
was now gone.

728
00:52:20,297 --> 00:52:22,136
Is that your foot?

729
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:28,097
Despite my woes, Sylvia,

730
00:52:28,098 --> 00:52:30,129
I tried to be optimistic,

731
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,037
be more social.

732
00:52:34,632 --> 00:52:37,360
I remember how there
were intriguing people

733
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:39,037
at the library.

734
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:43,697
But they lived vicariously.

735
00:52:45,532 --> 00:52:48,928
A boyfriend
seemed a work of fiction.

736
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:54,763
I felt invisible,
began to fade.

737
00:53:01,466 --> 00:53:04,733
Pinky was the only colour
in my life,

738
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:06,336
still effervescent.

739
00:53:07,428 --> 00:53:08,737
Her hand-holding idea

740
00:53:08,738 --> 00:53:11,035
had become
a fully-fledged charity.

741
00:53:11,036 --> 00:53:13,161
She'd even engaged
the long-term unemployed

742
00:53:13,162 --> 00:53:14,730
to help out.

743
00:53:16,398 --> 00:53:19,370
We went from home to home...

744
00:53:19,371 --> 00:53:21,103
...hand to hand.

745
00:53:30,731 --> 00:53:33,328
I think, over time,
the loss of my family

746
00:53:33,329 --> 00:53:36,334
had somehow... frozen me.

747
00:53:40,697 --> 00:53:42,833
I thought it was safer
to just...

748
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:45,367
live in a pretend world.

749
00:53:46,532 --> 00:53:48,527
Oh, Dad would have been
disappointed

750
00:53:48,528 --> 00:53:51,037
I'd resorted to trashy novels.

751
00:53:51,939 --> 00:53:55,527
It was now just me,
some sexy pirates,

752
00:53:55,528 --> 00:53:57,800
and a few frisky guinea pigs

753
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,431
who mocked my virginity.

754
00:54:00,432 --> 00:54:03,834
The stereotype
was now complete, Sylvia.

755
00:54:03,835 --> 00:54:06,332
I'd become an unloved recluse.

756
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:09,394
And the guinea pig hair
that coated me,

757
00:54:09,395 --> 00:54:11,499
a lonely person's glitter.

758
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:19,367
As my boredom worsened...

759
00:54:20,697 --> 00:54:24,129
...I found myself
having new urges.

760
00:54:26,267 --> 00:54:29,928
I added kleptomania
to my list of hobbies.

761
00:54:31,169 --> 00:54:35,134
Buying, hoarding,
and now stealing

762
00:54:35,135 --> 00:54:38,427
became a cheap thrill
and distraction

763
00:54:38,428 --> 00:54:40,697
from my mundane world...

764
00:54:42,037 --> 00:54:45,701
...which slowly
began to collapse.

765
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,862
I lost three guinea pigs
that night.

766
00:54:56,697 --> 00:54:59,070
I cremated them
in the backyard...

767
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,400
...and put their ashes
in little jars.

768
00:55:02,401 --> 00:55:06,004
It looked like I was starting
a guinea pig spice rack.

769
00:55:10,169 --> 00:55:13,727
My life had become
truly pathetic.

770
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:16,796
And things had gotten
out of control.

771
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:21,035
I held my own hand patiently,

772
00:55:21,036 --> 00:55:24,164
waiting for Gilbert to
come and rescue me,

773
00:55:24,165 --> 00:55:26,365
while I continued to withdraw

774
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:29,928
into the safety of
my snail fortress...

775
00:55:30,636 --> 00:55:32,302
...lonely,

776
00:55:32,303 --> 00:55:33,733
loveless,

777
00:55:33,734 --> 00:55:35,961
and imprisoned.

778
00:55:45,368 --> 00:55:48,469
But just as I was considering
joining a nunnery...

779
00:55:49,802 --> 00:55:51,496
...from the mess of my life

780
00:55:51,497 --> 00:55:54,334
came one of those
silver linings.

781
00:56:01,802 --> 00:56:03,895
His name was Ken.

782
00:56:06,467 --> 00:56:10,336
And he was obsessed
with his leaf blower.

783
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:14,869
There he stood,

784
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:18,169
more delicious
than a Chicko Roll.

785
00:56:24,196 --> 00:56:26,004
Well, hi.

786
00:56:28,067 --> 00:56:30,895
Could I, uh, maybe, uh...

787
00:56:30,896 --> 00:56:34,067
He wanted to know
if he could blow my leaves.

788
00:56:34,068 --> 00:56:36,634
His presence gave me
hot flushes

789
00:56:36,635 --> 00:56:38,768
and sweaty knickers.

790
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:41,635
It was love at first sight.

791
00:56:41,636 --> 00:56:45,260
He was a Canberra Adonis.

792
00:56:45,261 --> 00:56:47,136
A Cadonis.

793
00:56:52,837 --> 00:56:55,331
He was
a microwave oven repairman

794
00:56:55,332 --> 00:56:57,865
and told me that
he was extremely shallow

795
00:56:57,866 --> 00:57:00,028
and one-dimensional.

796
00:57:00,029 --> 00:57:03,801
He said if he was an onion
and you peeled back the layers,

797
00:57:03,802 --> 00:57:06,136
you'd just find more onion.

798
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:08,803
He had hobbies like me,

799
00:57:08,804 --> 00:57:12,761
and enjoyed
repairing broken bowls.

800
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,598
It was a Japanese art form
called kintsugi,

801
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:20,131
based on the philosophy that,
just like the soul,

802
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:22,494
all things can be repaired,

803
00:57:22,495 --> 00:57:25,235
and our cracks celebrated.

804
00:57:26,169 --> 00:57:27,836
Ken said that
I was a broken bowl

805
00:57:27,837 --> 00:57:30,327
and that he'd help repair
my wounds,

806
00:57:30,328 --> 00:57:32,565
fill up my cracks.

807
00:57:34,906 --> 00:57:38,399
He was so thoughtful
and community-minded

808
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,600
he volunteered as
a lifeguard at the local pool.

809
00:57:41,601 --> 00:57:43,401
Mmm...

810
00:57:43,402 --> 00:57:45,136
Hello.

811
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,598
He adored me,

812
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:52,499
and even built a milkshake
station in my kitchen.

813
00:58:05,235 --> 00:58:07,701
We dated for a month,
and then...

814
00:58:07,702 --> 00:58:08,932
What do you reckon?

815
00:58:15,503 --> 00:58:17,103
Ooh!

816
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:23,103
He said
he really did love me.

817
00:58:23,802 --> 00:58:25,665
Loved my quirks.

818
00:58:27,334 --> 00:58:30,332
We celebrated
with another milkshake.

819
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:32,463
He said he'd make me
something special.

820
00:58:32,464 --> 00:58:36,162
Spoonful of that.
Hmm, cinnamon!

821
00:58:36,163 --> 00:58:37,896
- No!
- What?

822
00:58:37,897 --> 00:58:39,235
Oh! I...

823
00:58:40,399 --> 00:58:43,434
- That's my guinea pig.
- Oh!

824
00:58:43,435 --> 00:58:45,397
A normal person would
have thought I was bonkers,

825
00:58:45,398 --> 00:58:47,062
keeping those
guinea pigs' ashes.

826
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:50,268
But he didn't.

827
00:58:51,803 --> 00:58:54,230
He loved all of me,

828
00:58:54,231 --> 00:58:57,103
even my bum and wobbly bits.

829
00:59:01,365 --> 00:59:04,500
Yeah. Nice. Oh, yeah!

830
00:59:04,501 --> 00:59:05,896
Oh!

831
00:59:05,897 --> 00:59:07,403
Yeah!

832
00:59:07,404 --> 00:59:08,568
Nice, Gracie.

833
00:59:08,569 --> 00:59:09,529
He moved in,

834
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:12,169
and I finally lost
my virginity.

835
00:59:13,905 --> 00:59:16,367
We were desperate
to get pregnant.

836
00:59:17,102 --> 00:59:20,069
But Ken was told
he was sterile,

837
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,932
from all those microwave ovens
he'd repaired.

838
00:59:22,933 --> 00:59:24,966
Rotten luck.

839
00:59:24,967 --> 00:59:27,267
But I wasn't too disappointed.

840
00:59:27,268 --> 00:59:30,634
I had more than I could ever
wish for, Sylvia.

841
00:59:30,635 --> 00:59:32,163
I had a Cadonis,

842
00:59:32,164 --> 00:59:34,262
a herd of guinea pigs,

843
00:59:34,263 --> 00:59:36,833
and a horde of snails.

844
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:38,598
Say cheese, Gracie!

845
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:41,835
We set a wedding date,

846
00:59:41,836 --> 00:59:43,863
and sent Gilbert the good news.

847
00:59:43,864 --> 00:59:45,367
Huh?

848
00:59:46,065 --> 00:59:48,064
Oh... Wow!

849
00:59:48,065 --> 00:59:50,565
Hey, Ben, guess what?

850
00:59:54,502 --> 00:59:58,101
Ken gave him money
for an airfare to Canberra.

851
00:59:58,102 --> 01:00:01,231
I asked Gilbert to walk me
down the aisle.

852
01:00:01,232 --> 01:00:04,763
Pinky would be the flower girl.

853
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:09,999
We'd finally be a family again.

854
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,532
Finally sprinkle Dad's ashes.

855
01:00:14,705 --> 01:00:17,001
My glass was now brimming,

856
01:00:17,002 --> 01:00:19,598
and there were
silver linings galore.

857
01:00:20,837 --> 01:00:23,031
Gilbert would live with us.

858
01:00:23,032 --> 01:00:25,565
He'd be here tomorrow!

859
01:00:30,235 --> 01:00:35,664
I'd never felt so happy,
so optimistic.

860
01:01:02,901 --> 01:01:04,601
Delivery.

861
01:01:04,602 --> 01:01:06,433
I'll get it.

862
01:01:16,471 --> 01:01:18,295
Ooh!

863
01:01:18,296 --> 01:01:21,334
Oh, for you, dear.

864
01:01:25,033 --> 01:01:26,634
Dear Grace,

865
01:01:26,635 --> 01:01:28,361
this is Ruth,

866
01:01:28,362 --> 01:01:30,361
Gilbert's foster mother.

867
01:01:30,362 --> 01:01:32,200
It saddens me to tell you

868
01:01:32,201 --> 01:01:35,127
that Gilbert has died
in an horrific fire.

869
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:39,100
Our church burnt down,

870
01:01:39,101 --> 01:01:43,202
and he was unable
to escape the flames.

871
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:51,095
Last week, I found Gilbert
and my son Ben...

872
01:01:51,096 --> 01:01:53,136
fornicating.

873
01:01:58,767 --> 01:02:00,236
Lucifer!

874
01:02:00,237 --> 01:02:02,499
I'm sure you will agree
our only course of action

875
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:06,998
was to purge and correct
their homosexual sickness

876
01:02:06,999 --> 01:02:08,428
in the correct fashion,

877
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:11,261
as instructed by... the Lord...

878
01:02:11,262 --> 01:02:13,301
...our saviour.

879
01:02:14,068 --> 01:02:16,595
This was not a simple task.

880
01:02:16,596 --> 01:02:20,398
We could not just
pray the gay away.

881
01:02:20,399 --> 01:02:23,965
So the only solution
was a dual expulsion

882
01:02:23,966 --> 01:02:26,463
to cast the demons out,

883
01:02:26,464 --> 01:02:28,833
eject the devil
from their souls,

884
01:02:28,834 --> 01:02:31,295
and correct their auras.

885
01:02:31,296 --> 01:02:34,195
Out, out, evilness!

886
01:02:34,196 --> 01:02:36,194
Out, out, Satan!

887
01:02:36,195 --> 01:02:38,862
Saaa!

888
01:02:40,704 --> 01:02:43,931
The time has come!

889
01:02:43,932 --> 01:02:46,766
Purge their souls!

890
01:02:48,702 --> 01:02:50,895
Cleanse their sickness.

891
01:02:53,768 --> 01:02:56,268
Gay, away!

892
01:02:56,934 --> 01:02:59,327
Out, gayness!

893
01:02:59,328 --> 01:03:01,503
Purge their souls!

894
01:03:01,504 --> 01:03:04,301
Out, out, Lucifer!

895
01:03:05,473 --> 01:03:07,899
Cast out thy demons,

896
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,565
and shock the gay away!

897
01:03:16,769 --> 01:03:19,631
Ahhhhh!

898
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:35,532
Enough.

899
01:03:37,133 --> 01:03:39,499
Excellent, excellent.

900
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:44,328
I am glad to say,
for my son, this was a success.

901
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:45,962
But for your brother...

902
01:03:45,963 --> 01:03:47,032
Agh!

903
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:49,529
...the devil would not vacate.

904
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:53,731
And being
so full of Satan, well,

905
01:03:55,204 --> 01:03:57,097
Agh!

906
01:03:57,098 --> 01:03:59,932
...he assaulted me.

907
01:03:59,933 --> 01:04:03,499
Lucifer!

908
01:04:12,196 --> 01:04:13,928
Get him.

909
01:04:16,198 --> 01:04:18,269
Look, an angel.

910
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:19,862
Huh?

911
01:04:22,965 --> 01:04:25,731
Liar!

912
01:04:29,263 --> 01:04:30,961
You Judas!

913
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:34,327
He's escaping! Catch him.

914
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:49,898
He then raced
to our church

915
01:04:49,899 --> 01:04:51,796
and set it alight!

916
01:05:20,196 --> 01:05:21,898
No!

917
01:05:21,899 --> 01:05:23,664
Gilbert, stop!

918
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:35,970
He then sacrificed himself,

919
01:05:35,971 --> 01:05:39,395
as penance for his sins.

920
01:05:39,396 --> 01:05:41,396
We tried to rescue him,

921
01:05:41,397 --> 01:05:44,603
but the inferno
was too intense.

922
01:05:44,604 --> 01:05:47,370
The good Lord took his soul.

923
01:05:50,294 --> 01:05:52,136
Let me out!

924
01:05:53,773 --> 01:05:57,194
And Lucifer
lost the battle.

925
01:06:13,334 --> 01:06:16,627
Now cleansed,
and with the baby Jesus.

926
01:06:16,628 --> 01:06:18,531
We had a memorial
for him,

927
01:06:18,532 --> 01:06:21,296
and are confident he is now
in a happier place,

928
01:06:21,297 --> 01:06:24,532
with God and the baby Jesus.

929
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:32,428
Please find enclosed a vessel
of your brother's ashes.

930
01:06:32,429 --> 01:06:34,764
I think it best you have them.

931
01:06:34,765 --> 01:06:39,394
Once again, I am sorry to be
the bearer of such tragic news.

932
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:41,266
Gilbert was a good soul,

933
01:06:41,267 --> 01:06:46,230
who, sadly, fell
to repugnant persuasions.

934
01:06:46,231 --> 01:06:48,469
We will always pray for him,

935
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:50,002
as well as you.

936
01:06:50,003 --> 01:06:53,829
Our deepest sympathies,
Ruth and Owen Appleby.

937
01:07:04,964 --> 01:07:08,535
Losing a twin
is like losing an eye, Sylvia.

938
01:07:09,896 --> 01:07:13,763
You never see the world
quite the same way again.

939
01:07:15,803 --> 01:07:19,464
Grief is a nothingness,

940
01:07:19,465 --> 01:07:22,494
leaves a metallic taste
in your mouth,

941
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:25,136
places stones in your stomach.

942
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,862
Tears don't flow.

943
01:07:29,638 --> 01:07:31,202
They're too scared.

944
01:07:32,334 --> 01:07:35,163
I no longer believed
in silver linings

945
01:07:35,164 --> 01:07:37,427
or glasses half-full.

946
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,664
My glass was shattered.

947
01:07:40,397 --> 01:07:42,401
I'd lost my mother,

948
01:07:42,402 --> 01:07:44,127
father,

949
01:07:44,128 --> 01:07:45,730
brother.

950
01:07:53,638 --> 01:07:56,964
Luckily, I had Pinky.

951
01:07:56,965 --> 01:07:58,294
Hey, Gracie.

952
01:07:58,295 --> 01:07:59,935
And Ken.

953
01:07:59,936 --> 01:08:03,763
His spoonfuls of love
kept me going.

954
01:08:06,538 --> 01:08:08,728
But, weirdly,

955
01:08:08,729 --> 01:08:12,760
my snails seemed like
my real family.

956
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:16,295
Real ones horde together
when threatened.

957
01:08:16,296 --> 01:08:18,730
Survival in numbers.

958
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:26,170
I was emotionally attached
to every single one of them.

959
01:08:26,171 --> 01:08:30,862
That's why I couldn't ever,
ever throw any of you away.

960
01:08:32,165 --> 01:08:35,061
So I kept buying,

961
01:08:35,062 --> 01:08:36,997
adding,

962
01:08:36,998 --> 01:08:38,895
and stealing.

963
01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:50,569
Eventually...

964
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:52,427
Excuse me, madam.

965
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,536
I got caught.

966
01:08:54,537 --> 01:08:57,202
The shame was crushing.

967
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,334
And there were consequences.

968
01:09:07,373 --> 01:09:09,368
Oh, Gracie.

969
01:09:17,868 --> 01:09:19,468
And then...

970
01:09:20,768 --> 01:09:23,103
...things got even worse.

971
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:26,094
Love can be blind.

972
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:28,134
Huh?

973
01:09:28,135 --> 01:09:32,268
It can hide
darkness and horror.

974
01:09:37,136 --> 01:09:40,733
It seemed Ken's onion
did have layers.

975
01:09:40,734 --> 01:09:42,697
He didn't love ME.

976
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:45,962
He loved my FAT!

977
01:09:52,903 --> 01:09:55,895
He had some sort of... fetish.

978
01:09:57,035 --> 01:09:58,770
He didn't want to fix my bowl.

979
01:09:58,771 --> 01:10:01,436
He wanted to fill it,
and fill it,

980
01:10:01,437 --> 01:10:03,367
and fill it...

981
01:10:04,264 --> 01:10:05,928
...with lard.

982
01:10:05,929 --> 01:10:09,461
It was one thing for me to
create a cage for myself.

983
01:10:09,462 --> 01:10:10,961
Bit of duck, for luck.

984
01:10:10,962 --> 01:10:14,327
It was another for
someone else to imprison me.

985
01:10:14,328 --> 01:10:15,496
Nice, Gracie.

986
01:10:15,497 --> 01:10:18,329
I knew he admired
my... largeness.

987
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:19,833
But this was something more.

988
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:22,167
Oh, yeah! Nice.

989
01:10:22,168 --> 01:10:26,701
He said he'd love me more,
the bigger I got,

990
01:10:26,702 --> 01:10:29,196
and now I knew why.

991
01:10:29,197 --> 01:10:32,163
What an idiot I was.

992
01:10:32,164 --> 01:10:34,334
But not for much longer.

993
01:10:48,572 --> 01:10:50,268
Oh!

994
01:11:03,538 --> 01:11:05,127
Sorry, Gracie.

995
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:27,669
Pinky moved in
and tended to my wounds.

996
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:30,001
I'd read that snails hibernate

997
01:11:30,002 --> 01:11:32,866
when they needed
to repair themselves.

998
01:11:32,867 --> 01:11:35,196
I slept for a week,

999
01:11:35,197 --> 01:11:37,499
and wrestled my demons.

1000
01:11:55,163 --> 01:11:57,335
Uhhhh!

1001
01:12:00,801 --> 01:12:02,900
I loathed myself.

1002
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:06,229
My hoarding had caused this.

1003
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:07,935
It had kept me poor,

1004
01:12:07,936 --> 01:12:12,734
and being poor
had kept me from Gilbert.

1005
01:12:12,735 --> 01:12:14,269
The money I'd wasted

1006
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:18,634
could have bought a dozen plane
tickets to see him, Sylvia.

1007
01:12:18,635 --> 01:12:21,334
Now, he was dead.

1008
01:12:29,703 --> 01:12:31,433
Gracie.

1009
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:36,532
Got your lunch.

1010
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:40,829
Pinky put me on a strict diet.

1011
01:12:41,697 --> 01:12:44,895
And life became
slightly bearable.

1012
01:12:45,938 --> 01:12:48,662
As I slowly emerged
from my darkness,

1013
01:12:48,663 --> 01:12:52,433
I began to notice
how much Pinky had aged.

1014
01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:56,968
I'll never forget
the day I discovered

1015
01:12:56,969 --> 01:12:59,428
she had the beginnings
of dementia,

1016
01:12:59,429 --> 01:13:01,068
when I found her attempting

1017
01:13:01,069 --> 01:13:05,169
what she thought
was a jigsaw of a rooster.

1018
01:13:06,236 --> 01:13:09,334
That was just
a few months ago, Sylvia.

1019
01:13:11,037 --> 01:13:13,999
She was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's,

1020
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,460
and went downhill quickly.

1021
01:13:16,461 --> 01:13:18,527
Pinky, what are you doing?

1022
01:13:18,528 --> 01:13:21,401
I'm looking for something.

1023
01:13:21,402 --> 01:13:22,532
What?

1024
01:13:25,967 --> 01:13:27,631
I don't know.

1025
01:13:28,503 --> 01:13:30,004
Hmm...

1026
01:13:32,067 --> 01:13:34,197
Roles reversed.

1027
01:13:34,198 --> 01:13:37,169
It was my turn to care for her.

1028
01:13:39,464 --> 01:13:43,301
Ah, my medicine.

1029
01:13:45,535 --> 01:13:48,464
One day, she decided
not to get out of bed.

1030
01:13:48,465 --> 01:13:52,061
Did I tell you that thing
I can't remember?

1031
01:13:52,062 --> 01:13:55,997
That thing I was looking for
but don't know what it is?

1032
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:59,228
Oh, stupid brain.

1033
01:13:59,229 --> 01:14:01,166
Stupid disease.

1034
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:03,998
What's the name
of that German guy

1035
01:14:03,999 --> 01:14:05,932
whose disease I got?

1036
01:14:05,933 --> 01:14:08,866
Uh... Guggenheimers?

1037
01:14:08,867 --> 01:14:11,799
Yeah, Guggenheimers.

1038
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,832
Relax, Pinky.

1039
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:15,433
It doesn't matter.

1040
01:14:16,504 --> 01:14:18,196
Oh, Gracie.

1041
01:14:18,197 --> 01:14:21,400
Such a marvellous friend.

1042
01:14:50,703 --> 01:14:53,698
Farewell, Pinky.

1043
01:14:59,601 --> 01:15:01,667
The potatoes!

1044
01:15:05,866 --> 01:15:08,293
Potatoes?

1045
01:15:08,294 --> 01:15:10,632
Potatoes...

1046
01:15:10,633 --> 01:15:11,965
Pinky...

1047
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:14,202
Pinky, what do you mean?

1048
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:17,169
Oh...

1049
01:15:17,999 --> 01:15:20,202
Oh, Pinky.

1050
01:15:50,802 --> 01:15:53,334
Farewell, Pinky.

1051
01:16:17,934 --> 01:16:20,367
Be free, Sylvia.

1052
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:45,799
Potatoes? Potatoes?

1053
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,499
Sylvia... Ugh.

1054
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,499
Maybe that's what she
wanted her last meal to be?

1055
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:56,832
Goddamn life!

1056
01:16:56,833 --> 01:16:59,335
Ugh! Goddamn life.

1057
01:16:59,336 --> 01:17:00,834
Such a...

1058
01:17:00,835 --> 01:17:04,434
Such a stupid, stupid puzzle!

1059
01:17:04,435 --> 01:17:06,094
Damn it!

1060
01:17:10,132 --> 01:17:11,965
I'm so alone.

1061
01:17:11,966 --> 01:17:15,631
So... So alone.

1062
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:29,032
Rabbit face, rabbit face,

1063
01:17:29,033 --> 01:17:31,162
rabbit face, rabbit face...

1064
01:17:31,163 --> 01:17:32,464
Nice, Gracie.

1065
01:17:32,465 --> 01:17:34,200
-Grace Pudel!
-Nice Hairdo!

1066
01:17:34,201 --> 01:17:36,866
Come on, you two. Let's go.

1067
01:17:36,867 --> 01:17:38,899
I hate it here.

1068
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,729
I'll be escaping soon,

1069
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,495
and crossing the desert
to come and get to you.

1070
01:17:42,496 --> 01:17:44,267
It saddens me to tell you

1071
01:17:44,268 --> 01:17:47,265
that Gilbert has died
in an horrific fire...

1072
01:17:47,266 --> 01:17:49,763
...fire, fire, fire, fire...

1073
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:09,433
The potatoes!

1074
01:18:12,933 --> 01:18:15,268
The p... The potatoes!

1075
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:39,202
Dear Grace,

1076
01:18:39,203 --> 01:18:44,165
if you're reading this,
then I'm as dead as a doughnut,

1077
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:47,001
and you've found my biscuit tin

1078
01:18:47,002 --> 01:18:51,065
and some things
I want you to have.

1079
01:18:51,066 --> 01:18:53,596
You've been asleep for days,

1080
01:18:53,597 --> 01:18:56,933
and I need to tell you
important stuff

1081
01:18:56,934 --> 01:18:59,631
before my brain fully rots.

1082
01:19:01,299 --> 01:19:05,032
Oh, old age is such a bastard.

1083
01:19:05,033 --> 01:19:07,662
Creeps up without you knowing.

1084
01:19:07,663 --> 01:19:11,235
One day, you sink your teeth
into an apple...

1085
01:19:12,868 --> 01:19:14,730
...and they stay.

1086
01:19:16,271 --> 01:19:19,803
You go to straighten
the wrinkles in your pantyhose,

1087
01:19:19,804 --> 01:19:23,434
and then realise
you're not wearing any.

1088
01:19:23,435 --> 01:19:24,964
Oh.

1089
01:19:24,965 --> 01:19:28,260
Anyway, I digress.

1090
01:19:28,261 --> 01:19:30,433
My secrets.

1091
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:34,000
Firstly, I'm an orphan,

1092
01:19:34,001 --> 01:19:36,767
and was raised in an orphanage,

1093
01:19:36,768 --> 01:19:39,361
after the Great War.

1094
01:19:39,362 --> 01:19:41,530
It was a terrible place,

1095
01:19:41,531 --> 01:19:45,301
where I was kept in a crib
day and night.

1096
01:19:46,034 --> 01:19:49,063
Never held or hugged.

1097
01:19:49,064 --> 01:19:51,164
The only contact,

1098
01:19:51,165 --> 01:19:54,266
the little boy next to me.

1099
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:59,196
No, I won't tell you
the horrors I remember,

1100
01:19:59,197 --> 01:20:00,628
but do want to tell you

1101
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:04,599
what it's like
to feel imprisoned,

1102
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,394
caged.

1103
01:20:06,395 --> 01:20:09,800
It was simply dreadful.

1104
01:20:09,801 --> 01:20:12,561
But, in the years since,

1105
01:20:12,562 --> 01:20:16,496
I've learnt that
the worst cages

1106
01:20:16,497 --> 01:20:21,366
are the ones we create
for ourselves.

1107
01:20:21,367 --> 01:20:25,664
You have created a cage
for yourself, Gracie.

1108
01:20:26,706 --> 01:20:30,595
Your cage
has never been locked...

1109
01:20:30,596 --> 01:20:33,829
...but your fears
have kept you trapped.

1110
01:20:37,397 --> 01:20:40,466
Get rid of those snails!

1111
01:20:41,264 --> 01:20:44,231
Set yourself free.

1112
01:20:44,232 --> 01:20:47,332
You got rid of that creepy ken.

1113
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:51,799
Now it's time for you
to shed your shell.

1114
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,928
Purge your hoard.

1115
01:20:55,801 --> 01:20:57,499
Start anew.

1116
01:20:58,331 --> 01:21:02,064
A bit of self-pity's OK,

1117
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:04,400
but it's time to move on.

1118
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:07,798
There'll be pain,

1119
01:21:07,799 --> 01:21:10,065
but that's life.

1120
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:13,160
You have to face it head-on.

1121
01:21:13,161 --> 01:21:15,070
Be brave.

1122
01:22:04,005 --> 01:22:08,899
Anyway, I want to
thank you, Gracie.

1123
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:11,265
You've been terrific.

1124
01:22:11,266 --> 01:22:15,736
Not long now
till my number's up.

1125
01:22:15,737 --> 01:22:19,230
It's time to close my curtains.

1126
01:22:19,231 --> 01:22:21,965
For the first time in my life,

1127
01:22:21,966 --> 01:22:25,131
I feel older than I look.

1128
01:22:25,132 --> 01:22:27,664
And I look like a testicle.

1129
01:22:28,771 --> 01:22:31,164
Life's a beautiful tapestry

1130
01:22:31,165 --> 01:22:35,362
that needs to be experienced.

1131
01:22:35,363 --> 01:22:39,331
It's small pleasures savoured,

1132
01:22:39,332 --> 01:22:44,169
like smoking a cigar
in the rain.

1133
01:22:46,335 --> 01:22:50,730
Or wearing a jumper
straight from the dryer.

1134
01:22:51,538 --> 01:22:53,362
Enough rambling.

1135
01:22:53,363 --> 01:22:58,096
Time for both of us to let go.

1136
01:22:58,097 --> 01:23:00,233
Like I've said,

1137
01:23:00,234 --> 01:23:04,703
life can only be understood
backwards,

1138
01:23:04,704 --> 01:23:09,002
but we have to
live it forwards.

1139
01:23:09,003 --> 01:23:13,064
Snails never go back
over their trails,

1140
01:23:13,065 --> 01:23:16,169
always moving forwards.

1141
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:20,229
Time for you to leave
some glittering snail trails

1142
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:22,433
all over the world.

1143
01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:25,831
And remember, never...

1144
01:23:25,832 --> 01:23:28,631
never go back.

1145
01:23:35,532 --> 01:23:39,596
All rise.
Order in the court.

1146
01:23:39,597 --> 01:23:43,997
Miss Pudel,
your crime is serious.

1147
01:23:43,998 --> 01:23:45,365
Theft is theft,

1148
01:23:45,366 --> 01:23:48,632
whether it be a diamond
or a cucumber.

1149
01:23:48,633 --> 01:23:50,902
And if you forgive the fox
for stealing your chickens,

1150
01:23:50,903 --> 01:23:53,433
well, then,
he'll steal your sheep.

1151
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:57,862
However...

1152
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:00,529
I can tell from your face

1153
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:03,103
that you are full of
shame and regret.

1154
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:07,362
And true regret
is punishment enough.

1155
01:24:07,363 --> 01:24:10,202
I know you are a kind person.

1156
01:24:10,203 --> 01:24:13,362
As, many years ago, a little
girl showed me kindness

1157
01:24:13,363 --> 01:24:15,929
when I was at my lowest ebb.

1158
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:17,701
Ah! Ah...

1159
01:24:17,702 --> 01:24:19,395
Ah.

1160
01:24:19,396 --> 01:24:21,897
Good on ya, little possum.

1161
01:24:21,898 --> 01:24:23,068
Good on ya.

1162
01:24:23,069 --> 01:24:25,363
That little girl gave me hope
and courage

1163
01:24:25,364 --> 01:24:27,801
to start again,
and escape my...

1164
01:24:27,802 --> 01:24:30,203
...my vices.

1165
01:24:30,204 --> 01:24:31,431
Oh!

1166
01:24:31,432 --> 01:24:34,463
You may have light fingers,
Miss Pudel,

1167
01:24:34,464 --> 01:24:36,801
but I know you have
a heart of gold,

1168
01:24:36,802 --> 01:24:39,497
and have done many good deeds.

1169
01:24:39,498 --> 01:24:44,327
I therefore release you
from your charges.

1170
01:24:44,328 --> 01:24:46,701
Case dismissed.

1171
01:24:46,702 --> 01:24:49,037
Ah!

1172
01:25:08,532 --> 01:25:11,669
Life had bashed me
round a bit,

1173
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:15,028
but the roses smelt better.

1174
01:25:15,029 --> 01:25:19,730
And I finally started to become
the person I'd always wanted.

1175
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:23,766
I made a film about my life.

1176
01:25:43,672 --> 01:25:45,763
It wasn't very good.

1177
01:25:46,572 --> 01:25:48,697
But a few people came.

1178
01:25:48,698 --> 01:25:51,800
I even had a question
and answer session afterwards.

1179
01:25:51,801 --> 01:25:55,029
Any... Any questions?

1180
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:59,193
Mm-mm.

1181
01:25:59,194 --> 01:26:01,301
Mmm...

1182
01:26:04,303 --> 01:26:06,261
Oh, well.

1183
01:26:06,262 --> 01:26:08,136
Thanks for coming.

1184
01:26:09,305 --> 01:26:11,169
Yes.

1185
01:26:13,099 --> 01:26:14,664
I've got one.

1186
01:26:17,638 --> 01:26:21,367
Do you believe in magic?

1187
01:26:33,668 --> 01:26:35,403
Gilbert?

1188
01:26:35,404 --> 01:26:38,862
Yes, it's me.

1189
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,895
I... I walked across
that desert.

1190
01:27:42,932 --> 01:27:46,070
It took me a while
to believe Gilbert was alive...

1191
01:27:53,497 --> 01:27:55,466
...how he'd
escaped the fire...

1192
01:27:59,435 --> 01:28:02,731
...and how his ashes
were nothing more than...

1193
01:28:02,732 --> 01:28:04,367
ashes.

1194
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:09,268
His urn
now found a new purpose.

1195
01:28:12,464 --> 01:28:15,933
The cycle of life continued.

1196
01:28:15,934 --> 01:28:19,334
And your job was done, Sylvia.

1197
01:28:21,071 --> 01:28:25,235
We were all
finally free of our cages.

1198
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:32,829
And even though our family
had shrunk a little...

1199
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:37,202
...we were together again...

1200
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:47,334
...with only one thing
left to release.

1201
01:28:55,104 --> 01:28:58,301
Gilbert still smelt
like burnt matches.

1202
01:28:59,806 --> 01:29:03,535
The setting sun
tingled our skin,

1203
01:29:03,536 --> 01:29:05,565
our two souls...

1204
01:29:06,869 --> 01:29:09,532
...and our single heart.
