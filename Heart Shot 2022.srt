3
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,625
Maybe.

4
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,794
It depends if they get
another cash offer.

5
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,047
Sorry.

6
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,180
Hey, I just found this in the lot.

7
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:56,973
Thanks.

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,688
Sam.

9
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,693
Last chance for you to come with us.

10
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,070
I'm good.

11
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,489
And you're sure you're gonna be okay?

12
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,533
I'll be at college in five months.

13
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,452
I know. I know.

14
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,996
Go to the meet. I'll be fine.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,583
And you promise,
you're not gonna have anyone over?

16
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,834
Yes.

17
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,169
Including Nikki.

18
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,172
I think that's dumb, but, yes.

19
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,425
If her mom is around, her place is fine.

20
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,762
She's still not out to her mom yet.

21
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,472
-Please, let that go.
-Okay.

22
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,350
-Mom, hurry up.
-I'm not gonna fight about it.

23
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:41,893
Right.

24
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,470
Hey.

25
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,097
Hey.

26
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,684
I love when you wear this jacket.

27
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,604
Thanks. I like your whole outfit.

28
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,649
Thanks.

29
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,289
I'm worried someone's gonna see
and tell your mom.

30
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,916
We're not doing anything bad, okay?

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,419
We're just… being together.

32
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,213
For two whole days.

33
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,756
-Okay.
-Okay?

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,091
-Okay.
-Okay.

35
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,636
You ready? You ready?

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,971
I'm ready.

37
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,765
-Oh my God. What?

38
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,101
Oh my goodness.

39
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,729
You're literally like the coolest person
I've ever met.

40
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,316
How would your senior year have been
different if you didn't move here?

41
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,984
A lot more boring.

42
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,236
I hated my old town.

43
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,363
Why?

44
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,492
<i>I had to pretend to be</i>
<i>someone I'm not, you know?</i>

45
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,036
<i>Hmm.</i>

46
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,037
<i>I do.</i>

47
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,374
<i>How would your senior year be different?</i>

48
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,793
<i>Also pretty boring.</i>

49
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,590
There are no queer girls at school.

50
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,799
<i>I've noticed.</i>

51
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,886
<i>But that's not the only reason.</i>

52
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,846
<i>Oh, yeah. No. Me either.</i>

53
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,268
<i>You gotta keep stirring.</i>

54
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,853
Did your mom teach you this?

55
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:53,149
We were all taught the basic stuff,
but this I learned on YouTube

56
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,945
so I can make it for you,
which means it might be very bad.

57
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,780
High stakes.

58
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:05,078
When you said, "We all,"
you mean your older sisters?

59
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,121
Yeah.

60
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,375
You don't talk about them much.

61
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,294
We're not close.

62
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,589
Do, um…

63
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,926
any of them know about us?

64
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,889
Not yet.

65
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,274
Here.

66
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,701
Okay, I'm actually mad
at how good this is.

67
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,244
-Really?
-Yes.

68
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,414
I wanna eat this and kiss you
at the same time. Come here.

69
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,832
-Gross.
-Come here!

70
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,694
Hey, honey, you live here?

71
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,611
Yeah.

72
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,032
Great, um, do you know
which way to Mountain View?

73
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,992
Up on the left.

74
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,494
Perfect. Thanks so much.

75
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,982
<i>This feels different today.</i>

76
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,903
<i>Different how?</i>

77
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,328
<i>Almost like we're living together?</i>

78
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,377
I hope this doesn't sound crazy, but

79
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,630
I think you should come
to Nashville with me.

80
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,635
I know you don't wanna do college,
but you could get a job.

81
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,679
We can get an apartment near campus.

82
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,682
I've always wanted to adopt a cat
with a really weird face.

83
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,478
Like a scrunched up one
that gets grumpy all the time.

84
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,529
Well, maybe we should wait
a few more months to decide

85
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,322
just in case you change your mind.

86
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,281
What?

87
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,367
Which would be really understandable.

88
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,959
I love you.

89
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,176
Do you not feel the same?

90
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,262
Oh, no, no. I…

91
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,224
I'm just worried
you don't know me well enough.

92
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,895
We've spent every moment
that we can together for months.

93
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,356
I know.

94
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,154
I try not to lie,

95
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,574
but there are things about me

96
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,577
and my family I haven't told you.

97
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,329
What does that mean?

98
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:44,130
When I was younger,
my sisters and I would do these races,

99
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,674
like, to see who's the strongest
or the fastest.

100
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,304
And this one time, I was in second place.

101
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,265
I really wanted to win.

102
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:56,934
So,

103
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,396
I threw a rock at my sister's head.

104
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,816
Was she okay?

105
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,445
She needed 18 stitches.

106
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,155
What did your mom say?

107
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,701
She was happy I won the race.

108
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,664
How did you feel when you did it?

109
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,003
Proud of myself.

110
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,841
That's bad, right?

111
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,519
I've had issues… with my dad.

112
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,688
So, I know how hard family can be.

113
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,443
I love you.

114
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,748
<i>Sam…</i>

115
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,503
<i>I want you to have that cat.</i>

116
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,006
<i>But it can't be with me.</i>

117
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,928
<i>I'm sorry that I can't explain more.</i>

118
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,893
<i>But I promise, one day, if I can ever</i>
<i>make things different, I'll come back.</i>

119
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,774
<i>I'll find you wherever you are,</i>

120
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,068
<i>and I'll tell you the truth.</i>

121
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,831
Show me your hands.

122
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,668
Please. Please don't hurt me.

123
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,253
Show me your hands.

124
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,091
-Let me see your hands!
No, please.

125
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,093
I don't understand.

126
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,178
Hands!

127
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,137
Now!

128
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,788
-What--
-Don't say anything.

129
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,377
I'm here. You can untie her.

130
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,047
I liked your hair shorter.

131
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,091
She doesn't know anything. I promise.

132
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,926
But I'm curious what she does know.

133
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,970
Who do you think this is?

134
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,724
Nikki, my girlfriend.

135
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:09,019
Wow. What do you tell her?
Your parents just work a lot?

136
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,938
That's why she's never seen them?

137
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,817
I assume she's never seen
that shithole you sleep in.

138
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,944
You're so selfish.

139
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,029
Fine! I'll go back!

140
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,823
I'll do whatever Mom wants.

141
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,366
Mom wants punishment.

142
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,909
What do you think that looks like?

143
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,119
You can't take her.

144
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,287
I <i>am</i> taking her.

145
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,167
Don't worry. Mom said not to kill you.

146
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,753
Just to beat the fucking shit out of you.

147
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,214
Ty, please, you're my sister.

148
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,341
You're too weak to be my sister.

149
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,653
Stop! Stop, don't!

150
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,405
Please stop! Stop!

151
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,451
You are killing her!
Stop! Please don't do this!

152
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,204
No, please don't do this!
Don't hurt her! Stop! Nikki!

153
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,706
Nikki! Nikki! Nikki!

154
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,210
Nikki, please! Nikki!

155
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,963
Nikki, hey!

156
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,803
Nikki!

157
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,227
<i>I promise, one day,</i>

158
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,772
<i>if I can ever make things different,</i>
<i>I'll come back.</i>

159
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:03,027
<i>I'll find you wherever you are,</i>
<i>and I'll tell you the truth.</i>

160
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,030
<i>I love you too.</i>
