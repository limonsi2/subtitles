3
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,166
I wish you'd knock.

4
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:09,958
I did knock.

5
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,000
...is knocking.

6
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,958
Come on Grandpa, I need to clean in here
before taking Diego to school.

7
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,958
You can read your poetry
in the living room.

8
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:21,333
Come on.

9
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:53,958
Do you want to take the Rubik's Cube?

10
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:54,958
Yes.

11
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,958
Let's go, son.

12
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:03,958
Where is he?

13
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:05,958
Maybe he forgot.

14
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,958
Do I have to go with him?

15
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,958
Yes, son. He is your dad.

16
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:18,958
Here he is.

17
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,166
Your role model.

18
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,666
Hi!

19
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:22,958
What's up, Max?

20
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,166
Hello, Antonio.

21
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:25,958
How are you, little man?

22
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,958
Hi Dad!

23
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,958
Not a little man any more,
you have grown up a lot...

24
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,833
You're so grown up! Look!

25
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,958
It's cool, right?

26
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,000
It's super cool, Dad.

27
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,958
You're not too old to play
with small cars, right?

28
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:41,000
No!

29
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,958
It's very cool!

30
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,500
- It has a helmet and the full gear
for an adventure.
- Thanks, Dad.

31
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:44,958
Cool, little man.

32
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,000
Don't you think this might be too much?

33
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,833
I bought him something simple
for his birthday.

34
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:50,958
It's only a small car...

35
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:52,958
...it's really not a big deal.

36
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:53,958
Besides, it's not that expensive.

37
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,958
I have to leave now.

38
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,833
Remember, try not to give him candy...

39
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,958
...that he needs to brush his teeth,
and is in bed at 8.

40
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:06,958
What?

41
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,833
Oh María, it's just that...

42
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:10,958
A job came up.

43
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,958
No, come on! No...

44
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,958
It's a very important recording session
in San Miguel de Allende.

45
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,958
Also, it's important for my reputation!

46
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:22,958
You have one of those?

47
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:25,958
Gosh, Max.

48
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,666
How do you manage to be that rude to me
and still make me laugh?

49
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,833
So what do I do? What do I do?

50
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:34,333
I don't know.

51
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,333
I can't take Diego with me.

52
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,958
I don't know what to do.

53
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,958
But I can't quit either...

54
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,958
...please?

55
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,333
I promise this is the last time
I let you down.

56
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:45,958
Ok?

57
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,958
Son...

58
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:55,958
I have to leave.

59
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,958
I'll come get you after
and we'll have a great time...

60
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,958
...and I'll bring something back for you
from my trip.

61
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:05,958
Thank you.

62
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:08,958
I love you little man!

63
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:10,958
See you, Max.

64
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,000
Thank you.

65
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:14,958
I owe you one.

66
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,333
No, no, you owe me like three hundred!

67
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,958
Let's make it four hundred!

68
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:18,958
I'll make it up to you later, OK?

69
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:19,958
Thank you!

70
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,958
Well, I've still got this work trip!

71
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,333
So, what do we do?

72
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,958
Well, I can stay with my great grandpa.

73
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,958
Of course, I can take care of him.

74
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:39,666
No, no. The two of you alone
are more dangerous
than a monkey with a gun.

75
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,958
I am eighty years old.

76
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,166
Exactly.

77
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,166
Come on, go pack!

78
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:10,958
I made the card!

79
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:11,958
I made it!

80
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:25,958
It’s in Spanish, Mama.

81
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,958
What?

82
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:28,958
Oh yes, of course.

83
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:54,958
Why is she laughing?

84
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,166
This English man thought
I translated his book.

85
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,958
That's very funny because
you don't do anything!

86
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:18,958
I'm a hag!

87
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:21,958
Careful!

88
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,958
Hey!

89
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,958
Watch your step!

90
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,958
Do you have your eyes stuck
up your butt, dude?

91
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,000
What's up with that guy?

92
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,958
Come on Diego, let's get out.

93
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,166
Help your great grandpa.

94
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,958
Yes, help him, help him.

95
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:58,958
The car seat!

96
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,166
The seat!

97
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,958
The seat, please!

98
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,958
Yes, just next to it.

99
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:24,958
Please welcome the author of
El Corazón Sensible...

100
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:26,958
Henry Copper!

101
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,833
Welcome, Mr Copper.

102
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:48,958
First I'd like to thank you,
on behalf of everyone here,

103
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,958
for this gift...

104
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,666
...this delicious book.

105
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,958
Thank you. Thank you very much.

106
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:06,833
I would like to start, if I may,
by asking you...

107
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,958
...how did you get the idea
for this torrid romance?

108
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,500
Experience and imagination.

109
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,958
You must be very imaginative then...
and very experienced!

110
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:48,333
Of course, when I say this
I'm thinking of one
particular part of the book.

111
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,958
Do you mind if I read it out loud?

112
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,958
You know what? We would love to.

113
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,958
But Mr. Copper is a busy man.

114
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,958
He has many things to do...
novels to write...

115
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,958
OK. OK. I'll just read it quickly.
Just quickly.

116
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:09,000
Chapter nine, the morning after
Claire meets Martin.

117
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,958
We’ve all read it, what’s the point?

118
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,958
“Every fibre of Claire’s being
was transformed...

119
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:22,958
...Martin’s powerful desire
had overcome her fear of love.”

120
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:38,958
You describe the workings of desire,
of lust, so well.

121
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:41,958
It's incredible.

122
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:47,958
And best of all it’s like you understand
what it is to be a man and a woman,
sexually possessed.

123
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,958
May I read my favourite part?

124
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,958
Another one? Dear God.

125
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,958
I am going to read THE scene.

126
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:07,500
"That night he came to her again,
charged like a stallion."

127
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:13,333
"Claire, he said, we will always long
for each other's touch,

128
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:18,958
each other's taste,
but it will always be forbidden."

129
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,958
“But tonight let us forget the rules...

130
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,000
...tonight we are unashamed,
we are beasts...

131
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,500
...beasts in the desert heat."

132
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:45,958
"Claire, he said, tonight...

133
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,958
"Claire. Tonight...

134
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,666
That’s not what it says!

135
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:48,958
She’s making it up!

136
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,666
Oh so now we're all translators!

137
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:52,500
She’s a liar!

138
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,958
Yes! Translate it properly!

139
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,958
Yes! Translate it properly, you cow!

140
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,958
Hey, hey... a little respect, no?

141
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,958
I mean, I mean...

142
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,958
Perhaps you would like to
refresh your memory of the text.

143
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:05,958
But...

144
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:06,958
What the hell is with this woman?

145
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,333
It's her job...

146
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,958
No, no, I'll read it. I'll read it!

147
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,833
That's better!

148
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:53,333
What was that all about?

149
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,958
I think your mother is about
to get into trouble.

150
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:05,958
Pedro! So happy you're here now!

151
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:06,958
Hi María!

152
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:31,958
Where were you?

153
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:35,958
We were just talking, Grandpa.

154
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:37,958
I'll explain later. Get in! Get in!

155
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:04,958
Damn English.

156
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:10,958
Mama, shouldn't you say it's your book?

157
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:11,958
It seems really unfair.

158
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,666
Welcome to the entire
history of women, Diego.

159
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:38,958
Oh my God!

160
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:40,958
Oh my God!

161
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,958
It’s you! Henry Copper!

162
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,958
I love your book!

163
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,833
You're so handsome!

164
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:30,958
My next guest is the author

165
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:33,958
of the literary sensation of the year,

166
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:35,958
The Sensible Heart.

167
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:40,958
I love this book!
It makes me tingle inside!

168
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,958
And his translator, María Rodeo.

169
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:49,666
Rodríguez.

170
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:41,958
Of course. The Usurper!

171
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:19,833
I just changed everything.

172
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:20,958
I'm sorry, what?

173
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:22,958
Yes, I mean...

174
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:27,666
...I changed everything
from English to Spanish...

175
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:29,333
...making sure to keep

176
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:32,500
the brilliant, amazing words
of Mr. Copper.

177
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,958
You must feel very lucky?

178
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,958
You have no idea.

179
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:40,500
Yes

180
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:41,666
Yes

181
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:50,958
Always ask for a hardback.

182
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,958
More money for the author... and me.

183
00:35:56,958 --> 00:36:01,958
Your book has filled my heart with love
and my body with desire.

184
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:06,833
You!

185
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,958
Mr. Copper, I never understood men
before I read this book.

186
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,958
Now my bed is never empty!

187
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:27,958
My partner and I dress
as your characters for...

188
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:28,958
...our intimate moments.

189
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:40,958
Here, here. Look!

190
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:46,958
Thank you.

191
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:47,958
Thank you.

192
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:48,958
No, no. Stop, stop.

193
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:52,958
For Miguelito.

194
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:42,958
What the hell?

195
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:44,958
What's up, María?

196
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:46,958
What are you doing here?

197
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,666
What am I doing here?
What are YOU doing here?

198
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,500
You said you were in San Miguel.

199
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,958
Ah, yes. I did go.

200
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:56,958
We had the recording session,
and I did really well!

201
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:01,958
I'm sorry, I know I should have told you.

202
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:03,958
But that's how these things are...

203
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:05,958
...they invited me on a tour so here I am.

204
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:13,958
Where is Diego?

205
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:17,333
Where do you think? Sleeping.

206
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,833
Let's see. You left my son alone?

207
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,958
You really are unbelievable.

208
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:02,500
Here!

209
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:34,958
Do you want to know what love is?

210
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,958
Love is being lied to.

211
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:39,958
Love leaves you stranded...

212
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:42,958
...alone, and penniless ...

213
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:46,000
...with a grandfather and a child
who won't let you even breathe...

214
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:50,958
Diego, listen to me...

215
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:52,333
No, no I didn't mean it!

216
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:07,958
I don’t speak English.

217
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:14,958
Don't speak...

218
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,958
One moment.

219
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:28,958
I wish...

220
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:30,500
...to buy...

221
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,958
...some hens.

222
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:36,958
Your mother...

223
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:38,958
...is...

224
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:39,958
...ill.

225
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,958
Your mother...

226
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:43,958
...is...

227
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:45,500
...angry.

228
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:48,000
But...

229
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,958
...I love you.

230
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:51,958
She...

231
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:52,958
...loves you.

232
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:57,666
The woman...

233
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,958
...is crazy...

234
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:01,958
...but she loves you...

235
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:04,500
...because

236
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,958
...you are...

237
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:07,958
...her husband.

238
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:10,958
Her man.

239
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:15,000
She is angry...

240
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,958
...with me because...

241
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:21,958
...I am...

242
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:22,958
...a spoon.

243
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:26,666
Please...

244
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:27,958
...show me...

245
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:29,958
...your towels.

246
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,958
I have broken my bottom.

247
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:41,958
You understand?

248
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:01,958
Very good, Pedro, very good.

249
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:03,958
Mama, you didn't say he was funny!

250
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:04,958
Where were you?

251
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:11,333
Can you forgive me, son?

252
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:15,958
I'm sorry my love.

253
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:18,500
Can I have a hug?

254
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,958
Do you have the TV remote? Turn it up!

255
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,500
Who is this guy?

256
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:21,958
Thomas the chauffeur!

257
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:47,958
Who are you?

258
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:11,958
Goodnight.

259
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:51,000
On the count of three, say "Pedro!"

260
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,833
Let's go!

261
01:00:30,666 --> 01:00:31,958
Come on son, get in the car.

262
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:13,958
Expecting someone?

263
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:18,166
For you and me.

264
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:20,833
But I'm working, Antonio.

265
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:22,958
María, the place is empty.

266
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:26,958
Come on, sit with me!

267
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:28,500
Ok, fine.

268
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:37,958
So where's your British friend?

269
01:01:38,958 --> 01:01:40,833
Ah! So you're watching me?

270
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:42,000
I'm not watching you,
it's just social media!

271
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,958
Yes, you're watching me!

272
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:45,958
No! You open social media
and photos start to show up...

273
01:01:45,958 --> 01:01:47,958
Anyway. This is why I came.

274
01:01:53,666 --> 01:01:54,958
For Diego and for you.

275
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,833
From the gig.

276
01:01:56,958 --> 01:01:57,958
Thank you.

277
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:00,958
I'll take it off what you owe me.

278
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,958
It's not that much!

279
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:11,958
You're wearing the shirt
you had on when I first met you.

280
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:15,958
And the truth is...

281
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:18,958
...you look just as beautiful and as sexy.

282
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:25,958
Thanks for reminding me
I have no new clothes.

283
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:33,958
María, how are you?

284
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,958
You know you can count on me, right?

285
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:45,166
You can trust me.

286
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:46,958
We're a family.

287
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:56,958
Have you ever...

288
01:02:59,958 --> 01:03:02,958
Have you ever had a week where...

289
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,958
...where everything made sense?

290
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:08,958
As if...

291
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:13,958
...as if your life was just
as you dreamt it?

292
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,500
And then suddenly...

293
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:21,000
...you come back to reality and...

294
01:03:21,958 --> 01:03:23,958
...it's over.

295
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:28,166
Nevermind, forget it.
Pretend I didn't say anything.

296
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:31,958
I understand.

297
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,958
I understand perfectly.

298
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:38,958
We've all been through moments like these.

299
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:43,958
Come on!

300
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:46,833
Why don't we go somewhere else?

301
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:49,500
This place is a little depressing,
isn't it?

302
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:51,958
We could go somewhere else and talk.

303
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:53,958
Talk?

304
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:58,333
Though not at my house because
my roommates are having another party...

305
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:00,333
...and you know how it gets.

306
01:04:01,666 --> 01:04:03,958
Ok. Let's go to mine.

307
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:06,958
But just to talk.

308
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:09,958
Just to talk.

309
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:18,958
I'll come back for breakfast.

310
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:19,958
OK.

311
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:21,333
I'll call you.

312
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:22,958
Sure.

313
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:33,958
No, no, Pedro, no!

314
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:36,000
I've helped you already, I'm done!

315
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:39,666
But María, you'd only do half the work!

316
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:41,958
Yes, and he would be getting
all the credit.

317
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,958
Yes, but it's his name that will
sell the book.

318
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:46,958
Credit doesn’t pay your bills.

319
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:48,958
Just think about it, and then say yes.

320
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:51,166
You can use my house.

321
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:53,958
We both know that man
can't do it without you.

322
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:04,333
Good morning, María Fernanda Rodríguez.

323
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,833
It's good to see you again.

324
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:14,958
Good morning, Mr. Copper.

325
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:44,000
Goodbye!

326
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:07,958
How are you?

327
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:01,958
Hey! Here you go!

328
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:02,958
Thank you!

329
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:03,958
Happy Carnival!

330
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:17,958
How are you, Antonio?

331
01:15:19,958 --> 01:15:21,500
How are you?

332
01:15:40,958 --> 01:15:42,000
I get it now. I get it.

333
01:15:42,958 --> 01:15:45,958
Everything you talked about in the bar...

334
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,958
...is because you met this
English man, right?

335
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:51,958
So what? You thought that your life was
going to suddenly become
marvelous and fantastic?

336
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:55,958
María, you really think this guy is going
to make you a writer?

337
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:58,958
No, I don't think so,
because I already am a writer, Antonio.
Yes, I am.

338
01:15:58,958 --> 01:16:03,958
María, be realistic. He is
a writer. You work in a bar.

339
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:07,958
That's it. That's reality,
whether you like it or not.
I'm not saying it's fair...

340
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:10,958
...but life isn't fair
and you know that very well.

341
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:12,958
I don't understand what the hell you want!

342
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:15,958
You do know. Stop playing,
you're not a teenager anymore, María.

343
01:16:22,958 --> 01:16:25,958
It's your turn to
take care of Diego on Saturday. Show up!

344
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:27,958
No, no. If you want I can
pick him up right now...

345
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,000
...so you can party!

346
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:26,958
Good morning.

347
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:07,958
See you later.

348
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,666
Good morning.

349
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:17,958
Hello!

350
01:24:58,958 --> 01:24:59,958
That son of a bitch!

351
01:30:45,166 --> 01:30:47,000
Mama! Come with me! Quickly!

352
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:48,958
What are you doing here, son?

353
01:30:48,958 --> 01:30:50,333
No, you have to see this!

354
01:30:51,958 --> 01:30:52,166
Hurry!

355
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:53,958
Wait!

356
01:30:53,958 --> 01:30:54,958
Wait, Diego!

357
01:30:55,958 --> 01:30:57,500
Hey! What?

358
01:31:00,958 --> 01:31:02,000
That's your name.

359
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:03,166
Wow.

360
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,500
He put your name on it!

361
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:05,333
Yes.

362
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:07,958
You wrote it, right?

363
01:31:07,958 --> 01:31:08,958
Yes.

364
01:31:08,958 --> 01:31:10,958
Then you should be there!

365
01:31:10,958 --> 01:31:11,958
It's today!

366
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:13,958
Let's go!

367
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:36,958
Ladies and gentlemen.

368
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:41,000
Please welcome, Mr. Henry Copper!

369
01:31:57,333 --> 01:31:59,958
Thank you very much.

370
01:32:01,958 --> 01:32:04,958
Thank you for your warm reception.

371
01:32:05,958 --> 01:32:08,958
I don't deserve it...

372
01:32:08,958 --> 01:32:10,958
...even though I am pretty sexy...

373
01:32:11,958 --> 01:32:13,958
Yes, he is!

374
01:32:14,958 --> 01:32:16,000
...for an Englishman.

375
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:19,958
I mean it...

376
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:23,958
...you should see some of us.

377
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:28,958
Generally, we are awful.

378
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:32,958
Yeah, sometimes they stink.

379
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:36,958
Thank you.

380
01:34:03,958 --> 01:34:06,958
I knew it. I knew it!

381
01:35:08,958 --> 01:35:09,958
It's her!

382
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:12,958
Hello.

383
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:48,958
What did he say?

384
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:51,333
He said he's an idiot.

385
01:35:51,333 --> 01:35:51,958
Yes!

386
01:35:52,958 --> 01:35:53,958
He's an idiot.

387
01:35:57,958 --> 01:35:58,958
What are you doing here?

388
01:36:09,958 --> 01:36:12,958
According to them,
it's a lovely story, but...

389
01:36:15,958 --> 01:36:16,958
Sorry?

390
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:17,958
Who are you?

391
01:36:18,958 --> 01:36:19,958
Sorry.

392
01:36:20,333 --> 01:36:22,958
I'm her husband, she's my wife!

393
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:25,166
It's the husband!

394
01:36:25,958 --> 01:36:27,958
Through common law.
It’s not the same thing!

395
01:36:27,958 --> 01:36:29,958
This is better than a telenovela!

396
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:30,958
And him?

397
01:36:31,958 --> 01:36:32,958
Who is he?

398
01:36:32,958 --> 01:36:33,958
Have you asked yourselves?

399
01:36:33,958 --> 01:36:37,500
That Englishman has come here
and stolen my woman.

400
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:41,958
Are we in the stone age or what?

401
01:36:43,958 --> 01:36:44,958
María, what happened?

402
01:36:45,958 --> 01:36:47,958
I thought I could have you back...

403
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:49,000
...and my son...

404
01:36:49,958 --> 01:36:51,958
...and the love of my family.

405
01:36:51,958 --> 01:36:56,958
And then, I open this shit
and I read page 125.

406
01:36:58,833 --> 01:36:59,958
"They made...

407
01:37:00,166 --> 01:37:02,958
...love like two dragons...

408
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:05,958
...exploding in the flames of a volcano."

409
01:37:05,958 --> 01:37:07,958
Hey, spoilers!

410
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:09,958
No, no it's not a spoiler.

411
01:37:09,958 --> 01:37:13,958
It's the trash that Henry Copper
wrote about my woman.

412
01:37:23,958 --> 01:37:25,958
Yes, yes, very sexy.

413
01:37:25,958 --> 01:37:29,333
Sexy? This nerd? No, no...

414
01:37:34,958 --> 01:37:35,958
Believe me, Antonio...

415
01:37:35,958 --> 01:37:38,958
...Henry knows a lot about sexy.

416
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:45,333
You think because you play the trumpet,
and lounge about all day...

417
01:37:45,333 --> 01:37:47,958
...and never button up your shirt,
that you’re a man?

418
01:37:47,958 --> 01:37:49,500
Is that what being a man is?

419
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,958
Staying out, never being home,
and never being there?

420
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:56,958
That's not true, María.

421
01:37:57,958 --> 01:37:58,958
I've always been there for you.

422
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:02,333
A few days ago when you were sad,
where did you cry, huh?

423
01:38:02,333 --> 01:38:03,958
Here! On my shoulder!

424
01:38:18,958 --> 01:38:19,958
Stop him!

425
01:38:48,958 --> 01:38:49,958
I'm going to kill you!

426
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:51,958
Let me go!

427
01:38:52,958 --> 01:38:54,958
Yeah, get out!

428
01:38:58,958 --> 01:39:01,958
Tie him up and throw him
straight into the trash!

429
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:09,958
I think my water just broke.

430
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:15,333
It's coming!

431
01:40:58,958 --> 01:40:59,958
María, what a pleasure!

432
01:41:01,958 --> 01:41:06,166
So, what a great book!
Very impressive!
