<i>[McGinty] The individual officer</i>

<i>And he was known for overreacting.</i>

163
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,103

<i>-[sirens wailing faintly]</i>

<i>realized it was lunacy.</i>

170

<i>This was a wild goose chase,</i>
<i>and it was a fiasco.</i>

173
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,010

{\an8}<i>The first time I heard that, I thought,</i>
<i>"What… Who gave this order?"</i>

<i>for this event</i>

<i>They see the police bullets</i>
<i>going through the car,</i>

313
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,636
<i>and they think they're coming at them</i>
<i>from the people within.</i>

314
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,390
<i>They're actually coming from the police</i>
<i>on the opposite side of them.</i>

315
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,478
<i>Miraculously, of these 137 shots</i>
<i>that we know about,</i>

316
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,688
<i>none hit the other police officers.</i>

317
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,107
<i>Many of 'em hit other police cars.</i>

318
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,571
<i>[emotional music playing]</i>

319
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,250
<i>[Schultz] I have spoken to</i>
<i>a lot of police officers off the record,</i>

320
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,878
<i>which is the only way</i>
<i>they'll talk to you about this.</i>

321
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,589
<i>And the adrenaline rush is considerable.</i>

322
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,884
<i>The camaraderie of the police</i>
<i>is very real.</i>

323
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:19,681
<i>Every story is about the humans in it,</i>
<i>and this is a story about human beings.</i>

324
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,392
<i>[reporter 4] </i>{\an8}Union officials say

325
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,728
{\an8}<i>they believe</i>
<i>the officers' actions were justified.</i>

326
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,189
<i>They say the suspects</i>
<i>should have pulled over,</i>

327
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:31,443
<i>and added that the prosecutor took months</i>
<i>to go over the officers' actions,</i>

328
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,863
<i>when the officers only had seconds</i>
<i>to make decisions.</i>

329
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,243
{\an8}<i>"The police formed</i>
<i>a circular firing squad."</i>

330
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,121
{\an8}<i>You know? Stop. You're not an activist.</i>

331
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:46,250
{\an8}<i>You're the prosecutor</i>
<i>of the largest county in the state.</i>

332
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:58,095
<i>The long and the short of it</i>
<i>is that a policeman got shot at, you know.</i>

333
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,056
<i>That's the facts</i>
<i>that they knew at the time.</i>

334
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,894
<i>Mr. Russell and Malissa, they drive by,</i>

335
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,563
<i>cap a round off.</i>

336
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,149
<i>And we're saying "cap a round off"</i>

337
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,235
<i>because police officers</i>
<i>know the difference between a backfire</i>

338
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,736
<i>and a gunfire.</i>

339
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,407
<i>It might not be pretty,</i>

340
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,034
<i>but it's not a set of circumstances</i>

341
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,163
<i>any of those police officers up there</i>
<i>chose to be in.</i>

342
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:29,376
<i>Tim Russell and Malissa Williams</i>
<i>made those choices.</i>

343
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,385
<i>My brother lived with me,</i>
<i>off and on, for nine years,</i>

344
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,095
<i>so we were really close.</i>

345
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,097
<i>I know he had issues,</i>

346
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,434
{\an8}<i>but it doesn't mean</i>
<i>that you're a bad person.</i>

347
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,396
<i>You know, for the most part,</i>
<i>he would be clean</i>

348
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:52,149
<i>for like six, seven years at a time,</i>

349
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,609
<i>and then he would, like…</i>

350
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,028
<i>You know, bad things</i>
<i>that happened to him in his life,</i>

351
00:19:56,111 --> 00:20:00,073
<i>and he would wind up doing drugs,</i>
<i>but he always came out of that.</i>

352
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:05,621
<i>The media is trying to make it seem</i>
<i>like this was just a no-good drug addict.</i>

353
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,790
<i>They were saying he got what he deserved,</i>
<i>in so many words.</i>

354
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,001
<i>That's not who he was.</i>

355
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,253
<i>Anybody that knew Tim</i>

356
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,506
<i>was just, like, shocked</i>
<i>that this happened to Tim.</i>

357
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,592
<i>'Cause he liked people. He loved people.</i>

358
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,178
<i>-He was really the life of the party.</i>
<i>-[laughs]</i>

359
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,765
<i>-Tim would come in a door, bubbly.</i>
<i>-[Michelle] But it wasn't just us. It was…</i>

360
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,476
<i>-Just people in general.</i>
<i>-Yeah, he would.</i>

361
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,647
<i>[Michelle] This is Tim there in</i>
<i>the white shirt. He's holding the Bible.</i>

362
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,776
<i>We knew there was never a gun.</i>

363
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,570
<i>That wasn't even a question in my mind.</i>

364
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,907
<i>And then, we all knew</i>
<i>that his car backfired,</i>

365
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,159
<i>so when they were talking</i>
<i>about the gunshot,</i>

366
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,912
<i>we already knew it had to be the backfire.</i>

367
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,747
<i>And it's just…</i>

368
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,125
<i>It's just obvious to me</i>
<i>that the police were upset</i>

369
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,835
<i>that they did not pull over.</i>

370
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,675
<i>And, by the way, the police union,</i>
<i>they knew that there was no gun</i>

371
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:04,346
<i>because one of the police officers</i>
<i>told them the night of the chase</i>

372
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,141
<i>that he witnessed the car backfiring</i>
<i>like two or three times,</i>

373
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,102
<i>and he saw the muffler come off or--</i>

374
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:15,357
<i>He told the union representative this,</i>
<i>and they told him to keep his mouth shut.</i>

375
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,860
<i>This is in the testimonies</i>
<i>of the police officers.</i>

376
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,237
{\an8}<i>[groans, sighs]</i>

377
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,241
{\an8}<i>[man 2] What we need to do,</i>
<i>since you were the number-one car,</i>

378
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,743
{\an8}<i>is talk about these backfire things.</i>

379
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,496
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-Okay. I seen it.</i>

380
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,873
<i>There was the flash, okay.</i>
<i>The flash of the tailpipe.</i>

381
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,000
<i>Out of the tailpipe, okay.</i>

382
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,876
<i>-Like… Vroom! You know?</i>
<i>-Uh-huh.</i>

383
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,046
<i>And then, pop, another backfire,</i>
<i>and he took off.</i>

384
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,216
<i>Maybe the backfire started</i>
<i>this whole chain of events.</i>

385
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,219
<i>I got nothing to hide.</i>
<i>I just wanna do this the right way.</i>

386
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,305
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>
<i>I'm not, you know…</i>

387
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,849
<i>It's… [laughs] You know.</i>

388
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,935
<i>-I had to call… I called the union.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

389
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,062
<i>What did the union say when you told them?</i>

390
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,023
<i>They were like,</i>
<i>"Keep it to yourself for now."</i>

391
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,608
<i>"Don't go out</i>
<i>telling the rest of the world."</i>

392
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,154
<i>"We got other interviews, other witnesses.</i>
<i>We're out looking for the gun."</i>

393
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,616
<i>[Michelle] They cornered them</i>
<i>in a school parking lot.</i>

394
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,037
<i>Thirteen officers</i>

395
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,417
{\an8}<i>And then, you wouldn't believe,</i>
<i>but one of the officers, Michael Brelo,</i>

396
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,962
{\an8}<i>uh, just like all of 'em,</i>
<i>he said that he was scared.</i>

397
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,505
{\an8}<i>I… I don't buy it.</i>

398
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,383
<i>I don't believe he was afraid</i>
<i>and so scared,</i>

399
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,510
<i>more scared</i>
<i>than he'd ever been in his life,</i>

400
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,429
<i>when he jumped up on top of the car.</i>

401
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,183
<i>He jumped up on the hood of the car.</i>

402
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,936
<i>[reporter 5] </i>Brelo fired his gun 49 times,

403
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,940

<i>-I'm sorry.</i>
<i>-You're fine.</i>

408
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,166
<i>I've never been so afraid in my life,</i>

409
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,043
<i>and I just couldn't understand</i>

410
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,630
<i>why the suspects were moving</i>
<i>and still shooting at us.</i>

411
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,677
<i>If he thought they had a gun,</i>

412
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,138
<i>he shouldn't have never</i>
<i>jumped on top of the car.</i>

413
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,349
<i>[Michelle] Right. He'd have</i>
<i>been afraid of getting shot.</i>

414
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:16,353
<i>If I was scared, I would've been running.</i>
<i>I'd be running the opposite way.</i>

415
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,397
<i>Or you would think, if you jump up there,</i>

416
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,066
<i>one of your fellow officers</i>
<i>might shoot you by mistake.</i>

417
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,489
{\an8}<i>As soon as we pulled up,</i>
<i>we started hearing shots going off.</i>

418
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:32,077
<i>I turned and fired two rounds,</i>

419
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,870
<i>and then I stopped firing</i>

420
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:37,165
<i>because I saw somebody</i>
<i>jump on the hood of the car.</i>

421
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,670
<i>We'll back up a little bit here.</i>
<i>We'll go over some details now.</i>

<i>-Okay?</i>
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

423
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,548
<i>Okay.</i>

424
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,133
<i>Did you see what they were doing?</i>

425
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,261
<i>Yes. They were shooting down into the car.</i>

426
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,933
<i>At some point,</i>
<i>did you jump on the suspects' vehicle?</i>

427
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,521
<i>I have no recollection if I did, sir.</i>
<i>Absolutely none.</i>

428
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:04,067
<i>[man 2] You said later on you found out</i>
<i>who was up on the hood of the car.</i>

<i>-How did you find that out?</i>

430

<i>Um…</i>

431
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,823
<i>Because he was talking about it.</i>

432
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,367
<i>He was talking about it? Who was that?</i>

433
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,618
<i>Mike Brelo.</i>

434
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,912
<i>I don't recall that, sir.</i>

435
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,249
<i>The shoe prints that were</i>
<i>on the top of the suspect vehicle</i>

436
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,834
<i>match your shoe prints.</i>

437
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,252
<i>If… I…</i>

438
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,379
<i>No. I was so in fear of my life.</i>

439
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,674
<i>I mean, I have no recollection</i>
<i>of how I got there, sir.</i>

440
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:33,305
<i>There was no logical explanation to give,</i>
<i>so he claimed he didn't recall.</i>

441
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,892
<i>But even if he didn't recall, in actuality</i>
<i>it didn't make any difference.</i>

442
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,728
<i>The physical evidence showed</i>
<i>he was standing on the hood.</i>

443
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,105
<i>His footprints were on the hood.</i>

444
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,609
<i>It was proven ballistically,</i>
<i>scientifically.</i>

445
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,068
<i>Not only the physical evidence</i>

446
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,864
<i>but the evidence of a police officer</i>
<i>from another police department.</i>

447
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,784

00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:04,185
<i>[Frazier] Is that fair that Black parents</i>
<i>have to tell their kids, in America,</i>

622
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,729
<i>"Be careful</i>
<i>'cause there's somebody out to hurt you."</i>

623
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,190
<i>That "You must be held</i>
<i>to another standard."</i>

624
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,317
<i>"You must carry yourself in another way."</i>

625
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,904
<i>"Because you're Black,</i>
<i>you can get shot real easy."</i>

626
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,865
<i>Is that a fair way to run a country?</i>

627
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,037
<i>[Loomis] I am the president of</i>

628
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,164
<i>the Cleveland Police</i>
<i>Patrolmen's Association.</i>

629
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:31,712
<i>And what we do is we make sure</i>
<i>that the members of the police department</i>

630
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,258
{\an8}<i>are defended</i>
<i>if they're accused of something.</i>

631
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,554
<i>You're old enough to understand</i>
<i>why a police department</i>

632
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,305
<i>is important to the city, right?</i>

633
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,058
<i>You know, you can't</i>
<i>have criminals running the street.</i>

634
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,643
<i>You can't have people doing…</i>

635
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:49,105
<i>We're a society of laws and rules,</i>
<i>just like you have here in the school.</i>

636
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,442
<i>You think it's fair that someone</i>
<i>comes in your yard and takes your bike?</i>

637
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,527
<i>[kids] No.</i>

638
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,444
<i>[Loomis] No.</i>

639
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,572
<i>[woman 7] Makes you</i>
<i>a little angry, doesn't it?</i>

640
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,032
<i>Don't you think</i>
<i>they should be held accountable?</i>

641
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,160
<i>It's all about accountability.</i>

642
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,413
<i>You know? Make sure people</i>
<i>are held accountable for their actions.</i>

643
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:10,168
<i>[Loomis] Any question that you have.</i>
<i>Any question that you have,</i>

644
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,337
<i>Lisa and I will answer</i>
<i>as honestly as we can.</i>

645
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,179
<i>Somebody's gotta have a question.</i>
<i>Any topic.</i>

646
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,765
<i>[woman 7] I know it'll come up,</i>

<i>Tamir.</i>

648
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,311
<i>Tamir was at the park.</i>

649
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:33,900
<i>He's doing wrong. I mean,</i>
<i>it's clear on video that, in my opinion…</i>

650
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,986
<i>If you want to play cops and robbers,</i>
<i>you should play it in your own yard,</i>

651
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,989
<i>not at the park</i>
<i>where people are gonna panic. Right?</i>

652
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,282
<i>But…</i>

653
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,619
<i>[Frazier] The job of the police union</i>
<i>is to protect the rights of police.</i>

654
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:48,998
<i>And I'm a…</i>
<i>I'm a union man in a union town.</i>

655
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:53,461
<i>Where it goes off the rail</i>
<i>is that they protect wrongdoing.</i>

656
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,463
<i>[woman 7] …and you know you're doing it.</i>

657
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,882
<i>[Frazier] It's obvious what's on the tape,</i>

658
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:02,637
<i>but you will get people coming in saying,</i>
<i>"You didn't see what you thought you saw."</i>

659
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,431
<i>It's like, "Do you wanna believe me</i>
<i>or your lying eyes?"</i>

660
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,515
<i>Exactly. Yeah, exactly.</i>

661
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,767
<i>[woman 7] ... for the gun.</i>

662
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,560
<i>[Loomis] Yes, ma'am.</i>

663
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,062
<i>Some of our students have concerns</i>

664
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:15,274
<i>that it's an us-versus-them</i>
<i>type deal with the police.</i>

665
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,276
<i>Citizens versus officers.</i>

666
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,489
<i>[Loomis] Um…</i>
<i>Yeah, I… I pray that you don't have that,</i>

667
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,784
<i>and I can tell you, without doubt,</i>
<i>that that's not what it is.</i>

668
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,410
<i>We're part of the community.</i>

669
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,412
<i>We're out here.</i>
<i>We're out here for you guys.</i>

670
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,539
<i>We have deep concerns</i>
<i>about some of the stuff</i>

671
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,333
<i>that we see going on out here,</i>

672
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,210
<i>and we're out here</i>
<i>trying to make it better.</i>

673
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,586
<i>So it's not us against them.</i>

674
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,882
<i>And if we don't do everything in our power</i>
<i>to fight against this false…</i>

675
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,218
<i>I'll call it a false narrative</i>
<i>that's out there</i>

676
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,428
<i>because that's not the truth.</i>

677
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,349
<i>Every cop in a beat</i>

678
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:52,770
<i>should know the kids on his beat.</i>

679
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,398
<i>Now, you haven't got to know</i>
<i>five- and six-year-olds,</i>

680
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:59,986
<i>but every teenager,</i>
<i>you know, 12, 13, 14-year-old.</i>

681
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,655
<i>The cops should have pulled up and said,</i>

682
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,782
<i>"Hey, Tamir. What are you doing?"</i>

683
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:08,869
<i>He should have known the kid,</i>
<i>and… and Tamir should have known him.</i>

684
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,205
<i>That's true community policing.</i>

685
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,623
<i>But here's the thing.</i>

686
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,501
<i>That's not the type of policing</i>

687
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:19,297
<i>that people</i>
<i>like the police union's president…</i>

688
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,675
<i>He said, "Our guys don't believe</i>
<i>in community policing."</i>

689
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:26,178
<i>Well… And that cuts</i>
<i>to the heart of the matter.</i>

00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,700
{\an8}<i>[Alfredo] Down at Bishop Cosgrove</i>

778
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,244
{\an8}<i>is a homeless place</i>
<i>where they feed people.</i>

779
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,704
<i>They give 'em housing.</i>

780
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,457
<i>Cops, they're always around there</i>
<i>in plain clothes.</i>

781
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,460
<i>They be jumping on the homeless,</i>
<i>planting stuff on 'em.</i>

782
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:12,006
<i>Stems, rocks, all that crazy crap, man.</i>

783
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,341
<i>Just some dirty cops.</i>

784
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:19,430
<i>[Ebony Hall] </i>Do you know what?
I know Malissa wanted to get high.

785
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:23,183
<i>And when I see Malissa</i>
<i>getting in the back seat,</i>

786
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,352
<i>I said, "Malissa, get out that car."</i>

787
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:31,108
<i>And then that's when I've seen Jordan.</i>
<i>He came around.</i>

788
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,778
<i>[Fishbourne]</i>
Malissa came out and went to call my name.

789
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,489
<i>I said, "Don't call my name</i>
<i>in front of Jordan."</i>

790
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,200
<i>"He's the type</i>
<i>that like to beat the homeless."</i>

791
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,493
<i>"That's his MO."</i>

792
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,996
<i>[Jordan] Everybody over there,</i>
<i>they know me.</i>

793
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,081
<i>You know, they know Jordan.</i>

794
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,167
<i>So I pulled behind the car.</i>

795
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,504
{\an8}<i>I saw the car was taking off,</i>

796
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,840
{\an8}<i>so I said, "Okay, let me follow 'em,</i>

797
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:58,927
<i>to see if I get</i>
<i>any probable cause to stop."</i>

798
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,889
<i>So he turned on 18th and St. Clair.</i>

799
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,476
<i>He didn't use his blinker,</i>
<i>so I was like, "I got him."</i>

800
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,440
<i>It was this undercover cop</i>
<i>that initially tried to stop them.</i>

801
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,942
<i>[McGinty] It was over</i>
<i>a turn-signal violation.</i>

802
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,570
<i>That's what the chase was all about.</i>

803
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,655
<i>[Jordan] I'm by myself.</i>

804
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,865
<i>I open my doors, and I tell the driver,</i>

805
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,367
<i>"Let me see your hands."</i>

806
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,871
<i>It was two people. So I was…</i>
<i>He was like this.</i>

807
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:29,792
<i>Then the passenger just turned around.</i>
<i>Then she just started screaming.</i>

808
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:34,797
<i>Like, "Officer, why you stopping me?</i>
<i>Why you stop us? We didn't do anything."</i>

809
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,507
<i>So I saw something in her hand.</i>

810
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,802
<i>It looked like</i>
<i>it was silver and red maybe.</i>

811
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,638
<i>But she was just doing like…</i>
<i>I was like, "Man."</i>

812
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,891
<i>"I'm not gonna go up to this car.</i>
<i>I don't have no vest on."</i>

813
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,434
<i>"And she acting crazy."</i>

814
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:51,355
<i>Got back in the car,</i>
<i>turned my overheads off.</i>

815
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,065
<i>Took off. They took off.</i>

816
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,860
<i>[Michelle] We don't know</i>
<i>what happened in that initial stop.</i>

817
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:00,864
<i>We don't know, but they took off</i>
<i>like their lives were in jeopardy.</i>

818
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,243
<i>That's why they were</i>
<i>speeding by the police department</i>

819
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,577
<i>where the backfire took place.</i>

820
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,204
<i>[engine accelerates]</i>

821
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,122
<i>[loud bang]</i>

822
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:14,461
<i>I think Timothy was protecting her,</i>
<i>trying to get her away from the cops</i>

823
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,547
<i>'cause they've been messing with Malissa.</i>

824
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,424
<i>Everybody had told us that.</i>

825
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,134
<i>And Timothy was protecting her</i>

826
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,678
<i>because they was peekin' with her</i>
<i>two days ago.</i>

827
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,514
<i>They've been peekin' with the homeless,</i>
<i>the shelter people, all day long</i>

828
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,392
<i>'cause they think they not nothing.</i>
<i>They are somebody.</i>

829
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,978
<i>And they need to be protected</i>
<i>from them cops down there.</i>

830
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,020
<i>[crowd clapping]</i>

831
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:35,149
<i>[reporter 15] Security cameras</i>
<i>caught Russell and Williams</i>

832
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,818
<i>being pulled over</i>
<i>by a Cleveland police officer.</i>

833
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:41,196
{\an8}<i>Investigators asked him</i>
<i>about pulling them over.</i>

834
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,657
{\an8}<i>He apparently told them,</i>
<i>on at least two occasions,</i>

835
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,867
{\an8}<i>that had never happened.</i>

836
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,911
{\an8}<i>So then they showed him the video tape.</i>

837
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,456
{\an8}<i>Then the officer said, yes,</i>
<i>he did pull them over.</i>

838
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,959
{\an8}<i>Now, why did he lie to investigators?</i>
<i>That, we don't know.</i>

839
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,464
<i>See, it's a lot wasn't told</i>

840
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,383
<i>at this… at trial.</i>

841
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,888
<i>[bailiff] Sir, please raise your hand.</i>

842
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:09,683
<i>Do you solemnly swear</i>
<i>to testify to the truth, so help you God?</i>

843
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,018
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>
<i>-[bailiff] Thank you.</i>

844
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,771
<i>Kindly have a seat here.</i>
<i>Please speak into the microphone.</i>

845
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,939
<i>[O'Donnell] Could you</i>
<i>please state your full name</i>

846
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,858
<i>and spell your last name for the record?</i>

847
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,278
<i>John Jordan. Last name is J-O-R-D-A-N.</i>

848
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,782
<i>[Alfredo] This cop, he's a Black cop.</i>

849
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:30,245
<i>Malissa was beaten up by the same cop.</i>

850
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:37,085
<i>Well, the first officer wasn't on trial,</i>
<i>but he did not follow the rules either.</i>

851
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,173
<i>In the first place,</i>
<i>are you allowed, in the unmarked car,</i>

852
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,008
<i>to make a traffic stop?</i>

853
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,428
<i>It's not a written rule,</i>

854
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:51,099
<i>but if they do a traffic stop</i>
<i>in front of you, you can stop the car.</i>

855
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:56,480
<i>[McGinty] If he would have done his job,</i>
<i>the chase wouldn't have happened.</i>

856
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:00,526
<i>But to charge him would have been</i>
<i>the only police officer,</i>

857
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,903
<i>Black police officer,</i>
<i>really involved in the case.</i>

858
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,406
<i>[Schultz] The thing that</i>
<i>Officer John Jordan does illustrate</i>

859
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,327
<i>is that there was a culture</i>
<i>of not abiding by the rules.</i>

860
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,621
<i>That there are too many moments</i>

861
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:15,249
<i>where they decided</i>
<i>that their own personal judgment</i>

862
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:18,710
<i>was better than what protocol</i>
<i>was put into place for them to follow.</i>

863
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:23,423
<i>[Gutierrez] All right, so when did you</i>
<i>find out that the car that you pulled over</i>

864
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,426
<i>was the one being chased</i>
<i>by the police that night?</i>

865
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,846
<i>On the news the next morning.</i>

866
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,931
{\an8}<i>[Gutierrez] And, sir,</i>
<i>when you went to the station,</i>

867
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,350
{\an8}<i>and everybody knew</i>
<i>that you had been involved,</i>

868
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,644
{\an8}<i>did you get any grief</i>
<i>from the other officers?</i>

869
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,104
<i>A little.</i>

870
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,981
<i>[Gutierrez] What was</i>
<i>the nature of that grief?</i>

871
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,650
<i>What I shouldn't have did,</i>
<i>or what I should have did.</i>

872
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:44,069
<i>[Gutierrez]</i>
<i>And how do you feel about that?</i>

873
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,073
<i>Took it on the chin, but I felt sad.</i>

874
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,952
<i>Feel sad now.</i>

875
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,747
<i>[Michelle] Most people respect officers</i>
<i>and believe they're credible</i>

876
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,458
<i>and they're gonna be</i>
<i>forthcoming and honest,</i>

877
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:03,088
<i>but now it's being shown</i>
<i>that these officers are lying.</i>

878
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:07,968
<i>And then they all went in the depositions</i>
<i>and said the exact same thing?</i>

879
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,429
<i>"Oh, I was so scared.</i>
<i>I never been so scared in my life."</i>

880
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,097
<i>They all said it the same way.</i>

881
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,934
<i>What was your, uh, state of mind</i>
<i>as you were on the scene?</i>

882
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,520
<i>I was scared shitless. [chuckles]</i>

883
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,481
<i>I was in fear of my life.</i>
<i>I was in fear of my partner's life.</i>

884
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,609
<i>-And were you afraid?</i>
<i>-I was.</i>

885
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,570
<i>Anything you think we need to know</i>
<i>that we didn't ask you?</i>

886
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,532
<i>-Nothing I can think of.</i>
<i>-No? Okay.</i>

887
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,662
<i>-Scared to death?</i>
<i>-Scared, yeah. Definitely scared.</i>

888
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,290
<i>This is something more</i>

889
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:42,502
<i>than just Brelo shooting at them</i>
<i>and getting on the car incident.</i>

890
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:46,173
<i>It's a cultural thing</i>
<i>within the Cleveland Police Department.</i>

891
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,507
<i>The blue wall.</i>

892
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,718
<i>Nobody in that police department</i>

893
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,512
<i>is gonna come forward</i>
<i>and say what actually really happened.</i>

894
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,726
<i>[O'Donnell] State your full name</i>
<i>and spell your last name for the record.</i>

895
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:02,397
<i>[Demchak] It's Michael Demchak.</i>
<i>D as in Dan, E-M-C-H-A-K.</i>

896
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,943
{\an8}<i>[Gutierrez] Were you working</i>
<i>on the night of November 29th, 2012?</i>

897
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,736
{\an8}<i>-Yes, I was.</i>
<i>-[Gutierrez] Okay.</i>

898
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:14,576
<i>Did there come a point in time</i>
<i>where you were involved in the pursuit?</i>

899
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:20,290
<i>On advice of my counsel,</i>
<i>I am invoking my right to remain silent.</i>

900
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,088
<i>[Gutierrez] Judge,</i>
<i>we believe at this point in time,</i>

901
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:29,508
<i>this is exactly what the State</i>
<i>has been talking about, the blue wall.</i>

902
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:31,760
<i>This individual will not come and testify.</i>

903
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:35,639
<i>He's a police officer.</i>
<i>His loyalty should be to the citizens of…</i>

904
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,641
<i>We were trying to make a point.</i>

905
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,602
<i>Whether it was legitimate or not,</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

906
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,313
<i>But police officers have</i>
<i>their Fifth Amendment rights.</i>

907
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,148
<i>Simple as that. Just like we do.</i>

908
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,359
<i>-…I'll tell you that. Jim.</i>
<i>-Well…</i>

909
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:51,446
{\an8}<i>If I may, I would just like to object</i>
<i>to Mr. Gutierrez's remarks</i>

910
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,991
<i>and move that they be stricken,</i>
<i>relative to blue wall</i>

911
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:57,327
<i>and setting up this argument</i>
<i>in the midst of this trial.</i>

912
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,413
<i>[O'Donnell] Noted.</i>

913
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,874
<i>Now, my boss, Mr. McGinty</i>
<i>didn't like that, but…</i>

914
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,211
<i>As the County Prosecutor,</i>
<i>can I make a statement?</i>

915
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,547
<i>I haven't said a word in this trial,</i>
<i>I'd like to now.</i>

916
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,508
<i>Your ruling will result</i>
<i>in all police officers,</i>

917
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,968
<i>and then all witnesses,</i>

918
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,804
<i>if you're thinking,</i>
<i>as you're espousing now, follow,</i>

919
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:19,016
<i>then all witnesses</i>
<i>will demand immunity before they come in.</i>

920
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,561
<i>It won't end with this.</i>
<i>It will end with every police officer.</i>

921
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:26,231
<i>We need his testimony in this trial.</i>
<i>We're asking for his testimony.</i>

922
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:29,401
<i>We're asking for the truth.</i>
<i>That is his duty as a police officer.</i>

923
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,863
{\an8}<i>If their requests</i>

924
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,324
{\an8}<i>to assert the Fifth are granted,</i>

925
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:40,120
{\an8}<i>how can you say that will result</i>
<i>in all witnesses in every case</i>

926
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,205
{\an8}<i>being able to assert the Fifth?</i>

927
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,665
{\an8}<i>[McGinty] Well, you watch it, Judge.</i>

00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,084
<i>Watch every single police officer</i>
<i>from this point want the Fifth.</i>

929
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,294
<i>We've already had two others.</i>

930
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,755
<i>I've never seen this</i>
<i>in 40 years around here.</i>

931

<i>on an investigation</i>

933
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,302
<i>who jumped up on a hood…</i>

934
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,679
<i>Every one of 'em knows it's wrong,</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

935
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:01,058
<i>Jump up on a hood</i>
<i>and clip two people in a car, unarmed.</i>

936
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,602
<i>They knew, from that moment it happened,</i>
<i>they were in trouble.</i>

937
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,272
<i>They knew it, from the dispatcher</i>
<i>to the police at the scene.</i>

938
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,816
<i>And they didn't tell people.</i>
<i>This has been our whole argument.</i>

939
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,653
<i>They didn't tell the investigators</i>
<i>until it was forced on 'em.</i>

940

<i>[Loomis] This whole thing</i>

<i>I asked Prosecutor McGinty. I says,</i>
<i>"Who are you tap-dancing for here?"</i>

942
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:28,585
{\an8}<i>Your, uh, request to the court now,</i>
<i>Mr. Gutierrez,</i>

943
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,630
{\an8}<i>is to order him to answer the question?</i>

944
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:34,091
<i>-Correct, Your Honor.</i>
<i>-Right. I decline.</i>

945
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,217
<i>Uh…</i>

946
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:36,885
<i>Okay.</i>

947
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:40,555
<i>Uh, thank you.</i>
<i>You're welcome to depart at this point.</i>

948
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,723
<i>-Okay, thank you.</i>

949
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,685
<i>[McGinty] You tell the truth.</i>
<i>That's what a good police officer does.</i>

950
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,021
<i>Even if it's against</i>
<i>another police officer.</i>

951
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:52,025
<i>It made them look like</i>
<i>they operate on a double standard.</i>

952
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,779
<i>If it's a policeman being accused,</i>
<i>they won't cooperate,</i>

953
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:59,157
<i>and they refuse to do their duty</i>
<i>and tell the truth and testify.</i>

954
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,702
<i>The Fifth Amendment was simply a cover.</i>

955
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,747
<i>[suspenseful music playing]</i>

956
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,507
<i>[Richard Bell] Your Honor, the State</i>

<i>five supervisors, uh,</i>
<i>one after another, at this point.</i>

958
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,265
<i>Each of them will be invoking</i>
<i>their Fifth Amendment rights, Your Honor.</i>

959
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,186
<i>[O'Donnell] Well, I will say this then.</i>

960
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,939
<i>I see all of them present</i>
<i>with their lawyers.</i>

961
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:34,317
<i>-Mr. Spellacy, you represent Coleman?</i>
<i>-That's correct, Judge.</i>

962
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,486
<i>-[O'Donnell] And she is present?</i>
<i>-She is, Your Honor.</i>

963
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,197
<i>[O'Donnell] If she were called</i>
<i>to the stand, would she testify?</i>

964
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,908
<i>Judge, she would exercise</i>
<i>her Fifth Amendment right.</i>

965
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,494
<i>[O'Donnell] Is that</i>
<i>a sufficient record for you, Mr. Bell?</i>

966
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,579
<i>[Bell] Yes, Your Honor.</i>

967
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:51,001
<i>[O'Donnell] Ms. Gragel, uh,</i>
<i>you represent Mr. Donegan?</i>

968
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,002
<i>I do, Your Honor.</i>

969
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,795
<i>[O'Donnell] I see he is present.</i>
<i>Am I right?</i>

970
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:54,754
<i>Yes.</i>

971
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,215
<i>[O'Donnell] If he were called</i>
<i>to the stand, would he testify?</i>

972
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,551
<i>He would not. He would assert</i>
<i>his Fifth Amendment right.</i>

973
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:02,345
<i>-[O'Donnell] Sufficient record, Mr. Bell?</i>
<i>-Yes, Your Honor. Thank you.</i>

974
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,348
<i>[O'Donnell] If Mr. Dailey were</i>
<i>called to the stand, would he testify?</i>

975
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,726
<i>No, Your Honor.</i>
<i>He'd use his Fifth Amendment right.</i>

976
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:11,396
<i>[O'Donnell]</i>
<i>Mr. D'Angelo or Mack or Shaughnessy,</i>

977
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:15,734
<i>do you think something else should be done</i>
<i>to make an adequate record?</i>

978
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:17,903
<i>No, Your Honor.</i>

979
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,322
<i>[O'Donnell] Thank you.</i>
<i>For the moment, we're off the record.</i>

980
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,615
<i>So we'll stay off the record…</i>

981
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,491
<i>[McGinty] It is a shameful day</i>

982
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:28,038
<i>when police officers involved in a case</i>

983
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:31,416
<i>step up on the stand</i>
<i>and take the Fifth Amendment,</i>

984
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:32,876
<i>refuse to cooperate.</i>

985
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,795
<i>[Schultz] Just think about that.</i>

986
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,381
<i>Police officers</i>
<i>are at the scene of the crime.</i>

987
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,467
<i>You want to be able to count on them</i>

988
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,302
<i>to give their accounts</i>
<i>of what they witnessed,</i>

989
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:46,806
<i>and one after another after another</i>
<i>pleads the Fifth.</i>

990
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,518
<i>You look at that and think,</i>
<i>"The only reason you don't talk</i>

991
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:54,064
<i>is because you don't</i>
<i>want us to know what happened."</i>

992
00:53:56,775 --> 00:54:00,070
<i>[McGinty] But this was more than just</i>
<i>police out of control that night.</i>

993
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,488
<i>It was a criminal act.</i>

994
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,199
<i>When this individual</i>
<i>jumped on the hood of a car,</i>

995
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:07,702
<i>at the point of cease-fire,</i>
<i>after these 100-odd shots were fired</i>

996
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,162
<i>and everybody else stopped,</i>

997
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,374
<i>he gave the </i>coup de grâce
<i>to these two unarmed individuals,</i>

998
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,876
<i>which he knew by then were unarmed.</i>

999
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,462
<i>You don't stand there</i>
<i>with your testicles exposed</i>

1000
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:21,466
<i>on top of a car</i>
<i>if you think they're armed.</i>

1001
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:23,468
<i>He was there to make sure they were dead.</i>

1002
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,971
<i>They were by the time he was finished.</i>

1003
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,766
<i>[Gutierrez] Where'd you grow up?</i>

1004
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,768
<i>[Sabolik] I grew up</i>
<i>in the West Park neighborhood.</i>

1005
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,645
<i>-High school?</i>
<i>-Saint Ignatius.</i>

1006
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:37,107
{\an8}<i>[McGinty] Finally, one of the officers</i>
<i>came forward, under oath.</i>

1007
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:40,443
<i>He basically was the one</i>
<i>who was the first to admit</i>

1008
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,737
<i>that Brelo had jumped up on the hood.</i>

1009
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,241
<i>[Gutierrez] So when you see</i>
<i>this individual on the hood,</i>

1010
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,785
<i>and you were about to fire,</i>

1011
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:53,123
{\an8}<i>you stop firing, but your testimony is</i>
<i>gunshots are still ringing out?</i>

1012
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,499
<i>[Sabolik] As far as I remember.</i>

1013
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,544
<i>Could you demonstrate</i>
<i>to the court what you saw?</i>

1014
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:58,628
<i>Um…</i>

1015
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,465
<i>He was standing on the hood,</i>
<i>firing down, like so.</i>

1016
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,010
<i>[Gutierrez] Could you please</i>
<i>point him out for the court?</i>

1017
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:07,470
<i>[Sabolik]</i>
<i>Uh, he's sitting right over there.</i>

1018
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,222
<i>[Gutierrez] Okay, wait a second.</i>

1019
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,975
<i>-Stipulate ID?</i>
<i>-[lawyer] Sure.</i>

1020
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,810
<i>[Gutierrez] Thank you. Thank you, officer.</i>

1021
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,855
{\an8}<i>-You were in a shoot-out, right?</i>
<i>-[Sabolik] Correct.</i>

1022
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,606
{\an8}<i>And in your heart of hearts,</i>

1023
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:22,485
<i>you felt that you were being shot at</i>
<i>by the folks in that car.</i>

1024
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,486
<i>[Sabolik] Uh…</i>

1025
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,905
<i>Right at that point</i>
<i>when we pulled into the parking lot--</i>

1026
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:30,327
<i>-[Shaughnessy] Yeah, how did you feel?</i>
<i>-The scaredest I've ever been in my life.</i>

1027
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,286
<i>[Shaughnessy] Okay.</i>

1028
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:34,998
<i>You saw</i>

1029
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,501
<i>an officer on the hood of the Malibu.</i>

1030
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,711
<i>-Correct?</i>
<i>-[Sabolik] Correct.</i>

1031
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,713
{\an8}<i>[Shaughnessy] You stopped firing</i>

1032
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,090
{\an8}<i>because you didn't wanna hit</i>
<i>another officer</i>

1033
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,801
<i>who had a different tactical position.</i>
<i>Correct?</i>

1034
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,346
<i>Correct. I still perceived a threat.</i>

1035
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:53,892
<i>You continued to perceive a threat</i>
<i>to yourself and fellow officers</i>

1036
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:56,644
<i>while you observed</i>
<i>that officer on the hood.</i>

1037
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,896
<i>[Sabolik] Correct, sir.</i>

1038
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,814
<i>[Gutierrez]</i>
<i>You're trying to tell us right now,</i>

1039
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:03,151
<i>even though somebody's shooting</i>
<i>multiple times in that windshield,</i>

1040
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,903
<i>you still perceive a threat?</i>

1041
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:06,529
<i>Absolutely, I--</i>

1042
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,865
<i>[Gutierrez] You don't think</i>
<i>these people are dead by then?</i>

1043
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,283
<i>I have no idea.</i>

1044
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,536
<i>So somebody shooting multiple times</i>
<i>inside a windshield,</i>

1045
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,872
<i>you're trying to tell us</i>
<i>you still perceive a threat?</i>

00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:03,146
<i>[Schultz] There's a part of you</i>

1081
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,439
<i>the story that's different,</i>

1082
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:08,109
<i>that this is the moment, perhaps,</i>
<i>we are starting to turn that corner.</i>

1083
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,028
<i>Perhaps we're going to believe it,</i>

1084
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,697
<i>that sometimes police officers</i>
<i>can behave very badly.</i>

1085
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,826
<i>[O'Donnell] Additionally,</i>
<i>Brelo was acting in conditions</i>

1086
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,288
<i>difficult for even</i>
<i>experienced police officers to imagine.</i>

1087
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,583
<i>He described it as,</i>
<i>"Worse than being under attack</i>

1088
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:27,212
<i>from rockets and mortars</i>
<i>while serving as a marine in Iraq."</i>

1089
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:32,717
<i>So I reject the claim</i>
<i>that 12 seconds after the shooting began,</i>

1090
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,428
<i>it was patently clear from the perspective</i>

1091
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:39,933
<i>of a reasonable police officer</i>
<i>in Brelo's position</i>

1092
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,976
<i>that the threat had been stopped,</i>

1093
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:46,147
<i>and therefore find</i>
<i>that Brelo's entire use of deadly force</i>

1094
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:49,734
<i>was a constitutionally reasonable response</i>

1095
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:55,198
{\an8}<i>to an objectively, reasonably perceived</i>
<i>threat of great bodily harm.</i>

1096
00:58:56,658 --> 00:59:00,828
<i>I therefore find the defendant not guilty</i>
<i>of counts one and two, as indicted,</i>

1097
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,414
<i>and the defendant is discharged.</i>

01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:12,301
{\an8}<i>[Simone] And I can't describe fear to you.</i>

1234
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,221
<i>Until we're reversed…</i>

1235
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,138
<i>[indistinct yelling]</i>

1236
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,683
{\an8}<i>[Simone] …and you're the person</i>
<i>that's scared out of your mind.</i>

1237
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:19,892
<i>Don't move or I'll kill you!</i>

1238
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,686
{\an8}<i>The fear is overwhelming sometimes.</i>

1239
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,771
<i>[gunfire]</i>

1240
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,900
<i>[officer 11] </i>{\an8}Jimmy. Oh, God damn it.

1241
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:31,570
<i>-I don't know.</i>
{\an8}-<i>Get him in the car. In the car.</i>

1242
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,906
{\an8}<i>-Hold on. Are you hit?</i>
<i>-Hang on.</i>

1243
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,451
{\an8}<i>His gun was empty.</i>
<i>He didn't have the ability to kill me.</i>

1244
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:41,747
<i>So they ruled that a homicide</i>
<i>because we took his life in a viol--</i>

1245
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,125
<i>But it's not.</i>
<i>It should have been ruled suicide.</i>

1246
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,087
<i>[male caller]</i> In the heat of the moment,
I think what happened

1247
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,756
<i>was a genuine, honest mistake.</i>

1248
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,260
<i>I don't think that those officers</i>
<i>came into that situation</i>

1249
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,095
<i>to get blood on their hands.</i>

1250
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,015
<i>They were probably scared,</i>
<i>and with what had happened--</i>

1251
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,267
<i>Well, let me…</i>
<i>Let me tell you something, Derek.</i>

1252
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,103
<i>-If they're scared, get another job.</i>
<i>-[Mitchell] Straight like that.</i>

1253
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:07,231
<i>Yeah, if you're so scared,</i>
<i>you gotta pull your gun</i>

1254
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,482
<i>and be trigger-happy,</i>

1255
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:11,068
<i>then maybe patrolling</i>
<i>the streets of Cleveland</i>

1256
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,820
<i>is not where you should be.</i>

1257

<i>[man 9] Thanks, Chief.</i>

1258
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:20,077
<i>[Frazier] We have to be careful</i>
<i>who we give a badge and a gun to.</i>

1259
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:23,539
<i>And I think we have to check</i>
<i>at every stage of their career.</i>

1260
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:28,294
{\an8}<i>You know,</i>
<i>we have this super cop, Jim Simone.</i>

1261
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:31,213
<i>At some point you would think,</i>
<i>"Wait a minute, Jim."</i>

1262
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,258
<i>"You keep running into situations</i>
<i>where you gotta shoot somebody."</i>

1263
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:37,303
<i>"Maybe we should take you off the street</i>
<i>for the public safety."</i>

1264
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:38,971
<i>Oh no. They thought he was a hero.</i>

1265
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:45,227
<i>Today, May 26, 2015,</i>

1266
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:48,272
{\an8}<i>marks a new way of policing</i>
<i>in the city of Cleveland,</i>

1267
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:52,359
{\an8}<i>one built on a strong foundation</i>
<i>of progressive change,</i>

1268
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:55,112
<i>sustained trust and accountability.</i>

1269
01:07:57,948 --> 01:08:01,035
<i>The Department of Justice comes in</i>
<i>and tells the City of Cleveland,</i>

1270
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:02,745
<i>"You fix this or we will."</i>

1271
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:04,872
<i>"Because if you don't,</i>
<i>we're gonna sue you."</i>

1272
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:07,374
<i>[reporter 23]</i>
{\an8}The new 105-page Consent Decree

1273
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:10,211
<i>calls for the department</i>
<i>to retrain and review its officers</i>,

1274
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:12,463
<i>to make sure they use force properly.</i>

1275
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,548
<i>[applause]</i>

1276
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:21,555
<i>As you know, we're here to talk</i>
<i>about police use-of-force policies,</i>

1277
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:22,932
<i>and we need your input.</i>

1278
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:26,143
<i>We can't do business</i>
<i>the way we did 20 years ago,</i>

1279
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,187
{\an8}<i>and I think the chiefs around this country</i>

1280
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,981
{\an8}<i>and the officers around</i>
<i>this country are kinda, you know,</i>

1281
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:33,567
<i>in the quiet time</i>
<i>they have with themselves, are saying,</i>

1282
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:36,570
<i>"Yeah, we shouldn't have did that,</i>
<i>and we're not gonna do that again."</i>

1283
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:38,572
{\an8}<i>So things are changing.</i>

1284
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,032
{\an8}<i>I've kinda told my guys,</i>

1285
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:43,077
<i>"We're gonna give people</i>
<i>the benefit of the doubt."</i>

1286
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,622
<i>Next on the agenda is, um,</i>

1287
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:50,501
<i>an update on the citizen's</i>
<i>police review board ordinance.</i>

1288
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:54,713
<i>We do understand that there's not</i>
<i>a formal diversity and inclusion plan</i>

1289
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,507
<i>for the Cleveland Division of Police,</i>

1290
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:59,510
<i>but we've been asking</i>
<i>for documents or information</i>

1291
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:02,680
<i>associated with the recruitment policy</i>
<i>for months now.</i>

1292
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:05,182
{\an8}<i>In the African American community,</i>

1293
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:08,686
<i>people feel like they aren't treated</i>
<i>with respect and dignity</i>

1294
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:10,521
<i>in their own communities.</i>

1295
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:15,317
<i>Good evening, everyone.</i>
<i>My name is Pierre Napier.</i>

1296
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,236
<i>I am the co-founder</i>

1297
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:21,866
<i>of the New Black Democratic Party</i>
<i>of Cuyahoga County.</i>

1298
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:25,494
<i>137 bullets strong.</i>

1299
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:30,166
<i>The United States of America</i>
<i>is at war with itself.</i>

1300
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:32,585
<i>Cleveland is</i>
<i>one of the most racist cities--</i>

1301
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,628
<i>[man 10] All right. Well, that… Please.</i>

1302
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:40,259
<i>When Timothy and Malissa</i>
<i>got shot and killed 137 times,</i>

1303
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:44,513
<i>the head of the Cleveland police union</i>
<i>said, "Good kill."</i>

1304
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:48,017
<i>So, come on. What's wrong</i>
<i>with the words of Pierre Napier?</i>

1305
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:54,607
<i>[Williams] If you're thinking it's made up</i>

1309
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:07,828
<i>In the 1960s,</i>
<i>we had the Freedom Movement here.</i>

1310
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:10,956
<i>We had Black Power politics here.</i>

<i>[siren blaring]</i>

1312
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,002

<i>[gunshots]</i>

1314
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:22,801
<i>Three of 'em ran into a shoot-out</i>
<i>with two Sixth District policemen,</i>

1315

<i>and they came out second best.</i>

1316
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,640
<i>[news announcer] </i>On July 18th,
rioting broke out in Hough.

1317
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:30,601
<i>It took only a simple matter</i>
<i>to spark the outbreak.</i>

1318
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:33,520
<i>A white bar owner</i>
<i>had refused a Negro man's request</i>

<i>for a glass of water.</i>

1320
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,858
<i>[Williams] We had Martin Luther King</i>
<i>coming through here.</i>

1321
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:40,277
<i>[Dr. King] Like many</i>
<i>of our nation's cities,</i>

1322
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:42,404
<i>we find Cleveland</i>

1323
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,657
<i>a teeming cauldron of hostility,</i>

1324
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:48,535
<i>with crude methods of police repression,</i>

1325
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,872
<i>rather than compassion</i>
<i>and creative programming.</i>

1326
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:55,501
<i>[Williams] We also had</i>
<i>one of the first African American mayors</i>

1327
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,753
<i>in the entire nation, Carl Stokes.</i>

1328
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,422
{\an8}<i>This election today</i>

1329

<i>[loud cheers]</i>

1333
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:15,938
<i>[Williams] And one of the things</i>
<i>that he wanted to do</i>

1334
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,398
<i>was to reform the police.</i>

1335
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:19,775
<i>This was one of his mandates.</i>

1336
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:24,530
<i>In his political autobiography,</i>
<i>Stokes says,</i>

1337
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:26,532
<i>in a chapter called "The Police,"</i>

1338
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:30,494
{\an8}<i>"Ask yourself why the cries</i>
<i>for law and order</i>

1339
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:31,954
{\an8}<i>come from conservative whites,</i>

1340
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:35,291
<i>most of whom live safely in the suburbs."</i>

1341
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:38,043
<i>"The very people</i>
<i>who are least affected by crime</i>

1342
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,004
<i>are the most vocal about it."</i>

1343
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:44,133
<i>"The Black community</i>
<i>pleads for police protection,</i>

1344
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:46,635
<i>and what it gets is indifference,</i>

1345
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:51,807
<i>or patrols by men looking for</i>
<i>an excuse to get violent themselves."</i>

1346
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:56,020
<i>"I saw it as</i>
<i>one of my most important tasks,</i>

1347
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:57,396
<i>the reform of the police."</i>

1348
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:03,861
<i>"This great hope</i>
<i>became my greatest frustration,</i>

1349
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:06,280
<i>my greatest failure."</i>

1350
01:12:06,363 --> 01:12:10,451
<i>He talks about how he was not able</i>
<i>to make a dent in the culture</i>

<i>of policing here in Cleveland, Ohio.</i>

1352
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:18,208
<i>And the Consent Decree</i>
<i>is talking about some of the same things.</i>

1353
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:21,253
<i>Police accountability. Use of force.</i>

1354
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:24,965

<i>It was the most horrific feeling</i>
<i>that I ever felt, walking in a room.</i>

1380

<i>I felt like he had already poisoned them</i>

1381
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:54,847
<i>Well, obviously, I can't.</i>

1382

1383
01:13:57,808 --> 01:14:00,394
<i>But at the end of the day,</i>
<i>I know the police officers feel</i>

1384

1387
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,487
<i>[Subodh Chandra]</i>
<i>The way that McGinty and his assistants</i>

1388
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:14,199
<i>approached the grand jury was so biased.</i>

1389
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,743
{\an8}<i>McGinty did something</i>
<i>that I can guarantee you</i>

1390
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:19,538
{\an8}<i>no prosecutor in America ever does,</i>

1391
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:23,167
{\an8}<i>which is to permit</i>
<i>the targets of a criminal investigation,</i>

1392
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,919
<i>which is what</i>
<i>these two police officers were,</i>

1393
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:28,297
<i>permit them to come to the grand jury,</i>

1394
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:31,425
<i>read previously written</i>
<i>self-serving statements,</i>

1395
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:34,219
<i>and then leaving</i>
<i>without answering a single question.</i>

1396
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:38,182
<i>No cross-examination from the prosecutors,</i>
<i>no questions from the grand jury.</i>

1397
01:14:38,265 --> 01:14:39,641
<i>Just read and leave.</i>

1398
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,811
<i>[Gutierrez] What did</i>
<i>the police officers know at that point?</i>

1399
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:47,441
<i>There is a man with a gun at a rec center.</i>

1400
01:14:47,524 --> 01:14:50,903
<i>Do you know there were over 100 people</i>
<i>in that rec center at that point in time?</i>

1401
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:53,906
<i>So you have a potential active shooter,</i>

1402
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,450
<i>so police officers say, "Code red."</i>

1403
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:57,951
<i>They're gonna come in hot.</i>

1404
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:01,705
<i>If he was a man with evil intentions,</i>
<i>in our day and age,</i>

1405
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:05,167
<i>to go in and shoot people up,</i>
<i>that's not a bad assumption, is it?</i>

1406
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:09,922
<i>We are here for the interview</i>
<i>of Officer Timothy Loehmann.</i>

1407
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:12,132
{\an8}<i>I started screaming verbal commands.</i>

1408
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:14,885
{\an8}<i>"Put your hands in the air!</i>
<i>Let me see your hands! Freeze!</i>

1409
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:16,220
{\an8}<i>Put your hands in the air!"</i>

1410
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:18,096
{\an8}<i>I said numerous times out loud.</i>

1411
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,808
<i>And I presented my gun, you know,</i>
<i>through the window, so--</i>

1412
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:23,435
<i>[man 11] Is your window down?</i>

1413
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:27,773
<i>It was closed, I believe.</i>
<i>Not 100%. I believe it was closed.</i>

1414
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:29,733
<i>[Chandra] An example.</i>

1415
01:15:29,816 --> 01:15:32,778
<i>"When exactly was it, sir,</i>
<i>that you were shouting out commands?"</i>

1416
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:34,238
<i>"Show me on the video."</i>

1417
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:36,740
{\an8}<i>Or, "Officer Loehmann,</i>
<i>are you in the habit</i>

1418
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:39,576
{\an8}<i>of shouting out commands</i>
<i>through a closed window</i>

1419
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:43,247
{\an8}<i>while driving forward at a rapid speed</i>
<i>toward someone who can't hear you?"</i>

1420
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,164
<i>"Is that normal?"</i>

1421
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:47,334
<i>How do we know this happened?</i>
<i>Grand jury proceedings are secret.</i>

1422
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:49,127
<i>Because the union said so.</i>

1423
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:54,800
<i>Officer Garmback and Officer Loehmann</i>
<i>gave a written statement.</i>

1424
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:56,510
<i>They didn't answer any questions</i>

1425
01:15:56,593 --> 01:16:01,265
<i>because they are the targets</i>
<i>of whatever it is that's going on here.</i>

1426
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:02,182
<i>[panting]</i>

1427
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:03,517
<i>[Chandra] You can't do that.</i>

1428
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,270
<i>You can't put the Fifth Amendment genie</i>
<i>back in the bottle</i>

1429
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:09,147
<i>once you've taken the oath</i>
<i>and started testifying.</i>

1430
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:12,818
<i>So the bottom line is</i>
<i>that Prosecutor McGinty and his assistants</i>

1431
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:18,240
<i>took a dive on cross-examining</i>
<i>the targets of a criminal investigation.</i>

1432
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:19,741
<i>And I can guarantee you,</i>

1433
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:22,661
<i>that special privilege</i>
<i>is only afforded to you</i>

1434
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:25,247
<i>if you are a Cleveland police officer</i>

1435
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:29,001

1436
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,336
<i>[reporter 26]</i> New information this morning

1437
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,505
<i>about the officers</i>
<i>involved in the Rice shooting.</i>

1438
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,592
<i>[reporter 27] </i>Loehmann's previous
police supervisors had wanted to fire him,

1439
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:41,763
<i>citing insubordination, lying,</i>
<i>and an inability to emotionally function.</i>

1440
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:44,891
<i>Timothy Loehmann shouldn't</i>
<i>have never been a police officer.</i>

1441
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:48,270
<i>He was crying on the gun range.</i>
<i>His mama had to come and get him.</i>

1442
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:50,856
<i>He was crying over his girlfriend. Um…</i>

1443
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:53,734
<i>How did you become</i>
<i>a Cleveland police officer?</i>

1444
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:58,196
<i>[reporter 28]</i> Cleveland Police never asked
to see Loehmann's personnel records.

1445
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,950
<i>That's how he slid through the cracks,</i>
<i>and now I have a dead son.</i>

1446
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,285
<i>You understand?</i>

1447
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:05,287
<i>[panting]</i>

1448
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:08,665
<i>I had to, you know, make the decision fast</i>

1449
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:12,336
<i>because Frank and I</i>
<i>were in immediate danger.</i>

1450
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:15,047
<i>-[man 12] So you thought what?</i>
<i>-I thought I was gonna die.</i>

1451
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,887
<i>[Schultz] McGinty knew…</i>

1452
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,932
<i>When he spoke out the way he did</i>
<i>during the Brelo trial,</i>

1453
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:29,519
<i>he knew that could have</i>
<i>political consequences.</i>

1454
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:30,729
<i>The question was</i>

1455
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:33,357
<i>how would he conduct himself</i>
<i>moving forward,</i>

1456
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,942
<i>and I guess we got our answer.</i>

1457
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:39,237
<i>[breathing heavily]</i>

1458
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:47,621
{\an8}<i>Today a Cuyahoga County grand jury</i>
<i>completed its thorough investigation</i>

1459

<i>of the fatal shooting</i>
<i>of the 12-year-old Tamir Rice.</i>

1460
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,085
<i>Based on the evidence</i>

1461
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:56,797
<i>and the law as it applies</i>
<i>to police use of deadly force,</i>

1462
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,300

<i>The outcome will not cheer anyone,</i>
<i>nor should it.</i>

1465

<i>Every time I think about this case,</i>
<i>I cannot help</i>

1466
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:16,525

<i>charged in the shooting deaths…</i>

1474
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:51,268
<i>[Williams] What can I think as a citizen?</i>
<i>What can I think as a community member?</i>

1475
01:18:51,351 --> 01:18:56,898
<i>There was enough probable cause</i>
<i>to say there was a crime committed</i>

1476
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:59,401
<i>in the slaying of Tamir Rice.</i>

1477
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,781
<i>Even in the Michael Brelo case,</i>

1478
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,659
<i>there were 12 other officers</i>
<i>who were on the scene.</i>

1479
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:11,997
<i>He was the most egregious,</i>
<i>but he was one of 13.</i>

1480
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:24,509
<i>Some may say that Prosecutor McGinty</i>
<i>aggressively prosecuted that case.</i>

1481
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:28,346
<i>There are many in the community that said</i>
<i>he did the absolute minimum he could do.</i>

1482
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,224
<i>That there was no justice there.</i>

1483
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:35,437
<i>[man on megaphone]</i>
<i>McGinty went into the grand jury</i>

<i>[crowd cheers]</i>

1488

<i>[male caller 2]</i> For the life of me,

<i>[Frazier] Well, hold on. Hold on. Hold on.</i>

<i>We're also here</i>

1495
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:06,718

<i>and he said, "Where's your brother?"</i>

<i>from the greatest intellectual</i>
<i>ever produced in the American empire,</i>

1699

<i>the greatest scholar ever produced</i>
<i>in American democracy.</i>

1700

<i>His name was W. E. B. Du Bois.</i>

1701
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:16,471
<i>And Du Bois says every generation</i>
<i>has to deal with four questions.</i>

1702
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:24,937
{\an8}<i>The first question is:</i>
<i>how shall integrity face oppression?</i>

{\an8}<i>[applause]</i>

1704

<i>-[applause]</i>
<i>-Amen.</i>

1708
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:41,579
<i>[West] And the second question is:</i>
<i>how shall honesty</i>

1709
01:31:42,663 --> 01:31:44,207
<i>meet deception?</i>

1710
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:49,504

01:40:04,206 --> 01:40:07,960
<i>[Robert Kennedy] When you teach a man</i>
<i>to hate and to fear his brother,</i>

1851
01:40:09,461 --> 01:40:12,881
<i>when you teach that he is a lesser man</i>
<i>because of his color,</i>

1852
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:18,095
{\an8}<i>then you also learn to confront others</i>

1853
01:40:18,178 --> 01:40:21,181
{\an8}<i>not as fellow citizens but as enemies,</i>

1854
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:25,561
{\an8}<i>to be met not with cooperation</i>
<i>but with conquest.</i>

1855
01:40:28,772 --> 01:40:33,027
{\an8}<i>The question is whether we can find,</i>
<i>in our own midst and in our own hearts,</i>

1856
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:36,280
{\an8}<i>that leadership of humane purpose</i>

1857
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:40,159
<i>that will recognize</i>
<i>the terrible truth of our existence.</i>

1858
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:44,496
<i>We must admit</i>
<i>the vanity of our false distinctions</i>

1859
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:48,167
<i>and learn to find our own advancement</i>

1860
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:52,629
<i>in search for the advancement of all.</i>

1861
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:21,366
<i>[Frazier] </i>{\an8}See, I believe change is coming.

1862
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:25,662
{\an8}<i>I think that the genie</i>
<i>is out of the bottle on police brutality.</i>

1863
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:30,000
<i>It is a call-in show,</i>
<i>and we got Paul on the line.</i>

1864
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:31,293
<i>[Paul] </i>Yeah. Hi, Mansfield.

1865
01:41:31,376 --> 01:41:32,211
<i>[Frazier]</i> How are you?

1866
01:41:32,294 --> 01:41:37,174
<i>[Paul] </i>Yes, this is the best radio show
in Cleveland bar none.

1867
01:41:37,257 --> 01:41:39,134
<i>[Frazier]</i> Well, your check
is in the mail, Paul.

1868
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:40,719
<i>I always like for you to say that.</i>

1869
01:41:40,803 --> 01:41:43,055
<i>-[Paul] </i>Thank you. You do good work.
<i>-[Mitchell laughing]</i>
