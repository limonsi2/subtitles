THE NORTH POLE

5
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,958
Hello to you all! This is Elf FM.

6
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,208
Today is the toughest day of the year.

7
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:25,750
It's a nice -32 degrees Celsius
outside with some heavy snowfall.

8
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,416
Have a good one! Ho, ho, ho!

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,708
EARTH

10
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,875
Start production!

11
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:07,541
Nice ride, Albert!

12
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,750
Tooth Fairy gave me a good price.

13
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,541
She snatched coins from a bank every week.

14
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,541
Automatic, 120 reindeer power.

15
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:20,208
-Heated seats.
-And winter runners.

16
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,291
SANTA

17
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,541
DAWID AND THE ELVES

18
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:59,291
Here we have Charlie Chaplin
who got a bowler hat.

19
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:03,916
A few years later,
he became a famous actor.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,708
Here is the young Alfred Nobel.

21
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:13,583
He got matches, and a few years later
he discovered dynamite.

22
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,125
-What's Santa's wife called?
-Merry Christmas.

23
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,208
You could have said you didn't know.

24
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,375
Yay, kids!

25
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,166
Albert!

26
00:02:55,958 --> 00:03:00,833
-Who do you want to be when you grow up?
-The best elf in the world.

27
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,416
Like you.

28
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,500
-Why not Santa?
-That makes no economic sense.

29
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,916
He flies around, gives tons of gifts,

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,083
-but no one believes in him.
-You've got a point.

31
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,708
Let me tell you a secret.

32
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,375
I don't want to be Santa either.
You know why?

33
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,500
No.

34
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,125
-Do you know why?
-No!

35
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,625
Have you ever talked to Mrs. Claus?

36
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,958
Who wants Alfred the Elf T-shirts?

37
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,500
Me!

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,833
TATRA MOUNTAINS

39
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,916
All shepherds flock to Bethlehem…

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,833
-Isn't that too high?
-We can go lower.

41
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,916
But you don't have to sing.
You're horrible at it.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,750
Really horrible.

43
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,666
What are you doing, Piotrek?

44
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,791
Hey!

45
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,125
Not so loud!

46
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,625
Carolers should sing,

47
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,666
not roar like wild animals.

48
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,791
You forgot you were young once.

49
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,416
Kazik…

50
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,208
Come here, Dawid.
Sing Grandpa a Christmas carol.

51
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,583
I can't, we're chasing a reindeer.

52
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,166
-Dad gets in the way.
-Where's the reindeer?

53
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,458
He's invisible. Magical.

54
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,541
How will you get by in Warsaw, honey?

55
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,583
Mom, it's really not that far.

56
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:41,625
-Dawid is so happy here.
-I know, but he needs to evolve.

57
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,833
They have great schools,
cultural institutions there.

58
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:48,916
-We only have one cinema here.
-But it's so beautiful here.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,708
-The air is fresh. What more do you want?
-The closest opera is in Cracow.

60
00:04:56,541 --> 00:05:00,000
-Maybe he'll finally grow up.
-He's only ten.

61
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,416
I wasn't talking about Dawid.

62
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,583
I'm Kōshirō Wakabayashi the Elf.

63
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:20,166
Ladies and gentlemen,
It looks like this year,

64
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,083
for the fifth time in a row,
our employee of the year is

65
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,083
Albert the Elf!

66
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,833
What's your secret?
Why is your Christmas spirit so strong?

67
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:36,458
I'd like to take this opportunity
to thank all my fans and people on Earth.

68
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:40,916
Knowing you love and admire me
gives me so much power!

69
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,083
I'm sorry, Albert.

70
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,083
This is a bit awkward, but…

71
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,458
People don't watch our TV channel.

72
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,208
They don't?

73
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,416
That's their loss.
I'll just say, this is not my last word.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,125
Good luck.

75
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,000
How did I do?

76
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,458
That wasn't all true.

77
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,125
All of that is your doing.

78
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,541
I wanted to sound modest.

79
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,333
You really do love yourself.

80
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:19,041
Don't be jealous of me.

81
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,166
I think about people every day.

82
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:29,125
"Santa's Helper's Crazy Adventures."
Are you kidding me?

83
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:32,166
Great book. Exciting, beautiful pictures.

84
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,333
I read the whole thing. You should too.

85
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,041
Piotrek…

86
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,916
He believes in all this crap.

87
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,333
Kids will laugh at him.
It'll be your fault.

88
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,166
It's not crap. And it'll be Santa's fault.

89
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,375
I'm just wrapping the gift.

90
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,666
Wait till you see yours.

91
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,291
-I'm scared already.
-As you should be.

92
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,958
Could I please, just this once,

93
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,166
get a bad gift, like other women?

94
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,083
A cherry stoner,

95
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,958
a pair of man's socks…

96
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,375
The Christmas spirit won't allow it.

97
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,750
-Will it allow this?
-Hell, yeah.

98
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:14,541
New York is snowed-under.
Careful over the Caribbeans, hurricanes.

99
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:18,541
Thanks to global warming,
there is no snow in Europe this year,

100
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,375
except in the mountains,
Mazuria and Suwałki.

101
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,625
Atmospheric pressure normal.

102
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:28,083
Belief in the magic of Christmas
in children under 10, stable.

103
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,333
Only 90% power?

104
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,625
You know what these counters are good for?

105
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,833
I miss the old Swiss ones.

106
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,583
Attention!

107
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,416
Stop ringing, it's so annoying!

108
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,750
-Look at this…
-Boss!

109
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,291
-Boss, stop.
-What is it?

110
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,458
-Ouch! What are you doing?
-A black hair.

111
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:02,458
-What if someone saw it?
-How? I'm invisible.

112
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,250
-All right.
-Ho, ho, ho, boss.

113
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,791
We checked the chassis.

114
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,083
Filled the reindeer with biofuel.

115
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,666
Comet has dandruff.
And Rudolph hates the new shoes.

116
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,291
He'll break them in.

117
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,041
-Anything else?
-Albert…

118
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,000
-Clausey?
-Irrelevant.

119
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,416
Clausey!

120
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:29,416
Wait, honey, not so fast.
You forgot your second dinner.

121
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,708
-I won't have time to eat.
-Eat it.

122
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,000
Celery, steamed broccoli.

123
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:37,625
And absolutely no fast foods.
Keep an eye on him, Albert.

124
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:38,750
Sure, boss.

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,708
Be careful out there.

126
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,458
Both of you.

127
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,958
My elves!

128
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,083
Ho, ho, ho!

129
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,375
Ho, ho, ho!

130
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,958
Let's go.

131
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,041
Merry Christmas!

132
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,500
Merry Christmas to you too!

133
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,916
Hi, girls!

134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,541
My wish for you, Kasiula,

135
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,166
is that you and Maciek get along.

136
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,916
I know you're angry with him,
but he is a bull.

137
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,041
You can't cheat nature.

138
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,416
Grandpa,

139
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,583
will animals be talking tonight?

140
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,625
Of course, they always do.

141
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,583
After the midnight mass,

142
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,583
Kasiula and I will have a chat.

143
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,166
-What will she say?
-Always the same thing.

144
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,625
She needs to move to the city.
The opera is too far.

145
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:35,875
Very funny.

146
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,166
She wouldn't say such a silly thing.

147
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,583
She's fine here. Right, Kasiula?

148
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,625
Come on!
Grandma says pierogi are getting cold.

149
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,208
-We're coming.
-Wonderful.

150
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,500
What do you wish for, my child?

151
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,416
I don't know.
I wish Piotrek would lose that hat.

152
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,375
-Dad?
-What is it?

153
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,833
Do you think Santa brought the gifts yet?

154
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,583
I'm sure of it.

155
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,333
Wait. Can you hear it?

156
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,833
Bells.

157
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,541
Santa's invisible sleigh
is still there, see?

158
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
They really are invisible!

159
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,708
Look. Rudolph is first. Then Donner.

160
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,458
And Comet. Santa is sitting in the sleigh.

161
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,625
Who's holding the reigns? An elf?

162
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,666
Albert the Elf!

163
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,041
Yes, that's Albert!

164
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,083
Merry Christmas!

165
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,125
Ho, ho, ho!

166
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,125
What are you doing?

167
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,791
People can't see us.

168
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,208
So why are they waving?

169
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,000
Maybe they're just
stretching their wrists.

170
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,625
Let's go.

171
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,541
All shepherds flock to Bethlehem

172
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:14,625
To play for the baby a sweet melody

173
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:18,666
Glory be in high Heaven

174
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,583
And peace down on Earth

175
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:26,833
Glory be in high Heaven

176
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,416
And peace

177
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,625
Down on Earth

178
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,708
Bravo!

179
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,875
Good job, kids.

180
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,083
Bravo!

181
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,583
Let's sit down.

182
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,958
No, no.

183
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,000
This is a place for a lost wanderer.

184
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,250
-He never comes anyway.
-You never know.

185
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,750
Come here, Dawid.

186
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,250
Come.

187
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:53,541
This is actually a place for the dead.

188
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,958
Stop it, Piotrek.

189
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,291
-They always come.
-That's right.

190
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,791
Look, there's auntie Aurelia.

191
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,583
I met uncle Kornel in the hall.

192
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,000
-Me too!
-Mom!

193
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,083
And who's sitting
behind the tree, as usual?

194
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,083
Old Mrs. Popielak!

195
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,791
Stop saying these things
in front of the kids.

196
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,625
He'll have nightmares.

197
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,791
-And so will I.
-No, you don't.

198
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:20,416
Let it to all be known

199
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,083
That the Child of God is born

200
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,000
In Bethlehem

201
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,000
In Bethlehem

202
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,541
Merry Christmas!

203
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,666
Thank you!

204
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,666
Here's your lost wanderer.

205
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,500
-Sit down, Mietek.
-Anka, Piotrek.

206
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:42,375
-Is it true what people are saying?
-It is.

207
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,708
-We'll be at Wilanów by Epiphany.
-In Wilanów.

208
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,250
An old elf
offered me a job in his law firm,

209
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,250
how could I say no?

210
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,958
-I got a job offer too, right?
-Right.

211
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,791
I'm sad to see you go,

212
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,750
-but congratulations are in order.
-Thank you.

213
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:03,416
-Next year, Christmas in Warsaw?
-That's right.

214
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,916
-Absolutely.
-I'm not sure we'll all fit in there…

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,041
Of course we will.

216
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,791
-Sit down with us, Mietek.
-I can't.

217
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,375
Four other families are waiting for me.

218
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:19,083
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas, Mietek!

219
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,166
Thank you.

220
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,666
-Let's eat, everyone.
-Wait a second.

221
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,583
Not so fast.

222
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,458
-Any good kids around?
-Me!

223
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,000
-What did you do there?
-Where?

224
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,250
You know, where. In the mountains.

225
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,250
I didn't do anything.

226
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:44,333
Don't you ever do that again, Albert.

227
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,583
Go, Rudolph! Go, Comet!

228
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,333
-You got a big one.
-No wonder.

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,708
There is something for Dawid, too.

230
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,791
Where is the book?

231
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,083
Albert the Elf!

232
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,833
Cool.

233
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,541
-It's great.
-Did you change the gift?

234
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:22,916
You got Santa.

235
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,333
I didn't. Must've been Santa.

236
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,166
-Very funny.
-It was magic.

237
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,083
WARSAW, ONE YEAR LATER

238
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,916
A cherry stoner, just like you wanted.

239
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,291
FOR MY BELOVED HANIA

240
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,541
-Yes, boss?
-How are you doing?

241
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,416
-Are the pierogi ready?
-Actually…

242
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Great.

243
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,583
Christmas is no joke, that's for sure.

244
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,958
-But that's not why I'm calling.
-Yes?

245
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,166
The presentation starts at noon.

246
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,291
This could be your big break.

247
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,833
Bye now.

248
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,125
Bloody sparrows!

249
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,291
Darn it!

250
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,708
What are you doing?

251
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,791
Leave my lunette alone!

252
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,541
Boss, real talk.

253
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,750
Why can't we talk to people?

254
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,916
People are tricky.
You never know what they come up with.

255
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,666
People love us.
We give them gifts, they send us letters.

256
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,125
Have you ever met a human? I have.

257
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,458
WARSAW, POLAND, 2004

258
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:26,250
You bring them gifts,
and they call you horrible names.

259
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,791
Thief! Everyone! There's a thief there!

260
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,333
Thief!

261
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,500
NYC, USA, 1992

262
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,166
It can be dangerous.
For people, of course.

263
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,541
For me, it's mostly embarrassing.

264
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,416
BERLIN, GERMANY, 1923

265
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,416
Every time someone sees me on the roof,
I always hear the same thing.

266
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,958
Thief!

267
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,375
There is something magical…

268
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,458
FROMBORK, POLAND, 1428

269
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,416
…about putting gifts under the tree.

270
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,750
But sometimes the situation
can change very quickly.

271
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,916
I got you, bastard!

272
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,166
Why are you in my daughter's chambers?

273
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,083
I'll let you have it!

274
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,208
Trust me. We're lucky we have our magic.

275
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,083
TIJUANA, MEXICO, 1963

276
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,000
No matter where and when.

277
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,875
It's always the same.

278
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,958
Thief!

279
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,125
PARIS, FRANCE, 1931

280
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,500
My biggest disappointment was Emilia.

281
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,916
Merry Christmas, my dear Emilie!

282
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,500
She seemed like a lovely kid.

283
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,416
I know it's been a few years.

284
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,958
80 years.

285
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,583
But a vase?

286
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,583
People love me.

287
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,000
-You?
-Everyone was waving at me.

288
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,708
It was just two guys.
And they weren't waving at you.

289
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:57,750
The sleigh is invisible.
How many times do I have to tell you?

290
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,041
So why were they waving at the sky?

291
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,833
If they didn't see us, they wouldn't wave.

292
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,125
I'm not talking to you.

293
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,458
For the smartest elf here,
you can be really dumb.

294
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,250
Go to sleep. Christmas is coming.

295
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,250
We'll have a lot to do in the morning.
Goodnight.

296
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,583
Ho, ho, ho, boss.

297
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,583
Hey there, sweetie. What's wrong?

298
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,291
Warsaw doesn't even have snow.

299
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,708
Listen, when I was your age,

300
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:40,916
I could only dream
about a house like this.

301
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,500
About a living room like this. I had to…

302
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,833
Herd the sheep.

303
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,125
Herd the rams.

304
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,416
Milk cows.

305
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,458
Chop tons of firewood.

306
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:59,625
I had to walk 5 km to school.
Even in winter.

307
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,458
That's it. And there were no buses.

308
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,875
Don't you like anything here?

309
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,791
I do like one thing.

310
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,541
What?

311
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,625
We're closer to the opera.

312
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Since we're talking,

313
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:29,583
I ordered your king costume
for the Nativity play.

314
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,541
-Do you know who's making it?
-I do.

315
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,000
Exactly.

316
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,916
The magic tailor.

317
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,791
The best royal costumes specialist
in this part of the world.

318
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:43,333
He dressed King Matt the First himself.

319
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,333
-Everyone knows that.
-Really?

320
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,791
-That's great.
-Of course it's great!

321
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,500
Maybe you're ill?

322
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,333
-I'm not, mom.
-Let me see.

323
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,750
Come, we'll check your temperature.

324
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,250
I'll check yours, too.

325
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,083
Ho, ho, ho, Albert.

326
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,208
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

327
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:21,541
I can see it's not nothing.
Why do you look so down?

328
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,666
I'm an elf, that's how I look.

329
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,708
Why are we doing all this, Erwin?

330
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,666
-I don't understand.
-Neither do I.

331
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,958
And neither does Santa.

332
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,208
He talks about the magic of Christmas,

333
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:44,250
but he never celebrated it,
he's just running around with that bag.

334
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,583
You're at 62%.

335
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,041
Must be broken.

336
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,125
My life is broken,
so how can I have any power?

337
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,041
What do you mean, how?

338
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,583
We love people,

339
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,083
we give them gifts, they love us back,

340
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,916
the magic of Christmas is born,
and that's where…

341
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,166
How can people love me
if they never saw me?

342
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,750
I've been working day and night.

343
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,166
What are you talking about?

344
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,083
We only work once a year, on Christmas…

345
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,166
That's the one day of the year
I'm talking about!

346
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,666
Even if you don't work all year,
this should be a holiday!

347
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,708
That's what Christmas is all about.
Not working at all.

348
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:44,958
It's a holiday.

349
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,208
Come. We'll have some Christmas borscht.

350
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,750
Come.
We'll talk about the olden day elves.

351
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:57,125
Or get some pierogi
and watch "Home Alone."

352
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,333
-Come on.
-No way.

353
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,041
-I'm leaving.
-What?

354
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,041
Now? Where will you go?

355
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:09,083
To charge my batteries.
Feel the power of a real Christmas.

356
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,583
But…

357
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,083
Where are you going?

358
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,791
Where people wave at me.

359
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,416
Move.

360
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,666
Pass the ball, Michał.

361
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,000
Catch.

362
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Hey, new guy!

363
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,083
Catch!

364
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,375
He's so touchy.

365
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,333
Boss.

366
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,250
Boss.

367
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:11,125
What is it?

368
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,708
What?

369
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,791
Spit it out!

370
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,000
It's about Albert.

371
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,958
What about him?

372
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,916
He ran away.

373
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,833
Not ran away, exactly.

374
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,000
He decided it's a holiday.

375
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,958
I mean, he didn't decide that, he just…

376
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:33,083
He went to meet the people?

377
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,875
CHRISTMAS TREES

378
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,416
Hi there!

379
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:09,958
What happened?

380
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,416
Bye now.

381
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,791
Ho, ho, ho. I see you recognize me.

382
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,916
You look like Albert the Elf, sir.

383
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,000
That's right.

384
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,166
You can call me Albert. Come on.

385
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,875
-Show me around.
-Excuse me!

386
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,583
Me?

387
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:43,916
-My truck!
-That's right.

388
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:47,416
Looks exactly like a truck.

389
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It was a smashing hit in 2015.

390
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:52,958
People would do anything
to get it for Christmas.

391
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,250
-But where's my truck?
-Right here.

392
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:57,625
On the house.

393
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,791
How about a Christmas hug?

394
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,583
Sure.

395
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:06,083
Merry Christmas!

396
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:08,166
Why are you so silent?

397
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,666
Sir, can you pinch me?

398
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,666
Sure. But you promised to call me Albert.

399
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:17,625
Ouch!

400
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:20,416
-Was it a good pinch?
-It hurt a little.

401
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,041
I've never pinched anyone before.
I must have a gift for it.

402
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,833
His power was down. That happens.

403
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:31,916
-But why didn't he talk to me about it?
-What would you say?

404
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:35,416
-Work, work, work.
-That's right!

405
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,375
The more gifts we deliver,
the more power we have.

406
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:41,166
-That's how it works.
-Bollocks.

407
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,791
Excuse me?

408
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,541
Albert is young.
He wants to see the world.

409
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:47,791
Don't you get it?

410
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:51,416
-We're not invisible among people.
-So what?

411
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:55,666
If you want to lose the belly,
start exercising.

412
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,000
And quit the sweets. You're stress eating,

413
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,083
and then you're embarrassed to go out.

414
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:03,875
It's not about the belly!

415
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:06,166
I know what it's about, honey.

416
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:10,125
-People are afraid of us.
-No, Clausey.

417
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:14,500
You're afraid of people.
You sneak around at night, like a thief.

418
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:19,083
-It's tradition.
-Slipping into people's chimneys?

419
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:23,750
It isn't smart, or practical.
Not to mention your safety.

420
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:35,041
Rain instead of snow!

421
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:40,541
-I bet you missed me.
-A lot.

422
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,000
I've been thinking about you all year.

423
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,875
That's exactly how I imagined it.

424
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:52,333
You have to meet my dad.
He's your big fan.

425
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:55,166
I know. He was waving at me last year.

426
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,750
-You saw that?
-Sure, everyone waves at me.

427
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,166
But I remembered you and your dad.

428
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,791
-Because…
-Why did you remember me?

429
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,125
Because I have a great memory!

430
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,500
Santa thinks his sleigh is invisible.

431
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,625
-But you saw us.
-Dad showed me.

432
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:17,458
He sees things other people don't.

433
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:19,916
He feels magic in his nose and ear.

434
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,333
And in his heart. That's important, too.

435
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:26,541
He's a clever guy, your dad.
I'm starting to like him.

436
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:30,333
Sometimes mom
sees things others don't, too.

437
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:33,875
You're kidding me. Reindeer?

438
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:37,041
Not this kind of things.

439
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,291
A dirty cup or something.

440
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,291
-Hey, you! Stop!
-Ho, ho, ho!

441
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,666
-Run!
-My truck!

442
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,291
I'd love to race this guy.

443
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,083
-Catch me!
-Hey!

444
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,750
Hold this. Stop!

445
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:02,875
Come on! Catch me!

446
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,166
I'm gonna get you!

447
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:17,291
-Come on!
-I'll get you!

448
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,625
Oh, sweet Lord.

449
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,916
Faster!

450
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:43,291
Cold water makes your blood hotter!
Merry Christmas!

451
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:51,708
People's joy is my joy.
When they love me, my power goes up.

452
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:55,500
He can't work without his truck.

453
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:58,583
He shouldn't work on Christmas.

454
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:02,458
Tell that to my parents.
They work all the time.

455
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,208
I'm sorry.

456
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,916
Dad is calling me.

457
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,708
Good day, Your Royal Highness.

458
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:18,166
I just got a pigeon.

459
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:22,541
The garment is ready, Your Grace.

460
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,291
Thanks, dad.

461
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,875
But you're all alone.

462
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:29,041
I'm not alone. Albert the Elf is here.

463
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:32,791
Ho, ho, ho! He's my favorite elf.

464
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:37,250
Say hi to him from me.
I'm sure you two will have fun together.

465
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:40,958
-You'll tell me all about it later.
-Sure.

466
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,125
-Bye!
-Bye!

467
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:46,333
What a nice guy.
He barely knows me, but he likes me.

468
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,041
Dad showed me your sleigh in the sky.

469
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:53,833
-He did?
-He told me you were driving.

470
00:29:53,916 --> 00:30:00,083
I saw you too, but he saw you better.
He feels the magic of Christmas.

471
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,208
-In his ear.
-Exactly.

472
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:06,333
What's happening?

473
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:08,000
They're having fun.

474
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:13,291
-Nobody broke a vase on his head?
-It only happens to you, Clausey.

475
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:16,166
Because I'm the only one
interacting with people.

476
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,583
Is he hiding?

477
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
Something smells in here.

478
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,875
No, it doesn't.
Is he keeping a low profile?

479
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:28,208
He turned a truck into a toy
and shoes into a scooter.

480
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,750
He's out of his mind!

481
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,291
Elves are so boring and predictable.

482
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:45,208
-But I think you and I can be friends.
-Really?

483
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:46,625
If you want to.

484
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,291
I do!

485
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:52,125
When I waved at you last year,
and then got the figure…

486
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:53,875
-You have one?
-Sure.

487
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:56,458
I love figures of me, but I had no idea…

488
00:30:56,541 --> 00:31:00,125
I love it!
I would trade all my other toys for it.

489
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,166
-I even built a house for it.
-Do you want another one?

490
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,708
Sure.

491
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:08,416
Look!

492
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,291
That's the supersized version!

493
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:16,041
What is it? You don't like it?

494
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,125
Oh, boy. Mom's Christmas tree.

495
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:23,958
-You don't like it?
-It's all right.

496
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,625
All right? Just all right?

497
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,791
I wanted to say it's great.

498
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,875
Super cool.

499
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,583
But this is enough.

500
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:41,875
-You taught him that.
-Me?

501
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:44,416
You keep saying people like gifts.

502
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,875
Don't they?

503
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:48,333
I get so many letters!

504
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:50,958
-China alone…
-Do you ever write back?

505
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:54,625
"Hi, how are you doing?
Come by, the wife will bake a pie."

506
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:55,958
Which wife?

507
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:59,375
How many wives do you have?

508
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:07,958
I can't believe it!
You want to invite people here?

509
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:09,916
Why not?

510
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,500
Do you think a gift is enough?

511
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:14,875
A smartphone under the tree, done.

512
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:17,416
That's why Albert is doing the same thing.

513
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,375
I still feel that stench.

514
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:28,083
-Reindeer?
-Reindeer. That must be it.

515
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,458
Dawid.

516
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,375
We're friends.

517
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:33,791
Sure.

518
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,083
So don't be shy.

519
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:39,166
If you want to,
I'll fill the whole place with figures.

520
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,958
-Just say the word.
-That's really enough.

521
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:45,083
-You don't trust me.
-Of course I do.

522
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,833
You're the most brilliant elf
I've ever met.

523
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:56,333
I don't need a TV
to make dreams come true.

524
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:58,041
A peanut or a tangerine will do.

525
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,041
-We have tangerines.
-Great.

526
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:01,541
Lots of them.

527
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,625
Wait here, I'll bring some.

528
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:09,208
They'll be much better than the couch.

529
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:21,000
-Hi, mom.
-How are you, honey?

530
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,666
-Great.
-You're in a good mood.

531
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,083
I am. I had lots of adventures today.

532
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:29,791
-Do you feel good?
-Yeah.

533
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,666
Mom… Do you have any wishes?

534
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,291
-What kind of wishes?
-Any kind.

535
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:37,458
-Why?
-Just asking.

536
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:40,583
If, by any chance, I met an elf,

537
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:42,833
who could turn the Christmas tree…

538
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:46,333
-What happened to the tree?
-Nothing happened.

539
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:48,208
Sweetie, I'm begging you,

540
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,125
don't touch the tree or the decorations.

541
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:54,291
They're very expensive.
What if they fall on you?

542
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:57,166
Sure, mom. I have to go. Love you!

543
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:15,083
I just had to get them.

544
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,125
-The drums?
-Yeah.

545
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:21,833
-What did you use?
-A peanut. You should've seen it.

546
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:23,500
A peanut?

547
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,666
You're a genius.

548
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,083
I am.

549
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:32,166
Did you know your dad dreamed about drums?

550
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,416
Are you sure?

551
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,166
Absolutely. I checked Santa's records.

552
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:41,333
The last dream is classified,
Privacy Protection Act.

553
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:44,458
Are you sure it was my dad, and not some…

554
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:48,375
-You don't trust me!
-I do!

555
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:52,916
-I'm just worried that my mom…
-What about her?

556
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,291
Mom had to milk cows
and walk a long way to school.

557
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,333
Even in winter.

558
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:02,000
Now she wants dad to grow up.

559
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,750
Your mom is just saying that. Trust me.

560
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:08,583
-That's a gift for her.
-Thanks.

561
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:13,041
-What would you like to get?
-Nothing.

562
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,625
Not one gift?

563
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:19,125
I just need my Nativity play costume,

564
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:21,958
but dad and the magic tailor
took care of it.

565
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:26,083
My industry's worst nightmare.
Magic tailors and online shopping.

566
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,291
-How much is it?
-10 PLN.

567
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,500
That's a king's costume?

568
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:35,750
Hey!

569
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:39,333
-Give it back!
-How about…

570
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:42,375
-A snowflake!
-You take the bloody snowflake!

571
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:43,666
It's very versatile.

572
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:47,291
Versatile? Give it back. I saw it first.

573
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:51,416
-Please, I need it for my boy.
-I need it for mine.

574
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,166
-Let's talk about it.
-No.

575
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,666
-I'll pay!
-How much?

576
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,625
-How much do you want?
-50.

577
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:57,791
Okay.

578
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,166
-I only have a hundred.
-Fine.

579
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,666
Merry Christmas.

580
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,666
Sucker.

581
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:14,583
All shepherds flock to Bethlehem

582
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:17,958
To play for the baby a sweet melody

583
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:21,500
Glory be in high Heaven

584
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:24,458
And peace down on Earth

585
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:28,583
Glory be in high Heaven

586
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:32,125
And peace

587
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:34,125
Humbly they bowed…

588
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:37,708
-Why aren't you singing?
-This was my first carol.

589
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:41,541
-Third, you already know two.
-Right.

590
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:44,375
But you still have so many to learn.

591
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:46,708
On Christmas Eve, we sing all evening.

592
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:55,333
You made me realize that…

593
00:36:57,291 --> 00:37:00,708
-It's good to have people you care about.
-Stop it.

594
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:04,375
Now I feel I want to have
lots of people I care about!

595
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,666
-Lots of friends!
-Cool.

596
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:10,500
Exactly!
I'll give them gifts, and they'll love me.

597
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:12,250
Sure.

598
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,291
Okay, kiddo.

599
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,583
Be well.

600
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,875
And don't forget your friend.

601
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:25,541
When you think about me, my power rises.

602
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,291
I'll think about you.

603
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:31,250
Alright, I'm off.
Say hi to the parents from me.

604
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,375
You haven't changed one bit!

605
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,666
I'm sorry, I…

606
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,625
Don't be, just smile.
Do you want me to pinch you?

607
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:55,833
Ouch!

608
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:58,666
What are you doing in my house?
Selling something?

609
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,250
I just came by. Surprised? What is this?

610
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:04,125
Let go! I don't know you!

611
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:05,833
Don't you recognize me?

612
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:10,208
A year ago, in the mountains.
You looked at me, I looked at you…

613
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:13,791
I'm happily married.
This must be a mistake.

614
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,708
No, you were looking at me,
and then you waved, remember?

615
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:20,250
-I don't remember waving at…
-Listen.

616
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:26,083
Don't wear rubber band beards.

617
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:28,333
They slide down.

618
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:30,250
This is a private property.

619
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,541
Chill out, man.

620
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,625
Chill out. It's Christmas tomorrow.

621
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,958
Joy, magic. Look how pretty it is!

622
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:40,375
Get lost or I'll call security.

623
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:45,333
You're such a joker. Marry Christmas!

624
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:59,458
Dad! I met Albert the Elf!

625
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,458
-Who was that guy?
-Albert the Elf.

626
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:05,541
You let a stranger into the house?

627
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,666
I told you so many times…

628
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,250
You said that if a dwarf
or a reindeer comes by…

629
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,208
That was not a reindeer.

630
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:16,208
Or a dwarf. He was a stranger.

631
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:20,291
Some cheap mall copycat.
He could've been a thief, or worse.

632
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:24,333
He was an elf, I told you.

633
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,000
-Told me what?
-That I was with Albert.

634
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:29,708
You told me to say hi to him.

635
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:34,000
He magically made drums, just for you.

636
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,291
What?

637
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:41,208
-What is this?
-I told you.

638
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:45,375
-I met an elf and he magically made…
-No.

639
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:48,291
Simple question, simple answer.

640
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:52,166
what are these drums doing here?

641
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:57,375
You said you wanted drums.

642
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:59,833
When did I say that?

643
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:04,375
I don't know when,
but Santa has it all written down.

644
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:09,041
What about this clown?

645
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,833
It's the one from the box.

646
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:17,291
Make sure you show off
the gold earrings I bought you.

647
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,875
Hello.

648
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:23,500
Excuse me. We're taking a picture.

649
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:26,583
Let's do it. Nice print, Halinka.

650
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,166
-You know this guy?
-No.

651
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:32,833
-How does he know you?
-No idea.

652
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:36,458
-How do you know my wife?
-Mr. Claus and I came to your house.

653
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:40,541
You promised not to see Klaus again!

654
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:43,125
I didn't! He only came over once.

655
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,500
He'll be back tomorrow.

656
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,250
You yokel!

657
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:47,500
What are you doing?

658
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:48,958
It's out!

659
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:50,958
-I'm gonna get you!
-Calm down!

660
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:53,083
How can you not know Albert?

661
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:55,541
You waved at him last year!

662
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,125
-Me?
-Yes, you!

663
00:40:57,208 --> 00:41:01,000
You showed me Santa's sleigh in the sky
and said…

664
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,333
Dawid.

665
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:05,375
We're both upset. We shouldn't be.

666
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:08,916
Let's calm down.
Tell me, from the beginning, no lies.

667
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,333
How do you know this guy?

668
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,791
We saw him in the sky.

669
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,500
You saw him.

670
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:18,250
Today he fell from the sky

671
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:20,375
and walked in front of a truck,

672
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:23,083
which he, luckily,
turned into a small toy.

673
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:26,166
But the driver was furious anyway. And…

674
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,666
Where is the tree?

675
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:38,625
-Baśka?
-Justyna?

676
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:41,208
-I haven't seen you in ages.
-Call me.

677
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,833
I don't have your number.

678
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:46,166
Ho, ho, hello. Can I have your number?

679
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,833
-What for?
-We could be in touch.

680
00:41:48,916 --> 00:41:51,083
Feel some Christmas magic together.

681
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:54,250
Where I come from,
we do it the old fashioned way, but…

682
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:05,208
What did I say?

683
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:11,583
We have no other expenses,
so you decided to buy drums.

684
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:14,583
For the tenth time. I didn't buy them.

685
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:17,041
-A guy came by…
-Albert the Elf!

686
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:21,500
It looks like he took the tree
and left the drums.

687
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:22,666
Albert the Elf?

688
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,750
I know you dreamt about drums.

689
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,000
You really did?

690
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:29,625
-No, I didn't.
-Stop lying.

691
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:33,791
-Two years ago…
-I said I would play it when I retire!

692
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:35,500
All right.

693
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:38,333
So now you're retiring?

694
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:41,333
Listen, I can take anything

695
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:44,125
if you stop lying and tell me the truth.

696
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:47,708
-How much was it?
-I don't know.

697
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:51,083
-You had to sell the tree?
-I didn't sell it, I swear!

698
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:52,666
The elf made it.

699
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:56,916
He turned the tree into the statue
and a peanut into the drums.

700
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,666
-Because elves…
-Because your dad said so.

701
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,750
-I didn't.
-You did!

702
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:07,875
You said elves need something
to turn it into something else!

703
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:09,750
I don't know what happened.

704
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:13,958
-On my way in, I passed a shady guy who…
-Was carrying the tree?

705
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:17,083
-He wasn't!
-But he took it?

706
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:20,083
I know. He put it in his pocket.

707
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:23,125
One of those bottomless ones!

708
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:25,625
Dad told me that in Santa's land…

709
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:28,750
I'm tired of dad's stories.

710
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:32,708
-Mom's right.
-Don't be a suck-up.

711
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:34,875
Start telling the truth.

712
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:36,583
And take off the beard.

713
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:54,416
Come all ye shepherds To the miracle shed

714
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,166
The son of God…

715
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,541
Poor guy.

716
00:43:57,625 --> 00:43:59,625
…was born to save us all

717
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:03,083
Sing, Angels…

718
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,458
What's wrong?

719
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:07,458
Christmas is coming!

720
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:10,041
Albert the Elf came to you
from the North Pole!

721
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,958
What is it? I brought gifts!

722
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:13,916
Don't you like gifts?

723
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:27,500
-Mom!
-Stop staring.

724
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:33,125
Do you want a talking doll? How about
an electric scooter? Scooter, anyone?

725
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:34,500
Tickets, please.

726
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:39,458
I can't explain it any simpler.

727
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:43,125
I have a chin, like every other person.

728
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:45,166
-The problem is…
-Dad.

729
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,250
-A beard got stuck to it…
-Dad!

730
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,208
Hair. What don't you get?

731
00:44:52,916 --> 00:44:54,833
Okay, simple question.

732
00:44:54,916 --> 00:45:00,791
Do you think I can use a solvent
to get that beard off my chin?

733
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:02,083
But it's…

734
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:06,208
What do you mean, brush it? Come on…

735
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:09,500
-Nitwit.
-This is a real beard.

736
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:13,166
-It just grew.
-Think for a second.

737
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,666
How could it just grow?

738
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:20,000
It takes time.
Plus it's gray, and my hair is not.

739
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:23,333
-And how does Tooth Fairy…
-Tooth Fairy isn't real.

740
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:25,333
You're old enough to know that.

741
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:29,583
-But Santa and the elves are?
-Unfortunately they're not.

742
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:34,333
-So why did you see Santa's sleigh?
-I didn't.

743
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:36,125
-You said…
-I lied.

744
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:40,291
This is too much. I need your help.

745
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:43,708
Come here.
I'll close my eyes, count to three,

746
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:47,083
and then you'll pull the beard
as hard as you can.

747
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:53,708
-But if an elf…
-There is no time for a discussion.

748
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,250
On three. One…

749
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,500
Two, three!

750
00:45:58,541 --> 00:46:00,166
Don't break my head off!

751
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,666
Why are you lying? You saw the sleigh.

752
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:03,958
Piotrek?

753
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:06,333
-I'm in here.
-What happened?

754
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:10,333
-Did you buy pasta?
-It's in the bag.

755
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:12,666
No, it isn't. It's all chocolate.

756
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,083
A bag of elf-shaped chocolates.

757
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:17,583
Should I be worried about you?

758
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,500
Maybe they switched my bag?

759
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:24,125
-How many fingers do you see?
-Four?

760
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:25,750
That's a question.

761
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,958
Dawid's costume got switched too?

762
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:29,958
What's wrong with the costume?

763
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:41,541
All right.

764
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:45,083
Why would she lock the fridge?

765
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:47,666
To stop me from eating Christmas food.

766
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:53,041
And then she'll tell me,
"Eat, or it will all go to waste.

767
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:54,750
I've worked so hard."

768
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:56,708
Every year.

769
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,791
If you don't starve to death first,

770
00:47:01,666 --> 00:47:03,666
you get sick from overeating.

771
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:07,583
Why don't you spend Christmas
the way you want?

772
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:12,208
They way I want? Is that a joke?

773
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,500
You know what I would really like?

774
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:21,458
I don't. Only Santa has access to dreams.

775
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:23,541
-Santa?
-Yes.

776
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:26,291
Santa?

777
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:32,291
Okay. If Santa was real,

778
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,541
I wouldn't be sitting here.

779
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:38,041
I would be on a boat.

780
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:43,791
On a tiny, one-person boat.
With no family at all.

781
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,541
Fishing in complete silence.

782
00:47:49,791 --> 00:47:53,541
Drinking bear. Absolute peace and quiet.

783
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:56,958
That's your dream?

784
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,666
It is.

785
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:10,416
Done.

786
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:16,625
Stefan!

787
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:20,583
Excuse me. Have you seen…

788
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:27,125
Stefan?

789
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:29,041
-Where are you?
-Honey…

790
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:33,250
-Stuck in the bathroom again?
-Worse! Much worse.

791
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:36,541
-You were supposed to wait for me.
-I'm on my way.

792
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:41,208
-Any luck?
-Can you help me?

793
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:45,333
All right. Nice boat.

794
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:46,666
Thanks.

795
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:51,416
-I'll swap it for your jacket.
-Are you crazy?

796
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,916
-The boat for the jacket.
-All right.

797
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:57,208
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

798
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,291
Hey!

799
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:01,791
Hey!

800
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:04,541
Where did he go?

801
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:07,375
How much?

802
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:10,291
Forty and dropping.

803
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:15,208
He's crazy.

804
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:19,000
Don't do this, Albert. It's not a good…

805
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:21,541
He is trying to give some guys a car.

806
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,416
-At least it's not an iron.
-What do you mean?

807
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,500
-You wanted an iron.
-I mentioned it once, 134 years ago.

808
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:31,583
I got one every year since.

809
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:33,416
You could've said something.

810
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,541
Did you think I needed 134 irons?
Where would I keep them?

811
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,541
Do we have to talk about it now?

812
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:47,083
-I don't want it!
-Is that a scam?

813
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:51,416
You wanted money for a ticket back home.
A car will be faster.

814
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,583
Punch him, Boguś.

815
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:56,750
Wait. He may be a pig. Look at his ears.

816
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:58,833
I'm not a pig, I'm an elf.

817
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:08,000
-Where did you get it?
-It was all magic.

818
00:50:08,083 --> 00:50:12,666
Why didn't you magically get the money?

819
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,750
I can't make money.

820
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:18,291
Wait.

821
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:23,875
Are you nuts?

822
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:29,125
-Maybe we can take it for a spin?
-Hey, you!

823
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:32,833
-Where did he go?
-I told you to punch him.

824
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:37,333
What are we going to do with it now?

825
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,416
We'll give it away.

826
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:47,250
To the church.

827
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:53,083
Oh boy.
That's the grandparents house all right.

828
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:57,041
I want to apologize.

829
00:50:57,125 --> 00:50:59,208
I got upset. I shouldn't have.

830
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:04,291
I promise I won't do it again.
Just tell me the truth.

831
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:05,791
Who was he?

832
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:17,583
You're a big boy now,
and there is something you should know.

833
00:51:18,791 --> 00:51:20,833
There is no Santa Claus.

834
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:22,416
There are no elves.

835
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:25,500
So we won't have Christmas this year?

836
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,958
Of course we will!

837
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:32,291
What's the point?
Without Santa and the elves?

838
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:34,958
You'll get a gift. Don't worry.

839
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:40,541
Christmas is not about gifts.
You told me that yourself.

840
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,041
There is one more thing.
You won't like it.

841
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:52,208
I don't know how,

842
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:56,708
but I made a mistake
and bought you a rabbit costume.

843
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:59,916
The magic tailor doesn't make mistakes.

844
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:03,583
There is no magic tailor, Dawid.

845
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:06,083
I bought that costume.

846
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:09,333
The magic tailor
made me beautiful costumes every year.

847
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
He didn't.
Mom and I made all the costumes.

848
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:16,958
But this year we didn't have the time.

849
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:32,416
Don't stay up too late.

850
00:52:43,625 --> 00:52:48,375
I can smell the reindeer everywhere.
What are you doing?

851
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:50,708
Fixing the pipes.

852
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:53,041
Fixing the pipes? Now?

853
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:55,583
Albert is gone,
and you're playing with pipes?

854
00:52:55,666 --> 00:52:57,541
You should go there.

855
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,000
-Where?
-To the people.

856
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:05,333
Can't you see I'm busy?

857
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:10,541
If I don't fix the pipes,
we'll all freeze to death.

858
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:12,791
When elves lose their power,

859
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:15,666
they turn into toys,
get smaller and smaller,

860
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:17,625
and then disappear.

861
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:20,791
I can't do two things at a time.

862
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:24,625
What now?

863
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:27,041
Fix it, right now!

864
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:34,458
-I hate these magical tricks.
-We're leaving in the morning.

865
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:43,750
How did you know?

866
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:47,208
Know what? What did I do now?

867
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:51,458
I love it. A real poker face.

868
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,333
What is it?

869
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:59,208
-My handwriting.
-You don't say.

870
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:01,125
-How do I open it?
-No idea.

871
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:04,958
Now what?

872
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:07,916
-Is the map inside?
-What map?

873
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,083
My dad always gave me a map.
Then I had to find the treasure.

874
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:14,833
-What treasure?
-A pirate treasure!

875
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:17,375
Don't pretend
you don't know what's inside.

876
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:20,833
Hania.

877
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:23,166
I love you, but…

878
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:27,125
The map is in there!

879
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:32,333
How do I open it?

880
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,583
Say it again.

881
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:37,208
-What?
-What you just said.

882
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:40,416
-Say it!
-I said, "I love you, but…"

883
00:55:45,791 --> 00:55:49,000
Piotrek, you're the greatest,
the most wonderful,

884
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:51,708
the most magical guy I've ever met.

885
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:54,291
I love you too.

886
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:57,083
I was thinking…

887
00:55:57,166 --> 00:55:59,500
We should go back to coal.

888
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:04,500
It might seem controversial
in today's climate,

889
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:06,833
but it worked just fine for ages.

890
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:10,708
-Stop it, you won't give coal to anyone.
-I sure will!

891
00:56:11,625 --> 00:56:14,208
People give each other
the craziest things.

892
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:16,583
They deserve a ton of coal.

893
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:21,416
And you saw how they treated Albert.

894
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:25,500
Albert is the most self-important elf
I've ever met.

895
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:28,000
He only thinks about himself.

896
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:30,375
He's trying. Gives everyone gifts.

897
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:33,583
To make them like him.
He won't get power out of that.

898
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:36,333
You're the power expert now?

899
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:41,291
Actually, I am.
To have the power, you have to love, too.

900
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:43,666
Love who? People?

901
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:46,125
You know how they are. They start wars.

902
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,416
Destroy nature.

903
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,666
Break vases on Santa's heads.

904
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:51,833
Go to sleep.

905
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:54,416
When I think about it, I get so angry…

906
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,333
We have a long day ahead. Go to sleep.

907
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:07,333
I was stupid. I'm sorry.

908
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:09,833
So stuck-up.

909
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:17,416
We forgot about dreams and craziness
and we got so, you know…

910
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,083
So boring. So ordinary.

911
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:24,833
I'm glad you bought the drums.

912
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:35,375
The pine tree, the spruce, the fence.

913
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:37,708
You drew everything.

914
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:40,791
What's the treasure?

915
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:43,833
I don't know.

916
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:51,333
Listen, let's visit our parents tomorrow.

917
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:53,416
Wish them Merry Christmas.

918
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:57,500
I have a presentation tomorrow.
And you have a meeting.

919
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:01,250
That sucks.

920
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:06,083
Who will take Dawid to the Nativity play?

921
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:10,583
Why did we move to Warsaw?

922
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:13,791
You wanted to.

923
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:15,625
You said there's work here.

924
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:17,916
There was work back there, too.

925
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:20,458
Not enough to pay the mortgage.

926
00:58:20,541 --> 00:58:22,375
Why did we need the mortgage?

927
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,000
To move to Warsaw.

928
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:30,375
That was dumb, right?

929
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:34,166
You wanted to be close to the opera.

930
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:39,375
-Piotrek…
-What happened?

931
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:42,208
-Is the beard growing back?
-It's not.

932
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,125
You looked good with it, though.

933
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:48,000
I did?

934
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:50,833
Thanks.

935
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:20,291
You look great.

936
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:22,500
You just need a crown and a scepter.

937
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:27,083
-Maybe we should lose the ears.
-No, there's no need.

938
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,250
If you don't want to go,

939
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:33,666
you don't have to. I'll write you a note.

940
00:59:34,416 --> 00:59:36,916
-But I do want to go.
-He wants to go.

941
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,083
There's always next year.

942
00:59:39,166 --> 00:59:42,333
But I have a costume
from the magic tailor.

943
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:45,750
The tailor who dressed
King Matt the First.

944
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:47,833
And you look…

945
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:52,166
You look great.
You're unique and one of a kind.

946
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,666
Mommy loves you so much.
I'll keep my fingers crossed.

947
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:58,666
-Thank daddy for the costume.
-Thanks, dad.

948
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:01,916
No problem. Can you wait in the car?

949
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,416
Go. I'll be right there.

950
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,833
Keep your head up.

951
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:12,708
I'll take this.
Kids will be laughing at him.

952
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:14,500
Have a little imagination.

953
01:00:14,583 --> 01:00:18,291
-Kids can be cruel.
-Piotrek, we were having fun.

954
01:00:18,375 --> 01:00:21,416
And you're acting like a buzzkill again.

955
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,000
Maybe the magic tailor did make it?

956
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:26,333
Son of Santa and Tooth Fairy…

957
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:38,708
Bye, dad.

958
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:42,125
Maybe you want to go to work with me?

959
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:45,750
I'll make you a hot chocolate
with lots of whipped cream.

960
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:49,666
Thanks, but I'll stay.
The magic tailor knew what he was doing.

961
01:00:50,416 --> 01:00:51,541
Sonny…

962
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:55,375
I bought the costume.
There is no magic tailor.

963
01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:57,083
Or elves.

964
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,000
Or magic.

965
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:04,916
I don't know why you're saying that,
but I love you anyway.

966
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,333
I love you too.

967
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,958
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

968
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:21,541
Hey, new boy! Wrong holiday!

969
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:24,166
Cool ears. I want a pair, too.

970
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:37,666
-Hilarious!
-Hare-larious!

971
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:41,208
Why not a cow's costume?
It would be perfect for a moo-ron.

972
01:01:41,291 --> 01:01:43,666
He doesn't need a costume for that.

973
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:48,750
Break it up, kids. That's enough.

974
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:51,750
The play is about to begin. Are you ready?

975
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:55,416
That's your costume?

976
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:03,083
We come to your homes
Bringing you joy

977
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:05,875
And a Christmas carol

978
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:10,250
We have to spread the good news
all around the world.

979
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:12,666
-Don't worry, we can do it.
-How?

980
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:14,958
The three king are coming.

981
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:16,708
Look, here they are!

982
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:21,583
Welcome, great kings!

983
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:22,916
Welcome.

984
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,458
What big ears you have, Your Highness!

985
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,166
The better to hear me with.

986
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,125
And the tail to…

987
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:32,500
The magic tailor made me this costume.

988
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:11,666
Where is he?

989
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:14,750
I told him the presentation
starts at noon!

990
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,541
-Didn't I?
-You did.

991
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:19,750
-His car is here.
-The car won't do the presentation.

992
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:23,041
-Maybe he had to go…
-Go where? The client is waiting!

993
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:25,333
Go to the bathroom.

994
01:03:27,166 --> 01:03:30,250
He's out. Finished!

995
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:34,083
Mr. Kosmala!

996
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,833
I'm so sorry, boss.

997
01:03:38,708 --> 01:03:43,250
Some guy
put something on my face yesterday and…

998
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:46,291
Some hair growth thing, I think.

999
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:49,041
And it's strong. I can't even…

1000
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,958
I mean, I can, but then it's back again…

1001
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:55,541
I know how this sounds. I'll resign.

1002
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,000
That guy…

1003
01:03:58,083 --> 01:03:59,541
What guy?

1004
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:01,791
-That guy.
-Right.

1005
01:04:01,875 --> 01:04:04,041
Does he have something for the head?

1006
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:07,625
-You mean, the mind?
-I mean the hair.

1007
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:11,375
-Let me think.
-All right.

1008
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:15,083
Finish shaving.
We'll talk after the meeting.

1009
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:19,333
Thanks for your help.

1010
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,708
No problem. Anything for friends.

1011
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:27,666
I thought you won't come back.

1012
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:30,166
So many people love and need you.

1013
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:33,375
I don't know about that.
It's different in my world.

1014
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:36,083
I was the Elf of the Year
five time in a row.

1015
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:40,125
Can they manage without you?

1016
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:41,708
I doubt it.

1017
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,250
Do you really like me?

1018
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:45,625
Sure, a lot. Just like everyone else.

1019
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:47,541
Like everyone else.

1020
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:52,000
Is there anything can I get you
to make you like me more?

1021
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:53,875
I don't think so.

1022
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:57,333
This won't get us anywhere.

1023
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:00,583
There has to be something.

1024
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:06,333
I just want to hang out with you.
That's enough.

1025
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:12,416
You're weird.

1026
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,458
Mom says I'm not weird, just unique.

1027
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:20,125
It's taking ages.
You're not going to a ball, Clausey.

1028
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:22,666
Check out that Dawid for me.

1029
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,333
I am.

1030
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:29,750
Dawid Kosmala… Kosmala, Dawid…

1031
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:31,625
-Found him!
-And?

1032
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:35,458
He wrote that he wants
his neighbor's dog to die.

1033
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,833
See?

1034
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:40,083
That's people for you.

1035
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:41,916
Wait, that's not him.

1036
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Kosmala, Dawid. Three packs of cigars.

1037
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,916
Cigars? He's 11 years old!

1038
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,666
Wait, that was David Kosmala, 64,
New Jersey.

1039
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:53,125
What are you wearing?

1040
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:55,208
Why? It's a costume.

1041
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:57,250
I can't go as Santa.

1042
01:05:57,333 --> 01:06:00,708
-Why not?
-I'm not getting hit with a vase again.

1043
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:02,041
Let me see.

1044
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:06,458
Kosmala…

1045
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:09,250
-Unbelievable.
-What did he write there?

1046
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,833
We're ready, boss.

1047
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,625
Ho, ho, ho!

1048
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,958
Liar!

1049
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:33,958
Thanks.

1050
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:38,291
Look!

1051
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:04,666
-Do you like it?
-I love it.

1052
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:07,958
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

1053
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:23,791
He's at 16%.

1054
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:26,000
-Damn. Let's go.
-Don't say "damn."

1055
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:29,500
-You're Mrs. Claus.
-I thought I was Mrs. Plumber.

1056
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:33,375
-You're a plumber, too?
-The best there is.

1057
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:36,666
-He's always wanted to be one.
-Really?

1058
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:41,166
It's a hobby.
Ever since pipes were invented.

1059
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:42,958
Let's go.

1060
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,875
Do you have a fever?

1061
01:07:47,958 --> 01:07:49,958
No, I'm all right.

1062
01:07:50,791 --> 01:07:53,083
You're not feeling well?

1063
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,833
I'm losing my Christmas power.

1064
01:07:56,916 --> 01:07:58,291
Why?

1065
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:01,875
Because I believed
we can spend real Christmas together.

1066
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:05,625
-You told me you liked me.
-I do like you.

1067
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:09,333
If my power drops,
I'll turn into a toy and disappear.

1068
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:11,625
I'll figure something out.

1069
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:14,958
Maybe my dad can help us?

1070
01:08:17,166 --> 01:08:18,833
That's a good thought.

1071
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:24,666
-Your dad liked the drums, right?
-Yes. Loved them…

1072
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:29,375
You said he feels the magic of Christmas,
but he seemed pretty grim to me.

1073
01:08:30,791 --> 01:08:34,083
Dad often doesn't seem like it,

1074
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:37,166
but he knows how to be happy.

1075
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:39,916
Great! I feel better already.

1076
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:41,875
Your dad's our hope.

1077
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:45,208
Boss, should we land in the center?

1078
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:47,666
Are you crazy? They'll recognize us.

1079
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,625
-Where do we land, then?
-We'll jump into a chimney.

1080
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:54,000
I'm not getting into a chimney, no way!

1081
01:08:54,083 --> 01:08:58,208
-Chimneys are the safest way, trust me.
-I'm begging you…

1082
01:08:58,291 --> 01:08:59,875
Clausey!

1083
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:03,541
Where is he?

1084
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:06,875
-He must've jumped out.
-I know he did!

1085
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,583
A plumber in a chimney. What a world.

1086
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:13,875
He'll drive me crazy.

1087
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:15,541
Okay.

1088
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:22,541
Santa rental. How can I help you?

1089
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:25,583
Tomorrow? Forget it.

1090
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:28,083
Call back after the Epiphany.

1091
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:33,125
Stop yelling! Where are your manners?

1092
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:36,666
How can I get you a Santa on Christmas?
We're understaffed.

1093
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:39,791
Ouch!

1094
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:42,625
Where did you come from?

1095
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:45,750
-I'm…
-I know who you are.

1096
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:47,041
Dressed as a plumber

1097
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:50,166
It's Christmas Eve, not Dyngus Day. Name?

1098
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:53,875
-Claus.
-Claus? Where's the rest of your outfit?

1099
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:55,083
Well…

1100
01:09:55,166 --> 01:09:57,166
Tragic. Who hired you?

1101
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,875
You're not Santa material.

1102
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:00,625
-Ho, ho…
-Don't ho-ho me.

1103
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:03,916
To the warehouse, now.
Put on a Herod costume.

1104
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:07,083
-Herod was much shorter…
-Excuse me.

1105
01:10:07,166 --> 01:10:09,791
Sorry, that's my husband. He's a plumber.

1106
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:12,083
-Did you call a plumber?
-No.

1107
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,083
We'll be on our way, then.

1108
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:15,791
What about the beard?

1109
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:19,583
All decent plumbers have beards.

1110
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:21,500
Let's go, darling.

1111
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:24,250
Wait!

1112
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:25,375
SANTA AGENCY

1113
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:28,750
If you dressed as a Santa,
people wouldn't be staring.

1114
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:31,916
That's a company beard! Bring it back now!

1115
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:35,791
What are you looking at? Back to work!

1116
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:54,333
Great.

1117
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,708
He stole our tree,
and now you want to have him over?

1118
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,750
-Wait.
-What?

1119
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:03,666
-Not so fast.
-That beard almost cost me my job!

1120
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,916
-But…
-I turned the tree.

1121
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,666
Turned how?

1122
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,291
Into drums.

1123
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:13,000
Albert is innocent.

1124
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:14,875
And he's not really an elf.

1125
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:17,791
-Stop lying!
-Let him speak.

1126
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:20,083
How did you do it?

1127
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:24,250
I found a spell online and…

1128
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:26,416
It worked.

1129
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,166
But I will never do it again. I promise!

1130
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:33,166
Dawid, there are no elves.
There is no magic.

1131
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:35,375
Stop it. Guys.

1132
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,791
Tell us who your friend is.

1133
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:41,041
He has nowhere to go on Christmas Eve.

1134
01:11:41,125 --> 01:11:43,125
He is poor, homeless.

1135
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:46,708
That's why he took the tree?

1136
01:11:47,291 --> 01:11:49,333
He didn't take it.

1137
01:11:49,416 --> 01:11:52,416
I threw the Christmas tree out.

1138
01:11:53,291 --> 01:11:54,833
And stole the drum set.

1139
01:11:56,375 --> 01:11:59,750
-What do you mean, you stole it?
-I did.

1140
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:03,833
I went off the rails
and stole it from a music shop.

1141
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:07,583
Right. That friend talked you into it?

1142
01:12:07,666 --> 01:12:11,000
He's innocent, he knew nothing about it.

1143
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:15,791
I put hair grower on dad's chin.

1144
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,791
-Are you waiting for anyone?
-No.

1145
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:29,625
Listen. Is your friend an elf?

1146
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:31,833
What are you talking about?

1147
01:12:31,916 --> 01:12:35,583
-You can tell me.
-He's just a boy, an orphan.

1148
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:38,416
His house burned down,

1149
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,958
he lost his keys,

1150
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:41,875
they cut off the power.

1151
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:44,833
He is like the lost wanderer,

1152
01:12:44,916 --> 01:12:48,291
the one we always leave
an empty chair for at the table.

1153
01:12:49,791 --> 01:12:52,625
-Hello.
-Good morning. Look.

1154
01:12:56,458 --> 01:12:59,958
This is what Dawid did to my son.
He pulled his ears.

1155
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:03,333
-He pushed me.
-Pushing wouldn't make your ears long.

1156
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:06,791
He had to pull. I won't leave it at that.

1157
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:09,791
Bruises and scratches I get.
We were all boys once.

1158
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:11,750
But pulling the ears?

1159
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,291
-Do you like it?
-You have to run.

1160
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:19,750
What? Did you tell them
that I'm an elf and I come from…

1161
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:22,333
I blew it, alright?

1162
01:13:22,916 --> 01:13:24,458
Can you help me?

1163
01:13:24,541 --> 01:13:26,791
You need a second drum set?

1164
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:30,833
No, dad went to get the cops,
and mom can come in any minute.

1165
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:44,291
It's not high, you can do it.

1166
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:47,625
I have nowhere to go.
You're my only friend.

1167
01:13:47,708 --> 01:13:51,458
-Everyone loves you.
-No one loves me. People are awful.

1168
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:56,333
-Go back to the North Pole.
-I can't. I lost my power.

1169
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,625
You're the best elf!

1170
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:02,000
I was the best elf. Ouch.

1171
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:06,500
I took the liberty
of drawing a preliminary sketch.

1172
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:07,666
Identical.

1173
01:14:08,666 --> 01:14:10,833
But the mustache was more horizontal.

1174
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:14,458
And the beard wasn't so pointy,
it was more of an U.

1175
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,208
All right. Back to the ears.

1176
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:21,875
You should see a…

1177
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:26,875
-What's an ear doctor called?
-No idea.

1178
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:29,166
A laryngologist.

1179
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:30,333
A laryngologist.

1180
01:14:30,416 --> 01:14:32,791
First of all, this man here,

1181
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:34,625
that is, his son,

1182
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,375
pulled my son's ears…

1183
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:40,041
It wasn't my son. It was some strange guy

1184
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:43,125
whom I already mentioned
in connection to the drums.

1185
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:45,875
All right. I suggest you have him examined

1186
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:50,041
by a court-approved expert laryngologist.
As to the beard…

1187
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:53,625
-Here.
-Thanks.

1188
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:55,333
As to the beard,

1189
01:14:55,416 --> 01:14:59,500
I suggest you see a…
What's the beard guy called?

1190
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:02,458
I know this one. A dermatologist.

1191
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:04,666
-Hairdresser.
-Right.

1192
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,875
Or, better yet, a barber.

1193
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:11,000
But if I were you,
I would wait till the beard grows back.

1194
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:14,125
There's nothing there now.

1195
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:16,250
That's because I shaved it off.

1196
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:18,958
But it will grow back. It always does.

1197
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:21,666
Not slowly, but all at once.

1198
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,666
It's huge. This big.

1199
01:15:26,666 --> 01:15:27,916
Dawid!

1200
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:32,416
Dawid!

1201
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:42,875
Piotrek…

1202
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,916
We have to get to my grandparents' house.

1203
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,250
It won't matter. I lost my power.

1204
01:15:53,875 --> 01:15:55,500
Stop whining.

1205
01:15:57,375 --> 01:15:59,750
You'll see a real Christmas Eve,

1206
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:03,416
feel the magic of Christmas,
and your power will be back.

1207
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:06,375
I wish I could create a chopper for us.

1208
01:16:06,458 --> 01:16:08,958
Or a jet
with vertical takeoff and landing.

1209
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:11,500
-So do it.
-I can't.

1210
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:14,000
Exactly.

1211
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:17,250
We have to do it the human way.

1212
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:19,625
-Let's go.
-Where?

1213
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,500
Come on.

1214
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,375
We'll hitchhike.

1215
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:25,916
DEAR PARENTS…

1216
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:31,458
"Dear parents,
I have to save Albert the Elf.

1217
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:34,458
I'm off to find a real Christmas Eve.
Dawid."

1218
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:37,000
It's my fault. I told him all that crap.

1219
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:40,625
You didn't listen to him.
He's a smart, reasonable boy.

1220
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:43,000
-If he said…
-Elves aren't real.

1221
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:46,541
I'm just saying
we should've trusted him more.

1222
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:48,250
You didn't even listen.

1223
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:50,458
To what? Some story about Santa?

1224
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:52,666
He believed your Santa stories.

1225
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:57,708
Piotrek!

1226
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,166
Not again!

1227
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,791
-I believe him.
-Very funny.

1228
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:11,166
Ho, ho, ho.

1229
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:13,750
I'm a plumber.

1230
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:17,958
Sorry to bother you.
We're looking for an elf.

1231
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:21,041
I mean…

1232
01:17:21,125 --> 01:17:23,750
Our son says he is an elf,

1233
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:26,041
but he's a plumber, too.

1234
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:30,041
He came to Warsaw two days ago,
and as far as we know…

1235
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:34,666
That's a very nice beard. Just like a…

1236
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,500
A plumber's.

1237
01:17:37,875 --> 01:17:41,166
Snow maidens loved me. Little elves, too.

1238
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:44,958
I was the Elf of the Year
five times in a row.

1239
01:17:45,041 --> 01:17:46,708
Five times! Were you?

1240
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:49,500
Albert, don't be a bother.

1241
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,375
I'm sorry about him.

1242
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:59,125
Do you even believe in elves?

1243
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,250
Of course.

1244
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,333
I did so many good things.
So many good deeds!

1245
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:14,250
-There! Stop the truck!
-What is it?

1246
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:18,208
I helped this guy!
Changed his life! Stefan!

1247
01:18:18,291 --> 01:18:20,083
-We have to go!
-Wait.

1248
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:23,125
Stefan! Remember me?

1249
01:18:23,208 --> 01:18:24,750
No!

1250
01:18:25,416 --> 01:18:27,416
-Stefan, wait!
-No!

1251
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:33,083
-Stefan, wait!
-Lord, what was I thinking…

1252
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:34,375
Don't be scared!

1253
01:18:34,958 --> 01:18:36,250
Stefan!

1254
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:43,500
Hey! Stop! Wait for us!

1255
01:18:44,416 --> 01:18:46,250
Stop!

1256
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:52,458
-Humans!
-We'll get another ride.

1257
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:54,166
Yeah, right.

1258
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:57,541
Why did you have to wave at me?
If you didn't…

1259
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:59,708
It's all your fault, you know?

1260
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:04,500
Albert is their son.
He probably escaped with Dawid.

1261
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:07,250
-These are for you.
-Thank you.

1262
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:09,125
We're very worried, too.

1263
01:19:11,291 --> 01:19:13,916
Calm down, Clausey darling.

1264
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:17,583
My husband
had a traumatic experience with…

1265
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,375
I think I know where they went.

1266
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:24,666
-Where?
-To Dawid's grandparents'.

1267
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:26,166
Let's think logically.

1268
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:29,208
He wrote they want to experience
a real Christmas.

1269
01:19:29,291 --> 01:19:31,666
And he spent all his great Christmases

1270
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:33,750
at my parents' house.

1271
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:35,791
-Is it far?
-In the mountains.

1272
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:39,541
He sang carols,
shared his wafer with the animals.

1273
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:42,916
Last year he and my husband
saw Santa's sleigh.

1274
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,958
-We didn't see it.
-That's not the point.

1275
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:47,541
-I didn't see it.
-See?

1276
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:50,958
-He didn't either.
-Doesn't matter. How do we get there?

1277
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:52,875
We should take the…

1278
01:19:52,958 --> 01:19:54,791
I don't know what.

1279
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:57,333
The car. We can take you.

1280
01:19:57,416 --> 01:19:59,541
The car, exactly. Ho, ho, ho.

1281
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:06,375
It's not far.

1282
01:20:06,875 --> 01:20:08,250
I can't do it.

1283
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:11,791
Keep trying. People don't give up.

1284
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:15,291
I'm not a person. And I'm freezing.

1285
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:17,375
Look at my clothes!

1286
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:22,083
Did the magic tailor make them?

1287
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:25,583
Yes, the same one your dad goes to.

1288
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:27,625
Tooth Fairy's cousin.

1289
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:36,708
We'll have our own Christmas Eve.

1290
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,750
Wait here.

1291
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,500
I'll be back soon.

1292
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:02,291
Is…

1293
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:04,958
Is Albert an elf?

1294
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:15,500
Your husband
doesn't look like a plumber, either.

1295
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:20,416
That really is his hobby.

1296
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,500
But career-wise,

1297
01:21:23,916 --> 01:21:26,666
-he works at a…
-Christmas delivery service.

1298
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,083
You could say that.

1299
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:33,291
It has to be a hard job.

1300
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:35,666
He only works once a year.

1301
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:39,458
You can't imagine what it's like
having him at home all the time.

1302
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,416
Thank God for plumbing.

1303
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:48,500
Are you Santa Claus?

1304
01:21:48,583 --> 01:21:49,875
Me? Oh, right.

1305
01:21:49,958 --> 01:21:53,666
-No, why would you say that?
-It's your beard.

1306
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:56,083
This guy has a beard, too.

1307
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:58,333
But he's a plumber.

1308
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,833
-Aniela, stop bothering people.
-It's fine.

1309
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:09,583
-Thank you, Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1310
01:22:10,791 --> 01:22:12,041
Pump five.

1311
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:14,041
Mr. Santa!

1312
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,583
I love you.

1313
01:22:15,666 --> 01:22:17,333
Thank you.

1314
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:19,375
That's all.

1315
01:22:19,458 --> 01:22:26,125
Do you often come down to…

1316
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,333
Together?

1317
01:22:29,416 --> 01:22:34,875
It's the first time since 86.

1318
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:36,541
86 BC.

1319
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:40,583
My husband comes here more often.
But he's a bit scared,

1320
01:22:40,666 --> 01:22:45,208
-Thus the chimneys and invisible sleigh.
-The sensitive type.

1321
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:50,375
I thought he loved all the people,
especially small kids.

1322
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:53,375
He does love everyone. That's the tragedy.

1323
01:22:53,458 --> 01:22:57,541
If he didn't,
the magic of Christmas would disappear.

1324
01:22:57,625 --> 01:23:01,500
It comes from his great love.

1325
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,583
My question is, is there a special cream

1326
01:23:06,666 --> 01:23:08,875
that makes the hair grow so fast?

1327
01:23:08,958 --> 01:23:11,000
There is one thing you could use.

1328
01:23:11,083 --> 01:23:13,833
-The sparrow balm. Sparrow, the bird…
-Yes, I know.

1329
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:16,041
So you mean the… poop?

1330
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:18,583
Definitely, that's right.

1331
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:21,833
My boss is bald. He asked me to find out.

1332
01:23:21,916 --> 01:23:23,125
It's not magic.

1333
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:25,583
-I wasn't thinking that.
-You weren't?

1334
01:23:25,666 --> 01:23:27,375
That's my wife's specialty.

1335
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:29,208
Just between us.

1336
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:32,541
She started believing in Santa.

1337
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,875
Can you help me?

1338
01:23:40,875 --> 01:23:42,541
How? I lost all my power.

1339
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:45,041
I'm not talking about tricks.

1340
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:49,000
You can't use magic forever.

1341
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:51,416
That would be too easy.

1342
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:52,916
Easy?

1343
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:57,625
I'm cold.

1344
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:03,041
You'll warm up soon.

1345
01:24:07,791 --> 01:24:09,041
Albert, focus.

1346
01:24:10,375 --> 01:24:12,375
Imagine that…

1347
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:15,541
Maybe not.

1348
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:18,125
-Stand in front of me.
-Why?

1349
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:21,333
We'll share a Christmas wafer.

1350
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:25,333
-That's a candy bar.
-No, it's not. It's a wafer.

1351
01:24:36,875 --> 01:24:38,125
I wish you…

1352
01:24:38,916 --> 01:24:40,916
Happiness.

1353
01:24:41,916 --> 01:24:44,333
Health. Lots of money.

1354
01:24:45,333 --> 01:24:46,750
Lots of love.

1355
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,291
May all your dreams come true.

1356
01:25:15,375 --> 01:25:17,291
Great Christmas Eve.

1357
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:20,125
So many people came.

1358
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:24,500
That's aunt Aurelia over there.

1359
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:26,791
I saw uncle Kornel in the hall.

1360
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:29,875
Old Mrs. Popielak is behind the tree.

1361
01:25:30,916 --> 01:25:34,291
They're dead, but they're always with us
on Christmas Eve.

1362
01:25:34,833 --> 01:25:36,208
You really do like me.

1363
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:39,041
Eat up.

1364
01:25:39,125 --> 01:25:42,083
The carp is coming next.
Then poppy seed grains.

1365
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:44,916
Poppy seed with cookies.

1366
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
And then we'll sing Christmas carols.
Remember?

1367
01:25:48,083 --> 01:25:49,666
I taught you.

1368
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:55,208
Oh, you little one, little one

1369
01:25:56,166 --> 01:25:59,083
Tiny like a glove

1370
01:26:00,041 --> 01:26:03,333
Or as little, as little

1371
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:07,958
Like a piece of bow

1372
01:26:08,833 --> 01:26:12,666
Sing your song and play for him

1373
01:26:13,291 --> 01:26:17,666
Little one, little one

1374
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:22,541
Sing your song and play for him

1375
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:24,500
Little one

1376
01:26:25,625 --> 01:26:27,416
Little one

1377
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:06,625
Honey! My truck is back!

1378
01:27:15,041 --> 01:27:16,500
My darling.

1379
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:34,750
Honey, I'm so sorry.

1380
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:36,625
The things I've been through!

1381
01:27:37,125 --> 01:27:39,833
I'm sorry… I'm a wreck.

1382
01:27:39,916 --> 01:27:43,166
Excuse me! How can I get out of here?

1383
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,875
-Security!
-Can you help me, please?

1384
01:27:54,666 --> 01:27:55,791
Clausey.

1385
01:27:58,625 --> 01:28:00,291
-What?
-The beard.

1386
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:04,625
I know.

1387
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,041
I'm sorry.

1388
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:14,291
Are you okay?

1389
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,291
Hang on.

1390
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:22,166
It's over that hill.

1391
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:24,916
We'll have a real Christmas Eve.

1392
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:27,750
Not a candy bar.

1393
01:28:28,666 --> 01:28:29,958
Just hang on.

1394
01:28:34,541 --> 01:28:35,916
Albert…

1395
01:28:38,375 --> 01:28:39,791
Grandpa!

1396
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:44,916
Grandpa!

1397
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:51,791
Grandpa!

1398
01:28:56,625 --> 01:28:59,500
-Grandpa!
-Dawid? What are you doing here?

1399
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:01,083
Dad!

1400
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:03,208
Piotrek, Dawid is here! Dawid!

1401
01:29:03,291 --> 01:29:05,250
-Grandpa!
-Dawid.

1402
01:29:05,333 --> 01:29:06,750
Dawid!

1403
01:29:06,833 --> 01:29:08,875
-Why are you here?
-He's alone.

1404
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:10,791
I know.

1405
01:29:10,875 --> 01:29:12,916
Where's the tree? The mistletoe?

1406
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,083
Pierogi? Hay under the tablecloth?

1407
01:29:15,166 --> 01:29:18,291
Sweetie, where were you?
I was worried sick.

1408
01:29:18,375 --> 01:29:20,041
What were you thinking?

1409
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:22,625
-Stop yelling!
-We drove all the way here!

1410
01:29:22,708 --> 01:29:24,333
-Dawid!
-Come back!

1411
01:29:24,416 --> 01:29:26,208
-Stop!
-It's Christmas Eve!

1412
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:29,666
-Do you have mistletoe?
-Dawid, darling!

1413
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:31,666
Pierogi? Hay under the tablecloth?

1414
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:34,166
A tree? Mistletoe?

1415
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:35,916
-No…
-What?

1416
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,041
Dawid!

1417
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:41,500
-Where is Albert, honey?
-Hania!

1418
01:29:41,583 --> 01:29:43,750
We don't have a Christmas Eve ready.

1419
01:29:44,666 --> 01:29:46,291
Merry Christmas.

1420
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,625
You're so tiny.

1421
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:07,958
You'll be okay.

1422
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:10,041
How could Albert disappear?

1423
01:30:10,125 --> 01:30:13,125
People don't just disappear.
Let's call the police.

1424
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:14,791
You already talked to them.

1425
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:18,375
-You want to do nothing?
-Calm down, will you?

1426
01:30:18,458 --> 01:30:21,791
Albert… I'm sure we'll find him.

1427
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:25,375
I didn't prepare Christmas dinner.
We were going to be alone.

1428
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:29,375
Just two old people.
It would be a waste of a good tree.

1429
01:30:29,458 --> 01:30:30,958
Mom, come on.

1430
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:33,583
Thank you. We have to get going.

1431
01:30:33,666 --> 01:30:36,000
-Back to work.
-It's Christmas Eve.

1432
01:30:36,083 --> 01:30:38,416
Some people work on Christmas, right?

1433
01:30:40,375 --> 01:30:42,375
Why aren't you doing anything?

1434
01:30:42,458 --> 01:30:44,041
Dad, get some mistletoe.

1435
01:30:44,125 --> 01:30:46,125
Grandma, make some pierogi!

1436
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:48,333
-Dawid…
-It's Christmas Eve!

1437
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:50,208
-Do something!
-Dawid.

1438
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:52,916
-Don't go out again!
-Piotrek, wait.

1439
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,541
You need to trust him.

1440
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:08,375
Mrs. Claus, Mr. Santa Claus.

1441
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:11,625
-You can't leave Albert like this.
-He's gone.

1442
01:31:11,708 --> 01:31:14,750
-Who's gone?
-The elf.

1443
01:31:20,583 --> 01:31:22,500
Can't you see that's Santa Claus?

1444
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:25,750
What are you talking about?
He's a plumber.

1445
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:27,708
He's just named Claus.

1446
01:31:27,791 --> 01:31:29,791
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

1447
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:30,875
Mrs. Claus.

1448
01:31:30,958 --> 01:31:33,083
Mrs. Claus is the plumber's wife.

1449
01:31:33,166 --> 01:31:35,000
Sure.

1450
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:37,000
Heavy tree.

1451
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:00,625
Albert!

1452
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:13,875
I don't want to leave.

1453
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,416
I don't want you to leave either. But…

1454
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:20,375
Other kids want to get gifts, too.

1455
01:32:22,083 --> 01:32:23,875
It's not all about the gifts.

1456
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:26,666
Will you wave at me?

1457
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:32,875
Albert!

1458
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:40,083
Well, well, well…

1459
01:32:40,166 --> 01:32:41,875
Stop it, Clausey.

1460
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:44,750
Albert!

1461
01:32:44,833 --> 01:32:46,500
Where have you been?

1462
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:52,958
I see Albert was just lost.

1463
01:32:53,041 --> 01:32:56,708
-I knew we would find him.
-He's so beautiful!

1464
01:32:56,791 --> 01:33:00,791
-Look, I can make those ears, too.
-All right.

1465
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:04,833
I wanted to thank you all so much.

1466
01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:08,666
So listen, here's the thing…

1467
01:33:11,041 --> 01:33:14,333
I don't know. Maybe it's not a good idea…

1468
01:33:14,416 --> 01:33:18,250
-Just say it, Clausey.
-But I'm just…

1469
01:33:19,041 --> 01:33:21,083
I never thought I'd say this,

1470
01:33:21,166 --> 01:33:24,041
-but my wife makes great cheesecake.
-Clausey!

1471
01:33:24,125 --> 01:33:27,000
I know what I'm saying.

1472
01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:31,625
So maybe one day you'd like to…

1473
01:33:33,208 --> 01:33:34,291
Visit us.

1474
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:38,500
Maybe after Christmas.

1475
01:33:38,583 --> 01:33:40,250
We'd love to have you.

1476
01:33:40,333 --> 01:33:42,916
My husband will send a sleigh for you.

1477
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,541
A sleigh!

1478
01:33:44,625 --> 01:33:46,375
Where do you live?

1479
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:50,125
Not far!

1480
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,458
-In Bukowina?
-Hush.

1481
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:56,000
What does it matter?

1482
01:33:56,083 --> 01:33:57,708
I was just concerned.

1483
01:34:02,166 --> 01:34:05,833
-Have you written a letter to Santa?
-In November.

1484
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:12,250
I will personally deliver your gift.

1485
01:34:13,166 --> 01:34:16,875
-How did you get your power back?
-Thanks to you.

1486
01:34:16,958 --> 01:34:19,875
I mean, thanks to me,
but really thanks to you.

1487
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:22,958
-In fact…
-Albert, we have to go.

1488
01:34:23,583 --> 01:34:25,083
It's time.

1489
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:28,583
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas!

1490
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:31,541
Thank you. Merry Christmas!

1491
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:34,833
One day I'll tell you all about it.

1492
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:38,083
I have to go. Bye!

1493
01:34:38,833 --> 01:34:42,083
-Ho, ho, ho!
-Bye!

1494
01:34:42,166 --> 01:34:44,791
Come on, we have to prepare Christmas Eve!

1495
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:46,375
We're coming.

1496
01:34:46,458 --> 01:34:49,208
Aren't they staying for dinner?

1497
01:34:49,291 --> 01:34:51,625
No, they had to go.

1498
01:34:51,708 --> 01:34:53,375
I'll give them a ride.

1499
01:34:53,458 --> 01:34:56,291
Don't! Fresh air will do them good.

1500
01:34:56,375 --> 01:34:58,750
I don't want them to get lost again.

1501
01:34:58,833 --> 01:35:00,583
Be careful!

1502
01:35:00,666 --> 01:35:02,083
Excuse me!

1503
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:03,750
They're not there.

1504
01:35:04,583 --> 01:35:06,583
Of course they're not.

1505
01:35:10,791 --> 01:35:12,208
Hello?

1506
01:35:19,291 --> 01:35:21,208
-Let's go.
-All right.

1507
01:35:22,458 --> 01:35:23,958
Don't stay out too long.

1508
01:35:24,833 --> 01:35:26,625
-Christmas Eve!
-Let's do it!

1509
01:35:26,708 --> 01:35:29,041
Can I have one last look?

1510
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:31,208
No, you've done enough.

1511
01:35:31,291 --> 01:35:34,166
-But it's about Hania's gift.
-No.

1512
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:35,708
Go ahead.

1513
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,666
-Can we go now?
-One minute.

1514
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:43,041
It's about Dawid's gift.

1515
01:35:43,583 --> 01:35:46,583
He's done so much for me,
and I didn't give him a thing.

1516
01:35:46,666 --> 01:35:49,083
Yes, you did. Let's go.

1517
01:35:49,916 --> 01:35:51,000
I didn't.

1518
01:35:51,083 --> 01:35:53,875
I kept asking,
but he said he's got everything.

1519
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:55,916
He got his gift early.

1520
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,458
-What gift?
-He wrote… Can I tell him?

1521
01:35:58,541 --> 01:36:04,541
His letter to Santa said
that his dream is to meet an elf.

1522
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:07,333
Well? See?

1523
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:09,125
Let's go.

1524
01:36:16,916 --> 01:36:18,375
Very funny.

1525
01:36:19,375 --> 01:36:20,583
Very funny.

1526
01:36:21,958 --> 01:36:23,958
Okay, 46 steps ahead.

1527
01:36:24,041 --> 01:36:26,500
One, two, three, four…

1528
01:36:26,583 --> 01:36:28,875
Maybe we shouldn't do this.

1529
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:31,291
We left grandpa and grandma alone.

1530
01:36:32,666 --> 01:36:34,375
-How many steps?
-21.

1531
01:36:34,458 --> 01:36:36,916
Okay, 22, 23, 24…

1532
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,625
This is amazing.

1533
01:36:38,708 --> 01:36:40,375
-26, 27, 28…
-Hania!

1534
01:36:40,458 --> 01:36:43,333
I wish the gift was there.

1535
01:36:43,416 --> 01:36:46,041
But I know it's not.

1536
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:49,458
-I forgot to take it.
-Oh my, did you really?

1537
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:52,000
Dad is a little liar.

1538
01:36:52,083 --> 01:36:54,625
-He is playing a joke on us.
-What?

1539
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:59,916
Okay, where were we? 30, 31, 32, 33…

1540
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,541
34, 35. Three little spruces.

1541
01:37:03,625 --> 01:37:04,875
Here they are.

1542
01:37:06,083 --> 01:37:07,458
Turn around and jump.

1543
01:37:09,208 --> 01:37:10,416
This has to be it.

1544
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:16,250
I checked, there's nothing here.

1545
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:18,000
There it is!

1546
01:37:20,916 --> 01:37:22,666
For my dearest Hania.

1547
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:26,333
That's your handwriting.

1548
01:37:28,291 --> 01:37:30,083
It's a handwriting…

1549
01:37:30,166 --> 01:37:33,083
Looks a bit like mine… It's mine.

1550
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:36,333
But how…?

1551
01:37:39,875 --> 01:37:42,666
-A cherry stoner.
-Right.

1552
01:37:43,708 --> 01:37:46,916
You're the greatest. I love you so much.

1553
01:37:49,291 --> 01:37:50,791
And Santa, too.

1554
01:37:52,541 --> 01:37:54,041
You're the best!

1555
01:37:54,125 --> 01:37:56,791
The greatest,
most magical dad in the world!

1556
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,458
A cherry stoner!

1557
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:06,958
Where are you, you damned birds?

1558
01:38:07,791 --> 01:38:09,916
Jerzy? What are you doing?

1559
01:38:14,041 --> 01:38:16,916
-Feeding sparrows.
-Have you lost your mind?

1560
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,416
-They'll poop everywhere.
-Let them.

1561
01:38:21,291 --> 01:38:23,500
It's Christmas Eve. A time of sharing.

1562
01:38:29,208 --> 01:38:32,625
-I love you.
-I love you too.

1563
01:38:39,458 --> 01:38:41,875
You have to have someone you love.

1564
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:44,458
That's what Christmas is all about.

1565
01:38:44,541 --> 01:38:47,875
The end, finito.
No gifts can replace that.

1566
01:38:47,958 --> 01:38:51,416
How did you get your power back?
Did Dawid help you?

1567
01:38:53,458 --> 01:38:54,916
It was all me.

1568
01:38:55,666 --> 01:38:58,166
-That's impossible.
-That's the only way.

1569
01:38:59,083 --> 01:39:03,125
I thought someone else can help me.
Gave away tons of gifts. Nothing.

1570
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,833
Dawid loved me, but the power…

1571
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:11,791
I had to start loving him.

1572
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:14,416
Nobody else can do that for you.

1573
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:17,708
How did you do it?

1574
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:19,916
No idea. I just felt it.

1575
01:39:21,625 --> 01:39:25,000
I had this tiny thought in my head.

1576
01:39:25,083 --> 01:39:27,791
I was tiny myself at that point.

1577
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:30,250
Almost invisible.

1578
01:39:30,958 --> 01:39:32,958
Then I had this last thought.

1579
01:39:33,833 --> 01:39:35,875
That I'll never see Dawid again.

1580
01:39:36,958 --> 01:39:38,166
Or you.

1581
01:39:39,083 --> 01:39:40,833
Or Mrs. Claus.

1582
01:39:40,916 --> 01:39:42,416
Or…

1583
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:46,750
I don't know how I did it.

1584
01:39:46,833 --> 01:39:48,666
But I love you all.

1585
01:39:50,083 --> 01:39:52,416
-I love you, Erwin.
-I love you too.

1586
01:40:16,833 --> 01:40:18,500
Dawid, darling.

1587
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,625
You wrote to Santa

1588
01:40:21,708 --> 01:40:23,625
asking him to send the elf?

1589
01:40:23,708 --> 01:40:27,791
I did. I thought he could do his magic
and bring us all together.

1590
01:40:28,333 --> 01:40:30,166
Because this Christmas Eve…

1591
01:40:30,875 --> 01:40:33,166
Warsaw was not so bad.

1592
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:34,958
Dad was trying really hard.

1593
01:40:35,041 --> 01:40:37,541
-And mom, too.
-That's right.

1594
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:42,625
But if we're not all together,
it's not a Christmas Eve.

1595
01:40:42,708 --> 01:40:44,291
Not really.

1596
01:40:46,416 --> 01:40:48,625
And I have a friend now.

1597
01:40:48,708 --> 01:40:50,500
An elf friend.

1598
01:40:50,583 --> 01:40:52,375
Albert the Elf!

1599
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:55,458
Home is the best place to be.

1600
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:58,458
And home is where your close ones are.

1601
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,166
Let's sing.

1602
01:41:01,791 --> 01:41:06,666
Let us all start caroling

1603
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:11,958
It's high time for that

1604
01:41:24,291 --> 01:41:27,291
Two Christmas cakes
Are slowly rising

1605
01:41:27,375 --> 01:41:29,125
Getting tastier and tastier

1606
01:41:29,208 --> 01:41:31,291
Two delicious cakes

1607
01:41:31,375 --> 01:41:34,833
We could eat poppy seeds
Out of the mixing bowl all night

1608
01:41:34,916 --> 01:41:36,958
Eat poppy seeds

1609
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:40,250
Under the tree
With their heads down

1610
01:41:40,333 --> 01:41:43,500
Both clean and dusted
A donkey and an ox

1611
01:41:43,583 --> 01:41:46,083
The cat squints its eyes
The table is set

1612
01:41:46,166 --> 01:41:48,958
It's all white

1613
01:41:49,041 --> 01:41:51,041
The mistletoe, mistletoe

1614
01:41:51,125 --> 01:41:55,958
Is laughing over the table
We should kiss under it

1615
01:41:56,041 --> 01:41:58,416
Sweet Lord, the tablecloth is stained

1616
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,208
It's time to wash it

1617
01:42:05,791 --> 01:42:08,750
Till the caroling dies down

1618
01:42:08,833 --> 01:42:11,750
Christmas came and went

1619
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:14,500
Came and went

1620
01:45:06,916 --> 01:45:09,708
