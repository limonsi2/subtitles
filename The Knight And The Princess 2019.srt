3
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,042
The storm is raging!

4
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,125
The storm, the storm!

5
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,042
Visibility is nil.

6
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,125
Strike the sails.

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Watch out, Jaber!

8
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:53,417
Come on, all together.

9
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:57,458
The ship is drifting.

10
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:58,542
Drifting!

11
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,625
Be careful, we're going to collide!

12
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:02,375
Veer to the right!

13
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:04,333
More to the right!

14
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,208
Veer to the right!

15
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:17,833
Thank God.

16
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,917
A long time ago,
back in the 7th century

17
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:29,125
Trade by sea between
the ports of the Arabian Peninsula

18
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:32,083
and the shores of the Indian Ocean
flourished.

19
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,667
Goods from the West have arrived!

20
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,417
Goods from the West!

21
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,167
Yemeni coffee!

22
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,750
Pistachios from Aleppo!

23
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:48,250
Damascene silk!

24
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,292
Arab merchants' decency earned the respect
of traders on different shores

25
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,542
and created an environment where
different cultures were accepted

26
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,208
During the Umayyad era

27
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:01,042
the plague spread in
the Arabian Peninsula and beyond.

28
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:05,375
The infection appeared on Arab merchants

29
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,625
on their way to Gem Island

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,167
So, they decided to die at sea

31
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:14,792
and spare the island their deadly disease.

32
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,417
The wives and children of the merchants
who fell victim to the plague

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,375
had to return to the Arabian Peninsula

34
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:29,417
The King of Gem Island gave them
a ship to return with their belongings.

35
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,292
In honour of their martyrs

36
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:33,917
Sohaila.

37
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,292
Sohaila!

38
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,375
Sorry, Sir.

39
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,667
It's OK, they are just kids

40
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:45,833
Pirates!

41
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:52,625
Gold! Gold! Gold!

42
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:56,292
Priceless loot is in our sights

43
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,667
Gold, Gold! Gold!

44
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:03,542
Light the fire of wrath.

45
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:11,750
Move forward, roar,
wreck everything, destroy.

46
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,000
Bring forward,

47
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:18,000
the treasure we crave.

48
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,250
Here is our toll, sir

49
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,750
Not bad, take
the women and their valuables.

50
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,000
Move, get down.

51
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,792
Rescue us, Al Hajjaj!

52
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,375
Excellent!

53
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,208
Is this all the gold?

54
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,125
All of it, my lord.

55
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,750
And the toll?

56
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:32,083
They had no money, so we
gotthe gold and the women.

57
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,375
Where are they?

58
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:36,083
Under guard, well protected.

59
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,292
Great!

60
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:40,417
Daher, the king of Sindhistan,
was a powerful man.

61
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:43,167
Welcome, priest of sacred Shouka.

62
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,417
You came just in time.

63
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:51,875
He made an alliance with the Med pirates
to rob merchant ships.

64
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,792
But this time, he took
the Arab women hostage.

65
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,000
The priest came to him with a prophecy
that upset him.

66
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,208
A prophecy?

67
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,917
Yes, my lord.

68
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:07,250
What does your prophecy say,
priest of destruction?

69
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:09,458
The prophecy says, my lord,

70
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:14,042
The Arabs will not rest until they save
their women and children.

71
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,042
Let them come to us,

72
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:23,500
And we will drown them in the sea.

73
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,917
And if they come by land
my elephants will crush them.

74
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:30,375
But the prophecy, my lord.

75
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:37,208
The great army of Daher
won't be affected by such nonsense.

76
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:49,125
Zaid.

77
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,083
Amr?

78
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,583
It looks like it will be an exciting race!
Why don't you join them?

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,625
Racing against Mohammed and Sobha!
I will surely lose.

80
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,958
The kid!

81
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,500
My son!

82
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:45,000
Mohammed lost the race.
I wish you had taken part.

83
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,333
What's your name, young knight?

84
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,500
Iyad, sir.

85
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,208
I didn't expect
you would lose a race.

86
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,250
But I won a third friend.

87
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,167
Iyad, Amr, Zaid.

88
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,458
You missed the prize!

89
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,792
This is a more precious prize.

90
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,583
Thank you, you are a true knight.

91
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,250
My lord!

92
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:11,792
My lord

93
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:16,625
- What do you have?
- The Med pirates kidnapped our women.

94
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,125
Bin Al Qasim, why did you bring us
to your uncle's house?

95
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,750
Al Hajjaj is holding a council
to rescue the women hostages.

96
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,333
- I want to know their plans.
- What does that have to do with us?

97
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,792
What does that have to do with us?

98
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,458
How can we know their plans?

99
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,125
It's war, then.

100
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,667
And we're ready.

101
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:43,875
We should send Mohammed Bin Haroun
with his army from the Chinese borders.

102
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,792
He is very close to Daher

103
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,833
They will send Mohamed Bin Haroun
from the Chinese borders.

104
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:51,500
Where is Bin Al Qasim?

105
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,958
- Bin Al Qasim is outside, my lord.
- Not now.

106
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,167
Pardon, my lord, the matter is urgent
and cannot be delayed.

107
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:02,333
- What do you want, Bin Al Qasim?
- I want to help rescue the hostages, sir

108
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Do you know where they are?

109
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:08,000
Somewhere in Debal Bay,
the stronghold of the pirates.

110
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,542
and how did you find out?

111
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:12,875
I heard it from sailors
who travel there.

112
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,458
How old are you, my son?

113
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:16,667
He just turned fifteen, my lord.

114
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,958
And you want to save the women
kept at Debal Bay?

115
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,500
And teach the Med pirates a lesson.

116
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,875
They treat me like a child, Sobha.

117
00:08:36,957 --> 00:08:42,750
My heart is longing,
My destiny is calling.

118
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:48,708
As if I were a stranger,
in my own land

119
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,583
I long for a land.

120
00:08:55,083 --> 00:09:00,250
Where my dreams can
spread their wings and fly

121
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,625
like a speeding horse.

122
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,667
What you are asking me for
is difficult, my son

123
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,792
But not impossible.

124
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,167
You're the ruler of Basra, dad.
You can help me.

125
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:18,750
Al Hajjaj will send Bin Haroun
to deal with Daher.

126
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:23,625
Must the women and children
wait until Bin Haroun's army moves?

127
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:28,375
I'm planning a quicker operation
to rescue the hostages.

128
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,583
You're still too young, my son.

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,542
I have to do this,
even if no one believes that I can.

130
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:42,792
Even if life turns against me.

131
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:48,792
I'm longing for a land.

132
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:52,500
Where my dreams can spread their wings
and fly

133
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:58,542
like a speeding horse

134
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:06,167
Hit harder! Harder!
Come join us, Bin Al Qasim.

135
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,917
I have a more urgent matter,
Abul Aswad.

136
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:12,625
It's a clever and ambitious plan

137
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:16,500
We'll be discreet.
We need you with us, Abul Aswad.

138
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,292
We'll launch a quick raid
and rescue the hostages.

139
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,083
Unfortunately, I won't be here.

140
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,833
We need you with us.

141
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,542
We've been ordered to join
Bin Haroun's army.

142
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,708
Ibn Al Qasim,
Despair is not a trait of youth.

143
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,333
What shall we do, Abul Aswad?

144
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,292
Boys, Abul Riyah is the man
for your mission.

145
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:42,458
I'm Abul Riyah,
One day, I lost my leg.

146
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,333
That very same day
my passion erupted.

147
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:49,542
I grew wings
and flew to the horizon

148
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:53,333
I grew wings
and flew to the horizon

149
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:55,167
He's Abul Riyah.

150
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,875
I'm Abul Riyah.

151
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,417
He's Abul Riyah,
One day, he lost his leg.

152
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:04,125
that very same day
his passion erupted.

153
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,500
I grew wings
and flew to the horizon

154
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,417
I grew wings
and flew to the horizon

155
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:29,125
I sew sails as if
I would wear them.

156
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:33,000
The sun, humbly sets behind my door.

157
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,167
He sews sails as if
he would wear them.

158
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:40,208
The sun, humbly sets behind his door.

159
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,583
The sea is in my blood,
the wind is my blanket,

160
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:48,917
the wind I'm caressing
as if lips were kissing.

161
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,625
He's Abul Riyah, Abul Riyah,
One day, he lost his leg.

162
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,958
That very same day
his passion erupted.

163
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:59,833
I grew wings
and flew to the horizon

164
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,500
I grew wings
and flew to the horizon

165
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,542
I'm Abul Riyah,
a fire of emotions.

166
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,000
I sleep like a baby
when storms rage manically.

167
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,375
He's Abul Riyah, a fire of emotions.

168
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:32,208
He sleeps like a baby
when storms rage manically.

169
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,958
I'm the brother of waves
and the twin of cheeriness.

170
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:39,542
Whenever waves rave
my heart is their slave

171
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,292
Yet I feel free and brave

172
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,625
He's Abul Riyah,
One day he lost his leg.

173
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,708
That very same day
his passion erupted.

174
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:52,083
I grew wings
and flew to the horizon

175
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:56,125
I grew wings
and flew to the horizon

176
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,917
He is Abul Riyah.

177
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,333
It's him.
Abul Riyah

178
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,625
It's a dangerous quest,
Bin Al Qasim.

179
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,292
I want your advice, Abul Riyah,

180
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:19,417
you're the hero of the Battle of Masts,
an expert on the sea and its battles.

181
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh yes, the sea...

182
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,000
Afrakoosh, Bardakoosh

183
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,625
Enough mumbling, priest of destruction,
tell me what you want.

184
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,917
Look and listen.

185
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:44,250
What do you want me to see, priest?

186
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,000
It's the knight.

187
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:52,750
It's written
that a man named Mohammed,

188
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,625
Grandson of Mohammed.

189
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:59,542
Keep your prophecy
to the layman, priest.

190
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:03,917
No harm my lord,
if we handle this matter with caution.

191
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:08,583
Exactly!
Let me deal with this.

192
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,458
I will send someone to find him
in the Arab army and bring him to you.

193
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:36,042
I can't take it anymore,
how can I sleep with all this snoring?

194
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,500
Curse the day I met you, Shamhoresh,
the worst day ever!

195
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,167
Wake up you animal

196
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:52,750
Bakhtoo, what's wrong with you?

197
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,125
Nothing.

198
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,542
Was I snoring?

199
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,542
Not at all! This is the best thing
in my life, it's your gift!

200
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:03,167
It's like having a drummer
playing in my head!

201
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:07,583
I can't control it, Bakhtoo.
I have a problem with my nose

202
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:12,083
Always the same story!
I told you to see a doctor!

203
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:15,042
Afrakoosh, Bardakoosh

204
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,208
King of the sculpted demon.

205
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,292
- Shamhoresh!
- What's going on?

206
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,500
What's happening?

207
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,542
Oh yee King of the sculpted demons.

208
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:36,417
Afrakoosh, Bardakoosh...

209
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:40,667
King of the demons who are sculpted

210
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:44,000
onto the walls of the temples
of the sacred Shouka.

211
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,042
Oh yee King of the sculpted demons.

212
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:55,542
Send me your two miserable jinn.

213
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,958
The powerful Shamhoresh.

214
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:02,083
And the sly Bakhtoo.

215
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,292
May they appear before me.

216
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,417
Our lord, the priest of destruction.

217
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,750
Update me on the
Chinese Wall mission, you wretches.

218
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,417
Everything is fine.
We did exactly what you asked.

219
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,458
Why were you late? And where is
your report on your mission?

220
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:34,458
Sorry, sir, we were on a vacation.
That was our agreement.

221
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:36,625
We couldn't even sleep.

222
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,083
Don't you complain about sleeping!

223
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,083
Acupuncture didn't work, my lord.

224
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:47,833
Frankly, he needs a miracle
for his nose.

225
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:48,917
Not now!

226
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:55,125
It is written that a man named Mohammed,

227
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,208
Grandson of Mohamed,

228
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:03,958
Will kill our ruler, our lord,
our protector,

229
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:09,083
His majesty King Daher the Great.

230
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,416
We must take action
as soon as possible.

231
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,083
We're trapped!

232
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,333
Good news, folks!

233
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,625
Good news!

234
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,791
Good news, Ibn Al Qasim!

235
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,125
Hello, Abul Riyah.
any news?

236
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:37,917
I found you a big merchant convoy
going to India.

237
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,583
Great!

238
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,125
But they said I have to go with you.

239
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,917
Did they really say that?

240
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,917
Do you think I put in all that effort
just to stay here?

241
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,500
I'm worried that you may find
the journey hard to endure.

242
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,583
Worry about yourself and your friends.

243
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,833
For me, the sea is my life.

244
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:02,792
And that's where I wish to die.

245
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,750
Bakhtoo, is this the Arab army?

246
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,333
No, Real Madrid football club!

247
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,375
Of course it is!

248
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:18,333
Oh my God! How will we find
the man we're after in this crowd?

249
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,375
And most of them must be
named "Mohamed"

250
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,458
Call "Mohamed",
and they'll all answer.

251
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,917
But we want Mohamed,
grandson of Mohamed.

252
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,833
- I have an idea!
- Your ideas are stupid.

253
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:32,250
- It's a great one.
- Your ideas are like your nose.

254
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,208
Just listen, give me a chance.

255
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:38,125
We possess two soldiers,
walk among them,

256
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,583
and we ask for Mohamed,
grandson of Mohamed.

257
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,458
As I said, it's a stupid idea

258
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:46,708
By the time we reach our target
he'll have found Daher and killed him.

259
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,583
You're right.
How will we solve this, Bakhtito?

260
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:52,833
Don't call me that!

261
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,917
Ok, chill out. Use your brain
and find us a way.

262
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:02,750
We need a smart plan.
Bakhtito will find it.

263
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,792
You said you don't like that nickname.

264
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,417
Only I can nickname myself,
and my departed mom could too.

265
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,042
I wish her good health.

266
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:16,042
Mohamed Bin Al Qasim embarked
with his friends and Abul Riyah,

267
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:21,833
On an unpredictable adventure.

268
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,000
This is the spot.
We're close.

269
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,833
- Where's Abul Riyah?
- There.

270
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,417
Merchant convoy coming!

271
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,750
Do you see that carriage?

272
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:56,583
Yes, I do.

273
00:19:56,667 --> 00:20:00,250
There are two cooks hired to
work for the Arab soldiers.

274
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:06,417
- How do you know?
- Did you forget I'm a Jinni?

275
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:07,792
Oh, yes.

276
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,958
We'll possess them to disguise ourselves,
and enter the camp.

277
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,625
And we will cook and eat a lot!

278
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,792
You only care about your belly!
Get ready, when it's exactly below us,

279
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,083
we'll jump
One... two... three...

280
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:26,458
Possess the man not the horse dummy!

281
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,667
Just a kiss, don't be scared.

282
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:40,042
Oh wow, that was funny

283
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:55,583
They're close.

284
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,375
Bin Al Qasim!

285
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,167
Pirate ships are getting closer

286
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,792
Act as if you're ready to pay the toll.

287
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,458
At my signal, we'll spread out
as we agreed.

288
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,167
Let's face them!

289
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,292
They're ruthless!

290
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,625
Don't worry.

291
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,500
Come on, men.

292
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,292
Careful, be careful.

293
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:23,167
Pay attention, lads.

294
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,458
We prepared a party for them
they won't forget.

295
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:33,708
Raise the sign that we are ready
to pay the toll.

296
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:38,417
Search their ships thoroughly
for gold and women.

297
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,708
Like we did with the Med pirates?

298
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,083
Yes, idiot! Hurry, up!

299
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,417
Point each catapult towards
a different ship.

300
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:49,125
Abul Riyah, make sure
their aim is right.

301
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,625
Come on.

302
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,750
What's that?

303
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:31,833
A warship! you idiot

304
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,417
Get ready

305
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:35,250
Launch!

306
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:39,708
Raise the shields!

307
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,333
Watch it

308
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:02,250
Fire!

309
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,250
Run away!

310
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,000
They're running away!

311
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:23,917
Help!

312
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,375
Help! Save us!

313
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,292
What is it?

314
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:29,250
An old man calling for help.

315
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,625
It could be a trap!

316
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:33,833
Even you Amr!

317
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,125
Mind the fire!

318
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,042
Save the women
and the princess of Qossah!

319
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,750
Come on, hurry up!

320
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:03,542
- Come, my lady.
- My mistress is in there.

321
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:49,542
They call me Abu Haroun.

322
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,875
In our Emirate, ruled by King Daher,

323
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,792
there are many Arab merchants.

324
00:24:55,042 --> 00:25:00,583
We have a mosque built by a merchant
in the era of Caliph Othman.

325
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,083
God bless his soul.

326
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:08,792
We fell hostage to the Zot pirates
while we were returning from a trip.

327
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,708
Weren't they the Med pirates
of King Daher?

328
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:17,833
No, sir. The Med pirates are busy
with the feast of their God Shouka.

329
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,625
It seems we got ourselves into
the wrong battle!

330
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,208
What a mess!

331
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,042
God sent you to save us.

332
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,792
Actually, we came to save
other people.

333
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:34,375
- The wives of the Arab merchants.
- Do you know where they are?

334
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,667
Yes, but you need a guide.

335
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,042
Abu Haroun!

336
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,667
Our princess wishes to...

337
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:49,708
Our princess wishes
to meet her savior.

338
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,583
The one who saved her.

339
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:54,833
Go, Bin Al Qasim.

340
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,208
The princess awaits you.

341
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,125
I'm glad you're safe.

342
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,542
Abu Haroun told me you're Bin Al Qasim.

343
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:03,000
Yes, and you?

344
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:05,792
- Lola Benny.
- Lola Benny?

345
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,292
- Does it sound odd to you?
- Somewhat.

346
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:11,125
It sounds like our "Lobna".

347
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:12,292
- Lobna?
- Yes.

348
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:14,792
Then call me that, if you want.

349
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:16,333
My princess.

350
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:18,708
How can I reward you?

351
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:21,375
I don't take rewards
for fulfilling my duties.

352
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,000
Then come to my father's palace.
It's very close.

353
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:29,625
I can't, but I will provide
you with guards,

354
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,375
Who will escort you to your palace.

355
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,750
What do you think, my lady?
He looks brave and handsome.

356
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,042
But he's a stranger, Amina.

357
00:26:57,125 --> 00:27:00,000
singing: Oh mercy! Mercy...

358
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:03,375
calm down, calm down

359
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,750
Are you here?

360
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,458
Of course! Here I am in the flesh!

361
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:13,042
- The battle is raging out there.
- And the food is simmering here.

362
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:15,250
- I'm starving, you done?
- Not yet.

363
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:20,958
You deserve it.

364
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,750
Did you find our man?

365
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:27,083
It's pointless. The records say that
half the soldiers are named Mohamed.

366
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:30,958
But our man has a grandpa named Mohamed.

367
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:36,458
Everyone is Mohammed
Even their chief is Mohammed,

368
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:38,667
And his grandpa is Mohammed.

369
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,583
- That's him!
- You think?

370
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:44,125
It's crystal clear:
Mohammed grandson of Mohammed.

371
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:47,458
- So what do we do?
- Where's your brain power now?

372
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:51,083
Are you making fun of me because
for once, I liked your idea?

373
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:54,792
I think we should kidnap him
and take him to the priest.

374
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:58,000
- You never have a complete plan.
- OK, what shall we do?

375
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:02,167
We poison his food and get it over with.

376
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:07,250
What? No, Bakhtoo.
We don't kill. It's not how we work.

377
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,250
Ok, forget it, I have a brilliant idea.

378
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,542
Oh my!

379
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,833
Sorry, bro.
Tell me, what's your idea?

380
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:24,750
I found an herb on the mountain here.
It has an awesome effect.

381
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:27,208
A superb Indian herb.

382
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:28,708
What does it do?

383
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:33,083
It wastes a person.
You won't even recognize who you are.

384
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:38,208
When they take their lunch break,
we'll put this herb in their food.

385
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:43,792
And we put a lot of it, so when they
go back to battle,

386
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,667
they'll be spaced out!

387
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,375
The King of Qossah.

388
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:00,292
Hello.

389
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:03,792
Welcome. My daughter told me
everything.

390
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,833
To return the favor

391
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:10,375
We came to help you free your hostages.

392
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,083
The feast of the God Shouka
is after tomorrow.

393
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:17,583
Everyone will be busy
with the ceremonies.

394
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:21,625
Then it will be easy to enter
the hostages camp.

395
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,542
That is very smart.

396
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:30,958
Until that moment comes,
you will be my most welcomed guests.

397
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:34,083
We would be honored to stay.

398
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:41,500
Welcome to the prince
and his friends.

399
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,333
Come!

400
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,083
You look like an Indian prince.

401
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:18,875
Maybe you should think of staying here?

402
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:31,792
It seems we will all stay.

403
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:50,167
Your country is beautiful.
Find me a wife, Abou Haroun.

404
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,500
Hey guys, when are we
rescuing the hostages?

405
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:57,417
Tomorrow in the cover of night...

406
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:22,500
- What kind of ritual is this?
- They've been chanting since dawn.

407
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:24,583
What are those branches?

408
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:28,042
They're from the Salla tree,
which is sacred to them.

409
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,833
They burn it after sunset.

410
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,833
There's the hostage camp.

411
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,750
It's as quiet as a graveyard.

412
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:52,875
There are only a few guards,
most of them are celebrating.

413
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:09,792
Stupid! What are you doing?
If Daher finds out, he'll behead you.

414
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,917
And who's gonna tell him?

415
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:19,625
They're celebrating there,
and we're here guarding their women.

416
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:23,792
It won't take long, tomorrow
we will send them to Daher.

417
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:29,083
Then let's celebrate tonight

418
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,750
You're so evil.

419
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,833
Get us more drinks.

420
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:40,542
The night is still young.

421
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:00,083
What is that?
Go check it out.

422
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:08,708
I guess it was just a cat.

423
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,958
Watch out! There!

424
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,917
They've come to rescue us

425
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,292
Get us out of here!

426
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:39,958
Zaid stop. We came to rescue
the hostages, not to kill.

427
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,250
Come on, quickly.

428
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:00,500
Tell me, son, who is your leader?
We want to thank him.

429
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:03,667
Not now, my lady.
Let's move.

430
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:18,333
Amr!

431
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:29,417
Don't take it out.
The arrow pierced my heart.

432
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:33,250
Don't leave me here.

433
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,792
Throw my body into the sea.

434
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:37,542
You'll live, Amr.

435
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:41,417
You'll make it, with God's help.

436
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,792
I'm the cause of Amr's death.

437
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:04,375
No, it's Daher. It's he who ordered
the women to be kidnapped.

438
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,792
He's responsible for what happened.

439
00:35:07,042 --> 00:35:10,500
Let me deal with Daher. Leave me here.
I'll find a way to avenge Amr's death.

440
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:16,250
Calm down! Thank God for saving
the hostages, before they got hurt.

441
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,750
No, Zaid, I don't want to lose
another friend.

442
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:22,500
Be sure, Daher will pay for his crimes.

443
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:28,292
Tomorrow we will delay our departure,
to carefully study his fortress.

444
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:33,167
It's true, whoever controls this
fortress, rules the whole Debal region.

445
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:37,625
And he who liberates Debal,
can free all of Sindh.

446
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,375
What are all these rocks?

447
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:45,875
They throw these rocks
from the fortress at invaders.

448
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,000
What are you thinking,
Bin Al Qasim?

449
00:35:50,292 --> 00:35:51,750
How to break in.

450
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,667
Is this what we came for?

451
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:56,292
Mohamed, it seems impossible.

452
00:35:56,667 --> 00:36:00,625
Especially if they throw
these huge rocks at us.

453
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,125
Except if...

454
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:07,542
Except if we use the same rocks
to break into the fortress.

455
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:13,167
Your idea is good and smart,
but it needs " a lady luck".

456
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,167
- A lady luck?
- Yes, a giant catapult is my lady luck.

457
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:22,292
And no one but Abul Riyah
can build it.

458
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,958
- Will you come back?
- Yes.

459
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:32,000
Let's go, Bin Al Qasim.

460
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:35,125
- I promise.
- Do you see that golden star?

461
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:37,500
You mean the polar star?

462
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:41,625
Whatever its name, it's witness
of your promise of return.

463
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:47,292
Whenever you look at it,
you will see me.

464
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,875
We're late, Bin Al Qasim!

465
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,833
Farewell.

466
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:06,875
One wave follows another,

467
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,792
saying: I want to catch it.

468
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,708
What are those birds?

469
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,875
Shimo, isn't that the temple?

470
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,167
Yes, that's it.

471
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:23,958
Seriously? Why does it look so small?

472
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:28,500
Bakhtoo, I can't see the opening
where we should enter. Do you see it?

473
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:31,417
- Isn't it that one?
- If you see it, then fine.

474
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,167
Let's go.

475
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:48,500
Our master, our lord, our chief...

476
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,625
Your grace.

477
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:53,667
We're very tired.

478
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:58,458
It's wonderful to see you.
We bring you great news.

479
00:37:58,792 --> 00:37:59,875
Really great!

480
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,125
Stop it, you cretins!

481
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:07,875
Have pity on us, so the sacred
Shouka will have pity on you.

482
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:12,833
Damn you!

483
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:15,000
We're already damned!

484
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:17,583
And no one can set us free.

485
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:21,375
Get a grip, you wretches.
What's wrong with you?

486
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:26,625
Nothing, sir. We're just
enjoying our reckless youth.

487
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:29,542
What about Mohammed,
grandson of Mohammed?

488
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,083
He is wasted.

489
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,083
- Excuse me?
- We put drugs in his lunch.

490
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:37,667
And also in his men's lunch.
Like this one.

491
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:42,042
Then the army of our King Daher
tore them to pieces.

492
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:46,542
Including their leader Mohamed Bin Haroun
Bin Mohamed.

493
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,708
Are you satisfied?

494
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,042
Is he a young man?

495
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:52,458
Who?

496
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:59,458
Mohamed, grandson of... Mohammed.

497
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:03,917
Not at all, sir. He is an old man,
maybe seventy years old.

498
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,250
Then it's not him.

499
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:12,042
The prophecy says he is a young man,

500
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:16,042
Seventeen years old.

501
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:19,458
Then excuse me, I'll leave it to you
and your prophecy.

502
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:22,208
Just explain to me

503
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:26,833
How can a nation have
a seventeen-year-old leading an army?

504
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:30,000
That means a battalion commander
would be in kindergarten?

505
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:35,792
That's what the prophecy says,
Bakhtito.

506
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,500
I hate nicknames.

507
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,000
His majesty, King Daher.

508
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:44,125
Your prophecy came true, archpriest.

509
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:49,083
My men killed Mohammed Bin Haroun
and defeated his army.

510
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:54,625
Isn't he The Mohammed,
from your prophecy?

511
00:39:54,917 --> 00:39:57,500
It must be him, majesty.

512
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:05,292
An urgent message from Debal, majesty.

513
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:06,292
What?

514
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:09,542
Some Arab sailors attacked
the hostage camp.

515
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:10,875
The hostages?

516
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:15,167
Yes, majesty, and their leader
is only sixteen years old.

517
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:17,625
Sixteen? And what is his name?

518
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:21,958
They say he's Mohamed Bin Al Qasim
Bin Mohammed.

519
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:28,542
It's him! Mohammed Bin Al Qasim.

520
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,083
In the incense, prophecies gleaming,

521
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:58,625
omens of a knight appearing,

522
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,500
Like a bird of prey.

523
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:07,042
Our defeated soldiers,
hanging from the claws of eagles.

524
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:16,000
A prophecy that will destroy the old

525
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:19,708
A fire which turns us into ruins.

526
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:25,500
A frightening prophecy gets louder,
it bursts like gunpowder.

527
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:29,042
Our glory plunging to hell!

528
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:34,208
Shouka, our powerful God,

529
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:38,208
Sacred apex of our worship.

530
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:42,042
May the invaders
be struck by thee,

531
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,208
swept up by the wind
you surely will send.

532
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:51,792
Nourish the land with their blood
like a river, oh god,

533
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,000
like a river.

534
00:41:56,333 --> 00:42:00,667
Let the sky drop boulders,

535
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
then fire that smolders.

536
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:08,958
Let those who escape
your claws of destruction

537
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:13,250
beg your mercy
at their defeat.

538
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:16,500
At their defeat.

539
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:27,042
God is great.

540
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,667
God is great.

541
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:39,542
Mohamed Bin Al Qasim came back
from his first mission

542
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:43,542
But he was so sad
for the loss of his beloved friend.

543
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,667
At the same time he was happy,
for he met the love of his life.

544
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:53,042
Do you love her, my son?

545
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,000
I've never had this feeling before.

546
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:58,417
I'm ashamed.

547
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,583
That's life, my son.

548
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:05,417
Separation and encounter,
life and death.

549
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,000
Two sides of the same coin.

550
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:14,167
Bakhtoo, will we really kill, like he
ordered us? Why are you stopping?

551
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,292
Listen, yesterday a fax arrived
at my office.

552
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,125
Saying that Mohamed Bin Al Qasim
is in love with the Princess of Qossah.

553
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:23,042
Lola Benny? I don't blame him.

554
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:27,750
Let's stop somewhere,
instead of hovering like this.

555
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:30,708
The fax said he will go back to her.

556
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,750
Oh, love! How I wish to try it

557
00:43:34,042 --> 00:43:38,125
Focus on our job! When he returns
he will kill Daher, as the prophecy says.

558
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:41,875
- You think so?
- Do you doubt our priest?

559
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:44,417
Of course not.
But what shall we do?

560
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,625
We must prevent him from
returning back to Sind.

561
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,583
We have to find him
another sweetheart.

562
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:53,333
So he won't go back to Lola.
Let's go.

563
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:58,292
- Where to?
- To the land of the lovers...

564
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,625
My passion overflows,

565
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,208
- Overflow?
- What overflow?

566
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:16,167
After such a reception
I can die happy now.

567
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:19,125
- What about your bride?
- Where is she?

568
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:24,125
I mean, the giant catapult you said
you'd build.

569
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:26,458
Are we really going back?

570
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:31,500
With a careful plan and patience,
we can free the whole of Sindh.

571
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,167
Bin Al Qasim, I'm too old
for your dreams.

572
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:37,792
Look there!

573
00:44:38,167 --> 00:44:40,833
- They'll declare him a hero.
- He deserves it.

574
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:44,375
What the heck are you saying?

575
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:47,458
Stop it, you'll punch a hole in my head.

576
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,958
Just think, if he becomes a hero,
Al Hajjaj will appoint him to free Sindh.

577
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:54,250
You're right.

578
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,542
We have to act quickly.
I've got an idea.

579
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,750
- Let's go!
- Where to?

580
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,625
To the house of Al Hajjaj.

581
00:45:05,292 --> 00:45:14,208
You who come out of a bath,
with rosy cheeks like peaches...

582
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:17,958
Bakhtoo, what is that?

583
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:21,750
It's Ayat, daughter of Al Hajjaj.
Follow me.

584
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,500
Hold me.

585
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:32,333
- How does she concern us?
- She's at the marrying age.

586
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:35,167
We must convince her to marry
Mohamed Bin Al Qasim.

587
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:36,583
Shame on you!

588
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,792
It's you who's my shame!

589
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,583
Look, you possess the big maid,
and I, the thin one.

590
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,083
My God! She's violent.

591
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:48,458
Quickly, before the envious look
in their eyes is gone.

592
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:58,583
- What's going on?
- Nothing, I stumbled.

593
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,458
Why are you suddenly fat
and talking like a man?

594
00:46:01,542 --> 00:46:03,250
It's just that...

595
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,125
You be silent.
Can't you hear, my lady?

596
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:10,500
- What?
- The music of the celebrations outside.

597
00:46:11,292 --> 00:46:12,625
What celebrations?

598
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,750
Basra is celebrating
the return of its hero.

599
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:17,042
What hero?

600
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:20,125
Your beloved cousin,
Mohamed Bin Al Qasim.

601
00:46:20,917 --> 00:46:21,833
What?

602
00:46:21,917 --> 00:46:25,625
He rescued the Arab hostages
and brought them back from Sindh.

603
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:27,917
Give me one.

604
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:31,083
Sindh... Arab hostages...

605
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,875
Which hostages?

606
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:38,625
Come and watch.

607
00:46:39,542 --> 00:46:41,875
look there!

608
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,000
I don't care.

609
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:47,917
How come?

610
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:52,250
I heard that Sohaila, daughter of
Abul Hakam, wants to marry him.

611
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,500
Who?

612
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:56,042
Sohaila, my lady.
The one you hate.

613
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,750
That skinny bamboo stick?

614
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Yes, her. The one who's
not half as pretty as you.

615
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,458
Why don't you have a look?

616
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:08,917
A look at whom?

617
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:11,625
At the hero.
Look, he's coming.

618
00:47:18,542 --> 00:47:20,250
It's my father, Al Hajjaj.

619
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:23,917
- She's also blind.
- We don't mean your father.

620
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:27,250
We mean that handsome
young man at his side.

621
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:29,083
Yes, I see him.

622
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:31,958
- Who is he?
- The groom.

623
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:34,417
Whose groom?

624
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,708
Could be yours!

625
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:39,708
Your cousin. You deserve him,
and he deserves you.

626
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:45,417
He could be your Romeo.
He would do everything for you.

627
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:48,000
His love for you
keeps him awake all night.

628
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:50,333
He could be Romeo and you are Juliet

629
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:52,625
But maybe...

630
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:54,875
Maybe what?

631
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:57,292
Maybe he won't like me.

632
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,667
The way you look

633
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:07,625
Awoke a feeling in my heart.

634
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:12,083
You! The most beautiful
woman I've seen.

635
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:14,458
I want him, mom!

636
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,542
- Mohamed?
- Yes, him.

637
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,250
I love him.

638
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:21,708
You?

639
00:48:21,917 --> 00:48:23,292
Yes, Mom.

640
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:28,875
It's the first time you've said
something meaningful.

641
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:34,833
What are you saying?

642
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:40,542
Ayat is almost twenty
And no one has asked for her hand.

643
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:45,083
And no one is better for her
than Bin Al Qasim.

644
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:47,417
- Ayat?
- Yes, Ayat!

645
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:51,917
But I'm thinking of sending him to lead
an army to free the land of Sindh.

646
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:56,542
My daughter's husband will
never go to war.

647
00:48:57,208 --> 00:48:59,583
But marriage is not on my mind.

648
00:48:59,667 --> 00:49:01,083
You're old enough.

649
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:02,625
I'm not ready.

650
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:07,292
Al Hajjaj has appointed you as Ruler
of Shiraz, south of Fares.

651
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:11,708
- And the liberation of Sindh?
- That's all he told me, tonight.

652
00:49:11,917 --> 00:49:12,875
What did you say?

653
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:17,708
He set a date for you to take the position
at the beginning of the month.

654
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,250
I open my hands.

655
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:44,292
And I see you.

656
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:47,667
And I travel without moving a step.

657
00:49:50,042 --> 00:49:52,000
I open my hands.

658
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,833
And I see you.

659
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:59,792
And I travel without moving a step.

660
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:04,792
My soul always meets you

661
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:09,333
At the polar star.

662
00:50:11,417 --> 00:50:15,833
I close my eyes for a few seconds.

663
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:21,708
My body stays in its place

664
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:26,417
And I see your soul coming to me

665
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:30,625
At the polar star,

666
00:51:04,792 --> 00:51:09,125
You who dictated the encounter

667
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:13,917
of our longing souls.

668
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:20,042
Although distance makes us suffer

669
00:51:20,583 --> 00:51:24,375
you decided we should meet

670
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:30,833
- I open my hands and see you.
- I close my eyes for a moment

671
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:34,667
and I travel without moving.

672
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,583
My body stays in its place.

673
00:51:37,917 --> 00:51:44,458
Your soul always meets mine
at the polar star

674
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,083
My lord.

675
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:54,542
My prince.

676
00:51:56,167 --> 00:52:00,500
- Fokha.
- What's wrong? You didn't even eat.

677
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:04,125
I've lost my appetite.

678
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:08,083
May God spare you sadness
and sorrow, my son.

679
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:13,417
Merciful God, you who hear us,

680
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:18,708
We can foresee our encounter.

681
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,167
God, when will you bring us
back together?

682
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:29,500
So that our hands will join,

683
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:35,917
under the polar star.

684
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,667
Oh, my goodness!

685
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:56,000
I feel for you, my son.

686
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:01,000
So you killed him?

687
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,792
Consider him dead.

688
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:05,542
What do you mean, you idiot?

689
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:07,500
We got him married.

690
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:10,458
Look, sir. Look

691
00:53:10,917 --> 00:53:12,000
What is it?

692
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:15,458
A new invention called:
the magic mirror.

693
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:19,750
It replaces the old crystal ball.
It's the new model.

694
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:21,958
You can also use it when shaving.

695
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:24,958
Position it well, zoom in.

696
00:53:25,042 --> 00:53:28,458
Watch Bin Al Qasim and his wife
in the land that he was appointed to.

697
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:30,917
Bin Al Qasim, come.

698
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,875
Zoom in, quickly.

699
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,833
Come, come...

700
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:41,875
I made you some yummy food
worthy of a king.

701
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:47,708
Do you like it?

702
00:53:47,917 --> 00:53:52,083
I think that Bin Al Qasim
is out of our way now.

703
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:54,542
Excellent.

704
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:59,625
That's enough for now, get out
of my sight! And you, take a holiday.

705
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:03,750
Yes! Finally the time has come
for me to get married!

706
00:54:04,042 --> 00:54:08,250
I will go to King Daher
to give him the news

707
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,042
I am sure he will be relieved.

708
00:54:11,417 --> 00:54:13,333
But what shall I tell him?

709
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:16,042
Tell him he's dead.
The king won't go and check.

710
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:20,708
I'll tell him that he's dead.

711
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:30,542
- The surgery, my lord.
- Which surgery?

712
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:33,833
- For Shamhoresh's nose.
- Not now!

713
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,583
Leave

714
00:54:39,917 --> 00:54:41,917
Never mind, my friend.

715
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:45,417
It looks like I'll have
to do your surgery.

716
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:51,875
I changed my mind, my nose is fine

717
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:00,167
After the success of Bin Al Qasim
in rescuing the hostages,

718
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,292
Arab merchants were
persecuted in the land of Sindh.

719
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,708
Women and children were killed.

720
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:34,125
Our money was stolen, Sir.
We have to do something.

721
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:36,458
What else shall I do?

722
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,167
I sent Abdallah Bin Nabhan
to Daher with an army.

723
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,042
He was killed and his army defeated.

724
00:55:43,208 --> 00:55:47,500
Then I sent Bin Al Warqaa,
and he met the same fate.

725
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,958
What can I do?

726
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:55,125
I remember that Bin Al Qasim had
planned very carefully

727
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:58,000
To attack Daher by land and by sea.

728
00:55:58,292 --> 00:56:03,542
He made a tour of the country, finding
the enemy's weak spots.

729
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:06,500
Then, call Bin Al Qasim.

730
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:18,667
This is the fourth marriage proposal
you've refused, my daughter.

731
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:23,958
All the princes of the realm and
neighboring realms have proposed to you,

732
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:26,958
but you refuse, giving no reason.

733
00:56:27,292 --> 00:56:29,083
You know the reason, father.

734
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:32,333
The one you're waiting for, won't come.

735
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:33,625
He will.

736
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:38,250
Two years have passed
and we've had no news of him.

737
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:43,708
I know he will come and I'll meet him.
I feel it in my heart.

738
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:47,833
Bin Al Qasim!

739
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:51,500
Welcome back, man.
When did you arrive?

740
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:56,292
I came yesterday
and I am at your command.

741
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:58,958
What is this huge catapult?

742
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:02,875
It's the "Bride".
Abul Riyah designed it.

743
00:57:03,042 --> 00:57:06,000
He bought Lebanese cedar wood.

744
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:09,125
Where's Abul Riyah?
I haven't seen him today!

745
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:12,250
An illness kept him from coming.

746
00:57:13,042 --> 00:57:16,042
I'm sorry you can't come with us,
Abul Riyah.

747
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,708
I wish I could, my son.

748
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:23,250
But it seems illness
works in tandem with age.

749
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:29,792
They say you're more than
100 years old. Is that true?

750
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:33,625
The truth is that you will win,
Bin Al Qasim.

751
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:35,667
Don't exert yourself.

752
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:39,667
I see victory written
on your forehead, my son.

753
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:42,250
We'll miss you, Abul Riyah.

754
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:48,417
Give my greetings to Lobna
and her old father.

755
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:51,375
May God be with you, dear friend.

756
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:55,458
Go in peace, my boy.

757
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:13,417
Afrakoosh Bardakoosh
King of the sculpted demon.

758
00:58:14,292 --> 00:58:17,083
Bakhtou Shamhourish

759
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:27,208
Have mercy on us, our lord!

760
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:29,250
Have mercy!

761
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:33,583
I'm a newlywed, my lord.
I haven't consummated my marriage!

762
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,708
Consider him dead?

763
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:40,333
Isn't that what you said, you
miserable wretched creatures?

764
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,792
What happened?

765
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:47,167
Mohamed Bin Al Qasim,
you disgrace to jinn!

766
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,500
What of him?

767
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:52,417
He's leading the Arab army
toward our land.

768
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:57,792
Through the wide desolate deserts,
defeating one city after another.

769
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:59,875
Why is it our fault?

770
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:06,500
He is about to sack Armail.

771
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:12,583
If you had killed him at the start,
this wouldn't have happened.

772
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:17,875
We can't foresee the future.
And I've just got married,

773
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:20,292
After 500 years of engagement.

774
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:22,375
Go and kill him.

775
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,958
We're not killers.

776
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:29,833
You know it too well. We may make lovers
fight or bring bad luck.

777
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:32,667
We can do black magic,
make a kid stumble...

778
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:38,792
I order you, in the name of
our sacred god Shouka,

779
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:45,083
and in the name of Bardakoosh,
the demon sculpted on my temple,

780
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:53,500
To go and never come back except
with news of Bin Al Qasim's death.

781
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
That's it,
I am fed up with this priest.

782
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,292
You said it. But what can we do?

783
00:59:58,583 --> 00:59:59,833
We rebel.

784
01:00:00,042 --> 01:00:03,167
As long as we stay under his influence,
we are his slaves.

785
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:06,833
You don't know how I feel.
My wife, her family and friends...

786
01:00:06,917 --> 01:00:09,875
They're all wondering why
I ran away on my wedding day

787
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,083
But I'm a man!

788
01:00:12,292 --> 01:00:14,958
Bakhtoo, they know we're not free.

789
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:18,042
Of course, you're a man.
You're the best man of all.

790
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:19,500
This is unfair!

791
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:21,958
The issue is that he ordered us
to kill Bin Al Qasim.

792
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:25,042
I will not only kill him,
I am ready to tear him to pieces.

793
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:27,792
- Did they really enter Armail?
- Yes, my princess.

794
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:30,708
After besieging it for three months.

795
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:33,625
- How is he?
- Very well.

796
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:38,292
Is his wife with him, Abu Haroun?

797
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:41,625
No, princess.
I checked myself.

798
01:00:43,292 --> 01:00:47,708
Could he have forgotten

799
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:51,333
his promise to me?

800
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:55,458
That I will always be in his heart

801
01:00:57,375 --> 01:01:00,375
and keep loving me

802
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:06,958
Love that
defies distance,

803
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:10,875
far away from me

804
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:15,792
Engulfed me with a yearning

805
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:20,125
I can't contain any more.

806
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:41,833
Is his heartbeat still eager?

807
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:48,792
Does he still long for a chance

808
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:52,583
To declare his love to me?

809
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,417
Just a glance of him

810
01:01:57,542 --> 01:02:00,375
Would fill me with joy

811
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:04,792
Creating such strong feelings

812
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:08,167
I can't contain any more

813
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:21,250
Our next stop is here: Debal.

814
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,042
The great stronghold.

815
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:27,833
They're asleep.
Come on, let's possess them.

816
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,250
let's go

817
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:36,000
He who rules Debal,
controls the whole land of Sindh.

818
01:02:36,417 --> 01:02:39,333
Our ground forces will proceed
on a path parallel to the shore.

819
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:43,458
We surround the city
and set up our giant catapult.

820
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:46,958
That will put them
between a rock and a hard place.

821
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:54,625
Finally the place is empty
and he's alone.

822
01:02:54,917 --> 01:02:59,250
Let's finish our mission quickly
so I can get back to my bride.

823
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:01,417
Come on, follow me and be quiet.

824
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:14,333
He created man from clay,
like a potter,

825
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:26,458
And he created the jinn
from a smokeless flame of fire.

826
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:30,333
He's talking about us.

827
01:03:30,917 --> 01:03:39,792
So, which of the favors of your Lord
would you deny?

828
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:44,167
I won't move from here,
pull yourself together Shamhoresh.

829
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:45,542
I can't.

830
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:51,333
Lord of the two sunrises
and Lord of the two sunsets.

831
01:03:52,458 --> 01:04:01,250
So, which of the favors of your Lord
would you deny?

832
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:03,792
Did you hear?

833
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:05,208
God is great.

834
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:07,458
- Shamhoresh?
- Yes.

835
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:11,333
- Are you crying?
- His words moved me.

836
01:04:11,833 --> 01:04:13,958
Close your ears and don't listen.

837
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:15,333
God is great.

838
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:17,625
We have to kill him
while he's kneeling.

839
01:04:17,792 --> 01:04:21,458
No, why should we kill a man
who never hurt us?

840
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:24,458
He's an enemy of our master,
our patron.

841
01:04:24,667 --> 01:04:27,833
- But he's not our enemy.
- But we are forced to do it.

842
01:04:28,542 --> 01:04:29,792
We're not free.

843
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,458
Oh company of jinn and mankind,

844
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:46,083
if you are able to pass beyond
heaven and earth, then pass.

845
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:52,458
You will not pass,
unless God allows you.

846
01:04:52,958 --> 01:05:01,292
So, which of the favors of your Lord
would you deny?

847
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:03,208
God is great.

848
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:08,833
Afrakoosh, Bardakoosh,
King of the demon sculpted

849
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:12,250
on the walls of the temple
of the sacred Shouka.

850
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:16,708
Come here before me,
I will not harm you.

851
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:21,625
Those two naughty jinn,
refuse to obey my orders.

852
01:05:22,917 --> 01:05:25,708
Damn them!
Where are they?

853
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,458
I'm free!

854
01:05:49,042 --> 01:05:51,458
I'm free!

855
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:56,667
The taste of life
is no longer bitter.

856
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:59,250
I'm free.

857
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:02,208
I'm free.

858
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:07,625
The taste of life
is no longer bitter.

859
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:20,958
No more black magic.

860
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:23,750
No more evil and bad deeds.

861
01:06:24,042 --> 01:06:28,500
I'm never going back
to harming people with magic.

862
01:06:29,042 --> 01:06:31,083
I'm free.

863
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:33,917
I'm free.

864
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:39,458
The taste of life
is no longer bitter.

865
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:44,667
How splendid is the taste of freedom!

866
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:47,417
I've desired it for so long.

867
01:06:47,708 --> 01:06:52,917
The world seems like
a river flowing with sweets.

868
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:58,167
I feel as free as a bird
keeping my conscience clean

869
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:01,000
in the silky wings of a butterfly

870
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:03,417
flying right beside me.

871
01:07:03,792 --> 01:07:05,625
I'm free.

872
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:08,583
I'm free.

873
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:14,167
The taste of life
is no longer bitter.

874
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,292
I'm free.

875
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:19,083
I'm free.

876
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:24,375
The taste of reality
is no longer bitter to me.

877
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,083
I'm free, Shamho.
Have a kiss.

878
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:29,917
Me too, Bakhtito.

879
01:07:30,167 --> 01:07:31,750
I don't like nicknames.

880
01:07:32,042 --> 01:07:35,083
You're still the same.
Fine, I'll let it go this time.

881
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:37,083
Oh man!

882
01:07:40,292 --> 01:07:41,583
My lord!

883
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:45,958
Don't leave me with this confusion
and tell me

884
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:50,500
why didn't those two
insolent demons come?

885
01:07:50,792 --> 01:07:54,542
Go back to your old tomes,
archpriest.

886
01:07:55,458 --> 01:08:00,792
And find another way to keep
worshiping your sacred Shouka.

887
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:04,042
The God of cruelty and destruction!

888
01:08:44,707 --> 01:08:46,417
I found it!

889
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,750
The magic formula!

890
01:08:53,832 --> 01:08:55,542
His majesty, King Daher.

891
01:08:58,125 --> 01:09:01,332
You lied to me, priest of destruction.

892
01:09:01,917 --> 01:09:03,792
You told me he was dead.

893
01:09:04,292 --> 01:09:08,707
And now I discover that
he's leading the Arab army!

894
01:09:09,542 --> 01:09:12,042
Please, listen to me.

895
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:14,542
Speak priest!

896
01:09:16,707 --> 01:09:24,417
No, my lord, I swear I fell victim
to my two demons' trickery, but...

897
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:26,582
More lies!

898
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:29,457
I'll go to him myself.

899
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:33,250
Are you going to fight, priest?

900
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,957
I'll kill him to prevent
the prophecy.

901
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:46,332
- What did you find Bin Wahb?
- We are close to the Debal stronghold.

902
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:50,417
I think we should camp in those woods
where there is water and pasture.

903
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:55,292
They will camp here.

904
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:56,542
So it seems.

905
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,917
I wish we could go to him, Abu Haroun.

906
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,833
Would you disobey the king?

907
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,375
I don't know Abu Haroun,
but my heart...

908
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,083
It's your father, the king.

909
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:15,042
I knew you were here, when I looked
for you and I couldn't find you.

910
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:16,417
You know, father...

911
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,750
What I know well, is that we have
an agreement with Daher.

912
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:22,792
And we have to abide by it.

913
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:24,000
But, father...

914
01:10:24,167 --> 01:10:28,208
If you don't obey my orders
I will put you in jail. Let's go!

915
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:43,417
We'll act in complete secrecy.

916
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:45,917
The fleet has reached Debal's shores

917
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:49,625
Great. Our siege is now complete.
Let's offer them peace.

918
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:52,875
Daher is a cunning criminal.
He won't accept peace.

919
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:57,042
We have to try to avoid
the horrors of war.

920
01:11:08,292 --> 01:11:11,083
How long will I stay imprisoned here?

921
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,750
Until he frees Debal.

922
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:15,875
If Bin Al Qasim is victorious

923
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:19,250
Daher and his men will flee
to the North.

924
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:24,833
Then our king will no longer be afraid
of Daher's wrath.

925
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:26,667
And I can see him?

926
01:11:27,542 --> 01:11:29,083
Yes, my daughter.

927
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:33,042
Let's hope it will happen soon.

928
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:36,833
He's back, and who knows...

929
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:42,083
If he will come to see me.

930
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:46,542
He overcomes the distance

931
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:52,458
to come closer to me.

932
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:57,333
He speaks to me, with a gaze

933
01:11:57,625 --> 01:12:01,292
that means the universe to me.

934
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:06,542
I am hostage to my own desire

935
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:10,333
and I can bear it no more.

936
01:12:12,292 --> 01:12:15,500
The polar star is there and also here.

937
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:20,083
Didn't Abu Haroun say he'd bring her
when we reach Debal?

938
01:12:20,542 --> 01:12:22,000
Yes he did.

939
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:24,000
Why didn't he keep his promise?

940
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:28,833
Maybe it's better like this.
I'll go and bring you some food.

941
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:41,375
- Have you seen the "bride"?
- What? Where is she?

942
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:46,000
Why are you shocked? I mean the
giant catapult we're standing on.

943
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:47,792
Damn you, Shamhoresh.

944
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,417
Abul Riyah built it, the one-legged man.
Do you remember him?

945
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:54,750
- Do you see what I see?
- Oh no it is him.

946
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:56,333
Will he fight?

947
01:12:56,875 --> 01:13:00,708
After he lost control of us, it seems he
will try to prevent the prophecy himself.

948
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:02,833
Bin Al Qasim is in great danger.

949
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:04,875
Stop staring at me. Come!

950
01:13:05,167 --> 01:13:06,458
- Where is he?
- There.

951
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:09,792
He's pretending to be a water seller,
that trickster.

952
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:17,167
Abul Aswad has besieged the harbor.

953
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:22,583
We're ready too. Send our messenger
to offer peace to the city.

954
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:44,792
Damn these two.

955
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:49,083
You know, brave men of Debal,

956
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:55,375
your city is fortified with walls
that can't be breached.

957
01:13:56,333 --> 01:14:00,375
It is protected by Shouka,
the God of destruction.

958
01:14:00,917 --> 01:14:06,375
And whoever tries to invade it
is doomed to disappear.

959
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:09,208
Glory to Shouka.

960
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:12,542
Glory to Shouka,
protector of Debal and Sindh.

961
01:14:12,917 --> 01:14:17,208
Have courage and hold on
and we will defeat them,

962
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:19,625
as we did before.

963
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:22,167
Death to Arabs!

964
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,542
Death to the Arabs!

965
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:28,417
My lord, they've sent a messenger
with their peace terms.

966
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:33,375
Their terms? Do you hear this,
heroes of Debal?

967
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:35,583
There will be no peace and no negotiation

968
01:14:35,667 --> 01:14:37,167
You've heard it yourself

969
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:40,250
No peace no negotiation.

970
01:14:41,958 --> 01:14:44,500
What news of the priest of destruction?

971
01:14:46,667 --> 01:14:50,792
- He doesn't get tired.
- Bakhtoo, I'm dead tired.

972
01:14:57,167 --> 01:14:58,292
Bakhtoo.

973
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:18,833
Save me, Shamhoresh. If I die
in this body, I won't come back.

974
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,667
Don't be scared.

975
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:25,917
You know, Shamhoresh,
I've not consummated my marriage yet.

976
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:33,667
I wish I had a baby jinni
to carry my legacy if I die.

977
01:15:44,042 --> 01:15:46,542
How do you think they will respond?

978
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,625
They may choose peace.

979
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:07,042
They're opening the gates.

980
01:16:38,583 --> 01:16:41,042
Is that all Bin Al Qasim can do?

981
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,750
Two degrees up.

982
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:15,667
Up two more degrees.

983
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:32,917
It's our chance, Sobha, hurry!

984
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:37,917
Archers!

985
01:17:42,417 --> 01:17:44,875
- Have you lost your mind Mohamed
- Then why are you following me?

986
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,333
I am not sure
but I won't leave you alone.

987
01:17:48,208 --> 01:17:49,708
Attack!

988
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:59,750
- What are we doing sir?
- Just trust in God and in your leader.

989
01:18:03,542 --> 01:18:04,875
Oh God! Oh God!

990
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:20,833
This isn't over

991
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:23,583
we're just starting

992
01:18:25,792 --> 01:18:31,042
Bin Al Qasim entered the city with his
men, after Daher and his men fled north.

993
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:34,292
You've long been waiting for this.

994
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:36,500
Why don't you go to him?

995
01:18:38,042 --> 01:18:39,667
I miss him so much,

996
01:18:40,542 --> 01:18:43,208
but I'd rather die,
than beg to see him.

997
01:18:45,417 --> 01:18:47,875
Who knows if he still remembers me?

998
01:18:55,625 --> 01:18:56,583
Fokha?

999
01:18:56,792 --> 01:18:59,125
Are you tired of longing for her,
my prince?

1000
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,792
I've never stopped thinking of her.

1001
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:05,708
If I were you, I would not wait.

1002
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:22,208
I've counted the nights
waiting to see you.

1003
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:25,250
I was so scared that
you would forget me.

1004
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:29,167
I spared no effort
to come back to you.

1005
01:19:29,458 --> 01:19:31,583
I can't believe you're back.

1006
01:19:31,792 --> 01:19:33,708
Will you marry me?

1007
01:19:34,292 --> 01:19:35,708
Don't cry, my love.

1008
01:19:36,083 --> 01:19:37,792
Maybe they're tears of joy.

1009
01:19:38,042 --> 01:19:41,292
After my battle with Daher,
we will get married.

1010
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:44,125
I worry for your safety from Daher
and his giant elephants.

1011
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:46,125
Don't worry, my love.

1012
01:19:46,542 --> 01:19:48,500
I've planned for everything.

1013
01:19:48,792 --> 01:19:51,417
Will you allow me to help you?

1014
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:52,792
In battle?

1015
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:56,042
- Did you forget I'm a warrior?
- I'd be worried you'd get hurt in battle.

1016
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:59,375
As long as we're together,
there's no fear.

1017
01:20:11,542 --> 01:20:15,833
Hurry up, men, we need to be done
before sunset.

1018
01:20:16,792 --> 01:20:19,000
Riders are coming from the woods.

1019
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:24,083
What are you doing here?

1020
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:29,292
We're digging a canal to collect
the seasonal rain.

1021
01:20:29,542 --> 01:20:31,458
Finish quickly and leave.

1022
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,917
We'll ambush them here.

1023
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:44,167
The main battalion
will hide behind the trees.

1024
01:20:45,167 --> 01:20:50,083
The advance guard will wait
for them by the river, here.

1025
01:20:50,333 --> 01:20:55,208
When the enemy army advances,
our knights will retreat.

1026
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:58,000
luring them into this path,

1027
01:20:58,417 --> 01:21:01,958
where we will attack them
from all sides.

1028
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:21,750
Advance!

1029
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:40,125
After them!

1030
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:44,167
I don't understand.
Do you understand any of this?

1031
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:54,917
Mohammed Bin Al Qasim left Zaid alone.
What's happening?

1032
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:11,875
They followed our men along the path.

1033
01:22:12,458 --> 01:22:15,125
It is time, attack!

1034
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,458
Perfect!

1035
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:31,208
Our plan has succeeded.
Get ready for a great victory.

1036
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,083
Advance!

1037
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:37,083
Advance!

1038
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,333
Our plan worked.

1039
01:22:50,292 --> 01:22:51,958
Hit them!

1040
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:51,333
They've overcome our men!

1041
01:24:09,833 --> 01:24:11,292
Right flank.

1042
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,792
Courage my men

1043
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:17,458
Left flank.

1044
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:50,333
- What is this?
- It's fire, my lord

1045
01:24:50,542 --> 01:24:52,625
Hold your positions.

1046
01:24:52,917 --> 01:24:55,292
Elephants are afraid of fire!

1047
01:24:55,750 --> 01:25:01,458
The fire comes from behind us. The
elephants will push the horses forward.

1048
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,833
Advance!

1049
01:25:14,667 --> 01:25:16,917
They look terrifying, Bakhtoo.

1050
01:25:32,167 --> 01:25:33,667
Show no mercy.

1051
01:25:33,792 --> 01:25:35,250
Hit them hard

1052
01:25:37,667 --> 01:25:40,125
Why are they staying still?
Why don't they move forward?

1053
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:08,583
Now!

1054
01:26:21,583 --> 01:26:22,917
Fire!

1055
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,250
Advance!

1056
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:40,583
Advance!

1057
01:26:43,833 --> 01:26:45,333
Traitors!

1058
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,833
Hold your positions

1059
01:27:04,208 --> 01:27:05,625
Don't leave me here.

1060
01:27:06,625 --> 01:27:08,667
Throw my body into the sea.

1061
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:13,417
Zaid!

1062
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:18,333
Watch out, Zaid!

1063
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:04,458
What if I defeat you, Bin Al Qasim?

1064
01:28:05,042 --> 01:28:07,917
I'll let you go
you can flee with your men.

1065
01:28:08,167 --> 01:28:09,542
And your men?

1066
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:11,542
Stay away from him.

1067
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:15,333
- But, Bin Al Qasim!
- I said stay away from him.

1068
01:29:14,125 --> 01:29:15,583
Take him prisoner.

1069
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:25,167
Sobha.

1070
01:29:26,667 --> 01:29:28,000
You did well.

1071
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:46,625
Nothing is impossible...

1072
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:54,792
Nothing is impossible!
