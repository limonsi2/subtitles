Weatherman says

13
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:42,633
we're getting six
to eight inches--

14
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:44,400
which means we can expect 12.

00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:48,200
Uh...

17
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,233
just the check, please.

18
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:50,200
Thank you.

19
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,400
You in town for the holidays?

20
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:53,133
Oh, just passing through.

21
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:54,400
Will be,

22
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:55,266
once this storm lets up.

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,633
Mm-hmm.

24
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:58,767
Do you know where I might find
a place to stay for the night?

25
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,633
Covington Creek Inn.

26
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:00,900
Just across the bridge.

27
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:02,500
Can't miss it.

28
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,967
You have yourself
a Merry Christmas.

42

Careful on those roads.

43
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,567
We still on
for Dominoes tomorrow?

44
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,734
If you promise
to go easy on me.

45
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:33,233
I'll think about it.

46
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:37,667
Any luck?

47
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,400
No, the lines are still down.

48
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:41,700
John is stuck in traffic,

49
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:42,767
and Bobby is home alone.

50
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,233
If the power goes,

51
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,667
he's gonna need help
with the generator.

52
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,133
How much longer
on your shift?

53
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,400
I'm here till 1:00.

54
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,400
I'll cover for you.

55
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,400
Head home.

56
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,133
No, Paul--

57
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,066
I still don't have
the snow tires on my car.

58
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:58,467
It's probably best to give
the plows a head start.

59
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,934
Thank you.

60
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:03,467
I will make it up to you.

61
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,834
It's fine.

62
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:06,433
Hey, are you, uh,

63
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:08,400
are you still looking
for someone to cover your shift

64
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:10,066
over Christmas?

65
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,033
I thought you were going
to your folks' for Christmas.

66
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,266
Well, we decided to stay
and do something small here.

67
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,734
Amy said that you were
talking about going home...

68
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,700
You know,
between the two of us,

69
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:22,667
we could cover your whole week.

70
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
Are you talking about
Christmas?

71
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:25,900
Yeah.

72
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,166
Let us do this for you, Paul.

73
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,767
You should go.

74
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,800
We've got incoming!

75
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:30,934
What have you got?

76
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:33,100
Pulled her from the river
about 15 minutes ago.

77
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,000
- Let's go.
- All right.

78
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,066
You know, she's lucky
you found her when you did.

79
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,667
Any longer in that water,

80
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,400
and the outcome could have been
very different.

81
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,700
She gonna be okay?

82
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:52,200
She's stable.

83
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,233
CAT scan revealed
a minor concussion.

84
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,400
Were you able
to locate her family?

85
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:58,100
She's not a local,

86
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:00,767
and we didn't recover
any identification

87
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,734
at the scene,

88
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,033
but if she did have any,

89
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,834
it's probably long gone by now.

90
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:08,066
She's alone?

91
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,300
As of now,

92
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:13,567
but we'll sure do our best
to rectify that.

93
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,333
Good night, Paul.

94
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,200
Mr. Bennett!

95
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,600
This is Carl Wagner
with Venture Insurance

96
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:37,533
with a great offer
this holiday season for you!

97
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:40,133
I'm calling with a--

98
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,967
Hey Paul! It's Ben.

99
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,800
I was just checking in

100
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:50,266
to see if there was any word
on you getting some time off.

101
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,467
We'd love to have you
down here for Christmas.

102
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,867
Hey, tell him.
Tell him what I said.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
All right, all right.
I'll let him know.

104
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,166
Marissa wants me to tell you

105
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,200
that she's making
your favorite apple pie.

106
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,367
With homemade ice cream!

107
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,667
I love you, Paulie!

108
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,266
[Ben, laughing] Okay, okay.

109
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,800
He's sufficiently bribed.

110
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:06,066
He's good.

111
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,767
Anyway, I hope to see you soon.

112
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,900
I miss you, little brother.

113
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,600
I know we have
a lot to catch up on,

114
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:16,033
but it's not all bad news,
I swear.

115
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,133
Look, we'll talk about it
when you get here.

116
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,066
Well, the sheriff
stopped by earlier.

117
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,266
He was hoping to talk
to that young woman

118
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,500
they brought in last night,

119
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,867
but she's still not up.

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,300
Were they able to figure out
who she is?

121
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:47,200
No, I guess we won't know
until she tells us.

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
Good morning!

123
00:05:55,734 --> 00:05:59,734
Let's get a little sunshine
in here for you.

124
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:07,000
Everybody's very eager
for you to wake up.

125
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,500
You see, everyone knows
everyone in this town,

126
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,500
except no one seems to know you.

127
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:13,433
For now,
you are quite the mystery.

128
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,200
Where am I?

129
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:20,200
Hey.

130
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,100
Where am I?

131
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:22,166
It's okay.

132
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,133
You're fine, you're safe.

133
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,500
You're in the hospital.

134
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:25,734
Hospital? What?

135
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:26,900
You took a little spill
last night

136
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:27,967
into the river.

137
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,333
You've got a mild concussion,

138
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:30,367
a few bumps and bruises.

139
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,467
Yeah, it's...

140
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,500
going to be sore for a bit,

141
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:34,266
but Dr. Grant's gonna come in,

142
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,367
and he's gonna give you
something for the pain, okay?

143
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,800
Now, what's your name?

144
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:42,734
Um...

145
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:47,967
I don't know.

146
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:52,500
I don't know.

147
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:53,533
Okay.

148
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:54,667
It's okay.

149
00:06:58,834 --> 00:06:59,767
I remember waking up here

150
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,500
and talking to...

151
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:03,633
Paul.

152
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:04,867
...Paul,

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,667
but when I try to remember
anything before, it...

154
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,467
there's nothing.

155
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,166
Okay.

156
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, between the impact
from your fall

157
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:17,600
and the time
spent in the water,

158
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:18,900
normally, you'd be looking
at acute trauma

159
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,000
to the temporal lobe,

160
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:23,300
which can result
in retrograde amnesia.

161
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:25,800
Amnesia?

162
00:07:25,934 --> 00:07:27,333
But...

163
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:29,500
I still remember things.

164
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:30,567
I can walk,

165
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,367
I can talk...

166
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,266
Yes, those are procedural
and motor-related,

167
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,367
likely unaffected.

168
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,967
Our minds and our bodies
do unique things

169
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,033
to protect us,

170
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,100
and to be honest,

171
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:42,033
your symptoms

172
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,500
are not even
a textbook scenario.

173
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:45,133
This is a rare case.

174
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,333
It's quite possible

175
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,533
that you're going to recall
all kinds of things

176
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,800
Just not who I am?

177
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,900
Well, do we know
how long this lasts?

178
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:58,567
There's no set time frame
for recovery.

179
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,100
The best thing you can do

180
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,000
is surround yourself
with familiar things.

181
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,467
Okay, well, do we know
how I got in the water?

182
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,033
Was there anybody with me?

183
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,967
The accident was reported
by the motorist involved.

184
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,166
It was late,

185
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,467
you were attempting
to cross the bridge alone.

186
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,834
The car turned into its skid,

187
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:16,266
and you fell
over the guard rail,

188
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,667
trying to avoid it.

189
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,500
I'm afraid we're...

190
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:22,300
we're still trying
to track down your family.

191
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:24,867
Okay, so is there anybody
looking for me?

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,066
The storm made a mess
of a lot of things out here.

193
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,800
There's power outages
all over the state.

194
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:31,066
Phone lines were down.

195
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,533
Okay, and where is here?

196
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,400
Covington. Maine.

197
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,967
Listen, for now,

198
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,734
I think the best thing
is for you to just rest up.

199
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:45,734
We'll let you know the minute
we make contact.

200
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:15,867
She had a pin
from the diner on her.

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,800
Oh, sure.

202
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:17,867
I served her last night.

203
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,934
Never did get a name, though.

204
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:20,500
Did she pay with a card?

205
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:21,800
Cash.

206
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,433
I'll be right back.
I'll give you a minute.

207
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:24,400
Did she say anything
about where she was going,

208
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:25,500
or coming from?

209
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,300
Just that she was looking
for a spot

210
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,200
to ride out the storm
for the night.

211
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,533
Oh, and, uh,
she left this behind.

212
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:33,834
I hung onto it,
in case she came back.

213
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:37,166
It seemed like
it might be important.

214
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:48,133
Paul!

215
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:49,834
Any chance I can
get a few minutes

216
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:50,834
with our Jane Doe.

217
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:51,900
Yeah, she's in room four.

218
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,133
Well, that's the thing, son.

219
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:54,934
She's not.

220
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,333
Give me a minute.

221
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,166
I like this game.

222
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,533
Doubles are always placed
cross-ways

223
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:07,667
at the end of the chain...

224
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,567
- Okay.
- Paul!

225
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,400
Pull up a chair, join us.

226
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:11,967
You are supposed to be in bed.

227
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,000
I was getting stir-crazy,

228
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:16,467
staring at the same four walls.

229
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,266
Can I put this here?

230
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,767
You don't want to do that...

231
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,233
Uh...

232
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,633
yes, you do want to do that.

233
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,400
Spoil sport.

234
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:29,667
Sheriff Crowley's here.

235
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
He needs to speak with you.

236
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:32,467
Do the police
have new information?

237
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,300
I don't know,
but just hang tight,

238
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,133
I'll grab a wheelchair, okay?

239
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:36,133
I don't need a wheelchair.

240
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,367
It's hospital policy.

241
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,533
Thank you for the game.

242
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,166
Come back any time.

243
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,633
Hey, whoa! Wait!

244
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:48,133
Are you coming?

245
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,600
Charleston, South Carolina.

246
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:57,033
That ring any bells?

247
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,467
No...

248
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,533
We think that might be
where you were headed.

249
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:07,133
"Charleston Counts Down
to Annual Tree Lighting."

250
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,400
You ducked into
Maisie's Diner last night.

251
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:13,166
You had some cherry pie
and a cup of coffee.

252
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,767
The waitress found that
on the table after you left.

253
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,200
This is all?

254
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,700
Turn it over.

255
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:23,900
"Please come.

256
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,200
Mark."

257
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:30,033
Mark...

258
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:34,133
Anything?

259
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:38,567
That's all right.

260
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,767
We reached out
to the sheriff's department

261
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,934
in Charleston.

262
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,934
They're checking in
with the festival committee,

263
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:45,900
and see if they know
who that might be.

264
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,867
In the meantime,
you hold onto that.

265
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
If anything comes back to you,

266
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:51,433
just give me a shout.

267
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:52,834
Okay.

268
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:54,367
- All right?
- Yeah.

269
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,133
I should get back to my rounds,

270
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:02,633
but is there anything
I can get you before I go?

271
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:04,767
You know what?

272
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,133
I could go for some pie.

273
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
One slice of cherry,

274
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:15,867
one hot coffee,

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,367
straight from Maisie's Diner.

276
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,667
Think it will help?

277
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Well, Dr. Grant says

278
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:21,934
I need to surround myself
with familiar things,

279
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:23,567
so...

280
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,967
Mm!

281
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,033
Nope.

282
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,300
I don't know
why anyone would drink that.

283
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:30,333
Okay, hold on.

284
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:32,533
Because I...

285
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:33,934
got you covered.

286
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:37,900
I'll try this.

287
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,567
Okay.

288
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,166
Better.

289
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,200
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

290
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:55,100
Okay. Let's see if that pie
rings any bells.

291
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,834
Needs ice cream.

292
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:12,166
I checked with Eleanor.

293
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,834
You had it plain.

294
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:14,800
No bells.

295
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:16,567
Hmm.

296
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,667
It was a good thought.

297
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,000
I just realized,

298
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:24,633
I'm not sure
what I should call you.

299
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:28,033
Well, Dr. Grant
has decided on Jane,

300
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,300
so...

301
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,066
Okay.

302
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:36,533
What's your story?

303
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,166
You want to talk about me?

304
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,233
We could talk about me,

305
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,734
but that would be
a very short conversation.

306
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,467
So, where did you grow up?

307
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,200
Did you grow up around here?

308
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,233
I'm from Georgia.

309
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:48,300
A little town called Pickering.

310
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:49,633
Do you have family there?

311
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,467
Some.

312
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,000
Are you going home
for Christmas?

313
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:58,734
I was thinking about
heading down there.

314
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:03,767
You're undecided.

315
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,867
It's complicated.

316
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,700
Well, hey,

317
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:12,467
now that Sheriff Crowley
has his first real clue,

318
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,567
you know,
it's only a matter of time

319
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,033
till somebody walks
through that door

320
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,500
and claims me.

321
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,033
Right?

322
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:20,834
Right.

323
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:23,867
I'm gonna see

324
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,467
if I can find you some ice cream
for that pie, okay?

325
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,000
Thank you.

No, they can't find anyone
who knows her.

337
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:07,100
Poor girl.

338
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:11,367
All right,

339
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,967
I think that's enough.

340
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,166
There might be
more snowflakes in here

341
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,500
than there are outside.

342
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:17,467
Thanks for your help.

343
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,033
Yeah, of course.

344
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Merry Christmas!

345
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,867
I told you I'd be home
for Christmas.

346
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,367
Dr. Grant says

347
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,800
most people
get their memories back.

348
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,333
Which means some don't.

349
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:49,867
Recovery is a long process,

350
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,633
but you're gonna get there.

351
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:55,300
I've been here almost a week.

352
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:57,033
The phone lines are back up.

353
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,433
Sheriff Crowley
has shown my picture

354
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:00,967
to half the town.

355
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,934
I don't think anybody
is looking for me.

356
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:05,533
Well, maybe
they want to be here, but...

357
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:07,033
they just can't be.

358
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,700
Why not?

359
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:10,734
Things come up.

360
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,333
People get stuck.

361
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,600
Sometimes, it's not as easy
as it should be

362
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:16,166
to get to the places
that we're needed.

363
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,066
Have you decided yet?

364
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,100
If you're going home?

365
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,967
Yeah, I, uh...

366
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,800
I actually waited too long
to decide,

367
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:31,934
so all the flights are booked.

368
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:33,266
Maybe next year.

369
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,600
I think you should.

370
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:37,867
You should go.

371
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
I know you said
it's complicated,

372
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:41,867
but no reason

373
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,467
both of us should be alone
on Christmas.

374
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:57,467
Let's get out of here.

375
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,333
Hey.

376
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:04,000
I thought your shift
ended a while ago.

377
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:05,166
It did,

378
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,266
but I just had to do
something before I left.

379
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,900
About Christmas.

380
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:11,033
Does your offer
to cover my shift

381
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,300
still stand?

382
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:13,734
Of course.

383
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:14,667
Okay, great. Thanks.

384
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,734
Yeah.

385
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,633
Hey.

386
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:19,333
I thought you'd be
on the road by now.

387
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:20,333
The car's all packed.

388
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,200
I just,
I wanted to drop this off.

389
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,200
It's a little thank you
for covering my shifts.

390
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,166
Aw, well, I am happy to do it.

391
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,667
I'm glad
you're going home, Paul.

392
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,934
It will be good for you,

393
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,100
to get to see them, and...

394
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:34,467
Anyway.

395
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,500
You have a safe trip.

396
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:39,333
You need anything at all,
you let us know.

397
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:40,533
I will.
Thank you.

398
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:43,600
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

399
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:45,100
Please, just reconsider.

400
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:46,367
At least until we can find
someone to help you.

401
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,700
You can't keep me here.

402
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,467
- I have to do this.
- What's going on?

403
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,033
They told me you left.

404
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,300
I was just about to.

405
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:53,233
Where are you going?

406
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:54,166
Nowhere.

407
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,100
I can't just sit here

408
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:57,300
and wait for somebody
to find me.

409
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:58,934
I've tried that,
and it's not working.

410
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:00,700
Releasing you
in your current condition

411
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:02,367
is not in your best interest.

412
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,834
Before I fell in that water,

413
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:06,200
I was on my way
to the tree-lighting ceremony.

414
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,367
I will find my answers there.

415
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
I know I will,

416
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:10,066
and you were the one
that told me

417
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,233
I need to surround myself
with familiar things.

418
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,233
I can't do that here.

419
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:16,367
Christmas Eve is in two days.

420
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,533
I can't wait any longer.

421
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,233
How do you expect
to get there?

422
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,367
South Carolina is a long way.

423
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,667
I will pawn my watch,

424
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,934
buy a plane ticket.

425
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:25,834
They will never let you
on the flight.

426
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:27,200
You don't have I.D.

427
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,200
I will find a way.

428
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,600
That is where I was going.

429
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:31,333
and that is where I will go.

430
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:33,467
I could take her.

431
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:37,934
It's on my way.

432
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:40,000
You'd really do that?

433
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:43,734
You need to get home.

434
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:44,800
So do I.

435
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,533
All right, follow me.

436
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:55,367
We'll get your paperwork
started.

437
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,834
Are you sure about this, son?

438
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:29,333
Okay, this has
three hours on it,

439
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:31,367
but you can always add more.

440
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,200
I put the station's number
in there

441
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,533
as one of your contacts,

442
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,867
so you can stay up to date
on things going on back here.

443
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,700
Now, listen,

444
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,834
if you get
to the tree lighting,

445
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:43,467
and you don't find
what you're looking for,

446
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,967
the second contact in there

447
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,667
is Sheriff Connie Hargrove
from Charleston.

448
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,400
She'll be expecting your call.

449
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:51,967
I really appreciate this.

450
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,667
My pleasure.

451
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,667
Now, is there
anything else you need?

452
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,000
Clothing, or...

453
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,233
No, no,
we've got that covered.

454
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:01,500
We ran over to the store.

455
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:03,934
Bertie took a peek
at your tags.

456
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:05,367
Should be the right sizes.

457
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,233
Yup.

458
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:07,667
What?

459
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Oh, and a little pocket money,

460
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,934
to get you where you're going.

461
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:12,367
We took up a collection.

462
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,400
Um...

463
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:15,600
Thank you, guys

464
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:18,567
Thank you, that's, um...

465
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:21,934
Merry Christmas.

466
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:23,567
Thank you!

467
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,600
Merry Christmas.

468
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,033
Wow!

469
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,834
I need to make a few
adjustments to our route

470
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:30,266
if we're gonna make it
to that tree lighting

471
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,467
on the 24th.

472
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,533
I was able to get another room
at the B&B tonight,

473
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,400
but still nothing for tomorrow.

474
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:36,734
Everything's all booked up.

475
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:38,800
Thank you for doing this.

476
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:40,233
It'll be fun!

477
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,834
Be nice to have a co-pilot.

478
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,900
Someone to read the map,
in case I get lost.

479
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:45,700
Do you plan on getting lost?

480
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:47,767
No one plans on getting lost.

481
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:50,767
Hey, thanks for that tree.

482
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,533
I know it was you.

483
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,300
Might have been Santa.

484
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:55,900
This is me.

485
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:59,400
I know that
she doesn't look like much,

486
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:00,567
but she'll get us
where we need to be.

487
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,000
Hey, I promise
I'll pay you back.

488
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:07,700
I'm gonna pay everybody back.

489
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:08,967
You know,
once we get to Charleston,

490
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,033
and I find my life again.

491
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,133
I know.

492
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:29,600
What's in Covington?

493
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,967
What do you mean?

494
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,667
Like, what are you guys
known for?

495
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,867
Ah.

496
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Well, we are 20 minutes
from the Canadian border.

497
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:40,033
Population under 5,000.

498
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,266
Okay.

499
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,767
So if I was going
to South Carolina for Christmas,

500
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,633
what was I doing
all the way up here?

501
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,033
Maybe you were on a work trip.

502
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,533
In the middle of nowhere?

503
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:55,266
Covington isn't nowhere.

504
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,166
Hmm.

505
00:22:58,133 --> 00:23:00,500
It's just north of nowhere.

506
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:02,266
Mm-hmm.

507
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,533
Any idea
how you're going to find Mark?

508
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:15,567
When you get there?

509
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,367
I'm hoping he'll find me.

510
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,300
Who do you think he is?

511
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:25,066
Relative?

512
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,400
A friend?

513
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,333
A husband.

514
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:34,066
It never occurred to you
that you might be married?

515
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,066
Well, I don't have a ring.

516
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,133

come on the radio,

and it just...

527
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,233
hits a little

528
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:16,433
Oh, they didn't
give us napkins.

529
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,066
Glove compartment.

My brother.

Oh, you have a brother?

534
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:32,433
Is he older or younger?

535
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:33,600
He's older.

536
00:24:33,734 --> 00:24:35,433
Is that who you're spending
Christmas with?

537
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:39,467
I missed last Christmas.

538
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,233
I couldn't miss another one.

539
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:42,433

00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:44,333
Thank you.

541
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:47,433
Trade you an onion ring
for a french fry?

542
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:48,266
Yes, please.

543
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,600
Okay.

544
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:52,700

I'm Barbara.

551
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:32,734
We spoke on the phone.

552
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:33,800
Sorry for the late check-in.

553
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:35,433
Oh, sometimes
it takes us longer

554
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,633
to get where we're going--

555
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:39,066
especially round the holidays.

556
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,600
Um, first door and second door
at the top of the stairs.

557
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:43,467
Great. Thank you.

558
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,333
Have a good evening.

559
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:46,433
Good night.

560
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:53,667
Uh, come in.

561
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,700
Hey.

562
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,500
If it's okay,

563
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,333
I'd like to be on the road
by 8:00 in the morning.

564
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:01,133
Yeah, of course.

565
00:26:02,934 --> 00:26:04,166
"Beyond Tomorrow"?

566
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:07,133
Oh, yeah.
I just turned it on.

567
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,633
Have you seen it?

568
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,767
I used to watch this
with my parents.

569
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,533
Yes, well,
I'm broad enough now.

570
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,066
Is that your laugh?

571
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,000
No.

572
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,133
It is.

573
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:22,367
- No, it's not--
- There's no use denying it.

574
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,600
We both heard it, that was it.

575
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:27,867
This does not leave this room.

576
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,066
It's okay.

577
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,133
Oh, there it is again.

578
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,934
I like it.
It's a good laugh.

579
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,800
Hey, do you want
to watch this with me?

580
00:26:35,934 --> 00:26:38,700
Yeah.

581
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:41,967
...or you get sick
or something,

582
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,533
don't forget we're friends.

583
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,100
You'll let me know
if you need me, won't you?

584
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:47,700
How can she just leave him?

585
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:50,233
I mean, after all
they've been through?

586
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:55,033
I guess she thinks
it will make him happy.

587
00:26:57,734 --> 00:26:59,266
It's getting late.

588
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,300
You should get some rest.

589
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:02,166
I'm not tired.

590
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,800
Yeah, my mistake...

591
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,934
Good night, Jane.

592
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,266
Good night, Paul.

594
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,667

Yeah, my flight

600
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,667
I'm excited to see you, too.

601
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,266
I have some news.

602
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:19,500
Good morning.

603
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:21,500
Good morning.

604
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,166
Thanks.

605
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,533
Wow, this looks great.

606
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,700
Is everything all right?

607
00:28:28,734 --> 00:28:30,133
Fine.

608
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:37,133
I think I remembered something.

609
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:38,000
What was it?

610
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,133
I'm not sure.

611
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:41,700
It was a phone call.

612
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,567
I don't know,
it went really fast,

613
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,767
and it was hard to understand.

614
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,166
It's a good thing, right?

615
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,633
It means your memory
is starting to come back.

616
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:50,834
Yeah, I mean,

617
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:53,333
I was thinking
it would come back at once,

618
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:55,934
not in small, little,
confusing pieces.

619
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:57,300
Well, enough little pieces
come back,

620
00:28:57,433 --> 00:28:58,800
eventually, you'll have
the bigger picture.

621
00:28:58,934 --> 00:29:00,000
Good morning.

622
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:01,033
Morning.

623
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,166
I hope you slept well.

624
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,133
Great, thank you.

625
00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:04,500
When you've finished,

626
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:06,633
you're welcome
to help decorate the tree.

627
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:09,200
Thank you for the invitation,

628
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,734
but we've got a really big day
ahead of us on the road.

629
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:13,967
Of course, I understand.

630
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,800
Um, well, when you're all ready,

631
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:17,233
I'll get you all checked out.

632
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:25,233
We can't let her decorate
that whole Christmas tree

633
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:26,500
by herself.

634
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:27,834
We don't have time.

635
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,400
Maybe one of the other guests
will help her.

636
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:31,233
Um...

637
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:34,100
There's no other guests.

638
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:38,300
Okay.

639
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:42,233
So, someone's waiting for you
at this tree lighting?

640
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:43,834
That's the hope.

641
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:46,266
And you really
don't remember anything?

642
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:49,300
No.

643
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:54,533
Oh...

644
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,967
Did you make this?

645
00:29:58,333 --> 00:29:59,667
No, that's...

646
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,734
my late husband Martin's
handiwork.

647
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:04,200
He carved a new one
every Christmas.

648
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:14,300
You're not going to put it
on the tree?

649
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:17,867
No, it was
a tradition we shared.

650
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,734
It doesn't feel right
to do it without him.

651
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,667
Now, um...

652
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,300
would you care
to do the honors?

653
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:26,300
Me?

654
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:27,667
You're the tallest one,

655
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,600
and I don't have a step stool.

656
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,500
Sure.

657
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:35,700
Aw...

658
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,467
Do you always
make your own bows?

659
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,433
I had Martin
pick out the ribbons.

660
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:43,567
For the first 20 years
of our marriage,

661
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,200
I couldn't talk him into
anything besides plain red.

662
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,066
"Nothing wrong
with the classics,"

663
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,467
he used to say

664
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,367
Perhaps what
you're going through

665
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,633
is a blessing.

666
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,333
You've got a clean slate.

667
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:05,066
There's no melancholy
memories to dwell on.

668
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,000
No regrets.

669
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,133
No happy memories, either.

670
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:26,800
So we're gonna have to skip
our lunch stop

671
00:31:26,934 --> 00:31:29,433
if we want to make it
to Lexington by 8:00.

672
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:31,033
It was worth it, though,
wasn't it?

673
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:33,066
Yeah, it was.

674
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,033
Oh, good!

675
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:37,233
I didn't miss you.

676
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,000
Just a little something for you.

677
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:42,266
I thought it might help

678
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,767
to write down
what you know about yourself.

679
00:31:44,867 --> 00:31:47,433
Keep it all sorted out.

680
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,867
The North Star

681
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:52,867
has guided many
a weary traveler home again.

682
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:54,233
Thank you.

683
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,233
You stay strong.

684
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:57,867
You keep your chin up.

685
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,400
God gives
the strongest soldiers

686
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,133
the toughest battles.

687
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,934
Merry Christmas.

688
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,667
Merry Christmas.

689
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,233
Nellie, I know you.

690
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,333
There's no way anyone
gets out of your booth

691
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:20,767
without giving up
their life story.

692
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,767
Not this one.

693
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,533
She was real quiet.

694
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:27,166
Honestly,
she seemed a little blue.

695
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,767
You told my deputy
that she had a purse

696
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,633
and a suitcase.

697
00:32:30,767 --> 00:32:31,934
Mm-hmm, that's right.

698
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:34,200
But you can't describe
either of them?

699
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:40,633
The suitcase was...

700
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:41,767
purple,

701
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,233
and it had letters on it.

702
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:44,600
Letters?
What do you mean?

703
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:46,166
A monogram?

704
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,166
An "R" maybe, or a "B"?

705
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,166
All right, well,
we have a purple suitcase,

706
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,166
and a monogram.

707
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,000
Anything else, Sheriff?

708
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:57,934
Yeah, how about some of
that famous homemade pie?

709
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,900
Now, you know as well as I do

710
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:05,300
that river stretches for miles.

711
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:08,900
That bag might be halfway
to the Piscataqua by now.

712
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:09,900
Yeah, it could be.

713
00:33:10,033 --> 00:33:13,066
Now, how about that pie?

714
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,934
You got it, Sheriff.

715
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:38,533
Any news from Sheriff Crowley?

716
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:40,567
Um, he said that
they put out an alert

717
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,567
on the suitcases
I was carrying,

718
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,700
and one had a monogram.

719
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:47,000
Then you must have
someone in your life.

720
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:48,500
What?

721
00:33:48,633 --> 00:33:49,934
No one buys themselves
monogrammed luggage.

722
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:52,567
Hmm.

723
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,467
What are these?

724
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,700
Ah, okay,

725
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,200
you are about to make
a very important self-discovery.

726
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,367
Are you an eggnog
kind of person,

727
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,100
or hot cocoa?

728
00:34:03,233 --> 00:34:05,066
Well, what are you?

729
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,300
I don't want to unduly
influence your selection.

730
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:09,033
Okay.

731
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:09,834
That.

732
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:10,700
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

733
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:12,066
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,000
Okay.

735
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:16,367
So?

736
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,066
- It's good.
- Good.

737
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,467
- It's good.
- Yeah?

738
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,700
Yeah.

739
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:21,734
So you're really
not going to tell me

740
00:34:21,867 --> 00:34:22,967
which one you prefer?

741
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:23,800
No.

742
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:25,033
That's not fair.

743
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,300
Can't let you hog
all the mystery.

744
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,567
You want the cocoa, don't you?

745
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,700
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

746
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:34,700
Oh, the guy at the counter

747
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:36,834
gave me a lead
on a hotel for the night,

748
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:37,900
and I already looked it up.

749
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,934
Hi.

750
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:44,600
Yeah, I would like to book
two rooms

751
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:46,133
for this evening.

752
00:34:46,266 --> 00:34:48,266
I know it's almost Christmas,

753
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,834
but your website
listed a vacancy?

754
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:55,233
I understand.

755
00:34:55,367 --> 00:34:59,066
Merry Christmas to you, too.

756
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:02,533
Well, this might be
more difficult than I thought.

757
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,300
We could sleep in the car.

758
00:35:04,433 --> 00:35:05,834
We're not going
to sleep in the car.

759
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:07,233
Well, then,
what are we going to do?

760
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:11,000
I have some family nearby.

761
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:12,033
Just outside of Charlottesville,

762
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:12,967
maybe an hour.

763
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
- Really?
- Yeah,

764
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:15,500
my cousin, Jack,
and his wife, Katie.

765
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:17,266
Do you think that
they'd let us spend the night?

766
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,200
Unless you'd rather we didn't?

767
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,967
No, I'll make the call.

768
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:28,667
Okay.

769
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:44,633
Merry Christmas!

770
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,600
Come in, come in.

771
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:46,934
Thank you so much
for having us.

772
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:48,066
I know it was last minute...

773
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,066
Oh, are you kidding me?

774
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,233
We're happy to have you!

775
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:51,867
Uh, sweetheart?
Paul's here!

776
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,100
Katie made up the couch
in the den.

777
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:55,400
I could take the couch.

778
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:57,100
You've done
so much for me already.

779
00:35:57,233 --> 00:35:59,367
It's probably better
for my back, anyway.

780
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,100
Paul...

781
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:02,467
Merry Christmas!

782
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,467
We've missed you!

783
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,834
This is my friend, Jane.

784
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:07,200
You have such a lovely home.

785
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,166
Oh, thank you.

786
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,500
It's so nice to meet you.

787
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:10,500
Come with me,

788
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:11,333
I'll show you to your room.

789
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:13,367
Oh, thank you.

790
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,333
I'm glad you're here.

791
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:18,166
It's been too long.

792
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,700
Um...

793
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:22,000
I want you to know,

794
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:25,100
we all understood
why you did what you did.

795
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:29,500
I know you think
you have to carry this alone--

796
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:30,834
Paul!

797
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:31,934
Hey, bud!

798
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:33,100
How are you?

799
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,433
He's only asked
when you were getting here

800
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,667
every 15 minutes.

801
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,100
I got a new sled!

802
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:37,900
Do you wanna see?

803
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:39,033
Yeah.

804
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:41,033
Why don't you help Paul
with his bags first?

805
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,300
Okay.

806
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:43,800
You got it?

807
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:49,533
So how do you and Paul
know each other?

808
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:51,500
We met at the hospital.

809
00:36:51,633 --> 00:36:54,367
I thought you two were...?

810
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,967
Well, I thought
the two of you...

811
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,667
Oh, no! No.

812
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,433
Uh, we're just, um...

813
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:01,867
We're friends.

814
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:04,400
Oh.

815
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:05,934
Yeah.

816
00:37:06,066 --> 00:37:07,000
When are you due?

817
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:08,567
Three more months.

818
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,734
Can't come soon enough.

819
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:11,266
I am ready for this little guy
to join us.

820
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,100
It's a boy?

821
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,934
We thought about
keeping it a surprise,

822
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,000
but that lasted
until my third sonogram.

823
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:20,867
Hey, are you sure
I can't help?

824
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,367
No, I am almost finished.

825
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,667
Uh, hand me that can
of cream of mushroom soup?

826
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:27,900
Thank you.

827
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,033
All right, everyone, dig in!

828
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,233
I know what I'm starting with.

829
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:43,266
These scalloped potatoes
look amazing.

830
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,433
Well, Jane helped.

831
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,066
I just handed you the can.

832
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,834
So how's the little guy?

833
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,433
He's finally asleep.

834
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:53,100
Oh, good.

835
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:55,066
This pie is out of this world,

836
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,900
and, apparently, I know my pies.

837
00:37:57,033 --> 00:37:57,900
Jack's a chef.

838
00:37:58,033 --> 00:37:59,000
Really?

839
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:02,400
I work downtown
at a hotel off the square.

840
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:03,500
Have you ever considered

841
00:38:03,633 --> 00:38:05,166
opening up a restaurant
or something?

842
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,266
As a matter of fact,
he found the perfect location.

843
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,300
We have a baby on the way.

844
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:12,767
The restaurant can wait.

845
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,767
He said the same thing
when Charlie was born.

846
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,166
It wasn't the right time.

847
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,600
You know, you never know
what life will bring,

848
00:38:18,734 --> 00:38:20,433
so why save dreams for tomorrow

849
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:21,934
when there is
a perfectly good today?

850
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:22,934
Right?

851
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:24,000
Right.

852
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:25,467
So...

853
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,066
have you settled on any names?

854
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:32,600
We were thinking about,
um... Ben.

855
00:38:32,734 --> 00:38:33,967
Oh.

856
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,300
Like your brother?

857
00:38:36,433 --> 00:38:37,333
Yeah...

858
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,333
Well, I'm sure
that he's very flattered.

859
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:41,934
Have you told him yet?

860
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:45,233
Ben passed away last January.

861
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:52,000
Just, uh...

862
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:54,800
excuse me for a second.

863
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:59,066
Uh, I'd better go see
if he's all right.

864
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,734
Just...

865
00:39:00,867 --> 00:39:03,100
give him a minute.

866
00:39:24,934 --> 00:39:27,567
Why didn't you say anything?

867
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,467
You've got your own problems.

868
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,266
You don't need to listen
to mine.

869
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,934
I'd like to.

870
00:39:44,433 --> 00:39:46,133
I wasn't there.

871
00:39:50,133 --> 00:39:53,133
I was supposed to visit
last Christmas.

872
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,367
I spent every Christmas
with Ben and his wife,

873
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,300
but I couldn't get work off.

874
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,700
At least
that's what I told them.

875
00:40:06,834 --> 00:40:09,433
That's what I told myself.

876
00:40:16,734 --> 00:40:19,266
Truth is,

877
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,734
it was really hard
to see him that way.

878
00:40:23,867 --> 00:40:25,934
You know, sick.

879
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:31,133
I see that kind of thing
every day at work,

880
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:32,834
but...

881
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:35,000
it's different...

882
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,600
when it's someone you love.

883
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:42,800
You know, he was doing good.

884
00:40:42,934 --> 00:40:44,800
He was doing
really, really good,

885
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:48,500
fighting the cancer.

886
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:52,033
It was just that one Christmas.

887
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:57,233
You know, I just told myself
I needed more time...

888
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,467
I thought I had more time.

889
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:21,200
You know, I've never
told anyone that before.

890
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:24,600
I'm so sorry.

891
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,367
I have the gift
that I bought him last year,

892
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,900
and I'm bringing it to him,

893
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:36,467
to say goodbye.

894
00:42:24,066 --> 00:42:25,166
Couldn't sleep?

895
00:42:29,867 --> 00:42:31,633
Did you remember something?

896
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:35,100
Oh, no, this, um...

897
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:37,533
I'm writing a story.

898
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:38,600
A story?

899
00:42:38,734 --> 00:42:40,867
Yeah.

900
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,133
I can't remember anything
about my own life,

901
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:46,567
but I just keep having
all these thoughts

902
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,266
springing up.

903
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,333
I needed to put them
somewhere, so...

904
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:53,934
After I started,
I just couldn't stop.

905
00:42:54,066 --> 00:42:55,300
Can I read it?

906
00:42:55,433 --> 00:42:56,867
Uh, maybe-- No.

907
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,700
Maybe when it's done,
but no.

908
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,333
How about you?

909
00:43:04,467 --> 00:43:06,934
I just needed
a glass of water.

910
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:09,700
Is that it?

911
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,967
I guess not.

912
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:20,200
Would it help
to talk about him?

913
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:23,467
What was he like?

914
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,934
He was great.

915
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:26,934
Smart, kind.

916
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:27,934
Really outdoorsy.

917
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:29,467
Loved fishing.

918
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,300
In fact,

919
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:33,033
I think I have...

920
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:37,367
Yeah, there.

921
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,967
We rented a cabin on a lake
a few years back.

922
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,100
Oh, my gosh,
how big is that fish?

923
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:42,433
It's not that big,

924
00:43:42,567 --> 00:43:43,633
but it was bigger
than anything I'd caught,

925
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:45,800
and he definitely didn't let me
forget about that.

926
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,533
Oh, this is at the graduation
from my nursing school.

927
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:56,033
Seems like
he was really proud of you.

928
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,133
Yeah.

929
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:58,767
I guess so.

930
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,100
I haven't looked at these
in a long time.

931
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:07,967
Do you have more?

932
00:44:09,867 --> 00:44:12,066
Yeah. Sure.

933
00:44:20,734 --> 00:44:22,100
Hey, Paul.

934
00:44:22,233 --> 00:44:23,233
Hey.

935
00:44:23,367 --> 00:44:26,100
About last night.

936
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:27,900
I didn't mean to upset you.

937
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:30,100
You know, I thought
it would be easier,

938
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:32,567
to just push
the memories of him away,

939
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,667
but...

940
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:36,867
...it was like losing him
all over again.

941
00:44:38,834 --> 00:44:39,700
I don't want to forget him.

942
00:44:39,834 --> 00:44:41,100
Ben is a great name,

943
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:43,166
and he would be honored
if you chose it.

944
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,533
Are you sure you can't stay
a little longer?

945
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,433
No, we need to hit the road

946
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:47,967
if we're gonna
make it to Charleston by 7:00.

947
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,433
Listen,

948
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:51,533
you should think about
the restaurant,

949
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:52,834
like Jane said.

950
00:44:52,967 --> 00:44:54,166
Don't wait.

951
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,767
All right,
I should head up there,

952
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,767
see if she's ready.

953
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,100
Oh, you won't find her there.

954
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:01,266
She's playing with Charlie
in the backyard.

955
00:45:12,066 --> 00:45:13,133
Whoa!

956
00:45:13,266 --> 00:45:14,200
You!

957
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,367
Hey, come on! Come on!

958
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,033
Okay.

959
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:20,800
Oh...

960
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:21,700
you gave up our position.

961
00:45:21,834 --> 00:45:22,600
We don't have much time.

962
00:45:22,734 --> 00:45:23,800
What?

963
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:25,600
On the count of three,
I go right, you go left.

964
00:45:25,734 --> 00:45:26,600
You with me?

965
00:45:26,734 --> 00:45:28,433
Yeah, I'm with you.

966
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:29,433
Okay.

967
00:45:29,567 --> 00:45:30,967
One, two, three,

968
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,166
go!

969
00:45:34,233 --> 00:45:35,667
Get him, get him, get him!

970
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:48,800
Yay!

971
00:45:48,934 --> 00:45:50,967
You give us a call
when you're all settled in.

972
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,133
Will do.

973
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:53,767
It was real nice to meet you.

974
00:45:53,934 --> 00:45:54,767
Don't be a stranger.

975
00:45:54,934 --> 00:45:55,734
I won't.

976
00:45:56,867 --> 00:45:59,867
Sorry, I'm not as fast
as I used to be.

977
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,467
- Merry Christmas, Paul.
- Merry Christmas.

978
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,467
It's been so nice
to see you like this.

979
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,667
Happy.

980
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:12,133
I thought you could use this.

981
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:14,867
Oh, my gosh, thank you.

982
00:46:14,967 --> 00:46:16,033
It's all good.

983
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:17,467
Thank you, thank you
so much for having us.

984
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,200
Any time.

985
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:20,967
Okay, well, merry Christmas.

986
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,000
Thanks so much.

987
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:23,133
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

988
00:46:23,266 --> 00:46:24,000
Can I take that for you?

989
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:25,333
- Sure.
- Great.

990
00:46:25,467 --> 00:46:27,467
Hey, do you want me to drive?

991
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,000
You don't have a license.

992
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:30,166
Well, it's not fair

993
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,667
that you need to drive
the entire way.

994
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,233
Well, it might not be fair,
but it's legal.

995
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:34,667
You can barely
keep your eyes open.

996
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,767
My eyes are fine.

997
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,734
I'm gonna take these,
thank you so much.

998
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,300
Wait, wait, wait.

999
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:44,133
Please don't do this.

1000
00:46:45,633 --> 00:46:47,033
Jane...

1001
00:46:50,233 --> 00:46:51,266
You okay?

1002
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:53,433
Yeah, I'm fine.

1003
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:54,367
Uh...

1004
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,266
You know what, you're right.

1005
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,734
You should drive.

1006
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:14,367
You have quite the arm.

1007
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,767
I wonder
if you used to play baseball.

1008
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:25,066
We need gas.

1009
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,033
We should probably stop up here.

1010
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:28,600
Grab lunch?

1011
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,367
We're making great time.

1012
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,400
Yeah, it's not that.

1013
00:47:43,533 --> 00:47:45,033
It's just...

1014
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:47,967
I remember something else.

1015
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,767
What was it?

1016
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,266
I was in a house,

1017
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,600
and there was a man there,

1018
00:47:52,734 --> 00:47:54,367
and I was leaving.

1019
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,233
It felt like
we got in a fight?

1020
00:47:57,367 --> 00:47:59,433
Who was he to you?

1021
00:47:59,567 --> 00:48:00,433
I don't know.

1022
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:03,734
Do you think
it's the same person

1023
00:48:03,867 --> 00:48:05,066
from the letters?

1024
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,033
Mark?

1025
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:07,100
Maybe.

1026
00:48:07,233 --> 00:48:09,133
He just, he looked hurt.

1027
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:12,400
It looked like I hurt him,
or something.

1028
00:48:12,533 --> 00:48:14,166
I don't know, I just,
I never...

1029
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,900
I've been so desperate
to fill these blanks,

1030
00:48:16,033 --> 00:48:17,300
you know,
I haven't stopped to consider

1031
00:48:17,433 --> 00:48:21,233
that maybe I might not like
what I find.

1032
00:48:21,367 --> 00:48:22,800
You know, maybe my subconscious

1033
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:24,133
is trying to hide something
from me.

1034
00:48:24,266 --> 00:48:26,500
Like...

1035
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:29,834
what if I'm just
a terrible person?

1036
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:31,066
You're not a terrible person.

1037
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,233
Well, how do you know that?

1038
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,166
Because I know you.

1039
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,700
I don't even know me.

1040
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:38,867
You don't see it, do you?

1041
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,400
The effect that you have
on people.

1042
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:43,467
You...

1043
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,333
you've got this light in you.

1044
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:48,700
It's obvious to anyone

1045
00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:50,000
who spends
five minutes with you.

1046
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:53,633
You may have made
some mistakes in the past--

1047
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:55,500
we all have--

1048
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:59,233
but it doesn't define
who you are in the future.

1049
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:01,867
You know,
mistakes can be forgiven.

1050
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:18,400
Are you working on your story?

1051
00:49:18,533 --> 00:49:19,367
Yeah.

1052
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,834
Trying to figure out the ending.

1053
00:49:20,967 --> 00:49:21,834
I hope it's a happy one.

1054
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:23,033
Me too.

1055
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:30,300
Stonestreet Inn.

1056
00:49:30,433 --> 00:49:32,266
Confirming my reservation.

1057
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:34,400
Stonestreet Inn?

1058
00:49:34,533 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah, it's the nicest hotel
in Pickering.

1059
00:49:37,133 --> 00:49:38,166
To be fair,

1060
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,166
it's the only hotel
in Pickering,

1061
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,667
but it's still very nice.

1062
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,133
Well, I thought that you'd be
staying with family.

1063
00:49:47,133 --> 00:49:49,467
My parents passed
a few years ago.

1064
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,066
Well, what about
your sister-in-law?

1065
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,033
We haven't spoken.

1066
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,734
Why not?

1067
00:49:58,533 --> 00:50:00,734
It's like I said,

1068
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:03,533
I wasn't there for Ben.

1069
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,834
Marissa was furious.

1070
00:50:05,967 --> 00:50:07,166
I don't blame her.

1071
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,400
Well, so you're going
all the way home

1072
00:50:08,533 --> 00:50:09,734
and you're not
going to see anyone?

1073
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,500
I'm going to see my brother.

1074
00:50:14,367 --> 00:50:16,233
You just told me

1075
00:50:16,367 --> 00:50:19,233
that mistakes can be forgiven.

1076
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:24,433
Some can.

1077
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:27,433
This one can't.

1078
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,834
I'll get this.

1079
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,233
Traffic looks good.

1080
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:12,233
We should hit Charleston
by 6:00.

1081
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:13,633
Close your eyes.

1082
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:15,934
Close your eyes.

1083
00:51:16,066 --> 00:51:18,333
Hold out your hands.

1084
00:51:20,934 --> 00:51:21,734
Open them.

1085
00:51:23,033 --> 00:51:23,934
What's this for?

1086
00:51:24,066 --> 00:51:25,533
A gift.

1087
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:26,667
Try it on.

1088
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,934
Come on!

1089
00:51:28,066 --> 00:51:29,166
Come on.

1090
00:51:35,867 --> 00:51:37,367
How do I look?

1091
00:51:38,467 --> 00:51:40,900
Something to remember me by.

1092
00:51:41,033 --> 00:51:42,633
Come on.

1093
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:44,533
Let's head back to the car.

00:51:52,033 --> 00:51:55,600

You ready?

1114
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,533
Ready.

1115
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:47,934
Don't worry,

1116
00:52:48,066 --> 00:52:48,800
it does this sometimes.

1117
00:52:48,934 --> 00:52:49,967
You just gotta--

1118
00:53:04,967 --> 00:53:07,700
Well, could be a few things.

1119
00:53:07,834 --> 00:53:09,533
Best-case scenario,
it's a shot battery.

1120
00:53:09,667 --> 00:53:11,367
Worst-case scenario?

1121
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,734
If it's the alternator,

1122
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:13,900
you need to leave it here
for a day or two,

1123
00:53:14,033 --> 00:53:15,133
while we hunt down the part.

1124
00:53:15,266 --> 00:53:16,533
Oh, no, we don't have
a day or two.

1125
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:17,633
We cannot get stuck here.

1126
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:18,834
Is there anything
that you can do?

1127
00:53:18,967 --> 00:53:21,567
I was just about to lock up
when I got the call.

1128
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,734
It's Christmas Eve.

1129
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:23,867
I know it's a lot to ask,

1130
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,200
but it would really
mean a lot to us

1131
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:26,433
if you could help us out.

1132
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:28,467
Please.

1133
00:53:30,266 --> 00:53:31,867
All right.

1134
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,367
Tell you what,

1135
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,233
leave your number on the pad.

1136
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:36,367
Give me an hour.

1137
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,367
I can't promise anything,

1138
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,133
but I'll do the best I can.

1139
00:53:39,266 --> 00:53:41,700
Right.
Thank you so much.

1140
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:42,900
Yup.

1141
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,033
We don't have time for this.

1142
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:49,533
The mechanic said
it would be an hour.

1143
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:50,967
We'll be back on the road
by 4:30.

1144
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,734
We'll be cutting it close,
but we'll get there.

1145
00:53:53,867 --> 00:53:56,367
Yeah, that's if he can fix it.

1146
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,734
The tree lighting ends at 8:00.

1147
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:01,367
What if anybody who knows me
is gone before I can get there?

1148
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,967
Then I'm back
to where I started.

1149
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,033
What...

1150
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:06,700

1169
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:29,333
Hi, buddy.

1170
00:55:29,467 --> 00:55:31,667
Where did you come from?

1171
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,133
Do you see his owner?

1172
00:55:33,266 --> 00:55:34,600
Uh...

1173
00:55:34,734 --> 00:55:36,367
no.

1174
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,600
Are you lost?

1175
00:55:38,734 --> 00:55:40,667
Yeah, I know the feeling.

1176
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,633
Check his collar,

1177
00:55:41,767 --> 00:55:42,767
see if his address is on there.

1178
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,166
Okay.

1179
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,166
No, wait, stop!

1180
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,000
No!

1181
00:55:46,133 --> 00:55:47,133
Wait!

1182
00:55:47,266 --> 00:55:48,467
Wait!

1183
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,133
The plow guy found this

1184
00:55:56,266 --> 00:55:57,767
while he was salting
the back roads.

1185
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,567
Recognized it
from the description we put out.

1186
00:56:01,767 --> 00:56:03,400
We have a few articles
of clothing in here.

1187
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:06,200
We've got a t-shirt,

1188
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:09,500
a pair of jeans.

1189
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,700
See what you can pull
off of that.

1190
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:18,800
It's been in the river
for a few days.

1191
00:56:18,934 --> 00:56:21,700
Yeah, well, it's worth a shot.

1192
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:24,367
Huh.

1193
00:56:31,033 --> 00:56:32,867
What do you make of that?

1194
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,900
I don't know,

1195
00:56:34,033 --> 00:56:35,433
maybe she's got
a little one at home.

1196
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:37,667
Should we call our Jane Doe?

1197
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,767
No.

1198
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,033
No, let's see what we get
off the laptop first.

1199
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:42,533
Okay.

1200
00:56:48,533 --> 00:56:52,066
There's no car in the driveway.

1201
00:56:53,233 --> 00:56:54,200
It's Christmas.

1202
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:56,467
They might be away.

1203
00:56:58,533 --> 00:56:59,233
Sorry!

1204
00:56:59,367 --> 00:57:01,433
Can I help you?

1205
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,967
Oh!

1206
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:05,900
Oh, sweetheart!

1207
00:57:06,033 --> 00:57:09,133
We were so worried about you.

1208
00:57:09,266 --> 00:57:10,266
He slipped through the fence
last night.

1209
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,800
My son's been looking for him
all morning.

1210
00:57:11,934 --> 00:57:13,066
Where did you find him?

1211
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,300
Outside the church.

1212
00:57:14,433 --> 00:57:15,533
Just happened to be
at the right place

1213
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,166
at the right time, I guess.

1214
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,066
I stopped believing
in coincidences

1215
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,233
a long time ago,

1216
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:21,667
especially at Christmas.

1217
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,333
I can't thank you both enough.

1218
00:57:24,467 --> 00:57:25,767
We're just happy
that he's home.

1219
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,967
Do you mind just waiting here
for one second?

1220
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,900
Just hang on.

1221
00:57:34,066 --> 00:57:37,400
These are Winter family
Christmas croissants.

1222
00:57:37,533 --> 00:57:38,467
We make them at my bakery,

1223
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,467
but they are
my husband's favorites.

1224
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,333
Aw, thank you.

1225
00:57:42,467 --> 00:57:44,934
Seriously,
thank you both so much.

1226
00:57:45,066 --> 00:57:46,333
Merry Christmas.

1227
00:57:46,467 --> 00:57:47,834
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, merry Christmas.

1228
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,900
Aw...

1229
00:57:53,867 --> 00:57:55,767
Well, we should
get back to the garage.

1230
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,967
Mm-hmm.

1231
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,266
Hey, if the car isn't fixed,

1232
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,667
we'll get a train,

1233
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,633
or a cab.

1234
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:04,600
Something.

1235
00:58:04,734 --> 00:58:06,433
We'll figure it out.

1236
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,700
I won't leave you
until you're where you belong.

1237
00:58:10,834 --> 00:58:12,333
I promise.

1238
00:58:13,467 --> 00:58:14,967
Thank you.

1239
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:17,967
Here, why don't you take those?

1240
00:58:20,867 --> 00:58:23,066
Hello!

1241
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,900
Merry Christmas, Rebecca!

1242
00:58:25,033 --> 00:58:27,066
Merry Christmas, Mark!

1243
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:30,133
Jane?

1244
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,700
Rebecca!

1245
00:58:32,834 --> 00:58:34,200
Who's Rebecca?

1246
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:35,400
I'm Rebecca!

1247
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:37,867
I have a name,
and it's Rebecca!

1248
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,333
Rebecca!
That's a good name, right?

1249
00:58:39,467 --> 00:58:41,000
That is a great name.
It's a great name!

1250
00:58:41,133 --> 00:58:42,000
Rebecca who?

1251
00:58:42,133 --> 00:58:43,333
I don't know.
I don't even care!

1252
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:55,967
Rebecca, I--

1253
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:04,166
Hour's up.

1254
00:59:05,734 --> 00:59:06,900
We should get back.

1255
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:09,166
Yeah.

1256
00:59:19,767 --> 00:59:21,867
Hello?

1257
00:59:23,133 --> 00:59:24,333
Just give me a sec, guys.

1258
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,900
Let's hope for the best.

1259
00:59:27,033 --> 00:59:29,166
We're due for some good news.

1260
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:34,500
It's Mark.

1261
00:59:35,667 --> 00:59:36,633
Who?

1262
00:59:37,934 --> 00:59:41,066
The man in my memories.

1263
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,266
Are you sure?

1264
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,233
I'm sure.

1265
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,633
Well, he must be
pretty important then,

1266
00:59:48,767 --> 00:59:49,867
if you keep remembering him.

1267
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:51,900
Yeah.

1268
00:59:52,033 --> 00:59:53,100
That's a good thing, right?

1269
00:59:53,233 --> 00:59:54,934
Because he'll be
waiting for you there,

1270
00:59:55,066 --> 00:59:56,233
and...

1271
00:59:56,367 --> 00:59:58,467
you'll get your answers.

1272
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,500
Right.

1273
01:00:05,266 --> 01:00:06,500
Um...

1274
01:00:09,033 --> 01:00:10,033
Sheriff Crowley's calling.

1275
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:13,734
Hello?

1276
01:00:13,867 --> 01:00:16,467
You did?

1277
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,467
Uh-huh.

1278
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,433
No.

1279
01:00:24,266 --> 01:00:27,367
Merry Christmas to you, too.

1280
01:00:29,367 --> 01:00:32,900
They find anything?

1281
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:35,133
My suitcase.

1282
01:00:35,266 --> 01:00:37,767
Was there anything
useful inside?

1283
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,567
Um...

1284
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,033
Yeah, my laptop,

1285
01:00:42,166 --> 01:00:45,266
which they can't get on.

1286
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,233
Um...

1287
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:48,800
some clothes...

1288
01:00:50,233 --> 01:00:51,934
A sweater?

1289
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:56,266
A little girl's sweater.

1290
01:00:59,233 --> 01:01:02,100
Could I be a mom?

1291
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,100
How could someone...

1292
01:01:05,233 --> 01:01:09,100
How could I forget
something like that?

1293
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:13,567
A child-- my own child?

1294
01:01:15,934 --> 01:01:16,734
Good news!

1295
01:01:16,867 --> 01:01:17,600
You're all set.

1296
01:01:17,734 --> 01:01:18,633
Replaced the battery.

1297
01:01:18,767 --> 01:01:20,133
The battery?
That's all it was?

1298
01:01:20,266 --> 01:01:22,233
You two got yourselves
a Christmas miracle.

1299
01:01:30,467 --> 01:01:31,567

Who?

1319
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:48,500
Marissa.

1320
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:53,400
It's hard enough as it is
just making the trip.

1321
01:02:53,533 --> 01:02:55,300
I...

1322
01:02:55,433 --> 01:02:58,734
I don't think I can face her.

1323
01:02:58,867 --> 01:03:01,300
I think you should try.

1324
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,667
Why is it so important to you?

1325
01:03:07,767 --> 01:03:08,700
In less than an hour,

1326
01:03:08,834 --> 01:03:09,867
I'm going to find out

1327
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,166
what's waiting for me
in Charleston...

1328
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,567
...but even
if I get my answers...

1329
01:03:21,767 --> 01:03:22,934
...I'm not sure I'll be okay

1330
01:03:23,066 --> 01:03:24,800

Wait, wait, your bag!

1334
01:03:46,033 --> 01:03:47,300
Okay, I'm going
to park the car,

1335
01:03:47,433 --> 01:03:48,300
and then I'll meet you inside.

1336
01:03:48,433 --> 01:03:49,300
Okay, uh, I'll be at the tree.

1337
01:03:49,433 --> 01:03:50,433
Okay.

1338
01:03:50,567 --> 01:03:51,967
- See you there.
- Yeah.

1339
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,934
Rebecca?

1340
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,400
You made it!

1341
01:04:24,333 --> 01:04:25,133
Oh...

1342
01:04:35,934 --> 01:04:37,066
I'm so glad you're here.

1343
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,633
I was worried
you wouldn't come.

1344
01:04:38,767 --> 01:04:41,300
You're here!
I missed you!

1345
01:04:48,066 --> 01:04:50,400
We really missed you.

1346
01:04:52,633 --> 01:04:53,533
Mark?

1347
01:04:53,667 --> 01:04:55,033
Yes?

1348
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,467
Why are you
looking at me like that?

1349
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,066
Dad, can I go hang out
with Ava?

1350
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,767
- Sure, but stay close.
- Okay.

1351
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,033
I'll see you later.

1352
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:09,867
I, uh...

1353
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:13,266
I don't know who you are.

1354
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,667
What do you mean,
you don't know who I am?

1355
01:05:18,233 --> 01:05:20,934
I mean, I thought
that when I saw your face,

1356
01:05:21,066 --> 01:05:22,934
it would all just
come back to me,

1357
01:05:23,066 --> 01:05:24,600
but I...

1358
01:05:24,734 --> 01:05:25,900
I still don't--

1359
01:05:26,033 --> 01:05:27,033
Rebecca, what's going on?

1360
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:29,000
Rebecca?

1361
01:05:30,233 --> 01:05:31,166
It is you.

1362
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,667
I cannot believe it.

1363
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,867
You have some nerve coming here.

1364
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,834
?

1365
01:05:43,967 --> 01:05:45,100
You should be.

1366
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,433
Mom and Dad have been trying
to reach you for days.

1367
01:05:47,567 --> 01:05:50,100
They are beside themselves
with worry.

1368
01:05:50,233 --> 01:05:51,700
Annie, I'm sure that she has
a very good explanation.

1369
01:05:51,834 --> 01:05:53,767
Yeah, well, she can't
answer her phone?

1370
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:54,900
Are you ignoring
their calls, too?

1371
01:05:55,033 --> 01:05:56,367
Sweetheart...

1372
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,500
Did you know about this?

1373
01:05:58,734 --> 01:06:00,100
Yes, but--

1374
01:06:00,233 --> 01:06:01,367
And you didn't tell me?

1375
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,734
Mark...

1376
01:06:02,867 --> 01:06:04,633
Hello!

1377
01:06:04,767 --> 01:06:06,900
Rebecca, Merry Christmas!

1378
01:06:07,033 --> 01:06:09,000
Merry Christmas, Mark!

1379
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:10,100
Where's Annie and--

1380
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:10,967
There you are!

1381
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,100
Just in time for dinner!

1382
01:06:13,066 --> 01:06:14,333
Come here!

1383
01:06:14,467 --> 01:06:15,934
Oh, it's so good to see you.

1384
01:06:16,066 --> 01:06:17,400
Oh, you look great.

1385
01:06:17,533 --> 01:06:19,066
Oh, my gosh,
you look great...

1386
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,166
Mark!

1387
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,433
Would you have let me
if I had?

1388
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,934
I remember!

1389
01:06:24,367 --> 01:06:25,433
What?

1390
01:06:25,567 --> 01:06:27,934
Oh, my gosh, I remember,
just like they said I would!

1391
01:06:28,066 --> 01:06:30,467
You're Annie!

1392
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,667
You're my sister!

1393
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,233
Okay, what is going on here?

1394
01:06:33,367 --> 01:06:34,433
I don't know,

1395
01:06:34,567 --> 01:06:36,367
she's been acting very strangely
since she got here.

1396
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,567
Oh, my gosh.

1397
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,834
Oh, my gosh, I have made
a horrible mistake.

1398
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:40,900
I...

1399
01:06:41,934 --> 01:06:42,667
Uh...

1400
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,834
What?

1401
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:48,266
Paul?

1402
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,600
Paul!

1403
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,400
Paul!

1404
01:07:10,266 --> 01:07:11,500
This turkey is amazing,

1405
01:07:11,633 --> 01:07:13,200
but I am totally stuffed.

1406
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:15,100
You did good.

1407
01:07:15,233 --> 01:07:17,233
How's everything
at your office?

1408
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:20,667
Well...

1409
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,066
I've been waiting
to have you all together

1410
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,000
to tell you--

1411
01:07:23,133 --> 01:07:23,900
You got the promotion.

1412
01:07:24,033 --> 01:07:25,867
I knew it.

1413
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,133
No, actually,

1414
01:07:27,266 --> 01:07:29,934
I have decided
to pursue my writing full-time.

1415
01:07:33,033 --> 01:07:35,000
You know, I've got
three short stories published

1416
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:36,066
this year,

1417
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,066
and it's just--

1418
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,367
it's time to make the leap.

1419
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,133
Well,

1420
01:07:40,266 --> 01:07:42,000
that sounds very...

1421
01:07:42,133 --> 01:07:43,166
exciting.

1422
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,500
What are you going to do
about money?

1423
01:07:44,633 --> 01:07:46,333
Insurance?

1424
01:07:46,467 --> 01:07:47,667
Have you thought
of any of these things?

1425
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,700
Of course, I have.

1426
01:07:48,834 --> 01:07:49,700
I've saved up enough

1427
01:07:49,834 --> 01:07:50,700
to get me through
the next six months.

1428
01:07:50,834 --> 01:07:51,633
And then?

1429
01:07:52,934 --> 01:07:55,033
And then
I will reassess, Annie.

1430
01:07:55,166 --> 01:07:57,967
Come on, Peanut,
time for bed.

1431
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,800
You can't just drop
all of your responsibilities

1432
01:08:07,934 --> 01:08:09,767
to chase
some silly, little dream.

1433
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,700
I mean,
what are you going to do

1434
01:08:11,834 --> 01:08:12,800
about the nursing home?

1435
01:08:12,934 --> 01:08:14,900
You agreed
to pay for half the price.

1436
01:08:15,033 --> 01:08:16,934
You know that mom and dad
cannot handle it on their own.

1437
01:08:17,066 --> 01:08:18,100
I said I would and I will.

1438
01:08:18,233 --> 01:08:19,734
- How?
- I will figure it out.

1439
01:08:19,867 --> 01:08:21,433
You could not wait
till after Christmas?

1440
01:08:21,567 --> 01:08:22,467
You had to do this now?

1441
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,433
I should have known

1442
01:08:23,567 --> 01:08:24,567
that you were gonna react
like this.

1443
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,266
- What--
- You've never trusted me

1444
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,767
- to make my own decisions!
- Well, how can I,

1445
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,433
when you go and do
something like this?

1446
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,600
For once in my life

1447
01:08:30,734 --> 01:08:32,133
I would like to feel
like you believed in me.

1448
01:08:32,266 --> 01:08:33,133
Oh, grow up.

1449
01:08:33,266 --> 01:08:34,433
Oh, my gosh.

1450
01:08:34,567 --> 01:08:35,734
I shouldn't have come.

1451
01:08:35,867 --> 01:08:37,066
This was a mistake.

1452
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,233
I am trying to help you.

1453
01:08:39,367 --> 01:08:41,400
Yeah, well, maybe
I'd be better without it.

1454
01:08:42,667 --> 01:08:44,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1455
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,300
Please don't do this.

1456
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:50,567
Merry Christmas, Mark.

1457
01:08:56,834 --> 01:08:58,233
Just give her time.

1458
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,967
I'm guessing
Annie didn't think I'd come.

1459
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,133
I don't think she thought
it was a possibility.

1460
01:09:12,266 --> 01:09:13,767
Look, I love you,
and I love my wife,

1461
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:18,767
but you both can be
incredibly stubborn sometimes.

1462
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:20,000
Last Christmas,

1463
01:09:20,133 --> 01:09:22,133
you two said some things
you probably wish you hadn't.

1464
01:09:22,266 --> 01:09:24,133
So you invited me here

1465
01:09:24,266 --> 01:09:25,433
without telling her,

1466
01:09:25,567 --> 01:09:27,967
or without telling me
I wasn't welcome?

1467
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,200
I knew deep down,

1468
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:30,266
that neither of you wanted

1469
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,734
to spend
another Christmas apart.

1470
01:09:33,066 --> 01:09:34,467
What do I say to her?

1471
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,433
Say what you feel.

1472
01:09:37,567 --> 01:09:39,567
This is your chance.

1473
01:09:41,133 --> 01:09:42,700
What if she doesn't
forgive me?

1474
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,066
She will.

1475
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:51,600
Someone just needs
to make the first move.

1476
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,700
Retrograde amnesia.

1477
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:05,033
Amnesia?

1478
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:06,033
Well, are you hurt?

1479
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:07,000
What did the doctors say?

1480
01:10:07,133 --> 01:10:09,367
Oh, bumps and bruises,
honestly.

1481
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,600
I cannot believe this.

1482
01:10:10,734 --> 01:10:12,533
You spent
the whole last week alone?

1483
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:14,700
No, not alone.

1484
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,333
I'm glad you're okay.

1485
01:10:18,467 --> 01:10:19,800
I need to go
and check on Casey.

1486
01:10:19,934 --> 01:10:20,900
Of course.

1487
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,133
Here, let me help you
with those.

1488
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:28,166
Okay.

1489
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,166
Thanks, Mark.

1490
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:30,400
Yeah, of course.

1491
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:55,433
Hi.

1492
01:10:55,567 --> 01:10:57,600
It's Paul.

1493
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,100
How's Maine?

1494
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:39,400
Snowy.

1495
01:11:39,533 --> 01:11:40,900
So I've heard.

1496
01:11:41,033 --> 01:11:41,900
Sugar?

1497
01:11:42,033 --> 01:11:44,300
No, thank you.

1498
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,734
Well, it was good
to hear from you, Paul.

1499
01:11:48,867 --> 01:11:51,467
It's been a while.

1500
01:11:52,533 --> 01:11:53,433
Sorry.

1501
01:11:53,567 --> 01:11:55,767
I understand.

1502
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,500
I'm sure the hospital
keeps you very busy.

1503
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:05,533
That's not what I meant.

1504
01:12:08,066 --> 01:12:09,734
I'm...

1505
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:12,433
I'm really sorry
that I wasn't here for you

1506
01:12:12,567 --> 01:12:14,400
when you needed me.

1507
01:12:15,433 --> 01:12:17,500
Or when Ben needed me.

1508
01:12:20,066 --> 01:12:22,600
He understood how hard it was
for you to see him like that.

1509
01:12:24,133 --> 01:12:25,400
But I'm a nurse,

1510
01:12:25,533 --> 01:12:27,333
and...

1511
01:12:27,467 --> 01:12:30,266
I see that stuff every day,

1512
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,433
and I couldn't even...

1513
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,233
Ben wanted to keep
the worst of it from you.

1514
01:12:38,533 --> 01:12:41,567
He was always trying
to protect you.

1515
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,266
He was...

1516
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,600
so, so proud of you, Paul,

1517
01:12:47,734 --> 01:12:50,700
and he loved you very much.

1518
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,934
He never blamed you,

1519
01:12:56,066 --> 01:12:58,233
and neither did I.

1520
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,767
I miss him.

1521
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:08,633
I know.

1522
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:10,166
Me too.

1523
01:13:13,633 --> 01:13:16,400
I didn't even say goodbye.

1524
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,900
There's so many things
that I wanted to tell him,

1525
01:13:22,033 --> 01:13:24,667
that I needed to tell him.

1526
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,066
So tell him.

1527
01:13:30,266 --> 01:13:31,967
He'll be listening.

1528
01:13:52,967 --> 01:13:55,100
I shouldn't have left
that night...

1529
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,333
...and I never should have
waited an entire year

1530
01:14:00,467 --> 01:14:02,667
to apologize.

1531
01:14:05,734 --> 01:14:07,867
I do have a confession
to make, though.

1532
01:14:13,066 --> 01:14:16,900
I'm not supposed to be here.

1533
01:14:17,033 --> 01:14:18,333
I wasn't planning on coming.

1534
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,567
I rented a cabin up in Maine.

1535
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,200
I was planning
on spending Christmas there,

1536
01:14:26,333 --> 01:14:29,533
working alone.

1537
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:30,700
Then the storm hit,

1538
01:14:30,834 --> 01:14:31,867
the accident happened,

1539
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:35,133
and I never made it there.

1540
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,100
Mark had sent me
that invitation,

1541
01:14:38,233 --> 01:14:40,967
and I chose to ignore it,

1542
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:45,400
but when I couldn't remember
who I was,

1543
01:14:45,533 --> 01:14:47,433
I looked at the clipping,

1544
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:48,900
and I thought that...

1545
01:14:49,066 --> 01:14:50,300
That you were headed here.

1546
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,700
The only thing
that mattered to me

1547
01:14:59,867 --> 01:15:02,667
was finding out who I was,

1548
01:15:02,767 --> 01:15:04,600
and who I belonged to.

1549
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:21,433
What's this?

1550
01:15:21,567 --> 01:15:23,834
It's a gift from a friend.

1551
01:15:23,967 --> 01:15:25,400
Open it.

1552
01:15:30,133 --> 01:15:32,600
They're stories
that I wrote along the way.

1553
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:36,967
Annie, even when
I had nothing left,

1554
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,500
even when I didn't know
who I was,

1555
01:15:38,633 --> 01:15:39,700
I had this.

1556
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,700
This is who I am...

1557
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,467
...and I know that you think
that it's just some silly dream,

1558
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,600
but it's my dream.

1559
01:15:49,734 --> 01:15:52,400
It's not a silly dream.

1560
01:15:53,533 --> 01:15:56,333
But I worry about you, Rebecca.

1561
01:15:56,467 --> 01:15:58,100
I'm your sister.

1562
01:15:58,233 --> 01:15:59,200
It's my job.

1563
01:16:02,633 --> 01:16:04,967
I don't want to fight anymore.

1564
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,867
I don't want another year
to go by

1565
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,166
where we're not talking, okay?

1566
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:12,633
I miss you.

1567
01:16:12,767 --> 01:16:14,233
I missed you, too.

1568
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,633
Is that cherry pie?

1569
01:16:21,133 --> 01:16:23,066
Yup.

1570
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,200
That's...

1571
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:27,300
That's for the, uh,

1572
01:16:27,433 --> 01:16:28,567
the party tomorrow.

1573
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:32,066
Well, I don't think anyone
would miss a piece.

1574
01:16:33,967 --> 01:16:35,300
I'm really glad you came.

1575
01:16:37,367 --> 01:16:38,934
Me too.

1576
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,600
Okay, because
it's Christmas Eve,

1577
01:16:42,734 --> 01:16:44,734
your mom and I decided
you can open one present.

1578
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:45,800
But only one.

1579
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:46,734
Okay.

1580
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,333
Ooh...

1581
01:16:49,467 --> 01:16:50,567
Rectangular.

1582
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,567
There's all of the colors...

1583
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:57,233
There's, like...

1584
01:17:10,033 --> 01:17:10,934
Okay...

1585
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:26,533
"Jane,

1586
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:28,333
if you're reading this,

1587
01:17:28,467 --> 01:17:31,600
it means that you've finally
reached your destination.

1588
01:17:31,734 --> 01:17:32,967
I hope the life
waiting for you

1589
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:36,166
is worthy of the amazing
person that you are.

1590
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,567
I wanted to thank you

1591
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:38,834
for making a hard trip

1592
01:17:38,967 --> 01:17:40,767
one of the highlights
of my life.

1593
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:44,233
I'm not sure I could have
done it without you.

1594
01:17:44,367 --> 01:17:46,734
Have a very Merry Christmas.

1595
01:17:46,867 --> 01:17:48,834
I hope you get
everything that you want.

1596
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,400
Paul."

1597
01:18:06,467 --> 01:18:08,433
Sorry it took so long
to get here.

1598
01:18:10,133 --> 01:18:11,533
You know, sometimes,
it's easy to get lost

1599
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:13,200
along the way.

1600
01:18:19,066 --> 01:18:21,300
I miss you.

1601
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,667
You know, after you died,

1602
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,734
all I could think about

1603
01:18:28,867 --> 01:18:29,734
was all the times

1604
01:18:29,867 --> 01:18:33,800
that I could have
just gotten in my car,

1605
01:18:33,934 --> 01:18:36,266
come see you,

1606
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,633
that I could have picked up
the phone to call you...

1607
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,800
...till it just became easier
not to think about you at all.

1608
01:18:53,767 --> 01:18:54,633
I don't want that, Ben.

1609
01:18:54,767 --> 01:18:58,800
I want to remember yesterday

1610
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:02,066
and bring you with me tomorrow.

1611
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,166
You know, no regrets.

1612
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,367
We don't know how long we get,

1613
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,100
you know?

1614
01:19:13,233 --> 01:19:17,967
But as long as
there's a tomorrow...

1615
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,166
it's worth seeing
what's going to happen.

1616
01:19:24,533 --> 01:19:27,333
That's what I'm going to do.

1617
01:19:27,467 --> 01:19:29,633
So...

1618
01:19:32,066 --> 01:19:34,500
Merry Christmas, Ben.

1619
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,767
I love you.

1620
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,100
You were right.

1621
01:19:57,233 --> 01:20:02,400
This is the only hotel
in this entire town.

1622
01:20:02,533 --> 01:20:03,934
What are you doing here?

1623
01:20:04,066 --> 01:20:06,667
You left before I got a chance
to say goodbye.

1624
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,867
Oh.

1625
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,066
So you're here to say goodbye?

1626
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,900
No.

1627
01:20:12,033 --> 01:20:14,500
I am here to invite you
to our Christmas party.

1628
01:20:14,633 --> 01:20:16,200
It's nothing wild,

1629
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:18,600
just friends and family.

1630
01:20:18,734 --> 01:20:19,867
Your memories?

1631
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,600
I got 'em back.

1632
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:24,867
Just like
Dr. Grant said I would.

1633
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,033
That's great.

1634
01:20:26,166 --> 01:20:28,266
Yeah, my, um...

1635
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,900
my sister was there,

1636
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:33,433
waiting for me
at the tree-lighting ceremony,

1637
01:20:33,567 --> 01:20:36,100
my brother-in-law, Mark.

1638
01:20:36,233 --> 01:20:38,066
Brother-in-law?

1639
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,100
Brother-in-law.

1640
01:20:39,233 --> 01:20:40,433
Brother-in-law...

1641
01:20:40,567 --> 01:20:42,400
And my niece.

1642
01:20:42,533 --> 01:20:43,867
You know,
I had to explain to her

1643
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,400
why the sweater I bought her
was still up in Maine

1644
01:20:46,533 --> 01:20:48,700
in a very soggy suitcase,

1645
01:20:48,834 --> 01:20:52,467
'cause I hadn't had
a chance yet to mail it.

1646
01:20:54,667 --> 01:20:58,867
Everything I wanted
was waiting for me.

1647
01:20:59,000 --> 01:20:59,934
Family.

1648
01:21:00,066 --> 01:21:02,166
Forgiveness.

1649
01:21:03,266 --> 01:21:05,266
I thought I'd be happy.

1650
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,567
I am. I am happy,

1651
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:08,667
but...

1652
01:21:10,967 --> 01:21:12,934
...there's still
something missing.

1653
01:21:17,233 --> 01:21:19,066
When I finally made it home,

1654
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:23,133
and got to see
a lifetime full of memories,

1655
01:21:23,266 --> 01:21:24,533
I...

1656
01:21:26,433 --> 01:21:27,767
...I realized that...

1657
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:32,000
I've never quite met
anyone like you.

1658
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,500
Well, I have definitely
never met anyone like you.

1659
01:21:36,633 --> 01:21:37,767
You said

1660
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:41,333
you hoped I got
what I wanted for Christmas.

1661
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:46,100
This is it.

1662
01:21:46,233 --> 01:21:48,200
