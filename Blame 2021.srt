00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,553
I'm gonna need to take a
look at those recordings.

183
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,880
- I sure hope he's got something.

184
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,573
- Yeah, please.

186
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,060
(door clicks)

187
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,900
- I just updated this operation system

188
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,030
so it may take me a
little while to navigate.

189
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,047
- Okay, well, I'm pretty sure

190
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:58,197
we can have someone
help you figure it out.

191
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,680
Get this going for me.

192
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,520
I'm gonna go talk to 'em.
- Okay.

193
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,480
- How many are there?

194
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,363
- There's three.

195
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,423
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.

196
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,020
They say, "They're telling us everything,"

197
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,130
but I just don't think it's that simple.

198
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,780
I'm gonna go ask them some questions,

199
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,840
you guys come and get me as soon

200
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,540
as surveillance is up, you got it?

201
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:23,850
- (grunts) Is this too much?

202
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,290
Sometimes I feel like pack too much

203
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,130
but then whenever I get where I'm going,

204
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,260
I never have anything
that I actually want.

205
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,690
Is it gonna be cold where we're going?

206
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,740
'Cause I know we're going north

207
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,440
but in my mind I guess I always (grunts)

208
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,500
consider Wisconsin and
Illinois both to be north but-

209
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,059
- You know when you're not physically here

210
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,390
to see the other person

211
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,669
you'd assume you're having a conversation

212
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,842

213
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:44,430

215
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,580

216
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,776

one bag's just for shoes.

290
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,620
- Actually two of mine are for shoes.

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,453

292
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,590

293
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,963
they're bigger than just regular shoes.

as I possibly could.

296
00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:50,880
I think it's kind of stupid

297
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,290
to bring more than one bag on a trip,

298
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,890
especially when you're going
with a group of people,

299
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,290
it's like kind of inconsiderate you know.

300
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,560
People do the same things on airplanes,

301
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,410
it's like just 'cause there's
a two carry-on bag limit

302
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,300
they insist on bringing two carry-on bags,

303
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,133
and more often than not

304
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:03,450
they don't even need half
the stuff that they brought.

305
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,730
Oh, I'm so excited to
just be in a warm cabin

307
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,710

308
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,130
- You can have your hot
cocoa, I'll have my beer.

309
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,372
- What about when you
come in from the snow

310
00:12:13,372 --> 00:12:15,130
and you wanna warm up?
- Beer.

311
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,690
- Well, what about when we sit down

312
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,040
all snugly for breakfast?

313
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,240

314
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,870

315
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,070

- Ew, that is so gross.

317
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,470

318
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,570

00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,240

326
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,270
- Everyone's so paranoid.

327
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,103
- Just do it.

328
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,760

329
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,823

330
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,570
Does your guys' maid still
come when you're away?

331
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,520
- Yeah, we trust her, she has a key,

332
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,830
and also we have nanny cams

333
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,280
so we'd know if anything happened.

334
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,760
- Nanny cams?

335
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,637
Like in teddy bears?

336
00:12:53,637 --> 00:12:55,260
I mean we're in college.

337
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,550
- Yeah, I know, they're still there.

338
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,120
You know whenever Blake
and I like, you know,

339
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,477
we have to turn the
cameras around. (laughs)

340
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:04,239
- [Logan] All right,
everyone got what they need?

341
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:06,040
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.

342
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,873
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go.

343
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:07,780
- Let's do this.

344
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,871

- Wait, where is your
aunt's cabin again, Blake?

348
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,270
- Wausau, it's a little
snow town in Wisconsin,

349
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,150
Rib Mountain State Park,
highest snow peaks around here.

350
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,308
- Are there any cute boys in Wausau?

351
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:24,670

352
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,017

356
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,500
then what's Wisconsin?

357
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,040

are bears in Wisconsin too

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,270
but like what's on its flag?

359
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,936
- Who cares.
- Chill for a second, okay.

360
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:38,210
We have the whole trip to
talk about bears and flags.

361
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,180
Uh, we good, we ready, we comfortable?

362
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,550
- Yes, can we just go already?

363
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,770
- All right, Grand Prix
snowboarding here we come.

364
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,516
- [Mia] Blake, you're so dramatic.

365
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:48,466
(upbeat rock music)

366
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:50,883
(Mia laughs)

367
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,150
- So seriously though,

368
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,520
like what's different about Wisconsin?

369
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,990
- More snow and great beer.

370
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,660
- Okay, right, but like what's
special about the state?

371
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,130
We all learned about
our country in school,

372
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,910
what is that people in
Wisconsin are proud of?

373
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,897
- Why is so important?
- No.

374
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:21,840
- I'm just saying that
it says a lot about us

375
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,460
if we don't know anything
about our country,

376
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,293
you know what I mean?

377
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:25,630
Like I'm not trying to say anything bad

378
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,660
but like we're lazy.

379
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,823
I bet people don't even really know

380
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:29,680
that Illinois is the bear state.

381
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,850
- I've lived in Illinois my entire life

382
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,810
and I've never even seen a bear,

383
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,380
so I mean if it is the bear state

384
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,510
where the hell are all the bears?

385
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,710
- No, it's called the bear state

386
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,940
because of like you know football.

387
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,640
And I'm sure all the bears are like south.

388
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,473
See this is the thing,

389
00:14:42,473 --> 00:14:44,690
I just wish people were smarter, okay.

390
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,150
All I know is that Illinois
bear state, Illinois bear state.

391
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,370
- Illinois is most definitely
not the bear state.

392
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,750
- Yeah, it is, Blake.

393
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,770
- There's not a bear on the
flag or anything like that.

394
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,490
And it's definitely not
because of the Chicago Bears

395
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,380
or even the Cubs for that matter.

396
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,080
Illinois is the Prairie State,

397
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,070
also referred to as the Lincoln
State but not officially.

398
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,460
And Wisconsin is often referred

399
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,890
to as the Dairy State or the Dairy Land,

400
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,016
but it technically doesn't have
an official nickname at all.

401
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:12,849
- Wow.

402
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,860
- What?

403
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,267
- You are one pathetic loser.

404
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,100
(Mia laughing)

405
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,780
- Sorry, can't help I remember stuff.

406
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,930
- Oh, honey, I'm like
really impressed. (giggles)

407
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,130
Okay, but that brings
me to my original query,

408
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,120
um, what's the bear state then?

409
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,690
- Well, there's a bear
on the California flag

410
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,840
but it's not the bear state,

411
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,270
it's just the official state animal.

412
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,580
- Shut up, how do you know that?

413
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,100
You're totally making this up.

414
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,940
- Google it.

415
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,220
Plus my dad listen to a lot

416
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,410
of the Red Hot Chili Peppers band

417
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,621

about California in there.

419

- Okay, okay, so you're safe
from being a complete loser.

421
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,020
You only know about
California because of music.

422
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,070
- So you know facts about every state?

423
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,694

Wisconsin, and California.

Shoot, you know what?

429

We're gonna have to reschedule that until-

430
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,417
- I actually have to send an
email quickly to work too.

431
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,830

him a call if you want.

- Why?
- That's totally fine.

- I hear you, bro.

436
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,880
Social media, it's like
you're walking down the street

437
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,390
and there's a guy walking towards you

438
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,810

439
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:32,011
and he's just still like
not even there, you know.

440
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:33,610
- I just wish that on this
trip that we could talk

441
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,820
to each other.
- Okay, yeah, we'll talk soon.

442
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,070
Oh, yeah, we got lots to talk about.

443
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:36,903
Okay, okay.
- You know,

444
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:38,460
why do we always have to be on our phones?

445
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,293
- Okay, all right.
- Why do we always have-

446
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:40,260
- Okay.
- To be available to everyone?

447
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,850
- [Andy] Okay, all right, bye.

448
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,750
- Hold on, man, I gotta
check this really quick.

449
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,470
- Smartphones have only been
around for like 10 years

450
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,790
we shouldn't be.
(phone ringing)

451
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,760
Hi, you've reached Blake's voicemail.

452
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,810
He's off on a trip right now,

453

your call when he gets back.

Okay, buh-bye.

455

- Wow, what's wrong with you?

456
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:01,760
- Phones are just things
that people think they need.

457
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,930
- You need a new phone?
Is your phone broken?

458
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,718
We can probably order one,
we can have it delivered.

459
00:17:05,718 --> 00:17:08,020
- I bet you couldn't go
two days without a phone.

460
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,853
- I could.

461
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:11,170
Actually my phone isn't even something

462
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,900
that I consider to be
necessary for my daily life.

463
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,050
I mean some people it's
like it's out of control,

464
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,700
all they do is you know talk,

465
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,420
and text, and, and social media.

466
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,940
They're just like in their
phone all the, (gasps)

467
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,089
oh, my gosh, you guys,
there's this one guy,

468
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:26,660
this is really funny, he's
in my pottery class, okay,

469
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,840
and his name is Anthony,
and fun fact Anthony

470
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,460
actually by definition
means man of little words.

471
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,480
You guys, he sits there during
class and he just talks.

472
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,560
I mean like he's under the table

473
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,900
like whispering into his phone,

474
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,410
he's texting, he's like
scrolling through social media.

475
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,170
He just never stops this guy.

476
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,470
My teacher's at the front of the class

477
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,130
like teaching us how to do pottery,

478
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,830
meanwhile he's just blabbing away

479
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,880
as if his whole life is
one giant conversation,

480
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,760
has so much to say all
the time, it's just-

481
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,160

493

- Well, I won't need mine.

495

have them for a few days.

496
00:18:21,353 --> 00:18:23,280

497

498
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,950

499
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,130
- My god, it's not like we're
going to a desolate island,

500
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,860
this is a manmade resort,

501

front of us live and in person.

- Think of it like a
challenge, it'll be fun.

529
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:32,290
- I have agents, like what if they call

530
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,380
for a casting or, or I book an audition?

531
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,630
- It's just for the weekend.

532
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,360
Your agency's not open
on the weekend right?

533
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,640
- Usually, but you know
sometimes things come up.

534
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,540
- Okay, well, then you can
check in with them on Monday.

535
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,800
Don't even tell me
where you put it, Logan.

536
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,750
I don't wanna know.

537
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,123
- So how do we know how to get there?

538
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,063
- Uh.
(traffic humming)

539
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:11,640
(fan whirring)
(upbeat music)

540
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,473
I got the door.

541
00:20:12,473 --> 00:20:13,923
Oh, it's much warmer in here.

542
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,400
Hey, how are ya?

543
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,270
- Real well, yep, real well.

544
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,960
Started my shift about 6:00 am today.

545
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,170
Wow, that is early, 6:00 am.

546
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,230
You'd be surprised
actually how many people

547
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,180
are up and moving at that time of day.

548
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,423
I'll tell you it is more
than you would think,

549
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:32,370
it's a busy time.

550
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,100
- Yeah, um, what exit number
do I take to get into Wausau?

551
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,920
I'm trying to get to Granite
Peak, it's a ski resort.

552
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,963
- Well, let me see my charts here.

553
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:43,713
(paper rustling)

554
00:20:46,824 --> 00:20:49,491
All right, all right, all right.

555
00:20:54,414 --> 00:20:58,369
I knew a girl in Germantown
once, and you go up there,

556
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:01,300
and well, I'm not exactly sure.

557
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,726
I do know it is in Wisconsin though.

558
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:05,440
(Attendant and Blake laughing)

559
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,030
Little welcome center humor.

560
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,963
Uh, all right, you go past Milwaukee,

561
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,780
and then it's, it's way
northwest of Green Bay even,

562
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,860
so you've got quite a ways to go yet,

563
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,763
three, four, hours, I'd say.

564
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,290
Be careful.

565
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,610
- It's a good thing you told us be careful

566
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,393
'cause, uh, should we
try to be not careful?

567
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,763
- No, please be careful
on your way up there.

568
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:33,500
- Why do you say that?

569
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,490
- We've got some heavy weather coming in.

570
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,940
We'll catch it down here too.

571
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,467
Temperature's changing,
can't you feel it, the cold?

572
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,250
- I think we'll be okay.

573
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,023
- Work together, keep your eyes open,

574
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,240
you'll find the right way.

575
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,423
Good luck.

576
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,790
Thank you, and, uh, good
luck to you, my good sir.

577
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,520
- Remember when I wanted to
work at a welcome center?

578
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,719
Yeah, I've changed my mind.

579
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:13,020
That guy's crazy.

580
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,687
(ominous music)

581
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:20,842
(group chattering)

582
00:22:27,482 --> 00:22:30,232
(dramatic music)

583
00:22:31,574 --> 00:22:34,424
(Mia laughing)

584
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:37,424
(suspenseful music)

585
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:03,057
- I'm bored.

586
00:23:03,057 --> 00:23:05,020
I'm gonna watch a movie.

587
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,840
Blake, where do you keep the movies?

588
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,740
- I don't think I have
any in here actually?

589
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,680
- You have a DVD player
in your car and no DVDs?

590
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,947
- Sorry, didn't think about it.

591
00:23:12,947 --> 00:23:15,480
- [Reporter] State are
experiencing dropping temperatures.

592
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,313
As it gets later-

593
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:17,370
- I've got something we can watch.

594
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,010
- [Reporter] This rainy day into snow.

595
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,670
- I was gonna wait till we
got to the cabin but, uh.

596
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,093
- [Reporter] 30 miles an
hour reducing visibility.

597
00:23:23,093 --> 00:23:25,680
- Hey, Blake, I have a surprise for you.

598
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,552
- [Reporter] WNO want's you-

599
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:28,300
- What are you talking about?
- To stay safe, so stay-

600
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,900
- I found those old moves
that we used to make,

601
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,380
you know in the, in the back yard.

602
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,400
Remember when we were action stars?

603
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,240
- No way, you found those?

604
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,350
- Yeah, dude, they're so hilarious.

605
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,400
Um, I know how much they meant to you

606
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,200
so I had them transferred to a disc.

607
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,736
I wanted to wait to surprise
you up at the cabin,

608
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:48,340
you know thought we all could watch 'em,

609
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,840
get a kick out of 'em, laugh a little.

610
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,650
- Dude, that is so awesome.

611
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,660
- Logan, that's really sweet.

612
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,850
I can't wait to watch.

613
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,940
- Yeah, I wanna see
you guys as little kids

614
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,910
running around playing in the backyard.

615
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,880
- Hand it up, man.

616
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,080
Pass it to my navigator.

617
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,350
- Yeah, they're so hilarious, man.

618
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,280
You were such a jerk.

619
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,220
You took everything so seriously.

620
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,320
And you wanna know what else?

621
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,880
He always had me be the bad guy

622
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,340
because he wanted to be the hero.

623
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,180
- Oh, I bet he just always wanted to win.

624
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,163
- Oh, the bad guy wins sometimes.

625
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,560
- I didn't always wanna
be the hero, shut up.

626
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,393
Andy, it's that one right there.

627
00:24:24,236 --> 00:24:25,710
- All right, we're all set.

628
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,270
- Oh, my gosh,

629
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,209
you guys are adorable.
- We both take three paces,

630
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:30,960
turn, and draw.

631
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,198
- [Both] One, two, three.

632
00:24:33,198 --> 00:24:34,031
- Boom, boom!
- Bang!

633
00:24:34,031 --> 00:24:35,993
- I got you, I got you!
- I got you first!

634
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:37,242
(Young Logan groans)

635
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,340
- Check this out right here, right here.

636
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,560
Blake looks right at the camera

637
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,060
as he's about to take me down.

638
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,873
- Okay.

639
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:45,211
(Mia laughs)

640
00:24:45,211 --> 00:24:46,590
- (giggles) Hey, stop, that tickles.

641
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,358
- Ugh, I didn't say cut yet.

642
00:24:49,358 --> 00:24:50,850
Bang.
(Young Logan groans)

643
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,743
- Rookie mistake.

644
00:24:51,743 --> 00:24:53,220
- Man.
- Okay, you're dead.

645
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,275
- I miss that stuff so much.

646
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:56,583
- [Young Blake] Cut!

647
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:57,716
(police radio clicking)

648
00:24:57,716 --> 00:24:59,407
(brooding music)
(police radio chattering)

649
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:01,548
(door clicks)

650
00:25:01,548 --> 00:25:04,095
(footsteps crunching)

651
00:25:04,095 --> 00:25:05,310
- [Dispatcher] 27, our battery suspect

652
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,880
is at 318 East 3rd Street,
is that related to your call

653
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,700
or do you want a different patrol unit?

654
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,280
- Well, I suppose the
story they're telling us

655
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,290
may have actually happened.

656
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,146
- So you believe them?

657
00:25:17,146 --> 00:25:18,210
(police radio chattering)

658
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,043
- No.

659
00:25:19,043 --> 00:25:20,870
- [Dispatcher] The
suspect or was the victim?

660
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,220
- No, just a feeling I got.

661
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,700
I don't think they're telling the truth.

662
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,330
I mean look at all this, the blood,

663
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,983
the, the windshield, the arrow.

664
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,010
Two of 'em were murdered,

665
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,530
not only that the two who were murdered

666
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,680
are brother and sister.

667
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,073
Their heads are just on
a little too straight.

668
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,480
You got the surveillance footage up yet?

669
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,010
- Still working on it.

670
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,830
- Who's working on it?

671
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,663
- I am.

672
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,680
- So is the system out here?

673
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,760
- System?

674
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,720
- The surveillance system.

675
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,650
- No.
- It isn't, is it.

676
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,260
Get inside and look at it.

677
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,172
Man, I gotta see that video.

678
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:58,775
(siren wailing)

679
00:25:58,775 --> 00:26:00,950
(Detective Young sighs)

680
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,992
I wanna see the video.

681
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:04,659
(ominous music)

682
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:21,105
(wipers whirring)

683
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:27,744
(branch whooshes)
(car smashing)

684
00:26:27,744 --> 00:26:29,264
(group yelling)

685
00:26:29,264 --> 00:26:30,282
(tires screeching)

686
00:26:30,282 --> 00:26:31,115
(glass shattering)

687
00:26:31,115 --> 00:26:32,291
- [Blake] Oh shit!

688
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,399
- Oh, my god, what happened?

689
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:35,550
Did you fall asleep?

690
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,060
- No, no, I just couldn't see anything.

691
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,893
Everyone okay?

692
00:26:37,893 --> 00:26:39,030
Logan?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

693
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,090
we're, we're okay.

694
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,670
- Holy shit, Blake, are you okay?

695
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,340
Oh, my god, it's like a bomb went off.

696
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,970
- What happened?

697
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,040
There's a tree in here.

698
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,710
- I think I hit a branch
or something, I'm not sure.

699
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,178
I'm gonna go check it out.
- [Andy] Ugh, it's so cold.

700
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:53,759
(car door clicks)

701
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,777
(suspenseful music)
(car door bangs)

702
00:26:54,777 --> 00:26:58,570
(footsteps crunching)

703
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,480
- I've never seen anything
like this before, man.

704
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,383
What you just didn't see it?

705
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:04,530
- I couldn't see anything.

706
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,460
What are we gonna do?

707
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,110
We gotta get inside somewhere.

708
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,320
- Do you remember passing anything?

709
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,600
- I haven't seen anything but snow

710
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,150
for the past for the past hour.

711
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:15,843
- What's that?

712
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,133
- What?

713
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:19,994
- That.

714
00:27:22,117 --> 00:27:24,704
It's like a light pole or something.

715
00:27:24,704 --> 00:27:25,537
See it.

716
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,910
- Nice, man, it's gotta be a gas station.

717
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,380
- Think you can drive over there?

718
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,956
- It's gonna be interesting.

719
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:37,600
(car door clicks)

720
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,140
(car door bangs)

721
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,830
- We don't have service on any of these.

722
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,280
What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna have

723
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,470
to drive a little bit.
- How?

724
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,210
The windshield is cracked,
the window is gone,

725
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,570
there's snow coming in, we're freezing.

726
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,260
- We don't have a choice.

727
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,093
There's a light up there or something,

728
00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:52,910
I wanna go check it out, and
see if we can get some shelter.

729
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,120
I think it's a gas station.

730
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,548
- Are you sure you can even drive?

731
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,092
- No, let's find out.

732
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,471
(car rumbling)

733
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:04,083
(branch cracking)

734
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,910
Dammit, look at those scratches.

735
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,473
- Focus, Blake, we're freezing.

736
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:25,388
- Is that it?

737
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:26,221
What is it?

738
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:27,743
- I don't even know if
I'm on the road anymore,

739
00:28:27,743 --> 00:28:28,730
I can't see anything.

740
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,580
- [Ella] Just don't hit another tree.

741
00:28:34,197 --> 00:28:35,410
Is it store?

742
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,575
- It looks like a rundown school.

743
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:39,920
- I think we're in a parking lot.

744
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,733
Blake, pull forward, we can
probably get inside there.

745
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:51,408
- This is perfect.

746
00:28:51,408 --> 00:28:53,090
Let's get in and get warm.

747
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,720
- I don't think anybody's
here, it's probably locked.

748
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,190
- Doesn't mean we can't go in.

749
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,750
- [Andy] So you're just gonna break in?

750
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,215
- [Blake] Maybe, you can
wait in the car if you want.

751
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:02,048
- That was mean.

752
00:29:02,048 --> 00:29:03,958
- Come on, I was kidding.

753
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,710
It's okay, let's go.

754
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,230
- What there's no hotels
around here or anything?

755
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,220
This is the dumbest place to stop.

756
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,440
Who would ever stop here?

757
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,364
- We just did.

758
00:29:11,364 --> 00:29:14,861
(car door clicks)

759
00:29:14,861 --> 00:29:17,939
(car door clicks)

760
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:19,446
(footsteps crunching)

761
00:29:19,446 --> 00:29:22,963
(car door bangs)

762
00:29:22,963 --> 00:29:24,986
(car doors banging)

763
00:29:24,986 --> 00:29:28,153
(footsteps crunching)

764
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,650
- It is a school.

765
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,231
It looks abandoned.

766
00:29:38,231 --> 00:29:39,750
(door banging)

767
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,243
- Maybe there's another door.

768
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,384
- Wanna kick it in?

769
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:46,184
(ominous music)

770
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,324
(wind blowing)

771
00:29:47,324 --> 00:29:50,824
(police radio chattering)

772
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,190
- That's very Robin Hood.

773
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:02,579
(siren wailing)

774
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:03,412
Hmm.

775
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:07,181
(bow thuds)

776
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:10,583
(hands slapping)

777
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:14,002
(glass shattering)
(ominous music)

778
00:30:14,002 --> 00:30:19,002
(door bangs)
(wind blowing)

779
00:30:19,113 --> 00:30:20,103
- I'm so cold.

780
00:30:20,103 --> 00:30:22,038
(door bangs)

781
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:23,367
It's so cold.

782
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:24,620
- I'm so hungry.

783
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,400
I know you guys are probably hungry too.

784
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,647
Are we gonna get in
trouble for coming in here?

785
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:28,610
Are the police gonna come?

786
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,470
Are we gonna get arrested?

787
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,120
- Andy, just try to think about
one thing at a time, okay?

788
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,953
- What's that supposed to mean?

789
00:30:32,953 --> 00:30:34,200
I can think about whatever I want.

790
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,240
We just breaked and entering

791
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,600
and we're trespassing right now.

792
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,910
- Well, I'd rather be trespassing

793
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,440
than freezing to death in a blizzard!

794
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,580
- Okay, okay, settle down.

795
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,250
Look, we're inside and we're safe now.

796
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,620
We just tell the owner
about the snow storm

797
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,910
and pay for the damages.

798
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,060
This place looks totally
out of commission anyway.

799
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,453
Now he's got an excuse to get a new door.

800
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:50,960
- Hey, what do we do now?
Should we try to call somebody?

801
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,220
We left all the phones in the car.

802
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,580
- They don't have any service anyway.

803
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,413
- I think we should still get them,

804
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:55,413
they might work in here.

805
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:57,300
- It's okay, we can use the light.

806
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,080
I'm gonna go back out to the
car and get them. We are fine.

807
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,580
We're here together and we are fine.

808
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,870
- We should try to find some real lights,

809
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,470
these ones aren't working.

810
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,620
- [Andy] Really hungry.

811
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,990
- Hey look, there's a light on downstairs.

812
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,630
Should I go try maybe
find like a circuit panel,

813
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,410
or some flashlights, or something?

814
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,850
Might have to break and entering.

815
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,330
- Oh, great, so now we're trespassing

816
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,130
and we're stealing flashlights, oh fun.

817
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,223
- No, it's borrowing, it's different.

818
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,850
- There's a bunch of blankets in the car.

819
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,190
I'm gonna go back out
through that freezing hell

820
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,023
and get those too.

821
00:31:25,023 --> 00:31:25,920
- I'll come with you.

822
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,260
I actually, I brought snacks
and I know where they are.

823
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,373
- Look, honey, I'm breaking
through and exiting.

824
00:31:32,689 --> 00:31:37,070
(door clicks)
(wind blowing)

825
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,660
- Well, I'm gonna go
search for a flashlight.

826
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,320
We can use it until Logan
figures out the power.

827
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,550
- Yeah, yeah, and I'm like really hungry

828
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,870
so I guess I'll go look for some food.

829
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,670
Maybe they have like
snacks, or canned goods,

830
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,360
or other non-perishables,

831
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,976
or maybe even like a
cafeteria or something.

832
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,643
I'm just gonna go look for that.

833
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:56,282
(door clicks)

834
00:31:56,282 --> 00:32:00,951
(door creaks)
(motor humming)

835
00:32:00,951 --> 00:32:02,618
- Now we're talking.

836
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:07,292
(door bangs)

837
00:32:23,127 --> 00:32:26,501
(metal clanging)

838
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:29,418
(buttons clicking)

839
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,148
Hmm.

840
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:36,287
(phone clanging)

841
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,841
(suspenseful music)

842
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:10,040
(gentle somber music)
(light buzzing)

843
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:12,759
- Logan.

844
00:33:22,412 --> 00:33:23,245
(suspenseful music)
(Andy yelling)

845
00:33:23,245 --> 00:33:26,412
(mannequins thudding)

846
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:32,075
(ominous music)

847
00:33:32,075 --> 00:33:33,520
- Andy?

848
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,737
(suspenseful music)
(wind blowing)

849
00:33:36,737 --> 00:33:39,369
- Hey, Blake, I'm gonna go around back

850
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:44,369
and see if there's somewhere
I can go pee, okay?

851
00:33:44,874 --> 00:33:47,541
(ominous music)

852
00:34:04,383 --> 00:34:07,216
(switch clicking)

853
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,820
(light clicks)

854
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,934
(suspenseful music)

855
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:20,853
(door bangs)

856
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:21,686
- Hello.

857
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:27,670
(wind blowing)
(footsteps crunching)

858
00:34:34,596 --> 00:34:37,096
(door clicks)

859
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,757
(door bangs)

860
00:34:44,213 --> 00:34:46,300
(suspenseful music)

861
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,495
(Andy screams)

862
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:50,328
- Guys?

863
00:35:11,762 --> 00:35:13,768
What are you doing?

864
00:35:13,768 --> 00:35:15,435
Logan, where's Andy?

865
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:19,096
- There's somebody here.

866
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:19,929
- What?

867
00:35:24,731 --> 00:35:25,564
(dramatic music)

868
00:35:25,564 --> 00:35:28,339
Logan, Logan, what happened?

869
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:29,636
Andy.

870
00:35:29,636 --> 00:35:31,430
We, we have to call an ambulance.

871
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,686
- The phones are down.

872
00:35:32,686 --> 00:35:33,519
- What happened?

873
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,490
- I saw somebody, Mia.

874
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,443
Somebody did this.

875
00:35:38,443 --> 00:35:40,960
I saw them run towards the stairs.

876
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,533
- That's where I was,
they coulda killed me.

877
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,203
Where's Blake?

878
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:48,480
Oh, my god, we, we have to help her.

879
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,551
Check if she's breathing.

880
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:50,400
- She's not.

881
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,497
She's dead.
- Logan!

882
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:57,100
Okay, okay, we have to
get her to a hospital.

883
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,713
Logan, do something for once in your life!

884
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,783
- What the hell?

885
00:36:01,783 --> 00:36:03,335
Andy, Andy!

886
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:05,419
God, Andy, come on,
come on, wake up, Andy.

887
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:06,419
Andy, come on.

888
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:07,700
What happened?
- There's somebody here, man.

889
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,533
There's somebody after us.

890
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,300
- God, Blake, we have to
get her to a hospital.

891
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,230
- How did this happen?

892
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,730
- I saw somebody, man.

893
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,413
I, I just found her like that.

894
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,233
What?

895
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:17,173
Man, I heard a scream,

896
00:36:17,173 --> 00:36:18,790
and, and I was looking for a flashlight,

897
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,190
and then I just I found her
like that on the floor, man.

898
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,470
I, I don't know, I, I-

899
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,130
- What do you mean you saw someone?

900
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,223
How did this happen, Logan?

901
00:36:25,223 --> 00:36:27,080
- I just found her like that, man!

902
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,480
- We've got to do something!

903
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,120
- Take this, do it!

904
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,680
- What are you doing, man?

905
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,110
No you, you shouldn't move her.

906
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,054
(Blake grunts)

907
00:36:37,054 --> 00:36:37,887
Blake.

908
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:39,730
- Move!
- Blake, listen to me,

909
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,643
man, there's a killer
on the loose somewhere!

910
00:36:41,643 --> 00:36:44,131
- God, Logan stop saying
that, you're scaring me!

911
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:45,650
- Fine!

912
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,483
Be scared!

913
00:36:46,483 --> 00:36:49,497
I'm scared shitless right now.

914
00:36:53,408 --> 00:36:57,007
(door clicks)
(wind blowing)

915
00:36:57,007 --> 00:37:02,007
(door bangs)
(gentle somber music)

916
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,600
(car door bangs)

917
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:11,116
(car door bangs)

918
00:37:11,116 --> 00:37:14,199
(car engine revving)

919
00:37:18,577 --> 00:37:22,106
(tires crunching)

920
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,736
(door clicks)

921
00:37:23,736 --> 00:37:24,569
Blake!

922
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:26,941
Stop be crazy, man.

923
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:28,678
What are you gonna do?

924
00:37:28,678 --> 00:37:29,761
- Okay, okay.

925
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:33,056
(door clicks)

926
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,056
(suspenseful music)

927
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,677
(tires screeching)

928
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:46,705
Shit!

929
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,467
- [Logan] Come on, man,
it's not gonna work!

930
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:52,958
I'm telling the truth!

931
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:54,541
What are you doing?

932
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,623
- Hello.

933
00:38:00,914 --> 00:38:02,945
(wind blowing)
(car door clicks)

934
00:38:02,945 --> 00:38:05,398
(car door bangs)

935
00:38:05,398 --> 00:38:06,774
(somber music)

936
00:38:06,774 --> 00:38:09,607
(car door clicks)

937
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:22,072
(suspenseful music)

938
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:25,416
(Mia screams)

939
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,146
(Mia panting)

940
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:28,047
- God, what?

941
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:29,510
- [Mia] Ella, what are you doing?

942
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,410
- I, I had to pee,

943
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,580
so I just went to go find
someplace with light.

944
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,570
- That doesn't even make sense.

945
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,070
What were you still doing outside?

946
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,620
How did you get in?

947
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,940
- The door's unlocked.

948
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,943
Why, what's wrong?

949
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,550
Did something happen?

950
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:44,151
What?

951
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,840
- I told you couldn't
leave, man, it's impossible.

952
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,197
You can't see your hand in
front of your face out there,

953
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:52,574
what were you thinking?
- Logan.

954
00:38:52,574 --> 00:38:53,720
- I know there's somebody here, man.

955
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,680
I saw somebody.

956
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,060
- What makes you say that, huh?

957
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,120
Where are they, where are their car?

958
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,091
Why aren't there any lights on?

959
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:00,038
- There's was a light on, man.

960
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,230
I can't believe she's dead.

961
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,560
She is though?

962
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,030
- What is wrong with you?

963
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,173
What are you doing?
- What are you talking about?

964
00:39:05,173 --> 00:39:06,070
- [Blake] Who was in that room with her?

965
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,430
What was doing there?

966
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,960
- Look, man, I'm your best
friend you can believe me.

967
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,270
I was in another room down the hall,

968
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,930
and I swear I saw like
a figure or a shadow,

969
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,330
or something leave that room, man.

970
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,760
There was somebody else in there with her.

971
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,443
I just found her like this.
- You saw a figure?

972
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:20,331
- Yes, I did, man!

973
00:39:20,331 --> 00:39:23,200
What, are you upset because
you didn't know where I was?

974
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,700
Oh, why is that, Blake?

975
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,290
Oh, because you weren't here.

976
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,143
So you know what, man? If you
wanna accuse me of something

977
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:29,440
then go ahead and accuse me,

978
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,550
but for all I know you could
have been that figure, man.

979
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,677
- Oh, please, okay, I wasn't
in here, I was outside!

980
00:39:33,677 --> 00:39:34,710
- [Logan] How do I know that?

981
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,710
- Because I was with
Ella, you little shit.

982
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,990
- Where is Ella?

983
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,530
- Blake, hey, what happened?

984
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,363
- [Blake] Where were you?

985
00:39:41,363 --> 00:39:43,070
- What?
- Just now where were you?

986
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,483
- I was outside with you, wasn't I?

987
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:46,120
- I left a long time ago.

988
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,750
I was outside and back multiple
times since I saw you last.

989
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,690
Where did you go?

990
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,130
- I told you I had to go around back,

991
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,100
I just really had to pee,

992
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,230
and then I found and
entrance back. (gasps)

993
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,200
- These are Andy's.

994
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,090
- She let me borrow them.

995
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,150
Will somebody please
tell me what's going on?

996
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,130
Where is Andy?

997
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,143
Is she hurt?

998
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:02,843
Andy?

999
00:40:02,843 --> 00:40:03,918
Oh!

1000
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:05,363
What, no!

1001
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:06,196
What did you do?

1002
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,029
What happened?

1003
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:07,862
- Where'd you go?

1004
00:40:07,862 --> 00:40:09,240
Did you come back inside?

1005
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,073
- [Logan] Oh, come on,
Blake, just settle down.

1006
00:40:10,073 --> 00:40:11,060
- Oh, settle down?

1007
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,670
- Yes, we need to just
talk about this, man.

1008
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,790
I'm still freaking out
'cause I know I saw somebody.

1009
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,595
- You saw somebody, what?

1010
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:18,428
What do you mean?

1011
00:40:18,428 --> 00:40:20,270
- Look I just, I think
Logan is right, all right.

1012
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,580
If we just calm down we can
figure out what happened.

1013
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,550
We're all shaken up, we
should have never separated.

1014
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,430
- Just calm down.

1015
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,230
Where were you when I was outside?

1016
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,360
I know how you felt about
Andy too. You all hated her.

1017
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,493
- Don't you blame me. All
right, if you really loved her

1018
00:40:31,493 --> 00:40:32,560
the way you said you did

1019
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,470
you never would have cheated on her.

1020
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,400
- What?

1021
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,610
- Oh, don't pretend now.

1022
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,150
You never really said
no, Blake, it takes two.

1023
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:39,983
- [Logan] What is she talking about?

1024
00:40:39,983 --> 00:40:40,816
- Shut up.

1025
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:41,930
- You cheated on my sister with Mia.

1026
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,194
How dare you call me liar,
man, you're the liar!

1027
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:45,310
- Chill out, okay.

1028
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,727
You want me to calm down
then let's calm down.

1029
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:48,000
But we gotta get her out of here.

1030
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,100
- How are we gonna do that?

1031
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,790
We're stuck here man!

1032
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,340
You see it out there,
and she's already dead,

1033
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,612
so all we can do is wait.

1034
00:40:56,612 --> 00:40:58,630
- No way, man, we gotta
figure this out right now.

1035
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,463
We need to make this right.

1036
00:40:59,463 --> 00:41:01,560
- How can anything
possibly make this right?

1037
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,926
- Why do we have to wait,

1038
00:41:02,926 --> 00:41:04,297
why can't we call somebody for help?

1039
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:05,897
- 'Cause the phones are down.

1040
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,210
- You love that don't you?

1041
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,340
- Stop it!

1042
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,070
Knock it off! All right,
would you just stop acting

1043
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,890
like a child for three seconds?

1044
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,900
Let's try our phones
all right, all of them,

1045
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,213
maybe one of them will work now.

1046
00:41:15,213 --> 00:41:16,930
- I'm, I'm not gonna be next.

1047
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,283
- [Blake] Where are you going?

1048
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,010
(glass clanging)

1049
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,790
- How'd they break this glass?

1050
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,807
I'm assuming an object was used.

1051
00:41:30,807 --> 00:41:32,450
- They used the fire extinguisher

1052
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:35,063
that was hanging next to
it, then took this ax.

1053
00:41:36,247 --> 00:41:38,363
(glass clangs)
- Run any prints on this?

1054
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:40,470
- They've already been sent in.

1055
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,303
- 24 hours.

1056
00:41:41,303 --> 00:41:42,136
- Yes, sir.

1057
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:47,763
- All right.

1058
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:53,030
(glass shattering)
(ominous music)

1059
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,950
- [Blake] What are you crazy?

1060
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,190
- Look whether or not you believe me,

1061
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:58,990
I know I saw somebody, I want
something to defend myself.

1062
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,410
We all should get something.

1063
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,070
- I don't think that's a good idea.

1064
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,520
- Oh, no one's killing me.

1065
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,330
- Listen, we need to be
careful, this is serious.

1066
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,530
- That's what I'm doing.

1067
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,863
This is being careful.

1068
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:15,710
- Nobody splits up, nobody alone.

1069
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,020
Let's find an open area.

1070
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,080
- Is there a gym?

1071
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,791
- Yeah, it's downstairs.

1072
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:23,741
- Let's get to this gym, stay
together, and try our phones.

1073
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:28,867
- What about Andy?

1074
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,923
- I honestly think it's best
if we stop moving her around.

1075
00:42:45,811 --> 00:42:48,478
(ominous music)

1076
00:42:51,597 --> 00:42:54,180
(Blake crying)

1077
00:42:56,105 --> 00:42:58,772
(fist thudding)

1078
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,790
- We should all take those.

1079
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,520
Remember when we used to hunt,
now we can hunt the killer.

1080
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,993
- Just shut up, Logan.

1081
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,362
- What are you doing?

1082
00:43:29,362 --> 00:43:30,640
(arrow thuds)

1083
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,790
- Sick.

1084
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,940
- Guys, can we focus
on the phones, please.

1085
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,110
We need to get help.

1086
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,963
- There's still no service.

1087
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:42,843
- Mines not even working.

1088
00:43:42,843 --> 00:43:44,300
It's so cold, I think it's frozen.

1089
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,720
- Same with mine.

1090
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,210
Oh, let's see, this one
has a flashing light.

1091
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,863
- [Blake] That's Andy's, is it working?

1092
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:54,360
- I can see you know.

1093
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,590
- It's blinking, no service.

1094
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:56,770
- I told you they wouldn't work.

1095
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,010
- Thanks for the help, Logan.

1096
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,720
- Look, I know you're all upset

1097
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,230
but don't throw this at me.

1098
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,820
So far I've been right.

1099
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,930
I told you that you couldn't
take the car and you didn't.

1100
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:07,190
I told you that the cellphones
wouldn't work and they don't.

1101
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,470
I've been right, Blake.

1102
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:09,947
I know that there is someone here,

1103
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:14,030
and he is just waiting
for us to make a mistake.

1104
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,110
- Stop it.

1105
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,860
- What are you even talking
about, make a mistake?

1106
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,590
- Guys, fighting each other
isn't gonna help anything.

1107
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,110
We should retrace our steps.

1108
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,673
Okay, just, just breathe for a second.

1109
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,770
We need to retrace our
steps to this very moment

1110
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:28,870
and try to figure what
could have happened.

1111
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,143
- That's a good idea.

1112
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,780
We should just explain what we all saw,

1113
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,800
and what we all heard.

1114
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,000
- Fine, let's do that, best friend.

1115
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,833
- Blake, stop it.

1116
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:39,300
Just sit down, okay?

1117
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,180
It's a good place to start.

1118
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,133
- All right, fine.

1119
00:44:44,663 --> 00:44:45,670
I went back out to the car

1120
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:47,940
to get the blankets and the phone bag,

1121
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,713
I came back in to find
you two over Andy's body.

1122
00:44:50,713 --> 00:44:52,070
There, that's it, next.

1123
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:53,270
- Blake, just calm down.

1124
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,103
- I am calm!

1125
00:44:54,103 --> 00:44:55,800
- Okay, why don't we
start from this morning

1126
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,300
and work our way until now.

1127
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,270
I read somewhere that the
further back you recall

1128
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,760
the more specific details you remember

1129
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,320
up to the present moment.

1130
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,830
We certainly have time for it, right?

1131
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:05,533
- That's not true.
- She's right.

1132
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:08,640
Just start from the morning,

1133
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,530
and then we can piece everything together.

1134
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:11,800
- This is ridiculous.

1135
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,572
- You didn't do it, right, Blake?

1136
00:45:13,572 --> 00:45:14,405
- [Blake] What?

1137
00:45:14,405 --> 00:45:15,993
- I mean you loved her, right?

1138
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,733
Prove it.

1139
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,140
- All right, Blake, let's
take it one more time

1140
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,690
all the way from the beginning.

1141
00:45:33,362 --> 00:45:35,200
(police radio chattering)

1142
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,150
- I woke up with my girlfriend, Andrea,

1143
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:43,083
packed up my stuff, and
called my buddy, Logan.

1144
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,070
Wanted to fill up with gas
before we hit the road,

1145
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,820
so I fill it up at the gas station.

1146
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,563
Then headed on to West Washington,

1147
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,340
that's where I was picking Logan up.

1148
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:58,170
- So one of these girls out
here they're your girlfriend?

1149
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:02,453
- No, my girlfriend was the
one who died, Andy, Andrea.

1150
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,213
- That's right.

1151
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,380
Terribly sorry about that.

1152
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,183
Please continue.

1153
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,613
- I picked him up on the
corner of the street,

1154
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:17,210
got in the car, and used
his phone to call Andy.

1155
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,450
- You called her.

1156
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:19,340
- Yeah, I called Andy.

1157
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,390
I called my girlfriend.

1158
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:21,783
My gosh, she's.

1159
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,833
- Sit down.

1160
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,680
(police radio chattering)

1161
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,193
Go ahead.

1162
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,473
- From there I picked up Ella,

1163
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:43,880
she's the other girl out there.

1164
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:46,220
She's a model.

1165
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,963
- Hmm, I see.

1166
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,130
These are some beautiful girls

1167
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,241
you spend your time with, Blake.

1168
00:46:52,241 --> 00:46:53,871
(police radio chattering)

1169
00:46:53,871 --> 00:46:55,250
- [Dispatcher] The
suspect or was the victim?

1170
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,960
- We went from there to, to the house, uh,

1171
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,470
Logan and Andy's parents' house.

1172
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:01,963
We all went inside.

1173
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,970
Logan went straight upstairs

1174
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:07,970
but I was thirsty so I, I went
into the kitchen for a drink.

1175
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,053
Got these mittens for Andy.

1176
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,864
Was really excited to give
them to her for the trip.

1177
00:47:17,058 --> 00:47:19,970
So I went upstairs, I
said hello to everyone,

1178
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,920
helped the girls bring their bags down.

1179
00:47:24,194 --> 00:47:26,703
Mia asked me to help
her turn off the dryer,

1180
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,740
so we went into the laundry room together,

1181
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,790
grabbed some of her clothes for the trip.

1182
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,820
She such a girl you know.

1183
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,653
- Hmm.

1184
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:41,440
- She'll pack an entire wardrobe
just for a weekend trip.

1185
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,273
- Crazy.

1186
00:47:44,154 --> 00:47:45,830
- We loaded up the car, got in,

1187
00:47:47,663 --> 00:47:50,123
we were all together until
we got to the school.

1188
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:56,120
We made a pact together,
turn off our phones,

1189
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,823
not use 'em, just wanted to
spend time with each other.

1190
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,880
Storm got really bad,

1191
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,800
worse than anything I've
ever seen, actually.

1192
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,500
That's when I hit the tree, it
must have fallen in the road,

1193
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:17,500
we crashed, and saw a light,
and we just kept driving to it

1194
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:19,730
hoping we wouldn't hit anything else.

1195
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,420
- Yeah, that must have been terrifying.

1196
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,450
That was a pretty bad wreck out there.

1197
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,530
Seems chaotic.

1198
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,063
- It was, but we handled it.

1199
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:33,520
Once we got to the school
we calmed down a little bit.

1200
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,913
- Was that before or after you broke in?

1201
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,813
- After.

1202
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,450
We were all together inside,

1203
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,830
but Ella and I went back out to the car

1204
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:49,453
to get blankets and, and the phones.

1205
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,010
She told me, "She had to pee,"

1206
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,610
so she went around the back
of the building I guess.

1207
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,130
I waited for her but I didn't see her,

1208
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:00,123
so I just figured she went in, inside.

1209
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:02,980
When I get in there was no one in there,

1210
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,923
I just, I went downstairs and that's,

1211
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,000
that's where I found Mia and Logan

1212
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,523
standing over Andy's body.

1213
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,290
Now Logan tried to tell me
that there was someone there,

1214
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:17,390
that, that someone killed
Andy, but I didn't listen.

1215
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:19,683
I, I was really shaken.

1216
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:23,803
- Logan, I just,

1217
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,020
why would Logan think there
was someone else here?

1218
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,220
- 'Cause he saw someone.

1219
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,540
He was right, there was someone here.

1220
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,000
They, they came in the back door,

1221
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,850
that's, that's what I think at least.

1222
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:40,880
He was best friend, there was
no reason he would lie to me.

1223
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,010
(police radio chattering)

1224
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,940
He even broke the ax case out there,

1225
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,233
he wanted to protect us.

1226
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,690
Still don't know why someone

1227
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,390
would wanna shoot him like that.

1228
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,717
Maybe they wanted the
car and just killed him.

1229
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:03,011
God, I've known him my whole life.

1230
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:05,720
(police radio chattering)

1231
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,183
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, um,

1232
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,480
I just don't think it's really hit me yet.

1233
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,373
- I understand.

1234
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:13,810
Well, I got one for you,

1235
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:18,540
did you actually see anybody shoot Logan?

1236
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,820
I mean, Blake, did you actually
see anybody here at all?

1237
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,653
- No.

1238
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,210
We were all in the janitor's room

1239
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,610
when he went out to the car.

1240
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,723
I, I heard something but I
guess I just figured it was him.

1241
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,850
- But you carried a weapon
last night too didn't you?

1242
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:36,563
A bow and arrow.

1243
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,180
- Yes.

1244
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,190
- Yes.

1245
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:42,140
Did you have that with you

1246
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,600
when you went to find Logan's body?

1247
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,520
- No, no, I left it in the gym.

1248
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,423
I never shot it.

1249
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,170
I don't really like guns,

1250
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,430
or, or shooting, or anything like that.

1251
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:53,890
- Really?

1252
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,580
Wow, I used to love shooting
stuff when I was a kid.

1253
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,310
I mean, I'd even just
play guns in the backyard

1254
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:02,350
with my friends, cops and
robbers, you know army,

1255
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,120
even like I was hunting.

1256
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,540
But I did always like
being a cop the best.

1257
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:10,210
You know I liked to, to play the hero,

1258
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,363
to get the other guy.

1259
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:16,680
And a bow and arrow, wow,
I mean that's amazing.

1260
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,880
That's like Rambo style.

1261
00:51:20,864 --> 00:51:21,697
Are you sure?

1262
00:51:23,385 --> 00:51:26,130
(ominous music)

1263
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,200
- All I know is that when I came back in

1264
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,410
Ella had on Andy's mittens,

1265
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:31,110
you two were hovering over her body,

1266
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:32,880
and Logan had blood on his hands.

1267
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,100
- You had blood on your
hands too, asshole.

1268
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,487
- [Mia] Knock it off.

1269
00:51:36,487 --> 00:51:37,860
- That got us nowhere.

1270
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,270
Someone must know
something better than that.

1271
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:42,020
How about you, Ella?

1272
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,126
Said, "You came in through a back door,"

1273
00:51:44,126 --> 00:51:45,932
what was it just unlocked?

1274
00:51:45,932 --> 00:51:47,160
- Yes.

1275
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,223
- Blake, just let her tell her story.

1276
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,343
Go ahead, Ella, from the beginning.

1277
00:51:54,673 --> 00:51:55,506
- Okay.

1278
00:51:56,490 --> 00:52:01,113
But I just, I just wanna say
that I don't wanna kill anyone.

1279
00:52:01,987 --> 00:52:04,880
I don't even think I can kill anything.

1280
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,170
And I definitely did not kill Andy.

1281
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,040
- No one saying that you did.

1282
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,323
We're just trying to
put everything together.

1283
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:16,203
- Okay.

1284
00:52:17,987 --> 00:52:20,640
(Ella sighs)

1285
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,040
This morning, uh,

1286
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,300
I went to a casting
for a jeans commercial.

1287
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,053
It was really dumb, and
I just hated being there.

1288
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:33,970
And then I went to get coffee,

1289
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:38,480
and while I was waiting
for my order to arrive

1290
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,370
you texted me, and then I, um,

1291
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:45,480
I talked to the girl behind
the counter for a little bit,

1292
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,143
and then I, I excused
myself to call Blake.

1293
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,310
And then I was in the car
with you guys, you remember.

1294
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,953
When we got the house I, uh,

1295
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:02,640
I went to find a lip
gloss from, from my bags,

1296
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,820
I had already brought them over.

1297
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,043
And then we were in the car,

1298
00:53:07,043 --> 00:53:10,591
I was with you guys up,
up until we got here.

1299
00:53:10,591 --> 00:53:15,380
Then Blake and I went outside
to get blankets and, and food,

1300
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,920
and I really had to pee,

1301
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,100
and, and I told him, I, I
told you that I had to pee,

1302
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,770
so I, I went around back,

1303
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:26,840
that is when I found the
door, and there was a light.

1304
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:30,360
And yeah, the door was
unlocked, and I opened it,

1305
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,350
but I still had to pee

1306
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:33,930
so I just decided to go in the, the snow,

1307
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:38,930
and, uh, there was something
outside that scared me.

1308
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,840
I heard a noise or something in,

1309
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,990
in the bushes next to the school,

1310
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:44,370
and so I ran back inside,

1311
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:47,920
and that's when I ran into
Mia, and she was mad at me

1312
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,270
for some reason or seemed mad at me,

1313
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:51,860
and she wouldn't tell
me what was going on,

1314
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,253
and she asked about Andy.

1315
00:53:57,246 --> 00:54:00,047
I didn't even know anything had happened.

1316
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,000
I was scared myself.

1317
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,270
- Wait, so do you have any idea

1318
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:06,280
what the noise was you
heard in the bushes?

1319
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,340
- No, I know it was enough to
make me not wanna find out.

1320
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,230
I was gonna tell you guys-
- I told you

1321
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:13,952
Ella saw something too.

1322
00:54:13,952 --> 00:54:15,670
- Ella didn't see anyone.

1323
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:16,530
There are a million things

1324
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,080
that coulda made those noises.

1325
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,870
Uh, maybe the wind and the snow

1326
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:20,703
may have played a part in it.

1327
00:54:20,703 --> 00:54:23,390
- Why are you being like this, Blake?

1328
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,550
I'm trying to tell you the truth, man.

1329
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:27,260
- There's something you're not saying.

1330
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:31,680
- Oh, you would know all about
that, hmm, keeping secrets.

1331
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,640
Oh, but don't worry,

1332
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,660
I'm sure Andy didn't
cheat on you with anybody.

1333
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,310
My sister was better than that.

1334
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,280
- So all the sudden she's your sister now?

1335
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,900
- Knock it off both of you!

1336
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,110
We have only heard two stories

1337
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:45,240
and there is no room for pointing fingers!

1338
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,713
Just shut up and listen!

1339
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,520
- [Detective Young] I would
like you to walk me through

1340
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,090
everything you can
remember from last night.

1341
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,140
- I thought I already did that.

1342
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:58,110
- Yes, you did, but
it's been a long night,

1343
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,660
and now you've had a couple
hours to think about it.

1344
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,450
I thought maybe together we could just

1345
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:03,427
go over it one more time

1346
00:55:03,427 --> 00:55:05,977
and see if there's anything
you missed, sound good?

1347
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,280
- Andy is my friend.

1348
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,113
- Was.

1349
00:55:10,967 --> 00:55:12,160
- That's mean.

1350
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,820
- Yes, but it also the truth,

1351
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,552
and that is a point I wanna make with you.

1352
00:55:16,552 --> 00:55:18,940
(police radio chattering)

1353
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,620
- Andy was my friend.

1354
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,030
- Mm-hmm.

1355
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,640
- So was Logan.

1356
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,683
They were good people, family.

1357
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,890
We had all been friends
for a really long time.

1358
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,780
The day started out at
Andy and Logan's house.

1359
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,240
Andy was really sweet when I got there,

1360
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,400
she, uh, she actually
made breakfast for me,

1361
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,350
and, uh, we were talking about the trip,

1362
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:42,823
and how cold it was gonna be.

1363
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,620
When we went upstairs to get ready

1364
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,210
she even let me borrow her makeup.

1365
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,090
She was always like that, you know,

1366
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,623
just so sweet and generous.

1367
00:55:52,843 --> 00:55:56,030
Uh, when Blake and Logan got to the house

1368
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:59,023
I noticed the mittens he bought for Andy.

1369
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:02,770
I had Blake help me
carry my bags downstairs,

1370
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:05,780
and, um, we stopped to grab
some last minute things

1371
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,883
in the laundry room.

1372
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,340
- You really pay a lot of
attention to Blake don't you?

1373
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,050
Are you sure you guys didn't have anything

1374
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:16,140
kinda going on in secret?

1375
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,090
- What do you mean?

1376
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,610
- Well, do you really want
me to explain it to you?

1377
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,400
- Blake is like a brother to me, okay.

1378
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,460
Plus he's dating one of my best friends.

1379
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,430
- Was.

1380
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:28,263
- Yeah.

1381
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:32,480
- Okay, so let's just say
you two are very close.

1382
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,363
- We're all very close.

1383
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:41,163
Anyway, um, the trip
started out really great,

1384
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,330
then we got caught in the storm.

1385
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:48,441
Blake, hit some kind of a,
a tree trunk or something,

1386
00:56:48,441 --> 00:56:50,573
and we just, we had to get out of the car,

1387
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,020
that's when we saw this place.

1388
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,987
We all just kinda settle down
once we got in the building,

1389
00:56:57,987 --> 00:57:00,483
and we were really
shaken up from the crash,

1390
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,560
that's when we decided to separate.

1391
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,030
I don't know why we did that.

1392
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:11,900
The last time I remember seeing Andy,

1393
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:16,483
she was going off to look
for Logan or food, I think.

1394
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:22,990
What made me go downstairs
was I heard this scream,

1395
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:25,670
and, and I saw lights reflecting

1396
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,030
off the back wall of the stairwell.

1397
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,180
And I didn't know what was happening

1398
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,730
but I knew there was something,

1399
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,230
and that's when I saw Logan

1400
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:34,233
standing over Andy's body in the room.

1401
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,520
He tried to warn me that
there was someone else here.

1402
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,950
And then Blake and Ella found us,

1403
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:42,550
and, and Blake tried
to get Andy out of here

1404
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:44,550
but the storm was just, it was too much.

1405
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,970
Logan wanted us all to be
able to defend ourselves

1406
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:53,073
and so he took the ax.

1407
00:57:55,565 --> 00:57:57,765
And he wanted us all
to take bow and arrows.

1408
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:01,789
I think that might have been a mistake.

1409
00:58:01,789 --> 00:58:05,650
- Why do you say that that
might have been a mistake?

1410
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:08,460
- Whoever was here used that against us.

1411
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:11,460
I mean they shot Logan
just to try to get the car,

1412
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,910
they obviously didn't have
anything of their own.

1413
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,090
- Where were you when Logan was shot?

1414
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:20,133
- The janitor's room, all three of us.

1415
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:22,360
It was really stupid,

1416
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,310
I mean we should have
stayed together, Logan too.

1417
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:28,660
The killer must have just been
waiting for the right moment.

1418
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,760
- Well, how did you even know he was shot?

1419
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,670
- He yelled.

1420
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:38,510
It was, it was loud, and, and
there was so much commotion.

1421
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:40,483
Blake ran up the stairs into the lobby,

1422
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:43,960
and then we just saw Logan
lying there in the snow.

1423
00:58:45,187 --> 00:58:47,810
And Blake and I ran out to him,

1424
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:50,470
and we yelled for Ella to call the police,

1425
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:53,320
you know to see if the
phones were back up again.

1426
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,750
- And they were?
- Yeah.

1427
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:55,693
- How convenient.

1428
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,960
What time do you think this was?

1429
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:04,250
- I don't know, maybe
about four in the morning.

1430
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:08,060
- So you never really saw who shot Logan,

1431
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:12,090
and you never really saw who killed Andy.

1432
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,930
- No, no, we just heard them.

1433
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:15,980
Logan saw him though.

1434
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:18,733
- Was he sure it was a him?

1435
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:24,450
- No, um, no, I, I don't know, he, uh.

1436
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:28,980
- Mia, is there anything
else you wanna tell me

1437
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:33,980
about Ella and Blake that
maybe you're not telling me?

1438
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:38,670
You do know what they say about the truth?

1439
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,070
Are you sure there's not anything else?

1440
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:46,423
- No.

1441
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,130
- Okay.

1442
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:54,070
(ominous music)

1443
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:56,410
- You were cheating on my sister

1444
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:58,090
since the day you started dating.

1445
00:59:58,090 --> 00:59:59,310
- Would you knock it off, man?

1446
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:00,173
- She loved you.

1447
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,820
- Let me point out that
this is the first time

1448
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:05,220
I've ever heard you refer
to her as your sister.

1449
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:06,500
She woulda loved that too.

1450
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,333
Too bad she's not alive to hear it.

1451
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:10,000
- You don't get to talk about
my family that way, Blake.

1452
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,870
- I'm your family!

1453
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,273
Me!

1454
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,010
You always hated Andy.

1455
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:17,410
And what because your dad happened

1456
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:18,370
to fall in love with her mom?

1457
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:20,520
- While they were still married!

1458
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,490
They were all cheating on each other,

1459
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,520
telling lies, keeping secrets.

1460
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,320
You were the only one I could trust,

1461
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,730
and I thought that if you loved Andy

1462
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:29,510
fine I could deal with it.

1463
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:32,690
But then I just realized that
you were like all the rest,

1464
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:33,893
you're a liar too.

1465
01:00:34,987 --> 01:00:37,680
- You wanna hate me, Logan, that's fine,

1466
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,616
but I'm not going down for
something you did, you hear me?

1467
01:00:40,616 --> 01:00:42,810
What were you doing in
that room over her body?

1468
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:45,167
Where'd you go? You were
in there before any of us.

1469
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:48,800
- You really think that I
could kill my own sister?

1470
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,590
Who the hell do you
think you're talking too?

1471
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:52,340
- I'm not so sure anymore.

1472
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:53,173
- Logan!

1473
01:00:53,173 --> 01:00:54,380
- What are you gonna do, Logan?

1474
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:57,443
- You're just as much of a
suspect as the rest of us.

1475
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:01,010
- Why don't you share your story?

1476
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:02,710
I wanna hear what you have to say.

1477
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:17,530
- Well, this morning I
went to the magazine rack

1478
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:19,420
to get some stuff for our trip,

1479
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:23,053
you know snowboard stuff.

1480
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,110
And then Blake showed
up a few minutes later.

1481
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:30,010
After that we went to go pick up Ella,

1482
01:01:31,406 --> 01:01:33,356
and then we went straight to our house.

1483
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:37,860
When we got there I went upstairs

1484
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:42,040
and Andy was talking to herself,
Mia was doing something,

1485
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,230
but the one thing that I remember the most

1486
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:48,603
was you two coming out
of the laundry room.

1487
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:53,130
I knew something was going on,

1488
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:54,580
I could see it in your faces,

1489
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:58,153
and I should have said
something right then and there.

1490
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:04,583
I was going to use this
trip to come clean to Mia.

1491
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,720
It wasn't enough that
you had to date my sister

1492
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,540
but that you had to cheat on her

1493
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,140
with the one girl that I wanted.

1494
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:19,493
I was with you the whole time.

1495
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:24,453
When we came here is when we separated,

1496
01:02:26,337 --> 01:02:29,283
and I went down the stairs
because I saw a light on.

1497
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,550
At the end of the hall
there was a, a boiler room,

1498
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:37,470
and I went in because I was
gonna look for like a breaker

1499
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:40,310
or a circuit panel or
something to get the lights on

1500
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:41,960
but it was useless without a key.

1501
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,723
I checked a phone, there
wasn't a dial tone,

1502
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:50,703
and that's when I heard the scream,

1503
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:55,363
and I heard like a thud,
or stomp, or something.

1504
01:02:57,330 --> 01:02:59,400
And so then I grabbed a flashlight

1505
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,643
and that gave me the
courage to go down the hall.

1506
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:07,650
And that's when I saw someone.

1507
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:13,023
I saw a figure or something
come out of that room,

1508
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:17,703
and I thought it was one of
you playing a joke on me,

1509
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:25,573
but then I saw Andy dead in the dark.

1510
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,400
When I went in that room

1511
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:34,603
there was blood all around
and not a soul in sight.

1512
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,497
But then when I saw that she wasn't, uh.

1513
01:03:45,386 --> 01:03:47,740
- Why didn't you call for help?

1514
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,820
- Yeah, when I came in you
were just frozen there.

1515
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,913
- I was like in shock or something.

1516
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,740
Okay, I, I, I couldn't believe-

1517
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:55,860
- Let's just pretend for a second

1518
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,910
that every word of your story is true,

1519
01:03:57,910 --> 01:04:00,280
so you heard noise,
was it like a crash or?

1520
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,980
- It was like a, a stomp, or, or a thud,

1521
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,177
or a bang or something.
- Like a gun.

1522
01:04:05,177 --> 01:04:08,943
- No, no, no, it was, uh, a loud,

1523
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:12,600
look storytime is over, all right.

1524
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,990
Don't we need to be
worried about the killer?

1525
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:17,514
You know he's gotta
still be her somewhere.

1526
01:04:17,514 --> 01:04:18,347
- Oh, god.

1527
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,370
- You think he's still here?

1528
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:26,040
Then let's find him.

1529
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,320
There's four of us, we have
lights, we have weapons,

1530
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,530
let's find them.

1531
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:32,423
- What if we don't find anyone?

1532
01:04:33,509 --> 01:04:36,443
- Then we'll know whose
story's true and whose wasn't.

1533
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:38,863
- Fine.

1534
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:43,393
Let's go together.

1535
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:47,013
I can show you.

1536
01:04:56,283 --> 01:04:59,700
- Do you guys still think someone's here?

1537
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:03,730
Who did this?

1538
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:07,118
If there's someone else
here show yourself!

1539
01:05:08,408 --> 01:05:10,258
Not gonna let you get away with this!

1540
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:13,817
What'd you do?

1541
01:05:13,817 --> 01:05:17,070
Did you take this hammer here
and throw it in her skull?

1542
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:19,428
Is that what you did? Is
that what you did, huh?

1543
01:05:19,428 --> 01:05:20,635
(hammer whooshes)
(hammer thuds)

1544
01:05:20,635 --> 01:05:21,646
(metal clanging)

1545
01:05:21,646 --> 01:05:23,487
(gentle brooding music)

1546
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:24,803
You okay, Ella?

1547
01:05:26,202 --> 01:05:27,160
(ominous music)

1548
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,579
Let's go check out that back entrance

1549
01:05:28,579 --> 01:05:30,639
where you came in, right?

1550
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:32,722
Let's see that back door.

1551
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:55,460
Has the light out here been on all night?

1552
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,293
- Yeah.

1553
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,620
- It should be locked.

1554
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:00,245
I locked it earlier.

1555
01:06:00,245 --> 01:06:02,355
- I don't think there's anyone back here.

1556
01:06:02,355 --> 01:06:04,303
I don't think there's anyone here at all.

1557
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:07,880
(suspenseful music)

1558
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,880
(dial tone humming)

1559
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:15,967
- Phones are working fine.

1560
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:17,663
- [Logan] What?

1561
01:06:18,615 --> 01:06:19,993
- The phones aren't out.

1562
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:22,140
They're working fine.

1563
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,303
Logan was freaking out.

1564
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:29,240
(suspenseful music)

1565
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:35,013
- Logan, put the ax down, man.

1566
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:39,058
Did you lie to us about the phones?

1567
01:06:39,058 --> 01:06:42,503
- No, no, I didn't kill her.

1568
01:06:43,681 --> 01:06:46,290
I didn't kill her, man, I
just found her like that.

1569
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:47,360
- I don't believe you.

1570
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,410
I don't believe a word you've said.

1571
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:51,000
- She took everything from me!

1572
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,840
She took my family.

1573
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,967
She took my friends.

1574
01:06:54,967 --> 01:06:55,960
Stay away from me!

1575
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,010
- Hey, calm down.

1576
01:06:58,010 --> 01:06:58,970
We can figure this out.

1577
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:00,430
You made a mistake.

1578
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,263
- Stay away from me!

1579
01:07:01,263 --> 01:07:03,951
(Ella screams)

1580
01:07:03,951 --> 01:07:06,451
(door clicks)

1581
01:07:07,344 --> 01:07:09,844
(door clicks)

1582
01:07:15,633 --> 01:07:16,466
(arrow whooshes)

1583
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:19,921
(Logan groans)
(wind blowing)

1584
01:07:19,921 --> 01:07:22,588
(Logan gasping)

1585
01:07:30,386 --> 01:07:32,803
(body thuds)

1586
01:07:34,388 --> 01:07:36,805
(Mia crying)

1587
01:07:41,978 --> 01:07:42,978
- Let it go.

1588
01:07:44,564 --> 01:07:45,564
Put it down.

1589
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:49,080
(Ella crying)

1590
01:07:50,497 --> 01:07:51,330
It's okay.

1591
01:07:53,768 --> 01:07:54,601
Calm down.

1592
01:08:09,443 --> 01:08:10,276
Oh, god.

1593
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:15,305
(door bangs)

1594
01:08:17,128 --> 01:08:18,750
(Ella crying)

1595
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:22,332
(footsteps crunching)

1596
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:25,410
(Mia crying)

1597
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:26,993
- God, I'm so sorry.

1598
01:08:29,191 --> 01:08:30,583
I, I didn't mean to.

1599
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,372
Logan, you made me do it, man.

1600
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,309
What are we gonna do?

1601
01:08:39,309 --> 01:08:40,872
We gotta do something.

1602
01:08:42,639 --> 01:08:45,010
- You think we should wait until morning

1603
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:46,032
for someone to come?

1604
01:08:47,448 --> 01:08:50,746
The phones are working, Blake,
we can call 911, that's it.

1605
01:08:50,746 --> 01:08:52,240
- No, no.

1606
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,440
I, I don't know, I mean
they're already dead.

1607
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,563
They can't be rescued.

1608
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:58,023
We can't call anyone.

1609
01:08:58,023 --> 01:08:58,856
No, we, we can't.

1610
01:08:58,856 --> 01:09:00,073
Mia, you gotta promise me.

1611
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:03,969
- What about her?

1612
01:09:03,969 --> 01:09:04,803
You don't think she's gonna

1613
01:09:04,803 --> 01:09:07,112
tell the police everything that happened?

1614
01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:15,728
- Logan admitted to killing her,

1615
01:09:15,728 --> 01:09:17,660
and I think she'll do whatever we say

1616
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,710
as, as long as she's free from the blame.

1617
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,120
- So what do we tell the police?

1618
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,747
We have to call them.

1619
01:09:25,747 --> 01:09:28,394
- No, the police, no,
no, we can't tell anyone.

1620
01:09:28,394 --> 01:09:29,559
- What?

1621
01:09:29,559 --> 01:09:31,380
- We can bury this.

1622
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:33,270
You and me, we can bury
their bodies both of 'em

1623
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:34,270
and clean up this mess.

1624
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,469
We can get out of here
before anyone comes.

1625
01:09:35,469 --> 01:09:36,930
No one needs to know that we were here.

1626
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:37,809
We can just say that,

1627
01:09:37,809 --> 01:09:40,030
I don't know that we went
to leave without them

1628
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:41,300
'cause we couldn't find them

1629
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,200
and just figured they meet us
later or something, I just-

1630
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,030
- My god, can I have Blake back please?

1631
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:48,020
What is wrong with you?

1632
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:50,120
You just left from a trip
without your girlfriend

1633
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,933
because you couldn't get ahold of her.

1634
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:54,660
- No one has to know she's my girlfriend.

1635
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,263
- That, that won't work, Blake.

1636
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,923
It's not possible.

1637
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,112
It will come back.

1638
01:10:02,639 --> 01:10:03,990
We have to call the police.

1639
01:10:10,357 --> 01:10:12,440
Hey, I am with you, okay?

1640
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:23,516
(Ella whimpering)

1641
01:10:32,688 --> 01:10:34,677
(wind blowing)

1642
01:10:34,677 --> 01:10:37,094
I'm gonna tell police, Blake.

1643
01:10:38,996 --> 01:10:41,702
I'm gonna tell them how we
got stuck here together,

1644
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,969
how you got us in from the storm.

1645
01:10:48,467 --> 01:10:51,532
I'm gonna tell them how
there was someone else here.

1646
01:10:53,587 --> 01:10:55,420
They tried to kill us.

1647
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:00,243
They got Andy first and then Logan.

1648
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,740
They went for the car,
and they saw the damage,

1649
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:07,518
and they realized that
they were stuck here too.

1650
01:11:07,518 --> 01:11:10,673
We, we don't know who they
are, even what they look like.

1651
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:15,112
All we know is that they tried to kill us.

1652
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:17,943
We're the victims here.

1653
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:24,773
Logan, uh, went to dig
us out food from the car,

1654
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,753
and someone shot him.

1655
01:11:31,148 --> 01:11:33,633
We're scared and we wanna go home.

1656
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,645
You kept us safe.

1657
01:11:44,097 --> 01:11:47,323
You stayed with the
girls, and protected us.

1658
01:11:50,467 --> 01:11:52,913
You're the hero, Blake, the survivor.

1659
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:56,040
- But I shot him.

1660
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,293
- No, you didn't!

1661
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,207
He got shot, not by you.

1662
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:06,753
- No, I don't know.

1663
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:08,910
- Nobody knows.

1664
01:12:12,983 --> 01:12:16,478
(dial tone humming)

1665
01:12:16,478 --> 01:12:20,573
(buttons beeping)
(Ella crying)

1666
01:12:20,573 --> 01:12:23,629
(phone ringing)

1667
01:12:23,629 --> 01:12:26,962
- [Operator] 911, what's your emergency?

1668
01:12:27,842 --> 01:12:28,675
Hello?

1669
01:12:29,587 --> 01:12:31,423
(Ella gasps)

1670
01:12:31,423 --> 01:12:33,969
(wind blowing)

1671
01:12:33,969 --> 01:12:37,920
- Okay, okay, we need
to get Ella on same page

1672
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,370
and make our stories match,

1673
01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:41,143
then we'll be fine, we'll be fine.

1674
01:12:47,724 --> 01:12:48,557
- Oh, no.

1675
01:12:48,557 --> 01:12:50,036
- [Blake] Ella!

1676
01:12:50,036 --> 01:12:53,202
(footsteps crunching)

1677
01:12:56,287 --> 01:12:57,853
- The police are on their way.

1678
01:12:59,637 --> 01:13:01,130
- What did you say?

1679
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:01,963
What did you tell them?

1680
01:13:01,963 --> 01:13:03,620
Listen, it's okay, I just need to know

1681
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:04,969
what you said on the phone.

1682
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:09,322
- I told them that we needed help.

1683
01:13:09,322 --> 01:13:10,969
That we got stuck 'cause of the snow,

1684
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:14,973
and that two people are dead.

1685
01:13:16,043 --> 01:13:18,030
- Did you say anything specific?

1686
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:19,862
Anything remotely in detail?

1687
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:25,223
- No, I just told them
that we needed help.

1688
01:13:26,978 --> 01:13:29,750
- Okay, listen, Ella,
when the police get here

1689
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:31,750
we all need to say the same thing, okay?

1690
01:13:32,603 --> 01:13:34,030
Do you understand me?

1691
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:35,780
We all have to be on the same page.

1692
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:41,063
I'm sorry I shot Logan, it was a mistake.

1693
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:44,340
But I believe he killed her.

1694
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:46,760
He killed his sister.

1695
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,809
Who knows what he would have done to us.

1696
01:13:47,809 --> 01:13:49,760
You saw how crazy he got.

1697
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,380
- She was his stepsister.

1698
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:52,920
- Exactly!

1699
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,900
Stepsister he hated and he said so.

1700
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:56,733
When the police get here

1701
01:13:56,733 --> 01:13:58,030
we need to tell them the same thing.

1702
01:13:58,030 --> 01:14:00,830
Okay, there, there was someone
here, they were after us.

1703
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:03,561
They wanted to kill us.

1704
01:14:03,561 --> 01:14:05,410
(siren wailing)

1705
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:08,633
They got Andy, they got Logan.

1706
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,490
Can you do that for us?

1707
01:14:15,306 --> 01:14:17,077
- You shot Logan, Blake.

1708
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:20,901
You killed him.

1709
01:14:20,901 --> 01:14:22,325
No, stay away from me!

1710
01:14:22,325 --> 01:14:23,157
Stop!

1711
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:25,960
- Ella, I need you.

1712
01:14:28,857 --> 01:14:31,040
- Stay away.
- Mia and I both

1713
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,313
need you, please.

1714
01:14:33,505 --> 01:14:35,014
- [Ella] No, stay away.

1715
01:14:35,014 --> 01:14:36,187
- [Blake] Ella.

1716
01:14:36,187 --> 01:14:37,492
(car door bangs)
(police radio chattering)

1717
01:14:37,492 --> 01:14:38,852
- [Mia] There's a bunch of them.

1718
01:14:38,852 --> 01:14:40,223
(car door bangs)

1719
01:14:40,223 --> 01:14:42,693
- Ella, no one has to
take the blame for this.

1720
01:14:44,557 --> 01:14:45,389
No one.

1721
01:14:47,123 --> 01:14:47,956
Please.

1722
01:14:49,938 --> 01:14:50,771
Hey,

1723
01:14:54,036 --> 01:14:54,869
it's okay.

1724
01:14:59,831 --> 01:15:03,331
(police radio chattering)

1725
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,952
Something's up.

1726
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,200
- Okay, we got it?

1727
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,590
- I just needed to hook
some cords up to the monitor

1728
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:19,767
but this should have full surveillance.

1729
01:15:19,767 --> 01:15:20,670
- Did you play it yet?

1730
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:21,719
- No, wanted to wait till you-

1731
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:23,000
- Okay, we'll let's go, let's play.

1732
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,180
Let's roll it, roll footage.

1733
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:29,180
I mean this could be everything.
(gentle melancholic music)

1734
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:31,822
- They're taking her now, look.

1735
01:15:36,353 --> 01:15:39,853
(police radio chattering)

1736
01:15:45,727 --> 01:15:46,559
- [Detective Young] (scoffs) What is this?

1737
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,900
Why can't we see anything?

1738
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,760
- The camera is only set to record

1739
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,020
when it senses movement.

1740
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,230
- Okay, well, it's recording this,

1741
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:54,920
what's moving in the dark?

1742
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,469
- There, someone's in the room.

1743
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,483
- Dammit there she is.

1744
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:26,969
- Is she trying to get in the cabinets?

1745
01:16:37,371 --> 01:16:38,223
(electricity humming)

1746
01:16:38,223 --> 01:16:39,320
- Uh, uh, where did it go?

1747
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,300
What happened?

1748
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,780
Did you turn it off?

1749
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,823
- [Mr. Nielsen] The light turned off.

1750
01:16:43,823 --> 01:16:46,403
- Uh, (sighs) can, can you rewind that?

1751
01:16:47,587 --> 01:16:49,844
(recorder whirring)

1752
01:16:49,844 --> 01:16:52,677
(recorder clicks)

1753
01:16:56,396 --> 01:16:59,728
(gentle brooding music)

1754
01:17:17,278 --> 01:17:19,737
(electricity crackling)

1755
01:17:19,737 --> 01:17:22,780
(head thuds)

1756
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:23,987
She just fell.

1757
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:34,719
Okay, um, fast-forward a little bit,

1758
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:36,620
see if anybody else comes in the room.

1759
01:17:54,538 --> 01:17:57,538
(recorder whirring)

1760
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:08,348
Is there anything else?

1761
01:18:16,161 --> 01:18:18,228
(recorder clicks)

1762
01:18:18,228 --> 01:18:19,061
Whoa.

1763
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:21,743
Uh, he's pretty intense, huh?

1764
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:22,702
(recorder clicks)

1765
01:18:22,702 --> 01:18:25,210
- (sighs) Well, that's
the video from the room,

1766
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:26,183
does that help you?

1767
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:30,020
- Well, it's interesting to see the group,

1768
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:33,550
and they all seem to be against
each other in that room,

1769
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:36,100
and we know that poor Andrea
was in the room alone.

1770
01:18:37,164 --> 01:18:39,990
(sighs) What other cameras do we have?

1771
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:41,933
- Here's the main hallway.

1772
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:46,202
- Hmm.

1773
01:18:50,161 --> 01:18:52,827
(keys clicking)

1774
01:18:57,358 --> 01:18:58,616
(ominous music)

1775
01:18:58,616 --> 01:18:59,993
Uh, yikes.

1776
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,670
Well, that's not good for their story.

1777
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:05,570
- So he killed his friend.

1778
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:08,070
- It looks that way unfortunately.

1779
01:19:08,070 --> 01:19:10,520
On top of that I mean
they're all lying about it.

1780
01:19:11,809 --> 01:19:12,853
They don't know.

1781
01:19:12,853 --> 01:19:13,693
- Know what?

1782
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:15,653
- That she fell.

1783
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:18,053
Freak accident.

1784
01:19:19,550 --> 01:19:20,403
They blame Logan.

1785
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:25,570
All right, I'm gonna need a copy

1786
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:27,460
of that security tape, okay?

1787
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,293
Let's go.

1788
01:19:33,675 --> 01:19:36,840
(group chattering)

1789
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:41,840
Well, good news, we have
some footage, some video,

1790
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:48,253
some cloud, whatever you guys
are calling it these days.

1791
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:51,340
Is there any further
you wanna share with me?

1792
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:54,040
- Video?

1793
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:54,969
- Yeah.

1794
01:19:54,969 --> 01:19:56,590
It's a bird's eye view of everything

1795
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:59,610
that went on here last night,
it's called surveillance.

1796
01:19:59,610 --> 01:20:01,200
- What's on the video?

1797
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,400
- Why don't you tell me?

1798
01:20:07,411 --> 01:20:09,300
- We already did.

1799
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,750
- Did you see who shot Logan?

1800
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:13,320
- No.
- Have you ever fired

1801
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,000
a bow and arrow before?

1802
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,050
- No, sir.
- Really?

1803
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,173
Not even in phys ed?

1804
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:21,600
I mean, I admit it does
seem weird for gym class

1805
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,300
but it does beat running the mile.

1806
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:25,833
No, uh, archery at your school?

1807
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,032
Are you okay?

1808
01:20:30,806 --> 01:20:31,856
Do you need a tissue?

1809
01:20:32,809 --> 01:20:33,643
- No.

1810
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,053
- If you could blame someone
for last night who would it be?

1811
01:20:41,987 --> 01:20:43,660
(police radio chattering)

1812
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:44,493
- Me.

1813
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:48,550
- Now why would you say that?

1814
01:20:50,110 --> 01:20:51,960
- We wouldn't even be at this school

1815
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:54,723
if I had just pulled
over earlier on the road.

1816
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:00,090
I used to just think that
everything happened for a reason

1817
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:04,383
but can't find a reason for any of this.

1818
01:21:07,719 --> 01:21:09,719
- I can't find the reason either, Blake.

1819
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:13,362
There's a lot of that in my line of work.

1820
01:21:21,925 --> 01:21:25,827
- You okay?

1821
01:21:25,827 --> 01:21:27,727
Do you think they really have a video?

1822
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:31,753
- No.

1823
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:33,630
I think he was just trying

1824
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:35,313
to scare me into saying something.

1825
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:39,840
- Do you really think
this is all your fault?

1826
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:53,857
(gentle somber music)

1827
01:22:46,616 --> 01:22:49,082
(door bangs)

1828
01:22:49,082 --> 01:22:50,545
(car engine revving)

1829
01:22:50,545 --> 01:22:53,705
(car beeping)

1830
01:22:53,705 --> 01:22:58,705
(DVD clicks)
(DVD player whirring)

1831
01:22:58,725 --> 01:23:03,725
- All right, we're all set.

1832
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:08,630
Okay, now remember we both take
three paces, turn, and draw.

1833
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:11,670
Now don't look at the camera
or you'll ruin the movie.

1834
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:13,233
- [Both] One, two, three.

1835
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:14,956
- Boom, boom!
- Bang!

1836
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:16,742
- I got you, I got you!
- I got you first!

1837
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:19,825
(Young Logan groans)

1838
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:25,540
- (giggles) Hey, stop, that tickles.

1839
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:28,165
- Ugh, I didn't say cut yet.

1840
01:23:28,165 --> 01:23:29,040
Bang.

1841
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,469
(Young Logan groans)
(Young Blake laughs)

1842
01:23:30,469 --> 01:23:31,623
Okay, you're dead.

1843
01:23:34,088 --> 01:23:34,921
Cut!

1844
01:23:35,889 --> 01:23:38,639
