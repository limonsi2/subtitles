1
00:00:02,898 --> 00:00:05,693
(gentle music)

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:11,574
(gentle music)

3
00:00:17,204 --> 00:00:20,791
(gentle music continues)

4
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:30,718
(gentle music continues)

5
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:33,387
(wings fluttering)

6
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:35,556
- I can't see anything, Dad.
(Craig laughs)

7
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:37,224
- Well, yeah, that's
kind of the point

8
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:38,642
of the blindfolded,
isn't it, birthday girl?

9
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:39,935
(both chuckling)

10
00:00:39,977 --> 00:00:41,604
- All right.
- Here, right up there.

11
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:42,605
- [Grace] Oops.

12
00:00:43,647 --> 00:00:46,817
(gentle piano music)

13
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,320
- This is all mine?

14
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:51,238
- That's right, Little
Ladybug. Your very own garden.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,783
- And you can grow
whatever you want.

16
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:56,369
(Craig chuckles)

17
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,079
- This is the best
birthday ever.

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,914
- Oh, how could I forget?

19
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:03,918
You're gonna need this if you
plan on planting any seeds.

20
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:05,795
- My very own trowel?

21
00:01:07,254 --> 00:01:08,714
- Amanda, remember this
when you use that trowel,

22
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:11,258
the key to any garden's success

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,427
is the love that
you put into it.

24
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:15,388
- I have plenty of love to give.

25
00:01:16,097 --> 00:01:17,723
- Yeah, you sure do.

26
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:20,101
- Dig, dig.
(all chuckling)

27
00:01:20,142 --> 00:01:21,560
(trowel rasping)

28
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:24,355
(gentle music)

29
00:01:25,564 --> 00:01:28,651
(people chattering)

30
00:01:28,693 --> 00:01:32,279
(gentle music continues)

31
00:01:36,992 --> 00:01:40,538
(gentle music continues)

32
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:41,997
(oven bell dings)

33
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,124
- Mom!

34
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:44,542
(footsteps pattering)

35
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,960
(Amanda sniffs)

36
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:50,297
Hmm, (sniffs) smells
like snickerdoodle?

37
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:51,799
- Cinnamon give it away?

38
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:53,634
We've sold out every week

39
00:01:53,676 --> 00:01:55,678
since the new pastor let me
sell them after Sunday service.

40
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,139
- Good because every
cookie sale counts

41
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,099
when the flowers
aren't blooming.

42
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:01,976
(Grace sighs)

43
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:03,978
So much for frost being over.

44
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:05,646
The bloom is so far
behind this year,

45
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:08,441
the only thing we'll be
harvesting for Easter is dirt.

46
00:02:08,482 --> 00:02:10,818
- The harvest calendar
is just an estimate.

47
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,695
It's been off in the past.

48
00:02:12,737 --> 00:02:16,323
Can't control the weather, but
we can control other things.

49
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:19,827
I should hear back soon about
our business loan application.

50
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:21,912
- Can't we just refinance?

51
00:02:21,954 --> 00:02:23,873
- Not with the
mortgage in arrears.

52
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:26,584
Your dad would be proud

53
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,711
of how hard we're
trying, I know that.

54
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:32,715
- We have enough to make it
through Easter, though, right?

55
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,677
- Let's see what the bank
says about our emergency loan.

56
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,849
- I don't know what we'd
do without the farm.

57
00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:43,976
- Well, we won't give up.

58
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:46,812
I can still hope for
an Easter miracle.

59
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:52,193
- Can I take a few of
these for the road?

60
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:53,444
- [Grace] Mm.

61
00:02:55,488 --> 00:02:59,450
- Maybe the tips of the
cafe will be extra big

62
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:01,202
on this extra cold morning.

63
00:03:01,243 --> 00:03:03,829
(Grace chuckles)

64
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:04,747
Okay, I'm gonna go. I love you.

65
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:05,664
- I love you too.

66
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:10,002
* Whoa, oh

67
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:11,754
* Yeah, I've been
through it all *

68
00:03:11,796 --> 00:03:14,048
- Okay. Right behind you.

69
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,174
Here's your coffee.
- Cool.

70
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:16,967
Awesome. Muffin.

71
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:22,056
I have a regular latte and
a double espresso mocha.

72
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:24,100
- Thank you. Have a good day.

73
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:26,894
Thanks. Your regular.

74
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:28,729
Hi.
- Hey.

75
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:29,563
- What can I get you?

76
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:31,399
- Good morning.

77
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,528
I'll have a large lavender
latte with a dash of cinnamon,

78
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:38,489
some agave, and almond
milk, only if you have it.

79
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:40,574
- Yep, sure. Give
me two minutes.

80
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:41,742
- Thank you.

81
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:44,078
Hmm.
- Effie, I'm pretty sure

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,746
I need another two sets of hands

83
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:48,082
to make it through
the morning rush.

84
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:49,542
How do you do it?

85
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,919
- When in doubt, more caffeine.

86
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:53,212
- Ah.
- Cheers.

87
00:03:53,254 --> 00:03:55,923
- Cheers.
(both slurping)

88
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:57,550
Wow.
- Uh-huh.

89
00:03:57,591 --> 00:03:58,884
- Mm.

90
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:00,886
Thank you, again, for
letting me pick up

91
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:02,847
some extra shifts at the cafe.

92
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:04,890
Things are pretty
tight at the farm,

93
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:06,934
at least until the
spring bloom comes in.

94
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:10,771
- Well, I know you'd do
anything to save the farm.

95
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:13,733
For example, used to
love our play dates.

96
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:15,026
You know, the ones
where you just basically

97
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,986
got me to help you weed?

98
00:04:17,778 --> 00:04:19,530
(both laughing)

99
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:22,658
- My dad always said that
pulling weeds built character.

100
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,951
- Uh-huh.

101
00:04:23,993 --> 00:04:25,161
(Amanda sighs)

102
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:26,620
- Almond milk, lavender latte,

103
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:27,830
two pumps of agave,
dash of cinnamon.

104
00:04:27,872 --> 00:04:28,831
- Thanks, Amanda.

105
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:31,000
- Have we met before?

106
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:34,420
- No, you just have a nice,

107
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:37,006
beautiful, labeled name tag.

108
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:40,051
- Oh, (chuckles) I
forget that's there.

109
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:41,093
- Mm.

110
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:43,804
Mm.

111
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:46,849
This might be the best
latte I've ever had.

112
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,061
Mm-mm, nope. That's all yours.

113
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:51,812
- Um, that's a $14 tip.

114
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:54,482
- And I'd give you a
15th dollar if I had it.

115
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:55,900
You see, some
people drink coffee

116
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:58,736
to, you know, drink coffee.

117
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:02,239
I drink coffee because
it's an experience,

118
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,492
and yours, it has
just the right amount

119
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:06,744
of lavender and agave. (slurps)

120
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:09,455
Mm, not too sweet,
not too floral,

121
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:11,540
and just the right temperature
for a cold day like today.

122
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:15,002
All right?
- Well, um, well, thank you.

123
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:16,837
- [Derrick] No, thank you.

124
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,339
- I've never heard anybody
talk about coffee like that.

125
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:20,633
- Well, that's
because we just met.

126
00:05:21,842 --> 00:05:24,512
- Right.
- I appreciate your artistry,

127
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:28,224
your effort, most
of all, that smile.

128
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:29,183
Have a good one.

129
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:30,142
- Have a good day.

130
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,188
- Um, okay, that was adorable.

131
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,315
- What? He appreciated
my artistry.

132
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:38,526
- Uh, that was a $14 tip.

133
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:41,028
Think he was appreciating
more than just your artistry.

134
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,279
Just saying.

135
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:43,531
Hi, Gladys.

136
00:05:43,572 --> 00:05:45,408
- Oh, hi, Gladys.

137
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,243
- Amanda Raymond. You're
in the coffee business now.

138
00:05:47,284 --> 00:05:51,122
- Uh, just temporarily, until
the spring bloom comes in.

139
00:05:51,163 --> 00:05:54,208
- Fingers crossed that spring
is hiding around the corner.

140
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,793
I'll just take a black.
- Oh. Yeah.

141
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:57,545
- You know, I really
do miss seeing

142
00:05:57,586 --> 00:05:59,380
those dedication
arrangements from your farm

143
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:01,507
in the church
lobby every Sunday.

144
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:04,218
- That was really more
of my dad's thing.

145
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,970
- I know you two were close.

146
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:09,306
Just know how much those
arrangements lifted my spirits.

147
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:11,225
I sure hope we get
to see them again,

148
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:13,018
and we hope to
see you again too.

149
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,440
- Um, I'm sure you'll see
my mom in service on Sunday.

150
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:21,902
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

151
00:06:21,944 --> 00:06:22,945
- Bye.

152
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:27,616
Everything good?

153
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:30,995
- Uh, yeah, just...

154
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:33,914
It's hard, sometimes, when
people talk about my dad.

155
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:35,416
Brings up a lot.

156
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,918
- Everyone has nothing
but love for him.

157
00:06:39,336 --> 00:06:40,546
I do too.

158
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:46,177
Except some of those gardening
puns were way too cheesy.

159
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:48,262
- Um, what was a good one? Oh.

160
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:49,513
"You grow, girl."

161
00:06:49,555 --> 00:06:51,182
- Uh, "What incarnation?"

162
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:52,099
(both laughing)

163
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:55,436
(bell jingles)

164
00:06:55,478 --> 00:06:57,313
- Oh. Here she comes again.

165
00:06:57,355 --> 00:06:58,814
- Who?
- Someone who seems to lack

166
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:00,733
a little sunshine in her life.

167
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:02,568
Hi.

168
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:05,112
- I'll take the usual.

169
00:07:05,154 --> 00:07:06,947
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

170
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:08,991
(Effie clears throat)

171
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:11,118
- Muffin. Muffin.

172
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,704
Nice day we've been having.

173
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:17,124
Thank you.
- Here you go.

174
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,417
- Keep the change.

175
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:19,418
- Oh.

176
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,836
- Have a good day!

177
00:07:23,255 --> 00:07:25,633
Not one for conversation
much, is she?

178
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:28,010
- Yeah, she's a
real tough cookie.

179
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:30,096
- Speaking of cookies-

180
00:07:30,137 --> 00:07:31,806
- Oh?

181
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:33,641
- I think we deserve a
little cookie celebration

182
00:07:33,682 --> 00:07:35,935
after having survived
that morning rush.

183
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:37,770
- [Effie] Mm.

184
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:39,355
- My mom made a fresh batch of
snickerdoodles this morning.

185
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:40,648
- Oh my gosh, oh my
gosh, oh my gosh.

186
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,817
Mm.
(snickerdoodle crunching)

187
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:44,110
Mm!

188
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,070
No words. I have no words.

189
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:47,780
- Yum?
- Yes, that.

190
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:50,116
Mm! Wait.

191
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:53,703
Idea. How many of these
can your mom make?

192
00:07:53,744 --> 00:07:56,372
'Cause we could sell
them in the cafe.

193
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:57,998
- I was hoping you
would say that.

194
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,166
- You set me up?

195
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,043
- Mm, little bit.
- Oh.

196
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:03,462
And whatever profits we make
can go right back to the farm.

197
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:05,256
- Okay, you don't go that far.

198
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:07,758
- Uh-huh, Amanda, um, I just
died and went to cookie heaven,

199
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,344
so, yeah, we should do that.

200
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:11,137
(snickerdoodle crunches)

201
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:13,597
(both laughing)

202
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,182
Hi. How can I help you?

203
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:17,935
(shovel thudding)

204
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:18,936
(Amanda sighs)

205
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:20,021
- Come on.

206
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:23,065
(shovel thuds)
(Amanda sighs)

207
00:08:23,107 --> 00:08:24,275
(shovel clatters)

208
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:27,111
(Amanda sighing)

209
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:29,947
(gentle music)

210
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:34,744
How come they
haven't come out yet?

211
00:08:34,785 --> 00:08:37,747
- [Craig] Because they
still need time, Ladybug.

212
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:40,791
- But what if something is
wrong? I'm getting worried.

213
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:44,253
- You know what I do
when I'm worrying?

214
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:46,172
I say a little prayer.

215
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:47,673
- Why do you do that?

216
00:08:47,715 --> 00:08:50,885
- Because it lets me
give my worries away

217
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:53,262
instead of letting
them weigh me down,

218
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:56,807
and I know God will
take them from me.

219
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:59,393
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

220
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:00,728
- I guess I'll try.

221
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:06,400
Hi, God. It's me,
Amanda Raymond.

222
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:08,277
I'm really nervous
about my garden.

223
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:12,073
Please help them grow to be
big, beautiful, and healthy.

224
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:13,783
Amen.

225
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,619
How was that?

226
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,454
- That was perfect.

227
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:19,580
(Craig chuckles)

228
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:22,625
(gentle music)

229
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,589
(Amanda sighs)

230
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:31,759
- I know that you'd probably
be praying right now.

231
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:37,973
Prayers can't melt ice,
they can't bring you back.

232
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:41,936
(tires screeching)

233
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:43,145
(car crashes)

234
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:45,022
(door clacks)

235
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:46,148
Hey, are you okay?

236
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,817
- Oh, I think so.

237
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:49,735
Yeah, no bumps, no bruises.
Oh, thank goodness.

238
00:09:49,777 --> 00:09:51,404
- Do you live nearby?

239
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:54,490
- Closer to town. My husband
and I just moved here.

240
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:58,160
Yeah, I'm gonna call him and
he's gonna come and get me.

241
00:09:58,202 --> 00:09:59,829
- Okay, okay.

242
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,248
Um, I can also get your
car out with our tractor.

243
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:05,751
But, um, should we go inside?
It's freezing out here.

244
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:07,878
- Oh, you're a godsend.

245
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:10,506
- Amanda.
- Oh. Lori.

246
00:10:10,548 --> 00:10:11,924
- [Amanda] Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

247
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:13,259
Just watch your step there.
- Yeah.

248
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,510
I'm just a little shooken up.

249
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:16,387
- [Amanda] I'll
put the kettle on.

250
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:19,473
- Nothing better than a hot
cup of cocoa on a frigid day.

251
00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:20,725
(Amanda chuckles)

252
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:22,351
- Cheers to that.

253
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:26,272
- Oh, you have a lovely home.

254
00:10:26,313 --> 00:10:27,648
You live here with your husband?

255
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,192
- No, I am single. (chuckles)

256
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:31,652
It's my parents' house.

257
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:35,156
Well, um, actually,
it's my mom's house.

258
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:37,283
My dad died last year.

259
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:38,701
- Sorry to hear that.

260
00:10:39,827 --> 00:10:43,205
I did see the sign on
your farm out front,

261
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:45,958
The Raymond Pick Your
Own Bouquet Flower Farm?

262
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,210
- Yeah, that's our
family business.

263
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:51,005
I know, it doesn't look
like much right now,

264
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:53,841
but, hopefully, in a few weeks,

265
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:56,427
it'll be a cornucopia
of color out there.

266
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:58,512
- Oh, yeah, the weather.

267
00:10:58,554 --> 00:10:59,847
It's either they're a gardener's

268
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:02,183
greatest ally or worst enemy.

269
00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:03,017
(both chuckling)

270
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,602
Let me guess.

271
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:07,438
Pink peonies and maybe a
row of purple hyacinths

272
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,858
to complement them, and, oh,
I can imagine a wide array

273
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,402
of tulips, perfect
Easter flower,

274
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:17,281
and, maybe a hybrid or two
when they cross-pollinate.

275
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:20,701
- Okay, Lori, most people
don't know the difference

276
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:23,662
between a daisy and a daffodil.

277
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:25,414
What's your secret?

278
00:11:25,456 --> 00:11:27,708
- My whole life has been the
business of flowers, dear.

279
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,418
- So you're a florist?

280
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,003
- Was for 40 years.

281
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:34,006
I'm officially retired
now. It's just a hobby.

282
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:36,675
I don't even compete
in the annual

283
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:38,719
Easter Flower Arranging
Competition anymore.

284
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:41,138
- But you have.
Have you ever won?

285
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,891
- Oh, I haven't, but I
placed second last year.

286
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:45,601
My highest finish.

287
00:11:45,643 --> 00:11:47,853
- So, um, I'm sitting
with floral royalty,

288
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:49,897
is what you're saying.

289
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:52,692
- Certainly not the queen, but
perhaps in her royal court.

290
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:54,694
(Amanda chuckles)

291
00:11:54,735 --> 00:11:56,529
- Um, I can go get my tractor

292
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,947
and we can get you
back on the road?

293
00:11:57,988 --> 00:12:00,533
- Mm. Oh, I certainly
appreciate that.

294
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:03,494
Thank you so much.

295
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,623
Amanda?
- Hmm?

296
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:10,501
- Is there anything that
I can do to repay you

297
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:12,002
for your help with my car?

298
00:12:12,044 --> 00:12:13,921
- Um, well, can
you pull a miracle

299
00:12:13,963 --> 00:12:15,881
and melt the ice out there?
(Lori chuckles)

300
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:17,383
- You really need a bloom, huh?

301
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:18,968
- You know the flower business.

302
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,928
We make most of our money
during certain seasons,

303
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,806
and with the Easter bloom
being so far behind-

304
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:26,642
- Well, sadly, my alter
ego isn't Mother Nature,

305
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:32,148
but what about that Easter
Flower Arranging Competition?

306
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,818
I mean, the prize is $20,000.

307
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,780
- Wow, I mean, that
would be enough

308
00:12:39,822 --> 00:12:41,949
to get us through the season.

309
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:46,454
Except there's just
one tiny, huge problem.

310
00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:49,331
I'm a farmer, not a florist.

311
00:12:49,373 --> 00:12:50,875
I mean, that's why we
have our customers pick

312
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,084
their own bouquets.

313
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:53,753
- Well, that's where I come in.

314
00:12:53,794 --> 00:12:55,337
I mean, I know six weeks
is not a lot of time,

315
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:58,632
but I can teach you
what you need to compete

316
00:12:58,674 --> 00:13:00,217
if you're willing to learn.

317
00:13:00,926 --> 00:13:02,678
- The cost of flowers alone-

318
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,263
- No, no, no. I can handle it.

319
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:07,349
And we can always practice
with silk flowers.

320
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:08,809
I mean, think about it,

321
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:14,065
we might even dethrone
Queen Constance Hughes.

322
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:15,941
- Constance?

323
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:17,234
- Yeah, she's won
10 years in a row.

324
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:19,695
Oh, oh, Amanda.

325
00:13:19,737 --> 00:13:23,783
Come on, (chuckles) just
take my number here.

326
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:26,911
(pen scratching)

327
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:31,957
Here you go.
(paper rustles)

328
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:35,086
- This is a very generous offer,

329
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:38,672
and I'm sure it'd
be fun to learn,

330
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:41,592
but I couldn't compete.

331
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:45,221
I'd be going against people
with years of experience.

332
00:13:46,263 --> 00:13:48,682
Thank you, but I'll
just have to find some

333
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:50,351
other way to keep us afloat.

334
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:52,228
- Okay.

335
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:55,690
But call me if you
change your mind.

336
00:13:55,731 --> 00:13:58,401
- I will. Come on,
let's go get your car.

337
00:13:58,442 --> 00:13:59,568
- Yes, please.

338
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:04,031
(gentle piano music)

339
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:05,366
- No, I understand.

340
00:14:06,117 --> 00:14:07,576
You're just doing your job.

341
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:09,412
Thank you.

342
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:12,581
- Hey. Is everything okay?

343
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:14,250
- That was the bank, Amanda.

344
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:18,754
Our last two years of
sales just aren't enough

345
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:21,424
to give them confidence
to approve the loan.

346
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:24,135
- But that was our Hail
Mary to get caught up.

347
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:29,056
(somber music)

348
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,729
I have to do it.

349
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,938
- Do what?

350
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:39,233
- The statewide Easter
Flower Arranging Competition.

351
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:41,861
The first prize is $20,000.

352
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:43,779
It's at least enough
to keep us afloat

353
00:14:43,821 --> 00:14:45,114
until the bloom comes.

354
00:14:45,156 --> 00:14:46,949
- Flower arranging?

355
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:49,035
Is this a skill that
you've been hiding from me?

356
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:54,290
- Hiding from everyone,
including myself.

357
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,127
But I met a florist
yesterday and she's retired,

358
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:01,422
but she's competed before,
and she said she'd teach me.

359
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,217
- Your dad would
love to hear that.

360
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:07,428
- I have to at least try.

361
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,637
Maybe our last hope.

362
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:12,349
- Well, little bit of
hope is all we need.

363
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:19,231
- Amanda, I have to ask,

364
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:22,735
what made you change your
mind about the competition?

365
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:27,948
- Our business loan
application got denied,

366
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,494
so winning the
competition prize money,

367
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:34,497
it feels like maybe
the farm's last hope.

368
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:38,292
- Well, then let's
not waste any time.

369
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,586
Take a look at
your blank canvas.

370
00:15:42,004 --> 00:15:43,672
(Amanda sighing)

371
00:15:43,714 --> 00:15:45,257
Oh, I know that look.

372
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:47,968
- The "I have no idea
where to begin" look?

373
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,928
(Lori laughs)

374
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:50,096
- Yeah, that one.

375
00:15:50,137 --> 00:15:52,056
Let's just have fun to start

376
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:54,350
and we'll see what
we're working with.

377
00:15:57,186 --> 00:16:02,525
- Uh, so peonies and
ranunculus, iris,

378
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:07,655
and, go to a classic,
got some roses.

379
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:09,073
- Yeah, you do
know all the names

380
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:10,908
of the flowers
and how they grow,

381
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,412
but I wanna see you
actually create something.

382
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:16,831
- I think that my
creative side is

383
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:18,332
still hibernating for winter.

384
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:19,834
(Lori chuckles)

385
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,960
- It's a good thing
there's no pressure.

386
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:22,837
Come on, just have fun.

387
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:25,339
- Okay. You asked for it.

388
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:26,340
(hands patting)

389
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:28,676
(gentle music)

390
00:16:28,718 --> 00:16:29,719
Do some...

391
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:35,391
And, um, mm-hmm.

392
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:39,520
Roses.

393
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:46,485
(Amanda claps)

394
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:52,074
I call it "A Thorn
Amidst Roses."

395
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:53,909
- [Lori] Mm-hmm.

396
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:55,578
(Lori chuckles)
- It's rough, I know,

397
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:59,623
but I am ready and willing
to do whatever it takes.

398
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:01,375
- That's the spirit.

399
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:03,169
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You got a lot to learn.

400
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,588
There are five principles
to floral design.

401
00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:08,174
You master those, you
got a chance to win.

402
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:11,177
They are harmony, contrast,
purpose, balance, and...

403
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:15,139
Uh, I'm gonna keep
the last one a secret.

404
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:17,224
- A secret?

405
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:20,144
Well, I mean, don't I need all
five to win the competition?

406
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:21,604
- A secret for now at least.

407
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:23,898
I mean, it's something
that you can only learn

408
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,900
after you've succeeded
at the first four.

409
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:28,444
But let's get on with it.

410
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:31,238
Now, the first
principle is harmony.

411
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:34,408
- Harmony?
- Yeah.

412
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,660
We're going on a field
trip for this one.

413
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:39,038
Come on, let's take a walk.

414
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,247
- Okay.

415
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,960
(gentle music)

416
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:46,712
- Your lesson awaits.

417
00:17:47,254 --> 00:17:48,923
- [Amanda] Inside?

418
00:17:48,964 --> 00:17:50,466
- Oh, is everything okay?

419
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:56,639
- I, I haven't been back
inside since my dad's funeral,

420
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:59,392
and that was over a year ago.

421
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,770
- So it brings back a lot.

422
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:03,938
(door thuds)

423
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:04,939
- A lot.
(alarm chirping)

424
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,940
- [Derrick] Hey, Mom!

425
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:07,108
- Oh, Derrick.

426
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:08,943
- Hey.
- Perfect timing.

427
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:10,569
Meet Amanda Raymond.

428
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:12,905
She's the flower protege
I was telling you about.

429
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:17,535
- We've met. Uh,
Mr. Lavender Latte.

430
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:21,539
- Mm-hmm. It's good to see
you, minus the name tag.

431
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,707
(Amanda chuckles)

432
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:25,543
I'm Derrick, the new pastor.

433
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:27,294
It's a pleasure.

434
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:29,380
Well, I don't wanna get in
the way of flower training.

435
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:32,675
Uh, late for choir
practice myself, so...

436
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:34,135
* La la la

437
00:18:34,176 --> 00:18:35,803
- Oh.
(Derrick clears throat)

438
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:37,430
- As you can hear, I need
all the help I can get.

439
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:39,432
- Well, we're on our
way there as well.

440
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:41,434
- All right, I'll
see you inside.

441
00:18:42,518 --> 00:18:46,355
- Um, only if, of
course, you're ready.

442
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,484
- Yeah.

443
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:51,610
(door thuds)

444
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:52,570
(door clacks)

445
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:55,573
(choir vocalizing)

446
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:02,288
(choir continues vocalizing)

447
00:19:03,497 --> 00:19:05,249
- I just need a moment.

448
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,876
- Take your time.

449
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:13,340
(choir vocalizing)

450
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,720
(gentle piano music)

451
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:24,769
(gentle piano music continues)

452
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,228
- Thank you. Just thank you.

453
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:30,733
Pink was Sonya's
favorite color. Yeah.

454
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:35,988
(gentle piano music continues)

455
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:42,745
- Lori, I just can't.

456
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,333
(gentle piano music continues)

457
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,294
(door clacks)

458
00:19:58,469 --> 00:20:00,513
I know, I'm ruining the lesson-

459
00:20:00,554 --> 00:20:02,890
- No, no. Don't feel
bad for one sec.

460
00:20:04,225 --> 00:20:05,684
You know, it's not one
of the five principles,

461
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:07,770
but the key to any
successful arranger

462
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:08,771
is the ability to adapt.

463
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:09,730
It's not...

464
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,275
Not every arrangement's gonna
go exactly as you want it to.

465
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:15,027
(door thuds)

466
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:16,612
- Amanda, everything okay?

467
00:20:17,947 --> 00:20:22,952
- Yeah, I'm just not ready
to go back in there, Pastor.

468
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:26,956
- Please, it's only Pastor
on Sundays. It's Derrick.

469
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:28,749
Don't be so hard on yourself.

470
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,752
If you're not ready,
it's on your time. Okay?

471
00:20:31,794 --> 00:20:33,421
And I'd be happy to
open the door for you

472
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:35,339
if and when that time comes.

473
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:38,843
- I appreciate it.

474
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:42,179
Um, it's very chivalrous.

475
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:43,764
- Well, I was raised well.

476
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:45,057
(Lori chuckles)

477
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:46,392
Well, I'll let
you two get to it.

478
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:47,768
Hope to see you again.

479
00:20:49,353 --> 00:20:51,647
(gentle guitar music)

480
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:54,525
(record clatters)

481
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,318
- [Amanda] This
is like a antique.

482
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,778
- It's very retro.

483
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:02,241
Now, for your lesson, I want
you to pay special attention

484
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:04,326
to each person's solo.

485
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:08,080
* As I went down to the river

486
00:21:08,122 --> 00:21:09,165
- Soprano.

487
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:10,875
* Studying about that

488
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,168
- Alto.

489
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:13,669
* And who shall

490
00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:14,712
- Tenor.

491
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:16,005
* The starry crown

492
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:19,091
- The bass. (chuckles)

493
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,259
- Right, okay. I'm following.

494
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:21,844
(Lori chuckles)

495
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:23,471
- Here's the best part.

496
00:21:23,512 --> 00:21:27,141
* Let's go down, come on down

497
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:29,101
- The harmony.

498
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:30,436
- Yes.

499
00:21:30,478 --> 00:21:32,688
So, I think we can agree

500
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:41,447
that, individually, these
flowers are lovely, right?

501
00:21:41,489 --> 00:21:42,448
- Right.
- Now, I want you

502
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,824
to close your eyes.

503
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:46,494
Close your eyes.

504
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:49,038
And I want you to imagine
that the quartet is singing.

505
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:53,292
* Let's go down, come on down

506
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:57,004
* O sisters, let's go down

507
00:21:57,046 --> 00:21:58,923
* Down in the river to pray

508
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:00,007
- Voila.

509
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:02,927
(Amanda chuckles)

510
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:04,261
- How did you...

511
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:07,139
- Your first
lesson, Grasshopper.

512
00:22:07,181 --> 00:22:10,059
- I'm more of a Ladybug person.

513
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:11,644
- Noted.

514
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:15,981
See, the key is to look
for ways for the flowers

515
00:22:16,023 --> 00:22:17,525
to complement one another.

516
00:22:19,193 --> 00:22:23,072
Now, you give it a try, Ladybug.

517
00:22:23,114 --> 00:22:25,199
(both chuckling)

518
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:26,450
- Okay.

519
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:31,205
- So as you can see, we've
substantially upped our offer,

520
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:32,581
really taking into consideration

521
00:22:32,623 --> 00:22:35,209
the value and
acreage of the land.

522
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:36,877
- Tom.

523
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:39,463
We've told you before, and
we will tell you again-

524
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:41,549
- It's not for sale. Hi, Amanda.

525
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,175
Your father was a
good friend of mine,

526
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:44,760
and I'm trying to
help you and your mom

527
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:47,722
by providing
another alternative.

528
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,892
- That a letter from
the mortgage company?

529
00:22:51,934 --> 00:22:55,104
- We're getting more
and more behind,

530
00:22:55,146 --> 00:22:57,064
and without the business loan-

531
00:22:57,106 --> 00:22:58,858
- It's a notice for foreclosure.

532
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:01,360
- Again, I don't wanna
be in this position,

533
00:23:01,402 --> 00:23:02,695
but I'd like to
give you the option

534
00:23:02,737 --> 00:23:04,989
to earn something
substantial and fair

535
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:09,493
based on what you've built,
as opposed to other options.

536
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:10,578
(Grace sighs)

537
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:12,371
- We still have time, Tom.

538
00:23:12,413 --> 00:23:15,374
And you're right, you
and Craig were close,

539
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:16,751
so you'd know that he would-

540
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:19,587
- Decline my offer.
Respectfully.

541
00:23:21,464 --> 00:23:23,090
I'm rooting for you.

542
00:23:23,132 --> 00:23:26,010
Reach out to me before you
hear from the bank again.

543
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:29,930
You know where to find me.

544
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,686
(door clacks)

545
00:23:35,728 --> 00:23:37,563
(door thuds)
- Foreclosure?

546
00:23:38,522 --> 00:23:40,066
How did this happen?

547
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:42,610
- No reserves and bad weather,

548
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:45,112
and your dad was the
flower whisperer.

549
00:23:45,154 --> 00:23:48,199
- I should have moved back
here when Dad asked me to.

550
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,743
Maybe then I would know
more about the business and-

551
00:23:50,785 --> 00:23:54,789
- Listen to me. This
is not your fault.

552
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,707
Have faith that things
will turn around.

553
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:58,709
- Why would God do this to us,

554
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:00,711
after everything we
went through with Dad

555
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:03,798
and frost and, now, foreclosure?

556
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:06,050
- God doesn't work
like that, Amanda.

557
00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:11,514
I tell you what,
I'll get more hours

558
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:13,891
at the accounting firm,
and I'll keep baking,

559
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:16,102
and that'll give
you time to practice

560
00:24:16,143 --> 00:24:17,978
so you can win that competition.

561
00:24:19,522 --> 00:24:20,815
How'd it go today?

562
00:24:22,316 --> 00:24:25,236
- Yeah, um, sorry, but

563
00:24:26,737 --> 00:24:29,657
I wouldn't count on
winning the competition.

564
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:33,202
(Grace sighs)

565
00:24:34,662 --> 00:24:37,998
- God wants us to be joyful,

566
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,961
but that doesn't mean we have
to be happy all the time.

567
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:47,508
There will be times in our
lives of struggle, of loss.

568
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:50,803
But even when there are tears
rolling down your cheeks,

569
00:24:50,845 --> 00:24:53,013
there can still be
joy in your heart.

570
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,308
Ultimately, I want you
all to remember that

571
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,185
during the Easter season.

572
00:24:58,227 --> 00:25:01,689
Joy can be steadfast in sorrow

573
00:25:02,523 --> 00:25:04,900
and triumphant in tribulation.

574
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:06,986
Amen.

575
00:25:07,028 --> 00:25:08,529
- [Congregation] Amen.

576
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:10,031
- Amen.
- Amen.

577
00:25:11,365 --> 00:25:13,200
- Ah, James, pleasure.

578
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:15,578
Thanks, Jimmy. Good to see you.

579
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:16,704
- Sweetheart.

580
00:25:16,746 --> 00:25:18,164
Oh, sweetheart, great.

581
00:25:18,205 --> 00:25:21,709
- Ah, thank you.
Papa, thank you.

582
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:24,211
- Wonderful sermon today, D.

583
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:26,797
Or should I say, Pastor D?

584
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,674
- Samuel Stevens in the flesh.

585
00:25:28,716 --> 00:25:30,676
It's good to see you, my friend.

586
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:32,386
Don't tell me you came all this
way just to hear me preach?

587
00:25:32,428 --> 00:25:34,847
- I know you're busy
now, but hear me out.

588
00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:36,474
I'm starting a new
venture that could be

589
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:38,726
a really exciting
opportunity for you.

590
00:25:38,768 --> 00:25:41,062
A way to connect to
your two passions.

591
00:25:41,103 --> 00:25:43,606
- Okay, all right, well,
we should find time

592
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:44,982
to chat, catch up.

593
00:25:45,024 --> 00:25:46,317
- We'll talk soon.
- Good to see you.

594
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,610
- [Samuel] You too.

595
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:50,071
- [Derrick] Hmm.

596
00:25:50,112 --> 00:25:51,155
- Pastor.

597
00:25:51,197 --> 00:25:52,531
- Ah, (clears throat).

598
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:53,657
- It's still Sunday.

599
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:55,743
- Okay, you get a hall pass.

600
00:25:55,785 --> 00:25:58,412
- Uh, lavender latte?
Just the way you like it?

601
00:25:58,454 --> 00:26:00,664
- And what did I
do to deserve this?

602
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:03,501
- You know, token of
my, um, appreciation

603
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:06,045
for your very generous
tip the other day.

604
00:26:06,087 --> 00:26:08,005
But I don't wanna keep
you from the congregation.

605
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:10,424
- Please, my congregation's
too busy gobbling up

606
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:11,717
your mama's banana bread.

607
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:14,553
- Mm.
- So, um, I've got an hour

608
00:26:14,595 --> 00:26:16,305
until my next service.

609
00:26:16,347 --> 00:26:17,765
Do you care for a walk?

610
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:20,101
- Uh, sure.

611
00:26:27,608 --> 00:26:28,943
(dog barking)

612
00:26:28,984 --> 00:26:31,737
So how are you
liking town so far?

613
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:35,074
- I love it, although,
for me, it's a bit cold.

614
00:26:35,116 --> 00:26:36,909
(both chuckling)

615
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:38,703
Yeah, my parents grew up in
Vermont, so they're used to it,

616
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:41,539
but I was raised
mostly in the south.

617
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,957
You know, come to think of it,

618
00:26:42,998 --> 00:26:46,085
people here are like
the weather there, warm.

619
00:26:46,127 --> 00:26:47,628
(Amanda chuckles)

620
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,380
- [Amanda] Your mom
said that are a bit

621
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:50,840
of an outdoorsy type.

622
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:55,094
- That's my mom, loves
talking about her son.

623
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:56,554
(Amanda chuckles)

624
00:26:56,595 --> 00:26:58,264
But she's right, I do
love being outside.

625
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:00,224
It's my happy place.

626
00:27:01,475 --> 00:27:04,729
- She also, uh,
mentioned four-wheeling?

627
00:27:05,271 --> 00:27:06,480
- Did she?

628
00:27:06,522 --> 00:27:08,774
- And ax throwing.

629
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:11,569
- Of course she did.
- Mountain biking.

630
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,112
- What else?
- Uh, skydiving.

631
00:27:13,154 --> 00:27:14,447
- Well, that's
actually a lot of fun.

632
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:16,907
(both laughing)

633
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:20,244
- If I'd met you today,
I never would've guessed.

634
00:27:21,662 --> 00:27:24,707
- Is it the clean-shaven,
tailored suit jacket,

635
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:26,167
polished dress shoes thing?

636
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,878
It's not your typical
mudding outfit.

637
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:31,839
- Can't say I've
met too many pastors

638
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:34,425
who like ax throwing
and skydiving.

639
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:37,470
- Well, if you can't tell, it
means I'm doing a good job.

640
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:38,971
- What does that mean?

641
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:43,893
- I'm new to this town,
so I don't want people,

642
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:48,481
you know, knowing about
my extreme adventure
side, just yet.

643
00:27:48,522 --> 00:27:50,691
- You think that
they'd really care

644
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:52,860
what you do for fun
when you're not working?

645
00:27:52,902 --> 00:27:54,528
- They have a lot
of trust in me.

646
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,530
And being a pastor is
a big responsibility.

647
00:27:56,572 --> 00:27:58,491
I don't want people
thinking that I'm reckless

648
00:27:58,532 --> 00:28:00,910
and irresponsible
during my downtime.

649
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:02,661
I hope you can understand.

650
00:28:03,496 --> 00:28:06,457
Can we just keep
this between us?

651
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:07,875
- Seriously?

652
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:09,960
- Seriously.

653
00:28:10,002 --> 00:28:12,171
- Uh, sure.

654
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,926
Only if you tell me
more about skydiving.

655
00:28:18,094 --> 00:28:20,513
- [Derrick] I never
prayed so hard in my life.

656
00:28:20,554 --> 00:28:23,349
(gentle music)

657
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:28,938
(soil rustling)

658
00:28:28,979 --> 00:28:31,232
- Amanda. It's six
in the morning.

659
00:28:31,273 --> 00:28:32,983
What are you doing?

660
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:34,652
- I couldn't sleep and wanted
to start prepping things

661
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:36,821
before heading
Lori's later today.

662
00:28:37,363 --> 00:28:38,739
- Well, let me help.

663
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:42,368
(bag rustling)

664
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,161
Saw you got to meet her son.

665
00:28:45,204 --> 00:28:48,374
- Mom, it's not like
that. He's the pastor.

666
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:53,212
And, I don't know, we're
just in two different places.

667
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:57,758
- You know, when I met your
father at the farmer's market,

668
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,177
we were both searching
for the perfect bouquet

669
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:02,722
and both found it
exactly the same time.

670
00:29:02,763 --> 00:29:06,308
And he insisted on
buying it, and I let him.

671
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,977
(Grace chuckles)

672
00:29:08,018 --> 00:29:10,312
Only to have him purchase
it and give it to me.

673
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:12,940
But while your father was a man

674
00:29:12,982 --> 00:29:15,818
who was incredibly
firm in his faith,

675
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,863
he was also a man who was
always willing to meet me

676
00:29:18,904 --> 00:29:21,449
wherever I was in
my faith journey.

677
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:25,536
- And I just met Derrick. I
don't know that much about him.

678
00:29:25,578 --> 00:29:28,873
- Well, and I'm sure he has
a lot to learn about you too.

679
00:29:29,582 --> 00:29:31,042
Just do yourself a favor,

680
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,877
don't let your own
fears get in the way.

681
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:36,130
(wings fluttering)

682
00:29:37,214 --> 00:29:39,884
(Grace gasps)

683
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:42,428
You were always Dad's Ladybug.

684
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:45,264
- The ladybugs are returning.

685
00:29:46,057 --> 00:29:47,558
There's a slight bit of hope

686
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,018
that the ground
will soften soon.

687
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:52,271
(wings fluttering)

688
00:29:52,313 --> 00:29:56,400
- Well, a slight bit
of hope is all we need.

689
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:58,569
(Amanda chuckles)

690
00:29:58,611 --> 00:30:00,279
Mm.

691
00:30:00,321 --> 00:30:01,739
(birds chirping)

692
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:05,117
(patrons chattering)

693
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:09,830
- Amanda. Are all of these
table arrangements yours?

694
00:30:09,872 --> 00:30:11,749
- Uh, yeah, I'm practicing

695
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:14,126
for a flower
arranging competition.

696
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:16,295
- Why are you
using fake flowers?

697
00:30:16,337 --> 00:30:17,838
- Well, the frost,

698
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,257
and I don't have the
budget for fresh ones,

699
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:22,385
so I've just been using
fake ones to practice.

700
00:30:22,426 --> 00:30:24,970
- Practicing with fake
flowers? That just won't do.

701
00:30:25,012 --> 00:30:26,972
Please, let me donate
to your flower fund,

702
00:30:27,014 --> 00:30:29,392
and I'll take all of
your mom's cookies too.

703
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:31,435
- No, no. No, you can't.

704
00:30:31,477 --> 00:30:33,145
Um, that's too generous.

705
00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:35,439
- Of course I can.

706
00:30:35,481 --> 00:30:38,234
Consider it an investment
in you and your talent.

707
00:30:38,275 --> 00:30:40,069
My reward comes in the
beautiful arrangements

708
00:30:40,111 --> 00:30:43,948
I get to see from you,
here and at church.

709
00:30:45,991 --> 00:30:47,410
- Thank you, Gladys.
(Gladys chuckles)

710
00:30:47,451 --> 00:30:49,704
* Running into freedom

711
00:30:49,745 --> 00:30:53,457
* Dancing barefoot
like it's Eden *

712
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:56,585
(bell jingles)

713
00:30:56,627 --> 00:30:57,795
(door thuds)
(Amanda chuckles)

714
00:30:57,837 --> 00:30:59,547
- Okay, as much as I would love

715
00:30:59,588 --> 00:31:01,132
to take a break and go shopping,

716
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:03,634
shouldn't we be
focusing on flowers?

717
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:05,803
- Oh, Ladybug, you
have much to learn.

718
00:31:05,845 --> 00:31:08,431
- Lori. Right on time.

719
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:09,807
- [Lori] Tiff.

720
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:11,267
- Amanda, so good to see you.

721
00:31:11,308 --> 00:31:13,185
I am so excited that
you came in today.

722
00:31:13,227 --> 00:31:14,812
Our spring line just came out,

723
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:17,148
and let me tell
you, it is amazing.

724
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:19,984
- Feels like you should be
focusing more on pushing scarves

725
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:21,819
and jackets with
the current weather.

726
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:24,488
- Well, you know what,
if you think spring,

727
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,032
then it will come.

728
00:31:26,073 --> 00:31:28,159
But what do you say we
try on some outfits?

729
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,245
- Yes. Amanda, I want you
to pick out an outfit.

730
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:32,997
- Any outfit?

731
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,498
- Whatever moves you.

732
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:36,917
* Yeah, yeah

733
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,419
* You plant the seed of love

734
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:41,464
* You plant the seed
of love in my heart *

735
00:31:41,505 --> 00:31:46,927
* And it's bursting in
and out of my chest *

736
00:31:47,553 --> 00:31:48,429
(curtains rattling)

737
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:49,680
(Tiff gasps)

738
00:31:49,722 --> 00:31:52,266
- [Tiff] Very cute, bright.

739
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:53,142
- Oh, it's bright.

740
00:31:53,184 --> 00:31:54,393
Mm-mm!
- No, no, no.

741
00:31:54,435 --> 00:31:55,144
- What do you think?

742
00:31:56,062 --> 00:31:58,189
- It's lovely, but...

743
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,273
No, follow me.

744
00:32:00,983 --> 00:32:04,278
* Follow where the junk goes

745
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,114
(Lori humming)

746
00:32:08,282 --> 00:32:09,909
- There you go.

747
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,035
(curtains rattling)
(Tiff gasps)

748
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:12,536
- Ooh.
(camera snaps)

749
00:32:12,578 --> 00:32:14,330
- Yes.
(curtains rattling)

750
00:32:14,372 --> 00:32:15,831
- It's really cute.
(Lori chuckles)

751
00:32:15,873 --> 00:32:18,584
Ooh, angelic, yes.
(camera snaps)

752
00:32:18,626 --> 00:32:20,753
(curtains rattling)
- Ooh.

753
00:32:20,795 --> 00:32:22,713
So I think...

754
00:32:22,755 --> 00:32:23,881
(Tiff laughs)

755
00:32:23,923 --> 00:32:25,758
Okay.
(curtains rattling)

756
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,760
Oh.
- No, I'm not...

757
00:32:27,802 --> 00:32:29,387
(Amanda laughs)

758
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:30,721
Try something else.
(curtains rattling)

759
00:32:30,763 --> 00:32:32,056
- [Lori] Oh my.

760
00:32:32,098 --> 00:32:34,517
- Oh my gosh,
looks very, very...

761
00:32:35,518 --> 00:32:36,519
(curtains rattling)
- Ooh.

762
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,647
- [Lori] Please, twirl, twirl.

763
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:40,815
(camera whirs)

764
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:42,608
(curtains rattling)

765
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,944
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah, baby.

766
00:32:45,945 --> 00:32:52,368
(Amanda chuckles)
(curtains rattling)

767
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:56,038
So, what seems like a fun
fashion show is actually

768
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,873
a valuable lesson
in floral design.

769
00:32:57,915 --> 00:32:59,959
You're gonna learn
that very soon.

770
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:04,171
(gentle piano music)

771
00:33:07,174 --> 00:33:08,175
Come on.

772
00:33:12,513 --> 00:33:16,684
- So is there a reason you're
avoiding the Constance?

773
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:23,524
- Constance and I, well,
we used to be best friends.

774
00:33:23,566 --> 00:33:24,400
- Used to be?

775
00:33:24,442 --> 00:33:25,943
- Yeah.

776
00:33:25,985 --> 00:33:29,071
We worked in the same
floral shop for years.

777
00:33:29,113 --> 00:33:31,907
Why, she had such
an eye for design.

778
00:33:31,949 --> 00:33:34,076
Yeah, there was
so much laughter.

779
00:33:34,118 --> 00:33:36,328
We worked so many
hours in that shop,

780
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:39,790
creating arrangements
for every occasion.

781
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:41,751
It's missing something.

782
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,210
- Something bright.

783
00:33:43,878 --> 00:33:45,463
- And yellow.

784
00:33:46,964 --> 00:33:48,340
- [Both] A sunflower.

785
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:51,677
- There was a signature
to all our designs.

786
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:54,430
It was a single sunflower.

787
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:55,931
I like to think
that it represented

788
00:33:55,973 --> 00:33:58,142
the brightness of our friendship

789
00:33:58,184 --> 00:34:02,104
until, um, circumstances
changed that forever.

790
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,151
You see, we had a plan.

791
00:34:08,235 --> 00:34:11,113
We were going to open
our own floral shop.

792
00:34:12,448 --> 00:34:17,161
And then I, then I met Don,
fell in love, got engaged.

793
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:20,498
He relocated for work.

794
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:22,708
And I had to make a choice,

795
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:29,215
follow my fiance or keep my
promise to my best friend.

796
00:34:32,218 --> 00:34:34,178
Broke Constance's heart.

797
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,847
She stopped talking to
me, and I did the same.

798
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,766
There was no coming
back from it.

799
00:34:39,683 --> 00:34:40,976
- Sorry to hear that.

800
00:34:41,018 --> 00:34:42,561
- You can imagine
how tense it is

801
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:44,480
when we see each other every
year at the competition.

802
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:46,691
And, now, I mean,
thanks to my son,

803
00:34:46,732 --> 00:34:48,359
we're practically neighbors.

804
00:34:49,485 --> 00:34:51,487
- Why haven't you ever
tried to reconcile?

805
00:34:51,529 --> 00:34:54,532
- I think we're both just
too proud to forgive.

806
00:34:58,077 --> 00:35:01,414
(gentle piano music)

807
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:05,960
So, take a look at
this first outfit.

808
00:35:06,001 --> 00:35:08,254
You see how the black
skirt really makes

809
00:35:08,295 --> 00:35:10,631
the red top stand out even more?

810
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:12,091
- Yeah, it pops.

811
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:13,718
- Yeah. It doesn't
have to be just color.

812
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:15,594
I mean, look at this one
with the free-flowing skirt

813
00:35:15,636 --> 00:35:17,179
and the fitted top.

814
00:35:17,221 --> 00:35:19,890
- So shapes.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

815
00:35:19,932 --> 00:35:23,769
And the stripes here
with the solid color?

816
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:25,146
- Patterns.
- Yeah, that's right.

817
00:35:25,187 --> 00:35:26,689
You're learning.

818
00:35:26,731 --> 00:35:28,691
The second principle
is contrast,

819
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:32,028
how contrasting colors,
pattern, shapes, textures,

820
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:35,031
can all make things
stand out even more.

821
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:38,200
Now, look, I made
this one earlier.

822
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:41,704
It's not terribly
exciting, is it?

823
00:35:41,746 --> 00:35:42,997
- Could use a boost.

824
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,541
- Yeah, I think so.

825
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:47,251
Okay.

826
00:35:47,293 --> 00:35:49,879
(gentle piano music)

827
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,422
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

828
00:35:55,342 --> 00:35:57,595
- So what you're saying is

829
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:01,557
that contrasting things
can come together

830
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,061
to create something
that is beautiful.

831
00:36:05,102 --> 00:36:06,312
- Exactly.

832
00:36:07,813 --> 00:36:09,607
- Kinda like you and Constance.

833
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:16,197
- You. You caught
me in my own lesson.

834
00:36:17,573 --> 00:36:20,368
- Maybe you have
something to learn too.

835
00:36:24,121 --> 00:36:26,457
- I think it's
too late for that.

836
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:31,379
But you know what, I am
gonna go make us some lunch,

837
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,714
you're gonna practice
contrasting arrangements,

838
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:36,759
and then I'm gonna see what
you have when I get back.

839
00:36:38,636 --> 00:36:39,637
- Okay.

840
00:36:40,721 --> 00:36:43,516
(gentle music)

841
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:48,604
- Hey.

842
00:36:48,646 --> 00:36:50,439
- Oh, hi.

843
00:36:50,481 --> 00:36:52,483
- Are you in the floral zone
or can I say a quick hello?

844
00:36:53,442 --> 00:36:55,111
- I think I would
have to be skilled

845
00:36:55,152 --> 00:36:58,280
to be in the zone,
so come on in.

846
00:37:00,074 --> 00:37:01,575
- So I have to ask,

847
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:05,329
which one of these
flowers is your favorite?

848
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:08,708
(Derrick sniffs)
- Uh, a favorite flower,

849
00:37:08,749 --> 00:37:11,794
that's like picking
a favorite child.

850
00:37:11,836 --> 00:37:16,048
I mean, I guess I would
have to say the hydrangea.

851
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,008
- Oh.
- Or maybe on second thought,

852
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,554
carnations or,
nope, maybe roses?

853
00:37:21,595 --> 00:37:24,390
I don't know. It's too,
too difficult to do.

854
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:27,143
- I love seeing how
passionate you are about them.

855
00:37:27,184 --> 00:37:29,770
(gentle piano music)

856
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:33,441
Well, flower protege, I'll
leave you to your craft.

857
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:37,862
But I do have one very
important question.

858
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,701
(Derrick clears throat)

859
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:45,870
Will you accept this rose?

860
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:50,666
(Amanda laughs)

861
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:56,213
- Um, well, after
careful consideration-

862
00:37:56,756 --> 00:37:57,423
- [Derrick] Mm-hmm?

863
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:01,510
- I will gladly
accept this rose.

864
00:38:01,552 --> 00:38:04,055
- You have my heart
pounding for a second there.

865
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:07,058
(Amanda laughs)

866
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:08,809
I have another question for you.

867
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:14,690
(gentle music)

868
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:23,741
(gentle music continues)

869
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,578
Hi.

870
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,414
- Is this because
of you, Pastor?

871
00:38:30,456 --> 00:38:32,083
- Ask your daughter.

872
00:38:32,124 --> 00:38:34,919
(gentle music)

873
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:42,051
All right, everyone, right
this way. Don't be shy.

874
00:38:42,093 --> 00:38:44,678
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

875
00:38:56,732 --> 00:38:57,650
(birds chirping)

876
00:38:57,692 --> 00:38:59,443
So what's up?

877
00:38:59,485 --> 00:39:01,779
- Well, like I said Sunday,
I'm starting a new venture.

878
00:39:01,821 --> 00:39:03,531
It's a new mountain
retreats program.

879
00:39:03,572 --> 00:39:06,158
We're doing week-long
spiritual retreats

880
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,619
for young men up in
the Shenandoah Valley.

881
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:10,830
It's a great experience
for our retreatants

882
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:12,873
to be in nature and pray.

883
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:14,041
- [Derrick] Hmm.

884
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,626
- I've actively been looking

885
00:39:15,668 --> 00:39:18,254
for a spiritual
leader to guide them.

886
00:39:19,588 --> 00:39:22,800
But then it hit me, you're
the perfect guy for the job.

887
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:24,510
God, the mountains,

888
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:27,179
it has Derrick Matthews
written all over it.

889
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:28,556
(Derrick sighs)

890
00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:30,224
- I mean, Sammy,
you know I would do

891
00:39:30,266 --> 00:39:31,976
just about anything for you.

892
00:39:32,017 --> 00:39:35,312
I mean, I wouldn't be here
right now if it wasn't for you.

893
00:39:36,022 --> 00:39:37,398
It's just-

894
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,316
- I know relocation
is inconvenient,

895
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:41,110
given you just moved here,

896
00:39:41,152 --> 00:39:43,571
but this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

897
00:39:43,612 --> 00:39:45,781
Come on, don't you
miss the mountains?

898
00:39:45,823 --> 00:39:47,283
- More than anything.

899
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:53,039
But, uh, I don't
rock climb anymore.

900
00:39:54,331 --> 00:39:56,417
- That's not the only
thing this is about.

901
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:58,419
Your story is powerful.

902
00:39:59,128 --> 00:40:01,672
The agony, the tears.

903
00:40:01,714 --> 00:40:03,549
I wanna be able
to use your story

904
00:40:03,591 --> 00:40:05,551
to draw others closer to God.

905
00:40:10,014 --> 00:40:11,098
(Samuel sighs)

906
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,767
Please really think on it.

907
00:40:12,808 --> 00:40:15,394
Our first retreat starts
shortly after Easter, so...

908
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:18,481
- So you need an answer soon.

909
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:23,569
(Derrick sighs)

910
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:26,405
(finger tapping)

911
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:28,366
- A new concoction? Why not?

912
00:40:28,407 --> 00:40:31,744
I wanna see what your creative
side's been brewing up.

913
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:34,121
Vanilla. Solid.

914
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:36,290
Ooh, cardamom, um-

915
00:40:36,332 --> 00:40:38,918
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, I know that you,

916
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:41,837
Amanda, are still kind
of a coffee novice,

917
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:44,298
but, um, I just...

918
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,675
Let me let you in on a
little industry secret.

919
00:40:46,717 --> 00:40:48,636
You never combine
vanilla with cardamom.

920
00:40:48,677 --> 00:40:51,847
They're totally different,
opposite, flavor profiles.

921
00:40:51,889 --> 00:40:53,808
They don't work together.

922
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:55,309
Uh, yeah.
- Okay.

923
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:58,938
Don't think, just
experience it. (sniffs)

924
00:40:58,979 --> 00:41:02,024
- Yes, it's just that the
sweetness of the vanilla...

925
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:06,153
(Effie chuckles)

926
00:41:06,195 --> 00:41:07,571
Contrasts perfectly
with the spice

927
00:41:07,613 --> 00:41:08,864
and complexity of the cardamom.

928
00:41:08,906 --> 00:41:10,408
You're a genius. What?

929
00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:12,660
- No, just a good student.

930
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:14,870
- We have to put this on the
regular menu, like, right now.

931
00:41:14,912 --> 00:41:16,205
What do you wanna call it?

932
00:41:16,247 --> 00:41:19,333
- Maybe, how about
Ladybug Latte?

933
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,419
(bell jingles)

934
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,422
- Ooh, two pumps, extra
handsome incoming.

935
00:41:24,463 --> 00:41:27,007
Ooh, Mr. Lavender Latte.

936
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:28,884
- Mm-hmm.
(Effie clears throat)

937
00:41:28,926 --> 00:41:30,219
- Hello.
- Hi.

938
00:41:30,261 --> 00:41:32,012
- Good morning, Amanda, Effie.

939
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:33,848
- Hi.
- I'll do my usual,

940
00:41:33,889 --> 00:41:35,015
please and thank you.

941
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:36,392
- Oh, you know what, actually,

942
00:41:36,434 --> 00:41:38,436
you should try
Amanda's new creation,

943
00:41:38,477 --> 00:41:41,230
the Ladybug Latte,
Mr. Lav, mm, Pastor.

944
00:41:41,272 --> 00:41:42,440
(Effie clears throat)

945
00:41:42,481 --> 00:41:44,942
- Right. Sure, Ladybug Latte.

946
00:41:44,984 --> 00:41:46,444
That sounds very unique.

947
00:41:46,485 --> 00:41:47,862
(Amanda chuckles)

948
00:41:47,903 --> 00:41:49,822
It's Amanda's
creation, I'll try it.

949
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:51,032
(Derrick slurps)

950
00:41:51,073 --> 00:41:54,994
Mm. Mm, that is, that is divine.

951
00:41:55,036 --> 00:41:56,412
Well, thank you. It's delicious.

952
00:41:56,454 --> 00:41:58,539
- Oh, um, Amanda,
great shift today.

953
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:01,042
Uh, you should go home.

954
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:02,209
- Uh, but don't I-

955
00:42:02,251 --> 00:42:03,794
- No, no, no, no.

956
00:42:03,836 --> 00:42:05,546
Actually, um, we're out
of your mom's cookies,

957
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:08,424
so I'm gonna need you to
make another batch of those.

958
00:42:09,175 --> 00:42:11,427
- Uh, yes!

959
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:13,554
Ah, cookies, mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

960
00:42:13,596 --> 00:42:15,306
And it would be so much easier,

961
00:42:15,347 --> 00:42:18,601
um, if there were two pairs
of hands helping you do that.

962
00:42:18,642 --> 00:42:20,811
I have to stay here,
though, so I just...

963
00:42:20,853 --> 00:42:24,065
I wonder if there's anyone
else who could help you.

964
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:25,566
- [Amanda] Mm-hmm, hmm.

965
00:42:26,776 --> 00:42:29,570
- Oh, um, yeah, I
mean, the whole reason

966
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:31,405
I came in today was
to get a little break

967
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:33,407
from my Sunday preparations.

968
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:35,409
I'd be happy to lend
a stirring hand.

969
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:36,911
Of course, if you don't mind.

970
00:42:36,952 --> 00:42:37,953
- No, she doesn't.

971
00:42:39,038 --> 00:42:40,414
- I don't mind.

972
00:42:40,456 --> 00:42:42,041
(dial whirring and clicking)

973
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:45,544
(stand mixer whirring)

974
00:42:45,586 --> 00:42:47,296
- Have you done this before?

975
00:42:47,338 --> 00:42:49,423
- What?
- Have you done this before?

976
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:51,425
- Oh, um.
(dial whirring)

977
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:54,095
- Have you done this before?

978
00:42:55,346 --> 00:42:57,098
- Is it that easy
to tell? (laughs)

979
00:42:57,139 --> 00:42:58,641
- Just a little.

980
00:42:58,682 --> 00:43:01,060
- My mom normally takes
charge in the kitchen.

981
00:43:01,102 --> 00:43:02,645
I just kinda follow her lead.

982
00:43:02,686 --> 00:43:03,938
- Yeah, I never
would've guessed that.

983
00:43:03,979 --> 00:43:06,941
(Amanda chuckles)

984
00:43:06,982 --> 00:43:10,736
- So, um, how did you get
into the business of God?

985
00:43:10,778 --> 00:43:12,321
- Ah, I see you changing
the subject now, huh?

986
00:43:12,363 --> 00:43:15,324
- Oh, just, you know,
redirecting away

987
00:43:15,366 --> 00:43:16,992
from this floury fiasco.

988
00:43:17,034 --> 00:43:18,285
(Derrick chuckles)

989
00:43:18,327 --> 00:43:20,121
I was just kinda curious.

990
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:21,622
- You know, to tell you
the truth, I never thought

991
00:43:21,664 --> 00:43:23,499
I'd be a preacher or a pastor.

992
00:43:25,418 --> 00:43:28,045
I went to business
school, of all places.

993
00:43:28,087 --> 00:43:31,215
Quickly found out the
corporate world was not for me,

994
00:43:31,257 --> 00:43:33,008
so I decided to
follow my passion

995
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:35,845
for the great outdoors
and teach rock climbing.

996
00:43:35,886 --> 00:43:39,515
I loved it, for
years, but, um...

997
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:44,979
And one event, uh,
changed my life.

998
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:49,567
I fell, 60 feet.

999
00:43:50,735 --> 00:43:53,612
Yeah, cracked my vertebrae
in multiple places,

1000
00:43:53,654 --> 00:43:55,364
had five surgeries.

1001
00:43:55,406 --> 00:43:57,283
Doctor said I'd
never walk again.

1002
00:43:58,534 --> 00:44:01,746
- Derrick, I'm so
sorry to hear that.

1003
00:44:02,371 --> 00:44:03,539
- Yeah.

1004
00:44:04,957 --> 00:44:09,045
Yeah, that time in the
hospital, it was like my desert.

1005
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:12,590
I didn't have much to turn to.

1006
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:15,468
But then I met Samuel Stevens.

1007
00:44:15,509 --> 00:44:18,137
He was my occupational
therapist.

1008
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:20,598
He not only taught
me how to walk again,

1009
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:22,558
but he taught me about God.

1010
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:25,061
He saved my life.

1011
00:44:25,978 --> 00:44:27,813
I'd do just about
anything for him.

1012
00:44:27,855 --> 00:44:30,566
He gave me his
granddaddy's Bible.

1013
00:44:30,608 --> 00:44:33,652
I started reading it,
haven't put it down since.

1014
00:44:33,694 --> 00:44:36,739
That book, it gave me hope.

1015
00:44:37,573 --> 00:44:39,116
Hope turned into healing and,

1016
00:44:39,158 --> 00:44:42,161
before I knew it, I
was walking again.

1017
00:44:43,412 --> 00:44:47,166
- Wow. I mean, that's
an amazing story.

1018
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:49,668
- Yeah.

1019
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:54,382
- But do you ever wonder
how you would feel

1020
00:44:54,423 --> 00:44:55,925
if you were never healed?

1021
00:44:57,385 --> 00:44:58,719
- Of course I did.

1022
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:02,223
But I'm a firm
believer in faith.

1023
00:45:03,724 --> 00:45:07,937
You see, things
happen for a reason,

1024
00:45:09,021 --> 00:45:11,315
even if you can't
see it in the moment.

1025
00:45:11,357 --> 00:45:12,733
- Faith.

1026
00:45:12,775 --> 00:45:16,654
Yeah, (chuckles)
that's a hard one.

1027
00:45:16,696 --> 00:45:17,863
- Yeah, it is.

1028
00:45:19,615 --> 00:45:22,118
Especially when things
aren't going your way.

1029
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,953
- Kinda like now.

1030
00:45:24,954 --> 00:45:25,955
- Yeah.

1031
00:45:28,332 --> 00:45:29,875
Care to share?

1032
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:33,254
I mean, it's just me
and a big pile of dough.

1033
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:36,215
(both chuckling)

1034
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:41,762
- So I've been struggling
a lot with that

1035
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:45,599
because, every year,
my dad would pray

1036
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:47,852
for a bountiful Easter harvest,

1037
00:45:47,893 --> 00:45:53,107
and, every year, it seemed
that his prayers were answered.

1038
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,822
So why did he, of all
people, have a heart attack?

1039
00:46:01,824 --> 00:46:06,162
When he died, I came home
to help my mom on the farm.

1040
00:46:07,538 --> 00:46:11,709
And after his funeral, I
just, I stopped praying,

1041
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:15,671
stopped going to church.

1042
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,424
And then, this year,

1043
00:46:18,466 --> 00:46:23,179
of all years when we needed
our biggest Easter bloom yet,

1044
00:46:24,847 --> 00:46:29,101
we've had the worst
winter in decades.

1045
00:46:29,143 --> 00:46:32,021
So am I supposed to trust
that's just a coincidence

1046
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,190
or is that a punishment?

1047
00:46:35,483 --> 00:46:36,859
- I don't think God's waiting
for us to get outta line

1048
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:38,736
just so He can reprimand us.

1049
00:46:38,778 --> 00:46:41,072
It's not a punishment.

1050
00:46:41,113 --> 00:46:45,076
Look, I like to
believe that God,

1051
00:46:45,117 --> 00:46:47,953
He loves us just as much
in good times as bad.

1052
00:46:49,705 --> 00:46:51,207
Maybe during hard times,

1053
00:46:51,248 --> 00:46:53,667
He just wanting us to get
a little closer to Him.

1054
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:57,963
Comfort, support, love.

1055
00:46:59,173 --> 00:47:01,050
God loves us, always.

1056
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,971
- I mean, you're a pastor, so
you have to say that, right?

1057
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:09,517
- Technically.
(both laughing)

1058
00:47:09,558 --> 00:47:13,062
I am, but I still make mistakes.

1059
00:47:14,605 --> 00:47:17,942
Also, supposed to
take care of people

1060
00:47:17,983 --> 00:47:22,321
and, uh, right now,
getting this flour.

1061
00:47:22,363 --> 00:47:23,364
- Ugh.

1062
00:47:27,201 --> 00:47:28,244
- There.

1063
00:47:30,246 --> 00:47:33,249
(oven bell dings)

1064
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:41,382
- So these are winners
from previous years,

1065
00:47:42,216 --> 00:47:44,969
and then there's mine.

1066
00:47:46,303 --> 00:47:49,473
- Well, there's still
time till Easter.

1067
00:47:50,725 --> 00:47:53,352
(cellphone ringing and buzzing)

1068
00:47:53,394 --> 00:47:54,729
- Oh. Good timing.

1069
00:47:55,688 --> 00:47:57,815
Lori.
- Good morning, Ladybug.

1070
00:47:57,857 --> 00:48:00,651
- Hey, please tell me that
you have another lesson ready

1071
00:48:00,693 --> 00:48:02,778
because I still don't
feel like I'm getting it.

1072
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,864
- Patience makes perfect.

1073
00:48:04,905 --> 00:48:08,868
It's time for your third
principle: purpose.

1074
00:48:08,909 --> 00:48:10,953
Now, we've been working
on floral arrangements,

1075
00:48:10,995 --> 00:48:13,998
but it's important that
every design says something

1076
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,876
on a more deeper,
personal level.

1077
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:19,545
You have to find inspiration
outside the flowers

1078
00:48:19,587 --> 00:48:21,255
to put into the flowers.

1079
00:48:22,214 --> 00:48:23,466
- Okay, I'm following.

1080
00:48:23,507 --> 00:48:25,134
- So here's what
I want you to do.

1081
00:48:25,176 --> 00:48:27,595
The church is hosting
an Easter basket raffle

1082
00:48:27,636 --> 00:48:29,055
tomorrow evening at Parish Hall

1083
00:48:29,096 --> 00:48:31,015
to raise money for
the local food bank.

1084
00:48:31,057 --> 00:48:34,018
Church members and non-church
members are creating

1085
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,562
and donating
individualized baskets.

1086
00:48:36,604 --> 00:48:38,481
Now, the items in these baskets,

1087
00:48:38,522 --> 00:48:41,901
they all mean something very
personal to their curators.

1088
00:48:41,942 --> 00:48:45,905
- So you want me to
arrange an Easter basket,

1089
00:48:45,946 --> 00:48:47,740
but how is that
supposed to make me

1090
00:48:47,782 --> 00:48:49,450
a better floral arranger?

1091
00:48:52,244 --> 00:48:53,287
Lori?

1092
00:48:54,497 --> 00:48:55,915
- Sorry, dear, um,

1093
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:00,294
not every lesson reveals
itself right away.

1094
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,216
- Okay. I will do my best.

1095
00:49:05,257 --> 00:49:07,927
- You always do. I'll
see you tomorrow.

1096
00:49:15,393 --> 00:49:17,645
(Amanda sighs)

1097
00:49:17,686 --> 00:49:19,772
- Any ideas on where
I'd get some inspiration

1098
00:49:19,814 --> 00:49:21,440
for an Easter basket?

1099
00:49:22,358 --> 00:49:23,317
- I just might.

1100
00:49:25,653 --> 00:49:27,279
(page rustles)

1101
00:49:27,321 --> 00:49:28,322
(Grace chuckles)

1102
00:49:28,364 --> 00:49:30,032
Oh, here's a good one.

1103
00:49:30,074 --> 00:49:31,367
- [Amanda] I used to love
it when Dad would push me

1104
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:32,785
around in that wheelbarrow.

1105
00:49:32,827 --> 00:49:34,787
- And you always came
in needing a bath.

1106
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:36,789
(both chuckling)

1107
00:49:36,831 --> 00:49:37,915
(page rustles)

1108
00:49:37,957 --> 00:49:39,625
(Grace chuckles)

1109
00:49:39,667 --> 00:49:41,335
You remember that Christmas?

1110
00:49:41,377 --> 00:49:44,046
- That was probably the
best Christmas ever.

1111
00:49:45,172 --> 00:49:46,465
You know, I still use
those pruning sheers?

1112
00:49:46,507 --> 00:49:47,550
- Hmm!

1113
00:49:49,635 --> 00:49:50,886
Feeling inspired?

1114
00:49:51,804 --> 00:49:53,347
- I think I've got an idea.

1115
00:49:55,015 --> 00:49:56,642
(people chattering)

1116
00:49:56,684 --> 00:49:58,102
- Oh, thanks so much for coming.

1117
00:49:58,144 --> 00:50:00,438
Don't forget your
raffle tickets.

1118
00:50:00,479 --> 00:50:01,856
(Lori chuckles)

1119
00:50:01,897 --> 00:50:04,567
So what do you have?

1120
00:50:04,608 --> 00:50:06,819
- I did a My First
Garden basket.

1121
00:50:06,861 --> 00:50:09,113
- Oh.
- I got something like this,

1122
00:50:09,155 --> 00:50:11,157
Christmases many,
many moons ago,

1123
00:50:11,198 --> 00:50:13,451
and it really meant a lot to me.

1124
00:50:13,492 --> 00:50:16,328
It gave me a sense of
independence and purpose,

1125
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:18,831
so, hopefully, it'll do
the same for someone else.

1126
00:50:18,873 --> 00:50:21,333
- You, Ladybug, have
aced the assignment.

1127
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:23,878
When you have a special
connection to your arrangements,

1128
00:50:23,919 --> 00:50:26,255
it's gonna show in
the final product.

1129
00:50:30,718 --> 00:50:33,345
Um, Grace, can I have
your help, please?

1130
00:50:33,387 --> 00:50:34,346
- Sure.

1131
00:50:36,265 --> 00:50:39,060
(Amanda sighs)

1132
00:50:41,812 --> 00:50:43,147
- Where's the mulch?

1133
00:50:43,189 --> 00:50:44,607
- Ah, didn't go
with the aesthetic.

1134
00:50:44,648 --> 00:50:45,941
- Ah.

1135
00:50:45,983 --> 00:50:47,151
- Where's yours?

1136
00:50:47,193 --> 00:50:51,572
- Uh, it's a faith-based basket,

1137
00:50:51,614 --> 00:50:53,783
complete with mustard seeds.

1138
00:50:53,824 --> 00:50:54,867
- Very own brand.

1139
00:50:54,909 --> 00:50:56,577
- [Derrick] Mm-hmm.

1140
00:50:56,619 --> 00:50:58,496
- But why didn't you do
something that's, you know,

1141
00:50:58,537 --> 00:51:02,291
like a rock climbing basket
with some ropes, carabiners-

1142
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:03,584
- I know, I know.

1143
00:51:03,626 --> 00:51:05,044
I can't control everything,

1144
00:51:05,086 --> 00:51:06,587
but one thing I can
control is how people

1145
00:51:06,629 --> 00:51:07,963
in the church see me.

1146
00:51:09,215 --> 00:51:11,175
- Maybe there's
something important

1147
00:51:11,217 --> 00:51:13,677
about sharing all
sides of yourself.

1148
00:51:15,096 --> 00:51:18,057
- It's a little more
complicated than that.

1149
00:51:20,267 --> 00:51:23,521
- But of course. I'm here
to meet you where you're at.

1150
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:26,190
- I'm sorry, are you
coming for my job?

1151
00:51:26,232 --> 00:51:30,528
- Mm, I'll stick to
farming, for now.

1152
00:51:30,569 --> 00:51:34,740
- All right. Well, for now,
I should go MC the event.

1153
00:51:34,782 --> 00:51:37,993
(Amanda chuckles)

1154
00:51:38,786 --> 00:51:41,414
(Amanda sighs)

1155
00:51:41,455 --> 00:51:44,291
(gentle music)

1156
00:51:46,293 --> 00:51:49,755
All right, and now for all the
green thumbs in the church,

1157
00:51:49,797 --> 00:51:55,219
we have a basket donated by
the wonderful Amanda Raymond.

1158
00:51:55,886 --> 00:51:57,263
A beautiful starter set

1159
00:51:57,304 --> 00:51:59,473
for the next great
gardener out there.

1160
00:51:59,515 --> 00:52:01,684
Would you look at
all those tickets?

1161
00:52:01,726 --> 00:52:03,227
All right.
- Please be my ticket.

1162
00:52:03,269 --> 00:52:04,645
Please be my ticket.
- See what we've got.

1163
00:52:04,687 --> 00:52:09,984
And the lucky winner is 2842.

1164
00:52:10,276 --> 00:52:11,485
2842.

1165
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:14,155
28-
- That's me.

1166
00:52:14,196 --> 00:52:17,783
- Well, there we go.
Constance Hughes.

1167
00:52:17,825 --> 00:52:19,201
Constance Hughes, everyone.

1168
00:52:19,243 --> 00:52:21,245
Thank you, Constance. You enjoy.

1169
00:52:21,287 --> 00:52:25,124
Okay, everyone, I think that
wraps up our event for today.

1170
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:28,711
Thank you all for coming out.
(audience applauding)

1171
00:52:28,753 --> 00:52:31,505
(gentle music)

1172
00:52:32,631 --> 00:52:33,674
Hey.

1173
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,218
Look over there.

1174
00:52:37,344 --> 00:52:38,971
- [Constance] This is for you.

1175
00:52:39,013 --> 00:52:40,806
- Really?
- Yeah, I think it's...

1176
00:52:40,848 --> 00:52:42,058
Oh.

1177
00:52:43,017 --> 00:52:46,020
(gentle music)

1178
00:52:47,104 --> 00:52:48,356
You're welcome.

1179
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:49,940
- Will you look a that?

1180
00:52:49,982 --> 00:52:51,192
- Uh-huh.

1181
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:56,030
That right there? That's
the power of God's love.

1182
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:00,993
- I do have to get
home and practice,

1183
00:53:01,035 --> 00:53:03,412
but, uh, I was wondering

1184
00:53:03,454 --> 00:53:06,207
if I could show you
something first?

1185
00:53:06,248 --> 00:53:08,709
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

1186
00:53:10,586 --> 00:53:13,381
(gentle music)

1187
00:53:19,053 --> 00:53:21,639
- And voila.

1188
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,265
- Wow.

1189
00:53:23,307 --> 00:53:25,559
(Amanda chuckles)
You've got good secrets.

1190
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:28,479
(both sighing)

1191
00:53:28,521 --> 00:53:30,439
Look at those stars.

1192
00:53:31,065 --> 00:53:32,400
God's freckles.

1193
00:53:33,192 --> 00:53:35,069
That's what my mom used to say.

1194
00:53:36,946 --> 00:53:38,572
- Can I ask you something?

1195
00:53:39,448 --> 00:53:41,325
- Sure. Anything.

1196
00:53:41,367 --> 00:53:46,414
- I haven't been to church in
a year, and you're a pastor,

1197
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:50,459
what do you see in me?

1198
00:53:51,794 --> 00:53:54,046
- So much. (chuckles)

1199
00:53:54,088 --> 00:53:55,589
I don't look at someone

1200
00:53:55,631 --> 00:53:58,426
and wonder how often
they're going to church

1201
00:53:58,467 --> 00:54:00,928
or if they're praying every day.

1202
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:03,347
The size of someone's
faith, well,

1203
00:54:03,389 --> 00:54:05,433
that can change as life changes.

1204
00:54:05,474 --> 00:54:10,438
But the size of someone's
heart, that's what I see.

1205
00:54:11,605 --> 00:54:12,815
I see that in you.

1206
00:54:15,776 --> 00:54:21,157
The way you love your family,
your farm, those flowers.

1207
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,371
- And I might be
losing all that soon.

1208
00:54:29,373 --> 00:54:32,126
- I know the stress of
all this must be a lot,

1209
00:54:33,044 --> 00:54:34,253
but have faith.

1210
00:54:36,714 --> 00:54:38,132
I see that in you too.

1211
00:54:38,924 --> 00:54:40,134
- You do?

1212
00:54:40,926 --> 00:54:42,136
- I do.

1213
00:54:43,971 --> 00:54:45,306
I'm praying for you.

1214
00:54:46,265 --> 00:54:48,142
Be patient with yourself.

1215
00:54:48,976 --> 00:54:51,645
That's my sermon for tomorrow.

1216
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,273
The fruit of patience.

1217
00:54:54,315 --> 00:54:55,900
- Now that's a tough one.

1218
00:54:56,859 --> 00:54:57,902
- Yeah?

1219
00:54:58,986 --> 00:55:02,281
It is, but it's worth it.

1220
00:55:04,241 --> 00:55:06,994
(gentle piano music)

1221
00:55:07,036 --> 00:55:12,500
Um, you probably have
some flowers that
need to be arranged.

1222
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:14,085
- Yes.

1223
00:55:14,126 --> 00:55:15,086
- We should probably get going.

1224
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:17,880
- Yeah.
- Uh, thank you

1225
00:55:19,632 --> 00:55:21,258
for bringing me here.

1226
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,219
(Derrick chuckles)
- Yeah.

1227
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,637
Okay.
- Yeah.

1228
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:27,932
Patience.

1229
00:55:35,147 --> 00:55:37,358
- [Lori] All right.
Everything's set.

1230
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,693
Yep.

1231
00:55:38,734 --> 00:55:39,944
Ah, Amanda!

1232
00:55:39,985 --> 00:55:41,612
- Hi, Lori.
(Lori laughs)

1233
00:55:41,654 --> 00:55:44,198
I remember doing these
egg races back in the day.

1234
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,159
- This is your fourth
principle: balance.

1235
00:55:47,201 --> 00:55:48,494
- Oh.
- Mm.

1236
00:55:49,704 --> 00:55:51,080
- All right, kids...

1237
00:55:51,122 --> 00:55:53,833
Oh, and Amanda. Welcome.

1238
00:55:55,126 --> 00:55:57,461
The first race is a
practice race, okay?

1239
00:55:57,503 --> 00:55:59,463
Time to perfect your strategy.

1240
00:55:59,505 --> 00:56:01,132
If you drop your egg, don't
worry, it's a hard-boiled egg.

1241
00:56:01,173 --> 00:56:03,050
Just pick it back
up and keep going.

1242
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:04,719
All right, come to
the starting line.

1243
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,346
On your marks.

1244
00:56:07,388 --> 00:56:08,514
Get set.

1245
00:56:09,682 --> 00:56:10,641
Go!
(whistle shrills)

1246
00:56:10,683 --> 00:56:11,559
Go, go, go, go!

1247
00:56:12,393 --> 00:56:14,520
Careful, careful. You got it.

1248
00:56:14,562 --> 00:56:15,813
Go, go, go.

1249
00:56:15,855 --> 00:56:16,689
(egg bouncing)
- Oh!

1250
00:56:16,731 --> 00:56:18,274
- Oh, no!

1251
00:56:18,315 --> 00:56:19,734
That's it. That's it, Timmy!

1252
00:56:19,775 --> 00:56:21,152
Go, go, go! Yes!

1253
00:56:21,193 --> 00:56:23,320
Oh.
- Oh.

1254
00:56:23,362 --> 00:56:26,032
- Great effort.
Great practice round.

1255
00:56:26,073 --> 00:56:28,284
Okay, the real race
starts in a few minutes.

1256
00:56:28,325 --> 00:56:29,994
Do your stretches.
- How did I used to be

1257
00:56:30,036 --> 00:56:31,662
so good at this as a kid?

1258
00:56:31,704 --> 00:56:34,331
- Think of it like this,
look at your floral design,

1259
00:56:34,373 --> 00:56:37,168
and you have an imaginary axis
going right the middle of it

1260
00:56:37,209 --> 00:56:39,253
and you can distribute
flowers on both sides.

1261
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:42,339
Well, think of it the
same way with the race.

1262
00:56:42,381 --> 00:56:46,177
Center the egg on the
spoon on that same axis.

1263
00:56:46,218 --> 00:56:47,428
- Center on the axis

1264
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:50,181
to create some balance.
- Yes.

1265
00:56:50,222 --> 00:56:52,892
- So, feeling confident?

1266
00:56:52,933 --> 00:56:56,353
- Uh, about as confident as
I can be after one attempt.

1267
00:56:56,395 --> 00:56:58,689
- Well, good 'cause
I'm racing too.

1268
00:56:58,731 --> 00:56:59,732
- Oh.

1269
00:57:01,442 --> 00:57:03,527
- Care to make a friendly wager?

1270
00:57:03,569 --> 00:57:04,820
- I'm listening.

1271
00:57:04,862 --> 00:57:08,199
- Well, if you win,
I'll make you lunch.

1272
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,744
If I win, you have to
listen to my Sunday sermon.

1273
00:57:14,372 --> 00:57:16,374
- You know what,
fine, you're on.

1274
00:57:16,415 --> 00:57:18,959
- All right. Line up
on the starting line.

1275
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:21,462
First one to the finish wins.

1276
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,506
And get ready 'cause
this one's gonna be

1277
00:57:23,547 --> 00:57:25,299
a lot faster than the last one.

1278
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:26,550
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

1279
00:57:26,592 --> 00:57:28,636
(Amanda sighs)
On your mark.

1280
00:57:28,677 --> 00:57:30,638
Get set.

1281
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:32,098
Go.

1282
00:57:32,139 --> 00:57:34,100
(crowd cheering)
Oh gosh. Don't drop it.

1283
00:57:34,141 --> 00:57:35,559
Oh gosh.
- You cheat.

1284
00:57:35,601 --> 00:57:36,977
- I'm not a cheat.
- Okay, wait, wait.

1285
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:38,854
- I'm a pastor. I'd never cheat.

1286
00:57:38,896 --> 00:57:39,772
Oh, no!
(egg thuds)

1287
00:57:39,814 --> 00:57:41,607
- [Amanda] Oh, no!

1288
00:57:41,649 --> 00:57:42,983
- No, no!

1289
00:57:43,025 --> 00:57:45,528
Oh, good job, guys.
You did great.

1290
00:57:46,237 --> 00:57:47,905
(Amanda laughs)

1291
00:57:47,947 --> 00:57:49,657
Good work! Wow!

1292
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:50,783
You really got me.

1293
00:57:51,617 --> 00:57:53,119
(both laughing)

1294
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,120
- I don't think I've
ever seen somebody look

1295
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:55,746
so happy to lose a bet.

1296
00:57:55,788 --> 00:57:58,916
- Well, losing means I
get to take you to lunch.

1297
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:01,127
(Amanda chuckles)

1298
00:58:01,168 --> 00:58:04,088
- Well, Ladybug, those
are the four principles

1299
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,506
that I can teach you.

1300
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:08,342
Harmony, contrast,
purpose, and balance.

1301
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:09,885
- But there's still one left.

1302
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:12,722
Master four and earn the fifth.

1303
00:58:12,763 --> 00:58:14,765
(hand patting)
- That one's in here, my dear.

1304
00:58:14,807 --> 00:58:16,267
You have to discover it.

1305
00:58:16,308 --> 00:58:18,436
And in the meantime, you
need to do the three Ps

1306
00:58:18,477 --> 00:58:20,855
of an expert floral arranger.

1307
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:23,441
- The three Ps?
- Mm-hmm.

1308
00:58:23,482 --> 00:58:25,985
Practice, practice, practice.

1309
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,238
(Amanda sighs)

1310
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,657
(gentle music)

1311
00:58:31,699 --> 00:58:33,951
(door clacks)
- All right.

1312
00:58:33,993 --> 00:58:36,954
Almost there.
(door thuds)

1313
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,710
(Amanda sighs)

1314
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:43,794
- It's incredible.

1315
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:45,713
- Come on.

1316
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,716
(Amanda chuckles)

1317
00:58:51,886 --> 00:58:55,931
So, this is what I
wanted to show you.

1318
00:58:57,558 --> 00:58:59,310
- [Amanda] They're snowdrops.

1319
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:00,519
- [Derrick] I had no idea
what they were called.

1320
00:59:00,561 --> 00:59:03,522
I just thought they were pretty.

1321
00:59:04,273 --> 00:59:06,025
- They're perfect.

1322
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:11,322
Snowdrops can grow in adverse
conditions like frost,

1323
00:59:11,364 --> 00:59:13,157
but they also tend to be

1324
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:15,826
the first flowers
to bloom in spring.

1325
00:59:15,868 --> 00:59:19,955
- Mm. They, uh, kinda
remind me of you.

1326
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:24,960
- Thank you for taking me here.

1327
00:59:25,002 --> 00:59:28,047
- Oh, we're not done yet. Nope.

1328
00:59:28,089 --> 00:59:30,758
We are just getting started.

1329
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:38,641
- So, the other
day at the raffle,

1330
00:59:38,682 --> 00:59:43,437
you were talking about
how it was complicated,

1331
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:46,649
your image and how
the church saw you?

1332
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,193
What did you mean by that?

1333
00:59:49,235 --> 00:59:53,906
- Yeah, um, when I told you
about my accident the other day,

1334
00:59:55,032 --> 00:59:58,536
I wasn't able to tell
you the whole story.

1335
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:04,125
You see, when I fell,
I lost my footing,

1336
01:00:05,459 --> 01:00:09,672
and one of my students,
he was tethered to me.

1337
01:00:09,714 --> 01:00:11,674
He fell even further than I did,

1338
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:16,595
and, uh, he wasn't as lucky.

1339
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,266
- He didn't make it?

1340
01:00:20,307 --> 01:00:22,893
- No, he did. Thank God he did.

1341
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:29,942
Just, uh, he's in
a wheelchair now.

1342
01:00:32,653 --> 01:00:35,781
Not a day goes by that I don't
think about that poor kid.

1343
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:38,451
I blame myself.

1344
01:00:40,327 --> 01:00:42,955
I can't even bring myself
to rock climb again.

1345
01:00:44,957 --> 01:00:45,958
- I'm sorry.

1346
01:00:49,128 --> 01:00:51,630
- You know, in many ways, I
feel like moving out here was

1347
01:00:51,672 --> 01:00:56,552
just my attempt to get away
from the memory of it all.

1348
01:00:57,803 --> 01:00:59,889
I feel like such a
hypocrite sometimes.

1349
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:03,768
Now, I'm asking people to
find joy in their sorrow,

1350
01:01:03,809 --> 01:01:06,479
and here I am, I'm
running for my own.

1351
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:12,318
- We all have
chapters of our lives

1352
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,653
that we wish we could rewrite.

1353
01:01:17,198 --> 01:01:19,325
My dad would say,
"Without tests,

1354
01:01:19,367 --> 01:01:22,244
there could be no testimony."

1355
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:29,251
Being open and vulnerable
shows your humanity.

1356
01:01:31,212 --> 01:01:32,546
It gives people hope.

1357
01:01:35,216 --> 01:01:36,634
- I really like that.

1358
01:01:38,386 --> 01:01:39,595
Thank you.

1359
01:01:42,181 --> 01:01:45,434
(gentle music)

1360
01:01:45,476 --> 01:01:48,187
(door clacks)

1361
01:01:50,898 --> 01:01:52,358
(door thuds)

1362
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,194
(gentle music)

1363
01:02:01,325 --> 01:02:04,203
(flowers rustling)

1364
01:02:04,245 --> 01:02:05,830
- [Samuel] Have you decided?

1365
01:02:05,871 --> 01:02:08,290
Your great word will reach
so many young people.

1366
01:02:08,332 --> 01:02:09,834
- I know.

1367
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:13,337
I wanna help, and you
more than anyone know

1368
01:02:13,379 --> 01:02:14,672
about my adventurous side.

1369
01:02:14,714 --> 01:02:16,716
- [Samuel] What
better way, then?

1370
01:02:16,757 --> 01:02:18,968
- There's no way around
this relocation thing?

1371
01:02:19,009 --> 01:02:20,678
- Unfortunately
not, given the need

1372
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,221
to be near the mountains.

1373
01:02:23,097 --> 01:02:25,015
But think of all the upside.

1374
01:02:25,057 --> 01:02:28,227
- It's just too good
of an opportunity to
pass up, isn't it?

1375
01:02:33,399 --> 01:02:35,026
(door clacks)

1376
01:02:35,067 --> 01:02:38,529
Well, it's a pleasure,
Samuel, as always.

1377
01:02:38,571 --> 01:02:39,488
- It's good to see you.

1378
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:40,406
- Take care, friend.

1379
01:02:40,448 --> 01:02:41,532
- You too.

1380
01:02:41,574 --> 01:02:44,618
(gentle music)

1381
01:02:49,707 --> 01:02:53,335
(gentle music continues)

1382
01:02:56,922 --> 01:02:58,215
(door clacks)

1383
01:02:58,257 --> 01:02:59,967
- Amanda?

1384
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:02,178
(engine rumbling)

1385
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:03,345
Amanda.

1386
01:03:03,387 --> 01:03:06,348
(engine rumbling)

1387
01:03:15,107 --> 01:03:16,067
- So...

1388
01:03:19,737 --> 01:03:21,739
(Amanda sighs)

1389
01:03:21,781 --> 01:03:24,158
You got this. Just focus.

1390
01:03:25,409 --> 01:03:27,036
(cellphone chimes)

1391
01:03:27,078 --> 01:03:29,663
(Amanda sighs)

1392
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,916
- [Lori] Good morning, Amanda.

1393
01:03:31,957 --> 01:03:33,376
I'm afraid I had a bit of a fall

1394
01:03:33,417 --> 01:03:34,794
carrying groceries this morning.

1395
01:03:34,835 --> 01:03:36,837
At the hospital now,
getting some X-rays.

1396
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:40,383
Don't worry, I'll be
fine. Keep practicing.

1397
01:03:40,424 --> 01:03:41,759
I believe in you, Ladybug.

1398
01:03:41,801 --> 01:03:42,802
- Right.

1399
01:03:43,969 --> 01:03:46,972
Really? Is this part
of your master plan?

1400
01:03:52,269 --> 01:03:53,938
- Here's the good news,

1401
01:03:55,815 --> 01:03:58,275
you are the creator
of your own garden.

1402
01:03:59,568 --> 01:04:01,737
Yeah, there might be
a weed here or there,

1403
01:04:01,779 --> 01:04:03,614
those you just pull out.

1404
01:04:04,949 --> 01:04:06,742
They weren't supposed to be
there in the first place,

1405
01:04:08,035 --> 01:04:11,997
but with what's left, why
not water that with love?

1406
01:04:12,832 --> 01:04:14,583
Let the light shine down on that

1407
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:18,421
and it'll grow into a
life that is beautiful.

1408
01:04:18,462 --> 01:04:21,590
(birds chirping)

1409
01:04:21,632 --> 01:04:23,342
- You're right. Thanks, Dad.

1410
01:04:24,176 --> 01:04:24,927
I needed that.

1411
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:26,011
- Yeah.

1412
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:34,353
(machine beeping)

1413
01:04:34,395 --> 01:04:36,230
- Hi.
- Oh, Amanda.

1414
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:40,067
You and Derrick, you just
missed crossing paths. Oh my.

1415
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:41,235
(Lori gasps)

1416
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:43,320
You did these?

1417
01:04:43,362 --> 01:04:45,740
- Um, this morning.

1418
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:48,826
- Well, Ladybug, I
think you are ready

1419
01:04:48,868 --> 01:04:50,911
to go win a competition.

1420
01:04:51,996 --> 01:04:54,248
- Well, there's still
one missing piece,

1421
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,043
but I think I know what
that final lesson is.

1422
01:04:58,044 --> 01:04:59,045
- You do?

1423
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:01,797
- True beauty comes
from the heart,

1424
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:06,302
so the key to a winning
arrangement has to be love.

1425
01:05:09,263 --> 01:05:10,264
(Lori clapping)

1426
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,348
- Bravo.

1427
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:14,935
The final principle of love,

1428
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,646
a winning floral
arrangement is filled with

1429
01:05:17,688 --> 01:05:20,024
the love that you
put into making it.

1430
01:05:21,609 --> 01:05:23,069
(Lori sighs)

1431
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:26,822
Amanda, I very likely
won't be on my feet

1432
01:05:26,864 --> 01:05:29,533
in time for the competition,
but, I promise you,

1433
01:05:29,575 --> 01:05:31,744
I am gonna be there in spirit.

1434
01:05:31,786 --> 01:05:32,953
- Thank you.

1435
01:05:33,788 --> 01:05:35,206
That really means a lot.

1436
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:41,754
- So, uh, what's going
on with you and Derrick?

1437
01:05:44,715 --> 01:05:48,219
You know, when someone
shows you who they are,

1438
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:50,304
just believe them,

1439
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:54,308
not just the bad traits,
but the good ones too.

1440
01:05:57,269 --> 01:05:58,229
Forgive him.

1441
01:06:03,609 --> 01:06:05,236
- It sounds like
we could all use

1442
01:06:05,277 --> 01:06:08,364
a little more
harmony in our lives.

1443
01:06:09,657 --> 01:06:11,826
- Yeah, you're so right.

1444
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:16,414
Could you do me a favor?

1445
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:18,249
- Sure.

1446
01:06:19,417 --> 01:06:22,420
(door knocking)

1447
01:06:22,461 --> 01:06:24,422
(door clacks)

1448
01:06:24,463 --> 01:06:26,215
- Oh. Hello.

1449
01:06:26,257 --> 01:06:28,008
- I'm Amanda Raymond.

1450
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,885
We've never really
talked, but I work-

1451
01:06:29,927 --> 01:06:31,887
- Honey, I don't
mean to be rude,

1452
01:06:31,929 --> 01:06:34,098
but there's a very important
floral competition this weekend

1453
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,559
that I need to focus on,
so now's not a good time.

1454
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,060
- Yeah, I hear you.

1455
01:06:38,102 --> 01:06:40,229
Um, I just need five
minutes of your time.

1456
01:06:42,648 --> 01:06:43,858
- Come in.

1457
01:06:47,278 --> 01:06:48,404
(door thuds)

1458
01:06:48,446 --> 01:06:49,989
This way. Please.

1459
01:06:52,366 --> 01:06:54,452
- [Amanda] Wow, that's gorgeous.

1460
01:06:56,287 --> 01:06:57,288
- Thank you.

1461
01:06:58,664 --> 01:07:01,625
- I'm here, actually, as
a delivery person today.

1462
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:04,045
Lori Matthews wanted
me to give this to you.

1463
01:07:07,631 --> 01:07:10,551
(paper rustling)

1464
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:17,141
- Oh, Loretta, how
far apart we've grown.

1465
01:07:17,183 --> 01:07:19,143
- I don't actually
think the two of you are

1466
01:07:19,185 --> 01:07:21,854
as far apart as you each think.

1467
01:07:23,314 --> 01:07:26,108
Anyway, good luck at the
competition tomorrow,

1468
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:28,486
I mean, not that
you're gonna need it.

1469
01:07:29,904 --> 01:07:31,447
- Thank you for stopping by.

1470
01:07:31,489 --> 01:07:34,617
- You're welcome.
(door clacks)

1471
01:07:34,658 --> 01:07:37,328
(door thuds)

1472
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:43,167
Hey, God. It's me, Amanda.

1473
01:07:46,587 --> 01:07:52,009
I know we haven't talked
in a while, but I'm here.

1474
01:07:55,388 --> 01:07:56,931
We really need you.

1475
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:04,480
- Thank you.

1476
01:08:07,024 --> 01:08:09,985
- Ladybug Latte for
luck. (chuckles)

1477
01:08:10,027 --> 01:08:11,946
- You're the best.
(Effie chuckles)

1478
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:13,364
(Amanda sighs)

1479
01:08:13,406 --> 01:08:17,535
So, win the competition,
save the farm.

1480
01:08:17,576 --> 01:08:18,703
No pressure, right?

1481
01:08:18,744 --> 01:08:20,329
- Well, if it doesn't work out,

1482
01:08:20,371 --> 01:08:23,582
maybe you can come on as
a partner at the cafe?

1483
01:08:25,042 --> 01:08:25,835
But who am I kidding?
You're gonna win this thing.

1484
01:08:25,876 --> 01:08:27,086
(Effie chuckles)

1485
01:08:27,128 --> 01:08:29,004
Okay, bye. (chuckles)

1486
01:08:29,046 --> 01:08:30,131
Hi.

1487
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:32,299
- Welcome, talented florists.

1488
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:34,677
You will all have three
hours to create your designs

1489
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:37,346
with a short break
at the halfway point.

1490
01:08:37,388 --> 01:08:39,682
As instructed in
the contest details,

1491
01:08:39,724 --> 01:08:41,142
you are all allowed to bring in

1492
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:44,353
and incorporate one
item meaningful to you.

1493
01:08:44,395 --> 01:08:48,399
We look forward to seeing
your creations, and good luck.

1494
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:51,485
(group applauding)

1495
01:08:53,988 --> 01:08:55,448
(timer dings)

1496
01:08:55,489 --> 01:08:58,075
* Been looking for
what's underneath *

1497
01:08:58,117 --> 01:09:01,245
* Holding on and keeping focus

1498
01:09:01,287 --> 01:09:04,999
* Oh, we're catching the
fireflies in the bottle *

1499
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:07,626
* Don't wait until tomorrow

1500
01:09:07,668 --> 01:09:11,047
* We're living in the moment

1501
01:09:11,088 --> 01:09:15,051
* Not in control of
our final destination *

1502
01:09:15,092 --> 01:09:20,431
* We light up all
the places we go *

1503
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:25,311
* We're catching fireflies

1504
01:09:25,352 --> 01:09:27,646
* Oh

1505
01:09:27,688 --> 01:09:30,316
* Oh

1506
01:09:30,358 --> 01:09:32,318
* Oh

1507
01:09:33,778 --> 01:09:35,863
(timer dings)

1508
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:37,615
- Stop arranging.

1509
01:09:37,656 --> 01:09:40,785
We will have a five-minute
break before we continue.

1510
01:09:40,826 --> 01:09:42,078
- Ladybug.

1511
01:09:42,953 --> 01:09:43,788
(Lori laughs)
(Effie gasps)

1512
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:44,622
- [Amanda] Lori.

1513
01:09:44,663 --> 01:09:46,248
You made it.

1514
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:48,918
- I got cleared just in
time. How are you doing?

1515
01:09:48,959 --> 01:09:50,419
- Not great.

1516
01:09:50,461 --> 01:09:52,046
It's not coming together
like I want it to

1517
01:09:52,088 --> 01:09:53,881
and the clock is
ticking down and-

1518
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:55,383
- It's okay.

1519
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:58,260
Just close your
eyes, just breathe,

1520
01:09:58,302 --> 01:10:00,262
and I want you to think
about the five principles.

1521
01:10:00,304 --> 01:10:04,475
Harmony, contrast,
purpose, balance, love.

1522
01:10:04,517 --> 01:10:07,311
(gentle music)

1523
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:14,235
- Okay. I'm gonna be okay.

1524
01:10:16,487 --> 01:10:19,990
- The halfway break is over.
The competition is back on.

1525
01:10:20,032 --> 01:10:23,119
- Okay. I, um, gotta
get back to work.

1526
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,453
I will make you proud.

1527
01:10:24,495 --> 01:10:25,496
- You will.

1528
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:29,917
* Oh

1529
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:33,170
* There's hope for
a better tomorrow *

1530
01:10:33,212 --> 01:10:36,507
* There's hope for
joy over sorrow *

1531
01:10:36,549 --> 01:10:38,134
* 'Cause God's still good

1532
01:10:38,175 --> 01:10:43,264
* And He's still got
it all in control, oh *

1533
01:10:44,432 --> 01:10:46,308
* There's hope for a
world that can change *

1534
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:49,645
* There's hope for
love over hate *

1535
01:10:49,687 --> 01:10:51,188
* 'Cause God's still good

1536
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:54,608
* And He's still got
it all in control *

1537
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:56,318
* Oh

1538
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:00,948
- [Group] Five, four,
three, two, one.

1539
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:04,201
(group applauding)

1540
01:11:05,953 --> 01:11:09,206
* Oh, yeah

1541
01:11:09,248 --> 01:11:13,044
* Come on and keep on hoping
when the days get dark *

1542
01:11:13,085 --> 01:11:16,422
* Keep on singing, don't
you ever lose heart *

1543
01:11:16,464 --> 01:11:18,340
* Lift your eyes

1544
01:11:18,382 --> 01:11:23,637
- And third place goes
to Lacey Williams.

1545
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:27,099
(group applauding)

1546
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:32,188
We are down to our
top two finalists.

1547
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:34,815
The judges would like
to recognize the work

1548
01:11:36,067 --> 01:11:41,238
of Constance Hughes
and Amanda Raymond.

1549
01:11:42,073 --> 01:11:43,574
(group cheering and applauding)

1550
01:11:43,616 --> 01:11:45,701
* Lift your eyes, you're
gonna be all right *

1551
01:11:45,743 --> 01:11:48,079
- The judges have collectively
decided that this has been

1552
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:51,207
the closest margin
that we've ever seen.

1553
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:57,254
But the winner of this year's
Easter competition is...

1554
01:11:58,464 --> 01:12:01,342
* Keep on hoping

1555
01:12:07,014 --> 01:12:09,809
(gentle music)

1556
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:18,192
- The winner is
Constance Hughes-

1557
01:12:19,026 --> 01:12:22,363
(group cheering and applauding)

1558
01:12:22,405 --> 01:12:26,117
Which makes newcomer, Amanda
Raymond, our runner-up.

1559
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:27,535
(group cheering and applauding)

1560
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:29,578
Congratulations to
all our participants,

1561
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:31,372
and happy Easter weekend.

1562
01:12:31,414 --> 01:12:34,208
(gentle music)

1563
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,001
(Lori chuckles)

1564
01:12:36,043 --> 01:12:37,253
- I tried.

1565
01:12:38,254 --> 01:12:39,672
Sorry.

1566
01:12:39,714 --> 01:12:41,090
- You're apologizing?

1567
01:12:42,216 --> 01:12:44,260
Can you imagine the look
on your father's face

1568
01:12:44,301 --> 01:12:46,929
if he saw what you
accomplished today?

1569
01:12:46,971 --> 01:12:48,556
He'd be over the moon.

1570
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:50,224
- Now that's the truth.

1571
01:12:51,809 --> 01:12:54,603
Oh, he left. Big day tomorrow.

1572
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,859
- Lori, I just wanted
to say thank you

1573
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:03,237
for teaching me the
five principles.

1574
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:06,115
I realized that
they're all things

1575
01:13:06,157 --> 01:13:07,908
that I've been missing
in my own life.

1576
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:13,372
You've given me a renewed
sense of purpose on Easter.

1577
01:13:14,457 --> 01:13:16,375
- That's the most
important lesson of all.

1578
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:19,795
(gentle music)

1579
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:28,471
- Congratulations.
It's really beautiful.

1580
01:13:28,512 --> 01:13:30,139
- Thank you.

1581
01:13:30,181 --> 01:13:33,184
- We're having an Easter
brunch at the farm tomorrow.

1582
01:13:33,225 --> 01:13:35,269
Um, wanted to invite you.

1583
01:13:35,311 --> 01:13:38,647
It's sort of a final sendoff.

1584
01:13:38,689 --> 01:13:40,524
- I'm not sure that I can,

1585
01:13:40,566 --> 01:13:42,860
but I really appreciate
the invitation.

1586
01:13:42,902 --> 01:13:46,155
- It would mean so much to
me if you could make it.

1587
01:13:46,197 --> 01:13:47,406
- We'll see.

1588
01:13:50,117 --> 01:13:51,869
Thank you for the sunflower.

1589
01:13:53,204 --> 01:13:54,413
- You're welcome.

1590
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:57,792
- Happy Easter to both of you.

1591
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:59,543
- Happy Easter.
- Happy Easter.

1592
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:03,798
(gentle music)

1593
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:12,640
(gentle music continues)

1594
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:15,142
Warm weather on
an Easter Sunday.

1595
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:16,727
Doesn't get much
better than that.

1596
01:14:16,769 --> 01:14:18,145
- It's just wonderful to see

1597
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:20,106
the best version of
my daughter back.

1598
01:14:20,147 --> 01:14:22,566
Joyful and hopeful.

1599
01:14:22,608 --> 01:14:24,068
(Amanda chuckles)

1600
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:25,986
- You're my mom, you
have to say that.

1601
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:27,321
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1602
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:30,700
(people chattering)

1603
01:14:33,619 --> 01:14:36,414
(gentle music)

1604
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:45,047
Dad did so many of
these for other people,

1605
01:14:45,089 --> 01:14:47,967
and we never did one for him.

1606
01:14:48,926 --> 01:14:51,220
Thank you for organizing this.

1607
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:53,347
- Oh, it wasn't just me.

1608
01:14:54,265 --> 01:14:55,599
- It wasn't?

1609
01:14:55,641 --> 01:14:56,684
- No.

1610
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,354
Pastor Derrick called me
and asked if it was okay.

1611
01:15:05,735 --> 01:15:08,904
(gentle piano music)

1612
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,954
(Grace sighs)

1613
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:21,500
I'm gonna go get our seats.

1614
01:15:22,501 --> 01:15:23,627
- Amanda.

1615
01:15:23,669 --> 01:15:24,628
- [Amanda] Pastor.

1616
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,636
(Derrick sighs)

1617
01:15:34,847 --> 01:15:36,599
- On this Easter Sunday,

1618
01:15:37,349 --> 01:15:39,560
there is just one more fruit

1619
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:42,646
of the Holy Spirit left
to talk about, love,

1620
01:15:46,817 --> 01:15:50,237
'cause today is
about a resurrection.

1621
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:54,617
And in that
resurrection, love wins.

1622
01:15:55,618 --> 01:16:00,164
You see, God loves all of us.

1623
01:16:00,206 --> 01:16:03,542
After all, we are
made in his image.

1624
01:16:04,752 --> 01:16:07,421
(gentle music)

1625
01:16:07,463 --> 01:16:12,802
And yet, I realized
I haven't been

1626
01:16:13,761 --> 01:16:16,555
completely open
about my own journey.

1627
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:23,729
God places people in
our lives for a reason,

1628
01:16:23,771 --> 01:16:26,565
and someone very special
in my own life taught me

1629
01:16:26,607 --> 01:16:30,528
the importance of being
who God created me to be.

1630
01:16:33,698 --> 01:16:36,450
(Derrick sighs)

1631
01:16:36,492 --> 01:16:39,412
Before God's path led me here,

1632
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:44,959
I was involved in a terrible
rock climate accident.

1633
01:16:46,627 --> 01:16:49,588
It was a moment that irrevocably
changed several lives,

1634
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:52,466
mine included, and
though I was lucky enough

1635
01:16:52,508 --> 01:16:54,844
to have forgiveness
from those around me,

1636
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:59,557
I was unable to
find it in my heart

1637
01:17:01,267 --> 01:17:02,727
to forgive myself,

1638
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:08,482
but, today, in the spirit
of the resurrection,

1639
01:17:11,068 --> 01:17:15,031
I forgive myself.

1640
01:17:18,826 --> 01:17:23,372
And I'm committed to embracing
who He created me to be,

1641
01:17:23,414 --> 01:17:27,501
including my love for rock
climbing, a gift from God.

1642
01:17:28,669 --> 01:17:31,172
You see, our relationship
with God is rooted

1643
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:33,716
in love and forgiveness.

1644
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,262
And just as God forgives
us, we, too, must learn

1645
01:17:38,304 --> 01:17:43,142
to forgive each
other and ourselves.

1646
01:17:44,894 --> 01:17:50,399
After all, forgiveness is the
purest expression of love.

1647
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:55,738
So, on this Easter Sunday,

1648
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:59,575
let us walk this path
of love together!

1649
01:17:59,617 --> 01:18:02,661
Amen!
(congregation applauding)

1650
01:18:02,703 --> 01:18:06,374
- Amen.

1651
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:09,710
- Thank you.

1652
01:18:09,752 --> 01:18:10,795
Amen!

1653
01:18:17,593 --> 01:18:22,223
* Ooh

1654
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:23,724
* Ooh

1655
01:18:23,766 --> 01:18:25,309
(door knocking)

1656
01:18:25,351 --> 01:18:28,062
- I'll get it.
- Making up for a late bloom.

1657
01:18:28,104 --> 01:18:30,272
Chicken looks delicious.

1658
01:18:30,314 --> 01:18:31,857
(door clacks)

1659
01:18:31,899 --> 01:18:32,900
- Hi.
- Hey.

1660
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:34,235
(Amanda chuckles)

1661
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:35,569
Happy Easter.

1662
01:18:35,611 --> 01:18:37,738
- Happy Easter.
(Derrick chuckles)

1663
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:40,408
- Listen, I just
want to let you know

1664
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:41,951
how much it meant to me.

1665
01:18:41,992 --> 01:18:44,370
You know, seeing your face
at church this morning,

1666
01:18:44,412 --> 01:18:45,955
it really warmed my heart.

1667
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:50,960
And, uh, congratulations,
by the way, on yesterday.

1668
01:18:51,001 --> 01:18:52,753
- Thank you.

1669
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:57,591
I, um, couldn't save the
farm, but, um, I did my best.

1670
01:18:58,384 --> 01:19:00,678
- I'm proud of you.

1671
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:03,639
- And I'm proud
of you for showing

1672
01:19:03,681 --> 01:19:06,016
the church your authentic self.

1673
01:19:06,058 --> 01:19:07,101
Took a lot.

1674
01:19:10,021 --> 01:19:11,105
I'm gonna miss you.

1675
01:19:11,981 --> 01:19:13,441
- Miss me?

1676
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:15,985
- Yeah. Aren't you
taking the job?

1677
01:19:16,861 --> 01:19:17,862
- Turned it down.

1678
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:20,823
- Why?

1679
01:19:20,865 --> 01:19:22,950
- Because there's
something here,

1680
01:19:24,035 --> 01:19:26,954
something special, with you,

1681
01:19:28,748 --> 01:19:31,834
with us, and I feel
like it's just begun,

1682
01:19:32,877 --> 01:19:36,213
and I can't wait to
see where it goes.

1683
01:19:36,255 --> 01:19:39,091
Or grows or blooms or...

1684
01:19:39,133 --> 01:19:40,634
Okay, I'll stop.

1685
01:19:40,676 --> 01:19:45,681
That is, of course,
if you're open to it.

1686
01:19:47,266 --> 01:19:48,726
- Constance.

1687
01:19:48,768 --> 01:19:50,352
- Constance. (clears throat)

1688
01:19:50,394 --> 01:19:51,979
- You made it.
- I did.

1689
01:19:52,021 --> 01:19:54,774
- Come inside. I
can give you a tour.

1690
01:19:56,108 --> 01:19:58,527
(Derrick clears throat)

1691
01:19:58,569 --> 01:20:00,196
Come in.
- Thank you.

1692
01:20:03,824 --> 01:20:06,285
(door thuds)

1693
01:20:09,413 --> 01:20:12,124
- I have to do it.
- Yes.

1694
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:13,709
- Thank you, Loretta.

1695
01:20:13,751 --> 01:20:16,670
And I just have to
say, I am so sorry.

1696
01:20:17,338 --> 01:20:18,756
Please forgive me.

1697
01:20:19,924 --> 01:20:22,259
- We both played an
equal part, Constance,

1698
01:20:22,301 --> 01:20:25,763
so I ask of you the same thing.

1699
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:30,810
(group chattering)

1700
01:20:32,019 --> 01:20:33,729
(glass clinking)

1701
01:20:33,771 --> 01:20:35,272
(Constance clears throat)

1702
01:20:35,314 --> 01:20:37,191
- I have an announcement.

1703
01:20:37,233 --> 01:20:38,693
(Constance clears throat)

1704
01:20:38,734 --> 01:20:39,694
(Constance sighs)

1705
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:41,696
(Constance chuckles)

1706
01:20:41,737 --> 01:20:45,574
This is such a beautiful farm
run by a beautiful family.

1707
01:20:45,616 --> 01:20:50,246
And, Amanda, you are the
most talented young farmer,

1708
01:20:50,287 --> 01:20:54,083
well, now, farmer and
florist, that I've ever seen.

1709
01:20:55,668 --> 01:20:58,838
And I might have won first
place in the eyes of the judges,

1710
01:20:58,879 --> 01:21:01,924
but you won first
place in my eyes.

1711
01:21:05,177 --> 01:21:06,971
And I would love nothing more

1712
01:21:07,888 --> 01:21:10,224
than to pass the
prize money to you.

1713
01:21:11,142 --> 01:21:15,146
(group applauding)
- Woo.

1714
01:21:15,187 --> 01:21:16,605
- Oh my gosh.

1715
01:21:17,565 --> 01:21:19,191
- I don't know what to say.

1716
01:21:19,233 --> 01:21:21,652
- You don't have to say
anything. You deserved it.

1717
01:21:21,694 --> 01:21:23,237
(Constance chuckles)

1718
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:25,865
I just ask that you name
the sunflower section

1719
01:21:25,906 --> 01:21:28,909
on the farm after me and Lori.

1720
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:32,079
(group laughing)

1721
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:33,998
- It would be an honor.

1722
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,249
(Lori chuckles)

1723
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:36,250
Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

1724
01:21:37,209 --> 01:21:39,253
- Thank you so, so much.

1725
01:21:39,295 --> 01:21:40,254
- [Constance] Oh.

1726
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:44,759
- What incredible timing.

1727
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,596
- So this $20,000,
it would be enough

1728
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:50,806
to tide us over until
the bloom comes in,

1729
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:54,852
and I was thinking
that in order for us

1730
01:21:54,894 --> 01:21:57,021
not to be in this
position again,

1731
01:21:58,189 --> 01:22:01,150
how would you feel about
the Raymond Family Farm

1732
01:22:01,192 --> 01:22:05,404
transitioning into a
one-stop wedding venue?

1733
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:09,033
- I love that idea, Amanda.

1734
01:22:09,075 --> 01:22:12,244
I have always wanted
to bake wedding cakes.

1735
01:22:12,286 --> 01:22:13,954
(group laughing)

1736
01:22:13,996 --> 01:22:16,040
- Weddings are beautiful.
- I volunteer to officiate.

1737
01:22:16,082 --> 01:22:18,626
- Oh, and I can help
with the arrangements,

1738
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:20,920
as long as my assistant
here is available.

1739
01:22:20,961 --> 01:22:22,838
- Oh, assistant.
(group laughing)

1740
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,049
Oh, you haven't changed one bit.

1741
01:22:25,091 --> 01:22:27,468
(group chuckling)

1742
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:29,845
- Oh.
(group applauding)

1743
01:22:29,887 --> 01:22:31,263
- Okay!

1744
01:22:31,305 --> 01:22:32,807
Okay!

1745
01:22:32,848 --> 01:22:34,600
- [Derrick] All right.

1746
01:22:34,642 --> 01:22:36,310
- Well, dig in, everyone.
- All right.

1747
01:22:36,352 --> 01:22:37,978
(group chattering)

1748
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:40,940
(birds chirping)

1749
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:45,194
- Happy Easter, Dad.

1750
01:22:47,697 --> 01:22:50,700
(gentle music)

1751
01:22:53,869 --> 01:22:57,039
- Are the flowers part of
the whole wedding setup?

1752
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:01,794
- It's funny you ask
because I was thinking

1753
01:23:01,836 --> 01:23:06,048
that couples could
stand right about here

1754
01:23:07,091 --> 01:23:12,096
for their, um, first
kiss as newlyweds.

1755
01:23:12,513 --> 01:23:13,639
- Really?

1756
01:23:13,681 --> 01:23:15,599
Right here? You sure?

1757
01:23:15,641 --> 01:23:19,103
'Cause there's a lot of really
beautiful parts of the earth.

1758
01:23:19,729 --> 01:23:22,732
(gentle music)

1759
01:23:25,317 --> 01:23:27,570
(gentle music continues)

1760
01:23:27,611 --> 01:23:28,863
It's perfect.

1761
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:32,700
- Decided, then?

1762
01:23:32,742 --> 01:23:34,702
- It's decided.

1763
01:23:34,744 --> 01:23:37,788
(gentle music)

1764
01:23:39,582 --> 01:23:41,250
No, you're right. Right here.
