00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:17,601
Where am I?

4
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,274
Whoa, what?

5
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,317
What's going on?

6
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:46,088
Let's move him over. Ready?

7
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,551
Turn on the monitor. Get his vitals.
Secure vascular access!

8
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,262
Makoto! Can you hear me?

9
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,765
-Prepare to draw blood.
-Makoto!

10
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,017
Makoto!

11
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,519
His blood pressure looks low.
Get the IV ready!

12
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:02,396
-Makoto?
-Mom, please calm down.

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,814
We're checking his status.

14
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:06,442
-He's cold. Get him a blanket.
-Okay.

15
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:15,951
Congratulations,

16
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,079
you are the winner!

17
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,764
How does it feel to be back
in this world, Blank?

18
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,390
Blank?

19
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:39,892
Yup.

20
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:45,356
A soul like you who is here to train
for enlightenment is called "Blank."

21
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:46,982
Look.

22
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:53,697
Who?

23
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:56,700
Ow!

24
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,577
What's going on?

25
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,538
So Blank, starting today,

26
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,749
you will homestay
in Makoto Kobayashi's body,

27
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,252
and begin your training.

28
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,503
Hold on.

29
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,632
You're saying that "Blank" is a soul?

30
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,093
Does that mean...

31
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,428
I'm dead?

32
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:20,766
That's right.

33
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,518
You don't remember.

34
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:26,981
But you've done pretty bad things
in your previous life.

35
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,065
Bad things?

36
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,483
But,

37
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:33,654
once in a while, we have lottery
to give souls like you a second chance.

38
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:37,074
If you answer my quiz correctly,

39
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,036
you will be given the chance to be reborn!

40
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,664
So, it's quiz time.

41
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:44,582
Quiz?

42
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,587
What was Makoto Kobayashi's
cause of death?

43
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,172
Begin!

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,216
Wait, this guy's dead too?

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,761
Yeah, dead as a door-nail.
Otherwise, you couldn't enter his body.

46
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,264
How would I know?
And I don't know how I di...

47
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,808
You have 100 days to answer correctly.

48
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,060
Three strikes and you're out.

49
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,146
Oh, I almost forgot.

50
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:10,357
Nobody can know that you're Blank.

51
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,154
If someone finds out or I can't
get it in 100 days?

52
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:26,165
Are you the devil?

53
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,959
I'm flattered.

54
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,632
How do I put it...

55
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,471
I'm just a "Guardian" that guides
souls who go on homestays.

56
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:51,273
100

57
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,989
If you answer correctly,

58
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,241
this hourglass will stop.

59
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,703
Makoto?

60
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,665
-Makoto?
-Makoto?

61
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,041
Please wait outside.

62
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:09,959
Um...

63
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,835
-Ready to draw blood?
-Yes.

64
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:13,921
Yes?

65
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:14,964
Will you do it now?

66
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,882
-You hear me, right?
-Let me check.

67
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,634
-Nothing...
-Can you talk?

68
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,344
Can you recognize where you are?

69
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,479
MAKOTO KOBAYASHI

70
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:35,526
-Makoto... Kobayashi...
-I'm impressed with his vitality.

71
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:39,071
It's the first time
a patient has come back to life

72
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,198
a day after being pronounced dead.

73
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,618
I'm guessing she's the mom?

74
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,705
Doctor...

75
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,125
Will Makoto's memory come back?

76
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,085
CIVIL LAW
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

77
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,586
He has no memory from before

78
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,380
-and after he collapsed...
-And...

79
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,466
-who is...
-His test results appear normal.

80
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,384
...this guy?

81
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,511
But he may or may not have brain damage.

82
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:06,932
We know of are cases where memory comes
back in a few days...

83
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,184
Some bedside manner!

84
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,145
...amnesia remains permanently...

85
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,039
What was Makoto Kobayashi's
cause of death?

86
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,125
How should I know?

87
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,211
Well,

88
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,339
might as well start by asking his mom.

89
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,219
How did I die?

90
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,976
You had a nasty cold
that turned into pneumonia.

91
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,771
Besides, you're not dead.

92
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:02,780
What?

93
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:05,824
Again?

94
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,751
So, you've figured out the quiz already?

95
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:26,011
Did Makoto die from a cold? Pneumonia-ish?

96
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,848
Sir, you can't be serious.

97
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:36,230
I told you you're a trainee.
You think reincarnation is that easy?

98
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,816
But the mother said it was a cold...

99
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,026
Yeah, I heard her...

100
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,071
So?

101
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,576
Will you make your first guess
by telling me "he died from a cold"?

102
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:51,954
Yes?

103
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,289
No.

104
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:06,927
Makoto?

105
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,517
Hey, what do you want to eat tonight?

106
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,062
Shoot.

107
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,526
Something like beef stew?

108
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,737
Why did she react like that?

109
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,450
All right, beef stew it is.

110
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,786
Beef stew...

111
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,595
Thank you.

112
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:54,892
We're home.

113
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,185
Here.

114
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,271
Okay.

115
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,232
Here.

116
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,318
Thank you.

117
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,236
I'll get dinner ready.

118
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:07,738
Yeah.

119
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,698
Excuse me...

120
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,501
Hey, nice place.

121
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:36,350
The brother... the mom...
and he must be the dad.

122
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,851
KEIEI UNIV ENTRANCE CEREMONY

123
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:38,810
Wait...

124
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,397
Where's Dad?

125
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,360
He's on a business trip to Shanghai.

126
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,195
Business trip?

127
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,156
But he rushed to the hospital to see you.

128
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,368
He had to leave before you woke up though.

129
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,536
What kind of father figure...

130
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:05,837
Also,

131
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,883
I want you to sleep
in Mitsuru's room for a while.

132
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,385
Huh?

133
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,765
You're still not in tip-top condition,
so I don't want you to be alone.

134
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,434
Mitsuru, look after him, okay?

135
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,867
Can I help?

136
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:36,827
What?

137
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,787
Do I peel this?

138
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,542
What?

139
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,756
Just... This is the first time
we're cooking together.

140
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,841
Seriously?

141
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,593
Uh, I thought... why not, once in a while?

142
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,764
Okay, thanks.

143
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:58,682
Sure.

144
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,352
Close one!

145
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:08,900
Good.

146
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,238
Here you are.

147
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,537
The cold shoulder again.

148
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,165
Beef stew again?

149
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,624
What?

150
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,460
It's what Makoto requested.

151
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,628
I know it's your favorite.

152
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,130
Wow! That was lucky guess!

153
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,048
Yeah.

154
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,467
Okay, let's eat.

155
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,761
Thank you for the meal.

156
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,554
Thank you for the meal.

157
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,267
I wish Dad was here.

158
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,480
You're right.

159
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,607
What's with this vibe?

160
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,200
Mitsuru?

161
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,707
He's probably tired from studying.

162
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,126
Yeah.

163
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,669
Let's eat.

164
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,431
I survived Day One
without being found out.

165
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,309
You can't tap out.

166
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:29,272
You have to find out
why Makoto Kobayashi died.

167
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,192
The time limit is 100 days.

168
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:39,908
So he didn't die... from a cold...

169
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,827
Was it an accident?

170
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,703
Maybe killed?

171
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,330
No way...

172
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:48,959
But...

173
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,320
What?

174
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,672
Hey, Makoto isn't in any of these photos.

175
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,950
Seems like a normal room.

00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,707
That's where you collapsed.

180
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,503
But... if it was just a cold,
what's all this...

181
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,048
It was just a cold.

182
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,468
What's going on?

183
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,054
Go back to sleep.

184
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,139
Wait, Mitsuru!

185
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,352
Mom,

186
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,438
I'd rather sleep in this room.

187
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,358
No, you may not.

188
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,068
I just told you.

189
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,112
It's for when you feel sick again.

190
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,114
I'll feel more comfortable in my room.

191
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:26,950
Okay?

192
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,536
This family is so weird...

193
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,093
Why did you die?

194
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,891
Good morning.

195
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,228
Thanks for coming by.

196
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,730
No, I wanted to.

197
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,733
It's been a while,
so I'm happy to see you.

198
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,819
How's your grandma?

199
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,239
She's into tai chi now.

200
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,908
-Wow, sounds like she's doing well.
-Who is this?

201
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:12,829
His girlfriend?

202
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,997
Morning.

203
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:16,875
What was that?

204
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,754
You're smirking.

205
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,049
Besides getting a cold,
you must've hit your head.

206
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,928
Akira came because
she was worried about you.

207
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,555
Really?

208
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,473
Actually,

209
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:35,685
I was just worried about the prep work
for the School Foundation Day.

210
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,647
You seem fine, so I'm going.

211
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,526
Then, I'll go with you.

212
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,948
Makoto, were you really just sick?

213
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,742
Why do you say that?

214
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,162
The last time I saw you,
you were acting strange.

215
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,497
In what way?

216
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,582
Gloomy,

217
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,793
zero energy, gaze lowered...

218
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,711
Oh, that's...

219
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,381
But I guess that's the usual you, huh?

220
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,008
The "usual" me?

221
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,721
But today, you're acting way more strange.

222
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,223
Strange?

223
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,100
What's so strange about me?

224
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,894
I'm all better and full of energy.

225
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,814
Talkative. We're having
a decent conversation.

226
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,695
Because I was absent for ten days, so
I hadn't spoken to anyone but my family.

227
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:34,994
Hurry up and finish your mass game design.

228
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,622
I'm on the committee.
I'm the one who gets blamed.

229
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,999
The mass game design?

230
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,919
Don't tell me you forgot about it.

231
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,631
Sorry... I forgot.

232
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,260
Come to the multipurpose room later.

233
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,636
I will.

234
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,851
Also, Mitsuki was asking me

235
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,019
about what you were up to.

236
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,439
Mitsuki?

237
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,524
Are you happy?

238
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,570
I guess...

239
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:09,863
I may be happy.

240
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,240
Oh.

241
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,122
Tell me,

242
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:23,793
Akira, are we just friends, or...

243
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,548
We're just childhood friends!

244
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,008
Wait.

245
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:33,678
CELEBRATION - SHUYU GAKUIN HIGH SCHOOL
100TH ANNIVERSARY

246
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:41,895
SHUYU GAKUIN HIGH SCHOOL

247
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,692
Makoto... Kobayashi...

248
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,694
Found it.

249
00:17:58,495 --> 00:17:59,329
Oh, gosh...

250
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,413
Are you okay?

251
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,706
Yeah, thanks.

252
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,584
Oh my favorite pen... My textbooks, too...

253
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:09,547
Hey.

254
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:10,965
-Eh?
-What?

255
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,511
Your classroom is over there.

256
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,057
Oh, sorry.

257
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:20,934
Makoto.

258
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,770
Hang in there.

259
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,149
Huh? "Hang in there"?

260
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:36,658
Morning.

261
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,121
Oh, morning...

262
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,501
Something wrong with me?

263
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,547
Which is Makoto's desk?

264
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,882
-Hey!
-Hey!

265
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,092
Morning.

266
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,762
So sleepy.

267
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,389
Move it!

268
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:06,271
So, that's why she said "Hang in there."

269
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,402
He's here!

270
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,653
Leave it to me.

271
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:14,696
I know!

272
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,614
Don't lose, okay?

273
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,616
On your marks...

274
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:19,993
-Go get 'em!
-Get 'em!

275
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,661
-It's gonna start.
-Okay.

276
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,372
-Get set.
-Okay, I got this now.

277
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,793
Go, go! Keep going!

278
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,799
What the hell's wrong with this body?

279
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,638
-Move it, dork.
-Out of the way.

280
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,817
I have no chance with this guy's body...

281
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,172
Thank you for this meal.

282
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,634
At least, Mom is a really good cook.

283
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,929
You're so polite.

284
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,723
But you're so heartless.

285
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,061
You ignore my DMs,
you won't answer my calls...

286
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,813
I modeled for your painting
and this is what I get?

287
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,231
She modeled for him?

288
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,984
I'm... sorry?

289
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,862
You look so troubled.

290
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,365
Is this...

291
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,658
Mitsuki?

292
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,661
Are you mad?

293
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,081
I'm sorry, I was just messing with you.

294
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,084
She's really cute!

295
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,669
Have you recovered?

296
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,170
Yes.

297
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,255
Then,

298
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,174
you can help me go look for it.

299
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,468
Go look?

300
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,304
Remember my friend's present?

301
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,098
I asked you to help me choose one.

302
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,101
Makoto was going to go shopping with her?

303
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,479
Oh, that's right.

304
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,359
You know a lot about
painting and photography.

305
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,653
I know nothing about art.

306
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,699
Whenever is convenient for you.

307
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:24,784
Seriously?

308
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,037
Eh? Did I say something wrong?

309
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:29,622
No, not at all.

310
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,916
But I'm sorry.

311
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,585
I have a practice exam soon.

312
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,588
Can we reschedule it to next month?

313
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:38,798
Sure.

314
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,300
Looks like I have a chance here!

315
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,511
You're like a different person today.

316
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:45,430
Huh?

317
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,515
Maybe you...

318
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,518
still have a fever?

319
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:52,979
So close!

320
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,664
You should know the work excuse isn't
going to cut it this time.

321
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:13,332
You don't understand

322
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,961
how much we need you at home
as a father figure.

323
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:21,174
Besides since then Makoto is...

324
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,054
Oh nothing more.

325
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,014
Okay.

326
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:31,976
Understand that.

327
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:34,312
Bye now.

328
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,775
Was that Dad?

329
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,986
Yes, his return to Japan got postponed.

330
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,113
It's a shame.

331
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,573
He must be busy.

332
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,493
He's just working hard for our family.

333
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:51,204
Makoto, go tell Mitsuru.

334
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,121
Okay.

335
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,372
Let's have dinner.

336
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,373
Yup.

337
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,802
Hey, Mom says dinner's ready.

338
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,305
Don't open the door before I answer.

339
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,431
Sorry...

340
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,149
93

341
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,401
Brother is always so difficult.

342
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,237
Dad never shows up.

343
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:25,863
See you.

344
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,240
Mom is...

345
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:28,950
Kobayashi.

346
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:31,828
Kobayashi.

347
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,412
Yes?

348
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,125
Here.

349
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,709
Thank you very much.

350
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:40,461
Oh...

351
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,589
How is Mitsuru doing?

352
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:47,218
Law classes must be tough
at his university.

353
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,429
Yes.

354
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,766
So, have you talked to your parents?

355
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,434
What?

356
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,397
I always thought

357
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:02,024
you'd go to the same university
as Mitsuru.

358
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,069
Your parents must have been shocked.

359
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,074
And what did I decide on?

360
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:18,332
Your parents value education,
so you need courage to tell them.

361
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,042
But it's about your future.

362
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:27,466
If you're serious about art school,
you have to talk to them.

363
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,471
Art school?

364
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,229
We have less than 100 days
until the event.

365
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:43,024
Some students have been
working on it since January.

366
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,108
Here.

367
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,318
This?

368
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:46,569
Hey...

369
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,571
I can't do this.

370
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,574
What? I asked you to help
because I know you can do it.

371
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,743
Yeah, but...

372
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,120
-Akira.
-Coming.

373
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,789
-I'm looking forward to a masterpiece.
-What?

374
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,958
A masterpiece...

375
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,501
93 DAYS TO 100TH ANNIVERSARY

376
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,837
NINETY THREE

377
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,505
Makoto...

378
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,383
Why did you take this...

379
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,344
So annoying...

380
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:14,513
Mitsuki!

381
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:17,934
Sorry.

382
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:18,851
Ready?

383
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,102
Say cheese!

384
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,521
-One more!
-Okay.

385
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:40,498
Found it!

386
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,044
ENTER PASSWORD

387
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:53,886
STUDENT ID

388
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,430
MAKOTO KOBAYASHI
DOB SEP 8, 2004

389
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,015
Let's give it a try.

390
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:01,102
2004...

391
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,396
September... 8th...

392
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,943
Ever heard of security?

393
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:13,656
PEACE

394
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:16,242
RIKO'S NEW WORK!

395
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:20,830
ALL OF US OUT AGAIN!

396
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:21,914
MITSUKI

397
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,594
Hello?

398
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,222
Look outside. Iridescent clouds!

399
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,558
Iridescent clouds?

400
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,818
Wow...

401
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,240
We'll be filled with happiness, right?

402
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,451
Huh?

403
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:03,122
You told me, iridescent clouds are
a sign that happiness will come.

404
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:08,627
But the one we saw from the rooftop
together was too small,

405
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,047
so it had no effect.

406
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,760
But this one... I know it will be amazing.

407
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,471
Right.

408
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,268
Okay, bye.

409
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,729
Wait, Mitsuki!

410
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:32,485
Where is the painting that I did of you?

411
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,030
I don't know.

412
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,366
Maybe you took it to the Art Room.

413
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,661
MAKOTO KOBAYASHI

414
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:48,959
Wow!

415
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,004
Makoto, you're pretty good!

416
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,842
Hey, Kobayashi?

417
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,970
Yes, it's Kobayashi.

418
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,517
How's the mass game design going?

419
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:05,893
Any progress?

420
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,687
Yes, thank you.

421
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,691
What? You're here to gather materials?

422
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,194
Yes, something like that.

423
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,656
What?

424
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,997
Kobayashi, draw something for me.

425
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,542
I love your paintings.

426
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,669
-But I can't...
-What?

427
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,546
You can't do me a favor?

428
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:37,883
You have...

429
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,177
five minutes.

430
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,720
-Five minutes?
-Ready.

431
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:43,806
Start.

432
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,020
What's wrong?

433
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:52,273
You don't want to be released?

434
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,733
Teacher, you're getting too close...

435
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:59,905
What's going on? This is just impossible.

436
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,622
What? Huh?

437
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:10,708
Wait.

438
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:15,087
Five,

439
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,089
four,

440
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,591
three,

441
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,427
two,

442
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,804
one,

443
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,265
time up.

444
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,396
I did it...

445
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,649
Wow!

446
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,109
See? You can do it.

447
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:40,070
Makoto's drawing skill is mine now?

448
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:42,948
But I prefer something more colorful.

449
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,205
Is it...

450
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,213
Oh, it's coming...

451
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,798
Will you knock it off?

452
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:01,258
Huh?

453
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,556
You're so funny. I couldn't help it.

454
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,933
Don't do that.

455
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:12,645
So tell me.
Do you have the answer to my quiz?

456
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:17,066
I know it wasn't because of a cold.

457
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,526
What?

458
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,236
That's it?

459
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,446
-Yes.
-You're kidding.

460
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,074
-What?
-Come on.

461
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,827
I'll give you one clue, Blank.

462
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,666
What color is this?

463
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:37,294
Purple.

464
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,296
Are you sure?

465
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,555
This is the clue.

466
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:49,932
Huh?

467
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:51,684
What do you mean?

468
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,227
Never mind.

469
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,313
Anyways, start by learning about Makoto.

470
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,857
Okay...

471
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,693
Hey, wait...

472
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:06,532
Kobayashi?

473
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:07,866
What? What's wrong?

474
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,536
Sorry, it's nothing.

475
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,207
-Clean this up before you leave, okay?
-Yes!

476
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:33,058
100TH ANNIVERSARY MASS GAME DESIGN

477
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,228
Start by learning about Makoto.

478
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:40,024
Easier said than done.

479
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,653
NEW MESSAGE FROM MITSUKI

480
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:45,613
Yeah!

481
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,948
WHEN ARE YOU FREE TO LOOK FOR THE PRESENT?

482
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:51,327
First phase of my mission is
to get to know Makoto.

483
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,244
WHERE WE GOING?

484
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,872
Let's ask Mitsuki all about Makoto!

485
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,582
I'LL FIND A SPOT!

486
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:02,755
I'M COUNTING ON YOU!

487
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,132
A date with Mitsuki!

488
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:12,765
Makoto! That looks too lame, dude.

489
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,355
Makoto's stuff is my stuff, yeah?

490
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,817
Wait, is that me?

491
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,445
Yes.

492
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,322
I'm still working on it.

493
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,908
I'm flattered.

494
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:14,743
Thanks.

495
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,620
You like it?

496
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:17,538
Yeah.

497
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,416
But...

498
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,419
I'm not that pretty.

499
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:33,220
You got a haircut.

500
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,931
Yeah.

501
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:41,812
You look good.

502
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,439
Oh, thanks.

503
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,819

There's a play too.

67 DAYS TO 100TH ANNIVERSARY

508
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:10,674
Is this okay?

509
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,926
A little higher.

510
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,470
-More up?
-Right there.

511
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:15,429
Okay.

512
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:18,515
Hey.

513
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:21,477
Are you going on a date?

514
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:22,686
What?

515
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:26,023
With Mitsuki?

516
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:27,941
Oh...

517
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,027
Just going shopping with her.

518
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:32,154
How did you know?

519
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,366
You were searching online
while pretending to draw.

520
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,328
You knew?

521
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,497
It was so obvious.

522
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:44,833
Akira?

523
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:48,754
Makoto!

524
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,131
Sorry. Didn't see ya.

525
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,258
Don't act like it was our fault!

526
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,968
Shut up, ugly.

527
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,470
Ugly...

528
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:57,596
So annoying...

529
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,641
Hey! You should apologize to Akira.

530
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,644
Guys, did you just hear something?

531
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:04,686
Nope.

532
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,938
Apologize to her!

533
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:06,855
Makoto...

534
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,316
Okay, then. We apologize.

535
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,359
Nice.

536
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,152
That's enough!

537
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,195
Are you mad?

538
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,404
Leave her alone!

539
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:16,657
Sorry.

540
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,991
I couldn't see you.

541
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,952
-You're so bony.
-Let's go.

542
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:22,079
-Oh, I'm so hungry.
-Me too.

543
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:32,965
Are you mad at me?

544
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:34,842
No, I'm not.

545
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,134
Yes, you are.

546
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:38,887
I'm not mad.

547
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,431
I'm just...

548
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:43,934
wondering why you did that.

549
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,937
What do you mean "why"?

550
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,023
I get it that you were pissed,

551
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:51,817
but why did you talk back?

552
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,029
It's not funny.

553
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,364
Just...

554
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,659
It's kind of funny because
most girls would get mad

555
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,912
if I didn't talk back.

556
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,666
Even if you talk back,

557
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,960
you end up getting beat up.

558
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,297
Okay.

559
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,852
I was scared.

560
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:31,899
Makoto,

561
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,819
you didn't seem like the Makoto I know.

562
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:42,159
And your hair and attitude
are all different.

563
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,500
And...

564
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:53,337
You don't...

565
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,505
look away now.

566
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:11,563
But...

567
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:13,857
Thanks.

568
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,526
Yeah.

569
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:24,910
But...

570
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,079
You have to finish the design.

571
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,289
Sure.

572
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,917
67 DAYS TO 100TH ANNIVERSARY

573
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,086
51 DAYS TO 100TH ANNIVERSARY

574
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,130
Akira is kind.

575
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,549
And I can draw like a painter.

576
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,594
And Mitsuki's fabulous.

577
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,390
Your life is not so bad, Makoto!

578
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:07,369
HEY, HEY!

579
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,580
Mitsuki.

580
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:11,999
Makoto.

581
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:14,918
-I'm sorry to make you wait.
-No, it's fine.

582
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:19,006
Hey, you look different
out of school uniform.

583
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:23,218
Do I... look weird?

584
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,305
It looks good on you.

585
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,057
Let's go.

586
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,146
Wow! This place is awesome.

587
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,607
-You looked it up just for me?
-Huh?

588
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:40,360
I happened to see it on TV.

589
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,320
"Happened to"?

590
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:45,198
I... happened... to...

591
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:46,783
Okay.

592
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,202
But I'm still flattered.

593
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:08,764
Why do you even pay attention to me?

594
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:10,766
Because you're cool, Makoto.

595
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,559
Cool?

596
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,311
Me?

597
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,939
The first time I saw you on the rooftop,

598
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:21,109
you were sitting alone quietly and drawing

599
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:23,403
not caring what anybody else thought.

600
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,490
That only means...

601
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,242
I'm a loner without friends.

602
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:34,498
It means you have your own world
that nobody can invade.

603
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,919
That's why I thought you were strong.

604
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,633
But through my eyes,

605
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,095
you're the stronger one, Mitsuki.

606
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,599
You think so? Thanks...

607
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,113
ART AQUARIUM

608
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,373
-Welcome.
-For two, please.

609
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,749
One moment, please.

610
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,137
Do you want a bite?

611
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,055
Uh, no...

612
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,350
Um...

613
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:36,852
Yeah?

614
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,229
About the present...

615
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:40,147
Yeah.

616
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,606
That's...

617
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:45,277
for your "friend..."

618
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:48,738
Do you mean...

619
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,700
It's for her.

620
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:54,244
Riko, my classmate.

621
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:58,331
Oh, for a girl friend.

622
00:40:58,415 --> 00:40:59,249
Yeah.

623
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,336
You're such a good friend.

624
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:07,883
Yeah, she's my best friend.

625
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:17,893
Excuse me.

626
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:21,479
This is on the house.

627
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:24,232
What? On the house?

628
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,986
Your mother is such a great help here.

629
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:29,654
What?

630
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:32,782
Your mother?

631
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,413
Why didn't you tell me?

632
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,210
So embarrassing?

633
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:47,005
Thanks for the dessert.

634
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,924
We should do this together!

635
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,927
Besides, I was able to buy
a beautiful present.

636
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,970
Thanks to you, Makoto.

637
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:55,263
No problem.

638
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:58,308
I hope your friend Riko likes it.

639
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,730
My house is that way.

640
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,982
Say hi to your mom for me.

641
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:06,900
I will.

642
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:08,652
Bye.

643
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,153
-Bye.
-Let's weave a peaceful

644
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,821
and beautiful country!

645
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:13,907
Let's weave it, let's weave it.

646
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:17,244
To do that, time is very limited.

647
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,622
That's right. My time to get a
girlfriend is close!

648
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:21,998
Hey, Blank!

649
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:30,257
And isn't that the same for you, too?

650
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:38,723
WE ONLY LIVE ONCE

651
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:42,310
I understand that Mitsuki is pretty.

652
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:43,853
I do understand that,

653
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,399
Her beauty is like no other,

654
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:51,278
the transience veiled by her sexiness,

655
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:53,863
her friendliness that goes against that.

656
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:57,784
There's not one aspect about her
that is unattractive.

657
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,620
-Right?
-I totally agree, Guardian.

658
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:01,538
However!

659
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:02,580
Huh?

660
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:06,668
It is preposterous if you have forgotten
your main mission!

661
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:14,592
You seem to be enjoying
your time living someone else's life,

662
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,971
but at this very moment,

663
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:21,641
the sand in the hourglass
continues to flow,

664
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,436
grain after grain, even as we speak.

665
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:31,359
Thank you.

666
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,738
Thank you for your support.

667
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,531
Thank you very much.

668
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,879
OSAMU KOBAYASHI
I'LL BE HOME NEXT WEEK

669
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:56,092
Bye!

670
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:57,260
See you tomorrow.

671
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,854
Thank you for your kind gesture earlier.

672
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,481
Oh, that's nothing...

673
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:15,820
I know exactly
how a man feels when he's in love.

674
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,344
Whoops!

675
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:40,929
Are you alright?

676
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,473
I'm fine, don't worry.

677
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,185
Morning.

678
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:49,813
Morning.

679
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:50,939
Thank you.

680
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:54,442
Your father is coming home next week.

681
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:57,404
So, let's all eat dinner together.

682
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,447
What shall I make?

683
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,492
Mitsuru, something you like this time?

684
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,286
Why together?

685
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,080
What do you mean?

686
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:14,838
I want to eat together.

687
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:16,923
We're family, right?

688
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,427
And pretend that we're happy?

689
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:29,644
37

690
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:36,943
So...

691
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:39,487
How was it?

692
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:40,738
Huh?

693
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:44,617
You two went on a date, right?

694
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:46,035
Oh...

695
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:47,412
Yeah.

696
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:48,705
It was fun.

697
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:50,790
Are you two dating?

698
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:52,792
No,

699
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:54,711
we're not there yet.

700
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:57,797
Yet?

701
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,591
So it might happen?

702
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:01,634
Who knows?

703
00:46:09,476 --> 00:46:10,435
So,

704
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:12,353
about the Fireworks Show.

705
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,272
How does 5 p.m. sound?

706
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,608
Huh?

707
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:19,736
We've promised each other
to go together every year.

708
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:20,653
You forgot?

709
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:23,281
Of course not.

710
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:31,080
Makoto,

711
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:34,501
whatever you do,

712
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,630
please don't catch a cold that day.

713
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:04,447
I'm home.

714
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:21,714
Dad?

715
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:27,637
You're home.

716
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,847
Yeah, hey.

717
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:31,766
How are you feeling?

718
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:33,268
I feel fine.

719
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,939
I'm sorry... I couldn't be there for you.

720
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,233
It's okay, you had work to do.

721
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:01,629
So, you love to paint that much?

722
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,467
I probably...

723
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,720
like it.

724
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:15,643
I still don't think...

725
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:21,441
what I did was wrong
for the sake of your future.

726
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:26,404
What do you mean?

727
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,286
Dad,

728
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:35,538
did you do something to me?

729
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,750
You really lost your memory, huh?

730
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,973
What the hell was that?

731
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:00,521
What if his memory comes back...

732
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,815
You don't have to worry about anything.

733
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:28,716
Where's Mitsuru?

734
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:30,635
He already left.

735
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:32,720
He has a bar exam lecture class.

736
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:35,890
I see. He's studying hard
even on weekends, huh?

737
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:38,685
He's serious-minded just like you.

738
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,979
I hear he can probably pass the exam
on his first try.

739
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,315
We don't have to worry
about Mitsuru, then.

740
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:45,733
I don't know about that.

741
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:50,947
You know very well things don't always go
the way parents want them to, right?

742
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,701
What's that supposed to mean?

743
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,622
Do you hate Makoto's paintings?

744
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,129
I'm just worried about him.

745
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:08,423
I asked if you like them or not.

746
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,970
You regret breaking his paintbrushes,
don't you?

747
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:21,602
Makoto and Mitsuru are different.
Just take a closer look at him.

748
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:23,604
That's your job.

749
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,732
You're just running away from it.

750
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,945
And what about you?

751
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,114
Huh?

752
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,285
You think I don't know anything?

753
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:41,706
I'll be back in two weeks.

754
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,624
Look after those two for me.

755
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,473
You really lost your memory, huh?

756
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:02,393
You had a nasty cold
that turned into pneumonia.

757
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:05,897
Don't open the door before I answer.

758
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:13,571
Makoto,

759
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,032
I'm going to work, okay?

760
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:18,367
Okay. See you.

761
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,912
Oh, this is for you, from the library.

762
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,999
When you borrow something
you have to return it.

763
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:26,626
Yeah.

764
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:34,342
Makoto,

765
00:51:36,052 --> 00:51:36,969
I...

766
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:39,555
I love your paintings.

767
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:43,434
Thanks.

768
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:45,937
Bye.

769
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:51,878
Why?

770
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,891
MAKOTO KOBAYASHI

771
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:07,286
Today, I decided to die.

772
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:13,292
How many people in this world are
happy with my existence?

773
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:16,545
What are you doing in my room?

774
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:17,672
Give me that!

775
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:19,715
That's my sketchbook.

776
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,217
Why are you hiding it?

777
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,887
You can't let Mom and Dad see this!

778
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,057
You're better off forgetting everything!

779
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:35,856
You... What did you do to Makoto?

780
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:37,316
What?

781
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:40,987
There must be something in there
you don't want people to see!

782
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,793
Hey! What the hell!

783
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:02,258
Hey!

784
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,135
No! Don't!

785
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:23,612
Looking for something?

786
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:28,784
Did you see a sketchbook falling down?

787
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:31,120
Oh, that thing.

788
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:38,502
Seriously?

789
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,343
Blank, do you have the answer to my quiz?

790
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:50,931
Makoto committed suicide.

791
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:52,933
Listen.

792
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:55,227
That's merely "how he died."

793
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,521
You have to tell me what the cause was.

794
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,815
The cause was his brother.

795
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:02,151
Mitsuru drove Makoto to suicide.

796
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:05,362
Nice try.

797
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:06,989
Close, but no cigar.

798
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:09,784
Strike one.

799
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,369
So, two more chances left.

800
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:24,715
Aoi!

801
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,926
Coming!

802
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:58,916
Today, I decided to die.
How many people in this world...

803
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:53,387
What do you want?

804
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:55,139
Huh?

805
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:56,974
But...

806
00:57:58,225 --> 00:57:59,935
It's already 5:00 p.m.

807
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:01,353
So?

808
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,315
The Fireworks Festival...

809
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,359
Sorry, I'll have to pass.

810
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:10,946
Hey. Wait.

811
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:16,202
Hey,

812
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:19,705
Makoto...

813
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:23,250
What happened?

814
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:26,212
Nothing.

815
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,923
It's none of your business, Akira.

816
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:37,640
Is it about school?

817
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,767
Home?

818
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:42,811
Or...

819
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:43,938
Is it Mitsuki?

820
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:45,481
What if it was?

821
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:49,944
I just want you to tell me

822
00:58:50,236 --> 00:58:52,029
if something's bothering you.

823
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:55,324
What's up with your hair and clothes?

824
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,118
This is...

825
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,037
To go to the festival with me?

826
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:01,664
So you got all dressed up?

827
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:06,710
What if I said "Yes"?

828
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:10,965
You love Makoto, don't you?

829
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,639
Makoto wasn't in the hospital
because of a cold.

830
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:21,058
He committed suicide!

831
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:23,644
What?

832
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:28,190
He got sick of living a crappy life
surrounded with rotten people,

833
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:29,775
and popped a bunch of pills.

834
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,111
His will...

835
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,990
didn't mention you at all.

836
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:41,954
I get it.

837
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,164
You're the same as Makoto.

838
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:46,625
Nobody notices you.

839
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,128
You poor thing.

840
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:19,616
"Today,

841
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:22,578
"I decided to die.

842
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,708
"How many people

843
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:31,545
"in this world are happy
with my existence?"

844
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,844
I hate myself, too.

845
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:42,473
If I was near me,

846
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:45,809
I wouldn't want myself to come into sight

847
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,354
because my darkness might be contagious.

848
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:55,235
I feel sorry for Mitsuru
for being connected to me

849
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:58,030
by blood.

850
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:04,453
I love...

851
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:06,580
to paint.

852
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,085
Only when I paint,

853
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:14,380
can I be myself.

854
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:17,257
Beyond the canvas...

855
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:20,719
is a world, that exists just for me.

856
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,139
But Dad...

857
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,227
couldn't allow me to live in that world.

858
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,604
-Osamu!
-That's why, that moment...

859
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,231
COLLEGE APPLICATION

860
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:35,359
...I truly became a person
that has nothing else left.

861
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:39,071
An empty shell.

862
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,534
But I still had...

863
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:45,411
the rooftop.

864
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:48,163
Whenever I went there,

865
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:52,042
Mitsuki would always be there.

866
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:19,862
Mitsuki is the only person...

867
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,407
that knew I existed.

868
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:28,203
Mitsuki!

869
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:32,040
You were modeling for a picture?

870
01:02:32,124 --> 01:02:33,333
We didn't know that.

871
01:02:33,459 --> 01:02:34,293
MAKOTO KOBAYASHI

872
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,336
Who's Makoto Kobayashi?

873
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,629
A freshman?

874
01:02:38,297 --> 01:02:39,173
You know him?

875
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,009
No, never heard of him.

876
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:02,196
Fifty... two points!

877
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:07,659
This for the mass game? Such a turnoff.

878
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,954
It's a "my dearest goddess" kind of thing?

879
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,207
Talk about delusional.

880
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,751
It's so serious, it's lame.

881
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:20,631
-Doesn't this look like you, Mitsuki?
-Huh?

882
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,301
No... Cut it out, that's creepy.

883
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,595
But look at her face!

884
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,597
This doesn't look like me at all.

885
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:29,932
-You think?
-Yeah.

886
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,183
What did you just say?

887
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:35,395
-You should've told me you didn't like it.
-That's not it...

888
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:36,563
What's "not it"?

889
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:40,067
You called me "cool"
and said you counted on me.

890
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:42,736
Were you just lying and making fun of me?

891
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,489
-I really meant it.
-Then that makes it even worse.

892
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,574
Makoto...

893
01:04:07,678 --> 01:04:09,221
Mitsuki is the only person...

894
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,139
100TH ANNIVERSARY MASS GAME DESIGN

895
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:12,724
...that knew I existed.

896
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:24,236
But that too was...

897
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:27,114
just an illusion.

898
01:04:33,412 --> 01:04:36,206
Mitsuki, are you dating him?

899
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:37,457
What?

900
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,127
You should go after him.

901
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,504
We can talk later. Okay?

902
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:43,839
Bye.

903
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:45,549
We're not dating.

904
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:46,925
But I just saw...

905
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:48,802
Because you're the one I love.

906
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:50,387
Huh?

907
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:54,891
Riko, I love you...

908
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,404
Your birthday present...

909
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:11,033
You don't have to accept it
if you don't want to.

910
01:06:08,674 --> 01:06:10,050
I have been a void

911
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,762
to all others since the very beginning.

912
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:22,521
Not even my own mother.

913
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:25,482
What shall we eat?

914
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,567
Broccoli!

915
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:37,661
I'm sorry I brought Anna along.

916
01:06:38,537 --> 01:06:39,496
It's fine.

917
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,249
Because this is the last time.

918
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,838
Come on, hurry!

919
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:48,797
Okay.

920
01:07:10,444 --> 01:07:12,320
I'm not being pessimistic.

921
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,282
I'm only being realistic.

922
01:07:18,577 --> 01:07:19,911
Even if I'm gone,

923
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:23,832
there's no need to fill that void.

924
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:28,920
Even now...

925
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:32,841
Because I have always been a void to them,

926
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:34,301
CONTRADICTION

927
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,927
...since the very beginning.

928
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:39,389
People are laughing,

929
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:41,308
crying,

930
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,185
being angry,

931
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:45,520
being happy...

932
01:07:47,314 --> 01:07:48,857
Even while I'm doing this,

933
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,818
they're going on with their lives.

934
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,617
This may sound like a contradiction,

935
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,578
but all I ask for now,

936
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:04,998
is that through my death,

937
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,084
somebody will be...

938
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,630
aware of my existence...

939
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,672
Are you thinking of jumping?

940
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:57,968
That sounds like a good idea.

941
01:08:58,051 --> 01:09:01,847
But you have to answer correctly first,

942
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:07,060
since Blank is still doing a homestay.

943
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,817
Everybody killed Makoto.

944
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:21,283
Mitsuru,

945
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,201
Mom,

946
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:25,453
Dad,

947
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,205
Mitsuki...

948
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,084
Everybody who didn't
take notice of Makoto,

949
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:34,004
they all drove Makoto to suicide.

950
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:39,509
In there.

951
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:49,853
EIGHT

952
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:53,231
Strike two.

953
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:57,527
You have eight days left.

954
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:34,356
Makoto hasn't come home yet.

955
01:10:34,606 --> 01:10:36,399
What? What about school?

956
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:39,152
I already called.
They said he left a while ago.

957
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,070
Stop.

958
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:43,406
No! I don't want to relive
that moment ever again!

959
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:44,491
Mitsuru...

960
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:46,284
I have to find him...

961
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:47,702
I have to find him...

962
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:49,746
I must find him...

963
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:51,998
Or just like that... Makoto...

964
01:10:52,082 --> 01:10:53,291
It'll be alright!

965
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:54,542
Calm down!

966
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:58,296
I'll go look for him, so you stay home.

967
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:01,508
You need to be here
in case Makoto comes home.

968
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:03,343
Okay?

969
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,892
CALLING
MAKOTO...

970
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:14,604
Makoto...

971
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:24,155
CALLING
MAKOTO...

972
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:48,304
Makoto...

973
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,807
Hurry, get in the car.

974
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,481
No wonder he killed himself.

975
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:01,484
You say you love Makoto's paintings?

976
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,112
You pretend to be a loving mother,

977
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:08,533
but you're playing make-believe
with someone else's family!

978
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,286
Bringing along that cute little girl...

979
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:13,288
Did you have fun?

980
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:15,457
That's not...

981
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,292
No!

982
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:19,419
Today is the last day I'll see him.

983
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:21,212
So you expect to be forgiven?

984
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,590
It was so easy for you.

985
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:27,093
You just ran away
to someone else's family.

986
01:12:28,178 --> 01:12:30,555
But Makoto, he had nowhere to run to...

987
01:12:31,181 --> 01:12:33,391
Death was the only way out for him!

988
01:12:34,309 --> 01:12:36,603
You didn't need to put up his paintings.

989
01:12:36,895 --> 01:12:39,105
You needed to meet him face-to-face!

990
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,778
Makoto's already dead.

991
01:12:53,745 --> 01:12:54,871
Makoto!

992
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:31,407
You were sound asleep.

993
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:37,330
You were lucky. Just minor injuries.

994
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:39,666
You can go home tomorrow.

995
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:45,255
"You were"?

996
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,420
I was afraid to admit...

997
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:28,381
that I was wrong.

998
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:37,724
Come on honey,

999
01:14:40,435 --> 01:14:42,854
give me a chance to talk to you again...

1000
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:52,030
They said she hit her head hard.

1001
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,617
She's still unconscious.

1002
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:09,881
That painting...

1003
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:15,845
You got really hurt that time
and spoiled our family camping trip,

1004
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:20,099
but it might've been our best memory.

1005
01:15:22,644 --> 01:15:23,937
What's the point...

1006
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:26,814
of bringing some old painting...

1007
01:15:26,898 --> 01:15:29,025
Isn't there something
you finally realized?

1008
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:33,196
You still don't get it?

1009
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:39,077
Don't be a baby and expect people
to read your emotions.

1010
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:42,956
If you want to go to art college,

1011
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,459
you gotta face Dad.

1012
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:52,465
Nobody will understand you...

1013
01:15:54,342 --> 01:15:55,885
until you say it out loud.

1014
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:58,638
-Look who's talking, you're...
-Exactly!

1015
01:16:01,099 --> 01:16:02,725
That's why I'm telling you!

1016
01:16:04,352 --> 01:16:07,855
You don't stand out,
and you lack confidence and social skills.

1017
01:16:08,982 --> 01:16:11,276
Day in and day out,
you followed me around,

1018
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:14,195
you'd fall down and cry.
I can't keep my eyes off you.

1019
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:17,907
I have a little brother
who needs so much attention.

1020
01:16:17,991 --> 01:16:21,035
And suddenly, he's gone.
Do you think I can live with that?

1021
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:27,166
Do you think I was okay
seeing you die in front of my eyes?

1022
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:30,878
"Nobody sees me"?

1023
01:16:33,423 --> 01:16:35,466
Then, what were your eyes seeing?

1024
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:38,720
Cut the crap!

1025
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:08,124
There you are!

1026
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:09,083
COMMITTEE MEMBER

1027
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:12,128
We can't find your design.
Do you know where it could be?

1028
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:15,089
Uh...

1029
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:17,467
It's not in the multipurpose room.

1030
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:19,761
Sorry...

1031
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:21,929
Actually, I lost it.

1032
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:23,348
You what?

1033
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:26,934
Come on! What will you do about this?

1034
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:28,811
First Akira,

1035
01:17:28,895 --> 01:17:30,146
now you...

1036
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:32,774
What happened to Akira?

1037
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:36,069
She said she wants to quit.

1038
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:39,405
We're so busy as it is. We need her.

1039
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:40,365
Without her...

1040
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:42,075
Hey, look at this.

1041
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:44,786
Isn't this Mitsuki?

1042
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:46,621
Oh, gosh.

1043
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,831
-Oh, no...
-Really?

1044
01:17:48,915 --> 01:17:50,124
What the hell...

1045
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:57,632
I don't believe it...

1046
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:03,471
Good morning.

1047
01:18:06,808 --> 01:18:08,184
Good morning.

1048
01:18:09,519 --> 01:18:10,686
Mitsuki.

1049
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,649
Any comment on this?

1050
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:23,783
Huh? How...

1051
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:26,285
Okay, then.

1052
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:28,704
Miss Riko, care to comment on this?

1053
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:35,503
It's not my business.
Mitsuki initiated without asking.

1054
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:38,423
Honestly, I'm really annoyed.

1055
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,216
Harsh.

1056
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:12,498
Mitsuki?

1057
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:16,878
I'm sorry.

1058
01:19:18,546 --> 01:19:19,922
This is...

1059
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,593
how you must've felt that time, huh?

1060
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:29,223
I was horrible to you.

1061
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:35,563
Don't worry about it.

1062
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:43,112
You're really a strong person, Makoto.

1063
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:47,825
But I'm not...

1064
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:53,873
I was afraid to be alone...

1065
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:58,920
so I went along with my friends...

1066
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:03,341
All the while, I was hiding my true self,
and I betrayed you.

1067
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,928
But you know what?

1068
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,597
I'm in so much pain now,

1069
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,725
but part of me feels relieved
they found out about Riko.

1070
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:14,352
I wonder why?

1071
01:20:17,063 --> 01:20:18,105
I want to run away,

1072
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:20,608
but all I can remember are
our happy memories.

1073
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:31,327
I want to disappear this very moment...

1074
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,959
but I don't even know
which me is the real me.

1075
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,635
There's...

1076
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:50,388
nothing wrong with that.

1077
01:20:55,977 --> 01:20:59,480
I don't know who the real me is, either.

1078
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:01,941
But you know,

1079
01:21:02,692 --> 01:21:04,110
red,

1080
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:06,320
blue,

1081
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,322
purple...

1082
01:21:10,116 --> 01:21:13,035
We all have multiple colors
within ourselves.

1083
01:21:13,828 --> 01:21:17,748
The "you" that feels relieved
and the "you" that wants to run away,

1084
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:21,127
all these different colors
overlap with each other

1085
01:21:21,544 --> 01:21:23,212
and make you, Mitsuki.

1086
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:28,050
They're all...

1087
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:32,305
your true self, Mitsuki.

1088
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:45,735
And...

1089
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:49,363
It can be quite a pain in the butt
if you die.

1090
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:55,077
That's funny...

1091
01:21:57,163 --> 01:21:59,123
You sound like you have experience.

1092
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:16,557
I'm home.

1093
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:05,606
FROM DAD

1094
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,174
Sorry,

1095
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:57,259
I forgot something.

1096
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:11,941
Guardian?

1097
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,074
Guardian!

1098
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:27,498
Hi everyone.

1099
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:33,003
What's wrong?

1100
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:35,548
Makoto said he lost his design.

1101
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:36,590
What?

1102
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:39,301
We're never going to make the deadline.

1103
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:40,469
What should we do?

1104
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:44,223
We'll use someone else's design instead.

1105
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:58,320
Hey, Guardian!

1106
01:25:58,529 --> 01:26:00,030
I know you're watching me!

1107
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:02,533
Come down here!

1108
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:34,148
Guardian...

1109
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:43,240
Guardian...

1110
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,040
Hey, Guardian!

1111
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:28,911
After I answer correctly,
what will happen to this body?

1112
01:27:30,663 --> 01:27:33,540
If you like it, you can keep it.

1113
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,627
Once you rejoin the cycle of rebirth,

1114
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:39,421
you can be reincarnated
as Makoto Kobayashi.

1115
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:44,426
I don't want it.

1116
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:47,930
I don't need it.

1117
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,140
I...

1118
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:52,643
I want to return this body to Makoto.

1119
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:56,897
Not just to Makoto.

1120
01:27:57,231 --> 01:28:00,567
I want to return Makoto to his family
and everybody around him!

1121
01:28:00,651 --> 01:28:01,527
Please.

1122
01:28:02,111 --> 01:28:04,279
Bring Makoto's soul back!

1123
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:10,411
Alright.

1124
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:13,372
I'll bring it back.

1125
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:18,419
On one condition.
I'm gonna add another question.

1126
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:21,547
By the end of tomorrow,

1127
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:26,885
you have to remember the mistake that you
yourself made in your previous life.

1128
01:28:28,012 --> 01:28:29,930
Then, Makoto can have his body back.

1129
01:28:31,974 --> 01:28:32,933
My?

1130
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:35,227
If you can't answer correctly,

1131
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:38,480
both of your souls will evaporate.

1132
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:41,358
Makoto will be gone, too?

1133
01:28:41,859 --> 01:28:43,569
There's no backing out.

1134
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:48,240
I suggest you open your eyes wide.

1135
01:29:19,063 --> 01:29:23,192
You have to remember the mistake that you
yourself made in your previous life.

1136
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:24,109
WAR
MISTAKES

1137
01:29:24,234 --> 01:29:25,444
STUDENT DEAD BY SUICIDE

1138
01:29:26,487 --> 01:29:29,239
You've done pretty bad things
in your previous life.

1139
01:29:29,323 --> 01:29:30,282
MY MISTAKES

1140
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:33,243
That's merely "how he died."

1141
01:29:33,327 --> 01:29:34,161
BURGLARY
ABUSE

1142
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:36,330
You have to answer what the cause was.

1143
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:40,125
You seem to be enjoying
your time living someone else's life.

1144
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:42,377
Start by learning about Makoto.

1145
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:44,254
CAR CRASH KILLS HIGH SCHOOLER

1146
01:29:45,089 --> 01:29:45,923
Where is it?

1147
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:47,007
You're a trainee.

1148
01:29:47,508 --> 01:29:50,177
You think reincarnation is that easy?

1149
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:53,847
Blank is still doing a homestay.

01:29:53,931 --> 01:29:55,390

1152
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:18,831
I love your paintings.

1153
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:21,291
You love to paint that much?

1154
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:24,461
Do you think I was okay
seeing you die in front of my eyes?

1155
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:54,950
MY LAST WISHES

1156
01:31:12,759 --> 01:31:14,928
MAKOTO

1157
01:31:15,012 --> 01:31:16,180
"Dear Makoto."

1158
01:31:18,849 --> 01:31:20,142
I wanted to...

1159
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:21,852
MAKOTO IS BORN!

1160
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:23,687
...return this body to you.

1162
01:31:31,862 --> 01:31:32,696

FIRST TIME FISHING

1164
01:31:33,864 --> 01:31:35,073
I've run out of time...

1165
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:39,077
OUR FIRST FAMILY CAMPING TRIP!

1166
01:31:39,328 --> 01:31:42,497

ARTIST MAKOTO'S MASTERPIECE

1168
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:46,251
Makoto,

1169
01:31:47,336 --> 01:31:49,546
I'm sorry I couldn't return this body...

1170
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:52,424
to you...

1171
01:31:54,176 --> 01:31:57,054
FISHING!

1172
01:32:03,936 --> 01:32:05,395
EXCITED FOR FIREWORKS

1173
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:07,439

1176
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:18,867
FIRST DAY OF HIGH SCHOOL

1177
01:32:18,951 --> 01:32:19,785
Akira...

1178
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:22,788
SHUYU GAKUIN HIGH SCHOOL

1179
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:25,999
I asked you to help

1180
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:28,377
because I know you can do it, Makoto.

1181
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:42,391

1183
01:33:47,164 --> 01:33:51,335
LET'S DO OUR BEST IN THE REHEARSAL
AS WELL AS THE PERFORMANCE TOMORROW!

1184
01:34:44,137 --> 01:34:45,722
You're in charge of filming?

1185
01:34:47,099 --> 01:34:49,184
We need to check the whole procedure.

1186
01:34:51,478 --> 01:34:52,396
I see.

1187
01:35:01,446 --> 01:35:02,697
Akira...

1188
01:35:09,246 --> 01:35:10,497
I'm sorry...

1189
01:35:16,753 --> 01:35:17,879
You really hurt me.

1190
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:20,257
Enough hurt to last a lifetime.

1191
01:35:23,009 --> 01:35:23,844
Yeah...

1192
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:25,846
But,

1193
01:35:26,805 --> 01:35:27,848
let's call it even.

1194
01:35:29,683 --> 01:35:30,517
What?

1195
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:32,811
I didn't realize...

1196
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:37,023
how much you were struggling and in pain.

1197
01:35:39,568 --> 01:35:40,402
So...

1198
01:35:41,278 --> 01:35:42,821
I'm sorry, too.

1199
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,286
What an idiot...

1200
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:51,413
What?

1201
01:35:52,247 --> 01:35:55,792
It's just that,
I think I'm really an idiot...

1202
01:35:58,170 --> 01:36:01,673
You've always been there for me.

1203
01:36:06,636 --> 01:36:07,762
Thank you.

1204
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:13,727
You're... being too honest. It's creepy.

1205
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:19,191
This...

1206
01:36:20,233 --> 01:36:21,943
I know it's too late, but...

1207
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:24,070
What is it?

1208
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:27,616
I wanted to give that to you, Akira.

1209
01:36:38,502 --> 01:36:39,336
This...

1210
01:36:40,921 --> 01:36:44,382
I couldn't go to the fireworks show
with you, so...

1211
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:05,320
That's awesome.

1212
01:37:05,779 --> 01:37:06,613
Yeah.

1213
01:37:07,614 --> 01:37:09,658
We can see this just once in a lifetime.

1214
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:11,660
What? Once?

1215
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:13,411
It's the 100th anniversary.

1216
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:16,289
We won't be around for the 200th, will we?

1217
01:37:25,465 --> 01:37:26,383
I'm so glad...

1218
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:29,678
I got to see this.

1219
01:37:31,221 --> 01:37:34,307
Tomorrow's the big day, not today.

1220
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:43,984
Oh...

1221
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:46,069
Makoto, your painting is next.

1222
01:37:46,653 --> 01:37:47,487
Huh?

1223
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:51,741
I borrowed a painting of yours
from the Art Club and made it.

1224
01:37:52,993 --> 01:37:57,163
If I can't pick a painting,
what's the use of being on the Committee?

1225
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:18,727
It's... the same...

1226
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:29,237
I chose my favorite painting.

1227
01:38:35,452 --> 01:38:36,286
Makoto,

1228
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:39,873
you've changed a little bit,

1229
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:43,585
but you're still the same you.

1230
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:07,567
Makoto?

1231
01:39:13,365 --> 01:39:15,367
It's nothing.

1232
01:39:19,537 --> 01:39:22,040
-I have to go now.
-Okay.

1233
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:21,558
I know what mistake I made...

1234
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:27,981
I am responsible for Makoto's death.

1235
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:38,783
I killed myself.

1236
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:13,985
I...

1237
01:41:15,737 --> 01:41:16,905
I am Makoto.

1238
01:41:49,229 --> 01:41:50,814
Congratulations, Blank.

1239
01:41:58,196 --> 01:42:01,783
You did a wonderful job!

1240
01:42:03,535 --> 01:42:04,744
Aren't you the nurse?

1241
01:42:04,828 --> 01:42:05,829
Yeah, yeah.

1242
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:10,124
I'm just as surprised as you are.
This person is working two jobs.

1243
01:42:10,667 --> 01:42:12,502
He must be living a tough life.

1244
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:14,921
Yeah, but...

1245
01:42:16,756 --> 01:42:18,383
what's gonna happen to me?

1246
01:42:19,008 --> 01:42:20,593
Of course,

1247
01:42:21,094 --> 01:42:22,053
you're gonna die.

1248
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:27,016
A few decades from now

1249
01:42:27,684 --> 01:42:29,185
as Makoto Kobayashi.

1250
01:42:30,353 --> 01:42:31,187
What?

1251
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:33,022
What? Aren't you happy?

1252
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:35,733
Um...

1253
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:38,695
Happy? It's more like...

1254
01:42:39,863 --> 01:42:41,364
mixed emotions...

1255
01:42:42,866 --> 01:42:43,908
Anxiousness?

1256
01:42:43,992 --> 01:42:46,870
Come on, don't worry.
You completed your homestay.

1257
01:42:46,953 --> 01:42:49,789
-I thought it was someone else's life.
-So what?

1258
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:52,709
You're tapping out?

1259
01:42:52,959 --> 01:42:53,835
Huh?

1260
01:42:54,711 --> 01:42:55,837
Can I?

1261
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,380
Of course you can't!

1262
01:42:57,964 --> 01:42:59,215
I know that.

1263
01:43:04,429 --> 01:43:05,638
After all,

1264
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:08,641
life is merely a long-term homestay.

1265
01:43:14,147 --> 01:43:15,315
Will I see you again?

1266
01:43:20,945 --> 01:43:21,946
Makoto,

1267
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:24,908
hold on to your life, okay?

1268
01:44:35,728 --> 01:44:36,729
Dear Makoto.

1269
01:44:39,732 --> 01:44:40,692
I wanted to

1270
01:44:41,859 --> 01:44:44,529
return this body to you.

1271
01:44:48,616 --> 01:44:52,620
You were wrong to think
that nobody was aware of you.

1272
01:44:55,748 --> 01:44:57,417
You were the one who wasn't aware

1273
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:02,422
that everybody was there for you.

1274
01:45:02,505 --> 01:45:05,091
NO RESEMBLANCE - MAKOTO
BY AKIRA

1275
01:45:05,591 --> 01:45:08,136
That's why I wanted to return
this body to you

1276
01:45:09,637 --> 01:45:10,763
and return Makoto...

1277
01:45:10,847 --> 01:45:12,181
OVERDUE

1278
01:45:13,266 --> 01:45:14,934
...to your family.

1279
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:31,743
But...

1280
01:45:32,285 --> 01:45:33,870
I've run out of time.

1281
01:45:33,953 --> 01:45:35,747
I'm sorry for the late return.

1282
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:37,290
Makoto.

1283
01:45:39,167 --> 01:45:41,544
I'm sorry I couldn't return
this body to you.

1284
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:48,217
But,

1285
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:51,971
there's something I had to tell you.

1286
01:45:53,222 --> 01:45:56,309
Dear Makoto, I wanted to
return this body to you. You were...

1287
01:45:56,392 --> 01:45:57,602
"You were...

1288
01:45:58,895 --> 01:46:00,480
"loved all along."

1289
01:46:07,695 --> 01:46:09,072
Makoto!

1290
01:46:13,159 --> 01:46:14,202
Here.

1291
01:46:14,285 --> 01:46:16,496
I told you to bring this to your mom.

1292
01:46:16,746 --> 01:46:18,790
Oh, sorry, I forgot.

1293
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:22,418
Yeah.

1294
01:46:22,543 --> 01:46:24,378
You're the same old Makoto...

1295
01:46:25,922 --> 01:46:27,006
What do you mean?

1296
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:30,093
I'm not telling.

1297
01:46:35,181 --> 01:46:36,599
That's why, I've decided

1298
01:46:40,478 --> 01:46:42,647
to love this life a little longer.

1299
01:46:49,904 --> 01:46:51,781
I'm going to hold on to my life.

1300
01:46:53,658 --> 01:46:55,159
After all, life is merely

1301
01:46:56,077 --> 01:46:57,870
a long-term homestay.
