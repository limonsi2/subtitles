3
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,000
Forgive me, Father.

4
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,000
Where were you?

5
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,208
With a friend. Joséphine.

6
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,250
Joséphine? Who is she?

7
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:36,625
I've never heard of her.

8
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,208
You don't know her.

9
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,708
Bless this meal,
and those who made it,

10
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,875
that those who have nothing
may receive.

11
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,041
Amen.

12
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,666
Amen.

13
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,250
Saying grace amuses you, Théophile?

14
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,000
No.

15
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,083
I won't be here tomorrow.

16
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,833
There's the De Beyles' debate.

17
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,875
Good. You can better yourself.

18
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,000
France needs intelligent men.

19
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,000
And me?

20
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,166
Once you join your father's office,

21
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,416
your high society friends
will be invaluable.

22
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,333
A good job,

23
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,208
a good marriage...

24
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,041
It's all I want for you.

25
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,541
I doubt he'll find a wife
at a salon debate.

26
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,750
Can I come too?
I've never been to a salon debate.

27
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,125
With the De Beyles?

28
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,166
Yes, if you'd like to.

29
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,583
Out of the question.

30
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,625
Who are you?

31
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,000
You frightened me.

32
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,041
I won't be long.

33
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,625
See you soon, my dear.

34
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,083
No, it's fine like that.

35
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,333
Goodnight.

36
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:12,791
Goodnight, my dear.

37
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:17,916
Eugénie.

38
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,041
Tell me...

39
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,916
You were really at the funeral
of this Victor Hugo,

40
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,333
weren't you?

41
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,291
Yes, Grandmother.

42
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,958
It was incredible. Such a crowd.

43
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,625
I'm sure there was.

44
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,666
You can go, now.

45
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes...

46
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,250
-Wait...
-I know...

47
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,583
You never know...

48
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,333
Later.

49
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,958
Another night.

50
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,583
When can I see you?

51
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,208
No, Eugénie, no!

52
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,291
Father said no, and so do I.

53
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,875
I am not taking you to this debate.

54
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,333
What if he found out?

55
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,041
A girl like you, there?
Everyone would notice you.

56
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,750
They would gossip...

57
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,958
Will you shut up?
I don't give a damn about your debate.

58
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,291
Talking to you and your friends
for hours?

59
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,416
I'd rather die!

60
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,916
Drop me at the café, on the way.

61
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,833
I need to take the air, read, smoke...
Please, Théo!

62
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,291
-But if Father...
-What about him? He's not here.

63
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,708
Louis, let's go. To Montmartre.

64
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:43,833
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,500
Montmartre?

66
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,666
You're not serious? Montmartre?

67
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,958
Remember: I didn't bring you,
I don't know you,

68
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,416
and you'll get home on your own.

69
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,500
What?

70
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,208
Nothing. Just looking at you.

71
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,625
And?

72
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,375
You're handsome.

73
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,666
Don't be silly.

74
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,166
I have a scrawny neck, no shoulders,

75
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,208
long legs, a short torso...

76
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,416
So, no, I'm not handsome.

77
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,791
Well, I think you are.

78
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,916
Like I said.
You're a silly little girl.

79
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,666
I know.

80
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,250
Hello. One brioche, please.

81
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,791
Five centimes.

82
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,375
Thank you.

83
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,125
Poor old Rémi. Here's to you.

84
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,375
<i>Tomorrow, at dawn,</i>
<i>at the moment when the land whitens</i>

85
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,666
<i>I will leave.</i>

86
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,500
<i>You see, I know</i>
<i>that you are waiting for me.</i>

87
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,958
You're reading <i>Contemplations?</i>

88
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,083
I love that part.

89
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,791
<i>And when I arrive,</i>
<i>I will put on your grave</i>

90
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,208
<i>A bouquet of green holly</i>
<i>and heather in bloom.</i>

91
00:10:59,125 --> 00:10:59,958
Is that right?

92
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,083
May I sit here?

93
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,750
Yes, it's <i>Contemplations.</i>

94
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,708
But you can't sit here.

95
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,666
I'd like to be alone. I'm reading.

96
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:12,875
Thank you.

97
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,250
Sorry for any misunderstanding.
I thought you were looking at me.

98
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,458
You don't often see
a girl reading poetry

99
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,125
turning to look at a man
who's also reading...

100
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,791
I wasn't looking at you.

101
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,375
I see.

102
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,458
Well...

103
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,416
I'll go, then.

104
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,125
I was looking at your book.

105
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,458
You were?

106
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,000
Then you were looking at me.

107
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,208
No!

108
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,958
You were! Because
I was holding the book.

109
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,166
I was holding it.
I was right here, behind it.

110
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,416
It was your book I was looking at.

111
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,250
"Man is made of three things.

112
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,708
Firstly, the body, the material being,
similar to an animal,

113
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,250
and animated by the same life force.

114
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,375
Secondly, the soul.

115
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,625
The spirit that the body contains.

116
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,041
Thirdly...

117
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,708
The connection between body and soul."

118
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,041
You weren't looking at my body
but at my soul.

119
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,833
Forgive me.

120
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,000
It appears I've upset you.

121
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:24,833
No.

122
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,750
Not at all.

123
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,916
I liked it.

124
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,458
I liked it very much.

125
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,250
Here.

126
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,375
For you.

127
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,208
I can't accept this.

128
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,666
I'm lending it to you.

129
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,375
You can give it back.

130
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,708
Promise?

131
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,541
I promise.

132
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,291
Thank you.

133
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,500
What's that?

134
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,625
More poetry?

135
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,958
"The Spirits Book."

136
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,250
Really?

137
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,416
With a little note from Ernest!

138
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,208
Looks like my sister
is making some lovely friends.

139
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,250
No!

140
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,625
Eugénie Cléry,
slumming it in Montmartre!

141
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,541
You lost my page.

142
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,541
Your friends don't have a monopoly
on the life of the spirit.

143
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,666
You'd be surprised who you meet
in the cafés of north Paris.

144
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,250
I bet I would.

145
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,541
Can I stay a little more?

146
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,250
Yes, but in silence.

147
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,541
Will you be seeing him again?

148
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,541
-Who?
-Who?

149
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,458
Ernest. The poet.

150
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,875
Who sends ladies' hearts a-flutter...

151
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,208
Your hands are cold.

152
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:40,041
It may be too late
for me to shine on the battlefield

153
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,750
but I've helped our country
make progress with order and justice.

154
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,458
This Legion of Honour
will be a blessing for our practice.

155
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,458
I'll do my best
to pass on your request...

156
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,833
-You seem happy, Hortense.
-Yes.

157
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,833
I'm making my society début.

158
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,750
I'll be presented next month
at the Duchesse de Noailles's ball.

159
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:05,375
Presented, like a horse at market?
Will they check your teeth?

160
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,875
Congratulations, what will you wear?

161
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,583
An evening gown from Doucet.

162
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,916
-Silk.
-I have no doubt you'll look beautiful.

163
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,250
Is that what you think of me, Eugénie?

164
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,708
That I'm some doll?

165
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,416
It's not what my sister meant,
quite the contrary.

166
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,333
Apologies, Hortense,
I didn't mean to offend you.

167
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,333
I find it degrading, that's all.

168
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
-But I'm not judging.
-You are!

169
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,583
That's exactly what you're doing!

170
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:34,666
Hortense...

171
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,250
What did you do and say now?

172
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:46,125
-You always have to embarrass me.
-Father, I didn't want to...

173
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,541
Not another word.

174
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,333
My career and our name are at stake.

175
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,333
Think a little, you fool.

176
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,750
Thank you, Marthe.

177
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,583
My pleasure, Lady Eugénie.

178
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,083
Forward.

179
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,208
Forward.

180
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,291
No, go back.

181
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,333
To the right. Careful, Louis!

182
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,750
To the right. No, the other right.

183
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,000
-It's heavy, Eugénie!
-There.

184
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:44,791
-Here?
-Yes.

185
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:53,375
Would you agree
that it's in exactly the same place?

186
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,875
Yes, I would totally agree.

187
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,750
Let's go find the decorations.

188
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,333
OK.

189
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,208
Where are he ribbons?

190
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,000
They're in the large trunk at the back.

191
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,333
-This one?
-Yes.

192
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,958
How can I get to it?

193
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,583
Could you help me?

194
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,583
This one...

195
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Eugénie, come help me, I can't do it.

196
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,125
Eugénie?

197
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:34,958
Eugénie?

198
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,458
I'm here.

199
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,333
Stay with me.

200
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,916
Stay with me.

201
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,666
Tell me what I can do.

202
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,000
It's over. It's over...

203
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,458
What a fright you gave me.

204
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,500
Was it him again?

205
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,416
No, it wasn't him.

206
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,333
What do you mean?

207
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,000
I see others.

208
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,083
They're all different.

209
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,416
For the last few days,
a young woman's been speaking to me.

210
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,375
She's suffering.

211
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,458
If only you could see her.

212
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,208
She's asking for my help,
but I don't know how.

213
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,750
I feel so useless.

214
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,375
Brother...

215
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,750
I read that book,

216
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,166
that marvelous book
that made everything clear to me.

217
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,583
Talk to me, say something.

218
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,416
I'm scared.

219
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,833
I'm scared of those things,
you know I am.

220
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,750
That book told me that I'm not alone,

221
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,166
that spirits are real.

222
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,166
Everything's OK.

223
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,125
For the first time,
I'm not scared of who I am anymore.

224
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,416
What if you see others?

225
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,291
I know what happens to girls like you.

226
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,541
Girls like me?

227
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,041
I was waiting for that one!

228
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,291
-It is still your turn.
-Yes, it is my lucky day.

229
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,416
Eugénie, sit up straight.

230
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,500
Thank you, Marthe.

231
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,000
Eugénie.

232
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,416
What's the matter?

233
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,500
Darling, you're scaring me.

234
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,083
What's wrong?

235
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,166
What's going on? Stop, will you?

236
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,166
Stop.

237
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,791
Stop!

238
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,458
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

239
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,291
It's a miracle.

240
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,166
It's a miracle.

241
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,916
How is this possible?

242
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,583
I lost this 40 years ago.

243
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,166
It was an engagement gift
from your grandfather.

244
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,291
I thought...

245
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:19,500
I thought that our maid at the time
had stolen it.

246
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,666
How did you know?

247
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,750
I don't know.

248
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,791
Tell me.

249
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:33,791
Eugénie...

250
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:37,375
How did you know? Tell me, poppet.

251
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,541
Grandfather's the one who told me.

252
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,375
Eugénie...

253
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:00,750
You were right

254
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,500
to confide in me.

255
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:05,916
Thank you.

256
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,916
Hello, Mother.

257
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,041
Is everything OK?

258
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,166
Your father wants to take you to Meudon

259
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,458
for a second chance
with the Prevost-Roumagnacs.

260
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:57,541
And if Hortense

261
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,708
shows you her gown
for the Noailles Ball,

262
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,833
try to muster up some enthusiasm.

263
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,583
No scandals, no tantrums.

264
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,291
Pull it together.

265
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:09,958
Yes, Mother.

266
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,208
You're crying.

267
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:25,583
Mother...

268
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,500
I promise I'll be on my best behavior.

269
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,708
I promise I won't let you down.

270
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,041
Eugénie...

271
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:51,583
sit up straight, please.

272
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:19,333
Where are we?

273
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:21,458
I don't recognize the...

274
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:24,666
No, not that.

275
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,041
Not that. Not that, please.

276
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:29,000
Théophile...

277
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,083
Théophile!
Not the Salpêtrière asylum!

278
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,583
Théophile, not Salpêtrière.

279
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,833
Please.

280
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:38,750
No, I'm not sick. No, not that!

281
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,000
Not that, please!

282
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:42,833
Théophile!

283
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:44,708
No, please...

284
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,000
Please, not that. Not that.

285
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:49,000
No, not that!

286
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:50,583
Théo! Théo!

287
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:53,583
Not that!

288
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:57,500
Father!

289
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,750
Father!

290
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,666
Please... Théo! Théo!

291
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,333
DECEMBER 18, 1885

292
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,125
Have you calmed down?

293
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,458
I'm going to examine you,
tell me if I hurt you.

294
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:15,916
Open your mouth.

295
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:27,916
All good.

296
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,166
You're healthy.

297
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,833
I don't belong here.

298
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,708
That's not up to you.

299
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:46,125
It's up to your father - well, it was.

300
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,166
Now it's up to Dr. Charcot,
that's how it is.

301
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:53,166
Get dressed.

302
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,958
Take her to the dormitory.

303
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,125
If she causes a ruckus,
put her in cell.

304
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:34,541
That always gets the newbies going.

305
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:06,041
Give it back. Come back right now.
Julie!

306
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:09,166
Give it back! Thief.

307
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:10,458
Thief!

308
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,625
Here's your bed, Cléry.

309
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,000
Stop!

310
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,541
Shoo! Go on, shoo!

311
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,583
Go away.

312
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:35,666
Hi.

313
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,000
I'm Louise.

314
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:38,750
Eugénie Cléry.

315
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:42,125
Well, well,
aren't you all dressed up, Eugénie?

316
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,958
Damn, guys, a toff!

317
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:48,250
We don't often get ladies around here.

318
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,500
We're bed neighbors, that's good.

319
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,791
I'm a lady too, didn't you know?
I'm engaged.

320
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,458
-Are you engaged?
-No.

321
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:56,875
Really?

322
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,583
But you're so beautiful.

323
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,708
You must have lots of suitors.

324
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,000
Love just isn't fair.

325
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,750
That's why I'm lucky.

326
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:08,250
My man's handsome,
and he's not just anyone,

327
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:09,625
he's a doctor!

328
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:12,250
That's right,
I'm going to be high society too!

329
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:14,166
You do believe me? It's true.

330
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,875
Have you chosen your outfit?

331
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,250
-What outfit?
-For the ball.

332
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:23,000
You're a funny one.
For the mid-Lent ball!

333
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:26,708
I'm going to go for a Spanish style
with a mantilla, a flounce,

334
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,125
a dress that spins, gloves,
the whole shebang!

335
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,666
Do you know what I picture for you?

336
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,916
You'll look pretty!
And we'll find you a fiancé.

337
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:38,958
You'll see, you'll be Eugénie Cléry,
the belle of the ball!

338
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:41,958
Don't listen to her, she's a nutcase.

339
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,791
Suzanne, sit down!

340
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:55,333
She arrived 2 months ago.

341
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:58,125
She hasn't said a word,
but I'm sure she can talk.

342
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,916
Don't push me.

343
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:00,916
It's Marguerite.

344
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,625
She's never happy.

345
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:04,500
And don't look at me that way.

346
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,708
Henriette,
the one getting up, is depressed,

347
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,375
which, for me, isn't an illness.

348
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:16,666
They also call women
who stare into space for hours sick.

349
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,291
Then there's Therese.

350
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:23,333
She pushed her husband
into the Seine in a jealous rage.

351
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,958
She's been here 25 years,
knitting for the girls.

352
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,333
On the left is Denise.

353
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:32,333
I don't know what her illness is,
but she's nuts.

354
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:37,625
But don't worry, they're not mean.

355
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,375
What's your illness?

356
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:42,833
What's yours?

357
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:46,833
My aunt found me on the floor
flipping out one day.

358
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,250
I didn't want her husband on me.

359
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:51,250
I told her and she screamed at me.

360
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:53,333
She sent me here,

361
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:54,833
to get rid of me.

362
00:32:56,916 --> 00:33:00,375
I dream of him forcing me to look
in his pants and a snake coming out.

363
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:01,875
It's pretty scary.

364
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:05,375
But when I wake up,
I'm here with another oaf.

365
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:09,166
Imagine if I'd never met Jules.

366
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,416
Life works out pretty well.

367
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,041
Up you get.

368
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,000
It's time, Louise.

369
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:57,750
-How's it going this morning?
-Fine.

370
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:01,333
I hope I'll be good.

371
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,208
Yes, as per usual.

372
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:21,375
Come on, up.

373
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,250
Outside.

374
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:27,583
Was that Charcot?

375
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,000
We've never seen Master Charcot here.

376
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:36,208
Marguerite...

377
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,416
-Get up.
-No!

378
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:40,500
-Hurry up.
-Leave me alone!

379
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:43,125
I want to sleep.

380
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:17,625
Right, hello, gentlemen, hello.

381
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:29,208
Introducing a patient
with acute symptomatic hysteria.

382
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:32,916
I will therefore proceed
to the hypnotic stage

383
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:36,750
and will require
the greatest attention and silence.

384
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,458
Thank you.

385
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:46,125
Louise, you will listen to my voice.

386
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:48,208
Nothing but my voice.

387
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:52,625
You're listening to my voice
and your eyelids are getting heavy.

388
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:54,666
Your eyes are closing.

389
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,083
Don't fight it, Louise.

390
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:00,041
Your eyelids are closing.

391
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,416
All you can hear is my voice.

392
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,541
And now, Louise,

393
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:06,958
go to sleep. Sleep.

394
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:19,791
Stretch your arms in front of you.

395
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,791
Very good, Louise.

396
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,458
Now touch your stomach.

397
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:39,000
Touch your chest, Louise.

398
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:45,833
Touch your throat, Louise.

399
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,041
Graze your chin, Louise.

400
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:58,833
Touch your mouth, Louise.

401
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:06,291
Open your lips, Louise.

402
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,916
Touch your lips, Louise.

403
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:15,416
Louise,
clasp your hands out in front of you.

404
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,125
Louise.

405
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:22,083
Clasp your hands out.

406
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,375
Silence.

407
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,708
See you all next Tuesday.

408
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,875
That feels good.

409
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:47,541
Does that feel good?

410
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:53,958
You want some help?

411
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:01,125
-I have a headache.
-That's normal.

412
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,500
You did very well.

413
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:07,375
Dr. Charcot is very happy.

414
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:17,958
Thank you, Miss Gleizes.

415
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:21,125
I'll leave my assessment report
on your desk.

416
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:22,750
Very well, Doctor.

417
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:30,375
Julie.

418
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:32,791
Louise needs to rest.

419
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:34,750
I'll take care of her.

420
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,250
Alone.

421
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm tired, Jules.

422
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:52,125
I know.

423
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:54,625
You were wonderful.

424
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:59,333
You're so pretty, my darling Louise.

425
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,833
-I'm not your Louise.
-Yes, you are.

426
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:04,000
You say that to all the girls.

427
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:07,625
I only say it to you.

428
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:10,750
I want to marry you, Louise.

429
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,625
You know that. I already told you.

430
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,750
When will you propose to me?

431
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,958
-Soon, my darling, soon.
-But when?

432
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:25,875
At the ball.

433
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,541
-But it's a long way away.
-No, it's not.

434
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:31,291
It's not, Louisette...

435
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:34,375
It'll go quickly when we're engaged.

436
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,250
I love you.

437
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,750
I love you.

438
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,541
What are you doing, Jules?

439
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,916
I don't know.

440
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:12,958
It's your fault.

441
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:16,375
I love you so much, Louise.

442
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:19,375
I love you so much.

443
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:30,625
-That's not the right time, is it?
-It is, Ms. Geneviève.

444
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,750
See you soon.

445
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:17,083
It's me, Father.

446
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:22,333
I hope so,
I've been waiting for you for an hour.

447
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,208
Apologies, I got held up.

448
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:29,166
I'm in a hurry, I'm late.

449
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:31,208
You're always late.

450
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,958
I was always late too.

451
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:38,208
I never started a meal on time,
but I always finished it early.

452
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,416
At this morning's Lesson,
Louise had an extraordinary fit.

453
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:44,125
She fell to the ground,

454
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:46,291
writhing and tensed up.

455
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:48,125
She didn't look human anymore.

456
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,000
Opisthotonos?

457
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:54,083
Under hypnosis.

458
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,333
Epilepsy perhaps?

459
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,875
Charcot may be triggering nerve activity
during his sessions.

460
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,333
That would explain the hysteria.

461
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,708
Are you a neurologist now, Dr. Gleizes?

462
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:11,916
Well, my child, if I were
to go back to studying medicine now,

463
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:15,958
that's what I would choose
to specialize in: Salpêtrière.

464
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:19,708
We'd work together
and you would assist.

465
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,041
We'd have lunch every afternoon,

466
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:25,166
and you'd use the time
to report back to me.

467
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:29,125
Charcot should rely on you.

468
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:31,666
You're the one who knows the girls.

469
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:37,583
There's a new girl.

470
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,625
What's she like?

471
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:42,791
She's...

472
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:47,875
Intense.

473
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:52,291
"Intense" isn't a symptom.

474
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:07,666
Everything OK, Eugénie?

475
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,833
Great, ma'am.

476
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:12,500
You can call me Geneviève.

477
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:13,916
Very well, ma'am.

478
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:16,500
I'm not staying here for much longer.

479
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:18,875
I told you, it's not up to you.

480
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,416
Yes, it's up to you.

481
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:22,000
And you're going to help me.

482
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:23,416
OK.

483
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:26,375
We'll go see the doctors tomorrow.

484
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:29,625
Bl...

485
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,166
Blan...

486
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,000
Are you having a seizure?

487
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:38,833
Blandine.

488
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:44,041
Is Blandine your sister?

489
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,458
Stop or it's ether for you.

490
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:48,041
She's a redhead, right?

491
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:54,708
If you think you'll get out like that...

492
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:56,083
You all call me crazy,

493
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:59,208
but how come you write
thousands of letters to your sister?

494
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:01,458
Is it because
you think she can hear you?

495
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,416
As well you do believe in spirits,
she hears you.

496
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:06,833
She watches you too, you know.

497
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,708
Do you want to talk to her?

498
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:12,750
She's here.

499
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,541
In the room.

500
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:17,291
-She's ready to listen to you.
-Shut up.

501
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:22,333
Shut up.

502
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:42,083
Cléry?

503
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,166
-Are you sleeping?
-No.

504
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:47,250
Are you feeling better?

505
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:48,791
I dunno.

506
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:50,333
You know...

507
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:51,583
What?

508
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,500
I'm really glad that you're next to me.

509
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:56,458
That makes us bed sisters.

510
00:46:58,375 --> 00:46:59,750
Hey, Louise.

511
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:03,583
What will you do when you get out?

512
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,875
When I get out...

513
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:07,875
I don't know.

514
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:13,333
I would go pig out in Les Halles.

515
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:15,541
And then...

516
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,791
Then I'd go to a dive bar!

517
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:20,250
You think dive bars
will still be around?

518
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:21,625
No danger of them closing.

519
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:23,500
Then...

520
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:26,500
I'd go to the boulevard
and nick wallets off the toffs.

521
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:29,916
-How will you do, you wily fox?
-What are you talking about?

522
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:32,333
I was the best pickpocket around.

523
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,250
Goldfinger, they used to call me.

524
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:37,833
I'd find my husband, stab him slowly,

525
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:39,625
and watch him bleed out.

526
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:42,375
Luckily, you're not due to leave yet.

527
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,458
I'd take a nice hot bath,
like rich people do.

528
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:04,041
With hot water and clean towels.

529
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,375
White and clean.

530
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,500
Laudanum every night.

531
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:15,708
One tablespoon on Mondays and Fridays,
two on the other nights.

532
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:19,541
Cléry Eugénie, 26 years old,
parents in good health.

533
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:22,333
Young brother in good health.
No medical history.

534
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,583
Claims to talk to the dead.
Her father had her committed.

535
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,833
Is it true that you talk to the dead?

536
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,666
Answer my question.

537
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,333
I don't talk to the dead.

538
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,458
-Well...
-They're spirits.

539
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,541
I didn't ask for this, it just happened.

540
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:51,833
Hearing spirits isn't the norm,

541
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,250
young lady.

542
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:56,958
We accept that a young girl
saw the Virgin in Lourdes.

543
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,291
That doesn't bother anyone.

544
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,333
So what? That has nothing to do with it.

545
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:07,666
Why is it acceptable to believe in God
and not in spirits?

546
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,000
Why her and not me?

547
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:20,916
I'm asking you a question:
why her and not me?

548
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,125
Calm down.

549
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:23,958
I'll do so if I want.

550
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:28,166
It doesn't say that you're seeing God,
you're seeing the dead.

551
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:31,291
-If you believe everything...
-Enough. I've heard enough.

552
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:34,458
Treatment two. Hydrotherapy.

553
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:35,708
Fifteen days.

554
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,333
Don't touch me.

555
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,583
-Let's go.
-Don't touch me.

556
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:50,416
Don't touch me!

557
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:53,208
Let go of my arm!

558
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:57,500
Hysterical.

559
00:49:57,666 --> 00:49:58,833
No doubt at all.

560
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:20,500
I'm calm.
I'm calm now.

561
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:22,708
I'm calm...

562
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:27,083
You don't need to do this!
I'm calm!

563
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,750
-Come on.
-No!

564
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:35,916
What's going on here?

565
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,500
Please... Please!

566
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:37,333
Out you come.

567
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:02,083
-Geneviève Gleizes?
-Who are you?

568
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,250
Hello, ma'am.
Don't be afraid.

569
00:53:04,416 --> 00:53:06,708
My name is Théophile Cléry.

570
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,000
I want to know how my sister is.

571
00:53:10,166 --> 00:53:11,791
I can't tell you anything.

572
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:14,916
Can you give her this book, please?

573
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,250
-The rules forbid it.
-Please.

574
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:20,125
Please!

575
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:24,541
Please.

576
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:31,875
Thank you, ma'am.

577
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:38,958
It seemed like the right thing.

578
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,250
Honestly.

579
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:44,333
I thought I was helping her.

580
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,291
You'll help her, won't you?

581
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:55,416
Goodbye, Mr Cléry.

582
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,458
Don't worry.
Your body will get used to it.

583
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:39,083
Don't worry, dear, I'll help you.
Here, like this.

584
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:49,500
Here.

585
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,250
Move over,
it's going to splash everywhere.

586
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:13,208
Ms. Geneviève.

587
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:32,875
Your brother gave me a book for you.

588
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:35,833
You saw Théophile?

589
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:37,666
How is he?

590
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:40,791
Well, I imagine.
He asked after you.

591
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,583
I have one thing to ask you
in return for the book.

592
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:47,125
What book?

593
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,875
<i>The Book of Spirits.</i>

594
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:52,000
Have you read it?

595
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:55,375
Yes.

596
00:58:56,708 --> 00:58:57,833
I'd like...

597
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:01,791
to speak to my sister.

598
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:07,458
Ma'am, I'd rather forego the book
and take my freedom.

599
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:10,000
You know that's impossible.

600
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:14,000
Then so is speaking to your sister.

601
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:22,583
Very well.

602
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,791
I'll ask the doctor.

603
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:28,041
But only if I can speak to my sister.

604
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:32,291
-Thank you.
-I'll let you know when.

605
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:50,666
Berthe came back totally crushed.

606
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:53,916
I don't know how long
she was in there - 8, 10 days?

607
00:59:54,083 --> 00:59:58,000
With Jeanne? At least 2 weeks.
It leaves its mark.

608
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:00,041
You know,

609
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:03,083
sometimes I think
she makes them like that.

610
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:04,125
Too bad.

611
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:06,333
Isolation is what they need.

612
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,833
You mean the dungeon.

613
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,333
All right, Geneviève?

614
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:12,875
You look tired. Good thing
they're not photographing you.

615
01:00:23,666 --> 01:00:24,750
Ready, Peltier?

616
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:25,833
Yes, Master.

617
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:31,750
-You're late, Geneviève.
-Forgive me, Master.

618
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:35,000
Give Marie's file to the photographer
for the archives.

619
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:37,500
Hystero-epilepsy and spasms.

620
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:40,833
I'll need the last 6 months' photos

621
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:44,250
for an Academy presentation.

622
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:46,583
It's the only way
to get their attention.

623
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:47,625
Yes, Master.

624
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:50,083
Keep still, Marie.

625
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:51,625
Shoot.

626
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:14,541
"The angel of the Lord appeared

627
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:17,000
"and the Lord's glory

628
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:19,583
"shone all around."

629
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:24,125
And the sons dug for days on end,
and the whole village believed.

630
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:25,375
"I have come

631
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:28,041
"to bring you good news.

632
01:01:28,708 --> 01:01:32,500
And after a month of excavation,
the house fell down!

633
01:01:32,666 --> 01:01:33,833
Merry Christmas.

634
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:46,208
"And suddenly with the angel

635
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:48,625
"there was a heavenly host."

636
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:06,833
<i>My mother</i>

637
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:19,041
<i>Has eyes that kill</i>

638
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:28,000
<i>I like her hands on my body</i>

639
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:41,583
<i>I like the smell under her arms</i>

640
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:44,541
<i>Yes</i>

641
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,750
<i>That's the way I am</i>

642
01:02:56,833 --> 01:03:00,250
<i>In my mother's eyes</i>

643
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:05,416
<i>There is always light</i>

644
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,250
<i>I always find love</i>

645
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:15,708
<i>In my mother's eyes</i>

646
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,833
<i>In my mother's eyes</i>

647
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:23,875
<i>There is always light</i>

648
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:30,666
<i>My mother always listens to me</i>

649
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:34,458
<i>When I'm in the shit</i>

650
01:03:34,625 --> 01:03:38,291
<i>She knows when I'm stupid and feeble</i>

651
01:03:38,416 --> 01:03:42,666
<i>And when I'm bloated like a whale</i>

652
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:47,958
<i>She knows when my feet stink</i>

653
01:03:48,916 --> 01:03:53,041
<i>She knows when I'm naked</i>

654
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:57,583
<i>And when I'm sick</i>

655
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:01,416

<i>There is always light</i>

660

My little one!

661
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:37,083
<i>Still nothing?</i>

662
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,666
No.

663
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:44,500
Anything we can do?

664
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:45,625
Nothing.

665
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,166
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

666
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:01,250
Hurry up.

667
01:06:05,416 --> 01:06:07,958
-You've been lying from the start.
-No.

668
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:16,708
Enough.

669
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,958
Get up.

670
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:22,750
Stop, Eugénie.

671
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:28,583
Eugénie?

672
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:35,875
She's here.

673
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:42,250
-She's here?
-Yes.

674
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:44,166
-Is she speaking to you?
-Yes.

675
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:48,666
She doesn't want...

676
01:06:49,416 --> 01:06:52,208
-She doesn't want what?
-Not now.

677
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,791
She doesn't want to now.

678
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,750
She can't...

679
01:06:57,916 --> 01:07:00,875
-Can't what?
-She doesn't have time.

680
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:03,083
What are you saying?

681
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,916
-It's your father!
-My father?

682
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:08,916
Something's happened to your father
in the kitchen.

683
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:11,333
<i>Something's happened to your father</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

684
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,083
<i>Go now! Hurry!</i>

685
01:07:19,416 --> 01:07:20,375
Father?

686
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:30,625
You stupid woman!

687
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:33,750
You stupid woman!

688
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:46,166
Father?

689
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:17,583
Heaven sent you, my little girl...

690
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:19,166
Don't talk.

691
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:24,625
What miracle brought you here?

692
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:26,875
How did you know?

693
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:31,083
I was suddenly worried about you.

694
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:33,166
That's good.

695
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:36,000
It's good to think of your poor father.

696
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:37,333
Yes, it is.

697
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:41,041
Now rest.

698
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:28,666
Not very good, is it?

699
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,875
Good isn't the word, no.

700
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:34,708
It's not good!

701
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,916
But it's good to hear you laugh.

702
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,875
How did you know?

703
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:50,291
Why did you come?

704
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:53,791
I told you, I felt it.

705
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:55,416
Is it so important?

706
01:09:56,291 --> 01:10:00,583
You don't just "feel" such things.
It doesn't exist.

707
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:03,041
Tell me.

708
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,333
Blandine told me.

709
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:18,500
Don't mention that name, please.

710
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:21,875
A new girl has arrived.
She talks to spirits.

711
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,125
With Blandine.

712
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:26,291
How can you believe such a thing?

713
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:32,666
I raised you to respect science,
and you tell me this nonsense!

714
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:34,583
Aren't you ashamed?

715
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:36,291
I didn't believe it, either.

716
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:39,125
But Blandine talks to her.
I was there.

717
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:41,000
How could I have known otherwise?

718
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:44,666
She's among us,
maybe even here in this room.

719
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:48,791
Blandine's dead.

720
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:51,458
Do you hear me?
Dead!

721
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:54,500
I visit her grave every day.

722
01:10:54,666 --> 01:10:55,708
Dead!

723
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:58,708
I know you blame yourself, but still...

724
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:04,000
She's looking out for us.

725
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:05,125
Be quiet!

726
01:11:06,916 --> 01:11:09,208
You're talking like a witch!

727
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:11,208
And to me!

728
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:15,500
You talk to me about spirits and ghosts!

729
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:19,083
I don't want to hear any more.

730
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:25,666
Father...

731
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,666
It's you I'm losing now,

732
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:34,916
my girl.

733
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,375
Those women have sent you mad.

734
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:43,625
It's contagious!

735
01:11:44,416 --> 01:11:46,833
It's a plague.
Leave me now.

736
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:53,833
Dad...

737
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:56,625
Go!

738
01:11:57,833 --> 01:11:58,750
Please.

739
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,458
Cheese soufflé!

740
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,208
Roast chicken!

741
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:29,875
Rabbit breast.

742
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:32,708
Bread and butter.

743
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:35,625
-Rabbit with truffles.
-Rum baba!

744
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:37,375
Pancakes with jelly.

745
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:39,750
-It's time to go.
-Please, no.

746
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:41,083
What? Come on.

747
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:44,541
I did it not long ago.
I went last week.

748
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:46,500
Don't make a fuss, Henriette.

749
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:50,083
It's just that it still hurts.

750
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,625
-Come with us.
-Come on, Henriette.

751
01:12:52,916 --> 01:12:55,500
Can't we do it another day?

752
01:12:55,666 --> 01:12:57,125
That's not possible.

753
01:12:57,375 --> 01:12:59,333
-Come on.
-No, please!

754
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,583
Don't make us call the doctors.

755
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:03,583
-Can't it wait till tomorrow?
-No.

756
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:11,416
Sir?

757
01:13:11,583 --> 01:13:13,916
I'd like to discuss the clinical trials.

758
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:15,625
It seems that...

759
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:20,541
Stop moving.

760
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:28,666
Ovaries swollen...

761
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,666
and painful.

762
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:38,750
Increase the bloodletting
to twice a day.

763
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:47,875
What's happening?

764
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:48,916
Eugénie!

765
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:51,416
Doctor! What's happening to me?

766
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:53,333
What happened?

767
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,166
An attack under hypnosis:
lateral hemiphlegia, right side.

768
01:13:57,541 --> 01:14:00,166
What is it, doctor?

769
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:01,875
Why can't I move?

770
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:03,291
My hand!

771
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:05,666
-My leg!
-No reaction, fascinating.

772
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:07,208
Eugénie!

773
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:09,500
-What's happening?
-Don't you see, Louise?

774
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:12,291
It's them!

775
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:15,208
You're what's happening to her!

776
01:14:16,041 --> 01:14:17,416
It's you!

777
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:20,875
You're doing it!
You're driving her mad!

778
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:22,083
Shut her up.

779
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,375
Oh, yes!

780
01:14:25,208 --> 01:14:26,791
Shut me up, doctor!

781
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:27,916
Ether.

782
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,583
Go on, shut me up!

783
01:14:31,291 --> 01:14:32,875
Because I know everything.

784
01:14:33,541 --> 01:14:34,958
I can tell you everything!

785
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:38,625
What you're doing to us...

786
01:14:58,125 --> 01:14:59,750
The Master is waiting for you.

787
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:08,750
You're too late, Miss Gleizes,
once again.

788
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:12,666
Forgive me, Master.
I was tending to my father.

789
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,541
Your father's not interned here.

790
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,708
Watch over my patients instead.

791
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:18,875
Of course.

792
01:15:19,916 --> 01:15:23,916
I just saw Louise. She's calmer.
I left her to rest.

793
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:26,000
Good.

794
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:29,208
We'll try magnet therapy next week.

795
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:31,041
And the others?

796
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:35,791
Denise Platel. Feeding herself
but still refuses to speak.

797
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:37,833
Aphasia. What treatment ?

798
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,083
Valerian and ether by uterine catheter.

799
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:42,500
One less dose of ether a day.

800
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:43,833
Is that all?

801
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:47,541
Not quite.

802
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:49,916
There's Eugénie Cléry.

803
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:52,291
-What are your plans?
-Isolation.

804
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:53,958
She's dangerous.

805
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:57,791
I don't want her to contaminate
the weaker ones.

806
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:03,333
Fine. I'll take care of it.

807
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:06,208
No, not you.
Jeanne.

808
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:09,458
<i>Jeanne will take care of it.</i>
<i>Tonight.</i>

809
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:20,125
Goodbye, Miss Gleizes.

810
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:21,541
Goodbye, Master.

811
01:16:53,958 --> 01:16:55,041
Follow me.

812
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:08,125
This is it.

813
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,791
The old Salpêtrière cells.

814
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:15,125
They're historic, Eugénie.

815
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,625
You're very lucky, you know.

816
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:45,125
Be calm.

817
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:50,125
Be calm. Everything will be fine.

818
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,375
You must breathe, Eugénie.

819
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:59,416
We're going to get on very well.

820
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:01,916
I'm going to keep an eye on you.

821
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:05,791
And when you get out,
you'll be a different woman.

822
01:18:07,333 --> 01:18:08,500
You'll see.

823
01:18:30,041 --> 01:18:31,166
Ms. Geneviève?

824
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:33,458
Yes, Louise?

825
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:40,000
When is my friend coming back?

826
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:42,458
I don't know.

827
01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:47,666
It's not right, Ms. Geneviève.

828
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:51,000
She's a lady.

829
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:52,458
A real lady.

830
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:57,125
We're treated worse than animals.

831
01:18:58,208 --> 01:18:59,208
Louise,

832
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:03,083
you must think about getting well.

833
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:10,708
Eugénie must be scared
down there alone.

834
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:53,750
Hello Adèle, how are we today?

835
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:56,250
I dreamt about you last night.

836
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:04,708
You were the Devil.

837
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:07,666
But I wasn't afraid.

838
01:22:08,916 --> 01:22:11,666
It was ugly, pathetic.

839
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:13,208
It was you.

840
01:22:13,833 --> 01:22:16,250
Because the Devil is in you, isn't he?

841
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,416
Vade retro satana!

842
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:30,166
Eugénie!

843
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,458
Do you know the eclipse game?

844
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:37,750
You'll love it!

845
01:22:59,666 --> 01:23:01,583
No! Not the light!

846
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:11,208
-When did it happen?
-Yesterday.

847
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:13,125
She hurt me.

848
01:23:13,291 --> 01:23:14,875
It's the third time this week.

849
01:23:21,833 --> 01:23:24,791
-Maybe I did something bad.
-No.

850
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,083
Time to eat.

851
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:52,208
Bon appétit.

852
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:13,166
It's Geneviève.

853
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:16,291
You were right about my father.

854
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:18,125
Blandine was right.

855
01:25:19,166 --> 01:25:20,541
I'm going to help you.

856
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:22,416
I'll be back, I promise.

857
01:25:48,791 --> 01:25:50,416
Speak. Who's there?

858
01:25:54,375 --> 01:25:55,875
What happened?

859
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:05,250
Please. Please...

860
01:26:08,208 --> 01:26:10,250
Stop that... Stop that.

861
01:26:10,625 --> 01:26:11,833
Stop!

862
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:25,708
How are you, Eugénie?

863
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:40,750
I don't think you're very well.

864
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:44,958
I've seen others like you,
who just give up.

865
01:26:45,916 --> 01:26:47,750
But I don't want you to.

866
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:50,666
You have to eat.

867
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:03,166
I bought these in rue Bruand.

868
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:04,833
Do you know it?

869
01:27:06,208 --> 01:27:07,166
No,

870
01:27:07,541 --> 01:27:08,958
of course you don't.

871
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,458
Want one?

872
01:27:25,416 --> 01:27:27,250
You're like your ghosts.

873
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:30,500
That's what they're like, isn't it?
Sad and pallid.

874
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,083
It'd be so much easier for you
if you didn't see them.

875
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:38,458
You poor thing.

876
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:43,625
I can help you.

877
01:27:55,166 --> 01:27:56,375
I think...

878
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:59,291
-I think...
-Well!

879
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:01,041
Yes!

880
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:03,333
It's good to think.

881
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,541
What do you think?

882
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:08,750
I think it's your mother.

883
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:15,083
Leave my mother alone,
and keep your games for the others.

884
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:17,375
Yes.

885
01:28:18,666 --> 01:28:20,083
She says she's your mother.

886
01:28:20,916 --> 01:28:23,458
She forgives you
for what you did to her.

887
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,375
What did you do to her?

888
01:28:37,458 --> 01:28:39,375
Did you lock her up in here?

889
01:28:40,958 --> 01:28:42,041
She was here.

890
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,416
You're saying nothing new.

891
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:47,708
Everyone knows my mother was mad.

892
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:49,333
So what?

893
01:28:54,791 --> 01:28:57,208
No-one knows what she did.

894
01:28:59,041 --> 01:29:00,500
To your son.

895
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:14,083
François?

896
01:29:16,125 --> 01:29:17,333
Is that right?

897
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:21,375
François!

898
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:29,500
She asks your forgiveness.

899
01:29:57,541 --> 01:29:59,208
You shut up!

900
01:30:00,041 --> 01:30:00,958
You shut up!

901
01:30:01,666 --> 01:30:03,583
You shut up, bitch!

902
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,291
You've no right!

903
01:30:07,416 --> 01:30:08,666
You've no right!

904
01:30:08,833 --> 01:30:11,583
You've no right to talk!

905
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:12,958
You witch!

906
01:31:05,291 --> 01:31:06,333
Ms. Jeanne!

907
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,083
There are fleas in my mattress,
I'm bleeding, look!

908
01:31:10,125 --> 01:31:11,958
-I can't see anything.
-Look!

909
01:31:12,125 --> 01:31:14,208
-There!
-I see nothing!

910
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:18,041
-Are you doing this to get ether?
-No, Ms. Jeanne.

911
01:31:18,208 --> 01:31:19,750
Go back to the others.

912
01:31:27,083 --> 01:31:30,125
If it takes all day, I guarantee

913
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:32,625
that I'll find that key!

914
01:31:32,791 --> 01:31:35,250
If you've anything to say, say it now!

915
01:31:35,416 --> 01:31:37,375
Are you sure you lost it here?

916
01:31:39,416 --> 01:31:40,583
Ms. Geneviève.

917
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:19,375
She's here.

918
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:22,500
Really?

919
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:29,083
She says she's happy
to speak to you.

920
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:34,708
She thanks you for the letters.

921
01:32:35,708 --> 01:32:37,875
But she wants you to stop.

922
01:32:41,083 --> 01:32:42,208
She wants

923
01:32:42,625 --> 01:32:44,708
you to be light...

924
01:32:45,958 --> 01:32:47,125
and happy.

925
01:32:49,416 --> 01:32:51,208
Your letters make her sad.

926
01:32:52,041 --> 01:32:54,791
She doesn't need them
to feel loved.

927
01:32:58,166 --> 01:32:59,458
She misses you.

928
01:33:04,583 --> 01:33:06,166
I miss her too.

929
01:33:07,458 --> 01:33:09,166
I miss her so much!

930
01:33:11,833 --> 01:33:13,458
She's no longer suffering.

931
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:17,000
She's not afraid.

932
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:24,041
She wants the same for you.
She's looking over you.

933
01:33:27,708 --> 01:33:29,958
She's in a woman's smile,

934
01:33:31,625 --> 01:33:33,541
a sick woman's laugh,

935
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:36,583
the hands that you nurse,

936
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,916
the eyes that you reassure.

937
01:33:42,916 --> 01:33:44,666
She's all around you.

938
01:33:46,333 --> 01:33:47,416
Everywhere.

939
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,416
She forgives you.

940
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:00,916
She's gone.

941
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:08,291
Thank you.

942
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:18,250
Thank you.

943
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:41,625
I see you found my key.

944
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:44,791
Give it to me.

945
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:49,875
Eugénie Cléry is weak and anemic.

946
01:34:50,666 --> 01:34:53,000
I'm going to tell Dr Charcot
immediately.

947
01:34:54,166 --> 01:34:55,625
I'm going to release her.

948
01:34:57,458 --> 01:35:00,416
Of course, Ms. Head Nurse.

949
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:02,583
Please go ahead.

950
01:35:07,708 --> 01:35:08,916
-Master?
-Yes?

951
01:35:09,083 --> 01:35:10,791
It's about Eugénie Cléry.

952
01:35:11,375 --> 01:35:14,583
She's been isolation for a month
and has made real progress.

953
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:16,125
-Only...
-What?

954
01:35:16,291 --> 01:35:18,875
She won't eat, doctor.
She's very weak.

955
01:35:19,333 --> 01:35:20,875
I fear she'll have a stroke.

956
01:35:21,041 --> 01:35:23,416
-Is she still hostile?
-No, she's calm.

957
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:28,458
She lacks the strength and the will.
She spoke rationally.

958
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:32,000
That's good.
Jeanne did the right thing.

959
01:35:32,708 --> 01:35:35,458
I'd like to return her to the ward.

960
01:35:36,458 --> 01:35:38,166
Isn't that a little premature?

961
01:35:38,333 --> 01:35:40,375
I'll take responsibility.

962
01:35:41,708 --> 01:35:45,250
I'm responsible for my patients,
Miss Gleizes.

963
01:35:45,416 --> 01:35:48,958
If there is any trouble,
I will blame you.

964
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:52,166
Tell Jeanne to transfer her.

965
01:35:52,333 --> 01:35:53,750
You won't regret it.

966
01:35:53,916 --> 01:35:54,750
Geneviève,

967
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:58,291
empty the chamber pots,
I can smell them from here.

968
01:36:00,125 --> 01:36:01,166
Yes, Master.

969
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:12,458
Paper! <i>Le Petit Parisien!</i>

970
01:36:19,666 --> 01:36:21,166
What a day!

971
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:30,083
Have a good evening, ladies.

972
01:36:38,916 --> 01:36:41,458
You're coming out tomorrow.
Wash yourself.

973
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:12,750
Open.

974
01:37:49,833 --> 01:37:51,041
Hello, Louise.

975
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:54,583
Eugénie!

976
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:56,166
It's you!

977
01:37:57,458 --> 01:37:58,958
It's nice to see you.

978
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:03,375
Was it hard in isolation?

979
01:38:04,166 --> 01:38:05,666
How are you?

980
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:07,333
Me?

981
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:09,333
That's a joke!

982
01:38:09,666 --> 01:38:11,916
My dress turns but I can't!

983
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:16,875
Unlucky.

984
01:38:58,166 --> 01:38:59,166
Keep going.

985
01:38:59,625 --> 01:39:00,541
That's it.

986
01:39:00,916 --> 01:39:02,541
Put that in reception.

987
01:39:02,708 --> 01:39:04,666
Julie, the plants,
that alcove, that one

988
01:39:04,833 --> 01:39:06,166
and that one.

989
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:10,708
Pascal, put the candlesticks upstairs
and at reception.

990
01:39:10,875 --> 01:39:13,625
Hello, gentlemen.
Head to the third floor balcony.

991
01:39:26,833 --> 01:39:30,208
Don't tussle.
Gently! Gently!

992
01:39:31,041 --> 01:39:32,833
-That's nice.
-Does it suit me?

993
01:39:37,708 --> 01:39:39,583
What a beautiful wig.

994
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:41,666
It's so soft!

995
01:39:44,666 --> 01:39:46,000
She has a horn!

996
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:52,875
Is that all right?

997
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:03,875
Don't touch that!
I haven't chosen my costume!

998
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:05,875
Go away!

999
01:40:09,791 --> 01:40:11,583
-Thérèse?
-Yes?

1000
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:13,708
Will you come to the ball?

1001
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:15,500
No, I never go.

1002
01:40:16,833 --> 01:40:18,875
It's my only night of peace.

1003
01:40:19,041 --> 01:40:21,875
I don't want to spend it
with those old crocs.

1004
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:23,750
Don't exaggerate!

1005
01:40:24,166 --> 01:40:27,500
-There are young men, too.
-They're all the same.

1006
01:40:27,666 --> 01:40:30,250
You'll see, Eugénie.
Well dressed or in rags,

1007
01:40:30,416 --> 01:40:33,916
in two hours you won't know
who's mad and who isn't.

1008
01:40:34,083 --> 01:40:35,333
I'm staying here.

1009
01:40:37,958 --> 01:40:40,708
Marguerite, calm down
or they won't let you go.

1010
01:41:01,625 --> 01:41:03,125
They're lovely.

1011
01:41:40,041 --> 01:41:41,916
-Your coat, sir?
-No, thank you.

1012
01:41:42,083 --> 01:41:43,375
Have a good evening.

1013
01:41:55,958 --> 01:41:57,333
Look, he's so handsome!

1014
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:02,208
In your place, Eugénie.

1015
01:42:06,625 --> 01:42:08,125
Good evening, Jeanne.

1016
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:09,458
Good evening, Master.

1017
01:42:38,208 --> 01:42:39,583
Ladies and gentlemen,

1018
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:41,750
good evening.

1019
01:42:42,333 --> 01:42:48,041
Welcome to the Salpêtrière Hospital
and to our annual ball.

1020
01:42:49,125 --> 01:42:51,041
The nurses, the doctors,

1021
01:42:51,208 --> 01:42:53,083
Dr Charcot and I

1022
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:55,666
are delighted and honored

1023
01:42:55,833 --> 01:42:57,916
to welcome you once again.

1024
01:42:58,583 --> 01:43:01,208
The women patients
you are about to see

1025
01:43:01,791 --> 01:43:04,291
are interesting in several ways.

1026
01:43:04,875 --> 01:43:06,250
Fascinating, even.

1027
01:43:06,583 --> 01:43:08,458
Some are psychotic,

1028
01:43:09,125 --> 01:43:10,791
others are compulsive liars.

1029
01:43:11,208 --> 01:43:13,166
maniacs, melancholics

1030
01:43:13,333 --> 01:43:14,583
or simply idiotic.

1031
01:43:14,958 --> 01:43:18,166
Their illnesses are often indiscernible

1032
01:43:18,916 --> 01:43:22,250
and could be missed
during a general medical examination.

1033
01:43:22,833 --> 01:43:25,583
But they are all real, diagnosed

1034
01:43:25,791 --> 01:43:27,708
and identified here

1035
01:43:27,875 --> 01:43:29,541
thanks to new methods

1036
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:31,416
in research and teaching.

1037
01:43:31,875 --> 01:43:33,750
But what unites them

1038
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:38,375
is that they are all patients of
the finest French scientist of our age.

1039
01:43:38,541 --> 01:43:39,791
I give you

1040
01:43:39,958 --> 01:43:42,083
Dr Jean-Martin

1041
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:43,458
Charcot!

1042
01:43:55,291 --> 01:43:59,250
Now I'd like you to welcome
our main attraction.

1043
01:43:59,416 --> 01:44:01,208
Ladies, over to you.

1044
01:45:52,375 --> 01:45:53,541
Goodbye, Jeanne.

1045
01:46:16,916 --> 01:46:18,958
Oh, thank you, thank you!

1046
01:46:19,916 --> 01:46:22,625
-I'm sorry, sister.
-It doesn't matter.

1047
01:46:23,041 --> 01:46:24,416
It doesn't matter.

1048
01:46:25,083 --> 01:46:27,250
-Sorry.
-Everything's fine.

1049
01:46:27,416 --> 01:46:29,208
Let me take off your make-up.

1050
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:04,958
What's this then? Here.

1051
01:47:05,125 --> 01:47:06,375
Want some?

1052
01:47:06,541 --> 01:47:07,750
Go ahead.

1053
01:47:07,916 --> 01:47:09,125
It's nice.

1054
01:47:11,833 --> 01:47:13,541
What are you?

1055
01:47:14,125 --> 01:47:15,500
A little gypsy.

1056
01:47:15,666 --> 01:47:17,541
It's good, isn't it?

1057
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:20,375
You're a little thief.

1058
01:47:21,458 --> 01:47:23,541
Let's see your hands.

1059
01:48:09,708 --> 01:48:11,208
What's the matter?

1060
01:48:11,791 --> 01:48:13,333
Tired from dancing?

1061
01:48:14,708 --> 01:48:16,083
You have to come.

1062
01:48:33,666 --> 01:48:34,916
Why are we here?

1063
01:48:36,833 --> 01:48:37,791
Jules!

1064
01:48:39,875 --> 01:48:41,458
Why have you brought me here?

1065
01:48:53,416 --> 01:48:54,750
So, my little kitty...

1066
01:48:55,875 --> 01:48:57,416
We're getting married tonight!

1067
01:48:58,458 --> 01:49:00,250
You're already my wife, aren't you?

1068
01:49:02,875 --> 01:49:03,833
Say it!

1069
01:49:04,166 --> 01:49:06,041
Say you're already my wife!

1070
01:49:06,958 --> 01:49:08,708
Wait...

1071
01:49:27,416 --> 01:49:28,875
Louise Plessis,

1072
01:49:29,041 --> 01:49:33,333
do you take Jules Lemoine

1073
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:36,041
as your lawfully wedded husband?

1074
01:49:36,208 --> 01:49:37,416
Not like this!

1075
01:49:37,583 --> 01:49:40,416
Come here, my love!
Give me your mouth!

1076
01:50:09,291 --> 01:50:11,291
-Eugénie Cléry!
-Let her go.

1077
01:50:11,458 --> 01:50:13,041
Let her go!

1078
01:50:13,541 --> 01:50:14,708
Help!

1079
01:50:15,208 --> 01:50:16,125
Help!

1080
01:50:19,083 --> 01:50:20,250
Be quiet.

1081
01:50:21,166 --> 01:50:22,166
Be quiet!

1082
01:50:22,333 --> 01:50:25,083
-Help!
-"Help, help!"

1083
01:50:28,625 --> 01:50:30,208
-Louis is waiting.
-Here?

1084
01:50:30,375 --> 01:50:31,583
No, in front.

1085
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,500
Get off!

1086
01:50:40,041 --> 01:50:41,208
You crook!

1087
01:50:42,166 --> 01:50:43,500
You beast!

1088
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,375
You bastard!

1089
01:51:12,458 --> 01:51:13,750
Help!

1090
01:51:16,208 --> 01:51:17,541
Get off me!

1091
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Stop! Help!

1092
01:51:22,208 --> 01:51:23,250
There they are!

1093
01:51:37,458 --> 01:51:38,416
Geneviève, no!

1094
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,458
-No, I won't leave you!
-Listen to me.

1095
01:51:43,083 --> 01:51:44,250
Go.

1096
01:51:44,541 --> 01:51:46,583
I'm free.

Hurry!

1098
01:51:51,375 --> 01:51:52,791
Stop them!

1099
01:52:06,333 --> 01:52:07,458
You're mad!

1100
01:52:09,125 --> 01:52:11,833
It's hard to know who's mad tonight,
Jeanne.

1101

<i>"My dear Geneviève.</i>

1102
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:36,750

1103
01:53:38,125 --> 01:53:40,166
<i>"Here freedom is beautiful,</i>

1104
01:53:40,333 --> 01:53:42,916
<i>"but it has a bitter taste:</i>
<i>that of your sacrifice.</i>

1105
01:53:45,041 --> 01:53:47,833
<i>"I try to honor you</i>

1106
01:53:48,208 --> 01:53:49,875
<i>"and, as you asked me,</i>

1107
01:53:50,458 --> 01:53:51,958
<i>to do good.</i>

1108
01:53:52,208 --> 01:53:56,041
<i>"I provide help, support, evidence</i>
<i>and comfort.</i>

1109
01:53:57,583 --> 01:54:01,041
<i>"The trust and love shown me</i>
<i>overwhelm me every day.</i>

1110
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:05,125
<i>"No-one here is scared of me.</i>

1111
01:54:05,791 --> 01:54:07,416
<i>"Here I am understood.</i>

1112
01:54:07,583 --> 01:54:08,875
For you.

1113

1115
01:54:24,625 --> 01:54:29,333
<i>"She is protecting you, she is with you</i>
<i>and she loves you, as do I.</i>

1116
01:54:30,916 --> 01:54:35,541
<i>"If your body is still there</i>
<i>in that ward I know so well,</i>

1117
01:54:36,125 --> 01:54:39,250
<i>"know that your heart</i>
<i>and spirit are here,</i>

1118
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:40,875
<i>"close to me.</i>

1119
01:54:42,166 --> 01:54:44,625
<i>"I imagine you sitting reading this.</i>

1120
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:47,166
<i>"But I won't let you finish.</i>

1121
01:54:48,083 --> 01:54:51,166
<i>"I take you... by the hand.</i>

1122
01:54:51,750 --> 01:54:53,458
<i>"We take a few steps.</i>

1123
01:54:54,083 --> 01:54:55,750
<i>"The wind is cool and salty.</i>

1124
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,041
<i>"The horizon is far. So far.</i>

1125
01:55:01,291 --> 01:55:02,958
<i>"Can you feel it?</i>

1126
01:55:04,750 --> 01:55:08,375
<i>"Our souls dance on the waves</i>
<i>and our pains fly away,</i>

1127
01:55:09,083 --> 01:55:12,625
<i>"swirling,</i>
<i>and vanish in a cloud of spray.</i>

1128
01:55:13,208 --> 01:55:14,500
<i>"We laugh.</i>

1129
01:55:14,791 --> 01:55:16,500
