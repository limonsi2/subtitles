00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,583
[in Xhosa] Who were you
talking to this morning?

169
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,041
[in Zulu] Someone from insurance.

170
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,208
[in Xhosa] Don't lie to me.
Insurance people so early in the morning?

171
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,083
[in Zulu] It's too early
to sell me insurance,

172
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,250
so I chased him out.

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,833
[in Xhosa] Really?

174
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:02,958
Mm-hmm.

175
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,416
- [in English] Okay.
- Mmm.

176
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,666
[in Zulu] It's Paka's bath time.
Then we can have some fun.

177
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,125
[in Xhosa] Stop it!

178
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,375

Tiger, that wasn't the deal.

You told me this guy was harmless.
He killed one of my people.

- That's impossible.

Tiger just debriefed me.
We now have a dead John Doe on our hands.

How'd you miss Klein leaving Vlottenburg?

Naledi was on point.

200
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,958
We had to be discreet, ma'am.
We only had time for a single drone pass

201
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,000
after the rental company finally sent

Do you understand what is at stake, Mo?

- Hmm?
- Yes, sir.

There is but one man standing

That's ample time, wouldn't you say?

So why is he still running

You need to leave now.

We were wrong to leave it to the courts.

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,250
and a day hasn't passed.

650
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,375
[sighs heavily]

651
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:43,958
[in Tswana] Johnny visited Thandi Makeba.

652
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:48,125
You knew?

653
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,125
[in English] Suspected.

654
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:07,333
[in Xhosa] She has dirt on her hands,

655
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:09,833
filthied by illegal miners.

656
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:13,166
She must've thought
she was helping herself up,

657
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,791
but she was hanging herself on a noose.

658
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,300
[English] That's why
she didn't come after us.

659
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:22,250
[in Xhosa] Cut out her tongue, Mo.

660
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:26,833
The real test, however,
is if you can leverage this...

661
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,791
[in English]...to unearth Johnny's scheme.

662
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:31,208
But most importantly,

663
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:34,375
silence his errand boy.

664
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:46,708
Mo!

665
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:50,666
[in Xhosa] Come.

666
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:11,000
- [in English] Daza, what the hell is this?
- I think you know exactly what it is, Mo.

667
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:13,875
Mmm?

668
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,458
[in Xhosa] Just imagine...

669
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:21,291
if the entire nation knew
that your father...

670
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:24,083
[in English] was in bed
with the apartheid regime.

671
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,666
[in Xhosa] What would they say?

672
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:27,791
[chuckles]

673
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:38,875
Ah.

674
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:41,375
And so they say...

675
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,583
[in English] "The apple does not fall
too far from the tree."

676
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:47,083
Or does it, Mo? Mmm?

677
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,000
So it appears...

678
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,125
[in Xhosa] that your hands

679
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:53,958
are also dirty.

680
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:57,791
[in English] And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

681
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:06,458
[in Xhosa] Time waits for no one, Mo.

682
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:08,458
[in English] Tick-tock.

683
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:12,041
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

684
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:15,625
Tick-tock. Tick-fucking-tock, Mo!

[in English] Good one, Neville.
Can you chat?

690
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:36,333
What could an old has-been like you
learn from a pencil pusher like myself?

[Mike] <i>Yeah, right. Pencil pusher.</i>

[Neville] <i>Yeah.</i>

695
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,291
What the hell is a guy
from a private security company

called "Ingwe" doing there?

Strange things are happening, all right?

Shortly after the Klein suicide,

[in English] Uh, keep me
in the loop, yeah?

Sure. Hey, and Mike?

707
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:17,875

Long enough for me
to no longer go by that name.

717
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,083
I'm inside the PIA.
