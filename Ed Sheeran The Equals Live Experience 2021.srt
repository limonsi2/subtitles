211
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:32,098
- I think the end process for every album

212
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:34,015
is always the toughest.

213
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:40,928
Finding the last possible
drop of songs to go into it.

214
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:50,594
I usually would play it to
sort of hundreds of people

215
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:51,839
before the album came out,

216
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,976
but probably six people
were in the process

217
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,393
of whittling down this album.

218
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:01,156
I think this is the best
record I've ever made

219
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:05,239

in front of an audience.

Thank you very much, thanks.

296
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:39,924
So thank you very much for coming,

297
00:20:39,924 --> 00:20:43,061
this was meant to be the
week of the album release,

298
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:44,743
but obviously I got COVID
so I couldn't do it.

299
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,860
So I'm very, very happy
that we're able to do this

300
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,693
and it looks absolutely beautiful.

301
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,839
So basically in this show,
at the beginning of the show,

302
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,044
I played three songs
from old albums up there,

303
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:01,244
that are kind of prerecorded.

304
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:02,322
And then it kinda segues into this,

305
00:21:02,322 --> 00:21:03,820
which is all the songs from the new album.

306
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,844
And a lot of these songs,

307
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:06,060
I haven't really played live before.

308
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,720
I'm playing "Two-step" later,

309
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,881
which actually I rehearsed
for the first time,

310
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:12,631
for the first time, about an hour ago.

311
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:15,589
So we'll see how that goes.

312
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:16,631
And if I mess up, then,

313
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:19,548
we'll just do it again and edit it.

314
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:26,265
So this album I basically made
over the course of four years

315
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:29,090
and it was a long process,

316
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,107
but I really feel like the
first song that was completed

317
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:32,791
for the album was this next song,

318
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,041
which I wrote in Nashville.

319
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:38,450
While I was making, it was kind of,

320
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,452
I didn't really intend

321
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:41,754
on making number six
collaborations project.

322
00:21:41,754 --> 00:21:44,609
It kind of just happened by
accident whilst making Equals.

323
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,412
'Cause I was just sort of
making songs for Equals

324
00:21:46,412 --> 00:21:49,115
and then every now and then making,

325
00:21:49,115 --> 00:21:50,631
something that sounded
like beautiful people

326
00:21:50,631 --> 00:21:52,050
or antisocial or whatever.

327
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,247
And I was like, well,
this doesn't really fit.

328
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:56,508
It sort of turned into number six.

329
00:21:56,508 --> 00:22:00,245
But so this is a song that
I wrote around that time,

330
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:04,011
that I feel like has become
a fan favorite on the album.

331
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:08,511
And it's called "First

I always find like I overly
complicate things for myself

372
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:26,225
while writing songs sometimes,

373
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,746
'cause "First Times" and "Perfect",

374
00:25:28,746 --> 00:25:30,480
no choruses are the same,

375
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,903
they're different words every single time.

376
00:25:31,903 --> 00:25:32,986
So when I was singing,
"First Times" there,

377
00:25:32,986 --> 00:25:35,045
I was going (beep).

378
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:37,167
(audience laughs)

379
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:38,826
Just trying to get all the
lyrics in the right place.

380
00:25:38,826 --> 00:25:39,770
'Cause you know, when
you were kind of playing

381
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,370
in front of people that do know the songs

382
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,767
and they're like...

383
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:46,490
(audience laughing)

384
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,323
This is great.

385
00:25:47,323 --> 00:25:48,750
I've missed gigs so much.

386
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,027
I've missed being able
to play people so much.

387
00:25:50,027 --> 00:25:50,892
(crowd cheering)

388
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:51,975
So thank you.

389
00:25:57,636 --> 00:26:00,212
So this album is a kind of
quote, unquote, a lockdown album.

390
00:26:00,212 --> 00:26:04,129
'Cause it was pretty much
finished in lockdown.

391
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,538
The main guy that I've worked
with pretty much all my career

392
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:08,521
is a guy called Johnny McDaid,

393
00:26:08,521 --> 00:26:10,335
who, I've done songs like, "Shape of You",

394
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,866
or "Photograph", or like
half this record, basically,

395
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,066
"Bad Habits".

396
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:16,730
And when lockdown hit,

397
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,928
we didn't really know what was going on.

398
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:22,128
So we were still keeping in
touch, and then he was like,

399
00:26:22,128 --> 00:26:24,866
"Why don't I move next door to you?

400
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:27,085
And like for quarantine for a while.

401
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,409
And then once I've quarantine,

402
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:30,488
I can just move in and then
we can just create music."

403
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,010
And I was like, cool,
sounds like a good idea.

404
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,570
So he moved in and then we'd
sort of wave at each other

405
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,804
and whatnot.

406
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:37,050
And then when his
quarantine, had finished,

407
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,548
we started creating
music and this next song,

408
00:26:39,548 --> 00:26:42,925
it was pretty much the first
song we wrote that week.

409
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:45,361
This was like May 2020.

410
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:48,164
So may last year it started off originally

411
00:26:48,164 --> 00:26:51,112
like a power ballad and
it was a bit more slow

412
00:26:51,112 --> 00:26:54,133
and it sped up now and
I kind of like both,

413
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:55,474
kind of like both,

414
00:26:55,474 --> 00:26:57,955
but I'm gonna play it sort
of like halfway between both.

415
00:26:57,955 --> 00:27:00,955

Thank you.

462
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:16,508
I'm gonna call Ashton Miranda on stage,

463
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:20,800
he's a very good friend
of mine and piano player.

464
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,633
Me and Ashton I've been playing together

465
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:22,908
for seven years now.

466
00:31:22,908 --> 00:31:25,089
And I sometimes when I play certain songs,

467
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,802
feel very alone on stage

468
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,028
'cause we play them together so much.

469
00:31:28,028 --> 00:31:30,630
So it's so nice to have him here for this.

470
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,003
Thank you for coming.

471
00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:34,705
Ashton, I'm gonna throw a
curve ball in after this,

472
00:31:34,705 --> 00:31:37,329
Ashton loves to rehearse
and we're gonna play

473
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,109
a song that we haven't rehearsed.

474
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:40,694
(crowd laughs)

475
00:31:40,694 --> 00:31:42,647
After this one, though.

476
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:44,050
It's gonna be fun. It's gonna be fun.

477
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,786
I'm gonna leave you guessing
which one it is though.

478
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:49,305
So this next song we're gonna
play, is "Leave Your Life",

479
00:31:49,305 --> 00:31:50,305
by the way.

480
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:55,186
This next song I'm gonna play,

481
00:31:55,186 --> 00:31:59,436
I feel like the story around
it, is personal to me,

482
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:02,983
but I feel like now the song has come out.

483
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:05,463
I feel like the song
belongs to so many people

484
00:32:05,463 --> 00:32:08,296
in so many other people's stories.

485
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:12,039
Instead of telling you
the story around the song,

486
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:15,181
I want to explain what the
song means to me now it's out.

487
00:32:15,181 --> 00:32:17,348
And, I wrote this song in,

488
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:21,129
I'd never really experienced grief before,

489
00:32:21,129 --> 00:32:24,503
I had my grandparents die and
I feel like your grandparents,

490
00:32:24,503 --> 00:32:25,442
when you were at school,

491
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:27,682
everyone's grandparents died
and it's just a normal thing

492
00:32:27,682 --> 00:32:29,202
that people get old and they pass away.

493
00:32:29,202 --> 00:32:30,381
And although it's very, very sad.

494
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,703
That is just part of life.

495
00:32:31,703 --> 00:32:34,141
But I had a friend pass away last year

496
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:36,242
and it was the first time I'd
ever had anyone close to me

497
00:32:36,242 --> 00:32:37,992
just like that gone.

498
00:32:39,196 --> 00:32:41,197
I had conversations with
him every other day.

499
00:32:41,197 --> 00:32:42,519
And then those conversations just stopped.

500
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:46,418
So the song I wrote it,
trying to process it,

501
00:32:46,418 --> 00:32:48,514
which I feel it helped.

502
00:32:48,514 --> 00:32:49,516
I feel it definitely helped.

503
00:32:49,516 --> 00:32:51,677
And I feel like the grief
is such a solitary thing

504
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:53,245
that I was very much solitary.

505
00:32:53,245 --> 00:32:54,241
I don't wanna speak to anyone.

506
00:32:54,241 --> 00:32:56,392
I'm gonna write, write,
write, write, write,

507
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,754
and then I don't wanna
talk to anyone about it.

508
00:32:58,754 --> 00:33:00,206
'Cause if I talked to anyone
about it, I'll just cry.

509
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:02,725
And then when the song came out,

510
00:33:02,725 --> 00:33:06,552
suddenly like the solitary nature of grief

511
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:09,352
became very public and it felt very bare.

512
00:33:09,352 --> 00:33:12,132
And I felt weird about it,
before the song came out,

513
00:33:12,132 --> 00:33:13,310
I rung up his family and made sure

514
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,533
that they were okay with it.

515
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:15,853
And we went through the
artwork and the mixes

516
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:16,952
and all of that stuff.

517
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:17,954
And then when the song came out,

518
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,034
I suddenly realized that
there was a whole world

519
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:21,752
of people feeling exactly the same way

520
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:25,111
and the song allowed
itself to be this thing

521
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:28,944
that basically gave a
voice to solitary grief.

522
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:33,576
And I've met so many people
since the song have come out

523
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:34,826
and people who,

524
00:33:35,903 --> 00:33:37,853
I met a boy the other day
whose mother had passed away

525
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:39,667
and he was like, "This is
the way that I communicated

526
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:42,232
with my father as I send him the song.

527
00:33:42,232 --> 00:33:44,034
And he knows exactly what
I mean without me having

528
00:33:44,034 --> 00:33:45,234
to say anything.

529
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:46,232
And I can send that song."

530
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,393
And I found that going
on, the YouTube comments

531
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,776
for this song made it all make sense

532
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:52,532
because when you write a song like this,

533
00:33:52,532 --> 00:33:53,835
it's very personal.

534
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:55,314
You go, ooh, I don't
want anyone to hear this.

535
00:33:55,314 --> 00:33:56,317
And then when it comes out,

536
00:33:56,317 --> 00:34:00,114
you realize that music
is a universal language

537
00:34:00,114 --> 00:34:01,394
and it helps people communicate.

538
00:34:01,394 --> 00:34:03,597
I find it, sometimes I send
songs to my wife and be like,

539
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:06,455
oh, this made me think of
you or this is our song.

540
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:07,586
Or this is that.

541
00:34:07,586 --> 00:34:11,896
And I find that out of
a really sad situation,

542
00:34:11,896 --> 00:34:14,973
something positive has
happened with this song.

543
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:16,991
And I'm really, really grateful
that people have connected

544
00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:18,893
to it in the way that they have.

545
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:20,674
This is "Visiting Hours".

546
00:34:20,674 --> 00:34:23,424

Thank you.

581
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:36,338
So, as I said, I was gonna throw
a curve ball, Ashton's way.

582
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:38,512
We've actually played this
song before for just once.

583
00:37:38,512 --> 00:37:41,832
And this song was actually meant
to be in the setlist today.

584
00:37:41,832 --> 00:37:43,656
And the reason I feel weird
about not putting this one

585
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:45,474
in this set is 'cause it
kind of goes hand in hand

586
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:47,294
with "Visiting Hours".

587
00:37:47,294 --> 00:37:50,627
The story behind the song is I got sent,

588
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:55,559
we were finishing the album
and someone came up with

589
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:57,016
this bright idea of like,

590
00:37:57,016 --> 00:38:01,757
"Hey, because you made most
of your last record in Sweden,

591
00:38:01,757 --> 00:38:03,858
we should send you to
Sweden to finish the album."

592
00:38:03,858 --> 00:38:04,856
And I was like, cool.

593
00:38:04,856 --> 00:38:08,280
And they were like, "But this
is the idea, you fly to Sweden

594
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,898
without your baby and you land.

595
00:38:10,898 --> 00:38:12,461
And then you write about
how miserable you are."

596
00:38:12,461 --> 00:38:14,039
(crowd laughs)

597
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,039
I was like, ah, that's a bit cruel.

598
00:38:23,036 --> 00:38:26,879
I basically said in my head,
I was like, do you know what?

599
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:29,543
I can write a song about missing my child

600
00:38:29,543 --> 00:38:32,322
without actually leaving
the same room as them.

601
00:38:32,322 --> 00:38:33,678
And I'll show you basically.

602
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,421
So I had this idea that I was
gonna do this song anyway.

603
00:38:35,421 --> 00:38:38,541
And then my friend Michael
passed away and I flew

604
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:41,485
to Australia with my child
and we were in quarantine

605
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,482
for two weeks.

606
00:38:42,482 --> 00:38:46,802
And basically I just
had this melody running

607
00:38:46,802 --> 00:38:48,263
around my head every time I took a shower,

608
00:38:48,263 --> 00:38:50,099
melody's come into showers by the way,

609
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,964
'cause shower sound great to sing in.

610
00:38:51,964 --> 00:38:52,797
So I'm there going.

611
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,880
(Ed Sheeran humming)

612
00:38:57,113 --> 00:38:59,807
So I had this melody
for "Leave Your Life",

613
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:01,710
but I didn't really know
what I was gonna write about.

614
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,913
Like, do I write about
just leaving my child

615
00:39:03,913 --> 00:39:05,065
and flying somewhere?

616
00:39:05,065 --> 00:39:08,414
If it felt a bit like not genuine.

617
00:39:08,414 --> 00:39:13,134
And then Michael's funeral
happened and I was in quarantine

618
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:15,052
for the funeral and we
watched it over Zoom.

619
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:19,135
And I spoke to a member
of his family afterwards,

620
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,550
who said that basically
after every conversation,

621
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,263
he would end it with, I love you.

622
00:39:27,263 --> 00:39:30,705
And no matter what, no matter
what every single conversation

623
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:31,808
ended with, I love you.

624
00:39:31,808 --> 00:39:33,651
So the last thing he said
to everyone that he knew

625
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:34,649
was I love you.

626
00:39:34,649 --> 00:39:36,588
And I thought that that
was such an amazing thing

627
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:38,784
to kind of take in to life.

628
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:41,187
And so I started doing it
with people in my family,

629
00:39:41,187 --> 00:39:42,526
but I can't do it with my daughter

630
00:39:42,526 --> 00:39:45,267
'cause she's 15 months now
and she was six months then.

631
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:49,326
And I felt like, even
though if I went tomorrow

632
00:39:49,326 --> 00:39:50,649
and was not here on this planet,

633
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:53,449
even though she would
know that I did love her,

634
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:54,463
'cause people would tell her,

635
00:39:54,463 --> 00:39:56,867
she would never actually know
it from the horses mouth,

636
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:57,870
if that makes sense.

637
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,369
So I wrote this song basically as that,

638
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:03,952
if anything happened and it's
called "Leave Your Life".

(crowd applauds)

691
00:43:39,046 --> 00:43:42,296
Round of applause for Ashton, everyone.

692
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:48,998
I was just telling them to
give you a round of applause.

693
00:43:48,998 --> 00:43:52,603
'Cause you know (indistinct).

694
00:43:52,603 --> 00:43:55,664
So those songs kind of go hand-in-hand.

695
00:43:55,664 --> 00:43:58,806
Weirdly, this next song goes
hand-in-hand with "Bad Habits"

696
00:43:58,806 --> 00:44:01,003
and they could not be further apart.

697
00:44:01,003 --> 00:44:03,403
They were written on the same
day and this one kind of came

698
00:44:03,403 --> 00:44:07,031
as a sort of knee jerk reactions about,

699
00:44:07,031 --> 00:44:09,280
you make a song like
"Bad Habits" and it's...

700
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,880
(Ed Sheeran humming)

701
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,077
And you go, all right, let's
try something quiet and slow.

702
00:44:14,077 --> 00:44:17,360
And this song was written in
such a short period of time.

703
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,339
That for a long time, I
thought it was (beep),

704
00:44:19,339 --> 00:44:22,240
'cause, it was written in
such a short period of time.

705
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,265
And I kept listening to me like,

706
00:44:23,265 --> 00:44:24,956
oh, that's not any good.

707
00:44:24,956 --> 00:44:28,683
And then my brother did a
string arrangement for it,

708
00:44:28,683 --> 00:44:30,422
that basically brought out of its shell.

709
00:44:30,422 --> 00:44:34,469
And it's turned it into this
big cinematic orchestral thing

710
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:36,577
that I love, that I love.

711
00:44:36,577 --> 00:44:39,577
And yeah, I hope it lives on forever

712
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,258
and we're gonna play it now.

713
00:44:43,258 --> 00:44:45,696
It's called "Joker And The Queen".

714
00:44:45,696 --> 00:44:47,860

Everyone give it up for Ashton.

746
00:47:52,376 --> 00:47:54,059
Well, now we're entering
into the interesting part

747
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:56,358
of the gig, 'cause this is the
song that I wasn't intending

748
00:47:56,358 --> 00:47:57,355
on playing today

749
00:47:57,355 --> 00:47:59,915
'cause I hadn't rehearsed
it once ever, ever.

750
00:47:59,915 --> 00:48:02,139
And it's a loop pedal song,
and it's quite intricate.

751
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:04,795
And if it's not on time,
it will sound (beep),

752
00:48:04,795 --> 00:48:06,875
but I've rehearsed it for a little bit.

753
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:09,556
And the beauty of this is
if it doesn't sound good,

754
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:10,817
it just won't make the show.

755
00:48:10,817 --> 00:48:13,234
So your part of this tonight,

756
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:16,188
this is the first time I've ever,

757
00:48:16,188 --> 00:48:17,849
ever, ever, ever played it.

758
00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:20,599
(crowd applauds)

759
00:48:21,871 --> 00:48:24,449
I hope it goes well. I hope it goes well.

760
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:28,292
This was the final song that
I finished for the record.

761
00:48:28,292 --> 00:48:31,987
And this came, in a stage when
the album's being finished,

762
00:48:31,987 --> 00:48:33,428
this is how "Shape of You" came about,

763
00:48:33,428 --> 00:48:35,823
is basically like the album's done.

764
00:48:35,823 --> 00:48:38,308
And then everyone goes, right it's done.

765
00:48:38,308 --> 00:48:40,002
And then there's just this
little prodding finger

766
00:48:40,002 --> 00:48:41,924
from everywhere.

767
00:48:41,924 --> 00:48:46,104
My manager, Stuart is the most
genius person in the world

768
00:48:46,104 --> 00:48:50,544
because he knows that
there's something good in

769
00:48:50,544 --> 00:48:52,425
when you feel like a record's
finished and you just go in

770
00:48:52,425 --> 00:48:54,505
and create whatever you want.

771
00:48:54,505 --> 00:48:55,811
And that's where "Don't" in "Sing" came

772
00:48:55,811 --> 00:49:00,291
and it's where a "Shape
of You" and what came in?

773
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:01,933
"Shape of You"" and "Eraser" came

774
00:49:01,933 --> 00:49:04,592
and it's where "Bad
Habits" and "2step" came.

775
00:49:04,592 --> 00:49:08,575
And this song basically came at my last,

776
00:49:08,575 --> 00:49:11,467
I was on my last legs with
writing for this album.

777
00:49:11,467 --> 00:49:12,827
And I was like, it's totally done.

778
00:49:12,827 --> 00:49:14,801
I'd actually gone to Los
Angeles to promote the album.

779
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:18,047
I was doing all the voice
stuff and stuff like that.

780
00:49:18,047 --> 00:49:21,408
And I went in for a sort of
like site session of this guy

781
00:49:21,408 --> 00:49:23,445
who I'd been friends with
for a very long time.

782
00:49:23,445 --> 00:49:24,528
And we hadn't really worked together

783
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:25,525
because we'd been friends.

784
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:26,528
And I just was like,

785
00:49:26,528 --> 00:49:28,005
let's just go in and see what we create.

786
00:49:28,005 --> 00:49:29,008
This song came out.

787
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,584
It's still my favorite song on the album.

788
00:49:31,584 --> 00:49:33,662
And I hope I don't butcher
it today because of that.

789
00:49:33,662 --> 00:49:38,579
I've just shot a music video
for it in Kiev, which is cool.

790
00:49:39,888 --> 00:49:42,468
We did it in Kiev 'cause we
could shut down an entire part

791
00:49:42,468 --> 00:49:43,467
of the city.

792
00:49:43,467 --> 00:49:47,627
And we had like 250 dancers
and it looks pretty stunning,

793
00:49:47,627 --> 00:49:49,544
but it was minus three.

794
00:49:52,308 --> 00:49:53,685
All right, here we go.

795
00:49:53,685 --> 00:49:55,525
If I mess this up, I'm gonna
have to do it a few more times,

796
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:56,728
but I'll probably get it first time.

797
00:49:56,728 --> 00:49:57,645
Here we go.

798
00:50:05,654 --> 00:50:08,654

Thank you.

870
00:54:12,183 --> 00:54:14,980
As a first time, I don't
think it went too badly.

871
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,343
(crowd cheering)

872
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,980
There was room for improvement.

873
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,639
There's room for improvement.

874
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:23,999
Now, something else that
I've never played before.

875
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,863
(crowd applauds)

876
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:29,082
I wrote a Christmas song,

877
00:54:29,082 --> 00:54:32,454
which my manager always said that he quit

878
00:54:32,454 --> 00:54:35,037
if ever I did a Christmas song.

879
00:54:36,138 --> 00:54:38,305
This basically came about.

880
00:54:39,399 --> 00:54:43,416
So Elton John is someone that
has been an integral part

881
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:46,099
of my career from the
very, very beginning.

882
00:54:46,099 --> 00:54:47,972
When I first signed to my now manager,

883
00:54:47,972 --> 00:54:49,838
he was on Rocket management.

884
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,278
And so Elton was essentially a
mentor and he used to call me

885
00:54:53,278 --> 00:54:55,779
maybe like once every few
months just being like,

886
00:54:55,779 --> 00:54:57,171
how's it going?

887
00:54:57,171 --> 00:54:59,616
And what can we improve on?

888
00:54:59,616 --> 00:55:00,736
You're not getting played on US radio.

889
00:55:00,736 --> 00:55:03,113
Let me sort that out. I
could do a few phone calls.

890
00:55:03,113 --> 00:55:04,558
You've been nominated for Grammy,

891
00:55:04,558 --> 00:55:05,574
but you can't play the Grammy's.

892
00:55:05,574 --> 00:55:06,775
Why don't I play it with you?

893
00:55:06,775 --> 00:55:08,536
He'd basically just be this mentor

894
00:55:08,536 --> 00:55:09,733
that would just always help me out.

895
00:55:09,733 --> 00:55:12,872
And then as my career progressed and got,

896
00:55:12,872 --> 00:55:14,254
I had more and more success,

897
00:55:14,254 --> 00:55:16,472
I sort of started hanging
out with him more and more

898
00:55:16,472 --> 00:55:20,082
and more and he became
from a mentor to a friend,

899
00:55:20,082 --> 00:55:23,665
and then he just started ringing me a lot.

900
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:26,135
He has an iPad. I have an iPad.

901
00:55:26,135 --> 00:55:28,898
So we're both not phone
people, which is quite good.

902
00:55:28,898 --> 00:55:30,519
I feel like he might be
the only person on my iPad

903
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:32,295
that I call.

904
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:33,938
And I might be the only
person on his iPad that he...

905
00:55:33,938 --> 00:55:36,098
'Cause we literally
speak every single day.

906
00:55:36,098 --> 00:55:40,068
But this happened right
after I became a father.

907
00:55:40,068 --> 00:55:41,474
He just started ringing me all the time,

908
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:43,373
just to check how I was doing.

909
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:45,229
He loved seeing my little
daughter on FaceTime

910
00:55:45,229 --> 00:55:46,253
would chat to his kids.

911
00:55:46,253 --> 00:55:47,227
He loves football. I love football.

912
00:55:47,227 --> 00:55:49,144
His kids like Pokemon. I like Pokemon.

913
00:55:49,144 --> 00:55:51,624
There's a lot of stuff that goes in there.

914
00:55:51,624 --> 00:55:54,344
And he wrote me on Christmas
day, last year to say,

915
00:55:54,344 --> 00:55:57,443
"Merry Christmas, you having a good day?

916
00:55:57,443 --> 00:55:58,902
We should do a Christmas song."

917
00:55:58,902 --> 00:56:00,787
(crowd applauds)

918
00:56:00,787 --> 00:56:03,438
And so two things went
through my head at that point.

919
00:56:03,438 --> 00:56:05,907
One is, God I've gotta do
a song with Elton John.

920
00:56:05,907 --> 00:56:06,909
That's gonna be cool.

921
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:10,419
And then the second thing was
like, Stuart's gonna say no.

922
00:56:10,419 --> 00:56:12,968
So I kind of like
tempered it a little bit.

923
00:56:12,968 --> 00:56:13,989
And was just like,

924
00:56:13,989 --> 00:56:15,192
I don't know if I wanna
do a Christmas song.

925
00:56:15,192 --> 00:56:18,826
But if we do do one,
maybe 2022, maybe 2023,

926
00:56:18,826 --> 00:56:20,488
like something like that.

927
00:56:20,488 --> 00:56:23,731
And then the thing in March happened

928
00:56:23,731 --> 00:56:25,448
where my friend passed away.

929
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:26,930
And instantly from that point,

930
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:30,787
I was just like, why am
I waiting to do anything?

931
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,567
Life is about doing everything now.

932
00:56:33,567 --> 00:56:35,608
It's about grabbing life by the balls

933
00:56:35,608 --> 00:56:38,207
and just having fun with
things and not worrying about

934
00:56:38,207 --> 00:56:40,548
whether it's cool or not
to do a Christmas song.

935
00:56:40,548 --> 00:56:42,807
'Cause I think doing a song
with Elton John in general

936
00:56:42,807 --> 00:56:44,057
is pretty cool.

937
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:49,268
And he was sort of ringing me
throughout that whole process.

938
00:56:49,268 --> 00:56:50,367
And so I was like, when I get back,

939
00:56:50,367 --> 00:56:52,408
I'll come up to Windsor,

940
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:54,986
we'll eat some food and we
write some Christmas songs.

941
00:56:54,986 --> 00:56:58,346
And so I went up to Windsor
and we finished three songs,

942
00:56:58,346 --> 00:57:00,607
one of which, well we were
gonna release all three,

943
00:57:00,607 --> 00:57:01,924
this Christmas, but we thought,

944
00:57:01,924 --> 00:57:03,360
like let's stagger it a bit.

945
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,728
So there's one coming out next Christmas,

946
00:57:05,728 --> 00:57:06,588
called, "Pull My Christmas Cracker,

947
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:09,005
You'll Get More Than A Bang".

948
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:14,308
And it's innuendo heavy, but
we've finished this song.

949
00:57:14,308 --> 00:57:16,885
This is song the
basically after he rung me

950
00:57:16,885 --> 00:57:18,991
on Christmas day, I was like,

951
00:57:18,991 --> 00:57:21,311
well, I don't know what a Christmas song

952
00:57:21,311 --> 00:57:22,684
of mine sounds like.

953
00:57:22,684 --> 00:57:25,407
Let me think if I can think
of a chorus because you know,

954
00:57:25,407 --> 00:57:27,007
it is Christmas.

955
00:57:27,007 --> 00:57:28,590
So now is the time to feel Christmasy.

956
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:29,423
So I came up with a...

957
00:57:29,423 --> 00:57:31,131
♪ Just kiss me under the mistletoe ♪

958
00:57:31,131 --> 00:57:32,607
♪ Open the wine ♪

959
00:57:32,607 --> 00:57:35,265
And I put it on a voice note and I just,

960
00:57:35,265 --> 00:57:39,682
actually it says, Merry Xmas (beep).

961
00:57:40,646 --> 00:57:42,368
I sent it to Elton.

962
00:57:42,368 --> 00:57:44,288
And so we just had this
thing and then we finished it

963
00:57:44,288 --> 00:57:46,251
and, "You not gonna put
that in them," I said, no.

964
00:57:46,251 --> 00:57:49,283
(crowd laughs)

965
00:57:49,283 --> 00:57:51,094
So basically I wrote
the chorus Christmas day

966
00:57:51,094 --> 00:57:53,287
after Elton rung me and then
we finished it in Windsor.

967
00:57:53,287 --> 00:57:55,570
And then we shot a music video recently,

968
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:58,625
which parodies all the
great British music videos,

969
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:02,042
such as East 17, Shakin' Stevens, Wizard.

970
00:58:03,927 --> 00:58:05,327
I'm gonna get to playing this song.

971
00:58:05,327 --> 00:58:07,660
And Ashton is back, the man.

972
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:11,367
So this is called, "Merry Christmas".

973
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:12,370
And I hope you like it.

974
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:14,946
By the way, and this is a 100%
true because I've said this

975
00:58:14,946 --> 00:58:16,269
to loads of people and they'd be like,

976
00:58:16,269 --> 00:58:17,570
"No, that's not true".

977
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:20,786
There's no other song called
Merry Christmas. There's none.

978
00:58:20,786 --> 00:58:22,546
It's Happy X, Miss Mary X, Miss,

979
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:23,890
I'm telling you, look it up.

980
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:27,502
It feels like a glitch in the matrix.

981
00:58:27,502 --> 00:58:29,752
So anyway, Merry Christmas.

982
00:58:30,864 --> 00:58:33,614

983
00:58:35,533 --> 00:58:36,450
