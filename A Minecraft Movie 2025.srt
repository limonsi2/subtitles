Garrett, The Garbage Man, to

191
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,958
what do we owe this pleasure?

192
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:28,666
Pleasure?

193
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:29,833
I think I come to

194
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,916
storage auctions for fun.

195
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,125
I'm a businessman, Darrell, an investor.

196
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,333
Well, I'm about to shovel some coal into

197
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,375
your choo-choo trade.

198
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,208
You're gonna love this next unit.

199
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,333
It's got a water bin.

200
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,750
It's got some pickaxes.

201
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,041
It's got a huge can of mixed nuts.

202
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,000
It's got an array of

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,208
unisex turquoise blouses.

204
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:52,625
That sounds terrible.

205
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:53,875
I think it's also got

206
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,958
a 1978 Atari Cosmos.

207
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,458
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

208
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,541
1978 Atari Cosmos.

209
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,541
That's why to say, those things are worth

210
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,333
the frickin' fortune.

211
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:03,541
Heck yeah, they are.

212
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,500
Bro, if you make this happen for me, I

213
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,541
will strongly consider

214
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,708
hanging out with you.

215
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:09,958
You serious, bro?

216
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:10,583
Yep.

217
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,333
Two big buffaloes like

218
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,041
us out there in the wild.

219
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,875
We're in unisex turquoise blouses.

220
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,583
Oh, boy, that's gonna cause a commotion.

221
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:22,333
The ladies aren't

222
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,541
gonna know what this is.

223
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,166
And if you could keep the

224
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,250
hammer price under on you,

225
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,625
I'll make all your weird

226
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,666
fanboy dreams come true.

227
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:28,625
Okay?

228
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,500
Two loose cannons.

229
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,666
We're in turquoise blouses.

230
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:33,875
Yep.

231
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:35,583
Let's do it.

232
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,125
And we got $500.

233
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,458
$500 over here.

234
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,083
We got $500.

235
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,000
We got $600.

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,083
We got $600.

237
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,750
We got $600 over here.

238
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,625
Oh, can we hear you?

239
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,000
$700.

240
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,083
We got $700.

241
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,250
We got $700 here.

242
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,416
We got $800 over here.

243
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,166
We got $850.

244
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:48,916
Do we hear $850?

245
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,541
Do we hear $850 over here?

246
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,333
Do we hear any more?

247
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:51,875
Do we hear 900?

248
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:52,583
900.

249
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,791
900 is going once, 900 going twice, and

250
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,041
900 going three times

251
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,375
and sold to hometown hero

252
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,125
Garret the Garbage Man Garrison for $900.

253
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,375
I wouldn't cash that

254
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,250
for about six months.

255
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:07,041
What?

256
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,083
Yeah.

257
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:09,666
Come to Papa.

258
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:10,625
Cosmics.

259
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:11,041
Whoo!

260
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,916
Darryl, where is it?

261
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:24,666
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:25,541
I didn't check the box.

263
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

264
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:28,666
Where's that car?

265
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,291
There's no car in here!

266
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,458
That does not mean

267
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,083
you can crash this unit!

268
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,541
I'm up against it, man.

269
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:35,750
I'm...

270
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,375
Oh, no.

271
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:42,791
My store. I just...

272
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:46,791
I need to win, man.

273
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,250
I need...

274
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:48,916
I need to win.

275
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:51,625
Let's roll, everyone.

276
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:53,833
This man has no respect

277
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:54,750
for the storage community.

278
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,541
I'm not the city sound of pouring rain

279
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,083
And all the tears you

280
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,583
cry, they call my name

281
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,333
Remember yesterday

282
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,500
walking hand in hand

283
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,325
Love letters in the sand

284
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,958
I remember you

285
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,333
I remember you

286
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,958
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

287
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:20,291
I'm leaving

288
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,583
Oh, oh, oh, oh

289
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,416
Look, Chugless was not

290
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,583
my first choice either,

291
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,625
but it was Mom's dying

292
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,625
wish for us to live here.

293
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,458
Or at least that's how I interpreted it.

294
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,208
Yeah, I read something online.

295
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:40,833
This place sucks.

296
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,375
Anyways, rent is super low,

297
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,708
and I've got a full-time gig here,

298
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,250
so it's not really an offer we're gonna

299
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,083
turn down right now.

300
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,750
Yeah, I get it.

301
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,375
Look, I think you're

302
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,333
really gonna like it here.

303
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,500
Oh, what's going on with that dude?

304
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:02,166
Oh, my gosh, Henry, we're in Chugless.

305
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,166
Stay high to chuggy the chip.

306
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:13,125
All right, this is the new neighborhood.

307
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:14,708
When was this house built?

308
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,291
It's so nice to meet you.

309
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,541
Yeah, nice to meet you.

310
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,416
Your new bosses sent you this.

311
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:22,916
Oh.

312
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,708
Yeah, people love working

313
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,083
at a potato chip factory.

314
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,166
Yeah, well, I'm running

315
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,541
their socials for a little bit.

316
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,083
I said I'd get their

317
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,375
father account past 75.

318
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,208
Nice!

319
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:33,750
You must be Henry.

320
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,166
Nice to meet you. I'm Don.

321
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,875
All right, why is there an

322
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,083
alpaca hanging out of your car?

323
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,291
Well, real estate's not my only hustle.

324
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,166
I'll also do some

325
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,833
mobile zoo stuff on the side.

326
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,375
In who, I gotta run.

327
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,958
Call me if you need anything.

328
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,416
Also, uh, I'm really

329
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,500
sorry about your mom.

330
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,375
She's really brave what you're doing.

331
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:54,916
I hope you know that.

332
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:57,166
Thank you.

Henry! Breakfast is ready!

337
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,583
I'm coming!

338
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:53,666
Check it out.

339
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,375
I made you mom's signature

340
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,958
tater-top breakfast pizza.

341
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:58,791
So you can hand out

342
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,125
slices on your first day?

343
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,291
So she wanted me to seem normal.

344
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,000
I do!

345
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,000
Who do you think I am?

346
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,083
I got you some body spray.

347

Signature scents are huge here.

00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,041
Velvet mischief?

349
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,333
You're gonna wanna spray

350
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,375
it and then walk into it.

351
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,000
Don't be too direct.

352
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,000
It's really powerful.

353
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:16,125
Okay.

354
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:16,916
Love you.

355
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,666
Love you too.

356
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,375
Smells like banana bread and poo.

357
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,541
Your store's running cool.

358
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:55,958
Yeah, I know.

359
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,791
Looking for anything in particular?

360
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,208
Nah, just checking some stuff out.

361
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,500
Non-committal. Classic loser mentality.

362
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:03,625
I can help.

363
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,958
I'm starting a mentorship program for

364
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,500
people who wanna win at the game of life.

365
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,333
50 bucks an hour.

366
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,041
Cool. How do you actually win at life?

367
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,583
That's literally the

368
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,625
answer I charge money for.

369
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:18,833
Tots.

370
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,166
What's with the breakfast pizza?

371
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,375
My sister made it.

372
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,166
I'm supposed to hand out

373
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,375
slices at school to make friends.

374
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,416
A little desperate for

375
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,375
day one, don't you think?

376
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,125
I also noticed that

377
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,041
you're wearing velvet mischief.

378
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:29,916
It's a wonderful cologne.

379
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,000
And I strongly believe that every young

380
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,333
man should have his own signature sent.

381
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,166
I didn't think I applied very much.

382
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,500
Listen, I'm gonna give

383
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,708
you a hot garbage tip.

384
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:40,625
Friendship is like a puzzle.

385
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:41,666
Sometimes you think you

386
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,083
need lots of pieces to be cool.

387
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:43,750
And sometimes it's

388
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,875
just one piece to be cool.

389
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,416
Then people will be like, "That's not a

390
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,583
puzzle. That's a picture."

391
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,458
And they have a right to speak, too.

392
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,500
Okay, well, I gotta go to school.

393
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,291
Whatever, nerd. Just leave the pizza.

394
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,125
All right. Let's put this name tag on.

395
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,250
Uh, why does it have

396
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,041
an exclamation point?

397
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,166
Oh, Henry, we're just

398
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,583
so thrilled to have you.

399
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:09,625
You know, you're the

400
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,250
first student to enroll here

401
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,458
ever since that article came out about

402
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,166
the school rankings.

403
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,291
Anyway, I'm Vice Principal

404
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,083
Marlene, and I'm an open book.

405
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,875
You probably heard that my husband

406
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,916
Clemente recently divorced me.

407
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,958
And to be honest, I expected

408
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,333
it to hurt more than it does.

409
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,541
You know, the fire went out on our

410
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,291
marriage 20 years ago.

411
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,166
But we stuck it out for the dogs.

412
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,083
Okay, let's get you to your first class.

413
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,333
Good morning. Just a

414
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,375
little something about myself.

415
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,000
I teach gym. I teach art.

416
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,666
Financially, I'm

417
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,083
living in a nightmare, okay?

418
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:50,625
I wouldn't wish my

419
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,958
life on my worst enemy.

420
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,291
Last year, I claimed

421
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,083
$4,000 on my tax return.

422
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,833
I also have several

423
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,083
pending lawsuits, okay?

424
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,458
But most of my money is tied up in a

425
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,541
drone kiosk at the mall.

426
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,083
Okay, today we're gonna do a still life.

427
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,041
One orange, one banana.

428
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,708
Let's get after it, people.

429
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:18,625
I want to do this. I'm not taking it.

430
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:23,250
I want to do this. I want to do this.

431
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,208
I want to do this. I want to do this.

432
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,750
What is this? Don't you

433
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,708
know what a still life is?

434
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,875
That means you just draw the thing. Do

435
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,041
the assignment next time.

436
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,458
That jetpack would never work.

437
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,458
It's kind of foolproof,

438
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,375
actually. It's just math.

439
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,791
My dad said math has been debunked.

440
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,958
Check it out. New kid

441
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,125
thinks he's a rocket scientist.

442
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,083
I'd love to be a rocket

443
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,416
scientist. So prove it.

444
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,750
(Whistle)

445
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:15,875
Loser.

446
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,125
All right. Count us down, guys.

447
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,708
Five, four, three, two, one.

448
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,958
Okay, so I know that we're all very

449
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,500
excited about the new rebrand.

450
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,833
But I don't think you should call your

451
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,416
party bags salt sacks.

452
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:40,458
Whistle)

453
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:49,458
Tiny!

454
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:59,166
I was never here, okay?

455
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,041
Well, the good news is nobody died.

456
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,541
The bad news is you've destroyed the

457
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,083
American potato chip economy.

458
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,541
I'm sorry, okay? It was an accident.

459
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:12,958
This could be grounds

460
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,125
for expulsion, Henry.

461
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,000
I need you to call your guardian.

462
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,666
Game overwhelmed.

463
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,583
Hey, Mr. Garbage Man, it's

464
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,875
Henry. The kid with the tater tot,

465
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,875
Berks Pizza. Oh, yeah.

466
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,375
I have a weird favor to ask.

467
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,625
Could you come to my school

468
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,375
and pretend to be my uncle?

469
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,291
No way. I don't do that stuff anymore.

470
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,625
I have 26 bucks.

471
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:45,916
Hi, I'm Henry's uncle.

472
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,833
You? The trash bag?

473
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,333
It's actually garbage, man.

474
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,500
Garbage, man, huh?

475
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,916
Oh, you can bag me up and

476
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,666
take me to the curb any time.

477
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,375
But you got to bungee the lid,

478
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,000
because I got a lot of raccoons in there.

479
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,791
Whoever divorced you is a complete idiot.

480
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:17,416
Just don't get it. It should have worked.

481
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,041
I'm not this rape, but I probably just

482
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,208
caused my sister her job.

483
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,041
Oh, wow.

484
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,541
You're super creative.

485
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:28,833
Guess I'm not the only

486
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,083
true talent in chugless.

487
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,458
Hey, since you're going to juvie, mind if

488
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,541
I get this flyer back?

489
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,708
Paper don't grow on trees, and they're

490
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:38,916
really loud and can't go anymore.

491
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Well, you can have my book, too.

492
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:42,958
Because I'm done with it.

493
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:49,125
So what's this stupid joke?

494
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:50,583
Who cares?

495
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,666
Probably some new age bull crap.

496
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,958
I wonder what it does.

497
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:02,041
Hey, instructions.

498
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,333
Never under any circumstances

499
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,208
combine the orb and crystal.

500
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:20,916
Uh, man, do not follow this orb, even if

501
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,375
you're a struggling business owner,

502
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,375
and need a ton of cash fast, because there's loads of pressure down here.

503
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:28,291
But it's not worth the danger.

504
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,750
Hey, hey, dude, dude, I don't think I

505
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,500
want to go somewhere.

506
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:38,708
I'm sorry. I tried everything. I didn't

507
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,500
know who else to call.

508
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,875
No, it's okay. What's going on?

509
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,666
Henry's missing. I tried the school.

510
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,750
I tried his phone a million

511
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,916
times. He's not answering.

512
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,208
He was supposed to be home hours ago.

513
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,083
I thought he's still being detention for

514
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,375
blowing up chug of the chip.

515
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:51,375
That was him?

516
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:51,916
Give me a call. Oh, my God. What's the matter? He's not here. He's here.

517
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,500
Give me a call. Oh, my gosh.

518
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,750
I can't believe this. We're here for one

519
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,125
day, and he's already the town villain.

520
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,250
Got him. He's fine. He's just planning an

521
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,500
abandoned mineshaft.

522
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:02,666
What?

523
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,958
Come on. I'll drive.

524
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,291
You can feed Mr. Scribbles this busted

525
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,125
carrot if you want to keep

526
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,250
that pretty face of yours.

527
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,083
Hop in.

528
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,375
Okay.

529
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,583
You go first. I'll cover your face.

530
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:46,791
Danger. Whatever. Henry!

531
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,000
What are you doing down here?

532
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,875
Who's this guy? He's my new mentor.

533
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:54,875
Who, me?

534
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:55,625
No.

535
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,583
Hey, guys? Guys?

536
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:00,916
It's calling you, guys.

537
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:02,541
No!

538
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:07,083
No!

539
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:07,791
No!

540
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:16,916
No!

541
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:35,166
Oh, man. My butt. My butt.

542
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:38,750
No.

543
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,166
We're not in Idaho anymore.

544
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,000
I think this is Wyoming.

545
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:09,583
Wait. Who are you again?

546
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,125
Garrett the garbage man

547
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,166
Garrison. Game of the year 1989.

548
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:16,625
Whatever. I barely think about it.

549
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:19,208
What the heck?

550
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:21,625
Ooh.

551
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,750
That's what I think it is. It could be

552
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,666
our first quest giver.

553
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:28,000
I'll do the talking.

554
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,375
All right! Yeah!

555
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:33,625
Henry! Henry! Come back here!

556
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:54,958
Listen up, you twine!

557
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:58,208
We're running dangerously low on gold.

558
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,500
So let me be very clear.

559
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:02,708
You are all failures.

560
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:05,833
If you can't find more gold, I'll just

561
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,250
send you to the overworld to zombify.

562
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:11,333
Find me more gold!

563
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:13,458
You!

564
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:15,833
What are you making?

565
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:19,583
Come closer. It's all right.

566
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,833
Come on. I'm not going to bite you.

567
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,250
Aww. How pretty.

568
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,750
But how will that help me find more gold?

569
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:31,125
Oh.

570
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,333
What?

571
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:39,666
Well, looky what we have here.

572
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:48,083
Our time has come.

573
00:27:54,125 --> 00:28:03,583
My gosh! My leash!

574
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:07,250
Was I unclear when I said no one was to

575
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,208
waste time on art or leisure?

576
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:14,875
The orb has returned.

577
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,708
It can't be.

578
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:19,166
Dennis?

579
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,166
You stole it from me and

580
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,250
now you will retrieve it.

581
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:27,166
It would be a privilege, my leash.

582
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,875
You're going to unbind you now.

583
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,166
Don't do anything stupid.

584
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,083
Of course not. You can

585
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,375
trust this little dungeon pup.

586
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:37,708
Let me just sneak it back!

587
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,750
Go ahead. Strike me down.

588
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:43,000
My piglins will make a

589
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,375
meal of your beautiful wolf.

590
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,416
How do I know you're telling the truth?

591
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:49,000
There's only one way to find out.

592
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,416
The orb. For your little dog's life.

593
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,708
A causes Japanese Dragon stigma and cruelty.

594

[howling]

595
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,625
Does that feel quick to anyone else?

596
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,416
Yeah.

597
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:59,916
All right, everyone.

598
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:01,416
Stay calm.

599
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:02,625
Relay.

600
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:05,500
Free garbage tip.

601
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,500
Fear is just weakness

602
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,416
hijacking your body's cockpit.

603
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:12,541
What in the hell?

604
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:15,000
If that happens, you can

605
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,041
save Biocone DS to your body

606
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:18,500
plane's navigation system.

607
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:19,458
What?

608
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,375
Yeah, a garbage man isn't

609
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:22,625
speaking English or Spanish.

610
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:26,583
What am I doing here?

Henry!

624
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,666
No, we gotta solve him, brother!

How's he doing this?

628
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't know, but it might work.

629
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,208
Make way, faster!

630
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,166
Just go, go!

631
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:00,833
You can be sorry!

632
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,541
What, don't you slow down, you retarded!

What are you doing?

You idiot, run!

646
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,541
Open the door!

Who are you?

669
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,958
I am Steve.

670
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:41,333
Who are you people?

671
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:42,333
Where's Dennis?

672
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:44,833
Dennis, who is, we don't know any Dennis.

673
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:46,083
Then how'd you get that?

674
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:47,208
Hey, we're Lawless

675
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:48,750
Machacho, it's my property.

676
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,416
Do you even know what that is?

677
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,500
It's the orb of dominance.

678
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:53,750
It's a cube.

679
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,166
Okay, ha ha!

680
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:57,791
You people seriously have no idea what

681
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:58,458
you're dealing with.

682
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:00,458
Hand it over and no one gets hurt.

683
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:01,250
No way!

684
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,208
Okay, we need this thing to get home.

685
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,583
I hate to take a big fat

686
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:06,041
dumparoo on your plans,

687
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,458
but you can't get home!

688
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what do

689
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,416
you mean we can't get home?

690
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,000
Not without the earth crystal.

691
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,000
You mean my little boxy thing?

692
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:14,875
Garbage man busted it!

693
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:15,291
Nuh uh.

694
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:18,250
Listen, Henry, why don't you hold this?

695
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,333
You got those good photo vibes, kid.

696
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:21,583
I got photo vibes?

697
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:23,416
Are you implying that we're stuck here?

698
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:24,000
Yes!

699
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:25,708
Unless you get the earth

700
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,291
crystal, it's your only way home.

701
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,833
There's only one way

702
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,166
you could ever replace it

703
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,333
at the Woodland Mansion,

704
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:33,333
but going there would get you all killed.

705
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:34,833
But so it's staying here.

706
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:36,708
Fair enough.

707
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:38,750
Listen, I can get you home,

708
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,041
but then you gotta give me that orb.

709
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:41,958
So what are you gonna do with it?

710
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,000
None of your concern!

711
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:46,541
So, what do you say, do we have a deal?

712
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:48,583
We did just kill like 20 zombies.

713
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,083
More like 15, but okay.

714
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:55,041
All right, Steve, under two conditions.

715
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:57,041
One, always address me

716
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:58,000
because I'm the leader.

717
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,583
Two, if you double cross us,

718
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,166
(pew pew)

719
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,250
I will crack your cabasa with my butt

720
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,416
cheeks like a walnut.

721
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:06,416
(grunts)

722
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:08,416
This guy is such a tool bag.

723
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,500
I'm so sorry, we just met this man,

724
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,500
and he's not the leader.

725
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:13,125
Hmm.

726
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:16,000
Well, it looks like Dr. Swallenstein here

727
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,375
just got himself a deal.

728
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:19,291
(pew pew)

729
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:22,041
(dramatic music)

730
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:24,333
Oh my gosh.

731
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:25,375
All right.

732
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,958
First we need to load up on some gear

733
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,166
or we're all gonna die.

734
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
Let's go to Midport Village.

735
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,708
This guy's lost his mind.

736
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:35,041
(yells)

737
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:45,291
Here it is.

738
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:46,791
Midport Village.

739
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:49,208
I got a secret stash of elite loot

740
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:49,833
that'll help us

741
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:50,958
survive the woodland mansion.

742
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,375
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

743
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:53,250
Who are these guys?

744
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:54,125
Oh, these dudes?

745
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,250
They're the villagers.

746
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:58,083
They're total pacifists and vegetarians.

747
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,041
You don't bug them, they won't bug you.

748
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:03,000
They just like to chill, trade, and eat

749
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,041
butt loads of bread.

750
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:05,458
They love crushing loaf.

751
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:06,500
So they built all this?

752
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,250
Yeah, most of it.

753
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:11,500
But the good stuff you see is all me.

754
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:12,083
(pew pew)

755
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:15,500
See some kind of king?

756
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:16,500
No.

757
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:19,458
That's a legend.

758
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,041
Kid, anything you can

759
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:23,583
dream about here, you can make.

760
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,500
Zero limits, you know

761
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,416
what I'm talking about.

762
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,791
That was your tower, right?

763
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:28,333
Yeah.

764
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:30,541
Pretty killer for a first build.

765
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:32,750
(screaming)

766
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,583
Relax, it's just an iron

767
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,458
golem, local security force.

768
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:41,625
But they're a bunch of big softies.

769
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:46,000
Unless you start

770
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,083
messing with the villagers.

771
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,083
Don't ever do that.

772
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:49,708
This place makes no sense.

773
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,958
Yo, I need protein like Pronto.

774
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,083
I got just the place, bro-hemeth.

775
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:01,541
(laughing)

776
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:03,041
Hello there.

777
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,166
Oh dude, I got goose

778
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:07,666
pimples just walking up on it.

779
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,250
You ever wonder what

780
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,791
happens when you mix hot lava

781
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:11,416
and chicken?

782
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:12,583
I did.

783
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:14,458
We're about to find out.

784
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,125
Uh oh!

785
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:20,625
(sizzling)

786
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:21,958
(squeals)

787
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:25,333
You hear that?

788
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:27,125
That's the sound of sizzling.

789
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,000
Mm-hm.

790
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:30,541
Smell that smell.

791
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:33,250
La la la lava

792
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:34,500
Cha cha cha chicken

793
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,000
Steve's lava chicken, yeah

794
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,125
Tasty as hell

795
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,541
Ooh mama see

796
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:41,000
Tonight you're ringing a bell

797
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,000
Crispy and juicy now

798
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,208
you're having a snack

799
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:47,041
Ooh super spicy it's a love of attack

800
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,666
(bell ringing) I have a small business too.

801
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:52,916
The one thing I try to do is

802
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:54,333
not have my jingle suck butt.

803
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:00,958
(yelling)

804
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:02,916
Freaking loser.

805
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:05,041
Pass the bird, turkey.

806
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:06,583
I'm not a little wimp

807
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:07,583
like big Steve here.

808
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,208
I crave heat and I crave pain.

809
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:11,541
Darren, wait!

810
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:13,708
Hear my words.

811
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:15,916
That chicken was just cooked in hot lava.

812
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,500
Let it cool down, man.

813
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:23,125
(sizzling)

814
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:29,333
Not bad.

815
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:38,166
Hey, garbage man.

816
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:39,666
You're a big time idiot.

817
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:42,250
(dramatic music)

818
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:45,000
What is it?

819
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:46,708
What?

820
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:51,875
General Chugga, get over here.

821
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:05,708
Hey, Melgosia, what's going on?

822
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,416
Your old dungeon buddy

823
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:09,541
Steve has betrayed us.

824
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:10,666
Well that's a bummer.

825
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:13,083
The orb is with four roundlings.

826
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,166
My spies tell me he has taken them to his

827
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:17,333
lava chicken shack.

828
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:18,500
No way.

829
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,250
I love that place.

830
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:21,583
La la la lava.

831
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:22,875
Chachachaching chicken.

832
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:23,666
Shut up.

833
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:24,916
Take your finest warriors,

834
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:26,500
bring me that orb and

835
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,750
kill the roundlings.

836
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:29,166
So like, you want me to

837
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:30,458
end his life or whatever?

838
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:31,833
Are you serious?

839
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:34,000
What do you think I'm talking about?

840
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:34,791
Okay.

841
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,083
I was just kind of

842
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,666
confused there for a second.

843
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:38,375
(growling)

844
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,208
Take us near the water

845
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:41,375
so you don't zombify.

846
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,791
Your majesty, I don't

847
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:44,625
think this is gonna be

848
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:45,708
enough to go around.

849
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:46,541
Deal with it.

850
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:47,583
No worries.

851
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:50,500
All right, drink up guys.

852
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:52,708
You don't want to zombify up there,

853
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,458
but just tiny sips, okay?

854
00:41:57,791 --> 00:42:00,250
Okay, so how do we find

855
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,000
this woodland mansion thing?

856
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,166
Over the mountains into the dark forest

857
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:06,041
right beyond the massive red shrooms.

858
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:07,833
Massive red shrooms?

859
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:08,125
Mm-hmm.

860
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:09,625
Oh, red ones.

861
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,333
We need to find a real map, Steve.

862
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:13,958
This place is dangerous,

863
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:15,208
and I need to get my brother out of here.

864
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,333
Well, it seems like he's

865
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,375
having a pretty good time.

866
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,541
Look, your brother has a gift.

867
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:20,291
You know that, right?

868
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:22,333
You should let him explore it.

869
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:23,708
Creativity in this

870
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:24,750
world is key to survival.

871
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,750
Okay, well in the real world,

872
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,833
things are a little bit different.

873
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,541
Creative kids get picked last for gym,

874
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:32,375
they sit at the bummer lunch table,

875
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:33,125
and they get bullied.

876
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,041
(chuckles)

877
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:35,250
Don't I know it.

878
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:36,000
Do you even realize

879
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,791
what he did back home?

880
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:38,833
He blew up chugging the chip.

881
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,708
Well, maybe I belong in this rock.

882
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:43,416
Henry, that's not what I meant.

883
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,958
That's not what I was saying at all.

884
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:48,416
Just so you know,

885
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:50,708
I'm more of a sister to

886
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:51,666
Hank than he'll ever be.

887
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:54,041
Yeah.

888
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:57,458
Bighead.

889
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:58,250
(door slams)

890
00:42:59,541 --> 00:42:59,916
You okay?

891
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:01,458
Fine.

892
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,916
Look, I found one of

893
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,000
these big-headed looking dudes

894
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,875
that sells maps.

895
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:06,750
Looks legit.

896
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:08,250
Come on.

897
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:11,833
Welcome to the stash.

898
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:15,083
TNT, firework rockets,

899
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:16,708
also good for propulsion.

900
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:18,458
Boots of swiftness,

901
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:20,250
diamond armor, full set,

902
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:22,333
and blades for days.

903
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:23,958
Everything will need to

904
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,125
make it to Woodland Mansion.

905
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:26,666
Whoa.

906
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:31,333
Focus loud, bro.

907
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:33,708
Look, but don't touch.

908
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:36,125
Those are some of my favorite treasures.

909
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:42,708
(door creaks)

910
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:47,625
What's this junk?

911
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:50,000
That is an ender pearl.

912
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,166
Teleports you to wherever you throw it.

913
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:54,041
Yeah, right.

914
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:55,000
Not on!

915
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,166
(screams)

916
00:43:57,166 --> 00:44:01,916
And that was the only one I had.

917
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:02,875
No biggie.

918
00:44:03,416 --> 00:44:05,333
Almost died fighting an enderman for it.

919
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,875
Come with me.

920
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:15,583
This is a crafting table.

921
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:16,708
Here's how it works.

922
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:18,250
You place these elements

923
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,541
in different patterns and--

924
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:21,875
(screams)

925
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:25,916
You got yourself a sweet blade.

926
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,958
You wanna see a blade?

927
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:32,625
I'll show you a blade.

928
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:34,416
Yeah.

929
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:37,958
(glass shatters)

930
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:38,500
Hammer.

931
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:40,583
Good--

932
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:41,333
(glass shatters)

933
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:42,041
(sighs)

934
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,666
(laughs)

935
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:44,750
That's okay, bud.

936
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,250
Buckuts are useful here.

937
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,458
Yeah, they're cool, Garrett.

938
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:49,208
They're like nunchucks.

939
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,333
Yeah, I know.

940
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:51,708
That's why I made them.

941
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:55,625
They're buckchuckits.

942
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:57,458
Uh, they're what?

943
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:02,041
Hey, can I try something else?

944
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,500
Absorutin-tootley.

945
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,958
Bro, you had tots the whole time?

946
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:10,500
Yeah, sorry.

947
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:12,500
(glass shatters)

948
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,583
(screams)

949
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:16,541
It's a tot launcher.

950
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:18,375
Dude, you just took

951
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:19,666
boring junk from the real world

952
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:20,666
to create something

953
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:22,500
amazing that is next level.

954
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,416
Hank, can I play with your

955
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:25,250
tot launcher when you're done?

956
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:25,875
Yeah.

957
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:26,750
Sweet.

958
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:28,666
Hey, Steve, can I

959
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:29,416
talk to you for a second?

960
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:30,375
Sure thing.

961
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:32,875
(glass shatters)

962
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:35,708
(glass shatters)

963
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:38,791
What's up?

964
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:40,875
You know that note you left with the orb?

965
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:42,250
One about the riches.

966
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:44,000
I read it.

967
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:44,625
Yeah.

968
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:46,500
There's riches everywhere.

969
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,416
Keep a fat stash of

970
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:48,791
diamonds at the redstone mines.

971
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:50,500
So this treasure load is on

972
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,500
the way to this mansion place.

973
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:52,791
Not really.

974
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,166
It's a major detour.

975
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:55,416
Plus, the mines can be perilous.

976
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:57,458
I'm gonna keep it simple for you, Steve.

977
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:00,833
No diamonds.

978
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:02,458
No orb.

979
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:05,916
You smell what I'm stepping in.

980
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:16,333
We need a map.

981
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:24,666
Ned.

982
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,166
It's on.

983
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,750
Something's going down.

984
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:43,083
(dramatic music)

985
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:50,416
All right, guys.

986
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,708
Just start trashing their purges.

987
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:54,500
Villagers hate that.

988
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,875
(woman screams)

989
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:13,458
(dramatic music)

990
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:18,166
(man screams)

991
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:25,000
Who are these guys?

992
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:25,333
England.

993
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,958
They must react to the orb.

994
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,500
Hey, Steve.

995
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:32,791
What's going on, dude?

996
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:33,833
Crap.

997
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:35,166
Shroomless.

998
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:37,500
I'm really sorry that I have to

999
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,125
annihilate you and stuff.

1000
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:40,333
(man screams)

1001
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:42,041
Malcolm should double-cross me.

1002
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:44,916
We just need that orb thingy.

1003
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,750
You rode this guy?

1004
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,833
Yeah, we used to get

1005
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:48,000
into some dungeon stuff.

1006
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,083
He seems nice, but he's a cat.

1007
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:52,583
Wow, you look good, bro hammer.

1008
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,958
You lose some weight.

1009
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:55,416
Stand back, boys.

1010
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:57,166
This peak is mine.

1011
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:57,750
No.

1012
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,291
I'm tired of you getting all the glory.

1013
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:03,583
This peak is mine.

1014
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:12,958
Steve!

1015
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,000
(man screams)

1016
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:30,416
We have to get to Henry.

1017
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:31,458
Do you think we can take these guys?

1018
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,458
You are?

1019
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:35,583
Yeah, you got me feeling.

1020
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:41,875
(dramatic music)

1021
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,750
Feeling like I'm everything

1022
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,708
I hide my love in the hot sunshine

1023
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,625
I feel like I'm alive

1024
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:50,291
Everybody's loving it

1025
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:52,000
I'm having fun with it

1026
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:53,458
Like a rock star

1027
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:54,958
Like a rocket ship

1028
00:48:56,916 --> 00:48:58,583
It's got me feeling brand new

1029
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:02,000
It's got me feeling brand new

1030
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,375
It's got me feeling brand new

1031
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,000
It's got me feeling brand new

1032
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:09,125
Feeling brand new

1033
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:12,125
You can do it

1034
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:14,750
Watch me move up, down, start to fly

1035
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:16,416
Nice move, bro.

1036
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:19,875
Sorry.

1037
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:23,833
It's got me feeling brand new

1038
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:27,083
It's got me feeling brand new

1039
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:30,125
Can we feel it brand new

1040
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:33,291
It's got me feeling brand new

1041
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:36,625
The party's over, bud.

1042
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:37,916
Just give me the orb.

1043
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:40,041
Let me do something, let me do something.

1044
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:42,083
It's got me feeling brand new

1045
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:44,583
Ninja roll.

1046
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:47,833
What happened?

1047
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:49,833
I saved your butt, that's what happened.

1048
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:51,083
He begs me later.

1049
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:52,750
We gotta get to the rampart.

1050
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:53,583
Follow me!

1051
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:58,375
(explosion)

1052
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,208
Henry!

1053
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,416
Matt, we have to go now.

1054
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,000
Don, I can't help

1055
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,375
leaving, he's my entire family.

1056
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:10,500
We need you alive.

1057
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:11,375
Okay, well meet him back

1058
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,083
at the Woodland mansion.

1059
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:13,833
We gotta go find him back, Doc, come on!

1060
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:17,458
Garrett, what about Natalie?

1061
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,458
We'll meet her at the mansion.

1062
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:28,458
(dramatic music)

1063
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:32,500
Oh great, now what?

1064
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:35,166
Electro wing suits.

1065
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:38,750
Whoa!

1066
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:40,000
Head for those mountains!

1067
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:40,666
I thought we were going

1068
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:41,458
to the Woodland mansion.

1069
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:42,625
Hey, don't talk back to your elders.

1070
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:43,416
But-- Bye bye.

1071
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:45,291
(explosion)

1072
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,541
(screaming)

1073
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:50,375
Those things work right?

1074
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:51,250
Absolutely.

1075
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:53,250
(screaming)

1076
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:56,666
(explosion)

1077
00:50:57,458 --> 00:50:57,625
Whoopsie!

1078
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:00,666
Check it out, I'm late!

1079
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:02,000
Yeah!

1080
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:05,541
(laughing)

1081
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Buenos dias, wish me to see you later.

1082
00:51:10,541 --> 00:51:11,541
(screaming)

1083
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:16,500
I thought I'd grab three, wait for me!

1084
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:19,000
(screaming)

1085
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:19,791
Coming in hot!

1086
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:21,333
(explosion)

1087
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:28,375
(rock music)

1088
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:30,000
(screaming)

1089
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:32,416
No, no way, dude!

1090
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:34,208
They're doing my hair!

1091
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:35,750
Just relax, let my hips

1092
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,583
guide you, it's the only way!

1093
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,208
What?

1094
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,500
All I've got to think

1095
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,041
of ain't much better

1096
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,250
You're so mean, but

1097
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:47,250
Think you're the one

1098
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:48,541
Hey, we'll have a

1099
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:50,083
better chance if we split up!

1100
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:53,666
(screaming)

1101
00:51:53,666 --> 00:52:00,458
(explosion) (screaming)

1102
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:03,916
(screaming)

1103
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:05,750
(explosion)

1104
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:06,375
(screaming)

1105
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:08,916
Get out of here, you stupid pig!

1106
00:52:09,708 --> 00:52:10,833
(screaming)

1107
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:12,166
(explosion)

1108
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:15,041
(screaming)

1109
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:22,333
(explosion)

1110
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:27,500
(screaming)

1111
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:37,250
We got hot riders there at three o'clock!

1112
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:42,041
(explosion)

1113
00:52:47,916 --> 00:52:48,708
We're boxed in!

1114
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,125
Head for the tunnel!

1115
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:52,000
We're not gonna fit!

1116
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:53,083
We're too chunky!

1117
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:54,875
We're gonna have to go nose to toes!

1118
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:56,041
Full man sandwich!

1119
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:58,416
What? No, I'm not gonna do that!

1120
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,500
I'm ordering you to

1121
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,083
make a full man sandwich!

1122
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:01,833
Okay!

1123
00:53:03,166 --> 00:53:05,250
(screaming)

1124
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:06,458
Oh my god!

1125
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:07,958
Yeah!

1126
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,958
Dang it, a lava bucket!

1127
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:14,833
Okay!

1128
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:16,166
Tighten up!

1129
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:16,875
What?

1130
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:17,791
There's still some

1131
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:19,375
negative space back there!

1132
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:20,333
We both know it!

1133
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:22,000
I'm trying to close the gaps!

1134
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:23,541
I'm gonna squeeze for your safety!

1135
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,750
I understand!

1136
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:27,583
(explosion)

1137
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:34,416
(screaming)

1138
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:40,000
(explosion)

1139
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,250
(screaming)

1140
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:45,625
Get out of here, stupid pig!

1141
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,958
Get out of here!

1142
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:56,083
(screaming)

1143
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:56,875
Help me!

1144
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:00,875
Oh crap!

1145
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:05,250
(screaming)

1146
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:10,916
(screaming)

1147
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:12,875
Don't worry!

1148
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,125
I'm gonna cushion our

1149
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,375
fall with this water bucket!

1150
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:18,500
(screaming)

1151
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,791
(explosion)

1152
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:24,666
(screaming)

1153
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:28,875
You couldn't really fight, Matt!

1154
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:29,666
You were kicking butt!

1155
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:30,500
Thanks, I have no

1156
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,666
idea where it came from!

1157
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:32,333
There he is!

1158
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:33,000
He's getting away!

1159
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,083
Hey, get back here!

1160
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:34,875
We need a map!

1161
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:35,791
First we need a boat!

1162
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:37,125
Okay, okay, uh.

1163
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:38,000
Okay, hurry!

1164
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,416
The map guy's falling away!

1165
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:42,500
(laughing)

1166
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:45,166
Full magic!

1167
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:48,000
(explosion)

1168
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:49,541
Mm-hmm.

1169
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:50,791
Matt, that's the

1170
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:51,916
worst boat I've ever seen.

1171
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:53,833
I'm sorry, I have no idea what I'm doing.

1172
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:54,583
Forget it!

1173
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:55,375
Let's go, come on!

1174
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:00,833
(dramatic music)

1175
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:03,375
(screaming)

1176
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:09,708
(groaning)

1177
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:09,750
(explosion)

1178
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:14,333
(groaning)

1179
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:17,208
Oh no, not again!

1180
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:20,416
Oh, I am so sorry!

1181
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:22,041
Oh my God, are you all right?

1182
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,291
Oh my God, oh my God, are you all right?

1183
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:29,583
Your head is huge!

1184
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,541
Ah.

1185
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:32,875
You're not gonna sue me, are you?

1186
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:35,208
Because everyone wants to sue me

1187
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:35,958
once I hit them with

1188
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,166
my Jeep Grand Cherokee!

1189
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:38,166
Ah.

1190
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,208
Oh my, how about this?

1191
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:42,416
What if I just take you to dinner?

1192
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:44,750
Would you like to go to dinner?

1193
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:45,583
Ha.

1194
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:49,083
You got some talking to do, buddy.

1195
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,458
Hank and I want some answers.

1196
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:52,000
Like how are we gonna stop those pigs

1197
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,625
and why is my beard so like, gorgonzola?

1198
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:54,708
Yeah, and who said evil sorcerers

1199
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:55,416
you were talking about?

1200
00:55:55,583 --> 00:55:55,708
Look!

1201
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:57,791
The sorceress is a

1202
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:59,333
pigling queen called Nalgosia.

1203
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:00,375
Those are her minions.

1204
00:56:01,083 --> 00:56:02,500
She rules over them in a dark

1205
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,708
hellscape called the Nether.

1206
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:06,500
And I always keep a chunk of gorgonzola

1207
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,708
in my front pocket, okay?

1208
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,166
It's my best friend's

1209
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,125
favorite snacky snack.

1210
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,041
My best friend Dennis.

1211
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,083
Nalgosia's path to villainy

1212
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,916
started the way these things often do.

1213
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:22,583
During the semi-finals of

1214
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:24,000
the Nether's Got Talent.

1215
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:28,000
(upbeat music)

1216
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:30,416
Young Nalgosia always dreamed

1217
00:56:30,416 --> 00:56:32,375
of being a world-class dancer.

1218
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:36,041
Her moves were pretty out there.

1219
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:39,000
No one in the Nether was ready for it.

1220
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:40,708
(all screaming)

1221
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,791
It crushed her.

1222
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,041
What'd I tell you about all that dancing?

1223
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:49,333
You deserve to fail.

1224
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:52,500
Creativity will never make you happy,

1225
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:53,958
but you know what will?

1226
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:55,000
Goal.

1227
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:57,125
Now go find some.

1228
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,333
So from that day forward,

1229
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,458
she denounced all forms of creativity.

1230
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:05,000
If she ever gets that orb,

1231
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,750
she'll block out the sun.

1232
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,666
Netherward will flourish.

1233
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:10,666
This beautiful world and everything in it

1234
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:11,791
will wither and die.

1235
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:12,916
And you were gonna give it to her?

1236
00:57:13,666 --> 00:57:14,083
Great idea.

1237
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:16,125
I'm not gonna give it to her,

1238
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,208
but I need that orb for leverage.

1239
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,791
Gotta save Dennis.

1240
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,250
Come.

1241
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:25,500
Woodland Mansion is just

1242
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,750
beyond the Redstone Mountains.

1243
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:29,500
We can go over or through.

1244
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:31,000
Whatever's fastest.

1245
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:34,625
Through will be faster.

1246
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,458
(growling)

1247
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,083
General Chungus, you have

1248
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:45,958
failed me for the last time.

1249
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:47,875
Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.

1250
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:50,333
Ah, bring out the beast.

1251
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:54,125
What do you mean you just

1252
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:55,250
have to put the bride in?

1253
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:56,708
Well, he's a big deal.

1254
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:57,500
Get it done.

1255
00:57:58,083 --> 00:57:59,416
Look, everybody knows

1256
00:57:59,416 --> 00:58:00,875
it wasn't my best day,

1257
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:02,125
but I'm really trying

1258
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:03,291
to set some new goals.

1259
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,375
(growling)

1260
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:10,625
(laughing)

1261
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:17,458
The bright hawk, my ultimate weapon.

1262
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:23,208
There it is.

1263
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:27,708
Can't help it.

1264
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:30,458
Wait, does this mean you're firing me?

1265
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,291
(laughing)

1266
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:34,583
Well done.

1267
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:36,000
Now find the

1268
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,166
roundlings and bring me the orb.

1269
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:40,083
(growling)

1270
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:43,916
We are so lost.

1271
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:52,791
My one job was to

1272
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:54,333
protect Henry and I blew it.

1273
00:58:55,541 --> 00:58:57,583
I just promised my mom I'd never let

1274
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:58,708
anything happen to him.

1275
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,375
I guess I'm just not cut

1276
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:02,000
out for this parenting stuff.

1277
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:08,333
I just wish I could've been a kid

1278
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:10,000
for a little bit longer, you know?

1279
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,583
I just have that feeling

1280
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:12,750
like I could've done anything.

1281
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:13,666
I hear you.

1282
00:59:14,125 --> 00:59:15,416
Being a grownup sucks.

1283
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:18,250
You got all these responsibilities

1284
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:20,333
and you just stopped chasing your dreams.

1285
00:59:22,708 --> 00:59:25,000
You think I like having 15 hustles?

1286
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,250
(growling)

1287
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:34,583
(screaming)

1288
00:59:35,166 --> 00:59:36,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait,

1289
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,291
wait, hold up, hold up.

1290
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:38,750
Let's just calm down.

1291
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:42,166
I think this one just needs some TLC.

1292
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:44,333
Yeah?

1293
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:45,708
You like bones?

1294
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:48,708
I bet you like bones

1295
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:50,666
as you go, as you do.

1296
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:52,250
(gasping) Yes?

1297
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:56,166
Oh, aren't you a beautiful one?

1298
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,541
Yes you are.

1299
00:59:57,583 --> 00:59:59,166
I'll get you, girl.

1300
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:02,083
I cannot believe you just did that.

1301
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:03,000
(crashing)

1302
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:03,375
What?

1303
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:06,333
Dennis?

1304
01:00:07,666 --> 01:00:08,708
Steve's Dennis?

1305
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,541
(grunting) Can you take us to him?

1306
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:14,416
(grunting)

1307
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:17,375
Oh, Nat, I think this might be our way

1308
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:18,333
to the Woodland Mansion.

1309
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:20,000
(screaming)

1310
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:21,750
Let's follow that pooch.

1311
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:26,291
Right this way, gentlemen.

1312
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:28,333
Woo hoo hoo!

1313
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,166
Looky, looky here.

1314
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:32,791
Welcome to the Redstone Mines.

1315
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:35,666
See that glowy stuff?

1316
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:36,958
That's Redstone.

1317
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:38,333
It conducts energy.

1318
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:40,000
Can build some crazy

1319
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,291
contraptions with it.

1320
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,791
Thought you said this was a diamond mine.

1321
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:47,208
Easy, big dog, they're here.

1322
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,583
But be careful.

1323
01:00:49,166 --> 01:00:51,333
I set some booby traps a long time ago.

1324
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,291
Can't for the life of me

1325
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:54,250
remember where they are.

1326
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,125
(crashing)

1327
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,208
(whimpering)

1328
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:02,500
(screaming)

1329
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:11,000
(screaming)

1330
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:15,750
Ha, here it is.

1331
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:16,791
Thanks, Garrett.

1332
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:18,583
Yeah.

1333
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:20,791
(laughing)

1334
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:23,583
Yes, we're diamonds.

1335
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:25,958
That's what I'm talking about.

1336
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:28,500
Steve delivers the goods.

1337
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,833
Did you guys plan this?

1338
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:31,958
I'm sorry, Henry.

1339
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,250
Woo!

1340
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:34,500
Yeah!

1341
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:35,625
I'm not.

1342
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:37,375
(crashing)

1343
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:38,125
Yeah.

1344
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:39,500
What the heck, man?

1345
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:40,666
Overlax.

1346
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:42,000
Not only could be at the mansion already.

1347
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,500
Too far?

1348
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:48,500
Oh no.

1349
01:01:49,833 --> 01:01:50,500
Neither what?

1350
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,333
What does that mean?

1351
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:53,750
(screaming)

1352
01:01:56,416 --> 01:01:57,416
(crashing)

1353
01:01:58,333 --> 01:02:00,416
Oh, the Great Hawk!

1354
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:02,583
She finally put the brain in.

1355
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:04,166
Run for the minecarts!

1356
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:07,166
(screaming)

1357
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:12,000
Here, Henry, here!

1358
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:16,083
(screaming)

1359
01:02:17,666 --> 01:02:18,958
If memory serves, I've

1360
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:20,000
built a kick-ass safe

1361
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,166
for him just up ahead.

1362
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:22,916
(crashing)

1363
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:23,375
Whoa.

1364
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:25,041
(crashing)

1365
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:27,291
Dang it, my torch blew out!

1366
01:02:27,875 --> 01:02:28,500
Why are we stopping?

1367
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:30,416
We're a husky load, gents.

1368
01:02:30,416 --> 01:02:32,125
We're gonna need a redstone boost fast.

1369
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:33,666
What's that sound?

1370
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:36,041
(crashing)

1371
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:36,708
Crap!

1372
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,500
My creeper farm.

1373
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:43,458
What kind of idiot

1374
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:44,458
would breathe these things?

1375
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:47,916
(growling)

1376
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:51,000
Up ahead, look!

1377
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:54,125
We gotta get to the redstone rail!

1378
01:02:54,791 --> 01:02:55,958
Garrett, you gotta send this message.

1379
01:02:56,208 --> 01:02:56,916
Get him and push!

1380
01:02:58,208 --> 01:02:58,416
Okay.

1381
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:00,208
Okay.

1382
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:02,875
(growling)

1383
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:07,041
Go, Garrett, go fast, man!

1384
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:09,125
We're not gonna beat this!

1385
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:11,416
Come on, Garrett, you gotta go faster!

1386
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,208
Start us laughing, Hank!

1387
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,708
(crashing)

1388
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Garrett, get in!

1389
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:20,541
He's right behind us!

1390
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:28,750
(growling)

1391
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,500
(growling)

1392
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:36,166
(screaming)

1393
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:43,500
Woo hoo!

1394
01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:44,916
Yeah!

1395
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:46,916
Woo hoo!

1396
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:53,416
Nice work, Gar-Gar, your little detour

1397
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:54,500
almost got us killed.

1398
01:03:54,916 --> 01:03:56,083
I'm a liar, so dramatic.

1399
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:57,291
We're still alive.

1400
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:58,625
What's your problem, man?

1401
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:00,416
We didn't need those stupid diamonds.

1402
01:04:00,916 --> 01:04:01,500
I swear, you were

1403
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,833
literally the most selfish person

1404
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:03,500
I've ever met.

1405
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:06,333
Whatever, I need them, okay?

1406
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:07,333
I need the diamonds,

1407
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:08,416
because I need the money,

1408
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:09,208
because I'm broke.

1409
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:11,875
You wouldn't know anything about that.

1410
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,833
My life sucks, kid, all right?

1411
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,375
I'm a frickin' loser.

1412
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:19,666
Here, I said it.

1413
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:21,166
I know it looks like I got

1414
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:22,041
it all put together, right?

1415
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,666
I'm smart, funny, bilingual,

1416
01:04:26,541 --> 01:04:28,375
el homble, tu un el faulto.

1417
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:33,416
That's not the reality.

1418
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:36,166
I'm not doing well.

1419
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:37,541
I'm bad.

1420
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:40,500
I'm washed up, Hank, and

1421
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,458
I'm gonna lose everything.

1422
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,083
And that's not the worst part.

1423
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:46,750
I'm alone.

1424
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:48,625
You're alone.

1425
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:51,000
I was your friend.

1426
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:57,333
Sorry about your finances.

1427
01:04:58,958 --> 01:04:59,625
Shut up, Steve.

1428
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:04,708
(upbeat music)

1429
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:10,375
(laughing)

1430
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:14,791
Hank.

1431
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,500
(laughing)

1432
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:23,416
Oh, no, it's possible.

1433
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:29,458
You know, I gotta tell

1434
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,333
you, I'm having a great time.

1435
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,708
I recently got divorced

1436
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:36,041
from my husband Clemente,

1437
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:40,083
and the main reason is, you know,

1438
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:42,166
he didn't have any personality.

1439
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:45,083
Not like you.

1440
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:47,500
Are you finished?

1441
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:49,541
No, I think he's Swedish.

1442
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:51,583
But we're done with our meal.

1443
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:56,458
There it is, the Woodland Mansion.

1444
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:57,500
We're gonna get in

1445
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,750
there, get the Earth Crystal,

1446
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,083
and get you guys home.

1447
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:01,166
Follow me.

1448
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,083
Check this out.

1449
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:05,000
Let's do this.

1450
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,125
Pay close attention to Papa Steve.

1451
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:09,458
The Woodland Mansion has three floors.

1452
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:11,375
The first floor is

1453
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:12,708
loaded with vindicators.

1454
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:14,916
Axe murderers, basically.

1455
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:16,625
Why is it third floor on the first floor?

1456
01:06:16,625 --> 01:06:17,416
I'm very confused.

1457
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,541
I was trying to make three floors,

1458
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:20,250
but I didn't have time

1459
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,375
to make like a doll house.

1460
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:24,291
The second floor crawls with evokers.

1461
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:26,875
They wield powerful dark magic.

1462
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:28,791
This is the worst model I've ever seen.

1463
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:30,000
Garrett, stop talking.

1464
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
We're trying to figure out a plan.

1465
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,791
Bro, how long you been mad at me for?

1466
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:33,833
I just got mad at you.

1467
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:35,708
Please don't be mad at me for this, okay?

1468
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:37,000
But I accidentally stole the

1469
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:37,750
worm while you were crafting.

1470
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:40,458
Are we cool now?

1471
01:06:41,125 --> 01:06:42,500
You are literally the worst

1472
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,250
person in the entire world.

1473
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,750
Guys, both of you,

1474
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:46,750
eyes on my demonstration.

1475
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:50,125
Third floor, houses the loot chamber.

1476
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:52,291
That's where the Earth Crystal is,

1477
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,250
but it's guarded by endemine.

1478
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,000
Whatever you do, do

1479
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,291
not look them in the eye.

1480
01:06:57,541 --> 01:06:58,791
They'll fry your brains out.

1481
01:06:59,250 --> 01:06:59,958
Okay, well I could build

1482
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:01,000
stairs to the second floor,

1483
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,916
sneak in through the window,

1484
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:02,875
and snag the Earth Crystal.

1485
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:04,333
That's a great idea, Hank.

1486
01:07:04,666 --> 01:07:05,500
But to pull it off,

1487
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,083
we're gonna need a

1488
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:07,166
pretty sweet diversion.

1489
01:07:08,416 --> 01:07:09,458
You know what could work on these guys?

1490
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:10,958
It sounds crazy.

1491
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:11,875
Hit me.

1492
01:07:13,375 --> 01:07:14,333
(upbeat music)

1493
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:16,416
(cheering)

1494
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:20,708
Someone order a saxophone birthday party?

1495
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:22,666
(growling)

1496
01:07:22,666 --> 01:07:23,708
(laughing)

1497
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:25,500
Looks like it's everyone's birthday.

1498
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:26,250
Hit it.

1499
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:28,250
(imitating drumming)

1500
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:30,416
Friendship is the wish you make

1501
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:31,416
When you're blowing out the

1502
01:07:31,416 --> 01:07:32,583
candles on your birthday cake

1503
01:07:32,958 --> 01:07:34,708
Don't be a bully and don't be a boo

1504
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:36,875
Time to put on your birthday suit

1505
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:38,000
Today is the best,

1506
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
it's the day you will horn

1507
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:41,250
Time for us to blow the birthday horn

1508
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:42,708
(humming)

1509
01:07:47,916 --> 01:07:51,416
(growling)

1510
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:55,416
(growling)

1511
01:07:55,416 --> 01:08:09,333
(suspenseful music) (growling)

1512
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:10,666
(growling)

1513
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:14,708
(suspenseful music)

1514
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:16,000
(growling)

1515
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:32,000
(suspenseful music)

1516
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,458
(growling)

1517
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:39,166
(suspenseful music)

1518
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:45,416
You gotta be kidding me.

1519
01:08:46,541 --> 01:08:47,416
(suspenseful music)

1520
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:48,666
You got this, Darkheart!

1521
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,166
Reach down, Jeeves!

1522
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:54,000
You're the sharkless kitten, I love ya!

1523
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:55,416
Come on, Steve.

1524
01:08:55,666 --> 01:08:56,333
It's some kind of

1525
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:58,041
sadistic vindicator fight club.

1526
01:08:58,875 --> 01:08:59,500
I've heard of these,

1527
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,500
but I've never seen one.

1528
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:01,916
They want me to fight the chicken?

1529
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:02,500
Wait!

1530
01:09:03,416 --> 01:09:04,916
It's a fight to the death, kid!

1531
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:08,250
(suspenseful music)

1532
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:22,416
(growling)

1533
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:24,750
(laughing)

1534
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,500
Chicken Draki!

1535
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:31,666
(screaming)

1536
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:35,583
(suspenseful music)

1537
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:37,708
Watch out!

1538
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:40,500
(suspenseful music)

1539
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:42,000
Get them away from your face!

1540
01:09:42,916 --> 01:09:45,500
(screaming)

1541
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,833
(suspenseful music)

1542
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,500
(suspenseful music)

1543
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:19,833
(screaming)

1544
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:33,916
Finally.

1545
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:43,750
(suspenseful music)

1546
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:49,458
(growling)

1547
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:52,416
(growling)

1548
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:53,458
(gasping)

1549
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:55,833
(growling)

1550
01:10:57,833 --> 01:11:00,083
(growling)

1551
01:11:00,083 --> 01:11:05,583
(screaming)

1552
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:05,916
(screaming)

1553
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:06,708
Help me, help me!

1554
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:11,666
(growling)

1555
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:18,375
(crying)

1556
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:21,125
I'm sorry, little buddy.

1557
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:22,875
Don't fall for it, Gaga!

1558
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:25,041
That baby's got the heart of a demon!

1559
01:11:26,125 --> 01:11:27,041
What kind of demon are you?

1560
01:11:27,875 --> 01:11:29,375
You're a cute little bugger face.

1561
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:31,875
I'm just gonna pet your little head.

1562
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:35,125
(screaming)

1563
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:40,291
(suspenseful music)

1564
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:44,375
You'll never be as cool as me, Hank.

1565
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:45,791
Just give up.

1566
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:48,000
The over-road doesn't need you, Henry.

1567
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:48,458
Give up.

1568
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:49,375
Neither do I.

1569
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:51,583
This is all your fault, Henry.

1570
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:53,375
Everything you do, anybody.

1571
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:56,583
This doesn't trash demon.

1572
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:59,166
Just give up, little scepter.

1573
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:05,208
(growling)

1574
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:09,250
(screaming)

1575
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:17,208
I'm coming!

1576
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:21,000
(growling)

1577
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:21,375
No!

1578
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:22,958
Take your time!

1579
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:29,166
(screaming)

1580
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:43,708
You saved my life.

1581
01:12:53,291 --> 01:12:54,500
That's what friends do, Garrett.

1582
01:12:54,916 --> 01:12:55,666
(screaming)

1583
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,000
Hank, did you get the Earth Crystal?

1584
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:00,833
Yeah, I got it.

1585
01:13:00,916 --> 01:13:02,208
Let's get out of this hellhole!

1586
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:08,875
(suspenseful music)

1587
01:13:12,666 --> 01:13:14,541
Where do you think you're going?

1588
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:16,416
It's her!

1589
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,125
You dummies!

1590
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:19,833
You really thought you

1591
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:21,416
could defeat my great Hulk?

1592
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:25,125
News flash, I built a new one.

1593
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:27,458
(growling)

1594
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:28,458
Now go, sir!

1595
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,291
Your reign is over!

1596
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:31,666
You're wrong.

1597
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,416
It's just beginning.

1598
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:36,500
(growling)

1599
01:13:37,583 --> 01:13:37,708
No!

1600
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:39,875
No!

1601
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:42,041
Kill them!

1602
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:44,083
We have work to do.

1603
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:46,833
Goodbye, Steve!

1604
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:48,333
(laughing)

1605
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:55,041
Seeker piglins, they're

1606
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:56,583
gonna blow this bridge sky high!

1607
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:57,708
Sir, Hank.

1608
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:58,541
What?

1609
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,708
(screaming)

1610
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:05,083
Yeah!

1611
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:06,666
Slime cube!

1612
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:17,666
Come on, Garrett, drop!

1613
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:19,375
No, Steve, get him out of here!

1614
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:20,625
Go, Hank!

1615
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,458
Save your sister and get home!

1616
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,250
Garrett, you don't have to do this!

1617
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:25,625
No, get him home, Steve!

1618
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:27,791
Tell my story in song!

1619
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:30,000
Keep it metal, keep it heavy.

1620
01:14:30,625 --> 01:14:31,250
Real instruments.

1621
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:32,875
(growling)

1622
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,666
Besides, I love the house.

1623
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:40,416
Spanky!

1624
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:45,333
(screaming)

1625
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,333
(exploding)

1626
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:54,375
No!

1627
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:00,666
We're going down!

1628
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:01,750
No!

1629
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:03,916
Race for impact!

1630
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,958
(screaming)

1631
01:15:17,541 --> 01:15:17,875
Dennis.

1632
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:20,083
(laughing)

1633
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:24,291
Dennis?

1634
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:24,958
Yes?

1635
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:26,500
Dennis!

1636
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:28,458
Oh, it's you!

1637
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:29,958
It's really you!

1638
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:34,416
(laughing)

1639
01:15:34,791 --> 01:15:36,166
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,

1640
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:40,083
Oh, how'd you find me?

1641
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:41,416
He's one heck of a wolf.

1642
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:43,416
He led us right to you guys.

1643
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:44,833
Now I understand why you

1644
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:45,666
kept yourself so filthy

1645
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:46,833
and smelly so Dennis

1646
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,000
could find you one day.

1647
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:50,083
Is he okay?

1648
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:50,958
He's fine.

1649
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:52,125
He's just resting.

1650
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:53,333
Good.

1651
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:55,458
It's a pretty rough crash landing.

1652
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:58,083
Wait a minute, where are we?

1653
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:04,666
You guys both hate this?

1654
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:07,333
Y'all, we're not messing around.

1655
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:08,958
We got the silk touch.

1656
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:09,708
No luck, er!

1657
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,625
(splashing)

1658
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:12,666
All right.

1659
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:15,750
I was so afraid that I lost you.

1660
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,208
I was so afraid that I lost you too.

1661
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:23,250
I'm really sorry about Garrett.

1662
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:32,958
(screaming)

1663
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,000
We think all about dark in the overworld

1664
01:16:36,583 --> 01:16:38,625
Nether what will spread like wildfire

1665
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:41,500
Then all its gold will be ours

1666
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:57,583
(screaming)

1667
01:16:57,583 --> 01:17:00,750
(screaming)

1668
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:09,833
Get in front of me!

1669
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:12,708
(explosion)

1670
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:14,125
It has begun.

1671
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:15,875
The great darkening.

1672
01:17:16,958 --> 01:17:18,708
Melgosa's gathering all her forces.

1673
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:20,583
She will destroy this land.

1674
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:24,000
Unless we go get that orb.

1675
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,750
Well, what are we doing here?

1676
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:28,916
Let's go fight some pigs.

1677
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:29,833
I'm ready.

1678
01:17:30,666 --> 01:17:31,541
I'm done with those pigs.

1679
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:32,500
Yeah, me too.

1680
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:33,916
Let's do it for Gaga.

1681
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,125
First we mine, then we craft.

1682
01:17:37,916 --> 01:17:38,541
Let's Minecraft!

1683
01:17:39,208 --> 01:17:39,500
Fight!

1684
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,041
One, two, three.

1685
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:42,208
Get the orb!

1686
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:43,291
What are you saying?

1687
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:43,541
Minecraft.

1688
01:17:43,916 --> 01:17:45,541
We should all say that on three.

1689
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:46,916
Forget it, there's no time!

1690
01:17:48,583 --> 01:17:49,791
Show us what you got, Henry.

1691
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,541
Okay, I've got a plan.

1692
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:52,666
Killer recipes.

1693
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
We're gonna have to move fast.

1694
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:55,041
Let's get to work.

1695
01:17:56,916 --> 01:17:58,500
First, we're gonna need iron ingots.

1696
01:17:59,166 --> 01:17:59,916
Coming in hot.

1697
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:03,666
Ow!

1698
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:04,958
Oh yeah!

1699
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:08,250
We're gonna need the boots of swiftness.

1700
01:18:09,958 --> 01:18:12,458
Time to light this place up.

1701
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:14,041
Come on, boys.

1702
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:18,208
Have a nice ride!

1703
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:21,708
Oh!

1704
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:23,000
Whoa!

1705
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:27,333
We need a ton of diamonds.

1706
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:33,500
And blades for days.

1707
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:37,916
You want some, buddy?

1708
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:41,666
(dramatic music)

1709
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:44,791
We're ready.

1710
01:18:45,166 --> 01:18:46,541
Let's go save the overworld.

1711
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:54,291
Listen up, my piggies.

1712
01:18:56,625 --> 01:19:01,125
Today, we take the overworld as ours.

1713
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:05,625
Attack their villages, burn their homes,

1714
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:07,791
and their symmetrical files.

1715
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:11,875
All they have created, we destroy!

1716
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:18,666
Well, what are you standing around for?

1717
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:20,166
Get out of here!

1718
01:19:20,416 --> 01:19:22,166
Go on, destroy something!

1719
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:28,916
(dramatic music)

1720
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:34,208
Hey, Henry!

1721
01:19:38,791 --> 01:19:41,500
(dramatic music)

1722
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:10,500
(growling)

1723
01:20:11,833 --> 01:20:14,250
News flash, iron golems will

1724
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,875
not attack unless provoked.

1725
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:17,291
Ha ha ha!

1726
01:20:19,125 --> 01:20:26,500
Real smooth, Travis!

1727
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,375
(dramatic music)

1728
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,708
(growling)

1729
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:46,625
Ready?

1730
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:49,416
Let's do this.

1731
01:20:58,041 --> 01:21:03,875
Oh, for goodness sake!

1732
01:21:04,541 --> 01:21:06,500
Enjoying the show, are you?

1733
01:21:06,916 --> 01:21:08,458
Get down there and take

1734
01:21:08,458 --> 01:21:09,958
care of those roundlings!

1735
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:12,375
(growling)

1736
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:15,291
(laughing)

1737
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,125
Daddy like them pork chops!

1738
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:24,375
(growling)

1739
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:34,583
(dramatic music)

1740
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:36,833
Ho ho ho ho!

1741
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:44,791
Okay, Gosh, let's dance.

1742
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:46,000
Bring it on!

1743
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:50,083
(screaming)

1744
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:53,083
Giggity-o!

1745
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:58,666
(screaming)

1746
01:21:59,625 --> 01:21:59,833
Ha!

1747
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:08,541
My diamond armor!

1748
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:10,125
I think it's hot!

1749
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:12,000
Friends!

1750
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:14,458
What is this?

1751
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:15,166
A great festival!

1752
01:22:15,916 --> 01:22:16,500
(screaming)

1753
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:18,875
Get off of me!

1754
01:22:21,291 --> 01:22:22,750
Honey, the earth's up there!

1755
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:28,041
(dramatic music)

1756
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:37,500
Do it, Henry!

1757
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:39,000
I got this!

1758
01:22:49,708 --> 01:22:50,541
Go, Henry, go!

1759
01:22:55,250 --> 01:23:01,541
(screaming)

1760
01:23:04,208 --> 01:23:05,666
Hey, Captain Buckcrack!

1761
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:10,791
I got something for you!

1762
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:16,291
Get a dence.

1763
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:28,291
Woo, quick, man, I'm not big!

1764
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:30,750
Finish this, Henry!

1765
01:23:34,916 --> 01:23:38,000
(growling)

1766
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:38,833

Henry!

1769
01:23:59,583 --> 01:23:59,791
Go!

1770
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:08,750

(Shelbyben screams)

1773
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:13,875
Oh, yeah!

1774
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:20,166
(Shelby Music)

1775
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:22,833
You're alive!

1776
01:24:25,291 --> 01:24:26,875
Between us, I use

1777
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,208
Steve's water bucket trick.

1778
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:29,416
Pretty cool, huh?

1779
01:24:30,208 --> 01:24:30,708
A little bit.

1780
01:24:31,416 --> 01:24:32,666
Let's get this so I can go home.

1781
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:35,958
[screaming]

1782
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:39,791
All right, Hank, it's fireball time.

1783
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,000
Grab that spear.

1784
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:43,458
I want you to jab it in the tent of this.

1785
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:45,666
[screaming]

1786
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:46,833
Jab it!

[explosion]

1788
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,125
Yeah!

1789
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:52,333
How'd you learn how to do that?

1790
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:53,250
Oh, yeah.

1791
01:24:53,250 --> 01:25:04,041

No!

1795
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:21,125
What have you done?

1796
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:22,791
Nio!

Oh, my God!

[explosion] Oh, God!

1804
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:04,666
Good to see you, garbage man.

1805
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,041
[music playing]

1806
01:26:08,041 --> 01:26:08,250

[music playing]

1808
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:10,541
Ah!

01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:19,833
You failed, witch.

1813
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:22,416
The overworld lives on.

1814
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,208
You, too, have fallen for the great lie.

1815
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:27,500
You'll never be happy.

1816
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,583
Deep down, you know.

1817
01:26:30,333 --> 01:26:32,166
To hope, to dream, to

1818
01:26:32,166 --> 01:26:33,916
create is to suffer.

1819
01:26:34,333 --> 01:26:34,875
You're right.

1820
01:26:35,875 --> 01:26:38,166
It is harder to create than to destroy.

1821
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:40,208
That's why cowards

1822
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:42,041
tend to choose the deuce.

1823
01:26:42,791 --> 01:26:43,083
Nah.

1824
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:44,791
Later, gauche.

1825
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:47,541
Every minute knowing you has been a

1826
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:49,250
horror show waste of time.

1827
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:51,833
Wait!

1828
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:52,333
Wrong thing.

1829
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:54,208
Come closer.

1830
01:26:55,041 --> 01:26:56,625
Do you have a little knife that you're

1831
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:57,625
gonna try to stab me with?

1832
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,708
No, no, I'm too weak.

1833
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:01,625
[snoring]

1834
01:27:01,625 --> 01:27:02,250
All right.

1835
01:27:04,208 --> 01:27:04,583
Ah!

1836
01:27:04,833 --> 01:27:05,500
Come on!

1837
01:27:06,416 --> 01:27:07,250
It was worth a shot.

1838
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:09,458
Wait, wait, leave me say one more thing.

1839
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:10,333
Come closer.

1840
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:11,166
No way!

1841
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,000
No, really, it's about you.

1842
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:15,208
Fine.

1843
01:27:16,166 --> 01:27:17,083
[music playing]

1844

Ooh!

01:27:22,416 --> 01:27:23,916
You really are the worst.

1848
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:25,791
Goodbye.

1849
01:27:26,583 --> 01:27:28,291
This isn't really-- come back!

1850
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:29,916
I don't even have a knife.

1851
01:27:30,416 --> 01:27:31,375
Where would I keep it?

1852
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:33,958

Hey!

1856
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:48,500
You sure you want to go back, Henry?

1857
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:50,833
It won't feel like this.

1858
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:52,666
There you got

1859
01:27:52,666 --> 01:27:57,000
constraints, judgments, obstacles.

1860
01:27:57,875 --> 01:27:58,250
Yeah, I know.

1861
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:00,375
But I'm gonna go make stuff anyway.

1862
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:04,625
I like that.

Hey.

1864
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:07,708
You're a brave kid.

1865
01:28:09,208 --> 01:28:12,000
Steve, you still cool with this?

1866
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:13,208
Huh?

1867
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:15,833
Yeah.

1868
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:17,458
Come here, boy.

1869
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:18,833
Yeah.

1870
01:28:20,416 --> 01:28:22,416
Of course I still love you.

1871
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,625
That's why I think this is a good idea.

1872
01:28:25,791 --> 01:28:27,125
You changed my life.

1873
01:28:28,875 --> 01:28:30,541
It's time for you to go change hers, too.

1874
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:31,541
Huh?

1875
01:28:32,666 --> 01:28:35,083
Go now, Dennis.

1876
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:39,000
Change Don's life, Dennis.

1877
01:28:39,291 --> 01:28:44,583
Go on a journey and think of me.

1878
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:46,291
Dennis.

1879
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:51,916
Go now, legendary wolf of my dreams.

01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:10,250
you could sing like that,

1887
01:29:10,458 --> 01:29:12,125
it would help me get past your smell.

1888
01:29:15,875 --> 01:29:18,583
Garrett, you are a

1889
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:19,791
truly bodacious warrior

1890
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:22,125
and a really good friend.

1891
01:29:23,708 --> 01:29:25,041
I wish you'd come home with us.

1892
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:29,625
Hangs cool, but I don't

1893
01:29:29,625 --> 01:29:31,875
have any friends my age.

1894
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:39,666
You would make a great team.

1895
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:46,166
Biocontius, it means goodbye, brother.

1896
01:29:47,541 --> 01:29:47,916
No, it doesn't.

1897
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:51,208
Don't look at her. It does.

1898
01:29:51,666 --> 01:29:52,750
No, it does not.

1899
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:54,333
Yeah, it does.

1900
01:29:57,875 --> 01:29:58,500
Love you guys.

1901
01:29:59,625 --> 01:30:00,916
Are you sure you don't want to come back?

1902
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:03,125
Yeah, I'm staying here.

1903
01:30:03,125 --> 01:30:04,750
I got a bunch more stuff I want to build.

1904
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:07,375
Why don't you bring some of

1905
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:08,333
that magic to the real world?

1906
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:29,541
[wind howling]

1907
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:32,208
Screw it. I'm coming with.

1908
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:34,166
[dramatic music]

1909
01:30:35,666 --> 01:30:37,541
Turns out the overworld taught us

1910
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:39,500
you can create the life you dream of.

1911
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:42,000
Even in the real world.

1912
01:30:42,958 --> 01:30:43,666
Garrett's store became

1913
01:30:43,666 --> 01:30:45,000
the hottest place in town.

1914
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:47,666
And the best part? His

1915
01:30:47,666 --> 01:30:49,041
new friends were never far.

1916
01:30:50,666 --> 01:30:52,208
So with Henry and Natalie's help,

1917
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:53,791
we created the hit game

1918
01:30:53,791 --> 01:30:55,791
"Block City Battle Buddies."

1919
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:58,250
All that time in the

1920
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:00,500
overworld upped everyone's game.

1921
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:05,291
And every Friday, I would let it rip.

1922
01:31:06,083 --> 01:31:08,000
Yeah! Yeah!

1923
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:12,250
I used to wake up and play

1924
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:14,125
back in my childhood days

1925
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:16,958
Getting old is such a dirty shame

1926
01:31:17,791 --> 01:31:19,250
They never gave me a chance

1927
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:21,833
I had to let my imagination dance

1928
01:31:22,083 --> 01:31:24,416
Hell, I came up with a different game

1929
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,750
Down in the mines all of the time

1930
01:31:29,125 --> 01:31:32,416
Renting out the sun, having some fun

1931
01:31:32,875 --> 01:31:36,541
Laughing, I'm never ever looking back

1932
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:38,958
Cause I feel like

1933
01:31:40,541 --> 01:31:40,750
Yeah!

1934
01:31:42,791 --> 01:31:43,791
Dawn finally got to

1935
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:45,000
ditch her real estate job.

1936
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:47,125
She and Dennis brought the

1937
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:48,458
party wherever they went.

1938
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:51,916
Natalie decided to share her new skill

1939
01:31:51,916 --> 01:31:53,250
set with the real world.

1940
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,500
Survival mode, self-defense!

1941
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:01,166
The streets of Chugless

1942
01:32:01,166 --> 01:32:02,416
have never been safer.

1943
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:03,916
You get them, Natalie!

1944
01:32:05,458 --> 01:32:07,541
And Henry? He finally

1945
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:09,208
got that jetpack to work.

1946
01:32:09,541 --> 01:32:11,125
I'm gonna fly in the sky

1947
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:16,541
I feel alive

1948
01:32:17,625 --> 01:32:20,583
I move mountains with my mind

1949
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,083
I feel alive

1950
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:28,000
Like a new moon on the rise

1951
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:31,500
I feel alive

1952
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:35,666
Like a redstone over dry eyed

1953
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,875
I feel alive

1954
01:32:39,291 --> 01:32:42,500
With the power of the world inside

1955
01:32:44,291 --> 01:32:46,541
I feel alive

1956
01:32:48,083 --> 01:32:48,291
Yeah!

1957
01:33:01,958 --> 01:33:05,708
I know how much you love bread.

1958
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:10,250
Marlene, your ex-husband's here. He said

1959
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:10,916
it was an emergency.

1960
01:33:11,291 --> 01:33:13,083
Well, you tell him. I've

1961
01:33:13,083 --> 01:33:14,875
got nothing to say to him.

1962
01:33:15,375 --> 01:33:16,458
You gotta be kidding me,

1963
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:18,000
Marlene. This is the guy?

1964
01:33:18,541 --> 01:33:21,416
Too late, Clemente. You had your chance.

1965
01:33:21,708 --> 01:33:22,458
She's right,

1966
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:24,625
Clemente. You totally blew it.

1967
01:33:24,958 --> 01:33:26,625
And now I reap the

1968
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:28,541
rewards of your mistake.

1969
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:31,375
You see, when Marlene's Jeep Grand

1970
01:33:31,375 --> 01:33:32,916
Cherokee ran me over,

1971
01:33:33,291 --> 01:33:35,666
I was struck by a love so powerful,

1972
01:33:36,083 --> 01:33:38,041
it transcended the barriers of

1973
01:33:38,041 --> 01:33:39,333
conventional speech.

1974
01:33:40,125 --> 01:33:41,875
Now I speak human and

1975
01:33:41,875 --> 01:33:43,416
she speaks villager.

1976
01:33:43,625 --> 01:33:53,958
Marlene, ever since we met last night,

1977
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:57,125
I wanted to say, would you marry me?

1978
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:02,250
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes.
