00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:32,490
But I can be whomever you want me to be.

195
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,460
Anything can happen here.

196
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,100
Why would I do that?

197
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:44,820
Why would I listen to you?

198
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,820
I’ve seen this before.

199
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,040
Who are?

200
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,630
If you’re truly special and have a purpose,

201
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,770
why don’t you jump down this cliff?

202
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:08,210
Won’t you be saved from harm since it’s not your time.

203
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,360
This is not funny.

204
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,810
I’m here to help you.

205
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,200
Yeah, I don’t believe.

206
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Jump.

207
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,750
Where did he go?

208
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,930
Why did he do that?

209
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:27,510
Okay, breathe.

210
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,500
Focus.

211
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:45,750
[Mary] There you are.

212
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,640
[young Price] But, mother why are you so surprised?

213
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,630
Aren’t I suppose to be about my father’s business?

214
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:23,440
My father’s business.

215
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:23,950
That’s why you’re here

216
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:31,050
Price.

217
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:34,050
That’s why you’re here.

218
00:32:55,510 --> 00:33:00,660
I’ve got to rest.

219
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:04,660
Just for a few minutes.

220
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,760
Price!

221
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,030
Price.

222
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:57,430
Price, remember where you come from.

223
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,210
It’s not about you.

224
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,190
It’s about Him.

225
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,070
It’s you again.

226
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,590
He has assigned you as my messenger?

227
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,100
He has,

228
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,660
and what you’re enduring can be endured through him.

229
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:18,840
You words are comforting and much needed.

230
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,540
I’ll do my best to move on.

231
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,720
Once you’re done here you are to tell the others.

232
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,080
Everyone that believes will have peace.

233
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,680
Show them how to overcome the madness in the world.

234
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,680
There is power in what is good.

235
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:32,675
[eerie sound]

236
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,420
[eerie piano] It’s you!

237
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,900
You look surprised.

238
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,850
We passed you awhile back, you saw us.

239
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:04,780
I…

240
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,780
Oh,

241
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,440
you thought you were alone.

242
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,270
Alone, yes.

243
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:12,470
Come on, you'll be surprised

244
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,760
you’re not alone.

245
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,420
No, it's okay, I’m good.

246
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,500
But you’re already here.

247
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,790
What do you mean I’m already here?

248
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,790
Look around.

249
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:36,830
You’ve reached

250
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:46,670
66 & 6 miles.

251
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:50,000
How wonderful it is to have it all.

252
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,870
To be in control of

253
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:58,890
everything and everybody.

254
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,100
This can happen.

255
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,840
I can make this happen.

256
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,320
Uh, no.

257
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,440
This

258
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,520
is not what He sent me for.

259
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:18,320
Why go about your father’s business when you can go about your own.

260
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,430
About my own business.

261
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:28,300
Look at what you can have.

262
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:34,520
Control.

263
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,670
I can make this happen.

264
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:44,970
The prize is within your reach.

265
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,970
Let me show you.

266
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,310
What are these people?

267
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:21,280
Are you ready to find out?

268
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,230
I don’t think I want to do that.

269
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,450
You don’t need to worry.

270
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,680
No one here is going to hurt you.

271
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,860
Why do you think they’re reaching out to you.

272
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,400
I don’t know? t.

273
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,890
They don’t seem righ

274
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,030
Sit,

275
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:42,150
to the left of me

276
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:47,510
and I’ll show you who they are.

277
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,580
No,

278
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,580
I think you can do that from here.

279
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,840
Let’s start from the beginning.

280
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:15,050
The world is a beautiful place.

281
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:15,640
With all of its

282
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:24,210
riches,

283
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:30,250
land,

284
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:37,210
soil,

285
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:46,030
nature is formed.

286
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,030
The birth of all things.

287
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,280
I can vouch for it

288
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,510
because I was there

289
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,270
I was always there

290
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:17,200
and I always will be.

291
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,540
But you can have all of this.

292
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:25,220
Power,

293
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:29,280
control,

294
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,280
wealth,

295
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,510
I’m coming

296
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:46,280
and have already been here.

297
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,390
Little signs here and there of

298
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,400
people doing this and that.

299
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:59,720
All a distraction of what’s to come.

300
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,880
Not you or anyone can change that.

301
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,530
There is an end to everything.

302
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,800
No one but my father.

303
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,130
I know Him,

304
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,070
I'm from Him

305
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,360
and He

306
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:27,350
sent me.

307
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:34,350
[eerie sounds]

308
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,460
Hey!

309
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:57,470
Are you okay?

310
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:07,340
[eerie sounds]

311
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,110
I see them!

312
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:12,340
Drive.

313
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:22,330
[music]

314
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:32,330
[music]

315
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:42,330
[piano]

316
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:52,330
[piano]
