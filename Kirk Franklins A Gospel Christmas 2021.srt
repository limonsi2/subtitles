A young woman
who has committed herself

54
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,864
to the service of people
here at Bethel.

55
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,606
Everything from preaching
in my absence,

56
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:56,176
to organizing ministries.
She is your assistant pastor.

When were you gonna tell me?

68
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,431
Sweetheart, we've been talking
about this for years.

69
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:36,172
I'm not ready, mom, there's
still so much I have to learn--

70
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:38,130
Livi, Livi, stop, stop.

71
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,481
God has prepared you for this.

72
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:43,745
Your father and I have given you
everything that you need.

73
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:46,008
Trust and believe in you.

74
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,358
I'm not sure if I can.

75
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:50,578
Then trust in God.

76
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:54,756
And believe in your mama,
I got your back.

77
00:03:54,843 --> 00:04:00,109
Listen, listen, it's a small
church in a small town.

78
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:03,547
God has given you the gift
of leadership and service.

79
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:06,028
Go serve the King.

80
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:09,118
Besides, that's in your blood.

81
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:13,775
Going all the way back
to your great-great-grandfather.

82
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:19,868
Okay.

83
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:26,309
What's the name of the church?

84
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,137
-You ready?
-No.

85
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:30,618
[chuckles]

86
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:33,273
Genesis Baptist Church.

87
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:36,798
-New beginnings.
-Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:38,800
I like that.

89
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:41,498
Wait, how did you even find out
about the position?

90
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:44,893
Miss Corrine, a friend of mine
from my Spelman days.

91
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,938
She and I got to chatting
about a few things,

92
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:49,071
and one thing lead to another.

93
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:51,987
And here we are.

94
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:56,557
Okay. When do I leave?

95
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:58,733
-Two days.
-Two days?

96
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,256
I'm gonna miss Christmas!

97
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:03,433
I know.

98
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:11,528
Daddy, how am I supposed
to pack up my entire life

99
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:13,661
in two days?

100
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:16,490
Just take what you need,
and we'll send the rest later.

101
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:25,673
Livi, talk to me, sweetheart.

102
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:28,632
-What's going on?
-I'm so used to assisting mom.

103
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,678
Not actually being her.

104
00:05:32,593 --> 00:05:37,859
Hm, that's the thing,
you are not her, you're you.

105
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,993
And this church
will love you for you.

106
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:45,083
-[door shuts]
-Who's hungry?

107
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,303
I bought someone's favorite.

108
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,350
I know that smell a mile away.

109
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:51,873
Yes! Thank you!

110
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:54,049
Livi...

111
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:57,922
I have something
very special just for you.

112
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:00,360
The family Bible.

113
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:04,451
This Bible has been passed down

114
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:08,324
to each pastor in our family
for generations.

115
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:13,851
Your Grandpa Wesley
gave me this Bible

116
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:16,506
when I first started
preaching and singing,

117
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:19,074
and now I'm giving it to you.

118
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:21,859
The next singing-pastor in line!

119
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,905
Can we just stick to pastor?

120
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:27,517
Livi, stop denying your roots.

121
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:29,737
You can't let one moment
stronghold you

122
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:31,521
for the rest of your life.

123
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:32,827
It was a very traumatic moment,
mom.

124
00:06:32,957 --> 00:06:34,916
Then go tell it, Livi.

125
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:38,310
Let it set you free.

126
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,922
But you are a singing pastor.

127
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:45,361
[Olivia] "Let your faith be
bigger than your fears."

128
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:48,320
Ah, Hebrews 13:6.

129
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:50,671
Actually, mom,
I think the scripture reads,

130
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:53,587
"The Lord is my helper,
I will not be afraid."

131
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:58,548
It's the essence
of the scripture.

132
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:03,379
See, you were born to lead.

133
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:06,121
Always remember that.
And sing.

134
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,906
-Mom.
-Unh-uh. Mm-mm.

135
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:11,561
Bring it in, come on.

136
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:13,955
Bring it in, hug your mama.

137
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:18,655
-I love you.

But everybody calls me Miss Dee.

Let me be the first to welcome
you to Greenwood, Texas.

We're small, but mighty!

-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-Uh-hmm.

169
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:09,984
The decorations are fantastic!

170
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:12,029
That just warms my heart,
Pastor.

171
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:13,814
-You did this?
-Yes, ma'am.

172
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,772
Not only am I the
administrative assistant,

173
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:18,079
but I'm also
the resident decorator.

174
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,777
I wear a lot of hats
around here, pastor.

00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:31,179
Now, let me show you
to your office.

180
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:32,746
Okay.

181
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:38,360
Well, normally, I handle
the day-to-day operations

182
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,014
so that you can just focus
on the ministries

183
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:41,363
and grow our church.

184
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,191
Well, that was the agreement

185
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:44,801
between Pastor Byrd and me.

186
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:47,412
It's totally okay
if you wanna change it.

187
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:49,284
Oh, no, no.
In the spirit of Pastor Byrd,

188
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:52,287
let's, let's just keep it
the way it is.

189
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:55,682
Do miss that man.
He was a great pastor.

190
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:57,597
Big shoes to fill.

191
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,948
But you'll be all right.

192
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,299
Here's your office, pastor.

193
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:10,610
Oh.

194
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,662
[chuckles]

195
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:22,012
Welcome to your new office,
pastor.

196
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,753
I got a little fun and free
back here.

197
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,104
It's, it's so festive.

198
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:29,977
Thank you, pastor! I was so
proud of the way it turned out.

199
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:31,718
I had to put it
on the social medias.

200
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,328
It's just a little more
than I anticipated.

201
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:36,940
I-I'm more simple,

202
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:39,813
modest, clean lines, you know.

203
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,293
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

204
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:43,730
Oh, don't worry about that,

205
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,123
Brother Carl is working
on your name plate.

206
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:49,910
That's Pastor Byrd.
I'm so sorry.

207
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,565
-I'll take it out immediately.
-It's okay.

208
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,264
-And this?
-That's the Winter Jamboree.

209
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:58,092
It's the highlight of
Greenwood's Christmas season.

210
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:00,747
Every Christmas Eve,
Genesis opens up the festival.

211
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:03,227
-It's tradition!
-I love tradition.

212
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:05,577
Gonna miss mine this year.

213
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,405
Well, who said you couldn't
bring your tradition

214
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:10,060
to Greenwood, pastor?
What's your favorite tradition?

215
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:12,759
-The Christmas party.
-Oh, I love a good party.

216
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:14,021
We're gonna circle back
around to that.

217
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:17,633
Okay. Did Pastor Byrd
direct the choir?

218
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,635
Oh, pastor, our choir was fire!

219
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,550
Pastor Byrd took great pride
in it.

220
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:25,032
Next to the Almighty himself,
music was his true love.

221
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:29,427
-A singing pastor.
-Oh, he did it all.

222
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,995
But I know you got this!

223
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:34,694
[whispering] I don't know, God.

224
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:38,436
-You say something, pastor?
-U-um, uh-hmm.

225
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:41,875
-The parsonage?
-Oh, yes! Well... no.

226
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:44,268
There was no saving
the parsonage.

227
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:47,228
So until we find you a place,
you're staying with me.

228
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:49,970
-Oh, no, um, miss, miss--
-No, ma'am.

229
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,233
It's settled.

230
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:58,369
Oh, what has momma done.

231
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:05,246
[bell rings]

232
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:09,424
[indistinct chatter]

233
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:18,607
Welcome to Selah's.
What can I do you for?

234
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:20,914
Well, I hear you have
the best burger in town.

235
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,785
-And you heard right.
-Nice.

236
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:24,221
-With or without cheese?
-Without.

237
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,093
Coming right up. Uh...

238
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:28,922
Your money's no good here,
pastor.

239
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:32,099
[chuckles] It's a small town.
Word travels quick.

240
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:34,623
It'll be up in a minute.
Find yourself a seat.

241
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,581
Thank you.

242
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:41,064
Pastor Olivia?

243
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:43,023
[chuckles] Care to join me?

244
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:46,287
Sure.

245
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:51,596
[instrumental music]

246
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:56,863
I didn't expect to see you again
so soon.

247
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:01,476
I wasn't looking for you,
I'm-I'm just saying...

248
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:02,912
Y-you... Yeah.

249
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:04,131
Well, this is a small town,

250
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:05,523
I'll probably see you
two more times

251
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:06,829
by the end of the night.

252
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,178
Really?

253
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:11,834
-Stella, this is--
-Pastor Olivia.

254
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,705
Come on, Ashton, catch up!

255
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,274
-Now, you two, enjoy.
-Thank you.

256
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:23,933
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

257
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:29,199
Oh, so you... You gonna eat that
with a knife and fork?

258
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,506
It's a burger.
You're supposed to pick it up

259
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:34,901
with your hands
and bite into it.

260
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,818
Ooh, look at the...
You have a...

261
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,732
-It's supposed to be messy.
-Uh-huh.

262
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,823
I would prefer to keep my sauce
on my burger.

263
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:45,868
[chuckles]

264
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,609
Whatever.

265
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,611
I can get you a knife and fork
if you really want.

266
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:51,961
Uh, no, thank you.

267
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,658
-You're somethin' else.
-Oh...

268
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:57,184
[laughing]

269
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:01,101
I was just like...

270
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:02,842
Oh, my God.

271
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:04,539
I didn't realize
how much time had passed.

272
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:06,497
I'm sure Miss Dee
is worried about me.

273
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:08,108
-You at Dee's?
-Yeah.

274
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:10,588
That's right around the corner.
I'll walk you.

275
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,852
-Okay.
-Okay.

276
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,727
So, what brings you
to Greenwood?

277
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,471
-[sighs] My mother.
-Mm.

278
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,777
Yeah, she got to talking with
her old Spelman friend,

279
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,606
Miss Corrine and, uh,

280
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:31,218
the two of them devised this
plan to get me here.

281
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:34,656
Wow, so your mother
and Miss Corrine

282
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:35,875
ain't give you an option?

283
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:38,878
-Nope.
-I know.

284
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:41,315
-No, no, no option there.
-No.

285
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:43,621
[instrumental music]

286
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,667
My mother does it
so effortlessly.

287
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:48,713
How am I supposed to be like
her? Or Pastor Byrd?

288
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:53,066
Just, just some
huge shoes to fill.

289
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:55,895
Well, maybe you're just supposed
to be like you.

290
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,986
I'm all too familiar with trying
to be something I'm not.

291
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:02,336
Oh. And what was that?

292
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:08,559
Well, lookie here,
we have arrived.

293
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,649
Pastor, it has been my pleasure
spending my afternoon with you.

294
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:13,869
Please just call me Olivia.

295
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,002
And the pleasure was all mine.

296
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,656
-Maybe I'll see you tomorrow?
-It's a small town.

297
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:21,181
[chuckles] Okay.

298
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:23,705
-Have a good evening.
-You, too.

[instrumental music]

300
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:37,806
-Pastor.
-[Olivia] J-just a moment!

301
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:43,246
Just making sure
you're comfortable.

302
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,640
-You need anything?
-No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

303
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:49,209
Okay. So, Ashton. A fan fav?

304
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:52,299
-Miss Dee!
-Oh, I'm not in your business.

305
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,214
I'm just nosey.

306
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:55,955
[laughs]

307
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,479
Hey, you rest well, pastor.

308
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:01,917
-I zhuzh'd it up a little.
-You did.

309
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:03,875
Oh. And don't forget your
leadership meeting tomorrow.

310
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,095
-9:00 A.M., sharp.
-Got it.

311
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:08,793

lost in her wilderness,
and seeking your guidance.

315
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:33,166
Teach me to lead like my mom.

forgot to call your momma.

to this ministry.

and to grow--

00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:39,640
about running a church,
assistant pastor?

351
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,599
-I'm here to try.
-Oh.

352
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,601
We ain't got no time to try.

353
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:47,213
Things need your attention.

354
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:49,084
This is the Christmas season,

355
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,478
everybody looks to the church
for leadership.

356
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,654
There's the Wrap It Up,
toy wrapping party,

357
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:56,178
the Ho-Ho-Ho Santa
can food drive...

358
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,701
Could you start over?
I just want to--

359
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:59,834
There's The Three Wisemen's
Mobile Meals...

360
00:18:59,964 --> 00:19:01,314
The Winter Jamboree!

361
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:03,664
I was about to say that, Stella!

362
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:08,538
And the Winter Jamboree, which
is our premiere Christmas event.

363
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:12,499
Oh, and don't forget the
paperwork, assistant pastor.

364
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:14,457
The Jamboree's in five weeks.

365
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:19,027
You fail the Jamboree,
you fail the church.

366
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:22,204
And remember,
this is your trial period.

367
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,685
You ain't got the job yet.

368
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:26,513
We'll determine that
by the New Year.

369
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:30,952
Oh, and the "Sent from an Angel"
Holiday cards.

370
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:33,433
-Holiday cards?
-For our sick and shut-in.

371
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,131
[Ida] Carl!

372
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:39,526
I'm working on that name plate,
pastor. Okay?

373
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:42,093
Brother Carl, her husband.

374
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,313
Thank you. Thank you.

375
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:53,104
Don't pay Ida any mind.

376
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,716
-She's grieving.
-I'm on a trial period?

377
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:59,110
Yes. All new pastors
have a short trial period.

378
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,852
Make sure we're a good fit,
is all.

379
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:03,680
You'll win Sister Ida over.

380
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,075
You got this.

381
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,818
Thank you.

382
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,214
Do I?

383
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:22,395
[instrumental music]

384
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,576
[sighs] Perfect.

385
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:34,624
Well, why don't we just let
nature take its course?

386
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:37,497
-[chuckles] Uh-hmm.
-[door opens]

387
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:39,194
Ooh, got to go.

388
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:43,372
Pastor Olivia Richard!

389
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:46,549
If you aren't
the spitting image of Etta!

390
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,769
Miss Corrine?

391
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:50,553
So, how you liking
old Greenwood?

392
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,773
I'm adjusting. It's cute.

393
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,906
It's really small.

394
00:20:56,037 --> 00:21:00,476
Honey, I can't wait to hear you
bring a word on Sunday.

395
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:02,870
Hmm, I know you're gonna be
just as strong

396
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:05,046
and powerful as your mother.

397
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:09,050
Hmm, and ain't nothing like
a singing pastor.

398
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,445
-Singing?
-Uh, yes, ma'am.

399
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:15,622
The church wanted
another singing pastor.

400
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:19,016
And if you can sing
anything like your mother,

401
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:20,975
we gonna be all right.

402
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:23,630
Yes. Yes.

403
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,241
So, I hear you are
looking for a place?

404
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:29,157
-I am.
-Mom?

405
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,858
-Ashton?
-Oh!

406
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:36,991
So you're the reason

407
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:39,298
my son has been so smitten?

408
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:45,478
Ashton, Pastor Olivia
is looking for a place to stay.

409
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:51,484
I'll see you in church
on Sunday, pastor.

410
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:53,312
Yes, ma'am.

411
00:21:56,837 --> 00:21:58,273
Mother?

412
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:03,147
Okay, so you are a man
of many hats.

413
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:05,933
Man of many hats
at your service.

414
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:10,503
I have a few to show you.

415
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,291
[instrumental music]

416
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:21,514
Etta...

417
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,089
I have to sing
to keep my job, mom.

418
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:35,092
-Well, hello to you too, Livi.
-Why would you do that?

419
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:37,834
Why would you send me here
knowing I don't sing?

420
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:41,185
Livi, you do sing.
You come from a long line of--

421
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:43,710
Yeah, mom, I don't wanna
hear that, okay?

422
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,714
I'm not you. No one can be
the great Pastor Etta Richard.

423
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:50,325
Besides, they want to hear you
sing, not me!

424
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:52,458
No, they don't.

425
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:55,156
They wanna hear you sing.
Now, you, you may not like

426
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:56,766
how I got you to Greenwood,

427
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:58,507
but you're gonna have to face
this trauma.

428
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:00,335
You're gonna have to
look it in the eye.

429
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:03,730
You're gonna have to call it
out and rebuke it.

430
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,603
Sweetheart, you're hiding your
gift from the world.

431
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:11,215
I love you,
but right now, I just...

432
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:13,087
I gotta go.

433
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:26,883
I did not put my best foot
forward today.

434
00:23:27,014 --> 00:23:30,409
My mother has never been late
for a leadership meeting.

435
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:33,324
She always says, "The church is
a direct reflection

436
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:37,764
of its leadership,
inadequate Shepard, lost sheep."

437
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:40,593
Your mother is a
powerful preacher.

438
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:45,249
You've heard my mom preach?

439
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:49,515
Corrine dragged me to Chicago
a few times to hear her.

440
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:53,954
Now, your momma
can bring the word. And sing.

441
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,564
I can't wait to hear
that voice on you!

442
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:57,131
-I don't sing.
-Well, sure, you do.

443
00:23:57,261 --> 00:24:01,657
-I heard you.
-I don't... I don't sing.

444
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:04,355
♪ Jingle bells jingle bells ♪

445
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,663
♪ Jingle all the way... ♪

446
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:09,448
Help me out.

447
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,456
So, um...

448
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:19,109
I've been thinking
about that list

449
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,024
Sister Ida was rattling off,

450
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:23,026
and it's intimidating.

451
00:24:23,157 --> 00:24:24,811
I don't wanna fail the church.
And God knows,

452
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:27,248
I-I cannot fail my mom.

453
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:30,599
Look, you're right,

454
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,733
it's intimidating.

455
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,779
But you got a calling, pastor.

456
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:38,825
So, we'll take it
one step at a time.

457
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:42,306
-"We?"
-Yes.

458
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:45,571
I'm with you all the way.

459
00:24:45,658 --> 00:24:48,399
And don't think Pastor Byrd
had it all together.

460
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,185
His first year was a mess.
Girl, he almost quit.

461
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,667
Now, back to that list.

462
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:56,190
On Friday, Brother Carl's
gonna drop off

463
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,800
the box of Christmas cards.

464
00:24:57,887 --> 00:24:59,498
And the Christmas committee
has already organized

465
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:01,108
"The Wrap It Up"
toy wrapping party.

466
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:03,240
-That's next Saturday.
-Next Saturday. Okay.

467
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:06,766
-Just show up. Oh, on time.
-Mm-hmm.

468
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:09,812
[laughs]

469
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:14,817
Now, tell me about the sermon
you're preparing for Sunday.

470
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:16,602
Well...

471
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:22,216
it's about turning...

472
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:24,523
-Let the church say, Amen!
-Amen.

473
00:25:24,653 --> 00:25:26,916
Amen, Amen!
Before we begin,

474
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:28,788
I want to take a moment
to thank Miss Dee--

475
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:32,008
You're welcome, pastor.

476
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:33,749
Thank you so much, Miss Dee.

477
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,795
I understand
it is tradition for her

478
00:25:35,882 --> 00:25:38,798
to do the decorations
around the holidays.

479
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:41,496
I also understand it is
tradition to count down

480
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:43,454
to the glorious Jamboree!

481
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,544
[cheering]

482
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:51,288
Hallelujah! Now on that note,

483
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:54,204
the word says to "Make a joyful
noise unto the Lord."

484
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,337
[cheering]

485
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:57,730
It says to serve
the Lord with...

486
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:59,949
-Gladness!
-Hallelu...

487
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:02,082
It says to come before his
presence with singing.

488
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:04,084
Come on, choir,
bless us through song.

489
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:07,522
-All right, praise Jesus.
-Praise Jesus.

490
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:10,264
Yes, God!

514
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,886
What on God's green earth
are you doing?

515
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,888
-Here, let me help you.
-Ooh.

516
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:57,153
Just thought I would get a jump
on things and help pastor out.

517
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,678
Sister Ida gonna scare her off
before she can get started good.

518
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,636
-Sister Ida is grieving.
-No.

519
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:04,334
Sister Ida is mean.

520
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:06,336
And somebody should tell her.

521
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:09,731
Oh, no, honey, God's got to a
special angel for that one.

522
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:12,691
And He knows my heart
and I ain't it.

523
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:17,391
I thought pastor was gonna sing
during her sermon.

524
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:21,221
She will.
In God's time, not in our time.

525
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:25,399
Well, it's nice having
a female leader.

526
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,534
Is she gonna be okay?
Make it to the new year?

527
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:33,146
Yeah, just give her some time.

528
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:36,453
Just give her some time.
The Grinch need time, too.

529
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,629
Sister Ida.

530
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,719
[laughing]

531
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,246
[instrumental music]

532
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:50,946
Wait a minute.

533
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:53,644
Oh, my, that is beautiful.

534
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,603
[keys clacking]

535
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,747
Yes!

536
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:13,055
Oh, this house looks
even better in person.

537
00:29:13,142 --> 00:29:14,100
Let me help you up these stairs.

538
00:29:14,187 --> 00:29:15,841
Thank you.

539
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:17,407
Wow.

540
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:20,759
Wait until you see inside.

541
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:24,806
[gasps]

542
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:26,895
[chuckles]

543
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,773
[piano music]

544
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:39,603
Sold.

545
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,605
But you haven't even seen
the rest of the house yet.

546
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:43,172
No need.
I saw it all on Zillow.

547
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:45,566
But seriously,
walk through the house.

548
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:47,307
Take it all in.

549
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:00,973
Let's see what this old piano
can do.

00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:09,938

[applauds] You are amazing.

569
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,865
-Oh. I play a little.
-A little?

570
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:53,041
You should be sharing this gift
with the world.

571
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:56,827
Well, I should be. But maybe
God saw it differently.

572
00:31:56,958 --> 00:32:00,266
-That didn't work out.
-Oh, I can't believe that.

573
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:02,833
So, why didn't it work out?

574
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,705
What didn't work out?
The singing? The playing?

575
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:06,663
Because your gift--

576
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,796
Are you trying to pastor me
right now?

577
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:11,842
-Please don't.
-No, I-I...

578
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,193
I wasn't trying to pastor you.

579
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,108
I was genuinely interested.

580
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:19,981
I'm sorry.

581
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:21,809
You didn't deserve that.

582
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:26,335
I failed as a musician.

583
00:32:26,422 --> 00:32:29,121
My motto is
"You gotta be all in."

584
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,775
'Cause that's how you
gotta live life.

585
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:34,300
So, I moved to Houston,
and connected

586
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,171
with some of Auntie Ida's
old band members

587
00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:38,565
and started gigging.

588
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:40,175
Everything was going great.

589
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:43,744
We were making money,
packing the house,

590
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:45,267
working on a record deal.

591
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:48,314
And then the bottom fell out.

592
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:51,795
The deal just disappeared.

593
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:59,151
So, I turned to what I know,
Real Estate.

594
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:01,544
And I stayed in Houston
until I finally got that call,

595
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:05,548
"Your father is ready to retire,
turn the business over to you."

596
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,161
So started packing,
and now I'm here.

597
00:33:11,598 --> 00:33:12,991
I'm not mad to be home...

598
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:17,169
'cause dope things
can happen anywhere.

599
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:21,086
You just got to be open to it.

600
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:23,175
You didn't fail.

601
00:33:26,526 --> 00:33:29,485
-You should play with us.
-Play with who?

602
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:31,226
You should play for the church.

603
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:33,533
Yeah, the-the church needs
a choir director,

604
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,578
you need to be making music,
and I need somebody

605
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:38,407
to whip that choir into shape.
Come on!

606
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:40,322
I have not played
in that church in years.

607
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:42,107
Help me get ready
for the Jamboree

608
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:45,849
and get me one up on Sister Ida.

609
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:47,590
Who is your aunt!

610
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:50,985
You kept that close
to the chest there.

611
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:52,595
I feel like you owe me.

612
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:55,207
Where's your Christmas spirit?
Come on!

613
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:57,209
Please?

614
00:33:57,296 --> 00:33:59,559
Please? Please?

615
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:04,433
All in,
'cause that's how we gotta be.

616
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:05,913
Of course.

617
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:08,698
[indistinct chatter]

618
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:11,527
Hello! Woo-hoo!

619
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:14,443
This is not working.
Excuse me?

620
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:16,532
[piano music]

621
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:21,929
Thank you.

622
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:23,626
Brother Carl,
would you please do the honors?

623
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:25,933
[clears throat]
Uh, yes.

624
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,328
We got to talking and decided
it would be ideal

625
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:31,982
if Brother Ashton would take
over as the choir director.

626
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:33,984
[applause]

627
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,161
Thankfully, I'm going to retire

628
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:38,728
back to the tenor section
where I belong.

629
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:40,991
[woman 1] Amen!

630
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,777
[indistinct chatter]

631
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:46,432
Okay, then I guess
you got it from here.

632
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:49,565
Godspeed. You have about three
weeks, but no pressure.

633
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:53,830
You got this!

634
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:57,138
Well, I thought we'd start off
with an old hymn.

635
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:59,488
-Knock knock! Howdy, pastor?
-How's the choir?

636
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:01,490
-Here you go.
-Oh, wait, you...

637
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:03,623
You were supposed to deliver
those last Friday.

638
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,973
-It's Tuesday.
-I'm late.

639
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:09,846
-Whoa, whoa, what're you doing?
-Oh.

640
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:13,981
Sister Ida wants this box back.
Sorry, pastor.

641
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:15,591
How many sick and shut-in
do we have?

642
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:18,028
-Pastor.
-What?

643
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:20,422
There's a deluge
in the women's restroom.

644
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:24,078
-A what? No!
-A flood. A flood.

645
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:26,646
No, no, no, no, no, no!

646
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:32,304
[instrumental music]

647
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:40,790
God, this cannot be happening.

648
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:44,403
The Christmas toy wrapping party
is on Saturday, and I can't...

649
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:48,798
You tired of playing pastor,
yet, assistant pastor?

650
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,246
[instrumental music]

651
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:04,031
Pastor, I am so glad
you decided to move

652
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,034
this toy wrapping party
to the community center.

653
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,472
It's so refreshing
for the community to see...

654
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:12,213
the church doing such good work.

655
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,955
I can't believe the church
donated all of these toys.

656
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:17,436
Hey, each year it keeps growing
bigger and bigger.

657
00:36:17,523 --> 00:36:20,134
It's crazy, just five years ago
Auntie Ida started this drive.

658
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:23,659
Wait, Sister Ida
started the toy drive?

659
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,922
Yep, a little girl
walked up to her,

660
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:27,881
asked her for some change
for her family.

661
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:29,361
Auntie says she looked around,
realized

662
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:31,754
she was in the middle
of a homeless encampment.

663
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:35,497
There was a small Christmas tree
and Nativity scene.

664
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:37,760
And right then she just knew.

665
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:40,198
-Sister Ida?
-Mm-hmm!

666
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:43,331
Yeah, she just bought up
a bunch of toys,

667
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:45,681
gave some to the little girl and
started passing out the rest

668
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:47,074
to the church members in need.

669
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:48,554
[Ashton]
Yeah, kinda of became a thing.

670
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:50,251
We...

671
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:52,122
We're talking about that,
that one,

672
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:54,995
that Sister Ida started this?

673
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:56,736
-She's grieving.
-She's grieving.

674
00:36:57,954 --> 00:36:59,913
Okay, Sister Ida.

675
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:05,614
Excuse me, everyone,
if I could have your attention

676
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:07,573
for a moment?

677
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:13,492
When I found out
that the toy wrapping party

678
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:16,408
was a Genesis tradition,
it warmed my heart.

679
00:37:16,538 --> 00:37:20,803
And it really made me miss the
Christmas traditions from home.

680
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:24,154
Miss Dee said I didn't have to
leave my traditions in Chicago,

681
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,504
she said I could
bring them here.

682
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:27,419
So, at Mount Bethel,

683
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:29,159
we have the Giving Wreath.

684
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,901
It does come with one rule,
in order to take something,

685
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:33,512
you must leave something.

686
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,950
A token, a small handmade
something, a card.

687
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:39,561
Anything that will allow it
to continue to give

688
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:41,911
throughout the Advent season.

689
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:45,219
Just a special way to continue
to celebrate each other.

690
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:48,744
So, please enjoy the wreath
that keeps on giving!

691
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:50,180
[applause]

692
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:52,966
-Oh, I'm going first!
-No.

693
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:55,055
[laughter]

694
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,060
Well, that is so great.

695
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:02,976
Yeah, my dad loves Christmas.

696
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:05,021
He made up this tradition.

697
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:07,807
He wanted the church to give
back to the community more,

698
00:38:07,894 --> 00:38:09,374
during the season.

699
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:12,290
Okay, well, since
we're sharing traditions,

700
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:14,379
how about I introduce you
to Greenwood's

701
00:38:14,466 --> 00:38:16,511
Annual Cookie Hop
tomorrow night?

702
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:18,644
A Cookie Hop?

703
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:21,124
-Sounds fun.
-It is.

704
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:23,170
So it's a date?

705
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:34,007
Ah, saved you a piece
of Christmas pie.

706
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:35,487
Yes!

707
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:41,797
[sighs] So, about that hot date
tomorrow night.

708
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:44,191
I should've known
you were listening.

709
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:45,758
Oh, pastor, it's not my fault
your business

710
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:46,628
is the talk of the town.

711
00:38:46,715 --> 00:38:48,587
The town?

712
00:38:48,717 --> 00:38:50,632
Aww, don't be embarrassed.
What else we gone talk about?

713
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,591
It's the juiciest thing
we got going on.

714
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:57,335
And the Cookie Hop, such a
public and festive evening out.

715
00:38:57,422 --> 00:39:00,250
-Everybody's gonna be there?
-Oh, everybody, pastor.

716
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,949
So, what are we wearing?

717
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:06,779
Well, I-I was thinking this,
but in a different color.

718
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:11,131
Pastor, it's a date,
not a baptismal.

719
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:13,786
Show a little shoulder.

720
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:16,658
Oh, now, come on, grab that
wreath and the hot glue gun.

721
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:18,965
-Okay.
-And let's talk Cookie Hop.

722
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:21,010
[both laughing]

723
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:31,630
-Ashton?
-Oh, wow.

724
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:35,024
[chuckles] You look absolutely
beautiful.

725
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,638
Your hand, please.

726
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:42,075
I got us wrist bands so we can
sample all the cookies.

727
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:44,512
Mm-hmm?
Now what is a Cookie Hop?

728
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:47,167
Okay. So every Christmas,

729
00:39:47,297 --> 00:39:49,517
all the bakers, professional
or not, they all compete

730
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:51,780
for the "Best Cookie in Town"
title.

731
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:54,304
Oh. See, we don't have that
in Chicago,

732
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,612
so this is gonna be fun.

733
00:39:57,699 --> 00:40:00,006
Uh, come on.

734
00:40:01,747 --> 00:40:04,445
[instrumental music]

735
00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:07,405
[indistinct chatter]

736
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:20,374
Wait, so let's talk about
that perfect chord you

737
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:21,941
hit the other day.

738
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:22,942
I don't know
what you talking about.

739
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:24,334
-Yes, you do.
-Unh-unh.

740
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:28,600
-So you play a little?
-A little.

741
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:30,906
I come from a family
of musicians and singers.

742
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:32,995
My mother, grandfather,
great-grandfather.

743
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:36,695
-All singing pastors.
-Wait, so you sing.

744
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:39,045
-Let's hear it!
-Nope. My mother sings.

745
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:40,873
-I listen.
-Mm, come on, let me hear you.

746
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:43,919
I don't sing. I don't.
Plus, we're at a Cookie Hop.

747
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:48,358
Nah, I'm with you.

748
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:51,623
-So tell me why you don't sing.
-Ashton, come on.

749
00:40:51,753 --> 00:40:53,581
I'll wait.

750
00:40:56,149 --> 00:40:57,933
Fine.

751
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:02,503
Being a preacher's kid is a lot,

752
00:41:02,634 --> 00:41:05,158
but being a PK under
my mother's shadow,

753
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:08,683
even now,
it's a ton of pressure.

754
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,511
-And?
-And...

755
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:12,034
[chuckles]

756
00:41:12,165 --> 00:41:14,341
It was my first solo.

757
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:16,125
It's kind of a rite of passage
in our family.

758
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:18,998
I had to be like 15 or 16.

759
00:41:19,085 --> 00:41:21,783
And there I was
shaking like a leaf.

760
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:25,918
And I did it
and I was so proud of myself,

761
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:28,268
until the room got quiet.

762
00:41:28,398 --> 00:41:33,839
I open my eyes and the choir
director comes to me and says,

763
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:36,406
"You're supposed to be
Pastor Richard's daughter

764
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:38,800
and that's all you got."

765
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,323
Wow.

766
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:46,504
I just stood there ashamed
and in disbelief.

767
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:50,203
I'm sorry to hear that.

768
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,946
-Church hurt is real.
-Yeah.

769
00:41:55,687 --> 00:41:56,905
But I still wanna hear you sing.

770
00:41:56,992 --> 00:41:58,646
-Boy!
-I'm just saying.

771
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:00,300
I mean, look,
this is all we got.

772
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,910
-You gotta be all in.
-All in.

773
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:05,000
-Yes, I know your motto.
-Right. Yup, all the time.

774
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:07,220
Wait, hold up.
Did she keep her job?

775
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:09,222
Did she... No, no!

776
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:11,180
-She was gone the next day.
-All right.

777
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:12,617
All right.

778
00:42:14,183 --> 00:42:15,794
You got a little...

779
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,886
[instrumental music]

780
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:35,117
[sighs] Trust in the Lord
with all your heart

781
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:37,903
and do not lean
on your own understanding.

Sister Ida, it would be nice
to hear some good news from you.

00:43:12,328 --> 00:43:13,939
Dee, don't you use that tone
with me, little girl.

787
00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:16,332
I know your mama.
I'm just sayin',

788
00:43:16,463 --> 00:43:20,336
I got strong numbers on that
board ready to vote her out.

789
00:43:20,423 --> 00:43:24,384
We're looking
for a singing pastor. A leader.

little holiday joy up in here.

[Olivia] Yes, Lord!

Give him the glory!
Y'all better give him the glory!

893

[applause continues]

894
00:49:23,177 --> 00:49:26,398
Choir...
That choir sang today.

895
00:49:26,485 --> 00:49:28,226
Yeah, choir did its part,

896
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:30,663
it's time for me to
bring this word. Amen!

897
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,709
-[all] Amen!
-[Olivia] Amen! Turn with me...

898
00:49:33,796 --> 00:49:35,798
[tapping]

899
00:49:35,885 --> 00:49:39,106
Turn with me to
Hebrews 13:6. Amen.

900
00:49:39,193 --> 00:49:41,500
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Olivia] Whoo!

901
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:44,633
[instrumental music]

902
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:49,029
One Candy Cane freeze for me,

903
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:52,119
and one Coco-La-Da Christmas
milkshake for you.

904
00:49:52,206 --> 00:49:53,468
-Hah!
-[Ashton chuckling]

905
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:54,556
How did you know
this is my favorite?

906
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,993
A little birdie told me.

907
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,996
-Thank you. Uh-hmm.
-[both chuckle]

908
00:50:02,695 --> 00:50:04,392
I miss Chicago.

909
00:50:04,479 --> 00:50:07,569
My mom, dad...

910
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,311
But this town is
starting to feel like home.

911
00:50:12,879 --> 00:50:14,663
[Olivia chuckles]

912
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,666
So, they build this every year?

913
00:50:17,797 --> 00:50:22,149
Yep. One of my favorite things
to do every Christmas holiday.

914
00:50:22,236 --> 00:50:23,585
Guess you can call it
my tradition.

915
00:50:23,716 --> 00:50:25,022
[both chuckle]

916
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:30,810
So, Olivia, who is no longer
pastor for tonight.

917
00:50:30,897 --> 00:50:33,160
Right.

918
00:50:33,247 --> 00:50:35,771
-Shall we play?
-Oh, we shall.

919
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:37,643
-Hah.
-[Ashton chuckling]

920
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,166
Come on. Come on.

921
00:50:39,253 --> 00:50:40,907
All right.
I'm hats, you're bells.

922
00:50:40,994 --> 00:50:42,778
See, you're cheating,
there's clearly two pieces

923
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:43,953
already on the board.

924
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,433
You snooze, you lose.

925
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,652
Oh, you ain't right.

926
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:48,523
[chuckles]
Ah! Nice move.

927
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:49,742
Ah!

928
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,049
You know...

929
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:57,445
I'm starting to like
being just Olivia.

930
00:50:57,532 --> 00:51:00,405
-Tic-Tac-Toe! I win!
-Wh... What?

931
00:51:00,492 --> 00:51:02,407
[both laugh]

932
00:51:05,236 --> 00:51:06,933
I like just Olivia.

933
00:51:20,729 --> 00:51:25,082
"In his glorious name...

934
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:28,389
Pastor Olivia."

935
00:51:28,476 --> 00:51:30,913
[chuckles softly]
They may not be on time,

936
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,350
but they are in God's time.

937
00:51:32,437 --> 00:51:34,265
-You want me to help?
-No, no.

938
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:36,919
Pastor Byrd did it, so can I.

939
00:51:37,006 --> 00:51:39,792
A little secret,
I helped him.

940
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:41,228
[chuckles]

941
00:51:41,315 --> 00:51:44,144
-[sighs] I'm gonna head out.
-Okay.

942
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:46,538
Want me to pick you up
a Coco-Lada shake?

943
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:48,627
-Yes, please.
-See you in a bit.

944
00:51:48,757 --> 00:51:50,237
Bye.

945
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:51,630
Okay.

946
00:51:58,245 --> 00:52:00,813
-Yes...
-They're late.

947
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,294
Yes.

948
00:52:03,424 --> 00:52:04,686
They will be late this year,

949
00:52:04,773 --> 00:52:08,081
but they'll get there.

950
00:52:08,168 --> 00:52:10,170
I'm starting to get
a handle on things.

951
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:13,304
-Mm-hm.
-Did you hear the choir Sunday?

952
00:52:13,391 --> 00:52:15,262
Oh, they sounded amazing.

953
00:52:15,393 --> 00:52:17,482
[chuckles] I think
they're going to be ready.

954
00:52:17,612 --> 00:52:21,877
You think they're going to be
ready for exactly what?

955
00:52:21,964 --> 00:52:23,923
The Winter Jamboree.

956
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:26,795
Ah, the same Winter Jamboree
that I told you

957
00:52:26,882 --> 00:52:29,407
it was imperative to
turn in the paperwork.

958
00:52:29,494 --> 00:52:31,800
-That Winter Jamboree?
-Yes.

959
00:52:31,887 --> 00:52:35,935
Then where in God's name
is the church on this flyer?

960
00:52:36,022 --> 00:52:38,720
Surely, not the headlining act.

961
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:41,288
No, it can't be, be...

962
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:44,161
This can't be, because I-I
definitely turned it in.

963
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:46,467
-I know I did...
-[Ida] Oh.

964
00:52:46,554 --> 00:52:49,340
[Ida] This is you
handling things?

965
00:52:49,427 --> 00:52:52,647
Well, I'm gonna call an
emergency leadership meeting.

966
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:57,652
I think we need to seriously
discuss your trial period.

967
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,874
Why do you hate me?

968
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:06,183
I don't hate you.

969
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,535
You, you don't belong here.

970
00:53:10,665 --> 00:53:12,711
And you're not a leader
like my brother.

971
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:15,627
Your brother was a
great man of God...

972
00:53:15,714 --> 00:53:20,371
And you better never forget.

Oh, no. No.
I'm Olivia.

I'm the new pastor
over at Genesis.

Oh, I'm so sorry to hear
about Pastor Byrd.

988
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:18,690
That man had a heart for giving.

989
00:54:18,777 --> 00:54:21,170
And his choir, oh!
You know, it's a shame

990
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,694
they won't be participating
this year.

991
00:54:22,824 --> 00:54:24,870
Actually, that's what I'm
wanting to discuss.

992
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,480
We want to participate.

993
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:28,482
Oh, pastor, I'm sorry.

994
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:30,223
That paperwork had to be
in a week ago.

995
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,920
I mean, normally Pastor Byrd
would've had it

996
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:34,488
in a month in advance,
and since I didn't hear anything

997
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:36,838
from the church, I had to
book another act.

998
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:40,538
Mr. Hanks, I need a win here.
Okay?

999
00:54:40,668 --> 00:54:42,627
I-I can't go back to that choir
and tell them that

1000
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:45,499
all of this hard work they've
been doing is for naught.

1001
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:46,935
I forgot to turn in
the paperwork,

1002
00:54:47,022 --> 00:54:49,895
that's on me, not them.
Please just...

1003
00:54:49,982 --> 00:54:52,767
In the spirit of Christmas,
let them perform.

1004
00:54:52,854 --> 00:54:55,466
Pastor, I wish I could, but the
lineup's already booked.

1005
00:54:56,728 --> 00:54:58,120
There just isn't any room.

1006
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,776
Just like with Mary and Joseph.

1007
00:55:01,863 --> 00:55:05,998

for miracles.

[sniffling] I didn't know
anyone else was here.

1031
00:57:10,383 --> 00:57:13,647
You've been hiding that voice?

1032
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:15,954
It's so, so powerful.

-Stop, just...
-[Ashton] No, seriously.

It's like you told me, you,

1035
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,699
you got to share this
with the world.

1036
00:57:21,786 --> 00:57:24,136
Uh-uh. No.
What are you doing here?

1037
00:57:27,356 --> 00:57:28,967
You talked to your auntie.

1038
00:57:29,054 --> 00:57:31,970
[scoffs] Of course, she couldn't
keep that to herself.

1039
00:57:32,057 --> 00:57:35,364
I cannot believe I forgot
to turn in the paperwork.

1040
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:39,064
I don't understand how my mother
juggles this responsibility.

1041
00:57:39,151 --> 00:57:40,457
Why didn't you
just ask for help?

1042
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:42,415
[Olivia chuckles] Uh-uh. No.

1043
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:45,113
And give Sister Ida, your
auntie, more ammunition?

1044
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,420
You know how she loves pointing
at my grave mistakes.

1045
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:49,814
Oh. Come on, Olivia, no.

1046
00:57:49,944 --> 00:57:52,338
-She's...
-She's grieving. I know.

1047
00:57:55,384 --> 00:57:56,995
But I think I have an idea.

1048
00:57:58,736 --> 00:58:00,346
Come up, I'll show you.

1049
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:08,572
[Olivia] Come on. Okay.

1050
00:58:08,702 --> 00:58:10,704
So I found the band on the
flyer that's headlining.

1051
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:13,011
It's a rock band,
but it's gonna work. Trust me.

1052
00:58:13,141 --> 00:58:15,970
I trust you,
but is it gonna work?

1053
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:18,756
I've done my research.
Come on, where's my support?

1054
00:58:18,843 --> 00:58:19,931
We got this.

1055
00:58:20,018 --> 00:58:23,021
[upbeat music]

1056
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:42,606
Right.
So, what do you think?

1057
00:58:42,693 --> 00:58:45,086
-They sound great.
-I know.

1058
00:58:45,217 --> 00:58:47,436
Do you think they'll be
down to play gospel?

1059
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,831
Oh, ye of little faith. Red.

1060
00:58:50,962 --> 00:58:52,877
-Hey. What's up?
-Hey. Hi, I'm Olivia.

1061
00:58:53,007 --> 00:58:56,533
-And this is... Ashton.
-Wassup?

1062
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,317
-[chuckles]
-Right.

1063
00:58:58,447 --> 00:59:01,581
And you were looking for a
band to play at your church?

1064
00:59:01,668 --> 00:59:04,845
Not exactly.
I wanted to pitch an idea.

1065
00:59:04,932 --> 00:59:07,718
So, you know the choir that
normally opens the Jamboree?

1066
00:59:07,848 --> 00:59:10,416
Oh, yeah.
Their sound is sweet.

1067
00:59:10,503 --> 00:59:12,418
Yeah. It is.

1068
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:14,420
I'm actually kind of nervous
that, ah, we're replacing them,

1069
00:59:14,507 --> 00:59:15,726
'cause we don't sing,
and you know,

1070
00:59:15,856 --> 00:59:17,292
people want to hear singing.

1071
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:20,469
Well, you know, since you
don't sing and we do,

1072
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,471
how about we perform together?

1073
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,386
Do what now?

1074
00:59:24,473 --> 00:59:28,129
Look, I'm the new pastor
at Genesis and I...

1075
00:59:28,216 --> 00:59:30,131
I forgot to submit
the paperwork.

1076
00:59:30,262 --> 00:59:32,133
-[chuckles]
-I know. Yes, that's on me.

1077
00:59:32,264 --> 00:59:33,526
But I figured
it was worth a shot

1078
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:35,006
to see if we could collaborate.

1079
00:59:35,136 --> 00:59:36,877
Ah, but it's one week.

1080
00:59:36,964 --> 00:59:39,663
Plus, I don't know.
Rock and gospel?

1081
00:59:39,793 --> 00:59:43,014
Yeah. I'm hearing a whole
other sound all together.

1082
00:59:43,144 --> 00:59:45,059
Yeah, and we don't sing,
so voices could be cool.

1083
00:59:45,146 --> 00:59:48,062
And you said yourself,
people want to hear singing.

1084
00:59:48,149 --> 00:59:50,935
-[laughing] I did say that.
-That's the "Gotcha."

1085
00:59:51,022 --> 00:59:52,371
[chuckles]

1086
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:54,025
Yeah.

1087
00:59:54,112 --> 00:59:55,853
[Ida] Rock and Roll?

1088
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,898
Assistant pastor,
is this is your solution?

1089
00:59:58,029 --> 01:00:00,074
Now, wait a minute, Ida.
Give her a chance to explain.

1090
01:00:00,205 --> 01:00:02,511
Yes. It is my solution.

1091
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,209
Look, I know
I failed the church.

1092
01:00:04,296 --> 01:00:06,559
But God has given us an
opportunity for the choir

1093
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:08,430
to perform and for us
to minister.

1094
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:10,476
I'm not gonna
turn my back on that.

1095
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,392
Besides, I believe Pastor Byrd
would be honored.

1096
01:00:13,479 --> 01:00:15,481
Don't bring my brother
into this.

1097
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:17,178
He is this.

1098
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:19,746
He is the embodiment of
the Christmas spirit.

1099
01:00:19,877 --> 01:00:22,009
He was the servant for the King,
he loved the people

1100
01:00:22,096 --> 01:00:24,533
and the people loved him. And I
think this is a beautiful way

1101
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:26,884
to celebrate his legacy.

1102
01:00:26,971 --> 01:00:31,192
Well, you may be on to something
there. But Rock-n-Roll?

1103
01:00:31,323 --> 01:00:35,806
Ain't nothing wrong with a
little Prince for the Prince.

1104
01:00:35,936 --> 01:00:37,459
[Stella chuckling]
Yeah, Sister Ida.

1105
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:40,071
I mean, Kirk Franklin
had a rock song.

1106
01:00:40,158 --> 01:00:43,335
Well, you know I love me
some Kirk. He's a bad boy.

1107
01:00:43,422 --> 01:00:45,554
But don't you all be bringing
the Prince up in here,

1108
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,122
'cause the only Dove that's
going to be crying in here

1109
01:00:48,253 --> 01:00:49,994
is the Prince of Peace.

1110
01:00:50,081 --> 01:00:54,389
Aww, Bunny, you know you like
a little controversy.

1111
01:00:54,476 --> 01:00:56,827
[Ida] Stop, boy. Stop, boy!

1112
01:00:56,957 --> 01:01:00,831
What'd I tell you about
calling me "Bunny" in public?

1113
01:01:03,442 --> 01:01:05,487
Let us never discuss that.

1114
01:01:05,574 --> 01:01:06,967
-[Stella] Okay.
-Agreed.

1115
01:01:07,054 --> 01:01:10,841
[chuckles] Pastor,
this is going to be epic!

1116
01:01:10,928 --> 01:01:13,017
You on to something, pastor.
[chuckles]

1117
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:16,673
Your mother would be so proud.

1118
01:01:18,892 --> 01:01:20,198
Proud.

1119
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:24,681
Thank you.

1120
01:01:27,031 --> 01:01:29,598
[indistinct chatter]

1121
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:31,992
All right, everybody,
let's have a seat.

1122
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:33,994
Now let's talk about
this Jamboree.

1123
01:01:34,081 --> 01:01:37,302
We goin' to put a little funk
in O Come All Ye Faithful!

1124
01:01:37,389 --> 01:01:39,304
[Stella giggling]

1125
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:42,524
-So sorry. Proceed.
-Stella is correct.

1126
01:01:42,655 --> 01:01:44,831
We're going to collaborate with
Red and his rock band.

1127
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:46,354
And Stella's going
to sing the lead.

1128
01:01:46,441 --> 01:01:49,531
-Really?
-Come on, y'all.

1129
01:01:49,662 --> 01:01:51,838
Pastor just forgot to turn in
the jamboree paperwork.

1130
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:53,710
-Oh!
-What?

1131
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:56,103
Yes... I...
Okay. Yes, I did.

1132
01:01:56,234 --> 01:01:59,628
I did. But God led me to ask
Red if we could collaborate.

1133
01:01:59,759 --> 01:02:01,239
Not only in memory
of Pastor Byrd,

1134
01:02:01,369 --> 01:02:03,589
but in the spirit of Christmas,
and he said yes.

1135
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,766
We got our own
Christmas miracle.

1136
01:02:06,897 --> 01:02:09,247
So on that note, let's jump
on this rehearsal.

1137
01:02:09,334 --> 01:02:11,815
Y'all, this is gonna be epic.
I can feel it.

1138
01:02:11,945 --> 01:02:13,164
That's right.

1139
01:02:15,122 --> 01:02:17,081
Aw, thanks, mom.

1140
01:02:17,168 --> 01:02:19,692
Yeah, I feel...
I'm feeling much better.

1141
01:02:19,779 --> 01:02:22,651
Uh, oh, I-I got dad's new
golf clubs for Christmas,

1142
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,523
and I know every year I ask you
what you want,

1143
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,655
but I figured that
I would just gotta...

1144
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:29,528
-[laughing] Look at me.
-This is what you bought?

1145
01:02:29,615 --> 01:02:31,486
All right, all right, all right.

1146
01:02:31,573 --> 01:02:32,966
[Destiny] Oh, my God!

1147
01:02:33,097 --> 01:02:35,099
I'm sorry, mom.
What'd you say?

1148
01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:37,536
Yeah, it's gonna be great.

1149
01:02:40,452 --> 01:02:43,455
[dramatic music]

1150
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:49,766
Hey.

1151
01:02:51,898 --> 01:02:54,858
-Hey.
-You look busy.

1152
01:02:54,945 --> 01:02:56,860
-Very.
-You okay?

1153
01:03:01,212 --> 01:03:04,432
Look, maybe we rushed into this
whole dating thing.

1154
01:03:04,563 --> 01:03:07,522
This "all in,
be in the moment" thing.

1155
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:09,873
Whoa, whoa.
Where is this coming from?

1156
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:15,617
I have a lot going on,
and you have the jamboree.

1157
01:03:15,748 --> 01:03:17,750
And I really just don't have any
space for more disappointment.

1158
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,448
-Disappointment?
-[Olivia] I'm failing here.

1159
01:03:20,535 --> 01:03:23,451
This whole trial period thing
is stressing me out.

1160
01:03:23,582 --> 01:03:26,063
And dealing with you and another
woman on top of it all...

1161
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:28,021
-Another woman?
-I don't want to talk about it.

1162
01:03:28,152 --> 01:03:30,632
I just, I would really
like for you to leave.

1163
01:03:30,763 --> 01:03:33,070
-You should let me explain.
-I don't want to hear it.

1164
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:36,073
Everybody is trying
to explain stuff,

1165
01:03:36,203 --> 01:03:40,817
and I just really need quiet.

1166
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:43,167
Please.

1167
01:03:45,038 --> 01:03:46,170
Okay.

1168
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:49,869

Happy holidays!

01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:02,349
Wow! She's beautiful.

1203
01:06:02,436 --> 01:06:03,916
You didn't tell me
she had style.

1204
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:07,006
And this outfit is everything.

1205
01:06:07,093 --> 01:06:09,574
-Thank you?
-Okay. I see you, big bro.

1206
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:12,229
I see you. [chuckles]

-Destiny.
-Yeah.

1213
01:06:25,764 --> 01:06:30,334
My little sis. She's in town
visiting for the holidays.

1214
01:06:30,421 --> 01:06:31,639
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

1215
01:06:31,726 --> 01:06:32,858
Yeah...

I'm so sorry.

1217
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,864
Um, I'm glad you came.

1218
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,780
-I got this for you.
-Thank you.

1219
01:06:44,739 --> 01:06:46,524
Oh. Ah, wh-where are my manners?

1220
01:06:46,654 --> 01:06:49,614
Please, um, come in.
Make yourself comfortable.

1221
01:06:49,701 --> 01:06:53,270
-Eat, play, enjoy.
-Uh-hmm. All right, all right.

1222
01:06:56,534 --> 01:06:57,839
[Miss Dee sighs]

1223
01:07:01,408 --> 01:07:03,193
-Well?
-It was his sister.

1224
01:07:04,629 --> 01:07:06,457
-That's the other woman?
-Yes.

1225
01:07:06,587 --> 01:07:08,067
I thought you knew
his sister was in town.

1226
01:07:08,198 --> 01:07:09,982
I didn't know
his mother was his mother.

1227
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:11,679
I didn't know
Sister Ida was his aunt.

1228
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:13,638
I did not know
he had a sister.

1229
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:15,901
-[laughing]
-It's not funny.

1230
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,077
Olivia, that man is
crazy about you.

1231
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:19,644
Can't you see that?

1232
01:07:21,385 --> 01:07:24,083
Before you arrived, no one
could get him to play.

1233
01:07:24,214 --> 01:07:28,305
-And believe me, we tried.
-[laughs]

1234
01:07:28,392 --> 01:07:30,394
But you opened him up again.

1235

Oh. No, thanks. I got it.

1271
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:30,340
You didn't open it.

1272
01:09:32,124 --> 01:09:35,562
-Oh. Right now? [laughs]
-Mm-hm.

1273
01:09:35,649 --> 01:09:37,042
Okay.

1274
01:09:43,048 --> 01:09:44,789
It's gorgeous.

1275
01:09:44,876 --> 01:09:47,008
My grandmother thought that
every Christmas tree

1276
01:09:47,095 --> 01:09:49,750
should be topped
with a Black Angel.

1277
01:09:49,881 --> 01:09:52,362
Said it was the ancestors
watching over us.

1278
01:09:53,885 --> 01:09:55,191
She's beautiful.

1279
01:09:59,499 --> 01:10:00,718
I should go.

1280
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:05,201
Yeah, I-I'm pretty exhausted.

[laughing] Hey.
Jesus is the reason.

1288
01:10:31,879 --> 01:10:35,448
Ah. Look who is
in the Christmas spirit.

1289
01:10:35,535 --> 01:10:37,363
Where are the other two
of the Three Wise Men?

1290
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:39,626
Oh, they already left.

1291
01:10:39,713 --> 01:10:43,282
You know, pastor, thank you
for asking me to help you.

1292
01:10:43,369 --> 01:10:45,458
Lord knows I needed a
break from Ida.

1293
01:10:45,545 --> 01:10:48,200
[laughing]
But, no, truthfully.

1294
01:10:48,331 --> 01:10:50,202
It's been really nice
spending some time with you,

1295
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:52,160
just to get to know you.

1296
01:10:52,291 --> 01:10:54,162
You good people.

1297
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,817
Now, how many of these meals
we deliver in this season?

1298
01:10:56,904 --> 01:11:00,212
-Uh, about 300.
-Aw, now, that's good, pastor.

1299
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:02,954
That's 50 more than last year.

1300
01:11:03,084 --> 01:11:05,522
Pastor Byrd would be proud.

1301
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:06,871
Mm-hm.

1302
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:10,788
Yes!

1303
01:11:10,918 --> 01:11:14,531
[humming]
I got it.

1304
01:11:14,618 --> 01:11:16,533
I did it! I did it!

1305
01:11:16,663 --> 01:11:19,275
Olivia. [laughs]

1306
01:11:21,364 --> 01:11:24,367
-Yes.
-Yeah. We won't discuss that.

1307
01:11:24,454 --> 01:11:25,977
What? I can bust a move.

1308
01:11:26,064 --> 01:11:28,632
-No. [chuckles]
-Boy.

1309
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,938
-Are you free tonight?
-Yes.

1310
01:11:31,069 --> 01:11:32,636
All right.

1311
01:11:32,723 --> 01:11:34,333
-You saw all of that?
-All of that.

1312
01:11:34,464 --> 01:11:36,292
-[Olivia] Da... [grunts]
-[Ashton laughing]

1313

[instrumental music]

1314
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:45,562
My dad brought my mom here
on their first date.

1315
01:11:47,607 --> 01:11:49,479
He was low on cash
and didn't want her to know,

1316
01:11:49,609 --> 01:11:55,093
so he packed a nice little
dinner and brought her here.

1317
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,313
She thought he was
such a romantic.

1318
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:01,665
Fell in love with him
that night.

1319
01:12:01,752 --> 01:12:04,015
Now, that's a love story.

1320
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,671
Speaking of love stories...

1321
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:11,196
would you care to join me?

1322
01:12:17,724 --> 01:12:19,422
[both chuckle softly]

1323
01:12:19,509 --> 01:12:20,640
Come on.

1324
01:12:24,035 --> 01:12:25,515
[Ashton] You like it?

1325
01:12:26,951 --> 01:12:29,301
It's absolutely stunning.

1326
01:12:29,432 --> 01:12:30,868
You did all this?

1327
01:12:30,955 --> 01:12:33,087
[chuckles] You know
I got them skills.

1328
01:12:33,218 --> 01:12:36,134
-[chuckles]
-No, this event company did it.

1329
01:12:36,221 --> 01:12:40,181
I figured I'd kick it up a
notch... 'cause I ain't broke.

1330
01:12:40,312 --> 01:12:41,531
[chuckles]

1331
01:12:47,014 --> 01:12:48,538
[exhales] Olivia...

1332
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:51,541
You believed in me.

1333
01:12:53,281 --> 01:12:55,501
Reignited my passion for music.

1334
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,810
For that, thank you.

1335
01:13:01,246 --> 01:13:03,335
I know you're a woman of God.

1336
01:13:03,422 --> 01:13:05,772
A pastor, you need to be
out front leading,

1337
01:13:05,859 --> 01:13:07,252
and I'm with that.

1338
01:13:09,602 --> 01:13:11,387
But I want to be on this
journey with you...

1339
01:13:13,084 --> 01:13:16,261
standing right beside you,
making you laugh.

1340
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:22,485
My mother fell in love
with my father because...

1341
01:13:24,008 --> 01:13:27,925
he saw Etta, not a pastor.

1342
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:30,928
She said...

1343
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:38,414
"If you fall in love,
make sure he sees you."

1344
01:13:39,763 --> 01:13:41,025
I do.

1345
01:13:45,377 --> 01:13:48,293
-[cellphone ringing]
-Oh.

1346
01:13:50,295 --> 01:13:51,427
Hey, mom.

1347
01:13:52,645 --> 01:13:54,473
How...

1348
01:13:54,604 --> 01:13:56,432
Wait, what happened?

1349
01:13:56,562 --> 01:13:57,737
Slow down.

1350
01:13:59,304 --> 01:14:00,436
Oh, no.

1351
01:14:01,915 --> 01:14:05,092
All right.
I'll be right there.

1352
01:14:05,223 --> 01:14:07,051
-Gosh.
-Everything okay?

1353
01:14:07,138 --> 01:14:08,748
No, it's not.

1354
01:14:08,879 --> 01:14:10,750
[Ashton]
We need to get to the theatre.

1355
01:14:13,274 --> 01:14:14,928
[Olivia] Okay, what is all
the commotion about?

1356
01:14:15,059 --> 01:14:16,495
Stella done lost her voice.

1357
01:14:16,582 --> 01:14:18,410
[hoarsely] I don't know
what happened.

1358
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:22,762
We tried giving her
tea and honey, mints.

1359
01:14:22,849 --> 01:14:26,070
-[Carl] Nothing worked.
-Okay, okay. Nobody panic.

1360
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,941
I'm not panicking,
so no one needs to panic.

1361
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:29,073
-[Olivia] Right.
-All right?

1362
01:14:29,203 --> 01:14:31,336
-A-Are you panicking?
-No.

1363
01:14:31,423 --> 01:14:33,425
Does-Does anyone else
know her solo?

1364
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:36,254
Nobody can hit those high notes
like Stella.

1365
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:38,082
I know her solo.
I can do it.

1366
01:14:38,169 --> 01:14:40,214
-Oh, Lord...
-[sighs]

1367
01:14:40,345 --> 01:14:42,869
I'd rather hear a distressed
billy goat cry.

1368
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,218
Brother Carl!

1369
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:46,220
Oh, you will know the truth,

1370
01:14:46,351 --> 01:14:47,961
and the truth will set you free.

1371
01:14:48,048 --> 01:14:50,442
Okay, son, what are we gonna do?

1372
01:14:50,573 --> 01:14:52,618
The jamboree is tomorrow.

1373
01:14:52,705 --> 01:14:54,490
It's tomorrow.

1374
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:59,451
[instrumental music]

1375
01:14:59,538 --> 01:15:02,498
I know where this is going,
and it's a hard no.

1376
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:04,325
-Pastor...
-[Olivia] No.

1377
01:15:04,412 --> 01:15:06,327
-The congregation needs you.
-Okay, don't do this.

1378
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:08,155
-Look, you got to go on.
-Stop it.

1379
01:15:08,242 --> 01:15:10,636
-[Olivia] Just stop it, okay?
-Now's the time to lead.

1380
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:12,595
Please, stop asking me.
Don't ask me again.

1381
01:15:15,249 --> 01:15:16,642
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1382
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:22,343
-What the...
-You wanted that.

1383
01:15:25,608 --> 01:15:28,785
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Hey! Hey, hey.

1384
01:15:28,915 --> 01:15:30,700
-I didn't mean to upset you.
-Yeah, well, you did.

1385
01:15:30,787 --> 01:15:32,223
And you embarrassed me.

1386
01:15:34,268 --> 01:15:36,836
Don't you think I want to be

-Save my job?
-Livi...

1388
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,057
That's what they want, right?
A singing pastor.

1389
01:15:40,187 --> 01:15:42,276
I-I... I don't sing.

1390
01:15:42,363 --> 01:15:44,365
-Yes, you do.
-I cannot be "all in" like you.

1391
01:15:44,496 --> 01:15:47,107
-I'm not wired that way.
-Yes, you are.

1392
01:15:47,194 --> 01:15:49,457
What do you say to the
congregation every Sunday?

1393
01:15:49,588 --> 01:15:52,069
"Let your faith be bigger
than your fears."

1394
01:15:52,156 --> 01:15:54,724
-Not now, Ashton.
-Absolutely now, Livi.

1395
01:15:54,854 --> 01:15:57,596
Look, that choir,
they need you.

1396
01:15:57,683 --> 01:16:00,251
I need you.

1397
01:16:00,381 --> 01:16:02,601
Now I'm sorry that choir
director embarrassed you,

1398
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:07,084
hurt you, but now, you get to
stand up to her.

1399
01:16:07,214 --> 01:16:09,956
And I told you
I've got your back.

Even if it means
giving you a push.

1401

A push?

1402
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,832
Yes, out of your comfort zone,

1403
01:16:15,919 --> 01:16:17,747
and into your greatness.

1404
01:16:19,749 --> 01:16:23,013

I knew you could do it, too,
baby girl.

1559
01:25:49,927 --> 01:25:53,060
-Mom, dad, this is...
-Ashton.

1560
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:55,889
I'm so glad to finally meet you.

1561
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,587
[Ashton chuckling]

1562
01:25:57,717 --> 01:26:00,329
Young man, you did a fantastic
job with this choir.

1563
01:26:00,459 --> 01:26:02,548
[sighs] Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

1564
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:05,160
And those voices,
they need to go on the road.

1565
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,726
You know, I was thinking
the same thing.

1566
01:26:06,813 --> 01:26:09,599
-First stop, Chicago.
-Absolutely.

1567
01:26:09,729 --> 01:26:13,298
Uh, do you mind if I have a word
with Olivia?

1568
01:26:13,385 --> 01:26:15,431
Yeah, sure.
Go ahead, son.

1569
01:26:15,561 --> 01:26:17,346
Thank you. Excuse us.

1570
01:26:19,348 --> 01:26:21,219
[Ashton] You showed up.

1571
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:24,396
The church needed me.
I couldn't let them down.

1572
01:26:24,527 --> 01:26:28,095
You needed me.
I couldn't let you down.

1573
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,141
You know, you got to be
"all in."

1574
01:26:30,272 --> 01:26:33,188
-Oh. [chuckles]
-[laughing]

1575
01:26:36,713 --> 01:26:39,672
[instrumental music]

1576
01:26:50,596 --> 01:26:53,512
[instrumental

1577
01:27:23,499 --> 01:27:26,415
[music continues]
