00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,395
to illuminate the 1893
Chicago World's Fair,

183
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,268
with spectacular results.

184
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,968
Must have seemed truly
miraculous at the time.

185
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,622
And now some of you have
light bulbs in front of you.

186
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:40,667
Could you hold them in
your hand for the moment?

187
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,625
Just like that.

188
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:45,323
Imagine if you will
this coil is the Earth.

189
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:49,197
Tesla, by bouncing certain
frequencies off the ionosphere

190
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,808
and using the Earth
as a giant battery,

191
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:55,812
Tesla said that he could
provide unlimited free

192
00:09:55,856 --> 00:10:00,077
and wireless power to
any place on the planet.

193
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:03,341
[electricity buzzing]
[students gasping]

194
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:07,432
Ooh, impressive, huh?

195
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:11,001
Now, unfortunately, the
financier JP Morgan,

196
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:13,003
as Tesla's primary investor,

197
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:17,094
wanted to monetize this
revolutionary source of power,

198
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:19,706
not just hand it out
for free like Tesla did.

199
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:25,015
So, Morgan withdrew his funding
and shutdown the project.

200
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:27,061
[remote clicking]

201
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:32,109
A century later, that
same power is used today

202
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:34,415
in our cell phones.

203
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:38,028
[footsteps pattering]

204
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:38,855
- Hey.

205
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:44,687
- But perhaps the most
significant unfinished work

206
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:47,690
of Tesla's was in the
area that we know today

207
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:52,086
as High-frequency Active
Auroral Research, or HAARP.

208
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,653
[door clicks]

209
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:56,307
See, Tesla believed that
everything, all of nature,

210
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:59,920
all things, all that we see,
everything that we know,

211
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:01,922
that's the weather,
that's earthquakes,

212
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:04,098
that's even the human mind.

213
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:08,711
All of it is governed
by frequency.

214
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:14,891
Tiny vibrations that
animate or destroy.

215
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:21,245
Case in point. When the
wind in Washington State

216
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:24,118
reached the resonance
frequency of the mighty

217
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:29,166
Tacoma Narrows Bridge, it
snapped like a toothpick.

218
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,386
[water splashing]

219
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:34,215
See, Tesla believed that if
you control the resonance

220
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:38,175
frequency of an object,
you control that object.

221
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:41,526
Whether it be a bridge,
weather, earthquake,

222
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:44,616
even a human thought.

223
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:51,145
Fun fact, if a little sinister.

224
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:54,888
When Tesla died, the
government invaded his offices

225
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:57,586
and seized all this research

226
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:59,893
in the name of
national security.

227
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:02,112
But Tesla was canny,

228
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:05,028
and he committed all his most
critical notes and research

229
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:08,162
to a particular notebook
that he hid away.

230
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,424
Imagine.

231
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,602
Just imagine if you
will what you could do

232
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:17,258
if you got hold of
those notes, hmm?

233
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:20,827
- Professor, didn't
he also say we should,

234
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,873
"Prevent the breeding of
the unfit by sterilization"?

235
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:27,790
- Someone's been doing
their reading, very good.

236
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:31,141
Yes, Tesla was interested
in birth control,

237
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:35,145
but unlike some of his
contemporary eugenicists,

238
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:38,583
he was more interested in
the betterment of mankind,

239
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:42,022
not just in creating
some kind of master race.

240
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:46,504
Think of it, if you will, as
a sort of benign evolution.

241
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,467
Ah, Ms. Dahlset, would you
care to edify Ms. Smith?

242
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,818
- I think Tesla knew
from natural selection

243
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:57,602
that only the
strong will survive.

244
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:59,822
- But aren't all
men created equal?

245
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:02,477
- Ah, well, let me take
that in Tesla's own words.

246
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,218
To quote Tesla, he said,

247
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:06,655
"Science is but a
perversion of itself,

248
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:09,701
"unless it has as
its ultimate goal

249
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:12,661
"the betterment of mankind."

250
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:14,924
Isn't that right, Mr. Harris?

251
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,230
Mr. Harris!

252
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:20,843
You see, I controlled
the resonant frequency

253
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,498
of Mr. Harris, and so
I control Mr. Harris.

254
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,893
- Is it true as a student
you put big speakers

255
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:29,939
in your dorm's basement to
find the resonance frequency,

256
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,202
and you almost brought it down?

257
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,029
- Ah...

258
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:36,946
At this time I can neither
deny nor confirm that report.

259
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,906
[bell ringing]
Right, midterms, Friday!

260
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:43,344
Those who fail to
evolve, fail to pass!

261
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:45,215
Thank you very much.

262
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:48,131
[footsteps pattering]
[students chattering]

263
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:51,221
There you go, get that down you.

264
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,876
Quintin's Chamomile Tea.

265
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,272
Just the remedy for a long day
of interminable lectures, hm?

266
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,317
Mm.

267
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:02,929
You know, I couldn't
help but notice

268
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:05,366
that you were a little
late this morning,

269
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:08,760
and your answer in class was
a little less than convincing.

270
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:10,719
- Why don't you just
use your wristwatch?

271
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:11,981
It works.

272
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,504
What is it with you
and that old thing?

273
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:14,854
- This old thing?

274
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:17,073
This, my dear, is
a special edition.

275
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:19,554
Do you know that Tesla
used to sell these things

276
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:22,296
from time to time to
put food on his table?

277
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:24,951
And this one has a, you see
it has a scratch on the T,

278
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:27,475
makes it very special.

279
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:30,565
But you are avoiding
the subject.

280
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:32,567
You went to see your brother
again this morning, didn't you?

281
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,743
- That's not what I'm
here to talk about.

282
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:38,181
- Be that as it may, if
you want to achieve success

283
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:42,359
in science, you have to put
distractions aside and focus.

284
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,406
You know, Esther, I
don't have a daughter,

285
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:48,496
but if I did, I'd want
her to be just like you,

286
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,324
with your special talents.

287
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,716
Wind is inspiration, Esther,

288
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,110
and windmills are
in short supply.

289
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:59,420
- He's my brother,
and he's hurting.

290
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:01,291
I can't just ignore him.

291
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:03,554
- I know, and you've done
a lot for him already,

292
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:06,601
but science needs
your special gift.

293
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:08,646
So, science can help society

294
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,692
and help your brother
along the way.

295
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:12,781
- [clears throat] I, um...

296
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:14,957
I brought you these to show you.

297
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,567
[suspenseful music]

298
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:17,829
- When was this?

299
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:21,616
- Today, downtown, right
near this fault line.

300
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:22,573
- Well, this is a...

301
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:24,532
This is a counterwave.

302
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:26,360
This is, this is serious.

303
00:15:26,403 --> 00:15:28,536
- Have you ever seen a
pattern like this before?

304
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:30,016
[phone buzzing]

305
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:31,974
- Oh, excuse me.

306
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:33,367
[dramatic music]

307
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:33,976
- [Esther] Is everything okay?

308
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,803
- Uh.

309
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:40,983
Yeah, I just, I have to
take care of something.

310
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,377
It was just, something
just came up.

311
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,813
Would you...

312
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:47,903
Would you mind covering
my classes for me?

313
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,774
And I need to take these.

314
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:51,037
- Oh, actually, you know what?

315
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,821
I wanted to keep this
chart for my research.

316
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:54,779
Are you finished with
my notes on my thesis?

317
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,390
- Yes, they're at my house.

318
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:57,608
I'll...

319
00:15:57,652 --> 00:15:59,219
I'll leave them in my mailbox.

320
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:02,613
- Okay.

[engine revving]

349
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,401
- [Dispatcher] 911,
what's your emergency?

350
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:03,011
- [Esther] I'm a grad
student at Cal U.

351
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:04,491
I think my professor's missing.

352
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:07,407
He wasn't at his house,
and it was a total mess.

353
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,626
- [Dispatcher] Do you have
any proof he's missing?

354
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,193
- [Esther] No, but.

355
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:13,543
- [Dispatcher] Ma'am, we can't
file a report for 48 hours.

356
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:16,677
If he doesn't show up
after that, give us a call.

357
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,548
- [Esther] That's
the best you can do?

358
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,855
- [Dispatcher] I can connect
you with the local police.

359
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:23,901
- [Esther] No, no, thank you.

360
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:26,904
[engine humming]

361
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:33,433

00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:39,439
[door creaking]

363
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:43,660
[dramatic music]

364
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,239
- What are you doing in here?

365
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:59,023
- I work with the professor.

366
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:00,808
- That's not what I asked.

367
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,505
I asked you what you were doing.

368
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:05,856
- Looking for the
professor, obviously.

369
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,857
What happened here?

370
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:09,860
- Well, you didn't
touch anything, did you?

371
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:12,298
- I'm not stupid.

372
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:14,909
- Okay, Einstein,
I'm just making sure.

373
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:16,911
Cops should be here in a few.

374
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:18,652
- Police aren't coming.

375
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:19,870
Colin Ward, FBI.

376
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:23,265
- Esther Dahlset.

377
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:26,312
Why is the FBI involved
in a campus break-in?

378
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:28,096
- And why aren't
the police coming?

379
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:29,967
- 'Cause this is my case.

380
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,057
- The professor did
a lot of work for us.

381
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:35,277
- We don't need a
G Man to tell us

382
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,323
that some students tried
to steal test answers.

383
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:40,108
- Wait, do you know where
Professor Conrad is?

384
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:42,241
- He told me earlier
he was leaving town

385
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,112
and seemed to be in a hurry.

386
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:45,896
- What is this all about?

387
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,942
- Let's just say there are
a lot enemies of the State

388
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:49,422
interested in his research.

389
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:53,600
- Uh.

390
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:57,168
- Is there any security
footage of this office?

391
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,170
- Yeah, if it gets you
to leave campus, yeah.

392
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,434
I'll show you.

393
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:05,655
You, too.

394
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:07,962
Okay.

395
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:11,966
[video game music]

396
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:12,923
[controller buttons clicking]

397
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:14,751
- Yeah!

398
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:17,580
Your death is sweet
to me, Shao Khan!

399
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:21,149
- G Man, Einstein, meet
Rocky, our IT specialist.

400
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:22,933
- They're not players.

401
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:24,848
- No, this is reality.

402
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:27,111
Can you pull footage
from the break-in?

403
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:28,939
- Nothing's there, you sure
you want to see it again?

404
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:30,941
- Humor me, we have guests.

405
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:32,595
- Humor.

406
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:33,640
Okay.

407
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:37,687
Analog.

408
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,387
- Double mocha latteccino!

409
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,736
No foam.

410
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:43,824
- Thanks.

411
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:46,435
Nice hat.

412
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,741
- Oh.

413
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:49,177
- Ngh-ngh, ngh-ngh.

414
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,700
[static buzzing]

415
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:51,875
- What is this, a joke?

416
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:53,921
It's all static.

417
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:57,925
I got all I need.

418
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:00,797
[footsteps pattering]

419
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,973
- What a moron, what's the deal?

420
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:05,324
- Professor Conrad is
missing, I'm really worried.

421
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,281
- Is that really the only copy?

422
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,456
- Of course not.

423
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:12,722
You want me to use
my superpowers?

424
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:13,984
Oh!

425
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:15,334
- Can you pull an
image from that?

426
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:18,337
- Duh, takes like
one to two days.

427
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,556
- Okay, yes, use
your superpowers.

428
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:24,778
[tape rattling]

429
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:25,605
- Okay.

430
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:28,434
[video game music]
Yeah!

431
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:32,873
[water splashing]
[birds chirping]

432
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:36,746

00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,967
[footsteps pattering]

434
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:43,231
- Ms. Dahlset?

435
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:45,059
I apologize for the intrusion.

436
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:47,191
Dr. Conrad has spoken
so highly of you.

437
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:48,758
- And you are?

438
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:50,369
- Oh, forgive my manners.

439
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:53,023
I'm Dr. Cyrus Stanton, FIT.

440
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:56,070
Stuart was helping me on
some very sensitive research.

441
00:22:58,289 --> 00:22:59,943
- The professor had
mentioned FIT before,

442
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:02,032
but he never told
me what it was.

443
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:04,252
- Future Invested Technologies.

444
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:07,951
We're what one might consider
an advanced think tank.

445
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:10,824
We at FIT are committed
not only to thinking

446
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,913
about the problems
but to solving them.

447
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:16,220
- That sounds like Dr. Conrad,

448
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:18,048
always trying to
better humanity.

449
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:23,010
- Hmm, unfortunately not
everyone shares our value set.

450
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:26,448
There are many governments
with most likely nefarious

451
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:28,015
intentions out there who'd love

452
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:30,321
to get their hands
on our research.

453
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:34,369
Dr. Conrad was about to
submit his final frequency

454
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,720
data research on earthquakes,
now we can't reach him.

455
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:39,156
- Do you think he was taken?

456
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,506
- It's quite possible.

457
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,769
One of our colleagues,
a Douglas Cole,

458
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:46,207
had mysteriously died yesterday.

459
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,643
- I'm sorry.

460
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:50,341
I wish that there was
something more that I could do.

461
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:53,301
- Dr. Conrad had acquired a
little leather bound notebook

462
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,608
from an antiquities dealer that

463
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:57,479
was critical to our research.

464
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:59,438
Perhaps you may
have come across it?

465
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:00,874
- No.

466
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,136
- Well, if you do come
across this notebook

467
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,529
or hear from Dr. Conrad,

468
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:05,487
please contact me
as soon as possible.

469
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:09,099
- It's connected to
the recent tremors.

470
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:10,971
- Yes, I believe
it is connected.

471
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:14,104
So, please find Dr.
Conrad and his data

472
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:15,976
before it's too late.

473
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:17,107
- I'll see what I can do.

474
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:18,152
- Excellent.

475
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:20,459
Gentlemen, thank you.

476
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:25,681
[water splashing]
[footsteps pattering]

477
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,945

[computer beeping]

479
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:38,651
- [Esther] Professor,
it'’s me Esther, again.

480
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,305
Please call me back.

481
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:44,352
[suspenseful music]

00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:50,924

[computer keys clicking]

485
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:03,980
- [Reporter] You thought
you'd never see science

486
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:06,940
shooting weapons at viruses
and deadly diseases.

487
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:08,332
Imagine shaking them to death,

488
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:11,161
or more precisely,
drowning them in vibration.

489
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:14,208
It just may be possible
to use high frequencies

490
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:16,166
to wipe out HIV, AIDS, even the.

491
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,299
[computer key clicking]

492
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:21,345
[suspenseful music]

[device buzzing]

494
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:27,656
[soft buzzing]

495
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,136
- Uh.

496
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:30,616
If you're viewing this,

497
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:33,444
it means that something
terrible has already happened.

498
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:35,359
My research has
been hijacked and

499
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:37,840
they killed my
financier, Douglas Cole,

500
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:39,929
and I'm afraid I maybe next.

501
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:41,496
I'm so sorry.

502
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,107
I didn't mean for you to be
dragged into any of this.

503
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,415
I...

504
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,548
Whatever you do, don't
go to the police.

505
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,941
I think they may have
been compromised.

506
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:55,379
There's an old brown
battered notebook

507
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:57,425
in my office at work. You
have to find it, take it,

508
00:25:57,468 --> 00:25:59,862
and keep it hidden at all costs.

509
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:02,865
The G-20 leaders meeting
downtown, they're in danger.

510
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:06,652
In fact, the whole of
downtown could be in danger.

511
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:10,481
Take down these numbers, and
keep an eye out for things

512
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:12,875
that look like strange
sonic listening devices.

513
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:14,616
They're not, they're weapons.

514
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,358
They were used against
those diplomats in Cuba.

515
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:19,578
[suspenseful music]

516
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:22,450
[Esther sighs]

517
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,889
- [Reporter] The Cuban
attack is shrouded in mystery

518
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:29,675
with both countries
remaining tight-lipped.

519
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:32,242
Even the scope of the
attack is unusual.

520
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:34,593
At least 21 people in Havana
have suffered a variety

521
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:37,421
of strange illnesses,
including hearing loss,

522
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:39,815
dizziness and headaches.

523
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:42,296
The State Department has
ordered all US Embassy staff

524
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:44,124
to leave the island.

525
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:47,649
- [Professor] The whole of
downtown could be in danger.

526
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:50,217
Take down these numbers, and
keep an eye out for things

527
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,915
that look like strange
sonic listening devices.

528
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:55,004
They're not, they're weapons.

529
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:57,311
They were used against
those diplomats in Cuba.

530
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:02,664
- What do you think?

531
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,057
- I think you must
be pretty desperate

532
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,059
if you're coming to me.

533
00:27:06,102 --> 00:27:07,887
- You're the only
one I can trust.

534
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,279
- You need to steer
clear of these people.

535
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:11,020
They don't mess around.

536
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:13,893
- My professor is missing,
thousands could die.

537
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:15,808
You want me to just steer clear?

538
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:18,071
- You gonna stop them, Esther?

539
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:20,247
You'll end up getting
yourself killed.

540
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,770
- What's your plan?

541
00:27:21,814 --> 00:27:25,382
Just hide out here, give
up, that's your solution?

542
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:26,253
- Works for me.

543
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:32,476
- Maybe if you got
your ears blown out

544
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,565
you'd be a little
more cautious too.

545
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:37,481
And you should be,
you're being followed.

546
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:39,135
- What, I am not being followed.

547
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,529
How would you know?
- I just know.

548
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:44,924
- I have to do this.

549
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:47,143
I'll do it with or without you.

550
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:50,669
[somber music]

551
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:05,509
[car humming]

552
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,644
- You should have seen him.

553
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,168
She came in, he stopped, he
stopped listening, stopped.

554
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:12,995
You want some of this?

555
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,083
- No, I'm good.

556
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:16,738
[Jeremiah laughs]

557
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:17,521
- [Man] Kill.

558
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:20,350
[device whirring]

559
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,657
Kill.

560
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,703
- Jeremiah?

561
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,226
Are you all right?
- Kill.

562
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:28,489
- Oh, okay, enough of that.

563
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,362
- [Man] Kill him now.

564
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:36,018
- What, what, hold up.

565
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:38,412
Back off, back off.

566
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:39,456
Jeremiah, Jeremiah.

567
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,283
[men muttering]

568
00:28:40,327 --> 00:28:41,763
Get off!

569
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:44,244
[tires screeching]
[body thudding]

570
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:45,898
[thrilling music]

571
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:46,986
Jeremiah.

572
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,944
Buddy.

573
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:51,512
Help!

574
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:54,167
Help, we got a man
down over here!

575
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:58,214
[suspenseful music]

576
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:05,395
- [Professor] There's an
old, brown battered notebook

577
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,136
in my office somewhere.

578
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,355
You have to find it, take it,

579
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:10,357
and keep it hidden at all costs.

580
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,969
The G-20 leaders meeting
downtown, they're in danger.

581
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:17,277
In fact, the whole of
downtown could be in danger.

582
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:20,759
Take down these numbers, and
keep an eye out for things

583
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:24,023
that look like strange
sonic listening devices.

584
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:25,720
They're not, they're weapons.
[device whirring]

585
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,940
They were used against
those diplomats in Cuba.

586
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,159
And don't trust anyone.

587
00:29:30,986 --> 00:29:35,817
[suspenseful music]
[device humming]

588
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,567
[device beeping]

589
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:49,613
[device sputtering]

590
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:52,660
[suspenseful music]

591
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:57,708
- You're gonna get me fired.

592
00:29:57,752 --> 00:29:59,667
- I was just grabbing a book.

593
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,321
- From behind the bookcase?

594
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:04,411
- You should see where he
hid the midterm answers.

595
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:05,281
- I don't want to know.

596
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:07,675
What's it for?

597
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:09,329
- I just need it to
teach class tomorrow.

598
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:11,679
- George is teaching tomorrow.

599
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:13,463
- [sighs] You're
quite the detective.

600
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,292
- Well, I was once.

601
00:30:18,468 --> 00:30:22,516
Till I blew the whistle on
some higher-ups at the LAPD.

602
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:24,648
- Wait, you're not kidding?

603
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:28,696
I'm so sorry.

604
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:30,132
I didn't mean to
be rude earlier.

605
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:32,221
I was just, I...

606
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:35,834
Wait, why are you doing
campus security then?

607
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,357
- Like it's beneath me?

608
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,055
I get free tuition for
my law school classes.

609
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:41,665
- Oh.

610
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:45,060
- I guess you can't judge
a book by its cover, huh?

611
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:49,804
- So, are you gonna arrest me?

612
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,893
[Frank laughs]

613
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:54,069
- Is that book gonna help
you find the professor?

614
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,943
[somber music]

615
00:30:57,986 --> 00:30:59,335
Go on, get out of here.

616
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:04,166
The truth is, after
this whole break-in,

617
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,603
they're probably
gonna fire me anyway.

618
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,518
Just return it.

619
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,742
[suspenseful music]

620
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:17,440

00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:43,945
Oh!
- Oh my gosh!

[tires screeching]

630
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:46,556
- You forgot your phone.

631
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,732
Look, Esther, seriously,
what is going on?

632
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:51,561
- I'm not sure.

633
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,477
- Look, if you want me to
help you find the professor,

634
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:56,523
you gotta let me in.

635
00:31:56,566 --> 00:31:59,569
- Honestly, Frank, I am in
way over my head right now.

636
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:00,875
Everything is happening so fast.

637
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,833
I. [sighs]

638
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:03,965
I just need time to process.

639
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:11,320
[phone buttons clicking]

640
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:12,539
I'm ready when you are.

641
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:16,804
- Wait, do you mind
walking me to my car?

642
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:19,328
- Sure.

643
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:20,373
- Thank you.

644
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:24,203

[Professor whimpers]

647
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:39,958
- [whimpers] No, no, no,
no, please, no, no, no.

648
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:42,134
- [Man] Where is the book?

649
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:50,838

[suspenseful music]
[wave humming]

656
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:04,694
Bring the book.

657
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:09,177
Bring me the book.

[fist pounding]

664
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,074
- Who is it?

665
00:34:37,987 --> 00:34:40,643
[fist pounding]

666
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,387

[fist pounding]

668
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:51,089
- What are you,
deaf or something?

669
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,612
- What are you doing here?

670
00:34:53,308 --> 00:34:54,744
- Come here.

671
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:55,789
Let me see your eyes.

672
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:58,879
What's the last
thing you remember?

673
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:00,010
- Uh.

674
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:05,755
I, I don't know, I
can't remember anything.

675
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:07,192
- There was a guy
outside your window

676
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:10,369
in a car pointing some
kind of weird gun at you.

677
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:15,722
He's gone.

678
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:17,680
The car's gone.

679
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:20,944
I told you not to mess
with these people.

680
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:22,076
- Who are they?

681
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,948
I don't know,
Russian, Chinese, NSA.

682
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:26,602
Doesn't matter,
they're gone now.

683
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:29,083
[Esther sighs]

684
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,737
- This stupid notebook.

685
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:32,739
- Where is it?

686
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:36,960
- How did, how did you
know they were out there?

687
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:38,484
- Look, I've been coming by.

688
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:44,054
- I have to find the professor.

689
00:35:44,098 --> 00:35:47,797
- Hey, look, we're gonna
get you out of this, okay?

690
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:52,976
- Would you sleep on
the couch tonight?

691
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:02,203
[footsteps pattering]

[objects rattling]
[walls rumbling]

695
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:22,484
- [Jeremiah] Look
at me, look at me.

696
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:24,225
- Something is wrong here.

697
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:25,487
I think the professor's missing.

698
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:26,836
[dramatic pounding]

699
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,838
- My research has been hijacked.

700
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:31,058
They killed my
financier, Douglas Cole.

701
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:32,755
I'’m afraid I may be next.

702
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:34,061
[energy buzzing]

703
00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:35,149
- I told you not to
mess with these people.

704
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,368
[tires rumbling]

705
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:38,761
I don't know,
Russian, Chinese, NSA.

706
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:40,241
- Let's just say there
are a lot of things

707
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:42,243
at stake with your
professor's research.

708
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:45,507
- Dr. Conrad had acquired
a leather-bound notebook

709
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:47,814
that is critical
to our research.

710
00:36:47,857 --> 00:36:49,250
Perhaps you may
have come across it.

711
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:50,904
- [Announcer] President
Trump called the sonic weapon

712
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:53,036
attacks in Cuba highly unusual.

713
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,082
[dramatic pounding]

714
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,910
- That look like strange

00:46:52,722 --> 00:46:54,724
Maybe I was under
the impression that...

894
00:46:56,901 --> 00:46:57,727
Forget it.

895
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:00,905
- Well, he wasn't
much help anyway.

896
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:06,519
- But you still didn't
answer my question.

897
00:47:08,477 --> 00:47:11,437
- Yes, I want your help.

898
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,700
- I just wanted to hear it.

899
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,225
Looks like quite the mess.

900
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:20,054
You didn't call me over just
to help clean up, did you?

901
00:47:20,098 --> 00:47:23,101
- No, someone broke in here
and they took that notebook.

902
00:47:23,144 --> 00:47:26,147
- Oh, it's gonna cost
you a big library fine.

903
00:47:26,191 --> 00:47:27,670
- This isn't funny.

904
00:47:27,714 --> 00:47:29,890
I have almost gotten killed,
my brother and my professor

905
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:31,979
are missing, and
this group is trying

906
00:47:32,023 --> 00:47:34,460
to create this earthquake
that could collapse all

907
00:47:34,503 --> 00:47:35,983
of downtown during the G-20.

908
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:39,944
- Okay, what
proof do you have?

909
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:41,684
- [sighs] Well, I
went to this group

910
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:43,164
that the professor
used to work for.

911
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:46,385
It's called FIT, and they
had his pocket watch there.

912
00:47:46,428 --> 00:47:48,430
He, he would never
leave it behind.

913
00:47:48,474 --> 00:47:50,302
- And?

914
00:47:50,345 --> 00:47:52,913
- Well, and they
wanted the notebook

915
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:54,523
that has all of the
formulas that they can

916
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:57,787
create the big earthquake, and
I had it, and now it's gone.

917
00:47:57,831 --> 00:47:59,180
And now I have nothing
to bargain with

918
00:47:59,224 --> 00:48:00,268
to get the professor back.

919
00:48:02,183 --> 00:48:04,620
- Well, if this FIT group
didn't take it, then who did?

920
00:48:04,664 --> 00:48:06,492
- I don't know.

921
00:48:06,535 --> 00:48:07,710
Are you gonna help me or not?

922
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:18,721
- You could always bluff.

923
00:48:20,114 --> 00:48:21,159
- What?

924
00:48:22,377 --> 00:48:23,552
- You say you need
this notebook to trade

925
00:48:23,596 --> 00:48:25,511
to get the professor back.

926
00:48:25,554 --> 00:48:27,643
Call him, tell him you have it.

927
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:30,777
- Then what?
- I don't know,

928
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,387
but we'll figure something out.

929
00:48:33,345 --> 00:48:36,609
But first, we're
gonna need a team.

930
00:48:36,652 --> 00:48:39,394
[upbeat rock music]

931
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,577

[computer beeping]

932
00:48:48,621 --> 00:48:49,927
- Oh yeah.

934
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:06,247
[wings flapping]

935
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:08,336
- Rocky, again with the wings.

936
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,382
- You said full battle gear.

937
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:12,558
You want this domain
protected or not?

938
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:14,342
- This is such a bad idea.

939
00:49:14,386 --> 00:49:15,996
- What's with the outfit?

940
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,346
- She's a LARPer, a
Live Action Role Player.

941
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,086
Weekend warrior.

942
00:49:21,393 --> 00:49:24,352
Teams, costumes, plastic
swords, the whole nine yards.

943
00:49:24,396 --> 00:49:26,964
City parks become
galactic battlegrounds.

944
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,226
Save the universe.

945
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:29,923
- [Both] Save the Universe!

946
00:49:31,055 --> 00:49:34,014
- Hey, she's the best
hacker in school, you know.

947
00:49:34,058 --> 00:49:36,669
- And my mojo is
better than yours.

948
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:39,802
- And your mojo is
better than mine.

949
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:43,067
- All right, guys,
let's do this!

950
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,938
- Pull up the schematics on FIT.

951
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,200
- All right.

952
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:50,813
Dude, this used to be
a private mental asylum

953
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:52,902
for the wealthy.

954
00:49:52,946 --> 00:49:55,688
The basement is where they
keep the silver spoon wackos.

955
00:49:55,731 --> 00:49:56,819
- Well, the labs
are in the basement,

956
00:49:56,863 --> 00:49:59,648
so I bet that's where
the professor is.

957
00:49:59,692 --> 00:50:01,128
- Okay, we park
the van out front.

958
00:50:01,172 --> 00:50:02,651
Esther is gonna tell 'em
she found the notebook,

959
00:50:02,695 --> 00:50:03,826
and they'll let us in.

960
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,741
Paul, you sneak onto the grounds

961
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:08,483
and find an entrance
through the back door.

962
00:50:08,527 --> 00:50:10,442
Rocky, you hack into the wifi

963
00:50:10,485 --> 00:50:13,140
and set off a fire
alarm at precisely 8:05.

964
00:50:13,184 --> 00:50:15,882
- Fire alarm, pfft,
I got it in my sleep.

965
00:50:15,925 --> 00:50:16,883
- Okay, when the alarm goes off,

966
00:50:16,926 --> 00:50:18,711
everyone will exit the building.

967
00:50:18,754 --> 00:50:20,930
The electronic door locks
will automatically open,

968
00:50:20,974 --> 00:50:22,410
and the professor gets out.

969
00:50:22,454 --> 00:50:25,457
Paul, you'll help him escape
to our van in the street.

970
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,675
And Esther keeps Cyrus busy.

971
00:50:27,676 --> 00:50:29,113
Foolproof.

972
00:50:29,156 --> 00:50:30,505
- I don't like it.

973
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:32,377
- Well, do you
have a better idea?

974
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,422
- Suppose the guards
take the professor?

975
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:39,645
- Then this is our backup plan.

976
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:43,127
- A video camera with
a wifi geo-tagger.

977
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,738
Put this on, it looks
just like a brooch.

978
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:47,087
If the professor is there,

979
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:48,045
a picture of him will
help get a warrant

980
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:49,742
to search the building.

981
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:52,701
Or hopefully you can get
Cyrus incriminating himself.

982
00:50:54,138 --> 00:50:55,574
- These contacts.

983
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:59,143
These contacts will let you

984
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:02,059
see the full
electromagnetic spectrum,

985
00:51:02,102 --> 00:51:03,712
not just visible light.

986
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:05,366
- And what will that get me?

987
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:08,717
- Body temperature
displays, heat signatures.

988
00:51:08,761 --> 00:51:10,676
You can see through walls!

989
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,590
- Night vision?

990
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:13,026
- Of course.

991
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,073
You can even see invisible
sonic frequencies.

992
00:51:16,943 --> 00:51:19,163
Sonic gunfire.

993
00:51:19,206 --> 00:51:20,947
- I want some!

994
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,470
- Patience, grasshopper.

995
00:51:22,514 --> 00:51:23,950
Okay?

996
00:51:23,993 --> 00:51:25,343
In good time, you
will all get them.

997
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:27,954
- Wait, what if the professor's
cell doesn't unlock?

- Uh huh.

- Oh, no sweat, they're
Smith Lock, old issue.

1001
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:42,708
This will confuse the lock
chip, opens it by default.

1002
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:44,927
- This is military,
where'd you get it?

1003
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:45,754
- eBay.

1004
00:51:51,586 --> 00:51:53,110
- Are we ready to rumble?

1005
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:54,198
- Let's do this.

here, get to work.

lovely to see you.

We've been expecting you.

1017

- Oh, yes, they're just
running a test in that lab.

1018
00:52:44,204 --> 00:52:46,554
So, we shouldn't stay too long.

1019
00:52:46,598 --> 00:52:48,556
They're on an extreme deadline.

1020
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,036
If you please, may
I have the notebook?

1021
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,214
- Oh, actually, I didn't know
if it was the real thing.

1022
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:57,565
So, I took some photos
of some of the pages.

1023
00:52:57,609 --> 00:52:58,871
What do you think?

1024
00:52:58,914 --> 00:53:00,873
- Well, if those aren't
Tesla's initials,

1025
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:02,875
they're quite a good forgery.

1026
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:04,181
If you don't mind, I'm
gonna have to keep this.

1027

- Wait, actually, I do mind.

1028
00:53:06,618 --> 00:53:08,663
I was just gonna text a
few friends about dinner,

1029
00:53:08,707 --> 00:53:10,230
you know, but.

1030
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:13,407
- Ms. Dahlset, I think it's
time we stopped playing games.

1031
00:53:13,451 --> 00:53:15,757
I believe this is what
you're looking for.

A fire alarm, perhaps?

1038
00:53:28,944 --> 00:53:30,511
Oh, yes, we've been
tapping your phone.

1039
00:53:30,555 --> 00:53:33,035
Let me make this simple.

1040
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:35,516
Tell me where the

to move the van.

- We're picking up someone.

1049

1050
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,897
Move, now.

1051
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:09,942

- They weren't always like this.

1063

We were trying to save lives
by stopping earthquakes.

1064
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:10,089
- They're starting them,
they're killing innocent people.

1065
00:55:10,132 --> 00:55:12,700
I mean, collapsing downtown?

1066
00:55:12,744 --> 00:55:14,746

of the original plan.

00:55:15,747 --> 00:55:19,403
We were gonna fix
nature's flaws.

1068
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:21,840
Just trying to help
its evolution.

1069
00:55:23,232 --> 00:55:25,670
- Sounds to me like you
were trying to play God.

1070
00:55:25,713 --> 00:55:30,196
- I was just trying to use
my science to perfect nature.

1071
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:34,940
- And the goal being
what, to better humanity?

1072
00:55:36,202 --> 00:55:38,160
I mean, it seems like
you get to decide

1073
00:55:38,204 --> 00:55:39,858
who lives and who dies.

1074
00:55:39,901 --> 00:55:43,427
The weak, like my brother.
What, he's just tossed aside?

1075
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:45,733
- FIT is targeting the G-20.

1076
00:55:45,777 --> 00:55:47,779
- Yeah, we know.

1077
00:55:47,822 --> 00:55:49,346
Can we stop it?

1078
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:50,782
- Maybe.

1079
00:55:51,435 --> 00:55:52,349
But not from here.

- Keep it on him.

1087
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,640
- No, no, no, no, please!

1088
00:56:22,683 --> 00:56:23,815
- Wait, no, hey!

1089
00:56:23,858 --> 00:56:25,077
- On your knees.

1090
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,339
- Why are you doing this?

1091
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,211
- The human race has to evolve.

1092
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:31,431
- By destroying Los Angeles?

1093
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:35,000
- By replacing leaders who
don't share our beliefs

1094
00:56:35,043 --> 00:56:36,393
with those who do.

1095
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:37,872
- You'll never get
away with this.

1096
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:40,571
- It's an earthquake,
a natural disaster.

1097
00:56:40,614 --> 00:56:42,703
They'll pin it on
the usual suspects.

1098
00:56:42,747 --> 00:56:45,793
Mother nature,
the universe, God.

1099
00:56:47,665 --> 00:56:51,103
Now, if you please, where is
the rest of that notebook?

1100
00:56:51,146 --> 00:56:54,323
- Why, so you can create
even bigger disasters?

1101
00:56:54,367 --> 00:56:56,978
- You don't seem to be
grasping how this works.

1103
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:59,416

[Professor groans]

1105
00:57:00,286 --> 00:57:01,287
The notebook!

1106
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,680
- I don't have it.
- Again.

[gun buzzes]
[Professor groans]

1108
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:05,378
- No, don't, stop!

1109
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,032
- Where's the rest
of that notebook?

1110
00:57:07,075 --> 00:57:09,295
The professor knows
better than anyone,

1111
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:12,429
we as a species are on
the verge of extinction,

1112
00:57:12,472 --> 00:57:14,735
and the remedy lies
within that book.

1113
00:57:14,779 --> 00:57:16,955
You see, we can no longer
be subject to the whims

1114
00:57:16,998 --> 00:57:18,826
of these inept politicians,

1115
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:22,482
whose policies maintain the
survival of the weakest.

1116
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:25,180
We need to establish
a new world order

1117
00:57:25,224 --> 00:57:27,356
where only the fittest may rule.

1118
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,403
- No, no, we all have value.

1119
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,449
People are created equally.

1120
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:33,885
- We weren't created.

1121
00:57:33,928 --> 00:57:36,888
We're merely a product
of time and chance.

1122
00:57:37,802 --> 00:57:41,762
Either we take control
of our own destiny,

1123
00:57:41,806 --> 00:57:43,764
or we go the way
of the dinosaurs.

1124
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:46,288
- What about people
that, that are deaf, hm?

1125
00:57:46,332 --> 00:57:48,421
Or maybe not as smart?

1126
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,857
We just do away with them.

1127
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:52,077
- I think Nietzsche
had it right.

1128
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,688
If we are to build a superhuman,

1129
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:58,692
we must first eliminate
those who are flawed.

1130
00:57:58,736 --> 00:58:01,347
- Cyrus, please, this isn't
what we set out to do.

1131
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,871
- Shh, but it's what we must do.

1132
00:58:03,915 --> 00:58:08,180
Now please, let's make
it easy on all of us.

1133
00:58:08,223 --> 00:58:09,616
Where's the rest of that book?

- Give her a blast
every five minutes

1139
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:24,239
until she changes her mind.

1172

create even-- [button clicking]

1221

You did the right
thing in coming to me.

1222
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,658

- Yeah.

1229
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:30,763
They must've had a contingency
for something like this.

- So, what now?

1231
01:03:32,243 --> 01:03:33,679
- Well, we tighten

1232

and we start to track them down.

1233

- No, I heard that they
can remotely access

1234
01:03:37,726 --> 01:03:39,728
the HAARP arrays, which means
they could set off this quake

01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:02,142
- Well, I'd still like to
see him as soon as possible.

1243
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:05,058
In fact, I'd like to see the
whole team for a debrief.

1244
01:04:05,102 --> 01:04:06,668
Could you get them
here within the hour?

1245
01:04:06,712 --> 01:04:08,148
- Sure, we can do that.

1246
01:04:08,192 --> 01:04:09,236
- Good.

1247
01:04:10,063 --> 01:04:11,108
Oh, and Frank.

1248
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:15,286
I owe you an apology.

1249
01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:17,157
I underestimated you.

1250
01:04:17,201 --> 01:04:18,332
You're a good cop.

1251
01:04:19,203 --> 01:04:19,986
No hard feelings?

1252
01:04:23,642 --> 01:04:24,425
- Freeze that.

1253

[suspenseful music]

1256
01:04:27,646 --> 01:04:28,429
- None at all.

1257

[suspenseful music]

1258
01:04:34,566 --> 01:04:35,741
- See you shortly.

1259
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:39,527
- I think that went really well.

1260
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:43,444
- We need to get outta here.

1261
01:04:44,532 --> 01:04:45,272
- What?

1262
01:04:45,316 --> 01:04:46,752
What's wrong?

1263
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:47,971
- Did you see the
lighting tattoo?

1264
01:04:48,014 --> 01:04:50,016
It's the same as the
video on the break-in.

1265
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,713
- Wait, you think
he's working for FIT?

1266
01:04:51,757 --> 01:04:53,193
- Absolutely, come on.

1267
01:04:53,237 --> 01:04:55,239
[suspenseful music]

1268
01:04:55,282 --> 01:04:56,501
Come on.

[suspenseful music]

1273
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:14,823
- So?

1274
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:15,737
- Colin is definitely involved.

1275
01:05:15,781 --> 01:05:17,174
- Then we go to the police.

1276
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:19,219
- No, I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

1277
01:05:19,263 --> 01:05:21,221
- Look, if the FBI
has been compromised,

1278
01:05:21,265 --> 01:05:24,398
then you can bet the
police have been, too.

1279
01:05:24,442 --> 01:05:26,531
FIT's got people everywhere.

1280
01:05:26,574 --> 01:05:28,315
- We're gonna have to
do this all ourselves.

1281
01:05:28,359 --> 01:05:29,795
- Are we safe here?

1282
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:32,145
- It's a homeless shelter,
they're not coming here.

1283
01:05:33,016 --> 01:05:35,192
- So, do we have a plan?

1284
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:37,716
- As a matter of fact, we do.

1285
01:05:37,759 --> 01:05:40,675
You see, they're planning to

1286
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:44,244
trigger a destructive seismic
wave in one direction,

1287
01:05:44,288 --> 01:05:46,768
so we will generate
a similar wave

1288
01:05:46,812 --> 01:05:49,467
in the opposite direction.

1289
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,338
- Oh, sorta like the
noise canceling earbuds

1290
01:05:51,382 --> 01:05:53,558
that I use to drown out Frank.

1291
01:05:53,601 --> 01:05:55,429
- Oh, something like that.

1292
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:58,432
The fact is that
the result will be,

1293
01:05:58,476 --> 01:06:02,219
there'll be no wave, or at least
a significantly weaker one.

1294
01:06:02,262 --> 01:06:02,871
- Paul.

1295
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:06,266
You were amazing today.

1296
01:06:07,137 --> 01:06:09,791
- Yeah right.
- No, I mean it.

1297
01:06:09,835 --> 01:06:12,229
It was nice getting to hang
with my big brother again.

1298
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:15,188
- Oh.

1299
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:16,798
I had this.

1300
01:06:18,104 --> 01:06:20,367
Meant to return it.

1301
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:21,586
- [Esther] Oh.

1302
01:06:21,629 --> 01:06:24,197
[gentle music]

1303
01:06:30,899 --> 01:06:32,118
Come on.

1304
01:06:32,162 --> 01:06:34,033
- Professor, before
you lay out the plan,

1305
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:36,253
I think I can speak for
all of us when I say

1306
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:38,820
we need to know
where your heart is.

1307
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:42,215
Tomorrow's not a drill.

1308
01:06:42,259 --> 01:06:45,088
Our lives are on the line,
along with all of L.A.

1309
01:06:46,045 --> 01:06:49,440
Is your allegiance still
with FIT or with us?

1310
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:51,920
- Fair question.

1311
01:06:52,486 --> 01:06:56,882
I, uh, I need to
apologize to all of you.

1312
01:06:56,925 --> 01:07:00,016
[sighs] As you know,
I'm a pompous, arrogant,

1313
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:02,322
old-fashioned academic.

1314
01:07:02,366 --> 01:07:06,413
I haven't treated you with
the respect that you deserve,

1315
01:07:06,457 --> 01:07:10,461
well, anyone deserves for
that matter, until today.

1316
01:07:11,505 --> 01:07:15,509
From here on in, I
will be honored to work

1317
01:07:15,553 --> 01:07:17,468
alongside each and
every one of you.

1318
01:07:17,511 --> 01:07:19,035
[hand patting]

1319
01:07:19,078 --> 01:07:22,342
So, shall we stop this thing?

1320
01:07:23,952 --> 01:07:24,736
- I'm in.

1321
01:07:25,693 --> 01:07:26,477
- In.
- In.

1322
01:07:27,434 --> 01:07:28,870
- In.

1323
01:07:28,914 --> 01:07:32,135
- Well, I'm like
totally in. [laughs]

1324
01:07:32,178 --> 01:07:34,485
- Oh, well, I'm
like totally in, too.

1325
01:07:34,528 --> 01:07:35,703
[group laughing]

1326
01:07:35,747 --> 01:07:37,357
- [Together] Yeah!

1327
01:07:37,401 --> 01:07:40,447
[thrilling music]

1328
01:07:42,406 --> 01:07:43,929
- [George] At least
without the notebook,

1329
01:07:43,972 --> 01:07:46,105
they can't create
a bigger quake.

1330
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:48,194
- [Professor] Yeah, but
they still could collapse

1331
01:07:48,238 --> 01:07:49,587
most of downtown.

1332
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:52,416
[thrilling music]

1333
01:08:01,947 --> 01:08:03,514
Even without Tesla's notebook,

1334
01:08:03,557 --> 01:08:06,125
FIT's been able to
assemble three HAARP arrays

1335
01:08:06,169 --> 01:08:09,955
located on freighters
about 12 miles offshore.

1336
01:08:09,998 --> 01:08:11,913
And each one will fire
a high-frequency pulse

1337
01:08:11,957 --> 01:08:13,350
into the ionosphere.

1338
01:08:13,393 --> 01:08:14,568
When it bounces back to Earth,

1339
01:08:14,612 --> 01:08:16,917
it'll trigger a
vertical seismic event

1340
01:08:16,961 --> 01:08:18,702
onto Los Angeles.

1341
01:08:18,746 --> 01:08:20,139
- To stop this,
the Professor and I

1342
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:22,968
will drive to the
mountain bluffs in my van.

1343
01:08:23,011 --> 01:08:25,970
We'll set up a microwave dish

1344
01:08:26,014 --> 01:08:28,626
to radio the beta
freighter's control system.

1345
01:08:28,669 --> 01:08:30,628
- And once I've hacked
into the beta array,

1346
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:33,544
I can send out a counterwave
to cancel out the alpha.

1347
01:08:33,586 --> 01:08:37,721
Unfortunately, the gamma
freighter's too far away.

1348
01:08:37,764 --> 01:08:39,202
Esther and Paul,

1349
01:08:39,245 --> 01:08:41,029
you guys will break
into west side command

1350
01:08:41,073 --> 01:08:42,943
that sends signals
to the freighters.

1351
01:08:42,987 --> 01:08:44,511
- Here.

1352
01:08:44,555 --> 01:08:47,949
Put this virus into their system
and it will stop the gamma.

1353
01:08:47,993 --> 01:08:52,563
- Beta down, alpha down,
gamma down, we win!

1354
01:08:52,606 --> 01:08:53,781
No earthquake!

1355
01:08:53,825 --> 01:08:55,042
[Professor chuckles]
[hands slapping]

1356
01:08:55,086 --> 01:08:56,435
- Guys, I hate to
be a spoiler here,

1357
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:59,612
but I'm not exactly the
best in an earthquake.

1358
01:08:59,657 --> 01:09:01,485
- Hey, you'll be fine,
I'll be with you.

1359
01:09:01,528 --> 01:09:04,531
- And where's this
FIT's command post?

1360
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:06,011
- And what about the guards?

1361
01:09:06,054 --> 01:09:07,491
- Yeah, well, I got a quick
look at their schematics,

1362
01:09:07,533 --> 01:09:11,886
and I think it's located
somewhere in an industrial park,

1363
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:14,367
somewhere here on the Westside.

1364
01:09:14,411 --> 01:09:16,630
Once they send signals
to the freighters,

1365
01:09:16,674 --> 01:09:19,285
I'll be able to triangulate
its exact position.

1366
01:09:19,328 --> 01:09:22,201
- So, we stage here and
wait for your signal.

1367
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:23,810
- Yeah, but what
about the guards?

1368
01:09:23,854 --> 01:09:26,553
We'd need an army
to get past them.

1369
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:27,772
- I have an army.

1370
01:09:27,815 --> 01:09:28,728
- The role players?

1371
01:09:28,773 --> 01:09:30,731
Oh no.

1372
01:09:30,774 --> 01:09:32,255
- Hey, flatfoot.

1373
01:09:32,298 --> 01:09:34,560
Me, Dragonovich and Thing Master

1374
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:36,476
defeated the Queen of Darkness

1375
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,478
and a quarter of the
universe last week.

1376
01:09:38,522 --> 01:09:40,611
This is child's play.

1377
01:09:40,654 --> 01:09:42,439
- Yeah, wait a minute,
she's onto something.

1378
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:45,310
We can overwhelm the
guards with numbers.

1379
01:09:45,354 --> 01:09:47,226
I mean, they're not gonna

1380
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:49,054
shoot a bunch of
superheroes, right?

1381
01:09:49,096 --> 01:09:50,185
- Yeah, the last thing FIT wants

1382
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:52,231
is attention from
the police, right?

1383
01:09:52,274 --> 01:09:54,799
- Frank, how many burgers do
you think you could wrangle up?

1384
01:09:54,842 --> 01:09:55,800
- Why?

1385
01:09:55,843 --> 01:09:57,062
- I have an idea.

1386
01:09:57,105 --> 01:09:58,411
- Save the universe?

1387
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,022

will meet to determine the
future of our economies.

1393
01:10:19,084 --> 01:10:20,912

is allowed inside.

I just need to make a
couple more calculations.

1424

01:20:06,236 --> 01:20:08,847
temporarily halting
the G-20 Summit.

1595
01:20:08,891 --> 01:20:11,850
Caltech reported it could
have been much worse.

1596
01:20:11,894 --> 01:20:13,286
The vertical shift
fault could have

1597
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:15,941
brought the entire
central district down.

1598
01:20:15,985 --> 01:20:18,770
[somber music]

1599
01:20:20,641 --> 01:20:25,646
[footsteps pattering]
[somber music]

1600
01:20:36,222 --> 01:20:39,008
- Stuart's last words
were, "Thank you."

1601
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:40,574
He didn't have a wife or kids,

1602
01:20:40,618 --> 01:20:43,621
but he said that you were the
closest family he ever had.

1603
01:20:48,321 --> 01:20:50,715
- This garden was
like a home to him.

1604
01:20:50,758 --> 01:20:53,282
He asked that his
ashes be spread here.

1605
01:20:54,327 --> 01:20:55,459
[phone beeping]

1606
01:20:55,502 --> 01:20:58,288
[lid clanging]

1607
01:20:59,724 --> 01:21:03,162
[ashes rattling softly]

1608
01:21:05,338 --> 01:21:07,601
[lid clanging]

1609
01:21:07,645 --> 01:21:09,299
- He was proud of you, you know.

1610
01:21:11,344 --> 01:21:12,476
- I know.

1611
01:21:13,433 --> 01:21:16,393
I feel like that's
why I owe it to him

1612
01:21:16,436 --> 01:21:19,787
to continue his work and use
it as he originally intended.

1613
01:21:24,357 --> 01:21:26,272
- So, what did the FBI
say about Colin?

1614
01:21:27,056 --> 01:21:28,579
- The usual stonewalling.

1615
01:21:29,536 --> 01:21:31,755
They can't comment on an
ongoing investigation.

1616
01:21:34,367 --> 01:21:35,891
What about you?

1617
01:21:35,934 --> 01:21:37,805
- I asked Paul to come stay
with me while he was in rehab

1618
01:21:37,849 --> 01:21:39,633
and looking for a new job.

1619
01:21:40,764 --> 01:21:41,766
- What type of job?

1620
01:21:42,767 --> 01:21:44,290
- I don't know.

1621
01:21:44,334 --> 01:21:46,205
But I'm thinking about putting
together a platoon of vets

1622
01:21:46,249 --> 01:21:48,294
to take down mad scientists.

1623
01:21:48,338 --> 01:21:50,209
[group laughing]

1624
01:21:50,253 --> 01:21:51,036
You?

1625
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:55,388
- Continue taking night
classes to get my law degree.

1626
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:58,304
Staying in town.

1627
01:22:00,002 --> 01:22:01,438
- In town is good.

1628
01:22:01,481 --> 01:22:02,526
- [George] Oh.

1629
01:22:02,568 --> 01:22:04,397
- Oooh!

1630
01:22:04,441 --> 01:22:07,748
[George laughs]
[Rocky laughs]

1631
01:22:07,791 --> 01:22:09,576
All right, you guys ready?

1632
01:22:10,621 --> 01:22:15,626
[somber music]
[gravel crunching]

1633
01:22:22,546 --> 01:22:25,027
Wait, did we ever
find the notebook?

1634
01:22:26,028 --> 01:22:28,204
- Well, the formulas in
there could literally

1635
01:22:28,246 --> 01:22:30,728
change the balance of
power of the world,

1636
01:22:30,771 --> 01:22:33,557
so if FIT doesn't
have it then who does?

1637
01:22:34,818 --> 01:22:35,820
- What, the notebook?

1638
01:22:36,995 --> 01:22:38,518
Oh, I hid that.

1639
01:22:38,562 --> 01:22:40,216
- [Group] What?

1640
01:22:40,259 --> 01:22:43,045
- What, so they couldn't
connect it with you.

1641
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:44,611
Look, I think it's
caused enough trouble

1642
01:22:44,655 --> 01:22:47,179
and maybe it needs to stay lost
for a few more generations.

1643
01:22:50,661 --> 01:22:52,402
I hid it with Vic,
one of the vets.

1644
01:22:53,142 --> 01:22:54,795
No one will ever find it.

1645
01:22:56,058 --> 01:22:59,713
Believe me, the future
of mankind is safe.

1646
01:23:00,452 --> 01:23:03,239
[thrilling music]

1647
01:23:14,598 --> 01:23:16,904
[bag rustling]

1648
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:22,258
[thrilling music]

1649
01:23:27,611 --> 01:23:30,657
- [Man] Bring me the book!

1650
01:23:32,398 --> 01:23:35,401
[suspenseful music]

1651
01:24:12,656 --> 01:24:15,441
[thrilling music]

1652
01:25:18,548 --> 01:25:20,941
[somber music]

1653
01:25:24,771 --> 01:25:27,557
[thrilling music]

1654
01:27:34,684 --> 01:27:37,513
[somber music]

1655
01:28:08,152 --> 01:28:10,937
[thrilling music]

1656
01:30:15,018 --> 01:30:17,716
[helicopter propellers whipping]

1657
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,545
[thrilling music]
