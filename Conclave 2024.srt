1
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,790
 Amen.

2
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,130
 He is with the Lord.

3
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,060
 The papal throne has become vacant.

4
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,030
 "Aldo."

5
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,120
 Do you think anyone will mind if I take the chessboard?

6
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,960
 - As a memento. - Of course, take it.

7
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,790
 He wanted you to have it.

8
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,060
 Because we used to play a lot in the evening.

9
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,730
 He used to say that playing chess helped him relax.

10
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,270
 - And who won? - He did.

11
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,210
 He was always eight steps ahead.

12
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,480
 My deepest condolences, Aldo.

13
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,480
 What happened?

14
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,020
 Do you know?

15
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,480
 No, they say he had a heart attack, but...

16
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,820
 They warned him.

17
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,390
 I haven't heard of that.

18
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,330
 Yes, he didn't want anyone to know.

19
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,930
 He was afraid that if the news spread, they would start

20
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,230
 circulating rumors that he intended to resign.

21
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,830
 The papal court.

22
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,270
 Yes.

23
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,240
 Okay.

24
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,940
 "Janusz."

25
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,390
 I know this is hard on you,

26
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,290
 but we will have to prepare a detailed statement.

27
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,960
 Who discovered the Pope's death?

28
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,860
 I did, Your Eminence.

29
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,070
 And what did you do afterward?

30
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,270
 I called the Pope's doctor.

31
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,240
 But it was too late.

32
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,240
 What time did you make the call?

33
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,180
 Around 11:30, Your Eminence.

34
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,090
 We would have called you earlier, but...

35
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,490
 My deepest condolences, Thomas.

36
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,900
 I know His Holiness didn't have close colleagues like you and Aldo,

37
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,500
 but I asked Janusz to stop speaking with you.

38
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,000
 I wanted to verify all the facts.

39
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,410
 You know how rumors spread.

40
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,340
 I've prepared a timeline for His Holiness's last day.

41
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,950
 And these are the latest medical reports for Pope Francis.

42
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,050
 And who was the last to meet with him?

43
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,550
 I believe it was me.

44
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,920
 Father Wozniak, were you the last to meet with him?

45
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,290
 Yes, Your Eminence Tremblay.

46
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,960
 Record all the meetings he had that day.

47
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,630
 They will show how much effort he exerted until his last breath.

48
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,300
 Okay, it seems

49
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,610
 we placed a great burden on a sick man.

50
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,610
 The papacy is a great burden.

51
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,110
 Especially for an old man.

52
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,150
 Well, Dean, it seems the responsibility for the meeting falls on you.

53
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,670
 Seal the room.

54
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,080
 "Three weeks after the conclave convened"

55
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,670
 The security agencies say they want to test the electronic jamming devices

56
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,210
 - One last time, Your Eminence. - Let them do it quickly.

57
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,610
 Is this really necessary, Willy?

58
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,150
 Apparently so.

59
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,350
 They say eavesdroppers can use lasers to read vibrations on glass.

60
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,420
 Really? Let's hope none of our brethren suffer from claustrophobia.

61
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,490
 And who knows how long we will be here?

62
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,290
 Can you assure me that we will finish on time?

63
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,330
 They will work all night if they have to.

64
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,660
 It will be simple, Your Eminence. It always is.

65
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,730
 - It's Italy, you know. - I apologize for the inconvenience.

66
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,800
 Well, Your Eminence, I want to say this is a fair version of hell.

67
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,470
 Don't speak blasphemy, Ray.

68
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,770
 Hell will come tomorrow when we bring in the cardinals. [Cardinals: responsible for choosing the new pope]

69
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,310
 How do I pronounce this word?

70
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,150
 "Kakal," Your Eminence. It's Indian.

71
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,220
 "Kakal." Thank you.

72
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,260
 Archbishop Wozniak has requested to speak with Your Eminence.

73
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,330
 I don't think that's possible. The cardinals will arrive in an hour.

74
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,530
 - What's the matter? - He didn't specify.

75
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,160
 I wouldn't have remembered the issue.

76
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,370
 It's just that he seemed very upset.

77
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,270
 Ray, we will be secluded from 6:00.

78
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,700
 He should have come to me earlier.

79
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,070
 Yes, Your Eminence. I will inform him of that.

80
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,680
 No, Ray, tell him I will see him after I meet the cardinals.

81
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,680
 The poor man will be worried about his future.

82
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,760
 How many people have come, Willy?

83
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,370
 103, Your Eminence Lawrence.

84
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,270
 I wonder where Tedisco went.

85
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,400
 - Perhaps he won't come. - It's too much to hope for.

86
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,640
 We can wait inside if you prefer.

87
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,610
 No, let's stay here and take in the fresh air.

88
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,580
 Father Bellini.

89
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,620
 "Aldo."

90
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,990
 - Am I the last to arrive? - Not quite. How are you?

91
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,430
 Well, as you know, in a terrible state.

92
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,690
 Have you read the newspapers?

93
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,430
 Apparently, they've decided that I'm the new pope.

94
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,430
 And I agree with them.

95
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,570
 What if I don't want the position?

96
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,900
 No sane man would want the papacy.

97
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,740
 It seems some of our colleagues desire the position.

98
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,810
 What if I know deep in my heart that I am not worthy of the position?

99
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,780
 - You deserve it more than any of us. - I'm not.

100
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,310
 Then tell your supporters not to vote for you,

101
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,980
 so you don't bear the burden.

102
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,780
 And leave the position to him?

103
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,320
 I couldn't live knowing what I had done.

104
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,220
 Your Eminence Tedisco.

105
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,990
 Dean Lawrence!

106
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,880
 How are you?

107
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,050
 I'm fine, Goffredo.

108
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,430
 Sorry, my train was delayed from Venice.

109
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,310
 - We've missed you. - Yes.

110
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,450
 I'm sure of that.

111
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,600
 But don't worry.

112
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,440
 My friends have kept me informed.

113
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,690
 Are you okay?

114
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,610
 No. No one is okay at our age, right?

115
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,380
 And you?

116
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,350
 How do you feel with this...

117
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,820
 new responsibility?

118
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,550
 Is everything under control? Yes, I think so.

119
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,050
 Your Eminence Goffredo, may I?

120
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,890
 No!

121
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,560
 See you later.

122
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,400
 You're welcome. See you later, Your Eminence.

123
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,810
 My God. It's large.

124
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,210
 Apparently, Pope John XXIII was too fat to wear a cassock,

125
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,280
 so they had to split the seams in the back for him to wear it.

126
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,160
 You look tired.

127
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,690
 All this is a duty I never thought I would have to undertake.

128
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,800
 I thought he would outlive all of us.

129
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,770
 Our farewell wasn't good.

130
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,040
 I asked him for permission to resign from my position as Dean.

131
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,140
To join the monastery.

132
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,810
What was his response?

133
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,750
He rejected my resignation.

134
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,790
He said some were chosen to be shepherds
and others to manage.

135
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,720
Apparently I&#39;ve been selected for management.

136
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,030
He told me about your crisis of faith.

137
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:33,570
But you should know
that he had doubts too.

138
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,200
Did the Pope have doubts about God?

139
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
no.

140
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,040
He did not doubt the Lord.

141
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,280
What he has lost faith in is the church.

142
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,980
Father Wozniak?

143
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,350
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

144
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,990
- My last confession was four weeks ago. 
- &quot;Yanush.&quot;

145
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,750
&quot;Yanush,&quot; I don&#39;t have time to hear your confession.

146
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,960
There is still a lot to do.

147
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,060
Have you been drinking?

148
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,960
What&#39;s worrying you? Tell me.

149
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,100
I should have come to you before.

150
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,900
But I promised not to say anything.

151
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,040
- Who did you promise to? 
- Cardinal Tremblay.

152
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,940
&quot;Yanush,&quot; the doors will close soon and you will have to leave.

153
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,310
If you promised Cardinal Tremblay, then perhaps it is not right that...

154
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,110
The day the Pope died,

155
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,390
The last person he had an official appointment with was Cardinal Tremblay.

156
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,390
Yes, I know that.
It&#39;s on the official timeline.

157
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,720
The Pope excommunicated him at that meeting.

158
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,330
What?

159
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,160
He kicked him out.

160
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,630
Why?

161
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,800
For gross misconduct.

162
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,740
And you&#39;re telling me this now?

163
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,110
We&#39;re about to be isolated, Janusz.

164
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:51,210
Forgive me, but I only started hearing the rumors in the last few days.

165
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,250
- Any rumors?
- That he might be elected pope.

166
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,720
And you think it&#39;s your duty to prevent that, right?

167
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,820
I don&#39;t know what my duty is anymore.

168
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,400
Were you present at the meeting?

169
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,000
No, your excellency.

170
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,440
The Pope told me
after the meeting was over,

171
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,140
When we had dinner.

172
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,810
Shall I tell you why Eminence Tremblay was fired?

173
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,680
no.

174
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,050
He said the reasons would soon become clear.

175
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,270
Brigadier General Lawrence.

176
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,370
There is a problem.

177
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,110
Oh, my God.

178
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,410
Did someone die?

179
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,240
- Excuse me?
- Did we lose a cardinal?

180
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,410
No, Your Honor.
Looks like we got one.

181
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,880
I mean that literally.

182
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,450
Another cardinal just came.

183
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,920
So it seems we forgot to include Cardinal in the list.

184
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,890
His name was not on our list, Your Eminence.

185
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,990
He says he was appointed Cardinal
in secret.

186
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,160
No, he must be a scammer.

187
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,130
That&#39;s what I thought, Your Eminence.

188
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,970
But Archbishop Mandorf
 talked to him and didn&#39;t think he was a fraud.

189
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,800
Well, what did you hear?

190
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,870
His name is &quot;Vincent Benitez&quot;, Your Eminence.

191
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,940
He is the Archbishop of Kabul.

192
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,980
Archbishop where?

193
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,910
&quot;Kabul.&quot; But he&#39;s Mexican.

194
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,420
He was appointed by the Pope last year.

195
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,890
Last year? So how was this kept hidden all this time?

196
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,050
I thought you might know about his promotion.

197
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:48,960
No, I&#39;m not.

198
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,090
Ray, have Eminence Bellenia join us.

199
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,890
Maybe he knows something about this.

200
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,330
- Yes, Your Eminence. 
- Thank you.

201
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,000
He has a letter of appointment from the Pope.

202
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,270
Addressed to the Archdiocese of Kabul,

203
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,000
Which they kept secret at the request of the Pope.

204
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,970
Do you think he forged the letter?

205
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,380
Where is he now?

206
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,050
Cardinal in Afghanistan?

207
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,620
This is ridiculous.

208
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,320
How many Catholics are there in Afghanistan?

209
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,420
He was the head of the Catholic mission there.

210
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,990
Until he was promoted.

211
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,190
But how do we ensure his safety?

212
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,590
This is probably why the Pope wanted to keep his promotion a secret.

213
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,860
Well, his status is not a secret anymore.

214
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,600
I don&#39;t think we have a choice but to acknowledge it.

215
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,100
Hold on, Thomas.

216
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,470
Are we sure that the Pope

217
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,540
He was fully qualified.

218
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,980
When did he make this appointment?

219
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,490
I think this man is a cardinal, legally speaking, Aldo.

220
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,360
I believe he has the right to participate in the elections.

221
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,350
Your Eminences,
Before we eat,

222
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,620
I would like to introduce you to a new member of our sect,

223
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,130
whose existence was unknown to any of us,

224
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,300
Until a few hours.

225
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,130
The reason is because our brother became a cardinal.

226
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,100
Completely legal

227
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,170
Secretly.

228
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,340
The reason why he had to be appointed this way

229
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,110
Only God and the late Pope know.

230
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,610
But I think we can guess why,

231
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:57,580
Because the service our new brother was performing was a very dangerous service.

232
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:02,020
Welcome to our community 
Vincent Benitez,

233
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,530
Cardinal Archbishop of Kabul.

234
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,980
Would you please bless our meal, Your Eminence?

235
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,350
naturally.

236
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,550
Bless us, O Lord, and these are your gifts,

237
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,260
Which we are about to eat please

238
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,220
Amen.

239
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,730
May the Lord bless all

240
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,120
Who can&#39;t eat this food?

241
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,680
And help us, O Lord, when we eat and drink

242
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,840
So we remember the hungry

243
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,970
and the thirsty

244
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,010
and patients

245
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,190
Waluhidin

246
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,290
And the sisters who prepared food for us

247
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,740
Thanks to (Christ) our Lord

248
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,380
Amen.

249
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,150
Amen.

250
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,760
Sit down please.

251
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,560
This is amazing...

252
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,690
Here, come on.

253
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,500
Hey Dean!

254
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,770
&quot;Lawrence&quot;!

255
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,470
I have...

256
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,210
- &quot;Goffredo&quot;.
- &quot;Thomas&quot;.

257
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,930
Have a seat.

258
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,180
Have some wine.

259
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,330
Thanks.

260
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,620
Thanks.

261
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,160
 You seem worried.

262
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,440
 And we haven't even started yet.

263
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,230
 Our new brother...

264
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,700
 Is it true what I heard, "Afghanistan"?

265
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,650
 Yes.

266
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,550
 It's a testament to the power of the church's influence.

267
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,930
 Don't you think so?

268
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,590
 Many people of different races

269
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,260
 joined together in their faith in the Lord.

270
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,440
 Look around you.

271
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,640
 Notice how everyone tends to their compatriots.

272
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,150
 The Italians over there.

273
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,990
 The Spaniards over there.

274
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,740
 The English over there.

275
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,450
 Yes.

276
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,200
 The French.

277
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,800
 We are divided by language.

278
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,600
 Here you go...

279
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,580
 When we were young and it was the Tridentine Mass

280
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,940
 it was still the only true rite in the world.

281
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,750
 We all spoke Italian.

282
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,090
 But the liberals in "Telo" insisted on getting rid of that

283
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,730
 "Death" of the language.

284
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,880
 Without "Rome", without the traditions of "Rome"...

285
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,490
 Things went downhill.

286
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,700
 The system collapsed.

287
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,530
 So, what, should the new pope be Italian?

288
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,410
 Why not?

289
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,260
 Forty years, "Thomas".

290
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,570
 Do you think there's a compelling alternative?

291
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:27,970
 Excuse me, I must go to our brothers.

292
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,520
 The abyss calls.

293
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,440
 It was wise of him to stay away from "Rome" until today.

294
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,650
 If he had given one bold interview to the press

295
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,510
 he could have made "Tedesco" undesirable.

296
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,820
 But I think he will be successful tomorrow.

297
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,820
 What do you mean?

298
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,390
 I think...

299
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,390
 He will get 15 votes in the first ballot.

300
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,530
 And "Bellini"?

301
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,370
 Why do I feel like a cow whose price is being set by the farmer?

302
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,370
 The first ballot?

303
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,870
 Between 20 and 25 votes.

304
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,540
 But tomorrow night is when the real work will happen.

305
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,480
 We have to somehow get him a two-thirds majority.

306
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,550
 What exactly do you mean by "real work"?

307
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,390
 But Your Eminence "Bellini",

308
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,950
 those who seek the papacy...

309
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,590
 I am not seeking the papacy.

310
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,120
 Thank you, sisters.

311
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,980
 Listen, you don't have to do anything.

312
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,650
 Leave it to us.

313
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,650
 Tell them I support a rational approach

314
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,790
 to issues like homosexuality and divorce.

315
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,320
 Tell them I refuse to return to the days

316
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,690
 of the Latin liturgy

317
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:10,600
 or families of ten children because the mother and father are ignorant.

318
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,930
 That was an ugly, oppressive time,

319
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,700
 and I'm glad it's over.

320
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,670
 Tell them I support respecting other religions,

321
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:23,340
 tolerance for other viewpoints within our church,

322
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,610
 and tell them I believe

323
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,380
 women should play a greater role in the clergy council.

324
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,620
 Let's not mention women.

325
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,720
 Why?

326
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,490
 Brother, I have no intention

327
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,530
 of hiding my views

328
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,990
 or pretending to be someone I'm not

329
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,630
 to influence any undecided member of our congregation

330
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,930
 So...

331
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,640
 If you wish to support my cause,

332
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:53,470
 then make sure my message is clear.

333
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,780
 I support everything that "Tedesco" does not.

334
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,520
 Okay, if you'll excuse me.

335
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,090
 All right.

336
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,890
 "Rocco", talk to the Americans.

337
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,530
 "Villanova", I'll leave South America to you.

338
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,530
 "Gianmarco", handle the Africans.

339
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,930
 "Aldo" does not want the position.

340
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,570
 Any of them.

341
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,800
 You know that, right?

342
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,610
 Of course I know.
That's why I support him.

343
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,790
 The dangerous men are those who want the position.

344
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:43,820
 I'm enjoying all this mystery, "Thomas".

345
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,730
 And I think you should tell me what you want to talk about.

346
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,630
 Your last meeting with the pope.

347
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,930
 What about it?

348
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,370
 I've been told it was difficult.

349
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,570
 - Was it? - Difficult? No.

350
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,540
 I don't recall it that way.

351
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,110
 Sorry to have to ask you

352
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,480
 But to be more specific, I've been told

353
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,820
 that the pope demanded your resignation.

354
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,790
 What?

355
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,920
 That's ridiculous. I...

356
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,620
 Who told you that?

357
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,860
 - Archbishop "Wozniak". - Why would he say that?

358
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,560
 So this claim is false?

359
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,870
 Absolutely not. That's ridiculous.

360
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,500
 - No, okay, I had to ask. - I understand, but no.

361
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,770
 You can ask Bishop "Morales".

362
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,040
 He was in the meeting.

363
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,180
 Okay, I will, but for now,

364
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,980
 we happened to be secluded.

365
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,150
 Can you think of a reason

366
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,990
 why Archbishop "Wozniak" would spread such a story?

367
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
 No, I can't.

368
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,490
 Do you want coffee?

369
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,500
 No.

370
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,070
 I'm shocked.

371
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,140
 - Did he tell you this himself? - Yes.

372
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,940
 You don't think...

373
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,150
 What?

374
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,650
 Drinking.

375
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,650
 I don't like to raise this issue, but we know well

376
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,520
 that he started drinking a lot.

377
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,690
 And it might be affecting his judgment, and even his mind.

378
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,790
 And...

379
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,800
 I know my name has been mentioned as the next pope,

380
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,070
 and if the archbishop does not agree with this,

381
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,540
 maybe he...

382
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,810
 I don't know, I'm just trying to understand this.

383
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,640
 Poor thing.

384
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,950
 He was in shock because of the pope's death.

385
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,950
 Yes, that's true.

386
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,120
 I repeat my apologies, "Joe".

387
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,850
 No, don't worry about it.

388
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,990
 I completely understand.

389
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,230
 What did you discuss with the pope

390
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,060
 in that last meeting?

391
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,600
 Excuse me, "Thomas."

392
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,630
 It was a private conversation.

393
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,600
 And very precious.

394
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,770
 Those were the last words 
 I exchanged with the Pope.

395
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,640
 Yes, of course.

396
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,650
 Goodnight, "Joe."

397
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,880
 Goodnight, "Thomas."

398
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,860
 Dean.

399
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,270
 We are neighbors, "Joshua."

400
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,270
 It seems so.

401
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,840
 I thought I should...

402
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,870
 Practice more on my speech for tomorrow.

403
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,810
 Yes, of course.

404
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,680
 I look forward to hearing it.

405
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:54,580
 I understand the trick is 
 not to offend anyone.

406
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,980
 You are the responsible one.

407
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,180
 Responsible.

408
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:08,430
 "The first day of the secret conversation"

409
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,360
 Dean "Lawrence"?

410
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:28,670
 - Your Holiness. 
 - Everything is fine, thank you.

411
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,390
 My dear brothers in faith,

412
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,580
 At this moment filled with doubts

413
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,930
 In the history of the holy church,

414
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,350
 We must first think of the late Pope,

415
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:09,730
 Whose bright papacy was 
 a gift from the Lord,

416
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,520
 Now we must ask our Lord 
 to send us a new Pope

417
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:20,850
 Through the wise guidance of the Cardinals.

418
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:26,570
 And we must pray to the Lord 
 to provide us with that loving care,

419
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,150
 And ask Him to guide us

420
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:33,230
 To make the right choice.

421
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,540
 But you all know that.

422
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,380
 I want to speak from the depths of my heart for a moment.

423
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,190
 Saint Paul said, 
 "Cooperate with one another

424
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,760
 Out of respect for (Christ)."

425
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:58,260
 Working together, aging together,

426
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,600
 We should be tolerant.

427
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,270
 Without one person or group wishing 
 to impose its dominance over others.

428
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,640
 And speaking of the people of Ephesus,

429
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,610
 Who were, of course, a mix 
 of Jews and Gentiles,

430
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,480
 Paul reminds us that the gift of the Lord to the church

431
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,650
 Is its diversity.

432
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,880
 This diversity, this difference 
 in people and opinions,

433
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,820
 Is what gives our church its strength.

434
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,720
 And over many years,

435
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,890
 In the service of the holy church, 
 allow me to tell you,

436
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,400
 That there is one sin 
 I have come to fear more than others.

437
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,370
 Certainty.

438
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,300
 Certainty is the greatest enemy of unity.

439
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,810
 Certainty is the deadly enemy of tolerance.

440
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,780
 Even "Christ" was not 
 certain in the end.

441
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:57,190
 "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"

442
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:02,990
 He cried out in agony in 
 the ninth hour on the cross.

443
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:09,530
 Our faith is alive because it is accompanied by doubt.

444
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:15,270
 If there were certainty without doubt,

445
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,400
 There would be no mystery.

446
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,710
 And there would be no need for faith.

447
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,450
 Let us pray that the Lord grants us a Pope who doubts.

448
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,620
 And may He grant us a Pope who sins

449
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:36,560
 And asks for forgiveness and continues forward.

450
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,650
 Dean "Lawrence",

451
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,820
 Your speech has caused a stir.

452
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,460
 I don't think anyone expected you to...

453
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,530
 What? To say something interesting?

454
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:51,530
 I will prepare a written copy 
 of the speech.

455
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,540
 If there's nothing else you need.

456
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,780
 - Thank you. 
 - Your Holiness.

457
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,540
 Yes...

458
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,010
 I want you to do something for me.

459
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,850
 Bishop "Morales."

460
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,550
 I am sure he is still in "Rome."

461
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,990
 - Can you meet him? 
 - Today? Well, I...

462
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,590
 Use my authority.

463
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,720
 I want to know what happened 
 at the last meeting

464
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,460
 Between Cardinal "Tremblay" and the Pope.

465
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,560
 What happened?

466
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:27,570
 Specifically, did anything happen 
 that might make him unfit for the Papacy?

467
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,010
 Of course, Your Holiness.

468
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,680
 Bless you.

469
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,560
 I am Cardinal "Nakitanda"

470
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:21,150
 I pledge and swear, and may the Lord help me

471
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:26,500
 And this holy gospel of the Lord, 
 which I touch with my hand.

472
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,310
 Everyone, leave.

473
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,710
 My Cardinal brothers,

474
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,110
 We will now move to the first ballot.

475
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:14,580
 You will find your ballot paper in front of you.

476
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,810
 At the top is written 
 whom you have chosen as Pope.

477
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:24,580
 Please ensure your writing is clear.

478
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,300
 "I invoke (Christ), who will be my judge

479
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,610
 That my vote is given to he, in the Lord's sight

480
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,200
 I see must be elected."

481
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:45,200
 The first vote for Cardinal "Tedesco."

482
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:55,960
 The second vote for Cardinal "Tedesco."

483
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,660
 Cardinal "Tremblay."

484
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,110
 Cardinal "Tremblay."

485
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,820
 Cardinal "Tedesco."

486
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,820
 Cardinal "Ademi."

487
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,060
 Cardinal "Lawrence."

488
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,330
 Cardinal "Bellini."

489
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,370
 Cardinal "Bellini."

490
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,040
 Cardinal "Vilanueva."

491
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,180
 Cardinal "Tremblay."

492
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,280
 Cardinal "Ademi."

493
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,920
 Cardinal "Tremblay."

494
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,190
 Cardinal "Tedesco."

495
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,890
 Cardinal "Bellini."

496
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,000
 Cardinal "Ademi."

497
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,450
 And finally, Cardinal "Benitez."

498
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:06,580
 The results of the first ballot are...

499
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:10,610
 Cardinal "Ademi," 21 votes.

500
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:14,970
 Cardinal "Tedesco," 18 votes.

501
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,330
 Cardinal "Bellini," 17 votes.

502
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:22,870
 Cardinal "Tremblay," 16 votes.

503
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,120
 Cardinal "Lawrence," 5 votes.

504
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:32,170
 And one vote for the remaining Cardinals, 
 the total number of votes is 31.

505
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,210
 My Cardinal brothers,

506
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,440
 These are the results of the first ballot.

507
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,020
 No candidate has achieved

508
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,540
 The necessary majority of 72 votes,

509
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,840
 We will adjourn the meeting until the evening,

510
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:03,620
 And resume voting in the morning.

511
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,160
 Thank you.

512
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,400
 The media have noticed the presence of the Cardinal

513
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,670
 Whose name was not on the official list, Dean.

514
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:45,270
 Cardinal "Benitez,"

515
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:48,280
 So I have taken it upon myself 
 to draft a statement.

516
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:51,510
 I have also prepared some information for you.

517
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,420
 Ministries in "Veracruz," "Congo,"

518
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:59,690
 Where he established a hospital for female victims 
 of sexual violence

519
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,560
 During the first and second wars.

520
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:07,230
 - Then in "Baghdad" and finally in his mission in "Kabul." 
 - Okay.

521
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,470
 There were some questions regarding his resignation for health reasons,

522
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,270
 but apparently the Pope convinced him to continue.

523
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,200
 He served his ministry

524
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,570
 - in some dreadful places. - Yes.

525
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,240
 Health reasons?

526
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,010
 Can you look into this, Ray?

527
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,580
 It's a topic the press loves to hear.

528
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,310
 Of course.

529
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:28,320
 And the other matter, the...

530
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:31,190
 Yes.

531
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,720
 I spoke to Bishop Morales.

532
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,290
 He was firm in his assertion

533
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:41,100
 that he knows of no reason preventing Cardinal Tremblay from being the Pope.

534
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,170
 - Thank you. - However,

535
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,230
 would you forgive me if I said

536
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:50,610
 that I didn't completely believe the Monsignor?

537
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,480
 He was...

538
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,580
 very firm.

539
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:59,450
 My Spanish is weak, and perhaps by mistake

540
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,220
 I gave him the impression that you had seen a document

541
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,620
 contradicting his statement, and he said

542
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:08,730
 you don't need to worry, and his exact words were...

543
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,760
 A report? A report about what?

544
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,230
 When was it written?

545
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,200
 I don't know, Your Eminence.

546
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:34,680
 Third place.

547
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,720
 Not what we were hoping for.

548
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:39,590
 Your sermon didn't help us at all, and neither did your five votes.

549
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,830
 You don't have enough support to be a serious candidate.

550
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,730
 Well, my position is an embarrassment.

551
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,500
 If I discover who my supporters are,

552
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,200
 I'll beg them to vote for someone else.

553
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,500
 I'll tell them I'm voting for Aldo.

554
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:53,300
 Okay.

555
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,740
 That ensures 31 votes.

556
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:58,540
 We just need to secure the majority.

557
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,710
 The Pope's turtles.

558
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,240
 He loved them very much.

559
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,310
 They're from Angola.

560
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,180
 I thought I was imagining them.

561
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,780
 I love them, they're very intelligent.

562
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,220
 Here they keep escaping and getting run over.

563
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,660
 We need to return, curfew begins in the evening.

564
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,760
 And your health, how are you?

565
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,460
 My health is in excellent condition. Thank you.

566
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,230
 I mean, have you recovered from your journey?

567
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,430
 - Yes. - Good.

568
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:03,200
 And in the Sistine Chapel, did you find someone to vote for?

569
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,510
 Yes. I voted for you.

570
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:08,410
 Forgive me. Wasn't I supposed to say?

571
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,480
 No, it's not that...

572
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:13,250
 No, it's an honor for me, but dear Vincent...

573
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,320
 May I call you Vincent?

574
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:18,250
 I'm not a serious candidate.

575
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:20,660
 My mission lies...

576
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:26,330
 After the conference, I hope to resign from my position as dean

577
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,730
 and then leave Rome permanently.

578
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:30,400
 Why?

579
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,640
 I've faced difficulties.

580
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,240
 Regarding your faith?

581
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,280
 Prayer.

582
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,350
 I only mentioned it to clarify

583
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:53,450
 my point that I am in no way qualified to be Pope.

584
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:56,690
 Come.

585
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,770
 Aldo.

586
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:14,680
 Aldo?

587
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:20,980
 I regret that my meager tally

588
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,450
 of votes may have come at your expense.

589
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:29,360
 I didn't know you were so ambitious.

590
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:31,660
 That's a ridiculous thing to say.

591
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,950
 Really?

592
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,500
 Really?

593
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,730
 I thought we had your support.

594
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:42,970
 If we liberals don't unite, Tedesco will become Pope.

595
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:44,970
 You have no idea how bad the situation is, Thomas.

596
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:48,340
 The way he and his followers attacked the Pope recently.

597
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,510
 The defamation, the leaks to the press.

598
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:51,650
 It was brutal.

599
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,950
 He fought him every day of his papacy.

600
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,350
 And now that he's dead,

601
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:00,620
 he wants to destroy the work he spent his life building.

602
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,890
 If Tedesco becomes Pope,

603
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:06,250
 it will roll back 60 years of progress.

604
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,390
 You're speaking as if you're the only alternative.

605
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,730
 - Well... - But Adeyemi has strong support.

606
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,470
 Adeyemi? Adeyemi?

607
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:17,370
 The man who believes gays should be sent to prison in this world and hell in the next?

608
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:21,040
 Adeyemi is not the solution, and you know it.

609
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,480
 If you want to defeat Tedesco...

610
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,610
 Defeat? This is a conference, Aldo.

611
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:27,580
 - It's not a war. - It is a war!

612
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,450
 And you must choose a side!

613
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,660
 Keep your precious doubts to your prayers.

614
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:45,770
 You can't truly believe that I have any desire to become Pope.

615
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,570
 For heaven's sake!

616
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,670
 Every cardinal has that desire.

617
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,810
 Every cardinal, deep down, has chosen the name

618
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,040
 by which they want their papacy to be known.

619
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,540
 Well, I haven’t chosen.

620
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,910
 Deny it if you want.

621
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:02,680
 But search your heart, and then tell me you haven't chosen.

622
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:55,180
 "The second day of the conclave"

623
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:07,890
 The results of the second ballot are...

624
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:12,340
 Cardinal Adeyemi, 34 votes.

625
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,490
 Cardinal Tedesco, 25 votes.

626
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,220
 Cardinal Bellini, 18 votes.

627
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:26,020
 Cardinal Tremblay, 16 votes.

628
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:31,010
 Cardinal Lawrence, 9 votes.

629
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,260
 Cardinal Benitez, 2 votes.

630
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:46,980
 Brothers, according to the Apostolic Constitution,

631
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:51,020
 we shall immediately proceed to the next vote.

632
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,240
 Thank you.

633
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:03,940
 The results of the third ballot are...

634
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,270
 Cardinal Adeyemi, 52 votes.

635
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,520
 Cardinal Tedesco, 30 votes.

636
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,780
 Cardinal Tremblay, 10 votes.

637
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,580
 Cardinal Bellini...

638
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,670
 Brothers.

639
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,070
 Please.

640
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:36,100
 Thank you.

641
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:42,050
 Cardinal Bellini, 9 votes.

642
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,770
 Cardinal Lawrence, 5 votes.

643
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:49,560
 Cardinal Benitez, 4 votes.

644
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,770
 I believe something has happened.

645
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,770
 There was an explosion, Your Eminence, in Piazza Barberini.

646
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,310
 - A bomb? - The details are unclear at the moment.

647
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,670
 There are injuries.

648
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:18,980
 But no word of fatalities.

649
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,840
 We must not inform the cardinal electors about this, Ray.

650
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,310
 We are secluded, and they must be protected.

00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:02,920
‫سندينه جميعًا باعتباره
‫أكثر رجعية من "تيديسكو".

660
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:06,060
‫- فقط لأنه ليس أبيضًا...
‫- لقد فات الأوان لذلك.

661
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:08,090
‫لقد فات الأوان.

662
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:18,130
‫ماذا حدث؟

663
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,820
‫مساء الخير آختاه.

664
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,190
‫أريد التحدث مع الراهبة

665
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,660
‫- التي أسقطت صينيتها للتو.
‫- إنها بأمان معي.

666
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:44,130
‫أنا أتعامل مع الوضع أيها العميد.

667
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,660
‫أنا متأكد من ذلك يا أخت "أغنيس"،
‫لكن عليّ رؤيتها بنفسي.

668
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:51,130
‫من غير المحتمل أن يشكل
‫سقوط صينية قلق الكرادلة.

669
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:52,740
‫مع ذلك، أنا...

670
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:55,400
‫رعاية الأخت هي مسؤوليتي.

671
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,040
‫وهذا المجمع ملكي.

672
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:11,190
‫اجلسي رجاءً يا ابنتي.

673
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,460
‫اسمي الكاردينال "لورانس".

674
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:19,200
‫- كيف تشعرين؟
‫- إنها تشعر بتحسن.

675
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:20,960
‫هل يمكنكِ أن تخبريني باسمكِ؟

676
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,930
‫"شانومي". اسمها "شانومي".

677
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:24,930
‫اجلسي رجاءً.

678
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:28,170
‫أعتقد حقًا أنه سيكون من الأفضل
‫لو جعلتني التعامل مع الموقف...

679
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,240
‫هل يمكنكِ أن تتركينا الآن
‫أيتها الأخت "أغنيس"؟

680
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:56,500
‫أيتها الأخت "شانومي"،

681
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,430
‫أريدكِ أن تعرفي أولاً

682
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:01,200
‫أنّكِ لستِ في مشكلة.

683
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:08,340
‫الحقيقة هي أن لدي مسؤولية أمام الرب
‫لضمان أن القرارات التي نتخذها هنا

684
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:11,110
‫هي المناسبة.

685
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:14,790
‫الآن، من المهم أن تخبريني
‫بأي شيء في أعماق قلبكِ

686
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,120
‫أو أن هناك ما يقلقكِ،

687
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:20,220
‫فيما يتعلق بالكاردينال "أدييمي".

688
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,330
‫هل يمكنكِ فعل ذلك لأجلي؟

689
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:33,040
‫حتى لو أعطيتكِ تأكيداتي أن كلامنا
‫سيبقى محصورًا في هذه الغرفة فقط؟

690
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,150
‫هل تريدين مني أن أسمع اعترافكِ؟

691
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,030
‫سأكون جاهزًا بعد قليل أيها العميد.

692
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:09,500
ترجمة
"محمود بشار"

693
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:33,900
‫- ألا ينبغي لنا الرحيل؟
‫- بعد قليل.

694
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:35,930
‫يبدو أن ذلك يبعث على القلق.

695
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:44,980
‫إذا كان الأمر يتعلق بالحادث في الطابق الأسفل،
‫فليس لدي الرغبة في التحدث بالأمر.

696
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:52,250
‫أنا ضحية مؤامرة مخزية لتدمير سمعتي.

697
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:56,120
‫جلب أحدهم تلك المرأة إلى هنا
‫وأعد هذه الدراما المفتعلة.

698
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,620
‫لم تغادر "نيجيريا" قبلاً،

699
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:59,960
‫وفجأةً هي هنا في كنيسة "سانتا مارتا"...

700
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:02,860
‫مع كامل الإحترام يا "جوشوا"،
‫كيف أتت إلى هنا هو أمر ثانوي

701
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:05,030
‫إلى مسألة علاقتك بها.

702
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,330
‫لا أملك علاقة بها!

703
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,640
‫لم أراها منذ 30 عامًا

704
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:15,340
‫حتى أتت إلى غرفتي الليلة الماضية!

705
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,250
‫لقد كان خطاءً غير مقصود أيها العميد.

706
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:25,210
‫خطاءً غير مقصود.

707
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,550
‫"فليمنحنا الرب بابا يخطئ

708
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:31,050
‫ويطلب المغفرة ويستمر في المضي قدماً"

709
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:33,060
‫- هذا كلامك.
‫- والطفل؟

710
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,420
‫الطفل؟

711
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:46,400
‫نشأ الطفل في أسرة مسيحية.

712
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,040
‫وإلى يومنا هذا، ليس لديه أيّ فكرة
‫عن من هو والده.

713
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:51,640
‫إذا كان أنا حقًا.

714
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,380
‫هذا هو الطفل.

715
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,050
‫لقد كنا صغارًا.

716
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,650
‫لا يا "جوشوا".

717
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,080
‫كانت صغيرة جدًا،
‫كان عمرها 19 عامًا.

718
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,590
‫- لقد كان عمرك 30.
‫- "توماس".

719
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,020
‫"توماس".

720
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,390
‫إستمع ليّ. أرجوك.

721
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,160
‫لقد شعرت بحضور
‫الروح القدس هذا الصباح،

722
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,060
‫أقسم بذلك.

723
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:18,170
‫أنا مستعد لتحمل هذا العبء.

724
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,200
‫هل خطأ واحد منذ 30 عام

725
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,040
‫يجعلني غير مؤهل؟

726
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,280
‫أرجوك با "توماس".
‫لقد كنت رجلاً مختلفًا.

727
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:32,250
‫أتوسل إليك ألا تستخدم
‫هذه المعلومة لتدميرني.

728
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,420
‫"جوشوا"، هذه الفكرة لا تليق بك.

729
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:37,990
‫"شانومي" لن تتفوه بحرف
‫حتى تحمي ابنها.

730
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:41,090
‫وأنا مقيد بنذور سر الاعتراف.

731
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:45,630
‫إذن لا يزال ليّ أمل.

732
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,230
‫لا.

733
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:53,200
‫لا يوجد أمل.

734
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,640
‫بعد هذا التصرف أمام العامة،
‫ستكون هناك شائعات،

735
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:58,270
‫وأنت تعرف طبيعة مجلس الكهنة.

736
01:03:58,310 --> 01:04:04,350
‫لا شيء يرعب زملاءنا أكثر من فكرة
‫المزيد من الفضائح الجنسية.

737
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,550
‫أنا آسف للغاية.

738
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:13,060
‫لن تصبح بابا أبدًا.

739
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:19,160
‫عليك أن تبدأ من جديد.

740
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:23,730
‫ولكنك رجل صالح.

741
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,140
‫أعرف أنّك رجل صالح،

742
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:30,540
‫وستجد طريقة للتكفير عن ذنبك.

743
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:54,300
‫هلا تصلي معي؟

744
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:58,400
‫نعم بالطبع.

745
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:18,990
‫نتائج الاقتراع الخامس هي...

746
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:23,040
‫الكاردينال "تريمبلاي"، 40 صوتًا.

747
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:27,420
‫الكاردينال "تيديسكو"، 34 صوتًا.

748
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:32,010
‫الكاردينال "بيليني"، 30 صوت.

749
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:36,510
‫الكاردينال "لورانس"، 11 صوتًا.

750
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:41,440
‫الكاردينال "أديمي"، 9 أصوات.

751
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,430
‫الكاردينال "بينيتيز"، 6 أصوات.

752
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:49,810
‫أخوتي...

753
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,170
‫إخوتي، بهذا ننتهي
‫من الجولة الخامسة من التصويت.

754
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,460
‫لم يحصل أيّ مرشح
‫على الأغلبية اللازمة

755
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:00,620
‫سنستأنف التصويت غدًا صباحًا.

756
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:17,070
‫نعم يا "راي"؟

757
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:19,910
‫الحادثة التي وقعت
‫صباح اليوم يا سماحتك.

758
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:21,710
‫لدي المزيد من المعلومات إذا...

759
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:24,850
‫لا، يجب أن أكون محميًا أيضًا
‫من أي معرفة

760
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,450
‫قد تؤثر على سير الاجتماع السري.

761
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:30,550
‫بالطبع يا سماحتك.

762
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:33,090
‫هل هناك شيء آخر؟

763
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,460
‫الكاردينال "بينيتيز".

764
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:36,830
‫مشاكله الصحية.

765
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,800
‫تم تزويده بتذكرة
‫ذهاب وعودة إلى "جنيف"،

766
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:42,600
‫مدفوعة من حساب البابا الخاص.

767
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:44,740
‫لقد تحققت من طلب التأشيرة خاصته.

768
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:47,970
‫وكان الغرض من السفر
‫هو "العلاج الطبي".

769
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:51,840
‫على أية حال، مهما كان سبب السفر،
‫فلا بد أنه كان سببًا مهمًا.

770
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,510
‫لقد تم إلغاء التذكرة
‫ولم يذهب أبدًا.

771
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:55,910
‫حسناً، شكراً لك.

772
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,890
‫سامحني يا سماحتك.

773
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,490
‫أعلم أّنك قلت أن علينا
‫نسيان أمر

774
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:12,030
‫- التقرير المسحوب.
‫- نعم.

775
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:13,970
‫ولكنني تساءلت،

776
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,500
‫في ضوء موقف الكاردينال
‫"تريمبلاي" الحالي...

777
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:21,770
‫يمكنني أن أحاول اكتشاف
‫إذا كان بإمكاني معرفة...

778
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:23,510
‫لا، لستُ باحثًا عن السحرة.

779
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:27,910
‫عملي ليس البحث
‫عن أسرار زملائي القديمة.

780
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:34,690
‫سامحني.

781
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:37,590
 Please stop the investigations.

782
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:38,960
 I...

783
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:42,530
 I believe we've heard enough secrets.

784
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,940
 Let's leave the rest to God.

785
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:51,570
 Yes, of course.

786
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,700
 Good night, Your Eminence.

787
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,590
 Is this really necessary?

788
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:21,230
 I feel like I'm in an American political convention.

789
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:23,670
 It won't take long.

790
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:27,810
 Our friend here doesn't have enough support among our colleagues to be elected Pope.

791
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,640
 The voting isn't over yet.

792
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:32,680
 I'm afraid it's over for me.

793
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:36,210
 And now the question arises:

794
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,720
 If I can't win,

795
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:42,750
 who do I advise my supporters to vote for?

796
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,560
 "Thomas," I'm not more enthusiastic about "Tremblay" than you are.

797
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:49,760
 But we have to face the reality...

798
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:51,700
 We have to face the reality that he has shown broad popularity.

799
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:10,710
 - He might be the one to unite us. - No, no.

800
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:14,750
 - He might be the person who unites us. 
 - No, no.  

801
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:17,160
 - What? - Is this what we've come to?

802
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:20,760
 Considering the least bad option?

803
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:22,930
 But the choices have become few.

804
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,730
 If we don't change our vote, we'll be here for weeks.

805
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,770
 And that's exactly what "Tedesco" wants.

806
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,770
 We once had a Pope who was a member of "Hitler Youth" and fought for the Nazis.

807
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,570
 We've accused Popes of colluding with communists and fascists.

808
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:39,580
 We've had Popes who overlooked reports of child sexual abuse!

809
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,750
 Okay.

810
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:43,920
 We get your point.

811
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:46,990
 The point is we'll never find a candidate without a dark past.

812
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:50,190
 We are mortal men.

813
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:52,220
 We serve an ideal principle.

814
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,590
 We can't always be perfect.

815
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:57,060
 So we've agreed.

816
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,040
 We'll urge all our supporters to support "Tremblay."

817
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:08,970
 Good.

818
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:12,140
 Last night, you were kind enough

819
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:22,250
 to say that you voted for me.

820
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:25,120
 I don't know if you continued to do so,

821
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,260
 but if you are still doing so, I must repeat my plea to you to stop.

822
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:32,200
 Why?

823
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,970
 First, I lack the spiritual depth to be Pope.

824
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,400
 Second, I can't win.

825
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,770
 The media will consider the lengthy conclave

826
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:44,880
 as evidence that the Church is in crisis.

827
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:47,910
 Did you come to ask me to vote for Cardinal "Tremblay"?

828
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:50,180
 Yes, I did, and urge your supporters to do the same.

829
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:53,850
 Cardinal "Tremblay" spoke to me about this.

830
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:55,790
 I'm sure he did.

831
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,990
 Do you want me to vote for a man you see as ambitious?

832
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:01,190
 I don't want "Tedesco" to be Pope.

833
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:06,130
 He will take our Church back to an earlier era.

834
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:09,830
 I'm sorry, but I can't vote for a man

835
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:12,040
 unless I consider him the most worthy of the papacy.

836
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:15,270
 And for me, that man isn't "Tremblay."

837
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:18,410
 It's you.

838
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,780
 I don't want your vote!

839
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:22,410
 And yet, you will have it.

840
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:25,950
 Sister "Shanome" is on her way to Nigeria.

841
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:02,190
 There was a flight to Lagos this evening,

842
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:05,020
 and I thought it best for everyone if she was on it.

843
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:08,730
 How did Sister "Shanome" come to Rome?

844
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:12,330
 I received notice from the Superior General's office

845
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:16,200
 that she would be joining us.

846
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:18,400
 The arrangement was made in Paris.

847
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,810
 You should ask "Buck," Your Eminence.

848
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,370
 I would have done so, of course,

849
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:23,940
 but I've been isolated during the secret meeting.

850
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:27,050
 So you should ask them after the meeting ends.

851
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,250
 This information is valuable to me now.

852
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:34,120
 Sister "Agnes," I know you were close to the Pope.

853
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:42,360
 When I tried to resign as Dean, he wouldn't allow it.

854
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:46,000
 I didn't understand why at the time, but now I think I do.

855
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:51,940
 I think the Pope knew he was dying,

856
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:55,810
 and for some reason, he wanted me to manage this secret meeting.

857
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,980
 That's what I'm trying to do.

858
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:03,950
 For him.

859
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:07,950
 I want you to withdraw your name from the next vote.

860
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:09,210
 You're not the right man to be Pope.

861
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:13,280
 40 of our colleagues might disagree with you on that.

862
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,620
 That's because they don't know you as I do.

863
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:19,220
 That's sad, "Thomas."

864
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,630
 I'll pray for you.

865
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:25,360
 I know there's a report about your activities.

866
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,370
 I know the Pope discussed it with you hours before his death

867
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,100
 and that he expelled you from all your positions,

868
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:34,010
 and I know you somehow discovered

869
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,070
 "Ademi's" succumbing to temptation 30 years ago

870
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:39,080
 and that you orchestrated bringing the woman in question to Rome for a specific purpose

871
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:43,350
 to destroy "Ademi's" chances of becoming Pope.

872
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:46,580
 I deny this accusation.

873
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,020
 Do you deny asking the abbess to transfer a sister to Rome?

874
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:52,420
 No, I asked her.

875
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:54,490
 - But not on my behalf. - Well, on whose behalf then?

876
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:57,030
 The Pope.

877
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,430
 Will you falsely accuse the Pope in his own house?

878
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:00,970
 It's not slander.

879
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,970
 It's the truth.

880
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,670
 The Pope gave me a sister's name

881
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:07,110
 and asked me to make a special request to bring her to Rome.

882
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:10,980
 I had no idea why, and now I've chosen...

883
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:15,280
 You must be careful, "Thomas."

884
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:21,050
 Your ambition hasn't gone unnoticed.

885
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:26,420
 This could be seen as a tactic to smear the name of a competitor.

886
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:30,930
 Well, that's a vile accusation.

887
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,530
 Is it?

888
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,570
 I wonder...

889
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,030
 if you're really hesitant

890
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:40,510
 to see the papacy handed to you.

891
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:43,370
 I'll pretend this conversation never happened.

892
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:52,050
 But it did happen!

893
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:58,820
 This is a report on "Tremblay's" activities.

894
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:14,100
 The case appears at first glance

895
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:16,540
 to be conclusive evidence of his committing the crime of simony, which is, of course,

896
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:18,370
 a crime specified in the Bible...

897
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,240
 I know what simony is. Thank you.

898
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:22,310
 He got all those votes in the first ballot because he bought them.

899
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:26,180
 "Cardenas," "Dieni," "Figarella," "Baptist."

900
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:30,250
 And all this happened in the last 12 months

901
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,180
 when he must have realized the Pope would soon die.

902
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:36,190
 How can we be sure this money wasn't used for entirely legal purposes?

903
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:40,190
 Because I haven't seen any bank statements.

904
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:43,090
 My God.

905
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:45,230
 It seems the Pope was watching us all.

906
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:48,970
 He trusted no one.

907
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:52,140
 Where did you get this?

908
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:55,240
 I broke the seals.

909
01:23:55,970 --> 01:23:57,880
 I felt I had no choice.

910
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:59,240
 I felt like I didn't have a choice.

911
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:05,080
I suspected Tremblay of having brought that poor woman from Africa to embarrass Adeyemi.

912
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,520
You have to keep running, Aldo.

913
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:15,060
Put them back where they belong.

914
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:17,030
Put them back where they belong.

915
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:18,960
Or burn them or...

916
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,200
Just put them back where they belong.

917
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:23,400
There is no way I could become a pope under these circumstances.

918
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:26,070
Document theft and defamation 
 One of the Cardinal&#39;s brothers?

919
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,240
I&#39;d be the Richard Nixon of popes.

920
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:30,110
So leave this to me.

921
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:32,080
I am ready to bear the consequences.

922
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:34,550
Do you know who will benefit the most?

923
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:36,580
&quot;Tedesco&quot;.

924
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:41,350
The essence of his candidacy is that the Pope has brought the Church to disaster.

925
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:43,660
With his reform attempts.

926
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:46,220
If you disclose this report,

927
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:48,960
Tremblay&#39;s reputation will not be affected.

928
01:24:48,990 --> 01:24:51,160
But the reputation of the church.

929
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,300
The Council of Priests is accused of institutional corruption.

930
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:58,700
I thought we were here to serve the Lord, not the priesthood.

931
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:00,510
Don&#39;t be naive.

932
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,210
Put them back where they belong.

933
01:25:09,150 --> 01:25:11,420
And &quot;Tremblay&quot; is the Pope?

934
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:13,180
We&#39;ve had worse people.

935
01:25:18,190 --> 01:25:20,090
What did he offer you?

936
01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:23,500
Minister of State?

937
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:33,310
I voted for you 5 times, Aldo.

938
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:36,610
But I was wrong.

939
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:40,410
You lack the courage to be a pope.

940
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,810
&quot;The third day of the secret meeting&quot;

941
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:56,570
mistake&quot;

942
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,670
I will do it for you, Your Eminence.

943
01:26:06,810 --> 01:26:09,480
How many copies do you want?

944
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:11,340
‫108.

945
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:33,130
You are responsible for this I think.

946
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,270
No, Your Eminence. You are the one responsible.

947
01:26:36,670 --> 01:26:40,410
This report is a lie!

948
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:43,480
It would never have come out into the open if it hadn&#39;t been for

949
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:46,410
She breaks into the Pope&#39;s apartment to take him away!

950
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:49,380
If the report is false, why did the Pope do it?

951
01:26:49,410 --> 01:26:52,750
In his last official act as Pope, he asked you to resign?

952
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,520
He didn&#39;t do this.

953
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:56,620
As Bishop Morales, who was present at the meeting, said...

954
01:26:56,660 --> 01:27:00,360
However, Archbishop Wozniak insists that the Pope...

955
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:03,730
May the Pope be honored among the chief priests,

956
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,400
He was a sick man at the end of his life,

957
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:11,700
As those of us who have seen him
regularly can attest.

958
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:15,900
If you would allow me to join this friendly conversation.

959
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:17,550
I want to remind you

960
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,790
The names of eight cardinals have been withheld.

961
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:23,320
Their names have been removed!

962
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:25,250
I think the dean
can tell us their names?

963
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:26,960
To tell us who they are

964
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:30,400
Here and now.

965
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:33,260
If Cardinal Tremblay asks for their votes

966
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:35,160
In exchange for money...

967
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:36,130
No, I wouldn&#39;t do that.

968
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:41,170
Let every man examine his conscience as I did.

969
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,200
I have no intention of creating tension
in this meeting.

970
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:49,510
I would be happy to step down as Dean.

971
01:27:53,450 --> 01:27:56,750
Do you see? Do you see?

972
01:27:57,350 --> 01:28:01,650
Your Eminence!

973
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:05,520
Your Eminence.

974
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:08,890
Even though we sisters are supposed to be invisible,

975
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:12,800
Yet the Lord has given us eyes and ears.

976
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:18,370
I know what prompted the dean to enter the Pope&#39;s room.

977
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:24,280
He was worried that my sister-in-law had caused that unfortunate incident.

978
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:28,810
It may have been brought to Rome on purpose.

979
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:31,620
To embarrass any member of this meeting.

980
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:35,650
His suspicions were correct.

981
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:38,790
She actually came here
On specific request

982
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:41,530
From Cardinal Tremblay.

983
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:02,210
My brothers,

984
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,350
This is correct.

985
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:07,620
But the Pope asked me to.

986
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:12,820
I didn&#39;t know who this woman was,

987
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:14,560
I swear to you.

988
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:20,210
Judah&quot;.

989
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,900
traitor

990
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:55,200
It seems we have no supporters left.

991
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:02,880
You have to take charge of supervising this election, Aldo.

992
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:06,110
No thank you.

993
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:09,780
You will lead this meeting.

994
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:14,020
Where exactly, I don&#39;t know.

995
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:17,190
But it seems your strictness has its admirers.

996
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,830
&quot;Thomas,&quot; I came to ask your forgiveness.

997
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:33,010
I had the audacity

998
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:36,880
To tell you to check your heart,

999
01:30:36,910 --> 01:30:39,910
When all the time,
was...

1000
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:47,050
It&#39;s a shame.

1001
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:52,220
To be at this age
and not know yourself yet.

1002
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:55,860
Ambition is the moth of holiness.

1003
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:00,970
I&#39;m sorry.

1004
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:09,940
Maybe it&#39;s time to come up with a name.

1005
01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:14,480
As the oldest member of this forum,

1006
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:18,250
I have to ask you
how you would like to be known as Papa.

1007
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:22,020
For or against us,

1008
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:24,860
It seems that the &quot;Tremblay&quot; thing is over.

1009
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:28,130
This is a contest between you and Tedesco.

1010
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:31,300
You&#39;re the only one who can stop him now.

1011
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:40,270
June&quot;.

1012
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:44,010
I will choose the name &quot;John&quot;.

1013
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,340
&quot;The Pope chose&quot;

1014
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:23,100
Everyone was taken to the house of Saint Martha, Your Eminence.

1015
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:26,470
No one was seriously hurt, just a few cuts.

1016
01:34:27,170 --> 01:34:29,480
Outside the city, how bad is it?

1017
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:45,090
Oh, my God.

1018
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:52,000
At 11:20 am today,

1019
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:56,270
A car bomb exploded in Al-Nahda Square.

1020
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:59,940
Shortly after, as people were fleeing the scene,

1021
01:34:59,970 --> 01:35:03,080
Individual carrying explosives on his body

1022
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:05,080
He blew himself up.

1023
01:35:05,110 --> 01:35:10,050
There are reports of further attacks in both Leuven and Munich.

1024
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,390
The current death toll is...

1025
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:14,550
52 dead.

1026
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:18,320
Hundreds were injured.

1027
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:19,620
Okay then.

1028
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:24,480
Here at last we see the result of the doctrine of relativity.

1029
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:27,990
Which our liberal brothers love!

1030
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:34,470
Relativism sees all religions and temporary beliefs

1031
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:36,840
Treated the same.

1032
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:38,730
Even now when we look around

1033
01:35:38,860 --> 01:35:41,360
We see the land of the Holy Roman Catholic Church

1034
01:35:41,610 --> 01:35:44,570
It is full of mosques and minarets.

1035
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:46,000
To Prophet &quot;Muhammad&quot;!

1036
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,020
- You should be ashamed.
- Ashamed?

1037
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:50,360
- You should be ashamed.
- We should all be ashamed!

1038
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:54,130
We tolerate Islam in our land,

1039
01:35:54,270 --> 01:35:55,850
But they curse us in themselves.

1040
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:59,380
We feed them in our homelands.

1041
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,670
‫لكنهم يبيدوننا.

1042
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:04,700
‫إلى متى سنستمر في هذا الضعف؟

1043
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:07,400
‫هم حرفيًا على أبوابنا الآن.

1044
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:10,750
‫ما نحتاجه الآن هو قائد يفهم

1045
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:14,750
‫أننا نواجه حربًا دينية

1046
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:16,410
‫لا تلمسني!

1047
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,990
‫نعم، حرب دينية.

1048
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:23,050
‫نحن بحاجة إلى قائد
‫يضع حداً للانجراف

1049
01:36:23,170 --> 01:36:25,900
‫الذي استمر بلا انقطاع تقريبًا
‫على مدى السنوات الخمسين الماضية.

1050
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,080
‫إلى متى سنستمر في هذا الضعف،

1051
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:29,280
‫إلى متى؟

1052
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,400
‫نحن بحاجة إلى قائد...

1053
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:34,670
‫يقاتل هؤلاء الحيوانات!

1054
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:42,510
‫هل هذا هو الرجل
‫الذي تريدون أن يقودنا؟

1055
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:45,140
‫أخي الكاردينال.

1056
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:48,550
‫أخي الكاردينال.

1057
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:57,190
‫مع كامل الاحترام...

1058
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:01,290
‫ماذا تعرف عن الحرب؟

1059
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:07,070
‫لقد خدمت وزارتي في "الكونغو".

1060
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:09,300
‫في "بغداد" و"كابول".

1061
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,740
‫رأيت صفوف القتلى والجرحى،

1062
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:16,310
‫مسيحيون ومسلمون.

1063
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:22,410
‫عندما تقول علينا أن نقاتل،

1064
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:24,650
‫ما الذي تعتقد أن علينا مقاتلته؟

1065
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:31,160
‫هل تظن أن هؤلاء الرجال الضالين
‫هم من نفذوا هذه الأعمال الرهيبة اليوم؟

1066
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:33,330
‫لا يا أخي.

1067
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:35,550
‫المسألة أنّك تقاتل بقلبك...

1068
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:39,290
‫بداخلنا جميعًا،

1069
01:37:39,550 --> 01:37:42,050
‫إذا استسلمنا إلى الكره الآن،

1070
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:45,370
‫إذا تحدثنا من "الجانبين"

1071
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:48,410
‫بدلاً من التحدث نيابةً
‫عن كل رجل وامرأة.

1072
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:52,940
‫هذه هي المرة الأولى ليّ هنا بينكم،

1073
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,540
‫وأعتقد أنها الأخيرة.

1074
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:03,070
‫سامحوني، ولكن في الأيام القليلة الماضية
‫أظهرنا أنفسنا وكأننا رجال صغار تافهون،

1075
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:07,470
‫لقد بدأ أننا مهتمون فقط بأنفسنا،

1076
01:38:08,530 --> 01:38:09,880
‫بـ "روما"،

1077
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:12,570
‫بهذه الانتخابات والسلطة.

1078
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:16,680
‫لكن هذه الأمور لا تمثل الكنيسة.

1079
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:20,320
‫الكنيسة ليست تقليد.

1080
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:23,100
‫الكنيسة ليست الماضي.

1081
01:38:25,210 --> 01:38:27,940
‫الكنيسة هي ما سنفعله بعد ذلك.

1082
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:03,070
‫نحن نصلي،

1083
01:40:03,150 --> 01:40:07,490
‫أبانا حتى ترشدنا

1084
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:10,960
‫واحرس كنيستك

1085
01:40:11,030 --> 01:40:12,840
‫امنحنا، نحن خدمك

1086
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:16,780
‫نعمة العقل والحق والسلام.

1087
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:21,450
‫لكي نجتهد في معرفة مشيئتك،

1088
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:25,460
‫ونخدمك بكل تفانٍ.

1089
01:40:28,270 --> 01:40:30,310
‫لأجل "المسيح" ربنا.

1090
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:31,940
‫آمين.

1091
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:56,220
‫"بيليني".

1092
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:07,730
‫"بينيتيز".

1093
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:14,040
‫"لورانس".

1094
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:18,110
‫"تيديسكو".

1095
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:22,120
‫"لورانس".

1096
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:26,360
‫هل تقبل انتخابك الكنسي لمنصب البابا؟

1097
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:40,680
‫هل تقبل انتخابك الكنسي لمنصب البابا؟

1098
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:49,470
‫نعم.

1099
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:54,670
‫وبأي اسم تريد أن تُلقب به؟

1100
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:00,940
‫"البريء".

1101
01:44:26,990 --> 01:44:29,490
‫"الانتخابات البابوية العليا"

1102
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:35,910
‫سيادة المطران.

1103
01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:38,290
‫اعتذر على المقاطعة.

1104
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:40,990
‫"راي".

1105
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:45,030
‫أعتقد أنه يجب عليك جمع
‫ملاحظات الكرادلة.

1106
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:46,430
‫كلما بدأنا في وقت أقرب،

1107
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:49,900
‫كلما عرف العالم
‫أن لدينا بابا جديداً.

1108
01:44:51,930 --> 01:44:53,400
‫ما الأمر؟

1109
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:56,940
‫لم تكن...

1110
01:44:56,970 --> 01:44:58,970
‫لم تكن النتيجة التي توقعتها.

1111
01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:01,210
‫لا، لكنها رائع على أية حال.

1112
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,280
‫إذا كنت قلقًا بشأن موقفي،

1113
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:08,050
‫يمكنني أن أطمئنك
‫أنّني لا أشعر سوى بالارتياح.

1114
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:12,350
‫بابانا الجديد سيكون افضّل مني بمراحل.

1115
01:45:18,090 --> 01:45:21,230
‫أتساءل عما إذا كان بإمكاني
‫التحدث معك على انفراد.

1116
01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:25,930
‫كان ينبغي ليّ أن أخبرك
‫هذا الصباح عندما اكتشفت ذلك،

1117
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:28,200
‫ولكن مع كل...

1118
01:45:28,230 --> 01:45:30,170
‫ولم احلم

1119
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:32,170
‫أن الكاردينال "بينيتيز" سيصبح...

1120
01:45:32,210 --> 01:45:35,140
‫"راي"، أخبرني ماذا يقلقك.

1121
01:45:37,610 --> 01:45:39,550
‫لقد اكتشفت...

1122
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:41,480
‫"سويسرا".

1123
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:43,650
‫رحلة الكاردينال "بينيتيز" إلى "سويسرا".

1124
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:47,420
‫"سويسرا". المستشفى في "جنيف"، صحيح؟

1125
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:50,890
‫لم يكن مستشفى.

1126
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:53,060
‫لقد كانت عيادة.

1127
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:57,230
‫عيادة لماذا؟

1128
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:12,200
‫سماحتك، لن يلبس قداسته الرداء.

1129
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:13,650
‫مسموح ليّ.

1130
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:22,190
‫- هل يمكنني تلتحدث معك على انفراد؟
‫- بالطبع.

1131
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:23,790
‫يا سادة، لنخرج من الغرفة.

1132
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,330
‫كنت أنتظر مجيئك.

1133
01:46:33,370 --> 01:46:35,540
‫عليك أن تخبرني عن هذا العلاج

1134
01:46:35,570 --> 01:46:37,500
‫في العيادة في "جنيف".

1135
01:46:38,510 --> 01:46:40,610
‫- هل عليّ ذلك أيها العميد؟
‫- نعم، عليك ذلك.

1136
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:43,680
‫في غضون ساعة، سوف تصبح
‫الرجل الأكثر شهرة في العالم،

1137
01:46:43,710 --> 01:46:45,650
‫لذا أخبرني رجاءً.

1138
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:48,520
‫ما هي حالتك الطبية؟

1139
01:46:50,180 --> 01:46:53,190
‫حالتي، كما قلت،

1140
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:56,490
‫إنها نفسها ما كانت عليه
‫عندما تم تعييني كاهنًا.

1141
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,690
‫وعندما أصبحت كاردينالاً.

1142
01:46:58,730 --> 01:47:00,630
‫ولكن العلاج في "جنيف"؟

1143
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:03,030
‫لم يكن هناك علاج.

1144
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:04,500
‫لقد فكرت في الأمر.

1145
01:47:04,530 --> 01:47:07,130
‫لقد دعوت الرب أن يهديني
‫وقررت عدم خوض العلاج.

1146
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:10,140
‫ولكن ما هو هذا العلاج؟

1147
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:16,110
‫اسمه استئصال الرحم باستخدام المنظار.

1148
01:48:02,420 --> 01:48:04,490
‫يتوجب عليك أن تفهم.

1149
01:48:06,130 --> 01:48:12,400
‫عندما كنت طفلاً، لم يكن هناك وسيلة
‫لمعرفة أن وضعي كان أكثر تعقيدًا.

1150
01:48:13,270 --> 01:48:18,510
‫والحياة في المدرسة الدينية،
‫كما تعلم، متواضعة للغاية.

1151
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:24,080
‫الحقيقة هي أنه لم يكن هناك
‫سبب للتفكير

1152
01:48:24,110 --> 01:48:27,210
‫أنّني كنت مختلفًا جسديًا
‫عن بقية الشباب الآخرين.

1153
01:48:28,150 --> 01:48:31,150
‫وفي أواخر الثلاثينيات من عمري،

1154
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:35,290
‫أجريت عملية جراحية
‫لإزالة الزائدة الدودية.

1155
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:39,590
‫وهنا اكتشف الأطباء

1156
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:41,730
‫أن لدي رحم.

1157
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,730
‫ومبايض.

1158
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:47,700
‫قد يقول البعض أن كروموسومياتي
‫هي التي ستحدد هويتي

1159
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:50,240
‫بأنّي امرأة.

1160
01:48:50,270 --> 01:48:54,340
‫ولكنني أيضًا كما تراني.

1161
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:07,550
‫لقد كان وقتًا مظلمًا ليّ.

1162
01:49:07,590 --> 01:49:10,120
‫شعرت وكأن حياتي كلها ككاهن

1163
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:13,130
‫عاش في حالة من الخطيئة.

1164
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:17,300
‫وبطبيعة الحال،
‫قدمت استقالتي للبابا.

1165
01:49:17,330 --> 01:49:20,230
‫سافرت إلى "روما" وأخبرته بكل شيء.

1166
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:23,640
‫هل كان يعلم؟

1167
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:27,410
‫نعم. كان يعلم.

1168
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:30,180
‫ورأى أنه من المقبول أن تستمر

1169
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:33,450
‫كوزير مُرسَم؟

1170
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:37,280
‫فكرنا في إجراء عملية جراحية
‫لإزالة الأجزاء الأنثوية من جسدي.

1171
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:39,820
‫ولكن في الليلة التي سبقت
‫موعد رحلتي،

1172
01:49:39,850 --> 01:49:43,190
‫أدركت أنّني كنت مخطئًا.

1173
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:45,630
‫كنت الشخص الذي كنت عليه دائمًا.

1174
01:49:47,730 --> 01:49:51,200
‫شعرت أن أكبر خطيئة
‫أن أغير خلق الرب

1175
01:49:51,230 --> 01:49:53,500
‫من أن أترك جسدي كما كان عليه.

1176
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:58,670
‫إذن أنت لا تزال...

1177
01:50:00,370 --> 01:50:03,180
‫أنا ما خلقني الرب عليه.

1178
01:50:03,810 --> 01:50:08,510
‫وربما يكون اختلافي
‫هو الذي سيجعلني أكثر فائدة.

1179
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:12,650
‫أفكر مجددًا في خطبتك.

1180
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:17,820
‫أدرك ما يعني أن أعيش

1181
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:20,160
‫بين تأكيدات العالم.

1182
01:51:20,160 --> 01:52:20,160
