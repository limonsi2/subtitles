00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:25,660
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:58,203
- [Toddrick] Man, my pops
told me life could get crazy,

5
00:00:58,203 --> 00:01:01,845
but who knew, this shit could go down.

6
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:04,302
In life you've got two
choices, left or right?

7
00:01:04,302 --> 00:01:06,567
Not in this goddamn new millennial world.

8
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,991
You can go inside, up,
down, to the corner,

9
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:12,090
lean, tilt, all types of shit.

10
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,886
And every move you make is
one you're going to pay for.

11
00:01:15,886 --> 00:01:18,900
I'm just trying to get the less bill.

12
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,698
This is how it all started.

13
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:24,241
This is me, Toddrick Franks, big toot.

14
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:26,440
Ladies call me Teddy Todd.

15
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,275
You know, life was good for a
small time hustler like myself

16
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:32,162
until I ran into Quanita's boyfriend

17
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:33,783
that just got out of prison.

18
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:35,435
He thinks I'm her new booty.

19
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:37,795
So he want to kill my ass.

20
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:39,253
Now I'm on the run.

21
00:01:39,253 --> 00:01:41,815
Broke, stanky socks, all that.

22
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:44,669

23
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,327

24
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:57,394
This is Quanita's boyfriend,

25
00:01:57,394 --> 00:02:02,394
Tyrone, ex convict, mentally
ill, ADHD headed motherfucker.

26
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:04,418

00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:15,223
- Yeah, I ain't got nowhere to go.

347
00:13:15,223 --> 00:13:18,327
- He's very violent at this
time, so if you scared.

348
00:13:18,327 --> 00:13:20,421
- I got a job too. I got
a job, just let her know.

349
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:21,254
- He don't got no job.

350
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:22,569
- I'm about to be with Amazon.

351
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,244
I'm about to be with Amazon.

352
00:13:25,244 --> 00:13:26,197
- [Toddrick] You ever place an order

353
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:27,808
at a Chinese restaurant,

354
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,677
but you can't understand them
and they can't understand you,

355
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:31,990
but you really want them God damn

356
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,531
golden-crispy-fried wontons.

357
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:37,519
So you walk into that bitch
and start pointing at stuff.

358
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,273
That's what happened to me
and landed me in the lap of

359
00:13:40,273 --> 00:13:43,356
this sexy, sexy, God damn angel, ohh.

360
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:46,300
Anyway.

361
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:48,675
She could get it.

362
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:51,591
She can get it all.

363
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:54,591
I know you don't want
to see what happened.

364
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:58,222
So I'm gonna just fast forward
to the part where I finished.

365
00:13:58,222 --> 00:13:59,055
Oh God.

366
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:01,838
Is this the part?

367
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:03,240
This is it.

368
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,659
Y'all see all that.

369
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:06,396
I left my jacket at your house,
I'm gonna need that, right?

370
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:09,397
- Oh y'all niggas leaving
clothes at each other's house.

371
00:14:09,397 --> 00:14:10,231
- No, no it wasn't even like that.

372
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:12,857
It's because look, my house,
my package went to her house

373
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:14,054
and my jacket went to the wrong address.

374
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,832
- I dont understand you, homie.

375
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:16,665
- Quanita I'll.

376
00:14:16,665 --> 00:14:17,741
- I don't understand you, homie.

377
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:18,574
- Hold on.

378
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:19,798
- Nigga, give me my
motherfuckin' phone back.

379
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:20,997
Hey, what's up Quanita what's up?

You know, I've been out here,

00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:24,254
I've been out here calling
you left and right.

382
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:29,254
And you ain't answering the
phone, none of that shit.

383
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:32,136
(dramatic music)

384
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:32,969
Hey homeboy, hey what you,

387
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:41,483
(dramatic music)

388
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:44,355
- I'm a good boy.

389
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:46,930
- I don't give a fuck about, you gunna do.

390
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,852
- My life.

391
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:51,019
(fast dramatic music)

392
00:14:57,315 --> 00:14:58,220
- You gunna do this
nigga, you gunna do this.

393
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,275
- That didn't work, it
works in the movies.

394
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,141
(metal clanking)

395
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:31,734
Why would I put that
down, that's just stupid.

396
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:34,085
Oh, this shit is happening to fast for me.

397
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:36,184
I got to plan this out. I've gotta think.

398
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:37,342
You gotta think.

399
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:40,642
I will drive, the fuck away from here,

400
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:42,547
'cause I cannot fight that nigga Tyrone,

401
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:45,965
and I don't want no business
with no God damn, Quanita.

402
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:48,069
Believe I let this bitch get
me into trouble like this.

403
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:51,695
I was just doin my shit,
now I'm down to a suitcase.

404
00:15:51,695 --> 00:15:54,112
With damn near nothin' in it.

405
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,356
Get the fuck out.

406
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,631
Might as well leave it like that though

407
00:15:57,631 --> 00:16:01,131
'cause the motherfucker ain't heavy, shit.

408
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:04,173
I need a sign.

409
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,006
Do I run?

410
00:16:05,844 --> 00:16:08,807
I mean do I leave, cause it
ain't runnin, I ain't no punk.

411
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:10,642
Shit going on. Okay.

412
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:13,198
I don't run from nobody, I'm
saying, but if you get close,

413
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:14,723
I gotta get the fuck away from you.

414
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,997
- Y'all good over there?

415
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:18,316
(laughing) Girl, you know
you need some aftershave.

416
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:20,701
You got all that over there,

417
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:22,137
Ooh.

418
00:16:22,137 --> 00:16:24,296

419
00:16:24,296 --> 00:16:25,456
his wife hired me,

420
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:28,214

421
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:30,081
you're going to have to
watch the God damn movie.

422
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:32,822
But look at him, funky
ass dreads on his head,

423
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:34,183
lookin like a prison mop.

424
00:16:34,183 --> 00:16:36,448
Looked like somebody just
peed on the top of his shit

425
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:37,853
and let her dry up in there.

426
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:40,453
Stanking ass, stank ass nigga.

427
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:43,368
- In the kitchen (fingers clicking)

428
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:44,814
- Fuck it, let's make it to this.

429
00:16:44,814 --> 00:16:46,314
To the car, we go.

430
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,971
Just gotta figure out this is.

431
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:53,176

Quanita gave me your number.

437

00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:24,079
- Kinda comfortable.
- And the train.

00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:27,907

00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:41,776
- What you doin catching a
bus? Thought you was a baller.

495
00:19:41,776 --> 00:19:43,588
- First of all, I don't
want to be followed.

496
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:46,295
And this is some serious shit
that we're talking about.

497
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:47,693
- You don't want to be followed,
but you took the bus here

498
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:48,894

499
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:49,975

00:19:49,975 --> 00:19:50,808

501
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:52,214
I'm pretty sure somebody knows who you at.

502
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:53,564
- No, nobody knows who okay.

503
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:55,694
I turned the GPS off my phone.

504
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,527
Now.

505
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:01,225
How are you doing today?

506
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,247
- I don't know.

507
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:06,942
- Look, I need you to get
rid of somebody for me.

508
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:08,548
- Okay, I can get rid of somebody,

509
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:10,480
I could definitely hold on to

510
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,614
- No. No thanks, all right.

511
00:20:12,614 --> 00:20:14,543
You need to get rid of my husband.

512
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:15,376
- Okay.

513
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:16,493
- So we can get his life insurance money.

514
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:18,434
- Like taking out the trash or something.

515
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:20,113
What'd he do to you? He beat you?

516
00:20:20,113 --> 00:20:21,749
What'd he do.

517
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:24,332
- He is the worst husband ever.

518
00:20:25,194 --> 00:20:28,123

00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:23,824
You won't drop him down?
With the whole smother thing.

You want me to tie him up?

622
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:28,773

Take a picture and send

00:25:36,183 --> 00:25:38,777
- Not in my God damn car. Where
I'm supposed to burn him at?

628
00:25:38,777 --> 00:25:41,045
- In the park somewhere,
put him in a trashcan.

629
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:42,697
- Well that works for me.
- Shoot the motherfucker.

- He is the worst husband ever.

He's broke, he works at
Target, he talks too much,

799
00:33:13,873 --> 00:33:18,290
he's a cheater, he's a
womanizer, he's a thief, he's.

- You know, you see the
signs, but you ignore them.

813
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:16,062
I was wondering why this
bitch didn't want to play

00:34:16,062 --> 00:34:17,395

815
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,888

Listen, bro, is this really necessary?

828
00:34:57,669 --> 00:35:02,502
I stopped paying for that life
insurance policy years ago.

00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:06,005

860
00:36:11,891 --> 00:36:13,808
- I don't know why?

861
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:16,301

00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:35,804
It's saying it expired due to nonpayment.

868
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:36,684
- Shit.

869
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:38,429

875
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:51,289

00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:52,957
- So his mama gunna me a million dollars.

877
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:56,464

878
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,712

00:37:01,745 --> 00:37:03,186
- So I ain't gotta kill him?

882
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:05,252

883
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:07,193

- Well you ain't got to tell me that,

00:38:33,957 --> 00:38:35,728
I've been talking to that retarded bitch.

923
00:38:35,728 --> 00:38:38,127
- Okay, so what's up.
Can you let a brother go?

924
00:38:38,127 --> 00:38:40,448
- No. We going to get
the money from your mama.

925
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:42,985
- My mom is on SSI. I
can't afford her meds.

926
00:38:42,985 --> 00:38:45,130
I work at Target. I'm trying
to get the supervisor job.

927
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,001
- What kinda shit is this?

928
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:48,844

930
00:38:50,406 --> 00:38:52,116
- Don't touch me.

931
00:38:52,116 --> 00:38:54,699
- Okay. I should kick your ass.

932
00:38:55,557 --> 00:38:57,273
I really should.

933
00:38:57,273 --> 00:38:59,858
But I know where we can get a big payday.

934
00:38:59,858 --> 00:39:02,058
As long as we split it, 50 50.

935
00:39:02,058 --> 00:39:03,015
- We ain't partners.

936
00:39:03,015 --> 00:39:04,996
If it's enough to split 50 50, then fine.

937
00:39:04,996 --> 00:39:07,329
- It's enough. Now untie me.

938
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:10,068
Come on man, we partners now.

939
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:11,153

941
00:39:12,388 --> 00:39:13,461
- Partners, partners.

942
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:14,705
- I don't do partners shit.

943
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:15,847
- Partners don't treat
each other like this.

944
00:39:15,847 --> 00:39:16,942
It's time to be more respectful.

945
00:39:16,942 --> 00:39:17,812
- One partner got the gun.

946
00:39:17,812 --> 00:39:21,966
- Okay? Remember we don't need
that no more, we're partners.

947
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:22,937
- Just get the fuck out the car.

948
00:39:22,937 --> 00:39:23,770
- Okay.

949
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,027

00:39:25,027 --> 00:39:26,861
What the fuck you doin.

951
00:39:26,861 --> 00:39:28,686
- Aren't we in a white
neighborhood anyway?

952
00:39:40,788 --> 00:39:42,567
- Man I really appreciate the drink.

953
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:43,400
- Yeah.

954
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,386

00:39:49,157 --> 00:39:51,046
- It was three hours.

958
00:39:51,046 --> 00:39:52,240
- Felt like a long time for me.

959
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,740
- Your breath so bad for three hours nigga

962
00:39:56,807 --> 00:39:59,474
(hip hop music)

963
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:03,606
- I know about you,
Quanita told me about you.

964
00:40:03,606 --> 00:40:05,706
So you stop doing that, Okay.

965
00:40:05,706 --> 00:40:07,645
You get this done and
then you might get some.

966
00:40:07,645 --> 00:40:10,301
- Whatever she said about
me is a motherfuckin' lie.

967
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:12,276
- [Sage Lee] She didn't
say nothin' bad about you.

968
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:13,845
Yep, they comin for you.

972
00:40:19,973 --> 00:40:20,806
- Okay.

973
00:40:20,806 --> 00:40:21,639
- That bitch works for me.

974
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:24,582
- Well Quanita said that I did
that shit that I didn't do,

975
00:40:24,582 --> 00:40:26,172
she's a damn liar, okay.

976
00:40:26,172 --> 00:40:29,663
Just know that, happened
one time, never again.

977
00:40:29,663 --> 00:40:31,193
- [Sage Lee] What is it

978
00:40:31,193 --> 00:40:33,485
Cause I don't know what your talkin about.

979
00:40:33,485 --> 00:40:37,402
- Look, she told me that

00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:41,535
but it wasn't my, it wasn't

981
00:40:41,535 --> 00:40:45,412
She put the booty on me.
Is that what she told you?

982
00:40:45,412 --> 00:40:46,524
- [Sage Lee] That's nasty.

983
00:40:46,524 --> 00:40:47,357
- Okay.

984
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:48,636
- [Sage Lee] Cause she didn't
tell me shit like that.

985
00:40:48,636 --> 00:40:49,528
- Okay, well then.

986
00:40:49,528 --> 00:40:53,611
- [Sage Lee] That's very
personal, T.M.I. T.M.I.

987
00:40:54,525 --> 00:40:56,187

(crickets chirping)

993
00:41:09,806 --> 00:41:11,196

00:41:45,686 --> 00:41:49,924
Now tell me your dumb ass

Who's toes I'm gunna lick? Who?

1007
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:20,629

00:42:20,629 --> 00:42:22,000
This is my first kidnapping gig.

1009
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,378

- I bought my mama into this.

1013
00:42:29,682 --> 00:42:31,360
- She bought your mama into this.

1014
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,021

00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:52,250
- No, because then you would've been dead.

1023
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,174
She woulda did it herself.

1024
00:42:54,174 --> 00:42:56,904
- But I guess all the murder

1025
00:42:56,904 --> 00:43:00,537
two timing, fuckin' cold hearted bitch.

1026

Couldn't see it.

00:43:08,948 --> 00:43:10,953
customers, co-workers, whoever.

Tryn' to get my supervisor position,

but these motherfuckers don't
want to promote a nigga.

1070
00:44:14,373 --> 00:44:17,408
- Damn, that's some cold shit man.

1071
00:44:17,408 --> 00:44:18,643

- You wouldn't have
that on your conscience.

1075
00:44:24,532 --> 00:44:27,101

And then make it look like you was dead.

00:44:33,154 --> 00:44:34,333
- I gotta gun.

1080

- Exactly. That's why I got it.

1082
00:44:37,628 --> 00:44:39,669

- You have no idea what
I need the money for.

1089
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:55,947
You got plans to get the

1097
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:11,174
- [Toddrick] Now you sound

1098
00:45:11,174 --> 00:45:13,606
- At the gas station.

1099
00:45:13,606 --> 00:45:14,662
- That's even worse.

1100
00:45:14,662 --> 00:45:16,584
- Oh, he told me he had.
- Did he have a cup or a car?

1101
00:45:16,584 --> 00:45:17,667
Cup or a car?

1102
00:45:19,152 --> 00:45:20,777

Or did he have a car?

1104
00:45:22,305 --> 00:45:24,653
- I actually don't know if
he did at the time or not

1105
00:45:24,653 --> 00:45:27,450
because it was moving pretty fast.

1106
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,834

and the bitch didn't answer the phone

1111
00:45:34,237 --> 00:45:35,560
because she was hoping you was dead.

1112
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,393
That's what happened, man?

1113
00:45:36,393 --> 00:45:38,003

00:58:03,953 --> 00:58:05,808
We have no money.

1376
00:58:05,808 --> 00:58:07,539
- [Jay] You are the brokest nigga I know.

1377
00:58:07,539 --> 00:58:09,409
- [Toddrick] And I robbed
the brokest nigga I met.

1378
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:10,346
- [Jay] That's crazy.

1379
00:58:10,346 --> 00:58:12,493
- Hey guys. I got a suggestion.

1380
00:58:12,493 --> 00:58:14,321
Why don't you take me to my house?

1381
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:16,398
- Why in the fuck would we do that?

1382
00:58:16,398 --> 00:58:17,959
- You have money problems, right?

1383
00:58:17,959 --> 00:58:19,885
I got money, cash at my house.

1384
00:58:19,885 --> 00:58:21,634
- [Jay] How much are we
talking about, white boy?

1385
00:58:21,634 --> 00:58:22,551
- $250,000.

1386
00:58:24,447 --> 00:58:26,197
- 250,000.
- $250,000.

1387
00:58:28,457 --> 00:58:33,457
(gasps) Nigga we back up,
baby we back up baby, I mean.

1388
00:58:34,631 --> 00:58:36,703
- [Jay] Now why the fuck would he have

1389
00:58:36,703 --> 00:58:38,139
that much amount of money?

1390
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,852
- [Toddrick] Cause he's not a fuckin' cop.

1391
00:58:39,852 --> 00:58:41,623
- [Jay] Nigga, you said he was
a cop, now you flip-floppin.

1392
00:58:41,623 --> 00:58:42,951
- [Toddrick] That's before
I knew he had some money.

1393
00:58:42,951 --> 00:58:44,557
250,000 is way too much for you.

1394
00:58:44,557 --> 00:58:46,940
What'd you doing with that kind of shit?

1395
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,942
- Hey look, you want to ask questions.

1396
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,321
You want to take me to my
house and get the money?

1397
00:58:50,321 --> 00:58:52,789
Let me go, call it a day, what do you say.

1398
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:53,737
- [Toddrick] Man, I don't trust him.

1399
00:58:53,737 --> 00:58:55,340
I can't, I don't think we can trust him.

1400
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,722
- Man, I barely trust your ass.

1401
00:58:56,722 --> 00:58:58,541
Look at the situation we got ourself in,

1402
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:00,052

1403
00:59:00,052 --> 00:59:02,310
- [Toddrick] True, true.
Where are you live at?

1404
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:04,591
- Oh, it's not far.
Just up the road a bit.

1405
00:59:04,591 --> 00:59:06,411
- [Toddrick] Okay, let's
go get some money nigga.

1406
00:59:06,411 --> 00:59:07,979
(car warning bell)

1407
00:59:07,979 --> 00:59:09,934
- [Jay] It better be all hundreds, cash.

1408
00:59:09,934 --> 00:59:12,228
I don't want to see no plastic.

1409
00:59:12,228 --> 00:59:14,069
And I hope you got some food
up in there, cause I'm hungry.

1410
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:15,864
Nigga, I'm about to make
me a big ass sandwich.

1411
00:59:15,864 --> 00:59:18,914
- We gunna need some gas to,
cause, I can't bring this back,

1412
00:59:18,914 --> 00:59:20,455
it's a rental.

1413
00:59:20,455 --> 00:59:22,105
Okay. Here's what we're going to do.

1414
00:59:22,105 --> 00:59:23,812
I'm go in with him. I'm

1415
00:59:23,812 --> 00:59:25,538
And then we out get out. We get out.

1416
00:59:25,538 --> 00:59:28,688
- Wow, why can't we go in together?

1417
00:59:28,688 --> 00:59:30,267
- What you mean, why
can't we go in together?

1418
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:31,799
- I mean.

1419
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:32,888
- You want be the guy to go in there

1420
00:59:32,888 --> 00:59:33,857
with the creepy white man,

1421
00:59:33,857 --> 00:59:35,765
then go for it, be my guest.

1422
00:59:35,765 --> 00:59:38,100
- Hey, so why can't I go in?

1423
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,423
I'm just sayin, I mean,

1424
00:59:40,423 --> 00:59:42,718
it makes more sense that we both go in.

1425
00:59:42,718 --> 00:59:44,041
(dramatic music)

1426
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:45,446
(fabric rustling)

1427
00:59:45,446 --> 00:59:49,263
- Hey look man, when we get in
there don't do no funny shit.

1428
00:59:49,263 --> 00:59:54,253
- Alright guys, the safes in
my room, just down the hall.

1429
00:59:54,253 --> 00:59:56,794
- Man, maybe I should
just hang back. You know.

1430
00:59:56,794 --> 00:59:58,984
- Just in case this
motherfucker tries somethin.

1431
00:59:58,984 --> 01:00:01,055
- Oh, you scared now, ha.

1432
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:01,953
- Ain't nobody scared.

1433
01:00:01,953 --> 01:00:03,499
But I'm just thinking,
bro, like, you know,

1434
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:06,486
just in case he try anything,
I can call for help.

1435
01:00:06,486 --> 01:00:07,530
- Call for help.

1436
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,128
Nigga we in the middle
of committin' a crime.

1437
01:00:09,128 --> 01:00:12,980
How the hell, who you gunna call for help?

1438
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,583
- I was thinking the police,

1439
01:00:14,583 --> 01:00:16,599
but maybe that's not a bad, a good idea.

1440
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:18,664
- This is how people end up on
the world's dumbest criminal.

1441
01:00:18,664 --> 01:00:19,975
- I ain't no God damn criminal.

1442
01:00:19,975 --> 01:00:21,118
- You just got out of jail nigga.

1443
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,899
- So you just bring up old shit.

1444
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:26,932
- Look, open it up.
Just open the damn door.

1445
01:00:26,932 --> 01:00:28,957

1446
01:00:28,957 --> 01:00:30,144
- Get in there.

1447
01:00:30,144 --> 01:00:32,311
(dramatic music)

1448
01:00:32,311 --> 01:00:34,519
Man, why you have to put my
business all on front street

1449
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:35,539
in front of this white ass cop.

1450
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:37,708
- He aint no God damn cop, remember.

1451
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:39,033
- But he know other cops.

1452
01:00:39,033 --> 01:00:42,742
Friends that are white and
he probably gonna tell em.

1453
01:00:42,742 --> 01:00:45,214
- Hey guys, I'm not a
cop and I don't know any.

1454
01:00:45,214 --> 01:00:46,831
Now, can we just get this over with?

Anything. You scream.

1459
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:55,964
- Okay, okay, alright.

01:01:57,168 --> 01:02:00,072
This is a fake gun. Where's the real gun?

01:02:00,072 --> 01:02:00,905
Oh shit.

01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:21,720

- I can't bro. You

1495
01:02:24,291 --> 01:02:26,013
- [Toddrick] If I could
unlock the God damn door

1496
01:02:26,013 --> 01:02:28,630
I'd be out already, it's
locked from the outside idiot.

1497
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:30,618
- Why the fuck you tell
me to open it then?

1498
01:02:30,618 --> 01:02:32,223
- You know what, just use your brain

1499
01:02:32,223 --> 01:02:36,090
and your fuckin' foot
and kick the door open.

1500
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:38,001
Wait, let me get out of the way.

1501
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:39,753
(loud bang)

1502
01:02:39,753 --> 01:02:42,716
- [Jay] Nigga, he just
turned off the lights.

1503
01:02:42,716 --> 01:02:46,024
- Do you feel anything? Is
he out there raping on you?

1504
01:02:46,024 --> 01:02:47,334
- [Jay] No, what the fuck.

1505
01:02:47,334 --> 01:02:48,950
- Give it a minute, cause once
he started fuckin' on you,

1506
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:50,274
I'm just gona run.

1507
01:02:50,274 --> 01:02:52,213
- [Jay] You can't run

1508
01:02:52,213 --> 01:02:55,051

01:02:56,701 --> 01:02:59,487
(door rattling)

1511
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:01,591
- Nigga, where'd you
get the flashlight from?

1512
01:03:01,591 --> 01:03:03,173
- Oh it came with the fake badge.

1513
01:03:03,173 --> 01:03:05,432
- We need to get the fuck out of here.

1514
01:03:05,432 --> 01:03:06,982
- What about the $250,000 man.

1515
01:03:06,982 --> 01:03:08,978
- Are you out of your
mind? That imaginary money.

1516
01:03:08,978 --> 01:03:10,697
He just said that to lure us in here.

1517
01:03:10,697 --> 01:03:12,546
- What you mean lure?

1518
01:03:12,546 --> 01:03:14,358
- Meaning he wanted to kill us or hump us.

1519
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:16,130
I see it all the time on the fuckin' news.

1520
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,188
Why do you think I wanted
to go by the fuckin' door?

1521
01:03:18,188 --> 01:03:21,159
Just face it, bro. We
both got lured in here.

1522
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:22,948
- Stop using the fuckin' word lure.

1523
01:03:22,948 --> 01:03:24,352
- Make me feel like some retarded ass kid

1524
01:03:24,352 --> 01:03:26,229
has got in somebodies van
for some fuckin' candy.

1525
01:03:26,229 --> 01:03:27,938
Look, I ain't gonna get botty touch,

1526
01:03:27,938 --> 01:03:29,167
I ain't sucking no dicks.

1527
01:03:29,167 --> 01:03:31,667
Now you shut the fuck up
and let's find this money.

1528
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:33,656
- Alright nigga, come on.

1529
01:03:33,656 --> 01:03:34,909
- Shit.

1530
01:03:34,909 --> 01:03:36,629
- Man did you hear that?

1531
01:03:36,629 --> 01:03:38,279
- [Miller] Come out and play.

1532
01:03:38,279 --> 01:03:39,600
- What the fuck your the one with the gun.

1533
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,223
- Nigga, it's fake.

1534
01:03:41,223 --> 01:03:42,735
- He don't know that.

1535
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:44,202
- [Miller] I know that gun is fake.

1536
01:03:44,202 --> 01:03:47,836
Came with a fake badge, right? (laughing)

1537
01:03:47,836 --> 01:03:49,185
- How I supposed to know the motherfucker

1538
01:03:49,185 --> 01:03:50,863
shop at the same store I shop at.

1539
01:03:50,863 --> 01:03:51,696
- [Jay] I got an idea.

01:09:43,911 --> 01:09:46,264

1714
01:09:46,264 --> 01:09:50,247
Oh yeah, Teddy Todd baby.
I'm on my way to the top.

1715
01:09:50,247 --> 01:09:53,088
If you don't think that
it's ain't going to be fire.

1716
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:54,879
Wait, to you see part two?

Damn, there's a lot of
motherfuckers out here.

1719
01:09:58,506 --> 01:10:01,876
Anybody else got scared from the fire?

1720
01:10:01,876 --> 01:10:03,674
Nigger, I was nervous as

1721
01:10:03,674 --> 01:10:04,691

1722
01:10:04,691 --> 01:10:05,524
I said "Where?"

1723
01:10:05,524 --> 01:10:08,075
They said fuckin' "Backyard
barbecue, Compton."

1724
01:10:08,075 --> 01:10:11,050
(crowd laughing)

1725
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:12,860

1727
01:10:14,153 --> 01:10:15,544
I sent out a text
message to all my people,

1728
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,520
said "Y'all need to come support."

1729
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,422
Y'all should have read
the replies and shit.

1730
01:10:19,422 --> 01:10:21,138
They said, "Nigga, you tryn' to set me up?

1731
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:23,511
Nigga, I told you I was
gonna get your $20 back.

1732
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,399
Get your money back
nigga, I don't wana die."

1733
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:26,233
(crowd laughing)

1734
01:10:26,233 --> 01:10:27,762
That's bullshit, we in Compton nigga.

1735
01:10:27,762 --> 01:10:30,478
But I didn't know Compton
had, enough room like this.

1736
01:10:30,478 --> 01:10:32,841
What, who's house is this?

1737
01:10:32,841 --> 01:10:35,498
Shit, this must be when
redline is startin.

1738
01:10:35,498 --> 01:10:37,871
It's like you niggas are over there.

1739
01:10:37,871 --> 01:10:39,046
Crackers over here.

1740
01:10:39,046 --> 01:10:40,145
(crowd laughing)

1741
01:10:40,145 --> 01:10:42,910
Got one of these cracker
properties, I love it, shit.

1742
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,778
I know yous all pulled up
ands like "Where we at?"

1743
01:10:44,778 --> 01:10:47,839
You seen all the weed growin in the front.

1744
01:10:47,839 --> 01:10:51,745
Came to the back, this bitch
is dead than a motherfucker.

1745
01:10:51,745 --> 01:10:54,694
What kinda fuckin' lawn
guy you got (laughs)?

1746
01:10:54,694 --> 01:10:56,868
The nigga done put the
fake dead grass back in,

1747
01:10:56,868 --> 01:10:59,625
let you know they been tryin.

1748
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:01,206
What the fuck are y'all doin.

1749
01:11:01,206 --> 01:11:02,642
But the real reason why
I got nervous and shit

1750
01:11:02,642 --> 01:11:04,062
cause I don't like goin to peoples houses.

1751
01:11:04,062 --> 01:11:06,398
That's not my thing. I don't, fuck it.

1752
01:11:06,398 --> 01:11:08,530
Cause y'all got to many house
rules, you know what I mean?

1753
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:09,683
It's not like the club and shit,

1754
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:11,082
just don't wear your hat nigga.

1755
01:11:11,082 --> 01:11:12,669
It's different, you come
to somebody's house,

1756
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:15,301
its like "Aah, take of your shoes buddy."

1757
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:16,458
(crowd laughing)

1758
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:17,780
What the fuck is wrong wit
you? You know my feet stink.

1759
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:19,771
Niggas don't wear socks unless
we got on the flip flops.

1760
01:11:19,771 --> 01:11:20,980
(crowd laughing)

1761
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:23,653
Some weird shit going on.

1762
01:11:23,653 --> 01:11:24,627
I went to this one white lady's house,

1763
01:11:24,627 --> 01:11:26,673
the bitch took my jacket, I was nervous.

1764
01:11:26,673 --> 01:11:29,832
"Bitch took my jacket, my weeds in there."

1765
01:11:29,832 --> 01:11:31,305
What the fuck is wrong with you bitch?

1766
01:11:31,305 --> 01:11:34,125
It took me 40 minutes to
find the hoe and my jacket.

1767
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:34,958
- [Lady] We're gonna need you done.

1768
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,300
- God damn, need to sit my drink down,

1769
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,467
cause the ice done melted.

1770
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:41,096
Shoulda gave me 30 minutes nigga,

1771
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:43,193
I got 30 minutes and five
minutes jokes for you niggas

1772
01:11:43,193 --> 01:11:44,528
right quick.

1773
01:11:44,528 --> 01:11:47,148
But any way, na, I seen
you all in this bitch,

1774
01:11:47,148 --> 01:11:47,981
and she got a Rottweiler.

1775
01:11:47,981 --> 01:11:50,062
Y'all seen the Rottweiler?

1776
01:11:50,062 --> 01:11:51,587
I thought it was a white person dog

1777
01:11:51,587 --> 01:11:52,917
because the tail wasn't cut.

1778
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:54,702
(crowd laughing)

1779
01:11:54,702 --> 01:11:56,351
You ain't train this nigga to do shit.

1780
01:11:56,351 --> 01:11:57,984
(crowd laughing)

1781
01:11:57,984 --> 01:12:00,491
God damn lickin his own
ass, nigga you got to fight.

1782
01:12:00,491 --> 01:12:02,770
Live out in Compton
niggas, this a Compton dog.

1783
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:04,662
Yo fuckin' up your dog with your jump.

1784
01:12:04,662 --> 01:12:07,163
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1785
01:12:07,163 --> 01:12:08,618
No, but I went to my white friend's house

1786
01:12:08,618 --> 01:12:10,139
and I broke one of the
fuckin' house rules.

1787
01:12:10,139 --> 01:12:11,855
I hate the house rule shit. I didn't know.

1788
01:12:11,855 --> 01:12:13,023
I said fuck it. You know what I mean?

1789
01:12:13,023 --> 01:12:14,775
I put on socks just in case.

1790
01:12:14,775 --> 01:12:16,257
So I jumped out the shit

1791
01:12:16,257 --> 01:12:17,759
and the nigga dog was following me around

1792
01:12:17,759 --> 01:12:18,822
the whole fuckin' times.

1793
01:12:18,822 --> 01:12:19,655
I said,

1794
01:12:19,655 --> 01:12:21,764
"This dog is followin a nigga
around, this is bullshit."

1795
01:12:21,764 --> 01:12:22,825
I didn't know he was hungry.

1796
01:12:22,825 --> 01:12:24,621
So I gave that nigga some chicken.

1797
01:12:24,621 --> 01:12:26,226
Here you go motherfucker,
he tore that shit down.

1798
01:12:26,226 --> 01:12:27,292
(lips smacking)

1799
01:12:27,292 --> 01:12:29,450
(dog growling)

1800
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:31,408
He swallowed that shit and started going

1801
01:12:31,408 --> 01:12:34,749
(chocking) "Help."

1802
01:12:34,749 --> 01:12:37,949
I said, "Bitch. This nigga
dog to ask for help."

1803
01:12:37,949 --> 01:12:39,467
I said, "You gotta get
the away from me nigga,

1804
01:12:39,467 --> 01:12:42,261
don't blame this shit on me."

1805
01:12:42,261 --> 01:12:43,895
White dude came down
the stairs mad as fuck,

1806
01:12:43,895 --> 01:12:47,840
"Oh my God. Did you fuckin' feed him?"

1807
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,877
I said "I didn't feed him,

1808
01:12:48,877 --> 01:12:50,235
I might've dropped some
chicken on the ground

1809
01:12:50,235 --> 01:12:51,562
and the nigga ate it."

1810
01:12:51,562 --> 01:12:53,780
He said "He can't eat human."

1811
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,747
I said "I said chicken
bitch, no human in the.

1812
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:57,812
What the fuck is wrong with you?"

1813
01:12:57,812 --> 01:13:01,255
He said "He can't eat
what we eat. Fucker."

1814
01:13:01,255 --> 01:13:04,116
When white people call you
fucker, you crossed a line.

1815
01:13:04,116 --> 01:13:05,463
There's almost no going back.

1816
01:13:05,463 --> 01:13:06,717
I said these niggas got my shoes.

1817
01:13:06,717 --> 01:13:09,300
(crowd laughs)

1818
01:13:10,212 --> 01:13:14,529
They said, "Do you understand
this dog has fuckin' diabetes?

1819
01:13:14,529 --> 01:13:17,586
Level three, M.H. I don't
know what the fuck that is.

1820
01:13:17,586 --> 01:13:19,775
But he had it. He's go corona."

1821
01:13:19,775 --> 01:13:22,511
I said, "Well God Damn,
how'd he get all this shit?"

1822
01:13:22,511 --> 01:13:25,641
He said "He had it when we got him."

1823
01:13:25,641 --> 01:13:28,391
(crowd laughing)

1824
01:13:30,838 --> 01:13:33,386
Now only white people do shit like that.

1825
01:13:33,386 --> 01:13:36,545
They wana rescue the dying motherfuckers.

1826
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,628
Come on now, this niggas
on medicated food.

1827
01:13:38,628 --> 01:13:40,568
How the fuck was I supposed to know?
