00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:15,493
Oh, Alex. Hi.

5
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:16,538
Come on in.

6
00:00:16,668 --> 00:00:17,887
Hey, sorry to interrupt you.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,193
I thought I'd catch you
before you went home.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,282
Oh, no problem. What's up?

9
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:23,806
I just wanted to talk to
you real quick about the test.

10
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:25,286
What is it, Alex?

11
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:30,682
I just...

12
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:35,383
think you might have misjudged
some of my essay questions.

13
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:37,124
Alex...

14
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:37,776
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:38,821
I just-

16
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:40,388
I can't get a C in this class.

17
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:41,911
I'm a senior.

18
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,478
It's going to bring
down my average,

19
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:45,523
and I need a great average
for college applications.

20
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,438
Plus my father is...

21
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:48,309
Look...

22
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,660
I stand by the grade I gave you.

23
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,704
If you want to do some-

24
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:53,575
No, I deserved a better grade!

25
00:00:53,705 --> 00:00:54,663
[tense music]

26
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:55,968
Alex, settle down.

27
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,187
No, I'm no going
to settle down! Okay?

28
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:58,406
You're going to take this test,

29
00:00:58,493 --> 00:00:59,929
reassess your grading system,

30
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:01,061
and give me the
grade I deserved!

31
00:01:01,148 --> 00:01:02,018
-Alex.
-Now!

The fifth outburst
this year. My own son.

Charles, stop.

36
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,579
I'm just saying.

37
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:45,322
If he wants a better
grade, he has to earn it.

38
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:48,195
Not whine about it in
front of the whole school!

[tense music]

40
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:52,721
Shut up.

41
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:56,725
What did you say to me?

42
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:58,466
I said shut up!

00:01:58,596 --> 00:01:59,641
[grunting]

44
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:00,598

Mom, stop!

52
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,188
I can teach you
things from here.

53
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:10,102
Oh yeah, because you
double-majored in business

54
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,713
and anthropology.

55
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:13,149
Sorry.

56
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:15,543
We just had such a great summer.

57
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:16,457
The best.

58
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:22,071
Okay, I can't take
this. I'm coming with you.

59
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:24,160
Okay, enough. Let's just...

60
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,467
Let's rip off the bandaid!

61
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:28,120
Best friends?

62
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,252
Forever.

63
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:30,645
Christmas break
for sure, right?

64
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:32,342
Yeah.

65
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:34,126
And text every day, even
if it's just an emoji.

66
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,824
Every day.

67
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,086
I will, I swear.

68
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,223
Okay, I'm ripping the bandaid.

69
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,755
I love you, Mom.

70
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:55,757
And I had the best summer!

71
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:58,238
And thank you.

72
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:01,763
I love you too, sweetie.

73
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,512
Good luck on your
presentation! Okay?

74
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,209
You're going to kill it.

Pull yourself together, Maya.

80

Hey, how'd it go?

83
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:53,554
I'm going to miss her.

84
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:54,816
She's such a sweetie.

85
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:56,383
She brought me a gift
bag and thanked me

86
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,995
for finding time in your
schedule this week. [chuckles]

87
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:00,778
Are you good?

88
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:02,302
Yeah. I'll be fine.

89
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:03,085
Let me have it.

90
00:05:03,172 --> 00:05:04,478

Perfect.

94
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:09,700
Look, he likes you!

95
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:11,223
You get this deal
with the hospitals,

96
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,790
you're looking at
an easy promotion.

97
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:15,619
Which means I get a promotion,
so get yourself together.

98
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:17,665
Hi!
Morning, Jane.

99
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,144
Well that's a
little presumptuous.

100
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:20,668
Look, I'll get you a coffee.

101
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:23,192
Presentation is queued
in the board room.

102
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,193
Anything else?

103
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,063
What would I do without you?

104
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,761
That would be a sad sight.

105
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:29,285
Before I forget, the
new intern is in today.

106
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,330
I'll bring him by
after the presentation.

107
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,461
You can meet him.

108
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,245
You take just good care of me,

109
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,116
I don't think there'll be
anything for him to do.

110
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:36,423
Exactly. Remember that.

111
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:38,555
Besides, all project
managers get fall interns.

112
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:41,166
We're stuck with him, but
he can do the dirty work.

113
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:42,777
All right.

114
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:46,128
As you can see, our
software is years ahead.

117
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:51,307
It's 20 billion.

from coast to coast,

of patients' records.

120
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:57,661
Nobody has the
connectivity, speed,

121
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:00,708
and resources
Newmark can provide.

122
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:03,319
Newmark will allow hospitals
easy, simple access

to their patients' records
in a seamless fashion.

for being here today,

125
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:09,891
and we look forward to
doing business together

00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:10,848

Thank you for that.

130
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:20,728
You made me look good in there.

131
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:21,685
So when can we meet with them?

132
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:22,817
Couple of weeks.

133
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:24,253

already in the works.

134
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,342
Good. I want you
to head it off.

You do what you did in
there, it's a sure thing.

I'm not a pitch man.
I just write the code.

want you on point for it

the whole way through,
national and international.

I appreciate it.

You've earned it.

143
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,617
And Becky and I will have you
over for dinner to celebrate.

144
00:06:40,748 --> 00:06:42,097
Sounds good.

145
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:48,408

Well she's pretty busy, so
report to me with questions.

151
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:59,157
I have her schedule
down to the last minute.

152
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:01,899
No need to ask her if she
wants coffee or anything.

153
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,640
She likes to get out of the
office a few times a day.

154
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:04,598
You with me?

155
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:06,164
Yes. 100%.

rattling all of this off.

I don't mean to be short.

158
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,125
No, it's okay. I can tell.

159
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:11,561
I can learn a lot from you.

160

Let me show you
where you're working.

161

You know, I was actually
her first intern.

162
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:18,742
I've been there. You'll be fine.

163
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:20,352
The internship is three months.

will happen through there.

chance at the new office.

00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:13,101
Okay, let's see
what we got here.

186
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:16,583
Impressive.

187
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:20,369
Business major. I was too.

188
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,240
And you went to
Eastwood University.

189
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:24,329
My daughter is on her
way there right now.

190
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,854
Oh, she'll love it
there, Mrs. Taylor.

191
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:29,334
Miss. And, please, it's Maya.

192
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,642
So you graduated...

193
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,165
Three years ago.

194
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:35,123
Then I signed up for
two-year active duty

195
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:36,516
with the Army Reserves.

196
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:38,605
University's ROTC helped
me get ready for that.

197
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:41,085
Wow. Appreciate the sacrifice.

198
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:42,478
My father was in
the service. Army.

199
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:43,523
Hooah!

200
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,785
[Maya chuckles]

201
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:46,351
I just flashed
back to my childhood.

202
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,963
Heard that a lot in my house.

203
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:50,051
Did he serve in Vietnam?

204
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:51,531
Yeah. Tough war.

205
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,185
Much respect to him.

206
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:55,447
I...

207
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:57,101
I didn't see any action.

208
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:58,450
Spent most of my
time in an office

209
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,278
fetching coffee for
a Lieutenant Colonel.

210
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,063
They have me on
reserves for now.

211
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,194
Your family from around here?

212
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:04,152
No!

213
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:07,329
Uh...

214
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:08,504
A few hours away.

215
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:10,419
That's where I grew up.

216
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:14,249
Well, this looks great.

217
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:17,339
Happy to have you for
the next few months.

218
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:18,732
It'll be mostly go-fer duties.

219
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,342
Kate runs a pretty tight ship.

220
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:21,822
But we'll do our best

221
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:23,171
to give you some more
important things to do

222
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:23,911
so you can learn a bit.

223
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:25,129
Yes, Ma'am.

224
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,088
Okay. Ma'am is
even worse than Miss.

225
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:27,741
Sorry.

226
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,134
Force of habit.

227
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:31,658
But I am very excited.

228
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:35,096
My last internship, it was...

229
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:37,577
Wait. I don't see it on here.

230
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:38,447
Oh, uh...

231
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,668
unfortunately they went under,

232
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:44,322
so I wasn't sure
if I should add it.

233
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:45,759
All right.

234
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:50,024
Well, did Kate tell you
about the company perks?

235
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:51,678
Uh, no. There's...

236
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:53,462
There's perks?

237
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,637
Mm-hm.

238
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:56,334
Lunches are on the company.

239
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:58,293
We have an account at most of
the restaurants in the area.

240
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,555
And on the first floor
we get full access

241
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:01,165
to the Athletic Club.

242
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:03,385
I'm there every night
trying to turn back the clock.

243
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:06,040
[Alex chuckles]

244
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,476
I think that's it.

245
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,738
You can go talk to
the receptionist.

246
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,132
She can help you finish
off your paperwork.

247
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:12,307
Paperwork?

248
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:13,743
Yeah. Just the basic stuff.

249
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,527
I mean, I know the
internship doesn't pay much,

250
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,356
but we still got to get your
address, bank information

251
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:21,098
background check,
that kind of thing.

252
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:22,317
Is that an issue?

253
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:26,234
Uh, no, no. It's just...

254
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:28,845
I closed my accounts at the
last just before the move,

255
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:31,413
and I haven't had a chance
to open a new one yet.

256
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:32,893
You can work it out with her.

257
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,244
We have that call with
the hospital in a few.

258
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:39,639
Ah, completely lost track
of time. That's right.

259
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,641
Okay, well, great meeting you,

260
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:44,600
and enjoy those free lunches.

261
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:45,427
And the Athletic Club.

262
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:48,256
Yes. [chuckles]

263
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:53,043
Maya?

264
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,871
Yes?

265
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:57,831
Can I get you a
coffee or anything?

266
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:01,312
No. Thank you though.

267
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,711
Here you go. Just
fill these out.

268
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:09,538
Okay.

269
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:20,375
Yeah, I need to grab some
information for these two.

270
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:22,377
Kate said it would okay
to hold off for now.

271
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:26,120
Let me just get her
approval on that quick.

272
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:28,600
[phone ringing]

273
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,732
Hey, hey.

274
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:31,212
Jeez!

275
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:32,213
Listen, you earn
your paycheck.

276
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:33,997
Let me earn mine, all right?

277
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,259
Hey.

278
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:37,305
Hey, Kate.

279
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:39,263
Alex said he needed some time
on the bank information and...

280
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,047
Yeah, don't worry
about it, Jane.

281
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:41,831
Thanks.

282
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,137
Look, he's already
causing problems.

283
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:44,138
Oh stop.

284
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:46,270
He seems sweet. Here.

285
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:47,750
Okay.

286
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:48,664
Just fill out the
rest of the stuff

287
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,100
and get those to
me when you can.

288
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:51,145
Sounds good.

289
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,450
Can a grab you a coffee?

290
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:54,365
Easy, go-getter. I'm
just the receptionist.

291
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:55,584
Never know when you're
going to move on up.

292
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,716
Mm-hm. Yeah.

I am so sorry! I...

295
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:16,605
No, no, no. It's...

296
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,608
It's okay. I shouldn't
walk and read.

297
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,262
Well, they taught
us in the service

298
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:23,394
to keep our head on a swivel.

299
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:24,569
If my Drill Sergeant saw me now

300
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:27,007
I'd be doing
pushups till sun-up.

301
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,618

Ah, yeah, yeah.
Don't let me keep you.

305
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:38,758
I just finished up.

306
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:41,586
Have a good workout.

307
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:43,197

They had the best
tacos! It's a tragedy.

368
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:28,308
Ooh, I smell coffee! You game?

369
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,658
Uh, yeah. Am I ever not?

370
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:32,877
You go in. I just want
to enjoy the fresh air.

371
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:33,617
Sure.
You know what I like.

372
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:34,488
Yeah.

373
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,278
[Ben] We did that one
for a meat packing company.

374
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:44,237
Sorry.

375
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:46,326
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

376
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:49,285
It's okay. I'm just
naturally a little jumpy.

377
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:51,157
Meat?

378
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,636
Oh. Yes.

379
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:56,031
That is a meat packing
company design for their logo.

380
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:57,772
We're a graphic design company.

381
00:17:57,902 --> 00:17:59,817
Oh! I thought it
was an art gallery.

382
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:02,211
We design logos and other
graphic art work for businesses.

383
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:03,691
It's a booming
business district.

384
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:05,475
About 50 new companies.

385
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:09,175
I thought, why not show our
portfolio for all to see?

386
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:11,960
That's clever. I like it.

387
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,266
Ben Johnson.

388
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:16,399
Right.

389
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,835
I'm-

390
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,010
About to be late for
your board meeting.

391
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,795
I'm sorry. She's right.

392
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:23,232
No problem. You
know where to find me.

393
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:25,539
I'll give you the grand tour.

394
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,630
[ominous music]

395
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:39,944
[bright instrumental music]

396
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:44,427
I think we killed a
generation of trees.

397
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:47,256
This is the only way
I memorize this stuff.

398
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:49,345
I'm analog dependent.

399
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:52,174
Don't judge me.
We'll recycle it.

400
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:54,524
It's like a desk
of tree genocide.

401
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:55,743
[both laugh]

402
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,484
[Alex clears throat]

403
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:00,226
I have some more for the pile.

404
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:01,140
What are you still doing here?

405
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:02,837
I thought you left hours ago.

406
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:05,492
Good at being
invisible I guess.

407
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:07,494
Thanks, but we
have all the copies

408
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:09,191
we need of these figures.

409
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:11,019
Oh, I color-coded it.

410
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:15,241
Blue are figures
for two years ago.

411
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,243
Red are last fiscal year.

412
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,723
And green are projections.

413
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,639
[mumbling]

414
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:23,814
Figured I'd...

415
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:27,209
I was trying to find green.

416
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,776
'Cause Maya, you're
going to be making

417
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:32,345
a lot of green for this
company in the next few days.

418
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:33,172
Wow.

419
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:35,478
Wow indeed.

420
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:39,743
Thanks, Alex. Have a good night.

421
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:42,224
I can grab you some
food if you like.

422
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:45,096
Oh, no. I need to get
home and get some rest.

423
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,968
I can give you a ride.

424
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:47,664
Alex...

425
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:50,841
No, sorry, I just...

426
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,756
I don't think you should be
driving if you're this tired.

427
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:54,323
That's all.

428
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,064
Besides, it's on my way.

429
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:58,458
And how do you know?

430
00:19:58,588 --> 00:19:59,415
No. I just...

431
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:00,329
Sorry, I mean I don't mind.

432
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,504
No.

433
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:03,767
I appreciate the
sentiment, Alex.

434
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:05,508
I'll be fine.

435
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,336
Big gulp for the road.

436
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:10,774
[tapping on phone]

437
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:13,995
That'll be all,
Alex. Thank you.

438
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:14,691
Okay.

439
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:17,085
Night.

440
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,135
That is one
over-achieving kid.

441
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,528
Oh, stop.

442
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:27,356
He's not that much
younger than you.

443
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:30,620
And he reminds me of my
intern in her early years.

444
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,448
Besides, you never
color-coded my files for me.

445
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:34,233
[scoffs]

446
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,322
Look how beautiful that is.

447
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:37,236
I hate you.

448
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:40,195
[Maya chuckles]

449
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,152
Okay.

450
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:41,849
You okay?

451
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,198
[crickets chirping]

452
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,895
Yeah.

453
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:47,289
I know that look.

454
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,465
We just really need
to close this deal.

455
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:50,814
Maya, you could do
this presentation tonight

456
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,729
and you would nail it.

457
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:56,429
You're over-preparing.
That's what you do.

458
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:58,518
It's something else though.

459
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:03,087
Come on! I'm not leaving
till you spill the beans.

460
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:04,088
It's just...

461
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,309
the house, the career...

462
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:08,267
the divorce.

463
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:10,356
Emma's gone. It's lonely.

464
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:12,662
I mean, I have you. I love you.

465
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:14,447
You're amazing, but...

466
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:19,669
It's been awhile since
you've seen some action.

467
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,583
[Maya gasps]

468
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,541
Katelyn Nash!

469
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:22,368
[Kate laughs]

470
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:23,760
What? Come on!

471
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,196
It's us. It's me.

472
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:28,243
I mean, I haven't
seen any in months.

473
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:29,766
Months, wow. Okay, now
I'm really depressed.

474
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:31,290
Try a couple years.

475
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,380
You have got the
art gallery guy.

476
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,295
That's a prospect.

477
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:38,862
It's not an art gallery in...

478
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:40,386
Wait a minute?

479
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:42,344
How do you know?

480
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,738
Why do you think I
came and pulled you away?

481
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:48,176
Makes you look all
mysterious and intriguing.

482
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:50,352
What would I do without you?

483
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,441
Well, you wouldn't get laid.

484
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:56,967
Part of my job apparently
I've been slacking on.

485
00:21:57,054 --> 00:21:58,708
You have no idea how badly
I want to knock those papers

486
00:21:58,795 --> 00:21:59,666
out of your hand right now.

487
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:01,232
Oh, come on.

488
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:04,279
You have to admit
color-coding is next level.

489
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,412
And now I'm leaving. Okay.

490
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:07,456
Drive safe.

491
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:08,414
Goodnight.
Night.

492
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:11,068

499
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:48,802
Whoa!

[tires squealing]

[breathing heavily]

503
00:22:58,202 --> 00:22:58,725
Oh my god!

504
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:03,207
[cars crash]

505
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:06,167
[horn blaring]

506

[car horn honking]

00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,407
[Man] Hey! Are you okay?

511
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:32,759
[Kate groaning]

512
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:41,115
[tires squealing]

[anxious electronic music]

514
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:54,171
[Alex] Hey, what's going on?

515
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:54,781
You okay?

516
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:58,132
It's Kate.

517
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:07,576
[Alex] Maya?

518
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:10,100
You heard?

519
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,799
Yeah.

520
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:13,843
Not much but-

521
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,279
It was a car accident.

522
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:17,151
She ran into something.

523
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:19,109
Is she...

524
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:20,154
Okay? Yeah.

525
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:22,722
Have you talked to her?

526
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,201
No, not yet.

527
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:25,768
I'm waiting for them
to say it's okay.

528
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:29,598
She's pretty banged up
I guess. Bad concussion.

529
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,079
I overworked her.

530
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:32,732
Maya.

531
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:34,342
No, I did.

532
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:36,692
She said it herself. I
over-prepare, it's my thing.

533
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:37,693
My thing almost killed her.

534
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,391
This is not your fault.

535
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,306
She was wide awake
when she left here.

536
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:45,484
Or at least last time I saw her.

537
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:47,355
This is not your fault.

538
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:50,097
Okay?

539
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:51,315
Accidents happen.

540
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:55,319
Thanks.

541
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,673
[phone ringing]

542
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,500
I got it.

543
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:11,684
Maya Taylor's office.
How can I help you?

544
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,818
Hey.

545
00:25:15,905 --> 00:25:18,081
Where are you going?
You've got that call.

546
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:19,126
I moved it.

547
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:20,127
I heard back from Kate.

548
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:21,302
She can take visitors.

549
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:22,172
I'll...

550
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:26,263
I'll go with you,
if that's okay.

551
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,223
She's just been
so helpful for me.

552
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,095
Okay.

553
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:32,835
Thanks.

554
00:25:39,494 --> 00:25:41,496
I'm sure she'll be fine.

555
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:44,194
I still feel so bad.

556
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:47,284
It must have been so scary.

Most people in car
accidents don't remember.

558
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:50,766
The mind has a way
of protecting itself

559
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:52,681
from that kind of stuff.

560
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:57,817
Hopefully she doesn't
remember anything.

561
00:25:57,904 --> 00:26:00,471
I've never been
in an accident.

562
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,082
Have you?

563
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:02,735
Yeah.

[Alex's Father] What
did you say to me?

567
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:12,658
I said shut up!

568
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:13,572
We're here.

Hey.

574
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:42,296
I'm okay.

worked that late.

Are you kidding? I
was on a coffee high.

577
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:53,568
This wasn't your fault.

578
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:55,004
It's not your fault.

579
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:56,440

you don't want to remember.

Maybe it's for the best.

is that you're okay.

today and nail it.

could use a breather,

he's old-fashioned.

likely closed on by now.

What about you?

733
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,469
[Ralph] Thanks, but
I'm headed out in a bit.

734
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,644
[Jane] Okay!

735
00:35:24,731 --> 00:35:28,517
[ominous electronic music]

736
00:35:28,604 --> 00:35:29,997
Lose your appetite?

737
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:32,521
Sorry?

738
00:35:32,608 --> 00:35:35,176
You didn't get anything.

739
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:37,309
Thought of something better.

740
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:50,626
Hey, did you want me to pick
up the lunch order for you?

741
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:52,237
I'm heading out anyway.

742
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:53,107
[Jane] Are you sure?

743
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:54,717
Yeah. I don't mind.

744
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:56,328
That'd be great.
You're a lifesaver.

745
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:57,633
Thanks.

746
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,765
[Alex] Happy to help.

Lunch is here.

751
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:30,492
We've got...

752
00:36:30,623 --> 00:36:32,190
That's for you, sir.

753
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,497
Extra dressing, right?

754
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:39,588
Mr. Meyer, pasta
special I assume.

755
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:40,633
Wow.

756
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,722
Thanks. How'd you know?

757
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:46,682
A good intern always
knows or tries to at least.

758
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:48,467
What was your name?

759
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:49,337
Alex.

760
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,391
Mm.

761
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:01,480
Missed this place.

762
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,744
All right. Dig in and
we'll get to business.

763
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:06,136

Hey.

781
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:12,594
Is he okay?

782
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:14,422
No.

783
00:38:14,553 --> 00:38:16,381
He wasn't that responsive
when they took him out.

784
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:19,166
They gave him some
shot or something.

785
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:21,299
I feel so horrible for him.

786
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:27,305
Well, that's karma, I guess.

787
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:29,176
Alex.

788
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:33,441
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

789
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:36,009
I just think out loud sometimes.

790
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:38,490
That's okay.

791
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,362
I can't lie.

792
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:45,497
Same thing crossed my mind,
which is why I feel so bad.

793
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:49,631
Why don't you call it a night.

794
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:51,241
I'm going to get some
more work done here

795
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:53,287
and then take the
rest home with me.

It's been a strange day.

Did you want any help?

798
00:38:56,812 --> 00:38:58,597
No. I'm good.

799
00:38:58,684 --> 00:39:01,991
It'll be nice to have the
office to myself for a bit.

800

Have a good night.

that your favorite
show premiers tonight.

How did you know?

talking about it last week.

don't sound fine.

It's just...

00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,217
It's this security system.

just do a walk through.

could have been up there.

was open is down there.

No, no. It's good to be safe.

857
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:39,285
I think what happened is
just sometimes one door opens

858
00:44:39,415 --> 00:44:41,200
it can cause the other
one to suction in and out.

She has a daughter

After that, it was just
about the logistics,

889
00:46:13,422 --> 00:46:15,294
and then we had
an amazing lunch,

890
00:46:15,381 --> 00:46:19,777
and then more logistics,
then an amazing dinner.

Yeah, you're probably right.

have to celebrate!

With what?

922
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:41,684
And that was the moment
I knew it was really over.

923
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:43,643
Best day of my life
for both Emma and I.

924

Well, his loss.

925
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:48,735
What about you?

926
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:50,693
What's your family like?

927
00:47:53,522 --> 00:47:54,784
I'm sorry. I didn't...

928

No, it's...

It's okay.

Everyone has family.

My folks died in a
car accident when I
was in high school.

I was in the car with them.

934

My dad just lost control.

935
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,769
They said it was a
miracle I survived.

936
00:48:24,249 --> 00:48:27,034
Doesn't feel like
a miracle though.

937
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:30,081
Alex, I'm so sorry.
If I'd known, I-

938
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:32,344
No. How could you?

939
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:34,694
I keep to myself.

940
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:36,696
I was in the hospital for
a while with a head injury,

941
00:48:36,783 --> 00:48:38,611
and then it was just me.

942
00:48:47,272 --> 00:48:48,055
No...

944

Nobody, no.

945

But that's okay.

946
00:48:55,889 --> 00:48:58,761

Do you miss them?

951
00:49:13,341 --> 00:49:14,473
My Dad was...

952
00:49:15,648 --> 00:49:16,475
hard on me.

953
00:49:17,693 --> 00:49:19,652
He was very successful.

954

Difficult shoes to fill.

955
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:23,656

I get that.

959
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,403
My dad was similar.

960
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:34,449
My brothers in the military too.

961
00:49:34,536 --> 00:49:37,148
It was kind of expected.

962
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:38,323
But with me...

I could do no wrong.

967
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,987
Yeah, I put up with
a lot of crap from him.

968
00:49:50,074 --> 00:49:51,249
I think he was a little
jealous of my Mom

969
00:49:51,336 --> 00:49:54,121
'cause she owned
her own company.

I suppose that's why I am
the way I am. I just...

01:07:48,238 --> 01:07:50,153
What's that?

1280
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:50,762
Stop him.

1281
01:07:52,677 --> 01:07:55,288
Before he ruins your life.

1282
01:07:55,419 --> 01:07:57,769
[tense music]

1283
01:08:41,508 --> 01:08:43,249
Missed you this weekend.

1284
01:08:43,336 --> 01:08:44,598
Alex.

1285
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:46,252
Alex Preston, right?

1286
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:52,432
What do you mean?

1287
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:57,133
I'm just going to rip
the bandaid off here.

1288
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,786
Your real name is Alex Dales.

1289
01:08:58,873 --> 01:09:00,353
[Alex grumbles]

1290
01:09:00,484 --> 01:09:01,920
You didn't graduate from
Eastwood University.

1291
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:04,705
You tried and came close, but
your grades weren't up to par.

1292
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:07,230
Your senior year you got
kicked out after an internship

1293
01:09:07,317 --> 01:09:09,493
with the registrar's
office manager.

1294
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,843
They complained about
inappropriate behavior.

1295
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:13,845
She said you were stalking her.

1296
01:09:13,975 --> 01:09:15,020
After that, you made
your way to a company

1297
01:09:15,107 --> 01:09:17,283
a few hours away from here.

1298
01:09:17,414 --> 01:09:20,199
Answered an online internship
ad, forged transcripts,

1299
01:09:20,286 --> 01:09:21,766
something that you
probably learned

1300
01:09:21,896 --> 01:09:25,161
at the registrar's office
during your internship there.

1301
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:28,164
At first you were
a model intern.

1302
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:29,643
Until some inappropriate
behavior surfaced

1303
01:09:29,774 --> 01:09:31,167
towards your manager.

1304
01:09:31,254 --> 01:09:32,124
A female manager.

1305
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:33,212
She came on to me.

1306
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:34,431
I talked to her Alex.

1307
01:09:34,518 --> 01:09:37,042
[tense music]

1308
01:09:39,697 --> 01:09:40,741
You did what?

1309
01:09:40,872 --> 01:09:43,222
I talked to her.

1310
01:09:43,309 --> 01:09:45,877
We had a candid discussion.

1311
01:09:45,964 --> 01:09:48,793
I also called the
Army Reserves office.

1312
01:09:48,923 --> 01:09:52,492
You were dishonorably
discharged a few months in.

1313
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:54,538
Mental health concerns.

1314
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:57,323
Inappropriate behavior towards
a female Lieutenant Colonel.

1315
01:09:57,454 --> 01:09:59,064
Threatened blackmail.

1316
01:09:59,151 --> 01:10:00,152
Conduct unbecoming.

1317
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:01,588
Maya-

1318
01:10:01,675 --> 01:10:02,676
Was that your next
step with me, Alex?

1319
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:04,374
Blackmail? Extortion?

1320
01:10:08,378 --> 01:10:09,857
It doesn't have
to be this way.

1321
01:10:09,944 --> 01:10:11,946
Let me tell you how
it is going to be.

1322
01:10:12,033 --> 01:10:14,949
You're going to go back to the
office and gather your things.

1323
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,777
Then you're going to
leave and never come back.

1324
01:10:16,908 --> 01:10:18,214
Do you understand?

1325
01:10:19,693 --> 01:10:22,174
It's important that
I hear you say it.

1326
01:10:22,305 --> 01:10:25,395
[emotional piano music]

1327
01:10:36,188 --> 01:10:41,237
I understand.

1328
01:10:53,988 --> 01:10:57,253
[chatter on police radio]

1329
01:11:11,702 --> 01:11:15,096
[tense music]

1330
01:11:15,227 --> 01:11:17,011
His M.O. is pretty consistent.

1331
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:19,187
He latches onto a
female authority figure.

1332
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:20,101
Someone that's...

1333
01:11:20,188 --> 01:11:22,234
Successful.

1334
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:23,453
Yeah.

1335
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:27,326
He showcases obsessive
compulsive behavior.

1336
01:11:27,413 --> 01:11:30,547
Did he ever make any
advances towards you?

1337
01:11:30,634 --> 01:11:31,852
No.

1338
01:11:31,983 --> 01:11:33,289
Nothing like that.

1339
01:11:33,419 --> 01:11:36,117
Just calls and strange behavior.

1340
01:11:39,469 --> 01:11:41,209
I am so sorry.

1341
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,472
I can't believe he
would do this to you.

1342
01:11:42,602 --> 01:11:44,822
Listen to me,
okay? It wasn't you.

1343
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:46,476
It was him.

1344
01:11:46,606 --> 01:11:48,652
You didn't do anything wrong.

1345
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:50,915
[tense music]

1346
01:11:51,045 --> 01:11:51,742
[chatter on police radio]

1347
01:11:51,872 --> 01:11:54,310
[camera clicks]

[relaxing piano music]

1349
01:12:13,459 --> 01:12:15,243
I'm glad you showed
up at the gallery.

1350
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,506
It had been over a month.

1351
01:12:16,593 --> 01:12:18,246
I was starting to get
worried about you.

1352
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,422
You quit drinking
coffee or something?

1353
01:12:19,509 --> 01:12:20,292
[Maya laughs]

1354
01:12:20,379 --> 01:12:21,511
No.

1355
01:12:21,598 --> 01:12:24,252
It's just been a busy month.

1356
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,777
Well, I was happy to see you.

1357
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:27,647
Me too.

1358
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:31,390
I'm sorry if I'm
a little nervous.

1359
01:12:31,477 --> 01:12:35,351
This is my actually my first
date since the divorce,

1360
01:12:35,438 --> 01:12:38,441
which has been a few
years, if you can imagine.

1361
01:12:38,571 --> 01:12:40,704
Ever been married?

1362
01:12:40,791 --> 01:12:44,142
[clears throat]

1363
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:46,274
Can we make a deal?

1364
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,058
Sure.

1365
01:12:48,494 --> 01:12:51,192
Let's not share
our lonely stories.

1366
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:52,237
Is that okay?

1367
01:12:53,586 --> 01:12:54,848
That's perfect.

1368
01:12:56,197 --> 01:12:57,373
So...

1369
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:00,288
Tell me about your job.

1370
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,594
[tense music]

1371
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:04,380
Unless you want to
remain a mystery.

1372
01:13:11,256 --> 01:13:12,257
Everything okay?

1373
01:13:15,173 --> 01:13:16,653
Sorry. Yes.

1374
01:13:16,783 --> 01:13:18,350
I'm fine.

1375
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:21,179
Looked like you saw a
ghost there for a second.

1376
01:13:21,266 --> 01:13:22,223
Maybe.

1377
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:32,233
[mysterious electronic music]

[phone chimes]

1379
01:13:42,505 --> 01:13:44,463
Emma friended me.

1380
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,204
Consider yourself lucky.

1381
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:47,988
Emma and I are close,
but she does not want

1382
01:13:48,075 --> 01:13:50,164
to share social media
with her mother.

1383
01:13:50,295 --> 01:13:51,122
[chuckles]

1384
01:13:51,209 --> 01:13:52,471
I can't wait to see her.

1385
01:13:52,558 --> 01:13:54,299
Says she has a big surprise.

1386
01:13:54,386 --> 01:13:55,735
I think she aced her exams.

1387
01:13:55,822 --> 01:13:57,824
She's a smart girl.

1388
01:13:57,911 --> 01:13:59,260
[Maya] You ready
for a takeout feast?

1389
01:13:59,347 --> 01:14:01,262
I can't wait! Thank
you for inviting me.

1390
01:14:01,393 --> 01:14:03,308
I just might be a little late.

1391
01:14:03,395 --> 01:14:05,179
My boss is horrible.

1392
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:06,093

1393
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:09,140
[cheerful guitar music]

[screaming with joy]

1396
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:28,333
I missed you so much!

1397
01:14:29,421 --> 01:14:31,162
Oh, I missed you too!

1398
01:14:34,165 --> 01:14:36,297
Hey, Ben.
Emma!

1399
01:14:36,384 --> 01:14:38,299
It is so great to
see you in person.

1400
01:14:38,386 --> 01:14:40,432
I mean, those Zoom
calls are great and all.

1401
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:41,781
Where are your bags?

1402
01:14:41,912 --> 01:14:43,522
Okay, don't be mad.

1403
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:46,743
So I said I had a
big surprise, right?

1404
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:47,570
[laughs]

1405
01:14:47,657 --> 01:14:48,832
Hey, babe!

1406
01:14:48,919 --> 01:14:50,181
[tense music]

1407
01:14:50,268 --> 01:14:51,487
Mom, this is Andrew.

1408
01:14:51,574 --> 01:14:53,358
Andrew, this is my Mom.

[typing on phone]

1412
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:10,201
We've been seeing each
other for a while actually.

1413
01:15:10,288 --> 01:15:11,637
I just didn't want you to think

1414
01:15:11,724 --> 01:15:13,770
I was distracted from
school or anything.

1415
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:17,382
Far from it actually.
I aced all of my exams.

1416
01:15:20,124 --> 01:15:21,038
Mom?

1417
01:15:22,779 --> 01:15:24,520
Oh, sorry. That's...

1418
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:27,044
amazing.

1419
01:15:27,131 --> 01:15:28,524
That's great, Emma.

1420
01:15:28,654 --> 01:15:30,482
Why don't we set another
spot at the table.

1421
01:15:30,569 --> 01:15:31,439
Yeah.
No problem.

1422
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:32,397
I'll help.

1423
01:15:33,572 --> 01:15:34,355
Be nice.

1424
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,186

[suspenseful music]

1426
01:15:57,683 --> 01:15:59,685
Please don't hurt them.

1427
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:09,042
That's entirely
up to you, Maya.

1428
01:16:12,698 --> 01:16:14,744
Okay. So what's for dinner?

1429
01:16:16,093 --> 01:16:18,269
[laughing]

1430
01:16:20,314 --> 01:16:23,317
So, Andrew, Emma says you're
starting a new internship.

1431
01:16:23,404 --> 01:16:25,537
Yes, at Health Ridge Hospital.

1432
01:16:25,624 --> 01:16:28,409
They have locations border
to border, coast to coast.

1433
01:16:28,496 --> 01:16:29,541
They're even expanding to-

1434
01:16:29,628 --> 01:16:30,760
Europe and Asia?

1435
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,326
[uneasy music]

1436
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:34,633
Yeah, that's right.
How did you know?

1437
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,070
Maya's company provides
software for them.

1438
01:16:37,157 --> 01:16:38,463
Small world, huh?

1439
01:16:40,117 --> 01:16:41,118
Too small.

1440
01:16:41,205 --> 01:16:42,467
Oh my gosh!

1441
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,339
How did I never put
two and two together?

1442
01:16:45,426 --> 01:16:48,342
Maybe you guys will get
to work together sometime.

1443
01:16:48,473 --> 01:16:49,300
That'd be cool.

1444
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:50,606
[phone beeps]

1445
01:16:50,693 --> 01:16:51,519
[phone ringing]

1446
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:54,087
Come on, Maya. Pick up.

1447
01:16:54,174 --> 01:16:55,262
[phone buzzing]

1448
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:57,090
So, Mrs. Taylor...

1449
01:16:57,221 --> 01:16:58,614
Or, sorry, is it...

1450
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:02,748
[phone buzzing]

1451
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:05,272
Do you need to get that?

1452
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:07,623
[tense music]

1453
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:15,152
No.

1454
01:17:16,327 --> 01:17:17,458
It's probably Kate.

1455
01:17:17,545 --> 01:17:20,113
She said she was running late.

1456
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:23,508
So is it Mrs. Taylor or...

1457
01:17:23,595 --> 01:17:25,336
You can call me Maya.

1458
01:17:26,337 --> 01:17:27,120
Maya.

1459
01:17:28,992 --> 01:17:32,343
The software Ben
is talking about...

1460
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:35,041
it's Newmark, right?

1461
01:17:35,128 --> 01:17:36,173
Amazing stuff.

1462
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,264
Thank you.

1463
01:17:40,351 --> 01:17:41,874
Must have taken a lot of work

1464
01:17:41,961 --> 01:17:45,530
to get connected with a
hospital chain like that.

1465
01:17:47,401 --> 01:17:49,490
[anxious music]

1466
01:17:49,577 --> 01:17:51,188
Mom? Are you okay?

1467
01:17:55,105 --> 01:17:57,847
Yeah, you don't look so
good. It's not the food, is it?

1468
01:17:57,934 --> 01:18:00,023
[Emma] Mom, what's wrong?

1469
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:08,509
M?

1470
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,821
I was hoping you'd
play along, Maya.

1471
01:18:15,908 --> 01:18:19,172
I've been waiting
for this a long time.

1472
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:23,699
You're Alex.

1473
01:18:25,265 --> 01:18:28,051
[unsettling music]

1474
01:18:29,748 --> 01:18:30,531
What?

1475
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:34,057
Please don't.

1476
01:18:35,536 --> 01:18:38,278
No, no, no! That's far enough!

1477
01:18:38,365 --> 01:18:41,412
Andrew! What are you doing?

1478
01:18:41,542 --> 01:18:44,067
[tense music]

1479
01:18:44,154 --> 01:18:45,546
Sorry, babe.

1480
01:18:45,633 --> 01:18:47,113
It's been great though.

1481
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,071
Oh, and...

1482
01:18:51,204 --> 01:18:51,727
it's Alex.

1483
01:18:55,252 --> 01:18:56,079
Oh, oh.

1484
01:18:58,255 --> 01:18:59,212
Don't worry.

1485
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,086
Emma's not really not my type.

1486
01:19:04,304 --> 01:19:05,436
A little young.

1487
01:19:06,959 --> 01:19:08,265
We never really...

1488
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,180
You know.

1489
01:19:10,267 --> 01:19:11,050
Enough!

1490
01:19:12,182 --> 01:19:13,226
What do you want?

1491
01:19:13,313 --> 01:19:16,099
Quiet!
[Emma gasps]

1492
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,321
All I want is answers.

1493
01:19:21,452 --> 01:19:24,107
[phone buzzing]

[Dispatcher] 911.

1498
01:19:41,254 --> 01:19:42,386
911?

1499
01:19:42,516 --> 01:19:47,695
I have an emergency.

1500
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:48,566
What answers do you want?

1501
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:49,654
I want to know why!

1502
01:19:50,829 --> 01:19:51,656
Why not me?

1503
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,180
Why him?

1504
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:56,443
[tense music]

1505
01:19:56,574 --> 01:19:57,140
What are you talking about?

1506
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:58,054
I said...

1507
01:19:59,272 --> 01:20:00,056
quiet!

1508
01:20:05,713 --> 01:20:06,497
Oh.

1509
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:10,588
You never told him...

1510
01:20:11,676 --> 01:20:13,156
the whole story.

1511
01:20:15,593 --> 01:20:16,855
Please stop.

1512
01:20:16,942 --> 01:20:19,336
[tense music]

1513
01:20:21,164 --> 01:20:21,773
Or her.

1514
01:20:25,124 --> 01:20:25,690
Mom?

1515
01:20:29,389 --> 01:20:31,348
Why are you doing this?

1516
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,833
Your girlfriend
slept with her intern.

1517
01:20:44,578 --> 01:20:46,537
She didn't tell you that.

1518
01:20:48,495 --> 01:20:50,497
No, she didn't tell
her best friend that.

1519
01:20:50,628 --> 01:20:53,718
She didn't tell her daughter.

1520
01:20:53,805 --> 01:20:54,501
I'm so sorry.

1521
01:20:54,588 --> 01:20:56,025
No, no, no!

1522
01:20:56,112 --> 01:20:57,330
You should be apologizing
to me, not them.

1523
01:20:57,417 --> 01:20:58,462
Me!

1524
01:20:58,549 --> 01:21:00,638
Why? Why should I-
No!

1525
01:21:00,725 --> 01:21:02,205
It was one night.

1526
01:21:03,641 --> 01:21:05,208
We were celebrating.

1527
01:21:06,513 --> 01:21:08,559
I was lonely. It was stupid.

1528
01:21:11,388 --> 01:21:13,390
You tried to kill Kate.

1529
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,653
You tried to kill her. Why?

1530
01:21:15,783 --> 01:21:18,047
Over some stupid internship?

1531
01:21:22,616 --> 01:21:24,227
Because I love you.

1532
01:21:25,532 --> 01:21:27,273
Love?

1533
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,753
You don't know what love is.

1534
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:29,580
You don't.

1535
01:21:30,973 --> 01:21:33,366
You're just some
confused, messed up kid.

1536
01:21:33,497 --> 01:21:34,802
I'm sorry your parents died.

1537
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,326
No! Don't talk about them.

1538
01:21:36,413 --> 01:21:36,979
[Maya] I'm sure
they loved you.

1539
01:21:37,066 --> 01:21:38,589
Don't talk about them!

1540
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:45,074
Love me?

1541
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:48,251
My father never did.

1542
01:21:50,775 --> 01:21:54,039
He saw nothing but flaws in me.

1543
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:57,477
I was either too stupid
or too disorganized.

1544
01:21:57,608 --> 01:22:00,567
Nothing was ever
good enough. Nothing!

1545
01:22:00,654 --> 01:22:01,786
He was ashamed.

1546
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,485
The day of the accident...

1547
01:22:05,616 --> 01:22:06,269
I snapped.

1548
01:22:08,358 --> 01:22:11,883
I grabbed the steering
wheel, and we flipped.

1549
01:22:12,014 --> 01:22:15,104
I went out the window and
I landed in some bushes.

1550
01:22:15,191 --> 01:22:16,540
When I came to...

1551
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:22,111
she was gone.

1552
01:22:23,808 --> 01:22:24,461
My Mom.

1553
01:22:26,463 --> 01:22:28,117
The seatbelt snapped.

1554
01:22:29,422 --> 01:22:31,120
She was laying in a...

1555
01:22:32,773 --> 01:22:33,470
Broken.

1556
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:36,821
Covered in blood.

1557
01:22:36,908 --> 01:22:38,127
30 feet away.

1558
01:22:39,476 --> 01:22:40,129
But him...

1559
01:22:42,696 --> 01:22:43,654
He was fine.

1560
01:22:45,264 --> 01:22:46,135
Hurt but fine!

1561
01:22:48,006 --> 01:22:50,748
The airbag saved
him. Not her, him!

1562
01:22:55,231 --> 01:22:55,666
So I...

1563
01:22:59,626 --> 01:23:00,671
I finished it.

1564
01:23:02,716 --> 01:23:03,630
I finished him.

1565
01:23:03,717 --> 01:23:05,589
[tense music]

1566
01:23:05,676 --> 01:23:08,157
With a tire iron from the trunk.

1567
01:23:10,202 --> 01:23:10,768
Alex...

Stop!

Alex, no.

1575
01:23:36,272 --> 01:23:37,882
This isn't about her.

1576
01:23:38,926 --> 01:23:41,146
[Emma crying]

1577
01:23:41,277 --> 01:23:42,017
No.

1578
01:23:43,453 --> 01:23:45,585
This is about you.

1579
01:23:45,672 --> 01:23:47,718
It's always been about you.

1580
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,374
All you had to do was love me.

1581
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:54,116
Like she did.

1582
01:23:54,246 --> 01:23:54,725
My mom.

1583
01:23:56,814 --> 01:23:59,599
All I wanted was for her...

1584
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:00,600
for you...

1585
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:02,254
to love me.

1586
01:24:02,341 --> 01:24:03,647
She loved you, Alex.

1587
01:24:03,734 --> 01:24:04,952
She did.

1588
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,216
Until she died because of me.

1589
01:24:09,392 --> 01:24:11,698
I just wanted to succeed.

1590
01:24:11,785 --> 01:24:14,353
I just wanted you
to succeed too.

1591
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:17,269
Like she did in whatever
thing she tried to do.

1592
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,140
I know.

1593
01:24:18,227 --> 01:24:20,055
I get that now. I do.

1594
01:24:21,317 --> 01:24:23,406
You're an amazing worker.

1595
01:24:24,885 --> 01:24:28,759
And I know that your mom
thought you were amazing too.

1596
01:24:28,846 --> 01:24:31,196
[tense music]

1597
01:24:31,283 --> 01:24:32,284

You're lying again, aren't you?

1600

Alex, no!

1601
01:24:36,288 --> 01:24:38,551
This has nothing to do with her!

1602
01:24:38,682 --> 01:24:41,119
Everything I
did, I did for you!

1603
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:43,165
All that work.

1604
01:24:43,295 --> 01:24:44,253
That jerk, Frank.

1605
01:24:46,864 --> 01:24:48,561
That was you?

1606
01:24:48,648 --> 01:24:49,432
Yes!

1607
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:52,087
I did it for you!

1608
01:24:53,349 --> 01:24:56,265
Everything I did, I
did for you, for us!

1609
01:24:57,744 --> 01:25:00,356
I need you to
realize that, Maya.

1610
01:25:00,443 --> 01:25:02,271
I'm not a bad person.

1611
01:25:03,663 --> 01:25:07,319
I'm not a bad person! I
need to hear you say it!

1612
01:25:07,406 --> 01:25:08,103
How could I?

1613
01:25:09,191 --> 01:25:11,454
Look at yourself.

1614
01:25:11,584 --> 01:25:14,283
You're nothing but
a disappointment.

1615

To a new beginning.

For us all.

1629
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:19,348
Yeah.

1630
01:26:19,435 --> 01:26:20,740
And I know I've said
these a thousand times

1631
01:26:20,871 --> 01:26:21,828
these past few days.

1632
01:26:21,915 --> 01:26:23,874
I promise I will never-
Hey.

1633
01:26:24,004 --> 01:26:26,877
Let's not tell our
sad stories. Deal?

1634
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,707
Deal.

1635
01:26:30,837 --> 01:26:31,534
Deal!
