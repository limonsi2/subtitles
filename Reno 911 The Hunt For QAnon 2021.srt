Ah, shit! Ah!

Hey! Hey, somebody!

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,568
Call the fire department.
Get the car.

13
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,804
We're gonna have to call
air traffic control.

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,041
- I don't see him.
I don't see him.

16
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,243
Ah!
- He's right there.

17
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,811
He looks like Gonzo up there.

18
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,446
- There he is!
There he is!

19
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,047
- Hey!
- Jim!

20
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:48,482
It's Trudy!

21
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,917
Take one of these.

22
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,053
Jim, Jim, this is Trudy Wiegel
on the radio.

23
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:54,722
Over, 192.

24
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,757
- Hey, Trudy. Go for Jim.
- This is Raineesha.

25
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,659
She wants to say something
to you, Jim.

26
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,929
- Dangle, I see your nuts!

27
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,997
- That can't be the first
time, can it, Rai-Rai?

28
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,533
- Jim!

29
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,069
- So I'm still over Nevada
airspace, yes?

30
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:11,339
- You're confirmed
over Nevada airspace, Jim.

31
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,640
If you could just take
a little peeksy

32
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,175
inside my neighbor's backyard,

33
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:16,144
because I think she may
have stolen my weed whacker.

34
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,412
I would much appreciate it.
Over, 10-4, good buddy.

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,182
- Trudy, that's a confirmation
on the weed whacker.

36
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:23,284
It does look like it is
in your neighbor's yard.

37
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:25,519
Is there--not that you guys
aren't being helpful,

38
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,954
is there anyone on the ground

39
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,422
who could give me ground
support, do you think?

40
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:29,957
- Um...

41
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,961
- He's heading toward
the Bowling Hall of Fame, Clem.

42
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,729
You got to head him off.

43
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,698
- Yeah, I'm all over it.
I got eyes on him right now.

44
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,768
I'm chasing him at 90 miles
an hour down 395. Stand by.

45
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,037
I don't fucking care.

46
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,440
- He keeps going like this,

47
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,108
pretty soon he'll be out
of our jurisdiction.

48
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:49,843
- We'll see about that.

49
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,180
- Hey, guys, and good news.
I found my Go-Gurt.

51

00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,150
What?

00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:57,718
[gunshots]

54
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:58,952
They're shooting at me!

55
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,054
- But they're not hitting
anything.

56
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,723
[gunshots]
- Damn it!

57
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,092

Ah, shit.

00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,634
Ah! Oh!

63
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,869

- Don't worry, guys.

[bicycle bell dings]
all: Oh!

70
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,860

I don't have a spine anymore!

74
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,839
- These last few years have
been a nightmare to be a cop.

75
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,541
You're walking on eggshells,

76
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,476
and it's twice as bad
for someone like me.

77
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:57,144
Maybe, like,
a hundred times as bad,

78
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,979
because I hate everybody.

79
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:02,015
I literally
can't stand humanity.

80
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:05,719
So for me, I got to get over
hating everybody,

81
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:08,689
or my individual hatreds
come off like prejudice.

82
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:11,158
I'm a good guy.
I treat everybody the same.

83
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,593
I fucking hate them.

84
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,995
- It's been a bad year
for cops, man.

85
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,831
Between the Antifa/
Black Lives Matter guys

86
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,500
that have been trying
to defund us

87
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:23,771
and the Blue Lives Matter crowd
that actively tried to kill us,

88
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:26,774
I should have been a fucking
garbageman like Dad said.

89
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,709
- To be honest,
I thought I was gonna skate--

90
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:30,544
skate by, 'cause,
you know, I'm...

91
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,147
I'm the hip-hop cop,
you know?

92
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,215
People like me.

93
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:38,051
But it turns out they, uh...

94
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,520
they lumped me in.

95
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,655
They lumped me in,
and they hate me too.

96
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,358
- Good morning, gang.

97
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,559
- Mm.
- I hate it here.

98
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:46,527
- Good morning.

99
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,829
- [sighs]

100
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,636
[exhales]

101
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,572
I know it's been
a rough couple of years.

102
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,341
- Suck a dick, asshole.

103
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,476
- You're absolutely allowed
to vent like that.

104
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:06,079
Declan, the next time you feel
that rage, and I know--

105
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,115
Are you on the--
you're on your meds, yeah?

106
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,517
- Yeah.
- What are they giving you?

107
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,851
- LSD.

108
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,953
Everything's fuzzy
on the edges and drips.

109
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,455
- That's okay.

110
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:16,557
But you're not thinking
about hurting anybody, right?

111
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,225
- Oh, yeah. All the time.

112
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,561
Whatever Dr. Migifingers
has prescribed to you

113
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,530
to get through
this trying time,

114
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,864
stick with that.

115
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,866
- Why can't we all
just get along, guys?

116
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,701
Right?
- How come she's doing okay?

117
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,837
I don't get it.
She was the most fucked-up one

118
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,805
out of all of us,
and somehow she's doing okay.

119
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,707
[alarm chimes]
- [exhales]

120
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,010
- Sorry, that was
my medication alarm.

121
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,582
- Holy shit.
- That's quite a selection.

122
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:45,686
- White wakes me up,
blue calms me down.

123
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:50,257
Orange keeps the demons
from dancing all around.

124
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,092
And then this blue one

125
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,561
is so I don't get
bloating and gas,

126
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,363
and that I don't
shit my pants.

127
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:56,697
- What is going on?

128
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,065
- How do I get me
some of that?

129
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,900
- You just call the lady
and say,

130
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,470
"I'm thinking about
harming myself and others."

131
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,171
You have to say "and,"
not "or."

132
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,674
- Oh, you said "and others."
- And others. That's it.

133
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,275
It's the "and others."

134
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,711
Uh, in other news,
everybody knows Pizza Midget.

135
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,113
- Oh, yeah, they got them
little midget pizzas.

136
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,549
- Yeah, um, so apparently
this Q...

137
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,151
or QAnon,
whatever that is,

138
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:21,622
has been, uh, saying defamatory
things about them

139
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:22,856
on their message boards
and such.

140
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,592
- Pedophile ring
in the basement.

141
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,627
- That's what they said,
but to my knowledge,

142
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:28,529
there is not a pedophile ring
in the basement.

143
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:29,730
- No.
- Do they have a basement?

144
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,198
- They don't even
have a basement.

145
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,800
- No, they don't even
have a pinball machine.

146
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,267
- So that explains
this document.

147
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,538
So what's happening is
Pizza Midget

148
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:40,574
is suing Q

149
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:41,975
for libel.

150
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,612
And we need to--
- Like "QAnon" Q?

151
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,680
- Yes. The actual Q.

152
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,517
We need to put this in the hand

153
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,251
and serve Q.

154
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,454
- How are we supposed
to find Q?

155
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:56,156
The whole thing about Q
is that nobody knows where Q is.

156
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,191
- Does nobody know--
- That's the whole thing.

157
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,427
- Is Q even a person?

158
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:00,694
- We got to put it in the trunk

159
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,195
of Mr. "Snuffleufagus."

160
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,398
- All right, wait,
are you saying "Snuffleufagus"

161
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,833
or "-upagus"?

162
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,267
- "-Ufagus."
- Uh-uh.

163
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,969
- Is it "-upagus"?
- It's "-upagus."

164
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,871
- Oh, my God, dude,
don't get into this again.

165
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:13,240
- I got to get into it.
I have to get into it.

166
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,108
Om break!

167
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,278
all chanting: Om.

168
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:19,580
- It's "-upagus."

169
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,482
[guitar strums]

170
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:24,818
- Click on that article
about the Hollywood cabal...

171
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,054
- There it is.
- See if there's something like,

172
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,321
"If you want to contact Q,
click here."

173
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,357
- Contact Q.
- Look at all them people

174
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,092
they said is pedophiles.

175
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,527
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

176
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,128
- Tom Hanks?
- Yeah.

177
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,197
- I mean, those are some
ugly-looking white people.

178
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:40,233
- Steven Spielberg
has actual horns?

179
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,935
Oh, click on the pillow guy.
The pillow guy.

180
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,004
- [overlapped chatter]
- Oh, the pillow guy!

181
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,639
- There's so many
I could click on, guys.

182
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,508
- Hey, look at that.
- Okay.

183
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,242
- Q's Booze Cruise.

184
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:50,678
They're having a convention
on a boat.

185
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,079
- They're actually having--yes.

186
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,182
"Leaving from Panama, Florida,
to Nassau.

187
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,918
Fun events, lectures,
get together with QAnon..."

188
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:58,986
- I will volunteer.
- I'm dialing the number.

189
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,420
I'm dialing. I'm dialing.
- I'm in.

190
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:01,789
- I will volunteer to do this.
- I want to do this.

191
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,190
- Nobody sound like a cop!

192
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,692
- Uh, yeah, hi.

193
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,827
Um, I saw your--
the ad for, uh, the--

194
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,696
the Q's Booze Cruise.
- Hey, honey!

195
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,997
Are you on the phone?

196
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,231
- [in high-pitched voice]
Yes, Daddy.

197
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,833
- Sorry, I have many,
many children

198
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,335
who need my attention.

199
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,904
- Daddy, I'm hungry!

200
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,672
- [in Southern accent]
I'm here too, Daddy!

201
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,040
- I have a blended family,

202
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,909
and my children
are always pulling at me

203
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,911
in a million directions.
Ha, ha, ha.

204
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,013
I-I saw the posting
on our amazing--

205
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,783
our amazing Q site
for the Q's Booze Cruise.

206
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,952
Oh, that leaves on--
that leaves on Wednesday.

207
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,922
Uh, is the big guy
gonna be there?

208
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:39,092
Are there nine slots available?

209
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,662
There are?
Great, great, great.

210
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,063
And how much--
how much are those?

211
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,734
Do you have anything
cheaper than that?

212
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,435
You do?

213
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,003
Do you have anything
slightly cheaper than that?

214
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,505
That sounds amazing.

215
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,873
Great. Nine.

216
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,842
- Yes! Yes!
- Where we go one, we go all!

217
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,176
[all cheer]

218
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,645
- * Who let the dogs out? *

219
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,880
* Who, who, who, who? *

220
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,081
* Who let the dogs out? *

221
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,983
* Who, who, who, who? *

222
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,118
* Who let the dogs out? *

223
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,720
* Who, who, who, who? *

224
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:10,724
* Who let the dogs out? *

225
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,092
- Ah. Stop.

226
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,193
[coughs]

227
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,128
- [speaking foreign language]

228
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,163
- Junior Jr.,
please don't paint

229
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,297
the police car, Junior Jr.

230
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,966
- I want to paint
the police car,

231
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,634
and I'm gonna do it anyway!

232
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,803
- I don't mind getting out
of town for a couple of days.

233
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,437
* *

234
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,206
- * Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who? *

235
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:27,741
- [screams]

236
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,577
- * Who let the dogs out? *

237
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,411
* Who, who, who, who? *

238
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,081
* Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who? *

239
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:37,050
- It just goes to show you
that vision-boarding works.

240
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:41,521
And I am gonna land me
a bajillionaire,

241
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,256
because that is what I deserve.

242
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,125
[laughs]

243
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,359
Oh!

244
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,829
- Ah! Freedom!

245
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,463
* *

246
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,699
God, I hate this city.

247
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,366
- What's in the box,
you ask?

248
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,968
[chuckles]

249
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,337
No one asked that.
I just said it rhetorically.

250
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,940
I have some friends
in the box.

251
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,610
Some friends who are my ticket

252
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,979
out of this shithole.

253
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,615
- Sitting for paying
customer only.

254
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,850
- I am going to buy something!

255
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,952
- * Who let the dogs out? *

256
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,954
* Who, who, who, who? *

257
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,823
* Who let the dogs out? *

258
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,090
* Who, who, who, who? *

259
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,792
- My old friend, the sea.

260
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,560
Mic check. Mic check.

261
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,162
This is Johnny Tremain.

262
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,698
- * Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who? *

263
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,800
* Who let the dogs out? *

264
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,869
* Who, who, who, who? *

265
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,704
* Who let the dogs out? *

266
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,339
* Who, who, who, who? *

267
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,241
* Who let the dogs out? *

268
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,810
* Who, who, who, who? *

269
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,812
- Welcome to Q's Booze Cruise.

270
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,881
Where we go one,
we go all...

271
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:43,817
to shuffleboard, on Deck 3.

272
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:46,219
- Thank you,
and have a patriotic day.

273
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,689
Don't forget
to own the libs.

274
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:49,857
- Oh, hi.

279
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,801
- Oh.

280
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:02,535
- Ooh, a double-platinum
elegance package.

281
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,071
- That's us. That's us.
- Love it.

Disgruntled laborer.

Q's Booze Cruise.

291
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:25,158
- You know,
I'm here as an individual.

292
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,260
I'm not part of his, uh, part...

293
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,797
- It doesn't matter.
- Just a solo person.

294
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:30,898
Everybody's giving me
backstory today.

295
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,132
- I'm single.
- Uh-huh.

296
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:34,735
[light music]

297
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,704
- [laughs]

298
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,072
Mahalo.

299
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,675
"My hollow" stomach's
gonna be filled with buffet!

300
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,310
[laughter]

301
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,512
- I don't get that.
I don't get that at all.

302
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,248
- Oh, my God, I'm gonna play--
I'm playing so much of that.

303
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,482
- You can't.
It says you're not allowed.

304
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,284
- Oh, it's closed.
Oh, look at that.

305
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,886
Anybody got a 5
to give the lady--

306
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,487
Cute lady bellhops,
We give them a 5?

307
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,123
- I didn't bring any money.
- Hi, how are you? Hi.

308
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,324
- Stop.
- Oh! Oh, my God.

309
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,827
- Before you come on the boat...
- Uh-huh.

310
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,194
- We have to do health.
- Yeah.

311
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,696
- We have to do waiver, okay?
- Uh-huh.

312
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,197
Don't read. Just sign.

313
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,699
- Do not read.
- Initial. Initial. Sign.

314
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:08,501
- You have to sign a waiver
to eat at the buffet?

315
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,470
- Please be quiet.
I'm doing demonstration, okay?

316
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,638
- Please be quiet, guys.

317
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,140
- Ah. Ah. Ah.

318
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:16,944
- [screaming]

319
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,445
- We take temperature bottom.
- Okay.

320
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,380
- Oh, right there?
- From the back. Now bend over.

321
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,149
He's okay. He's okay.
- Is it okay? Oh, great.

322
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,417
See? Guys, this is so stupid,
it's easy.

323
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:27,254
- I have to check
your genital, okay?

324
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,189
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
You just got to check that?

325
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,624
- No, open more, okay?
I'm looking.

326
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,161
- Right after this, we get to go
on the stuff and everything?

327
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,763
Right up--
- No. Shh!

328
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,330
Next!
- Okay, I'm done.

329
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,632
- Maybe--excuse me,
if I could make a suggestion.

330
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,836
If the rest of the guys could
just all get your penises out,

331
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,038
then they're ready for her,
so then we can move it along...

332
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,539
- That's a great idea.
[applause]

333
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:49,476
- I don't want to take
my penis out.

334
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,711
- Hello, everyone!

335
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,114
- Oh, hello!
[applause]

336
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,916
- When I say, "hell,"
you say, "lo."

337
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,350
- Hell.
all: Lo!

338
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,651
- Hey!

339
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,587
- I am Captain Bonsoifisse.

340
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,456
And, yes, I am that
Captain Bonsoifisse.

341
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,492
- Oh!
- Hello. Before you wonder,

342
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,427
I have been acquitted.
All good.

343
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,930
Everything is good now.
- Great.

344
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:12,365
- Hola. Bienvenidos.

345
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,936
Hello. Primero Officer Memes
deporting for duty.

346
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:17,370
[laughter]
- That is a joke,

347
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,439
but by the way,
he actually has been deported.

348
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,108
- But we cannot talk about it,
okay?

349
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,844
But welcome. I am so happy
for you to be here.

350
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:27,747
I'm a fun guy, but, uh,
we do have some bad news.

351
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,082
all: Oh.
- Unfortunately.

352
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,584
We are dangerously low on beer.

353
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:32,920
- Oh.
- What?

354
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,022
- We currently have two types
of beer left.

355
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,125
- Okay.
- It is clam-nado hot beer.

356
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,626
- Ooh.
- Okay? It is very hot.

357
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,897
And we also have
a clam lite lime beer.

358
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,532
- What if you're allergic
to clams?

359
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,167
- Good question!
Let's move on!

360
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,937
- Oh, fun. Fun.
This is gonna be great.

361
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,571
- I have something very serious
to talk about now.

362
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,606
- Great.
- A lot of people say

363
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:56,709
the silent killer at sea
is diarrhea.

364
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,045
- Mm.
- Not true.

365
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,815
Diarrhea at sea can be loud.
- Very loud.

366
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,617
- Now, in the next three hours,

367
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,855
I am going to teach you
how to keep your diarrhea

368
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:11,558
down by the minutes using our
handy-dandy diarrhea app.

369
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,226
- Oh, okay, cool.
- With any luck,

370
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,495
we will be able
to keep your diarrhea

371
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,031
down to the first
five faces.

372
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,532
- Okay.
- Is there anything

373
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:23,971
we can specifically avoid
to keep from getting

374
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,638
in the bottom three?
- Yeah.

375
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,574
- I have never seen a cruise
without diarrhea.

376
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,476
- You're gonna get it.
- I don't want to get diarrhea.

377
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,411
- I didn't want to be born
with one leg

378
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,446
slightly shorter than the other,
but I was, and I lived with it,

379
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,315
and look at me now!
Bon!

380
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,384
- Listen, I didn't want to live
with my handsy uncle

381
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,019
when I was nine years old
either,

382
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,688
but I did it
and we got through it.

383
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,957
- Unbelievably depressing.
- [whistle blows]

384
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,125
- Okay, time to go to your room.

385
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:48,661
[excited chatter]

386
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,263
- Sorry. Excuse me.

387
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,832
Hey, Mr. Memes.
Mr. Memes, hey.

388
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,801
I just wanted to ask you,
what are you guys--

389
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,736
how are you guys set
for entertainment on the boat?

390
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,006
- Uh, you know,
we have the karaoke machine.

391
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,473
It's out of order,
but, you know...

392
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,175
- I would love to get
a couple minutes

393
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,044
just to pitch you something...

394
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:05,445
- Okay.
- That I think

395
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,915
could change your life

396
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,950
and save you a small fortune

397
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,351
with your entertainment dollar.

398
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:12,652
- Oh.
- It goes a very long way.

399
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:13,921
- We like to save money
around here.

400
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,222
- I can tell.

401
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,158
[smooth guitar music]

402
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,193
* *

403
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,463
[klaxon blaring]

404
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,701
[hull creaking]

405
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,438
So--
[electricity pops and crackles]

406
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,276
This--

407
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,011
I kind of like it, actually,
down here.

408
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,013
This is executive
double platinum?

409
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,514
- Yes.
- Yeah.

410
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,116
What's below executive
double platinum?

411
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,284
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

412
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,685
- You are lowest.
- Right.

413
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:46,987
This is rustic.

414
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,621
[laughs]
Almost to a fault.

415
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,257
- It's nicer than that place
we had in Loughlin.

416
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,459
- By a lot.
And, uh, yes.

417
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,893
- You know the best part?
- Yeah.

418
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,395
- No windows.
- Mm.

419
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:56,930
- I have a hard time
getting to sleep sometimes,

420
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:59,332
but I feel like there's
so little oxygen in here

421
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,001
that it's gonna be pretty easy
to doze off.

422
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,802
- You want to work.
You want to work a little bit

423
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,171
when you sleep, you know?

424
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,838
- Earn your life.
- Earn your life.

425
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,208
- Earn your life.
- Earn the trip, you know?

426
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,909
- Is that a bat?
Those aren't bats up there?

427
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:11,311
- Oh, yes.
- Those are bats?

428
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,680
- Yes, they come with the room
complimentary.

429
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,448
- Oh, they're moving.
Look, they're moving.

430
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:16,984
They're wiggling around.
- That's beautiful.

431
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,152
- Aw, there's the baby.
- Oh, that's a baby!

432
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:22,222
- Aw!
- They're a family.

433
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,257
Sorry. Excuse me.

434
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,126
Excuse me. Pardon me.

435
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,760
Johnny Tremain has landed.

436
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,496
- Hi.
- Hi!

437
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,231
- I'm gonna need you
to check your guns.

438
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,266
- I'm good, actually.
- Oh...

439
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,801
- No, last Q conference
in Dallas,

440
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,036
there was open carry.

441
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,370
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, 42 people

442
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,239
had catastrophic injuries
at bingo night.

443
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,274
- Oh, well, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

444
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,675
- He has a code he lives by.

445
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,144
Will you just pry it
from his hand?

446
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,912
- Just pry it.
- Okay!

447
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,614
- If you don't pry it,
he can't give it.

448
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,783
- Once you're off the boat,
Second Amendment.

449
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,319
- You're the--
You're the pink hat--

450
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,653
That's you!
- Yeah, that's me.

451
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,888
- You're the lady
from the peaceful protest.

452
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,624
- Yeah.
- Remind me?

453
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,592
- Yeah, she pooped
in Nancy Pelosi's desk

454
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,094
at the big peaceful protest.
- You did not!

455
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,262
- Yeah.
- You're that lady?

456
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:03,230
- Yeah. Remember?
- Look at that.

457
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,198
- Oh, my gosh! Whoa!

458
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:06,833
- You know Charlie Kirk.

459
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,068
- Color me starstruck.

460
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,736
- Wow.
- Holy cow.

461
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,471
- Would you like to buy
a copy of my book?

462
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,540
- You wrote a long book.
- Yes, please. How much is it?

463
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:17,510
Well, they're $9.99,
but $49.99 if I autograph it.

464
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,512
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.

465
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,081
- We'll just look at it.

466
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,482
- We're gonna look at it and
remember it was really great.

467
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:23,483
- Well, think about it.
- Thank you very much.

468
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,684
This was great.

469
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:25,652
I'm sure there's tons
of big stars

470
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,886
that we're gonna meet, so...

471
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,421
- I mean, I heard--

472
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,922
I heard Q was here.

473
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,391
- So where's his book table?

474
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,360
Or her book--
their book table?

475
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,827
- The Q.
- Do--do we--

476
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,329
do you recognize him?

477
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,298
Here?

478
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,167
- Okay, I don't know who he is.
- Mm-hmm.

479
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,435
- But I-I know he's handsome.

480
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,437
I know he's white,
but that's all I know.

481
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,006
- Well, we all assume.
- Oh, my God.

482
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:48,441
- What?

483
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,409
- Are those the Black Lives
Don't Matter people

484
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,810
with the little tiny guns?

485
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,479
- I want a picture!
I got to get a picture!

486
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,414
- Got to go. Got to go.
- Have a good conference.

487
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:55,848
- It was nice meeting you!
- Thank you.

488
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,551
Oh. Oh, thank you.

489
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:03,856
- Hey.

490
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:07,860
[whispers]
Fan out. Reconnaissance.

491
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,930
Don't do anything to draw
extra attention to us, okay?

492
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,066
- No.

493
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,268
- Fan out. Recon mode.

494
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,869
Can you hear me?

495
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,238
Tremain to Chet.

496
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,039
Trudy.
- Yes?

497
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,775
- What's with the dress?

498
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,011
- It's part of our backstory.
- Oh, good.

499
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,180
- You and I...

500
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:28,681
we're a couple.
- Yeah.

501
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,650
- You...

502
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,752
are a 79-year-old Presbyterian

503
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,987
who owns an auto parts
dealership in Fresno

504
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,257
that you bought with your dead
grandma's money.

505
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:43,330
I am a 29-year-old trophy wife
who has a keen eye for fashion

506
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:47,200
and a masters degree
in birds and things.

507
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,436
I...

508
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,803
have one flaw,

509
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,739
and it's that sometimes
I'm a little too nice.

510
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:56,042
Our neighbor Rodrigo
has three dogs.

511
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,310
One of them is missing.

512
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,645
We think the nephew took him.

513
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,547
I think he may have
eaten him.

514
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,049
If you panic,
squeeze my hand 11 times

515
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,218
and we will start making out,
got it?

516
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,453
- Okay.

517
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,787
Trudy?
- Hmm?

518
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:11,491
You still didn't
explain the dress.

519
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,693
- Oh, I never got
to that part in the story.

520
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,027
I think I'm wearing
the wrong outfit.

521
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,296
- It's okay.

522
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:19,399
- Hello, um, strange...

523
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,633
people.

524
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,803
- And the deep state's really,
really...

525
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,673
doing--but--getting us hard.
- This is my husband.

526
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,074
Our neighbor's name
is Rodrigo.

527
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,642
- Don't do the whole thing.
- He has three dogs,

528
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,043
but one of them is missing.

529
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,145
- That's Raineesha.
It's Raineesha.

530
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,280
- It's a horrible story.

531
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,714
- You recognize Raineesha,
right?

532
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,649
- I didn't at first,
I got to be honest.

533
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,818
- I didn't think you did.
- Those are very distracting.

534
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:41,321
You should put them away.
- Nice meeting you, Coco.

535
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:43,122
- So nice to meet y'all too.

536
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,592
A beautiful QAnon couple.

537
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,294
- You should see him
with his pants off.

538
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,164
[all laugh]

539
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:53,766
- Hollywood's full of vampires.
Nothing but vampires.

540
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,835
[laughing]

541
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,037
- So nice to meet you,
Julian.

542
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,173
And thank you again
for getting me this free drink.

543
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,408
- Yeah, if I could have
bought it, I would.

544
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,142
[both laugh]

545
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,877
I couldn't buy it, though.
I couldn't buy it.

546
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,780
So good to be here.
- I'm surprised.

547
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,249
You know, 'cause I ain't think
they was gonna have

548
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,750
too many Blacks around here.

549
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,519
- Yeah, it's a lot
of white folk, ain't it?

550
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:13,920
Let me tell you
a little bit about myself.

551
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,822
- I'm listening.
- I'm an entrepreneur.

552
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,990
- Mm!
- I own a couple of businesses.

553
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,792
- Well?
- Yeah. I do real estate.

554
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,761
So, yeah...
- Married?

555
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,563
- No, I am not married.
- Wait a minute.

556
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,199
I'm gonna step a little closer.
- Okay, come on.

557
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,201
I'm single.
[laughter]

558
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,436
Look at you!

559
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,704
Oh, you got me blushing
up in here.

560
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,574
Golly. I also like to, um,
collect my poop,

561
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:38,044
so the government
does not clone me.

562
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,583
- M'kay.

563
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,852
- So you guys know
who, uh, Q is?

564
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,787
Q?
- What do you mean?

565
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:51,258
- That's a weird question.
Let me ask you something.

566
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,592
You guys cops?

567
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,093
- That's what I'm wondering.

568
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,895
That's like
a cop-like question.

569
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:58,965
- Yeah.
- "Do you know who Q is?"

570
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,767
- You know about
aliens and stuff.

571
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,403
Let's not get into
the grays, all right?

572
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,804
Aliens are real.

573
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,439
You got to be careful
of them too,

574
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,174
'cause they will abduct you.

575
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,676
It's happened.

576
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:12,078
And let's not talk
about the probing.

577
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,881
Did--did they get
whatever was in you?

578
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,048
I hope so.

579
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,419
I hope so.

580
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:20,820
[applause]
- Thank you. Thank you.

581
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,890
Uh, welcome, searchers,
pioneers, and patriots.

582
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,493
I-I hate to start off
with bad news,

583
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,363
but Sidney Powell will not
be giving our keynote address.

584
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,498
She is under house arrest
right now.

585
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,433
Uh, I apologize.

586
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,502
And, again, ever hopeful,
ever forward.

587
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,671
That is what we believe here.

588
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,407
Yes, thank you.
[cheers and applause]

589
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,676
So, um, you know,
Q is a question,

590
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,712
a query, and a quest.

591
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:48,448
And pretty soon,
it is going to be a quality,

592
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:52,552
much like the quality time
that many of us are being denied

593
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,321
spending with our kids

594
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,389
because of divorce court judges,

595
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,325
resentful ex-wives,

596
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,026
traitorous family members

597
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,261
who screenshot
our Instagram posts

598
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:06,333
to show family counselors who
are deciding visitation rights,

599
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,801
who are believing the lies
of the deep state.

600
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,770
Those masks will be lifted.

601
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,672
We are about to experience

602
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:16,175
much the same experience

603
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:18,210
that Rowdy Roddy Piper
experienced

604
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,680
in the movie "They Live,"

605
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:21,948
when the...
[applause]

606
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,183
- Yeah!
- When the big, uh,

607
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,686
deep state illusion beam
was finally destroyed.

608
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,721
That will soon happen for us.

609
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,957
That is what Q is doing.

610
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,393
And the masks will be lifted.

611
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,328
All of that will be lifted.

612
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:37,764
[applause]

613
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,567
Q has cracked the code,

614
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,034
and once you crack the code,

615
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:45,872
it is so easy to see
what is hidden out there.

616
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:49,776
What is keeping you from--
from real strength.

617
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,645
From real reality.

618
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,947
From real love.

619
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:58,284
That kind of code-cracking

620
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,153
is what we are here

621
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,790
on this ship doing.

622
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,925
You're the only ones
who can see it.

623
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:10,129
And thank you guys so much
for being on this cruise.

624
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,864
Full truth ahead.

625
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:14,734
And, um, everyone
enjoy the cruise.

626
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:20,407
Thank you, thank you.
[applause]

627
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:21,774
- Heil Hitler!

628
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,443
- No, Trudy, no.
Trudy, no, no, no, no.

629
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,877
I mean, kind of.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

630
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,979
She's right, yeah, yeah.
- Right?

631
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:30,383
- I mean, heil all kinds of--
- Heil everybody.

632
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,219
[PA system chimes]

633
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,121
- Check with staff
before you use

634
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,590
any restrooms on the second,
third,

635
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,492
fourth, and sixth floor.

636
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,827
- Morning, gang.

637
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:41,994
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

638
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:42,995
- Morning.

639
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,433
- [sighs]

640
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,700
Oh, God. Ooh.

641
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,368
- Hot, right?

642
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:51,804
- It feels like almost
dangerously so.

643
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,640
- Yeah.
- Yeah, creeps up on you.

644
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,374
- Johnny Tremain
has a thought over here.

645
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:57,810
The little bird, the, uh...

646
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,579
the speaker.

647
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:00,880
Little weirdy
with the short arms.

648
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,483
- Oh.
- Eyeballs all over you.

649
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,685
- Mm-hmm.
- Saw that.

650
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,219
- I thought he was looking
at me.

651
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:09,388
- Mm-mm.
- No, I think he's got a...

652
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:11,190
- He got a motor...
- He got a Marty Feldman?

653
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,391
- Yeah. Well...

654
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,693
- I thought he was
looking at my vag.

655
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,861
- He got a little bit.
- Nope.

656
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:16,863
- Here's what I'm thinking.

657
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,798
That horrible little
weird little midget man.

658
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,800
- Yeah.
- He feels like he's got

659
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:24,671
an itch he needs to scratch.

660
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,606
- Is this code too?
- Yes.

661
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,908
- Clemmie, code name: Roxy.
- Yeah.

662
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,810
- Could get next
to that little weirdo.

663
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:32,111
- Know what I mean?
- Easy.

664
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:34,280
- Honey trap.
- Seduction.

665
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,215
- I did it to become
Miss Teen Whiskey Pete's,

666
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:37,550
and I can do it now.

667
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:38,818
- I believe the after-party

668
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:41,220
is on the lido deck at 7:00.

669
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:44,156
Perhaps there
we should lay our trap.

670
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,392
- I have never felt
such a sense of purpose.

671
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:47,994
It's been a long time.

672
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,395
- On behalf of the Reno
Sheriff's Department,

673
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:52,499
I authorize you to go to third,
but not home.

674
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:53,800
- This might be kind of obvious,

675
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:57,670
but home is--
home run is vag.

676
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:59,405
What would butt stuff be?

677
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:01,340
- Grand slam.

678
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:02,475
Finishing in the butt?

679
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,176
- That's a walk-off.
- Wait a minute.

680
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,646
But what if you finish with
your peen between the teets?

681
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:08,981
What is that called?
- Sometimes it's just an error.

682
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:12,151
[solemn chanting]

683
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:15,154
* *

684
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:18,591
- Who is currently planning
a coup in Venezuela?

685
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:22,629
Is it Obama?
Hillary Clinton?

686
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:25,932
George Soros?
All of the above?

687
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,634
Which is the best chan?

688
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,969
4chan? 8chan?

689
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,905
69chan?

a robot sent to the future
by Adolf Hitler...

692
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,079
- Ooh! Oh, I'm sorry.

693

[both laugh]
- [imitates robot beeping]

694
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,817
- I'm so clumsy.
- So close here. Um...

695
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,755
- I really liked what you were
doing onstage today.

696
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,422
- I noticed.

697
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,392
- Um...

698
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,027
You...

699
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,564
You know a lot about this--
this Q.

700
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,331
This mysterious Q.

701
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,100
- I mean...

702
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,536
do you have a couple hours?
Because--

703
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:06,505
- I do.
- Oh. Well, um...

704
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:11,978
Q is something I would like
to talk about with you.

705
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,881
That was a Q symbol
I just did on your shoulder.

706
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:17,917
- Listen, I, am...

707
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:20,720
waxed, chillaxed,
and unvaxxed.

708
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:23,222
So...

across the seven seas.

718
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:54,887
Now, sit back and enjoy

719
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:58,024
187 minutes

720
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,027
of world-class puppetry.

721
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,830
Oh, fuck.
Oh, got it.

* It's little tiny Jimmy

* It's little friend Jimmy
and a box full of men *

725

* If you did a little sin,
gonna make amends *

726
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:19,278

[in high-pitched voice]
Hi, Mom!

731
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:28,087
Here we go!

732
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:32,859
Better get ready
to start the show.

733
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,495
- [chuckling]

734
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,130
Oh...
- Hey.

735
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,565
- Good to see you.
- [laughs]

736
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,267
- Beautiful night, huh?

737
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,401
- Yeah.

738
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:43,836
I guess you could
call it that.

739
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:45,738
- You know,
there used to be a saying

740
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,073
when I was in school.

741
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,742
Why think when you can drink?

742
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:51,243
My private stash.
Go ahead.

743
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,079
- I like that saying.
- Mai tai.

744
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,514
- Yeah. Now it's...

745
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:56,716
both: Our tai.

746
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,050
[both laugh]

747
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,052
- Cheers.
- Oh!

748
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,790
Have you ever played
"I Ain't Never"?

749
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,191
- "I Ain't Never."
I don't--

750
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:08,160
- It's the Black version of
"Never Have I Ever."

751
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,896
- Well, you know,
that game is probably

752
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,131
a lot more fun with women.

753
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:13,700
- I'll start.
- Okay.

754
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:16,468
- I ain't never...

755
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:20,973
run a ship aground
in Puerto Rico,

756
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,476
thinking that I saw someone
that I knew.

757
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:27,146
Yeah? Mm. Mm.

758
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,415
- That's so specific to you.
- Ah!

759
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,184
I need you to do me a favor.
- Hmm?

760
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,320
- Take these keys.
I am...

761
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:39,625
way too messed up to drive.

762
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:41,193
- I'm gonna walk away now.

763
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,695
- I'm going to watch you.

764
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:44,463
Bon!

765
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:48,100
- Voyage.

766
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,635
What the fuck?

767
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,174
- How was everybody's
intermission?

768
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,578
Act trois.

769
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,814
In which we travel...

770
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:05,017
south of the border.

771
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,287
Fuck it. I'm sorry.

772
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,056
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

773
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,991
Fuck it. Oh, fuck.

774
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,528
Hernan is about to learn

775
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:21,667
a little lesson
about amigo-ship.

776
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,202
And when you're on a ship,

777
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:25,171
friend--friendship is the--

778
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,006
Ah, fuck it. Sorry.

779
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,708
Hernan's gonna learn a lesson,

780
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:32,745
that when we're helping
other people...

781
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:36,215
[breathing heavily]

782
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:38,717
Hernan--fuck it, fuck it.
Fuck it!

783
00:28:38,785 --> 00:28:40,119
We're gonna skip ahead.

784
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:41,954
Skip ahead, skip ahead.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

785
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:43,389
[boat horn blares]

786
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,124
[cell phone chimes]
- Oh!

787
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:48,727
Time to take my medication.

788
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:51,130
Oh, shit.

789
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:54,300
Meh, should be fine.

790
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:03,575
- [inhales and sighs]

791
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,613
Look at you.

792
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,183
Did you steal that gown
from a princess?

793
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:14,153
- Well, it's a Frozen
Halloween costume

794
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,588
that I bought at Rite Aid,
so, yeah, kind of.

795
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:19,926
- [laughs]

796
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:23,295
I'm Xavier Rothchild III.

797
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:26,398
I quit a successful career
in the cinema

798
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,935
to become a doctor for cats.

799
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,337
And now,
I go wherever I'm needed,

800
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:35,674
which is anywhere a cat
needs a doctor.

801
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,309
- Isn't that a...

802
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:40,779
a veterinarian,
technically?

803
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:42,414
- I don't think so.

804
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,851
- Okay.

805
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,018
Well, my name is Trudy.

806
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:47,887
I am an undercover cop,

807
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:49,055
which I'm not
supposed to say,

808
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,622
but I kind of feel like

809
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:52,624
you and I are getting along
really well,

810
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:57,196
and I can probably tell you
all my secrets, so...

811
00:29:57,263 --> 00:29:58,898
- You can tell me anything.

812
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:00,132
- [titters]

813
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:02,168
- Trudy?
- Yeah?

814
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,303
- Would you like to join me
for a cocktail

815
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,739
and a walk around the ship?

816
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,676
- Well, I'm supposed to join
my friends on the lower deck

817
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,078
for a diarrhea test,

818
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,347
but I suppose I could.

819
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,719
- Oh, these are not for us.

820
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:22,554
Uh, I put out
a cigarette in this.

821
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,390
Sorry, let me get us
some fresh drinks.

822
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,358
- I'm not thirsty.
I'm not thirsty.

823
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,960
- It's okay,
come with me.

824
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,128
- Okay.
- Come with me.

825
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:30,997
- No, Caesar,

826
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:33,699
I will not renounce
the Christ.

827
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:37,169
[deeps voice]
This Christ seems to have

828
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:42,875
a power over mens' souls.

829
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:45,945
My name is James Ron Dangle.
That is the show.

830
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,646
I'm 66 years young.

831
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,381
I'm between apartments
right now.

832
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,884
I would love--
in fact, need--

833
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:53,719
to do this for you.

834
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,988
But it's not just me
you have to thank

835
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:57,623
for tonight's entertainment.

836
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,992
Let's meet all

837
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,294
of the 88 performers

838
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,731
who just brought you
this wonderful tale.

839
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:10,569
- Who eats baby hearts
to stay young-looking?

840
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:13,305
Kate Beckinsale?
Gwyneth Paltrow?

841
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,241
Ryan Seacrest?

842
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:16,909
- I'm in, um...

843
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:19,278
I'm in Cabin 1503.

844
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:20,947
- Okay.
- 1-5-0-3.

845
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,214
- 1503.

846
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:23,449
- Which is, um, you know,

847
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:25,384
March 15th backwards,
you know.

848
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:26,986
The Ides of March.

849
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:29,655
It kind of makes sense
they gave me that room.

850
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,890
- I'm gonna take your word
for that.

851
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:35,327
I liked this when I understood
what you were talking about,

852
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,263
and I feel like
where you were going

853
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:40,766
was you were going to
ask me to...

854
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,134
go bang in your room.

855
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:43,702
I felt like that's where
this was headed.

856
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,371
- Let me--really quick,
could I just, um...

857
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:46,805
[clears throat]

858
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:50,943
Would you come bang in my room?

859
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,312
- Let me tell you
what I'm looking for from you.

860
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:55,347
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

861
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,249
We're gonna bone

862
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:58,617
and we're gonna talk about Q.

863
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:00,719
We're gonna listen
to some smooth jazz.

864
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:02,054
- Uh-huh.

865
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,589
- And we're gonna make this

866
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,892
the best two-day booze cruise

867
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,661
in all of history.

868
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:13,565
- Prepare to have your mind
and, uh, vagina blown apart.

869
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,134
- Ah.

870
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:18,304
[smooth jazz music]

871
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,239
- You got this.
You got this.

872
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:21,507
You give this guy
a blowner,

873
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:22,908
he might accidentally
tell the truth.

874
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,376
Happens to me.

875
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,877
- He's not gonna get
too far in my pants.

876
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,747
I've got an old-school Cotex
with a belt.

877
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:30,416
- That's my girl.
- Impenetrable.

878
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:32,084
- Well, well, well.

879
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:33,819
What do we have here?
- Oh, man!

880
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,554
Talking about the kraken.

881
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,689
- Why are you guys living
down here in the basement?

882
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,458
- It was a package deal.
- It was a package.

883
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,194
It seemed like--
they make it sound way nicer.

884
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:43,695
- Very affordable.

885
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,464
- Hey, man,
how about the great awakening?

886
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:46,932
- Yeah. The storm.

887
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:49,668
- Epstein didn't kill himself,
right?

888
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,070
Ha-ha!
- The storm's coming.

889
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:52,904
- Come on.
- So, uh...

890
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,441
word has it you guys...

891
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,143
know who Q is.

892
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:58,377
[clears throat]

893
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:00,446
- Why would we?
- I mean...

894
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:04,850
I'd give my body freely to Q,
just on principle.

895
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,018
- Fine.

896
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,055
FBI, guys.
- Whoa!

897
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:10,556
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

898
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,491
- Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

899
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,526
- God damn it.
- Oh, my God.

900
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:15,961
- What a good badge.
- Okay...

901
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:17,129
Reno Sheriff's Department.

902
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:18,364
- You're kidding me?

903
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,731
- My name is not
Jonny Tremain.

904
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:21,033
- You're deep cover
looking for...

905
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,268
- No way.

906
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,869
- Oh, hey! Whoa, whoa!

907
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,671
- Oh!
- Oh, man!

908
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,174
So the deep state...
- Yes.

909
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,309
- Is gonna just do...

910
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:33,712
- Oh. You can cut the shit.
I'm CIA.

911
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,147
- You're CIA?

912
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:36,815
- I'm with Vice News.

913
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:38,617
Is anyone QAnon
on this whole boat?

914
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,386
- Hold on, I'm with
"Mother Jones" journal, man.

915
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:41,853
You think I would be here--

916
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,655
I wouldn't be wearing
all these flags and shit.

917
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,624
I'm a Black man.
- I thought you were a real Q.

918
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,094
- I thought you were real.
- Yeah, you were good!

919
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,028
[overlapping chatter]

920
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:51,730
- You look amazing.
- You look like that lady.

921
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,299
- Thank you. I know.
I really do look like her.

922
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,900
- Now that I see you,

923
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,768
I've seen you on Vice News
thousands of times.

924
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:57,769
- Yes.
- This is the lady

925
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,305
from Vice News-
- Oh!

926
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,506
You made that Nazi guy cry

927
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,508
in the thing
with the Proud Boys.

928
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,476
I've masturbated to you.

929
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,877
- Since we're all
law enforcement,

930
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:08,614
how about we, uh,
pool our resources?

931
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,316
- Why would we do that?
We got a beat on them.

932
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,750
I mean, we-we...

933
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:13,585
- [whispers]
- We don't have any...

934
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:16,388
- No, we're good.
What's in it for us?

935
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:17,756
- Look, we're the FBI.

936
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:19,625
We've got all
the high-tech shit.

937
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:23,262
Cameras, audio equipment.
You name it, we've got it.

938
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:24,630
How about a wire for her?

939
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,432
- Yeah.
- Yup.

940
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,267
- Yeah, let's wire her up.

941
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:30,169
- Working with the FBI! Whoo!
- Sweet.

942
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:31,837
And CIA. Hi.

943
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,972
[knock on door]
- Come in.

944
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,841
- Oh.

945
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,776
Hello, patriot.

946
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:41,247
- Hello, my cool ranch
Kate Winslet.

947
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,014
- [laughs]

948
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,783
- How are you? Mwah.

949
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,285
- Oh, I love that you
left your shoes on.

950
00:34:46,352 --> 00:34:47,586
- Oh, well, you know,

951
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:49,221
you got to have
a couple of things

952
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:51,457
to throw off later.

953
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:52,724
I love a stakeout.

954
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,193
- [whispers] It's the best.
- It's the best.

955
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,494
Good just--
good coffee.

956
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:57,829
You get to smoke
in a tiny room.

957
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,631
I know it's a little
on the nose, but,

958
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,767
man, if we had, like,
old Chinese takeout,

959
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,302
wouldn't that be amazing?
- Oh! Takeout.

960
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:04,770
- Yeah, yeah, that's--
that's good.

961
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,672
- We're gonna get this guy.

962
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,374
Hope you don't mind
that I didn't make the bed.

963
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,075
I didn't want to try
to hide the lie

964
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:12,478
that I had been tossing
and turning

965
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,779
and thinking of you.

966
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,347
- [laughs]
- Because I have been.

967
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:16,882
- Well, great.

968
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,517
It smells so masculine
in here.

969
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:21,453
- Oh, well, that is the spicy
cheese puffs.

970
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,423
And if you're thirsty,
the clam lite lime.

971
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,925
- Oh.
- I would, uh, open one,

972
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:28,894
but I'm, um--
[stomach gurgling]

973
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,663
The clam lime kind of,
you know...

974
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,132
it's a kind of rush hour deal
right through me, so...

975
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,734
- Oh, as someone who has had

976
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:39,638
the clam lite lime
splatter shits before,

977
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:42,908
believe me, I shat my underwear
right off one time.

978
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,676
- Oh, um, sorry,

979
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:47,279
but vocalization leads to
visualization,

980
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:48,647
leads to realization.

981
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:50,282
Be right back in a second.
- Okay.

982
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:51,417
- I'm just gonna
leave the door open

983
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,818
and talk to you from here.

984
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,753
- Great, I have no problem
with that at all.

985
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,088
- So seriously,
thanks for coming...

986
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,490
[farting]

987
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:02,060
Uh, to just, you know,
I guess hang out and talk.

988
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:07,833
Most people--it's really rare
when a woman comes into my room.

989
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,435
- [laughing]
I don't believe that.

990
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,037
[toilet flushes]
You strike me as quite the lad--

991
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,372
Lady-killer. Oh.

992
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:15,106
- [stammers]

993
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,575
I wish I had some of those--

994
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:19,645
What are those matches
with the kind of--

995
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,613
Anyway, I just think
you're really pretty.

996
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,049
[stomach gurgles]

997
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,584
And...
- So do I.

998
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,786
And that's something
we have in common, Ron.

999
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,521
- It's like we were
talking about earlier.

1000
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:33,492
Just, you know,
feeling so alone and, like,

1001
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,694
there's no one you can...

1002
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:37,529
[stomach gurgling]
- I hear it. I hear it. Go.

1003
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,231
- Oh, okay, okay.
- It's fine. Yeah, I hear it.

1004
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:41,166
- Wait, wait, wait.

1005
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:42,734
This'll be--
this'll be a quick one.

1006
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,336
- Yeah?
- Yeah, just a little quick jet.

1007
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:45,904
A little quick jet! Oh!

1008
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:48,139
- She should be getting
extra combat pay.

1009
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,175
- Whoo!
That one had a bone in it.

1010
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:51,610
[toilet flushes]

1011
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:54,346
- Tell me some things, Ron.

1012
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:57,349
You have such a way
about you.

1013
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:58,884
I...

1014
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,787
I bet you have a lot of...

1015
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:05,957
secrets, maybe,
that people don't understand.

1016
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:08,827
- Actually hitting the nail
on the head.

1017
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,396
I...

1018
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:12,130
I mean...

1019
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,132
in a way,

1020
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,235
I am a secret.

1021
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:19,405
Forget--nothing, nothing.
Forget I said that.

1022
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:20,839
I...

1023
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,040
- Go on.

1024
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:23,442
I'm listening.

1025
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:25,176
I'm here for whatever
you want to say.

1026
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,046
- And this will just stay
between us?

1027
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,781
- Obviously.

1028
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:32,684
- Because I don't think
I ever want to leave your side.

1029
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:38,624
Right now...

1030
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,360
You

1031
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:43,529
are scratching the back...

1032
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,064
Of Q.

1033
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:47,433
I'm Q.

1034
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:48,967
- He's Q.

1035
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,969
- This guy's Q?
- This guy's Q. He's Q.

1036
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:53,238
This is Q.
- Shit. Go!

1037
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:54,440
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

1038
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:55,874
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1039
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,377

00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,650
- Hey, Asians, Hispanic dude.

1217
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:54,219
- Uh-oh. Oh, oh...

1218
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:56,554
- As minorities...
- That's it, that's it.

1219
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:58,890
We need to stick together,
all right?

1220
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:00,191
You know what I'm saying?

1221
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:03,561
Like, if my back
can wash yours,

1222
00:46:03,628 --> 00:46:06,531
then maybe you
can wash mine, right?

1223
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,968
- Yeah, man,
me and my boy here,

1224
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:11,436
we just like to party
up in the--

1225
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:12,938
- No! No!

1226
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:15,106
- No?
- No, no.

1227
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:18,944
So how many days
are we gonna be quarantined?

1228
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,713
- Just a short,
happy 30 days.

1229
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,781
- What?

1230
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:26,751
[overlapping shouting]

1231
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:29,654
[tense music]

1232
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,690
- [sobbing]

1233
00:46:32,757 --> 00:46:39,664
* *

1234
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:42,868
- I got it. Let go!
- No!

1235
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:45,871
No! No!

1236
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:48,840
[panting]

1237
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:55,813
* *

1238
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:03,488
- I know you're watching me.

1239
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,323
- I know you know
I'm watching you.

1240
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,025
- I know you know
I knew it.

1241
00:47:07,092 --> 00:47:09,160
- [counting in native language]

1242
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:11,329
Okay, bye-bye. Go.

1243
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:15,133
That's all you get.
Use front, use back.

1244
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,737
* *

1245
00:47:19,804 --> 00:47:22,707
[dispenser whirring]

1246
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:26,844
- Hey, Travis...
- Huh?

1247
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:28,246
- Why are you doing
all those so fast?

1248
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:29,780
[sniffles]

1249
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:33,151
- Toilet paper, Boss.
- Thank you very much.

1250
00:47:33,218 --> 00:47:34,719
- How long we been
quarantined?

1251
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:36,154
- Almost a half-hour.

1252
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:39,157
[mellow music]

1253
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:43,761
* *

1254
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:47,865
- Well, look at you.

1255
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:51,802
- Nice to see you again,
Clemmie,

1256
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,604
or should I say, "officer."

1257
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:55,974
Well, it's not nice
to see you again,

1258
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:57,909
you star-spangled turd.

1259
00:47:57,976 --> 00:47:59,077
- Oh, really?

1260
00:47:59,144 --> 00:48:02,180
The liar is offended
to see me again.

1261
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:06,384
- I lied, but you should
expect that from a girl.

1262
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:08,586
You said you were Q,

1263
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:11,422
and that's a lot worse,
and I am so disappointed.

1264
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:12,757
When a--

1265
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:15,060
a goddess like you
shows any bit of interest,

1266
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:16,894
of course I'm gonna lie.

1267
00:48:16,962 --> 00:48:20,198
I know you didn't ask to be
this gorgeous and this perfect,

1268
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:21,866
but you have to be ready

1269
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:25,370
for guys to do stuff like this
sometimes, okay?

1270
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:28,239
- I am very interested

1271
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:30,141
in the goddess part
of what you were saying.

1272
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,509
- It doesn't matter.

1273
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:32,710
I should have known
that you were a mirage.

1274
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:34,312
I don't know if you can
understand this,

1275
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:37,448
but my whole life
I felt like I am stuck

1276
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:41,019
in this disgusting,
low-rent desert,

1277
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:44,222
and I'm the only one
with any real inner beauty

1278
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:46,057
and any actual dreams.

1279
00:48:46,124 --> 00:48:48,493
And I just want to rise up

1280
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,363
like the burning eagle god
that I am.

1281
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,165
Can you understand that
at all?

1282
00:48:54,232 --> 00:48:56,701
- Everything you just said

1283
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,437
is everything
that I have written

1284
00:48:59,504 --> 00:49:02,373
in my own Akashic records.

1285
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,941
[both moaning]

1286
00:49:04,009 --> 00:49:05,143
Oh!

1287
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:06,911
[giggles]

1288
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:09,214
[sultry music]

1289
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,782
- Oh! Ah! Ah!
- Oh, yeah!

1290
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:13,051
- [laughing]

1291
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:14,752
- [groans loudly]

1292
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:17,055
[sighs]

1293
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:19,524
That was incredible.

1294
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,493
- I'll bet it was.
- Yeah.

1295
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,962
- I admire your efficiency.

1296
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:30,935
- You know, only three men
have ever seen my labia before.

1297
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:34,639
One was my ex-husband,
one was my pediatrician,

1298
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:37,175
and the other
was an ambulance driver.

1299
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:40,478
So consider yourself
very lucky.

1300
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:41,846
- Proud to be number four.

1301
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,114
- [giggles]

1302
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:45,916
- I am tormented
by your beauty.

1303
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,219
- Mm, can I take this
out of my mouth--

1304
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:49,954
- Not yet.
- Okay.

1305
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:51,822
- Just finishing the shading

1306
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:56,161
around your beautiful face
and pubis.

1307
00:49:56,227 --> 00:49:58,429
- I'm gonna need a lot of
shading,

1308
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,465
FYI, for the pubis area,

1309
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:02,800
because one thing they don't
tell you in health class

1310
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:06,971
is that your pubis does get
a lot bigger the older you get,

1311
00:50:07,038 --> 00:50:09,074
and I'm not bragging.

1312
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,375
[laughs]

1313
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:11,642
- Almost done with the shading.

1314
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:13,144
- How does my butthole look?

1315
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:14,345
- Let me take a look.

1316
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:17,482
A little more pink.

1317
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:20,251
- Hmm. You flatter me.

1318
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:21,986
- Relax the face.

1319
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:26,023
And relax the anus.

1320
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:29,160
Yes. Perfect.

1321
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:32,230
- [exhales]

1322
00:50:32,297 --> 00:50:34,499
- You know,

1323
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:37,468
after being inside of you
for two seconds like that,

1324
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:40,438
I just feel
so much closer to you.

1325
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:42,940
I feel like I'm a part
of you now.

1326
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:45,009
And I...

1327
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:47,545
I would never ask this,

1328
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:51,449
but I feel so comfortable
with you.

1329
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:53,584
What's your real name?

1330
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:56,454
- [sighs]

1331
00:50:56,521 --> 00:50:58,423
It's kind of embarrassing.

1332
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:04,362
Clementine Anne Johnson.

1333
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:05,763
- Clementine?

1334
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:09,334
You mean like the sweet
nibbly cookie?

1335
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,037
I'd say that's perfect
for you.

1336
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:14,372
- Well, I never thought of it
like that.

1337
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:15,606
- [laughs]

1338
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:18,176
- But that makes sense.

1339
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:20,778
- You know...

1340
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,012
I'm not really Q.

1341
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,681
I'm his right-hand man.

1342
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:26,884
In a lot of ways,
I'm his mouthpiece.

1343
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:30,988
I deliver his messages,
and sometimes...

1344
00:51:31,055 --> 00:51:33,491
[dramatic music]

1345
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:36,461
I invent some of those messages.

1346
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:39,063
Just the stuff like,
you know,

1347
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,499
Britney Spears
is really Lee Harvey Oswald.

1348
00:51:41,566 --> 00:51:42,867
And, you know--
- That was you?

1349
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,902
- Yeah, that was me. Yeah.
- [gasps]

1350
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:47,572
- Yes, there's a bit
of a thrill of, you know,

1351
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:50,608
being able to kind of control
the zeitgeist,

1352
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:56,614
but the lifestyle
is fucking amazing.

1353
00:51:56,681 --> 00:52:00,851
We own Jeffrey Epstein's
old island.

1354
00:52:00,918 --> 00:52:02,920
It has a secret bunker
underneath it.

1355
00:52:02,987 --> 00:52:07,458
It has a food court with every
discontinued fast-food chain.

1356
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:09,227
Kenny Rogers Roasters,
Burger Chef;

1357
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:12,297
they're all in operation,
only at that one food court.

1358
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:13,931
- Go fuck yourself.

1359
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:15,666
- Yeah.

1360
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:17,568
- You know what I find crazy,
Xavier?

1361
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:18,869
You're a painter.

1362
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:21,272
I make dolls
out of my old pantyhose,

1363
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:22,740
so we're both artists.

1364
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:26,177
And we randomly meet on a cruise
and fall in love

1365
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:28,145
on the exact day

1366
00:52:28,213 --> 00:52:31,081
that I run out of
my anti-psychotic medication.

1367
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,918
I mean, if that's not kismet,
I don't know what is.

1368
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,085
- Perfect timing.

1369
00:52:37,222 --> 00:52:39,089
- Wiegel!

1370
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,558
Wiegel, you're naked.

1371
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:42,693
- I know that.
I'm being painted.

1372
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,094
- What?
- Please leave us alone.

1373
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,731
- Wiegel, Wiegel,
you are naked in the buffet.

1374
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:50,235
- Can we please
have some privacy?

1375
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:52,470
- Your friend cannot be naked
in the buffet.

1376
00:52:52,537 --> 00:52:54,539
- I know.
- We have a sign that says so.

1377
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:56,006
You'd think we don't
need a sign that says,

1378
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:58,543
"Please do not be naked
in the buffet," but we do.

1379
00:52:58,609 --> 00:52:59,944
- I see it.
- This is a diarrhea nightmare.

1380
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,280
- I apologize.
Trudy, please.

1381
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:05,316
- Don't listen to him, Trudy.
It's just you and I.

1382
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:07,084
- Don't worry, sugar balls.

1383
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:09,620
I only have ears for you.

1384
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,021
- Trudy, that's a plant.

1385
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:13,023
- God, you look so beautiful
right now.

1386
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,359
- Come back, Trudy.

1387
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:15,393
Come back!

1388
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,495
- Your jealousy is gross.

1389
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:19,163
- Trudy!

1390
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:22,132
[smooth bass music]

1391
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,336
* *

1392
00:53:25,403 --> 00:53:27,204
- Morning, gang.

1393
00:53:27,272 --> 00:53:28,839
all: Morning.
- Morning.

1394
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:31,175
- I know it hasn't been ideal...
- [PA system chimes]

1395
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:33,811
- If you haven't filled out
your diarrhea app,

1396
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,080
do so immediately.

1397
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:40,084
Failure to do so will result
in a very serious penalty.

1398
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,853
Remember, message
and data rates may apply.

1399
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,657
- Raise your hand if you forgot
to log your diarrhea today.

1400
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,726
- I didn't forget,
but I tried and it crashed.

1401
00:53:48,793 --> 00:53:50,194
- Almost everyone!

1402
00:53:50,261 --> 00:53:52,330
- When I say, "hell,"
you say, "o."

1403
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:54,699
Hello! Hello.

1404
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:58,503
I just got off of the phone
with the doctors

1405
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,705
from the ship
and the mainland,

1406
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:03,974
and I am now
certifiably insane.

1407
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:05,610
They actually used the word--

1408
00:54:05,676 --> 00:54:07,578
and I never heard a doctor say
this before--

1409
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:09,980
cat shit crazy.

1410
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:12,683
So I don't want to say
screw all of you,

1411
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,453
so I will say
fuck all of you.

1412
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,821
Fuck the ship life.

1413
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:19,290
This jacket was
my grandfather's.

1414
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:21,359
They took it off his cold body.

1415
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:22,693
He wasn't dead yet.

1416
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,629
You can have that.
Take that for you.

1417
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:27,064
[exclaims]

1418
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:28,466
Oh!

1419
00:54:28,533 --> 00:54:30,735
- Oh!
- [laughs]

1420
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:31,969
Big son of a...

1421
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:33,037
- I think this is cause
for concern.

1422
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,373
all: Oh!

1423
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,074
- How come he hasn't got
diarrhea?

1424
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:39,944
- [whistle blowing]

1425
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,046
Okay, everybody.
- Yes?

1426
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,714
- Calm down.
All calm down.

1427
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,783
- Why did you say "calm down"?
We were relatively calm.

1428
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,953
[overlapping shouting]

1429
00:54:50,388 --> 00:54:51,822
- We were calm!

1430
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:53,891
[whistle blowing]
- As you can see,

1431
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,861
the captain has gone
a little bit crazy.

1432
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:58,963
- Certifiably cat shit crazy.

1433
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,599
- And since that is, you know,
he's a little cause for alarm,

1434
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:02,833
I am taking over.

1435
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,669
- I am not taking orders

1436
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:06,003
from another guy in shorts!

1437
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,606
- Pass. Hard pass.
- And you know what?

1438
00:55:08,673 --> 00:55:10,908
None of you updated
your MyDiarrhea app.

1439
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,209
- I did, though!
Except for not them!

1440
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:13,744
But I actually did.

1441
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:17,314
You are not taking the ship.
Thank you, but no thank you.

1442
00:55:17,382 --> 00:55:19,183
[gunfire, screaming]

1443
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,551
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1444
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:22,420
- Put them below deck.
- Okay, okay, we'll go.

1445
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:24,188
[all shouting]
- No. No. No. No.

1446
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:25,390
- Come on!

1447
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:26,691
- Oh, my God.

1448
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:28,826
No. No, oh, my God!

1449
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:33,664
- Yes. Guns! Guns! Guns!
Guns! Guns!

1450
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:35,800
When I say "guns,"
you say, "mm!"

1451
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:42,139
- This is like that movie.

1452
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:45,209
You know, the guy
with the glasses.

1453
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:50,448
Come on, the one--
Come on.

1454
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:53,451
When you--the thing?

1455
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:54,719
- "Amistad"?
- Yes.

1456
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:56,421
- How did you get that?

1457
00:55:56,487 --> 00:55:58,188
- I'm sorry, don't do that.

1458
00:55:58,255 --> 00:56:01,058
Don't compare a slave ship
to what we're in.

1459
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:02,760
- How is this not
the exact same thing?

1460
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:05,329
- Black people still have
high blood pressure today

1461
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:07,264
because of what happened.

1462
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:09,199
The salt was so...

1463
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:11,101
- Was that the name of
that movie, by the way?

1464
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:12,803
- Oh, don't make this
be like the whole thing

1465
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,238
when he gives that
whole lecture about "Roots".

1466
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,507
- I'll be honest, if I was--
[PA system chimes]

1467
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:18,709
- Hello, everyone.
This is your captain.

1468
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:20,878
I hope you are having
a wonderful day.

1469
00:56:20,945 --> 00:56:23,113
It's a good day to die.

1470
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,716
Speaking of that, I'm about
to run this ship aground

1471
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:27,485
and kill all of us.

1472
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:29,720
- Go! Go!
[all scream]

1473
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:32,356
Whoa! Whoa!

1474
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:34,525
[klaxon blaring distantly]

1475
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:35,993
- Everybody okay?
- Oh!

1476
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,695
- Tell you right now, people--

1477
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:40,831
Hands in.

1478
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:45,436
Heroes are not made...

1479
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:46,971
at a summer frolic,

1480
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:50,675
at a picnic with a basket

1481
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:53,544
of fruits, crudités,
cheeses, and meats.

1482
00:56:53,611 --> 00:56:54,812
- What the fuck?

1483
00:56:54,879 --> 00:56:56,046
- Maybe a sparkling white--

1484
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:58,182
Hero--I'm getting
to this part.

1485
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,351
Heroes are forged

1486
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,253
in fire.

1487
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,990
all: Yeah!
- [shouting angrily]

1488
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:07,424
Let's do something about this!

1489
00:57:07,492 --> 00:57:08,959
- Yes! What do we do?

1490
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:10,194
- Are we clowns, or are we the
Reno Sheriff's Department?

1491
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,362
- We're the Reno Sheriff's
Department!

1492
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,766
[shouting gibberish]

1493
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:18,769
[exciting music]

1494
00:57:18,836 --> 00:57:23,240
* *

1495
00:57:23,307 --> 00:57:24,875
- Go, go, go, go.

1496
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,645
* *

1497
00:57:27,712 --> 00:57:34,852
* *

1498
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,757
- These decks is off-limits,
everybody.

1499
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:41,191
Oh!

1500
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:44,261
[laughs]

1501
00:57:44,328 --> 00:57:46,497
[all laughing]
- Hey, who did this?

1502
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:48,432
[screams]

1503
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:50,768
[water splashes]

1504
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:52,236
[meaty thud]
[all gasp]

1505
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:55,305
[mechanical whirring
and grinding]

1506
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:57,341
- Oh, God.

1507
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:58,909
Right into the propeller.

1508
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,078
- He's all mixed up
in there.

1509
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:02,580
- Circle of life.
Circle of life, right?

1510
00:58:02,647 --> 00:58:04,982
- In what way?
- Um, let's not get specific.

1511
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:06,751
Let's--you know,
the circle of life.

1512
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,052
- Oh, shit,
we got to stop the boat.

1513
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:09,587
- Go.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1514
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:12,757
[speaking native language]

1515
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:16,894
- Let's go.

1516
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:18,763
- Captain!
[all shouting]

1517
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,064
- Captain, we got to stop!

1518
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,799
[overlapping shouting]

1519
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:24,334
- All right, step back,
step back!

1520
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:25,970
- Don't worry.

1521
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:27,638
We do stuff like this
all the time.

1522
00:58:27,705 --> 00:58:29,774
[gunshot]
- [screams]

1523
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,841
- Sorry!

1524
00:58:30,908 --> 00:58:32,009
Don't do it!
Don't do it!

1525
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:33,510
You got to let us in!

1526
00:58:33,578 --> 00:58:34,745
- How do we stop the ship?

1527
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:36,881
- What if we drop the anchor?

1528
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:38,816
- Yeah! Go, go, go!

1529
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:41,686
- What if we drop the anchor?

1530
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:44,622
Use your lower body.
On three.

1531
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:45,923
[exhales sharply]

1532
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,592
One, two...

1533
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:50,795
[all straining]

1534
00:58:52,396 --> 00:58:53,764
I'm getting it!
I got a little bit!

1535
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:55,132
I got something over here!

1536
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:56,601
Son of a bitch,
I had something over here.

1537
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:58,435
- Let's do it one more time,
'cause I have to admit,

1538
00:58:58,502 --> 00:59:00,905
I wasn't pulling at all.
I was just going, "Ah!"

1539
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,407
- Fulcrum.
[all straining]

1540
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:04,809
- Anything?

1541
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,744
- Yeah, I felt it move!
I felt it move!

1542
00:59:06,811 --> 00:59:07,978
- I got something!

1543
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,581
[overlapping shouting]

1544
00:59:10,648 --> 00:59:13,283
- One, two, three.

1545
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:16,286
[all yell]

1546
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:20,625
- Sometimes...

1547
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:22,860
the best move

1548
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:24,895
is to admit
when you need help.

1549
00:59:24,962 --> 00:59:25,896
- Help! Help!

1550
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:27,264
- Don't scream.

1551
00:59:27,331 --> 00:59:28,833
Okay, no,
scream, scream.

1552
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,000
- Help!
- We need help!

1553
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,636
[all shouting]

1554
00:59:31,702 --> 00:59:33,070
all: Help!

1555
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:35,873
- My brothers and sisters
of color,

1556
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,043
Q weirdos who actually turned
out to be pretty nice folks,

1557
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:43,047
America used to be great
'cause we did stuff together.

1558
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:44,782
Let's do this together, guys.

1559
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:46,016
And heave!

1560
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:49,153
[all yelling]

1561
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:51,521
Heave! Heave! Heave!

1562
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:56,226
Heave! And ho!

1563
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:59,730
Yes!
[all cheering]

1564
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:01,565
[loud crash]

1565
01:00:01,632 --> 01:00:02,833
[water splashes]

1566
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,835
Hey, guys...

1567
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:06,603
we fucked up again.

1568
01:00:06,671 --> 01:00:07,805
- Yeah, it's supposed to be
attached, right?

1569
01:00:07,872 --> 01:00:08,806
- Yeah.

1570
01:00:08,873 --> 01:00:10,407
all: Captain!

1571
01:00:10,474 --> 01:00:12,042
- Capitán.
[all shouting]

1572
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:14,044
- Hey, listen!

1573
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:17,014
- I forgot, the crazy Black
captain "Bonofrise"

1574
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:18,716
gave me the keys!
- Oh, my God!

1575
01:00:18,783 --> 01:00:20,985
- Let's do it.
- Go, go, go!

1576
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:23,287
- So much better than violence.

1577
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:24,588
Hey!

1578
01:00:24,655 --> 01:00:26,691
- Gentle. Gentle.
- Why don't you come on out?

1579
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:28,425
Look what I got for you, huh?

1580
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:30,360
- Oh. Shall we?

1581
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:31,595
- Yes, we shall.

1582
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:33,297
- Great, I'm gonna maybe
turn the ship off.

1583
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,732
- I wish I'd known
you were here.

1584
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,233
I would have let you in earlier.

1585
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,502
- We did it.
- Man, you're batshit crazy.

1586
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:40,337
Hey! We did it!
We saved the ship!

1587
01:00:40,404 --> 01:00:42,472
- Whoo-hoo!
- Don't have to thank us.

1588
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:44,141
- [shouts angrily]
- Oh, shit!

1589
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:47,277
- [gunfire]
[all scream]

1590
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,716
- What? What?

1591
01:00:51,782 --> 01:00:53,150
- Are you out?

1592
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:56,253
- No hard feelings, right?

1593
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:01,125
- Mutiny in international law
is very bad.

1594
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:02,492
I mean, we could kill you.

1595
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,095
But we're not gonna do that,
because we nice.

1596
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:07,131
And we want a good
Tripadvisor review.

1597
01:01:07,197 --> 01:01:09,299
Five star, please.
Thank you so much.

1598
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:10,901
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

1599
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:13,037
- Bye-bye, my love.
- Bye.

1600
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:14,438
- Goodbye, my dear.

1601
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,006
- I left one of my panty liners

1602
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:17,641
under your pillow!

1603
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:18,976
- [whispering]
Who is she talking to?

1604
01:01:19,043 --> 01:01:20,745
- I will wait for
you right here!

1605
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:22,446
Fully engorged!

1606
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:26,116
[boat horn blows]

1607
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,853
- Bye, bye!
[speaking native language]

1608
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:31,856
[dramatic music]

1609
01:01:31,922 --> 01:01:36,460
* *

1610
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,862
[all gasp]

1611
01:01:37,928 --> 01:01:38,996
- Oh, my God!
- What the hell?

1612
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:40,230
- Holy--
- Were you guys here

1613
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:41,498
the whole time?
- Oh, yeah.

1614
01:01:41,565 --> 01:01:43,934
We--we turned this
into our little, um...

1615
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:45,669
excuse me, but fuck nest.

1616
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:47,671
[laughs]
- Ew!

1617
01:01:47,738 --> 01:01:50,574
- This succubus has me
up to, like, eight seconds.

1618
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,943
Never lasted that long.
- Congratulations.

1619
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,311
- Nobody asked.

1620
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:57,181
- If I get into double digits,
this is the one.

1621
01:01:57,247 --> 01:01:59,850
[sighs]
- I'll buy you an ice cream.

1622
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:01,819
- Oh!
- [both laugh]

1623
01:02:01,886 --> 01:02:03,620
all: No, no, no!

1624
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:06,256
- Oh, come on!

1625
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:08,325
- Just read the raft.
Read the raft, right?

1626
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:11,862
- Does anybody know, like,
which way we're even drifting?

1627
01:02:11,929 --> 01:02:13,530
That's the drinking gourd
up there.

1628
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:15,099
The handle points
to the North Star.

1629
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:19,103
- I mean, if that really is
the drinking gourd, I mean...

1630
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:20,470
I probably shouldn't
say this,

1631
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:22,539
about a hundred miles
north of here...

1632
01:02:22,606 --> 01:02:24,942
[sighs]

1633
01:02:25,009 --> 01:02:26,710
[whispers]
Sorry, dude.

1634
01:02:26,777 --> 01:02:29,213
But, uh, Q's headquarters

1635
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:31,281
are on my friend's island.

1636
01:02:31,348 --> 01:02:33,183
My friend had a really nice
island with a--

1637
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,819
you know, a mansion
and a sex dungeon and--

1638
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:36,821
- Jeff Epstein.

1639
01:02:36,887 --> 01:02:39,156
Who else has an island
with a sex dungeon?

1640
01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:40,124
- Okay, yeah, fine. Jeff
Epstein...

1641
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,491
- Well, David Copperfield.

1642
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:42,426
- David Copperfield.
- Okay, yeah.

1643
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:43,660
- Well, how do we get there?

1644
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:46,630
- Did you say 100 miles
north of here?

1645
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:48,966
- Yeah. I mean,
I don't really know basic,

1646
01:02:49,033 --> 01:02:50,835
you know, boat craft or--

1647
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:53,737
Whoa, what are you--

1648
01:02:53,804 --> 01:02:55,439
- There's a couple guys
in the world

1649
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:58,142
that could get you
100 miles north of here

1650
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,544
by the stars.

1651
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,745
And one of them...

1652
01:03:01,812 --> 01:03:03,013
- Harriet Tubman.

1653
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,049
- Is James Ron Dangle,

1654
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,517
United States Coast Guard.

1655
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:09,386
I mean, discharged.
Asked to leave.

1656
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:11,288
- You know the story.
all: Yeah, yeah.

1657
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:12,622
- For sure.
- Well, wait, I mean,

1658
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:14,058
have you all heard it?
'Cause I haven't--

1659
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:15,359
- You don't need to--
- My and another fellow were

1660
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:16,793
asked to leave the Coast Guard
on the same day.

1661
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:18,462
- Nah, we don't need to...

1662
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:21,298
- Jim, what are you gonna do?

1663
01:03:21,365 --> 01:03:24,268
[heroic music]

1664
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:31,475
* *

1665
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:44,821
* *

1666
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:04,774
- [whimpers]
- Damn.

1667
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:08,112
I am so over all of it.

1668
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,480
Trudy, stop slobbing on me.

1669
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:12,616
I'm tired of looking
at Dangle's ass,

1670
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,185
I'm hungry,
and it's all your fault, Jones.

1671
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:17,487
- My fault?
- You found the Booze Cruise!

1672
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:20,290
- My fault because I can type?
- Actually, Dangle booked it.

1673
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:21,691
- Dangle booked it.

1674
01:04:21,758 --> 01:04:23,293
- Clemmie, it's you!

1675
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,229
You were the one who was
supposed to get information,

1676
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:26,796
instead of having a fuck nest!

1677
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,233
- Excuse me, excuse me!
- Don't you dare!

1678
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:31,168
- This is a love fort!

1679
01:04:31,235 --> 01:04:33,670
- They're all just waiting to
turn on me!

1680
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:34,972
They all know that it was--
[loud thud]

1681
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,873
Travis? Travis?

1682
01:04:36,941 --> 01:04:38,108
- Hey.
- Hey.

1683
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:39,676
- Hey, guys!
- Oh, my God.

1684
01:04:39,743 --> 01:04:40,945
[all gasp and cheer]

1685
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:42,212
- Oh, my God.

1686
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:44,514
[all laugh]

1687
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:46,383
- Whoo!
- Oh, wow.

1688
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:47,884
- You did it, Jim.

1689
01:04:47,952 --> 01:04:48,986
You did it.

1690
01:04:49,053 --> 01:04:51,155
- Yeah!
Yeah, Dangle.

1691
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:54,158
- Followed the drinking gourd.
[laughs]

1692
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:57,594
- Welcome to, uh,
Jeffrey Epstein's island.

1693
01:04:57,661 --> 01:05:00,197
You are now all our prisoners,

1694
01:05:00,264 --> 01:05:03,867
and will be taken to trial
before Q!

1695
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:05,735
- What?
[guns cock]

1696
01:05:05,802 --> 01:05:08,738
[all whimper]

1697
01:05:11,275 --> 01:05:12,742
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!

1698
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:16,813
- Clemmie, you're gonna need
to decide.

1699
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,582
Are you with me--
- I'm with you, yes!

1700
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:19,849
- Okay, good.
- Yes.

1701
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,218
- Do you want to yell
at the minions

1702
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:22,619
and tell them--
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1703
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:25,322
Hey, minions,
you with the colorful face.

1704
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:27,357
Take these losers away.

1705
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:28,858
I'm sorry, but it's true.
You're all losers.

1706
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,128
Take them away!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1707
01:05:31,195 --> 01:05:33,197
- Search their cavities.

1708
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:34,965
Someone has something, I swear.

1709
01:05:35,032 --> 01:05:36,666
Sorry, not sorry!

1710
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:39,036
[both laugh]

1711
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:40,737
- Oh! I love our lives.

1712
01:05:40,804 --> 01:05:42,106
Oh.

1713
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:45,109
[tense music]

1714
01:05:45,175 --> 01:05:49,346

1717
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,388
- Hello?

1718
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:03,060

* *

1722
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:30,220
- I love the open concept.

* *

1724
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,666
- I'm impressed, Sheriff.

1725
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:44,601
- I'm actually not the sheriff.

1726
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,670
I'm Lieutenant James Ron Dangle,

1727
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:47,971
Reno Sheriff's Department.

1728
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:51,007
Also, uh, amateur puppeteer.
Almost went pro--

1729
01:06:51,075 --> 01:06:52,809
[yelps]

1730
01:06:55,312 --> 01:06:57,681
- So are you Q?

1731
01:06:57,747 --> 01:07:00,250
- [laughs]

1732
01:07:00,317 --> 01:07:03,787
Don't play stupid, Officer.

1733
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,855
- She's not playing.
That was a legitimate question.

1734
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:08,092
- She's really
not the bright.

1735
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:09,826
- You should all be very happy
with yourselves.

1736
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:12,629
No one else has ever gotten
this far.

1737
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:17,334
So you came all this way
to find out who Q really is.

1738
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:19,069
- Yeah, that's right.

1739
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:20,837
- Well, I'll tell you.

1740
01:07:20,904 --> 01:07:25,642
Years ago, a ship wrecked
on this very island,

1741
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:30,347
carrying a brilliant
and deranged professor.

1742
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:31,715
That professor...

1743
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:33,550
- Was Q.

1744
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:35,119
- Died in the wreck.

1745
01:07:35,185 --> 01:07:36,386
- Okay.

1746
01:07:36,453 --> 01:07:39,923
- But we found this...

1747
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:41,958
in the wreckage.

1748
01:07:42,025 --> 01:07:44,994
* *

1749
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,197
- Uh, brother man, that--

1750
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:48,232
that's a Speak & Spell.

1751
01:07:48,298 --> 01:07:49,799
- Yes, it is.

1752
01:07:49,866 --> 01:07:51,868
Or, it was.

1753
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,637
Time and providence,

1754
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:56,039
and probably
saltwater corrosion,

1755
01:07:56,106 --> 01:08:00,410
has altered its programming...

1756
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:02,146
imbuing it...

1757
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:05,382
and I'm not sure if I'm using
the word "imbuing" correctly.

1758
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:07,417
But it infused it--

1759
01:08:07,484 --> 01:08:09,586
it infused it...
- Infused.

1760
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:11,455
- With a dynamic,
divine wisdom...

1761
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:13,557
- Oh. Yeah, okay.

1762
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:16,893
- That Q imparts
and we disseminate.

1763
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,462
- Oh, I get it.

1764
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:21,365
So you guys are just
batshit crazy.

1765
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,899
- Wait.

1766
01:08:22,966 --> 01:08:24,201
Listen.

1767
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:26,336
- Hmm?
- And learn.

1768
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:29,539
* *

1769
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:35,979
[Speak & Spell chimes]

1770
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:38,515
- Oprah has bears.

1771
01:08:38,582 --> 01:08:41,050
- [laughs]

1772
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,519
- Oprah has bears.

1773
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:44,954
Oprah has bears!

1774
01:08:45,021 --> 01:08:47,090
Let it be known
that Oprah has bears.

1775
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:49,359
Go to your mobile devices,

1776
01:08:49,426 --> 01:08:51,695
get the word out on 8chan.

1777
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:53,463
- This is a dumb,
dumb question.

1778
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:56,300
This isn't how
the whole thing works, right?

1779
01:08:56,366 --> 01:08:58,535
[nervous laughter]

1780
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:00,704
It is--
- It is, definitely.

1781
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:03,106
- That's words, and then you...

1782
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:04,741
put the words on an 8chan.

1783
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:06,576
- It actually checks out
more than I would have thought.

1784
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:07,777
- Yep.
[Speak & Spell chimes]

1785
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:10,079
- The flu is from France.

1786
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:13,517
- It's true, because sometimes
the flu is from France.

1787
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:15,985
- But as often as not
it's not, actually.

1788
01:09:16,052 --> 01:09:18,422
- Well, sometimes it is.
[overlapping chatter]

1789
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,590
- To the dungeon with them.

1790
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:23,092
And go through the bunker.
It's faster.

1791
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,563
And tell Ron to set off
that bomb.

1792
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:29,333
The big one that will destroy
the island.

1793
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:30,634
- Oh, my God!

1794
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,168
We will not--
you do not have to kill us!

1795
01:09:32,236 --> 01:09:34,504
You do not have to kill us!

1796
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:36,440
- Go, go, go, go.
- We won't remember!

1797
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,174
- Come on.
- Blow them up.

1798
01:09:38,242 --> 01:09:41,478
- Can I just ask you
where you got that rag?

1799
01:09:41,545 --> 01:09:42,879
- Walmart.

1800
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:44,881
- That's nice--
that's real nice.

1801
01:09:44,948 --> 01:09:47,717
- Clever, clever interlopers.

1802
01:09:47,784 --> 01:09:49,085
- We're not clever!

1803
01:09:49,152 --> 01:09:50,354
- Ow! Ow!

1804
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:51,721
- Oh, hey, hey, ho!

1805
01:09:54,057 --> 01:09:56,560
- Sorry, I'm just a little
excited right now.

1806
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:58,228
I've, uh-- [clears throat]

1807
01:09:58,295 --> 01:09:59,729
I've always wanted a monologue,

1808
01:09:59,796 --> 01:10:04,200
a secret fortress with
a smoking-hot vixen next to me.

1809
01:10:04,268 --> 01:10:05,969
- You do look hot, Clemmie.

1810
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,737
- You look rad.
- Damn!

1811
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:08,972
- The whole thing.
Show the whole thing.

1812
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,675
- Look at that. Oh!
- Yes, queen!

1813
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:13,109
- Work!
- Work.

1814
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:15,412
- Marlene Dietrich in the front,
Stevie Nicks in the back.

1815
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:16,880
- [laughs]
Oh.

1816
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:18,848
- We've got the whole
nerve center here,

1817
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:21,585
feeding all the greatest hits
into the algorithm.

1818
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:23,853
You know,
the standard conspiracies.

1819
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,223
Moon landing faked,
pumpkins aren't real,

1820
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:28,858
Joe Rogan is a hologram.

1821
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:32,962
The, uh, gluten-free diet,
um, causes levitation.

1822
01:10:33,029 --> 01:10:35,999
Um, that's a really good one.
Great work.

1823
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,668
Now, of course,
that you've, uh...

1824
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,704
seen all of this,

1825
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,172
I have to blow it up.

1826
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,475
- What?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1827
01:10:45,542 --> 01:10:47,577
[all shouting]

1828
01:10:47,644 --> 01:10:49,145
- Silence!
- I'm out!

1829
01:10:49,212 --> 01:10:53,650
- A bomb this exquisite
can only be set in motion

1830
01:10:53,717 --> 01:10:56,019
by somebody as exquisite.

1831
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,854
- Clemmie, what about all those
great times that we had?

1832
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:59,323
Remember all those
great times we had?

1833
01:10:59,389 --> 01:11:00,490
- Suck it, monkeys.

1834
01:11:00,557 --> 01:11:01,958
- [laughs]

1835
01:11:02,025 --> 01:11:04,294
- Hey, cut it out.
- Hey!

1836
01:11:04,361 --> 01:11:05,929
- Hey, now, Clemmie.

1837
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:07,297
- Oh!
- Come on now.

1838
01:11:07,364 --> 01:11:08,598
- Oh!

1839
01:11:08,665 --> 01:11:11,067
Anyway, we would love
to stick around,

1840
01:11:11,134 --> 01:11:13,002
but we have to, um,

1841
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:14,671
pack up a lot of money
and pills, right?

1842
01:11:14,738 --> 01:11:16,205
- Money and pills.
- Money and pills.

1843
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,141
Glenn, to the dungeon.

1844
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:21,110
[overlapping shouting]

1845
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:24,013
- No, no, no, no, no!

1846
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,582
No!

1847
01:11:25,649 --> 01:11:28,718
- Is this the first time you've
had hour friends blown up?

1848
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:31,287
It's hard the first time,
but it gets easier.

1849
01:11:31,355 --> 01:11:32,389
- Does it?
- It really does.

1850
01:11:32,456 --> 01:11:33,390
Trust me, sweetie.

1851
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:34,924
[both giggle]

1852
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:37,026
- But, really, what were they
gonna live for?

1853
01:11:37,093 --> 01:11:38,562
Nothing.

1854
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,630
- Sir?
- Is there gonna be, like,

1855
01:11:40,697 --> 01:11:42,599
snacks or anything?

1856
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:44,401
- Appeal to his humanity.
Glenn, was it?

1857
01:11:44,468 --> 01:11:45,702
- Glenn?
- Hey, Glenn.

1858
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:48,838
- Oh, I have an itch!
I have an itch!

1859
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:51,040
- Is it bad that I feel like

1860
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:53,343
I'm being threatened
with a good time?

1861
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:55,845
Just to state the obvious here,

1862
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:57,881
this is a really nice
sex dungeon.

1863
01:11:57,947 --> 01:12:00,884
- Yeah.
- I'm on the mailing list

1864
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:03,119
of the company that makes
this domination gear.

1865
01:12:03,186 --> 01:12:06,890
They're an outfit out of Bruges
called Pamplemousse & Thunder.

1866
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:08,324
I mean, this is some
of the nice stuff.

1867
01:12:08,392 --> 01:12:10,460
Some of this is actually
next year's stuff, by the way.

1868
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:12,195
Literally, they advertise

1869
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:14,097
that your submissives
will never escape.

1870
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,565
So I don't want
to be a bummer,

1871
01:12:15,632 --> 01:12:17,834
but this is really well made.

1872
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:20,404
[beeping]
- Warning.

1873
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:21,805
Warning.

1874
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:26,275
- Ron, thank you
for changing my life.

1875
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,677
I deserve this.

1876
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:28,878
- Thank you for being
the kind of person

1877
01:12:28,945 --> 01:12:31,147
whose life I wanted to change.

1878
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:34,317
But all your friends,
I mean...

1879
01:12:34,384 --> 01:12:37,954
I am blowing them up.

1880
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:40,424
- Yeah.

1881
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:43,226
About that, um...

1882
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:44,594
- Listen, hey, gang,

1883
01:12:44,661 --> 01:12:45,995
I gotta tell you--
I gotta tell you something.

1884
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:48,565
I--I really think
this is it.

1885
01:12:48,632 --> 01:12:49,966
- Do you have to go
to the restroom?

1886
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:53,069
- No, I think we're really
gonna die in here.

1887
01:12:53,136 --> 01:12:54,904
- Jones, don't say that!
- Don't say that.

1888
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:56,072
- Don't you say that!

1889
01:12:56,139 --> 01:12:57,707
- Even though
it's probably true.

1890
01:12:57,774 --> 01:12:59,743
- It's kind of funny
if you think about it.

1891
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:01,344
all: No, no.

1892
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:03,012
- You just missed
the whole vibe right there.

1893
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:04,581
- This is bad.
This is really, really bad,

1894
01:13:04,648 --> 01:13:06,082
and I feel--I feel--

1895
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:08,718
I feel sorry
mostly for me and Rai-Rai,

1896
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:11,320
'cause this--
this is really bad for us.

1897
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,723
- Because of the optics?
Guys, can we not agree

1898
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:15,792
this sucks equally
pretty much for all of us?

1899
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:18,027
- No! No! No, we can't agree.
- Yes! Yes!

1900
01:13:18,094 --> 01:13:21,197
- No.
It looks worse for us, Jim.

1901
01:13:21,264 --> 01:13:22,766
- I think we should just
kind of go with it.

1902
01:13:22,832 --> 01:13:23,967
If we're dying, we're dying.

1903
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:25,669
But can we do it
in silence?

1904
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,604
- [sobbing]
I think this is it.

1905
01:13:27,671 --> 01:13:31,274
I think we're all gonna die!

1906
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,577
- I'm gonna bust you guys

and I have a renewed
sense of purpose.

2087
01:22:32,915 --> 01:22:35,184
And you're probably asking,
well, what about Ron?

2088
01:22:35,251 --> 01:22:36,319
What about him?

2089
01:22:36,385 --> 01:22:38,054
If you're asking me
as a deputy,

2090
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:41,124
I have no idea about Ron.

2091
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:43,492
If you're asking me as Clemmie

2092
01:22:43,559 --> 01:22:45,861
the woman, the goddess, um,

2093
01:22:45,928 --> 01:22:47,396
of course I know
exactly where he is.

2094
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:48,564
I'm not stupid.

2095
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:50,566
I know a good thing
when I see it.

2096
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:53,469
Hey, handsome.

2097
01:22:53,536 --> 01:22:54,903
- Oh!
- [chuckles]

2098
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:58,074
- I waive my rights.

2099
01:22:58,141 --> 01:22:59,308
- I got to be honest.

2100
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:02,145
I took a lot of money from Q.

2101
01:23:02,211 --> 01:23:03,879
And I would do it again.

2102
01:23:03,946 --> 01:23:06,415
But don't worry,
I'm doing good things with it.

2103
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:09,685
I brought all my friends
along with me.

2104
01:23:09,752 --> 01:23:11,420
[all laugh]

2105
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:14,190
Hey, I'm sorry
I almost left you for dead.

2106
01:23:14,257 --> 01:23:15,258
- Forget it.

2107
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:16,492
- It's all right.
- It's forgotten.

2108
01:23:16,559 --> 01:23:17,426
- The important thing is
you're here now.

2109
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:19,328
- We are a family.

2110
01:23:19,395 --> 01:23:20,896
- Familia.
- I love you guys.

2111
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:22,998
all: Cheers!

2112
01:23:23,066 --> 01:23:24,567
[all whoop]

2113
01:23:24,633 --> 01:23:26,769
- What a beautiful night
for an evening.

2114
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,072
- Oh, it sure is.

2115
01:23:29,138 --> 01:23:30,639
To us.

2116
01:23:30,706 --> 01:23:32,075
- Stand behind me like this.

2117
01:23:32,141 --> 01:23:33,542
- Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2118
01:23:33,609 --> 01:23:35,178
- Let's human centipede it.

2119
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:37,380
We'll do a human centipede
Titanic.

2120
01:23:37,446 --> 01:23:39,815
all:
Human centipede Titanic!

2121
01:23:39,882 --> 01:23:42,485
Human centipede Titanic!

2122
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:44,953
Human centipede Titanic!

2123
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,256
Human centipede Titanic!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

2124
01:23:47,323 --> 01:23:49,125
- Guys,
we're crushing her uterus.

2125
01:23:49,192 --> 01:23:51,960
We're crushing her uterus.

2126
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,629
- * Don't wanna stop *
- * And our hearts *

2127
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:56,299
* They beat as one *

2128
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:57,733
* Ooh, yeah *

2129
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,769
* No more love on the run *

2130
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:04,473
* Yeah *

2131
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:11,680
* *

2132
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:38,974
* Caribbean Queen *

2133
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:43,112
* Now we're sharing
the same dream *

2134
01:24:43,179 --> 01:24:46,949
* And our hearts,
they beat as one *

2135
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:48,651
* Oh, yeah *

2136
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:51,787
* No more love on the run *

2137
01:24:51,854 --> 01:24:53,822
* Yeah *
