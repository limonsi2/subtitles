How many fucking times

It's exactly what I'm
fucking saying right now!

00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:06,594
I'm hitting you
in two seconds, for real.

I'm gonna hit you in one second!

00:47:09,296 --> 00:47:12,801
I'm sick of your shit.
Stop talking so much.

28
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:20,508
- Get back in here, I'm not done talking to you.
- It's not... but...
