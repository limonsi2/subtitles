00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:08,875
PRESENT…

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Official YIFY movies site:
YTS.MX

4
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,041
Yeah, right?

5
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,666
What happened here?

6
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,625
Call the lawyers.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,208
What lawyers?

8
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:16,541
They told us to come to Miami,
so they must know something.

9
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,458
How long ago did you talk to mom?

10
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:21,500
A few weeks ago.

11
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,875
- What about you?
- Me too.

12
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,083
Don't post that on Instagram.

13
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,708
Don't be paranoid.

14
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,541
What do you think would happen
if everyone finds out

15
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,541
that the owner of the most important
mental hospital in Mexico

16
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:43,625
is living like this?

17
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:47,541
They'll think that the crazy ones
escaped from the madhouse.

18
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,166
- Lollipop…
- Okay, Fine.

19
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,125
I won't post anything,
but it makes me depressed.

20
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,958
And don't call it a madhouse.
Mom doesn't like it.

21
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,041
Is she even here?

22
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,625
At least there's wi-fi.

23
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,416
When was the last time you came here?

24
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,666
When I came for the vacations.

25
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,458
Two months. And was it like this?

26
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,250
Marco…

27
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:33,708
Where will mom be?

28
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,458
April 5, today I turned 21.

29
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,833
And like all my birthdays
I can't stop thinking about my legacy.

30
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,750
I wonder what Hendrix, Cobain,

31
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,041
Joplin and Morrison would do
if they were here.

32
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,541
It's funny how things happen.

33
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,541
In the morning when I heard
"private plane" and "Miami,"

34
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,625
I felt the creativity of leaving my body.

35
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,541
When I entered the house, I was inspired.

36
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,041
I'm glad I can do this on my birthday.

37
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,125
This is the perfect place.

38
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,875
Did you call the lawyers?

39
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,416
Yeah, but they don't answer.

40
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,791
Call them again.

41
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,875
You wouldn't believe what I found here.

42
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,958
Look what I found.

43
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,583
It's dad's chess.

44
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,250
Marco, I don't think I'm staying here.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,250
Then go to a hotel.

46
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,083
I'll call you when the lawyers call.

47
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,333
Look, it's rush hour.

48
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:23,791
If the lawyers don't answer in one hour,
we'll go to the office to find them.

49
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,666
I'm the whites.

50
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,333
APRIL 5, 19 YEARS OLD

51
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,625
Check.

52
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,708
Check.

53
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,000
You can't confuse me.

54
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,375
No, but I can eat your queen.

55
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,375
Attack, attack, attack…

56
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,500
That's all you do.

57
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,500
Sometimes you must let things happen.

58
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,458
Why? Because God's times are perfect?

59
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,333
You lost your rook.

60
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,250
He always has a plan.

61
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,375
Hello?

62
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,458
Telemarketer.

63
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:51,708
Checkmate.

64
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,833
The Lord is good
to those whose hope is in him.

65
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,166
Oh, no. Don't start with that bullshit.

66
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,416
- Hey.
- Mm?

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,541
There's some weirdo at the door.

68
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:10,791
Hello.

69
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,166
Hi. I'm Miguel Ángel.

70
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,958
Can I help you with something?

71
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,041
Today’s Friday and it's 5:30.

72
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,041
What do you need?

73
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:31,250
Hi, Miguel Ángel.
What can we help you with?

74
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:35,125
Dr. Elizabeth asked me
to come today at 5:30.

75
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,875
Dr. Elizabeth is unwell right now.

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They told me to come.

77
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,541
It's an email from the lawyers.

78
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,250
Come in.

79
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,625
I don't want to marry or have kids.

80
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,458
I'm not looking for fame
or my family's wealth.

81
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:31,500
I'm only passionate about my pictures.
That will be my biggest legacy.

82
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,958
My pictures and my death.

83
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,166
I'm Marco.

84
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,500
She's my sister, Danae,

85
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,833
and the spoiled one who left
is the youngest.

86
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,000
We call her Lollipop.

87
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,666
Do you want something to drink?

88
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,750
No, thanks.

89
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,916
That's my favorite book.

90
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,500
Why would an intelligent woman
like Dr. Elizabeth

91
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,916
waste her time on this book?

92
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,958
You don't believe in God?

93
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,708
If God existed,
broccoli would taste like Nutella.

94
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:15,083
But there are events,
miracles, so to speak,

95
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,750
that are more important
than the flavor of a vegetable.

96
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,083
Like your dad?

97
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,416
I wouldn't call that a miracle.

98
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,125
Matter of perspective.

99
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,750
And what's your perspective?

100
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,791
My perspective in this matter
is as irrelevant as my opinion

101
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,000
about God's existence.

102
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,500
Do you think God's existence
is irrelevant?

103
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,125
God's existence is highly important.

104
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,708
My perspective is irrelevant.

105
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,000
So irrelevant as it was my existence
for you a few minutes ago.

106
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:49,000
Luckily, his goodness is so powerful
that He takes care of everyone.

107
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,375
Including non-believers.

108
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,708
If God exists,
I wouldn't have become an orphan at 17.

109
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,916
We all go through difficult times.

110
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,416
It's difficult to know there's someone
called Gregorio and lives peacefully.

111
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,541
Some things are beyond our comprehension.

112
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,916
It's difficult to know
that no one cares that Gregorio

113
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,000
stabbed two people until they bled out.

114
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Gregorio…

115
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,166
every time I hear his name's like…

116
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,958
I can't believe he's still on my mind.

117
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,500
Your pain doesn't deny his existence.

118
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Ten years.

119
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,708
That was the age of Gregorio
when he stabbed them.

120
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,625
Now explain to me
who would have so much hate

121
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,708
at such a young age?

122
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,708
I'm so sorry about what happened.

123
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,041
You're right,

124
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,791
my pain doesn't deny his existence.

125
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,041
But if He really exists,
it says a lot about him.

126
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,833
All problems began
because Dinah made friends with

127
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,083
people who didn't follow
the laws of God.

128
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,625
I don't make those mistakes.

129
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,208
The lawyers should be arriving soon.

130
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,500
I think Lollipop should be here.

131
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,000
Lolli!

132
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,666
You're an idiot! Why are you doing this?

133
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,875
Are you serious?

134
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,958
You're a piece of shit!

135
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,125
You're crazy! What's this?

136
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,250
They're amazing.
They came out really good.

137
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:37,666
Don't you think?

138
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,416
That's definitely the best one.

139
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,583
You're insane.

140
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:59,250
The lawyers should be arriving soon,
and that crazy one is driving me mad.

141
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,583
I told you he was a crazy one.
I have a keen eye for that.

142
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,583
Crazy ones understand each other.

143
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,250
Dry well.

144
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:18,666
One can choose where to go on vacation,
where to work or what ice cream to eat,

145
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,833
but a few can choose when and how to die.

146
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,916
A few years ago I decided
I won't be those kinds of people.

147
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,958
Like them, I want to die at 27.

148
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,375
And like Cobain,
I'm planning to do it on April 5.

149
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,166
What happened?

150
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
I'll go.

151
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,208
And do you like to live in Miami?

152
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:07,916
I live in Mexico.

153
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,416
Vacations?

154
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,083
I could call it that way.

155
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,541
It's from the lawyers.

156
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:24,416
Let me show you the guest room.
You'll be comfortable there.

157
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,583
I'm good, thanks.

158
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,333
That's the elegant way
to tell you we want privacy.

159
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,041
Oh. Sorry.

160
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,625
A pen drive.

161
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,208
It's a video of mom.

162
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,583
If you're watching this,
it means I'm not in a good condition

163
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,083
or that maybe I'm not even here.

164
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,833
First of all, I want you to know
you're my biggest legacy.

165
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's why I'm putting my second legacy
in your hands.

166
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,500
During all my life, I've been looking
for the unification of our family,

167
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,291
but I haven't succeeded.

168
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:47,625
In my final effort, I've decided to leave
three envelopes in my safe box:

169
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:51,291
a green, yellow and red one.

170
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,083
Each one has different instructions
on how to divide my inheritance.

171
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,666
It's up to you to choose
which envelope you're going to open.

172
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,375
To make that decision,

173
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,750
I've enlisted the help
of three of my patients.

174
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,250
Each of them
knows the content of the envelopes.

175
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,208
It'll depend exclusively on them

176
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:18,166
to reveal the partial or complete
information of that content.

177
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:24,208
You have 12 hours to choose
one of the three envelopes

178
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,458
and communicate that to the lawyers.

179
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,250
Once you made the decision,

180
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,666
the other two envelopes
will be destroyed.

181
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,833
The chosen one will be immediately read
and executed.

182
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:41,666
The decision is solely and exclusively
up to you three,

183
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,166
and it should be unanimous.

184
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:46,958
Choose wisely.

185
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,291
The future of this family depends on you.

186
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:54,958
Mom's dead?

187
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,875
No, the lawyers would've told me.

188
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,750
What if she had an accident?

189
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,000
Don't worry. God will take care of her.

190
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,750
The important thing
is to find those patients

191
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,916
and know about the content
of the envelopes.

192
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I think the first one is already here.

193
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,208
Fuck! And we treated him like shit.

194
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,458
We?

195
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,541
What about you?

196
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,541
You couldn't see his face.
Your face almost said, "You make me sick."

197
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,083
And you treated him as he was a heretic.

198
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,291
You almost blamed him
of being Satan's son.

199
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,416
We need to do damage control.

200
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,333
Not necessarily.

201
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,458
Let's choose one of the envelopes.
We open it…

202
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,625
and we divide the content
among all of us as we agree right now.

203
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,291
And how do we know you'll keep your word?

204
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,500
Do you think I would screw you
for some dollars?

205
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,583
Not for some dollars,

206
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,041
but for the houses,
the book publishing rights

207
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,000
and the bank accounts in Switzerland…

208
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,083
- …totally.
- Hey! We're not the problem.

209
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,333
What makes you think
we're the only ones in the inheritance?

210
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,500
The crazy ones are keeping our fortune?

211
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,083
It's an option.

212
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,500
And not to mention
the future of the madhouse.

213
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,750
Don't call it that.

214
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,000
Madhouse, mental hospital, whatever.

215
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,791
Well, I'm sure a big part of the money
will end up there.

216
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,875
Do you think that's what mom meant
about the second inheritance?

217
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,166
Your middle name should be Sherlock.

218
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,666
Of course, she meant the madhouse.

219
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,458
Whatever that video says
that place is very important for her,

220
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,041
and we're not.

221
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,375
We need to find out about those documents.

222
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And where's mom?

223
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,666
Who do you think would be
the other two crazy ones?

224
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,500
DANAE'S PLAN

225
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,458
Very good, huh?

226
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,541
My turn, you'll see.

227
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,541
- Hey, that's three.
- You're good.

228
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,416
Hey! Do you want to play?

229
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,291
Who wants mezcal?

230
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,375
- Me!
- Me!

231
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,708
No, thanks.

232
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,416
No, you won't deny a drink in my house.

233
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,416
And you're playing with me. I never lose.

234
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,541
Okay.

235
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,416
Shot! Shot! Shot!

236
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,208
Shot.

237
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,333
Don't worry. Just throw it.

238
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,625
- Yes!
- Yeah!

239
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,625
What happened?

240
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:16,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
the champions, Miguel Ángel and Lollipop.

241
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,541
One round.

242
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,125
- What do you want for a price?
- Okay, me and you.

243
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,208
I…

244
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,291
A winner, right?

245
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,916
So? How was I?

246
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,625
You deserve an Oscar.

247
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,208
Do you think it worked?

248
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,166
We'll see.

249
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,291
Let's go for the knockout.

250
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,333
Cheers for that.

251
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,666
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

252
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,750
Miguel Ángel, can I ask you
a personal question?

253
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,125
You can ask,
but I can't promise I'll answer it.

254
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,666
Are you my mom's patient?

255
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,333
If it wasn't for Dr. Elizabeth,
I don't know where I'd be.

256
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:09,958
What did you have?

257
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,583
After my parent's death,
I found it hard to accept my life.

258
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,250
We feel the same way now.

259
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,208
We need you to help us with something.

260
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,916
About the green envelope?

261
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,708
All this show was for the green envelope?

262
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,125
Our future depends
on the content of that envelope.

263
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,166
Not only yours.

264
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,583
For one minute I bought it.

265
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,666
It wasn't a show.

266
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,750
"It wasn't a show."

267
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,583
Never in my life has a woman
looked at me the way you did.

268
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,625
It's sad you only did it
because you needed something from me.

269
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,541
Do you know how hard
you need to hit someone to stay like this?

270
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,875
That pain can't compare
to the way people see me.

271
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,916
The same way you did
when I walked through that door.

272
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,708
An immediate rejection…

273
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,375
because I'm different.

274
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,833
And because I don't look like you.

275
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,458
The lawyers.

276
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,500
Tell me what the documents say.

277
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,708
Marco…

278
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,000
Tell me what the documents say.

279
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,083
Marco, let him go.

280
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,208
Tell me what the documents say
or I kill you!

281
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,541
Marco, let him go, please!

282
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,625
Mom's arriving now.

283
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,875
Your 15 minutes of fame are over.

284
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,791
Lollipop, call an Uber so he can leave.

285
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,750
The lawyers asked all to be present
when mom's here.

286
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,958
Including you.

287
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,458
Fuck! You scared me.

288
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:52,458
Sorry.

289
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:54,958
You were horrible to me.

290
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,708
Have you ever seen a hummingbird?

291
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,541
Silent treatment, huh?

292
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:21,458
Can I play?

293
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:24,125
Do you think you deserve it?

294
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,458
Come on, let me play.

295
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,208
I promise I ate all the food,

296
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,083
and I promise I won't have
nightmares at night anymore.

297
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:48,833
My hand is numb.

298
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,166
Do you like it?

299
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,166
It's my favorite level.

300
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:09,958
- Did you lose?
- Yeah.

301
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,458
- My turn.
- No, please. One more.

302
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,208
You can't tell anyone you let me play.

303
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,666
Or he'll get mad.

304
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:47,583
If you keep my secret, I'll keep yours.

305
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:48,666
A secret?

306
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,250
This is my weak point.

307
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,333
Do you like it?

308
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,375
Now the two of us have a secret.

309
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,041
I also have a secret.

310
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:21,875
Are you going to tell me?

311
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:22,958
Yeah.

312
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,208
But you can't tell anyone.

313
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:28,958
Promise me. Especially him.

314
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,041
Who's him?

315
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:33,958
Miguel Ángel.

316
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,875
Are you going to tell Miguel Ángel
about this?

317
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:41,375
No.

318
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,333
If you don't tell, I won't either.

319
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,041
My name's María Gabriela.

320
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,458
I'm Gregorio.

321
00:25:58,583 --> 00:25:59,958
He's waking up.

322
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
Who?

323
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:03,666
The hand.

324
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:05,625
I told you it was asleep.

325
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,583
I know what's on the list.

326
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:12,833
What list?

327
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:15,583
The list on the yellow envelope.

328
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:16,791
You mean the green one.

329
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:21,791
No, the list on the yellow envelope
that has all the secrets of Dr. Elizabeth.

330
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,875
There were words for older people.

331
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,250
Try to remember, okay?

332
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,208
For me?

333
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,125
The list looks like
the one for Santa Claus.

334
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,416
Were there any presents for me?

335
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
No.

336
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,500
Were there any presents for you?

337
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,125
No.

338
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,208
Miguel Ángel won't let me have any.

339
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,833
He thinks I did something wrong,
but it wasn't me.

340
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:48,666
What did you do?

341
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,250
Nothing.

342
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,208
I promise I didn't do anything.

343
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,166
It was Francesco. Francesco is bad.

344
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,625
What about the presents? What were they?

345
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:00,625
I don't remember.

346
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,500
But I know where you can get them.

347
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:05,833
In the safe box.

348
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:08,458
Someone's coming.

349
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:13,875
The box in the room of Dr. Elizabeth?

350
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:17,541
Yeah, you can get the list there.
I know how to open it.

351
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:21,333
He's here.

352
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,000
I must go,
but please don't say anything, okay?

353
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:28,958
Yeah, I promise.

354
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:32,291
Miguel Ángel!

355
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:35,458
Miguel Ángel?

356
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,708
Danae, Miguel Ángel fainted.

357
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,458
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing.

358
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:46,458
We were roleplaying and I don't know
what had happened to him.

359
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:47,541
Playing what?

360
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,166
Roleplaying.
When you fake to be someone else.

361
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:52,916
He was faking being a kid.

362
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,708
Don't tell me you like him now.

363
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:56,041
I was following your plan.

364
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,916
I did everything you asked,
and he suddenly fainted.

365
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,458
- And the documents?
- That's all you care about?

366
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:03,250
Did he say something or not?

367
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:06,708
- He knows what's in the yellow envelope.
- Anything else?

368
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:08,500
We must call an ambulance.

369
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,291
And tell them what?

370
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,625
Mom's crazy patient fainted
while we were playing inheritance?

371
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,458
Marco. He knows what to do.

372
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:17,750
He's not here.
He went looking for information.

373
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:18,833
Where?

374
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,875
Some things are better left unknown.

375
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:22,833
Well, call him. We must do something.

376
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,250
It's Marco.

377
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,041
Did you find out something?

378
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,916
Things are worse than we thought.

379
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,125
We haven't been able
to make progress either.

380
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:33,791
We'll have to wait
for the other two crazies to arrive.

381
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:35,541
There's the story's twist.

382
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:37,458
Now what?

383
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:40,958
Miguel Ángel suffers from a dissociative
identity disorder.

384
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,666
Apparently, he has three identities
and each one acts in different ways.

385
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,333
Is he still confined
in the mental hospital?

386
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:51,208
Yeah, apparently mom's been
treating him for ten years.

387
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,333
What would a Mexican patient do in Miami?

388
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:57,375
I don't know. They arrived together
on the plane two weeks ago,

389
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,291
and she's been treating him from home.

390
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:02,416
Do you know if one of the identities
is a little kid?

391
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:05,000
Yeah, how do you know that?

392
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,458
Because I just met his second identity.

393
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:10,625
His name is Gregorio.

394
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:11,958
Gregorio?

395
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,000
The same one who killed his parents?

396
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:22,958
I'm 15 minutes away from home.
I'm going as fast as I can.

397
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,833
Did you find out something about mom?

398
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,708
Fuck! I just passed a police car
and they turned on their lights.

399
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:32,291
I must go. Whatever you do,
be very careful with him.

400
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,166
- Let's go.
- Okay.

401
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,583
I hope you like mojitos.

402
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:15,958
Are you okay?

403
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:18,625
My nose started bleeding.

404
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:22,666
The last thing you need is a stranger
messing up your house with blood.

405
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:30,458
What? Do you want a picture?

406
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:32,416
No, it's just you're very beautiful.

407
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:34,791
You must be Danae.

408
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:36,666
And you, Lollipop.

409
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,041
And you are…?

410
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:42,166
Francesco.

411
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:47,500
Dr. Elizabeth's patient for a long time.

412
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:52,500
When was the last time
you were with Dr. Elizabeth?

413
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:59,083
Which of you two
is going to be my next victim?

414
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,583
I just learned how to prepare mojitos.

415
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:10,583
They might be bitter,
but I promise they taste good.

416
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:12,708
Do you want some?

417
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,333
No? To Dr. Elizabeth.

418
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,250
Let's get to the point, ladies.

419
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:36,916
I know exactly what's on the red envelope,
and if you want that information,

420
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:39,000
it'll cost you some money.

421
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:40,916
Finally, a version I like.

422
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,000
And the package isn't so bad.

423
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,041
Business first.

424
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:50,625
In exchange for helping you,
I want 50% of the inheritance.

425
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,083
Don't be ridiculous.

426
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:55,416
I'd rather lose it all instead
of giving you half of my inheritance.

427
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,958
Two percent and I'm not suing you
for being an extortionist.

428
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:02,250
You think I'm here to negotiate, but no.

429
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:06,541
No, you're not understanding.
No crazy one is going to screw me.

430
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,333
Oh, you're really got some ovaries.

431
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:14,666
You make me want to take you to the room
and have a roll in the hay.

432
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,875
Poor you.

433
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,416
You won't even handle me for two minutes.

434
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:22,625
Your commission just decreased to 1%.

435
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
I know who you are.

436
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:28,416
Gregorio told me.

437
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,375
So, you already met that snuffy one.

438
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:37,083
And I'm sure all those works of art…

439
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,750
I can imagine my epitaph:

440
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:48,208
"Murdered by some Lollipop
while her sister was grabbing his balls."

441
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:50,166
And what do you prefer?

442
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:52,916
"Buried for screwing the wrong person"?

443
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:59,125
Here's where you put the ice pick.

444
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,291
See?

445
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:07,041
Five percent.

446
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:08,666
Deal.

447
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:22,416
You stay with the houses in Mexico City,
the American bank accounts and the boat.

448
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:26,708
A consortium of doctors
gets exclusive rights to the books

449
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:28,916
that will only go to finance them.

450
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:30,583
What about Marco?

451
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:33,041
He gets nothing.

452
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:37,666
The other envelopes must have something
similar but excluding us.

453
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:42,958
So, you don't know what's
on the other envelopes?

454
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,625
You need me more than you think.

455
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:50,708
Hello?

456
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:57,583
Hi.

457
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,666
You must be Francesco.

458
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,958
And you must be Marco.

459
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,625
Let her go if you don't want
things to get worse.

460
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:10,416
She smells really nice.

461
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,833
Come here.

462
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
See who it is.

463
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:25,125
It's Oscar and mom.

464
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,875
Let go of the ice pick and get rid of it.

465
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,291
And you stay calm.

466
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:44,666
Oscar?

467
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,125
What happened to mom?

468
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:50,208
I don't have that information.

469
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:52,291
Your lawyers told me to bring her.

470
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:55,375
Do you want me to leave her in her room?

471
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:59,416
No, it's okay. You can leave now. Thanks.

472
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,250
Bye. Bye, Elizabeth.

473
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:29,791
- Mom!
- Mom!

474
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,208
Are you okay?

475
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,708
- What happened to you, mom?
- Mom?

476
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:42,083
Enough.

477
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:44,208
We have homework to do.

478
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,416
We know what's in the red envelope.

479
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:49,875
Check the documents.

480
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,875
I'm overdue for a chat
with our guest of honor.

481
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:17,875
Mom?

482
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,666
Hey, Miguel Ángel?

483
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:28,916
ELIZABETH'S SECRETS

484
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,416
Where did Marco get so much information?

485
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:46,625
You always wanted to control us.

486
00:36:55,958 --> 00:37:00,250
According to these records, Francesco's
last appearance was almost five years ago.

487
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:06,750
Apparently, he only appeared
in high-stress and dangerous situations.

488
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,416
And for some reason,
he always had a nosebleed.

489
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,875
That only happened to Francesco.

490
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,125
Much better.

491
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:49,291
What do you want?

492
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:53,625
Nothing.

493
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:55,541
Everyone wants something.

494
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:02,041
Why would I help you instead
of the patients?

495
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:06,250
Oh, so that's what you want. Vengeance.

496
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:09,791
Justice.

497
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:13,208
Bankrupting us seems like justice to you?

498
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,208
Better you than the mental hospital.

499
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,333
So, you do want something.

500
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:22,708
Let's negotiate.

501
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,833
We've been negotiating
since I walked through that door,

502
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:30,583
but you didn't know about it.

503
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:36,916
Look, if you want power and vengeance,

504
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,333
I'll be your best ally.

505
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,458
What about your sisters?

506
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:46,291
My "God is perfect"
and "twerking's queen"?

507
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:50,083
Please, don't tell me you believed
she was making you horny.

508
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,333
What do you suggest?

509
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,333
Cash.

510
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,166
In advance.

511
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:07,958
What about the hospital?

512
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:13,125
I'll guarantee you the funding,
but I must have control over all of this.

513
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,333
I can help you keep control.

514
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:29,333
But I'll need you to do some things
that maybe your sisters won't agree to.

515
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:47,791
Physical abuse from his parents,
psychological abuse at school,

516
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,541
acute psychological trauma
because of the toxic environment.

517
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:53,375
An unlucky guy.

518
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,083
The hospital's totally bankrupted.

519
00:39:57,291 --> 00:40:00,750
The only income comes exclusively
from the books' selling.

520
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:02,166
How can that be?

521
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:06,958
Misappropriation of funds,
several negligence lawsuits,

522
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:12,083
and one from an inappropriate relationship
with a patient.

523
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,250
Someone's been misbehaving.

524
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:29,916
Dr. Elizabeth,

525
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:34,000
what would your friends think
if they found out about this?

526
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:45,708
If we choose the wrong envelope,
we'll get thrown out onto the streets.

527
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,416
No, don't say that.

528
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:50,958
The books mom wrote
are the only source of income.

529
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,041
If we only inherit the hospital…

530
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,708
We'll inherit the debts.

531
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:58,375
In months we could have nothing.

532
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,750
We must find out
what's on the other envelopes.

533
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:09,958
Lollipop…

534
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:13,500
please go and see if you're luckier
with Miguel Ángel.

535
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,208
Any news?

536
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,958
Now we're going to bet your inheritance?

537
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:49,208
I'm done talking to you,
but I must be here.

538
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,083
So, I'm going to have fun.

539
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:53,791
Come.

540
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,833
I don't do this on a whim.

541
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:06,833
You have to believe me.

542
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,333
Everything will be okay.

543
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:13,125
In a few hours, everything will be solved.

544
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Start.

545
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:30,583
Why him?

546
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,583
Because she can control him.

547
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:35,458
Control is her specialty.

548
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:37,166
Then abuse is.

549
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:39,833
Maybe she feel sorry for him?

550
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:42,791
More than sorry,
to have gone through the same.

551
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,166
What are you talking about?

552
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:50,125
People think the deepest connections
are through happy moments,

553
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,666
but suffering is the most powerful magnet.

554
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,250
Screams, hits…

555
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:03,500
you're basically describing
her relationship with dad.

556
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:05,541
You're hallucinating.

557
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:11,166
Are you saying dad used to hit her?

558
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:16,666
You never realized after dad's death
she never fell from the shower ever again?

559
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,833
That her make-up became lighter?

560
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:33,458
That's why Miguel Ángel
said his death was a miracle.

561
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:39,666
How's it that he knows so much about us?

562
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,333
What did you do, mom?

563
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,875
For many years I felt guilty
for everything she went through.

564
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:51,208
We were just kids.

565
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:52,750
What could we do?

566
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:58,833
But now that I see her sitting,
a part of me is happy that she can't move.

567
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:03,750
Okay, two out of three.

568
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:18,625
A dangerous move.

569
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:23,416
One who doesn't risk,
neither wins nor loses.

570
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,083
Oh, no.

571
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,916
Just where I wanted.

572
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:58,041
Oh, no.

573
00:44:58,625 --> 00:44:59,625
Done.

574
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:01,208
No one beats the champion!

575
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:03,416
Calm down, we're one to one.

576
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:06,333
Of course not.

577
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:08,958
- You haven't beaten me.
- Stop playing.

578
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:10,875
One to one and no cheating.

579
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,000
What are you talking about?

580
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:16,458
Okay, one-nil in your favor.

581
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:18,958
Should we heat up this game?

582
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:21,416
Okay.

583
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,250
If I win, you kiss me.

584
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:26,708
Oh, so naughty.

585
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,750
- And if I win?
- I kiss you.

586
00:45:31,916 --> 00:45:32,958
Such a clever boy.

587
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:36,041
If I win, you show me a magic trick.

588
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:38,541
Okay.

589
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:50,916
Here.

590
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:55,666
She looks like a rag doll.

591
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,958
We're running out of options.

592
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:04,583
I have an idea, but it's a risky one.

593
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:09,375
Would you be willing to use some violence?

594
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:14,875
Only as a last option.

595
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:19,791
They have a special connection,

596
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:23,666
and I think we can use that against them.

597
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,791
Oh, no.

598
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:34,708
You got me trapped.

599
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:41,833
Ha! I won.

600
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:52,333
Hey, calm down.

601
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,041
It was just a kiss.

602
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:56,583
Okay.

603
00:46:57,708 --> 00:47:00,833
So you don't say I'm bad,
I'll show you a magic trick.

604
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:09,875
Where are we going?

605
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,666
Show me how this opens.

606
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:25,916
I can't be here.

607
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:30,625
Don't worry, we're here alone.

608
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:32,291
I won't tell anyone.

609
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,166
No.

610
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:37,125
Please, Gregorio, help me.

611
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:39,000
All the answers are in the Bible.

612
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,416
There's no time for praying.

613
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,916
"And his soul was drawn to Dinah
the daughter of Jacob…"

614
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Stop praying.

615
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:46,583
"…and spoke tenderly to her."

616
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:47,708
Please, help me.

617
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:50,083
"…defiled his daughter Dinah…"

618
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,500
Open the box, Gregorio.

619
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:53,375
"…because he was in love with Dinah."

620
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:56,708
Gregorio, if you don't open the box,
I won't be your friend anymore.

621
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:57,791
He's here.

622
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:00,166
Please don't say anything to him.

623
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:13,250
Identities can't communicate between them.

624
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:16,125
We must take advantage of that weakness.

625
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:20,625
He fainted again.
I need you to help me move him.

626
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:43,208
I tried with her birthday,
passport number, lucky numbers…

627
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:44,666
Nothing worked.

628
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,750
Mom!

629
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Mom's diaries.

630
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:21,500
January 12, the patient arrived.

631
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:25,708
There was an energy
of emotions among all doctors.

632
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:30,041
It was our first case of dissociative
identity disorder.

633
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:36,375
July 5, the identity changes
occur more often.

634
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:40,416
Until now, we've detected three.

635
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,958
After constant abuse from his parents
and his inability to defend himself,

636
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:46,791
Francesco arises.

637
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:51,750
December 15,
we managed to lock Francesco up.

638
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:54,458
He hasn't appeared in several months.

639
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:59,291
There's an optimistic air
among all doctors.

640
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:07,916
"March 18, Gregorio kept arising,
but he stopped talking to all doctors.

641
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:11,708
If I can't talk to him,
the doctors will give up the case.

642
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:14,166
I keep fighting to rescue him."

643
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,416
We're running out of time.

644
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:30,500
Lollipop, we have an idea,
but we all must agree to it.

645
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:39,666
MARCO'S GAMBIT

646
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,500
Blood will push him to remember the trauma
of his parent's death.

647
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:50,541
That should make him
susceptible to telling us the truth.

648
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:53,791
We don't have time for more games.

649
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:04,916
Miguel Ángel.
Miguel Ángel.

650
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:15,125
Miguel Ángel, we need to know
what's in the envelopes.

651
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:19,833
Don't make me use this.

652
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,041
If you don't do this for yourself,
do it for her.

653
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,375
Do you see the suffering
you're causing to her?

654
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:39,916
And for what?

655
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:46,541
We know you're not a hero.

656
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:49,208
Stop pretending.

657
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:54,458
You never learned to defend yourself.

658
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:58,333
That's why you had Francesco.

659
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:02,416
But we got rid of him.

660
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,000
Soon or later, we'll find your weak point.

661
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,125
Miguel Ángel.

662
00:52:24,416 --> 00:52:27,833
Miguel Ángel.

663
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,625
Enough. We ran out of time.

664
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:37,125
I'm sorry, Lollipop.

665
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:39,416
No!

666
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,916
- Please, say something!
- How long do you think she'll last?

667
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,541
You're going to kill her!

668
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,625
If you can't handle this,
there's the door!

669
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,333
No money deserves this.

670
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:53,750
I swear by Dinah, I'll kill you.

671
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:55,833
Dinah? Who's Dinah?

672
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:02,958
That happens when you don't go to mass.

673
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:05,916
So, now all the answers are in the Bible?

674
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:11,375
We have them where we wanted.

675
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:13,541
Now you can begin to talk.

676
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,958
BIBLE + DINAH

677
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:25,291
GENESIS 30:21

678
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:32,000
WHEN SHECHEM SON HAMOR
THE RULER OF THAT AREA, SAW HER

679
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:35,541
HE TOOK HER AND RAPED HER

680
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:42,416
AND HIS SOUL WAS DRAWN TO DINAH
THE DAUGHTER OF JACOB

681
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:46,250
HE LOVED THE YOUNG WOMAN
AND SPOKE TENDERLY TO HER

682
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,750
"But the Lord is faithful,
and he will strengthen you

683
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:06,500
and protect you from the evil one."

684
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:16,291
"The devil prowls around
like a roaring lion

685
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:17,958
looking for someone to devour."

686
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,791
"Resist the devil,
and he will flee from you."

687
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:30,625
What the fuck are you doing? Speak now.

688
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:56,666
He's bleeding.

689
00:54:58,541 --> 00:54:59,541
Francesco.

690
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:13,916
You still don't have the information.

691
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,458
When are the lawyers arriving?

692
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:24,666
They're close.

693
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:31,583
If you don't have a unanimous decision
as soon as you open the safe box,

694
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:33,875
a protection clause will be activated.

695
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:36,500
What does the clause say?

696
00:55:38,416 --> 00:55:42,833
You lose all the goods,
and they go to the hospital.

697
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:30,666
"A house divided against itself
cannot stand upright"?

698
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:40,833
I WANT TO KILL YOU

699
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:42,750
He knows nothing.

700
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:45,583
I managed to open the safe box.

701
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:47,750
There was only one picture.

702
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,791
All of this was mom's games?

703
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,125
Yes.

704
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:00,708
I swear I know nothing.

705
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:56,083
You're not my mom.

706
00:57:58,708 --> 00:57:59,708
No.

707
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:01,750
No, I'm not your mom.

708
00:58:02,416 --> 00:58:04,625
I'm Dr. Elizabeth.

709
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,583
Do you remember me?

710
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:15,708
I need you…

711
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:18,583
to be quiet.

712
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:20,166
Keep it down.

713
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:25,250
Outside there are very bad people.

714
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,083
What do those bad people want?

715
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:30,791
Hurt us.

716
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:34,916
I don't want to be here.

717
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:36,416
I know.

718
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:38,125
I know you don't want to be here.

719
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:42,541
But I'm going to need you
to call Francesco.

720
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:46,791
No. No, Francesco's evil.

721
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:48,416
I know he's evil.

722
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:54,083
I'm going to help you,
but I need you to call Francesco.

723
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:56,250
But I'm scared of Francesco.

724
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,750
Call Francesco.

725
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:01,041
Now!

726
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,083
Elizabeth.

727
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:17,625
I'm a failure as a doctor
and as a mother.

728
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:20,333
But I'm alive because of you.

729
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:23,958
My biggest fears have come true.

730
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:27,583
I need you to do me a favor.

731
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:30,458
Whatever you need.

732
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:33,375
Protect me from my children.

733
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:36,416
Whatever it takes.

734
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,375
Mom?

735
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:56,625
God… what a disappointment.

736
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:03,916
You raised us.

737
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:13,958
Yeah,

738
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:17,125
maybe that's why
I'm partly to blame, right?

739
01:00:19,541 --> 01:00:20,541
Now what?

740
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:25,125
"Now what"?

741
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,041
That's what I've been thinking
since you slapped me downstairs.

742
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,250
Do you blame me?

743
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:40,333
Inheriting so much money and power
is a huge responsibility.

744
01:00:41,458 --> 01:00:44,083
That's why I needed to know
if you were ready.

745
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:51,166
All of this was one of your games?

746
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:54,083
What about the documents?

747
01:00:55,541 --> 01:00:57,125
The documents don't exist.

748
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:01,583
The plan was for you
to work together with Miguel Ángel

749
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:03,500
so you could all benefit.

750
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
So, we didn't lose the inheritance.

751
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:08,083
Oh, son.

752
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,291
You were always
the slowest one of the three.

753
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:18,041
All this was a test to see how we treated
Miguel Ángel and his identities.

754
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:19,333
Very good.

755
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:21,208
What else?

756
01:01:21,416 --> 01:01:23,791
We have the type of personality
that connects

757
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:25,583
with his two secondary identities.

758
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:28,916
Me with Francesco,

759
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:31,583
and you with Gregorio.

760
01:01:31,666 --> 01:01:33,000
And Miguel Ángel?

761
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:34,375
Kryptonite.

762
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:42,083
Each of you connected
with your lowest instincts

763
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:45,208
and revealed the worst inside you.

764
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,875
Which leads us to the initial question.

765
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:49,791
"Now what?"

766
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:56,291
When the lawyers arrive,
I'll write my real will.

767
01:01:57,041 --> 01:01:58,041
What about us?

768
01:01:58,125 --> 01:02:01,250
My responsibility as a mother
is to take care of you

769
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,208
and teach you the best I can.

770
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,541
But that will only last
until the day I die.

771
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:14,416
So, pray that it doesn't happen so soon.

772
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:22,583
Now, if you excuse me,
I'll take this shit out of me.

773
01:03:06,791 --> 01:03:08,583
You didn't keep your end of the deal.

774
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:14,083
Were you looking for this?

775
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:21,666
All of this?

776
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:24,708
My mom tricked you.

777
01:03:25,916 --> 01:03:26,916
She manipulated you!

778
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:31,416
You can't help me anymore.

779
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:56,958
Danae, you scared me.

780
01:04:58,125 --> 01:05:01,458
We know we made a mistake,
but you can't do this to us.

781
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:04,750
A mistake?

782
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:08,041
All that happened there was…

783
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
a mistake?

784
01:05:10,416 --> 01:05:13,833
What did you want us to do?
You put us in an impossible situation.

785
01:05:14,416 --> 01:05:15,625
Not torturing me.

786
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:17,166
Just an example, I don't know.

787
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:24,416
The lawyers will arrive soon.

788
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,708
If I let that happen, we lose everything.

789
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:31,166
Danae, put down that gun.

790
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:33,083
You put us all in danger.

791
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:35,041
Francesco was controlled.

792
01:05:35,625 --> 01:05:36,958
I didn't mean him.

793
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:41,416
Over and over,
you saw how he entered my room

794
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,750
and knew what he was doing perfectly.

795
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:47,750
Your father paid for all his actions.

796
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,416
Do you remember the night
you entered the room and saw him?

797
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:55,291
It was the worst night of my life.

798
01:05:56,875 --> 01:05:57,875
Yours?

799
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:01,666
You looked at me in my eyes

800
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,125
and I thought everything
will be finally over.

801
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:07,666
And what did you do?

802
01:06:11,041 --> 01:06:12,208
I closed the door and…

803
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:15,458
I left.

804
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,791
Lollipop sleeping in the next bed.

805
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:23,958
Thank God she was just a kid.

806
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:26,333
Can you even imagine
what he would do to her?

807
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:28,833
That was the night where I decided it.

808
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:33,750
Lollipop asked me every night,
"Why daddy doesn’t play with me?"

809
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:36,625
What do you think?

810
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:39,583
What happened to your father
was a miracle?

811
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,291
It wasn't God who did it.

812
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,875
It was me who did it! It was me!

813
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:15,666
What did you do?

814
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:19,375
I couldn't let her kill you.

815
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:27,333
I need you to do me a favor.

816
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,166
Another one?

817
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:35,791
I need to talk to Miguel Ángel.

818
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:39,458
I'll lock him up.

819
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:42,250
We cannot leave any loose ends.

820
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:48,083
Like the doctors did with me?

821
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:51,291
Forever?

822
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,125
I love you, Elizabeth.

823
01:07:57,291 --> 01:07:58,375
And I love you.

824
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:18,125
Are you okay?

825
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:21,833
Do you remember
when we locked Francesco up?

826
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,541
We can't do that again.

827
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,000
Close your eyes.

828
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:41,958
I need you to look for the key.

829
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:44,750
I got it.

830
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:46,750
Very good.

831
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:50,583
Now go to the secret room.

832
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:54,333
No, don't be scared.

833
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:57,916
I'm here with you.
Nothing bad will happen to you.

834
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:01,666
I'm there.

835
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:04,666
Close the door.

836
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:07,708
Give me the key.

837
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,416
That's right.

838
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:15,000
I'm very proud of you.

839
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:16,250
Now, get out of there.

840
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,541
How many fingers do you see?

841
01:09:32,791 --> 01:09:33,791
Two.

842
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:35,333
Where are we?

843
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:39,208
Miami's house.

844
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:41,666
What's your name?

845
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Miguel Ángel.

846
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:48,041
That's right.

847
01:09:48,833 --> 01:09:52,333
Now leave me alone so I can wash my face.

848
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:42,041
The mental hospital is the only place
where they treat me as a human being.

849
01:10:43,666 --> 01:10:47,458
Give me some minutes
to grab all of this, please.

850
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:53,791
All these years I've felt disgusted
with what we are.

851
01:10:55,541 --> 01:10:57,833
But you taught us to overcome our fears.

852
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:01,791
Francesco?

853
01:11:03,666 --> 01:11:05,458
I won't let you destroy him.

854
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:10,416
Where's Miguel Ángel?

855
01:11:12,083 --> 01:11:13,958
Miguel Ángel won't be able to help you.

856
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:16,750
No, you must release him.

857
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:20,375
It's very dangerous
to lock the primary identity.

858
01:11:21,416 --> 01:11:23,375
Elizabeth…

859
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:28,083
After all these years
you still treat me as an idiot?

860
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:30,041
You must believe me.

861
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:32,291
Miguel Ángel isn't locked up.

862
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:39,541
While you were distracted
playing with us as guinea pigs,

863
01:11:40,916 --> 01:11:42,583
we learned how to accept ourselves.

864
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:45,041
And most importantly,

865
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:48,541
we learned how to communicate
with each other.

866
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:52,791
We thank you very much.

867
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:55,166
From me,

868
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:57,958
Miguel Ángel and Gregorio.

869
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:00,958
We love you so much.

870
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,583
But you must die.

871
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:19,875
Three now.

872
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
One left.

873
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:50,833
Hi, María Gabriela.

874
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:53,958
Hi, Gregorio.

875
01:12:56,541 --> 01:12:57,541
Miguel Ángel.

876
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:04,458
Are you going to help
me to celebrate my 27?

877
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:06,791
Weren't you 21?

878
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:10,833
Francesco killed your parents, right?

879
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:16,041
How did you do it to forgive him?

880
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,208
More than forgiveness…

881
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:23,500
I understood that if it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be here.

882
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:25,916
I don't know how I'm going
to forgive my family.

883
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:31,166
Lollipop, you must go now.

884
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:35,791
I'm perfect here.

885
01:13:37,541 --> 01:13:39,958
Call Francesco, please.
I must talk to him.

886
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:08,000
I think you should've listened
to Miguel Ángel.

887
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:12,833
I need you to do me a favor.

888
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:16,375
Do you want me to sing you
"Las Mañanitas"?

889
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,125
If I wanted to celebrate it,
I would've called Gregorio.

890
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,958
He's the funniest one of you three.

891
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:26,875
How did you know we communicated?

892
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:30,291
Because Miguel Ángel
called me María Gabriela,

893
01:14:30,625 --> 01:14:32,583
and I only used that name with Gregorio.

894
01:14:36,166 --> 01:14:37,166
So what?

895
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,583
Are you going to help me?

896
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:49,833
What are those marks?

897
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:57,166
Only your imagination.

898
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:12,958
I want to look exactly like the pictures.

899
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:31,750
Why?

900
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:36,375
You took my family away from me.

901
01:16:37,791 --> 01:16:39,875
I won't let you
take my dreams away from me.
