{\an8}<i>[scoffs] Yes, I can, man.</i>
<i>That was a lot of hard work.</i>

00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,093
{\an8}<i>Well, you aced it.</i>

98
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,177
{\an8}<i>And so did you.</i>

99
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,055
{\an8}<i>I did okay,</i>
<i>but you were the valedictorian.</i>

100
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,974
<i>[chuckles] Hey, that's right.</i>

101
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,269
<i>-[clicks tongue] Ah!</i>
<i>-[both laughing]</i>

102
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,605
<i>Let's get to your great-grandma's house.</i>
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

103
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,983
{\an8}<i>Hey, look, what is the rush, man?</i>
<i>Look, we…</i>

104
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:39,112
{\an8}<i>Dinner's not till seven.</i>
<i>We will get there. It will be great.</i>

105
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,907
{\an8}<i>I don't know what the rush is,</i>
<i>but I know what the delay is.</i>

106
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,410
{\an8}<i>-You don't wanna tell them.</i>
<i>-No, I don't.</i>

107
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,162
{\an8}<i>I don't wanna pressure you into this,</i>
<i>but it's 2021.</i>

108
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,081
{\an8}<i>We graduate in two days. They should know.</i>

109
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,959
{\an8}<i>I know, dude, I know. It's just that like…</i>

110
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,920
{\an8}<i>Look, my family is different, okay?</i>

111
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:56,921
{\an8}<i>Look at my family.</i>

112
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,632
{\an8}<i>My father is West Indian,</i>
<i>my mother is from Ireland,</i>

113
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,302
{\an8}<i>and I grew up in the Netherlands,</i>
<i>until my dad passed.</i>

114
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,387
{\an8}<i>And because my mom</i>
<i>had passed years earlier,</i>

115
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,639
{\an8}<i>I moved to Ireland</i>
<i>to live with my great-aunt Agnes</i>

116
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,142
{\an8}<i>until I came here to go</i>
<i>to a historically Black college.</i>

117
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,602
{\an8}<i>Now who's the one with the family</i>
<i>with the different opinions?</i>

118
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,563
{\an8}<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-It's Davi for the win.</i>

119
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,232
{\an8}<i>-You win. You win on that. You're right.</i>
<i>-[chuckling] Thank you.</i>

120
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,192
{\an8}<i>I do look forward to meeting them someday.</i>

121
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,194
{\an8}<i>Well, yeah. Well, let's not rush that.</i>

122
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,991
{\an8}<i>Mmm. So… so I can confront my family,</i>

123
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,785
{\an8}<i>but you can't confront</i>
<i>your great-aunt Agnes? Is that what I got?</i>

124
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,205
{\an8}<i>No, that's a completely different story</i>
<i>because I feel like your mom</i>

125
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,291
{\an8}<i>is really open-minded,</i>
<i>so she will be okay with this.</i>

126
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,208
{\an8}<i>-I know it.</i>
<i>-Ah.</i>

127
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,377
{\an8}<i>Okay, yeah, but my dad will not be.</i>

128
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,004
{\an8}<i>Well, to hell with your dad.</i>

129
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:41,215
{\an8}<i>Davi, why do you hate my dad so much?</i>

130
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,093
{\an8}<i>You really have to ask?</i>
<i>After all he did to you and your mom?</i>

131
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,679
{\an8}<i>See, you know, that's why</i>
<i>I'm not telling you nothin' else.</i>

132
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,014
<i>You don't forget nothing.</i>

133
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,975
<i>Look… [sighs] …he will be there tonight.</i>

134
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:55,063
<i>So please, whatever you do,</i>
<i>do not get into it with him.</i>

135
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,940
<i>Okay? Good?</i>

136
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,361
<i>-[woman] It's hot out here today.</i>
<i>-[Brown] I know, Cora. I was hotter.</i>

137
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,445
<i>[Cora] You was hotter?</i>

138
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,238
<i>[Joe] You ain't gonna</i>
<i>believe what happened.</i>

139
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,325
<i>Brown tried to go all rotisserie</i>
<i>on us and shit.</i>

140
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,743

141
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,703
<i>Cora, I don't wanna go to hell.</i>

142
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,538
<i>Hell, no. I don't wanna go.</i>

143
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:16,334

148
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,803
<i>He gonna be a jigga now.</i>
<i>He ain't finna eat no more chicken.</i>

149

<i>-[Brown] Yes--</i>
<i>-He put gasoline on--</i>

150
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,181
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-[Joe] He put everything on the grill--</i>

151
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,308
<i>Thought I was makin' it big, Joe.</i>
<i>I was makin' it big.</i>

00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,395
<i>-Wait a minute now--</i>
<i>-Well, your ass got burned big, big-time.</i>

153
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,437
<i>Are you all right?</i>

154
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,481
<i>Oh, yes. Thank you so much</i>

155
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,608
<i>I'm good, but my knee</i>
<i>been bothering me a little bit.</i>

156
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,443
<i>I gotta go to a doctor</i>
<i>and get it looked at.</i>

157
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,487
<i>Uncle Joe, I'm talking to Mr. Brown.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

158
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,783
<i>Ah, Cora, yes, I'm… Well, yes and no.</i>
<i>I'm not fine. It's like I went to hell.</i>

159
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,285
<i>-You went--</i>
<i>-Yes, I went to hell, and Madea was there.</i>

160
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,913
<i>And I said, "This definitely not</i>
<i>the right place for me."</i>

161
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,416
<i>-Ooh.</i>
<i>-Here.</i>

162
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,501
<i>Now you wanna bring him some damn water.</i>

<i>Hey, Cora. How you doin', baby?</i>

00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,175
<i>-Hey, Madea. Can you take this bag?</i>
<i>-Ooh, girl, I like that green dress.</i>

167
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,678
<i>I'm not gonna take nothing.</i>
<i>I like the dress though. [chuckles]</i>

168
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,138
<i>Aw, Madea, you can take this bag.</i>

169
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,931
<i>What the hell I look like to you,</i>
<i>a bellman?</i>

170
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,517
<i>Yeah, well, you look like</i>
<i>two or three bellmans if you ask me.</i>

171
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,477
<i>-She look like bells-men.</i>
<i>-[Cora] Would y'all--</i>

172
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,770
<i>She… she look like horsepower.</i>

173
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,606
<i>Say somethin' else, Joe.</i>
<i>Just shut up. Shut up while you livin'.</i>

174
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,983
<i>Shut up while you got your nuts.</i>

175
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,569
<i>Please, please shut up.</i>
<i>I'll put 'em in that nutcracker.</i>

176
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,279
<i>-Oh, Lord.</i>
<i>-Oh, Joe.</i>

177
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,031
<i>Madea, now look, I went to the store</i>
<i>to get everything we needed.</i>

178
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,784
<i>You could just hold this bag.</i>
<i>I had to drive way across town.</i>

179
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,619
<i>I know you had to drive</i>
<i>way across town, Cora.</i>

180
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,872
<i>Every time I go to the store,</i>
<i>something done burned down</i>

181
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,832
<i>or boarded up</i>
<i>'cause people protesting all over.</i>

182
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,749
<i>I don't understand</i>

183
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,626
<i>why they didn't burn up</i>
<i>the whole neighborhood.</i>

184
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,712
<i>We don't need that store.</i>
<i>We need to burn everything</i>

185
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,672
<i>in the neighborhood down.</i>
<i>Burn it all down.</i>

186
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,549
<i>Joe, what kind of sense it make to burn up</i>

187
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,385
<i>your own damn neighborhood</i>
<i>'cause you upset about something?</i>

188
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,513
<i>What the hell kind of sense it make</i>
<i>what these police doin' to Black people?</i>

189
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,849
<i>-Burn it all down.</i>
<i>-Oh, I'mma… I'm finna punch him.</i>

190
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:58,311
<i>Well, I'm just glad they didn't burn down</i>
<i>the church 'cause it's in the same block.</i>

191
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,230
<i>You know that's right, Cora.</i>
<i>Thank God that church did not burn down.</i>

192
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,690
<i>-Hallelujer.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

193
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,941
<i>-Hallelujer.</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>

194
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,110
<i>Hallelujer, thank God</i>
<i>that church didn't burn down.</i>

195
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,154
<i>Madea, I'm so glad</i>
<i>you standin' up for the church.</i>

196
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,071
<i>That's beautiful.</i>

197
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,199
<i>-I don't care nothin' about that church.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

198
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,326
<i>It's just right next door</i>
<i>to my favorite liquor store.</i>

199
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,828
<i>So, you more concerned</i>
<i>about the liquor store than the church?</i>

200
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,871
<i>That's wrong, Madea.</i>

201
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,956
<i>Nothing's wrong.</i>
<i>Here's what you don't understand.</i>

202
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,125
<i>-Jesus, the Lord God Almighty…</i>
<i>-Uh-huh.</i>

203
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,710
<i>He can turn water into wine.</i>

204
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,628
<i>-He did.</i>
<i>-Yes, he did.</i>

205
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,421
<i>I got to go</i>
<i>to the liquor store to get mine.</i>

206
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,257
<i>Won't somebody praise Him? [laughs]</i>

207
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,967
<i>What? You need to stop that foolishness.</i>

208
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,053
<i>Come on, Madea,</i>
<i>we gotta get started on this dinner.</i>

209
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,347
<i>That's all right, Cora.</i>
<i>We'll go to Red Lobster tonight,</i>

210
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,265
<i>and we come back here tomorrow</i>
<i>for the barbecue.</i>

<i>Yeah, oh, I like Red Lobster, yeah.</i>
<i>That's where me and B go all the time.</i>

00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,812
<i>Oh, B? Who is B?</i>

213
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,773
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,899
<i>-[chuckles]</i>
<i>-[flies buzzing]</i>

215
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,985
<i>-Give me that bag. Let's go in the house.</i>
<i>-Is it me, or is Mabel drawing bugs?</i>

216
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,113
<i>Would you stop that? I need y'all</i>
<i>to go get the stuff out the car.</i>

217
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,865
<i>Go on, get the stuff out the car.</i>

00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,924
<i>but she's gettin' off work.</i>
<i>She just got off duty.</i>

302
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,761
<i>[sighs] Okay. I worry about my sister</i>
<i>being a cop with all that's goin' on.</i>

303
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,139
<i>Me too, sweetheart. I worry about her.</i>

304
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,724
<i>-Know what I worry about?</i>
<i>-[Cora] What?</i>

305
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,684
<i>-I worry about her comin' up in here.</i>
<i>-Why?</i>

306
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,478
<i>With all these damn warrants I got,</i>
<i>every time I see her, I be worried.</i>

307
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,564
<i>I be like, "Baby don't come up in here."</i>

308
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,649
<i>"I wanna hug you, but don't frisk me."</i>

309
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,527
<i>I know that's your daughter,</i>
<i>but Lord have mercy, Cora. Mm-mm.</i>

310
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,528
<i>[chuckles]</i>

311
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,990
<i>-Well, she just be looking out for you.</i>
<i>-No, no. I… I got too many warrants.</i>

312
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,576
<i>Sylvia's a lawyer.</i>
<i>She can help you out with that.</i>

313
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,493
<i>[Cora] Yeah.</i>

314
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,829
<i>Last time Brown tried to help me,</i>
<i>I went down to court,</i>

315
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,039
<i>they told me that I had to, uh… uh, pay a…</i>

316
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,833
<i>What they call… what they call…</i>
<i>Oh, a fine.</i>

317
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,168
<i>-I gotta pay a fine.</i>
<i>-[Laura] Oh.</i>

318
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,587
<i>I'm like, "You want me</i>
<i>to pay a fine to get a driving license</i>

319
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,088
<i>so I can get insurance?"</i>

320
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,506
<i>"After I done bought my damn car?"</i>

321
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,802
<i>Hell, no, I'm not finna to pay a fine, my…</i>
<i>No. We not do… we don't pay no fines.</i>

322
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,721
<i>They gotta catch me first.</i>

323
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,765
<i>You getting too old for that, Madea.</i>

324
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:49,351
<i>Sometimes you gotta get</i>
<i>some thrills in your life. Do crazy stuff.</i>

325
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,687
<i>I don't wanna die old and…</i>
<i>That's what's keeping me young.</i>

326
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,189
<i>-Running from the police.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

327
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,690
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-Is that the trick?</i>

328
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,902
<i>-Yes. That keep your heart strong.</i>
<i>-[Cora] Don't listen to her.</i>

329
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,987
<i>-You be like this all the time.</i>
<i>-[Cora] Don't listen.</i>

330
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,239
<i>-You been teaching me wrong.</i>
<i>-Don't you listen to that.</i>

331
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,909
<i>-I need some warrants and tennis shoes.</i>
<i>-That's right. That's right.</i>

332
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,787
<i>No, but I called Tim,</i>
<i>and he said he's on his way as well.</i>

333
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,747
<i>-[squeals]</i>
<i>-Yes, my grandbaby.</i>

334
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,792
<i>My baby is graduating.</i>
<i>Oh my God. Can you believe that?</i>

335
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,668
<i>Oh, he said</i>
<i>he wants to tell us an announcement</i>

336
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,754
<i>in front of the whole family</i>
<i>while he here so…</i>

337
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,548
<i>-What you think it is?</i>
<i>-I have no idea, but…</i>

338
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,718
<i>Whatever it is, you know it's good news.</i>
<i>We all know Tim's a great kid.</i>

339
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,179
<i>-His mama did a good job.</i>
<i>-Yes, you did.</i>

340
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,514
<i>In spite of that daddy.</i>

341
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,808
<i>Ooh, baby, don't talk about him.</i>

342
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,393
<i>Speaking of that,</i>
<i>how you doin' after that divorce?</i>

343
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,188
<i>-Lord have mercy.</i>
<i>-Yes, 'cause we know it was bad.</i>

344
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,648
<i>-I'm fine.</i>
<i>-That's good.</i>

345
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,316
<i>-You sure?</i>
<i>-I'm really good. I am.</i>

346
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,236
<i>No, 'cause after that divorce,</i>
<i>you was just looking… [voice drops] …bad.</i>

347
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,278
<i>-Madea!</i>
<i>-What?</i>

348
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,698
<i>-She was just looking… [voice drops] …bad.</i>
<i>-[Cora] Yeah, 'cause we know it was bad.</i>

349
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,617
<i>I'm good. I really am.</i>

350
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,661
<i>Sylvia, she represented me,</i>

351
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,497
<i>and without her I don't know</i>
<i>where or what I would be right now.</i>

352
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,582
<i>Well, I just wish</i>
<i>I could've gotten you more.</i>

353
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,669
<i>What'd I tell you? I told you she</i>
<i>wasn't gonna be able to do right by you.</i>

354
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,670
<i>What do you mean?</i>

355
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,506
<i>How she gonna do right by her</i>
<i>when she going through the court system?</i>

356
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,758
<i>If you go through the court,</i>
<i>they tell you what to do.</i>

357
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,011
<i>How the hell a judge gonna make</i>
<i>a decision on what you could and can't do?</i>

358
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,389
<i>Hell no to the judge.</i>
<i>I ain't going with the judge.</i>

359
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,308
<i>You should've come to me.</i>
<i>I'd have got you half of everything.</i>

360
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,853
<i>I'd have got you half of the sofa--</i>
<i>Ask somebody.</i>

361
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,313
<i>In 2004, I took a chainsaw to some shit.</i>

362
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,190
<i>-You better ask somebody.</i>
<i>-I know that's right.</i>

363
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,276
<i>There's the legal way,</i>
<i>then there's the Madea way.</i>

364
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,819
<i>That's right. That's right.</i>

365
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:25,239
<i>Right, exactly. Don't follow her tr--</i>
<i>Don't do that. Don't do that.</i>

366
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:29,243
<i>Oh, sorry. But you look like this divorce</i>
<i>is not affecting you at all, sweetie.</i>

367
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,036
<i>-I'm so happy for you.</i>
<i>-Unbothered.</i>

368
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,706
<i>-That's right. You look so good.</i>
<i>-[Madea] No.</i>

369
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,374
<i>-But she do look good.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

370
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,543
<i>-[Cora] What?</i>
<i>-You look good, but some… Mm-mm.</i>

371
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,878
<i>Uh-uh what?</i>

372
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,256
<i>Baby, after somebody had a divorce,</i>
<i>and they go through a bad, rough time,</i>

373
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,134
<i>and they start looking this good,</i>
<i>they usually done found somethin' else.</i>

374
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,470
<i>When you're trying to get over something,</i>
<i>they slip under a man with legs wide open.</i>

375
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,764
<i>-Madea!</i>
<i>-Cora, I can say what I wanna say.</i>

376
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,268
<i>All that money I spent helping that girl</i>
<i>pay for that boy to go through college.</i>

377
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,311
<i>"All that money"?</i>

378
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,854
<i>Yes, I spent…</i>

379
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:57,897
<i>What? How much was…</i>

380
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,232
<i>-I got to go… I got to add it up.</i>
<i>-[Cora] Please add it up.</i>

381
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:04,737
<i>It was $37.95, is what I sent to you</i>
<i>to help put that boy through school.</i>

382
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,280
<i>What's she gonna do with $37?</i>

383
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,866
<i>Ain't about where it come from.</i>
<i>It's what you had to do to get it.</i>

384
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,242
<i>-I see.</i>

388
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,918
<i>[Madea] Go on, get that ready.</i>

389
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,128
<i>-You're right.</i>
<i>-[Cora] I'm gonna slice these tomatoes.</i>

<i>Y'all do not have to keep thanking me.</i>

409

<i>Tim, boy, I am so proud of you.</i>

420
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,778
<i>[Joe] I got a question.</i>

421
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,155
<i>-[Cora] What is it?</i>
<i>-Why all these Negroes in this house?</i>

422
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,490
<i>-Is this a homicide?</i>
<i>-[Cora] No--</i>

423
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,616
<i>Y'all need to go home.</i>

424
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,036
<i>Uncle Joe, watch your mouth.</i>
<i>Did y'all finish everything outside?</i>

425
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,415
<i>I did the best I could.</i>
<i>I couldn't look at Brown's ass no more,</i>

426
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,666
<i>so I sent him home.</i>

427
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,127
<i>Brown went home</i>
<i>to wash the soot off his ass.</i>

428
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,964
<i>-Uh, I think it was soot.</i>
<i>-No, Joe, I don't know if that was soot.</i>

429
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,175
<i>I've known Brown a long time.</i>
<i>They call him Brown for a reason.</i>

430
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,927
<i>-Oh my Lord.</i>
<i>-[all laughing]</i>

431
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,095
<i>Oh Lord.</i>

432
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,223
<i>Hey, Uncle Joe.</i>

433
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,394
<i>I know damn well</i>
<i>you ain't come in here in that uniform.</i>

434
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,896
<i>[Cora] My baby can wear</i>
<i>her uniform if she wants.</i>

435
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,858
<i>She's an officer,</i>

436
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,484
<i>Thank you, Mama.</i>

437
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,861

<i>They'll back up in a minute</i>

442
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,622
<i>Tear up damn light poles, everything</i>
<i>to get away. You better ask me. I know.</i>

443
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,207
<i>[Joe] You need to take that uniform off</i>

444
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,002

449
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,102
<i>-[whispers] I'll tell you later.</i>
<i>-So you need to move that police car.</i>

450
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,438
<i>You know, I… I can actually arrest you.</i>

451
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,566
<i>And I'll protest all over your ass.</i>
<i>I'll protest all over your ass.</i>

452
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,525
<i>[Ellie] What for?</i>

453
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,863
<i>Violation of my civil right</i>
<i>on January 6th on the US Capitol.</i>

454
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,156
<i>That I can smoke weed</i>

455
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,365
<i>if the weed is right.</i>

456
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,493
<i>-[Cora] What?</i>
<i>-Tell your weed man to come see me.</i>

457
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,577
<i>What you gonna do?</i>

458
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,455
<i>-Bring him on over.</i>
<i>-Don't be threatening my weed man.</i>

459
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,083
<i>-I'll show you what--</i>
<i>-Threatening my weed man.</i>

460
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,628
<i>But, Uncle Joe, you would be</i>
<i>in the wrong. Weed is illegal here.</i>

461
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,588
<i>I got a subscription.</i>

462
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,091
<i>Uh, I… I think</i>
<i>you mean prescription, right?</i>

463
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,259
<i>-Right. Right.</i>
<i>-Who… who the hell is that?</i>

464
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,970
<i>-That's Tim.</i>
<i>-The educated one who we're celebrating.</i>

465
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,764
<i>Don't correct him. He's stupid.</i>

466
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,184
<i>I know what I said. Don't correct me</i>
<i>'cause you went to college.</i>

467
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,269
<i>I know what I'm saying.</i>
<i>I got a subscription.</i>

468
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,562
<i>Valedictorian.</i>

469
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,732
<i>Well, valedict your ass out of here</i>
<i>before you get kicked in it.</i>

470
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,359
<i>[Cora] What is wrong with you?</i>

471
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,861
<i>Now, you move that damn car right now.</i>

472
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,323
<i>I am not.</i>
<i>And tell your weed man, come see me.</i>

473
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:41,161
<i>You know what I'm gonna do?</i>
<i>If I count my joint, and I'm running low,</i>

474
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,790
<i>and I run out</i>
<i>'cause you here in your uniform, we… we…</i>

475
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,292
<i>-We gonna have a problem.</i>
<i>-[Ellie] You know what?</i>

476
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,669
<i>-I'mma go change…</i>
<i>-[Cora] Okay.</i>

477
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,462
<i>…before I have to arrest somebody.</i>

478
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,964
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

479
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,258
<i>-So that's my Uncle Joe.</i>
<i>-[Laura] Yes, that's Uncle Joe.</i>

480
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,468
<i>Come on, watch… watch this. Uncle Joe?</i>

481
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,469
<i>[Joe] What?</i>

482
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,012
<i>[Tim] How you doin'?</i>

483
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,683
<i>Uh, fair to middlin'.</i>
<i>Nuts don't work, but they still trying.</i>

484
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,144
<i>They'll crank out a little</i>
<i>now and then to make her happy.</i>

485
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,229
<i>Okay… Uh, I didn't need to know that.</i>

486
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,481
<i>What the hell you ask me for</i>
<i>if you didn't want to know?</i>

487
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,524
<i>-Fair enough.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

488
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,860
<i>-This is my friend Davi.</i>
<i>-[Davi] Hello, sir.</i>

489
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,445
<i>Get your hand away.</i>
<i>You ain't heard of COVID-1920.</i>

490
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,322
<i>I tried to tell you. [chuckles]</i>

491
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,408
<i>-[Davi clears throat]</i>
<i>-[Tim sighs]</i>

492
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,410
<i>Why… why you… why you talk so funny?</i>

493
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,995
<i>I'm from Europe.</i>

494
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,873
<i>Oh, you're from Europe?</i>
<i>That why your pants so tight?</i>

495
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,792
<i>What? Son, I can see your camel toe.</i>

496
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,835
<i>[chuckles]</i>

497
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:33,630
<i>-This is what our generation's wearing.</i>
<i>-What your generation is wearin'. I see.</i>

498
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,009
<i>Your generation</i>
<i>is turning nuts into nutmeg. Just powder.</i>

499
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,928
<i>Back in the day, we had nuts.</i>
<i>We had balls. We had sacks.</i>

500
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,890
<i>Now everybody just got powder.</i>
<i>Y'all ain't got no balls.</i>

501
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,642
<i>Y'all, everybody woke.</i>
<i>Y'all need to go back to sleep.</i>

502
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,478
<i>All right. Would you leave</i>
<i>my roommate alone, please?</i>

503
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,190
<i>Oh, your… Oh, he's your roommate?</i>

504
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,650
<i>-Yeah. Yeah.</i>
<i>-We share a dorm room on campus.</i>

505
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,612
<i>[Joe] Your uncle Peaches</i>
<i>shared a dorm room on camper too.</i>

506
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:01,408
<i>It was about, uh, 40 years he shared</i>
<i>that dorm room with that dude on camper.</i>

507
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,203
<i>He liked them tight britches.</i>
<i>He had a camel toe too.</i>

508
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,121
<i>Joe, leave them damn children alone.</i>

509
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,332
<i>Y'all get up and bring</i>
<i>them bags upstairs for your mama.</i>

510
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,917
<i>Don't be talking to that fool.</i>

511
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,002
<i>Go on upstairs. Get the bag right there.</i>

512
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,337
<i>-[Tim] Okay.</i>
<i>-Bring it upstairs.</i>

513
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,838
<i>Don't… don't hurt yourself.</i>

514
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,673
<i>Don't break your fingernail.</i>

515
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,009
<i>Don't strain your camel toe.</i>

516
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,345
<i>The hell is wrong with them?</i>

517
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,597
<i>[woman] Hootie-hoo!</i>

518
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,556

00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,046
<i>All of y'all was pretty.</i>

533
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,549
<i>-Even your mama was pretty.</i>
<i>-Yes, she was, but she was a ho.</i>

534
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,344
<i>-[Bam] She was.</i>
<i>-Just saying. It ain't my business.</i>

535
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,555
<i>Uh, somebody here invited a man.</i>

00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,439
<i>I'm not talking about me.</i>
<i>I'm talking about Laura.</i>

540
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:18,151
<i>-You seein' somebody, baby?</i>

541
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,946
<i>What? [splutters] Madea, just calm down.</i>

542
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,156
<i>Uh-uh. You back with him?</i>

00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,241
<i>Oh, absolutely not.</i>

544
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,952
<i>-But he is Tim's father.</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

545
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,246
<i>And Tim wanted him there,</i>
<i>so I said, "Yes."</i>

546
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,540
<i>No, ma'am. Did anybody think to ask me?</i>

547
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,125

<i>You gonna let that man come up in here?</i>

549
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,422
<i>That boy left you broke and had nothing.</i>
<i>And I was having to take care of you.</i>

550
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,841
<i>I gave you $37</i>
<i>to help put that boy through school.</i>

551
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,302
<i>You let him come in my house</i>
<i>when he ain't do nothing for you?</i>

552
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,887
<i>-Madea, you--</i>
<i>-He better keep his ass away from me.</i>

553
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,392
<i>Y'all better keep his ass away from me.</i>
<i>That's all I'm saying.</i>

554

<i>-I was ready.</i>
<i>-[Joe, Bam chuckle]</i>

599
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:35,205
<i>But if I could, I would've folded myself</i>

600
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,250
<i>Bam. you couldn't fold</i>
<i>yourself up in a pickup truck.</i>

601
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,586
<i>You may wanna ask</i>

602
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,090
<i>Oh yeah. He would know.</i>
<i>My daddy was a pimp. [chuckles]</i>

603
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:46,883
<i>[chuckles]</i>

604
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,387
<i>[Joe] What you batting your eyes</i>
<i>and fixing your hair for?</i>

605
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,889
<i>You bark…</i>
<i>Bam, you barking up the wrong trees.</i>

606
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,434
<i>Tapping you out. Be quiet.</i>

607
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,768
<i>Hush, haterer.</i>

608
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,022
<i>So, guys, you think</i>
<i>I could fit right here?</i>

609
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,149
<i>-Well…</i>
<i>-I think I can.</i>

610
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,608
<i>-I wanna see this.</i>
<i>-I think I can.</i>

611
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,861
<i>I may be able to.</i>
<i>I'll put that right here.</i>

612
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:06,778
<i>Okay.</i>

613
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,196
<i>-[Bam] Look at that.</i>
<i>-[Tim] Yeah.</i>

614
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,281
<i>[Bam] I got down there.</i>

615
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,909
<i>[chuckles] Squoze right on in there,</i>
<i>didn't I?</i>

616
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,829
<i>Just like an apple trying</i>
<i>to get through the eye of a needle.</i>

617
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,582
<i>[groans] Listen,</i>
<i>don't… don't sit like this.</i>

618
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,958
<i>Manspread.</i>

619
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,919
<i>Spread. Manspread…</i>
<i>Spread it out. Air it out.</i>

620
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,046
<i>-Air this out.</i>
<i>-[Tim exhales]</i>

621
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,799
<i>-[chuckles] Oh.</i>
<i>-The hell?</i>

622
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,261
<i>If I was just five years older…</i>

623
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,554
<i>What you talkin' about?</i>

624
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,474
<i>That's when</i>
<i>my double social security kick in.</i>

625
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,475
<i>Huh.</i>

626
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,268
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>-Mmm.</i>

627
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:42,022
<i>From when I worked</i>
<i>at the post office, licking stamps.</i>

628
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,148
<i>Oh hell.</i>

629
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:47,652
<i>Then at Party Central,</i>
<i>I was blowin' balloons.</i>

630
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,029
<i>-Mmm.</i>
<i>-[Bam] Sure was.</i>

631
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:52,949
<i>I was just lickin' and blowin'</i>
<i>and blowin' and lickin'</i>

632
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,618
<i>for about ten years.</i>

633
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,329
<i>-And I'm good at it too.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

634
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:01,666
<i>I don't know why I'm getting turned on.</i>
<i>I think I wanna send some mail out.</i>

635
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,668
<i>Okay.</i>

636
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,172
<i>Let me just save you</i>
<i>a whole bunch of time, okay?</i>

637
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,175
<i>They share a apartment.</i>

638
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,968
<i>Oh, you're roommates?</i>

639
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,970
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-You're just roommates.</i>

640
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,430
<i>-[Joe] Bam?</i>
<i>-Huh?</i>

641
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:20,810
<i>Remember Peaches and Harold</i>
<i>shared an apartment for 40 years?</i>

642
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,521
<i>-Oh.</i>
<i>-[Joe] Uh-huh.</i>

643
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:27,359
<i>Remember that time I was telling you,</i>
<i>you wanted to buy that Beetle Bug car?</i>

644
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,318
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

645
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:32,489
<i>And I said, "Don't get it</i>
<i>'cause the motor is in the back."</i>

646
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,408
<i>That's where all the power come from.</i>

647
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,787
<i>-In the back… side of it.</i>
<i>-[Tim groans]</i>

648
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,704
<i>[Joe] Right.</i>

649
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,498
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-[Joe] Uh-huh.</i>

650
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,291
<i>-Well…</i>
<i>-[Joe] Yeah.</i>

651
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,045
<i>-I'mma go on to the "back" yard.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

652
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,090
<i>-Yes. Well, I'mma go on and go.</i>
<i>-[Tim] Thank you for the card.</i>

653
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,424
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-We know.</i>

654
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,093
<i>-Joe?</i>
<i>-Yeah?</i>

655
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,010
<i>[Bam] Good luck.</i>

656
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,596
<i>I… I ain't got nothing to say to them.</i>

657
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,558
<i>-Hell y'all looking at?</i>
<i>-Uh…</i>

<i>-Okay.</i>

660
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,856
<i>Great. Uh, I'll give you a lesson in life.</i>

661
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,026
<i>In the morning, the sun will rise,</i>

<i>How did you know I was here?</i>

710
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,475
<i>That's why I was asking so many questions.</i>

<i>Joe, I heard her. What'd she say?</i>

729
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,224
<i>-Wait one damn minute.</i>
<i>-What… what… what…</i>

730
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,893
<i>What… what did you just damn say?</i>

731
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,021
<i>-She called us a bunch of niggers.</i>
<i>-Did I say something wrong?</i>

732
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,566
<i>What'd you mean, if you don't know</i>
<i>if you said something wrong?</i>

733

<i>Yeah, you said something wrong</i>
<i>up in this bitch!</i>

734
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,446
<i>No, she said "knickers."</i>

735
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,157
<i>-I heard her say we're a bunch of n-words.</i>
<i>-Oh no, no, no, no.</i>

736
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,783
<i>That's not what she said.</i>

737
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,286
<i>Don't tell me I didn't hear what I heard.</i>

738
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,247
<i>She said, "Y'all a bunch of niggers."</i>

739
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,958
<i>-No, no, no. "Knickers." "Knickers."</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

<i>Don't be calling us no niggers</i>
<i>up in this nigga.</i>

742
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,715
<i>Hold on, it's "knickers." It's underwear.</i>

743
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,968
<i>Yes, yes. It's "knickers."</i>
<i>These are knickers.</i>

<i>-[all exclaiming]</i>
<i>-Ooh!</i>

745
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,513
<i>[Joe] And she just damn flashed me.</i>

746
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,599
<i>Actually, that almost turned me on</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

747
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,602
<i>-[Bam] What'd it look like?</i>
<i>-[Joe] It looked like a knicker.</i>

748

<i>She don't shave.</i>

749
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,938
<i>Black is black. Completely black.</i>

<i>But I'm sorry.</i>

753
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,238
<i>Well, say that.</i>
<i>Hell, say panties or something.</i>

754
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,366
<i>Baby, them ain't no panties.</i>
<i>Them some big-ass drawers.</i>

755
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,870
<i>It's just… look, it's just a language gap.</i>
<i>That's all.</i>

756
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,873
<i>That language gap almost got you capped.</i>
<i>You better be careful here.</i>

<i>-You better not say that again.</i>
<i>-Well, you know, I--</i>

<i>-That's why the chairs like this?</i>

1059
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,511
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-I guess he gotta tell us something.</i>

1060
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,596
<i>[Laura] Ooh, all right, uh… [chuckles]</i>

1061
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,599
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>your Aunt Agnes is feeling too well.</i>

1062
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,561
<i>I'm fine, I'm fine.</i>
<i>I just… I just need some fresh air.</i>

1063
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,939
<i>-[Madea] Come on, sit down.</i>
<i>-Come on over here, fresh. Sit by me.</i>

1064
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,441
<i>Oh, uh, thank you very much, sir.</i>

1065
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,652
<i>[Brown laughing]</i>

1066
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,697
<i>-Fresh air. Maybe I get you sunglasses.</i>
<i>-Sit by me, girl.</i>

1067
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,366
<i>Tim, remember</i>
<i>when your great-grandmother shot that gun,</i>

1068
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,451
<i>and your father jumped</i>
<i>out of the way like a coward?</i>

1069
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,705
<i>-Now that was funny.</i>
<i>-There weren't nothin' funny about that.</i>

1070
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,791
<i>-Yes, it was, and I'm not your son.</i>
<i>-Hey, what are you doin'?</i>

1071
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,293
<i>-[Davi chuckles]</i>
<i>-[Tim] Stop it.</i>

1072
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,670
<i>Look at him, he's a coward. He's a loser.</i>

1073
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,630
<i>-Watch your mouth.</i>
<i>-Richard, what are you doing?</i>

1074
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,881
<i>Stop this, okay?</i>

1075
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,676
<i>-Who do you think you're talking to?</i>
<i>-I'm talking to you, little boy.</i>

1076
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,095
<i>-I'm old enough to be your father.</i>
<i>-What the hell goin' on?</i>

1077
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,972
<i>Davi, Davi, stop.</i>

1078
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,765
<i>-You act like you--</i>
<i>-This is about your son.</i>

1079
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,393
<i>I told you not come in here</i>
<i>with that mess. Now just stop.</i>

1080
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,645
<i>You act like you don't hear this boy</i>
<i>talking like that.</i>

1081
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,398
<i>-What are they arguing about?</i>
<i>-I don't know.</i>

1082
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:33,360
<i>He's sorry, okay?</i>
<i>Can we all just sit down and… and talk?</i>

1083
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,195
<i>I just… I need to tell you guys something.</i>

1084
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,947
<i>-I think that's a good idea.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

1085
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,617
<i>Yeah, we better do that</i>
<i>because y'all gotta get him outta here.</i>

1086
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,578
<i>Whatever you wanna tell us, you better</i>
<i>tell us quick to get him outta here.</i>

1087
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,331
<i>So whatever you have to say,</i>
<i>baby, say it, 'cause he got to go.</i>

1088
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,626
<i>-I'm runnin' out of patience.</i>
<i>-I came… I came here for my son.</i>

1089
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,586
<i>-I ain't come here for all this.</i>
<i>-[Bam] Hey, Tim.</i>

1090
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,422
<i>There's a lot of us</i>
<i>that don't want your Black ass here.</i>

1091
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:54,923
<i>-You understand?</i>
<i>-[Cora] Madea!</i>

1092
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,593
<i>He comin' up in here</i>
<i>with all that damn attitude.</i>

1093
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:01,055
<i>Baby, say what you gotta say</i>
<i>before I have to hurt your daddy.</i>

1094
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,098
<i>I'm not like your mama,</i>
<i>who gonna be all kind.</i>

1095
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,809
<i>-Shut up. Say what you gotta say, son.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

1096
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,604
<i>Are there gonna be guns again?</i>
<i>Because Mummy can't take anymore.</i>

1097
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:11,273
<i>-I would love to say no, but--</i>
<i>-[Madea] I can't make no promises.</i>

1098
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,734
<i>-I stay locks and loaded.</i>
<i>-[Bam] Probably.</i>

1099
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,985
<i>He's sorry.</i>

1100
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,528
<i>You ain't gotta apologize for me.</i>

1101
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:20,324
<i>You mad at her too 'cause of how she got</i>
<i>you in the divorce helpin' my sister?</i>

1102
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,825
<i>-She didn't get me.</i>
<i>-Please.</i>

1103
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,661
<i>-You better tell 'em.</i>
<i>-Can you stop?</i>

1104
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,120
<i>-Can you?</i>
<i>-Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1105
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,998
<i>You right. We talked about this.</i>
<i>I will try. I will try.</i>

1106
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:28,957
<i>[Madea] What the hell?</i>

1107
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,210
<i>-Wait, Mabel.</i>
<i>-I'm trackin' with you, Bam.</i>

1108
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:34,213
<i>-Right, right.</i>
<i>-We talked about this. What's goin' on?</i>

1109
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,923
<i>Are they not divorced?</i>

1110
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,301
<i>-Wait, now Irish is catchin' up with us.</i>
<i>-I need subscripts.</i>

1111
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:43,639
<i>I… I'm not fully caught up</i>
<i>'cause I don't know what, mm, is goin' on.</i>

1112
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,350
<i>Okay, look,</i>
<i>can we all just please listen to Tim?</i>

1113
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:49,978
<i>Please, this is about Tim, okay?</i>

1114
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,647
<i>Can you all just chill?</i>

1115
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,731
<i>All right, great.</i>

1116
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,650
<i>Tim, baby, you got the floor, okay?</i>

1117
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,985
<i>Maybe only ten seconds, but please go.</i>

1118
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:02,783
<i>I've done this before. [slurring speech]</i>
<i>My name is Agnes, and I am an alcoholic.</i>

1119
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,785
<i>-[Madea] That ain't what this is.</i>
<i>-Okay, sorry.</i>

1120
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,620
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Whatever you got to say, say it.</i>

1121
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,915
<i>Okay, um…</i>

1122
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,375
<i>Uh…</i>

1123
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:14,920
<i>Okay, uh…</i>

1124
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,381
<i>You got this.</i>

1125
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:23,846
<i>Uh, family, um, this is</i>
<i>really hard for me to say,</i>

1126
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,307
<i>and I've been struggling</i>
<i>with how to tell you this.</i>

1127
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,476
<i>So, uh…</i>

1128
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,271
<i>I'm…</i>

1129
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,606
<i>I'm just gonna say it.</i>

1130
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,276
<i>Uh, I'm…</i>

1131
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,238
<i>I'm… I'm gay.</i>

1132
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,366
<i>[sighs] So…</i>

1133
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,589
<i>That's it? That's all you wanna say?</i>
<i>Well, baby, we knew that.</i>

1134
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,549
<i>-[Bam] Right.</i>
<i>-We already knew that.</i>

1135
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:03,010
<i>Wait. You guys don't wanna talk</i>
<i>about me being gay?</i>

1136
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,262
<i>We been talking about that for years.</i>
<i>We all knew that.</i>

1137
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,515
<i>We all talked about it.</i>
<i>We were waitin' on you to say somethin'.</i>

1138
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,560
<i>We don't rush nobody. You come out</i>
<i>when you want to. That's fine.</i>

1139
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,896
<i>-You all right. We know that.</i>
<i>-Mom, really?</i>

1140
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,773
<i>[Madea] We knew when you was a little boy.</i>

1141
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:16,857
<i>We knew.</i>

1142
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,777
<i>Yeah, baby, when somebody love you,</i>
<i>it don't matter if you gay or not.</i>

1143
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,653
<i>They gonna love you anyway.</i>
<i>And we love you.</i>

1144
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,947
<i>-Your family loves you, okay?</i>
<i>-I'm so proud of you.</i>

1145
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,783
<i>[Madea] You ain't good at being down low.</i>

1146
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,785
<i>-Oh man.</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

1147
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:31,079
<i>-That's embarrassing.</i>
<i>-No, don't be embarrassed. Proud of you.</i>

1148
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,791
<i>-I love you, guys.</i>
<i>-[Madea] I love you too.</i>

1149
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,125
<i>But back to my question.</i>

1150
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,544
<i>Why the hell was y'all two talking?</i>
<i>What y'all talking about?</i>

1151
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,880
<i>-Tim.</i>
<i>-Richard, don't.</i>

1152
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,132
<i>Told you I didn't wanna come here.</i>
<i>But for you, I came.</i>

1153
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,343
<i>-[Sylvia] Richard.</i>
<i>-I came for you. No, I came for you.</i>

1154
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,385
<i>Damn this family.</i>

1155
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,054
<i>-Damn the family?</i>
<i>-[clamoring]</i>

1156
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,097
<i>I… I… I told you this wouldn't work.</i>

1157
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:52,893
<i>We're supposed to be celebrating</i>
<i>Tim tonight, okay? Can we focus on him?</i>

1158
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,354
<i>Now Sylvia, she wants</i>
<i>to beat around the bush.</i>

1159
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:58,315
<i>-I'm gonna be straight up and tell y'all.</i>
<i>-What are you doing?</i>

1160
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,025
<i>-We gettin' married.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

1161
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,485
<i>[Brown] Shut up!</i>

1162
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,153
<i>He getting married to your best friend?</i>

1163
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:08,617
<i>I am so glad that you are not refunded.</i>

1164
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,618
<i>[Madea] Refunded?</i>

1165
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:10,786
<i>[Bam] Yes.</i>

1166
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:14,540
<i>'Cause it's so good</i>
<i>to have a policeman right in your family</i>

1167
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,042
<i>for such a time as this.</i>

1168
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,710
<i>-It sure is. Thank you.</i>
<i>-[Brown] True.</i>

1169
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,963
<i>Just… just take a second.</i>

1170
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,798
<i>Laura, you gonna say something?</i>

1171
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,884
<i>Hell, no! You… Are you kidding me?</i>

1172
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,137
<i>Look, you need to get out now.</i>

1173
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,514
<i>Now.</i>

1174
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,474
<i>Ellie, sweetie…</i>

1175
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,934
<i>-[Ellie] Yeah--</i>
<i>-Sweet baby sis.</i>

1176
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,854
<i>It's all right. It's fine.</i>
<i>I'm happy for you two.</i>

1177
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:37,938
<i>[Madea] Stop that lyin'.</i>

1178
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,983
<i>Walk over there, punch that girl</i>
<i>in her throat and knock them teeth out.</i>

1179
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,569
<i>Then I'mma go and grab her</i>
<i>and knock her ass down.</i>

1180
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,404
<i>I got him.</i>
<i>You just do what you need to do.</i>

1181
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,072
<i>-[Cora] Madea!</i>
<i>-We all got your back.</i>

1182
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,907
<i>[Madea] Put them stilettos</i>
<i>down her throat.</i>

1183
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,785
<i>Madea, please. All right?</i>
<i>Everybody just chill out.</i>

1184
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,121
<i>Nobody's thinkin' and carin' about this.</i>

1185
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,832
<i>-This weekend is about my baby.</i>
<i>-[Cora] That's right.</i>

1186
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,209
<i>-I have waited for this a long time.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

<i>Graduating valedictorian.</i>
<i>This is Black boy joy at its finest.</i>

1188
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:06,800
<i>If we could please</i>
<i>act like family for two seconds.</i>

1189
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,303
<i>-Fake it till we make it?</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

1190
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,430
<i>That's fine, but they're not our family.</i>

1191
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,432
<i>[Madea] That's right,</i>
<i>not our family. Got to go.</i>

1192
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,349
<i>Got to.</i>

1193
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,476
<i>My son want me here.</i>
<i>I ain't goin' nowhere.</i>

00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,817
<i>-Madea! What are you doin'?</i>
<i>-What you say about stayin'?</i>

1198
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:24,943
<i>I guess we be goin'.</i>

1199
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,987
<i>I'll see you at graduation, son.</i>
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

1200
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,822
<i>All right. Let's go. Babe, let's go.</i>

1201
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,700
<i>[Bam] She's so pretty. [laughs]</i>

1202
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,660
<i>Cora, I got to pee.</i>

1203
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,662

<i>You and this girl talk every day</i>
<i>while she helping with your divorce.</i>

<i>When did they find time</i>
<i>to start dating, fall in love,</i>

1308

1661
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,006
<i>Richard, you judging me?</i>

1662
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:33,049
<i>Hell, yeah.</i>

1663
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,092
<i>I mean, you're seeing this child.</i>

1664
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,136
<i>-What? You couldn't find a real man?</i>
<i>-Richard.</i>

1665
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,847
<i>Apparently, she couldn't get one</i>
<i>when she ran up on your ass.</i>

1666
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,432
<i>Damn, this is funny.</i>

1667
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:43,934
<i>[Laura] You standing there</i>
<i>with my best friend,</i>

1668
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,686
<i>but you think this is funny.</i>

1669
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,730
<i>You wanna know what I find funny?</i>

1670
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:51,484
<i>Is how Sylvia helped me with my divorce,</i>

1671
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,029
<i>but you the one</i>
<i>who got away with everything.</i>

1672
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:56,947
<i>-There it is.</i>
<i>-[Bam] Tell him, Laura.</i>

1673
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,408
<i>-Tell it, Laura.</i>
<i>-I got your back, baby. Tell it.</i>

1674
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:01,827
<i>You wanna know what else I find funny?</i>

1675
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:04,872
<i>How I'm gonna go down to her law firm</i>
<i>and tell them what she did.</i>

1676
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,750
<i>And that this is ineffective council.</i>

1677
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,753
<i>And then I'mma haul</i>
<i>your ass down to the court</i>

1678
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:13,380
<i>and get everything I got coming to me.</i>

1679
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:16,133
<i>Then we gonna see</i>
<i>who get the last "ha ha."</i>

1680
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,302
<i>Yeah, I'm seein' him.</i>

1681
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:20,596
<i>And let me tell you, this 26-year-old</i>

1682
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,432
<i>is more of a man than you've ever been.</i>

1683
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:26,393
<i>And probably more of a man</i>
<i>than you ever can be.</i>

1684
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:28,229
<i>This man sees me.</i>

1685
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:29,814
<i>This man hear me.</i>

1686
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:33,192
<i>And this man reminded me</i>
<i>that I'm alive and I can stand on my own</i>

1687
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:34,902
<i>before you tried to gut me.</i>

1688
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:39,198
<i>So maybe you can take some lessons</i>
<i>from this little 26-year-old</i>

1689
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,158
<i>with your little triflin' ass.</i>

1690
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,702
<i>-She went off on him, didn't she?</i>
<i>-[Bam] Yeah.</i>

1691
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,412
<i>-She went off.</i>
<i>-[Brown] That's terrible.</i>

1692
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:48,040
<i>I guess she told you, stuck-ass.</i>

1693
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,291
<i>That boy…</i>

1694
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,711
<i>-That boy is--</i>
<i>-Is gonna be her husband.</i>

1695
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:53,838
<i>[Brown] Oh.</i>

1696
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,297
<i>Oh. What?</i>

1697
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,049
<i>-Oh.</i>
<i>-Wait a minute now.</i>

1698
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:57,967
<i>What happened?</i>

1699
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,510
<i>-Baby.</i>
<i>-Ooh.</i>

1700
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,889
<i>[Bam] Oh crap!</i>

1701
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,393
<i>This is no time for Black Lives Matter.</i>

1702
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,478
<i>Don't do that romantic shit.</i>

1703
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:12,898
<i>Player, don't do the romantic…</i>
<i>He on one knee.</i>

1704
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,275
<i>Davi, please.</i>

1705
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,153
<i>Say you'll marry me.</i>

1706
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:26,453
<i>Say yes.</i>

1707
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:28,914
<i>Say yes.</i>

1708
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,376
<i>And go!</i>

1709
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:34,628
<i>What the feck is going on?</i>

1710
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,966
<i>-I think it's beautiful.</i>
<i>-She's old enough to be his mother.</i>

1711
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:41,886
<i>Nobody ever won a race</i>
<i>in a second-hand car.</i>

1712
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,512
<i>But he loves her.</i>

1713
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,891
<i>What would you know about love?</i>
<i>You couldn't get yourself a feckin' man.</i>

1714
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:47,975
<i>Arse.</i>

1715
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,565
<i>-[Davi] Say yes.</i>
<i>-I gotta go.</i>

1716
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:56,525
<i>No. [chuckles]</i>

1717
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,445
<i>That's embarrassing as hell.</i>

1718
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:00,529
<i>[Brown chuckles]</i>

1719
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,534
<i>Baby, I think that's a no.</i>

1720
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,038
<i>[sighs] I see.</i>

1721
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:11,874
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1722
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,752
<i>-[Bam] She said, "I'm sorry."</i>
<i>-[Brown] She said, "I'm…"</i>

1723
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:16,670
<i>You could've said something.</i>

1724
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,547
<i>[Bam] She said, "I'm sorry."</i>

1725
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:19,506
<i>[Brown] Yes.</i>

1726
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,343
<i>-That's like the </i>Runaway Bride.
<i>-What the hell was that? Poor baby.</i>

1727
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:24,220
<i>[Bam] Mabel, leave him alone.</i>

1728
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,096
<i>[Joe] She didn't have to do you</i>
<i>like that, man.</i>

1729
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,140
<i>I'm sorry. You down there</i>
<i>on one knee. I'm sorry.</i>

1730
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,517
<i>-That's embarrassing.</i>
<i>-She could've said something.</i>

1731
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:33,771
<i>-Somethin' to him. Damn, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>-She didn't want to.</i>

1732
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:36,106
<i>-I'm sorry.</i>
<i>-That's none of your business. Eat.</i>

1733
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:38,859
<i>What the hell y'all watching them for?</i>
<i>Eat something. Hell.</i>

1734
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,653
<i>All up in my family business.</i>

1735
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:44,365
<i>Well, can you pass me a beer?</i>

1736
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,495
<i>-[Ellie] Laura?</i>
<i>-I don't wanna talk about it.</i>

1737
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,538
<i>-Baby--</i>
<i>-Look, I love him.</i>

1738
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:53,082
<i>Why didn't you say anything?</i>

1739
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:56,835
<i>[sighs] There's just too much going on.</i>

1740
01:10:56,919 --> 01:11:00,297
<i>What? You gotta figure out</i>
<i>what you wanna do.</i>

1741
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,550
<i>I didn't mean to hurt him.</i>
<i>I didn't mean to hurt him.</i>

1742
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:06,512
<i>Well, then the only person</i>
<i>who can fix this is you.</i>

1743
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:09,306
<i>So fix it.</i>

1744
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:11,767
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

1745
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:26,407
<i>I didn't ask y'all</i>
<i>to bring y'all children here.</i>

1746
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,492
<i>This is a party for adults, half adults.</i>

1747
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:30,286
<i>-Not all adults.</i>
<i>-[flies buzzing]</i>

1748
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,620
<i>Flies.</i>

1749
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,914
<i>I should have changed me drawers.</i>

1750
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:34,915
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1751
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,960
<i>Ooh, Agnes. You funny child. [chuckles]</i>

1752
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:39,378
<i>I need more "chocolate."</i>

1753
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,921
<i>-Do you?</i>
<i>-This stuff isn't kickin' in.</i>

1754
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,339
<i>I'm thinkin' about giving you one,</i>

1755
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,967
<i>but I want you to understand this,</i>
<i>and hear me good.</i>

1756
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,052
<i>This chocolate,</i>
<i>you gotta be careful with it.</i>

1757
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,306
<i>I remember one time I had too much,</i>
<i>and it snuck up on me all at once.</i>

1758
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:54,059
<i>Next thing I know, I found myself</i>
<i>in Mexico chained to a mule named Arriba.</i>

1759
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,602
<i>-Oh!</i>
<i>-Yes, honey.</i>

1760
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:58,188
<i>I was selling tequila</i>
<i>from between my breasts there.</i>

1761
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:00,399
<i>Didn't know what happened.</i>
<i>So I'mma give you one,</i>

1762
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:03,610
<i>but you gotta be responsible</i>
<i>for what happens to yourself.</i>

1763
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,529
<i>-Just the one.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

1764
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:08,657
<i>I don't know if I should.</i>
<i>Maybe I shouldn't. [munching]</i>

1765
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,868
<i>-You know you should.</i>
<i>-What is he thinkin' of, Davi?</i>

1766
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:13,537
<i>He has to come back to Ireland.</i>
<i>His granddad needs him.</i>

1767
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,788
<i>What?</i>

1768
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:17,041
<i>That was the deal back then.</i>

1769
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:20,085
<i>When Davi's parents passed away.</i>
<i>Lord rest them.</i>

1770
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,754
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, rest them.</i>

1771
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:26,008
<i>-I'll never forget his last words.</i>
<i>-Mmm. What was it?</i>

1772
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,509
<i>"Oh feck, it's a bus!"</i>

1773
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,595
<i>[both laughing]</i>

1774
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,347
<i>-Yeah. But…</i>
<i>-Well, it'll kill him.</i>

1775
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:35,517
<i>When they passed, the deal was</i>
<i>that Davi's granddad would run the farm</i>

1776
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,519
<i>until such time as Davi was old enough</i>

1777
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,480
<i>and the time was right</i>
<i>for him to take over.</i>

1778
01:12:39,563 --> 01:12:40,898
<i>And the time is right now.</i>

1779
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:42,191
<i>-Oh.</i>
<i>-And he knows it.</i>

1780
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:44,485
<i>Oh, that's sweet. That's so sweet.</i>

1781
01:12:44,568 --> 01:12:46,862
<i>But what if his heart</i>
<i>wants something else now, baby?</i>

1782
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:47,905
<i>Feck his heart.</i>

1783
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:51,283
<i>Sometimes I'm sorry I had six children.</i>

1784
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:55,329
<i>Listen, baby, these children</i>
<i>have their own lives to live, honey.</i>

1785
01:12:55,412 --> 01:13:00,042
<i>-You got to let them live their life.</i>
<i>-I know, but they owe us.</i>

1786
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:03,379
<i>You can't tell me that your Cora</i>
<i>doesn't owe you something.</i>

1787
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,130
<i>[scoffs] Hell, yeah, she owe me.</i>

1788
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:08,133
<i>All them years I had to spend</i>
<i>on that pole trying to take care of her.</i>

1789
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:11,720
<i>Do you know how many splinters</i>
<i>I had to get removed from my inner thighs?</i>

1790
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:12,805
<i>Splinters?</i>

1791
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:16,683
<i>They didn't have brass poles back then.</i>
<i>Hos got it so easy right now.</i>

1792
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:19,186
<i>Back in the day,</i>
<i>all we had was telephone poles.</i>

1793
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:20,562
<i>And they didn't shellac em'.</i>

1794
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:23,941
<i>You had to get on and ride that thing</i>
<i>and spin around and get that money.</i>

1795
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:27,194
<i>And I did. I paid for it.</i>
<i>Today my inside look like hell.</i>

1796
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:29,029
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1797
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:30,364
<i>But I paid. I… I took…</i>

1798
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:33,367
<i>Listen. I had to do</i>
<i>what I had to do, but I did it.</i>

1799
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:35,536
<i>He has to come back and run that farm.</i>

1800
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:38,330
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>
<i>What if that ain't his dream?</i>

1801
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,541
<i>Feck his dream. He has to run that farm.</i>

1802
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:44,586
<i>How you gonna feel if that boy's</i>
<i>sittin' there runnin' the farm,</i>

1803
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:47,005
<i>milking all them bulls,</i>
<i>and he don't wanna be there.</i>

1804
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,340
<i>-Cows.</i>
<i>-Say what?</i>

1805
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,050
<i>Cows. Milking cows.</i>

1806
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,052
<i>Not milking a bull. Milking cows.</i>

1807
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,804
<i>Oh. Well, whatever the hell it is.</i>

1808
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:56,598
<i>What will it matter if he did</i>
<i>what you and his granddaddy want</i>

1809
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,268
<i>if his happiness is over here</i>
<i>in America with that girl?</i>

1810
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,145
<i>You know how hard it is to run a farm?</i>

1811
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,730
<i>How hard it is</i>
<i>to get a bull to mate with a cow?</i>

1812
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,899
<i>I had to French kiss a bull once.</i>

1813
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,025
<i>-[grunts]</i>
<i>-[Madea] Hmm.</i>

1814
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:10,529
<i>He wanted more, but I wasn't having it.</i>

01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:47,676
<i>Have fun. Just don't do nothin'</i>
<i>that's gonna ruin your life.</i>

1966
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:49,886
<i>But at least take some chances on love.</i>

1967
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:52,305
<i>That's love, baby.</i>
<i>That don't come around all the time.</i>

1968
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:53,557
<i>Yeah, I hear you.</i>

1969
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,516
<i>I'm just…</i>

1970
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:59,688
<i>Oh, I'm just scared. [exhales deeply]</i>
<i>I'm 12 years older than him, you know?</i>

1971
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:04,276
<i>I don't think it's age you worried about.</i>
<i>I think it's the heartbreak you done had.</i>

1972
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,152
<i>Let me tell you about heartbreak.</i>

1973
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:08,738
<i>It'll spit you out,</i>
<i>make you not wanna love nobody.</i>

1974
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:11,116
<i>It'll make you not wanna trust</i>
<i>nobody ever.</i>

1975
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,159
<i>That's what I tell women</i>
<i>when they get heart broke.</i>

1976
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:16,079
<i>If you get your heart broke,</i>
<i>please have the courage to try it again.</i>

1977
01:21:16,162 --> 01:21:18,748
<i>If that person break your heart,</i>
<i>have the courage to try it again.</i>

1978
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:21,251
<i>Next person break your heart,</i>
<i>have the courage to try it again.</i>

1979
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:23,461
<i>I'm gonna tell you,</i>
<i>you keep getting your heart broke,</i>

1980
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,338
<i>pretty soon you gonna run up</i>
<i>on a heart surgeon</i>

1981
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:28,049
<i>who know how to fix all them breaks</i>
<i>you done been through.</i>

1982
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,468
<i>That's why you can't just stop, baby.</i>

1983
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,929
<i>Love is worth fighting for.</i>
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

1984
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:33,847
<i>Yeah.</i>

1985
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,600
<i>So I get it. Get your heart broke,</i>
<i>don't wanna trust nobody else.</i>

1986
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:39,311
<i>Buildin' all them walls.</i>
<i>Let me tell you something about a wall.</i>

1987
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:43,023
<i>It'll keep everything out.</i>
<i>Stop building walls and build some fences</i>

1988
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:46,318
<i>so you can look over and see if that's</i>
<i>who you wanna see or not. Do you hear me?</i>

1989
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:49,195
<i>You're so wise.</i>

1990
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:51,531
<i>Thank you. I know.</i>

1991
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:52,949
<i>It's the weed.</i>

1992
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:55,201
<i>I'mma tell you this now,</i>
<i>speaking of wisdom,</i>

1993
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:58,496
<i>when you get married, make sure you</i>
<i>say "I do" to more than one person.</i>

1994
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:01,875
<i>"I do" to one person ain't gonna work.</i>
<i>You gotta say "I do" to several people.</i>

1995
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:03,043
<i>You understand?</i>

1996
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:04,294
<i>No, I do not.</i>

1997
01:22:04,377 --> 01:22:06,630
<i>That's why so many people</i>
<i>are getting divorced these days.</i>

1998
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:08,548
<i>They just say "I do" to one person.</i>

1999
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:11,259
<i>Okay, I… I'mma take back</i>
<i>what I said about you being wise</i>

2000
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,219
<i>'cause I feel</i>
<i>like you're going off the rails.</i>

2001
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:16,890
<i>If you was high, you'd be with me.</i>
<i>But let me break it down for you.</i>

2002
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:20,518
<i>When you marry somebody, ten years later,</i>
<i>that person gonna be somebody else.</i>

2003
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:23,563
<i>Ten years after that, somebody else.</i>
<i>People evolve. They change.</i>

2004
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,315
<i>That's why so many people</i>
<i>renew their vows,</i>

2005
01:22:25,398 --> 01:22:28,693
<i>'cause the person they say "I do" to</i>
<i>ain't the same person they with now.</i>

2006
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:30,612
<i>Do you hear what I'm telling you?</i>

2007
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:33,531
<i>Take a chance on love.</i>
<i>You gon' be all right.</i>

2008
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:35,992
<i>That boy too young to know,</i>
<i>but you old enough to understand.</i>

2009
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:40,121
<i>You old enough to know what I'm sayin'.</i>
<i>So, baby, y'all take your time, you hear?</i>

2010
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:42,374
<i>Now, if you don't mind, I was sewin'.</i>

2011
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:45,543
<i>I was, uh, net… net… I was net…</i>

2012
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:48,338
<i>Needle netting,</i>
<i>and I'd like to get back to it.</i>

2013
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:50,256
<i>-Would you mind just…?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

2014
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,384
<i>-Thank you. I love you.</i>
<i>-I love you too.</i>

2015
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:55,136
<i>You've been here a long time.</i>
<i>It's been over a day.</i>

2016
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,640
<i>-Almost time to go. [laughs]</i>
<i>-All right. I figured my time was up.</i>

2017
01:22:58,723 --> 01:23:00,517
<i>-Yeah, but I love you.</i>
<i>-I love you.</i>

2018
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,936
<i>-Talk to that boy, you hear me?</i>
<i>-I will.</i>

2019
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:06,272
<i>-[Madea] Okay. Talk to him.</i>
<i>-All right. Enjoy your weed.</i>

2020
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:08,191
<i>Eh… Oh… How you know?</i>

2021
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:10,318
<i>You think I didn't smell that?</i>

2022
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:16,282
<i>I got a prescription</i>
<i>'cause it ain't legal in Georgia yet.</i>

2023
01:23:16,866 --> 01:23:19,452
<i>Don't be telling your sister. Damn cop.</i>

2024
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:21,913
<i>[sighs]</i>

2025
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:30,755
<i>This park close at nine o'clock, son.</i>

2026
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:34,467
<i>Nine o'clock. They trying to gentle-fy</i>
<i>the whole neighborhood.</i>

2027
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:35,927
<i>Yeah. Gentrified?</i>

2028
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,430
<i>Yeah, that's when they try</i>
<i>to make everything gentle.</i>

2029
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:40,056
<i>Like gentrified?</i>

2030
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,434
<i>That's what I said, gentle.</i>

2031
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:44,811
<i>They gon' make it gentle.</i>
<i>It used to be rough.</i>

2032
01:23:44,894 --> 01:23:46,896
<i>That's why I go out and shoot in the air.</i>

2033
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,315
<i>I don't want nobody</i>
<i>to move here to make it gentle.</i>

2034
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:51,484
<i>-I like it rough, like it used to be.</i>
<i>-Got it.</i>

2035
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:54,154
<i>They come in here and raise</i>
<i>the property taxes and everything.</i>

2036
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:55,280
<i>Take over your damn house.</i>

2037
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:57,449
<i>Put basketball courts in,</i>
<i>change the neighborhood.</i>

2038
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:59,993
<i>Build pretty house all around.</i>
<i>I ain't selling shit.</i>

2039
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:01,369
<i>Gentrification.</i>

2040
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,415
<i>Whatever it is, I ain't selling.</i>
<i>I'mma hold on to what I paid for.</i>

2041
01:24:05,498 --> 01:24:06,875
<i>-Got you.</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>

2042
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:09,169
<i>Uh, Madea, is my mom still up?</i>

2043
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:10,211
<i>Why?</i>

2044
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,755
<i>I gotta talk to her.</i>

2045
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:14,424
<i>No, your mama done had a rough day.</i>
<i>Go on home.</i>

2046
01:24:14,507 --> 01:24:17,635
<i>-What about me?</i>
<i>-What about you? Don't go upsetting her.</i>

2047
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,304
<i>I'm not. I just wanna talk to her.</i>

2048
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:21,890
<i>You go home,</i>
<i>get ready for your graduation.</i>

2049
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:25,101
<i>Learn your speech, you understand?</i>
<i>Don't worry about this.</i>

2050
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:28,605
<i>Parents are not perfect.</i>
<i>Parents make all kind of mistakes.</i>

2051
01:24:28,688 --> 01:24:30,732
<i>Your mom, your dad. Children think,</i>

2052
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:33,568
<i>"My mom should've been better.</i>
<i>My dad should've been better."</i>

2053
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:35,153
<i>They did the best they could.</i>

2054
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:38,156
<i>Just growing up, raising children,</i>
<i>nobody tell them how to do nothing.</i>

2055
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,575
<i>Sometime people just doin'</i>
<i>the best they can, you understand?</i>

2056
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:42,786
<i>-Yes, ma'am.</i>
<i>-You had no idea they was together?</i>

2057
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:45,955
<i>No, I mean, like,</i>
<i>he… he talks about her a lot,</i>

2058
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:48,792
<i>but I… I… I just never put it together.</i>

<i>-[scoffs]</i>
<i>-Listen to me. Do me a favor.</i>

2068
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:12,982
<i>Don't try no cases right now.</i>
<i>Don't do no criminal cases.</i>

2069
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:15,527
<i>Get some slip and falls.</i>
<i>Something you can handle.</i>

2070
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:18,154
<i>-I'm just gonna go talk to her.</i>
<i>-No. I said it.</i>

2071
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:21,449
<i>You ain't gonna talk to her.</i>
<i>You gon' go home and rest for tomorrow.</i>

2072
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:23,868
<i>Make all of us proud</i>
<i>with your big ol' speech.</i>

2073
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:28,248
<i>I… I'm gonna go stay at a friend's house.</i>
<i>I… I can't even look at Davi right now.</i>

2074
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:31,000
<i>So come on, come on.</i>
<i>Go on home. Come on, come on.</i>

2075

<i>Leave that basketball.</i>

2076

<i>I don't want people saying</i>
<i>we stole it from the gentri-people.</i>

<i>-[Cora] Oh.</i>
<i>-[Richard] Yep.</i>

<i>-[Madea] Are you recording it?</i>
<i>-Yeah. [splutters]</i>

2170
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:28,988
<i>I spent all of last night mad.</i>

2171
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:32,825
<i>Mad at them. Mad that I didn't know.</i>

2172
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:36,621
<i>But then I… I… I realized that I, too,</i>

2173
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:38,539
<i>am harboring a secret.</i>

2174
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:41,084
<i>At… at… at least</i>
<i>I thought it was a secret.</i>

2175
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:43,628
<i>My whole family already knew.</i>

2176
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:45,046
<i>Yeah, we knew. We knew.</i>

2177
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:48,007
<i>You see, I'm gay,</i>

2178
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:51,344
<i>and I was really worried</i>
<i>about what they would think.</i>

2179
01:29:51,427 --> 01:29:53,179
<i>I didn't care what I thought.</i>

2180
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:56,724
<i>When I came out to them,</i>
<i>they showed me so much love,</i>

2181
01:29:56,808 --> 01:30:00,728
<i>and it… it just made me realize</i>
<i>how fortunate I am to have them.</i>

2182
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:05,483
<i>And so, as we start</i>
<i>this bright future of ours,</i>

2183
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:10,613
<i>I just want to take the time</i>
<i>to thank my mother, who always loved me,</i>

2184
01:30:10,696 --> 01:30:15,410
<i>stood by me, worked, did whatever</i>
<i>she could to help put me through school.</i>

2185
01:30:16,702 --> 01:30:20,915
<i>-And to my dad, thank you.</i>
<i>-[Madea] He ain't done nothing for you.</i>

2186
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:22,291
<i>-[sighs] Madea.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

2187
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:23,209
<i>Agree.</i>

2188
01:30:23,709 --> 01:30:26,712
<i>Even though they were divorced</i>
<i>and he didn't have much,</i>

2189
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,090
<i>he still tried to be there for me.</i>

2190
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:32,301
<i>And to my best friend Davi,</i>

2191
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,887
<i>who never once judged me</i>

2192
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:36,389
<i>but was always a friend.</i>

2193
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:40,977
<i>Even though he was sneaking around</i>
<i>with my mother.</i>

2194
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:41,894
<i>[Madea] Damn.</i>

2195
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:43,729
<i>-[Cora] Why does he keep saying that?</i>
<i>-I mean…</i>

2196
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:45,857
<i>-[Bam] 'Cause he was.</i>
<i>-[Madea] He was whoring around.</i>

2197
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,776
<i>He talk too damn much. What goes on</i>
<i>in the house stay in the house.</i>

2198
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:49,777
<i>[Cora] Amen!</i>

2199
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:53,197
<i>I thought about what kind of guy he is.</i>

2200
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,950
<i>He's mature. He's a good man.</i>

2201
01:30:56,033 --> 01:31:00,037
<i>And I thought to myself, how lucky am I</i>

2202
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,999
<i>that the two people I love</i>
<i>the most in this world</i>

2203
01:31:03,082 --> 01:31:05,209
<i>found each other because of me.</i>

2204
01:31:06,335 --> 01:31:07,795
<i>Would I rather have known?</i>

2205
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:09,130
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

2206
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:11,674
<i>[Tim] But I'm okay with it.</i>

2207
01:31:11,757 --> 01:31:14,427
<i>And I wanna apologize</i>
<i>to them for how I acted.</i>

2208
01:31:15,845 --> 01:31:19,182
<i>A future isn't a future without a past.</i>

2209
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:23,811
<i>And I'm just so thankful</i>
<i>that I have a family.</i>

2210
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,314
<i>For my great-grandmother, Madea.</i>

2211
01:31:26,397 --> 01:31:30,318
<i>My grandma, Cora,</i>
<i>Mr. Brown, Aunt Ellie, Aunt Bam.</i>

2212
01:31:30,401 --> 01:31:32,653
<i>And of course, Uncle Joe.</i>

2213
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:35,656
<i>[Madea] Baby, Joe ain't here.</i>
<i>He was too high to come.</i>

2214
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:38,701
<i>And I just wanna let the world know that</i>

2215
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:43,748
<i>I love them,</i>
<i>and I'm so thankful to be born to them.</i>

2216
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,500
<i>And as we start this future,</i>

2217
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:50,004
<i>I start mine standing on the shoulders</i>
<i>of regular, hardworking people</i>

2218

<i>who didn't have much.</i>

2219
