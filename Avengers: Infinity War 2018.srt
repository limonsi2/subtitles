172

174
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:44,390
Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever.

175
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:45,599
I should promise you.

176
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,059
- Yes. - I will.

177

180

181
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,615

182

183

184
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:07,121
the fate of the universe is at stake.

185
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,747
And who's "we"?

186
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,500
Hey, Tony.

187
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:12,710

190

WONG: At the dawn of the universe,

191
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,139
there was nothing. Then...

192
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,807
Boom.

193
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,686
The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals...

194
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,689
hurtling across the virgin universe.

195
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,275
These Infinity Stones

196
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,278
each control an essential aspect of existence.

197

202
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,335
And Time.

203
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,179
Tell me his name again.

204
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,472
Thanos.

205
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,932
He's a plague, Tony.

206
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,892
He invades planets. He takes what he wants.

207
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,269
He wipes out half the population.

208
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:14,063
He sent Loki.

209
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,608
The attack on New York, that's him.

210
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,318
This is it.

211
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:21,487
What's our timeline?

212
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,781
No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones.

213
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:24,949
That already makes him

214
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,575
the strongest creature in the whole universe.

215
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:30,079
If he gets his hands on all six stones, Tony...

216
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,247
He could destroy life

217
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,332
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

218
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,376
Did you seriously just say "hitherto undreamt of"?

219
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,586
Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

220
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,255
- Is that what it is? - (CLANGS)

221
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,926
I'm going to allow that.

222
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,596
If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just

223
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,139
stick this one down a garbage disposal?

224
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,224
No can do.

225
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:53,102
We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone with our lives.

226
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:54,395
STARK: And I swore off dairy...

227
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,064
but then Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me.

228

229
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,150
A bit chalky.

230
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,860
A Hunk of Hulk of Burning Fudge is our favorite.

231
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,153
- That's a thing? - Whatever.

232
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:04,405
Point is, things change.

233
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:07,408
Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change.

234
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,618
And this stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.

235
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:10,703
Yeah, so conversely,

236
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:12,663
it may also be his best chance against us.

237
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,206
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

238
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,291
What is your job exactly?

239
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,001
Besides making balloon animals.

Okay, guys. Could we table this discussion right now?

242
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,384
The fact is we have this stone.

243
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,760
We know where it is.

244
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,471
Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone...

245
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,348
and we have to find him now.

246
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:33,559
Yeah, that's the thing.

247

What do you mean?

248
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,979
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder.

249
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,188
He's offline.

250
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,523
- What? - Yeah.

251
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,692
Tony, you lost another super-bot?

252
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,028
I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.

253
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,654
Who could find Vision then?

503
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:16,483
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

504
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:17,942
ROCKET: You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

505
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,319
GAMORA: It's like his muscles

506
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:21,321
are made of Cotati metal fibers.

507
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:23,198
Stop massaging his muscles.

508
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:24,908
(THUD)

509
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:25,992
Wake him up.

510
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,079
(SOFTLY) Wake.

Who the hell are you guys?

516
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:56,356
The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal.

517
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:58,233
To bring balance to the universe

518
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:00,485
by wiping out half of all life.

519
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:03,613
He used to kill people planet by planet,

520
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,073
massacre by massacre.

521
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:06,741
Including my own.

522
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,493
If he gets all six Infinity Stones...

523
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,870
he can do it with the snap of his fingers like this.

524
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:14,457
You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

525
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:18,419
Gamora is the daughter of Thanos.

526
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:24,551
Your father killed my brother.

527
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:26,094
Oh, boy.

528
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:27,929
Stepfather, technically.

529
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:30,014
And she hates him as much as you do.

530
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:35,270
THOR: Families can be tough.

531
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,771
Before my father died,

532
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:38,606
he told me that I had a half-sister...

533
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:41,025
that he imprisoned in Hel.

534
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:44,153
And then she returned home and stabbed me in the eye.

535
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,613
So I had to kill her.

536
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,824
That's life though, isn't it, I guess.

537
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,158
Goes round and round and...

538
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:50,994
I feel your pain.

539
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,454
I feel your pain as well, because...

540
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:54,789
I mean, it's not a competition,

541
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:55,999
but I've been through a lot.

542
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,834
- My father killed my mother. - (SLURPING)

543
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,127
And then I had to kill my father.

544
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,712
- That was hard. - (SIGHS)

545
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,756
Probably even harder than having to kill a sister.

546
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:07,176
Plus, I came out with both my eyes, which was...

547
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:09,053
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

548
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,975
How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of, uh...

549
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:17,061
A four-digit code, maybe? Maybe a birthdate.

550
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:20,523
- Uh, what are you doing? - Taking your pod.

551
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:21,899
(PETER CLEARS THROAT)

552
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:23,026
(IN DEEP VOICE) No, you're not.

553
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:29,032
You will not be taking our pod today, sir.

554
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:32,910
Uh... Quill, are you making your voice deeper?

555
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:36,456
- No. - You are.

556
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:39,334
You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

557
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,668
No, I'm not.

558
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,879
- (GASPS) He just did it again! - This is my voice.

559
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,053
Are you mocking me?

560
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:53,431
- Are you mocking me? - Stop it. You did it again.

561
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:54,932
He's trying to copy me.

562
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:56,017
I need you to stop doing that.

563
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:57,810
- GAMORA: Enough! - He's doing it first.

564
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,354
We need to stop Thanos.

565
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,064
Which means we need to find out

566
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:02,148
where he's going next.

567
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:03,566
Knowhere.

568
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,401
He must be going somewhere.

569
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:07,570
(IN NORMAL VOICE) No, no. Knowhere?

570
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:10,406
It's a place. We've been there. It sucks.

571
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:12,992
- Excuse me, that's our food. - Not anymore.

572
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:16,579
Thor, why would he go to Knowhere?

573
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:17,914
THOR: Because for years...

574
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,249
the Reality Stone's been safely stored there

575
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:21,751
with a man called the Collector.

576
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,503
PETER: If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe.

577
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,463
Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

578
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:26,923
- Or a genius. - GAMORA: How do you know...

579
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,634
he's not going for one of the other stones?

580
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,178
There are six stones out there.

581
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:34,555
Thanos already has the Power Stone...

582
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:38,017
because he stole it last week when he decimated Xandar.

583
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:40,520
He stole the Space Stone from me...

584
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,356
when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people.

585
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,149
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.

586
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:46,234
They're with the Avengers.

587
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,820
- The Avengers? - Earth's mightiest heroes.

588
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,113
Like Kevin Bacon?

589
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,572
He may be on the team. I don't know.

590
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:52,657
I haven't been there in a while.

591
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:55,034
As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that.

592
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,828
No one even knows where it is.

593
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,746
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

594
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,289
Therefore he's going to Knowhere.

595
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:02,875
Hence he'll be getting the Reality Stone.

596
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,085
You're welcome.

597
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:05,461
Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

598
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:09,298
Wrong. Where we have to go is Nidavellir.

599
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,592
- That's a made-up word. - All words are made up.

600
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,846
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

601
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,639
That place is a legend.

602
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,224
They make the most powerful, horrific weapons

603
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,351
(CHUCKLING) to ever torment the universe.

604
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:22,562
I would very much like to go there, please.

605
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:23,730
The rabbit is correct

606
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:24,814
and clearly the smartest among you.

607
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:25,982
Rabbit?

608
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:28,401
Only Eitri the Dwarf can make me the weapon I need.

609
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:29,777
I assume you're the captain, sir.

610
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:30,945
You're very perceptive.

611
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,321
You seem like a noble leader.

612
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:33,990
Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

613
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:36,951
Let me just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me!

614
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,870
- Yeah. I'll go. - Wonderful!

615
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,163
Uh, except for that I'm the captain.

616
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,247
THOR: Quiet.

617
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,915
- That's my backpack. - ROCKET: Go sit down.

618
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,709
PETER: Look, this is my ship.

619
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:46,627
And I'm not goin' to...

620
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:49,714
Wait, what kinda weapon are we talkin' about here?

621
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:51,132
The Thanos-killing kind.

622
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:53,468
Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?

623
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,678
No. You simply lack the strength to wield them.

624
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:56,929
Your bodies would crumble

625
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:58,181
as your minds collapsed into madness.

626
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:00,266
Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?

627
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:01,601
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

628
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,019
If we don't go to Knowhere

629
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,687
and Thanos retrieves another stone...

630
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:06,397
he'll be too powerful to stop.

631
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:08,733
- He already is. - I got it figured out.

632
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,610
We got two ships

633
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:12,069
and a large assortment of morons.

634
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:15,490
So me and Groot will go with the pirate angel here.

635
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:16,824
And the morons will go to Knowhere

636
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:18,493
to try to stop Thanos.

637
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,578
- Cool? Cool. - So cool.

638
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:22,038
PETER: For the record...

639
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,123
I know that you're going with him

640
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:25,291
because it's where Thanos isn't.

641
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:26,959
You know, you really shouldn't

642
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:29,170
talk that way to your captain, Quill.

643
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,464
Come on, Groot.

644
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:34,717
Put that game down. You'll rot your brain.

645
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,135
(VIDEO GAME CONTINUES BEEPING)

646
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:41,265
I bid you farewell and good luck, morons.

647
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:42,558
Bye.

648
00:35:52,944 --> 00:35:54,987
- (HIGH-PITCHED TRILLING) - (GASPS)

649
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:58,449
Vis?

650
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:00,827
Is it the stone again?

651
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,620
It's as if it's speaking to me.

652
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,956
What does it say?

653
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:08,209
I don't... I don't know, but something.

654
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:11,671
- (HIGH-PITCHED TRILLING) - Hey.

655
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:24,016
Tell me what you feel.

656
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:33,734
I just feel you.

657
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:43,828
WANDA: So there's a 10:00 a.m. to Glasgow...

658
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:45,997
which would give us more time together before you went back.

659
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,623
VISION: What if I miss that train?

660
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,791
There's an 11:00.

661
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:51,377
What if I missed all the trains?

662
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:54,463
What if this time I didn't go back?

663
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,965
But you gave Stark your word.

664

I sold it.

Why would I lie?

839
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:28,156
I imagine it's like breathing for you.

840
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:30,701
Like suicide.

00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:32,369
You do understand.

842
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:36,331
Not even you would surrender something so precious.

I didn't know what it was.

If we get it, then we can stop him.

you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

Vision's stone.

But also its composition.

982
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,840
I think if it were exposed

to a sufficiently powerful energy source...

984
00:57:07,926 --> 00:57:11,763
something very similar to its own signature, perhaps...

985
00:57:13,348 --> 00:57:15,517
its molecular integrity could fail.

Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone.

1003
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:08,111
All of them mixed together,

all of them learning from one another.

1005
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:11,823
You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

1006
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:15,076
I'm saying that if we take out the stone...

1007
00:58:15,243 --> 00:58:16,661
there's still a whole lot of Vision left.

1008
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:18,204
Perhaps the best parts.

1009
00:58:18,538 --> 00:58:19,873
Can we do that?

1010
00:58:20,582 --> 00:58:21,624
Not me, not here.

00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,169
RHODES: Well, you better find someone

1012
00:58:24,252 --> 00:58:25,420
and somewhere fast.

1013
00:58:25,587 --> 00:58:26,963
Ross isn't just gonna let you guys

1014
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:28,256
have your old rooms back.

1015
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:32,886
I know somewhere.

OKOYE: The Kingsguard

1017
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,153
and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.

1018
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,863
And the Border Tribe?

1019
00:58:52,322 --> 00:58:53,907
Those that are left.

1020
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:56,326
Send word to the Jabari as well.

1021

This one may be tired of war.

But the White Wolf has rested long enough.

Where's the fight?

1027
00:59:33,863 --> 00:59:35,281
On its way.

I have never failed him.

1032
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:08,314
If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan...

1033

with the Time Stone still attached

1034
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:12,318
to your vaguely irritating person...

1035
01:00:12,485 --> 01:00:15,071
there would be judgment.

(GRUNTS)

1039
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:30,044
the stone.

1040
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,891
Wow, you're a seriously

1041
01:00:43,975 --> 01:00:45,059
loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?

STARK: What the...

1044
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,732
- I know what you're gonna say. - You should not be here.

1045
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:51,941
- I was gonna go home. - I don't wanna hear it.

1046
01:00:52,108 --> 01:00:53,109
But it was such a long way down and I just thought

1047
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:54,444
- about you on the way... - And now I gotta hear it.

1048
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:55,528
...and kinda stuck to the side of the ship.

1049

And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way.

1050

God damn it.

1051
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:01,868
So, if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

1052
01:01:02,035 --> 01:01:03,369
- What did you just say? - (STUTTERS) I take that back.

1053
01:01:03,536 --> 01:01:04,829
And now, I'm here in space.

1054
01:01:04,996 --> 01:01:07,415
Yeah, right where I didn't want you to be.

You hear me? Don't pretend you thought this through.

No, I did think this through.

1059
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,506
You could not have possibly thought this through.

1060

You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man...

I seriously don't know

how you fit your head into that helmet.

1098

Admit it, you should've ducked out when I told you to.

1099
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:10,997
I tried to bench you. You refused.

1100

Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.

And due to that fact,

we're now in a flying doughnut...

Can you get us home?

01:03:46,574 --> 01:03:47,825
Yeah, I heard you.

1119
01:03:49,118 --> 01:03:51,579
I'm thinking I'm not so sure we should.

1120
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:53,748
Under no circumstances

1121
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:56,375
can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

1122
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:57,710
I don't think you quite understand

1123
01:03:57,793 --> 01:03:58,794
what's at stake here.

1124
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:01,297
What? No. It's you who doesn't understand...

1125
01:04:01,464 --> 01:04:04,217
that Thanos has been inside my head for six years.

1126
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:05,968
Since he sent an army to New York

1127
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:07,595
and now he's back.

1128
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:09,680
And I don't know what to do.

1129
01:04:09,847 --> 01:04:11,015
So I'm not so sure

1130
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:12,892
if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his...

1131
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:16,687
but you saw what they did, what they can do.

1132
01:04:16,854 --> 01:04:19,065
At least on his turf, he's not expecting it.

1133
01:04:19,232 --> 01:04:21,984
So I say we take the fight to him.

1134
01:04:22,151 --> 01:04:23,152
Doctor.

1135
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,531
Do you concur?

1136
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:31,577
All right, Stark. We go to him.

1137
01:04:32,662 --> 01:04:34,705
But you have to understand...

1138
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:36,541
if it comes to saving you

1139
01:04:36,624 --> 01:04:39,085
or the kid or the Time Stone...

1140
01:04:39,252 --> 01:04:42,088
I will not hesitate to let either of you die.

1141
01:04:42,922 --> 01:04:46,592
I can't, because the universe depends on it.

1142

01:05:50,573 --> 01:05:52,617
THANOS: So I've been told.

1149
01:05:53,284 --> 01:05:57,204
Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day.

1150
01:05:57,955 --> 01:05:59,457
I hated this room.

1151
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:01,667
This ship.

1152
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:03,628
I hated my life.

1153
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:10,301
THANOS: You told me that too.

1154
01:06:13,471 --> 01:06:14,847
Every day.

For almost 20 years.

1156

I was a child when you took me.

1157
01:06:25,441 --> 01:06:26,734
I saved you.

1158
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:31,280
No.

1159
01:06:32,782 --> 01:06:36,285
No. We were happy on my home planet.

1160
01:06:36,494 --> 01:06:37,620
Going to bed hungry...

It's a paradise.

1168

Because you murdered half the planet.

At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.

01:16:06,104 --> 01:16:07,773
(CLANGING)

1328
01:16:10,067 --> 01:16:13,070
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

1329
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:17,366
I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe.

1330
01:16:19,868 --> 01:16:21,328
I made what he wanted.

1331
01:16:23,038 --> 01:16:27,376
A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones.

1332
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:30,879
(STAMMERS)

1333
01:16:31,922 --> 01:16:34,508
Then he killed everyone anyway.

1334
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:38,387
All except me.

1335
01:16:39,471 --> 01:16:41,348
"Your life is yours," he said.

1336
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:46,603
"But your hands are mine alone."

1337
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:49,564
Eitri, this isn't about your hands.

1338
01:16:50,691 --> 01:16:52,276
Every weapon you've ever designed,

1339
01:16:52,359 --> 01:16:53,777
every axe, hammer, sword...

1340
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:56,154
it's all inside your head.

1341
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,949
Now, I know it feels like all hope is lost.

1342
01:16:59,116 --> 01:17:00,659
Trust me, I know.

1343
01:17:01,118 --> 01:17:05,831
But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.

1344
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:28,186
(GRUNTING)

1345
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:37,821
(GRUNTING)

1346
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,623
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1347
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:51,001
I need you to meet me on Titan.

1348
01:17:57,549 --> 01:17:58,675
SPIDER-MAN: Hey, what's going on?

1349
01:17:58,842 --> 01:18:00,052
DR. STRANGE: I think we're here.

1350
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:02,679
I don't think this rig has a self-park function.

1351
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:05,974
Get your hand inside the steering gimbal.

1352
01:18:06,058 --> 01:18:07,100
Close those around it.

1353
01:18:08,769 --> 01:18:09,811
- You understand? - Yep, got it.

1354
01:18:09,978 --> 01:18:11,271
This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta

1355
01:18:11,355 --> 01:18:13,023
- move at the same time. - Okay, okay. Ready.

1356
01:18:17,444 --> 01:18:18,653
- (RUMBLING) - We might wanna turn.

1357
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:20,072
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1358
01:18:50,018 --> 01:18:51,520
You all right?

1359
01:18:52,562 --> 01:18:54,272
STARK: (GRUNTS) That was close.

1360
01:18:55,649 --> 01:18:56,900
I owe you one.

1361
01:18:57,401 --> 01:18:59,486
Let me just say, if aliens

1362
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:01,321
wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something...

1363
01:19:01,488 --> 01:19:02,614
and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

1364
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:05,117
I do not want another single pop culture reference

1365
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,785
out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?

1366
01:19:06,868 --> 01:19:08,328
I'm trying to say that something is coming.

1367
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:16,837
DRAX: Thanos!

1368
01:19:17,838 --> 01:19:18,839

01:19:20,674 --> 01:19:21,716

(PETER LAUGHS)

1372
01:19:36,106 --> 01:19:37,149
(SPIDER-MAN GASPS)

1373
01:19:37,649 --> 01:19:39,651
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't put your eggs in me!

1374
01:19:39,734 --> 01:19:41,069
(GRUNTS)

1375
01:19:41,153 --> 01:19:43,613
- (SPIDER-MAN GRUNTS) - PETER QUILL: Stay down, clown.

1376
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:48,743
(SCREAMS)

1377
01:19:48,827 --> 01:19:50,912
DRAX: Die, blanket of death!

01:19:55,667 --> 01:19:56,751
(GRUNTS)

1379
01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:59,754
PETER: Everybody stay where you are. Chill the eff out.

1380
01:20:00,964 --> 01:20:02,966
I'm gonna ask you this one time.

1381
01:20:03,717 --> 01:20:04,968
Where is Gamora?

1382
01:20:05,135 --> 01:20:07,637
Yeah. I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

1383
01:20:07,929 --> 01:20:10,724
I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?

1384
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:12,809
Tell me where the girl is or I swear to you

1385
01:20:12,893 --> 01:20:14,144
I'm gonna French fry this little freak.

1386
01:20:14,311 --> 01:20:17,147
Let's do it. You shoot my guy and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1387
01:20:17,731 --> 01:20:20,317
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1388
01:20:20,484 --> 01:20:22,486
- No, he can't take it! - She's right. You can't.

1389
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:24,696
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine.

1390
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:25,906
I'll kill all three of you

1391
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:27,824
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself.

1392
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:28,992
Starting with you.

1393
01:20:29,075 --> 01:20:30,160
Wait, what, Thanos?

1394
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:32,329
All right, let me ask you this one time.

1395
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:34,498
What master do you serve?

1396
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:35,916
What master do I serve?

1397
01:20:35,999 --> 01:20:37,459
What am I supposed to say, "Jesus"?

1398
01:20:38,376 --> 01:20:39,377
You're from Earth.

1399
01:20:39,461 --> 01:20:40,545
I'm not from Earth, I'm from Missouri.

1400
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:41,963
STARK: Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.

1401
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:43,173
What are you hassling us for?

1402
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:45,091
SPIDER-MAN: So you're not with Thanos?

1403
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:47,385
With Thanos?

1404
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:50,555
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1405
01:20:50,722 --> 01:20:52,557
He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

1406
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:55,101
- We're the Avengers, man. - Oh.

1407
01:20:55,185 --> 01:20:57,479
You're the ones Thor told us about.

1408
01:20:57,646 --> 01:20:58,813
You know Thor?

1409
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,065
Yeah.

1410
01:21:00,148 --> 01:21:02,609
Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving.

1411
01:21:02,776 --> 01:21:04,444
Where is he now?

1412
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:21,378
This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?

1413
01:21:21,545 --> 01:21:22,754
It's a mold.

1414
01:21:23,505 --> 01:21:24,506
A king's weapon.

1415
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:27,801
Meant to be the greatest in Asgard.

1416
01:21:28,426 --> 01:21:31,304
In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

1417
01:21:31,471 --> 01:21:32,931
Did it have a name?

1418
01:21:34,182 --> 01:21:35,350
Stormbreaker.

1419
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:36,935
That's a bit much.

1420
01:21:38,979 --> 01:21:40,063
So how do we make it?

1421
01:21:41,898 --> 01:21:44,109
You'll have to restart the forge.

1422
01:21:45,068 --> 01:21:47,279
Awaken the heart of a dying star.

1423
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:52,534
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1424
01:21:56,204 --> 01:21:58,164
PETER: The hell happened to this planet?

1425
01:21:58,331 --> 01:22:00,125
It's eight degrees off its axis.

1426
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:02,419
Gravitational pull is all over the place.

1427
01:22:03,753 --> 01:22:06,548
Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us.

1428
01:22:07,507 --> 01:22:10,135
We'll use it. All right, I have a plan.

1429
01:22:10,302 --> 01:22:11,553
Or at least the beginnings of one.

1430
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,054
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,

1431
01:22:13,138 --> 01:22:14,347
pin him down, get what we need.

1432
01:22:14,514 --> 01:22:16,182
Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy.

1433
01:22:16,266 --> 01:22:17,309
We just want the gauntlet.

1434
01:22:17,892 --> 01:22:20,270
- Are you yawning? - (YAWNING)

1435
01:22:20,353 --> 01:22:22,522
In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1436
01:22:22,647 --> 01:22:23,648
Did you hear what I said?

1437
01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:26,735
I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan."

1438
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:27,986
Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

1439
01:22:28,153 --> 01:22:30,989
See, "not winging it" isn't really what they do.

1440
01:22:31,156 --> 01:22:32,657
Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

1441
01:22:32,824 --> 01:22:34,409
Kick names, take ass.

1442
01:22:34,576 --> 01:22:35,827
Yeah, that's right.

1443
01:22:40,749 --> 01:22:41,750
(SIGHS)

1444
01:22:42,542 --> 01:22:43,877
All right, just get over here, please.

1445
01:22:44,294 --> 01:22:46,212
Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?

1446
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:48,548
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1447
01:22:51,259 --> 01:22:52,552
STARK: We gotta coalesce.

1448
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,346
'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude...

1449
01:22:54,512 --> 01:22:56,806
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1450
01:22:56,973 --> 01:22:58,141
We don't know what it means.

1451
01:22:58,558 --> 01:23:01,144
All right, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan.

1452
01:23:01,311 --> 01:23:03,772
Except it sucks, so let me do the plan...

1453
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:05,857
and that way it might be really good.

1454
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:07,984
Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.

1455
01:23:08,151 --> 01:23:10,278
- STARK: What dance-off? - (STAMMERS) It's nothing.

1456
01:23:10,445 --> 01:23:11,488
Like in Footloose, the movie?

1457
01:23:11,655 --> 01:23:13,031
Exactly like Footloose.

1458
01:23:13,573 --> 01:23:15,075
Is it still the greatest movie in history?

1459
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:16,368
SPIDER-MAN: It never was.

1460
01:23:16,534 --> 01:23:17,577
STARK: Don't encourage this, all right?

1461
01:23:17,661 --> 01:23:18,953
- Okay. - We're getting no help

1462
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:20,622
- from Flash Gordon here. - Flash Gordon?

1463
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:21,831
By the way, that's a compliment.

1464
01:23:22,415 --> 01:23:23,917
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1465
01:23:24,084 --> 01:23:25,627
So that 50% of me that's stupid...

1466
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:27,837
that's 100% you.

1467
01:23:28,004 --> 01:23:29,255
STARK: Your math is blowing my mind.

1468
01:23:29,339 --> 01:23:30,632
MANTIS: Excuse me.

1469
01:23:31,633 --> 01:23:35,053
But does your friend often do that?

1470
01:23:36,471 --> 01:23:38,765
Strange, we all right?

1471
01:23:46,398 --> 01:23:47,899
(GASPS)

1472
01:23:47,982 --> 01:23:48,983
(PANTING)

1473
01:23:49,067 --> 01:23:50,110
You're back. You're all right.

1474
01:23:50,193 --> 01:23:51,986
- DR. STRANGE: Hi. - Hey, what was that?

1475
01:23:52,487 --> 01:23:56,157
I went forward in time to view alternate futures.

1476
01:23:57,033 --> 01:23:58,576
To see all the possible outcomes

1477
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,495
of the coming conflict.

1478
01:24:01,246 --> 01:24:02,580
How many did you see?

1479
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:04,999
14,000,605.

1480
01:24:06,668 --> 01:24:08,086
How many did we win?

1481
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:14,008
One.

1482
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:38,908
THANOS: The stone had better be up there.

1483
01:24:40,785 --> 01:24:42,829
For your sister's sake.

1484
01:25:03,725 --> 01:25:08,480
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1485
01:25:10,565 --> 01:25:13,818
