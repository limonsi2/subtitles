3
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,374
Maddie, I'm sorry
for all the years

4
00:00:33,406 --> 00:00:36,482
lost, the pain and
suffering that I caused you.

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,164
I wish I could see you
with my own eyes again,

6
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:44,555
but it's too late for me now.

7
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:53,234
I only ever wanted to be
the dad you wanted me to be.

8
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:57,470
And for that, I
will die in regret.

9
00:00:57,502 --> 00:01:01,985
But please know this,
I lived with such pride

10
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:03,256
having you as my daughter.

11
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:12,336
This is my confession to you
for everything, what I did

12
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,812
and why I did it.

13
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:18,680
It'll hurt, but it'll
set you free too.

14
00:01:23,236 --> 00:01:28,950
I know you think what this
is, what I am, but you don't.

15
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:35,791
Once I've given this
truth to Father Peter,

16
00:01:35,823 --> 00:01:39,788
his world will be
blown apart, but it's

17
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:41,577
time to try and put
right what I can.

18
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,372
All this will end tonight.

19
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:48,659
I'm afraid I was just about
to lock up for the night.

20
00:04:04,474 --> 00:04:05,721
Well, I'm afraid...

21
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,915
Take one more step I'll blow
your fucking brains out.

22
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:12,874
I talk you listen.

23
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:15,592
You understand?

24
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,869
How many exit points are
there in this church?

25
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:19,109
Why would you want to know that?

26
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,986
Answer the fucking question.

27
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:25,222
Uh, four.

28
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:26,572
Start by locking this one.

29
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,445
Look at the door, not of me.

30
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:48,639
Good.

31
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,070
Move.

32
00:04:54,824 --> 00:04:55,464
It's locked.

33
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:06,181
You know, If you don't
get that seen to,

34
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:09,138
you're going to be in
serious trouble in no time.

35
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:10,049
It's too late for me.

36
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:15,652
I'm already dead.

37
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:19,608
What is it you want here?

38
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:25,074
This is a house of worship,
a house of God, not violence.

39
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:30,756
Do you think I want
to be here doing this?

40
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:37,230
I'm just trying to understand
what's happened to you.

41
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:38,460
What do you want?

42
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:47,659
I want the same
things as you do,

43
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:48,930
for people to know the truth.

44
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:52,007
Let's go.

45
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,695
At least let me get
you some painkillers.

46
00:07:12,726 --> 00:07:14,812
All right.

47
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:30,077
You got anything stronger?

48
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:09,637
I've seen enough
gunshot wounds to know

49
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:11,196
that if I don't
treat you now you're

50
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:14,832
going to die right here
in front of my alter.

51
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:15,903
I'm not going to have that.

52
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:34,173
I'm going to have to cauterize
it, stop the bleeding till we

53
00:08:34,204 --> 00:08:36,410
get you to a hospital.

54
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:39,088
We're not going to
a fucking hospital.

55
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:39,839
You got a belt?

56
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:44,914
Bite down on it.

57
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:07,092
Ready?

58
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:33,466
Just once more, OK?

59
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,914
The bleeding slowed for now.

60
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:11,316
I'm going to have to dress
it, though, keep infection out

61
00:10:11,347 --> 00:10:12,547
of the sun already in there.

62
00:10:15,263 --> 00:10:17,789
I've got a gear big enough.

63
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:18,948
I'm going to check out back.

64
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:20,547
Oh, forget it.

65
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,304
I have to wrap that.

66
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:25,094
I'm only doing what's necessary.

67
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:31,327
OK, wait.

68
00:10:35,163 --> 00:10:36,801
Give me your keys
and your cell phone.

69
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,464
What the hell are
you doing in there?

70
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:51,355
Don't make me come in there!

71
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:57,861
Hey!

72
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:20,086
What the hell are
you doing back there?

73
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:21,525
I'm sorry.

74
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:24,083
Sorry, I haven't been able
to use that medical equipment

75
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:25,680
in years.

76
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:27,391
Just give me a minute, OK?

77
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:51,527
Come on, come on.

78
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,037
Please, God, please.

79
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,300
Come on.

80
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:26,812
Come on, Come on.

81
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:45,593
I'd turn the fuck around.

82
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:52,106
Don't make me ask twice.

83
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:03,855
Get out of my fucking way.

84
00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:24,793
Move.

85
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:11,907
OK.

86
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:32,286
Smoke?

87
00:16:35,642 --> 00:16:36,882
We are all sinners.

88
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:11,216
So, you know who I am.

89
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,206
What do we call you?

90
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:18,168
Victor strong.

91
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,799
You're Catholic?

92
00:17:22,515 --> 00:17:23,834
A long time ago.

93
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:31,155
Well, he's always
there no matter what.

94
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:37,948
I wouldn't be so sure,
not after what I've done.

95
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,623
Forgiveness isn't just a word.

96
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,500
It's what faith is all about.

97
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:50,816
If God exists, he's got a
funny way of showing it.

98
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:54,324
We all change, evolve.

99
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:03,603
No matter what happens
in our personal journey,

100
00:18:03,634 --> 00:18:08,158
you can always
reconnect, no matter

101
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,635
how disillusioned you become.

102
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:14,224
No one stopped the two bullets
ripping through me, did they?

103
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:18,420
We all have choices.

104
00:18:21,776 --> 00:18:24,263
It's called free will.

105
00:18:24,294 --> 00:18:26,021
And what good did that do me?

106
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:28,778
I'm sitting here bleeding to
death in your fucking church.

107
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:34,812
Know this, he is still
watching over you

108
00:18:34,844 --> 00:18:35,882
no matter what's happened.

109
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:48,318
Perhaps now is the
time to reach out.

110
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,227
All you have to do
is ask for his help.

111
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:55,023
If only it was that easy.

112
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:16,282
I know you think what this
is, what I am, but you don't.

113
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,123
I'm not here to
judge you, Victor.

114
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:24,594
I just want to understand.

115
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:35,462
Everything I ever did was for
these two, Jessie and Madison.

116
00:19:40,617 --> 00:19:42,176
Was this your wife and daughter?

117
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:48,290
Up until 9 years ago when
it all went up in smoke.

118
00:19:54,523 --> 00:19:55,482
Where are they now?

119
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:13,713
Do Jessie and
Madison have anything

120
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:15,543
to do with what's
happened to you tonight?

121
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,183
It only happened because
I didn't stand my ground

122
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:24,734
and be the man I
should have been.

123
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:30,096
Well, if you tell
me where they are,

124
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,366
I can make sure they're OK.

125
00:20:35,882 --> 00:20:37,040
You're not listening to me.

126
00:20:39,678 --> 00:20:42,883
Well, you want to make
sure they're OK, don't you?

127
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:45,400
Don't you, Victor?

128
00:20:45,432 --> 00:20:46,671
They everything to me.

129
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:50,628
They always have been.

130
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:56,630
I can see that.

131
00:20:56,662 --> 00:20:59,706
So the first thing we
need to do is make sure

132
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:01,065
that none of what's
happened tonight

133
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:03,215
has hurt them in any way.

134
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,454
What are you fucking saying?

135
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:14,692
I just want to understand.

136
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:18,648
You need to stop with your
understanding bullshit.

137
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:23,762
Well, I want to make
sure they're OK.

138
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:26,200
Is that so wrong?

139
00:21:26,232 --> 00:21:29,077
Do you honestly think
it could have hurt them?

140
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:31,634
Do you?

141
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,945
You need to answer me.

142
00:21:37,021 --> 00:21:38,668
Answer me right now
or I will show you

143
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:40,617
what hurting someone
fucking looks like.

144
00:22:02,515 --> 00:22:05,041
You can threaten
me all you like.

145
00:22:05,072 --> 00:22:07,151
I'm an on old man,
I've had my life.

146
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:17,869
But if you've hurt your wife,
your own flesh and blood,

147
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,139
what kind of man are you?

148
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:34,811
You see, You're not
so understanding now.

149
00:22:34,843 --> 00:22:36,090
Stop playing game.

150
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,329
I'm not.

151
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:39,207
Then do what you say
you've never done.

152
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,886
Yeah, what's that?

153
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:45,880
Face up to your transgressions,
admit to all you've done.

154
00:22:45,912 --> 00:22:47,838
Every damn skeleton
is coming out tonight,

155
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,917
I promise you that.

156
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:50,276
Well, tell me where they are.

157
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:51,834
It's not as simple as that.

158
00:22:51,866 --> 00:22:55,071
It's only as complicated
as you want to make it.

159
00:22:55,102 --> 00:23:00,705
You live in your fucking
church, all high and mighty,

160
00:23:00,737 --> 00:23:03,223
thinking the answer
to everything.

161
00:23:03,255 --> 00:23:04,782
Let me tell you
something, you know

162
00:23:04,814 --> 00:23:07,779
nothing about the real world.

163
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,735
You hear me?

164
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:12,893
Nothing.

165
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:17,048
You don't know a
single thing about me.

166
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,925
So your assumptions
mean nothing.

167
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:24,882
I know the world is
hard for many, that's

168
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:26,800
why I chose to help people.

169
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:27,790
That's why I'm a priest.

170
00:23:30,947 --> 00:23:35,111
I believe there's a
reason for everything.

171
00:23:35,143 --> 00:23:40,745
More importantly, I
believe in humanity.

172
00:23:40,777 --> 00:23:49,576
That everyone, deep
down, is born good,

173
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:52,126
that they just lose their way.

174
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:01,565
You honestly believe
you make a difference?

175
00:24:01,596 --> 00:24:05,360
I know as much as the next guy.

176
00:24:05,392 --> 00:24:09,716
I know the world
is a sick place.

177
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:14,023
It's full of hate, full
of violence and greed.

178
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:23,822
So whatever happens tonight,
when I meet my maker,

179
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:28,250
at least I can say I tried
to make a difference.

180
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:32,645
Can you say the same?

181
00:24:42,156 --> 00:24:45,232
I'm a sinner, just like you.

182
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,788
Then repent.

183
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:52,785
Tell me where they are.

184
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,826
Where's Madison?

185
00:25:00,857 --> 00:25:02,343
I don't know.

186
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,223
Where is she?

187
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:04,421
I don't know.

188
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:06,100
When was the last
time you saw her?

189
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:08,258
About six years ago.

190
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,218
Stop lying.

191
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:10,256
It's the truth.

192
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:11,255
Well, what about Jesse?

193
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:13,293
What about your wife?

194
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:16,370
Answer me.

195
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:17,010
Answer me.

196
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:17,880
She's dead.

197
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:59,845
When did Jesse depart?

198
00:25:59,877 --> 00:26:00,997
She's been gone nine years.

199
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:05,671
I was a different man back then.

200
00:26:13,944 --> 00:26:15,063
Did you have a good marriage?

201
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,096
The best.

202
00:26:25,093 --> 00:26:30,335
We had our ups and
downs couples don't.

203
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:35,291
In sickness and in health,
for better or for worse,

204
00:26:35,322 --> 00:26:37,080
you got to work
on relationships.

205
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:47,359
I was content, happy
with everything I had,

206
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:51,147
Jessie was more career-driven.

207
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,949
I was happy just to
have a secure job.

208
00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:59,186
We had our home,
Maddie came along.

209
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:02,504
What else did we need?

210
00:27:02,536 --> 00:27:04,413
But Jesse had other ideas?

211
00:27:08,489 --> 00:27:12,094
She was very ambitious,
wanted to get

212
00:27:12,126 --> 00:27:13,244
to the top no matter what.

213
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,438
And this caused
friction between you.

214
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,080
Right.

215
00:27:25,112 --> 00:27:28,117
Find me a partnership that
doesn't have friction.

216
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:30,436
It's normal.

217
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:34,152
No two or identical, we
all have different needs.

218
00:27:34,184 --> 00:27:37,149
I get that.

219
00:27:37,181 --> 00:27:42,304
But I have never jeopardized our
family home for a fucking job.

220
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:44,901
And you think she did
that intentionally?

221
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:47,218
I told her over and over again
be happy with what you got,

222
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,096
but she wouldn't listen to me.

223
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,167
Thought I worried too much.

224
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:56,281
Well, how did that
make you feel?

225
00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:12,394
Like that wasn't enough for
her, like we weren't enough.

226
00:28:26,691 --> 00:28:31,215
The old adage, you don't know
what you've got till it's gone.

227
00:28:31,246 --> 00:28:32,293
Not me.

228
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:33,572
I knew exactly what we had.

229
00:28:33,604 --> 00:28:34,922
I was terrified of losing it.

230
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,204
As you've said it yourself,
the world is a sick place.

231
00:28:42,235 --> 00:28:44,481
All I wanted to do was look
after those inside my home,

232
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:50,995
but Jessie made it
impossible for me to do that.

233
00:28:51,027 --> 00:28:54,223
Well, you can't
do it on your own.

234
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,986
You both have to have the
same ideals or at least

235
00:29:00,017 --> 00:29:04,541
an understanding to compromise.

236
00:29:04,573 --> 00:29:06,211
She'd always do it her way.

237
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:16,281
How old is Madison?

238
00:29:19,518 --> 00:29:20,956
She'll be 19 next month.

239
00:29:25,272 --> 00:29:33,073
Oh, what a tragedy, to lose
your mom at such a tender age.

240
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:39,427
I don't know what's worse, your
mom dying or your dad running

241
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:40,017
out on you.

242
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:50,686
What happened to Jesse?

243
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,158
She was murdered.

244
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:14,911
I was always scared our
life together wouldn't last.

245
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:19,227
It's like I had a sixth
sense or something.

246
00:30:19,258 --> 00:30:21,025
I tried to put it to
the back of my mind,

247
00:30:21,057 --> 00:30:23,654
but it was always there.

248
00:30:28,449 --> 00:30:29,688
How did Jesse die?

249
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:38,327
I didn't go away very
often, but occasionally, I'd

250
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:41,084
take overtime.

251
00:30:41,116 --> 00:30:45,280
I was saving some cash for
the girls for a vacation.

252
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:47,558
Now, what I didn't
know was that by then,

253
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,755
Jesse was in some serious shit.

254
00:30:50,787 --> 00:30:56,150
She was in deep with
some bad people.

255
00:30:56,182 --> 00:30:57,500
I'll let you know
when it's done.

256
00:31:03,374 --> 00:31:07,659
Is that the last
time you saw her?

257
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:11,814
The night before I
left, we had a fight.

258
00:31:11,845 --> 00:31:15,530
I don't even remember
what it was about.

259
00:31:15,562 --> 00:31:20,206
Some stupid shit, dirty
dishes or something.

260
00:31:20,237 --> 00:31:24,042
And when we went to bed,
she was still mad at me.

261
00:31:24,073 --> 00:31:25,631
She left before I woke
up in the morning.

262
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:31,385
Next thing I know, I was in the
morgue identifying her body.

263
00:31:44,493 --> 00:31:45,811
I am so sorry.

264
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:53,772
She was shot dead on
the side of the street.

265
00:31:53,804 --> 00:31:56,489
They said it was a
robbery that went wrong.

266
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:58,488
It wasn't?

267
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:01,116
She took two bullets to the
chest and one to the head.

268
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,680
That's not some
crackhead son of a bitch

269
00:32:05,712 --> 00:32:08,716
trying to take your
fucking purse, that's

270
00:32:08,748 --> 00:32:11,674
a professional hit.

271
00:32:25,732 --> 00:32:28,417
What the fuck was that?

272
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:30,654
Is there someone here you
haven't told me about?

273
00:32:30,686 --> 00:32:32,165
There's only me,
I can assure you.

274
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,758
Wait.

275
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,116
Touch me again.

276
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:52,553
When you first got here, you
asked me to check the doors?

277
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:54,112
Yeah, what?

278
00:32:54,144 --> 00:32:56,421
The door in there it was
opened before I locked it.

279
00:33:01,575 --> 00:33:03,302
Why didn't you tell me?

280
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:04,421
You had a gun to my head.

281
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:17,608
When I was in there looking for
something to bandage you with...

282
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,927
Yeah, what?

283
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:22,315
I think I might have heard
something or someone.

284
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:40,865
Take one more step
and I will put

285
00:33:40,897 --> 00:33:42,895
a hole in your fucking skull.

286
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:54,203
Get over here.

287
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:09,716
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

288
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:12,952
I should just shoot you
in the fucking face.

289
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,751
Just take a step back.

290
00:34:14,782 --> 00:34:16,350
Why should I listen to you?

291
00:34:16,381 --> 00:34:17,548
Give me a reason.

292
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,826
Because I'm here
and I want to help.

293
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,583
I saw you helping
the son of a bitch.

294
00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:23,901
I don't know what you think.

295
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:27,818
I saw you helping a
murdering scumbag.

296
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,856
You picked your side.

297
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:32,253
This is a church, in
case you haven't noticed,

298
00:34:32,285 --> 00:34:33,532
and I'm a priest.

299
00:34:33,564 --> 00:34:36,928
That doesn't give
you a free pass.

300
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,564
This man, Victor, he came in
here with a gunshot wound.

301
00:34:41,595 --> 00:34:43,282
I see you know his fucking name.

302
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:44,920
Do you think I am stupid?

303
00:34:44,951 --> 00:34:51,554
He came in here, just as you
have now, pointing a gun at me

304
00:34:51,585 --> 00:34:53,872
and telling me what I
must and mustn't do.

305
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:57,747
You could have told him to
fuck off and get the hell out.

306
00:34:57,779 --> 00:34:59,626
When you're looking down
the barrel of a gun,

307
00:34:59,658 --> 00:35:02,623
it doesn't matter who's
pointing it at you.

308
00:35:02,655 --> 00:35:03,614
You do what you're told.

309
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,489
Did you see me lock
the back doors?

310
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:11,934
Yeah.

311
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:14,211
So what?

312
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:16,729
Did it look like he
and I were friends?

313
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:18,327
If I knew you were
hiding in there,

314
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,805
you wouldn't be breathing now.

315
00:35:19,837 --> 00:35:22,283
Shut your mouth.

316
00:35:22,315 --> 00:35:24,041
You're not helping.

317
00:35:24,073 --> 00:35:26,351
Look, take a deep breath.

318
00:35:33,903 --> 00:35:40,985
You had a
chance to get out.

319
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:41,944
Why did you hang around?

320
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:42,743
I didn't.

321
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:44,101
No.

322
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:47,330
He made me lock all the
doors and took away my keys.

323
00:35:51,805 --> 00:35:53,004
Who were you trying to call?

324
00:35:55,881 --> 00:35:57,368
What?

325
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,087
What do you expect?

326
00:35:59,118 --> 00:36:00,965
You said you were
here to help people.

327
00:36:00,996 --> 00:36:04,681
I am, but I had
to evaluate risk.

328
00:36:04,713 --> 00:36:06,839
You're not different
from the rest.

329
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,997
Oh, really, yeah?

330
00:36:08,028 --> 00:36:09,596
And what would you
do in my shoes?

331
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:10,595
Jesus, shut up.

332
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:11,665
Shut the fuck up.

333
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:19,706
Victor Strong, I
am arresting you

334
00:36:19,737 --> 00:36:21,743
on suspicion of the
illegal trafficking

335
00:36:21,775 --> 00:36:24,501
of class-A narcotics, the
illegal transportation

336
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:28,537
of weapons, kidnap,
false imprisonment,

337
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:29,927
wounding with
intent, and murder.

338
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,770
You have the right
to remain silent.

339
00:36:34,802 --> 00:36:35,969
Anything you do,
say can and will

340
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:37,648
be used against you
in a court of law.

341
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,966
You have the right
to an attorney.

342
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:40,644
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

343
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:41,995
one will be appointed for you.

344
00:36:44,711 --> 00:36:46,638
Put these on.

345
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,428
Put them on.

346
00:36:59,777 --> 00:37:02,104
Help him.

347
00:37:02,135 --> 00:37:02,734
Help him.

348
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:11,134
Move, move!

349
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,436
Sit your asses down.

350
00:37:29,467 --> 00:37:31,625
Sit, sit.

351
00:37:45,092 --> 00:37:46,371
How do I know you're a cop?

352
00:37:57,759 --> 00:38:00,125
Is anything you told me true?

353
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:01,204
Every damn word.

354
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:02,523
He's a fucking maniac.

355
00:38:02,555 --> 00:38:06,159
Don't listen to a
word that he says.

356
00:38:06,191 --> 00:38:09,835
Have you committed the crimes
that State Trooper Willow

357
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:11,554
Wallace says you have?

358
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:13,871
You have to do certain things
in life that you really

359
00:38:13,902 --> 00:38:14,671
don't want to do.

360
00:38:14,702 --> 00:38:15,749
You know that.

361
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:17,028
It's called sacrifice.

362
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,507
Oh, bullshit.

363
00:38:18,538 --> 00:38:21,224
Making millions from
worldwide criminal activity

364
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:25,460
and ripping societies apart by
feeding addiction and violence

365
00:38:25,492 --> 00:38:26,978
has nothing to do
with sacrifice.

366
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,650
It's greed.

367
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:33,851
I have to agree if
what she says is true.

368
00:38:33,883 --> 00:38:36,848
You know more than
anyone, Father,

369
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,966
that looking beyond
what is in front of you

370
00:38:38,998 --> 00:38:43,961
requires great courage
and introspection.

371
00:38:43,993 --> 00:38:45,439
You have more
blood on your hands

372
00:38:45,471 --> 00:38:47,598
than anyone I've
ever encountered.

373
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:50,507
You can spin this any way you
want, you're not fooling me.

374
00:38:53,783 --> 00:38:56,988
What are you talking about?

375
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,547
Who's this act for?

376
00:38:58,578 --> 00:39:00,345
You think I don't know
what's really going on?

377
00:39:00,377 --> 00:39:01,904
Oh, you think you
do but you don't.

378
00:39:01,936 --> 00:39:03,581
Stop the bullshit,
I'm not buying it.

379
00:39:03,613 --> 00:39:04,901
And whether he is or
not makes no difference.

380
00:39:04,932 --> 00:39:06,219
You're going to kill him anyway.

381
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:07,898
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I don't know what's

382
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,216
going on between
the pair of you,

383
00:39:09,248 --> 00:39:12,213
but whatever it is,
we can resolve it

384
00:39:12,244 --> 00:39:14,930
here and now without any
more blood being spilt.

385
00:39:14,962 --> 00:39:17,927
Like I said, Father, you need
to look further than what's

386
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:19,486
in front of your eyes.

387
00:39:19,517 --> 00:39:21,124
She couldn't resolve this
now even if she wanted to.

388
00:39:21,156 --> 00:39:25,559
Her strings are being pulled by
something far greater than her.

389
00:39:25,591 --> 00:39:28,628
Says the dirty ex-cop
who got thrown in jail.

390
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:32,912
You were a cop?

391
00:39:32,944 --> 00:39:35,309
Oh, he didn't tell
you that part?

392
00:39:35,341 --> 00:39:36,789
I thought he might leave it out.

393
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,067
Shut your mouth.

394
00:39:38,098 --> 00:39:40,864
All you do is lie.

395
00:39:40,896 --> 00:39:41,704
You don't know me.

396
00:39:41,735 --> 00:39:45,140
I wish that were true.

397
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:46,091
Enlighten me.

398
00:39:51,046 --> 00:39:54,571
I know that after the
tragic death of his wife,

399
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:57,567
he pushed back
against the system.

400
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,646
I know that his
attitude to crime

401
00:39:59,677 --> 00:40:01,763
changed and he started
helping the people he

402
00:40:01,794 --> 00:40:05,200
should have been arresting.

403
00:40:05,232 --> 00:40:08,716
He gave up the home
address of a cop.

404
00:40:08,747 --> 00:40:10,315
An innocent man
is going to spend

405
00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:13,712
the rest of his life eating
through a fucking straw because

406
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,309
of you.

407
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:17,268
Do you actually believe
what you're saying?

408
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:19,905
You really think it
went down that way?

409
00:40:19,937 --> 00:40:22,343
So you don't deny it?

410
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:25,260
All he's interested in
is treading on people

411
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:26,978
until he gets what he wants.

412
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:30,615
And when he does, he doesn't
give the injured or the dead

413
00:40:30,646 --> 00:40:31,804
a second thought.

414
00:40:34,843 --> 00:40:36,800
Wouldn't you love
to take those off?

415
00:40:40,117 --> 00:40:42,322
How would you do it?

416
00:40:42,354 --> 00:40:44,592
Would you take my
gun and shoot me?

417
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:48,787
Would you use your fists?

418
00:40:52,305 --> 00:40:55,390
What would you give to wrap
your hands around my throat

419
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:56,301
to stop me talking?

420
00:41:02,854 --> 00:41:05,219
I'll give you a chance
to do the right thing.

421
00:41:05,251 --> 00:41:08,258
Or what are you going to do?

422
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:09,336
I'll make you regret it.

423
00:41:09,368 --> 00:41:11,853
No, no, no, stop all this.

424
00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:14,650
I'm warning you.

425
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,128
Make her regret, how?

426
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,684
Is threatening all you can do?

427
00:41:20,715 --> 00:41:24,760
Why don't you tell the priest
what violence is like for you?

428
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:28,117
How is it for you?

429
00:41:28,148 --> 00:41:30,754
If I've ever used force, it
has been in the line of duty.

430
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:32,832
That's the bullshit
you hide behind.

431
00:41:32,864 --> 00:41:35,310
If you want to hear the truth,
you need to start speaking it

432
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:37,348
yourself.

433
00:41:37,379 --> 00:41:39,186
Don't turn this around on me.

434
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:42,023
I am doing my job.

435
00:41:42,055 --> 00:41:43,262
Tell me the truth.

436
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:45,979
I'll tell you the truth.

437
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:48,856
He spent years becoming
the most feared criminal

438
00:41:48,888 --> 00:41:50,774
in the state of Massachusetts.

439
00:41:50,806 --> 00:41:53,651
He's a fucking animal.

440
00:41:53,683 --> 00:41:56,680
Stop hiding who you
are and start speaking.

441
00:42:02,274 --> 00:42:05,639
I was found guilty of
corruption in a public office.

442
00:42:05,671 --> 00:42:07,317
They kicked me out of
the police department

443
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:10,035
and threw me in jail.

444
00:42:10,066 --> 00:42:12,033
I was facing 10 years
jail time if they

445
00:42:12,065 --> 00:42:14,990
could make the charges stick.

446
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:15,661
They couldn't.

447
00:42:20,776 --> 00:42:24,501
You know what I've always
struggled to figure out?

448
00:42:24,532 --> 00:42:29,096
Did the death of Jesse
cause you to be like this,

449
00:42:29,127 --> 00:42:32,444
or is it you being like this
that cost the death of Jesse?

450
00:42:48,748 --> 00:42:52,313
This is the respect
that he has for the law,

451
00:42:52,344 --> 00:42:55,190
shooting a state trooper who
was offering him a way out.

452
00:42:55,222 --> 00:42:57,867
If I didn't shoot you
I'd be dead already.

453
00:42:57,898 --> 00:43:00,585
Tonight I offered him a way out.

454
00:43:00,616 --> 00:43:02,822
I told him since we still
have a case against him,

455
00:43:02,854 --> 00:43:06,339
he's going to be arrested sooner
or later so he's not buried

456
00:43:06,371 --> 00:43:07,769
in a shallow grave first.

457
00:43:10,246 --> 00:43:12,293
All he had to do
was come in with me.

458
00:43:12,324 --> 00:43:13,851
We would give him
witness protection,

459
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:17,848
he would give us
his organization.

460
00:43:17,879 --> 00:43:19,286
You lying bitch.

461
00:43:19,317 --> 00:43:22,483
He could have refused, he could
have walked away and taken

462
00:43:22,514 --> 00:43:25,839
his chances, but the unhinged
lunatic preferred to shoot out.

463
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:30,155
You shot me first without
so much as a word.

464
00:43:30,187 --> 00:43:32,751
Who are you going to believe?

465
00:43:32,783 --> 00:43:35,310
A state trooper or
this piece of shit?

466
00:43:35,341 --> 00:43:42,303
If he's who you say he
is, where's your backup?

467
00:43:42,334 --> 00:43:44,820
Good question.

468
00:43:44,852 --> 00:43:46,178
They're on their way.

469
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,098
And when they get here
you're going to be in a box

470
00:43:47,129 --> 00:43:47,777
where you belong.

471
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:49,016
A box?

472
00:43:49,047 --> 00:43:51,254
A cage, a box, you
know what I mean.

473
00:43:51,286 --> 00:43:54,011
If I'm a criminal as high
profile as you say I am,

474
00:43:54,043 --> 00:43:55,289
why are they not here already?

475
00:43:55,321 --> 00:43:58,127
They will get here
when they get here.

476
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:02,522
I'm blowing the lid on
this entire thing tonight.

477
00:44:02,554 --> 00:44:03,361
No, please.

478
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:03,993
No, don't.

479
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:18,987
You had a loose
connection there, Father,

480
00:44:19,018 --> 00:44:21,864
I fixed it for you.

481
00:44:21,895 --> 00:44:25,579
Your back up need
directions now?

482
00:44:25,611 --> 00:44:29,855
I want you to watch him while
they go pick up the phone.

483
00:44:29,887 --> 00:44:30,965
Can you deal with that?

484
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:37,168
It'll be my backup calling
to give further instructions.

485
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,877
They traced the call
on the landline.

486
00:44:42,234 --> 00:44:45,559
You can do this.

487
00:44:45,591 --> 00:44:47,118
Yes.

488
00:44:47,149 --> 00:44:50,474
Yeah, I can do it.

489
00:44:50,505 --> 00:44:53,391
I'll go pick up the phone
and see what's happening

490
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:54,551
and I'll be right back.

491
00:44:54,582 --> 00:44:56,588
OK?

492
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,219
Yes.

493
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,494
Sit back down.

494
00:45:10,526 --> 00:45:11,653
Tell me you don't
believe this bullshit.

495
00:45:11,685 --> 00:45:13,052
We need to act now
or we're both dead.

496
00:45:13,084 --> 00:45:14,650
I don't want to hear
any more from you.

497
00:45:14,682 --> 00:45:16,448
Come on, think.

498
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,166
We don't have time for this.

499
00:45:18,198 --> 00:45:19,965
She's a cop.

500
00:45:19,996 --> 00:45:21,244
We do what she says.

501
00:45:21,275 --> 00:45:22,642
You're got to make
me do something

502
00:45:22,674 --> 00:45:23,920
I really don't want to do.

503
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:26,829
This is Willow.

504
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:32,344
Yeah, I put them
both in my control.

505
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:41,063
Take off my shoe.

506
00:45:41,095 --> 00:45:41,543
What?

507
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:42,342
Why?

508
00:45:42,374 --> 00:45:44,060
Just fucking do it.

509
00:45:44,092 --> 00:45:44,452
Come on.

510
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:48,089
Give it to me.

511
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,445
I've been undercover
for of years.

512
00:45:59,477 --> 00:46:00,884
I'm still a cop.

513
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:02,523
That bitch in there she's
a liar, she's dirty.

514
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:06,359
It's me who's
discovered the truth.

515
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,636
We need to act now.

516
00:46:08,668 --> 00:46:10,913
She's going to come back
here and kill both of us.

517
00:46:10,945 --> 00:46:13,311
You need to go and get my gun.

518
00:46:13,343 --> 00:46:14,990
Father, listen to me.

519
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:18,186
Peter, we're both going to die
unless you're going get my gun.

520
00:46:18,218 --> 00:46:20,384
You have to go now.

521
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:22,342
Go.

522
00:46:22,374 --> 00:46:22,974
Quick.

523
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:27,649
You don't want me to
wait until you get here?

524
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,451
No, I can handle that.

525
00:46:33,483 --> 00:46:35,161
I've said I can
fucking handle it.

526
00:46:49,547 --> 00:46:50,506
What about the priest?

527
00:46:56,301 --> 00:47:00,185
No, I don't have a
problem with that.

528
00:47:00,216 --> 00:47:00,815
Just get here.

529
00:47:31,665 --> 00:47:34,502
You disappoint me, Father Peter.

530
00:47:38,138 --> 00:47:41,703
When you took a vow to
join the priesthood,

531
00:47:41,735 --> 00:47:44,612
didn't that also come
with abiding by the law?

532
00:47:52,284 --> 00:47:58,166
All I asked you to do was
your duty as a citizen,

533
00:47:58,197 --> 00:48:02,753
as a man of God, and watch
over a wanted criminal.

534
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:09,387
You've chosen to
listen to him instead.

535
00:48:12,463 --> 00:48:13,024
Big mistake.

536
00:48:32,444 --> 00:48:33,243
How cute.

537
00:48:37,398 --> 00:48:38,997
Do you think this
makes a difference?

538
00:48:44,472 --> 00:48:48,556
Whatever Strong has told
you, he is an outlaw

539
00:48:48,588 --> 00:48:53,024
and I am here to arrest him,
with or without your help.

540
00:49:10,806 --> 00:49:14,251
If you don't reveal
yourself now,

541
00:49:14,282 --> 00:49:19,405
Father, not only will
you lose this church,

542
00:49:19,437 --> 00:49:21,355
you will also lose your liberty.

543
00:49:27,788 --> 00:49:29,186
Last chance, Father.

544
00:49:44,492 --> 00:49:45,651
You don't have to do this.

545
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:54,490
If you give up
your organization,

546
00:49:54,522 --> 00:49:58,166
that can get you into a
witness protection program.

547
00:49:58,198 --> 00:49:59,557
All you got to do
is drop the gun.

548
00:50:05,311 --> 00:50:08,668
Thanks for the offer,
but I think I'll pass.

549
00:50:12,544 --> 00:50:13,623
You're making a big mistake.

550
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:21,623
The difference between
you and me, Strong,

551
00:50:21,655 --> 00:50:23,740
is that I know
where I'm heading,

552
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:27,536
and I won't crash out
at the last moment.

553
00:50:27,568 --> 00:50:31,006
You're just another piece
of shit standing in my way.

554
00:51:01,894 --> 00:51:03,212
It's OK, Father.

555
00:51:07,928 --> 00:51:10,015
It's OK.

556
00:51:10,046 --> 00:51:13,012
You did what you had to do.

557
00:51:13,043 --> 00:51:16,567
Stop talking.

558
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:18,646
I don't want to
hear another word.

559
00:51:18,678 --> 00:51:21,842
She was going to kill me and
then she was going to kill you.

560
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:23,801
You had no choice.

561
00:51:23,832 --> 00:51:25,391
You did the only
thing you could.

562
00:51:28,987 --> 00:51:29,835
Talk to me.

563
00:51:29,866 --> 00:51:31,952
It was either her or us.

564
00:51:31,984 --> 00:51:32,583
Say it.

565
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,498
It was her or us.

566
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:44,852
Good.

567
00:53:15,001 --> 00:53:16,959
That wound can't
be cauterize again.

568
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,914
You need to get to a hospital
before it's too late.

569
00:53:26,669 --> 00:53:27,668
This will be over soon.

570
00:53:38,857 --> 00:53:40,616
Is that the first
time you shot someone?

571
00:53:50,486 --> 00:53:52,963
I haven't fired a weapon
since the Gulf War of '91.

572
00:54:00,076 --> 00:54:02,162
I didn't know a
military padre would

573
00:54:02,193 --> 00:54:06,478
have to open fire on anyone.

574
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:12,711
You take an oath when
it comes down to it,

575
00:54:12,743 --> 00:54:16,140
you're soldier
first, priest second.

576
00:54:19,616 --> 00:54:19,976
Right.

577
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:30,653
I was on patrol with my
unit, we were attacked

578
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:33,882
by a bunch of insurgents.

579
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:38,637
I did what I had to do.

580
00:54:44,831 --> 00:54:54,470
Tonight, all of this
has taken me right back there.

581
00:54:54,502 --> 00:54:59,536
Tonight, all of this
has taken me right back there.

582
00:55:04,651 --> 00:55:06,210
I had no idea you had
been through that.

583
00:55:09,487 --> 00:55:10,086
Why would you?

584
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,005
I'm familiar with this church.

585
00:55:18,037 --> 00:55:19,636
I've seen you around.

586
00:55:22,154 --> 00:55:23,921
It's never occurred
to me that you would

587
00:55:23,952 --> 00:55:25,031
have been in the military.

588
00:55:27,748 --> 00:55:29,226
What makes a priest
do that anyway?

589
00:55:33,103 --> 00:55:37,986
For most, it's a
personal need to serve

590
00:55:38,018 --> 00:55:39,217
with those in the front line.

591
00:55:43,053 --> 00:55:44,252
But it was different for you.

592
00:55:49,727 --> 00:55:52,004
You and I may have more
in common than you think.

593
00:55:59,676 --> 00:56:00,635
Pass me my cell.

594
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:06,509
I just want to
show you something.

595
00:56:38,837 --> 00:56:43,792
I have a son who I spent
many years running away from.

596
00:56:47,148 --> 00:56:50,025
just as you have running away
from your daughter, Madison.

597
00:56:53,582 --> 00:56:59,017
I didn't think you were allowed
to have kids in the priesthood.

598
00:57:03,013 --> 00:57:07,057
Jude was conceived when I
was a very young man before I

599
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:09,934
joined the priesthood.

600
00:57:09,966 --> 00:57:15,160
But I wasn't man enough to
face up to my responsibilities.

601
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:22,321
I was weak.

602
00:57:22,353 --> 00:57:25,798
It was lust.

603
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:29,194
Find me a kid who's
not led by his dick.

604
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:33,391
I was supposed to be different.

605
00:57:33,422 --> 00:57:35,429
When other boys were
getting up to mischief,

606
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:40,655
I was watching the news, reading
the papers, going to church.

607
00:57:44,012 --> 00:57:49,215
All they ever wanted was
to be helpful to people.

608
00:57:49,246 --> 00:57:51,445
Be a good Christian,
become a priest.

609
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:59,764
We all make mistakes,
it's how we overcome them.

610
00:57:59,796 --> 00:58:05,238
My dad knew about
the birth of Jude.

611
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:09,235
He asked me a very
simple question,

612
00:58:09,266 --> 00:58:14,749
what's more important to you,
being a father to this boy

613
00:58:14,781 --> 00:58:15,740
or becoming a priest?

614
00:58:19,456 --> 00:58:26,378
I'd always wanted to be a
priest, it was my calling.

615
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:31,884
So I chose that over my own son.

616
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:45,877
I held him in my arms,
perfect little baby,

617
00:58:45,909 --> 00:58:46,829
just that one time.

618
00:58:50,385 --> 00:58:52,903
That was the day I knew I
was leaving town for good.

619
00:58:58,897 --> 00:59:01,183
Where'd you go?

620
00:59:01,214 --> 00:59:05,098
I went to a seminary out
West, got back to my studies,

621
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,329
eventually became a priest
and joined the Marines.

622
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:13,051
What happened to them?

623
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:18,285
I received news that his
mother died about 10 years ago.

624
00:59:18,317 --> 00:59:20,244
What about Jude?

625
00:59:20,275 --> 00:59:21,234
You know where he is now?

626
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:28,795
The last time I saw
him was in that photo.

627
00:59:28,826 --> 00:59:35,788
I just got back from Iraq,
that war really got to me.

628
00:59:35,819 --> 00:59:48,536
Made me realize I needed to face
my son, beg his forgiveness,

629
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:54,969
and tell them that if I could
make things different, I would.

630
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:55,960
How'd that work out?

631
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:07,036
He agreed to see me a few times,
listen to what I had to say,

632
01:00:07,068 --> 01:00:11,912
and it seemed like we
could maybe salvage

633
01:00:11,944 --> 01:00:15,380
some kind of a relationship.

634
01:00:18,377 --> 01:00:23,532
He was a very strong-minded
young man, but cold.

635
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:31,172
No emotions.

636
01:00:31,204 --> 01:00:34,410
I guess I could hardly
expect a tearful reunion,

637
01:00:34,441 --> 01:00:43,880
but still, it seemed like
he had no feelings about it

638
01:00:43,912 --> 01:00:44,871
or about me.

639
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:53,870
Oh, a good father
nurtures his child.

640
01:00:53,902 --> 01:00:59,505
He loves, shows him the way.

641
01:00:59,536 --> 01:01:00,455
I did none of that.

642
01:01:04,172 --> 01:01:08,008
He told me he wanted
nothing to do with me.

643
01:01:10,604 --> 01:01:19,365
So I had to agree to
abide by his wishes

644
01:01:19,396 --> 01:01:22,162
You know where he is now?

645
01:01:22,194 --> 01:01:23,552
I don't even know if he's alive.

646
01:01:29,426 --> 01:01:33,710
Don't make the same
mistake I made.

647
01:01:33,742 --> 01:01:35,668
Reach out to your
daughter, Madison,

648
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:41,062
now before you never
get the chance to again.

649
01:01:41,094 --> 01:01:43,851
I buried my feelings
for Jude for many years.

650
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:50,934
It took a war to shake
me back to reality,

651
01:01:50,965 --> 01:01:54,401
resurrect my feelings
for him and face him.

652
01:01:59,476 --> 01:02:00,875
What did it take for you?

653
01:02:03,632 --> 01:02:05,269
I never turned my
back on Maddie.

654
01:02:07,827 --> 01:02:10,553
But you haven't
seen her in years.

655
01:02:10,585 --> 01:02:13,351
So what?

656
01:02:13,382 --> 01:02:17,546
It's not a day goes by
that she's not on my mind.

657
01:02:17,578 --> 01:02:22,461
If you're going to truly
repent, admit to everything

658
01:02:22,493 --> 01:02:24,898
you've done.

659
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:27,409
The first thing you've got to
do is be honest with yourself.

660
01:02:30,964 --> 01:02:35,608
I've been deep cover
for so long, Father.

661
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,399
So damn long.

662
01:02:39,116 --> 01:02:40,355
Yes, but what?

663
01:02:46,428 --> 01:02:53,102
I only wanted one thing,
to revenge Jesse's murder.

664
01:02:56,180 --> 01:03:01,215
And to do that, I had to be
Victor Strong, the gangster.

665
01:03:04,691 --> 01:03:11,044
Whenever I thought about
Maddie, it got harder.

666
01:03:14,241 --> 01:03:20,595
So like you, I locked it away.

667
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:27,037
It's OK.

668
01:03:27,068 --> 01:03:31,104
You must look inside yourself,
bring this out, face her.

669
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:42,541
I liked being the outlaw,
I liked the escape.

670
01:03:42,573 --> 01:03:48,255
I felt no pain, no
guilt, until the man

671
01:03:48,287 --> 01:03:50,524
I was before had
completely disappeared.

672
01:03:54,400 --> 01:04:00,483
And then one day I drove
past Jessie's grave

673
01:04:00,515 --> 01:04:06,957
and I went to see her,
and I found myself

674
01:04:06,989 --> 01:04:09,035
talking to God for the
first time in as long

675
01:04:09,067 --> 01:04:09,625
as I can remember.

676
01:04:20,655 --> 01:04:26,649
We have different wounds,
Victor, but the same scars.

677
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:56,060
What's that?

678
01:04:58,817 --> 01:05:03,220
It's me facing Madison,
it's my confession.

679
01:05:03,252 --> 01:05:04,099
For what?

680
01:05:04,131 --> 01:05:06,817
For everything.

681
01:05:06,849 --> 01:05:10,493
Why I did what I did.

682
01:05:10,525 --> 01:05:16,407
It'll hurt her, but
it'll set her free too.

683
01:05:16,439 --> 01:05:20,563
Did you do some of the
things Willow said you did?

684
01:05:20,594 --> 01:05:23,400
Yeah.

685
01:05:23,431 --> 01:05:26,557
I was deep cover.

686
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:30,992
I was working a special
deniable operation

687
01:05:31,024 --> 01:05:35,708
that only four people,
including me, knew about.

688
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:41,542
Well, why can't we call them,
ask them to get you out,

689
01:05:41,573 --> 01:05:44,299
get you reunited with Madison?

690
01:05:44,331 --> 01:05:49,286
To of 'em are dead, and
the other one is dirty.

691
01:05:52,483 --> 01:05:55,199
This letter details
the entire thing.

692
01:05:57,877 --> 01:05:59,763
How I was kicked out of
the police department

693
01:05:59,795 --> 01:06:02,521
was all a cover story.

694
01:06:02,552 --> 01:06:04,799
I was sent to prison
on bogus charges

695
01:06:04,831 --> 01:06:08,187
to get on the inside as one
of them, it was the only way.

696
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:15,509
Maddie needs to know why I
left her, why I did what I did.

697
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,666
She deserves to
know all of this.

698
01:06:17,698 --> 01:06:20,783
And then once she
does, she needs

699
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:23,780
to reveal it to the world.

700
01:06:23,811 --> 01:06:27,296
Why can't you do this together?

701
01:06:27,327 --> 01:06:28,127
Look at me, Father.

702
01:06:31,403 --> 01:06:34,529
I'm going to be dead soon.

703
01:06:34,561 --> 01:06:37,406
I can call you a doctor.

704
01:06:37,438 --> 01:06:39,684
I don't think you're hearing me.

705
01:06:39,715 --> 01:06:41,841
There was evidence
in this letter

706
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:46,318
that one of the leading cops of
the Massachusetts State Police

707
01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:51,631
is not only dirty, he is running
the entire criminal network

708
01:06:51,663 --> 01:06:53,262
that I have been infiltrating.

709
01:06:56,299 --> 01:06:58,385
Get to someone higher.

710
01:06:58,416 --> 01:07:03,660
Someone who can get
you somewhere safe

711
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:05,977
and get the truth out.

712
01:07:06,009 --> 01:07:08,894
This bastard's rage
spreads far and wide.

713
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:11,452
He has a hell of a lot
of people working for him

714
01:07:11,483 --> 01:07:13,530
who are ready to bury me.

715
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:16,638
We have to get this to Madison
so she can seek justice.

716
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:27,756
Look, if I stand beside you,
the police will listen to me.

717
01:07:27,787 --> 01:07:31,752
You don't have to do this,
you don't have to die here.

718
01:07:31,783 --> 01:07:33,390
Do you really think
Willow was going

719
01:07:33,422 --> 01:07:36,746
to let you walk out of here?

720
01:07:36,778 --> 01:07:39,744
This corrupt cop is the
only other person alive

721
01:07:39,776 --> 01:07:43,380
who knows about my operation.

722
01:07:43,412 --> 01:07:45,298
There is evidence
in here linking him

723
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:47,696
to the entire thing.

724
01:07:47,728 --> 01:07:52,252
I have been playing him
and he now knows that.

725
01:07:52,283 --> 01:07:55,759
We have to get this truth
out there so we can stop him.

726
01:07:58,596 --> 01:08:02,360
There's a lawyer
I know who handles

727
01:08:02,392 --> 01:08:04,199
cases against the state.

728
01:08:04,231 --> 01:08:07,636
We can call him, he can take
you in, get you a safe route.

729
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:13,470
This thing is too damn
big I wouldn't survive,

730
01:08:13,502 --> 01:08:15,508
just like Jesse didn't.

731
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:17,865
Jesse?

732
01:08:17,897 --> 01:08:19,815
What in hell does this
got you do with Jesse?

733
01:08:22,493 --> 01:08:25,250
This corrupt son of a bitch
is who murdered my wife.

734
01:08:39,595 --> 01:08:42,800
I told you Jesse
was ambitious, I

735
01:08:42,832 --> 01:08:45,798
told you she was a high flyer.

736
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,514
It's all true.

737
01:08:48,546 --> 01:08:52,071
She was like that from
the first day I met her.

738
01:08:52,103 --> 01:08:54,709
How did you meet her?

739
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:57,347
We met at the Police Academy.

740
01:08:57,378 --> 01:08:59,983
She's a cop too?

741
01:09:00,015 --> 01:09:01,533
I went PD she went state.

742
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:08,574
She spent her entire time
working a drug cartel,

743
01:09:08,606 --> 01:09:12,731
dealing with intelligence
and organizing covered ops.

744
01:09:12,762 --> 01:09:16,519
She built a massive case
against this same dirty cop.

745
01:09:20,594 --> 01:09:24,718
After she died, I should
have turned my attention

746
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:31,632
to Maddie, been the dad
that she wanted me to be.

747
01:09:31,663 --> 01:09:35,148
But I knew this wasn't some
bullshit robbery gone wrong,

748
01:09:35,179 --> 01:09:37,618
I knew that the truth
had been covered up.

749
01:09:40,974 --> 01:09:46,529
So I got myself recruited
to state to get my revenge.

750
01:09:50,485 --> 01:09:54,489
I made the decision to do
this, even though it cost

751
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,678
my relationship with Maddie.

752
01:09:59,955 --> 01:10:03,600
I told my mother to take her
somewhere safe, somewhere

753
01:10:03,631 --> 01:10:08,035
that even I didn't know,
so there was no way my work

754
01:10:08,066 --> 01:10:09,226
leading to where she was.

755
01:10:21,733 --> 01:10:26,497
I now have all of this
to bring him down,

756
01:10:26,529 --> 01:10:29,853
to finally finish this.

757
01:10:29,885 --> 01:10:34,808
But how can you protect
her if you're already dead?

758
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:40,594
You can't protect me, brother,
but you can't protect her.

759
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:46,637
How?

760
01:10:46,668 --> 01:10:48,794
Why me?

761
01:10:48,826 --> 01:10:53,150
You have to get this
confession to Maddie.

762
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:55,627
Put her somewhere safe within
the church organization,

763
01:10:55,659 --> 01:10:58,864
hide her, speak
to that lawyer you

764
01:10:58,896 --> 01:11:04,419
can trust, get this truth out
there and set my daughter free.

765
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:06,089
What makes you think
I could do all this?

766
01:11:09,006 --> 01:11:12,051
I'm not here by chance, Father.

767
01:11:12,083 --> 01:11:13,729
What do you mean?

768
01:11:13,761 --> 01:11:16,846
I chose to come here tonight.

769
01:11:16,878 --> 01:11:19,963
I chose you to do this.

770
01:11:19,994 --> 01:11:22,002
How did you choose me?

771
01:11:22,033 --> 01:11:22,632
Why?

772
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:28,715
I already knew we had
something in common.

773
01:11:28,746 --> 01:11:29,106
What?

774
01:11:33,901 --> 01:11:34,501
Jude.

775
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:43,620
You know Jude?

776
01:11:43,651 --> 01:11:47,615
You know where he is?

777
01:11:47,647 --> 01:11:48,934
Yeah.

778
01:11:48,966 --> 01:11:50,653
But how?

779
01:11:50,685 --> 01:11:53,210
No one does.

780
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:56,758
Jude made it so no one
could find him or trace him.

781
01:12:02,912 --> 01:12:03,631
Is he alive?

782
01:12:06,508 --> 01:12:08,875
Yes.

783
01:12:08,906 --> 01:12:12,271
Oh, my God,

784
01:12:12,303 --> 01:12:13,901
I wouldn't celebrate just yet.

785
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:18,096
It was Jude that murdered Jesse.

786
01:12:26,688 --> 01:12:33,210
No, no, no, you must
have the wrong person.

787
01:12:33,242 --> 01:12:34,848
No.

788
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,958
He now runs the
entire damn thing.

789
01:12:42,672 --> 01:12:46,916
You need to get this to
my girl and stop him.

790
01:12:46,948 --> 01:12:48,267
Nobody's stopping anybody.

791
01:12:52,422 --> 01:12:52,942
Maddie?

792
01:12:57,018 --> 01:13:01,302
Jude, I don't believe it.

793
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:02,133
Put your gun down.

794
01:13:05,369 --> 01:13:07,136
Let her go.

795
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:10,653
No, please, please,
don't do this.

796
01:13:10,684 --> 01:13:11,643
Shut up, old man.

797
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:22,920
Look at me, Maddie.

798
01:13:22,952 --> 01:13:25,677
It's OK.

799
01:13:25,709 --> 01:13:28,834
You just block it out.

800
01:13:28,866 --> 01:13:30,752
Everything's going to be OK.

801
01:13:30,784 --> 01:13:34,029
You want to watch your daughter
die like you did your wife?

802
01:13:34,061 --> 01:13:34,748
Fuck you.

803
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:35,380
Let go of me.

804
01:13:38,217 --> 01:13:40,622
Dad, what's happening?

805
01:13:40,654 --> 01:13:42,301
You were supposed to
be somewhere safe where

806
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:44,179
no one could find you.

807
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:46,976
Why am I involved in this?

808
01:13:47,008 --> 01:13:51,132
Everything you need to
know is in here, baby.

809
01:13:51,163 --> 01:13:54,329
Not like you're ever
going to get to read it.

810
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,240
Last fucking chance.

811
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:01,953
I swear to God I will shoot you.

812
01:14:09,705 --> 01:14:10,704
Put your gun down, Victor.

813
01:14:15,779 --> 01:14:16,666
What are you doing?

814
01:14:16,698 --> 01:14:18,145
You're a priest.

815
01:14:18,176 --> 01:14:19,815
I'm sorry, he's my son.

816
01:14:23,052 --> 01:14:23,811
He's a murderer.

817
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:47,915
Put the fucking gun down!
