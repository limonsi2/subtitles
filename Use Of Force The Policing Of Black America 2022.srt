in this for a while.

who hadn't slowed

their life down enough
to see that.

reminded me of some

I worked with at NPD.

and you knew that
it was wrong.

103

think that--

104

that could just happen.

you know.

I mean, you don't get
the right to kill somebody.

00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,993
You don't get the right to abuse
somebody.

109

of George Floyd's death,

110

so many people of all colors

for his mom,

117
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,688
to say “I can't breathe”,
it's not that he didn't try

118
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,357
to communicate,
he was very clear about

119
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,358

what in the world

123

were those officers thinking

124
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,829

about another

in behind my eyelids

138
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:54,080

kneeling on his neck

and he's looking directly into
the camera.

140
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,252
And he has his hand
in his pocket as if

141
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:02,964
he's casually kneeling down to
like, pick up a penny.

142

conscious of anyone

Floyd's fault

144
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,101
or participation in anything.

145
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,229
That had no legs to stand on.

146
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,858
Because he was not posing
a threat.

147
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,611
He was there on the ground,
really helpless.

148
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,363
And he still died.

149
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,530
All the times they've--

150
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,115
they've had police killings
on video

151
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,242
And you know that
they've had police killings

152
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,619
that weren't on video.

153
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,163
Uh, you know, there's always
been bigger, worse.

154
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,333
But I think this one has packed
up more powerful punch

155
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,502
because people were
now at home.

156
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,586

Seeing someone lose
their life

159

adds to that despair.

I think there was a few things
that came into focus

164
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:02,565
in this moment that have created
the conditions

165
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,150
where we are now.

166
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:11,241
So, you know for a month
or so prior to

167
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,159
the George Floyd's murder.

168
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,039
We had a lockdown.

169
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,793
People were in their homes,
who could be in their homes.

170

And connecting with each other
through screens

in a completely different way.

172
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,468
So, that's a part of it, right.

173
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,179
We're starting to see into every

ourselves

178
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,276
against a plague,
if you will.

179
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,404
That-- the president was calling
“a liberal hoax”,

180
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,905
from the very beginning.

181
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,618
Then you couple that
with Ahmaud Arbery's murder.

182
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,412
So I think people were already
like--

183
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:02,208
First of all, how are we just
seeing this and this happened

184
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,586
you know, a month prior to
getting this video.

185
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,172
And the people still haven't
been charged.

186
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,216
And then all this stuff
comes out about them,

187
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,011
about what they believe, right.

188
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,931
And then, of course,
you see this video.

189
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,975
I think what actually happened
is that

190
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,561
there's a muscle memory
that people have now

191
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:25,231
around police violence
and protest.

192
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,779
So, it's not the first time this
has happened.

193
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,076
And it's not, um, uh.

194
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,994
It's not new to us.

195
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:42,832
But I think over the last seven
years,

196
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,085
we now have a consciousness that
it's not enough

197
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:49,005
to just watch it
and be upset about it.

198
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:54,469
That coupled with four years of
a president

199
00:09:54,511 --> 00:10:00,767
who has literally opened
the sewer grids

200
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,562
and told white nationalists to
come up out of the sewer

201
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,274
and come be a part of our
society.

202
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,276
Be a part of our government.

203
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,448
I think all of those things have
collided in such a way

204
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,784
where people now--
It's not just people

205
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:22,455
turning up about police
brutality & police violence

206
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,748
You notice like--

207
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,209
you can't spin this story
any other way.

208
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:30,755
Who comes out when there's
protests, white militias.

209
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,258
Who's driving through crowds in
protests,

210
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,676
white nationalists,

211
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:38,430
who are unabashed about
their point of view.

212
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,976
And who have the cover of the
federal government.

213
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,938
PRESIDENT TRUMP:
Go home, we love you,
you're very special.

214
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,649
You've seen what happens,
you see the way others

215
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,986
are treated that
are so bad and so evil.

216
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,280
I know how you feel.

217
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:01,036
My whole life's work, um,
has been about

218
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,997
trying to figure
how do we keep black people

219
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,083
from experiencing
the worst of the system

220
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,961
while we are at the same time
still experiencing

221
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,548
an unbroken history of
white supremacy,

222
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,550
racial hierarchy,
and state violence.

223
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,052
I mean,
I'm part of a black church.

224
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,803
I argued a black church
has 400 years

225
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:19,512
of receipts.

226
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,305
[Chuckles]

227
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,765
Of dispend, of fighting

228
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,891
against white supremacy
everyday.

229
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,100
Everyday black pope in church
wakes up,

230
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,810
Everyday black folk in church
wakes up,

231
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,064
<i>* I testified</i>,
<i>my mama cried *</i>

232
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,858

233

00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,202

239
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,542
Hands up, don't shoot!

240
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,502
Hands up--

241
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,586
[indistinct shouting]

242
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,671
Shut 'em down, shut 'em,
shut 'em down

243
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,797
I shut 'em down

244
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,340
Shut 'em down,
shut 'em, shut 'em down

245
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,383
I shut 'em down

246
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,842
Shut 'em, shut 'em,
shut 'em down

247
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:58,927
I shut 'em down

248
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,553
Shut 'em down, shut 'em,
shut 'em down

249
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,680
I shut 'em down

250
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,264
Shut 'em down,
shut 'em, shut 'em down

251
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,307
I shut 'em down

252
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,850
Shut 'em, shut 'em,

253
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:06,893
I shut 'em down

Shut 'em, shut 'em,

00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,562
I shut 'em down

Shut 'em, shut 'em,
shut 'em down

257
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,357
I shut 'em down

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,359
Shut 'em, shut 'em,
shut 'em down

[***]

261
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,044
CHUCK D: (Narrating)
The slow murder of George Floyd
forever changed

262
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,131
a city with a history
of excessive use of force.

263
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:41,219
It changed America,
and it shocked the world.

264
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,682
A nation in crisis.

265
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,559
Our cities have burned.

266
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,310
Lives have been taken.

267
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,522
The voice of the oppressed
rise up when those

268
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,691
voices go unheard.

269
00:12:54,733 --> 00:13:03,867
[***]

270
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,084
So when they say, “Why do you
burn down the community,

271
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,919
why do you burn down
your own neighborhood?”

272
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,796
It's not ours.

273
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,798
We don't own anything!

274
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,718
We don't own anything!

275
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,805
There is-- Trevor Noah said it
so beautifully last night

276
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,141
There's a social contract that
we all have.

277
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,935
That if you steal
or if I steal,

278
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,937
then the person who is the
authority comes in,

279
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,522
and they fix the situation.

280
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:38,651
But the person who fixes
the situation is killing us!

281
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,279
So the social construct is
broken!

282
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:50,246
[***]

283
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,463
CHUCK D: (Narrating)
A movement started less than a
decade ago,

284
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,840
takes front stage once again.

285
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,967
It seems like it was
only yesterday

286
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,302
when the streets of America were
filled yp

287
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,013
with similar protests
and outrage

288
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,642
from the killings of
Oscar Grant, Michael Brown,

289
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:14,145
Philando Castile,
Alton Sterling,

290
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,982
Eric Garner, Stephon Clark,

291
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,277
LaQuan McDonald,
and Sandra Bland.

292
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,823
This time it was different.

293
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,408
But why?

294
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,328
DR. TAFT:
I think there
are a couple of things.

295
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,998
I think the first thing
um, that I would say is

296
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,668
we have a generational devide
or should I say,

297
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,878
a generation of uprise.

298
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,631
If you think about
Trayvon Martin in 2012.

299
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:45,260
Those teenagers, and um--

300
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,138
Let's say, young people that are
not protesting.

301
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,850
Let's say, if they are
22, 21 years of age.

302
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,436
They were 13 years of age when
that happened.

303
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,646
And they were already accustomed

304
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,732
to being on their devices.

305
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,192
And they probably had questions
then.

306
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:06,322
And now, after the string of
event from Trayvon Martin to

307
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,700
um Michael Brown,
to Eric Garner,

308
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:09,993
to Philando Castile

309
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,912
to Walter Scott,
to Jordan Davis--

310
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,456
no to LaQuan McDonald.

311
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,833
You know, the list continues--
Alton Sterling.

312
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,251
The list goes on and on.

313
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,129
At some point, I think as
a 13-year-old

314
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,213
you may ask the questions.

315
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,091
But now, as you begin
to live and--

316
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,552
Maybe your cognitive reasoning
is developing.

317
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,804
You begin to ask questions
because you're outside

318
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:30,889
of your parents' home.

319
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,557
And now, you're thinking
for yourself.

320
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,225
And so maybe, you're saying that
maybe something

321
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,477
is wrong.

322
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,062
So I think that, there--
there are questions that

323
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:37,937
are unanswered.

324
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,523
ALICIA:
I didn't know what I wanted to
do in four years

325
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,691
of college.

326
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,194
I was like
“I just wanna help people.

327
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,529
And I wanna, you know,
make my community better.”

328
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:50,033
So, when I was done
with college, I came home

329
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,577
and decided to make an impact
where I live.

330
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,580
And I learned actually
how to organize

331
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,792
and build power here on
the streets of-- of Oakland.

332
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,170
I started knocking on doors,
uh, talking with people

333
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:06,091
with an organization that had
initially started by fighting

334
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,301
police brutality
and police violence.

335
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:11,513
Uh, 10 years of organizing
in San Francisco.

336
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:15,266
You know, five or six years of
organizing here in Oakland

337
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,937
and at a certain point,
I felt it was important

338
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,606
to get a clear sense
of what the landscape

339
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:22,857
was nationally.

340
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,069
Uh, it's fine to be a big fish
in a small pond,

341
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,278
but there's a lot you miss

342
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,947
about the way that
the world works

343
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,116
and the way the country works.

344
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,118
I joined an organization

345
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,620
that organizes
domestic workers.

346
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,497
These are women who clean homes,

347
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,125
who care for the people that we
care the most.

348
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,794
My mother and my grandmother did
domestic work.

349
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:47,340
And um, it was a few short weeks
before I joined that

350
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,926
organization that I helped
create Black Lives Matter.

351
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,386
[Chuckles]

352
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,887
ALICIA:
No, I did not know, that Black
Lives Matter

353
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,975
would become the force that it
is today.

354
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,519
Although, I-- I certainly
wanna say that

355
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:03,898
it was something that
I wished for but couldn't see

356
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,568
beyond my own faith that it
could happen

357
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,279
and my own determination
that we should try it.

358
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,323
We should try to figure out,
how to create the kind of

359
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:16,870
movement that could actually
have impact for black folks.

360
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,997
Um, Patrisse, and Opal,
and I,

361
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,167
when we created
Black Lives Matter,

362
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:26,671
we started building platforms
for people who were angry

363
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,133
about Trayvon being murdered

364
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,677
and his killer being
acquitted.

365
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,846
And we wanted people to do
something more than

366
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,348
be angry on social media.

367
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,475
We wanted people to do more,
than like argue

368
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,435
with each other about
whether or not

369
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,354
it was racist
on social media.

370
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,231
Because at the end of the day,
that kind of liking,

371
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,859
retweeting, sharing,
arguing back and forth

372
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,361
with somebody
you've never met

373
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,447
doesn't change policy,
it doesn't change culture.

374
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,324
It doesn't change
the fact that

375
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:57,535
mothers all over this country,
um,

376
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:01,247
are dealing with deep loses as a
result of our failure

377
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,665
to actually deal with,

378
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,377
what it means to keep
our communities safe

379
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,546
uh, and who-- who is responsible
for that.

380
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,549
There have been protests
happening all over the globe,

381
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,469
more protests then the whole
last period of civil race.

382
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:21,518
And here we are,
and you can't get anybody

383
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,396
at the top of the ticket to
acknowledge that

384
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,816
all around them, people are
turned up about the fact

385
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,694
that black people are being left
out and left behind.

386
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,906
CHUCK D: (Narrating)
There have been many protests
against police brutality

387
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,534
and systemic racism in America's
history.

388
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,120
Some protests were a result
of a community

389
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,747
overwhelmed by the actions
of law enforcement

390
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,374
and the lack of accountability

391
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,376
in the criminal justice system.

392
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,087
ANCHORMAN 3:
The only persons on the streets
of Miami's riot

393
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,672
are police, looters
and torchmen

394
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,008
setting dozens of fires that are
now burning

395
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,759
out of control.

396
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,762
There are people being beaten,
there is looting.

397
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,224
It is a dangerous night
in the city of Los Angeles.

398
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,400
CHUCK D: (Narrating)
Today's protests
have come in many forms.

399
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:13,445
From everyday citizens taking
to the streets,

400
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:17,282
to activists launching
social media campaigns.

401
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,868
Modern day athletes have
leveraged their influence

402
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,288
in exercising their right
to protest peacefully,

403
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,332
putting their livelihood
and safety on the line.

404
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,336
I mean, ultimately
it's to bring awareness

405
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:32,547
and make people now realize
what's really going on

406
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,757
in this country.

407
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:34,966
There are a lot of things that
are going on

408
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,051
that are unjust,

409
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,303
people aren't being held
accountable for.

410
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,889
And that's something that needs
to change.

411
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,267
That's something that
know this country stands for

412
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:47,062
freedom, liberty,
justice for all.

413
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,855
And it's not happening for all
right now.

414
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,232
ANCHORMAN 4:
Colin Kaepernick, he actually
told a group of reporters

415
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,526
yesterday that he's received
death threats..

416
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,280
Everybody.

417
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,449
And I mean,
everybody can give back.

418
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,576
It's our duty to help
our neighbors.

419
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,079
Walter Payton Smith,
Tyler, my coach

420
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,957
which in turn ended up having a
stronger impact on me.

421
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:11,670
Motivated me, to try to have an
impact on the world.

422
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,713
We should all be start to be
more like Walter Payton.

423
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,173
Thank you, God bless.

424
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,300
[Audience cheering
and applauding]

425
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,760
And we grew up in Denver

426
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,845
which is not a predominately
black area.

427
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,181
The one thing I learned
to do at a young age

428
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,724
is I learn that some people are
perceiving me

429
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:25,892
as dangerous.

430
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,310
So I was taught that,
you know, “Hey,

431
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,354
people might see you
as a threat.”

432
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,357
So, like, I-- I naturally
started putting

433
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,025
on a big smile
as soon as I see anybody.

434
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,193
We flash a smile,
let them know that

435
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:36,486
I'm a friendly person.

436
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,364
But, you know,
I just I feel like that issue

437
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,658
when it comes to, you know,
police brutality

438
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,411
a lot of it is deep rooted
in the stigma

439
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,246
of what a black person
represents.

440
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:52,168
The idea of the constitution,
the idea of-- of America

441
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,503
is special.

442
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:56,673
The problem is, is that America
has never really

443
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:58,550
lived up to the constitution
as a whole

444
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,053
not for everybody that lives in
America, you know.

445
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,430
And I tell about--

446
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,597
I tell people I'm proud to be
American, you know,

447
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,349
I grew up American
and I have no problem

448
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,600
with being an American.

449
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,395
I wanna be American,
I'm proud to be American.

450
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,522
But America needs to do better
for its people,

451
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:15,191
you know, and-- and--
and it's a real issue.

452
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:24,367
[***]

453
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,458
MICHAEL:
Um, when I was a student at
Bible College in 1999,

454
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,793
I was physical and sexually
assaulted by police officers.

455
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,004
So I was a victim of police
brutality

456
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:39,090
while I was attending Bible
College to be trained

457
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,592
as a minister.

458
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,803
And that trauma, that sexual and
physical trauma

459
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:47,432
at the hands of the police
officers really forced me

460
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,768
to have to have
my own internal reckoning

461
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,562
with how will I use
my own call

462
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:55,857
in my mission,
as a-- as a man of God,

463
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,735
as a minister,
as a community leader

464
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:02,572
to dismantle these systems and
that's what my work

465
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,532
has been for the last
20 or so years.

466
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,743
Well obviously,
after it happened to me

467
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,329
I was devastated,
I was living with my pastor

468
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,663
at the time at in San Jose

469
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,874
and on my way home,
two officers pulled me over,

470
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,627
pulled me out my car,
grabbed my groin area,

471
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,963
did a pretty much strip search
on me with a gun.

472
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,216
Uh, you know, trained on me and
told me if I was black,

473
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,050
they'd throw--

474
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,426
If I was in Alabama in 1950,

475
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:24,844
they'd throw me
in empty field.

476
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:27,013
One of ‘em said he was gonna
break my effin' neck.

477
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,183
So, I came out of that
experience with wounds

478
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,018
in my body that
I still see today

479
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,978
from the handcuffs to bruises.

480
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,023
Um, my spirit was deeply broken
and traumatized.

481
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:39,150
I was asking God why this
happened to me, you know,

482
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,944
I'm out here,

483
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,613
on my way to heaven
and oh, so glad, you know.

484
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,616
But my young people told me um,
in our Bible studies

485
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:47,867
some weeks later this happened
to them

486
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,035
all the time.

487
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,669
ANCHORWOMAN 5:
In the 50 shot killing
of Sean Bell,

488
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:59,838
the unarmed man on his wedding
day.

489
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,799
They were seriously wounded in
the hail of gunfire.

490
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:05,260
The shooting incident sparked
strong reactions

491
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,678
throughout the city,
leading up to--

492
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,597
VALERIE:
Sean was my middle son,

493
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:13,435
his gift from God
was to play baseball

494
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,562
and also to be electrician.

495
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,109
About, maybe a quarter to 4:00,
I get a phone call

496
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,653
saying,
Sean was in an accident.

497
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,030
So, the first thing
I thought,

498
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,157
okay, maybe a car accident
because he was the driver

499
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,783
in the car.

500
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:31,578
So I'm jumping up,
getting ready

501
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:35,999
get to Jamaica Hospital,
that's where I used to work.

502
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,960
And when they escorted me,
I'm seeing a lot of people

503
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,337
outside the hospital.

504
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,797
When they escorted me
to this room in the hospital

505
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:45,550
I knew, that was a room that was
gonna tell me

506
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,928
something bad has happened
to our son.

507
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:54,100

there are undercover officers

513
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,076
in the strip club who think they
hear that

someone has a gun.

515
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,913

a confrontation,

50 shots.

horrific day,

I'm going to a wedding.

he's licensed, he's carry--
he's licensed to carry,

593
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,573
he was trying to get out
his id and his wallet

00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,742
out his um, pocket.

595
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:25,497
And he let the officer know that
he was rea--

596
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:28,500
He had a firearm and he was
reaching for his wallet.

597

in his arm.

Philando did nothing wrong.

This man said, I have--
you know, a license to carry

604
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,519

his documents

605
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,687
and he's shot five times.

606
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,772
Like, why?

607
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,487
CHUCK D: (Narrating)
Court records dating back
to 2002 showed that

608
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:00,782
Philando averaged more than
three traffic stops per year.

609
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:04,577
My name is John Choi,
and I have the great honor

610
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:07,414
of being able to serve
the people

611
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:11,126
of Ramesy County Minnesota as
their elected county attorney

612
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,044
which includes the--
the city of St. Paul

613
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:14,796
and the surrounding suburbs.

614
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:18,758
I was first elected in 2010
and uh, so, I've been

615
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,136
in office since that time.

616
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:24,431
In many instances, what I see
happening

617
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:29,894
in deadly force cases is that
the officer actually

618
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:34,441
created uh, this situation
by not following

619
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:35,817
their training.

620
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:38,987
There are many cases across
America where--

621
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:42,782
If the officer acted
differently.

622
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:45,076
If they didn't assume that
everybody around them

623
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:48,079
was some deadly threat to them.

624
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:51,750
That we would have very, very,
different outcomes.

625
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,418
You know,
the Tamir Rice case

626
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,922
in Cleveland strikes a chord
where that particular officer

627
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,799
created that situation.

628
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:03,094
And they didn't have to end up
shooting that boy.

629
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:06,931
The case in my jurisdiction
involving Philando Castile,

630
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:09,893
the same thing where he has all
of these assumptions

631
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:12,979
and he raced towards
using deadly force

632
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:14,481
when he didn't have to.

633
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:17,275
Everything was telling him that
he didn't have to.

634
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:20,820
There was a young child,
a 4-year-old child

635
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:22,238
in that car.

636
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,242
There was a woman with Philando
Castile in that car.

637
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:29,621
Why on earth would any human
being shoot an officer

638
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:32,082
in that particular situation?

639
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:35,877
And the way that Philando
disclosed

640
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,797
beyond what the law ever
required him to do,

641
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:43,301
but he said,
“Sir, I have to tell you,

642
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:46,596
that I d-
I do have a firearm on me.”

643
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,056
He said it that way.

644
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:50,684
In the most disarming way.

645
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:54,396
And for some reason,
the officer raced

646
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:57,357
to the conclusion that
he was about to be shot.

647
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:03,154
Philando Castile,
if I remember in Minnesota.

648
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:08,451
I believe he was pulled over 35
or 40 times

649
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:10,704
and many of those were because
there was a warrant

650
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:12,414
for his arrest.

651
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:14,374
Which sounds terrible

652
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:17,544
But actually the warrant was for
an unpaid court fee.

Under the circumstances,

673
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,097
just because he was a police
officer

674
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,640
that makes it okay.

only to take another law
enforcement job

but a recent phenomenon.

00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:41,211

I was asked to volunteer as kind
of a statistical

685
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:43,880
consultant for a state-wide
task force to look

686
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:45,632
at traffic stops.

687
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:47,592
And it turns out, the state of
North Carolina

688
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:51,096
was the first state in the
nation to mandate

689
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:54,015
collecting data
on every traffic stop.

690
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:56,309
But nobody had ever
looked at it.

691
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:59,104
Five years later,
seven years later I think,

692
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:00,939
we published a book and finally
got our hands around,

693
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,316
it was very difficult
to work with,

694
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:06,277
but-- well, the initial findings
were that um--

695
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,156
a black man has about twice the
odds of being pulled over

696
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:12,283
compared to a white man.

697
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:14,744
And once they're pulled over,
they've got about twice

698
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:18,957
the odds of being searched after
a routine traffic stop.

699
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,960
And the experience
of an African-American

700
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:25,588
in North Carolina is,
you know,

701
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,008
it's the four times more likely
just by getting

702
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:29,718
in the car, that you're--

703
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:30,969
that that drive down
the street

704
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,388
is gonna lead to a search of the
vehicle.

705
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,807
Now, search of the vehicle
implies that

706
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:38,476
the police officer has
determined for some reason

707
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:41,896
in his mind that you-- you pose
a potential threat.

708
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:45,150
That you are a suspect
in a-- in a--

709
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:46,818
some kind of criminal
proceeding,

710
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,279
‘cause if you're merely speeding

711
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,573
or you ran through
a stop sign,

712
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,658
that doesn't mean that
the officer needs

713
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,993
to search your car.

714
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:58,204
It's humiliating,
it's alienating,

715
00:33:58,246 --> 00:33:59,748
it can cost a lot of money.

716
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:01,666
I mean, there's all kinds
of things that can happen

717
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,544

we think of as a routine

00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:09,938
Pure, unequivocal murder.

supposed to be there

782
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:16,027
So, the-- the lens that they
should be looking

783

with this person?

Why are they unconscious?

791
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,543
a way to look at this.

792
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,878
Somebody needs help,
instead they came with

793
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,882
a punitive, criminalistic
perspective which is,

794
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:39,342
this is a criminal.

795
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:41,720
And then they can't claim
the idea that there was a gun

796
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:43,596
which you can't see
in the video

797
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,432
and they claim that
it's a gun.

798
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:49,060
But before that, what' very
crucial to understand is that

799
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:50,437
they had already communicated

00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:52,063

00:41:41,501 --> 00:41:43,878
As America began to form,

865
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,131
laws supporting use of force
were created

866
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:48,008
and woven into our constitution.

867
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:52,762
In 1667,
it was written into the law

868
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:58,643
for the state of Virginia
by Anglican men.

869
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:00,562
So, Christian men.

870
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:03,440
Because the debate was

871
00:42:03,481 --> 00:42:06,443
whether slaves
or enslaved Africans

872
00:42:06,484 --> 00:42:08,028
could be proselytize.

873
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:09,696
Because if they were
proselytized,

874
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:13,533
it was customary according
to Anglican tradition

875
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:15,827
that Anglican and Christian
brothers and sisters

876
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:17,078
could not enslave
one another.

877
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:20,832
So if that's the standard
of practice

878
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:25,086
that says, when you come to
enslave Africans,

879
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:27,380
you don't recognize their
humanity nor do you see

880
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:32,844
them as, if they are baptized
and welcomed into the faith,

881
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:35,930
they are not your brothers and
sisters in Christ.

882
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,893
CHUCK D: (Narrating)
Between 1840
and the early 1900s,

883
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:41,770
policing was under
tight control

884
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:44,314
of the political elite.

885
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:47,359
The communities most targeted
by harsh policing tactics

886
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,903
were recent European immigrants.

887
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:52,197
As African-Americans fled
the horrors

888
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:54,032
of the Jim Crow south,

889
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:55,575
they too became the victims
of brutal

890
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:58,328
and punitive policing
in the northern cities

891
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,121
where they sought refuge.

892
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:03,208
6 Million black people fled
to northern cities

893
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:04,876
in the Great Migration

894
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,962
yet the racism
by police continued

895
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:10,924
based on bias limiting
Black people's civil rights.

896
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:13,551
My people come here
from Texas,

897
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:14,803
and from North Carolina

898
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:16,513
If you were a black
in the Bay Area,

899
00:43:16,554 --> 00:43:17,847
you'd came from South.

900
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:19,224
Why did you come
from the South?

901
00:43:19,265 --> 00:43:21,768
Because in the ‘40s,
the ‘50s, and the ‘60s,

902
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,978
our parents and grand-parents
were fleeing

903
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,314
the violence
of the Ku Klux Klan

904
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:27,816
and racist police.

905
00:43:27,857 --> 00:43:29,567
And they got on a train

906
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:32,153
and took the train to the last
stop

907
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:36,116
to get as far away from these
white vigilantes

908
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:37,075
in the South.

909
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:39,285
And the last stop
was the West--

910
00:43:39,327 --> 00:43:40,745
West Open train station.

911
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:42,414
That's how a lot of black people
came here

912
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:44,833
Came here to work on the naval
shipyard in Oakland.

913
00:43:44,874 --> 00:43:47,252
Hunters Point Shipyard.

914
00:43:47,293 --> 00:43:50,338
So black people come here from
the South fleeing

915
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,256
racial violence.

916
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:53,967
My father grew up in Alabama.

917
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:57,929
And he had several horrible
experiences with the police.

918
00:43:57,971 --> 00:43:59,264
And he would often
talk about that.

919
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:02,267
He didn't talk about them
with the hope that

920
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:03,476
we would hate the police.

921
00:44:03,518 --> 00:44:05,437
He spoke about them to explain
to us

922
00:44:05,478 --> 00:44:06,604
where he came from.

923
00:44:06,646 --> 00:44:08,023
The environment that
he grew up in,

924
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:10,942
why he left Alabama,
how he came to New Jersey,

925
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:13,611
and what motivated him to make
sure that his family

926
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:14,779
would do better.

927
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:16,614
[Protesters clapping]

928
00:44:16,656 --> 00:44:19,284
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR:
We cannot turn back.

929
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:21,953
There are those who are asking
the devotees

930
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:26,875
of civil rights:
“When will you be satisfied?”

931
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:31,171
We can never be satisfied
as long as the Negro

932
00:44:31,212 --> 00:44:34,674
is the victim of the unspeakable
horrors

933
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:36,760
of police brutality.

934
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:40,096
[Protesters clapping]

935
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:44,267
FRANK:
People who live in poverty
and people of color

936
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:46,895
have experienced a set of
relations with the criminal

937
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:49,981
justice system that people
who look like me,

938
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:51,649
and people who live
in my neighborhood,

939
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:53,568
and people who have professional
jobs,

940
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,030
and who are white can't even
understand.

941
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:59,783
We can't even empathize, because
we can't even

942
00:44:59,824 --> 00:45:03,495
possibly conceive of
a police officer

943
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:06,581
who to me would never be
disrespectful

944
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:07,999
or unpleasant.

945
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:11,670
How that police officer
might behave differently

946
00:45:11,711 --> 00:45:12,921
on the other side of town.

947
00:45:12,962 --> 00:45:15,882
Or with a person who fits
a different profile.

948
00:45:17,258 --> 00:45:20,470
This is the stuff that's
been happening for years,

949
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:22,013
for decades.

950
00:45:22,055 --> 00:45:24,391
And members of the black
community have been saying

951
00:45:24,432 --> 00:45:25,684
that this has been happening.

952
00:45:25,725 --> 00:45:27,686
With the increase in--

953
00:45:27,727 --> 00:45:31,106
in phone cameras,
uh with body cameras

954
00:45:31,147 --> 00:45:33,233
uh, people are seeing the truth,
people are seeing

955
00:45:33,274 --> 00:45:35,902
what black communities
had always known

956
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:40,031
is that there are a large of
very abusive officers.

957
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:43,201
And so um, we're finally seeing
the stories that

958
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:44,244
we've been told.

959
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:47,038
[Screams]

960
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:52,752
Back up, back the fuck up!

961
00:45:52,794 --> 00:46:01,928
[***]

962
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:16,943
[***]

963
00:46:22,824 --> 00:46:31,875
[***]

964
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,294
According to Kentucky law,
the use of force

965
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:37,589
by Mattingly and Cosgrove
was justified

966
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:39,299
to protect themselves.

967
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:42,093
This justification bars us from
pursuing

968
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:45,764
criminal charges in
Miss Breonna Taylor's death.

969
00:46:45,805 --> 00:46:48,850
Please don't be too nice.

970
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:51,770
Like when you guys put somebody
in the car

971
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:53,605
and you're protecting their
head, you know.

972
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:56,232
The way you put
the hand over...

973
00:46:56,274 --> 00:46:58,777
Like, don't hit their head and
they've just killed

974
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:00,362
somebody, don't hit their head.

975
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:02,947
I said, “You can take
the hand away, okay?”

976
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:04,741
[Crowd cheering]

977
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:07,452
ANCHORWOMAN 9:
Officer Edward Nero, has
been acquitted of all charges

978
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:10,955
for his role in the 25-year-old
black man's death.

979
00:47:10,997 --> 00:47:14,626
A police officer was found
not guilty in the shooting

980
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:16,294
death of a black driver.

981
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:20,840
VICTIM'S SISTER:
You know, my brother
had no gun, no gun.

982
00:47:20,882 --> 00:47:22,634
Why couldn't you just be
a man and said,

983
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:24,302
“I made a mistake.”

984
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:25,512
No mistakes made

985
00:47:25,553 --> 00:47:26,846
If we look at the Laquan
McDonald's shooting,

986
00:47:26,888 --> 00:47:28,306
uh shooting.

987
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:32,769
In Laquan McDonald,
we saw uh, eventually

988
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:34,145
that the officer was lying.

989
00:47:34,187 --> 00:47:36,314
That there were lies
in reports.

990
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:39,109
But the police department hid
that, the government hid that

991
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,569
from the people,
from the defense attorneys.

992
00:47:41,611 --> 00:47:43,697
It required some uh, professors

993
00:47:43,738 --> 00:47:45,448
from the University
of Chicago

994
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,992
to force that material out and
into the public.

995
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:51,246
CHUCK D: (Narrating)
Today's political climate has
carried on the tradition

996
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:53,373
of protecting those police
officers

997
00:47:53,415 --> 00:47:56,167
who have been accused of
excessive use of force.

998
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:58,670
The killing of Breonna Taylor
by undercover police

999
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:00,505
is another example.

1000
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:09,472
[***]

1001
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:24,487
[***]

1002
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,209
RUDY GIULIANI:
Well, as the President
pointed it out

1003
00:48:38,251 --> 00:48:40,295
and as we all know
I think, logic.

1004
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:44,883
99% if not more of the police

1005
00:48:44,924 --> 00:48:48,345
con-- contact with public
is a-- is a problem.

1006
00:48:49,471 --> 00:48:52,390
CHUCK D (V.O):
The policies of local,
state and federal governments

1007
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:54,934
have made policing
harder than ever.

1008
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:06,738
Many young officers join the
force with good intentions.

1009
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,574
Some end up poorly trained
and negatively influenced

1010
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:12,827
by their superiors in
a culture of intimidation

1011
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:14,746
and protecting their own.

1012
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:17,916
This results in escalation
between law enforcement

1013
00:49:17,957 --> 00:49:20,085
and the communities
they serve.

1014
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:23,088
In Washington DC,
the nation's capital,

1015
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:24,923
where our country's laws are
created,

1016
00:49:24,964 --> 00:49:26,633
and democracy and equal rights

1017
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:28,259
under the law are the foundation

1018
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:30,470
of our criminal justice system,

1019
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:34,182
Metropolitan Police Department
is a prime example

1020
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:37,519
of bad training
and a outdated culture.

1021
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,481
The agency has had a history
of excessive use of force,

1022
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:44,192
over-policing,
and dehumanizing stop

1023
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:45,777
and frisk policies.

1024
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:48,279
This culture has made it
hard to train

1025
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:49,989
and keep young officers

1026
00:49:50,031 --> 00:49:53,118
with the potential to make
a positive change.

1027
00:49:53,159 --> 00:50:00,000
My dad was a police officer with
DC for about 30 years.

1028
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:04,546
I was never pushed by him
to become one

1029
00:50:04,587 --> 00:50:08,133
but as time went on and I got
older, I-- I decided it was

1030
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:09,342
something that I was interested
in doing.

1031
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,972
You know,
when I first started

1032
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:17,142
everyone was kind of motivated
and you know,

1033
00:50:17,183 --> 00:50:18,518
we're gonna--

1034
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,645
we're gonna do some good here,
but as time went on

1035
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:24,149
there was so much pressure
coming from the top

1036
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,067
to get these stats

1037
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:29,320
I mean, we were making
on average 8 to 10 arrests

1038
00:50:29,362 --> 00:50:32,240
a day and we worked
five days a week.

1039
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:35,577
Sean Lojacono has been fighting
to keep his job

1040
00:50:35,618 --> 00:50:37,203
as a DC police officer.

1041
00:50:37,245 --> 00:50:39,748
Today we learned DC Police
aren't having it.

1042
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:40,999
You may remember this video,

1043
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:42,334
we first showed you
last year.

1044
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:44,544
RADIO DISPATCHER:
38, 56.

1045
00:50:44,586 --> 00:50:46,338
[Overlapping speech]

1046
00:50:46,379 --> 00:50:47,630
Why are you grabbing
my shit?

1047
00:50:47,672 --> 00:50:48,298
Come on, man.

1048
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,051

1049
00:50:51,593 --> 00:50:53,261
BYSTANDER:
Yeah, don't do that.

1050
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:54,554
SEAN:
You see the video
and you're like,

1051
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:56,556
“What the hell is this,
this is horrible.”

1052
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:59,476
That's how I learned to search
like that

1053
00:50:59,517 --> 00:51:00,935
it was from the officers,
because you know,

1054
00:51:00,977 --> 00:51:03,563
as a rookie officer
you're very timid,

1055
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:05,690
so when you get out
on a street,

1056
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:06,941
you're searching people.

1057
00:51:06,983 --> 00:51:08,651
You don't really get that much
training

1058
00:51:08,693 --> 00:51:09,986
on how to search.

1059
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:11,863
In fact, I made the argument in
my trial board.

1060
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:13,531
There was no simulation

1061
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:16,284
for how to conduct
a proper search.

1062
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:18,536
You know, it was basically like,
there's no wrong

1063
00:51:18,578 --> 00:51:20,789
or right way to do,
just make sure it's thorough.

1064
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:23,708
It's not like I take
pleasure in that.

1065
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,378
If they didn't keep it there,

1066
00:51:26,419 --> 00:51:28,171
I-- I-- I wouldn't search it,
I wouldn't search there.

1067
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:29,673
But, uh, you know,
unfortunately, that's--

1068
00:51:29,714 --> 00:51:32,842
that's the nature of the beast
when it comes to drugs

1069
00:51:32,884 --> 00:51:34,094
and drug dealing.

1070
00:51:34,135 --> 00:51:35,720
Um, because they know
most officers

1071
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:37,055
don't wanna check there,

1072
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:39,432
because it's a very
uncomfortable private spot.

1073
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:41,059
Obviously, as you saw
from the video,

1074
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:45,188
he was very uncomfortable
and felt very violated

1075
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:47,774
and uh, you know,
we ended up leaving,

1076
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:48,900
he didn't get arrested.

1077
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:50,276
And he filed a complaint.

1078
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:55,323
We're tired of being harassed
every single day,

1079
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:57,283
because you think...

1080
00:51:57,325 --> 00:51:59,369
I'm talking about
the officers here.

1081
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:03,164
...you think that
there's more going on.

1082
00:52:03,206 --> 00:52:04,624
Then what's going on?

1083
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:06,835
There's nothing going on,
but a group of guys enjoying

1084
00:52:06,876 --> 00:52:08,003
their community.

1085
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:11,089
It was investigated
by the department

1086
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:12,716
and I was in-- I was cleared
for that incident.

1087
00:52:14,676 --> 00:52:17,512
I-- believe it or not,
they-- they gave me a--

1088
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:19,097
what's called,
“a Letter of Prejudice.”

1089
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:22,267
It's a small corrective action
letter,

1090
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:24,269
basically saying,
“Hey, you know,

1091
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:27,731
you should've done better, and
you should've--

1092
00:52:27,772 --> 00:52:31,609
you should've just arrested him
for drinking in public.

1093
00:52:31,651 --> 00:52:32,068
So--

1094
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,611
[Chuckles]

1095
00:52:33,653 --> 00:52:36,072
Not only did they say, “Hey
everything about that search

1096
00:52:36,114 --> 00:52:39,451
was okay, but

1097
00:52:39,492 --> 00:52:41,327
you shouldn't have used
your discretion

1098
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:43,621
and you should have arrested him
for some petty

1099
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:45,331
little offence.”

1100
00:52:45,373 --> 00:52:48,126
REPORTER 1:
Although, Lojacono was
disciplined for this search,

1101
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:50,920
the department ultimately moved
to fire him

1102
00:52:50,962 --> 00:52:52,630
for a second similar search

1103
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:54,966
caught on body-worn
camera video

1104
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:56,593
but not publically available.

1105
00:52:56,634 --> 00:52:59,262
Lojacono's defense argued
the department's

1106
00:52:59,304 --> 00:53:01,931
decision to fire him
was a knee jerk reaction

1107
00:53:01,973 --> 00:53:05,643
to the public outrage over that
viral cell-phone video

1108
00:53:05,685 --> 00:53:08,188
we first showed you
a year ago.

1109
00:53:08,229 --> 00:53:10,190
The attorney telling
the panel, they understand

1110
00:53:10,231 --> 00:53:12,067
the department's position,

1111
00:53:12,108 --> 00:53:14,652
but Lojacono should
not be the fall guy.

1112
00:53:14,694 --> 00:53:17,405
I mean I was, you know,
certainly stunned.

1113
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:23,161
Um, caught off guard for sure
and uh, felt--

1114
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:25,955
felt very betrayed
by the department.

1115
00:53:25,997 --> 00:53:27,290
For sure.

1116
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:30,210
It's probably not
the popular answer, but

1117
00:53:30,251 --> 00:53:33,963
I stand by
what I did on that day.

1118
00:53:34,005 --> 00:53:38,218
That's how I was trained
and if I was told differently

1119
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:39,844
I-- I-- I would be
the first person

1120
00:53:39,886 --> 00:53:41,096
to do it differently.

1121
00:53:41,137 --> 00:53:43,473
If this is a problem,

1122
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:48,353
what steps have you taken to
rectify the fact that

1123
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:51,690
there are dozens of people now,
sitting in jail

1124
00:53:51,731 --> 00:53:56,194
on drug charges as a direct
result of my searches

1125
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:58,780
which have been consistent
across the board

1126
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:01,866
and you're--
you've now decided that

1127
00:54:01,908 --> 00:54:03,952
that's an improper search.

1128
00:54:03,993 --> 00:54:08,039
So, to me that's signaling all
of those cases

1129
00:54:08,081 --> 00:54:09,416
should be re-looked at.

1130
00:54:09,457 --> 00:54:11,459
There is this thing that we call
the proximity rule.

1131
00:54:11,501 --> 00:54:13,795
And what it means is that the
person that is closest

1132
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:16,214
to the error, or the thing that
is closest to the error

1133
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:19,509
normally gets blamed
for-- for-- in totality.

1134
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:21,386
Uh, I have to dispute that,
because what ends up

1135
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:23,805
happening and what we know
to be true,

1136
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:25,765
is that the officer
is usually a result

1137
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:27,559
of a lot of problems that went
wrong

1138
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,352
and now that is being acted out
in that

1139
00:54:29,394 --> 00:54:30,353
officer's performance.

1140
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:33,231
The training of police officers

1141
00:54:33,273 --> 00:54:35,108
whether it was
military police officers,

1142
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:37,235
when I was an army prosecutor

1143
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:40,155
or the many, many,
law enforcement officers

1144
00:54:40,196 --> 00:54:44,409
and agencies I worked with as a
federal prosecutor in D.C.

1145
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:46,119
And it's not just

1146
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:47,912
the Metropolitan Police
Department, MPD.

1147
00:54:47,954 --> 00:54:50,957
They are the local crime
fighters in the district

1148
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:54,753
and you know, different agencies
I think um,

1149
00:54:54,794 --> 00:54:58,131
have different abilities when it
comes to training

1150
00:54:58,173 --> 00:54:59,591
their officers.

1151
00:54:59,632 --> 00:55:01,801
I've seen the good,
the bad, and the ugly.

1152
00:55:01,843 --> 00:55:04,054
Just like most of the police
officers I worked with

1153
00:55:04,095 --> 00:55:07,640
in my career were good, they
took their oath seriously.

1154
00:55:07,682 --> 00:55:10,101
They were there
to protect and serve.

1155
00:55:10,143 --> 00:55:11,978
But boy, the bad ones.

1156
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,104
You know,
I've always said it,

1157
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:14,606
it's not like one bad apple

1158
00:55:14,647 --> 00:55:16,232
that you can pick out
of a barrel

1159
00:55:16,274 --> 00:55:17,776
and enjoy the rest
of the apples.

1160
00:55:17,817 --> 00:55:20,403
It's like-- it's like
a drop of poison

1161
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:21,321
in a pot of chili.

00:55:28,078 --> 00:55:30,955
CHUCK D: (Narrating)
Becoming a police officer has
long been considered

1163
00:55:30,997 --> 00:55:33,291
a noble and selfless profession.

1164
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,669
Police officers have been held
in high esteem,

1165
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:38,797
however, over time that
has changed.

1166
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:41,049
Policing today has become more
dangerous

1167
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:42,425
and challenging.

00:57:08,845 --> 00:57:10,889
He pulls a gun
on the officer.

1208
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,057
[Screaming]

1209
00:57:12,098 --> 00:57:13,475
She begged for her life.

1210
00:57:13,516 --> 00:57:16,311
POLICE OFFICER 4:
No!
No, please don't shoot me!

1211
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:18,938
ANCHORMAN 17:
An officer pursues,
the man with the machete

1212
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,940
then turns back and starts to
chase the officer.

1213
00:57:20,982 --> 00:57:23,068
POLICE OFFICER 4:
Hey, don't do it!
Don't do it!

1214
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:26,488
ANCHORMAN 17:
As the man pushes forward,
the machete still in hand.

1215
00:57:26,529 --> 00:57:29,282
The officer runs into the
street, trips and falls

1216
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:31,534
with the armed man standing over
him.

1217
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:33,453
Several other officers
open fire.

1218
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:42,629
[***]

1219
00:57:51,721 --> 00:57:54,182
CHUCK D: (Narrating)
The demands of the job
are stressful.

1220
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:57,811
Long shifts, encounters
with violent offenders,

1221
00:57:57,852 --> 00:58:00,146
it can be a thankless job.

1222
00:58:01,022 --> 00:58:02,774
Growing up, uh,

1223
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:05,777
my interactions with police
officers have changed.

1224
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:09,572
I've had the opportunity to make
some really good friends

1225
00:58:09,614 --> 00:58:10,824
You know, we go on the road.

1226
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:13,576
And uh, we travel
with police officers.

1227
00:58:13,618 --> 00:58:15,120
I've had a lot of good
conversations with--

1228
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:16,579
with officers and I--

1229
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:19,874
I try to understand just how
hard their job--

1230
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:22,460
when you are tasked
with a force of protectin'

1231
00:58:22,502 --> 00:58:23,628
and servin'.

1232
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,588
You're gonna go on
and face some danger

1233
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,298
and you have to always
be ready, because

1234
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,800
they have families--
they have--

1235
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:30,218
they are regular people.

1236
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,345
You know,
they have a tough job.

1237
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:34,097
But then, you know,
looking back

1238
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:36,975
on some of the videos
and things that happened

1239
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:39,185
And uh, and I'm just thinking
myself like, “How--

1240
00:58:39,227 --> 00:58:40,687
How does that happen?”

1241
00:58:40,729 --> 00:58:44,524
You know, uh, uh,
like a Walter Scott video.

1242
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:47,694
My man is running away,
he was shot at the back.

1243
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:51,489
To me, I feel like a cop,
his main job is to

1244
00:58:51,531 --> 00:58:53,241
make sure that environments are
safe

1245
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:54,993
and that's a-- that's a tough
duty and that's great.

1246
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:58,329
But my man gets pulled over
for a tail light

1247
00:58:58,371 --> 00:59:00,790
and you know, there is
interaction

1248
00:59:00,832 --> 00:59:02,959
and all we know
what we see on the video.

1249
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:05,587
And we see him running away
and he gets shot in the back.

1250
00:59:05,628 --> 00:59:07,088
You know, multiple times.

1251
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:08,381
And it's like, Well--

1252
00:59:08,423 --> 00:59:09,507
I think the court system should
have some say

1253
00:59:09,549 --> 00:59:11,009
in this.”

1254
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:12,844
I think that whatever he did
wrong, could have the chance

1255
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:15,221
to go in front of the jury
and be held at trial

1256
00:59:15,263 --> 00:59:17,807
and let the court system,
you know do what it does.

1257
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:19,476
Now, a lot of times,
the court system

1258
00:59:19,517 --> 00:59:21,561
has failed black people
as well.

1259
00:59:21,603 --> 00:59:24,439
But I rather be failed
by the court system than

1260
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:25,690
be shot in the back.

1261
00:59:25,732 --> 00:59:28,234
There has to be like--
When is force necessary?

1262
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:32,197
JONATHAN:
So, I wanted to become
a police officer,

1263
00:59:32,238 --> 00:59:34,616
because when I was
a young uh, teenager, I--

1264
00:59:34,657 --> 00:59:37,494
I recall sitting on the front
steps of my home

1265
00:59:37,535 --> 00:59:39,037
with my-- my brother.

1266
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:40,872
Uh, and we were-- we lived
on a very quiet street.

1267
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:42,707
But with-- within earshot,

1268
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:44,876
was pretty busy street,
you know.

1269
00:59:44,918 --> 00:59:46,961
Majority African-American
neighborhood.

1270
00:59:47,003 --> 00:59:49,339
Uh, we had seen, you know.
the police frequently

1271
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:50,715
in our neighborhood.

1272
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:52,634
But on this particular day,
our friends were walking

1273
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:53,885
down the street.

1274
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:55,762
Uh, they passed our house
and we saw them wave

1275
00:59:55,804 --> 00:59:58,223
and you know, nothing--
No greater conversation

1276
00:59:58,264 --> 00:59:59,349
than that.

1277
00:59:59,391 --> 01:00:01,059
But shortly after
they passed us,

1278
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:02,769
A police car uh,
pulled up on them.

1279
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:04,688
Police car pulled up on them.

1280
01:00:04,729 --> 01:00:06,314
Got out of the--
Officers got out of the car.

1281
01:00:06,356 --> 01:00:08,608
They were two white officers.

1282
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:12,070
Began to verbally abuse
my friends,

1283
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:13,530
my brother and I,
and my cousins

1284
01:00:13,571 --> 01:00:14,739
actually were with me,
too.

1285
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:15,699
We were staying there trying to
figure out

1286
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,909
what was going on.

1287
01:00:17,951 --> 01:00:20,412
Uh, as the conversation
continued with the police

1288
01:00:20,453 --> 01:00:21,621
and-- and my friends.

1289
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:23,915
Uh, we could see that everyone
was agitated

1290
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:26,543
up to a point where the police
officer slapped

1291
01:00:26,584 --> 01:00:28,420
and assaulted my friends.

1292
01:00:28,461 --> 01:00:30,296
Now I'm sitting there
with my cousins-- my cousins

1293
01:00:30,338 --> 01:00:33,299
and my brother and we felt
completely powerless.

1294
01:00:33,341 --> 01:00:35,468
So we watched this interaction.

1295
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:37,762
And it ended up where no one got
arrested,

1296
01:00:37,804 --> 01:00:39,764
The-- the-- our friends
weren't placed in the car

1297
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:41,141
and the police left
the scene.

1298
01:00:41,182 --> 01:00:44,060
But it left this indelible mark
on me.

1299
01:00:44,102 --> 01:00:46,771
Looking at the situation, again
feeling powerless

1300
01:00:46,813 --> 01:00:48,773
for my self,
but also feeling that

1301
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:51,901
I couldn't do anything
to uh-- to help my friends.

1302
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:54,279
I recalled at that point that
my father in the driveway

1303
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,947
a little bit further up
working on the car.

1304
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:58,324
So I ran to him and I had tears
in my eyes.

1305
01:00:58,366 --> 01:01:00,744
And I said, “Dad, I have to tell
you what just happened.”

1306
01:01:00,785 --> 01:01:01,911
And I went through
the whole story

1307
01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:03,621
and I explained to him what went
on and--

1308
01:01:03,663 --> 01:01:04,914
and the friends getting slapped

1309
01:01:04,956 --> 01:01:07,000
and the powerless feeling
and I said to him that

1310
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:09,294
somebody's gotta do
something about this.

1311
01:01:09,336 --> 01:01:11,129
And my father at that point was
working on the car,

1312
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:13,548
was fixing the oil and he--
and he slowly closed the hood

1313
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:14,966
and he wiped the oil
off his hands

1314
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:16,634
and he looked at me
and he said,

1315
01:01:16,676 --> 01:01:18,136
“When God gets you
to the point

1316
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:20,805
where you feel that someone has
to do something about it,

1317
01:01:20,847 --> 01:01:23,141
you are the someone
and the something,

1318
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:25,185
well, that's for you
to figure out."

1319
01:01:25,226 --> 01:01:26,895
At that point, I knew that
I had to go

1320
01:01:26,936 --> 01:01:28,146
to the police department.

1321
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:30,190
And in my mind I thought
I could fix all the ills

1322
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:32,484
of a bad police performance
by joining

1323
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:34,027
the police department.

1324
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:35,445
But I knew at that point that
that's what I needed to do.

1325
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:39,574
CHUCK D: (Narrating)
Today's police force looks very
different

1326
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:41,201
from one of decades ago.

1327
01:01:41,242 --> 01:01:43,828
There is more diversity
in its ranks,

1328
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:46,790
more leaders
who are black and brown.

1329
01:01:46,831 --> 01:01:50,377
Many of them call to make
a change in their community.

1330
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:59,719
While cities across America
struggle with reform,

1331
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:02,180
some communities and law
enforcement leaders

1332
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:05,350
have started to embrace
the changes being called for.

1333
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:08,728
CHIEF BISA:
We really have to focus
on culture internally

1334
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:10,146
in the police department.

1335
01:02:10,188 --> 01:02:12,691
You can bring all the diversity
into the department

1336
01:02:12,732 --> 01:02:14,984
that you want, but if you have a
culture

1337
01:02:15,026 --> 01:02:17,112
that's not inclusive,
it really doesn't matter,

1338
01:02:17,153 --> 01:02:20,990
you're gonna have the same kind
of, you know--

1339
01:02:21,032 --> 01:02:22,200
You're gonna have the same
culture

1340
01:02:22,242 --> 01:02:24,119
that you've already had
and you're gonna--

1341
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,704
you know, people are gonna do
the same thing that

1342
01:02:25,745 --> 01:02:27,038
they've already done.

1343
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,707
Our focus here at the Richmond
Police Department

1344
01:02:28,748 --> 01:02:30,417
has been um, building
relationships,

1345
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:32,836
with the community, because
that's how we feel like

1346
01:02:32,877 --> 01:02:35,547
we can prevent crimes
and solve crimes

1347
01:02:35,588 --> 01:02:37,007
when they do happen.

1348
01:02:37,048 --> 01:02:39,718
We look at policy and really
look at what the community

1349
01:02:39,759 --> 01:02:42,387
is asking of us and make sure
that our policies

1350
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:44,055
and procedures reflect that.

1351
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:46,224
So, we have kind of
a different community

1352
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:48,226
policing model then a lot of
other departments

1353
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:51,229
in which everything we do
is community pleasing,

1354
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:55,734
not just a program or you know,
a-- a few officers.

1355
01:02:55,775 --> 01:02:58,194
It's difficult to bring people
of color

1356
01:02:58,236 --> 01:03:00,071
into this profession, especially
with everything

1357
01:03:00,113 --> 01:03:01,489
that's going on.
Just not-- not--

1358
01:03:01,531 --> 01:03:06,077
Not just now, but really over
the last five plus years

1359
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:10,081
with, you know, Ferguson
and all the other departments

1360
01:03:10,123 --> 01:03:13,084
so, you know, how do I tell
somebody that looks like me

1361
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:16,254
to, “Oh, come join”, and then
they come to you know,

1362
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:18,590
a department or you know,
like the departments

1363
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:21,634
all across the-- the nation that
are predominantly white

1364
01:03:21,676 --> 01:03:23,887
or have a lot of,
you know, officers

1365
01:03:23,928 --> 01:03:27,140
that are not of color--

1366
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:29,601
And um, you know, how do
I tell you, “Yes, come work,

1367
01:03:29,642 --> 01:03:30,769
we're gonna do great things'.

1368
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:32,437
and we're gonna do
great things”.

1369
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:33,688
in the community.

1370
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,107
And you have the unique ability
to connect,

1371
01:03:36,149 --> 01:03:39,527
but they don't wanna see
themselves as wearing

1372
01:03:39,569 --> 01:03:41,071
this uniform because
they know

1373
01:03:41,112 --> 01:03:42,405
what the representation is,

1374
01:03:42,447 --> 01:03:45,867
they know that the history
of systemic oppression

1375
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:48,078
by people that wear
this uniform.

1376
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:50,622
And while there's many of us
that wear this uniform

1377
01:03:50,663 --> 01:03:52,123
that look like me

1378
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:54,250
have not participated
in that, we know that

1379
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:56,670
the history of
our profession has.

1380
01:03:56,711 --> 01:03:58,254
And so that's difficult
to overcome.

1381
01:03:58,296 --> 01:04:00,382
It's-- it's difficult for
those of us

1382
01:04:00,423 --> 01:04:01,966
who do wear this uniform

1383
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:04,219
to reconcile with that fact
that, “Yeah, we're a part of

1384
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:08,264
this system that has oppressed
our communities”.

1385
01:04:08,306 --> 01:04:11,309
Um, but there's also the
opportunity to change that

1386
01:04:11,351 --> 01:04:13,186
How can we change that
moving forward?

1387
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:15,021
What can I do now
as a chief of police

1388
01:04:15,063 --> 01:04:17,649
to put in policies
and practices

1389
01:04:17,691 --> 01:04:20,985
within my organization,
so that we no longer have

1390
01:04:21,027 --> 01:04:22,487
that system of
oppression here

1391
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:23,905
in the city of Richmond?

1392
01:04:29,661 --> 01:04:38,586
[***]

1393
01:04:39,879 --> 01:04:42,549
CHUCK D: (Narrating)
Smart phone and body camera
technology

1394
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:44,426
have captured the many instances

1395
01:04:44,467 --> 01:04:47,012
of excessive use of force
that people

1396
01:04:47,053 --> 01:04:50,181
in black and brown communities
already knew.

1397
01:04:50,223 --> 01:04:53,685
Social media has amplified
and exposed these crimes.

1398
01:04:53,727 --> 01:04:55,937
Without these tools,
making police

1399
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:58,148
and prosecutors more accountable

1400
01:04:58,189 --> 01:05:01,609
to the public would remain
in the shadows.

1401
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:06,072
America, with all its power,
wealth, and knowledge,

1402
01:05:06,114 --> 01:05:09,534
has the ability to turn around a
centuries' old issue

1403
01:05:09,576 --> 01:05:12,996
that can forever bring
our communities together.

1404
01:05:13,038 --> 01:05:15,040
The killing of black men
and women

1405
01:05:15,081 --> 01:05:18,460
during traffic stops needs
immediate solutions.

1406
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:21,129
DR. TAFT:
The cameras don't lie.

1407
01:05:21,171 --> 01:05:24,174
And I think that the advent of
social media

1408
01:05:24,215 --> 01:05:27,761
of putting it on the homes
um, and on the devices,

1409
01:05:27,802 --> 01:05:29,888
because people live
on the devices now

1410
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:31,890
It's not anything
you can escape,

1411
01:05:31,931 --> 01:05:33,558
it's not anything
you can hide.

1412
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,060
I think that there are some
positivity that

1413
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:36,186
comes with that.

1414
01:05:36,227 --> 01:05:39,314
I do feel though,
at the same time, um,

1415
01:05:39,356 --> 01:05:42,400
that if people are want
to make a change-- and it's--

1416
01:05:42,442 --> 01:05:44,944
it's always kind of funny
because you really can't tell

1417
01:05:44,986 --> 01:05:47,739
anyone how to feel
or how they should protest

1418
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:50,325
or what they should do because
you really don't know

1419
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:52,619
what happens with them or what
they have experienced.

1420
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:55,747
I do think some other strategies
could be applied

1421
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:58,375
and that protest
is just one form,

1422
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:01,169
a one part of the solution,
um, but there are other

1423
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:03,046
approaches that may be
necessary as well.

1424
01:06:04,255 --> 01:06:07,592
The public has a feeling that
when they tell us

1425
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:09,552
that they want us to increase
transparency

1426
01:06:09,594 --> 01:06:11,638
that we understand it from what
they're saying.

1427
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,807
But what we understand it
for what they're meaning,

1428
01:06:13,848 --> 01:06:16,434
and what they mean is that,
they don't actually trust us.

1429
01:06:16,476 --> 01:06:18,978
They want to see that what we're
doing matches

1430
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:20,522
what we're saying.

1431
01:06:20,563 --> 01:06:23,274
So body cameras uh, and the
proliferation of body cameras

1432
01:06:23,316 --> 01:06:25,777
throughout law enforcements has
been extreme.

1433
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:27,487
And I think
it's a good thing.

1434
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:30,949
We want to show the public that
we're not only

1435
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:32,450
have integrity with our report
writing

1436
01:06:32,492 --> 01:06:34,953
and our actions, but we want to
be able to prove that.

1437
01:06:34,994 --> 01:06:36,496
But not only to defend
ourselves,

1438
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:39,207
we wanna look-- take a look at
body cameras in a way

1439
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:41,084
that I don't think they've been
used--

1440
01:06:41,126 --> 01:06:43,086
utilized well enough and that is
as a performance

1441
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:44,295
management measure.

1442
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:45,964
We'd like to be able
to take a look at what

1443
01:06:46,006 --> 01:06:47,716
officers are doing
to determine

1444
01:06:47,757 --> 01:06:50,844
if their performance matches our
expectations.

1445
01:06:50,885 --> 01:06:52,053
If it does,
then that's great.

1446
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:53,513
We should commend them

1447
01:06:53,555 --> 01:06:54,681
We should let them know that
they're doing a great job.

1448
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:56,975
If it doesn't, what we don't
wanna do is

1449
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:58,560
just look for them doing
something bad.

1450
01:06:58,601 --> 01:07:00,311
We wanna ma-- we want to
obviously take a look at

1451
01:07:00,353 --> 01:07:04,149
some of those pre-incident
indicators to behavior

1452
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,985
to see if we can sort of stop
them along the way.

1453
01:07:07,027 --> 01:07:08,236
Send them in a right direction.

1454
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:10,155
Send them--
Give them better guidance.

1455
01:07:10,196 --> 01:07:12,157
And more importantly,
sit the officer down

1456
01:07:12,198 --> 01:07:14,451
and have them look
at their performance.

1457
01:07:14,492 --> 01:07:16,536
It's amazing what will happen
when you tell a person that,

1458
01:07:16,578 --> 01:07:18,997
“Listen, I don't-- I don't think
you did the right way.”

1459
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:20,373
For a law enforcement
officers,

1460
01:07:20,415 --> 01:07:22,792
because we are so used to people
combating us

1461
01:07:22,834 --> 01:07:26,171
our initial reaction is going to
be, "I didn't do that,

1462
01:07:26,212 --> 01:07:27,672
I did it right."

1463
01:07:27,714 --> 01:07:31,259
The ability to see yourself in
action, to see that

1464
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:32,802
maybe you took a left turn
when you should've taken--

1465
01:07:32,844 --> 01:07:34,012
taken a right turn.

1466
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:36,681
And it allows you to--
to understand that

1467
01:07:36,723 --> 01:07:38,767
we're not out here trying
to hurt you that

1468
01:07:38,808 --> 01:07:42,020
the executives within the agency
and the supervisors

1469
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:44,230
are there to improve
performance,

1470
01:07:44,272 --> 01:07:46,066
ultimately hoping
to improve service delivery

1471
01:07:46,107 --> 01:07:47,192
to the public.

1472
01:07:47,233 --> 01:07:49,444
ROY:
Body cameras are not
a panacea.

1473
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:51,529
I mean, the panacea would be to
stop the abuse

1474
01:07:51,571 --> 01:07:53,073
in the first place.

1475
01:07:53,114 --> 01:07:55,033
Uh, and the problem with body
cameras is that

1476
01:07:55,075 --> 01:07:57,077
there are no generalized rules.

1477
01:07:57,118 --> 01:07:58,787
That every department
does it their own way.

1478
01:07:58,828 --> 01:08:02,040
If we look at the
Laquan McDonald's shooting,

1479
01:08:02,082 --> 01:08:04,918
In Laquan McDonald,
we saw,

1480
01:08:04,959 --> 01:08:07,921
eventually that the officer was
lying.

1481
01:08:07,962 --> 01:08:09,506
But that went on
for a year or so.

1482
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:12,717
So sometimes they just--
they know what's on there,

1483
01:08:12,759 --> 01:08:15,720
they know it's bad and they
refuse to release it.

1484
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:17,639
You know, I'm not gonna give
them the excuse to--

1485
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:20,183
There's too much video
to look at.

1486
01:08:20,225 --> 01:08:21,434
They don't have time
to look at it,

1487
01:08:21,476 --> 01:08:23,895
they don't have the resources to
look at it.

1488
01:08:23,937 --> 01:08:26,815
We give our law enforcement
agencies

1489
01:08:26,856 --> 01:08:29,484
an enormous amount of money.

1490
01:08:29,526 --> 01:08:31,903
It's how they decide
to use it.

1491
01:08:31,945 --> 01:08:35,156
You know, they prefer
to use it to buy new toys,

1492
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:39,244
then it is to investigate
allegations of misconduct.

1493
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:41,663
CHUCK D: (Narrating)
As the world reckons
with what policing

1494
01:08:41,705 --> 01:08:42,997
looks like today,

1495
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:46,251
reimagining 21st century
policing has been the call

1496
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:47,961
to action by citizens,

1497
01:08:48,003 --> 01:08:50,380
politicians, and law enforcement
leaders.

1498
01:08:50,422 --> 01:08:52,507
There should be a social
contract between

1499
01:08:52,549 --> 01:08:55,301
the community and the people um,
who are served by

1500
01:08:55,343 --> 01:08:58,346
the law enforcement
and law enforcement to ensure

1501
01:08:58,388 --> 01:08:59,806
that there was a meeting
of the minds.

1502
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:02,434
And what are the tools that
you're using,

1503
01:09:02,475 --> 01:09:04,102
so for example, when President
Obama

1504
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:06,688
was in office,
we stopped the practice

1505
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:09,649
of giving military style
equipment to local

1506
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:11,276
law enforcement.

1507
01:09:11,317 --> 01:09:14,237
Believing that that only
escalates the situation.

1508
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:16,740
And one of the other
recommendations

1509
01:09:16,781 --> 01:09:18,950
in the report was to encourage
law enforcement

1510
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:20,827
to get out of their car.

1511
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:22,787
Well, first of all,
the higher local enforcement

1512
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:24,080
from the community.

1513
01:09:24,122 --> 01:09:26,332
So they know who are the leaders
in the community.

1514
01:09:26,374 --> 01:09:28,626
And that encouraged them
to get outside of their cars,

1515
01:09:28,668 --> 01:09:31,463
walks the street,
go into the schools,

1516
01:09:31,504 --> 01:09:35,091
let people see them when there
isn't a crisis,

1517
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:37,135
so that they build relationships

1518
01:09:37,177 --> 01:09:39,804
And that is the foundation
of bond of trust.

1519
01:09:39,846 --> 01:09:41,973
You can't get people
to co-operate with you

1520
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,099
if there are crimes
in a community.

1521
01:09:43,141 --> 01:09:44,267
If they don't think the people
are gonna

1522
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:45,685
be treated fairly.

1523
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:47,687
And so it actually impedes law
enforcement's ability

1524
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:49,314
to do their job.

1525
01:09:49,356 --> 01:09:51,775
GLENN:
Community policing
is a great concept,

1526
01:09:51,816 --> 01:09:55,070
because when the officers know
the communities

1527
01:09:55,111 --> 01:09:57,322
that they are expected
to police.

1528
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:59,699
And when they are interacting
with the folks every day,

1529
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:01,534
not just when something
goes wrong,

1530
01:10:01,576 --> 01:10:03,244
but when everything
is going right,

1531
01:10:03,286 --> 01:10:04,537
when things are
calm and quiet.

1532
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,667
That's going to build important
relationships.

1533
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:11,920
I had a interesting conversation
with um,

1534
01:10:11,961 --> 01:10:14,130
someone that I would consider
to be a friend,

1535
01:10:14,172 --> 01:10:15,173
and he said to me that

1536
01:10:15,215 --> 01:10:16,883
when we were
in Seminary School.

1537
01:10:16,925 --> 01:10:19,844
He was intimidated by me because

1538
01:10:19,886 --> 01:10:22,430
I destroyed his narrative

1539
01:10:22,472 --> 01:10:24,891
of what an African-American male
is.

1540
01:10:26,768 --> 01:10:29,229
He grew up in South Carolina,
just like me.

1541
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:32,023
And he had a certain vision, a
certain image

1542
01:10:32,065 --> 01:10:35,902
of what a black man was.

1543
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:37,696
I upset all of that.

1544
01:10:37,737 --> 01:10:39,489
And then he began to say,
“You know, I would love

1545
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:41,241
to invite you to
my congregation

1546
01:10:41,282 --> 01:10:43,618
and I would, you know,
so if Lord praises on you

1547
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:46,037
before you know,
coming out of Hartsville,

1548
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:47,539
South Carolina.

1549
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:48,957
And I said, “Hold on, sir.”

1550
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:50,875
I said, “Don't do that.

1551
01:10:50,917 --> 01:10:54,337
Because if you look at me
as an anomaly,

1552
01:10:54,379 --> 01:10:56,589
because of my education and what
I've been able to do.

1553
01:10:56,631 --> 01:10:59,759
What you're doing is now
creating a cycle

1554
01:10:59,801 --> 01:11:01,678
where you see me differently
from any other

1555
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,139
African-American man,
and that's the problem.

1556
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:07,559
What you need to do
is see my humanity,

1557
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,894
just like you see
anyone else's humanity.”

1558
01:11:11,271 --> 01:11:13,815
CHUCK D: (Narrating)
More and more,
citizens are coming up

1559
01:11:13,857 --> 01:11:17,193
with tech solutions,
products and services

1560
01:11:17,235 --> 01:11:19,279
that are helping address
the issue.

1561
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,989
There are those already
at the forefront

1562
01:11:21,031 --> 01:11:22,073
of this effort,

1563
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:24,284
trying to make
communities safer.

1564
01:11:24,909 --> 01:11:27,454
JACKIE:
Not Reaching is a vehicle
identification pouch,

1565
01:11:27,495 --> 01:11:30,415
it holds your license,
registration, and insurance.

1566
01:11:30,457 --> 01:11:32,834
It clips to your
driver-side air vent,

1567
01:11:32,876 --> 01:11:34,794
so when an officer comes to your
car during

1568
01:11:34,836 --> 01:11:37,130
a traffic stop,
you do not have to reach.

1569
01:11:37,172 --> 01:11:39,758
Officers have said that this is
what makes them nervous

1570
01:11:39,799 --> 01:11:42,177
and escalates
their traffic stops.

1571
01:11:42,218 --> 01:11:45,430
So, on July 6th of 2016,

1572
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:46,681
I'm at-- we're at home
celebrating

1573
01:11:46,723 --> 01:11:50,018
our son's 38th birthday
and Valerie Castile

1574
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:51,519
is in Minnesota,
losing her son

1575
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:53,396
to a routine traffic stop.

1576
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:55,690
And that was the day,
I said, “That's it.

1577
01:11:55,732 --> 01:11:57,400
We have to come up
with a solution.

1578
01:11:57,442 --> 01:11:59,527
There has to be something
out there.”

1579
01:11:59,569 --> 01:12:01,613
So after interviewing police
officers,

1580
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:02,781
they all said the same thing.

1581
01:12:02,822 --> 01:12:04,407
What is it that makes you
nervous during

1582
01:12:04,449 --> 01:12:05,825
a traffic stop?

1583
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:08,286
They all said, reaching.

1584
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:09,913
And that's how we came up with
Not Reaching,

1585
01:12:09,954 --> 01:12:12,999
not knowing two years later,
I would find out

1586
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:16,461
that Philando's last words
before he died were,

1587
01:12:16,503 --> 01:12:18,630
“I wasn't reaching.”

1588
01:12:20,924 --> 01:12:25,970
Our policing system, sir,

1589
01:12:26,012 --> 01:12:27,013
are out of control.

1590
01:12:28,765 --> 01:12:34,270
They are not regulated,
there is not the appropriate

1591
01:12:34,312 --> 01:12:35,814
accountability measures.

1592
01:12:35,855 --> 01:12:38,483
If every time an officer
interacts with

1593
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:41,569
a community member,
there is a risk that

1594
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:43,738
that community member
could end up dead.

1595
01:12:44,656 --> 01:12:46,908
And there's never accountability

1596
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:48,493
for that officer.

1597
01:12:48,535 --> 01:12:50,912
You are never going to be able
to have the kind of

1598
01:12:50,954 --> 01:12:52,330
safety that you
are talking about.

1599
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:57,168
We have a filing crime rate of
approximately

1600
01:12:57,210 --> 01:13:02,507
300 to 400 people every year,
across administrations.

1601
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:05,010
And that's what it's looked like
for years, and years,

1602
01:13:05,051 --> 01:13:06,344
and years.

1603
01:13:06,386 --> 01:13:09,180
Dumping money into criminal
justice.

1604
01:13:09,222 --> 01:13:11,683
What if we move that money into
building people up

1605
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:14,352
instead of tearing people down?

1606
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:16,646
Because the current system
just isn't working

1607
01:13:17,647 --> 01:13:19,274
We don't have the greatest
criminal justice

1608
01:13:19,315 --> 01:13:20,692
in the world.

1609
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:23,695
We shouldn't be locking up more
people than

1610
01:13:23,737 --> 01:13:26,740
pretty much every single country
in the world.

1611
01:13:27,741 --> 01:13:30,035
We shouldn't be destroying black
lives

1612
01:13:30,076 --> 01:13:32,412
and black communities,
and the Latino lives

1613
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:34,080
and Latino communities.

1614
01:13:35,874 --> 01:13:37,876
So what do we have to lose
by actually doing

1615
01:13:37,917 --> 01:13:39,711
something different

1616
01:13:39,753 --> 01:13:42,797
That actually makes common
sense.

1617
01:13:42,839 --> 01:13:45,925
The American people can't have
confidence

1618
01:13:45,967 --> 01:13:48,803
in the police force,
when you have

1619
01:13:48,845 --> 01:13:51,598
the Eric Garners,
and the Philando Castiles,

1620
01:13:51,639 --> 01:13:54,059
and the George Floyds,

1621
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,518
and--
you could name,

1622
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,603
how many names?

1623
01:13:56,644 --> 01:13:59,898
Dozens, hundreds, thousands of
names.

1624
01:13:59,939 --> 01:14:03,526
So, when I see congress taking
up things like

1625
01:14:03,568 --> 01:14:06,613
banning choke holds,
well, that's wonderful.

1626
01:14:06,654 --> 01:14:07,655
But that's like putting
a Band-Aid

1627
01:14:07,697 --> 01:14:10,116
on a gaping chest wound.

1628
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:13,119
What I think needs to be done,
based on what I saw

1629
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:15,580
in my 30 years
as a prosecutor,

1630
01:14:15,622 --> 01:14:20,919
is the kind of intense, systemic
reform

1631
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:26,091
that partners the police
with those being policed.

1632
01:14:26,132 --> 01:14:30,804
The Gen-Z'ers and gen uh-- and
the millennials

1633
01:14:30,845 --> 01:14:35,266
have a certain respect
for humanity.

1634
01:14:35,308 --> 01:14:37,894
That I think may be a little
different

1635
01:14:37,936 --> 01:14:40,063
from, you know,
prior generations.

1636
01:14:41,314 --> 01:14:44,609
Given George Floyd's case,

1637
01:14:44,651 --> 01:14:49,155
people saw him as a human being
for the first time.

1638
01:14:50,365 --> 01:14:53,785
It's sad that he has
to be recognized

1639
01:14:53,827 --> 01:14:57,789
as a human being, when he
is in a helpless state,

1640
01:14:57,831 --> 01:15:00,959
because he should be respected
as one

1641
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:03,920
as he was walking
and all of this

1642
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:07,757
over a supposed counterfeit
$20 bill.

1643
01:15:09,843 --> 01:15:12,554
Imagine a room filled
with 13 to 17 year old

1644
01:15:12,595 --> 01:15:15,306
students of color, brainstorming

1645
01:15:15,348 --> 01:15:19,269
how they can use technology to
make a positive impact

1646
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:20,645
to their community.

1647
01:15:20,687 --> 01:15:24,441
My first introduction into the
world of technology

1648
01:15:24,482 --> 01:15:26,484
was a Kino Live Tech Phone.

1649
01:15:26,526 --> 01:15:29,154
But there was a question,
that was posed at me

1650
01:15:29,195 --> 01:15:30,655
at that event.

1651
01:15:30,697 --> 01:15:33,616
It was, “Could an app have saved
Trayvon Martin?”

1652
01:15:34,534 --> 01:15:38,663
Uh, I created Cop Stop in 2015.

1653
01:15:38,705 --> 01:15:40,623
It was born out of the idea that
we need to figure out

1654
01:15:40,665 --> 01:15:42,667
how to alleviate this
overwhelming sense

1655
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:45,337
of anxiety that black folks get
and other folks

1656
01:15:45,378 --> 01:15:46,713
of color get,
when you're talking

1657
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:51,009
to an officer after he or she
pulls you over.

1658
01:15:51,051 --> 01:15:53,094
It's ridiculous that you can
feel like you're frozen

1659
01:15:53,136 --> 01:15:56,181
you know, that these folks that
you're supposed to call

1660
01:15:56,222 --> 01:15:59,517
after anything happens.

1661
01:15:59,559 --> 01:16:00,935
Uh, that you-- you feel like,

1662
01:16:00,977 --> 01:16:02,312
they're ready to kill you,
you know.

1663
01:16:03,813 --> 01:16:06,274
So, I had to figure out
some like--

1664
01:16:06,316 --> 01:16:07,525
some step in the right direction

1665
01:16:07,567 --> 01:16:09,235
to create a solution for it.

1666
01:16:09,277 --> 01:16:12,822
Um, I was invited by
the chief of police to give

1667
01:16:12,864 --> 01:16:14,532
a presentation on Cop Stop.

1668
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:16,284
Uh, my experience
with officers,

1669
01:16:16,326 --> 01:16:19,537
why I felt there was a need
for the application,

1670
01:16:19,579 --> 01:16:21,247
and how the officers can use it
to regulate

1671
01:16:21,289 --> 01:16:24,209
their own behaviors and keep
themselves accountable.

1672
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:26,086
At the same time,
it was how community members

1673
01:16:26,127 --> 01:16:28,213
are gonna use it for their own
safety.

1674
01:16:28,254 --> 01:16:30,382
And I can definitely share
I was nervous.

1675
01:16:30,423 --> 01:16:32,342
Like I was scared, ‘cause
it was my first time speaking

1676
01:16:32,384 --> 01:16:34,386
to a group of officers um,

1677
01:16:34,427 --> 01:16:36,596
about an app called
“Cop Stop”

1678
01:16:36,638 --> 01:16:38,598
and I'm black.

1679
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,684
That opportunity was really,
really eye-opening,

1680
01:16:40,725 --> 01:16:41,935
because that happened--

1681
01:16:41,976 --> 01:16:44,020
that happened
when I was 15 years old.

1682
01:16:45,271 --> 01:16:50,026
From all of the workshops and
projects that I've done,

1683
01:16:50,068 --> 01:16:53,571
they all stem from the same idea
of defining

1684
01:16:53,613 --> 01:16:55,156
your own reality.

1685
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:58,743
I practiced that through
technology creation.

1686
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:02,205
We can use technology
as a platform to build

1687
01:17:02,247 --> 01:17:05,417
an educational system
without the influence

1688
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:07,460
of white supremacy.

1689
01:17:07,502 --> 01:17:10,630
[Applause]

1690
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:20,265
I know its uncomfortable,
but if you've been waiting

1691
01:17:20,306 --> 01:17:21,683
for someone to tell you,

1692
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:24,269
it's time to keep questioning,

1693
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:25,687
let it be me.

1694
01:17:26,646 --> 01:17:30,108
Curiosity doesn't always
lead to death.

1695
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:33,611
In truth, it can be the
strongest catalyst

1696
01:17:33,653 --> 01:17:35,113
for change.

1697
01:17:35,155 --> 01:17:36,114
Thank you.

1698
01:17:36,156 --> 01:17:37,365
[Audience cheering
& applauding]

1699
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:40,368
We've pleaded, we've prayed,
we've worshipped,

1700
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,412
we've begged,
we've marched,

1701
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:49,627
And it can't-- It does not
appear to resonate, right.

1702
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:55,091
With-- with large numbers
of white Americans

1703
01:17:55,133 --> 01:17:58,595
that race relations
is their problem to solve

1704
01:17:59,346 --> 01:18:01,806
I think, that people need
to take a deep breath

1705
01:18:01,848 --> 01:18:04,642
and they need to start having
conversations like this

1706
01:18:04,684 --> 01:18:07,645
to really understand
everybody's viewpoint.

1707
01:18:07,687 --> 01:18:09,481
In the future,
I hope I don't have to see

1708
01:18:09,522 --> 01:18:14,194
video after video of police
disrespecting, dehumanizing

1709
01:18:14,235 --> 01:18:18,031
and hurting, killing,
and injuring folk on the

1710
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:20,658
It's gonna take mayors
and police chiefs

1711
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,161
who are committed
to recognizing that

1712
01:18:23,203 --> 01:18:24,412
there is a problem.

1713
01:18:24,454 --> 01:18:26,331
Not-- not trying to pretend
it doesn't exist.

1714
01:18:26,373 --> 01:18:27,415
It does exist!

1715
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:30,251
It is a real emphasis
on the getting

1716
01:18:30,293 --> 01:18:32,754
our white counterparts to at the
very least

1717
01:18:32,796 --> 01:18:34,881
understand that these things are
real for us.

1718
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:38,009
It's time now uh,
that we really need to the--

1719
01:18:38,051 --> 01:18:40,887
to listen to the voices

1720
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:44,349
of those who have the worst
assumptions about

1721
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:45,558
the justice system,

1722
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,185
the worst assumptions
about policing.

1723
01:18:47,227 --> 01:18:49,854
America to have justice
for all.

1724
01:18:49,896 --> 01:18:51,439
Don't think of a person's color,

1725
01:18:51,481 --> 01:18:52,857
think of them being a human.

1726
01:18:52,899 --> 01:18:54,984
They'll treat a dog better

1727
01:18:55,026 --> 01:18:56,736
than they'll treat
a human being.

1728
01:18:59,823 --> 01:19:01,366
Members of jury, I will now
read the verdicts

1729
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:02,784
as they will appear
on the permanent records

1730
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:04,911
of the fourth judicial district.

1731
01:19:04,953 --> 01:19:06,705
We, the jury, in the above
entitled manner

1732
01:19:06,746 --> 01:19:07,956
as to count one,

1733
01:19:07,997 --> 01:19:09,499
unintentional
second degree murder

1734
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:10,875
while committing a felony,

1735
01:19:10,917 --> 01:19:12,335
find the defendant guilty.

1736
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:15,255

01:19:52,459 --> 01:19:56,629
* <i>And just stand up</i>

1753
01:20:19,944 --> 01:20:21,863
* <i>When you witness</i>

1754
01:20:21,905 --> 01:20:23,698
