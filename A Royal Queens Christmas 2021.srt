5
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,133
- How 'bout some
black-and-whites,
Mrs. Rodriguez?

6
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:08,166
Zoe just baked them.

7
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,200
- Yes, please.
- Hey, Mrs. R!

8
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,266
- Hey, Zo.
And a dozen macaroons.

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,834
- Comin' right up.

10
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:16,800
- How's my granddaughter
doing at choir practice?

11
00:01:16,934 --> 00:01:18,934
- Oh. With a voice like that?

12
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:21,000
Ava is gonna be the star

13
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:23,300
of The Little Queens
Carolers fundraiser.

14
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,900
- Oh, Dee Dee,
you're so good with those kids.

15
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:28,200
My daughter tells me
Ava comes home

16
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,066
after every practice raving.

17
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:35,633
- Thanks, Mrs. R.

18
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:36,800
- How's your Nonna's new hip?

19
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:37,900
- Titanium.

20
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:40,000
She power-walks
two miles a day now.

21
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,734
- You're an angel, Dee Dee.

22
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:46,100
You know, my son
is single again.

23
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:48,200
- Oh. Tempting. Um...

24
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:51,467
But I've got my hands full
between the Christmas pageant

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,367
and helping Ma,
and helping Zo,

26
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,600
and the dogs ...

27
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:56,800
- I'll tell him to stop by.

28
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:58,667
Bye-bye!

29
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,066
- Great.

30
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,200
- You know,
the son's single again.

31
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,000
- No way!

32
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:10,834
- Hey! I made those!
Get outta here!

33
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:13,000
- Stop it!

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,467
- Take over, Freddy.
Duty calls.

35
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,266
Oh! Can't forget my lucky charm!

36
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,400
Sorry for running late, Whitbey.

37
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,433
You know I get lost
in the moment.

38
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:26,934
Do you at least like my playing?

39
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:29,533
- It was excellent, Sire.
- Great.

40
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,133
Rock and roll, sir.
- I will.

41
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:42,433
- I love my job. I love my job.

42
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:47,700
- Hello. Thank you.

43
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:50,633
Good to see you. My pleasure.
Good to see you.

44
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,533
Oh, Mother.

45
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,233
You look absolutely beautiful.

46
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,667
And Father, positively regal.

47
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,567
- And you look slightly flushed.
- And barely on time.

48
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,000
- But I am on time.

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,266
- Members of the Privy Council,

50
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,834
we welcome you and your families
for our yearly

51
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,166
holiday gathering.
- Thank you.

52
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,867
- Prince Colin,
if you will do the honor.

53
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,333
Lovely, lovely.

54
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:24,400
- And how was the last-minute
Christmas shopping?

55
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,200
- Oh, it went quite well.

56
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,233
- Clearly.

57
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:31,934
- Well, it's quite hard
to hide from the paparazzi

58
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:33,333
in a place this small.

59
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:36,000
- There are considerably
more paparazzi in New York.

60
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:38,667
- You will have to do better
when you're there.

61
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:40,567
- New York?

62
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,033
- Thank you.

63
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,066
As you know,
Queen Alexandra and I

64
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,333
are honorary chairs

65
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:51,000
of the International
Children of the World

66
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,467
Charity Christmas Ball,

67
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,400
a cause dear to our hearts.

68
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,367
Which makes us so pleased
to announce

69
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,967
that Prince Colin
will journey to New York

70
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,467
in advance of our arrival

71
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,667
to introduce himself
to the international community

72
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,367
as a future head of state.

73
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:21,667
- Hi, General.
How's your day going?

74
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,900
Oh, seems like
it's going pretty well.

75
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,300
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, Ma.

76
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:27,100
- So, your father's out on a job

77
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:28,467
and Nonna Sophie's at...

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,033
Canasta.
- Of course.

79
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,467
I brought you some antipasto.
- Thanks.

80
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,800
- If that's not enough, I can
scrape up some cioppino for you.

81
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,567
- No, Ma, this is fine.
- Are you sure?

82
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,066
- Thank you. Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

83
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,233
You know, your cousin Zoe?
She's awfully good at baking.

84
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,867
I mean, if you were interested,
she could probably show you

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,133
some things around the bakery.
I'm sure if you asked--

86
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:46,900
- I see your wheels turning.
- What did I say?

87
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:48,567
- I know what you're thinking.
- What?

88
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,033
- "When is my darling daughter
going to figure out

89
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,133
her path in life?"

90
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:53,400
- Oh, please!

91
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:55,700
I never said such a thing!
Come on.

92
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:58,400
- Trust me. I think about it
enough for both of us.

93
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:01,600
- Okay. Listen,
my darling daughter.

94
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:04,266
You just came back
from spending a lot of years

95
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
in service to your country.

96
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:09,467
You take all the time you need
to figure out what you wanna do.

97
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,433
And when you do, us Parettis
got your back. Capischi ?

98
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,100
- Capischi.
- Yeah.

99
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:16,867
- Love you, Ma.
- Eat your food.

100
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,900
- Hey, Dee!
Can you answer that, please?

101
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,300
- Yeah.

102
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:35,734
Hello, Rossi's Bakery.

103
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:37,266
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Eddie.

104
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,033
Zo, it's your fiancé.
- Hey, baby!

105
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,300
- Uh, actually, I'm calling
to talk to the both of you.

106
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:45,367
Uh, two of our bakers
got poached by another hotel

107
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,233
and I kinda need your help.

108
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:49,533
Uh, people from all over
the world are here

109
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,700
for this international
children's charity thing,

110
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:54,734
and, uh, I told Chef Pierre
that my fiancé

111
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:56,166
is the best baker in the world.

112
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,400
- Aw, babe!
- I mean, it's true.

113
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:01,600
And you've been saying
you wanted to grow your business

114
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:04,400
and maybe open up another
location after we tie the knot.

115
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,567
- Yeah, when's that happening,
by the way?

116
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,066
- What do you need from me,
Eddie?

117
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,467
- Uh, your fanciest delights

118
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,066
and whatever you can
throw together fast. All right?

119
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,567
Pastry approval's today.

120
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,633
Goodbye.

121
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,600
Zo! This is... This is huge!

122
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:24,033
- What day is today?
Tuesday? It's Tuesday.

123
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,867
I gotta get the Martinez
wedding cake done by 5:00.

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,033
- You can do it!
- No. No, I-I-I can't.

125
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,166
This hotel is, like,
super fancy.

126
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,800
- No, you can do this.
You can do this.

127
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:36,967
You are the granddaughter
of two legendary bakers, okay?

128
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,700
They're gonna love
whatever you do.

129
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,967
And then the Rossis
are gonna have locations

130
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,533
in all five boroughs,

131
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,767
and you and Eddie
are gonna get married

132
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,500
whenever you actually
set a date.

133
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,967
When is that happening again?

134
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,000
- One crisis at a time, Dee.

135
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:51,000
- All right, um,
here's what we're gonna do.

136
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,867
I'm gonna handle prep,
you're gonna bake

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,166
like you do every day,

138
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,500
and then I, your cousin
and very best friend,

139
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:58,066
am going to hand-deliver
the pastries

140
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,033
to fancy Manhattan,
to hotel hoity-toity,

141
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,100
and you're gonna finish that
over-the-top wedding cake.

142
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,533
- Dee!
- You know it's true.

143
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,266
It's gonna be great!

144
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:11,800
- Yeah, what could go wrong?

145
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,667
- Lovely, isn't it?

146
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,333
There is no better way
to experience New York

147
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,633
for the first time
than at Christmas.

148
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:34,133
- I couldn't agree more.

149
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:36,000
- Now, Sire,

150
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,767
remember you're here
on business.

151
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,367
We don't want another
paparazzi incident,

152
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,867
especially on a first day.

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,467
- You never let me have any fun.

154
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,767
- Yeah. And yet you find it
nonetheless.

155
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,033
- Oh, I will.

156
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:52,967
- Oh, oh my goodness!
- Oh, my God! No, no, no, no!

157
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,033
No, please! Tell me
that did not just happen.

158
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,066
- That did not just happen.

159
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,000
Though, of course, it did. Um...

160
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:05,633
Facing reality just
isn't one of my strong suits.

161
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:08,233
Whatever this is...

162
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:09,800
Was. Whatever this was,

163
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:12,633
um, let me replace it?

164
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:14,700
H-how much do I owe you?

165
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,867
- Nothing.
You can't replace this,

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,633
and you can't just buy
your way out of it

167
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,934
because of your accent.

168
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:22,533
- Well, you have
an accent yourself.

169
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,000
I can remind you of that.

170
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:25,567
- Do you have a problem
with my accent?

171
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,133
- No, I think your accent's
rather lovely.

172
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,633
Um, my sincere apologies.

173
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:32,300
Please, let me know
if there's anything I can

174
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:34,867
do to remedy
this unfortunate accident.

175
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,667
- Do you have a time machine?
- I wish but unfortunately not.

176
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,600
- Time! Ah! Zoe's gonna kill me!

177
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:46,767
Some guy in the lobby decided
he was playing running back

178
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,133
for the Jets and wham!

179
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:50,467
- Have you looked inside?

180
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,533
- No, I'm afraid to.

181
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:57,600
- Ed, you do it.

182
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,800
- Oh...

183
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:09,934
I-It's not that bad.

184
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:11,834
- You're lying.
- I am. I'm lying. I'm lying.

185
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:14,066
But, hey, look, we could try it.
Right, Chef?

186
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,100
- Okay.

187
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:18,233
- Try...

188
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,200
- Oh la, la, Eddie!

189
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,400
- Huh? Didn't I tell you?
Zo's the best.

190
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:30,900
- Can you guarantee me
1,500 assorted pastries

191
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,900
of this quality on Saturday

192
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,934
for the International Children's
Charity Ball?

193
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:37,100
But not smooshed up.

194
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:39,834
- I mean, yeah,
but with an order that large,

195
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:42,000
you'd have to pay a rush fee.
- Of course.

196
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:43,967
- And you have to promote
that the pastries

197
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,700
are from Rossi's at the event.
- Done.

198
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:48,533
- And, you know, we could use
a glowing recommendation

199
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,166
for our website.

200
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,200
- Fine. Anything else?

201
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,166
- No, you got a deal!

202
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,367
- All right.
- Nice.

203
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,967
Oh, gosh...

204
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,066
- One more for the coffee.

205
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:13,800
- Oh, thank you.

206
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,800
- Very nice, sir.
Now may we move on

207
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:19,467
to some less visible activities?

208
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,433
- Oh, Whitbey. Come on.
You can let me enjoy

209
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:22,734
some of my time
here in New York.

210
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:24,834
- Your parents have
expressed a desire

211
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:28,333
for you to move on
from rock bands and race cars,

212
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,867
and prepare yourself
for when you rule.

213
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,700
- Whitbey, that's years away.

214
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:34,300
- Not necessarily.

215
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,400
- What are you saying?

216
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:39,400
- I believe the discussion
of your...

217
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,867
succession might be coming soon.

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,266
- How soon?

219
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,300
- I'd enjoy these days in this
glorious city if I were you.

220
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:48,000
- Is my father in good health?

221
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:50,200
- Yes. But the Queen has told me

222
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,667
they hope to pass
the crown to you

223
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,300
while they're still
young enough to be able

224
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:55,867
to spend time together
without the demands of state.

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,600
- Well, that's a relief.

226
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,367
But unless Parliament
has changed the law,

227
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,033
I have to be married
to assume the crown.

228
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,900
- Another reason I thought
you'd appreciate

229
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:04,367
some more time to prepare.

230
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,800
- Oh, heavens.

231
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,266
You're going to tell me next
that they've chosen

232
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,900
a wife for me as well?
- Not exactly chosen.

233
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,500
More of a strong suggestion.

234
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:14,567
- I was joking!
- I was not.

235
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:16,900
- W-Well, do I know her,

236
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:18,834
or will I simply meet her
on my wedding day?

237
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:22,000
- Duchess Adriana.
- Adriana? Why?

238
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:23,700
- They saw you together
at last year's

239
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:25,600
Exeter Quadricentennial
celebration.

240
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:27,900
You seemed to be enjoying
each other's company.

241
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:29,000
- Of course we were.

242
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:31,533
We've known each other
since we were children.

243
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,533
I love her like a sister.
There's never been any spark.

244
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,000
- Well, sir, it is Christmas.

245
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,800
Perhaps there'll be one
in your stocking.

246
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,967
Glad to see you haven't
lost your sense of humor.

247
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,233
And on that note, I am off
to prepare your suite.

248
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:08,100
- Zoe, you got the job!

249
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:09,367
And some amazing advertising.

250
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,967
I'll tell you everything
when I get home!

251
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,433
Oh. Pop's calling. I gotta go.

252
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:15,133
- Okay, bye.
- 'Kay, bye.

253
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:16,867
Hey, Pops!
- Hey, baby girl.

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,300
I hate to bear bad news
but I got a broken-down bus

255
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,500
I gotta tow in. It looks like
I ain't gonna make

256
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:22,567
choir rehearsal.

257
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,000
- But the concert's
in three days!

258
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:25,734
I mean, where am I gonna find
a piano player

259
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:27,333
at such short notice?

260
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:29,333
- Okay, I wish I could
do something, but right now,

261
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:31,333
I'm as stuck as this bus is.

262
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:34,066
- You know what?
I got an idea, Pops!

263
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,033
- Yeah, I love--

264
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,867
I love you too.

265
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:42,934
- Hi. Excuse me, I know this
is gonna sound a little funny,

266
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:44,967
but what are you doing la...?

267
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:48,233
You?
- Uh...

268
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:50,767
Uh, yes, it's still me.

269
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,300
You were saying
what sounded like

270
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:53,633
the beginning of a question?

271
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,300
- Did you mean it earlier
when you said you'd do anything

272
00:13:57,433 --> 00:14:00,734
to repay me for crushing
all the pastries?

273
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:02,367
- Oh, I most certainly was.

274
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,600
Uh, at your service,
Miss, um...?

275
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:07,467
- Dee Dee.
- Dee Dee? Like the letters?

276
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,633
- Uh, like my name.
Daphne Dolores Paretti.

277
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,400
- Ah, Daphne. One of my favorite
writers is Daphne du Maurier.

278
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,200
- And you are?

279
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,867
- Colin.

280
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,500
St. Bernard.

281
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:25,100
From Exeter.
At your service, Miss Daphne.

282
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:26,567
So how much do I owe you?

283
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,266
- Oh, no, no.
This isn't a financial favor.

284
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:32,133
Follow me, Fancy Pants.

285
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:36,233
- May I ask where we're going?

286
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:37,734
How do I know
you're not a kidnapper?

287
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,367
- How do I know you're not one?

288
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,600
- Ah, touché, Miss Daphne.

289
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:41,900
- It's Dee Dee.

290
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:45,633
C'mon, Mr. St. Bernard.
We're goin' to Queens.

291
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:50,734
- Children.

292
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:52,700
- Is that gonna be a problem?

293
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:53,967
- Absolutely not!

294
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,500
I've sometimes been accused
of being a big

295
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:56,934
overgrown child myself.

296
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:58,633
- Good to know.

297
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,100
Sheet music's on the piano.

298
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,667
- May I ask how long
this repayment will last?

299
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,667
- As long as it takes.

300
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,000
All right, guys!
Let's get in our spots.

301
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,567
Let's start.

302
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,633
Mr. Colin is going to be here
today to cover for Mr. Mickey.

303
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:14,000
He could not be here, all right?

304
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,367
So, let's all say
thank you, Mr. Colin.

305
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,700
Thank you.
- You're very welcome!

306
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,433
- All right. You ready?

307
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:23,500
- Yeah.
- Okay.

308
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:25,133
All right.
Remember, straight posture

309
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:26,700
and a nice deep breath.

What?

318
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:05,567
- Uh, nothing.

319
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,400
It's just a bit dull.

320
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:12,934
- Dull?

321
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:15,367
These are like,
classic Christmas songs!

322
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,567
We've been singing these
since I was a kid.

323
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,100
This is the tradition.

324
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:21,200
- Yes, tradition.
I know tradition,

325
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,633
and in this instance,
tradition is dull.

326
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:29,166
- All right. What would you
have them sing, then?

327
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,533

331
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,600
- All right, that was great.

332
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,967
Everybody thank Mr. Colin for
gracing us with his presence.

333
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,834
Thank you!
- You guys. Have a good night.

334
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,533
Pack up your bags.
Leave your music books

335
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,133
on the table or the piano.
Thank you.

336
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:17,667
- He's so cool!

337
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
- Good night, Ava.

338
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:21,467
- Good night, Miss Dee.
Bye, Mr. Colin!

339
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,700
- Goodnight, Angel!

340
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,233
- Night, guys.
See you guys later.

341
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:30,133
All right.

342
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:32,200
That was pretty good.

343
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,600
I gotta say, you really added
something special

344
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:37,100
to the music tonight.
A little spark.

345
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,000
- A spark? Interesting.

346
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:42,734
- Come on. You gotta
get that reaction a lot.

347
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:45,066
- Ah, yes, but typically,

348
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,934
it's because they've had
a few pints.

349
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,333
- So, what? Do you just play
to bars and empty hotel lobbies?

350
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:52,433
- I play wherever I can
in a spare moment.

351
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:55,300
My parents aren't exactly
supportive of my life

352
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:56,767
in the performing arts.

353
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,266
- Oh, I'm sorry.

354
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,800
I'm kinda lucky that my parents

355
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:03,100
have had me up on those risers
since before I could walk.

356
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:05,200
- You were in this choir
as a child?

357
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,533
- Yeah, yeah. My dad was always
like, the guy on the piano.

358
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:09,900
They're big into music.

359
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:11,667
My folks actually started
this whole choir

360
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,033
because schools were cutting
use of school funding,

361
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,400
and... the city gives us
money for this,

362
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,166
but really,
the Christmas concert's like,

363
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,767
the big fundraiser.

364
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,633
- I'm sure it'll be
a lovely night.

365
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,333
- I hope so. Christmas is a big
deal around here.

366
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:26,734
We have, like, a whole
week of celebrations.

367
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:28,800
Everybody decorates
their houses,

368
00:18:28,934 --> 00:18:30,533
and then there's
a snowman-making competition,

369
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,367
and then there's a Secret Santa,
and then there's this, like,

370
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,834
massive block party
where we decorate a huge tree

371
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:37,100
and everybody hangs ornaments
and makes wishes.

372
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,500
- I've never heard
of that tradition.

373
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:41,233
Have you tried it?

374
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:45,233
- Yeah. Yeah, it didn't really
work out for me, so...

375
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:46,967
- I'm sorry.

376
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,066
I'm sure your bakery does well
during these festivities.

377
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,633
- Ah, no. It's not my bakery.
My cousin Zoe runs it.

378
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:54,367
I've just... been working there
since my last tour,

379
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,834
just kind of, like,

380
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:58,066
figuring out
what the next step is, so...

381
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,300
- I'm sorry. Tour?

382
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:03,000
- Of duty, but that's a story
for another day.

383
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:06,200
So, uh,
what brings you to town?

384
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,867
- Um, I'm here with my...

385
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,033
for a family business.

386
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,734
- Hey! What's this I hear
you found some guy

387
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:14,200
who plays piano
better than I can?

388
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,867
- What happened to you?
- Ah, just a little strain.

389
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's what you get when you
try to pick up a school bus

390
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:21,300
with one hand, I guess.
- Yeah, Dad, this is Colin.

391
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:23,567
Colin, this is my dad,
Mickey Paretti.

392
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,500
- Hey, you really saved
my bacon today.

393
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,100
- It was my--
- Thank you, my man.

394
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,667
- Uh, pleasure, truly.
- Okay, your mother's got

395
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,166
some chicken caprese
in the oven,

396
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,333
so let's go eat some dinner.
- Dad...

397
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:34,667
- What? You know your mother
always makes enough food

398
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,767
for the whole neighborhood.

399
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,834
- That's very kind.

400
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,533
- I'm sure you have other plans.
What?!

401
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:41,867
- Not a one.
- Hey!

402
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,033
My Angie's gonna love
your accent.

403
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,166
She may never let you leave.

404
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:54,500
Come on, now.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

405
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,533
- Queens?

406
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,166
What are you doing in Queens?

407
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:18,367
♪ They hang the lights
in Sicily ♪

408
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:22,667
♪ The manger scenes of Napoli ♪

409
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,967
♪ Remind us of
Jesus' birth... ♪

410
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:30,834
- Truly, it looked more
like an accordion

411
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:32,100
than a box of pastries!

412
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:36,300
- Oh. Colin,
you want some gravy?

413
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:38,100
- Gravy?
- Yeah, for your pasta.

414
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:40,333
- Italians call
pasta sauce "gravy."

415
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:41,467
- It is gravy!

416
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,900
- Well, the gravy
smells delicious.

417
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:46,166
- How was work, Ma?
Uh, Ma's a nurse over at--

418
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,333
- Head nurse.

419
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:49,500
- Head nurse over at
Meadows Nursing Home.

420
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:51,000
- Okay, relax, you two.

421
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,633
My job, so glamorous.

422
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,600
I mean, the highlight
of my day today

423
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:57,400
was when Mr. Bloom
wandered into the wrong room

424
00:20:57,533 --> 00:21:00,600
and wound up wearing
Mrs. Strasser's velour suit.

425
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:02,000
- No, no!
- Which is like three sizes

426
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,800
too small for him.

427
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:04,667
- Ma!

428
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,600
- I mean, okay, well, you asked!

429
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:07,700
Come on!

430
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,834
- How fun.

431
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:11,400
Your family is so different
than my own.

432
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:13,100
- Right, now that
sounds wonderful.

433
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:14,967
- You'd be surprised.

434
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,467
- Hey, so, uh,
so what's Christmas like in...?

435
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,333
- In Exeter?
- Exeter, yeah.

436
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:23,667
- The royal family is, um,
a bit old-fashioned,

437
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,200
but they put on
a fine holiday celebration.

438
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,533
A beautiful tree, wreaths,
banners, ribbons,

439
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,100
and if it doesn't snow enough,

440
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:31,333
they bring in machines
to create it.

441
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:33,266
- Wow.
- Wow. Must be nice.

442
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,900
- So, what is it
you do for a livin'?

443
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:36,834
- Ma!
- The young man can answer

444
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:38,834
if he wants!
You don't mind, do you?

445
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:40,633
- It's fine.
- There you go.

446
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,300
- Management. Family business.

447
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:43,667
- Huh.
- It's what brought me

448
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,700
to New York.

449
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:46,767
- You must do good
if you stay at The Grand.

450
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,200
- It's great that
you're on a path.

451
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,000
You know,
you gotta set direction.

452
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:51,600
I mean, my little Dee

453
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:52,967
could use something like that
these days.

454
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,600
- Mickey! Come on.
- Just saying.

455
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:57,834
- She just got outta the army!
That's not fair.

456
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:00,066
She was in the army.
- Nah. I mean, he's got a point.

457
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,967
It's fine. It's been,
what, six months now?

458
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,333
- You were in the army?

459
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:07,033
- She sure was. She followed
Mickey's footsteps here.

460
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,000
That's how we got the General.

461
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:09,934
- Yeah, I spent the last,
what, five years

462
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:11,133
in the K-9 unit.

463
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:13,367
He was by my side
every step of the way.

464
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,166
Got so attached, you know?

465
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,800
Couldn't leave him there.

466
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:20,133
- So, um, Mr. Mickey,
you served as well?

467
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,066
- Yeah, 20 years as a mechanic.

468
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,533
You know, on the big beasts.

469
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,900
Now I got a nice little
towing and plowing company.

470
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:28,166
I got three guys working for me.
It's nice.

471
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,967
- Oh, no, no, no!
You sit, sit. You're our guest.

472
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,133
- I'm gonna go to the Lees.

473
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:37,367
They're hosting
Mahjong tonight!

474
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,533
- Have fun!
- Say hi for us.

475
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:45,800
- You sit and relax your hands.

476
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:48,033
I'm gonna get
you ice for that. Okay?

477
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,600
- Okay.

478
00:22:50,266 --> 00:22:52,166
- How can I be of service?

479
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,567
- You can dry.

480
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,767
You look like
more of a dryer than a washer.

481
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,767
Here, you can use this cloth.

482
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,133
- So, use the cloth
to dry the wet dish.

483
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:07,033
- I'm guessing you grew up
with a dishwasher, am I right?

484
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,934
- Yes, of sorts.

485
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:12,533
- Ah, this life must seem
a million miles away

486
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:13,834
from what you're used to.

487
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:15,333
- And surprisingly comfortable.

488
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:17,700
- Give it a few days.

489
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:22,767
So, um, your family company.
What do you do there?

490
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:25,834
- Well, up till now,
to be honest,

491
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:27,633
as little as possible.

492
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:29,700
But it seems as if
I'm gonna be kicked upstairs

493
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:31,333
to an executive position.

494
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,100
- Congrats.
It's exciting, isn't it?

495
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:38,133
- Some of the requirements
pose a challenge.

496
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:40,100
- Anything you can't handle?

497
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:42,367
- No. I'm just not
too sure I want to.

498
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,433
- Oh.

499
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:46,667
Well, I guess there's
always gonna be things

500
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,900
you don't wanna do in life,
like dishes.

501
00:23:49,033 --> 00:23:50,500
But if it's bigger than that,

502
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:52,400
I guess you have
to ask yourself, you know,

503
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:54,734
is it worth the sacrifice?

504
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,767
You've only got one life.

505
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,600
It's important that you're
the one in charge of it.

506
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:03,433
- Sage advice, Miss Daphne.

507
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:07,667
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What are you gonna do?

508
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,734
Nah, nah. Just get home safe.
Don't worry about it.

509
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:10,700
Talk soon.

510
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:13,300
- Well, thank you
for a wonderful evening.

511
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:15,400
I'm afraid, though, that I must
I depart for my hotel.

512
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:17,133
- Oh, no, no.
That's not gonna happen.

513
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:18,767
Joey D says those roads
out there

514
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,734
ain't fit for nothing
but the Ice Capades tonight.

515
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:22,934
- Oh, well, then,
you're stayin' here.

516
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:24,467
- Spend the night?
- Mom, I'm sure Colin--

517
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,767
- It's all right. Dee Dee
will make up the couch for you.

518
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,900
- Ma!

519
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,800
- I couldn't possibly impose.

520
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:32,066
- Don't be silly.
You're not imposing.

521
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,367
- Hey, she's right.

522
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,633
That couch has seen more guests
than the Grand Park Hotel.

523
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,200
- It's true.

524
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,633
- Yeah.

525
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:42,367
- This is very generous,
Thank you.

526
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,000
I just need to make
one quick phone call. Excuse me.

527
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:49,233
- Ma. Really?

528
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:52,467
- What? Don't blame me
for the weather!

529
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,133
Anyway, let's get
the good linens.

530
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,667
- Now, Whitbey, don't be upset

531
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,033
but I shall be
sleeping here tonight.

532
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,533
- And where exactly is "here"?

533
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,400
- Don't pretend you're not
tracking my whereabouts

534
00:25:05,533 --> 00:25:07,433
on the app. Now, Whitbey,

535
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:09,166
don't worry. I'm utterly safe.

536
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,533
I'm told the sofa
sees plenty of guests.

537
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:14,734
- They're giving a prince
the sofa?

538
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:16,166
- Yes, that.

539
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,633
Look, Whitbey,

540
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,133
the Parettis have
no idea who I am,

541
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:22,667
and I'd very much like for it
to stay that way.

542
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,900
- Instinctively that feels
like a very poor decision.

543
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:28,800
However, I don't wish
to argue the point.

544
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:32,567
Tomorrow, though, we must
discuss your royal obligations.

545
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,767
- Yes, yes.
Tomorrow, absolutely.

546
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,600
Listen, one other thing,
Whitbey?

547
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:37,667
- Yes, sir?

548
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,667
- Did you know that I don't
have a surname?

549
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
I mean, Father
has the House of Dansey,

550
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:43,500
and Mother has
the House of Knowton,

551
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:44,567
but what do I have?

552
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,133
- You don't require
a surname, Sire.

553
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:52,166
You are Prince Colin Alfons
Marcus George of Exeter.

554
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,133
That is more than enough.

555
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:56,033
- Right, yes.

556
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:57,633
Of course.

557
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,033
I'm all yours.

558
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,266
- Hey, there he is.

559
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,467
- Oh, wow!
- Got cannolis!

560
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,233
- Look at these!
These are incredible.

561
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:06,633
- They're delicious!
- You're gonna love 'em.

562
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,166
- Have you ever had it?
- I haven't.

563
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,367
- You have to have one.
- She makes them like nobody.

564
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,900
- What do you think?
It's delicious.

565
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:14,033
- They're so good, right?
Here, have a napkin.

566
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:16,600
- Wonderful. Your cannoli
is absolutely incredible.

567
00:26:16,734 --> 00:26:19,800
- I know. It's a family recipe.
Have one. Just one.

568
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:22,834
- You can eat as many
as you want.

569
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:24,467
I just can't tell you
how they're made.

570
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,900
- I'm gonna eat all of 'em.

571
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:28,400
- See. I know he'd like 'em.

572
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,600
- What's not to like?
- I think you should have one.

573
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:44,967
- Hello?

574
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,300
- Good morning, Your Highness.

575
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:49,667
How was the sofa?

576
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,900
- Oh, it was, um...

577
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:55,233
My back is sore,
there's a crick in my neck,

578
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:57,166
and at one point I had
to share my pillow

579
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,400
with a Belgian Malinois.
- Ugh. Sounds five-star.

580
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:03,367
Now, your official commitments
start at noon.

581
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,066
And I suggest you make
your way back to the hotel--

582
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,066
- Yeah, I'll be back
in plenty of time, Whitbey.

583
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,700
Don't worry.
Listen, I've gotta go.

584
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,400
- Dare I trust him?

585
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:19,934
Oh, Whitbey, why start now?

586
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:35,266
- ...so your back
doesn't get sore.

587
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,500
- Use my knees? In what sense?

588
00:27:36,633 --> 00:27:37,800
- Bend 'em, bend 'em.

589
00:27:37,934 --> 00:27:39,300
Oh, hey!
- What's going on here?

590
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:41,734
- Oh, thank God you're here.
Thank you, Miss Daphne.

591
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:44,467
Your father here is teaching me
the tools of the trade

592
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,900
while his wrist heals.

593
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:48,200
What that trade is,
I haven't a clue.

594
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,934
- So, how's the wrist?

595
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:52,233
- Ah, Doc says it'll be
about a week.

596
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:54,667
What, uh, exactly is happening--

597
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,133
- You know it's the annual
snowman competition!

598
00:27:57,266 --> 00:28:00,066
Come on. So, every year
after the first big snowfall,

599
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,433
we get paired with a kid
on the block and we help them

600
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:03,633
make their snowman.

601
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,033
Zoe even gets someone to cover
her shift in the morning

602
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:08,900
so she can sleep in,
like it's a national holiday

603
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:10,200
or something.

604
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:11,567
- Sleep is important.

605
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:16,300
- Do you need to be back
to your hotel? For your job?

606
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:19,734
- My duties commence
at noon... ish.

607
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,533
- In that case, follow me,
Mr. St. Bernard.

608
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,900
- Am I allowed to know
where we're going this time?

609
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:27,000
- Nope.

610
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:29,734
- I got it. Thanks so much.
- Thank you.

611
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,166
- You look like you've never
done this before.

612
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,400
- The snow rolls differently
in Exeter.

613
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:50,700
- What do you think, Eli?

614
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:52,333
- Excuses!

615
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:53,667
- You tell him!

616
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,433
- You two are worse than
my headmaster at the academy.

617
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:04,734
- I am in need a car to Queens,
please. I'm in a bit of a rush.

618
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:07,133
- Of course, sir,
but with the conference,

619
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:10,200
I won't have a car or driver
ready for a few hours.

620
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,867
You could try the subway.

621
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:16,533
- Oh, you're serious.
- Very.

622
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,066
- Oh gosh.

623
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:23,066
Next stop, Queensborough Plaza.

624
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:33,133
It has to go
around the neck like this.

625
00:29:33,266 --> 00:29:35,266
- Oh.
- A traditional snowman.

626
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,100
Okay, here we go.
- Oh, that's fantastic.

627
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,433
- More snow.
- Hello!

628
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:40,033
- Oh, look who finally
showed up.

629
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:41,800
- So, I slept in
for once in my life.

630
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:43,567
- So, this must be
the famous Zoe.

631
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,567
- And this must be Colin,
the famous pastry-smushing

632
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,900
piano player.
- Guilty as charged.

633
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:50,233
Are you joining
the festivities?

634
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:52,633
- No, I'm just dropping off
some sustenance for the troops.

635
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:54,700
I gotta get back to the bakery.
I've only got two days

636
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,700
to prep for that
big order you almost...

637
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:58,433
- My apologies for that
near-disaster.

638
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:01,533
Luckily, Miss Daphne
managed to save the day.

639
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:04,400
- Yeah. Miss Daphne's
good like that.

640
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,767
Bye!

641
00:30:09,734 --> 00:30:11,500
- Okay. This looks good.

642
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:15,467
Finally picked a good
partner this year.

643
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,900
- You like him.
- I don't--

644
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,467
H-He's here not even a week.

645
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,033
- So? It's time you got over
the whole Billy situation.

646
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:23,734
- What?
There's no Billy situation.

647
00:30:23,867 --> 00:30:25,734
- Then how come you haven't
dated anyone serious-like since?

648
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:28,133
- I've dated.
- For longer than a month!

649
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:30,100
- That just speaks the quality
of the guy,

650
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:31,700
not that I've been
stuck up on one person.

651
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:33,600
- I just don't want you
to miss out.

652
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:36,033
- Says the girl who's been
engaged for how long?

653
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,300
- Two years.

654
00:30:37,433 --> 00:30:39,667
Just feels like longer
'cause we dated for ten.

655
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,767
- What's the deal?
- I don't know.

656
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,000
I guess it's just more romantic
to be engaged

657
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,266
than married, you know?

658
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,233
And, like,
what if we lose our spark?

659
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:48,600
And I'm a Rossi, okay?

660
00:30:48,734 --> 00:30:50,200
What's a Rossi's Bakery
without a Rossi?

661
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,934
- You know, there are ways
around that, right?

662
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:56,700
- Daphne, we need you
for the final push.

663
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:05,000
All good?

664
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:08,900
- Yeah. It's all good.

665
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,100
- Good.

666
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:14,767
- Okay. This looks good, guys.
- Does it?

667
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,400
- Thanks!

668
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:18,100
- That was awesome!

669
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:20,734
Grab the ribbon, you get
to take it.

670
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:27,200
- Good job, Mr. St. Bernard.

671
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:28,133
- Thank you.

672
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:32,166
- Oh, it's on!
- What're you gonna do about it?

673
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,333
- No, I could never hit a lady.

674
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:39,633
Come and get me! No!

675
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,600
- Your Majesty.
- Whitbey.

676
00:31:49,734 --> 00:31:51,233
Yes. How are things going?

677
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,667
- How are they going?

678
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,834
- Ah!

679
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:56,700
- I'd say smashingly.

680
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:59,333
- Oh, excellent. Excellent.

681
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:00,800
And the Prince.

682
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:03,467
Now, is he behaving himself?

683
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,333
- Absolutely.

684
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:11,967
- Oh, that's excellent, Whitbey.
Excellent.

685
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,300
Goodbye Whitbey.

686
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:16,367
All right, Vlad.
Once more around.

687
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,066
- Sorry.
- Okay, fine.

688
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,233
- Truce.
- Okay, fine. A truce.

689
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,633
Oh!

690
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:28,400
- Thanks.

691
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,633
- Oh, no, no.

692
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,967
- Ah! Oh!

693
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,834
Whitbey. Hi.

694
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:40,233
Uh...

695
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,734
This is my executive assistant,
Whitbey.

696
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:46,233
- Oh, hi. It's nice to meet you.

697
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:48,367
- A pleasure to meet you.

698
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,467
I apologize
for the interruptions,

699
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,166
but we do have
those meetings this afternoon,

700
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,600
and "the boss" insists
that you be there on time.

701
00:32:58,233 --> 00:32:59,734
- I'm sorry.

702
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:02,967
It appears that I-I have to go.

703
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,567
- No, for sure, yeah.

704
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,367
I hope you have
a great rest of your trip.

705
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,800
- Dee Dee?

706
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:18,467
This doesn't have to be
goodbye quite yet.

707
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:21,934
Your father asked if I could
cover for him for rehearsals.

708
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:24,467
- Really?
- That's quite impossible.

709
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,567
- I said, "With pleasure."

710
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,166
Sorry, old chap.

711
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,934
- Here's your music books.
Here you go.

712
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:48,500
Thank you.

713
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:55,400
- Mr. Colin! Yay!

714
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,400
- Mr. Colin's gonna be helping
out until Mr. Mickey's back

715
00:33:58,533 --> 00:33:59,934
with his wrist healing, okay?

716
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,467
All right, beautiful,
talented elves,

717
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,767
let's get in your spots.
We're gonna start

718
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,734
with Oh Christmas Tree.
All right?

719
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:09,767
What's that?

720
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,834
- Oh, that's my lucky charm.

721
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,967
I've had it with me
since I was a child.

722
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,300
I never play without it.

723
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:16,400
- Where'd you get it?

724
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:18,800
- My grandfather gave it to me
when I was a boy.

725
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:20,834
We were in Exeter,
just the two of us.

726
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:22,467
We found it in a shop there.

727
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,066
He knew how much I loved music
so he bought it for me.

728
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,567
Why do you ask?

729
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,500
- Oh, no, it's just funny

730
00:34:29,633 --> 00:34:32,433
'cause I also have
a piano Christmas tree ornament

731
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:34,266
that my Nonno Giuseppe got me
'cause he knows

732
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,834
how much I like music, so...

733
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:38,300
- Interesting.

734
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:40,934
- But I mean, I'm sure
a lot of people

735
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:43,533
have piano Christmas
tree ornaments?

736
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:46,467
- Oh, yeah. Given to them
by their grandfathers?

737
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,367
- Lots of people.

738
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:51,000
It's funny, for sure.

739
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:53,700
Um, we should
probably get started.

740
00:34:53,834 --> 00:34:55,367
- Yes.

741
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:07,066
- Good evening.

742
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,000
- Whitbey, I'm looking
at the press coverage of today,

743
00:35:09,133 --> 00:35:12,100
and I must say, I'm delighted!

744
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,166
- Ask about Adriana.
- Shh, shh.

745
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,867
- The Prince seems to have
acquitted himself admirably.

746
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,734
And the suit,
oh it's a nice step up

747
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,500
from a t-shirt and torn jeans.

748
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:23,567
- Did he mention Adriana?
- Shh.

749
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,967
Just the kind of image

750
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,734
the people of Exeter
need to see.

751
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:29,367
- I'm so pleased you're pleased.

752
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,300
- Adriana. Adriana!

753
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:33,667
- Have you spoken
to him about Adriana?

754
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,767
- Yes, Your Majesty.

755
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,233
- And how did he take it?

756
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:39,000
- He was surprised,

757
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:41,734
but he did express
affection for her.

758
00:35:41,867 --> 00:35:43,200
- Oh, excellent! Excellent!

759
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:44,867
Things couldn't be going
any better.

760
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,133
Goodnight, Whitbey.

761
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:47,934
- Your Majesty.

762
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,867
Oh, Whitbey.

763
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,667
Technically, everything
you said was true.

764
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:59,133
- The kids are getting
really good.

765
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:00,533
- They're all right.

766
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:02,100
No, they're good.
- All right.

767
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:04,367
Best and worst Christmas gifts
you ever received?

768
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,900
- Okay, that's easy.
Spice Girls roller skates.

769
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,734
I literally wore them everywhere

770
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,166
all the time
like they were shoes.

771
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,700
I actually got
sent home from school

772
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:13,800
because they weren't
appropriate.

773
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:15,233
- What?
- I know. Who knew?

774
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:19,166
- And worst?
- Uh, getting stood up.

775
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,500
- Who would dare stand you up?
- Right?

776
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:23,266
All right,
same question for you.

777
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,667
Maximillian Chesterton
Ridley the Third.

778
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,000
- I'm sorry. Did you get
a person as a present, or...?

779
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:32,700
- He was my Cavalier
King Charles Spaniel puppy.

780
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:35,033
- Aw. And worst?

781
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:37,033
- Spice Girls roller skates.

782
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:39,333
- I'd like to see that actually.

783
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,200
You sure you're up for this?
Not too soon to bail.

784
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,500
- I wouldn't dare miss Angie's,

785
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:52,600
or anyone else's delicacies,
for that matter.

786
00:36:52,734 --> 00:36:54,800
This is so much food.
Is there always this much?

787
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,333
- Welcome to Queens.

788
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:59,734
- I wish my parents
could see this. It's inspiring.

789
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:04,000
- Hey, sweetheart.

790
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:05,033
- Hey, Dad.

791
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:06,967
Wow! You got
a good one this year!

792
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,033
- This year?

793
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,800
When has he not?

794
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:13,600
So, Dee,
nice you brought your friend.

795
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:15,600
- Yeah, well, you know,
rehearsal ran late,

796
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,667
and I though the least
I could do was feed the guy.

797
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,734
- Least you could do, huh?

798
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:22,533
- Please allow me.
- Ah! No, Prince Charming.

799
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:24,633
No one touch the manicotti
but me.

800
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:26,700
Hmm? Carmine!

801
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,867
Come and help me
with the manicotti!

802
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,433
- You've done it again,
Uncle Mickey.

803
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:32,734
It's the kind of tree gonna make
any true love dream come true.

804
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:34,233
Right?

805
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:36,266
- Hey, I'm Eddie.
- Hello, I'm--

806
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,000
- Buddy, we all know
who you are.

807
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:43,500
- Yes, I should, um--
- That pastry-collision story

808
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:46,066
is already legendary!

809
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,033
- So, uh, tell me about
the wishes on the tree.

810
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:55,400
- Oh, that is true love.

811
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:57,367
So, you take
your favorite ornament,

812
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,800
place it on the tree,

813
00:37:58,934 --> 00:38:01,000
you close your eyes,
you make a wish,

814
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:02,700
and when you open 'em,

815
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,467
if they're staring
back at you...

816
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,200
- It's true love.

817
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,066
That's how I got my Ang, here.

818
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,367
- It's true.

819
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,667
- All right, all right,
all right.

820
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,867
There's not gonna be any
true love

821
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,367
if the tree is on the truck.

822
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,967
- Get to it.
- Fair enough. Have fun.

823
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,500
- Come on, Eddie.

- Well done, Sire.

840
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,300
- Quite a bit different
from last night's gathering.

841
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,900
You should have seen it,
Whitbey.

842
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:15,533
A whole neighborhood
working together

843
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:17,667
and doing it in a joyous way!

844
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,967
Wouldn't it be wonderful

845
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,934
if we could get the people
of Exeter involved

846
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:22,333
rather than simply
presenting them

847
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:23,900
with the palace's
ideas of Christmas?

848
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:26,166
- Your Highness,
the good people of Queens

849
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,000
obviously have their traditions,

850
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,300
but Exeter has its own.

851
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:33,000
- Something else for me
to attend to when I become King.

852
00:39:33,133 --> 00:39:35,200
- Your father will be delighted
to know

853
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,433
you're already thinking about
your future role.

854
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:39,967
- Yes, a future apparently
not so far away.

855
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:42,767
Hello.

856
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:50,100
- How's it going back here?

857
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:52,166
- Well, I ordered all
the extra ingredients

858
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,700
for the Charity Ball,
and I figure if we prep

859
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:56,767
the day before, then we can get
the delivery to the hotel

860
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,333
in time for the event. Easy!

861
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:00,767
- Did you talk to Eddie?

862
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,533
- No, but we talked about
setting a time to talk about it.

863
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:06,667
- Okay, well, that's a start.

864
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,734
- Yeah, speaking of starts,

865
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:11,900
you and Mr. Piano Man
seemed to be hitting it off.

866
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:14,333
- He lives 3,000 miles away

867
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:16,433
and he's only here for, like,
a week and a half.

868
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:19,200
- Blah, blah, blah.
You like him.

869
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,467
- Okay. I like him.

870
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,867
- Yeah, you do.

871
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,900
Hello, Rossi's Bakery,
how can I help you?

872
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,066
Why, yes, Colin!
She's right here.

873
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,967
Let me get her for you.

874
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,166
- Hi, Colin.

875
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,800
- Hi, Dee Dee.

876
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:41,133
So, listen, I've finished
my professional obligations

877
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:42,834
for the day, and I was
thinking of going out

878
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:44,233
and exploring the city.

879
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:46,567
I'm sure you probably can't get
away from the bakery right now,

880
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,700
but in case you wanted
to join me, I'm--

881
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:50,266
- She'd love to!

882
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,767
- Sorry, Colin,
that was my cousin Zoe.

883
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,000
Um, but, yeah,

884
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:57,066
I, uh, I'd love to.

885
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,100
- Well, that's smashing!

886
00:41:00,066 --> 00:41:01,734
- And I know
just where to take you.

887
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:07,133
It's amazing, right?

888
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:09,467
You know it takes, like,
all year for them to do this,

889
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,166
and it's like 100 people
that it takes to pull it off.

890
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,533
They even pick music
that perfectly

891
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:16,066
balances the senses.

892
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,667
'Kay, there's another one
I want to show you.

893
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,367
Look, over here.

894
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
Beautiful, huh?
- Yeah.

895
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:24,166
- My Dad and I would
do this every year.

896
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,767
We'd go window shopping
and then we'd make up

897
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,433
these elaborate stories
about what was happening

898
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:31,500
in each one. Kind of like
our way of seeing the world.

899
00:41:31,633 --> 00:41:33,667
Like, for these people,
I feel like,

900
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,266
it's a snowstorm, you know,
and they're rushing to get--

901
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,867
- To the mountains in Sweden.

902
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,133
- Yeah, for, like,
a big Christmas vacation.

903
00:41:40,266 --> 00:41:42,734
- 'Cause they're secretly
in love, and they want to elope.

904
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,166
- No, no, no! They wanna have
a big elaborate wedding

905
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,667
with all their family
and friends!

906
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,233
That's the energy
that I'm feeling.

907
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:49,967
Specifically from her, actually.

908
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,500
- I like this game.
- Yeah, it's cool.

909
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:54,900
And especially when I was a kid,
you know, it was sort of, like,

910
00:41:55,033 --> 00:41:57,133
a way to travel
to all these different places

911
00:41:57,266 --> 00:42:01,000
when, you know, we couldn't
always afford to do that.

912
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:03,066
- It's understandable.

913
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,467
- You know, I, um...

914
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:12,266
I had this very serious,
long-term boyfriend, Billy,

915
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,433
who I met in
high school, actually.

916
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:15,967
And we were together forever,

917
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,433
and we sort of had, like,
our entire lives planned out.

918
00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:21,000
We were supposed to meet

919
00:42:21,133 --> 00:42:23,500
at the Christmas Wishing
Tree together

920
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:28,100
and put our ornaments on,
and make a wish,

921
00:42:28,233 --> 00:42:29,467
and, um...

922
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,200
- The worst Christmas gift ever.

923
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,900
- Yeah.

924
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:36,333
- I think you're very brave,
Miss Daphne.

925
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:38,233
A natural leader.

926
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:39,834
- I don't know about that.

927
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:42,734
I feel like maybe the army
is more about following.

928
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:44,266
- I don't know.

929
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,533
I think if you
set your mind to it,

930
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:48,700
there's nothing
that you can't do.

931
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,934
- That's easier to say
when you have the means.

932
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:54,400
Actually, I didn't mean
that about you or anything.

933
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:56,033
- No, it's fine.

934
00:42:57,934 --> 00:43:01,266
I sometimes think
that with my position,

935
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,300
there's more I should do.

936
00:43:04,266 --> 00:43:06,000
More I should be.

937
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,800
- Hey mom, look!
That's so cool!

938
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:12,867
- Um...

939
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,467
There's this really cool place
around the corner

940
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,667
if you wanna go check it out.

941
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,900
Okay.

942
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:22,467
Follow me.

943
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,533
- It's like being trapped
inside a Christmas tree.

944
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,166
- Yeah, it used to take them
weeks to hang it all up

945
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,834
so at one point they just
decided to leave it up all year.

946
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:34,734
So, people actually come here
just to hang up

947
00:43:34,867 --> 00:43:36,133
their own Christmas ornaments.

948
00:43:36,266 --> 00:43:38,000
- So, will I find
your piano ornament

949
00:43:38,133 --> 00:43:39,333
hanging up here somewhere?

950
00:43:39,467 --> 00:43:41,800
- No, you will not,
because it's at my house.

951
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:44,734
It's very important to me.
I have to keep it safe.

952
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:46,533
- Not even on the Christmas
Wishing Tree?

953
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:49,133
- I almost hung it there, once,

954
00:43:49,266 --> 00:43:53,066
but I did not.
And I'm very glad that I didn't.

955
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,567
- Perhaps when the time
is right. Maybe.

956
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,900
- Perhaps, yeah.

957
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:02,266
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers to that.

958
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,166
So, are you ever going
to pursue music

959
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,200
outside of hotel lobbies
and bars?

960
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:10,000
'Cause you're really good.

961
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:11,900
Like honestly,
I think you're amazing.

962
00:44:12,033 --> 00:44:14,367
- Thank you.
Um, it's not an option for me.

963
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,266
I mean, if I could, I would.

964
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,333
When I play, I feel...

965
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,700
I feel free.

966
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:23,834
It's like I feel...

967
00:44:23,967 --> 00:44:25,367
like...

968
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,367
Just myself. Like, just Colin.

969
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,033
- Instead of...?

970
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,033
- My parents' son.
- Right.

971
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:34,800
- I don't want
to sound ungrateful.

972
00:44:34,934 --> 00:44:37,767
It's just simply...
- It's not all of who you are.

973
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,934
- Exactly.
- Right.

974
00:44:39,066 --> 00:44:41,734
- And I don't have much choice
in the matter, so...

975
00:44:42,967 --> 00:44:44,934
- You know, it's funny.
- What is?

976
00:44:45,066 --> 00:44:49,266
- It's just, you have all this
direction and no freedom,

977
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,900
and I have all
the freedom in the world

978
00:44:52,033 --> 00:44:53,900
and zero direction.

979
00:44:54,934 --> 00:44:58,433
- One of the things
I admire most about you

980
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:00,734
are your many interests.

981
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:04,133
And I know that
when you choose a direction,

982
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:06,767
you're gonna absolutely soar.

983
00:45:08,734 --> 00:45:10,100
- You're so good for my ego.

984
00:45:10,233 --> 00:45:12,900
I need to keep you around.

985
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:15,266
- Good. 'Cause I calls 'em
like I sees 'em.

986
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,000
- No. Never do that again.

987
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:20,767
Ever.

988
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,266
You are gonna be great
tomorrow!

989
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,800
Just remember to wear
red and white,

990
00:45:30,934 --> 00:45:33,533
and be on time, okay?
All right, let's get ready,

991
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:34,734
'cause what's in an hour?

992
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:37,433
- Secret Santa!
- That's right.

993
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:40,433
- Thank you, Miss Dee Dee!
This year has been the best!

994
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:42,000
And Mr. Colin, thank you, too.

995
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:44,100
- Thank you, Ava.
You have the voice of an angel.

996
00:45:44,233 --> 00:45:46,433
- I like the way he talks.

997
00:45:46,567 --> 00:45:47,700
- You did great today.

998
00:45:47,834 --> 00:45:48,967
I'll see you later.
- Bye.

999
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,433
You can come
to the Secret Santa,

1000
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:55,834
if you want.
- Thank you. I'd love to.

1001
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:57,700
However, since I wasn't around
for the name selection,

1002
00:45:57,834 --> 00:45:59,467
I have no gift to give.
- Right.

1003
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,867
Well, Santa works
in very mysterious ways,

1004
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,033
so I could probably
get you, like, a...

1005
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:08,800
- A delicious free meal?

1006
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:11,633
I might just need new trousers
when I return.

1007
00:46:16,767 --> 00:46:19,533
- They sound perfectly rustic.

1008
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:22,166
Well, I'm thrilled to know
the lasagna is delicious,

1009
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,667
but I... Oh, dear.

1010
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,133
Oh, I'm-I'm so sorry,
Your Highness,

1011
00:46:27,266 --> 00:46:29,400
I'm going to have
to call you back.

1012
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:30,934
Your Majesties.

1013
00:46:31,066 --> 00:46:33,900
What... We weren't expecting you
until tomorrow.

1014
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:36,400
- Well, your report on how well
the Prince had responded

1015
00:46:36,533 --> 00:46:39,266
to the discussion of his future
was so positive

1016
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,700
we couldn't resist
joining him early.

1017
00:46:41,834 --> 00:46:44,367
- And bringing him
a wonderful surprise.

1018
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,667
- How incredibly
thoughtful of you.

1019
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,166
I'm sure he'll be thrilled.

1020
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,266
- Whitbey, how lovely
to see you!

1021
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,233
- Duchess Adriana!

1022
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,700
Isn't this amazing?

1023
00:46:56,834 --> 00:46:59,100
One incredible delight
after another.

1024
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,767
- Oh, thank you, Whitbey.
You always know what to say.

1025
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,600
- And what to do! I know
it hasn't always been easy

1026
00:47:05,734 --> 00:47:08,367
being Colin's guardian,
but you're more than that.

1027
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,700
You're his friend,
and it comforts us to know

1028
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:12,433
that you give him
such good guidance.

1029
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:14,133
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

1030
00:47:14,266 --> 00:47:16,800
He can be a bit headstrong
at times,

1031
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:19,100
but his heart is always
in the right place.

1032
00:47:19,233 --> 00:47:20,934
That is an important
thing to remember.

1033
00:47:21,066 --> 00:47:23,166
- Speaking of Colin,
where is he?

1034
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,867
- He's, uh, presently engaged

1035
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,900
in a local children's
art program

1036
00:47:28,033 --> 00:47:31,133
that has really had
quite an impact on him.

1037
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:33,967
- Excellent! Another example
of royal behavior

1038
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,900
we were hoping to see from him.

1039
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:39,800
- Why don't we pay this
arts program a visit ourselves?

1040
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:42,133
Oh, wouldn't that
be delightful, Adriana?

1041
00:47:42,266 --> 00:47:44,300
- Of course. It's been
far too long

1042
00:47:44,433 --> 00:47:46,700
since Colin and I
have seen each other.

1043
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:48,166
- Let me just text him

1044
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,900
so he's able
to receive you properly.

1045
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,800
- Oh, let's make it a surprise!

1046
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:54,100
I can't wait to see his face
when we walk in

1047
00:47:54,233 --> 00:47:55,767
with Duchess Adriana.

1048
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,367
- Neither can I, Your Majesty.

1049
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,700
- Then it's settled.
Lead on, Whitbey! Lead on!

1050
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,100
- Parents here, on our way.

1051
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,533
- Weren't the kids so adorable?

1052
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,734
- Like a school of piranhas.

1053
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:21,667
You never told me
about the costume change.

1054
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,600
- Ooh, I dunno.
That must've slipped my mind.

1055
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,066
I don't know what happened.

1056
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,734
- How come you got away
with playing dress-up?

1057
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:29,100
- Well, 'cause you're here!

1058
00:48:29,233 --> 00:48:31,867
So, well, thank you, buddy!

1059
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,533
Ho, ho, ho!

1060
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:42,133
- "Honor's ear. Baron's elf."

1061
00:48:42,266 --> 00:48:43,934
- Is everything okay?

1062
00:48:44,066 --> 00:48:46,633
- Yes. I think my assistant
Whitbey just sent me

1063
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:48,433
what we in Exeter
call a "pocket text."

1064
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:51,233
- Ha. In our house,
we call that a Mickey.

1065
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:54,033
- Hey! It happened one time
that happened!

1066
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:55,500
Okay, maybe two times.

1067
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:58,266
- Hey, look, there's still
one present left.

1068
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,100
- Hmm.

1069
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,333
Oh, it's for you.

1070
00:49:05,767 --> 00:49:07,800
- "To Colin St. Bernard."

1071
00:49:08,433 --> 00:49:11,066
- Open it.

1072
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,300
- I mean, this is amazing.

1073
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:15,266
Somehow Santa knew
where I was gonna be.

1074
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,767
A keyboard scarf!

1075
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,633
This is perfect.

1076
00:49:25,367 --> 00:49:27,000
Let's see this.

1077
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:30,367
It's lovely.

1078
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,500
- It looks good.

1079
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:34,734
- I have a feeling I know
who my Secret Santa is.

1080
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:38,033
- Well, if you know, you're not
supposed to say anything.

1081
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:40,000
- This is too much.

1082
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:42,100
I feel bad that Santa
didn't get you anything.

1083
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:44,100
- Are you kidding me?
He got me a piano player

1084
00:49:44,233 --> 00:49:46,000
when I needed one the most.

1085
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:49,667
- Should you happen to find out
who my Secret Santa is...

1086
00:49:51,467 --> 00:49:53,400
give them this for me.

1087
00:49:57,934 --> 00:50:01,400
- Surprise! Your Highness.

1088
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,633
- Uh... Mother, Father,
um, Adriana?

1089
00:50:05,767 --> 00:50:08,200
- That guy just call Colin,
"Your Highness?"

1090
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:11,133
- I had no idea you were
arriving tonight.

1091
00:50:11,266 --> 00:50:12,900
- It was a last-minute decision.

1092
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:15,567
And your mother
wanted to surprise you, Colin.

1093
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,934
- Yes, and by
the look on your face,

1094
00:50:18,066 --> 00:50:20,633
and your outfit, we did.

1095
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,533
- How did you know where I was?

1096
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:24,567
- I told them you were involved

1097
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,734
in this wonderful
children's art program,

1098
00:50:27,867 --> 00:50:30,066
and they insisted on seeing it.

1099
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,934
- Right, yes, of course. Um...

1100
00:50:32,066 --> 00:50:33,467
Well, the children
have all gone,

1101
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,467
but allow me to introduce you

1102
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,367
to some new, but very dear
friends of mine.

1103
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,100
Uh,
Angelica and Mickey Paretti.

1104
00:50:41,233 --> 00:50:43,333
- Hi.
- Their daughter Dee Dee,

1105
00:50:43,467 --> 00:50:45,400
who runs it, her friend, Zoe,

1106
00:50:45,533 --> 00:50:48,300
and her fiancé, Eddie,
who is a chef at our hotel.

1107
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:49,900
- 'Sup?

1108
00:50:50,033 --> 00:50:51,900
- Ah, yes,
and this is Miss Sophie.

1109
00:50:52,033 --> 00:50:55,767
- King Sebastian,
Queen Alexandra of Exeter.

1110
00:50:58,266 --> 00:51:00,200
- Queen?
- King?

1111
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:02,800
- Ma, you knew?

1112
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,767
- I used the Google.

1113
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,734
- So, when you said
family business,

1114
00:51:06,867 --> 00:51:08,233
you meant that you're a prince?

1115
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:09,967
- Yes.

1116
00:51:11,266 --> 00:51:12,800
- So, I'm gonna guess
your last name

1117
00:51:12,934 --> 00:51:14,867
isn't St. Bernard either.
- No.

1118
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,667
- Colin.

1119
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,266
- Right, yes, sorry.

1120
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,600
Um, and let me present
Duchess Adriana, my, um...

1121
00:51:24,734 --> 00:51:26,667
- The Prince's companion

1122
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,567
for the Children's Charities
Christmas Ball.

1123
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:35,133
- Oh, well, uh, Your Highness,

1124
00:51:35,266 --> 00:51:36,533
you must be parched.

1125
00:51:36,667 --> 00:51:39,900
We got lots of hot chocolate
here. It's delicious.

1126
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:41,900
- Excuse us.

1127
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:45,333
- Thank you.
That would be delightful.

1128
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:47,834
- Oh, we'd be honored.

1129
00:51:48,767 --> 00:51:49,867
- Go ahead.

1130
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,300
- Miss Daphne, please wait.

1131
00:51:55,367 --> 00:51:57,867
- Look, I know we're not
a fancy Royal Family,

1132
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,066
but we have integrity.
You should have told me.

1133
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,900
- I wanted to tell you.

1134
00:52:03,033 --> 00:52:04,333
This was the first time
in my life

1135
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:06,100
that people didn't
recognize who I was.

1136
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:08,266
You and your family treated me
like a regular person,

1137
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,533
and I loved it.

1138
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:11,333
And the longer it went on,
the harder it was

1139
00:52:11,467 --> 00:52:14,433
for me to say anything.
I'm sorry.

1140
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:18,533
I really liked being
Colin and Dee Dee.

1141
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,333
- Well, I'm sorry
that you're not gonna be able

1142
00:52:24,467 --> 00:52:26,367
to play with us tomorrow night.

1143
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,000
The kids are really
gonna miss you.

1144
00:52:29,133 --> 00:52:30,367
- Mickey's wrist
is still injured.

1145
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,600
You don't have a backup.
- I'll find someone.

1146
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:33,700
- Christmas week?

1147
00:52:33,834 --> 00:52:35,500
- Yeah, sure. I'll just go scour

1148
00:52:35,633 --> 00:52:37,867
all the fancy hotel lobbies
and ask all the piano players,

1149
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,734
"Hey, are you a secret member
of royalty?

1150
00:52:39,867 --> 00:52:40,900
No? Great. You're hired."

1151
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,934
- Then I'll tell them
we don't need their services

1152
00:52:43,066 --> 00:52:44,000
because I will fulfill
my promise.

1153
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:46,533
- It's ridiculous. You can't.
You're a prince!

1154
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:49,367
- And a prince always
fulfills his commitments.

1155
00:52:53,033 --> 00:52:54,900
- Commitments?

1156
00:52:55,033 --> 00:52:56,834
Is that all
this has been to you?

1157
00:52:56,967 --> 00:52:59,800
- Of course not.
- Honestly, it's fine.

1158
00:52:59,934 --> 00:53:02,533
The kids will just sing
a cappella.

1159
00:53:03,467 --> 00:53:04,934
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Your Highness,

1160
00:53:05,066 --> 00:53:08,133
I have to go clean,
like a real person.

1161
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:26,033
- And I'm telling you, Dee,
I did not see any chemistry

1162
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:28,500
between Colin and Duchess
whatever-her-name-was.

1163
00:53:28,633 --> 00:53:30,667
It's probably just one of those
PR dates.

1164
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,700
You know, photo-op.
Means nothing.

1165
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,767
- I know you're trying
to make me feel better,

1166
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,967
and I appreciate it,
I really do, but I'm fine.

1167
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,867
- Dee, it's me
you're talkin' to.

1168
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:45,867
- I mean, sure,
was he super handsome,

1169
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
and charming, and kind,

1170
00:53:50,133 --> 00:53:51,266
and talented?

1171
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,066
But he lied to me.

1172
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,233
I mean, fool me once,
it's not gonna end well.

1173
00:53:57,367 --> 00:54:00,433
- Dee--
- Zo, he's a prince.

1174
00:54:00,567 --> 00:54:02,400
I'm not a princess.

1175
00:54:02,533 --> 00:54:04,800
- But you felt like one.

1176
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,200
- Once again, Sire,
my apologies,

1177
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:13,667
but I did try
to text you a warning.

1178
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,500
- Yes, in this instance,
Whitbey,

1179
00:54:15,633 --> 00:54:17,900
autocorrect was not our friend.

1180
00:54:19,433 --> 00:54:23,700
- Um, four-letter word
for buffet.

1181
00:54:23,834 --> 00:54:26,033
- Buffet, hmm? Cart!

1182
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:28,233
- Ha ha ha! Cart!

1183
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,266
- Oh, good morning, son.
How handsome you look.

1184
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,867
- Thank you, Mother. Father.

1185
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,700
So, what's on the agenda
for you two today?

1186
00:54:35,834 --> 00:54:39,667
- Your mother and I are hosting
a luncheon for VIP donors,

1187
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,433
and then overseeing
final preparations

1188
00:54:41,567 --> 00:54:42,600
for tomorrow's ball.

1189
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:45,367
Which means you have
the entire day

1190
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,066
to spend with Adriana.

1191
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,100
- The entire day?
- Yes.

1192
00:54:49,233 --> 00:54:51,900
Whitbey tells me you've become
quite a fan of the city,

1193
00:54:52,033 --> 00:54:54,333
so you can show her
some of your favorite spots.

1194
00:54:54,467 --> 00:54:56,700
And then tonight, you two
have a dinner reservation

1195
00:54:56,834 --> 00:54:59,133
at La Bernadine at 7:00.

1196
00:54:59,266 --> 00:55:00,834
- I'm afraid I have
a commitment tonight.

1197
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:02,967
- Cancel it.
- I can't.

1198
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
- What?

1199
00:55:05,133 --> 00:55:06,934
- I promised Dee Dee
I'd help with their concert.

1200
00:55:07,066 --> 00:55:09,834
- Colin, you have been
very generous with your time,

1201
00:55:09,967 --> 00:55:12,633
but you have other obligations
we need you to attend to.

1202
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,233
And Adriana is one of those.

1203
00:55:15,367 --> 00:55:19,166
- Your father's right.
Sit down, son.

1204
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,800
We know that Whitbey
has broached the subject

1205
00:55:25,934 --> 00:55:27,300
of your future.

1206
00:55:27,433 --> 00:55:30,500
Your father and I have decided
it's time for us to retire,

1207
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:34,100
and for you to begin
assuming your responsibilities.

1208
00:55:34,233 --> 00:55:36,767
- As you know, it is our custom

1209
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,667
that we find the proper
companion for you.

1210
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,166
- And we believe Duchess Adriana
is that person,

1211
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,834
and it would be good for you
to spend some time with her.

1212
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:48,000
- Mother, I think Adriana
is lovely--

1213
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:51,100
- And here she is,

1214
00:55:51,233 --> 00:55:54,033
looking as lovely as Colin
just said you were.

1215
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:57,767
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
Thank you, Colin.

1216
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,467
- The shop windows were designed
by local artists.

1217
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,800
- Shopping!

1218
00:56:07,934 --> 00:56:09,433
Oh, there must be
all sorts of things

1219
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:11,734
we can't get in Exeter. Come!

1220
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:22,200
- Have a good day! Ava!
Mrs. Rodriguez! Hi!

1221
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:23,700
- Hi, Miss Dee Dee.
- Dee Dee,

1222
00:56:23,834 --> 00:56:25,934
have you met my daughter,
Ava's mother?

1223
00:56:26,066 --> 00:56:29,000
- Principal Deacons, right?
From P.S. 267?

1224
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:30,300
- Yeah, that's right.

1225
00:56:30,433 --> 00:56:32,567
I can't wait to hear
her sing tonight.

1226
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,800
- Well, I think you'll be
very proud.

1227
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:36,600
- Mr. Colin says I'm an angel.

1228
00:56:36,734 --> 00:56:38,567
- Mr. Colin?

1229
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,367
- Uh, yeah, that was our
temporary piano guy.

1230
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,300
- The Prince?

1231
00:56:44,433 --> 00:56:45,633
- Does everyone know?

1232
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:48,433
- Well, I'm most interested
in hearing the concert tonight.

1233
00:56:48,567 --> 00:56:51,633
Ava's been raving about
Miss Dee Dee all month.

1234
00:56:51,767 --> 00:56:53,133
- Well, I think you'll...

1235
00:56:53,266 --> 00:56:55,934
I think you'll be pleased
with or without a piano player.

1236
00:56:56,066 --> 00:56:58,066
- Let's go see what she's got.

1237
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,533
- You are an excellent
tour guide, Colin!

1238
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:10,633
I've had a delightful time.

1239
00:57:10,767 --> 00:57:12,900
I'm just not sure you did.

1240
00:57:14,066 --> 00:57:15,300
- Is it that obvious?

1241
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:17,667
- Colin, we've known each other
a long time.

1242
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,333
What is it? You can tell me.

1243
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:22,600
- I know we're supposed to have
dinner this evening,

1244
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:24,567
but I already promised friends
that I'd help them

1245
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,834
with their arts program.

1246
00:57:25,967 --> 00:57:27,367
- Well, that's not a problem!

1247
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,300
Oh, we can push dinner
until later.

1248
00:57:29,433 --> 00:57:30,967
- Really?
- Of course.

1249
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,667
In fact, why don't
I come with you to the event

1250
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,033
and we can go to dinner
from there?

1251
00:57:35,166 --> 00:57:36,700
- You might find it boring.

1252
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:38,033
- Colin, I insist.

1253
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:40,900
If it's important to you,
then it's important to me.

1254
00:57:41,033 --> 00:57:42,567
Come.

1255
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:52,834
Honey, you look
beautiful. Don't stress.

1256
00:57:52,967 --> 00:57:55,233
- Thank you, Mom.
- It's gonna be great.

1257
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,300
- Sorry! Christmas traffic.

1258
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,467
- No, no.
No apologies necessary.

1259
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,567
We're just happy
you could make it.

1260
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:06,100
Oh, Duchess Adriana,
so happy you could join us.

1261
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:08,500
- Thank you. I'm really
looking forward to this.

1262
00:58:08,633 --> 00:58:10,433
- Hello, Mickey, Angie.

1263
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:12,200
- Hmm.
- Sophie.

1264
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:13,600
- Uh-huh.

1265
00:58:13,734 --> 00:58:15,233
- Hey, Colin.

1266
00:58:17,567 --> 00:58:19,367
- Come on. Let's go sit.

1267
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:23,867
- So, you ready, Your Highness?

1268
00:58:24,433 --> 00:58:25,633
- It's still Colin.

1269
00:58:25,767 --> 00:58:28,567
- Yeah, I dunno
if I can do that, so...

1270
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,467
We gotta get this show
on the road.

1271
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,066
So, excuse me.

1272
00:58:37,967 --> 00:58:41,633
Hello. Welcome to the annual
Little Queens Christmas Pageant!

1273
00:58:41,767 --> 00:58:44,133
Thank you guys so much
for your generous support.

1274
00:58:47,867 --> 00:58:49,734
Your amazing kids have been
working so hard.

1275
00:58:49,867 --> 00:58:52,066
We can't wait for you
to hear how amazing they are.

1276
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,967
So, you guys are in for
a very special treat tonight.

1277
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,567
Enjoy. We have some
surprises for you.

1278
00:58:58,433 --> 00:59:01,934
Okay, ready?
Eyes on me. Deep breath.

1279
00:59:02,066 --> 00:59:04,033
Have fun! Okay?

1280
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,867

- Hey, Ma.
- Hey. I brought you some tea.

1319
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:51,133
- Ah, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1320
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:01,600
Hey! We made the papers!

1321
01:03:01,734 --> 01:03:03,300
- What? Wow.

1322
01:03:03,433 --> 01:03:06,033
- Can you believe it?
We brought in three times

1323
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:07,734
the donations
from the last year.

1324
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,633
- Are you serious?
- Can you believe it?

1325
01:03:09,767 --> 01:03:12,433
- Wow! Well, I guess something
good came outta all this.

1326
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:14,767
- Oh, honey.
It was for something,

1327
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,166
and it was because of you.
Don't kid yourself.

1328
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,667
A lot of good came outta this.

1329
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,467
- I had nothing to do with it.

1330
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,867
- Of course you did!

1331
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,400
You had everything
to do with it!

1332
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:26,033
This wouldn't have been possible
without you!

1333
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:28,500
I mean, it's just like
this guy here. Right, buddy?

1334
01:03:28,633 --> 01:03:30,467
I mean, he wouldn't be here
if you hadn't brought him

1335
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,300
back with you,
and then you helped, like,

1336
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,266
a dozen of your fellow
service members

1337
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,533
get their K-9's, too.

1338
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:37,600
- Yeah, I mean,
it was important.

1339
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:39,467
- That's right.

1340
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,600
And, hey, you brought
real live royalty

1341
01:03:42,734 --> 01:03:44,667
right here to Queens.

1342
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:46,800
You?

1343
01:03:46,934 --> 01:03:50,133
You're a little dynamo,
Daphne Dolores Paretti.

1344
01:03:50,266 --> 01:03:51,800
And don't you forget it.

1345
01:03:51,934 --> 01:03:53,400
- Okay.

1346
01:03:53,533 --> 01:03:55,533
Oh. I love you, Ma.

1347
01:03:55,667 --> 01:03:57,467
- I love you too.

1348
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,834
- I'm gonna go shower.
- Okay.

1349
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,734
- You know, I still
can't believe

1350
01:04:05,867 --> 01:04:07,300
Nonna knew about this
the whole time!

1351
01:04:07,433 --> 01:04:10,567
- Right? I mean, who knew
out of everybody in the family,

1352
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,333
she's the one
who could keep a secret?

1353
01:04:12,467 --> 01:04:14,834
- Who would've thought?
- Go figure.

1354
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,400
- What were you thinking?
Do you know how this looks?

1355
01:04:34,533 --> 01:04:36,166
- Like a member
of the Royal Family

1356
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,333
contributing to a very
worthwhile neighborhood cause.

1357
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,900
- Really?

1358
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:45,467
- That's a snowman competition!

1359
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,500
- And the young lady?
- A friend.

1360
01:04:48,633 --> 01:04:49,900
I hope.

1361
01:04:50,033 --> 01:04:53,066
- Well, the Times of Exeter
is asking all sorts of questions

1362
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,033
about you and this young woman.

1363
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:57,633
- Dee Dee. Her name is Dee Dee.

1364
01:04:57,767 --> 01:05:00,600
- Colin, we wanted the people
of Exeter to get used

1365
01:05:00,734 --> 01:05:02,834
to the image of you and Adriana,

1366
01:05:02,967 --> 01:05:04,700
not you and some random girl
from Queens.

1367
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:07,000
- She's not some random girl!
She's a remarkable woman

1368
01:05:07,133 --> 01:05:08,633
who's utterly blameless
in the situation.

1369
01:05:08,767 --> 01:05:10,867
- That may be,
but it's not the issue!

1370
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,133
The press is!

1371
01:05:12,266 --> 01:05:14,000
Now, Whitbey has managed
to placate them

1372
01:05:14,133 --> 01:05:17,333
as long as you make a statement
to the press before the ball.

1373
01:05:17,467 --> 01:05:21,233
- Perhaps on your relationship
with Duchess Adriana?

1374
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,066
Oh, Colin, we know
your feelings for her

1375
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,066
are not as deep
as you would like them to be.

1376
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,066
But your father and I,
we barely knew each other

1377
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,000
when we were married,
and over time,

1378
01:05:31,133 --> 01:05:34,400
we grew to love and respect
one another completely,

1379
01:05:34,533 --> 01:05:37,400
and there's no reason
that couldn't happen for you,

1380
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:40,367
even if you can't believe
it quite yet.

1381
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,066
- No, Mother.
I absolutely believe

1382
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,266
love can come
in unexpected ways.

1383
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,233
- Well, I'm glad
to hear you say that.

1384
01:05:46,367 --> 01:05:47,400
- As am I.

1385
01:05:47,533 --> 01:05:48,800
And, Colin,
your mother and I know

1386
01:05:48,934 --> 01:05:51,700
that in the end,
you'll do the right thing.

1387
01:05:51,834 --> 01:05:53,000
- Yes. Of course.

1388
01:05:53,133 --> 01:05:55,433
- And Colin, your mother and I
are not completely

1389
01:05:55,567 --> 01:05:57,867
without interest in change.

1390
01:05:58,767 --> 01:06:01,633
We saw your performance
last night.

1391
01:06:01,767 --> 01:06:02,667
- You did?

1392
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,066
- Yes, darling, we did.

1393
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,867
And you have quite
the musical talent.

1394
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,867
In fact, we plan
to incorporate it

1395
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,400
into many future royal events.

1396
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:15,233
- Your mother and I very much
desire your happiness, son.

1397
01:06:15,367 --> 01:06:19,033
- Yes, but only when
it's convenient for you both.

1398
01:06:22,633 --> 01:06:24,567
- That was not fair.

1399
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,467
- Have a good day.

1400
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,767
Hi! Principal Deacons.

1401
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,100
- Dee Dee. You know,
I wanted to talk to you

1402
01:06:41,233 --> 01:06:43,100
after the concert.
Thank you so much.

1403
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:44,500
Ava has been over the moon

1404
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:46,233
throughout the whole experience
with the choir.

1405
01:06:46,367 --> 01:06:48,734
- Aw, that's so sweet.
Ava is such a joy.

1406
01:06:48,867 --> 01:06:50,800
- Look, there's something else.

1407
01:06:50,934 --> 01:06:52,200
And feel no pressure,

1408
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:53,834
but one of the things
I've been looking to do

1409
01:06:53,967 --> 01:06:56,166
for a while now is bring
programs like what you did

1410
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,000
to the school. You know,
music and art activities?

1411
01:06:59,133 --> 01:07:00,934
What you did with the choir
fits in line

1412
01:07:01,066 --> 01:07:01,967
with what I had in mind.

1413
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,700
Have you ever considered
anything like that?

1414
01:07:03,834 --> 01:07:07,867
You know, creating after-school
enrichment programs for kids?

1415
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,233
- No, not, not really.
Not outside of the choir.

1416
01:07:12,367 --> 01:07:14,367
- Well, would you be interested?

1417
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,200
- Yeah, actually, I would.

1418
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:21,667
- Good.

1419
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,367
- And it'd be, like,
an after-school

1420
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,834
kind of arts program, you know,
but more than just music?

1421
01:07:25,967 --> 01:07:27,266
Kim said she's been trying
to get it going

1422
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,533
since they've been
cutting funding at the school.

1423
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:30,567
- That's amazing!

1424
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:31,767
- I'm excited.

1425
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,367
Something about it
just feels right, you know?

1426
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,934
- Look at us, all grown up.

1427
01:07:37,066 --> 01:07:39,533
You got a future,
Eddie and I set a date.

1428
01:07:39,667 --> 01:07:42,200
- Wait, what? When?
- Next New Year's Eve.

1429
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:44,433
- I'm so excited for you, Zo!

1430
01:07:44,567 --> 01:07:47,033
- Thank you. Thank you
for all your advice.

1431
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:48,867
- That's what cousins
are for? Come on.

1432
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,567
- You know,

1433
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,333
if you took your own advice,
things could turn out different?

1434
01:07:53,467 --> 01:07:55,266
I mean, just think about it.

1435
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,233
If the Prince told you he was
a prince from the beginning,

1436
01:07:58,367 --> 01:07:59,633
would you have asked him
to play piano?

1437
01:07:59,767 --> 01:08:02,600
- That's not the point.
- So, what's the point?

1438
01:08:02,734 --> 01:08:04,867
- I don't know.

1439
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,100
- I'll tell you the point.

1440
01:08:06,233 --> 01:08:08,633
The point is, he wanted
to get to know you.

1441
01:08:08,767 --> 01:08:10,834
And he was afraid that if you
knew he who he really was,

1442
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:13,700
it would change
your relationship. Which it did.

1443
01:08:13,834 --> 01:08:15,200
- There is no relationship, Zo.

1444
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:17,667
The duchess was on
his arm last night.

1445
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,867
That's the only
relationship I see.

1446
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:23,867
- Okay.

1447
01:08:35,233 --> 01:08:38,000
- It pains me to see you
so unhappy, Sire.

1448
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,200
- Well, I've made my bed

1449
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:42,000
and I have to lay in it,
Whitbey.

1450
01:08:43,033 --> 01:08:44,967
- I'll talk to the hotel chef
about making you

1451
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,300
some of that special tea
you liked the other day.

1452
01:08:47,433 --> 01:08:49,700
- Thank you, Whitbey.

1453
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,700
- Sire? Sire!

1454
01:09:21,467 --> 01:09:22,533
- Whitbey, what is it?

1455
01:09:22,667 --> 01:09:24,200
- Didn't you see my text?

1456
01:09:24,333 --> 01:09:26,567
She's downstairs in the kitchen!

1457
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,066
- Dee Dee?
- Well, I'm not talking

1458
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,300
about your mother! Oh.

1459
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:32,333
Sorry, Your Highness.

1460
01:09:32,467 --> 01:09:34,200
This situation has me flummoxed.

1461
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:37,200
- Yes. You're forgiven.

1462
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:38,900
Uh, right, let's, um...

1463
01:09:44,433 --> 01:09:45,900
Come on...

1464
01:09:46,033 --> 01:09:48,066
- Thank you so much.
Everything's perfect.

1465
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,333
It's magnifique .
- Thank you for the opportunity.

1466
01:09:50,467 --> 01:09:52,533
- Of course.
- Thank you.

1467
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,900
- Oh.

1468
01:09:58,033 --> 01:10:00,166
- I'll be in the van.
- I'll come with you.

1469
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,033
- Ah, ah. No.

1470
01:10:03,133 --> 01:10:04,734
- Dee Dee, I, um...

1471
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,533
- Really, Colin, you don't
have to apologize again.

1472
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:09,800
- This isn't an apology.

1473
01:10:09,934 --> 01:10:14,567
It's, um, it's a statement
and a question.

1474
01:10:15,734 --> 01:10:17,433
It's gonna sound crazy,
we've just known each other

1475
01:10:17,567 --> 01:10:19,266
a short time.

1476
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:23,066
I've never felt for anyone
like I feel for you right now.

1477
01:10:25,367 --> 01:10:28,533
And I just need to know
if you feel the same way.

1478
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,567
- What does it even matter?

1479
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:36,367
I mean, we come from
two completely different worlds.

1480
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:39,400
It's like, yeah, a bird
and a fish can fall in love.

1481
01:10:39,533 --> 01:10:41,300
Where are they gonna live?

1482
01:10:41,433 --> 01:10:43,600
- But, um...
- Colin, you're a prince.

1483
01:10:43,734 --> 01:10:45,967
- Yeah?
- You have obligations

1484
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,400
about what you're supposed to do

1485
01:10:47,533 --> 01:10:49,166
and who you're supposed
to do it with.

1486
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:53,166
I'm the daughter
of a truck driver and a nurse.

1487
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,500
Tonight you're going to a ball

1488
01:10:54,633 --> 01:10:57,166
and I'm going
to a tree lighting in Queens.

1489
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,967
And tomorrow you're gonna be
back in Exeter,

1490
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:01,333
and I'm still gonna be here.

1491
01:11:01,467 --> 01:11:02,834
- It doesn't have
to be that way.

1492
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,600
- Yeah, it does.

1493
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:09,800
This isn't a fairy tale.
I'm not wearing a glass slipper.

1494
01:11:09,934 --> 01:11:14,100
And I would be lying if I said
that I didn't feel the same way.

1495
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,200
But it's not possible.

1496
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,300
I'm sorry.

1497
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,200
- Oh, hello.

1498
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,734
- Colin, I say this
with greatest affection,

1499
01:11:41,867 --> 01:11:44,467
but you look rather
a misbuttoned mess.

1500
01:11:45,533 --> 01:11:48,567
- Great. Perfect symbol
of my life right now.

1501
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:51,834
- Colin, we've known each other
our whole lives.

1502
01:11:51,967 --> 01:11:54,033
I would hope you'd feel
you could tell me

1503
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:55,667
whatever it is
you're going through,

1504
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,500
as I would want to tell you
what I'm feeling.

1505
01:11:58,633 --> 01:12:01,533
- Yes, of course.
Um, here, let's sit down.

1506
01:12:03,967 --> 01:12:04,967
- All right.

1507
01:12:06,633 --> 01:12:08,567
- Adriana, I...

1508
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,066
We have too long a history,

1509
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,834
and I have too much
regard for you not to be honest.

1510
01:12:14,967 --> 01:12:18,467
While I have enormous
affection for you,

1511
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,333
I don't feel the way
my parents want me to feel.

1512
01:12:23,033 --> 01:12:24,600
- Well...

1513
01:12:25,433 --> 01:12:27,767
It's about time you admitted it.

1514
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,400
- You knew?

1515
01:12:29,533 --> 01:12:31,300
- Of course I knew.

1516
01:12:31,433 --> 01:12:34,600
Any woman who saw the way
you looked at Dee would know.

1517
01:12:34,734 --> 01:12:36,500
- Can you forgive me?

1518
01:12:36,633 --> 01:12:38,500
- Colin, I spent
the entire flight over

1519
01:12:38,633 --> 01:12:41,200
trying to figure out
how I was going to tell you

1520
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:43,700
I don't want to go through
with the marriage!

1521
01:12:43,834 --> 01:12:45,367
- You don't?

1522
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,000
- Do you think
you're the only one

1523
01:12:47,133 --> 01:12:49,834
struggling with a conflict
between duty and heart?

1524
01:12:49,967 --> 01:12:52,266
- Are you telling me you're
in love with someone else too?

1525
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,800
- Yes.

1526
01:12:53,934 --> 01:12:55,166
- Oh, my!

1527
01:12:56,633 --> 01:12:59,166
I've never been more happy
for anyone my entire life!

1528
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,333
- So, what do we do now?

1529
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:04,433
- I have to tell my parents
how I truly feel.

1530
01:13:11,533 --> 01:13:15,000
- That's a push.
- Oh, I think it sounds superb.

1531
01:13:15,133 --> 01:13:16,800
- Mother, Father.
I need to talk to you

1532
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,367
before we face the press.

1533
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,533
- Oh, yes, the press.

1534
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:21,400
We need to discuss
that with you as well.

1535
01:13:21,533 --> 01:13:24,900
- It seems your father and I
owe you an apology.

1536
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,100
- For what?

1537
01:13:26,233 --> 01:13:29,133
- Whitbey has briefed us
on the public reaction in Exeter

1538
01:13:29,266 --> 01:13:31,367
to your performance in
the children's Christmas choir,

1539
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:35,633
and the reaction has been
overwhelmingly positive.

1540
01:13:35,767 --> 01:13:37,533
- It has?

1541
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:41,767
"A new generation
of Exeter royalty has emerged.

1542
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:43,900
A true prince of the people.

1543
01:13:44,033 --> 01:13:46,633
Prince Colin shows
he is a breath of fresh heir."

1544
01:13:46,767 --> 01:13:49,266
You see, they spelled air,

1545
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,000
H-E-I-R.

1546
01:13:51,133 --> 01:13:52,667
- Er, thank you, Whitbey.
Thank you.

1547
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,800
- It was funnier in print.

1548
01:13:54,934 --> 01:13:57,900
- It appears your father and I
may have been,

1549
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:01,400
as you suggested,
a bit too rigid.

1550
01:14:01,533 --> 01:14:03,266
Your lighter, warmer touch

1551
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,734
may be exactly
what the country needs.

1552
01:14:05,867 --> 01:14:07,734
- It means so much to me
to hear that.

1553
01:14:07,867 --> 01:14:09,734
- However, there is still
the issue

1554
01:14:09,867 --> 01:14:11,367
of you and Duchess Adriana.

1555
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,900
- Yes, about that--
- We know of your feelings

1556
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,400
for Miss Paretti.

1557
01:14:15,533 --> 01:14:19,166
And I do understand.
We are not without heart.

1558
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:22,300
- However, it is simply
quite impossible.

1559
01:14:22,433 --> 01:14:24,200
- For a multitude of reasons.

1560
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,500
- Why? Because someone
centuries ago

1561
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:27,100
decided who and who
is not acceptable?

1562
01:14:27,233 --> 01:14:29,333
- Son, you do not speak
to your mother that way!

1563
01:14:29,467 --> 01:14:32,500
We will announce your engagement
to Adriana

1564
01:14:32,633 --> 01:14:35,934
and my retirement to the press
this evening at the ball.

1565
01:14:36,066 --> 01:14:37,433
- Father!

1566
01:14:37,567 --> 01:14:39,700
- That is the end
of this discussion.

1567
01:14:46,934 --> 01:14:49,000
There is simply no choice.

1568
01:14:53,867 --> 01:14:56,000
Well, is there?

1569
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,367
- Well done. Nice.

1570
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,934
- Ma, those came out perfect.

1571
01:15:07,066 --> 01:15:08,934
Honey, you want cinnamon, right?

1572
01:15:09,066 --> 01:15:10,467
- Please.
- Yeah.

1573
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,367
Okay, so you really used
Nonna Sophie's bird fish line?

1574
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,100
Really?
- I mean, it seemed fitting!

1575
01:15:15,233 --> 01:15:17,567
- Ah, your Nonno Giuseppe
said that line to me.

1576
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:18,767
- Oh, geez.
- Really?

1577
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:22,133
- In Italy. I was 18,
from a good family in Naples.

1578
01:15:22,266 --> 01:15:24,233
He was a fisherman's son
from Sicily.

1579
01:15:24,367 --> 01:15:26,100
But that summer
when we visited,

1580
01:15:26,233 --> 01:15:28,533
he was working at the hotel
where we fell in love.

1581
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:30,333
But we kept it a secret.

1582
01:15:30,467 --> 01:15:32,433
- What happened?
- Uh, we eloped!

1583
01:15:32,567 --> 01:15:35,633
- They jumped on a ship.
- And landed in Queens.

1584
01:15:35,767 --> 01:15:38,800
- Where we were happily married
for 55 years.

1585
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:40,200
Wasn't always easy,

1586
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:44,633
but love always finds a way. Mm?

1587
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,467
- Thank you, Nonna.
But I think I'm gonna focus

1588
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,500
on finding my own
happily ever after.

1589
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:51,066
I'm gonna meet
with Principal Deacon

1590
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,800
over at P.S. 267
and, I don't know,

1591
01:15:53,934 --> 01:15:56,533
maybe talk about starting, like,
a music enrichment program.

1592
01:15:56,667 --> 01:15:58,533
And then if it goes well,
we could expand it

1593
01:15:58,667 --> 01:15:59,800
to other schools
in the districts.

1594
01:15:59,934 --> 01:16:01,500
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean,

1595
01:16:01,633 --> 01:16:04,233
nothing's set in stone,
but she came to the concert

1596
01:16:04,367 --> 01:16:06,066
and she really liked it,
and I just...

1597
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,600
I don't know,
when she mentioned it,

1598
01:16:07,734 --> 01:16:09,333
something about it
just felt so right, you know?

1599
01:16:09,467 --> 01:16:11,066
- Honey, that's wonderful!

1600
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,066
- That school is so close.

1601
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,800
It means you can stay here
and live with us

1602
01:16:15,934 --> 01:16:17,800
while you're working over there.

1603
01:16:17,934 --> 01:16:19,767
- Dad, it's time
I got my own spot.

1604
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,567
- Your own spot?
- In the neighborhood.

1605
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:22,667
In the neighborhood!

1606
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,367
- This house is
in the neighborhood!

1607
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,500
- Oh boy.

1608
01:16:25,633 --> 01:16:26,533
- Okay.

1609
01:16:26,667 --> 01:16:28,433
That, or you can
stab me in the heart.

1610
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:30,300
- Stop. Okay, you ready?

1611
01:16:30,433 --> 01:16:31,433
- Go ahead.

1612
01:17:11,633 --> 01:17:13,533
- Good evening. First of all,

1613
01:17:13,667 --> 01:17:16,667
let me say that the Queen and I
are very proud

1614
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,633
to be honorary chairs
at this year's

1615
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:21,233
International Children's
Charity Ball.

1616
01:17:21,367 --> 01:17:23,667
And I'm so pleased to announce

1617
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,300
that we have raised
a record amount

1618
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,066
for this wonderful cause.

1619
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:32,133
- But as you know,
this charity focuses

1620
01:17:32,266 --> 01:17:34,333
on the largest
international programs,

1621
01:17:34,467 --> 01:17:37,233
and as wonderful
as their work is,

1622
01:17:37,367 --> 01:17:39,533
our son, Prince Colin,
has reminded us

1623
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:42,400
that there are countless
smaller, local charities

1624
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:45,934
that don't get the attention
or the funds they deserve.

1625
01:17:46,066 --> 01:17:47,367
- Yes, indeed.

1626
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:50,500
First, thank you
to the amazing city of New York

1627
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:52,700
and especially Queens
and the Paretti family

1628
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:55,033
for showing me the true
meaning of Christmas.

1629
01:17:55,166 --> 01:17:58,233
I know that you're here
eagerly anticipating news

1630
01:17:58,367 --> 01:18:01,600
on the King's retirement
and plans for me to take over--

1631
01:18:01,734 --> 01:18:04,033
- Ah, not quite yet.

1632
01:18:05,266 --> 01:18:09,100
If this week and my son
have taught me anything at all,

1633
01:18:09,233 --> 01:18:12,133
it is that I still
have work to do.

1634
01:18:12,266 --> 01:18:14,300
Changes to be made.

1635
01:18:14,433 --> 01:18:16,300
- Although we will be spending
more time

1636
01:18:16,433 --> 01:18:17,967
within our private lives,

1637
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,300
when the time comes
for us to retire,

1638
01:18:20,433 --> 01:18:22,700
we will first discuss
with our son

1639
01:18:22,834 --> 01:18:26,433
what is best for him
and the future of Exeter.

1640
01:18:26,567 --> 01:18:29,000
Out of respect for his wishes.

1641
01:18:29,133 --> 01:18:31,000
- Oh, thank goodness!

1642
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,867
- What made you
change your mind?

1643
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,834
- You did, of course.

1644
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:43,834
Your passion and conviction,
for yourself and others.

1645
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,033
All quite right.

1646
01:18:45,166 --> 01:18:47,700
- And I realized
I'm not quite ready to retire.

1647
01:18:47,834 --> 01:18:49,567
But when I do, Colin,

1648
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:51,934
you will be the one
to decide your future,

1649
01:18:52,066 --> 01:18:53,734
whatever that may be, son.

1650
01:18:53,867 --> 01:18:55,166
- Even if that doesn't
involve the throne?

1651
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,900
- Well, your cousin Louis
has been eyeing the job

1652
01:18:58,033 --> 01:18:59,400
for years, so...

1653
01:19:00,667 --> 01:19:03,433
- Now, don't you have
someplace else to be?

1654
01:19:03,567 --> 01:19:05,300
- Indeed I do.

1655
01:19:07,233 --> 01:19:09,467
Father. Adriana.

1656
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:19,600
- Rock and roll, Sire.

1657
01:19:19,734 --> 01:19:21,066
- I will.

1658
01:19:24,633 --> 01:19:27,834
- Aw, see, this is nice, huh?

1659
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:29,767
Getting outta the house is good.

1660
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:33,033
- Yeah. I'm not closing my eyes
and making a wish, though.

1661
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:36,066
- Yeah, well. You got me so,

1662
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,500
really, what more do you need?

1663
01:19:37,633 --> 01:19:40,433
- That's true.

1664
01:19:50,433 --> 01:19:51,934
- Come on!

1665
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,734
- What would you sell
this scooter for?

1666
01:19:59,233 --> 01:20:00,233
- Are you serious?

1667
01:20:00,367 --> 01:20:02,600
- I've never been more serious
in my entire life.

1668
01:20:02,734 --> 01:20:04,033
- Thousand bucks.

1669
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:06,133
- Um...

1670
01:20:06,266 --> 01:20:09,166
Oh. Would you take a watch?

1671
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:12,300
- Yeah.

1672
01:20:24,734 --> 01:20:27,100
- Sorry! Oh!

1673
01:20:27,233 --> 01:20:29,600
Sorry! Oh, oh!

1674
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,767
- Hey, Ma?

1675
01:20:42,533 --> 01:20:44,100
- I put it in there.

1676
01:20:44,233 --> 01:20:46,433
Just in case you change
your mind, you know?

1677
01:20:46,567 --> 01:20:47,533
- All right.

1678
01:20:47,667 --> 01:20:48,967
- It can happen.

1679
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,767
- Okay, here we go.

1680
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:53,333
- Ow!
- Geez!

1681
01:20:53,467 --> 01:20:55,867
- Sorry, sorry! Okay, everybody!

1682
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,033
Here we go!
What time is it?

1683
01:20:59,166 --> 01:21:01,166
Countdown time!

1684
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:03,533
- That's right.
Now, keep it loud and clear,

1685
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:07,233
and don't forget to bring
your wishes! Here we go!

1686
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:09,033
Ten!
Ten!

1687
01:21:09,166 --> 01:21:10,767
- Nine!
Nine!

1688
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,300
- Eight!
- Eight!

1689
01:21:12,433 --> 01:21:13,767
- Seven!
- Seven!

1690
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:15,200
- Six!
- Six!

1691
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:16,467
- Five!
- Five!

1692
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,133
- Four!
- Four!

1693
01:21:18,266 --> 01:21:19,767
- Three!
- Three!

1694
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,533
- Two!
- Two!

1695
01:21:22,667 --> 01:21:25,266
- One! Merry Christmas!

1696
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:28,000
Merry Christmas!

1697
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:30,333
- Oh my gosh.

1698
01:21:30,467 --> 01:21:32,533
What are you doing here?

1699
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:35,667
- Shh.

1700
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,467
Hello.

1701
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,500
- Hi.

1702
01:21:51,633 --> 01:21:53,233
- You had your eyes closed.

1703
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:56,800
- Yeah, I was making a wish.

1704
01:21:56,934 --> 01:21:58,734
- Please tell me it came true.

1705
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:02,533
- I don't know yet.
Did you make a wish?

1706
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:05,266
- I did.
- Did it come true yet?

1707
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,967
- I don't know yet.
But I'm hopeful.

1708
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,900
You once told me
that I should be in charge

1709
01:22:13,033 --> 01:22:14,500
of my own life.

1710
01:22:14,633 --> 01:22:18,233
Simple words, and yet no one
had ever said that to me before.

1711
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:20,567
I don't think anyone
had thought it possible,

1712
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,767
much less me, until now.

1713
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:28,467
- What are you saying by that?

1714
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,600
- Daphne Dolores Paretti,

1715
01:22:31,734 --> 01:22:34,433
you have always taken me
for who I am, not what I am.

1716
01:22:34,567 --> 01:22:37,200
And that means everything to me.

1717
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:39,900
You mean everything to me.

1718
01:22:40,734 --> 01:22:42,567
You are my wish.

1719
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:46,033
- But what about your parents
and all that stuff?

1720
01:22:46,166 --> 01:22:47,734
- I have my parents' blessing.

1721
01:22:47,867 --> 01:22:50,200
They know how much
you mean to me.

1722
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:53,600
Now, tell me...

1723
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,400
Did your wish come true?

1724
01:23:18,233 --> 01:23:20,233
- Does that answer
your question?

1725
01:23:20,367 --> 01:23:21,600
- I believe it does.

1726
01:23:21,734 --> 01:23:23,834
Though one can never
be too sure.

1727
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:10,433
difuze
