(contemplative piano music

333
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,459
This is Carl, Carl Icahn on.

334
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,417
If I could interrupt
for a minute.

335
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,626
The CEO was just nefarious.

336
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:35,375
He, his job in his mind was
to make himself a lot of money

337
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:37,500
at the expense of shareholders,
he didn't care.

338
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:40,792
And at the expense of
the company enriched himself.

339
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:44,209
The idea that
some management teams

340
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:46,209
were kind of not being
very smart

341
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:49,709
and taking advantage of
their position as managers

342
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,584
to the detriment
of the shareholders,

343
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:54,042
you know, he got that
in his head early on,

344
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,334
when the rest of the world
wasn't quite sure, you know,

345
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:58,751
was this greenmail,
what, what was this?

346
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:01,834
This is one of-- the most
reprehensible thing

347
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:03,459
I think I've ever seen...

348
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:06,584
But to some degree
he's been vindicated that,

349
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:09,459
yes, management often needs
to be shaken up.

350
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:12,167
He's helped stockholders
an awful lot,

351
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,834
including plumbers and teachers
whose pension funds

352
00:18:15,918 --> 00:18:17,334
fund their retirement.

353
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:21,042
So this is not just hoity-toity
big-time investors.

354
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,209
The downside of that
is to say, yeah, but what about

355
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:26,667
all the people
who lost jobs because of what
Carl did at all these companies?

356
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:29,250
(somber digital music playing)

357
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:37,626
Carl and guys like him, I think
the core criticism would be that

358
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:39,626
they're not out to make
these companies better,

359
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:41,334
they're out to make
a lot of money.

360
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:46,626
Part of my values
is to make money and I
can't change my values.

361
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,125
A great painter loves to paint.

362
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:50,292
What do you do, criticize him
because he likes to paint?

363
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:54,209
But what makes me fulfilled
about it is

364
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:58,417
that I also believe I'm making
money by doing the right thing.

365
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,292
Sorkin:<i> We've been having</i>
<i>a debate, it's an open debate,</i>

366
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,584
'cause I've done it
in the columns,

367
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:07,626
about his role as a vulture

368
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:10,667
or a shareholder advocate,
and which is it?

369
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:14,083
<i>And on certain days,
I've come out on the side</i>

370
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:17,500
of shareholder advocate,
and he, you know, loves it.

371
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:20,459
And on certain days,
I have called him a vulture,

372
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,083
and he'll call up screaming.

373
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:26,959
What I like about Carl
is he's game for the debate,

374
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,792
he wants that debate.

375
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,250
Carl:<i> Companies are</i>
<i>the backbone of our society,</i>

376
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:34,375
and many are terribly managed
and there's no accountability.

377
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:36,667
When you can change that,

378
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,083
you will have
some collateral damage,

379
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:40,751
there's no question,
it's creative destruction.

380
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:43,083
But we bring in the innovation,

381
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,959
so we have companies
that are more productive,

382
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:48,500
create more jobs,
in a macro picture.

383
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:49,876
At the end of the day,

384
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:52,417
Carl wants to make as much
money as possible,

385
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,334
despite what he may come out
and say publicly

386
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:58,167
or write in one of his letters.

387
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,125
I mean, that's
the criticism you hear.

388
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:02,709
Carl:<i> So everybody says,</i>
<i>"Well, that's great,</i>

389
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:04,792
<i>Carl Icahn made money
for himself."</i>

390
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:08,042
But the real proof of
the pudding is in the eating.

391
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,959
If you had invested
in Icahn Enterprises in 2000,

392
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:14,792
when we really started
getting into the activism,

393
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:17,459
the value of your investment
has increased

394
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:19,626
1,931%.

395
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:23,042
During that same period,
your investment in the S&P

396
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,709
went up only 324%.

397
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:30,626
<i>We have made for shareholders,</i>

398
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,209

399

<i>literally a trillion dollars</i>

400
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,417
<i>for all investors.</i>

401
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:39,584
I think I proved it
by making all this money.

402
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,167
This system should be changed

403
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,292
and that we should have true
corporate democracy

404
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,709
and accountability.

405
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:51,292
Frankly, I made this money
because the system is so bad,

406
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,834
not 'cause I'm a genius.

407

Carl:<i> I grew up</i>

00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,500
<i>It was sort of divided.</i>

417
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:14,792
<i>In public school, you had

418

00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,125
<i>From the other side

420

423
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:28,292
But the more my mother said,
"Don't do it," the more
I wanted to do it.

429

on philosophers and philosophies
and was unrelenting,

430
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:48,876
and his mother, who was
unrelenting another way.

431
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,667
She wanted him to go
to medical school,

432
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:52,542
but they were both
very intense people.

433
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:54,375
He had a tough childhood.

434
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:57,584
I mean, you know, his parents
would brag about him in public

435
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:59,500
but kind of berate him,
privately.

436
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,709
(contemplative music playing)

437
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:12,459
I was never really happy
in that whole environment.

438
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,167
So I really wanted
to get out of there.

439
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,709
I was real smart in school,
and I had good marks.

440
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:20,083
<i>I took the college boards,</i>

441
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:23,959
<i>and I think I did the best
in Queens or something on 'em.</i>

442
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,417
And my father did say to me,

443
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,209
"If you get into Yale,
Harvard or Princeton,

444
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:30,876
we'll pay the tuition."

445
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:33,083
<i>'Cause they figured

<i>from Far Rockaway

447
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:37,459
<i>And so I got into all of 'em.</i>

448
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:40,751
And everybody
was really surprised,
including my parents.

449
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:43,709
<i>I wanted Princeton.</i>

450
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:46,042
But then when it came
to thinking about paying
the tuition,

451
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:50,292
it was only $750 in those days,
and the room and board was $750.

452
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:53,083
<i>My father said, "Son, we're
not gonna go back on our word.</i>

<i>I said,
"Thanks, Dad, that's great.</i>

<i>I appreciate it greatly."</i>

456
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:58,959
And then it hit me, I said,

457
00:22:59,042 --> 00:23:00,667
"What about
room and board, Dad?"

458
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:03,125
<i>And then he said,
"You're a smart kid.</i>

459
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,667

465
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:27,250
<i>And you could make close
to $100 a week.</i>

466
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:30,375
And these salesmen,

467
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:33,000

468
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,292

00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,250

<i>So I said, "Yeah,

473
00:23:45,751 --> 00:23:48,584
And they wiped me out
in about a half an hour.

474
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:49,959
I lost the $100.

475
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:52,709
I said, "Hey, I'm smarter
than these guys."

476
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:56,500
<i>So during the week, I went out,
I got three books on poker.</i>

661
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:34,959
-You talk to me like
I'm a moron. I can-- Okay.
-I know. (laughs)

662
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:38,042
-Michelle, I'll show you
how to do it.
-(laughing)

663
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,792
Michelle:
<i>As a child,</i>

664
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:43,375
<i>I didn't know how monumental
the deals were</i>

665
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:46,083
<i>that my dad was involved in.</i>

666
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:48,792
I just knew he was
really, really busy.

667
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:55,083
But PayPal is
an exciting company,

668
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:57,959
but it should have been
spun off, but the board
didn't wanna lose it.

669
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,250
After we were fighting
to spin it off for three years,

670
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:02,542
and the CEO suddenly
had an epiphany.

671
00:33:02,626 --> 00:33:06,125
"Wow, great idea I just had.
Let's spin off PayPal."

672
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:07,626
And the stock went way up.

673
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:09,459
He works all the time.

674
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:12,125
I think that was,
that's his mission.

675
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:15,667
What's surprising is

676
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:17,334
that I think Bernie Sanders

677
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:20,083
and even Elizabeth Warren
have a point.

678
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,918
And I don't like them, I mean,
because I don't like socialism.

679
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,626
I don't think it could work,
but what they are saying,

680
00:33:25,709 --> 00:33:28,250
this wealth gap,
the tremendous wealth gap,

681
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:30,083
-should not exist.
-Yeah.

682
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:32,709
People on Wall Street
are tremendously overpaid.

683
00:33:32,792 --> 00:33:36,250
The investment bankers make
ridiculous incomes,

684
00:33:36,334 --> 00:33:39,292
relative
to what they contribute.

685
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:41,667
You know, I think my father
is an activist.

686
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:46,167
I think by nature he wants
to create change.

687
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,042
When I came into Wall Street,

688
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:52,334
I realized playing the market
is extremely risky,

689
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:55,125
extremely dangerous, so...

690
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:58,375
Michelle:
<i>He talks a lot about</i>
<i>the market in 1962.</i>

691
00:33:58,459 --> 00:34:00,709
You know, for him that was...

692
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:04,209
I think that was one
of the most impactful moments.

693
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,334
(intense digital music playing)

694
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:13,292
Carl:<i> When I got out</i>
<i>of the army, basically,</i>

695
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:16,209
I went to Wall Street
because I was into stocks,

696
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:17,792
I was into making money.

697
00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:21,918
<i>I got in the training program
at Dreyfus</i>

698
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,918
<i>and started investing,</i>

699
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,042
<i>and it fit perfectly for me.</i>

700
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,542
<i>And I'm making a fortune.</i>

701
00:34:28,626 --> 00:34:30,584
<i>I'm making all this money.</i>

702
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:34,417
I bought a Galaxy convertible.

703
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,542
<i>I had a beautiful girlfriend.</i>

704
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:38,876
<i>And life was good,
and I figured,</i>

705
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:41,667
<i>"This is the easiest
damn thing I ever did."</i>

706
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:44,250
And Jack Dreyfus came to me,
said, "You know,

707
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,292
<i>"Carl, you're a smart guy.</i>

708
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,959
<i>"You're gonna lose every penny

709

<i>Learn to be an investor,

710
00:34:52,334 --> 00:34:54,834
<i>He says, "You're
just one of the fools."</i>

711
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:57,834
<i>I said, "Come on, Jack,
move over," you know,
we're laughing.</i>

712
00:34:57,918 --> 00:35:01,751
And I learned a great lesson.
You always pay for hubris.

713
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:04,709
<i>In '62, the market broke.</i>

714
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,584
<i>Terrible.</i>

715
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:08,000
<i>Jack was right.</i>

716
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,459
<i>I was wiped out.</i>

717
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:10,876
<i>I don't know which went first,</i>

718
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:13,250
the Galaxy
or the girlfriend I had.

719
00:35:15,292 --> 00:35:17,209
After that, I never played
the market again.

720
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:19,709
Really, literally,
I went to work.

721
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:24,083
♪ ♪

722
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:27,167
I had to learn one area
and be an expert in it.

723
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,209
I looked at the option world.

724
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:33,167
I realized there
was something awry,
that there was a problem.

725
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,751
Options were mysterious.

726
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:37,626
What should they sell for,
what should you buy them for?

727
00:35:37,709 --> 00:35:39,876
You had no place
to really know and look

728
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:41,626
about what was a good deal.

729
00:35:41,709 --> 00:35:43,876
(percussive music playing)

730
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,334
Carl:
<i>The option brokers were all...</i>

731
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:55,626
<i>I wouldn't say thieves,</i>

732
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:57,542
<i>but you would say
they didn't give a damn.</i>

733
00:35:57,626 --> 00:36:00,334
<i>So they would go buy
these options</i>

734
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:03,125
<i>and make
a huge markup on them.</i>

735
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:04,834
So I came up
with something called

736
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:06,626
"The Midweek Option Report,"

737
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:08,209
that would tell people,

738
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,918
"This is what you should have
been getting for your option

739
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,584
and this is what you got,
and you got screwed."

740
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,250
<i>And I'm an obsessive worker.</i>

741
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:22,209
<i>I would stay down
on Wall Street
working till midnight,</i>

742
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:25,751
<i>calling people up
because in California
it was only nine o'clock.</i>

743
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:27,542
<i>I didn't know
about mugging or anything.</i>

744
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:29,042
<i>I'd go back,
I'd be the only guy</i>

745
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,042
<i>on the subway going uptown.</i>

746
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:36,542
And I was looked on
as an honest broker,
and the business boomed.

747
00:36:36,626 --> 00:36:40,125
And I became one of
the biggest brokers on
Wall Street doing that.

748
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:43,626
Stevens:
<i>But in the evolution of Carl,</i>

749
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:45,667
to be a real player,
he had to have a seat

750
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:47,375
on the New York Stock Exchange.

751
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:50,375
Carl:
<i>I had saved</i>
<i>a few hundred grand,</i>

752
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,125
<i>and my uncle had some money,</i>

753
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:55,250
and I decided to buy
the seat on the Exchange.

754
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,792
Elliot Schnall:
<i>Tell me when you're on.</i>

755
00:36:58,876 --> 00:37:00,292
(clapper claps)

756
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,834
I was...

757
00:37:01,918 --> 00:37:04,334
17 when Carl was born.

758
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:07,375
<i>He was like a kid brother.</i>

759
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:11,667
Elliot was a man about town.

760
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,626
He was distinguished

761
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:15,751
and polished.

762
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:18,417
Carl learned a lot from Elliot.

763
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,209
He wanted to start
his own firm,

764
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:25,584
and in order to do that,
you had to buy a seat.

765
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:28,959
reporter:<i> Uncle Elliot</i>
<i>loaned Icahn $400,000</i>

766
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:31,876
<i>so he could buy a seat on
the New York Stock Exchange.</i>

767
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:35,000
No, I knew he would be
a success at it.

768
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,292
Then he started his own firm.

769
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:40,500
reporter:<i> Icahn began</i>
<i>with options and arbitrage.</i>

770
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:43,918
<i>Then in 1979,
he had a new idea: takeovers.</i>

771
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,667
<i>He told Uncle Elliot</i>

772
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:48,667
<i>he was going to start going
after undervalued companies.</i>

773
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:51,709
I said, "Well, what do you know
about undervalued companies?"

774
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:54,000
He says, "Look,
I'm going to do it."

775
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:57,250
I said, "Carl, forget it."
I thought he was crazy.

776
00:37:57,334 --> 00:37:59,083
I'll give you some scotch here.

777
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:00,542
He just bought it today.

778
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:03,042
It's good for ya.
Here, let me give it to ya.

779
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,292
No, I don't want any more.

Hey, you look good, Elliot,
you look good.

781
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:09,959
-Elliot: I look good?
-You look okay.

782
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:11,542
You look fine.

flooding into Wall Street

01:03:30,042 --> 01:03:32,250
played into every stereotype

1316
01:03:32,334 --> 01:03:34,709
of the evil Wall Street
financier.

1317
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:37,000
The companies
that he leaves behind

1318
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:38,459
incur a tremendous
amount of debt

1319
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:40,292
and then they
start laying off,

1320
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:41,918
and that's more
and more Americans

1321
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,250
falling below
the poverty line.

1322
01:03:43,334 --> 01:03:45,626

a counselor since the strike

1323
01:03:45,709 --> 01:03:48,667

devastating to have lost...

attendant my entire adult life.

Every one
of those flight attendants

1326
01:03:52,709 --> 01:03:55,167
could have walked across
the picket line, which many did.

1327
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:58,042
Many of them said,
"Hey, Vicki Frankovich,
the heck with it."

1328
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,542
They could have
kept their jobs.

that we couldn't afford.

01:11:25,792 --> 01:11:28,167
I don't know why I do.

1480
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:30,334
I felt...

1481
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:33,584
a certain warmth.

1482
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:34,959
A certain warmth.

1483
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:37,876
That was, that was my father.

1484
01:11:40,459 --> 01:11:42,584
They, they say,
"Thou shall not kill,"

1485
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:46,751
and later on you go,
"An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth," right?

1486
01:11:46,834 --> 01:11:49,334
So they're all
sort of contradictory.

1487
01:11:49,417 --> 01:11:51,375
(both laugh softly)

1488
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:02,167
reporter 1:
<i>Some say Carl Icahn was</i>
<i>20 years ahead of his time,</i>

1489
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,042
<i>battling the corporate world</i>

1490
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:06,375
<i>in the name
of shareholder value.</i>

1491
01:12:06,459 --> 01:12:08,000
Aw, come on!

1492
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:10,459
reporter 2:
<i>When TWA filed for bankruptcy,</i>

1493
01:12:10,542 --> 01:12:14,083
<i>it hurt his reputation,
but he pressed on,</i>

1494
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:17,751
<i>returning to the scene
with years of proxy fights,</i>

1495
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:20,125
<i>all the while demonstrating
his knack</i>

1496
01:12:20,209 --> 01:12:22,000
<i>for corporate combat.</i>

1497
01:12:23,334 --> 01:12:25,417
(percussive music playing)

1498
01:12:31,209 --> 01:12:34,042
(trance music playing)

1499
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:41,209
Herbalife is
a global nutrition company

1500
01:12:41,292 --> 01:12:42,834
that sells our products
exclusively

1501
01:12:42,918 --> 01:12:45,459
through a network of people
just like you.

1502
01:12:47,292 --> 01:12:50,042
Herbalife is a nutrition company
based in California

1503
01:12:50,125 --> 01:12:53,626
that Carl Icahn probably
had never heard of.

1504
01:12:53,709 --> 01:12:55,292
I mean, nothing.

1505
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:57,417
Until Bill Ackman showed up.

1506
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:02,876
Throughout my career,
the vast majority,

1507
01:13:02,959 --> 01:13:04,959
particularly our most
successful investments,

1508
01:13:05,042 --> 01:13:07,584
have been ones that have been
controversial in one way
or another.

1509
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:11,459
Bill Ackman is another one
of the major activist
investors out there.

1510
01:13:11,542 --> 01:13:12,959
He's a fellow billionaire.

1511
01:13:13,042 --> 01:13:15,542
One of these masters
of the universe in New York.

1512
01:13:15,626 --> 01:13:19,000
<i>Harvard educated
versus Carl's Princeton.</i>

1513
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:23,000
reporter:
<i>Although unlike Carl,</i>
<i>he was born into privilege.</i>

1514
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:27,459
He also likes to publicly
spar with companies
the way Icahn does,

1515
01:13:27,542 --> 01:13:29,876
but he goes about it
in a slightly different manner.

1516
01:13:29,959 --> 01:13:31,959
<i>And please welcome
Bill Ackman.</i>

1517
01:13:32,042 --> 01:13:36,250
(crowd applauding)

1518
01:13:36,334 --> 01:13:38,167
<i>Okay, so we've got
a lot to cover today,</i>

1519
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,918
<i>so we're going to move
pretty quickly.</i>

1520
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,626
<i>Why don't we start...</i>

1521
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:43,834
Sorkin:
<i>So Bill Ackman decides</i>

1522
01:13:43,918 --> 01:13:47,375
that Herbalife effectively
is a fraud, it's a scam.

1523
01:13:47,459 --> 01:13:50,667
<i>Herbalife is a pyramid scheme.</i>

1524
01:13:50,751 --> 01:13:52,125
<i>It's caused enormous harm</i>

1525
01:13:52,209 --> 01:13:54,500
<i>to millions around the world.</i>

1526
01:13:56,417 --> 01:13:57,792
<i>Our goal is for the facts</i>

1527
01:13:57,876 --> 01:14:00,000
<i>about Herbalife
to be made public.</i>

1528
01:14:00,083 --> 01:14:03,542
And he believes that
if he's able to expose

1529
01:14:03,626 --> 01:14:06,459
what he believes are the
company's frauds to the public,

1530
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:08,918
that regulators
are gonna jump in

1531
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,709
and the stock is gonna tank.

1532
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:12,459
<i>I don't want to make
any money from this, okay?</i>

1533
01:14:12,542 --> 01:14:14,709
<i>I view this as blood money,
but let me be clear.</i>

1534
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:16,292
<i>We'll short the stock.</i>

1535
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:18,250
<i>Herbalife stock goes down,
we make money.</i>

1536
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:20,167
<i>Herbalife stock goes up,
we lose money.</i>

1537
01:14:28,584 --> 01:14:29,918
He's gonna short the company,

1538
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
so he's gonna bet that
the stock is gonna fall

1539
01:14:32,083 --> 01:14:35,167
all the way to zero.

1540
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:38,709
Ackman:<i> A pyramid scheme is</i>
<i>actually a modern-day version</i>
<i>of a Ponzi scheme.</i>

1541
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:42,751
Carl, meanwhile,
is watching this all play out.

1542
01:14:42,834 --> 01:14:45,292
Ackman:
<i>...the version is called 3.0.</i>

1543
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,792
<i>It's 1.0 is the Ponzi scheme.</i>

1544
01:14:47,876 --> 01:14:50,584
And he's thinking to himself
that Bill is gonna lose,

1545
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:53,626
that he's never gonna
get the stock to go
even further down

1546
01:14:53,709 --> 01:14:55,751
and effectively bets
against him.

1547
01:14:55,834 --> 01:15:00,500
(discordant music plays)

1548
01:15:00,584 --> 01:15:02,000
Carl:
<i>Ackman is a real,</i>

1549
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:04,125
<i>I think, a smart guy
and a good investor.</i>

1550
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:06,667
He might have talked himself
into believing

1551
01:15:06,751 --> 01:15:09,167
that he was going to be
a savior,

1552
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,626
but I felt that Ackman
had an agenda.

1553
01:15:11,709 --> 01:15:14,459
♪ ♪

1554
01:15:14,542 --> 01:15:19,042
Icahn and Ackman
had done a deal together
some years earlier

1555
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:24,209
where the contract
was somewhat ambiguous.

1556
01:15:24,292 --> 01:15:29,334
And the court eventually said
that Icahn had to pay.

1557
01:15:29,417 --> 01:15:31,167
After Carl paid Bill,

1558
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,667
the unwritten rule
on Wall Street,

1559
01:15:33,751 --> 01:15:36,417
"Don't gloat
about your victories."

1560
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,209
Bill went to the newspaper
and he gloated about the victory

1561
01:15:39,292 --> 01:15:42,542
and that pissed Icahn off
like you don't know.

1562
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:45,125
I think Herbalife was personal.

1563
01:15:45,209 --> 01:15:47,959
Carl:<i> Ackman's whole thesis</i>
<i>is completely wrong.</i>

1564
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:50,250
<i>I mean, I can't even
understand his argument.</i>

1565
01:15:50,334 --> 01:15:53,667
I was walking through
the CNBC newsroom,

1566
01:15:53,751 --> 01:15:57,918
and I saw Carl on TV
on another network

1567
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,292
absolutely annihilating Ackman.

1568
01:16:00,375 --> 01:16:02,918
Carl:<i> He may believe what</i>
<i>he's saying, I don't know.</i>

1569
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,751
<i>Herbalife gives jobs to people.</i>

1570
01:16:04,834 --> 01:16:07,209
<i>I mean, it's absurd
what Ackman is saying.</i>

1571
01:16:07,292 --> 01:16:11,042
And I stopped in my tracks
and I said,

1572
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:12,584
"This is unbelievable."

1573
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:15,918
And I was kind of mad that
it was happening somewhere else.

1574
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,083
But I went and I called Bill.

1575
01:16:18,167 --> 01:16:21,751
And I said, "Do you want
to respond to this?"

1576
01:16:21,834 --> 01:16:23,250
And he's like, "You know what?

1577
01:16:23,334 --> 01:16:24,626
"Carl's an asshole.

1578
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:26,500
"I'm sick and tired
of this bullshit.

1579
01:16:26,584 --> 01:16:28,292
"He tried to take
advantage of me.

1580
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:31,500
I'll come on, I'll do it"
So I said, "Great."

1581
01:16:31,584 --> 01:16:33,667
(intense music playing)

1582
01:16:33,751 --> 01:16:35,751
Ackman:<i> Carl has been</i>
<i>maligning my reputation,</i>

1583
01:16:35,834 --> 01:16:37,834
<i>so it's very important
that we get to the facts.</i>

1584
01:16:37,918 --> 01:16:40,876
Ackman comes on,
we're talking about Herbalife.

1585
01:16:40,959 --> 01:16:43,667
Ackman:<i> Carl, he can try</i>
<i>to scare my investors</i>
<i>from investing with me,</i>

1586
01:16:43,751 --> 01:16:45,459
<i>which it sounds like
he's attempting.</i>

1587
01:16:45,542 --> 01:16:48,834
And then Carl calls in
to the control room.

1588
01:16:48,918 --> 01:16:51,125
I look down at my computer
and there's a tweet

1589
01:16:51,209 --> 01:16:53,918
from a CNBC
colleague of mine,

1590
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,334
and it says,
"This is gonna be good."

1591
01:16:56,417 --> 01:16:58,792
-(dramatic flourish plays)
-All right, welcome back

1592
01:16:58,876 --> 01:17:01,626
to the "Halftime Report,"
live today from
the New York Stock Exchange.

1593
01:17:01,709 --> 01:17:04,459
We've been speaking with
hedge fund investor Bill Ackman.

1594
01:17:04,542 --> 01:17:07,083
Now it's time to hear
what Carl Icahn thinks
of our conversation.

1595
01:17:07,167 --> 01:17:09,792
He joins us live on the phone.
Carl, are you there,
Bill, there?

1596
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:12,375
-Carl:<i> Okay,</i>
<i>good to talk to you.</i>
-Ackman:<i> I am here as well.</i>

1597
01:17:12,459 --> 01:17:14,375
Wapner: You know, Carl,
you have an issue with the way

1598
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:17,209
that Bill went about
the Herbalife short

1599
01:17:17,292 --> 01:17:19,792
as aggressive and as
publicly as he did,

1600
01:17:19,876 --> 01:17:22,667
and he's essentially saying
that you're a hypocrite.

1601
01:17:22,751 --> 01:17:23,876
How do you respond?

1602
01:17:23,959 --> 01:17:26,167
Carl:<i> Let's start</i>
<i>with what I want to say.</i>

1603
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:28,626
<i>I've really sort of had it
with this guy Ackman,</i>

1604
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:32,834
<i>'cause Herbalife is a classic
example of what he does.</i>

1605
01:17:32,918 --> 01:17:34,459
<i>You scare the hell
out of people,</i>

1606
01:17:34,542 --> 01:17:35,834
<i>get the stock down</i>

1607
01:17:35,918 --> 01:17:38,292
<i>and make 600 million bucks
on paper</i>

1608
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:40,250
<i>and tells the world
how great he is.</i>

1609
01:17:40,334 --> 01:17:41,626
<i>I had dinner with him.</i>

1610
01:17:41,709 --> 01:17:43,292
<i>I couldn't figure out
if he was</i>

1611
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:45,584
<i>the most sanctimonious guy
I ever met in my life</i>

1612
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:47,334
<i>or the most arrogant.</i>

1613
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:49,751
And I'd like to give Bill
a chance to respond
to you as well.

1614
01:17:49,834 --> 01:17:52,500
Ackman:
<i>Carl has been-- is gonna try</i>
<i>to attack my integrity.</i>

1615
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:55,167
<i>And Herbalife,
we're not scaring people</i>

1616
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:56,959
<i>but going through the facts
about the company--</i>

1617
01:17:57,042 --> 01:17:58,834
Carl:
<i>If that wasn't scaring people,</i>
<i>you could have fooled me.</i>

1618
01:17:58,918 --> 01:18:00,334
Ackman:
<i>And we will either</i>
<i>be proven right,</i>

1619
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:01,751
<i>or we'll be proven wrong.</i>

1620
01:18:01,834 --> 01:18:03,751
There had never been
quite a showdown

1621
01:18:03,834 --> 01:18:05,417
between two people
of such high stature

1622
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,083
as Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman
on live TV.

1623
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:10,918
Carl:
<i>Then he talks about charity,</i>
<i>that's complete (bleep).</i>

1624
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,751
<i>He's not giving it to charity,</i>

1625
01:18:12,834 --> 01:18:15,042
<i>assuming they don't need
charity themselves.</i>

1626
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:17,250
-Let me do this, I mean...
Carl.

1627
01:18:17,334 --> 01:18:19,542
Carl:<i> Now, that's what</i>
<i>I'll say about Ackman, okay?</i>

1628
01:18:19,626 --> 01:18:21,751
Let me remind you that
we are on live television.

1629
01:18:21,834 --> 01:18:24,334
We're doing the show that day
at the stock exchange,

1630
01:18:24,417 --> 01:18:25,918
and it's on a delay.

1631
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,042
So each time Carl would say
something nasty about Bill,

1632
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:33,083
two seconds later
you would hear all the traders
on the trading floor...

1633
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:35,626
Carl:
<i>He's the quintessential</i>
<i>example on Wall Street,</i>

1634
01:18:35,709 --> 01:18:37,500
<i>if you want a friend,
get a dog.</i>

1635
01:18:37,584 --> 01:18:40,417
-traders: Ohh!
-Carl:<i> And he does</i>
<i>a pump-and-dump...</i>

1636
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:41,876
Wapner: Uh, the guys
on the trading floor

1637
01:18:41,959 --> 01:18:43,459
down here at
the New York stock exchange...

1638
01:18:43,542 --> 01:18:47,042
Same thing when Bill would,
you know, insult Carl,

1639

1657
01:19:43,334 --> 01:19:45,792

Ackman:<i> Simply said to him,</i>
<i>I said, "Look, Carl,</i>

Herbalife played out
for a number of years,

1673
01:20:24,918 --> 01:20:27,792
but it was really a foregone
conclusion from that moment,

1674
01:20:27,876 --> 01:20:30,209
because once Carl emerged,

1675
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:31,834
Bill didn't really have
a chance.

1676
01:20:31,918 --> 01:20:33,918
Just as the markets are falling,

1677
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,751
Herbalife is hitting
an all-time high today.

1678
01:20:36,834 --> 01:20:38,918
Carl wasn't going
to go anywhere.

1679
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:41,542
And Wall Street
was betting with Carl.

1680
01:20:41,626 --> 01:20:43,709
(trance music playing)

1681
01:20:46,459 --> 01:20:48,751
Herbalife is officially

1682
01:20:48,834 --> 01:20:51,751
the worst investment ever made
by Pershing Square.

1683
01:20:56,459 --> 01:21:00,417
Bill lost the majority of
his investment in Herbalife.

1684
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,167
It was a billion-dollar short.

1685
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:04,542
And eventually Bill
just threw in the towel,

1686
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:08,250
and Icahn, he won.

1687
01:21:11,626 --> 01:21:12,792
It obviously felt good.

1688
01:21:12,876 --> 01:21:14,459
It felt good that I beat him.

1689
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:19,083
We did have a vendetta, and I
felt he had screwed me once,

1690
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:21,125
so it felt good to do it.

1691

1692
01:21:24,459 --> 01:21:26,834
and at the end
of this whole thing,

1693
01:21:26,918 --> 01:21:30,834
he called me up and
congratulated me on the victory.

1694
01:21:30,918 --> 01:21:34,167
And I think it was
a classy thing to do.

1695

But the winning, that's not
the motivation for me.
