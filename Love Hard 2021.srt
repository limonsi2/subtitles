[woman] It's been said that,
according to Greek mythology,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,791
humans were originally created
with four arms, four legs,

13
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,583
and a head with two faces.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,500
But fearing their power,
Zeus split them into two separate parts,

to spend the rest of their lives

00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,875
But on a positive note,

36
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:56,333
I've turned my horrible love life
into a successful online writing career.

37
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,541
For years,
I've been chronicling my disaster dates

under the pseudonym "Always a Bridesmaid."

39
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:05,208
And people seem to love
that I can't find love.

40
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:09,541
But honestly, I'm not sure
how much longer I can do this.

41
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:13,041
How is it that everyone
has found the one, and I haven't?

42
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,458
Either I'm the unluckiest woman
in the world,

or my picker is broken.

It's both.

45
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,916
What's the one common denominator
in all of these dates?

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,833
It's you.

47
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,833
I beg your pardon?

48
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,958
The common denominator
is that it's a bunch of LA assholes.

00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,416
That's your other problem.
You're only looking local.

I had to import Mark from Ohio,
for God's sakes.

your dating radius set to five miles.

You gotta look outside West Hollywood.

Gas is so expensive.

55

I mean, it'd be 40 bucks to get
to Glendale, and that's only one way.

56
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,083
It's cheaper to do cocaine
and then run everywhere.

I'm assuming your next date is lined up.

64
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,833
I was thinking for the next one,
maybe we'll try something different. Like…

65
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,666
Something a little bit more upbeat?

66
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,500
Why the hell would you do that?

67
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,208
So I don't spend another evening

68

So how do you really feel about
my favorite Christmas movie?

[Natalie] It's a movie about people
falling in love based on how they look.

[Josh] I like to think it's a story
about the triumph of love over reality.

would literally kill her.

So just as an experiment,

610
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:17,625
I thought I could use a picture
of a standard hot guy

00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:21,000

of girls out there.

that first caught your eye?

unbelievable things in his profile.

that unique physique.

Oh no, it's true.

that ensnared me.

besides hunt and pay for everything, okay?

824

Plus, I see this more
as a business than a hobby.

825
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:52,625
-All right.
-Wait, hey, hey, whoa, whoa!

-Let's see what you got. [grunts]

827
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:55,916
[straining] Okay.

828
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,333
Oh.

829
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:02,458
You see, candles
are solely marketed to women.

830
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:05,000
They all smell like flowers and candy

831
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:08,833
with names like "Sweet Caresses"
or "Shooting Star."

832
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:11,333
No self-respecting man's gonna buy those,

833
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:13,958
even if his apartment
smells like bong water.

834
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:18,916
So, I created my own line
of masculine candles

835
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,250

00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:43,625
[whispering] Come on.
Everybody's looking at us.

1162
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,291
-Say yes!
-Yes! Yes!

1163
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:49,000
[Josh whispering] Everyone's looking.
Just say yes.

1164
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:51,166
We're not getting any younger, dear.

1165
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:53,583
Yes.

1166
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:55,041
-[all cheering]
-She said yes!

1167
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:56,625
[Bob] Oh my God!

1168
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:01,458
-Oh my God.
-[Barb] Oh my goodness!

1169
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:03,083
Oh, it fits perfect!

1170
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:04,541
-[Bob] Oh!
-Oh!

1171
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:09,041
You're making me the happiest boy--
We're the happiest family in town!

1172
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:11,833
-[Barb] Welcome to the family, Natalie.
-[Josh] Oh, thank you, Grandma.

1173
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:14,291
-Oh!
-[Owen] It's crazy!

1174
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:17,125
[Josh] I'm the happiest man in town.
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

1175
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,291
-[door closes]
-Okay. I… I know you're mad,

1176
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:22,916
but you told me to stand up for myself,
and… and it worked!

1177
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,708
I told you to stand up,
not get down on one knee!

1178
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:27,833
This was not part of the plan.

1179
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:29,875
I'm… I'm sorry.
I got carried away in the moment.

1180
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:32,458
But if you think about it,
nothing's changed.

1181
00:56:32,541 --> 00:56:34,166
Nothing's changed?

1182
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,958
Your grandma gave me her ring

1183
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:37,541
[shouting] off of her finger!

1184
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:39,458
Still, we just gotta
make it through Christmas.

1185
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:42,166
When you get back to LA,
I just tell them we didn't work out.

1186
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:45,833
And then I look like the asshole?
Your family is gonna be crushed.

1187
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,500
Don't worry. They're very used
to me disappointing them.

1188
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:51,208
What about Tag?
I have a date with him tomorrow.

1189
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:53,375
What if he finds out
I'm engaged to my cousin?

1190
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:56,166
He won't. I promise you that. Okay?

1191
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,916
Everything will be fine. Just trust me.

1192
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,666
Tr… trust you? [scoffs]

1193
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,708
That is literally
the one thing that I cannot do!

1194
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,500
[Natalie] I even wore this stupid hat!

1195
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,083
You wanted me to wear a hat.
You're like, "It's cute." It's dumb!

1196
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:12,666
[door opens] Now I'm apparently
getting married! [door slams]

1197
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:15,041
-[sighs deeply]
-[Owen] I don't know about this Natalie.

1198
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:17,875
If she wants to be in our family,
I need to know who she is.

1199
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:18,833
And I've been,

1200
00:57:18,916 --> 00:57:22,000
[chuckles] I've been searching
for like an hour and nothing.

1201
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,458
[clicks tongue] Not being Google-able
is the modern equivalent

1202
00:57:25,541 --> 00:57:28,125
of driving a white,
windowless van by a playground.

1203
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:31,416
I went to prom in a white windowless van.

1204
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:33,166
Huh?

1205
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:35,625
I think you should just let it go.

1206
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:39,083
I mean, she's not that bad,
and Josh seems really into her.

1207
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:43,791
Chels, the baby barely has a heartbeat,
let alone ears.

1208
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:46,291
Music prevents stretch marks, Owen.

1209
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:47,708
[Kerry] Let me get this straight.

1210
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:51,041
You're dating the real Tag,
and you're engaged to the fake Tag?

1211
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:51,958
Correct.

1212
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:54,958
My God, honey, you are gonna make
a therapist very wealthy one day.

1213
00:57:55,041 --> 00:57:56,666
[Natalie] This isn't funny, Ker!

1214
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,541
I am so screwed!

1215
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:01,000
[Kerry] All you have to do
is make sure Tag and the Lins

1216
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:03,541
don't find out anything before Christmas,
and you're golden.

1217
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:05,416
Just sit back, enjoy it.

1218
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,875
[Natalie] I don't know, Ker.

1219
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:09,208
I feel like this
is gonna blow up in my face.

1220
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:11,541
[Kerry] Honey, sometimes blow-ups
can be a good thing.

1221
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:13,666
You might not always
get the ending you want,

1222
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,416
but you'll get the ending you need.

1223
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,666
-Worst case, you get a free diamond ring.
-[call waiting beeps]

1224
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:23,583
Oh. Hey… hey, Nat. Sweetie, I love you,
but I gotta go. My sponsor's calling.

1225
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,500
Bye, sweetie. Love you.

1226
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:26,416
Hey.

1227
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:28,458
Kerry?

1228
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:30,958
[scoffs]

1229
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:33,708
[shivering]

1230
00:58:34,958 --> 00:58:36,000
[Bob grunts]

1231
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:39,458
Is everything okay?

1232
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:44,083
Oh, uh, Natalie,
can you please hand me my… my wrench?

1233
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:45,916
[clicks tongue] Uh, yeah.

1234
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:47,833
-Here.
-[Bob] Thanks.

1235
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,166
No problem.

1236
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:51,500
[grunts] Got it.

1237
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:53,333
Whew.

1238
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:56,208
Damn flue always gets stuck.

1239
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:57,958
[Bob exhales]

1240
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:01,625
Oh, would you like
to help me with kindling?

1241
00:59:02,416 --> 00:59:03,250
Sure.

1242
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,333
[Bob grunts]

1243
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:15,291
Just roll it lightly and scrunch.

1244
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:16,958
[Bob chuckles]

1245
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:21,041
Yeah, my dad didn't set fires unless
there was an insurance claim involved.

1246
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,208
Who's that?

1247
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:24,875
Oh.

1248
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:27,041
Oh, that's my dad.

1249
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,708
Yeah. He passed a few years ago.

1250
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:30,916
Oh, I'm…

1251
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:33,125
-[Bob] Oh.
-I'm sorry.

1252
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:37,333
You know,
that man loved two things in this world,

1253
00:59:37,416 --> 00:59:39,708
his family and Christmas.

1254
00:59:39,791 --> 00:59:43,166
He used to climb up on the roof
every Christmas Eve and stomp around

1255
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,291
so the boys knew Santa had arrived.

1256
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:47,791
-He fell off one year and broke his arm.
-[gasps]

1257
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:52,208
But he told the boys he broke it,
protecting their presents from the Grinch.

1258
00:59:52,291 --> 00:59:53,750
[both laugh]

1259
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:58,166
He sounds like a great guy.

1260
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,125
Yeah.

1261
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:01,666
Hey, listen, um…

1262
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:03,541
I just wanted you to know that

1263
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:08,000
we're really happy
to have you joining the family.

1264
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:13,791
[exhales deeply]

1265
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,833
Okay. Well, enough of that. [chuckles]

1266
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:19,875
Ready to give this bad boy a go?

1267
01:00:20,666 --> 01:00:21,500
Sure.

1268
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:22,708
[Bob chuckles]

1269
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:27,625
Oh. Okay. All right.

1270
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,083
[birds squawking]

1271
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:32,000
[Natalie] This is the most beautiful hike
I've ever been on.

1272
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,458
[Tag] I'm glad you like it.

1273
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:36,875
I used to come here every day
with my golden retriever, Chewy.

1274
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:38,666
He passed away last year, actually.

1275
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,000
-I miss him every day.
-Mm.

1276
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:43,166
He would've liked this hike a lot…

1277
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,125
Mm.

1278
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:46,625
…and you.

1279
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:54,958
[chuckles]

1280
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:58,916
This has been nice.
I haven't been on a hike date in years.

1281
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,833
Oh, this is not the date.
It's just a warm-up.

1282
01:01:03,041 --> 01:01:05,875
-You ever been bobsledding before?
-[rumbling]

1283
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:09,000
I'm not good at this kind of stuff, Josh.

1284
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,333
Okay. You just have to relax.

1285
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:15,416
Relax? I can't relax. The tension
is the only thing holding me together.

1286
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,041
Put in your AirPods,
and put on some music.

1287
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:20,041
I don't know if I have them.

1288
01:01:22,291 --> 01:01:25,708
Actually, I think I have
something even better.

1289
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:30,958
Oh, um, E-Rock says "pass the dutch."

1290
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:32,291
E-Rock?

1291
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:34,666
When did he get out of jail?

1292
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:37,458
[Tag whooping]

1293
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,333
[screaming] Yeah!

1294
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:43,458
[continues whooping]

1295
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:46,083
How are you feeling back there, Natalie?

1296
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:48,291
[Natalie spacey] Flying high back here.

1297
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:51,416
[Tag whooping]

1298
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:54,750
[door closes]

1299
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:57,375
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Natalie humming]

1300
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:00,041
[Natalie sighs happily]

1301
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:02,250
[scoffs] Glad you're not dead.

1302
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:05,125
Oh! I've never felt more alive!

1303
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:09,958
Not only did Tag ask me to dinner
tomorrow night,

1304
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:14,125
but I'm pretty sure I qualified for
the winter Olympics in Beijing. [chuckles]

1305
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:15,750
Oh!

1306
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:17,333
[squeals]

1307
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:18,958
For the first time,

1308
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:21,791
I met someone who's as perfect in person

1309
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:25,166
as they are on paper. [chuckles, moans]

1310
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:28,791
I hate to break it to you, but Tag
is actually far from being perfect.

1311
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:32,458
In first grade, he had a lazy eye
and needed to wear an eye patch.

1312
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:35,125
[scoffs] Why are you being all weird?

1313
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:38,416
I'm just trying to point out
that in some cultures,

1314
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,458
height and facial symmetry are repulsive.

1315
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:45,708
[smacks lips] It's a good thing
I'm not part of those cultures.

1316
01:02:45,791 --> 01:02:47,500
Whatcha doin' over here?

1317
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:49,541
Just mixing some new scents.

1318
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:51,166
[sniffing] Mmm.

1319
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:54,000
Smells like freshly cut grass.

1320
01:02:54,583 --> 01:02:57,458
-Well, that one's called Lawn Mower.
-[Natalie] Mm.

1321
01:02:58,125 --> 01:02:59,541
[inhales deeply]

1322
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:04,208
Mmm.

1323
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:05,416
Getting a feeling.

1324
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,833
Bear with me. Um… [sniffs]

1325
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:12,416
It's like a-- You know those [chuckles]
blue-collar mechanics guys

1326
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:16,083
with the tight shirts,
that put in a hard day's work?

1327
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:17,875

-How… how… are you here?

1662
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:56,208
Duh, first class, honey.
I'm not a peasant.

1663
01:20:56,291 --> 01:20:57,500
No, I… I mean, um--

1664
01:20:57,583 --> 01:21:00,416
Listen, you're not the only one
that can stalk people on the internet.

1665
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:05,000
I found out about this little soirée
courtesy of Barb's Facebook page. Hello!

1666
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:07,500
[breathing heavily]

1667
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:10,583
Hey, how's it going?

1668
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,208
So, Tag and Lee are here.

1669
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:16,458
-Lee? Are you dating two guys now?
-No, he's my boss.

1670
01:21:16,541 --> 01:21:18,250
What? Why is he here?

1671
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:19,583
Because God hates me.

1672
01:21:21,583 --> 01:21:23,083
Glenlivet 12, neat.

1673
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,666
That's a man who knows how to drink.

1674
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:29,791
Just act natural. We'll figure a way out.
We just got to stick together. Okay?

1675
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:32,750
Hey, babe.
I want to introduce you to my parents.

1676
01:21:32,833 --> 01:21:33,833
I'm out.

1677
01:21:33,916 --> 01:21:35,458
What brings you here?

1678
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:36,875
I'm Natalie's boss.

1679
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:39,666
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1680
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:41,166
Tell me more.

1681
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:43,416
Mom, Dad, this is Natalie.

1682
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,416
-Hello.
-Hi.

1683
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,208
-Hi.
-Tag's told us so much about you.

1684
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:48,666
He never says anything
about his girlfriends, so…

1685
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:49,833
Dad, come on.

1686
01:21:49,916 --> 01:21:52,958
Girlfriend. Wow.
It's… it's so, so nice to meet you.

1687
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:56,166
[breathlessly] I think I'm just gonna
go use the ladies' room.

1688
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:59,291
Hey, not so fast. We need to talk.

1689
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:02,333
-I'm kind of busy, Owen.
-Oh, talking to your lover, Tag?

1690
01:22:02,416 --> 01:22:06,416
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw you two
here last night looking pretty damn cozy.

1691
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,875
Okay, it's not… it's not what you think.

1692
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:11,708
Ah, that's funny,
because I didn't know what to think

1693
01:22:11,791 --> 01:22:14,083
until I spoke to your boss
a few seconds ago,

1694
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:15,916
and now it all makes sense.

1695
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,458
Okay, look, I… I can explain.

1696
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:19,041
-So the thing is--
-La-la-la-la…

1697
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:23,166
I don't want to hear it. I just want you
to stop this charade with my brother.

1698
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,333
Two glasses of Veuve, please.

1699
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:29,916
-Tag, [burps] what's going on, bro?
-What's up, E?

1700
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,291
Can you believe
that J-Dog is getting married?

1701
01:22:32,375 --> 01:22:34,666
-Chick's pretty cool too.
-I haven't met her yet.

1702
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:35,958
Well, she's right there.

1703
01:22:36,458 --> 01:22:37,833
Dude, that's his cousin.

1704
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:41,541
I don't judge. You love who you love.

1705
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:42,500
No. You know wh--

1706
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,541
Why should I believe
what comes out of your mouth?

1707
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:46,916
-Are you serious--
-Hey! Everything okay here?

1708
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,041
-No!
-Yes.

1709
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,083
Natalie, she didn't come to New York
for love. She came here for a story.

1710
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:55,083
She's been playing you since day one, bro.

1711
01:22:55,166 --> 01:22:58,666
She's a writer for a Disaster Date column,
and you're not her fiancé.

1712
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,166
You are her subject.

1713
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:02,375
-Don't--
-Wait. What? Nat.

1714
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:03,625
What is he talking about?

1715
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:07,666
[Bob] Could I have everyone's attention?

1716
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:09,000
[sighs]

1717
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:12,458
I'm not one for speeches,
so I'll keep this quick.

1718
01:23:13,083 --> 01:23:13,916
Uh…

1719
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:15,458
Josh.

1720
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:19,666
I know we haven't always seen
eye-to-eye on things,

1721
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:22,333
but you're a good kid with a big heart,

1722
01:23:22,416 --> 01:23:27,708
and after spending, uh, the last week
with your beautiful bride-to-be,

1723
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,958
I think the whole family agrees
that you've picked a winner!

1724
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:34,083
I couldn't be happier for you, son.

1725
01:23:34,166 --> 01:23:37,958
So let's all raise a glass
to future Mr. and Mrs. Lin,

1726
01:23:38,041 --> 01:23:39,833
-Josh and--
-No!

1727
01:23:43,541 --> 01:23:45,000
Not yet. Um…

1728
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:46,208
Uh…

1729
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:50,250
[Natalie] We can't cheers
before all the speeches are done.

1730
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:55,958
I mean, I'd like to add
to your beautiful, beautiful speech

1731
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:59,166
with my own speech.

1732
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:01,250
A speech sequel, per se,

1733
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:06,166
about, um, love, and, uh, Josh,

1734
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,166
and…

1735
01:24:09,166 --> 01:24:10,833
[breathing heavily]

1736
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:13,250
-[man] And?
-[crowd murmuring]

1737
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:16,375
…dishonesty.

1738
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:19,458
Because that's what I've been,

1739
01:24:20,416 --> 01:24:21,333
dishonest

1740
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:25,041
with Josh, and the Lins,

1741
01:24:25,708 --> 01:24:26,875
Tag,

1742
01:24:26,958 --> 01:24:28,125
everyone, really. I--

1743
01:24:29,083 --> 01:24:29,916
[Natalie sighs]

1744
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:32,875
[whispers] Here it goes.

1745
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:35,916
[inhales] Four weeks ago,
I met a guy online.

1746
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:40,916
He was smart, funny, sweet,
and he looked like him.

1747
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:45,458
So, I decided to come here
and surprise him for Christmas.

1748
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:48,958
But when I got here,
I realized that the guy

1749
01:24:49,041 --> 01:24:51,708
I was really talking to was him.

1750
01:24:53,416 --> 01:24:54,541
I got catfished,

1751
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:56,458
and I was furious.

1752
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:01,208
But Josh told me
that he would help get me Tag

1753
01:25:01,291 --> 01:25:04,166
if I pretended to be his girlfriend
for the holidays.

1754
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:05,458
And I honestly just--

1755
01:25:05,541 --> 01:25:08,625
I… I thought
that my perfect match was here,

1756
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:11,916
so I agreed, and I pretended
to be someone that I'm not, but…

1757
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:15,083
[exhales] I just wanted my happy ending.

1758
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:17,750
[scoffs]

1759
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:21,083
[Natalie] But I can't do it anymore.
I… I… I can't lie.

1760
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:22,916
I just can't, I'm sorry. I…

1761
01:25:25,166 --> 01:25:26,583
I'm so sorry.

1762
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:32,416
Do you even climb?

1763
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:35,708
What about Thoreau?

1764
01:25:36,708 --> 01:25:37,750
I hate him.

1765
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,458
Bobsledding?

1766
01:25:40,041 --> 01:25:42,416
I literally had to get stoned
to get through it.

1767
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,333
[chuckles] Yeah. Now, that's my girl.

1768
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:51,083
[Tag] Okay, so… so you got mad at Josh
for catfishing you,

1769
01:25:51,166 --> 01:25:53,625
and then you go
and do the exact same thing to me.

1770
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:55,958
[breath trembling]

1771
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:01,000
Congratulations.

1772
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:06,708
And… and by the way,

1773
01:26:07,291 --> 01:26:09,541
Die Hard is not a Christmas movie.

1774
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:10,958
-[gasps]
-[Tag] Yeah.

1775

[door opens]

1777
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:20,458
Okay, all right, show's over.
Nothing to see here, all right?

1778
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:21,625
Okay? All right?

1779
01:26:23,166 --> 01:26:25,875
All right. Time to go home.
Stop looking at my brother.
