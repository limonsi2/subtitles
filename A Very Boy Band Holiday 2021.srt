703
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,294
Say, for instance,
people on a football team.

704
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,628
They know exactly
the same thing, like,

705
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,964
what they feel when they're
out there on the field.

706
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,716
Same thing with us
when we're on stage.

707
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:58,093
But this ‐‐ I think
this is even deeper than that,

708
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,554
because on a football team,
you can get traded.

709
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,306
Yeah, that's true.
This is something that ‐‐

710

You just got traded.

We traded Drew
to you guys.

‐There you go.
‐No more dancing.

No more dancing
for you, bud.

you know, you were lucky ‐‐

with your brother, right?

Well, I'm saying,
I didn't have any brothers.

I had all sisters

at all.

what are you doing, man?

1043
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,742
Nick really wanted me
to hang our childhood stockings

1044
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:55,203
so he could feel
like he was really here.

1045
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,288
Did your mom make those?

1046
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,290
You know, moms don't have
the same amount of time

1047
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,085
when the second kid comes.

1048
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,628
Does it work?

1049
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:04,963
Is it too pathetic?

1050
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,422
Alright.
[ Laughs ]

1051
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,549
Hold on!
I got a better one in me!

1052
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,593
Wait. You don't know what
a Boy Band Holiday is?

1053
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,552
Shawn, you want
to sing the song?

1054
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,845
Let's start it.
No.

1055
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,347
Well, his name's Wanyá.

1056
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,766
I've always
been Wanyá.

1057
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:17,809
Wow.

1058
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,185
Lookee here.

1059
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,937
It is snowing.

1060
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,149
[ Laughter ]

1061
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,693
We live in Philly, man.
We from Philly.

1062
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:29,112
Like,
we've seen it before.

1063
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,655
[ Laughs ]

1064
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,156
Merry Christmas
and happy holidays!

[ Laughter ]

1067
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:37,829
Chris just got kicked
in the head.

1068
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:38,871
I didn't take too long,
did I?

1069
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,164
Yes, you did.
Alright, I'm sorry.

1070
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,083
Prime time, let's go.

1071
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,961
Oh.
Did I forget to call you?

1072
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,755
Were the Backstreet Boys
even a boy band?

1073
