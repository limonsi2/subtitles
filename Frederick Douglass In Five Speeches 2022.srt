we once entertained

1041
00:51:47,792 --> 00:51:49,709
for the cause
of American liberty.

1042
00:51:49,792 --> 00:51:53,834
Principles, which we all thought
to have been permanently settled

1043
00:51:53,918 --> 00:51:57,083
by the late war,
have been boldly assaulted

1044
00:51:57,167 --> 00:52:00,125
and overthrown
by the defeated party.

1045
00:52:00,209 --> 00:52:02,751
When the moral sense
of a nation begins to decline

1046
00:52:02,834 --> 00:52:04,876
and the wheel of progress
to roll backward,

1047
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:07,500
there's no telling
how low one will fall

1048
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:10,584
or where the other may stop.

1049
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:13,792
I have waited patiently,
but anxiously,

1050
00:52:13,876 --> 00:52:17,375
to see the end of the epidemic
of mob law and persecution

1051
00:52:17,459 --> 00:52:19,125
now prevailing in the South.

1052
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:21,667
Our newspapers
are daily disfigured

1053
00:52:21,751 --> 00:52:24,209
by its ghastly horrors.

1054
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:26,918
It's commonly thought
that only the lowest

1055
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,083
and most disgusting birds
and beasts such as buzzards,

1056
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:32,125
vultures, and hyenas

1057
00:52:32,209 --> 00:52:35,167
will gloat over
and prey upon dead bodies.

1058
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,667
But the Southern mob,
in its rage,

1059
00:52:37,751 --> 00:52:40,209
feeds its vengeance by shooting,

1060
00:52:40,292 --> 00:52:42,500
stabbing, and burning

1061
00:52:42,584 --> 00:52:44,751
when their victims are dead.

1062
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:49,584
Their institutions have taught
them no respect for human life,

1063
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,459
and especially
the life of a Negro.

1064
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:59,083
But, my friends, I must stop.

1065
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:02,876
Time and strength are not equal
to the task before me.

1066
00:53:04,542 --> 00:53:07,626
But could I be heard
by this great nation,

1067
00:53:07,709 --> 00:53:10,918
I would call to mind the sublime
and glorious truths

1068
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,792
with which, at its birth,
it saluted a listening world.

1069
00:53:14,876 --> 00:53:17,209
It announced the advent
of a nation

1070
00:53:17,292 --> 00:53:19,792
based upon human brotherhood

1071
00:53:19,876 --> 00:53:24,167
and the self-evident truths
of liberty and equality.

1072
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:27,500
Apply these sublime
and glorious truths

1073
00:53:27,584 --> 00:53:30,334
to the situation now before you.

1074
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:31,792
Put away your prejudice.

1075
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:35,292
Banish the idea that one class
must rule over another.

1076
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:38,292
Recognize the fact that the
rights of the humblest citizen

1077
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:42,125
are as worthy of protection
as are those of the highest,

1078
00:53:42,209 --> 00:53:45,209
and your problem will be solved.

1079
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:47,959

without or foes within,

peace or war,

1083

1084
00:53:58,918 --> 00:54:02,083
of truth, justice, and humanity,

1085
00:54:02,876 --> 00:54:05,500
your Republic will stand
