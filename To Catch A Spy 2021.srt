5
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,433
It's Normand.
I am almost there.

6
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,333
He's in view. We've got him!

7
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:26,600
He's gone.

8
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:31,834
No, I'm sorry, he--
he didn't make it.

9
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,834
We will keep the documents safe
until you decide what to do.

10
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:38,200
The documents
are in a lockbox.

11
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:53,734
We are going to Malta!
We are going to Malta!

12
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:55,066
Good morning, Sara.

13
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,633
How are you even awake
right now?

14
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:59,033
You literally just got back
from Iceland.

15
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,600
And did you even have time
to pack a bag?

16
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:02,266
Barely.

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,700
My poor body doesn't know what
time zone it is.

18
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,633
I think I have travel
writer's whiplash.

19
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:09,934
Oh! You travel to amazing places
and get paid for it.

20
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:11,367
No one feels bad for you.

21
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,900
- You're right.

22
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,467
Plus I'm really excited to see
my friend Elias.

23
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,867
I haven't seen him since
college.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,266
Aw!

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,800
He's going to love you
and Patrick.

26
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:20,500
And... Tom.

27
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,200
And Tom.

28
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,433
Are you sure you're okay
that Tom's coming with us.

29
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:27,033
Of course!

30
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,433
This is his first issue as
editor, he has to come.

31
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,967
We're fine.
We're... professionals.

32
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,567
- Uh-huh.
- I'm sorry, Patrick,

33
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,233
but you're gonna have to explain
that to me again.

34
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:36,867
Which part?

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,200
The part about how a new app is
gonna help the magazine.

36
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,100
Tom, that's the whole part.
Sara, can you--

37
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:43,900
Oh, no, no, no.
I am the photographer.

38
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,633
If it can't be explained with
a pretty picture, I'm out.

39
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,533
Chloe?

40
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,133
We're going to be on planes,
trains and automobiles

41
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:50,900
for the next 19 hours,

42
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:52,433
so we'll have plenty of time
to talk about it then.

43
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:54,233
I need everyone
on their A game.

44
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:55,934
We've got tours,
restaurants, museums.

45
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:57,734
- The hotel spa.

46
00:02:57,867 --> 00:03:01,433
Elias did put did put in a spa
when he built the hotel, right?

47
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,967
Okay, his dad renovated
the hotel,

48
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,767
and they already pulled
a lot of strings

49
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,367
to get us on
the press junket,

50
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,166
so we're not hitting
him up for spa passes, too.

51
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,367
We work for one of the best
travel magazines in the world.

52
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,100
Why do we even need
strings pulled?

53
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:14,967
Because, Sara, everyone reads
about travel

54
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,600
on their phones now.

55
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:18,533
Hence the need
for a better app!

56
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,166
- 18 hours of this?

57
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,967
Great. See you at
the elevators in five.

58
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,333
Yes!

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,967
I never understood why you read
those mysteries.

60
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,033
You always figure out who did it
before you get to the end.

61
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,867
That's why I like to read them,
I like being right.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,467
Chloe... are we okay?

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,700
We're fine.

64
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:40,934
Strictly professional.

65
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:42,300
Right.

66
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,667
Did I mention we're going
to Malta?

67
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,467
Shut down as much of the area
as possible!

68
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,667
Go! Go!

69
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:23,100
Chloe!

70
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,166
Elias!

71
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,500
It's so good to see you!

72
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:29,367
Chloe, you look exactly the same
as you did

73
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,533
at our last class reunion.

74
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:32,867
- How?
- Stop.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,433
You're looking great too.

76
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,600
Congratulations on the hotel,
it's beautiful.

77
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,200
Thanks.
It's getting there.

78
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,333
This is just a soft opening with
the press

79
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:42,367
so there are still a few things
left to do.

80
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,734
But if you see anything that
doesn't work,

81
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,200
it's off the record.

82
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,066
Come on, you know me,
my lips are sealed.

83
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,333
Elias, this is Tom McBride,
our editor.

84
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:53,533
- Sara Webb, our photographer.
- Hi.

85
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,934
And Patrick Schaeffer who does
our digital content.

86
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:57,867
Everybody,
this is Elias Lentini.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,367
- Hey.
- Hi.

88
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,100
It's nice to meet all of you.
Seeing the hotel

89
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,066
in Destination Traveler is a big
deal for my folks.

90
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,633
They love your magazine.

91
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,166
You must be exhausted,

92
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,667
so why don't you go get checked
in get some rest.

93
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,066
I'll show you around tomorrow,

94
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,000
and if you need anything
I'm in 608.

95
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:14,066
Wait, you're at
the hotel too?

96
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,800
Just until the grand opening
next week.

97
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,433
Well, we should get
breakfast tomorrow.

98
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,000
- Yeah!

99
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:20,900
Oh, thank you for
everything, Elias.

100
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:22,233
Welcome to--

101
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:23,600
- Malta!

102
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:26,600
- - Thank you.
- - Thank you.

103
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:29,000
Hello, welcome
to the Hotel Optima.

104
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,467
Thank you.

105
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,967
We're with Destination
Traveler Magazine.

106
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,266
I'm Bree Hammond,
the manager. Welcome!

107
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,767
Please let me know if there's
anything I can do

108
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,266
to make your stay
more enjoyable.

109
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,166
- Thank you.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

110
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,500
- Mr. McBride.
- That's me.

111
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,333
- You're in room 409.
- Ah, perfect.

112
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:45,767
Ms. Day?

113
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,834
- You're in 510.
- Thank you.

114
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:50,934
- Mr. Schaeffer, you're in 301.
- Thank you.

115
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:53,667
- And Ms. Webb, 418.
- Thank you.

116
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,300
The elevator
is right over there.

117
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:56,567
Enjoy your stay.

118
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,633
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

119
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,700
Ooh, well first
and foremost,

120
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:02,800
I've heard that the local wine
is really great here.

121
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:05,066
Is anyone up for a little sample
with me right now?

122
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,633
Am I more thirsty
or jet lagged?

123
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,233
Jet lagged. Bed for me.

124
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:10,533
Yeah, me too.

125
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:11,834
I could be down for
a glass of wine.

126
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,467
Yay.

127
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,333
Well, let us now when Elias
wants to do the tour.

128
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:17,066
We should stop by
the American embassy,

129
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,667
get some local recommendations,
it's right down the street.

130
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,500
Why the embassy?

131
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:22,834
Diplomats always know the best
hole-in-the-wall restaurants.

132
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:24,066
Pro tip.

133
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,700
What can I say,
I'm good at my job.

134
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:28,000
- See you in the morning.

135
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:30,834
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, guys.

136
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,066
Aaron, it's good to see
you again.

137
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,400
I'm sorry it's under such
unpleasant circumstances.

138
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,367
Well, you know I keep asking
the FBI

139
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,734
to assign us cases with
happy endings,

140
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,400
but you know
how bureaucracy is.

141
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:43,800
How long has it been?

142
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:45,066
Few years at least.

143
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
I think it was the...
the incident

144
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,066
with the American tourist
that took a joyride

145
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,133
- on the Emir's yacht.
- Oh, yes.

146
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,467
Well, that took some finesse
to handle.

147
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,967
Ambassador Soto,
this is Luke Vasquez.

148
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,867
He is new to our team.

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,767
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
Have you been on this post long?

150
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,567
Long enough.

151
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,066
I started as a liaison for
the Army Corp of Engineers.

152
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,600
If you need to get anything done
in Malta,

153
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:10,300
Ambassador Soto is who you
talk to.

154
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:12,633
I do know how things
work here, yes.

155
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,967
Which is why you will be dealing
with me directly

156
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,734
instead of the Diplomatic
Security Services.

157
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:20,967
This matter will require a great
deal of discretion.

158
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,600
Of course, Ambassador.

159
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,533
Who knew what
was in there?

160
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:26,266
Oh, it's a long list.

161
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,533
Several people here on
our staff, embassy security,

162
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,633
and a dozen different agencies
from around the globe.

163
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:35,467
So much for top secret.

164
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,900
The documents contained the
identities of undercover agents

165
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,734
from a dozen
different countries

166
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:42,767
including the United States.

167
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,367
They were stolen last month from
a diplomatic courier

168
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,400
on their way to an international
security summit,

169
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:52,433
but retrieved here in Malta by
Normand Duclasse,

170
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:55,033
who was with French
intelligence.

171
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,400
The agent who died bringing
the documents to the embassy?

172
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,633
Yes, now, because of
the incident,

173
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:02,533
the summit was postponed

174
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:06,333
and instead of risking another
courier, it was decided

175
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:08,800
to keep the documents here
for safekeeping,

176
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:12,367
which worked well,
until last night.

177
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,200
If fallen into the wrong hands,
people will die.

178
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,367
Did Duclasse know who took the
documents in the first place?

179
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,033
Based on the poison used
to kill him,

180
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,667
the CIA believe
it is Cypher.

181
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,533
Cypher?

182
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:31,433
Code name for a mercenary the
CIA's been tracking for years.

183
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,633
The guy's resume reads like
a spy novel,

184
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:35,867
I mean, murder, blackmail,
trading state secrets,

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,800
the whole nine yards,
and the worst part is

186
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,433
the guy's a complete ghost.

187
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:41,100
Nobody knows what he
really looks like.

188
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:42,867
Nobody that's still alive,
that is.

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,433
If Cypher stole it
the first time,

190
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,834
it's a fair bet to assume
he's involved now.

191
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:50,633
Those documents are worth a
fortune on the black market.

192
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:52,100
And you don't know how
the thieves made it in

193
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,700
- or out of the compound?
-No.

194
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,467
The exits are covered by
security cameras

195
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,633
but nobody saw them coming
or going.

196
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,934
The only reason we knew they
were there at all

197
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:03,166
was because they tripped
an alarm on the way out.

198
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,433
You locked down the building?

199
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:05,900
The entire block.

200
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,900
The box they took has an
encrypted lock

201
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:11,667
which is programmed remotely
by the State Department.

202
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,934
Nobody here could have gotten
into it, not even me.

203
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:16,367
And it was made
from reinforced steel.

204
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,367
It weighed over
a hundred pounds,

205
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,900
so it isn't easy to move.

206
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:22,834
And who is our
local police contact?

207
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:24,500
Inspector Orsel Deguara.

208
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:27,000
She's been made aware of
what's happened.

209
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,433
But I want to be kept apprised
every step of the way.

210
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:32,233
Understood.

211
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:34,533
Gentlemen, I'm happy to continue
this conversation,

212
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,400
but you should get checked
into your hotel

213
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,900
before it gets too much later.

214
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:39,734
Sounds good.
Where are we staying?

215
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:41,767
The Hotel Optima.

216
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:48,166
- Oh!
- Oh! Sorry!

217
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,767
It was in the way.
I didn't--

218
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,500
No, no, no. I-- I should look
where I'm going. Sorry.

219
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,900
Are you American?

220
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:55,333
Yes, yes.

221
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:57,834
Ah, my name is Rianne,
by the way.

222
00:09:57,967 --> 00:09:59,100
- Rianne?
- Yes.

223
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:00,367
That's a beautiful name.

224
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,900
- Thank you.
- I'm Chloe.

225
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:04,200
If you need anything, just--
just let me know.

226
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,667
Okay, thank you.

227
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,567
Have a good day! Bye.

228
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,033
Are you okay?

229
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:26,200
Uh, yeah. I'm just having a
little trouble with the...

230
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,867
You know, whatever happened to
just a good, old-fashioned key?

231
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,100
Want me to help?

232
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:31,734
Yes.

233
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:33,100
Please.

234
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:37,367
Now, you're just showing off.

235
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,934
Sometimes I find that swiping
works better than tapping.

236
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:44,266
Ahh. I mean,
I loosened it for you.

237
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,000
- Obviously.
- Yeah.

238
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:48,033
I'm Aaron, by the way.

239
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,500
- Chloe.
- Nice to meet you.

240
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:52,700
Ah, thank you, Chloe.
I owe you one.

241
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:55,300
I'll see you around.

242
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:28,100
Bonus points for comfy mattress.

243
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:38,667
- Come in.

244
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,433
Good evening, Ms. Day.
My name is Isaac.

245
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm the room service waster.

246
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:46,934
Where would you like your
burger and French fries?

247
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,166
Uh, just right there, please.

248
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,734
And how is your stay with us?

249
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:52,166
So far, wonderful,

250
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
except I was
hearing some voices.

251
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:56,266
I think it was
coming from the vent.

252
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,233
Could it be from another room?

253
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:02,033
Possibly. There are many quirks
in a building such as this.

254
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:05,233
Thick walls, but the vents
do sometimes prevent that.

255
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:06,967
Please, if it's too loud,
just call the front desk.

256
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,800
Okay. I will.
Thank you.

257
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:11,467
Enjoy your stay with us.

258
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Bye.

259
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,467
I love jetlag.

260
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
That's not helping.

261
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,066
- "Screaming..."

262
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,333
"Glass breaking."

263
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,433
Man Thank you for
calling the Hotel Optima Malta.

264
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:14,667
All of our representatives are
currently--

265
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,834
Hello?!

266
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,066
Hello?!

267
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,800
Anybody there?!

268
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:32,667
- Hello?!

269
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,500
Hello?!
Are you okay?!

270
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:53,967
Key...
I lost my key.

271
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,433
Okay...

272
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:06,166
- I need to use your phone.
- Is everything all right?

273
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,433
I need to call the police.

274
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:08,767
I think someone
just got murdered.

275
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,533
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, sir.

276
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:13,166
We need to access the
service area behind the hotel.

277
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,834
Somebody fell or was pushed
from the room above mine.

278
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:17,166
What? When?

279
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,700
About 20 minutes ago.

280
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:20,600
We should call the police.

281
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,367
No. We did. We need to see if
the person survived the fall.

282
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,200
From the sixth floor?

283
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,867
Look, I know that this doesn't
have any weight around here,

284
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,867
but I'm with the FBI.

285
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,333
You're FBI?

286
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:33,266
Wait, wait. What?!

287
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,633
I don't understand.

288
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:39,367
No, he fell right here.

289
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,600
Ms. Day? Bongu.

290
00:14:47,734 --> 00:14:49,633
I am inspector Deguara from
the Malta Police Force.

291
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,667
Can you please tell me
what happened?

292
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,700
I heard an argument
through the air vent

293
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,333
coming from another room.

294
00:14:55,467 --> 00:14:58,500
I heard a scream, then a crash,
and I looked over

295
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:01,567
and I saw a body in the
service area behind the hotel.

296
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,834
What time did all this happen?

297
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:05,834
At...

298
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:08,667
24 a.m.
I wrote it down.

299
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,200
Have you checked
the room above mine?

300
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,433
Room 610.

301
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,033
There is no 610.

302
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,400
Directly above you
is a two-room suite, 608.

303
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:19,700
608?
That's Elias Lentini's room.

304
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:22,033
He's my friend from college.

305
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,600
He oversaw the
renovation of the hotel.

306
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:26,200
He was staying in that room,
but he checked out.

307
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,533
No, he said he was staying here
through the grand opening.

308
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,734
He was going to show us
around tomorrow.

309
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:32,834
When did he check out?

310
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:34,700
45 a/m.
We've just looked it up.

311
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:38,233
He used the automated system
through the TV in the room.

312
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,433
No. That's before
I heard the argument.

313
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,400
There must be a mistake.

314
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:44,533
We checked the room moments ago.

315
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,867
None of his personal
effects are there

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,667
and there is
no sign of a disturbance.

317
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,734
Someone fell from that room.
I saw the body!

318
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,767
There must have been blood.

319
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,367
Chloe,
they checked the area outside.

320
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,066
They didn't find anything.

321
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,000
What about security cameras?

322
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,767
Our video surveillance system
is not operational yet.

323
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,967
But it will be by the time
we open for the public.

324
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,066
Somebody moved that body!

325
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,100
My officers checked
the entire alley

326
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:13,767
and inside the hotel,

327
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,467
this floor and the basement.

328
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,133
Staff members go in and out of
that doorway all the time.

329
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:20,266
And we checked with the guests
in the rooms near 608.

330
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,133
Nobody else heard anything.

331
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:25,400
It's the middle of the night!
Obviously, they were sleeping.

332
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:30,300
Ms. Day, what were you doing
before you heard the argument?

333
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,300
I was trying to sleep, but
the jetlag was keeping me up.

334
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:39,300
Are you sure you
hadn't dozed off?

335
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,900
Maybe you dreamed it.

336
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,767
I was standing on the bed,
listening at the vent.

337
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,767
I wrote things
down in my notebook!

338
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,600
How could I have done
that if I was asleep?

339
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:49,500
Did you have anything
to drink tonight?

340
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,533
I had one glass of wine.

341
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:03,900
I didn't dream this!

342
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,900
Ms. Day, I will have my officers
canvas the area in the morning.

343
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:10,400
We'll talk to the other guests.

344
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:13,200
We will follow up on this,
but, for tonight,

345
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,967
there is nothing much
more I can do. I am sorry.

346
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,567
I think we all need
some rest now.

347
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:27,400
Can't you do something?
You're FBI.

348
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:28,967
It's outside my jurisdiction.

349
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,333
Look, I'm working
on something else

350
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,834
with Inspector Deguara.

351
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,900
I promise you,
I will not let her drop it.

352
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,834
Meantime, is there anybody
you want me to call

353
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:39,667
or somebody
that you're traveling with?

354
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,400
No. I'm...

355
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:44,367
I'm fine.
Thank you, Aaron.

356
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,867
Yeah.

357
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,066
Elias, it's Chloe.

358
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,467
I need you to call me
as soon as you get this.

359
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,233
They're saying that you
checked out of the hotel.

360
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:06,533
I really hope that's true.
Something isn't right.

361
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,467
Call me.

362
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:19,467
Mmm. This food is delicious.

363
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,734
I think I taste saffron.

364
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,667
Okay, how are you talking
about saffron

365
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,133
when you think your friend
got murdered last night?

366
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:28,300
Nobody else seems to think so.

367
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:29,333
You haven't heard from him?

368
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:31,133
No.

369
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:32,834
I called his family's
construction company;

370
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:36,333
he wasn't there.
Maybe it wasn't him.

371
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:37,867
It was his room.

372
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,133
I know, but they said
that he checked out

373
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:40,567
before I heard the argument.

374
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,333
All I know is that
someone either fell

375
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:44,900
or was pushed from that balcony.

376
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:46,533
Then what?

377
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,834
The killer rushed downstairs
and moved the body,

378
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:51,066
and then came back upstairs
and got rid of all of his stuff?

379
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,700
I know didn't dream this.

380
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:55,700
But I can't prove it,

381
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:59,667
so, until then, saffron.

382
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,767
Forensics found dirt
on the floor of the vault

383
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,266
and also by the door.

384
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,033
And the suspects tracked it in?

385
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,433
Well, if not, the ambassador
needs to have a stern talking to

386
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:12,400
with the housekeeping crew.

387
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:14,100
I've been going through
the security footage.

388
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:15,700
Some of the internal
hallways aren't covered,

389
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:17,467
but every exit is,

390
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,300
and I still don't understand
how they got out of the building

391
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:21,467
without being seen by
any of the cameras.

392
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,266
Same way they got
in the building

393
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,600
without being seen by the
cameras, I'm guessing.

394
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:28,100
Maybe it was the infamous
Cypher living up to his name?

395
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,066
Even he can't walk
through walls.

396
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,400
I want you to keep on forensics,

397
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:39,567
make sure that we get those
results as soon as possible.

398
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,533
Hey, thank you so much.

399
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:43,400
Thank you.

400
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,233
- Thank you.
- Hey, Chloe.

401
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:47,533
Hey. Uh...
How you feeling today?

402
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,433
Okay.
Still a little freaked out.

403
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:52,233
That's totally understandable.

404
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:54,767
Chloe Day, this is
Luke Vasquez, my partner.

405
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,033
Chloe, the one who thinks--

406
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,867
Yes, that would be me.

407
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,066
I'm gonna speak with
Inspector Deguara after lunch.

408
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,066
I'm gonna make sure that's
she's taking you seriously.

409
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,600
Thank you. I thought
the FBI was a U.S. thing.

410
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:08,567
Embassies are U.S. territory,
so it is our jurisdiction.

411
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,867
So is any crime
against an American

412
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,633
or an American interest.

413
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:14,633
So, if something has happened
to Elias, you'd get involved

414
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:16,934
because he's
an American citizen.

415
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:18,734
We would work with
local police, yes,

416
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:20,867
but since we don't know that
anything actually happened,

417
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,967
we have to stay out of it.

418
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,734
Remember when you said
you owed me one?

419
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:26,867
Am I going to regret that?

420
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,433
Regret's a strong word.

421
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,633
I just want to pick
your FBI brain for a bit.

422
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:32,200
You mean the brilliant one

423
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,934
that couldn't figure out
how to open a door?

424
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,734
Think of this as
your chance for redemption.

425
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,900
I'll meet you at
the police station.

426
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,200
Should we take a walk?

427
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,400
Travel writing
must be interesting.

428
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:50,133
Sure it's not as interesting
as being an FBI agent.

429
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:52,700
Oh, come on.
You get to travel the world.

430
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,934
I mean...

431
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:56,100
you've got... this place.

432
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,633
- Mdina?
- Right.

433
00:20:57,767 --> 00:20:59,567
See? Interesting.

434
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,433
I mean, yes,

435
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,700
but most of my job is really
just taking a lot of notes.

436
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:05,600
Then, we've got a lot in common.

437
00:21:05,734 --> 00:21:08,200
Really? Is that a big part
of investigating a crime?

438
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,500
It depends on the crime.

439
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:14,133
Say, hypothetically... murder.

440
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:15,967
That would be
a big hypothetical,

441
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,667
that the police
would be interested,

442
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,934
not a travel writer.

443
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:21,934
I know. I'm just--

444
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:24,367
I'm guessing that what
you do is a little different

445
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,967
to what I read
in my mystery novels.

446
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,166
Well, unfortunately,

447
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,000
there are very
few "a-ha" moments,

448
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,734
but I do think I would
rock a pipe and a monocle.

449
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:37,166
So, humor me.
How do you catch the bad guy?

450
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,433
How do you do it?

451
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,367
It's a bit like putting
together a jigsaw puzzle.

452
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,834
I mean,
you got your smaller pieces,

453
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:46,700
but you have to keep your eye
on the bigger picture time

454
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:48,367
or else you don't know where
everything's going to fit.

455
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:52,300
And then, you've got
your usual stuff--

456
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:53,867
collect evidence,

457
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,633
put together a
list of suspects--

458
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:58,033
What if you're not even sure
that a crime was even committed?

459
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,934
Trust your instinct.

460
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:02,867
I mean, if your gut is telling
you that something's wrong,

461
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,066
it usually is.

462
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,734
So, what about the crime scene?
What do you look for?

463
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:10,400
Hypothetically, of course?

464
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:12,533
Of course.

465
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,734
- Wow.

466
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:25,000
That is a really beautiful song.

467
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:30,400
Really beautiful.
Is it, um, Maltese?

468
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:32,033
Uh, yes, yes.

469
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,734
Oh, oh. Is it-- is it an old
song or a new song?

470
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:38,600
Um... It's--
it's quite old.

471
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:41,700
Speaking of old, I would
love to hear the history

472
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:45,500
of your beautiful country...
just all of it.

473
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:47,400
All of it?

474
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,467
From the very beginning.

475
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:54,066
Okay, Patrick,
I'm gonna put you on mute.

476
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,600
Let me know if
you hear any sound

477
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:56,867
coming through the vent, okay?

478
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,934
Got it.

479
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:03,166
Okay.

480
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:10,266
Chloe Hello? Testing.

481
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,433
One, two, three.
Testing...

482
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:15,133
I can hear something.
It's muffled,

483
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:16,467
but I can definitely
hear your voice.

484
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,767
You do?
That's what I heard last night.

485
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,500
Thank you.

486
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:24,800
No problem.
Be careful.

487
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:09,834
Um, we've been colonized.

488
00:24:09,967 --> 00:24:11,166
Oh!

489
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,000
- Many times.
- Oh. Oh, wow.

490
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,633
Uh... I just feel like I've
just learned the whole history

491
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:17,333
of the country.

492
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:20,700
So, thank you so much for
telling me all about Malta

493
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,200
and the, um,

494
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,500
historical significance.
Um... I'm going to go...

495
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,166
look at Malta.

496
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,734
Thank you.

497
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:29,700
Bye.

498
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:36,867
So, now what?

499
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,500
Well, we have an hour,

500
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:40,367
so maybe we can
find some cute shops

501
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,867
that we can include
in the magazine.

502
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,967
No, Chloe. I mean,
what are you going to do

503
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,533
with all the evidence
that you found?

504
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,200
Well, I mean,

505
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:48,967
it's just a piece of broken
glass and a cufflink.

506
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,567
It's not gonna
convince anyone.

507
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,667
I need to prove that
somebody was in that room

508
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,066
when I heard the argument.

509
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,066
But Elias had
checked out already.

510
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,667
Well, that's what they told us,

511
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,734
but he was going to show us
around today, remember?

512
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:02,567
Why would he check out
and not send me a text?

513
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,200
Maybe he had an emergency.

514
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,233
He wouldn't leave
before the grand opening.

515
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:10,400
I bet his hotel bill
would tell us a lot.

516
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,734
If we could just find out who
was on duty that night...

517
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:14,867
You think someone from
the hotel is involved?

518
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,900
The area where the body fell
is only accessible by staff.

519
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:20,867
Patrick, do you know anything

520
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,633
about hotel
reservations systems?

521
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:25,633
Not really. I mean, I could
probably figure it out, but...

522
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,133
Oh! Chloe, I'm sorry. No.

523
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:31,967
Hacking into a hotel system
is way beyond my skill set.

524
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,633
I understand.

525
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:35,734
But what if you could access
one of their computers,

526
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,100
do you think we could
find what we're looking for?

527
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:40,200
I might, but we don't have
that type of access.

528
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:41,934
Do we?

529
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,633
What about the security cameras?

530
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:54,600
They're not hooked up yet.

531
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:56,100
How are we going to get him
away from the front desk?

532
00:25:56,233 --> 00:25:57,767
Sara is going to...

533
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,166
Front desk.

534
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,600
Hi. I really need your help.

535
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:04,633
I'm locked out of my room.
I'm in 418.

536
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:06,533
If you come down to the lobby,
I'll be happy to...

537
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,533
Well, no. I really
need you to come up here.

538
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,633
- It's an emergency.
- I'll be there in a minute.

539
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:12,066
- Thank you.
- Okay.

540
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,200
Okay, okay...

541
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:27,867
He didn't lock it.

542
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,033
And it's in English.
So far, so good.

543
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,633
Can you access
the employee records?

544
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:35,700
I'm guessing it's the link
marked employee records.

545
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:37,934
I really owe you one for this.

546
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:39,800
Employee reviews are coming up,

547
00:26:39,934 --> 00:26:41,266
put in a good word with Tom.

548
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,934
Maybe just don't
mention this part.

549
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:45,800
Done.

550
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:49,767
Ahh, okay. I have the
room folio for suite 608.

551
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,300
I need a USB port to
export it to the flash drive.

552
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:54,400
Okay.

553
00:26:57,567 --> 00:26:59,934
Blue paint?

554
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:01,600
All right...

555
00:27:01,734 --> 00:27:04,100
What about the employees who
were on duty that night?

556
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:06,767
Already on it.
Downloading.

557
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,834
Can we make it go any faster?

558
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:12,000
It's not a horse;
I can't just yell "giddy up".

559
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:14,500
Good evening.
Hope you're enjoying your stay.

560
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,734
Good evening, sir.

561
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:18,200
Evening.

562
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,166
Oh, ahh, actually...
It's Peter, right?

563
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,400
- Yes.
- Yeah.

564
00:27:24,533 --> 00:27:25,667
I just had a question

565
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,400
about the building
down the street.

566
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:30,500
You know what? It might just be
easier if I show you. You mind?

567
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:33,467
- Of course.
- Great. Thank you.

568
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,433
Look at this
whole landscape here,

569
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:42,667
the whole architectural line,

570
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,133
I mean, it's absolutely
stunning.

571
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:45,367
- Yeah. No, it is. That is--
- Fascinating.

572
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,800
- That is fascinating.
- Yes.

573
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:48,166
- It is absolutely fascinating.
- Thank you.

574
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,433
Thank you so much, Peter.
I appreciate it.

575
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,467
- No problem at all.
- Yeah.

576
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,433
So...
remind me how

577
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:59,100
FBI's jurisdiction works
on foreign soil again?

578
00:27:59,233 --> 00:28:00,867
Well, I have none,

579
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,600
unless it was a crime
committed against an American

580
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:04,734
or an American interest.

581
00:28:04,867 --> 00:28:06,500
Well, the hotel is
owned by a Swiss company,

582
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:10,000
so, I don't know,
something like trespassing...

583
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,567
Would be none of my business.

584
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,600
But if I were to see
someone committing a crime,

585
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:17,000
like, say,
I don't know, trespassing,

586
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:19,367
then I should report it
to local police.

587
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,600
Okay.

588
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:24,500
What if that person was
doing it for a good reason?

589
00:28:24,633 --> 00:28:27,600
Like, what if they were really
worried about their friend?

590
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:29,333
Well, then,
I would probably drop it,

591
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:31,600
but I would also tell them that,

592
00:28:31,734 --> 00:28:33,567
if something did happen
to their friend,

593
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,934
then sneaking around in places

594
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:36,700
where they don't belong
is very dangerous.

595
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,200
I'm sure they understand.

596
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:43,500
Good. But in case
you weren't keeping count,

597
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:44,900
now, I think you owe me one.

598
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:47,033
Totally fair. Thank you.

599
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:53,734
Sir, I've taken the liberty
of booking you

600
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:55,367
on a walking tour
in the morning,

601
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,867
since you're so fascinated
with the architecture.

602
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,066
Yeah. No. You know,
I think I'm--

603
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,066
I have to check,
but I think my schedule

604
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,633
is really just kind of slammed.

605
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:04,300
It's a fairly--
it's a fairly quick tour.

606
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:06,000
I mean, you only
take in about 15 churches.

607
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:07,400
15?

608
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:08,633
I hope that's okay.

609
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:10,467
Can't wait. Thank you.

610
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:18,800
Should we be doing this?

611
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:20,567
Not even a little.

612
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,667
Okay. Just checking.
Carry on.

613
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,900
Okay. We didn't
get the detailed folio,

614
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,300
but here's a summary
of Elias' stay.

615
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,467
It says he checked in

616
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
at32 p.m. on the 14th

617
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:34,100
and checked out at
45 a.m. on the 18th.

618
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:37,133
That's forty minutes before
I heard the argument.

619
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:38,800
That doesn't make any sense.

620
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:40,166
What about the room charges?

621
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,500
There's not much here.

622
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:43,467
It says he ordered a movie,

623
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,767
a murder mystery.

624
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,467
Ironic. Sorry.

625
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,967
Then, there's mini bar

626
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,633
and room service,
but it doesn't say

627
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:52,433
when it was delivered or by who.

628
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:55,600
What about employee records?
Who was on duty that night?

629
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:58,667
Right. Okay. Here's a schedule
of who should have been here.

630
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,967
So, there's Peter Gilroy,
who was not at the front desk

631
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,233
when I came
downstairs that night.

632
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:08,767
Maybe moving a body?

633
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,000
Could he have faked
a checkout time?

634
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:13,500
If he couldn't,
then she could have -

635
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:15,066
Bree Hammond,
the manager.

636
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,400
She arrived in,
like, five minutes

637
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:18,066
after Peter called her at home.

638
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,734
Which means she could have
been here the whole time.

639
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:23,967
That's what I'm thinking.

640
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,900
That's Rianne Bonello.
She was the only housekeeper

641
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:31,667
on duty that night.

642
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,100
Oh, she probably really good at
cleaning up messes very quickly.

643
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:39,500
Yeah, but why?
I just don't see her

644
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:42,300
and Elias getting
into a fight that ends up

645
00:30:42,433 --> 00:30:44,066
with her pushing
him over the balcony.

646
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,166
Well, we took that self-defense
class and got really excited

647
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,834
about that
elbow to the stomach move.

648
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:53,800
Remind me never
to cross you two.

649
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,467
That's Isaac Abela.

650
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,467
He delivered my food that night.

651
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,066
Isaac was the only waiter
on the schedule,

652
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,800
so he definitely delivered
Elias' food that night.

653
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:03,200
And think about those
carts that they use,

654
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,834
he could easily have used that

655
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:06,967
to get rid of Elias' things
without anyone noticing.

656
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,667
Oh, come on.

657
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,500
Do you think a waiter have
access to a fake checkout time?

658
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:13,333
I mean, probably not,
but those are the only people

659
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:14,900
who had access to the rooms.

660
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:17,133
The rest are kitchen or
admin staff who wouldn't.

661
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:18,734
Okay, so, now,
you have a list of suspects.

662
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:20,000
Now what are you gonna do?

663
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:21,734
Now, I guess I go talk to them.

664
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:24,233
Chloe, you heard
what the FBI guy said,

665
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:26,233
this could be really dangerous.

666
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:27,567
I'll be careful.

667
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,166
But it's been two days since

668
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,734
anyone's heard anything
from Elias; I'm worried.

669
00:31:31,867 --> 00:31:34,667
- Yeah. Oh.

670
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,967
Hey, Tom.

671
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,400
Yeah, we'll be right there.

672
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:41,900
He's waiting for us.

673
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,300
Did you guys see
that there was a robbery

674
00:31:46,433 --> 00:31:48,133
at the embassy?

675
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:49,367
Wait. Did it happen
the same night

676
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,633
that you heard the argument?

677
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:52,166
No, the night before.

678
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,000
What did they steal?

679
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:57,834
"The embassy issued a statement
saying 'no comment'."

680
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:59,066
Do you think it's connected?

681
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,066
One mystery at a time.

682
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,467
Well, that was fun.

683
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,300
Yeah. Explaining
that newspaper article

684
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:08,100
to the ambassador
and the prime minister

685
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:10,934
was exactly how I
wanted to spend my day.

686
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:15,367
Forensic reports.

687
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,633
They found traces
of laundry detergent

688
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:19,900
mixed in with the dirt
they found on the floor.

689
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:22,934
Found phosphates in it, so
probably commercial grade.

690
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,200
Mm-hmm.

691
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:26,934
I'll make a list
of all the laundromats

692
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:28,367
and cleaners in the area

693
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,600
that would use this
kind of detergent.

694
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:31,200
Yeah, sounds good.

695
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:32,767
What are you thinking?

696
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,066
Not sure yet.

697
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,600
I'm gonna head
back to the hotel.

698
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:38,567
Okay.

699
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,266
- See you tomorrow.
- See ya.

700
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:46,633
Are you sure you wanna do this?

701
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:48,066
No.

702
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,400
But the only way to
rule out suspects

703
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:53,133
is to talk to them, so...

704
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:58,734
- Come on! Come on, come on!
- Oh, okay.

705
00:33:11,433 --> 00:33:13,834
This is how cheerleaders get
killed in horror movies.

706
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:16,133
Shh! Don't say that.

707
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:17,600
I was a cheerleader.

708
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:18,834
Shocking.

709
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:20,300
It'll be fine.

710
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:21,800
- Ooh!

711
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:24,133
- What was that?
- Okay, I've changed my mind.

712
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:26,033
I'm thinking we should be
interviewing the suspects

713
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:28,033
in a brightly lit lobby
with lots of people around.

714
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:30,433
I agree. Let's just go right
back where we came from.

715
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:32,100
- Shh!

716
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:34,200
Chloe, hey, it's me.

717
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:35,467
- Aaron?
- Yeah.

718
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,266
You scared us to death!

719
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,867
What are you guys
doing down here?

720
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,133
Owing you two favors?

721
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:42,967
This is Sara;
she works with me.

722
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,000
I would say "nice to meet you,"

723
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:46,767
but I have to
restart my heart.

724
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,633
What are you doing here?

725
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:53,533
Looking for that.

726
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:03,367
You feel that?

727
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:08,834
Yeah. Where's that
breeze coming from?

728
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,233
Whoa,

729
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:22,633
Okay, that just happened.

730
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,834
Stay here.

731
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,200
Okay.

732
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,033
Come on.

733
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:37,166
You want me to go in there?

734
00:35:06,934 --> 00:35:10,600
That's Elias!

735
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:21,266
Do you think Elias was connected
to the embassy robbery?

736
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,000
I know the papers didn't say

737
00:35:23,133 --> 00:35:24,767
what was stolen,
but he can't be--

738
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,400
Chloe, we can't
talk about any of that.

739
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Right.

740
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:32,100
But you know whoever killed him
probably worked at the hotel.

741
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:34,533
Otherwise, how could
they have had access

742
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:37,000
to the restricted area
where I saw his body

743
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:38,667
or faked a checkout time?

744
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,467
And how do you know they
manipulated the checkout time?

745
00:35:43,867 --> 00:35:46,066
I don't, really.
It's just...

746
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:52,033
Just people I spoke to...

747
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:56,100
I see. Well, that's it for now.

748
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:57,867
But if we have
any further questions,

749
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,500
we'll be in touch.

750
00:35:59,633 --> 00:36:01,433
Chloe, I'm gonna
need your passport.

751
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:03,900
What? Why?

752
00:36:04,033 --> 00:36:05,133
Because you are
a material witness

753
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:06,400
to a murder investigation.

754
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,600
Fine. It's at the hotel.

755
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:14,633
I'll go get it.

756
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:17,200
Why don't you two
go on ahead? I'll see Chloe out.

757
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:30,233
Listen, we do think that
the two events are related,

758
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:33,133
we just don't know how yet.

759
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:36,100
And until we do, our focus
has to be on the robbery.

760
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:38,100
But you're going to
investigate the murder, right?

761
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:39,600
Yes, of course.

762
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:41,433
In fact, we went to
go see his father.

763
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,000
His father
didn't want to see us.

764
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:44,266
Why not?

765
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,000
I don't know.

766
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:48,600
But he's a Maltese citizen,
so how hard we push him

767
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:49,834
is entirely up to the inspector.

768
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:51,767
We are working out
jurisdiction.

769
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,333
It's going to take
a little bit of time.

770
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:57,066
I will keep you in the loop
as much as I can.

771
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,734
You would do that?

772
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:01,633
As long as you promise to leave
the investigating to us,

773
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:03,800
hypothetical or otherwise.

774
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:06,533
I understand.

775
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,734
Thank you.

776
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,300
I just don't understand

777
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:18,300
why you didn't tell me
about any of this earlier.

778
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:19,734
Because you're my boss, Tom,

779
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:21,667
and my ex;
it's complicated.

780
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,300
Well, it shouldn't be.
We're still friends, aren't we?

781
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:25,700
Of course.

782
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:27,133
Well, then, you should trust me.

783
00:37:27,266 --> 00:37:29,033
I'll always have your back.

784
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,166
Aww, thank you.
That means a lot.

785
00:37:33,266 --> 00:37:34,967
Do you think you'll
need a lawyer?

786
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,834
It might not be a bad idea
to have one on speed dial.

787
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:40,867
You're not going to keep
poking around, are you?

788
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,166
Well, we still don't know

789
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,300
how Elias is connected
to the robbery,

790
00:37:44,433 --> 00:37:46,834
or, if he was, why would he stay
another night at the hotel,

791
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:48,667
or what was stolen.

792
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,834
Wait, Chloe, those are questions
for the police and the FBI.

793
00:37:51,967 --> 00:37:54,033
Yeah, but they're
not asking them!

794
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:57,066
Elias was my friend;
I need to do something.

795
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,467
- He was murdered!
- Relax, Tom.

796
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,066
I'm not going to do anything
that could put me in danger.

797
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,900
You found a body while skulking
around a hotel basement!

798
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:05,867
I'm not going
to do anything else

799
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,300
that could put me in danger.

800
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:08,734
Chloe, you need
to let go of this

801
00:38:08,867 --> 00:38:09,967
and let the
authorities do their job.

802
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,967
Sure.

803
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,767
- All right.

804
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,600
- Yeah.

805
00:38:15,734 --> 00:38:18,266
Hey, thanks for
getting back to me. Great.

806
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:30,300
Hello, Mr. Lentini.

807
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,900
I'm sorry to leave
a message like this.

808
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:36,066
This is Chloe Day. Uh...

809
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,233
I met you a few times while
Elias was in college.

810
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:42,734
Look, are you sure you want
to be down here for this,

811
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:44,133
Madame Ambassador?

812
00:38:44,266 --> 00:38:46,200
We can cover
all of this with DSS.

813
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:47,800
I don't want to
hear things secondhand.

814
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:49,233
Just get on with it.

815
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:50,800
Okay.

816
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:52,400
So, there are
passageways like this

817
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:54,100
under a lot of the city.

818
00:38:54,233 --> 00:38:55,633
They date back
to the 16th century.

819
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,100
Now, the tunnels from the hotel

820
00:38:58,233 --> 00:39:01,834
and the embassy only probably
go back to the 1950s.

821
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:03,367
Unfortunately,

822
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,667
the hotel cameras aren't
operational yet

823
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,266
and the embassy doesn't have
cameras in the basement,

824
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,100
so we don't have
coverage of any of the exits.

825
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:12,367
Why connect the embassy to this?

826
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,667
They used to sneak people
in and out all the time,

827
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,633
especially during the Cold War.
It was legit spycraft.

828
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:19,166
And nobody knew it was here?

829
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,834
I suspect it was
sealed off in the 1990s.

830
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:24,033
There's only a few at the
embassy from that era.

831
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:26,266
Including yourself, right?

832
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,200
Well, yes,

833
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,767
but I-I
was a low level specialist.

834
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,600
I certainly didn't
have clearance for things

835
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:36,000
like secret spy tunnels.

836
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:39,200
Do we think Lentini
found the tunnel

837
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:40,500
while doing construction
on the hotel?

838
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:41,934
Makes sense.

839
00:39:42,066 --> 00:39:44,600
The only question is
how did he know

840
00:39:44,734 --> 00:39:46,367
what was in the embassy vault

841
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,367
and how did he know
how to get to it?

842
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,934
- Oh.

843
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:53,166
Uh, gentlemen,
I need to get back.

844
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,800
- Keep me posted.
- Of course, ma'am.

845
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,967
Maybe our amateur sleuth
can help figure this out.

846
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,533
I'm don't think we've
seen the last of Chloe Day.

847
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:12,500
Ms. Day.
Uh, your food is just in there.

848
00:40:12,633 --> 00:40:15,100
I don't understand.
I didn't order room service.

849
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:18,333
Yes. A cheeseburger
and French fries.

850
00:40:18,467 --> 00:40:19,834
Sorry, but when you
didn't answer the door,

851
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:21,467
I thought I would just
leave it in there--

852
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,834
I didn't ask for that.

853
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:26,633
That's odd.

854
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:28,834
Perhaps I made a mistake

855
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:31,266
and went somewhere
I should not have been.

856
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,500
That happens, no?

857
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:35,700
I guess.

858
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:38,567
Anyway, it's on the house.

859
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:15,367
Mr. Lentini.

860
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,734
I'm so sorry--

861
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,767
Yes. OK.

862
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,934
Yes, I can meet you there.

863
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:23,467
I'm on my way.

864
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:50,433
- Mr. Lentini.
- Chloe.

865
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm so sorry about Elias.

866
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:57,100
Thank you. He was fond of you.

867
00:41:57,233 --> 00:41:58,834
He was a good friend.

868
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:00,767
Please, sit. Let's talk.

869
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:05,000
I know this is
a difficult time for you

870
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:07,400
and I'm sorry to ask you this,

871
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:09,600
but did the police--

872
00:42:09,734 --> 00:42:11,333
The police!

873
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,734
Do not talk to me
about the police.

874
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,400
They think that he was
involved with the robbery

875
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:19,467
of the U.S. embassy.

876
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,066
Rubbish!

877
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,767
Why would he want
top secret documents?

878
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,600
Is that what was stolen?

879
00:42:25,734 --> 00:42:26,834
How do you know that?

880
00:42:26,967 --> 00:42:29,800
I have lived here
my entire life.

881
00:42:29,934 --> 00:42:31,567
There is very little
that happens in Malta

882
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,500
that I do not know.

883
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:36,533
Was there any connection
between Elias and the embassy?

884
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,266
Mr. Lentini.

885
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,600
We cannot let whoever did this
to Elias get away with it just

886
00:42:45,734 --> 00:42:47,166
because we don't want
to believe that he may have

887
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,667
done something bad.

888
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:52,133
Let's-- Let's walk.

889
00:42:52,266 --> 00:42:53,500
Yes.

890
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:09,700
Elias loved this place.

891
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:12,266
He wanted one of
those big houses on the hill

892
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,133
and a yacht in the harbor.

893
00:43:14,266 --> 00:43:15,867
That sounds like him.

894
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,567
He always had big dreams.

895
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,633
I am a proud man, Chloe.

896
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:23,633
Too proud, I suspect,

897
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,700
and I may have
given that to Elias,

898
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:30,367
but pride can make
a person reckless.

899
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,300
I would never say
anything against my son,

900
00:43:34,433 --> 00:43:36,633
but perhaps...

901
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:38,567
perhaps with every
act of recklessness,

902
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,100
there is one of reckoning.

903
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:42,767
This should tell you more.

904
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:46,266
Rianne?

905
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,266
Oh, Chloe!

906
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,767
We keep running into each other.

907
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,800
This is Mr. Lentini.
Elias' father.

908
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:55,433
I'm so sorry for your loss,
Mr. Lentini.

909
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:58,133
Everyone at the hotel loved
working for Elias very much.

910
00:43:58,266 --> 00:43:59,467
Thank you.

911
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,700
Chloe, it's good to see you.

912
00:44:00,834 --> 00:44:01,767
You, too.

913
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,767
Be well.

914
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,166
Take care.

915
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,967
So, no work today?

916
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,266
No, no. Tonight.

917
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,166
I'm just-- I'm out running
errands before my shift begins.

918
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,934
And you?

919
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:17,867
I've got to go put some
pieces of a puzzle together.

920
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,967
Ciao.

921
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,200
Ciao, ciao, ciao.

922
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:21,567
See you later.

923
00:44:35,834 --> 00:44:37,000
Oh.

924
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

925
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:42,133
Do you remember the part
where you told me to

926
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:44,533
leave the investigating
to the investigators?

927
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:45,633
Vividly.

928
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:46,867
Hypothetically--

929
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,433
I'm starting not
to like that word.

930
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:51,867
What if I were to,
you know, keep poking around?

931
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,633
Well, then you would be
interfering in an active

932
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:58,200
FBI investigation and I could,
you know, arrest you.

933
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,166
Hm.

934
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,233
Have you ever heard the phrase
"it's easier to ask forgiveness

935
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,934
than it is to get permission?"

936
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,367
Go ahead.

937
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,600
I know how Elias Lentini is

938
00:45:09,734 --> 00:45:11,400
connected to
the embassy robbery.

939
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:17,367
So, Mr. Lentini just
gave you all of this?

940
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,900
Yes. He wants to find
out who murdered his son

941
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:21,900
but he doesn't want to
implicate him in the robbery.

942
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:23,233
So, he's having
you do it for him.

943
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:25,033
I guess so.

944
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:27,767
These documents show that
Lentini Construction remodeled

945
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,600
the embassy ten years ago.

946
00:45:29,734 --> 00:45:31,033
When the vault was installed.

947
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:32,500
We saw that in the records,

948
00:45:32,633 --> 00:45:33,767
but a different
company did the vault.

949
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,333
They went out of
business years ago

950
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:37,266
so we're still
tracking them down.

951
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,033
Valletta Securities,
owned by Condor Enterprises,

952
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:41,433
which is owned by--

953
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:43,166
Elias Lentini.

954
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,266
He always had these
little side businesses.

955
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,066
So, his company
puts in the vault,

956
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,700
which means he definitely
knows how to open it.

957
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:51,700
Now we just need to figure out
who he was working with

958
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:54,200
and what he would want
with top secret documents.

959
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:56,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
How do you know about--

960
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:00,200
I don't want to know. No.

961
00:46:02,233 --> 00:46:04,233
What did the autopsy say?

962
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:05,667
And did you check
the hotel records?

963
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,333
Yeah, I'm not telling
you any of that.

964
00:46:07,467 --> 00:46:09,400
I just gave you a huge clue!

965
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,233
I fell like we're back
to you owing me one.

966
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:12,967
I feel like you need
to check your math.

967
00:46:16,867 --> 00:46:19,433
The only odd thing about
the autopsy was that it showed

968
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:21,900
a small puncture wound in
his shoulder that couldn't have

969
00:46:22,033 --> 00:46:23,166
come from the fall.

970
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,500
As for the hotel records,

971
00:46:24,633 --> 00:46:27,000
we're still waiting
on a subpoena.

972
00:46:27,133 --> 00:46:29,266
The hotel manager
won't give them to you?

973
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,233
She's on my list of suspects.

974
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:33,767
I don't want to know
about your list of suspects.

975
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,133
Besides, it's not her decision.

976
00:46:36,266 --> 00:46:38,600
The hotel is owned by a company
that's based in Switzerland,

977
00:46:38,734 --> 00:46:41,433
they are very
serious about privacy.

978
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:44,633
So, the State Department
is negotiating for us.

979
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:47,467
You might want to subpoena
the room service records

980
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,767
while you're at it.

981
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,433
And why would I want to do that?

982
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:53,233
Just a hunch.

983
00:46:55,934 --> 00:46:57,233
So, what do you think?
Am I ready to join the FBI?

984
00:46:57,367 --> 00:46:59,767
Oh, yeah.
I mean, who needs Quantico?

985
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,266
I'll get you a badge tomorrow.

986
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,033
I was supposed to
meet Tom an hour ago

987
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:11,400
to review a nightclub.

988
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:13,700
My FBI job's getting
in the way of my real job.

989
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,533
I take it your boss
doesn't want you playing

990
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:16,967
Sherlock Holmes either, huh?

991
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,633
It's complicated.

992
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:20,200
Oh, you and Tom are..

993
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:23,800
Were. Past tense. Very.

994
00:47:23,934 --> 00:47:25,300
What happened?

995
00:47:25,433 --> 00:47:29,567
I am so sorry,
it's the whole FBI thing.

996
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,400
Every time I try to
express genuine interest

997
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:34,166
in a person's life, it ends up
sounding like an interrogation.

998
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,567
It's okay.

999
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,200
Well, I liked Tom because
he's a travel writer like me,

1000
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:44,066
and traveling's
very important to me.

1001
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,133
My parents used to take me
on trips when I was growing up,

1002
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:49,867
but they passed away
when I was young.

1003
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,133
I'm sorry.

1004
00:47:51,266 --> 00:47:53,233
Thank you.

1005
00:47:53,367 --> 00:47:55,233
So, I went to live
with my grandmother,

1006
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:58,233
who she never went anywhere.

1007
00:47:58,367 --> 00:48:00,800
So, I made a career
out of travel writing.

1008
00:48:00,934 --> 00:48:04,266
That's why it felt like
Tom was such a perfect fit.

1009
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,633
Those are rare.

1010
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:07,967
Yeah.

1011
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,567
We never saw each other.

1012
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,967
I'd be coming back from Brazil
and he would be off to Japan,

1013
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,800
or he'd get back from some place
and I'd be off to the next.

1014
00:48:21,367 --> 00:48:23,533
The irony is now
that he's editor,

1015
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:24,900
I see him all the time.

1016
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:27,700
Like I said. It's complicated.

1017
00:48:27,834 --> 00:48:30,100
Yeah, no, I get it.

1018
00:48:30,233 --> 00:48:33,367
I mean,
I'm on the road all the time.

1019
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,033
Whenever I head
home to DC I have to

1020
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:36,400
look up my own address.

1021
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:39,233
So, there's no Mrs. FBI Agent?

1022
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:40,900
There was.

1023
00:48:41,033 --> 00:48:42,967
Also past tense.

1024
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,300
At least she's not your boss.

1025
00:48:44,433 --> 00:48:46,567
No, no. That would be my dad.

1026
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,266
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1027
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,133
What's that like?

1028
00:48:50,266 --> 00:48:51,500
Complicated.

1029
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,934
Especially when I don't
follow to the rulebook.

1030
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:59,467
Oh, are you one of
those rogue FBI agents?

1031
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,800
Well, I am talking to you.

1032
00:49:05,266 --> 00:49:06,367
I better go.

1033
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,433
Let me know about that badge.

1034
00:49:08,567 --> 00:49:09,533
Oh, I will.

1035
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:10,633
Good night, Chloe.

1036
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:12,000
Goodnight.

1037
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,500
- Rianne, hi.
- Hi.

1038
00:49:33,633 --> 00:49:36,033
Did you clean my room tonight?
510?

1039
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:37,500
No.

1040
00:49:37,633 --> 00:49:41,500
That was done by the day
shift at00 o'clock.

1041
00:49:41,633 --> 00:49:43,700
Before I went to
see Mr. Lentini.

1042
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:45,233
Yeah.

1043
00:49:47,066 --> 00:49:49,900
So, I know that the hotel
isn't fully open yet,

1044
00:49:50,033 --> 00:49:52,266
but do you always
work the night shift?

1045
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,200
No. no. Not always,
It's not so bad.

1046
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:56,900
There are fewer rooms to clean.

1047
00:49:57,033 --> 00:49:59,367
And were you working
the night Elias was murdered?

1048
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,934
Yes, but I was
not on that floor.

1049
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:07,667
Are you involved
with the investigation?

1050
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,867
Me? No.

1051
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,233
Just curious.

1052
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,400
So, did you see anybody
go into my room tonight?

1053
00:50:15,533 --> 00:50:17,667
No.

1054
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,033
The only other person I saw up
here tonight was the manager.

1055
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:22,734
Ms. Bree Hammond.

1056
00:50:22,867 --> 00:50:24,667
Is something wrong in your room?
Do you need me to--

1057
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,533
No, no. Everything's fine.

1058
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:28,066
Thank you.

1059
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,533
Have a good night.

1060
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:31,200
You, too.

1061
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,934
I didn't see any
spyware or viruses.

1062
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,433
And we encrypt all of our files,
so I think you're good.

1063
00:50:38,567 --> 00:50:40,266
I know I closed
that laptop before

1064
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,667
I went to see Mr. Lentini.

1065
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,233
Who could've been in your room?

1066
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:46,233
Isaac, Rianne, Bree.

1067
00:50:46,367 --> 00:50:49,533
Ms. Day,
your scooter rental is ready.

1068
00:50:49,667 --> 00:50:51,767
The gentleman over there will
show you how to operate it.

1069
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,033
Thank you, Peter.

1070
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:54,934
Pleasure.

1071
00:50:55,066 --> 00:50:58,500
Does that towel look familiar?

1072
00:50:58,633 --> 00:51:00,800
Don't you remember there was
a towel with blue paint on it

1073
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:02,300
under the front desk?

1074
00:51:02,433 --> 00:51:04,934
Chloe, Chloe!
You can't mention the towel

1075
00:51:05,066 --> 00:51:06,600
because then he'll know
that we were back there.

1076
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:08,667
Yeah, but we still don't
know where he was when I came

1077
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,800
downstairs that night.
And where's Bree?

1078
00:51:11,934 --> 00:51:13,233
I mean,
she's near my room yesterday,

1079
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:14,734
today she's not at work?

1080
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:15,734
Come on, that's suspicious.

1081
00:51:15,867 --> 00:51:17,500
True.

1082
00:51:17,633 --> 00:51:21,734
Patrick do those employee
records you downloaded yesterday

1083
00:51:21,867 --> 00:51:24,100
have home addresses on them?

1084
00:51:24,233 --> 00:51:25,767
I'm going to pay Bree a visit.

1085
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,734
Wh--

1086
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:29,834
Are you actually
trying to get me fired?

1087
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,233
Are you following me?

1088
00:52:57,367 --> 00:52:59,166
Yes.

1089
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,967
I'm calling the police.

1090
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,867
Okay, fine. I'll tell them
about how you broke into my room

1091
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,333
and went through my laptop.

1092
00:53:06,033 --> 00:53:07,233
How did you know about that?

1093
00:53:07,367 --> 00:53:08,967
I didn't, but I do now.

1094
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,734
What were you looking for?

1095
00:53:11,867 --> 00:53:14,533
I wanted to know what you
were writing about the hotel.

1096
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:16,066
I can't afford
a negative review,

1097
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,266
and considering the incident.

1098
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,533
Murder?

1099
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:21,367
Yes.

1100
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,100
I know Elias Lentini
was your friend

1101
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,967
and you've been
talking to the FBI.

1102
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,266
Okay, but why all
the sneaking around?

1103
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,500
Why the scarf
and the sunglasses?

1104
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,934
I copied some files from your
computer but they were locked,

1105
00:53:37,066 --> 00:53:39,433
so I was taking them to
a friend who said he could help.

1106
00:53:44,867 --> 00:53:46,700
For the record,
the review was a good one.

1107
00:53:46,834 --> 00:53:49,567
Thank you.

1108
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,233
I hope I can count on you
to keep this little

1109
00:53:53,367 --> 00:53:54,900
indiscretion between us?

1110
00:53:55,033 --> 00:53:57,734
On one condition.

1111
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:00,266
The hotel has been stalling
on handing over the records

1112
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,000
for the night
Elias Lentini was murdered.

1113
00:54:03,133 --> 00:54:05,133
Perhaps you could
expedite the process.

1114
00:55:24,834 --> 00:55:26,233
Sorry!

1115
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:30,533
- Whoa!

1116
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,300
Aaron?

1117
00:55:57,266 --> 00:55:59,500
You know, generally speaking if
you're trying to be incognito,

1118
00:55:59,633 --> 00:56:02,734
Wearing a hat the size of
a bus is not the way to do it.

1119
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:06,533
Trying to lighten the mood.

1120
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,900
It's too soon.
Definitely too soon.

1121
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:11,233
Chloe, somebody thinks that
you're getting too close

1122
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,567
to actually knowing something.

1123
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,033
and they're trying
to scare you off.

1124
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:16,266
Well, it's working.

1125
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,600
I think that you should
go back to the U.S.

1126
00:56:18,734 --> 00:56:21,233
I'll get your passport,
we'll send you on your way.

1127
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:23,767
No, but you said that I was
getting close to something.

1128
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,700
I can't leave until I find
out who did this to Elias.

1129
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:30,233
Okay, so,
here's what's going to happen.

1130
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:33,600
You're going to tell me
everything you know.

1131
00:56:33,734 --> 00:56:35,100
We're going to go
through all of it

1132
00:56:35,233 --> 00:56:37,066
and maybe I can
fill in some gaps.

1133
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,934
Could you get
in trouble for that?

1134
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:40,467
I live on the edge, remember?

1135
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,200
I mean, I guess your
boss is your dad.

1136
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,900
So, what's the worst
that can happen?

1137
00:56:45,033 --> 00:56:46,934
Tell my mom.

1138
00:56:49,533 --> 00:56:51,800
Alright, hit me with it.

1139
00:56:51,934 --> 00:56:53,467
Okay.

1140
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,567
Alright, so, according to
the newspaper article,

1141
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,467
on the night of the 16th,
two people broke into

1142
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,033
the embassy and stole
top secret documents

1143
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:04,133
We know that one of
them was Elias Lentini.

1144
00:57:04,266 --> 00:57:05,867
We don't know that for sure.

1145
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,133
He knew about the tunnels
and he had access the vault.

1146
00:57:08,266 --> 00:57:10,033
Okay. Alright, let's assume
that you're right about that.

1147
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:11,533
Keep going.

1148
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:13,300
So, then they escaped
through the tunnels,

1149
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:16,867
but I'm thinking that for
whatever reason they couldn't

1150
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,200
take the documents out
of the hotel that night.

1151
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:21,834
Embassy security had
locked down the entire area.

1152
00:57:21,967 --> 00:57:24,300
And the documents
were in a steel box.

1153
00:57:24,433 --> 00:57:26,600
It's big, it's heavy,
it's hard to move,

1154
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,533
it's got an encrypted lock.

1155
00:57:28,667 --> 00:57:29,800
Probably couldn't get it open.

1156
00:57:29,934 --> 00:57:32,033
- So, they left it behind.
- Mm-hm.

1157
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:35,800
Either in the tunnels or perhaps
hidden in the basement.

1158
00:57:35,934 --> 00:57:37,700
They wait for the next night
after things have cooled down

1159
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:39,333
a little bit.

1160
00:57:39,467 --> 00:57:42,600
Right, and then the partner
goes to Elias' room

1161
00:57:42,734 --> 00:57:45,433
after00am
and they get into a fight.

1162
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:47,033
Which you hear through the vent.

1163
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:48,533
Yes.

1164
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:52,633
And the partner pushes
Elias off the balcony.

1165
00:57:52,767 --> 00:57:55,333
But then, how does
the killer go downstairs,

1166
00:57:55,467 --> 00:57:56,967
wrap the body in plastic,

1167
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,200
move it to the tunnel,
and then get back upstairs

1168
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:01,867
to clean out
everything from Elias' room?

1169
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,834
They couldn't have.

1170
00:58:03,967 --> 00:58:05,500
Unless there was a third person.

1171
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:07,266
Exactly.

1172
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,567
So, suspects?

1173
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,233
Alright, so,
Bree Hammond, the manager.

1174
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:16,367
She says she was at home,
but there's no way she

1175
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,433
could've gotten from
where she lives to the hotel

1176
00:58:18,567 --> 00:58:19,867
as quickly as she did.

1177
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,600
Plus, she could
change the records.

1178
00:58:21,734 --> 00:58:22,600
Okay. Who else?

1179
00:58:22,734 --> 00:58:24,333
Rianne, the housekeeper.

1180
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:25,767
I mean, she said she was
cleaning another floor

1181
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,367
that night, but who knows?

1182
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,533
She could've cleaned out
Elias's stuff from his room.

1183
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:30,767
Anybody else?

1184
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,734
Isaac, the room service waiter.

1185
00:58:32,867 --> 00:58:35,166
We know he delivered
food that night.

1186
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,934
And Peter, the front desk guy,

1187
00:58:39,066 --> 00:58:40,867
who could have
changed the hotel records

1188
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,567
and was not down there when
I came down that night.

1189
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,000
Why is that suspicious?

1190
00:58:45,133 --> 00:58:47,033
Because I found
a towel with paint on it

1191
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:49,734
underneath the front desk,
the same paint that I saw

1192
00:58:49,867 --> 00:58:52,266
in the alley
where the body fell.

1193
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,834
But what I still don't
understand is why people

1194
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:58,000
who work in a hotel would want
to steal top secret documents?

1195
00:58:58,133 --> 00:59:01,600
Because one of those people
is not who they say they are.

1196
00:59:03,066 --> 00:59:05,400
Has the name Cypher
come up in anything

1197
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:07,233
that you've seen or heard?

1198
00:59:07,367 --> 00:59:08,467
No. What's that?

1199
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,233
It's not a what, it's a who.

1200
00:59:10,367 --> 00:59:12,333
A spy and a bad one.

1201
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:15,100
Nobody knows who he is
or what he looks like,

1202
00:59:15,233 --> 00:59:17,834
but this is exactly the kind
of thing that he would do,

1203
00:59:17,967 --> 00:59:19,734
and he wouldn't be shy
about getting rid of anybody

1204
00:59:19,867 --> 00:59:21,433
who was in his way.

1205
00:59:23,367 --> 00:59:25,266
Alright, I'm officially
freaked out.

1206
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,000
Chloe, here's what
I want you to do.

1207
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:32,433
You forget about all this,
you go back to travel writing.

1208
00:59:32,567 --> 00:59:35,000
And you be careful.

1209
00:59:35,133 --> 00:59:36,834
If you see anything,
anything at all that's

1210
00:59:36,967 --> 00:59:40,633
out of the ordinary,
call me, okay?

1211
00:59:40,767 --> 00:59:43,066
Okay.

1212
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,300
But just FYI,
I don't want the badge anymore.

1213
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:48,033
Let's get you back.

1214
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,967
You sure you're
going to be okay?

1215
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,166
I think I'll make it.

1216
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,900
Alright, well, if there's
anything that you need--

1217
01:00:13,033 --> 01:00:14,667
Chloe?!

1218
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,667
Are you okay?

1219
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,300
Yes, I'm okay. Thank you.

1220
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,900
Uh, I should be
getting to get back to--

1221
01:00:21,033 --> 01:00:23,667
Right. Thank you, Aaron.

1222
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,133
Yes, thank you, Agent Maxwell.

1223
01:00:25,266 --> 01:00:26,500
Very welcome.

1224
01:00:28,433 --> 01:00:29,667
See you.

1225
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,266
I'm going to call the lawyers,
see if there's a way you can

1226
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,100
get your passport back.
You're going home.

1227
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:38,800
But I'm not ready to leave.

1228
01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:40,300
Besides,
what about the magazine?

1229
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:42,233
I don't care about the magazine.

1230
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,633
Yes, you do.

1231
01:00:43,767 --> 01:00:46,667
Okay, I do,
but I care about you more.

1232
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,633
I'm worried. Is that okay?

1233
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,934
Yes, that's okay.

1234
01:00:51,066 --> 01:00:53,066
Oh, Ms. Hammond.

1235
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,633
Here's that hotel
press kit you requested.

1236
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:58,934
Right. Thank you.

1237
01:00:59,066 --> 01:01:00,800
Well, at least that will
keep you distracted from

1238
01:01:00,934 --> 01:01:02,033
all this murder business.

1239
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:04,400
I hope so.

1240
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,667
Okay, what we had
before was just a summary,

1241
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,367
but this is way more detailed.

1242
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,300
It says that Elias
rented the movie at04pm,

1243
01:01:14,433 --> 01:01:17,300
then took items from
the minibar at30pm

1244
01:01:17,433 --> 01:01:19,400
and again15pm.

1245
01:01:19,533 --> 01:01:22,000
Then there's nothing until
the room service delivery

1246
01:01:22,133 --> 01:01:24,500
at55am.

1247
01:01:24,633 --> 01:01:27,500
But he supposedly
checked out at45am.

1248
01:01:27,633 --> 01:01:30,633
How could get room service ten
minutes after he checked out

1249
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:33,166
and then get
murdered after that?

1250
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,166
Whoever killed him obviously
faked the check-out time

1251
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,533
to make it look as if
he wasn't in the hotel

1252
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:38,233
at the time of murder.

1253
01:01:38,367 --> 01:01:40,066
Oh, Chloe, who would want to
put a fake check-out time?

1254
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,400
Someone who delivered the order,
and didn't want anyone to know

1255
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:43,834
he was there?

1256
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:45,367
Are you able to look up
the room service orders

1257
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,734
for the entire hotel?

1258
01:01:46,867 --> 01:01:48,367
Sure, up until this afternoon.

1259
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,567
Okay, were there any orders
from my room yesterday?

1260
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,967
No. Nothing from your room.

1261
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:56,133
Would it show up
even if it was cancelled?

1262
01:01:56,266 --> 01:01:57,867
Well, it should.

1263
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,800
There's an order here for
room 206 that was cancelled,

1264
01:02:00,934 --> 01:02:03,100
but it still
shows up as an order.

1265
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:06,700
So, Isaac lied. He wasn't in my
room to deliver food yesterday,

1266
01:02:06,834 --> 01:02:08,867
and he was on duty
the night Elias was murdered.

1267
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,533
Chloe, you need to show
this to Aaron or the police.

1268
01:02:11,667 --> 01:02:15,100
I will, I just need to be sure.

1269
01:02:24,266 --> 01:02:25,700
How did you get that?

1270
01:02:25,834 --> 01:02:27,066
I may have implied that
I'd tell the hotel company

1271
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,300
she broke into my
computer if she didn't.

1272
01:02:28,433 --> 01:02:29,400
You wouldn't really do that.

1273
01:02:29,533 --> 01:02:31,633
She doesn't need to know that.

1274
01:02:31,767 --> 01:02:34,300
Okay, so I need you guys
to distract Tom, while I--

1275
01:02:34,433 --> 01:02:36,967
Chloe, someone tried to
kill you, like, two hours ago!

1276
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,633
And I'm not going to stop
until I find out who it was.

1277
01:02:39,767 --> 01:02:41,900
All I want is a quick
look in his locker

1278
01:02:42,033 --> 01:02:43,934
to make sure that
there's nothing suspicious.

1279
01:02:44,066 --> 01:02:45,233
Five minutes.

1280
01:02:47,533 --> 01:02:50,200
Patrick can distract Tom.
I'm going with you.

1281
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,066
Bree said that this would
get us past any lock.

1282
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,800
Isaac, Isaac, Isaac, Isaac.
Isaac!

1283
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,467
Well, I'd say that
qualifies as suspicious.

1284
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:13,033
I really wish you
hadn't found that.

1285
01:03:25,967 --> 01:03:28,633
Nous avons un problème.

1286
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,633
Je dois leur dire qui je suis.

1287
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:33,400
Oui.

1288
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:39,300
We need to talk
to your FBI friend.

1289
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,367
She should not be here.

1290
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,500
Ms. Day, we owe you
a debt of gratitude,

1291
01:03:52,633 --> 01:03:53,934
so I'm going to let you stay,

1292
01:03:54,066 --> 01:03:56,000
but under penalty of law.

1293
01:03:56,133 --> 01:03:58,066
I understand. I won't say word.

1294
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,900
I'll take full responsibility.

1295
01:04:01,033 --> 01:04:01,967
Please, continue.

1296
01:04:03,934 --> 01:04:07,400
My name is Jeffrey Boucher.

1297
01:04:07,533 --> 01:04:09,233
I work for
the direction générale

1298
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:10,900
de la sécurité extérieure.

1299
01:04:11,033 --> 01:04:13,100
It's the French
equivalent of the CIA.

1300
01:04:13,233 --> 01:04:16,667
Normand Duclasse, the agent who
brought these documents here,

1301
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,500
he was my partner.

1302
01:04:18,633 --> 01:04:20,934
We were trying to keep them
safe from an enemy operative.

1303
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:22,600
Cypher?

1304
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:24,433
Yes.

1305
01:04:24,567 --> 01:04:26,834
We know he wanted to sell these
documents to the highest bidder,

1306
01:04:26,967 --> 01:04:29,600
but before we could
get them out of Malta,

1307
01:04:29,734 --> 01:04:31,266
Cypher attacked

1308
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,767
and Normand was killed.

1309
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,000
I'm sorry.

1310
01:04:36,133 --> 01:04:37,934
Merci.

1311
01:04:39,734 --> 01:04:42,300
The documents were safe here,
but I knew it was only a matter

1312
01:04:42,433 --> 01:04:44,800
of time before
Cypher struck again.

1313
01:04:44,934 --> 01:04:46,834
So, I took a job at
the hotel as Isaac,

1314
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:48,900
the room service waiter.

1315
01:04:49,033 --> 01:04:50,967
Were you there when
the embassy was being robbed?

1316
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,266
No, and by the time I got here,
it was too late.

1317
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,300
I spent the next two days
conducting my own investigation,

1318
01:04:57,433 --> 01:05:02,066
but I found nothing, so I was
going to return to France.

1319
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,700
Elias Lentini was going
to be my last delivery.

1320
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:06,467
What happened in that room?

1321
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,467
I was delivering food when
I overheard him on the phone

1322
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,700
in the next room.

1323
01:05:09,834 --> 01:05:12,633
He may have thought I had left.

1324
01:05:12,767 --> 01:05:14,967
He mentioned the tunnel.

1325
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,200
I was intrigued,
so I went to look.

1326
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:18,800
Lentini was alive when you left?

1327
01:05:18,934 --> 01:05:20,467
Very much so.

1328
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,233
I discovered the tunnel
and the box and I managed to

1329
01:05:22,367 --> 01:05:24,066
drag it to my locker
moments before Lentini

1330
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,734
came looking for it.

1331
01:05:25,867 --> 01:05:29,166
I suspect when Cypher
discovered the box was gone,

1332
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,367
he killed Lentini.

1333
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,200
Why didn't you return it?

1334
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:35,533
Because I knew that as long as
you were still looking for it,

1335
01:05:35,667 --> 01:05:37,700
Cypher would still
be looking for it.

1336
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:40,033
It was my only
chance to catch him.

1337
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:42,333
And you have no idea who
he is or what he looks like?

1338
01:05:42,467 --> 01:05:45,700
No. He is very good at his job.

1339
01:05:45,834 --> 01:05:48,066
What were you doing
in my room yesterday?

1340
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,633
I had seen you
snooping around in room 608

1341
01:05:50,767 --> 01:05:52,834
and talking to the FBI.

1342
01:05:52,967 --> 01:05:54,166
I wanted to know who you were.

1343
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,867
Agent Boucher,
before you continue,

1344
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,533
let's secure the documents, yes?

1345
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:01,033
Oui.

1346
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,867
I believe this is yours.

1347
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,200
I can go now?

1348
01:06:04,333 --> 01:06:05,934
You can and you should.

1349
01:06:06,066 --> 01:06:07,400
Cypher's going to figure out
that we have the documents.

1350
01:06:07,533 --> 01:06:08,900
Who knows what he'll
do to get them back?

1351
01:06:09,033 --> 01:06:10,967
But we still don't
know who Cypher is

1352
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,266
and we don't know who he's
working with at the hotel.

1353
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,767
We still don't know
who killed Elias.

1354
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,567
Chloe, I promise you,
I'm going to find out.

1355
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,433
You gotta trust me.

1356
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,834
I do.

1357
01:06:27,867 --> 01:06:31,367
We'll be keeping that vault
under 24-hour guard until

1358
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,967
the documents become
someone else's problem.

1359
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,433
It's a very good idea.

1360
01:06:35,567 --> 01:06:38,633
Agent Boucher,
I do have a question.

1361
01:06:38,767 --> 01:06:41,467
You said that you heard Elias
Lentini mention the tunnel.

1362
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,567
What made you think that that
was connected to the robbery?

1363
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,467
Gentlemen, perhaps we can
continue this later.

1364
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,934
The intelligence we had said
the tunnel was filled in

1365
01:06:49,066 --> 01:06:51,433
years ago, but if it hadn't,
it would make sense.

1366
01:06:51,567 --> 01:06:53,433
Wait, you knew
the tunnel into the embassy

1367
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,767
existed at some point?

1368
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,300
Oui.

1369
01:06:58,033 --> 01:06:59,300
I suspect the CIA
knows the layout of

1370
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:00,967
our embassies as well.

1371
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,600
So, you saw intelligence
that said that the tunnel

1372
01:07:03,734 --> 01:07:04,867
was partially filled in?

1373
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,934
Yes, a report from your...

1374
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:10,300
What do you call it?
Army Corp of Engineers?

1375
01:07:13,633 --> 01:07:17,600
Agent Maxwell,
perhaps we should take a walk?

1376
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:19,633
Excuse me.

1377
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,166
So, wait. That's it?
We're just going to go home?

1378
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,967
Yup, my days as a junior
detective are over.

1379
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,467
Thank goodness.

1380
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,767
But we still don't
know who killed Elias.

1381
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,667
Or what was in
that box we found.

1382
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,834
Or why Isaac
was speaking French.

1383
01:07:41,967 --> 01:07:43,700
Or do we know those things?

1384
01:07:43,834 --> 01:07:45,467
You know things! Tell us!

1385
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,533
I can't. It's classified.

1386
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:50,200
Classified? A couple of days
ago you were a travel writer

1387
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,000
and now you have some
sort of top secret clearance?

1388
01:07:52,133 --> 01:07:55,800
Look, all I know is that it's
being taken care of, okay?

1389
01:07:55,934 --> 01:07:57,633
Aaron is going to find
out who killed Elias,

1390
01:07:57,767 --> 01:08:00,734
and he can't do that
if he's worried about us.

1391
01:08:00,867 --> 01:08:03,734
I don't think we're
the ones he's worried about.

1392
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,500
I think you should
go pack your bags.

1393
01:08:08,633 --> 01:08:09,934
We have a plane to catch.

1394
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:16,233
Alright.

1395
01:08:19,133 --> 01:08:22,934
This is one of my favorite
places in all of Malta.

1396
01:08:23,066 --> 01:08:26,000
Madame Ambassador,
let's have a seat.

1397
01:08:26,133 --> 01:08:29,333
They wanted to keep their
options open. The tunnel.

1398
01:08:29,467 --> 01:08:32,867
They were going to demolish it,
but the Cold War was still

1399
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,934
fresh in everyone's minds
and they thought it might be

1400
01:08:35,066 --> 01:08:36,900
needed again someday.

1401
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:39,200
You worked with the engineers,
you filed a report saying

1402
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:40,734
the tunnel had been filled in.

1403
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:43,333
You made a few
incorrect assumptions

1404
01:08:43,467 --> 01:08:45,166
in your investigation.

1405
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,834
Elias Lentini did not find
out about the tunnels through

1406
01:08:47,967 --> 01:08:49,433
the hotel construction.

1407
01:08:49,567 --> 01:08:53,100
He only found out
about it a couple weeks ago.

1408
01:08:53,233 --> 01:08:55,233
When I told him.

1409
01:08:55,367 --> 01:08:58,767
I also told him
how to get into the vault

1410
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,433
and where to find
the lockbox with the documents.

1411
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,233
Why would you do that?

1412
01:09:03,367 --> 01:09:06,567
As you said, I know how to
get things done here in Malta.

1413
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,133
and sometimes that requires
things like bribes, kickbacks,

1414
01:09:10,266 --> 01:09:15,000
playing favorites with
independent contractors.

1415
01:09:15,133 --> 01:09:18,667
I believe everything I did
was for the right reasons.

1416
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,066
We helped a lot of people.

1417
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:25,667
Even saved a few lives,
but if anyone ever found out--

1418
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,166
So, you were
blackmailed by Cypher?

1419
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,333
I was contacted
a couple of weeks after

1420
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:32,834
Normand Duclasse was killed.

1421
01:09:32,967 --> 01:09:36,100
I was told to provide
Elias Lentini with

1422
01:09:36,233 --> 01:09:39,400
all the information that
he needed to do the job,

1423
01:09:39,533 --> 01:09:41,734
except for what
was in the lockbox.

1424
01:09:41,867 --> 01:09:43,066
He thought it was money.

1425
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:44,800
He thought he was
going to be rich.

1426
01:09:44,934 --> 01:09:47,333
You never actually met Cypher?

1427
01:09:47,467 --> 01:09:50,233
No, it was all
distorted phone calls

1428
01:09:50,367 --> 01:09:52,633
and encrypted emails,

1429
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:55,767
but Cypher said something
that led me to believe there's

1430
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,333
something else you
presumed incorrectly.

1431
01:09:58,467 --> 01:09:59,600
What's that?

1432
01:09:59,734 --> 01:10:01,433
I don't know if
it was on purpose

1433
01:10:01,567 --> 01:10:02,834
or a slip up

1434
01:10:02,967 --> 01:10:06,300
or maybe the plan was to kill me

1435
01:10:06,433 --> 01:10:08,066
before I had a chance
to tell anyone,

1436
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,066
but when I said that
the lockbox was heavy,

1437
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:15,433
Cypher said,
"Men are good for some things."

1438
01:10:23,433 --> 01:10:25,100
It's open.

1439
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,233
I heard you were leaving.

1440
01:10:28,367 --> 01:10:30,500
We are. I'm just cleaning up.

1441
01:10:30,633 --> 01:10:32,567
Housekeeping will get that.

1442
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,567
I know, it's just
it's a lot of stuff.

1443
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,967
You'd be amazed how much
they can fit on those carts.

1444
01:10:38,066 --> 01:10:40,567
Eager for me to be gone?

1445
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:43,300
Something like that.

1446
01:10:43,433 --> 01:10:46,467
The FBI still hasn't
told me who Isaac really is

1447
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,133
and what was in that
lockbox I saw them carry out.

1448
01:10:49,266 --> 01:10:50,734
I don't know.

1449
01:10:50,867 --> 01:10:52,500
Oh, I think you know plenty.

1450
01:10:52,633 --> 01:10:56,567
The question is how much
did you tell the authorities?

1451
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:57,667
You mean about how fast
you got to the hotel

1452
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,934
the night of the murder?

1453
01:10:59,066 --> 01:11:00,667
What do you mean?

1454
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,166
I know where you live.
There's no way you could have

1455
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,800
gotten here that fast.

1456
01:11:03,934 --> 01:11:06,800
I had already left
the house when I got the call,

1457
01:11:06,934 --> 01:11:09,200
but all this snooping
around makes things--

1458
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:10,633
Complicated?

1459
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,700
Extremely.

1460
01:11:12,834 --> 01:11:15,533
Well, my friends are
waiting for me downstairs,

1461
01:11:15,667 --> 01:11:16,800
so I really gotta go.

1462
01:11:16,934 --> 01:11:17,900
They can wait.

1463
01:11:18,033 --> 01:11:19,333
I really gotta--

1464
01:11:19,467 --> 01:11:20,834
Sorry, but I need to
tie up a few loose ends.

1465
01:11:20,967 --> 01:11:22,700
Housekeeping.

1466
01:11:22,834 --> 01:11:26,300
Oh. Um, sorry.
I thought you had checked out.

1467
01:11:26,433 --> 01:11:31,166
No, that's okay.
I'm on my way out.

1468
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,900
Thank you for staying
at the Hotel Optima.

1469
01:11:35,033 --> 01:11:38,233
We'll see you soon.

1470
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:40,433
Alright, let's do this.

1471
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,834
Thank you.

1472
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:46,834
I'll take that.

1473
01:11:46,967 --> 01:11:48,367
Thank you.

1474
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,600
Have a safe flight.

1475
01:11:57,767 --> 01:11:59,633
Alright.

1476
01:11:59,767 --> 01:12:01,100
Alright. Let's go.

1477
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:15,266
What is that?

1478
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,066
Elias' cufflink.

1479
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,734
I found it in his room.

1480
01:12:19,867 --> 01:12:22,133
The killer must have missed
it when they cleaned up.

1481
01:12:22,266 --> 01:12:23,900
I wonder how they did that?

1482
01:12:24,033 --> 01:12:25,233
Did what?

1483
01:12:25,367 --> 01:12:27,066
Well, when Isaac
was the main suspect,

1484
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,700
we thought he used
the room service cart

1485
01:12:28,834 --> 01:12:30,233
to clean up Elias' belongings.

1486
01:12:30,367 --> 01:12:32,033
Yeah, but Isaac
wasn't the killer.

1487
01:12:32,166 --> 01:12:34,700
Right. When Isaac left,
Elias was still alive.

1488
01:12:34,834 --> 01:12:37,066
So, the killer came later.

1489
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,800
So after what happened
in your room today,

1490
01:12:39,934 --> 01:12:41,567
you think it might be Bree?

1491
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:43,033
I think this falls squarely into

1492
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:44,800
the "not your problem
anymore" category.

1493
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,900
Excuse me.

1494
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:52,800
Hello. Aaron?

1495
01:12:52,934 --> 01:12:54,467
Chloe, hi.

1496
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,100
I just wanted to
make sure that you guys

1497
01:12:57,233 --> 01:12:58,600
got through security okay.

1498
01:12:58,734 --> 01:13:00,133
Yeah, we did, thank you.

1499
01:13:00,266 --> 01:13:01,367
We're in the lounge
waiting to board.

1500
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,967
Good, um...

1501
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:07,667
Hey, listen. Off the record.

1502
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,934
Thank you.

1503
01:13:09,066 --> 01:13:12,000
I wish I could have done more.

1504
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,133
Don't worry, okay?
We're going to get her.

1505
01:13:20,233 --> 01:13:21,967
Have a good flight.

1506
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:23,500
Her?

1507
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,767
I gotta go!

1508
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,000
- I'm sorry.
- What?

1509
01:13:29,133 --> 01:13:30,767
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1510
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,300
Chloe, go where?

1511
01:13:35,667 --> 01:13:39,100
Aaron, it's Chloe.
Listen, don't be mad.

1512
01:13:39,233 --> 01:13:40,533
I'm back at the Hotel Optima.

1513
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:42,800
I'm on to something. Call me.

1514
01:13:45,166 --> 01:13:46,800
Chloe!

1515
01:13:46,934 --> 01:13:48,967
Oh, Rianne.

1516
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,266
I thought you left?

1517
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,500
No, change of plans.

1518
01:13:51,633 --> 01:13:52,934
I need to find Agent Maxwell.

1519
01:13:53,066 --> 01:13:55,033
Oh, is he with the FBI?

1520
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:56,800
- Yes.
- Well, they're here.

1521
01:13:56,934 --> 01:13:58,433
- Really?
- Right now, in the basement.

1522
01:13:58,567 --> 01:13:59,800
Could you please
take me to them?

1523
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:16,700
Aaron?

1524
01:14:16,834 --> 01:14:18,100
Peter!

1525
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,700
Bree isn't Cypher.

1526
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:24,200
You are.

1527
01:14:35,266 --> 01:14:38,266
Oh. Oh, thank God.

1528
01:14:40,033 --> 01:14:42,100
Ooh, door's locked.

1529
01:14:42,233 --> 01:14:44,433
Bad timing, sweetheart.

1530
01:14:44,567 --> 01:14:46,567
You really should've
gotten on the plane.

1531
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,233
I was willing to
give you a free pass.

1532
01:14:48,367 --> 01:14:50,233
I appreciate that.

1533
01:14:50,367 --> 01:14:52,300
Especially seeing as
no one else got one.

1534
01:14:52,433 --> 01:14:56,100
Yes, poor Peter.

1535
01:14:56,233 --> 01:14:57,900
He was useful.

1536
01:14:58,033 --> 01:14:59,467
Until he wasn't.

1537
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,166
Actually, I had just
finished taking care of that

1538
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:06,500
and was leaving when
I saw you come back in.

1539
01:15:06,633 --> 01:15:09,633
Why did you let me go?

1540
01:15:09,767 --> 01:15:13,300
Well, you didn't really
know who I was, did you?

1541
01:15:13,433 --> 01:15:16,867
Although if this
is any indication,

1542
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,867
you did get closer
than anyone ever has.

1543
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,633
Remarkable, really.

1544
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:23,333
Thank you.

1545
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,333
Although I still can't figure
out how you convinced Elias

1546
01:15:27,467 --> 01:15:29,333
and Peter to help you
steal top documents?

1547
01:15:29,467 --> 01:15:31,967
I didn't.

1548
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,300
I convinced them to steal money.

1549
01:15:35,433 --> 01:15:37,233
They thought the lockbox
was going to be full of

1550
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:39,633
cash and jewels.

1551
01:15:39,767 --> 01:15:43,233
Yes, greed is
a powerful motivator.

1552
01:15:43,367 --> 01:15:45,633
Mm, no, no, no, no. Chloe.

1553
01:15:45,767 --> 01:15:47,500
This isn't quite right.

1554
01:15:47,633 --> 01:15:50,700
No, Elias didn't
know about the tunnel

1555
01:15:50,834 --> 01:15:54,133
and he didn't know how
to get into the vault. No.

1556
01:15:54,266 --> 01:15:58,633
I blackmailed the ambassador
into telling him all of that.

1557
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:00,467
Credit where credit is due.

1558
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,667
Well, what else did I get wrong?

1559
01:16:08,834 --> 01:16:11,967
Well, that's it.

1560
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,233
My letter of resignation.

1561
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:16,800
I'll have this
delivered to the President

1562
01:16:16,934 --> 01:16:18,300
in Washington tomorrow.

1563
01:16:18,433 --> 01:16:20,600
I'm very sorry,
Madame Ambassador.

1564
01:16:20,734 --> 01:16:25,100
Don't be. I should have told you
everything right from the start.

1565
01:16:25,233 --> 01:16:27,734
Some secrets are not
meant to be kept.

1566
01:16:38,834 --> 01:16:41,367
Well, well, your first case
and you've already taken down

1567
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,066
the U.S. ambassador.

1568
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,967
I always did the extra
credit in school.

1569
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,467
Yeah, I bet you cleaned
the whiteboards, too, huh.

1570
01:16:47,867 --> 01:16:50,200
Aaron, it's Chloe.

1571
01:16:50,333 --> 01:16:53,033
Don't be mad.
I'm back at the Hotel Optima.

1572
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:55,734
I'm on to something. Call me.

1573
01:16:55,867 --> 01:16:57,300
Problem?

1574
01:16:57,433 --> 01:16:59,467
Hypothetically. Come on.

1575
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,166
This part is correct.

1576
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,700
Yes, they set off
the alarm when they

1577
01:17:05,834 --> 01:17:07,166
were robbing the embassy.

1578
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:08,600
You see, we couldn't
get the box out

1579
01:17:08,734 --> 01:17:10,433
and we couldn't get it open,

1580
01:17:10,567 --> 01:17:14,166
but when Elias went
back to retrieve it,

1581
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:15,700
it was gone.

1582
01:17:15,834 --> 01:17:18,000
Isaac had removed it, right?

1583
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:21,033
Yes, in my defense,
I didn't know that at the time.

1584
01:17:21,166 --> 01:17:25,166
Naturally, you thought Elias
had double crossed you,

1585
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,533
so you killed him.

1586
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:27,867
Hm.

1587
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,734
And then you had
Peter move the body.

1588
01:17:29,867 --> 01:17:31,300
But what I can't figure out is,

1589
01:17:31,433 --> 01:17:33,066
why didn't you
move the body sooner?

1590
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,233
Sneaking a body out of
a hotel is a lot difficult

1591
01:17:36,367 --> 01:17:38,066
than you might think.

1592
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:41,900
It's not like we could just
wheel a cart out the front door.

1593
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:45,400
So, you had Peter
fake the check-out time

1594
01:17:45,533 --> 01:17:46,967
while you cleaned the room.

1595
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,633
Yes, but not very well,
apparently.

1596
01:17:49,767 --> 01:17:52,834
I was in a bit of a hurry.

1597
01:17:52,967 --> 01:17:54,700
And Bree?

1598
01:17:54,834 --> 01:17:58,367
Oh, well, we thought we might
need her access to override

1599
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:59,900
the system in
case of an emergency,

1600
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,633
and turns out we were right.

1601
01:18:02,767 --> 01:18:04,300
She knew nothing about it.

1602
01:18:04,433 --> 01:18:09,233
And so, when did you
realize that I was on to you?

1603
01:18:09,367 --> 01:18:13,100
Oh, well, you see,
I had Peter set up a little

1604
01:18:13,233 --> 01:18:16,233
a booby trap
on the hotel system.

1605
01:18:16,367 --> 01:18:21,100
It told me if anyone tried
to access Elias' room records.

1606
01:18:21,233 --> 01:18:24,700
I watched through the webcam

1607
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:26,233
while you and your ginger friend

1608
01:18:26,367 --> 01:18:28,400
broke into the computer
at the front desk.

1609
01:18:30,266 --> 01:18:32,934
So, it was you that
followed me that day.

1610
01:18:33,066 --> 01:18:35,467
Yes, I chased you
to scare you off.

1611
01:18:39,233 --> 01:18:41,200
And when I saw you that day
outside the cathedral?

1612
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:44,800
Yes, I was following you,
of course.

1613
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,266
Of course.

1614
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,266
Any other questions
before I wrap up the last

1615
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,066
of my loose ends?

1616
01:18:56,667 --> 01:18:57,800
Just one.

1617
01:18:57,934 --> 01:18:59,400
Hm?

1618
01:18:59,533 --> 01:19:02,700
How did you push
Elias off the balcony?

1619
01:19:02,834 --> 01:19:04,967
Ah, well.

1620
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,266
I injected him with this.

1621
01:19:08,633 --> 01:19:11,800
Ah, he never saw it coming.

1622
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:16,000
Well, I did.

1623
01:19:43,233 --> 01:19:45,667
Help! Help!

1624
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,533
Oh, Chloe, Chloe, Chloe.

1625
01:19:47,667 --> 01:19:49,800
Why didn't you just let it go?

1626
01:19:49,934 --> 01:19:52,433
Because Elias was my friend.

1627
01:19:52,567 --> 01:19:54,133
How noble.

1628
01:19:54,266 --> 01:19:56,333
I wonder if any of your friends
will be as tenacious when

1629
01:19:56,467 --> 01:19:58,900
trying to figure out
who killed you.

1630
01:20:01,633 --> 01:20:04,066
Alright, you, you. This way.
The rest of you follow me.

1631
01:20:09,133 --> 01:20:10,367
This way.

1632
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,500
Okay, wait!

1633
01:20:12,633 --> 01:20:14,500
Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry.

1634
01:20:14,633 --> 01:20:16,166
The poison works pretty fast.

1635
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,100
You'll be dead
before you hit the ground.

1636
01:20:18,233 --> 01:20:19,967
Wait! wait.

1637
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:22,000
I bet you regret playing
detective now though, don't you?

1638
01:20:23,967 --> 01:20:24,867
You know what?

1639
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:25,867
Mm-hm?

1640
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,667
Not even a little bit.

1641
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,500
Hands where wee can see them!
Now, now!

1642
01:20:29,633 --> 01:20:31,266
Now. Go, go!

1643
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,166
Go, go, go, go!
Hands behind your back!

1644
01:20:35,433 --> 01:20:36,300
You okay? Did she hurt you?

1645
01:20:36,433 --> 01:20:38,367
No, I'm okay.

1646
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,166
You are now a prisoner
under U.S. jurisdiction.

1647
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:42,000
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

1648
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:43,266
in a court of law.

1649
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,266
I'm guessing you got my message.

1650
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,300
I did.

1651
01:20:46,433 --> 01:20:48,233
I think I'm going to call you
Special Agent Day now.

1652
01:20:50,834 --> 01:20:52,066
Come on.

1653
01:20:53,934 --> 01:20:55,166
Bye, Chloe!

1654
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,533
Bree.

1655
01:21:15,533 --> 01:21:16,533
How are you doing?

1656
01:21:16,667 --> 01:21:18,600
As well as expected.

1657
01:21:18,734 --> 01:21:21,700
Well, I'm guessing this is

1658
01:21:21,834 --> 01:21:23,600
why you came into
my room yesterday.

1659
01:21:23,734 --> 01:21:26,500
I didn't want you
to leave with it.

1660
01:21:26,633 --> 01:21:29,333
If anyone found out
I gave this to you,

1661
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:30,700
it would cost me my job.

1662
01:21:30,834 --> 01:21:32,900
After everything
that's happened,

1663
01:21:33,033 --> 01:21:34,533
you still want your job?

1664
01:21:36,567 --> 01:21:38,133
This hotel is my life.

1665
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,567
Well, I truly wish you the best.

1666
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,800
I wish the same to you, Chloe.

1667
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,133
Making sure I'm really
leaving this time?

1668
01:22:00,266 --> 01:22:03,166
I was considering an armed guard
escort to the plane for you.

1669
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,767
What about you?
Are you headed back to DC?

1670
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:08,467
In a few days. I've got
some things to clear up here

1671
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,000
and then I'm going to head home.

1672
01:22:10,133 --> 01:22:12,567
What did your dad think
of you cracking the case

1673
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,066
and catching Cypher?

1674
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,767
Thing is I didn't. You did.

1675
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:20,166
I'll call that a team effort.

1676
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,800
You know we could
still talk about

1677
01:22:21,934 --> 01:22:24,600
getting that badge for you.

1678
01:22:24,734 --> 01:22:27,300
I think I'll stick with
travel writing. Thank you.

1679
01:22:27,433 --> 01:22:29,500
It's a lot safer.

1680
01:22:29,633 --> 01:22:32,300
Usually.

1681
01:22:32,433 --> 01:22:33,600
I should get going.

1682
01:22:33,734 --> 01:22:35,834
Okay.

1683
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,767
Thank you for believing in me.

1684
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,867
It's easy.

1685
01:22:53,033 --> 01:22:55,400
I'll see you at the next
international crime scene.

1686
01:22:57,367 --> 01:23:00,066
- Hypothetically.
- Hypothetically.
