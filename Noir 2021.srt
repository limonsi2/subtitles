3
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,023
This city.

4
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:16,889
What can I tell you about the city?

5
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:18,589
New York.

6
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:21,055
A place where the men work hard

7
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:23,122
and the dames well,

8
00:01:23,122 --> 00:01:24,521
they do what it is they do.

9
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:26,920
The lively city hides

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,588
the underbelly that runs

11
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,221
through the gutters

12
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,454
and the smoke filled streets.

13
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:32,621
That's where I come into play.

14
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,020
My name is Detective Sal Pelletier,

15
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,353
when I tell you I seen it all.

16
00:01:39,286 --> 00:01:42,386
I mean, I seen it all, from

17
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:43,985
the mobsters to the whores,

18
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:45,419
the crooked bankers to the killers

19
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:46,652
that hide in the shadows,

20
00:01:46,652 --> 00:01:47,551
waiting to strike

21
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,051
when an opportunity appears.

22
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:51,651
Sometimes I look out of

23
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:52,884
my window at this city

24
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,317
and then I look up at the sky

25
00:01:55,317 --> 00:01:56,984
and I see dark clouds,

26
00:01:56,984 --> 00:02:00,050
and all I can think is that God himself

27
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,283
is trying to hide this city

28
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:02,350
from his own eyes.

29
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,083
Oh, yeah,

30
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,583
I seen it all, alright.

31
00:02:08,249 --> 00:02:10,449
But tonight's story doesn't take place

32
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,615
in some mobster's warehouse

33
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:14,648
or some rundown bar

34
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:15,815
full of the unfortunates

35
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:16,781
of this great city.

36
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:19,048
Our story takes place

37
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:20,381
in the suburbs of New York,

38
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:23,579
a nice street, a middle-class

39
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,447
household with a perfect lawn

40
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:28,146
and perfectly respectable residents.

41
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,478
But as we know all too well,

42
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:32,646
darkness can hide

43
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:33,978
in the lightest of places.

44
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:37,212
So let me tell you about Veronica.

45
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:39,545
Veronica, Smart.

46
00:02:39,545 --> 00:02:41,845
Beautiful, intelligent,

47
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:44,111
but with a life that will be anything

48
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:45,178
but respectable.

49
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:48,110
Veronica was married to Cliff see.

50
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,610
They met when they were

51
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,942
just college sweethearts.

52
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,410
He'd done all right for himself

53
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:55,709
up in the high rises of work

54
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,042
with a love of a good woman at home.

55
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:01,142
But temptation can hide around

56
00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:02,842
any corner of this great city.

57
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:04,042
And Cliff.

58
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:06,441
Well, Cliff had succumbed

59
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:07,675
to the ways of a woman

60
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:08,674
who wasn't his wife.

61
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,207
So that's where we meet them.

62
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:14,240
That's where we meet her.

63
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:16,007
Veronica Smart.

64
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,173
Welcome to the world of NOIR.

65
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,523
I wish we could stay here all day,

66
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:26,623
locked away in our own private heaven.

67
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,289
Well, it certainly beats a cheap motel.

68
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:29,922
I'll give you that.

69
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:32,055
There is nothing wrong with a cheap motel

70
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:33,522
for a quick getaway.

71
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:35,522
It's got clean sheets

72
00:05:35,522 --> 00:05:37,688
and a firm mattress.

73
00:05:38,388 --> 00:05:39,221
As long as the water is hot

74
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:40,388
and the shower works, then

75
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:42,021
we don't need anything else.

76
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:44,020
Oh, Cliff, you know, the sorts

77
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,587
who check into an

78
00:05:44,587 --> 00:05:45,920
establishment like that,

79
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:47,720
as my mother would say,

80
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:49,586
they're not the respectable type.

81
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:52,253
Well, we are here in the house

82
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:53,186
perfectly respectable.

83
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:55,252
Well, sadly,

84
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:56,685
I've got to get back to work.

85
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:59,552
My boss can be a real tyrant.

86
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:04,451
Maybe if you ask him nicely

87
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:05,984
he'll give you the day off.

88
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:07,251
OK, Mr.

89
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:08,884
Smart, please, may

90
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:10,384
I take a leave of absence today?

91
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,883
Of course Miss Layton,

92
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:13,683
I'm sure you have

93
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,316
important business to attend to.

94
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:17,716
Very important and

95
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:19,882
very respectable business.

96
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,049
See, that's the problem.

97
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,082
Nothing about this is respectable.

98
00:06:25,582 --> 00:06:27,148
The surroundings may be tasteful,

99
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:28,248
but we both know.

100
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:30,514
What we have is a good thing.

101
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:33,181
A quick getaway to a motel,

102
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:35,247
a few stolen moments in the office

103
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:36,380
with the blinds closed.

104
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,913
We can't do it anymore Cliff.

105
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:40,080
Do what?

106
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,879
Stop acting like a fool, Cliff.

107
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,179
We both know that you're not.

108
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:44,412
I'm a fool for you.

109
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,245
It's not funny Cliff,

110
00:06:47,245 --> 00:06:49,212
nothing about this is funny.

111
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:51,011
You mean so much to me.

112
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:52,845
You know that, but

113
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:56,211
I can't break a vow I made to my wife.

114
00:06:57,577 --> 00:06:58,710
I think you did already.

115
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:02,177
I think we should end it now.

116
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,510
You go back to being my boss.

117
00:07:05,043 --> 00:07:08,109
I go back to my life, auditions,

118
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:10,142
and I can find somebody

119
00:07:10,142 --> 00:07:11,775
who loves me and only me.

120
00:07:12,775 --> 00:07:14,575
We can say hello,

121
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:16,075
go for the occasional

122
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:17,041
dinner with friends,

123
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:21,141
but that's all it could be Cliff.

124
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:21,941
I understand.

125
00:07:23,107 --> 00:07:23,707
I do.

126
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:27,607
I know you deserve more, but Lana,

127
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,306
I don't want to be without you.

128
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,873
Cliff, did you hear that?

129
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:32,439
What?

130
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:34,239
Cliff thats the door.

131
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,306
Someone's trying to come in.

132
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:36,905
Get behind the door.

133
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:38,339
What? The door.

134
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,305
Get behind the door.

135
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:41,338
I'm not hiding from your wife

136
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:43,038
like I'm some sort of shameful secret.

137
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,804
Sweetheart, you are a shameful secret.

138
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:45,238
Lana, please.

139
00:07:48,804 --> 00:07:50,837
Working hard.

140
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:51,303
I see.

141
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:52,470
My dear husband.

142
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,036
Sweetheart, baby.

143
00:07:54,036 --> 00:07:54,803
What are you doing at home?

144
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:56,469
Well, I could ask you the same question,

145
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,302
but I think you have to you, Mrs.

146
00:07:59,302 --> 00:07:59,636
Smart.

147
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:00,902
I just came to drop something

148
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:01,235
off to your.....

149
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:03,169
Oh, so you are aware he's married.

150
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:06,201
I did wonder whether you were clueless

151
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:08,035
or just a whore.

152
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:08,901
Mrs Smart,

153
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,034
this has never happened before.

154
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:11,601
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:12,534
What's your name?

156
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:17,933
It's Lana.

157
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,166
Please don't look at me like that.

158
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,399
We've all made mistakes,

159
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,166
and I'm sure that you've made a few

160
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,666
in your many years on the planet.

161
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,065
Let me give you a word of advice,

162
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:30,032
sweetheart, from me to you.

163
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:32,865
Looks fade.

164
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,164
I can see that, Mrs.

165
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:36,764
Smart.

166
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:45,363
Lana, maybe you should leave.

167
00:08:58,228 --> 00:08:59,594
Say something, anything.

168
00:08:59,594 --> 00:09:00,628
It's just...

169
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:04,360
It's just what, what

170
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,860
excuse are you going to throw at me?

171
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,560
We were just talking, I miss talking.

172
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,726
Feel like we don't do that anymore.

173
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,326
You don't want to hear about me?

174
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:13,259
Talk about us.

175
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:14,992
It's all auditions

176
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:16,725
or standing in line at some cattle call.

177
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,459
So this is my fault

178
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,625
because I have ambition?

179
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:21,691
I messed up.

180
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:22,391
That's on me.

181
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:24,691
It's just sometimes you

182
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:26,657
you feel so distant,

183
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:28,424
like something I can see,

184
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:29,957
but I just can't quite touch.

185
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:32,157
That, is for the cheap roll in the hay.

186
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:32,423
And that is for trying to put it on me.

187
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:36,023
I've told you Cliff,

188
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:38,389
I've told you for 16 years

189
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:40,689
that this dame has ambition,

190
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,889
that is what you married.

191
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:46,155
Sweetheart, listen to me.

192
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,655
I have been there for you.

193
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,554
I've loved you.

194
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:54,454
I've sdvoted my whole life to you.

195
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,654
I know,

196
00:09:56,687 --> 00:09:58,620
I know, look, I'm crazy.

197
00:09:58,986 --> 00:10:00,353
I should be locked in a loony bin

198
00:10:00,353 --> 00:10:01,153
for what I just did.

199
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:03,186
Well, what can I do to make this better?

200
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:04,219
Well, I'm on my knees.

201
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:05,886
A broken and sorry, man.

202
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:07,152
Begging for your forgiveness.

203
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:07,619
Get up.

204
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:10,618
I can't stand weak.

205
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:13,651
A cheap night is one thing, but weakness.

206
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:16,384
That is something I won't accept.

207
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:20,750
I can't bear to see

208
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,150
the disappointment in your eyes.

209
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:25,416
Men disappoint Cliff.

210
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:28,083
It's who you are by nature.

211
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:29,749
I shouldn't be surprised.

212
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:49,613
What about the promises

213
00:10:49,613 --> 00:10:51,013
you made me, huh?

214
00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:55,446
You're 40, Veronica and still no baby?

215
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,879
You son of a bitch!

216
00:10:57,612 --> 00:10:59,012
Maybe it's time to settle down

217
00:10:59,012 --> 00:11:00,312
and become a housewife.

218
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:02,411
A mother, you know, a respectable job.

219
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,144
A respectable job.

220
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:06,144
It's not a job Cliff.

221
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:06,378
What's so wrong about

222
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:07,611
being a housewife or a mother.

223
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:09,744
It's sure as hell a lot more respectable

224
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:11,177
than this silly, childish dream.

225
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:13,177
What did you just say?

226
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:15,743
You heard

227
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,376
and I ain't apologising for saying it.

228
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:21,675
Goddamn Veronica.

229
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:22,975
I thought this job at the school

230
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,375
teaching art would make you happy,

231
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,775
you seemed so excited.

232
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:28,875
Firstly, I don't start

233
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,008
until tomorrow, and secondly,

234
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:33,040
the only reason I took

235
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,640
this job was to get

236
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,407
me out of this goddamn house.

237
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:37,207
Oh.

238
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:39,306
As well as giving you more time

239
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:40,640
to bring your lady friends home.

240
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,640
Do you think I ever wanted

241
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,406
to be the kind of guy

242
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:43,506
who stepped out on his lady?

243
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:44,506
No.

244
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:46,406
But Lana listens to me,

245
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,005
she cares about what I have to say.

246
00:11:49,438 --> 00:11:50,138
Well that must have been

247
00:11:50,138 --> 00:11:51,072
wonderful for you.

248
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:53,571
Look, I have things that I need.

249
00:11:55,638 --> 00:11:56,871
The guys are always asking,

250
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:58,204
when are we going to welcome our own

251
00:11:58,204 --> 00:11:59,570
little bundle of joy in the world?

252
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:01,404
What am I supposed to tell them?

253
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,703
Where the hell are you going?

254
00:12:03,837 --> 00:12:06,503
I have come home to find you

255
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:08,269
in bed with another woman,

256
00:12:08,836 --> 00:12:10,436
and yet somehow you've

257
00:12:10,436 --> 00:12:12,135
managed to make that my fault.

258
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:13,569
I ain't blaming you, baby.

259
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:15,235
Make friends with the

260
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:15,968
spare bed tonight Cliff.

261
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,534
I have a feeling

262
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:20,034
you two are going to become very close.

263
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:20,734
Take your filthy

264
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:22,001
cheating hands off of me.

265
00:12:49,497 --> 00:12:51,764
Veronica, ain't the forgiving type.

266
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:53,663
They say hell hath

267
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:55,196
no fury like a woman scorned.

268
00:12:55,996 --> 00:12:57,463
Well, that saying

269
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:58,329
could have been created

270
00:12:58,329 --> 00:12:58,363
for Veronica herself.

271
00:12:58,429 --> 00:12:58,796
So

272
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:01,895
the next day, Veronica

273
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:03,095
would start a new job

274
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:06,628
teaching the kids in the ways of art.

275
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:08,695
When she walkd in the door

276
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:10,928
she sure as hell didn't look like

277
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:12,394
no teacher I'd ever seen.

278
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:16,960
Is that for me?

279
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:19,327
Yeah.

280
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,093
Good morning, class.

281
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:24,892
My name is Veronica or Mrs.

282
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:25,426
Smart.

283
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:27,192
Good morning, Mrs.

284
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:27,825
Smart.

285
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,558
Now I'm here to teach you

286
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:32,458
the beauty of the arts.

287
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:34,458
She was a piece of work, all right.

288
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:36,491
Jimmy was mesmerized.

289
00:13:37,157 --> 00:13:38,457
He was only one of a few.

290
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:40,190
She could have been

291
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,557
talking about anything,

292
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:43,090
but he wouldn't hear a word.

293
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:47,289
Who is this woman?

294
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:50,056
She's like a real life

295
00:13:50,056 --> 00:13:51,256
movie star in front of me.

296
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:53,755
I can't concentrate.

297
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:55,555
I think she knows

298
00:13:55,555 --> 00:13:56,488
that I'm staring at her,

299
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:57,455
but I can't look away.

300
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:00,721
It's like somebody pinned my eyes open

301
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:01,888
in only her direction.

302
00:14:03,554 --> 00:14:05,820
Her legs, her breasts.

303
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,987
The lashings of red lipstick

304
00:14:07,987 --> 00:14:09,120
illuminating this gray

305
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,186
and drab classroom.

306
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:12,786
I'm aroused.

307
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:19,252
I can't let her see.

308
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:21,118
Of course, she saw that.

309
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:24,085
S he's smiling.

310
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:25,784
Shit, she saw me.

311
00:14:27,317 --> 00:14:28,617
Who is this woman?

312
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:30,950
And James, isn't it?

313
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,017
What? Oh, yeah, James.

314
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:31,084
Well, Jimmy, OK, Jimmy,

315
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:42,715
what kind of art excites you?

316
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:47,148
Well, I think that art is all around us.

317
00:14:47,748 --> 00:14:49,781
An old lady selling roses on the street.

318
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:53,214
Rain on a humid day.

319
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:56,447
A beautiful woman.

320
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,447
A beautiful woman.

321
00:14:59,147 --> 00:14:59,846
Of course,

322
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:02,713
that might be the most exquisite

323
00:15:02,713 --> 00:15:04,213
work of art ever.

324
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:06,412
Who is this woman?

325
00:15:07,046 --> 00:15:08,012
She's beautiful.

326
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:09,112
She's confident.

327
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:11,545
She's everything that a girl like me

328
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:12,511
dreams of becoming.

329
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:15,011
I want to stare at her.

330
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:17,044
Like a gentleman would stare

331
00:15:17,044 --> 00:15:18,244
at an exquisite painting.

332
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:20,544
Oh, look at her hair.

333
00:15:20,977 --> 00:15:23,277
Her long hair that cascades down her back

334
00:15:23,277 --> 00:15:26,310
blonde, no golden.

335
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,243
I want to know her.

336
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:30,509
I want her to know me.

337
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:32,642
Who is this woman?

338
00:15:33,742 --> 00:15:36,242
And Vivian, isn't it?

339
00:15:36,508 --> 00:15:37,775
Yeah, I'm Vivian.

340
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:39,241
OK, Vivian.

341
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:41,308
So what kind of art do you like?

342
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:42,707
Vivian's art is about

343
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:44,007
as interesting as her.

344
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:46,340
You think it's OK to berate

345
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,973
a woman in front of her class?

346
00:15:48,673 --> 00:15:50,040
Now, let me tell you something.

347
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:51,740
There's only one thing

348
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,506
this world hates more than a crook.

349
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,906
And that is a bully.

350
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:58,572
Why don't you apologize

351
00:15:58,572 --> 00:15:59,972
to Miss Pierce here and pray

352
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:01,072
she's understanding

353
00:16:01,072 --> 00:16:02,038
enough to forgive you.

354
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,605
Sorry, Vivian.

355
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:06,304
It's OK.

356
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:09,171
Now, Vivien,

357
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:11,237
what kind of art do you like?

358
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,003
Oh, Vivian's just kooky

359
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:14,137
for the movie pictures.

360
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:16,170
Oh, hi, I'm Betty.

361
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,636
I'm Vivian's best friend.

362
00:16:17,836 --> 00:16:20,136
Well, it's lovely to meet you, Betty.

363
00:16:20,702 --> 00:16:23,669
So, Vivian, the movie pictures?

364
00:16:23,702 --> 00:16:24,202
Yeah,

365
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,002
but it's a world

366
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:27,935
so far away from us, ordinary people,

367
00:16:27,935 --> 00:16:30,501
that I'll never get to experience that.

368
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:32,467
And why do you think that?

369
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:34,134
Because we're nobody.

370
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:36,200
Well, I don't believe that's true at all.

371
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,733
Now, it's my understanding

372
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,033
that your previous teacher

373
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,133
gave you all the picture of a famous

374
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:43,233
painting to discuss.

375
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,599
So why don't we start there?

376
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:45,532
OK.

377
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:47,066
Well, I guess I just don't see it.

378
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:48,365
Don't see what?

379
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:50,298
Well it's nice I guess.

380
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:51,298
but it's kind of simple.

381
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:52,565
Why is it so famous

382
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:54,231
when many people can draw this way?

383
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:56,064
You think you could do an oil

384
00:16:56,064 --> 00:16:58,131
painting like Thomas Hart Benton?

385
00:16:58,197 --> 00:16:59,564
I'm not saying that I could,

386
00:16:59,797 --> 00:17:01,097
but I know others who could.

387
00:17:01,964 --> 00:17:03,897
Now, does anybody else have an opinion

388
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:05,195
on the painting?

389
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,363
It feels cold.

390
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:10,162
The towering skyscrapers

391
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,296
below a darkened sky.

392
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:13,762
The American flag

393
00:17:13,762 --> 00:17:14,929
blowing in the wind, but

394
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:17,162
the colors are muted.

395
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,261
I like the way it feels stationary

396
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:21,560
like the moment froze

397
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,127
and he painted that way.

398
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,961
It seems bleak, though,

399
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,260
but at the same time

400
00:17:26,294 --> 00:17:27,294
saying that the artist

401
00:17:27,294 --> 00:17:28,260
was seeing things that way.

402
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:29,893
Yeah.

403
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,493
Yeah.

404
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:33,159
Like he at that moment, maybe

405
00:17:33,926 --> 00:17:36,559
wanted to change or was battling

406
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,692
something within himself.

407
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:39,125
It shows that behind

408
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,725
the beauty of the city is a danger.

409
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:42,492
Maybe not everything

410
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:43,425
is as it appears to be.

411
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:49,657
Jimmy, Vivian, that was beautifully put.

412
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:05,855
Jimmy, Jimmy, you got to light?

413
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,155
Yeah, sure.

414
00:18:13,121 --> 00:18:14,287
You know, I really enjoyed

415
00:18:14,287 --> 00:18:15,154
your class today.

416
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,287
It's nice to have a teacher

417
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:18,387
that knows about the subject

418
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:19,120
that they're teaching.

419
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,853
Well, thank you very much.

420
00:18:21,886 --> 00:18:24,019
You know, you seem to understand

421
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,452
it quite well yourself.

422
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:27,885
Well, when you spend a lot of time alone,

423
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,085
gives you time to read.

424
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:32,485
Jimmy, can I say something?

425
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:33,318
Sure.

426
00:18:34,451 --> 00:18:35,818
Your eye for the arts

427
00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:38,384
is really rather extraordinary.

428
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,084
You seem to see things like somebody...

429
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:41,584
Older?

430
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,050
Older, yes.

431
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,850
Comforts me, honestly.

432
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:46,950
Sometimes I think

433
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,116
the real world can seem so.

434
00:18:48,116 --> 00:18:50,449
grey, so...

435
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:53,815
Noisy? Yeah.

436
00:18:54,715 --> 00:18:56,082
Yeah, exactly.

437
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:59,048
But well, if you look at a painting

438
00:18:59,048 --> 00:19:00,948
like Van Gogh's Cafe

439
00:19:00,948 --> 00:19:02,181
Terrace at Night, well,

440
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:07,047
colours the soothing yet

441
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,547
vibrant feelings that it gives you.

442
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:13,013
Well, that's my escapism.

443
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:16,246
What got you into art Jimmy?

444
00:19:16,246 --> 00:19:16,812
My mother.

445
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:19,245
I was just a kid.

446
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:20,545
I remember her

447
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:21,645
sat in the kitchen painting,

448
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:24,711
she used to always say that

449
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:26,311
the light in the kitchen was perfect,

450
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:28,511
and you must have good natural light.

451
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:31,910
I'd sit and watch her for hours.

452
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,010
I'd look at the bliss

453
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,610
on her face like she just

454
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:37,476
vanished.

455
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:40,043
Into her own magical world.

456
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:42,709
Well, you know, maybe that's something

457
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:45,142
you should take up for yourself.

458
00:19:45,742 --> 00:19:47,008
Live your passion.

459
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:47,941
I said, I loved art,

460
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,675
I didn't say I could paint,

461
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:51,241
and trust me, I can't.

462
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,074
Plus guys like me from this place.

463
00:19:57,507 --> 00:19:58,240
Well art exactly ain't In my future.

464
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:00,373
Where is your mother?

465
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:03,106
She skipped out on us when I was little,

466
00:20:03,106 --> 00:20:04,373
so I got stuck with him.

467
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,239
God, I'm sorry, it's your first day

468
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:10,938
here, and I'm troubling you with my woes.

469
00:20:11,638 --> 00:20:12,838
I found my husband in bed

470
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,138
with another woman last night.

471
00:20:19,504 --> 00:20:20,337
I'm sorry. I.

472
00:20:20,337 --> 00:20:23,103
I don't know why I told you that.

473
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,536
You know,

474
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:30,969
you're not like the women around here.

475
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:32,369
Jimmy, Jimmy.

476
00:20:33,002 --> 00:20:34,202
Hey, Jimmy, you ready to go?

477
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:35,502
Yeah, sure. I'm just talking to Mrs.....

478
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:35,902
Have you seen Vivian?

479
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,468
Not since class,

480
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:39,535
oh wait here she comes, control yourself.

481
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:41,734
Vivian you look as beautiful

482
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:42,201
as a bright summers day.

483
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:44,034
Shut up Riff.

484
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:44,901
Mrs Smart .

485
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:46,700
I really enjoyed your class today.

486
00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:48,000
It was very uplifting.

487
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:49,067
Uplifting?

488
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:50,966
Well, thank you very much, Betty.

489
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:52,033
Umm Mrs. Smart.

490
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,166
Can I just say that?

491
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:53,799
Wow.

492
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:55,732
You look like a movie star.

493
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:58,132
Well, so I've been told.

494
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,232
Actually I am an actress.

495
00:21:00,498 --> 00:21:02,465
What, like in the movies?

496
00:21:02,498 --> 00:21:03,098
Sure.

497
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:05,031
Well, only a few small roles,

498
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,231
but I have done many plays.

499
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:10,164
One critic once called me dazzling.

500
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:12,164
Dazzling. Wow.

501
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:14,363
That's my dream, to be somebody

502
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:15,563
that people talk about

503
00:21:15,596 --> 00:21:16,930
my face on the big screen.

504
00:21:17,196 --> 00:21:20,163
You would look magnificent Vivian,

505
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:20,263
a real bombshell.

506
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:21,796
Oh, you really think so, Riff?

507
00:21:21,796 --> 00:21:22,696
Sure thing.

508
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:23,462
Well, you know,

509
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:25,129
I was actually thinking about

510
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:26,395
perhaps teaching,

511
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:28,728
acting to people like you, young people

512
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:30,728
who you want to make it in the movies.

513
00:21:31,094 --> 00:21:32,228
Oh, this is smart.

514
00:21:32,228 --> 00:21:33,527
I mean, I would love that.

515
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:34,827
Well, money.

516
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,360
My mother. Oh, baby.

517
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,427
And I wouldn't dream of charging.

518
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:40,560
Everybody deserves a shot.

519
00:21:40,826 --> 00:21:41,293
Oh, Mrs.

520
00:21:41,293 --> 00:21:42,626
Smart, then I would love to.

521
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:43,626
Oh, you have no idea

522
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:44,693
how happy this makes me.

523
00:21:46,126 --> 00:21:46,626
How about you, Jimmy?

524
00:21:46,626 --> 00:21:49,692
You have a face the camera would love.

525
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:51,592
Really?

526
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:53,825
Well, I don't know

527
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:55,558
about all that acting stuff, but

528
00:21:56,391 --> 00:21:57,991
I'd sure love to sit and listen to

529
00:21:57,991 --> 00:21:58,757
you talk about it.

530
00:21:59,457 --> 00:22:00,291
Can I come, too?

531
00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:02,290
I'm a real movie picture fan, you know.

532
00:22:02,357 --> 00:22:03,923
Oh, well, sure.

533
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:05,823
Well, this sounds like a plan.

534
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:07,923
So why don't we say my place

535
00:22:07,923 --> 00:22:09,923
tomorrow night, say 7:00?

536
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:11,289
What will your husband say?

537
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:12,522
Well, he's working

538
00:22:12,522 --> 00:22:13,822
very late tomorrow night,

539
00:22:13,822 --> 00:22:16,022
so we'll have the place to ourselves.

540
00:22:16,055 --> 00:22:17,955
Well, I will be there with bells on.

541
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,288
Oh, maybe you could show me

542
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:21,788
how to make my hair like yours.

543
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:26,554
I think I would trade

544
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,154
in my best friend to look like you.

545
00:22:28,154 --> 00:22:29,387
Wait, What? Vivian Pierce, where are you?

546
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:30,653
Great! Mother.

547
00:22:30,953 --> 00:22:32,286
I was just talking to Mrs.

548
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:32,653
Smart.

549
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:33,819
She's my new teacher

550
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,486
and she's an actress.

551
00:22:35,886 --> 00:22:37,386
It's lovely to meet you.

552
00:22:38,352 --> 00:22:39,519
Charmed, I'm sure.

553
00:22:40,885 --> 00:22:41,852
Now, Vivian, Betty

554
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:42,818
let's go

555
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:44,385
we're having an early supper tonight

556
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:45,218
before your father heads

557
00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:47,184
off to work late, again.

558
00:22:47,518 --> 00:22:48,351
Mrs Smart .

559
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:50,551
I can't wait for us to begin our lessons.

560
00:22:53,983 --> 00:22:54,883
Mrs. Smart.

561
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,450
Boys.

562
00:23:02,282 --> 00:23:04,215
I don't think she liked me very much.

563
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:06,082
She doesn't like anybody,

564
00:23:06,415 --> 00:23:11,114
including her own husband.

565
00:23:11,114 --> 00:23:15,181
Poor schlep.

566
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:16,214
I'd always had problems

567
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:17,480
in the neighborhood where kids

568
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,747
like Jimmy and Riff lived.

569
00:23:19,513 --> 00:23:20,447
It wasn't the safest

570
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:21,613
of places in the town.

571
00:23:22,013 --> 00:23:24,446
Poverty was the word of the day,

572
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,112
the kind of place the rest of the town

573
00:23:26,112 --> 00:23:27,512
looked down on like a blemish

574
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:29,045
that wouldn't go away.

575
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:31,178
I think she looked at me today.

576
00:23:31,645 --> 00:23:32,745
Who? Vivian.

577
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,411
I swear she did, Jimmy.

578
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:35,145
She looked round

579
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:37,044
and for a moment, our eyes connected.

580
00:23:37,144 --> 00:23:38,711
I think you see what you want to see.

581
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:40,511
Trust me, I've known her for years.

582
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:41,610
You've known for years.

583
00:23:41,977 --> 00:23:42,844
When has she ever shown

584
00:23:42,844 --> 00:23:44,177
any interest in a guy like you?

585
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,410
What do you mean a guy like me?

586
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:46,576
What kind of crack is that?

587
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:47,910
No crack. It's cool.

588
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,709
It's just... It's just what?

589
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:50,543
Come on Riff,

590
00:23:50,543 --> 00:23:51,742
you've been loopy for Vivian

591
00:23:51,742 --> 00:23:52,642
since we were 10 years

592
00:23:52,642 --> 00:23:53,775
old, it's time to move on.

593
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,309
Go swivel Jimmy.

594
00:23:56,508 --> 00:23:57,942
Pair of aces.

595
00:23:59,675 --> 00:24:02,874
Damn it, man.

596
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,007
I can't concentrate.

597
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:06,007
My mind feels like cotton candy.

598
00:24:06,374 --> 00:24:08,040
I mean, it wasn't just me, right?

599
00:24:08,773 --> 00:24:09,573
Mrs Smart is...

600
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,773
A babe?

601
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:11,440
A doll?

602
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
Yeah, but it's more than that,

603
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,539
before you turned up

604
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:15,473
we were really talking.

605
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:17,206
Man.

606
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:18,539
She's like a hundred?

607
00:24:18,705 --> 00:24:19,972
No, Jesus.

608
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:21,905
She's like 40 I bet.

609
00:24:21,905 --> 00:24:22,805
That's a woman who's

610
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:23,838
seen a lot of things.

611
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:24,271
Yeah.

612
00:24:24,405 --> 00:24:26,204
Like the backseat in many a Chevrolet.

613
00:24:26,238 --> 00:24:27,304
Hey don't talk that way.

614
00:24:28,904 --> 00:24:30,837
You shouldn't talk that way about a lady.

615
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:33,837
She's taken Jimmy,

616
00:24:33,837 --> 00:24:34,670
did you not see the rock on her finger,

617
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,636
He's a deadbeat, he cheats on her?

618
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:38,470
Wait she told you this?

619
00:24:38,503 --> 00:24:40,136
Yeah, I told you we talked.

620
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:41,536
Damn it.

621
00:24:41,536 --> 00:24:42,836
I can't wait to see her tomorrow.

622
00:24:42,936 --> 00:24:45,869
Oh you are lost to the darkside

623
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:46,702
my friend. Darkside?

624
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:47,835
Women.

625
00:24:47,835 --> 00:24:48,502
And Vivien?

626
00:24:48,768 --> 00:24:49,968
It's Destiny.

627
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:55,867
Seeing her today just made me realise

628
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:57,167
girls, they don't know anything

629
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:59,267
about life, love,

630
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:01,866
sex... Sex.

631
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,700
You think you're going to be

632
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,166
playing backseat bingo with her?

633
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,299
No, you clown.

634
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:05,966
I'm just saying that

635
00:25:05,966 --> 00:25:07,066
today opened my eyes.

636
00:25:07,066 --> 00:25:07,799
I mean, come on.

637
00:25:08,765 --> 00:25:10,032
She's like something from a movie.

638
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,098
Well, Jimmy, as much fun

639
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:13,565
as it is, I really got to go.

640
00:25:13,598 --> 00:25:14,631
I'm going to miss the best time.

641
00:25:14,665 --> 00:25:15,065
Riff,

642
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:17,464
I can speak to my old man.

643
00:25:18,431 --> 00:25:19,831
See if you can stay with us.

644
00:25:19,831 --> 00:25:20,731
You don't deserve to

645
00:25:20,731 --> 00:25:21,697
be out on the street.

646
00:25:21,697 --> 00:25:22,530
You got to be able to...

647
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,697
I know, Jimmy, you've

648
00:25:23,697 --> 00:25:24,763
given me the same speech

649
00:25:24,763 --> 00:25:25,463
since the funeral.

650
00:25:25,463 --> 00:25:26,996
But I'm fine. Really?

651
00:25:27,263 --> 00:25:28,729
I got everything under control.

652
00:25:28,763 --> 00:25:30,563
Yeah, but I got this, Jimmy.

653
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:34,695
Sleeping down the docks again tonight?

654
00:25:34,695 --> 00:25:36,795
Yeah, I found this great old building.

655
00:25:37,062 --> 00:25:38,562
I share it with like 300 bats.

656
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:39,095
Shut up.

657
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:39,795
You hear that?

658
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:42,961
Oh, shit.

659
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:44,261
My dad's home. Jimmy!

660
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:46,594
So this is what happens

661
00:25:46,594 --> 00:25:47,294
when I'm not here?

662
00:25:47,527 --> 00:25:47,960
No.

663
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:49,260
You just thought you would

664
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,593
steal my cigarettes

665
00:25:50,793 --> 00:25:51,693
and act like a big man

666
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:52,493
when I ain't around.

667
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,126
I should go.

668
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:55,559
It's lovely to see you, Mr. Flynn.

669
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,392
May I say you are looking

670
00:25:56,392 --> 00:25:57,592
particularly rugged today.

671
00:25:57,592 --> 00:25:57,826
Get out!

672
00:26:02,492 --> 00:26:03,325
I'm going to go to my room.

673
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:04,191
Why?

674
00:26:05,758 --> 00:26:07,158
You scared of your old man?

675
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:08,924
No, sir.

676
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:09,524
I just.

677
00:26:09,524 --> 00:26:10,957
So you think you're a man now

678
00:26:10,957 --> 00:26:13,424
because you started smoking cigarettes?

679
00:26:14,557 --> 00:26:15,023
Go on.

680
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,123
Show me how much of a man you really are.

681
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:18,823
Leave me alone.

682
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:21,123
You know, we should put a dress on you

683
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:21,889
so anyone can see

684
00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:23,689
how much of a girl you are.

685
00:26:23,689 --> 00:26:24,355
Look at you,

686
00:26:25,755 --> 00:26:27,055
you dress like some rebel

687
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:28,555
but you,

688
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:29,988
you're as soft as a newborn

689
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:30,955
babies backside.

690
00:26:34,621 --> 00:26:35,587
Oh, wait.

691
00:26:35,587 --> 00:26:36,654
I need you down at the garage

692
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,287
tomorrow night,

693
00:26:37,354 --> 00:26:39,220
we've got two cars coming in

694
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,153
that need to be finished.

695
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:42,520
Sure.

696
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:46,519
Oh, no, I can't.

697
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:47,519
I've already made plans.

698
00:26:49,152 --> 00:26:49,619
Plans?

699
00:26:50,185 --> 00:26:50,985
You don't have plans

700
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:51,952
you're just a kid.

701
00:26:52,085 --> 00:26:53,152
I'm sixteen.

702
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:54,951
I'm sorry, Dad,

703
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:56,151
but I can't make it tomorrow.

704
00:26:56,918 --> 00:26:58,084
Oh, you will be there,

705
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:00,517
or you can pack up your stuff

706
00:27:00,784 --> 00:27:02,517
and see how you do out there on the street

707
00:27:02,517 --> 00:27:03,317
Dad please.

708
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:04,717
You are sixteen Jimmy,

709
00:27:05,383 --> 00:27:06,283
it's time to be a man

710
00:27:06,283 --> 00:27:07,483
and make an honest wage.

711
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:08,550
You can't expect me

712
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,683
to have you here living forever.

713
00:27:12,482 --> 00:27:14,515
Now, go to your room and stay there,

714
00:27:15,282 --> 00:27:15,882
I got a friend

715
00:27:15,882 --> 00:27:16,482
coming over tonight

716
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:18,315
and I do not want to be disturbed.

717
00:27:18,315 --> 00:27:18,915
A woman?

718
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:22,048
None of your goddamn business,

719
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:25,481
you don't even know what a woman is.

720
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,447
Now get out of my sight.

721
00:27:33,346 --> 00:27:35,013
Yes sir.

722
00:27:46,544 --> 00:27:47,744
At Vivian's house.

723
00:27:48,378 --> 00:27:49,811
Well, Vivian was brought up

724
00:27:49,811 --> 00:27:50,977
under the eyes of God,

725
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,977
a devout kind of family,

726
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,710
a cross on the wall

727
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,277
and a Bible on the nightstand.

728
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,710
But Vivian is a teenage girl

729
00:27:59,443 --> 00:28:00,909
starting to question things.

730
00:28:01,976 --> 00:28:02,909
I'm glad your mother

731
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:04,209
let me stay over Vivian.

732
00:28:04,342 --> 00:28:05,975
Oh, me too.

733
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,442
Plus, I know it's

734
00:28:07,442 --> 00:28:08,642
your father's cards night?

735
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:11,008
His friends give me the heebie jeebies.

736
00:28:13,774 --> 00:28:15,641
Betty, do you think I could ever look

737
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:16,740
like Veronica Smart?

738
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:18,407
Vivian, you've not stopped

739
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:20,073
talking about her since we left school.

740
00:28:20,107 --> 00:28:21,706
Sorry Betty, it's just

741
00:28:21,706 --> 00:28:23,106
I've only ever seen women

742
00:28:23,106 --> 00:28:23,906
like her in the pages

743
00:28:23,906 --> 00:28:25,239
of our celebrity magazine.

744
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:27,639
Imagine a woman like that.

745
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,405
Living right here in our town.

746
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:31,672
You sound screwy Vivian Pierce.

747
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:33,772
It's not like she's Lana Turner.

748
00:28:34,638 --> 00:28:36,638
Oh she was so perfect.

749
00:28:36,971 --> 00:28:38,638
OK, I'm officially ignoring you.

750
00:28:39,237 --> 00:28:40,337
Sorry, Betty.

751
00:28:40,704 --> 00:28:41,504
You are going to come to hers

752
00:28:41,504 --> 00:28:42,337
tomorrow, though, of course.

753
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:43,704
No way.

754
00:28:44,004 --> 00:28:45,470
My mother would flip her wig.

755
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,170
She thinks that actors

756
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,003
are lower than whores.

757
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,036
Her words, not mine.

758
00:28:50,403 --> 00:28:53,169
Well, I think your mother and my mother

759
00:28:53,202 --> 00:28:54,369
are the same person.

760
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:57,735
I'm going to brush my teeth.

761
00:28:58,068 --> 00:28:59,401
It's spearmint!

762
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,401
Oooh, I'm sorry Mrs Pierce.

763
00:29:05,634 --> 00:29:07,834
Now, Vivien, I need to talk to you.

764
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:09,400
Am I in trouble?

765
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:12,066
No, I'm worried about you.

766
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:13,133
And so is your father.

767
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,899
You come home from school and disappear

768
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:15,966
so fast to your room

769
00:29:15,966 --> 00:29:17,299
that we barely get a hello.

770
00:29:17,699 --> 00:29:19,565
I'm fine, mother, honestly.

771
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:21,099
It's just.

772
00:29:23,332 --> 00:29:24,265
Oh Vivian, it's just what?

773
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,431
Well, when did you first start

774
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:30,831
to get feelings for boys?

775
00:29:31,331 --> 00:29:33,564
You know, in the non friend way?

776
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,897
Vivian, you are too young

777
00:29:35,897 --> 00:29:36,830
to be thinking about that.

778
00:29:36,863 --> 00:29:38,663
I'm fifteen mother, please.

779
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:40,896
There is a time and place for a man

780
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,396
and that time is not now.

781
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:44,662
Do you want to end up like the neighbours

782
00:29:44,662 --> 00:29:46,629
daughter out all hours, drinking,

783
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:47,395
cavorting around

784
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:48,795
with every boy that looks at her?

785
00:29:48,862 --> 00:29:50,595
Sure sounds more fun than this.

786
00:29:51,195 --> 00:29:51,561
Look.

787
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:55,061
I know I sound harsh,

788
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:56,327
and I'm not saying

789
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:56,927
that when you're older,

790
00:29:56,927 --> 00:29:58,394
you can't make your own choices,

791
00:29:58,394 --> 00:29:59,993
but I have to guide you now

792
00:29:59,993 --> 00:30:00,727
so those choices

793
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:02,360
you make in the future are good ones.

794
00:30:02,793 --> 00:30:04,393
Worrying about boys and playing this

795
00:30:04,393 --> 00:30:05,393
kind of music is most

796
00:30:05,393 --> 00:30:06,593
certainly not a good one.

797
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:08,426
It's just music, mother.

798
00:30:08,626 --> 00:30:09,792
I don't think Satan plans

799
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:10,692
on coming through my record player

800
00:30:10,692 --> 00:30:11,659
to corrupt me.

801
00:30:12,658 --> 00:30:12,792
Vivian!

802
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:14,058
You are not too old to be put over

803
00:30:14,058 --> 00:30:14,725
your father's knee.

804
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:15,858
Sorry, mother.

805
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,091
You just need to say

806
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:20,091
your prayers before bed.

807
00:30:20,491 --> 00:30:21,224
Go to church.

808
00:30:21,557 --> 00:30:22,490
Study hard.

809
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,323
And then you can think about a husband.

810
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,690
But mother, if I'm too young to date,

811
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,123
surely I'm too young to think

812
00:30:28,123 --> 00:30:28,823
about a husband.

813
00:30:29,056 --> 00:30:29,523
Vivian.

814
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:30,856
Nobody likes a smart mouth.

815
00:30:30,856 --> 00:30:33,056
Now turn those records off

816
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:34,422
It's time for bed for you two.

817
00:30:34,422 --> 00:30:36,789
Oh no, five more minutes mother, please.

818
00:30:38,055 --> 00:30:38,922
Fine.

819
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:41,855
Five more minutes then bed.

820
00:30:41,855 --> 00:30:42,254
OK.

821
00:30:45,121 --> 00:30:47,387
Oh, sorry Mrs Pierce.

822
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:49,920
Oh Vivian,

823
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:51,220
I forgot to mention,

824
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,520
I think I know who was going

825
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,386
to ask you to the dance.

826
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:55,186
Do you think she would let me

827
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,286
try on one of her dresses?

828
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:58,619
Oh, I bet she gets them from Europe.

829
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:00,519
OK, good night, Vivian.

830
00:31:01,085 --> 00:31:02,352
Sorry, Betty.

831
00:31:05,518 --> 00:31:06,518
After catching Cliff

832
00:31:06,518 --> 00:31:08,018
and Lana in the sinful act,

833
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:10,017
something in Veronica changed

834
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:11,551
or maybe just brought

835
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:12,817
the real her to the surface.

836
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:15,883
Either way, the kids were so blinded

837
00:31:15,883 --> 00:31:17,316
by her, they wouldn't see anything

838
00:31:17,316 --> 00:31:18,883
the dame wouldn't allow them to see.

839
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:21,149
It's the evening after

840
00:31:21,149 --> 00:31:22,616
and Cliff is away with work.

841
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,749
Veronica, well Veronica

842
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:27,648
is dressed like a goddamn lounge

843
00:31:27,648 --> 00:31:29,382
singer, wearing a bright red dress,

844
00:31:29,815 --> 00:31:32,581
showing off all her killer curves.

845
00:31:34,714 --> 00:31:36,514
Anybody order a group of street rats?

846
00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:38,414
Speak for yourself Riff Randall.

847
00:31:38,414 --> 00:31:39,613
I am so pleased you could all make it,

848
00:31:39,613 --> 00:31:40,847
come in.

849
00:31:41,013 --> 00:31:41,613
Woah!

850
00:31:41,647 --> 00:31:42,646
You've got a real nice

851
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:44,013
pile of bricks here Mrs Smart.

852
00:31:44,013 --> 00:31:45,813
Oh, please call me Veronica.

853
00:31:45,813 --> 00:31:46,913
OK, Veronica.

854
00:31:47,212 --> 00:31:49,046
Now, who would like a drink,

855
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,912
something to get this party started?

856
00:31:50,945 --> 00:31:51,812
Alcoholic?

857
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:53,245
I won't tell anyone if you won't.

858
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,945
Then I'll have a beer.

859
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:56,145
How about you two?

860
00:31:56,145 --> 00:31:58,844
Oh, no, just a lemonade for me, please.

861
00:31:58,878 --> 00:31:59,811
Sure. You got whiskey?

862
00:32:00,111 --> 00:32:01,044
I do indeed.

863
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,977
So I heard your old man

864
00:32:02,977 --> 00:32:03,844
is stepping out on you.

865
00:32:04,277 --> 00:32:04,910
Riff, Jesus.

866
00:32:04,943 --> 00:32:06,243
No, it's fine, honestly.

867
00:32:06,777 --> 00:32:07,776
Men are pigs.

868
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:08,176
(Pig noises)

869
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:09,709
Mrs. Smart?

870
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:11,743
Um, I mean, Veronica,

871
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:13,742
your dress is so magnificent.

872
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:15,309
Oh, what? This old thing.

873
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:17,608
Oh, I would love a dress like that.

874
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:18,842
And your hair.

875
00:32:19,275 --> 00:32:20,975
How do you get it to look so glamorous?

876
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:22,274
Vivian.

877
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,741
Well, I think you have a beautiful face,

878
00:32:26,107 --> 00:32:28,740
stunning bone structure, and those eyes.

879
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,740
They could melt the heart of a sailor.

880
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,740
Oh, oh, oh.

881
00:32:33,073 --> 00:32:35,439
Ok Vivian, relax.

882
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:36,906
I could relax you, Vivian.

883
00:32:36,906 --> 00:32:37,606
Ewww.

884
00:32:37,606 --> 00:32:40,239
Do I see a little love connection here?

885
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:41,039
Flirtation?

886
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,205
No, you do not.

887
00:32:42,338 --> 00:32:43,772
Riff has been trying to get me to go

888
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:44,671
steady with him since

889
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,838
we're six years old.

890
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:47,371
He's not my type.

891
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:49,338
Maybe you don't know what your type is.

892
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:51,171
So how about you, Jimmy?

893
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:53,504
You got a lady in your life?

894
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,937
Girls my age aren't appealing to me.

895
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:57,436
I'm going to wait

896
00:32:57,436 --> 00:32:59,136
till after high school to find my girl.

897
00:32:59,303 --> 00:32:59,936
I see.

898
00:33:00,203 --> 00:33:01,236
Can I get another drink?

899
00:33:01,469 --> 00:33:02,802
Oh, sure, help yourself.

900
00:33:02,936 --> 00:33:04,536
But just don't let your parents know

901
00:33:04,536 --> 00:33:05,835
I'm letting you drink liquor.

902
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:07,069
Can I smoke?

903
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:07,802
Sure.

904
00:33:08,302 --> 00:33:10,301
As long as I can bum one from you.

905
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,934
Can I bum one also?

906
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:25,566
Here, Vivian, let me light it for you.

907
00:33:25,566 --> 00:33:27,299
I think I'll save this for later.

908
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:30,132
So, Jimmy, when you're alone,

909
00:33:30,532 --> 00:33:31,765
what is it you like to do?

910
00:33:33,598 --> 00:33:35,931
Listen to music, read books,

911
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:37,664
play my guitar.

912
00:33:38,464 --> 00:33:39,298
Oh the guitar.

913
00:33:39,598 --> 00:33:40,697
I play the violin.

914
00:33:40,964 --> 00:33:42,797
Oh really, well the violin,

915
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,197
the guitar, hell even the goddamn drums.

916
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,030
I think it's all wonderful.

917
00:33:47,263 --> 00:33:49,263
Hey, Riff, turn up the music.

918
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:50,829
Let's dance.

919
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:52,063
What? Here, now?

920
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:55,062
Here and now is all we have Jimmy Flynn.

921
00:33:56,362 --> 00:33:57,528
Veronica, Riff and Jimmy

922
00:33:57,528 --> 00:33:58,662
danced around the room.

923
00:33:59,462 --> 00:34:01,595
Veronica looked happy and the kids ate up

924
00:34:01,595 --> 00:34:03,194
that happiness with a silver spoon.

925
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:05,294
Jimmy played it cool,

926
00:34:05,861 --> 00:34:07,360
leaning on the cabinet of trophys

927
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,094
from her husband's college days.

928
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:11,159
It's rude to stare, Jimmy.

929
00:34:11,193 --> 00:34:12,327
I'm sorry.

930
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,393
The last man who stared at me

931
00:34:14,393 --> 00:34:15,759
that way, ended up laying

932
00:34:15,759 --> 00:34:18,159
beside me for the next 16 years.

933
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,759
She got him!

934
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,692
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.

935
00:34:22,692 --> 00:34:23,558
I'll clean all that up.

936
00:34:23,558 --> 00:34:24,824
It's fine, honestly.

937
00:34:24,925 --> 00:34:26,690
My husband, he breaks a lot of glasses.

938
00:34:26,891 --> 00:34:27,491
What's he doing?

939
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:28,824
Throwing them around the house.

940
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:31,956
In that moment, Veronica started to lie.

941
00:34:32,024 --> 00:34:33,590
Yeah. Sometimes he...

942
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,657
He what?

943
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:36,322
Never mind.

944
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,789
Marriage is tough kids.

945
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:43,289
You try so hard to

946
00:34:43,722 --> 00:34:45,188
to be the perfect housewife,

947
00:34:45,188 --> 00:34:46,188
and yet still it's

948
00:34:47,255 --> 00:34:48,355
it's never quite enough.

949
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:52,121
He cheated, many times I suspect,

950
00:34:53,321 --> 00:34:54,721
he didn't even apologize.

951
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:55,587
He just said that

952
00:34:56,687 --> 00:34:57,887
the man's got to do

953
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,820
what a man's got to do.

954
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:01,520
That's what he said.

955
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,253
Listen to me bringing the party down.

956
00:35:05,786 --> 00:35:07,119
I'm so sorry whilst

957
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,686
we are here in this house.

958
00:35:09,052 --> 00:35:10,885
Let's forget all the bad in our lives

959
00:35:10,885 --> 00:35:12,852
and just focus on the good.

960
00:35:13,385 --> 00:35:16,518
Oh, Veronica, I just wanted to ask,

961
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:17,951
what movies have you starred in?

962
00:35:17,984 --> 00:35:19,951
Did you see Hunt for Love

963
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,317
with Cary Grant?

964
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:23,217
Oh, I love that movie.

965
00:35:23,317 --> 00:35:24,617
Well, I was the nurse

966
00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:26,583
who got him back to health.

967
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,816
So you met him?

968
00:35:28,816 --> 00:35:30,883
Darling, met him? We're friends,

969
00:35:30,883 --> 00:35:32,483
we bonded over our love

970
00:35:32,483 --> 00:35:33,882
for the silent movies.

971
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:34,782
Oh, Vivian.

972
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:37,082
The stories I could tell you.

973
00:35:37,115 --> 00:35:38,782
Oh, I would love to hear them.

974
00:35:39,482 --> 00:35:42,281
So, Jimmy, you got a talent?

975
00:35:42,648 --> 00:35:43,814
Boosting cars?

976
00:35:43,814 --> 00:35:45,048
Mmm, a bad boy?

977
00:35:45,048 --> 00:35:46,114
I prefer rebel.

978
00:35:46,181 --> 00:35:47,081
You have ice?

979
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:48,280
Sure it's in the kitchen.

980
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:49,114
Help yourself.

981
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:51,047
Vivian why don't you help

982
00:35:51,047 --> 00:35:52,280
Riff with the ice

983
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,446
and maybe bring in some snacks?

984
00:35:54,913 --> 00:35:55,679
Sure thing.

985
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:57,612
Veronica, why us?

986
00:35:58,712 --> 00:35:59,646
What do you mean Riff?

987
00:35:59,746 --> 00:36:01,379
Why would you want to be friends with us?

988
00:36:01,412 --> 00:36:01,679
I mean,

989
00:36:01,812 --> 00:36:03,612
you're a beautiful, wealthy woman.

990
00:36:03,812 --> 00:36:06,145
We're hardly your usual crowd.

991
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:07,944
Honestly,

992
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:10,677
I never really fit in around here.

993
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,210
Housewives, they look

994
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,243
at me like I'm trash and the men

995
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:17,843
look at me with lustful eyes.

996
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,543
I guess

997
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:21,843
I just needed a change

998
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:22,742
of energy around me.

999
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:27,475
You know,

1000
00:36:27,475 --> 00:36:28,908
you have a really neat set of records.

1001
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:29,908
Oh, thanks.

1002
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,808
My husband hates them of course.

1003
00:36:33,374 --> 00:36:34,274
He's not really that big

1004
00:36:34,274 --> 00:36:37,840
into the music or movies or art.

1005
00:36:38,374 --> 00:36:39,407
He's a bit square when it comes

1006
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:40,074
to those things.

1007
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,540
You like this one?

1008
00:36:42,607 --> 00:36:43,106
Sure.

1009
00:36:50,172 --> 00:36:51,539
Tell me more about you, Jimmy.

1010
00:36:53,738 --> 00:36:54,605
What do you want to know?

1011
00:36:55,805 --> 00:36:56,405
Everything.

1012
00:36:59,104 --> 00:37:00,871
Well, I'm 16,

1013
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:03,104
but I think I'm more mature my age.

1014
00:37:05,937 --> 00:37:09,003
I ride a motorcycle.

1015
00:37:10,303 --> 00:37:11,436
So, are you going to come over here

1016
00:37:11,436 --> 00:37:12,802
and dance with me

1017
00:37:12,802 --> 00:37:14,702
or you just going to leave

1018
00:37:14,702 --> 00:37:17,402
this girl dancing all by herself.

1019
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:23,801
I love to dance.

1020
00:37:24,168 --> 00:37:25,134
I love to dance with a man

1021
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:26,934
who loves to dance.

1022
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:30,000
It's been a long time.

1023
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:31,700
Forgive me for saying

1024
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,033
but why not just ditch the loser

1025
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:35,399
if he ain't keeping your engine running?

1026
00:37:35,899 --> 00:37:38,166
Oh, Jimmy, it's not as simple as that.

1027
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:40,465
Let's just forget about him.

1028
00:37:41,532 --> 00:37:42,565
Let's just pretend that

1029
00:37:43,298 --> 00:37:46,265
nobody in the whole world is around.

1030
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,898
We just keep on dancing.

1031
00:37:50,198 --> 00:37:51,164
Your smell it's.

1032
00:37:51,164 --> 00:37:51,497
It's

1033
00:37:53,997 --> 00:37:55,164
quite intoxicating.

1034
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,430
You smell of cigarette

1035
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,096
smoke, liquor and

1036
00:38:00,563 --> 00:38:01,329
engine fumes.

1037
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:02,229
I'm sorry.

1038
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:07,429
Don't be, I love that smell.

1039
00:38:08,295 --> 00:38:10,495
Jimmy, when you go out on your bike

1040
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:12,261
where is it you go to?

1041
00:38:13,728 --> 00:38:14,628
I know a spot

1042
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,494
out by the woods near the cemetery.

1043
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:18,494
It's quiet.

1044
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:20,760
Gives me time to think

1045
00:38:21,893 --> 00:38:24,460
Maybe I need a spot like that.

1046
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,326
I can take you to mine.

1047
00:38:26,026 --> 00:38:27,793
On your bike?

1048
00:38:27,793 --> 00:38:28,292
Sure.

1049
00:38:29,326 --> 00:38:31,425
You could hop on and hold on.

1050
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:33,758
We could go now.

1051
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:35,791
Oh, Jimmy I'd love to.

1052
00:38:36,025 --> 00:38:37,091
We could come with you.

1053
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:39,491
I have my car, I could drive us over.

1054
00:38:39,724 --> 00:38:41,224
Well, sure. I mean, why not?

1055
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:42,257
The more the merrier.

1056
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:44,857
Looks like tonight's

1057
00:38:44,857 --> 00:38:46,290
going to be quite an adventure.

1058
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:47,057
Jimmy Flynn.

1059
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:52,523
After a night of fun

1060
00:38:52,523 --> 00:38:54,622
with her new friends, the next day,

1061
00:38:55,122 --> 00:38:56,689
a Saturday, Veronica

1062
00:38:56,689 --> 00:38:58,022
travelled into the city to pay

1063
00:38:58,022 --> 00:38:58,855
a visit to Cliff

1064
00:38:59,722 --> 00:39:01,088
with a surprise for her sweetheart.

1065
00:39:01,521 --> 00:39:03,321
She had the perfect guise to see

1066
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:04,721
if Cliff was a man of his word.

1067
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:06,754
Good morning Mrs Smart.

1068
00:39:06,754 --> 00:39:08,420
Good to see you Mrs Smart.

1069
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,054
He's in his office Mrs Smart.

1070
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,253
Maybe I didn't make myself clear Cliff.

1071
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:15,786
Sweetheart.

1072
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:17,119
Baby, what are you doing here?

1073
00:39:17,186 --> 00:39:18,319
Oh, I had something to

1074
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:19,519
attend to in the city,

1075
00:39:20,086 --> 00:39:21,585
so I thought I'd bring you a gift.

1076
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:23,818
This is just work Veronica,

1077
00:39:23,818 --> 00:39:25,485
you think I'd fool around in my office?

1078
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:26,618
I don't know, Cliff.

1079
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:28,384
I didn't expect you

1080
00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:29,884
to fool around in our bedroom,

1081
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:32,417
but you proved me wrong on that one.

1082
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:33,217
Mrs Smart.

1083
00:39:33,684 --> 00:39:35,484
I understand what I did was wrong,

1084
00:39:35,484 --> 00:39:37,317
but I assure you

1085
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,950
I don't want your husband.

1086
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,416
You are acting crazy.

1087
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,483
Oh, is that so?

1088
00:39:41,483 --> 00:39:44,682
And you are acting like a desperate fool.

1089
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,182
Did I not tell you to get rid of her?

1090
00:39:47,415 --> 00:39:48,515
Excuse me.

1091
00:39:49,482 --> 00:39:50,848
She's leaving at the end of the week.

1092
00:39:50,915 --> 00:39:52,448
This is just work, Veronica.

1093
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,114
You really expect me

1094
00:39:54,114 --> 00:39:56,014
to believe that this thing

1095
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,180
will be gone by the end of the week?

1096
00:39:58,647 --> 00:39:59,414
That's right, Mrs.

1097
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:00,014
Smart.

1098
00:40:00,614 --> 00:40:02,880
This "thing" handed in her notice today.

1099
00:40:03,613 --> 00:40:03,880
It's

1100
00:40:05,346 --> 00:40:06,413
true baby, Lana's an actress.

1101
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:07,846
She's been auditioning

1102
00:40:07,846 --> 00:40:09,179
for new plays on Broadway.

1103
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:10,379
And I found out today

1104
00:40:10,379 --> 00:40:11,645
that I got a part in the new

1105
00:40:11,645 --> 00:40:12,812
Eugene O'Neill play.

1106
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:15,512
I leave in a week for two out of town

1107
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:17,511
tryouts, then Broadway.

1108
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:19,044
Baby.

1109
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:20,744
Isn't that exciting?

1110
00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:21,477
Lana,

1111
00:40:22,744 --> 00:40:24,910
I need to have a talk with my husband.

1112
00:40:26,143 --> 00:40:27,943
Of course, Mrs Smart.

1113
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,076
Honestly, I...

1114
00:40:29,076 --> 00:40:29,810
Out!

1115
00:40:34,442 --> 00:40:35,642
She's, she's leaving

1116
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:36,709
at the end of the week,

1117
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:37,709
why fire the girl

1118
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:39,075
if she is going anyway.

1119
00:40:39,775 --> 00:40:40,775
She's an actress?

1120
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:42,841
Yeah, baby.

1121
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:44,974
Oh, like you.

1122
00:40:46,141 --> 00:40:47,707
Maybe she could put a word in for you.

1123
00:40:48,507 --> 00:40:49,707
You want your mistress

1124
00:40:49,707 --> 00:40:51,507
to put a good word in for your wife.

1125
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,906
Are you hearing yourself, Cliff?

1126
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,406
I'm just thinking of you, baby.

1127
00:40:56,506 --> 00:40:57,673
You know, Cliff,

1128
00:40:58,073 --> 00:40:59,139
for such a big shot,

1129
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:01,705
you really are stupid.

1130
00:41:05,105 --> 00:41:06,771
You're attracted to her because.

1131
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:11,004
She's me 16 years ago.

1132
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:12,271
Baby that ain't true,

1133
00:41:12,271 --> 00:41:13,637
she can't hold a candle to you.

1134
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,670
It is Cliff, she's living my life.

1135
00:41:17,403 --> 00:41:19,803
She gets to be the big star

1136
00:41:19,803 --> 00:41:22,369
while I'm stuck here teaching

1137
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:24,269
kids to do what I should be doing.

1138
00:41:25,602 --> 00:41:27,069
God damn you Cliff,

1139
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:29,402
you really know how to hurt a lady.

1140
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:32,168
Well, I ain't trying to...

1141
00:41:32,168 --> 00:41:32,801
Don't.

1142
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:34,801
Just don't Cliff.

1143
00:41:36,334 --> 00:41:37,301
I hurt too much.

1144
00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:39,200
Well,

1145
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:42,800
what can I do, you want me to tell her

1146
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,800
to leave right this moment

1147
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,433
because I'll do it?

1148
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:46,766
No, no Cliff.

1149
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:50,099
Let your floozy stick around,

1150
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:52,499
because the only thing I want.

1151
00:41:53,865 --> 00:41:57,731
Is the last 16 years of my life back.

1152
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,297
Don't talk that way.

1153
00:42:09,596 --> 00:42:10,963
When I was a little girl,

1154
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,662
I used to dream about what

1155
00:42:13,662 --> 00:42:14,929
my life would be like.

1156
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:17,895
One thing I knew for certain.

1157
00:42:19,528 --> 00:42:22,428
Was that I wanted to be somebody?

1158
00:42:25,261 --> 00:42:26,494
I wanted more than

1159
00:42:27,527 --> 00:42:30,294
those four dark, damp walls that trapped

1160
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,360
me as a child and I wanted more than

1161
00:42:33,826 --> 00:42:35,060
my mother's loneliness

1162
00:42:35,826 --> 00:42:36,893
and disappointment.

1163
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:40,626
I just knew I needed more.

1164
00:42:43,492 --> 00:42:45,325
I would dance around in my room.

1165
00:42:46,258 --> 00:42:48,225
Arms extended, imagining I was

1166
00:42:49,158 --> 00:42:50,258
I was up on a stage,

1167
00:42:50,258 --> 00:42:52,691
a vaudeville show or movie

1168
00:42:52,691 --> 00:42:54,057
picture, I didn't care.

1169
00:42:56,557 --> 00:42:57,890
I just knew I needed more.

1170
00:42:59,923 --> 00:43:00,790
And then I met you.

1171
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:05,056
Happiest day in my whole entire life.

1172
00:43:05,956 --> 00:43:07,189
And I thought to myself.

1173
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:10,088
Could this be my more

1174
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:13,954
to be this handsome man's wife

1175
00:43:15,021 --> 00:43:17,321
and I thought and thought.

1176
00:43:18,787 --> 00:43:20,087
And as much as I loved you,

1177
00:43:20,087 --> 00:43:22,387
I knew I just couldn't

1178
00:43:22,387 --> 00:43:23,886
give up on that part of my dream

1179
00:43:25,286 --> 00:43:25,920
with you.

1180
00:43:27,153 --> 00:43:28,719
You said all the right things

1181
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:29,752
to ease my mind.

1182
00:43:32,085 --> 00:43:32,852
Do you remember,

1183
00:43:33,818 --> 00:43:35,152
do you remember what you said to me

1184
00:43:35,152 --> 00:43:36,351
when we first got together Cliff?

1185
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:39,584
I said I could make you happy.

1186
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:42,351
You said that

1187
00:43:43,784 --> 00:43:46,517
my dreams, my ambitions

1188
00:43:46,517 --> 00:43:48,883
would always be as important as yours,

1189
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:50,816
that we would help each other

1190
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:53,116
and support each other in it.

1191
00:43:53,116 --> 00:43:56,116
I remember thinking perfect.

1192
00:43:57,349 --> 00:43:58,415
Now I can be whole.

1193
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:03,081
But you never, never

1194
00:44:03,281 --> 00:44:04,648
helped me or supported me,

1195
00:44:04,648 --> 00:44:06,381
not in any way that matters,

1196
00:44:07,614 --> 00:44:09,614
because you thought that eventually

1197
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,213
I'd give up on that part of my life.

1198
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,846
And I would just learn to be silent

1199
00:44:17,413 --> 00:44:19,879
and just become your wife.

1200
00:44:21,312 --> 00:44:23,512
Baby that ain't true.

1201
00:44:26,345 --> 00:44:27,045
It is Cliff.

1202
00:44:28,645 --> 00:44:30,178
When have you ever taken me Hollywood?

1203
00:44:31,644 --> 00:44:32,911
I have been asking you

1204
00:44:32,911 --> 00:44:35,610
for 16 years, but still

1205
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:37,843
you've never taken me.

1206
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:39,743
Baby, you don't need

1207
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:40,943
Hollywood to be a star.

1208
00:44:40,976 --> 00:44:41,909
I know that.

1209
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:44,709
But I need it to make me one.

1210
00:44:46,509 --> 00:44:48,942
Jesus, how the hell did I end up here?

1211
00:44:49,942 --> 00:44:50,308
Now.

1212
00:44:51,342 --> 00:44:52,475
Just stop that.

1213
00:44:52,475 --> 00:44:54,174
This ain't a bad life

1214
00:44:54,174 --> 00:44:55,441
you got for yourself here, Veronica.

1215
00:44:55,508 --> 00:44:56,208
Oh, Cliff.

1216
00:44:57,774 --> 00:44:59,807
These past few days have just confirmed

1217
00:44:59,807 --> 00:45:01,807
everything that I already knew.

1218
00:45:04,306 --> 00:45:06,106
You don't want me to have my more.

1219
00:45:08,106 --> 00:45:10,639
But you sure as hell want to have yours.

1220
00:45:14,738 --> 00:45:15,438
So that's it.

1221
00:45:15,805 --> 00:45:17,138
We even gonna talk?

1222
00:45:17,138 --> 00:45:17,971
Not now, Cliff.

1223
00:45:18,871 --> 00:45:21,271
I may say something that I truly regret.

1224
00:45:23,737 --> 00:45:24,104
Well.

1225
00:45:25,704 --> 00:45:26,637
Will, I see you at home later?

1226
00:45:28,503 --> 00:45:31,003
Go for a long walk after work tonight.

1227
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:32,936
Maybe a couple of drinks,

1228
00:45:33,803 --> 00:45:35,536
because I really need some time

1229
00:45:35,536 --> 00:45:38,135
to figure out what it is that I want.

1230
00:45:54,966 --> 00:45:55,900
It ain't no mystery

1231
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,399
that the youths who live in the slum

1232
00:45:57,399 --> 00:45:58,899
side of town lived a life of risk.

1233
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:00,799
Some of the kids like Riff

1234
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:01,999
didn't live with their parents.

1235
00:46:02,232 --> 00:46:03,165
For them it is the street.

1236
00:46:03,832 --> 00:46:04,532
Some have to work

1237
00:46:04,532 --> 00:46:05,532
their fingers to the bone,

1238
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:07,731
sacrificing an education to pitch in.

1239
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:09,798
Sure, the boys had a few run

1240
00:46:09,798 --> 00:46:11,031
ins with the law, but

1241
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:12,264
it was petty stuff, mainly

1242
00:46:12,464 --> 00:46:14,197
just to put a hot meal inside them.

1243
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:15,730
But these were good kids,

1244
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,997
living in surroundings that could easily

1245
00:46:17,997 --> 00:46:19,196
take them down the wrong path.

1246
00:46:20,196 --> 00:46:21,729
That night, Jimmy

1247
00:46:21,729 --> 00:46:22,996
joined Riff by the Docks,

1248
00:46:23,696 --> 00:46:24,696
a regular hangout

1249
00:46:25,262 --> 00:46:27,095
for the undesirables of the city.

1250
00:46:36,328 --> 00:46:37,261
So what you get?

1251
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,160
Two bucks and a coupon

1252
00:46:39,327 --> 00:46:40,927
for canned meat.

1253
00:46:40,927 --> 00:46:42,793
Damn it Jimmy, I can't keep doing this.

1254
00:46:42,793 --> 00:46:43,360
Doing what?

1255
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,426
Pickpocketing, breaking

1256
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,393
into people's houses.

1257
00:46:45,493 --> 00:46:46,759
Well you know what to do Riff.

1258
00:46:46,759 --> 00:46:48,626
I can't stay with you.

1259
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:50,492
I ain't going to be a burden to nobody.

1260
00:46:50,759 --> 00:46:51,792
Riff you ain't no burden,

1261
00:46:52,659 --> 00:46:53,559
your my best friend.

1262
00:46:53,592 --> 00:46:54,892
I want to help.

1263
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:55,625
Jimmy, your old man can

1264
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:56,725
barely afford to keep you,

1265
00:46:56,725 --> 00:46:57,391
he ain't looking for

1266
00:46:57,391 --> 00:46:58,658
no new kid in the house.

1267
00:47:01,957 --> 00:47:03,891
I gotta have a future Jimmy, I just gotta.

1268
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:05,457
This can't be it.

1269
00:47:05,457 --> 00:47:07,123
I know just how you feel Riff, but.

1270
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:10,456
Well, that's a problem for another day.

1271
00:47:10,723 --> 00:47:13,489
No, it ain't, we're sixteen now Jimmy

1272
00:47:13,489 --> 00:47:14,889
there's a whole world

1273
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:16,389
out there, opportunities you know.

1274
00:47:16,389 --> 00:47:18,155
Sure thing Riff, but that's a whole world

1275
00:47:18,155 --> 00:47:19,588
you and I ain't ever going to see.

1276
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:20,922
Don't say that.

1277
00:47:28,954 --> 00:47:29,787
It's been one year

1278
00:47:29,954 --> 00:47:31,287
since my parents die.

1279
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,053
Jeez.

1280
00:47:38,386 --> 00:47:39,452
I didn't even realise.

1281
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:43,352
I'm sorry.

1282
00:47:45,252 --> 00:47:46,518
One year since the fire.

1283
00:47:49,418 --> 00:47:51,251
God, that one moment in my life

1284
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:53,051
and I lost everything.

1285
00:47:56,417 --> 00:47:56,917
You know.

1286
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:00,483
You are my family.

1287
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:01,683
I know.

1288
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:03,149
I mean, it is great.

1289
00:48:03,149 --> 00:48:05,882
But I mean, it's not the same.

1290
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:10,682
After seeing Veronicas house

1291
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:12,048
I got this aching feeling all over me.

1292
00:48:13,215 --> 00:48:14,215
What do you mean?

1293
00:48:14,514 --> 00:48:15,114
I got jealous?

1294
00:48:16,081 --> 00:48:17,881
All that money, the house,

1295
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:19,447
all those rooms.

1296
00:48:19,447 --> 00:48:22,380
My house burns to the ground,

1297
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,413
taking my parents with it and here I am.

1298
00:48:26,513 --> 00:48:27,846
When did we get chosen

1299
00:48:27,846 --> 00:48:28,946
to be the failures?

1300
00:48:29,946 --> 00:48:31,246
We ain't living in a world

1301
00:48:31,246 --> 00:48:32,612
that wants to hear what we got to say.

1302
00:48:32,612 --> 00:48:34,845
You know, people would rather

1303
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,045
just walk past us, pretend we don't exist.

1304
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:38,811
Why does it have to be final?

1305
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:41,144
People must find a way out of this.

1306
00:48:41,311 --> 00:48:42,444
I mean, Jesus Jimmy,

1307
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:44,144
my shoes are falling apart,

1308
00:48:44,144 --> 00:48:45,110
I haven't slept well

1309
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,110
in a year, and I'm hungry.

1310
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,543
I'm hungry all the time.

1311
00:48:48,543 --> 00:48:50,210
The only time I get to eat is at school.

1312
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,976
Whatever happened to the American dream?

1313
00:48:54,076 --> 00:48:55,942
The thing with the American dream is

1314
00:48:56,509 --> 00:48:58,275
most of us wake up.

1315
00:48:59,475 --> 00:49:00,408
We move on.

1316
00:49:00,442 --> 00:49:01,975
Not everyone can be a success.

1317
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:02,641
No.

1318
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:04,208
Riff the streets are paved

1319
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,074
with shit and poverty.

1320
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:09,007
The gold, It's rare.

1321
00:49:10,007 --> 00:49:11,674
Now, we may never get the gold,

1322
00:49:11,674 --> 00:49:12,473
but we just got to avoid

1323
00:49:12,473 --> 00:49:13,307
the shit, you know.

1324
00:49:13,607 --> 00:49:15,506
So what, I just sit here

1325
00:49:15,506 --> 00:49:16,206
and hope some shlep

1326
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:18,506
gives me a dime or two?

1327
00:49:18,506 --> 00:49:19,639
God bless America.

1328
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:21,639
I can grab you something from my house.

1329
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:23,705
Or I could.

1330
00:49:25,772 --> 00:49:26,205
Help.

1331
00:49:27,805 --> 00:49:28,471
You know.

1332
00:49:28,738 --> 00:49:29,838
If I gotta take something

1333
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:31,371
heavy on, I'm doing it alone.

1334
00:49:32,104 --> 00:49:33,437
I'm fine, really Jimmy.

1335
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,470
You just go home, I'll see you tomorrow.

1336
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:38,337
I promise.

1337
00:49:43,436 --> 00:49:43,936
Alright.

1338
00:49:48,802 --> 00:49:49,435
You be careful out here,

1339
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,335
you hear me.

1340
00:49:53,268 --> 00:49:55,534
Jimmy leaves Riff on the docks,

1341
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,901
but as Riff follows him away

1342
00:49:57,901 --> 00:49:59,967
See you tomorrow Riff.

1343
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:03,333
He sees a man walking down the docks.

1344
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,100
Alone.

1345
00:50:06,066 --> 00:50:08,199
You need to eat Riff.

1346
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:09,566
But as the figure gets closer.

1347
00:50:10,366 --> 00:50:11,266
Well, how could he know?

1348
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:13,699
How could he have known the man

1349
00:50:13,699 --> 00:50:15,265
approaching was Cliff Smart,

1350
00:50:16,265 --> 00:50:17,498
wandering the streets,

1351
00:50:17,998 --> 00:50:20,264
thinking about his failures as a husband?

1352
00:50:24,864 --> 00:50:25,997
Hey, step aside.

1353
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:27,430
Not so fast, mister.

1354
00:50:27,463 --> 00:50:28,663
I'm going to need ten,

1355
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,996
I mean five bucks for you to pass.

1356
00:50:30,996 --> 00:50:32,696
A tax, if you will.

1357
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,163
I said, get out of my way.

1358
00:50:34,163 --> 00:50:35,129
I ain't in the mood.

1359
00:50:35,129 --> 00:50:36,662
I ain't gonna ask you again.

1360
00:50:37,629 --> 00:50:38,195
Look at

1361
00:50:38,795 --> 00:50:40,295
you ain't getting anything from me.

1362
00:50:41,062 --> 00:50:41,862
So why don't you run

1363
00:50:41,862 --> 00:50:43,095
on home to mommy and daddy

1364
00:50:43,095 --> 00:50:44,761
so they can teach you some respect?

1365
00:50:44,794 --> 00:50:45,461
What did you say?

1366
00:50:46,728 --> 00:50:47,727
I said move.

1367
00:50:49,127 --> 00:50:51,260
I just need some money for some food...

1368
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,927
Ain't interested in your sob story, kid.

1369
00:50:54,127 --> 00:50:54,760
Jesus.

1370
00:50:55,693 --> 00:50:57,493
Your parents sure as hell failed you.

1371
00:51:00,759 --> 00:51:02,425
Oh, you are dead!

1372
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:11,124
I just wanted to eat,

1373
00:51:11,124 --> 00:51:12,024
why couldn't you see,

1374
00:51:12,024 --> 00:51:13,224
I just wanted to eat,

1375
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:15,924
I ain't a bad kid, I swear.

1376
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,557
I'm sorry, Mr.

1377
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,123
I'm sorry.

1378
00:51:28,622 --> 00:51:30,122
Cliff.

1379
00:51:30,122 --> 00:51:31,588
What happened to you, are you ok?

1380
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,621
Sure, act like you care, Veronica.

1381
00:51:34,954 --> 00:51:36,221
What a cold thing to say.

1382
00:51:36,521 --> 00:51:37,887
I ain't in the mood to argue.

1383
00:51:37,921 --> 00:51:38,387
Come here.

1384
00:51:38,621 --> 00:51:39,321
Let me see it.

1385
00:51:47,153 --> 00:51:48,553
Oh, that looks like a nasty gash,

1386
00:51:48,553 --> 00:51:50,052
I think we're going to have to call

1387
00:51:50,052 --> 00:51:52,219
Dr. Morgan out just to be safe.

1388
00:51:52,885 --> 00:51:54,085
I don't need that quack.

1389
00:51:55,085 --> 00:51:56,085
I'll be fine as soon

1390
00:51:56,085 --> 00:51:58,151
as my head stops spinning.

1391
00:51:58,151 --> 00:51:58,551
Well,

1392
00:51:59,585 --> 00:52:00,451
what happened to you?

1393
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,118
It looks as though you were attacked.

1394
00:52:03,584 --> 00:52:05,084
I took a walk after work

1395
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:06,817
down by the waterfront.

1396
00:52:07,683 --> 00:52:08,717
I went down through the tunnel

1397
00:52:08,717 --> 00:52:10,450
where the street kids live.

1398
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:12,583
One of them hit me with a bat

1399
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:13,483
and took my money,

1400
00:52:14,283 --> 00:52:15,282
son of a bitch.

1401
00:52:16,082 --> 00:52:17,915
If I ever lay my eyes on him again, then.

1402
00:52:18,982 --> 00:52:20,582
He ain't going to see his next birthday.

1403
00:52:20,882 --> 00:52:22,115
Why would you go down there?

1404
00:52:22,748 --> 00:52:24,248
I was trying to clear my mind.

1405
00:52:24,815 --> 00:52:26,148
You told me to take a walk.

1406
00:52:26,448 --> 00:52:27,281
You needed time.

1407
00:52:27,514 --> 00:52:28,414
But down there.

1408
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,380
The police should take out

1409
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,680
a gun and get rid of the vermin

1410
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,413
who do nothing but dirty up the city.

1411
00:52:36,213 --> 00:52:37,679
Cliff, most of them are children

1412
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:39,346
who have fallen on hard times.

1413
00:52:39,379 --> 00:52:40,612
Not everybody was

1414
00:52:40,612 --> 00:52:42,079
as privileged as you were.

1415
00:52:42,712 --> 00:52:44,879
Wait, your defending them?

1416
00:52:45,545 --> 00:52:46,945
No, no.

1417
00:52:46,945 --> 00:52:47,611
It's just.

1418
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:50,744
Some of the kids I teach live down there,

1419
00:52:51,311 --> 00:52:53,344
you know, school is all they have

1420
00:52:53,344 --> 00:52:55,144
at given them any kind of a shot.

1421
00:52:56,477 --> 00:52:57,710
I just feel sorry for them.

1422
00:52:58,877 --> 00:53:00,076
Well they ain't getting a shot.

1423
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:01,743
God don't pay no

1424
00:53:01,743 --> 00:53:02,876
attention to those kinds.

1425
00:53:03,676 --> 00:53:05,509
You really can be so cruel.

1426
00:53:06,009 --> 00:53:07,842
Hey, it's my head split open here.

1427
00:53:09,709 --> 00:53:13,075
So these boys, what do they look like?

1428
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,108
All these street kids

1429
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:15,941
look the same to me,

1430
00:53:17,108 --> 00:53:19,374
although I do know

1431
00:53:19,374 --> 00:53:20,607
that one of them was called Riff.

1432
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,640
Riff? Yeah.

1433
00:53:24,807 --> 00:53:26,306
One of his friends shouted at him,

1434
00:53:27,073 --> 00:53:29,539
slipped up and used his name.

1435
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,906
Degenerates.

1436
00:53:30,906 --> 00:53:31,839
He could have killed you.

1437
00:53:44,171 --> 00:53:45,170
Some say that the kids

1438
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:46,237
never stood a chance.

1439
00:53:46,837 --> 00:53:47,837
They were broken,

1440
00:53:48,303 --> 00:53:50,503
searching for something more and easily

1441
00:53:50,503 --> 00:53:51,736
manipulated by a woman

1442
00:53:51,736 --> 00:53:52,936
who took advantage of it all.

1443
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:55,869
I say, I guess that's for you to decide.

1444
00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:57,369
But one thing is undeniable.

1445
00:53:57,902 --> 00:54:00,202
She certainly shook things up all right

1446
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:01,602
and she spun a web

1447
00:54:01,602 --> 00:54:02,968
that a vulnerable person could

1448
00:54:02,968 --> 00:54:04,035
easily fall into.

1449
00:54:04,701 --> 00:54:05,801
And Vivian, did.

1450
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,201
You have been out after school

1451
00:54:08,201 --> 00:54:09,234
every evening this week,

1452
00:54:09,234 --> 00:54:10,367
where are you going?

1453
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,534
I am not telling you mother,

1454
00:54:11,534 --> 00:54:12,933
because you'll only judge.

1455
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:13,600
Fine.

1456
00:54:13,967 --> 00:54:14,667
Then you won't be leaving

1457
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,566
this house tonight.

1458
00:54:15,566 --> 00:54:16,300
Vivian Pierce.

1459
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:18,133
I am not a child anymore.

1460
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:19,166
I'm fifteen.

1461
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:20,966
A child is exactly what you are.

1462
00:54:22,965 --> 00:54:24,499
You're out with those boys again.

1463
00:54:24,532 --> 00:54:25,898
Do you think I don't know that

1464
00:54:26,365 --> 00:54:28,198
you can't outsmart your mother.

1465
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:28,765
Ha!

1466
00:54:29,398 --> 00:54:30,031
Then you're wrong.

1467
00:54:30,031 --> 00:54:30,698
Vivian!

1468
00:54:30,864 --> 00:54:31,698
I've been going to see

1469
00:54:31,698 --> 00:54:33,197
my new teacher, actually.

1470
00:54:33,731 --> 00:54:34,797
Mrs Smart?

1471
00:54:34,931 --> 00:54:35,764
The lady I met?

1472
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:36,330
Yes.

1473
00:54:36,597 --> 00:54:37,897
She's been teaching me all about

1474
00:54:37,897 --> 00:54:38,997
how to make it in Hollywood.

1475
00:54:39,163 --> 00:54:41,030
Private lessons for free.

1476
00:54:41,363 --> 00:54:41,963
Oh, mother.

1477
00:54:41,963 --> 00:54:43,296
She's one of the most fascinating

1478
00:54:43,296 --> 00:54:44,429
people I've ever met.

1479
00:54:44,929 --> 00:54:46,429
Acting, no.

1480
00:54:47,362 --> 00:54:47,995
But mother, it's

1481
00:54:47,995 --> 00:54:50,062
something I want so bad that it hurts.

1482
00:54:50,728 --> 00:54:51,828
Oh, Vivian,

1483
00:54:52,128 --> 00:54:54,061
you are not going to be a movie star.

1484
00:54:54,295 --> 00:54:55,961
You are far too plain looking.

1485
00:54:56,061 --> 00:54:57,661
No, no, I'm not,

1486
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:58,861
I've got great bone structure.

1487
00:54:59,061 --> 00:55:00,227
Veronica told me.

1488
00:55:00,927 --> 00:55:01,894
I don't know what's going on

1489
00:55:01,894 --> 00:55:03,527
with you, Vivian, but I don't like it.

1490
00:55:03,527 --> 00:55:05,027
Why can't you just be happy?

1491
00:55:05,127 --> 00:55:06,593
Because I've lived Vivian.

1492
00:55:06,593 --> 00:55:07,826
I know the dangers

1493
00:55:07,826 --> 00:55:09,459
and I want to protect you.

1494
00:55:09,493 --> 00:55:10,692
I am going, mother.

1495
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,425
It's a scary world out there.

1496
00:55:14,392 --> 00:55:15,625
And people's motives aren't always

1497
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:16,658
what they appear to be.

1498
00:55:19,658 --> 00:55:21,158
Living with that fear

1499
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:23,391
is not living, mother.

1500
00:55:25,024 --> 00:55:25,291
Now.

1501
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:27,824
I'll be home by ten.

1502
00:55:29,323 --> 00:55:29,990
Don't wait up.

1503
00:55:46,254 --> 00:55:48,587
My dad doesn't show love.

1504
00:55:50,121 --> 00:55:50,854
He hates me.

1505
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:51,454
No.

1506
00:55:51,454 --> 00:55:52,087
It's cool.

1507
00:55:53,253 --> 00:55:54,353
Sometimes you're not supposed

1508
00:55:54,353 --> 00:55:55,287
to like your parents

1509
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:58,419
or they're not supposed to like you,

1510
00:55:58,419 --> 00:55:59,119
I guess.

1511
00:55:59,986 --> 00:56:00,786
That's tough.

1512
00:56:02,786 --> 00:56:04,152
Jimmy, what scares you?

1513
00:56:06,018 --> 00:56:09,051
I guess, turning out like him.

1514
00:56:10,418 --> 00:56:11,484
Staying in this town

1515
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:12,518
my soul rotting away

1516
00:56:12,518 --> 00:56:13,451
until there's nothing left.

1517
00:56:14,784 --> 00:56:15,517
Just a black hole.

1518
00:56:17,217 --> 00:56:18,217
You can always leave.

1519
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:19,483
And go where?

1520
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:21,016
It's a pipe dream,

1521
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:21,683
I'm never going to have

1522
00:56:21,683 --> 00:56:22,383
that kind of money.

1523
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:26,182
Well, all I can do is

1524
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,816
wait for the old man to meet his maker.

1525
00:56:28,615 --> 00:56:29,949
Maybe I'll get the house, you know,

1526
00:56:30,815 --> 00:56:32,182
sell it and leave, but.

1527
00:56:33,448 --> 00:56:34,581
Until then I guess I just.

1528
00:56:36,048 --> 00:56:36,781
stay still.

1529
00:56:38,347 --> 00:56:38,981
Motionless.

1530
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:41,880
Like a car without an engine.

1531
00:56:43,313 --> 00:56:44,680
I guess we all get stuck

1532
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,380
from time to time in a position

1533
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,579
that we just can't get out of.

1534
00:56:49,946 --> 00:56:50,579
Your husband?

1535
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:54,045
I feel like I'm drowning

1536
00:56:54,045 --> 00:56:56,145
in my own personal hell.

1537
00:56:56,545 --> 00:56:57,945
Then why don't you just leave him?

1538
00:56:59,011 --> 00:57:00,844
It's not as simple as that,

1539
00:57:00,844 --> 00:57:03,244
he owns everything, the house,

1540
00:57:03,244 --> 00:57:04,611
the cars, the money.

1541
00:57:05,644 --> 00:57:06,510
I have nothing.

1542
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:08,044
Material stuff isn't everything.

1543
00:57:08,077 --> 00:57:08,910
It is Jimmy.

1544
00:57:10,077 --> 00:57:11,243
You can't live without money.

1545
00:57:13,776 --> 00:57:15,876
I should have been somebody by now,

1546
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:18,042
but he's always held me back,

1547
00:57:18,042 --> 00:57:19,875
he's never let me be who I should be.

1548
00:57:22,508 --> 00:57:23,841
You know what, if this is it for me

1549
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:25,141
now, what if my....

1550
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:26,774
what if my time is done?

1551
00:57:26,974 --> 00:57:28,374
It doesn't have to be.

1552
00:57:29,207 --> 00:57:30,641
Oh would you listen to me?

1553
00:57:31,474 --> 00:57:32,907
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't

1554
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,340
be putting my problems onto you.

1555
00:57:35,573 --> 00:57:37,306
Can you forgive me.

1556
00:57:37,606 --> 00:57:40,839
You have done nothing to be forgiven for.

1557
00:57:43,772 --> 00:57:44,705
Jimmy?

1558
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:46,905
Would you excuse me for a moment?

1559
00:57:48,871 --> 00:57:49,638
I'll be right back.

1560
00:57:55,737 --> 00:57:57,804
Veronica gets up and leaves the room,

1561
00:57:57,804 --> 00:57:58,970
leaving Jimmy alone.

1562
00:57:59,803 --> 00:58:00,770
What is she doing?

1563
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,636
What is she up to?

1564
00:58:03,736 --> 00:58:05,436
Everything about it was calculated,

1565
00:58:05,436 --> 00:58:07,236
you see, every word,

1566
00:58:07,769 --> 00:58:10,002
every gesture, every move.

1567
00:58:10,968 --> 00:58:13,002
When she walked back into the room,

1568
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:15,301
her motives were clear.

1569
00:59:08,194 --> 00:59:09,561
But as Veronica seduced

1570
00:59:09,561 --> 00:59:10,994
Jimmy in her marital bed,

1571
00:59:11,794 --> 00:59:13,027
both had failed to notice

1572
00:59:13,027 --> 00:59:16,093
that Vivian had arrived and she saw all

1573
00:59:16,093 --> 00:59:17,293
she needed to see.

1574
00:59:34,091 --> 00:59:34,557
Honey,

1575
00:59:35,591 --> 00:59:36,357
I'm home.

1576
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,923
Cliff, another night with Lana?

1577
00:59:39,423 --> 00:59:41,956
No, I was with a friend,

1578
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:44,289
a man can have friends, you know,

1579
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:47,156
And what a good friend she is.

1580
00:59:47,756 --> 00:59:50,422
And, uh, what about you, my dear wife?

1581
00:59:51,122 --> 00:59:52,788
How did you spend your evening?

1582
00:59:52,888 --> 00:59:54,721
Well, I thought I'd invite

1583
00:59:54,721 --> 00:59:56,521
some men over and start

1584
00:59:56,588 --> 00:59:58,521
a torrid affair behind your back.

1585
00:59:58,554 --> 01:00:00,154
That's funny.

1586
01:00:00,154 --> 01:00:01,587
Oh, I'm drunk.

1587
01:00:01,887 --> 01:00:02,720
So I see.

1588
01:00:03,887 --> 01:00:05,053
What the hell is this?

1589
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,186
What?

1590
01:00:09,153 --> 01:00:10,053
Don't tell me

1591
01:00:11,219 --> 01:00:12,319
the several guys

1592
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,719
who came to visit with you, right?

1593
01:00:14,052 --> 01:00:14,752
Yes Cliff.

1594
01:00:15,219 --> 01:00:16,752
That's exactly right.

1595
01:00:17,452 --> 01:00:19,318
Have you got some guy Veronica?

1596
01:00:19,985 --> 01:00:21,484
Yes, actually,

1597
01:00:22,584 --> 01:00:23,951
his names Jimmy.

1598
01:00:24,317 --> 01:00:25,017
Oh,

1599
01:00:25,451 --> 01:00:26,317
and Riff,

1600
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:27,517
and Vivian.

1601
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:28,983
Two guys

1602
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:32,216
in my house with my wife.

1603
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,849
Are you completely insane?

1604
01:00:34,149 --> 01:00:35,283
Oh, relax, Cliff.

1605
01:00:35,916 --> 01:00:37,082
It's just three students

1606
01:00:37,082 --> 01:00:38,715
that I teach over at the school.

1607
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:40,882
I'm giving them private acting lessons.

1608
01:00:41,582 --> 01:00:42,848
Why didn't you tell me?

1609
01:00:43,715 --> 01:00:44,515
Would you care?

1610
01:00:45,448 --> 01:00:46,548
I care,

1611
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:48,614
I always care.

1612
01:00:49,781 --> 01:00:51,514
God we used to laugh.

1613
01:00:52,114 --> 01:00:54,280
We used to make love all night.

1614
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,446
We used to talk until the early hours

1615
01:00:56,446 --> 01:00:57,280
of the morning, but

1616
01:00:58,613 --> 01:00:59,546
now I.

1617
01:01:00,446 --> 01:01:01,712
I barely get a hello.

1618
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:04,845
Godammit Veronica,

1619
01:01:04,845 --> 01:01:07,512
I'm hurting, I'm hurting real bad

1620
01:01:07,512 --> 01:01:09,211
and if your not ready

1621
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:10,345
to forgive me then...

1622
01:01:10,611 --> 01:01:11,344
What?

1623
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:13,478
What Cliff?

1624
01:01:13,777 --> 01:01:15,411
Oh, God damn it Veronica,

1625
01:01:15,544 --> 01:01:17,610
you are milking this for all you can.

1626
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,243
How do I know that

1627
01:01:21,243 --> 01:01:23,110
you ain't cheating, huh?

1628
01:01:24,243 --> 01:01:25,443
I mean, you said you've

1629
01:01:25,443 --> 01:01:26,876
had these kids over, but

1630
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:28,909
how do I know that ain't a cover

1631
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:31,542
and you've been stepping out on me?

1632
01:01:33,408 --> 01:01:36,441
Veronica, steady as a rock rises

1633
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:38,074
slowly out of her chair.

1634
01:01:39,407 --> 01:01:42,940
Has the cat got your tongue Veronica.

1635
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:45,507
Hahaha.

1636
01:01:48,473 --> 01:01:51,472
Where the hell are you going Veronica?

1637
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:52,906
Veronica!

1638
01:01:56,572 --> 01:01:58,238
God damn,

1639
01:01:59,871 --> 01:02:02,471
what the hell are you doing Cliff.

1640
01:02:03,904 --> 01:02:06,904
(Motorcycle Sound)

1641
01:02:11,403 --> 01:02:12,403
(Thunder)

1642
01:02:14,336 --> 01:02:15,903
Jimmy, thank God you came,

1643
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:16,902
I didn't know who else to call.

1644
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:18,336
Of course I came.

1645
01:02:18,336 --> 01:02:19,435
You sounded scared.

1646
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:20,835
I knew something was wrong.

1647
01:02:20,935 --> 01:02:21,735
Of course you did,

1648
01:02:22,135 --> 01:02:23,735
because you get me, Jimmy.

1649
01:02:23,735 --> 01:02:25,701
I knew it from the first day we met.

1650
01:02:26,168 --> 01:02:26,601
Oh, God.

1651
01:02:26,634 --> 01:02:27,801
Jimmy, what am I doing?

1652
01:02:27,834 --> 01:02:28,601
Talk to me.

1653
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:31,367
Wipe your tears and talk to me.

1654
01:02:31,367 --> 01:02:32,034
What happened?

1655
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,700
Jimmy, he was so angry

1656
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:34,800
when he came home tonight.

1657
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,833
It was like his face changed

1658
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,666
into something I'd never seen before.

1659
01:02:38,866 --> 01:02:39,599
What did he do?

1660
01:02:39,699 --> 01:02:41,899
Jimmy, the violence in his eyes.

1661
01:02:43,132 --> 01:02:43,866
He hit you?

1662
01:02:44,165 --> 01:02:46,632
And then Veronica lied.

1663
01:02:47,032 --> 01:02:49,698
Yes, I think he wanted to hurt me.

1664
01:02:50,698 --> 01:02:52,098
After he struck my face,

1665
01:02:52,098 --> 01:02:53,631
he just started yelling at me.

1666
01:02:54,231 --> 01:02:55,964
He called me names that no woman

1667
01:02:55,964 --> 01:02:57,197
should ever be called.

1668
01:02:57,197 --> 01:02:58,197
That son of a bitch.

1669
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:00,097
He started ripping at my clothes

1670
01:03:00,097 --> 01:03:02,763
like a wild beast would do his eyes,

1671
01:03:02,763 --> 01:03:04,496
they were so black, blacker

1672
01:03:04,496 --> 01:03:06,363
than the darkest of nights.

1673
01:03:06,429 --> 01:03:07,929
How can a man put his hands

1674
01:03:07,929 --> 01:03:08,896
on a woman like that?

1675
01:03:09,529 --> 01:03:11,162
I mean, I know that I'm not perfect,

1676
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,762
but even I know that when a guy meets

1677
01:03:12,762 --> 01:03:13,662
a girl like you,

1678
01:03:14,995 --> 01:03:15,961
she should be treated

1679
01:03:15,961 --> 01:03:16,794
like the queen that she is.

1680
01:03:17,194 --> 01:03:18,394
Oh, Jimmy.

1681
01:03:18,794 --> 01:03:21,061
Jimmy your words, I love your words.

1682
01:03:21,061 --> 01:03:23,427
But I think Cliff thinks...

1683
01:03:23,427 --> 01:03:25,460
What? What does he think?

1684
01:03:26,193 --> 01:03:27,526
That maybe I talk about

1685
01:03:27,526 --> 01:03:28,960
a certain student too much.

1686
01:03:29,759 --> 01:03:31,826
Perhaps I'm looking at him with eyes.

1687
01:03:31,826 --> 01:03:33,326
I used to look at my husband with.

1688
01:03:34,192 --> 01:03:36,825
Jimmy, do you look at me that way?

1689
01:03:37,392 --> 01:03:38,458
Veronica, I can't

1690
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:39,625
stop thinking about you.

1691
01:03:39,658 --> 01:03:40,325
The other night...

1692
01:03:40,425 --> 01:03:41,291
But this is wrong.

1693
01:03:41,491 --> 01:03:43,058
Everything about this is wrong.

1694
01:03:43,091 --> 01:03:44,024
I'm your teacher.

1695
01:03:44,024 --> 01:03:45,224
You're only sixteen.

1696
01:03:45,224 --> 01:03:46,391
Men have done great things

1697
01:03:46,391 --> 01:03:47,924
at sixteen I told you

1698
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:49,723
I'm more mature.

1699
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:53,890
Yes, I see that, I see it all,

1700
01:03:54,056 --> 01:03:56,423
that beauty, God such beauty.

1701
01:03:56,856 --> 01:03:58,322
Jimmy, what are we doing?

1702
01:03:58,422 --> 01:03:59,289
I don't know, but

1703
01:03:59,289 --> 01:04:00,455
I don't want it to stop.

1704
01:04:00,689 --> 01:04:02,388
I can't stop thinking about kissing you,

1705
01:04:02,855 --> 01:04:04,755
your arms wrapped around me tight.

1706
01:04:04,755 --> 01:04:05,521
Veronica.

1707
01:04:05,921 --> 01:04:07,454
To look into your beautiful eyes

1708
01:04:07,454 --> 01:04:08,688
as you make love to me

1709
01:04:08,688 --> 01:04:10,021
all night long again.

1710
01:04:10,854 --> 01:04:12,487
I want to kiss you so bad.

1711
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,520
But I ain't about to cause

1712
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,387
you any problems.

1713
01:04:15,387 --> 01:04:16,053
Oh, Jimmy.

1714
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:19,053
You're not my problem, don't you see?

1715
01:04:19,919 --> 01:04:22,219
You're my bright, shining light.

1716
01:04:23,452 --> 01:04:25,019
The two kiss passionately

1717
01:04:25,019 --> 01:04:26,285
as the rain pours down,

1718
01:04:26,818 --> 01:04:28,552
maybe to wash their sins away.

1719
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:30,718
It was a point of no return.

1720
01:04:31,218 --> 01:04:35,117
Love, lust, desperation, manipulation.

1721
01:04:35,584 --> 01:04:36,884
Nobody knew at that point,

1722
01:04:37,384 --> 01:04:38,817
least of all Jimmy Flynn,

1723
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:40,683
a sixteen year old boy

1724
01:04:40,683 --> 01:04:42,716
whose fantasy was coming to life.

1725
01:04:52,315 --> 01:04:54,048
So what do you think, Betty?

1726
01:04:55,015 --> 01:04:56,381
I think your mothers going to send you to

1727
01:04:56,381 --> 01:04:58,414
a convent in a dress like that.

1728
01:04:58,414 --> 01:04:59,881
Where did you get it from?

1729
01:04:59,881 --> 01:05:01,681
Oh, Veronica gave it to me.

1730
01:05:02,014 --> 01:05:03,914
She said I should really start

1731
01:05:03,914 --> 01:05:06,247
to dress to be the person I want to be.

1732
01:05:06,547 --> 01:05:07,646
A bar room hooker?

1733
01:05:07,646 --> 01:05:10,546
No Betty, a movie star.

1734
01:05:11,346 --> 01:05:12,812
I don't even know why you think

1735
01:05:12,812 --> 01:05:13,812
she's so special.

1736
01:05:14,046 --> 01:05:16,079
She's hardly a young starlet.

1737
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:17,478
You don't understand, Betty.

1738
01:05:18,712 --> 01:05:19,911
Her husband stopped her

1739
01:05:19,911 --> 01:05:21,245
going into the movies anymore.

1740
01:05:21,844 --> 01:05:23,211
She used to be somebody.

1741
01:05:23,511 --> 01:05:24,244
Oh, really?

1742
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:26,011
Is that what she told you?

1743
01:05:26,044 --> 01:05:27,544
Why aren't you happy for me?

1744
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:31,077
You know, Veronica said

1745
01:05:31,077 --> 01:05:31,677
you should really

1746
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,110
surround yourself with people

1747
01:05:33,476 --> 01:05:34,343
who believe in you.

1748
01:05:35,276 --> 01:05:36,143
Jeez.

1749
01:05:36,643 --> 01:05:38,242
Are you trying to say I'm not supportive.

1750
01:05:38,509 --> 01:05:39,809
I just think you could embrace

1751
01:05:39,809 --> 01:05:40,775
my new look more.

1752
01:05:41,309 --> 01:05:43,842
I would if Veronica wasnt trying

1753
01:05:43,842 --> 01:05:44,275
to turn you into

1754
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:45,375
something that you ain't.

1755
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:46,741
I would if I wasn't

1756
01:05:46,741 --> 01:05:47,841
losing my best friend to her.

1757
01:05:48,274 --> 01:05:50,007
Oh, that's rather dramatic, Betty.

1758
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:51,107
Really?

1759
01:05:51,674 --> 01:05:53,507
You were supposed to stay at mine

1760
01:05:53,507 --> 01:05:54,507
last night but you never showed.

1761
01:05:54,707 --> 01:05:55,940
Oh, jeez, Betty.

1762
01:05:56,307 --> 01:05:57,406
I'm so sorry.

1763
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,940
I completely forgot.

1764
01:05:59,006 --> 01:05:59,973
It's like you love her.

1765
01:05:59,973 --> 01:06:00,806
I admire her.

1766
01:06:01,639 --> 01:06:03,406
And I just want to be like her.

1767
01:06:03,806 --> 01:06:05,972
I mean, what kind of life do I

1768
01:06:05,972 --> 01:06:07,605
really have after school huh?

1769
01:06:07,872 --> 01:06:09,671
Veronica's just showing me a new way.

1770
01:06:12,004 --> 01:06:12,771
So I see.

1771
01:06:12,871 --> 01:06:14,404
Mother, I...

1772
01:06:15,337 --> 01:06:17,870
What on earth do you think you are doing?

1773
01:06:18,204 --> 01:06:20,403
It's just a dress Mother.

1774
01:06:22,236 --> 01:06:23,103
You look like one of

1775
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,469
the girls who frequent the men's clubs.

1776
01:06:26,503 --> 01:06:26,936
Mother,

1777
01:06:28,469 --> 01:06:29,369
I am changing.

1778
01:06:30,169 --> 01:06:31,335
You need to understand that.

1779
01:06:32,335 --> 01:06:35,501
You are a little girl playing dress up.

1780
01:06:37,901 --> 01:06:39,667
Now, take it off

1781
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:41,334
I don't want to see you in that again.

1782
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:42,800
No, mother.

1783
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,800
This is the new me.

1784
01:06:45,367 --> 01:06:46,733
And if you can't accept that,

1785
01:06:46,967 --> 01:06:48,466
then we really don't

1786
01:06:48,466 --> 01:06:50,033
have anything else to discuss.

1787
01:06:50,233 --> 01:06:52,232
How dare you talk to me in that way?

1788
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:54,499
Your father is going to hear about this

1789
01:06:54,499 --> 01:06:55,632
and then you will be sorry.

1790
01:06:55,699 --> 01:06:58,532
Stop trying to turn me into you.

1791
01:07:00,598 --> 01:07:02,298
I want more from my life

1792
01:07:02,498 --> 01:07:04,064
than what you have,

1793
01:07:04,064 --> 01:07:05,431
and I'm sorry, mother,

1794
01:07:05,797 --> 01:07:07,031
but if this was my life,

1795
01:07:07,564 --> 01:07:09,130
I would kill myself.

1796
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:14,163
Vivian.

1797
01:07:22,528 --> 01:07:23,295
I should go.

1798
01:07:29,961 --> 01:07:35,327
Ah, Jimmy, hey, pass me that wrench.

1799
01:07:37,393 --> 01:07:40,893
OK, but it's midnight dad I gotta go.

1800
01:07:41,726 --> 01:07:43,459
Whoa, whoa, whoa, woah.

1801
01:07:45,192 --> 01:07:46,659
Help me up.

1802
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:50,991
Where the hell do you think you're going?

1803
01:07:50,991 --> 01:07:52,091
To meet my friends, I told you.

1804
01:07:53,024 --> 01:07:54,124
Not tonight.

1805
01:07:55,124 --> 01:07:55,757
Dad.

1806
01:07:55,991 --> 01:07:56,991
I said not tonight.

1807
01:07:56,991 --> 01:07:57,757
I need you here.

1808
01:08:00,657 --> 01:08:01,857
I don't want to work here, dad.

1809
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:04,356
I got other dreams

1810
01:08:04,356 --> 01:08:04,989
that I want to achieve,

1811
01:08:04,989 --> 01:08:06,189
and I've been here all day.

1812
01:08:07,622 --> 01:08:08,722
It ain't like I'm getting paid.

1813
01:08:09,189 --> 01:08:10,655
You have a roof over your head

1814
01:08:10,822 --> 01:08:12,089
and hot meals on the table.

1815
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:13,222
I'm your son.

1816
01:08:14,388 --> 01:08:15,721
I ain't some employee.

1817
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:16,821
Don't you want more for me?

1818
01:08:16,888 --> 01:08:17,587
What I want is for

1819
01:08:17,621 --> 01:08:18,388
you to watch your mouth

1820
01:08:18,388 --> 01:08:19,220
and get back to work.

1821
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:22,287
Dad, please.

1822
01:08:23,487 --> 01:08:25,620
I've really got to see someone tonight.

1823
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:26,287
Who?

1824
01:08:27,086 --> 01:08:29,020
Who is more important than your old man?

1825
01:08:29,053 --> 01:08:30,185
You wouldn't understand.

1826
01:08:31,185 --> 01:08:32,185
A broad,

1827
01:08:33,252 --> 01:08:34,752
you want to skip out with some dame?

1828
01:08:34,952 --> 01:08:37,551
This ain't some broad dad, she's special.

1829
01:08:38,551 --> 01:08:39,318
She makes me feel

1830
01:08:39,385 --> 01:08:40,550
I ain't the disappointment

1831
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,351
you keep reminding me I am.

1832
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:43,684
Jimmy. You ain't going.

1833
01:08:44,184 --> 01:08:45,484
Yeah, watch me.

1834
01:08:47,584 --> 01:08:48,717
Oh, what? What?

1835
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,950
You going to beat me again, huh?

1836
01:08:50,983 --> 01:08:51,617
Old man,

1837
01:08:51,617 --> 01:08:52,183
I ain't gonna let

1838
01:08:52,183 --> 01:08:53,282
you knock me around anymore.

1839
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:54,515
Why you always got to see me

1840
01:08:54,515 --> 01:08:55,449
as the bad guy, Jimmy.

1841
01:08:56,148 --> 01:08:58,049
I'm just doing my best to guide you.

1842
01:08:58,049 --> 01:08:59,515
Guide me?

1843
01:09:00,749 --> 01:09:01,815
You mean destroy me.

1844
01:09:02,582 --> 01:09:04,215
You know, I'd have more respect

1845
01:09:04,215 --> 01:09:05,615
if you told me that you hated me.

1846
01:09:05,648 --> 01:09:06,880
I don't hate you Jimmy.

1847
01:09:07,781 --> 01:09:09,081
I just know what's best for you.

1848
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:11,147
You don't even know

1849
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,246
what's best for yourself.

1850
01:09:13,147 --> 01:09:13,746
Jimmy!

1851
01:09:13,746 --> 01:09:15,513
Get back here now!

1852
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:20,646
Veronica was like a whirlwind,

1853
01:09:20,646 --> 01:09:23,078
she was already leaving her mark

1854
01:09:23,211 --> 01:09:24,578
and what a mark it was.

1855
01:09:25,545 --> 01:09:27,444
But that night as clouds

1856
01:09:27,444 --> 01:09:28,944
rolled over the city,

1857
01:09:28,944 --> 01:09:33,011
things will take a turn, a dark turn

1858
01:09:33,011 --> 01:09:35,411
that will change everything.

1859
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:41,010
It's nice, isn't it.

1860
01:09:42,976 --> 01:09:44,143
Us being able to do this.

1861
01:09:45,876 --> 01:09:46,809
These past few weeks with you

1862
01:09:46,809 --> 01:09:48,408
have been incredible Veronica.

1863
01:09:48,908 --> 01:09:51,309
They sure have and you're right,

1864
01:09:52,342 --> 01:09:53,242
it is nice.

1865
01:09:54,407 --> 01:09:55,308
I just wish it could be

1866
01:09:55,308 --> 01:09:57,141
like this all the time.

1867
01:09:57,441 --> 01:09:57,808
Yeah.

1868
01:09:59,341 --> 01:10:00,207
Wake up in the morning,

1869
01:10:00,207 --> 01:10:01,474
take a ride on my bike

1870
01:10:01,474 --> 01:10:02,374
wherever you want to go.

1871
01:10:02,874 --> 01:10:03,639
Hollywood.

1872
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:04,874
Hollywood, it is.

1873
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,073
We could watch the sunset

1874
01:10:07,073 --> 01:10:08,306
over the City of Angels.

1875
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:13,106
We could hold each other tightly wrapped

1876
01:10:13,106 --> 01:10:15,039
up, nice and warm in a blanket.

1877
01:10:21,737 --> 01:10:22,405
Do you think it could

1878
01:10:22,405 --> 01:10:23,404
ever happen, Veronica?

1879
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:27,271
That you leave Cliff.

1880
01:10:28,637 --> 01:10:31,270
If I had the money, the security.

1881
01:10:32,969 --> 01:10:34,403
I would in a heartbeat Jimmy.

1882
01:10:35,236 --> 01:10:36,436
I have a little saved.

1883
01:10:37,403 --> 01:10:38,436
That's very sweet,

1884
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:40,469
but a little saved,

1885
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:42,135
won't get us very far.

1886
01:10:43,135 --> 01:10:44,702
If only Cliff wasn't around.

1887
01:10:45,835 --> 01:10:46,835
Yeah.

1888
01:10:48,268 --> 01:10:49,101
If only.

1889
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:56,567
I don't think you're old enough

1890
01:10:56,567 --> 01:10:57,833
to be drinking my liquor.

1891
01:10:58,133 --> 01:10:59,032
Who the hell are you?

1892
01:10:59,366 --> 01:11:00,398
The man of the house.

1893
01:11:00,532 --> 01:11:01,898
Oh, Mr. Smart.

1894
01:11:02,266 --> 01:11:05,066
Wait a minute, I know you,

1895
01:11:05,365 --> 01:11:06,032
Oh, shit!

1896
01:11:06,065 --> 01:11:07,698
it's you, the kid with the bat.

1897
01:11:07,798 --> 01:11:08,398
Mister I didn't know

1898
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:09,298
you were Veronica's husband.

1899
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:10,465
You are dead!

1900
01:11:10,998 --> 01:11:14,231
Get the hell of him Mr Smart, run Riff!

1901
01:11:14,231 --> 01:11:15,364
Why are you in my house?

1902
01:11:15,697 --> 01:11:16,531
We know your wife.

1903
01:11:16,531 --> 01:11:17,864
She's teaching us, asking.

1904
01:11:17,864 --> 01:11:18,830
Where's my wife?

1905
01:11:19,264 --> 01:11:19,964
She's upstairs.

1906
01:11:19,964 --> 01:11:20,996
Do you want me to go get her?

1907
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:21,930
Is she alone?

1908
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:22,830
Alone?

1909
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:25,196
Is my wife alone?

1910
01:11:27,329 --> 01:11:28,496
Get the hell out of my house.

1911
01:11:28,629 --> 01:11:31,129
Now, and you tell your friend

1912
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,662
I'll be seeing you again Riff, real soon.

1913
01:11:42,894 --> 01:11:43,660
What the hell is this?

1914
01:11:44,559 --> 01:11:47,559
Cliff, I didn't expect you home tonight.

1915
01:11:47,826 --> 01:11:48,626
So I see.

1916
01:11:50,425 --> 01:11:51,425
So when I'm gone, you

1917
01:11:52,493 --> 01:11:54,291
have kids over to get drunk in my house.

1918
01:11:55,725 --> 01:11:57,291
These are your new......

1919
01:11:57,291 --> 01:11:58,425
friends?

1920
01:11:58,657 --> 01:11:59,791
I told you Cliff,

1921
01:12:00,325 --> 01:12:02,291
I'm giving them acting lessons.

1922
01:12:02,458 --> 01:12:02,924
Oh, yeah.

1923
01:12:04,091 --> 01:12:04,724
So what's this?

1924
01:12:05,991 --> 01:12:07,591
Some kind of love scene

1925
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:08,724
in my bed?

1926
01:12:09,057 --> 01:12:09,790
Excuse me?

1927
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:11,057
Jimmy, you should go.

1928
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:12,290
Yeah, Jimmy,

1929
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:16,989
maybe you should leave my bedroom,

1930
01:12:18,022 --> 01:12:19,489
that I share with my wife.

1931
01:12:19,522 --> 01:12:21,589
We were just talking, must

1932
01:12:21,589 --> 01:12:22,855
you act like such a brute.

1933
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:25,121
Mr Smart, Veronica and I....

1934
01:12:25,588 --> 01:12:28,321
There ain't no Veronica and you kid, now

1935
01:12:28,421 --> 01:12:30,353
run home like a good little boy.

1936
01:12:30,521 --> 01:12:31,187
Cliff.

1937
01:12:33,387 --> 01:12:35,154
Get out of my house.

1938
01:12:37,787 --> 01:12:40,886
I said, get out of my house.

1939
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:45,286
What's wrong?

1940
01:12:45,985 --> 01:12:47,052
Do you not hear too good?

1941
01:12:47,619 --> 01:12:49,552
I said, get out of my house.

1942
01:12:51,585 --> 01:12:52,585
Cliff!

1943
01:12:52,585 --> 01:12:56,584
Stop it, stop it.

1944
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:04,250
You've been looking at my wife?

1945
01:13:04,816 --> 01:13:05,416
Touching her?

1946
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:08,582
If you're man enough to go near her,

1947
01:13:09,148 --> 01:13:10,582
you're man enough to fight me.

1948
01:13:10,982 --> 01:13:11,615
Cliff!

1949
01:13:11,615 --> 01:13:12,215
If you don't leave him alone

1950
01:13:12,215 --> 01:13:13,348
I'm going to call the police.

1951
01:13:13,548 --> 01:13:14,682
I know your type, Jimmy.

1952
01:13:15,115 --> 01:13:16,281
Oh, you think you can get

1953
01:13:16,281 --> 01:13:17,415
what you want from her. Huh?

1954
01:13:18,214 --> 01:13:19,314
Maybe you should stick

1955
01:13:19,514 --> 01:13:21,114
to the slum side of town

1956
01:13:21,114 --> 01:13:21,947
because I don't ever want

1957
01:13:21,947 --> 01:13:23,114
to see you around here again.

1958
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:26,612
I'm going alright .

1959
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:29,046
I'm going.

1960
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,079
Stay away from my wife, Jimmy.

1961
01:13:31,579 --> 01:13:33,346
Or I'll rip you to pieces,

1962
01:13:33,346 --> 01:13:35,012
limb by limb,

1963
01:13:35,012 --> 01:13:36,412
do we understand each other?

1964
01:13:41,545 --> 01:13:42,745
How dare you?

1965
01:13:43,344 --> 01:13:44,778
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1966
01:13:44,778 --> 01:13:45,511
Don't.

1967
01:13:46,977 --> 01:13:47,544
Don't talk to me.

1968
01:13:47,577 --> 01:13:49,943
We were just working Cliff.

1969
01:13:49,943 --> 01:13:51,277
And the kids downstairs?

1970
01:13:51,277 --> 01:13:52,043
Students.

1971
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:53,443
The boy that attacked me

1972
01:13:53,443 --> 01:13:55,043
with the bat, that was him

1973
01:13:55,743 --> 01:13:57,643
that sewer rat was in my living room.

1974
01:13:57,643 --> 01:13:59,776
But I'm sure he didn't know who you were.

1975
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:01,242
He could have killed me

1976
01:14:01,242 --> 01:14:02,609
and what would you have done then, huh?

1977
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:04,475
One of your students attacks

1978
01:14:04,475 --> 01:14:06,775
your husband, bashes his skull in.

1979
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:09,474
Jesus, what kind of company do you keep?

1980
01:14:09,474 --> 01:14:11,207
Cliff wait.

1981
01:14:11,207 --> 01:14:12,574
Do you want me divorce you,

1982
01:14:12,574 --> 01:14:13,240
leave you with nothing?

1983
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:17,107
No Cliff, you're getting it all wrong.

1984
01:14:22,106 --> 01:14:22,606
Good night,

1985
01:14:23,806 --> 01:14:24,639
my dear wife.

1986
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:41,837
Now, here is the thing.

1987
01:14:42,503 --> 01:14:43,736
This dame ain't going to do

1988
01:14:43,736 --> 01:14:44,503
well in poverty.

1989
01:14:45,136 --> 01:14:47,068
Poor is not a style she wears well.

1990
01:14:47,603 --> 01:14:49,335
Well, this is the part

1991
01:14:49,335 --> 01:14:51,369
you may not believe, but I assure you

1992
01:14:51,502 --> 01:14:53,002
every word is true.

1993
01:14:53,868 --> 01:14:55,368
Veronica slammed her face

1994
01:14:55,368 --> 01:14:56,535
against the hard wall.

1995
01:14:58,334 --> 01:14:59,168
Why?

1996
01:14:59,934 --> 01:15:01,666
Well, after a quick phone

1997
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:03,700
call to a distraught Jimmy and a late

1998
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:04,700
night meeting arranged,

1999
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,800
a bruise would sell Veronica's

2000
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,067
story perfectly.

2001
01:15:09,266 --> 01:15:09,866
Oh, God.

2002
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,032
Jimmy, Jimmy, are you OK?

2003
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:13,232
Son of a bitch.

2004
01:15:14,732 --> 01:15:16,565
Your face, what did he do to your face?

2005
01:15:16,965 --> 01:15:17,965
I told you, Jimmy.

2006
01:15:18,132 --> 01:15:20,165
He's a violent brute of a man.

2007
01:15:20,165 --> 01:15:21,931
I never wanted you to get hurt.

2008
01:15:22,098 --> 01:15:23,031
Forget about me.

2009
01:15:23,065 --> 01:15:24,898
We need to get you away from him.

2010
01:15:24,931 --> 01:15:26,564
He can't do this to you.

2011
01:15:26,831 --> 01:15:27,531
But how?

2012
01:15:27,597 --> 01:15:29,897
Just, just leave him.

2013
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:31,463
Who cares if he leaves you with nothing?

2014
01:15:31,496 --> 01:15:32,330
You have me.

2015
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:33,330
We have each other.

2016
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:34,830
Jimmy, you're young.

2017
01:15:35,096 --> 01:15:36,329
You don't understand

2018
01:15:36,329 --> 01:15:37,862
how much living can cost.

2019
01:15:38,429 --> 01:15:40,462
We would be broke, unhappy

2020
01:15:40,462 --> 01:15:42,594
and resenting each other in no time.

2021
01:15:43,862 --> 01:15:44,827
Face it Jimmy.

2022
01:15:45,562 --> 01:15:47,728
I'm stuck with him until my dying day.

2023
01:15:47,761 --> 01:15:48,094
No.

2024
01:15:49,494 --> 01:15:51,494
No, we have to think of another way.

2025
01:15:51,627 --> 01:15:53,460
I can't live another day without you.

2026
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:57,160
I love you.

2027
01:15:58,893 --> 01:15:59,526
Jimmy.

2028
01:15:59,526 --> 01:16:01,893
Do you love me?

2029
01:16:03,626 --> 01:16:05,559
Everything about this is wrong,

2030
01:16:05,559 --> 01:16:08,225
and yet I have never felt more safe

2031
01:16:08,225 --> 01:16:10,558
in anyone's arms as I do in yours.

2032
01:16:10,991 --> 01:16:12,391
I want to go back there and show him

2033
01:16:12,391 --> 01:16:13,458
who's the man around here.

2034
01:16:16,023 --> 01:16:16,457
Jimmy,

2035
01:16:18,224 --> 01:16:19,224
I just had a thought.

2036
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:21,457
A horrible thought.

2037
01:16:22,723 --> 01:16:23,755
What is it, Veronica?

2038
01:16:23,755 --> 01:16:24,255
Tell me.

2039
01:16:25,989 --> 01:16:26,523
I couldn't.

2040
01:16:27,389 --> 01:16:28,255
It's too awful.

2041
01:16:28,255 --> 01:16:29,689
Yes, you can just

2042
01:16:30,922 --> 01:16:31,621
just say it.

2043
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,455
Well, the way I see it

2044
01:16:35,487 --> 01:16:37,688
is that only Cliff and the lack of money

2045
01:16:37,688 --> 01:16:39,888
stands in the way of true happiness.

2046
01:16:40,821 --> 01:16:41,287
OK.

2047
01:16:42,487 --> 01:16:43,887
But if Cliff wasn't around,

2048
01:16:43,887 --> 01:16:48,287
if Cliff died, I would get everything.

2049
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,420
We would have everything

2050
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,153
we need to have the

2051
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:52,452
perfect life together.

2052
01:16:52,452 --> 01:16:53,818
But he isn't going anywhere.

2053
01:16:53,852 --> 01:16:54,786
You saw him.

2054
01:16:55,052 --> 01:16:56,619
He's as strong as an ox.

2055
01:16:59,418 --> 01:17:00,318
Jimmy, I could pay,

2056
01:17:01,218 --> 01:17:03,584
I could pay anyone who helps.

2057
01:17:03,984 --> 01:17:05,151
I mean, think about it, Jimmy.

2058
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,084
This is New York.

2059
01:17:06,117 --> 01:17:08,184
People die all the time.

2060
01:17:08,784 --> 01:17:09,550
We could say that

2061
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:11,117
it was a robbery gone bad.

2062
01:17:11,916 --> 01:17:13,350
Nobody would suspect you.

2063
01:17:13,716 --> 01:17:14,350
Why would they?

2064
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:15,516
Nobody knows about us

2065
01:17:15,516 --> 01:17:16,483
other than those two.

2066
01:17:16,683 --> 01:17:19,316
And they won't say a word.

2067
01:17:19,316 --> 01:17:20,916
I will make sure of that.

2068
01:17:22,082 --> 01:17:23,082
Think about it, Jimmy.

2069
01:17:24,182 --> 01:17:25,482
Think about it, this could work,

2070
01:17:25,482 --> 01:17:26,615
we could be free.

2071
01:17:27,548 --> 01:17:28,981
What are you saying, Veronica?

2072
01:17:30,581 --> 01:17:30,981
Jimmy,

2073
01:17:33,147 --> 01:17:34,514
I want you to kill my husband.

2074
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:39,180
(Thunder Crashes)

2075
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:03,876
What's all this?

2076
01:18:03,876 --> 01:18:05,175
I did you the favour of packing

2077
01:18:05,175 --> 01:18:06,243
your bags for you baby?

2078
01:18:07,043 --> 01:18:08,709
You're absurd Cliff.

2079
01:18:08,709 --> 01:18:10,076
Look, I don't want to hear it Veronica,

2080
01:18:10,675 --> 01:18:12,175
seeing you sat on our bed with

2081
01:18:12,175 --> 01:18:13,275
that kid was one thing,

2082
01:18:13,842 --> 01:18:14,907
but it was the look in your eyes

2083
01:18:14,907 --> 01:18:15,907
that told me everything.

2084
01:18:16,141 --> 01:18:17,508
What are you talking about?

2085
01:18:17,641 --> 01:18:19,641
The betrayal was in your eyes.

2086
01:18:20,141 --> 01:18:21,108
I saw it the moment

2087
01:18:21,108 --> 01:18:22,007
I walked in the bedroom.

2088
01:18:22,141 --> 01:18:24,207
Oh, you're talking in circles Cliff.

2089
01:18:24,207 --> 01:18:25,474
Why aren't you listening to me!

2090
01:18:25,474 --> 01:18:26,573
Cliff!

2091
01:18:26,573 --> 01:18:27,907
I want you gone Veronica.

2092
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,606
I am done.

2093
01:18:29,606 --> 01:18:31,906
You lie, all you do is lie.

2094
01:18:31,906 --> 01:18:33,739
I can't trust you, I can't trust a word

2095
01:18:33,739 --> 01:18:34,839
that comes out of your mouth.

2096
01:18:35,339 --> 01:18:36,939
You strung me along for years.

2097
01:18:37,072 --> 01:18:38,239
You never had any intention

2098
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:39,105
of becoming a mother.

2099
01:18:39,371 --> 01:18:40,172
I see that now.

2100
01:18:40,172 --> 01:18:42,237
Now you're painting yourself

2101
01:18:42,237 --> 01:18:44,071
as a victim Cliff.

2102
01:18:44,071 --> 01:18:45,471
Again, you cheated.

2103
01:18:45,504 --> 01:18:46,837
This isn't about that.

2104
01:18:46,837 --> 01:18:49,103
Look I haven't got a future with you.

2105
01:18:49,469 --> 01:18:51,137
I see that now baby, you've made

2106
01:18:51,137 --> 01:18:52,237
that perfectly clear.

2107
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:54,370
You son of a bitch.

2108
01:18:54,903 --> 01:18:55,903
Well if you think I'm

2109
01:18:55,903 --> 01:18:57,503
walking away from this marriage

2110
01:18:57,503 --> 01:19:00,036
with nothing but a few cases of clothing?

2111
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:01,202
Well, there it is.

2112
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:03,169
Money, belongings and things.

2113
01:19:03,169 --> 01:19:04,135
That's all you care about,

2114
01:19:04,135 --> 01:19:04,902
right, Veronica?

2115
01:19:05,002 --> 01:19:06,335
You won't get away with this.

2116
01:19:06,901 --> 01:19:08,768
Big words, but we both know that I will.

2117
01:19:09,101 --> 01:19:11,068
You are making a mistake, Cliff.

2118
01:19:12,134 --> 01:19:13,567
You know, um.

2119
01:19:13,567 --> 01:19:14,200
That

2120
01:19:15,367 --> 01:19:20,532
kid, Riff, the kid that was in my house.

2121
01:19:21,366 --> 01:19:22,066
What about him?

2122
01:19:22,766 --> 01:19:27,332
Look, just a pretty small world ain't it.

2123
01:19:29,332 --> 01:19:30,532
Just one of the kids

2124
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:32,465
that you've been hopelessly

2125
01:19:32,998 --> 01:19:34,464
flaunting yourself in front of

2126
01:19:34,464 --> 01:19:36,364
like some cheap whore.

2127
01:19:37,331 --> 01:19:38,297
Just happens to be

2128
01:19:38,297 --> 01:19:39,297
the kid who attacks me.

2129
01:19:40,364 --> 01:19:41,397
What are you saying?

2130
01:19:43,097 --> 01:19:44,463
Did you put him up to that Veronica?

2131
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:45,996
God,

2132
01:19:47,696 --> 01:19:49,296
how could you even think that?

2133
01:19:49,929 --> 01:19:50,228
Oh,

2134
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:52,462
well, here we go.

2135
01:19:53,395 --> 01:19:54,762
Bring on the tears.

2136
01:19:55,862 --> 01:19:56,728
Why don't you save them

2137
01:19:56,728 --> 01:19:58,094
for one of your teenage lovers?

2138
01:19:58,094 --> 01:19:59,827
I'm sure they'll eat em up.

2139
01:19:59,827 --> 01:20:02,427
You're insane, sick,

2140
01:20:02,427 --> 01:20:03,661
thinking that I would

2141
01:20:03,661 --> 01:20:04,660
sleep with a student.

2142
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:05,594
You know, the fact

2143
01:20:05,594 --> 01:20:06,827
that you even suggested

2144
01:20:06,827 --> 01:20:09,393
it says more about you.

2145
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:10,925
Well, I know you, Veronica,

2146
01:20:10,925 --> 01:20:12,326
and I know when you lie.

2147
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:13,726
You cannot divorce me.

2148
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:15,126
Oh, really?

2149
01:20:15,526 --> 01:20:16,725
Why don't you watch me?

2150
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:18,725
Cliff, I never slept with anyone else.

2151
01:20:18,725 --> 01:20:19,592
Lies!

2152
01:20:19,592 --> 01:20:21,192
I had nothing to do with Riffs attack.

2153
01:20:21,192 --> 01:20:21,758
Lies!

2154
01:20:22,091 --> 01:20:22,891
Please wait.

2155
01:20:23,058 --> 01:20:24,724
We just ,we got to talk.

2156
01:20:25,023 --> 01:20:26,224
I'm done talking.

2157
01:20:26,224 --> 01:20:27,157
No Cliff, please.

2158
01:20:27,157 --> 01:20:28,523
I said I'm done Veronica.

2159
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:29,290
Please Cliff, I have

2160
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:30,457
something to tell you.

2161
01:20:30,924 --> 01:20:34,255
Oh, Veronica, she never misses a trick.

2162
01:20:38,423 --> 01:20:39,056
Cliff.

2163
01:20:41,822 --> 01:20:42,955
I'm pregnant.

2164
01:21:00,886 --> 01:21:03,019
Where the hell do you think you're going?

2165
01:21:03,019 --> 01:21:04,352
I told you,

2166
01:21:04,352 --> 01:21:05,719
I have a date with my lady, tonight.

2167
01:21:06,085 --> 01:21:07,452
Jimmy, you've been seeing this woman

2168
01:21:07,452 --> 01:21:09,252
for the last three weeks, but tonight,

2169
01:21:10,385 --> 01:21:11,684
tonight, your working.

2170
01:21:11,684 --> 01:21:12,285
Dad please,

2171
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:13,518
I've really got to see her tonight.

2172
01:21:13,518 --> 01:21:13,818
Jimmy.

2173
01:21:13,885 --> 01:21:15,050
Who the hell is this woman?

2174
01:21:16,916 --> 01:21:18,351
Just somebody, you don't know her.

2175
01:21:18,351 --> 01:21:19,484
Well, whoever she is,

2176
01:21:19,784 --> 01:21:20,984
she's got you acting like a damn fool.

2177
01:21:25,016 --> 01:21:26,083
Why dad?

2178
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:27,816
Because I'm in love.

2179
01:21:29,349 --> 01:21:30,249
Because I don't piss my life

2180
01:21:30,249 --> 01:21:31,148
down the drain like you.

2181
01:21:32,815 --> 01:21:34,082
You think I never knew love

2182
01:21:34,082 --> 01:21:34,848
before your mother.

2183
01:21:36,115 --> 01:21:38,014
I remember falling all over myself

2184
01:21:38,014 --> 01:21:40,448
for this one broad.

2185
01:21:40,448 --> 01:21:41,081
Patricia.

2186
01:21:42,746 --> 01:21:45,280
Oh, I never seen a lady like that,

2187
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:49,280
and make no mistake, she was a real lady.

2188
01:21:53,779 --> 01:21:57,478
I fell so hard for her, my first love.

2189
01:22:01,512 --> 01:22:02,045
At eighteen,

2190
01:22:02,045 --> 01:22:04,443
I started planning my future around her,

2191
01:22:04,511 --> 01:22:06,011
believing everything she said.

2192
01:22:07,977 --> 01:22:08,844
Life was perfect.

2193
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:12,477
I was happy

2194
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:16,175
and happiness was hard to come by you know

2195
01:22:16,743 --> 01:22:17,743
when I was a teenager.

2196
01:22:20,842 --> 01:22:24,475
And one day, out of the blue,

2197
01:22:27,741 --> 01:22:28,341
I found out she got

2198
01:22:28,341 --> 01:22:29,341
married to another guy.

2199
01:22:33,374 --> 01:22:34,773
I had no idea that she was

2200
01:22:34,773 --> 01:22:35,374
stepping out on me,

2201
01:22:35,374 --> 01:22:37,540
and she she never let slip.

2202
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:40,740
The pain was too much.

2203
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,339
I was left picking up the pieces.

2204
01:22:46,706 --> 01:22:48,839
Then I met your mother.

2205
01:22:51,572 --> 01:22:53,071
Look, it ain't worth it,

2206
01:22:53,071 --> 01:22:54,704
just just focus on your work.

2207
01:22:54,871 --> 01:22:55,504
That is something

2208
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:56,504
that will give you a future.

2209
01:22:59,304 --> 01:23:01,337
I don't want to be like you dad,

2210
01:23:02,737 --> 01:23:03,637
I'm sorry,

2211
01:23:03,637 --> 01:23:05,136
but I have bigger plans for myself.

2212
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:08,769
Oh, yeah, what plans?

2213
01:23:10,536 --> 01:23:12,934
Plans. Plans.

2214
01:23:13,735 --> 01:23:15,468
You're lliving in La La Land, Jimmy.

2215
01:23:16,235 --> 01:23:17,434
You think somebody like

2216
01:23:17,434 --> 01:23:19,001
you becomes a somebody?

2217
01:23:20,168 --> 01:23:21,568
They don't.

2218
01:23:21,568 --> 01:23:23,067
Look around you, Jimmy.

2219
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,834
Your whole future is mapped out.

2220
01:23:26,867 --> 01:23:27,833
Well, I want more.

2221
01:23:28,767 --> 01:23:31,466
You're a fool Jimmy Flynn,

2222
01:23:31,466 --> 01:23:33,433
and this world ain't kind to fools.

2223
01:23:33,532 --> 01:23:34,199
I love her.

2224
01:23:37,732 --> 01:23:39,332
I love her dad.

2225
01:23:40,332 --> 01:23:41,198
You're sixteen.

2226
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:43,130
You have no idea what love is.

2227
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:47,331
Now get ready to be down at the garage

2228
01:23:47,331 --> 01:23:50,764
at six thirty, it's an all nighter again.

2229
01:23:50,764 --> 01:23:52,597
Dad.

2230
01:23:52,996 --> 01:23:54,496
Please.

2231
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:57,429
I'm dressed.

2232
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:19,660
I said six thirty.

2233
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:25,692
Jimmy.

2234
01:24:25,692 --> 01:24:26,291
Jimmy!

2235
01:24:40,424 --> 01:24:43,023
Well, it really is beautiful here, Jimmy.

2236
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:44,423
I can see why you like

2237
01:24:44,423 --> 01:24:45,523
to come here and think.

2238
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:48,123
It's hard to find peace in a city

2239
01:24:48,123 --> 01:24:49,056
that's always moving.

2240
01:24:51,056 --> 01:24:52,022
But when I was little,

2241
01:24:52,222 --> 01:24:55,722
my mom used to bring me up here.

2242
01:24:57,487 --> 01:24:59,221
She used to say that we had to pretend

2243
01:24:59,221 --> 01:25:00,454
that we're not in the

2244
01:25:00,454 --> 01:25:01,588
big city anymore, but

2245
01:25:02,621 --> 01:25:03,787
just on some small island

2246
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:07,587
away from everything and everyone.

2247
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:11,386
Your mother sounded like a smart lady.

2248
01:25:12,119 --> 01:25:13,219
They spoke for hours.

2249
01:25:13,919 --> 01:25:15,352
It was like nothing else mattered.

2250
01:25:15,486 --> 01:25:17,419
The question haunting both of them had

2251
01:25:17,419 --> 01:25:18,385
simply vanished.

2252
01:25:19,684 --> 01:25:21,152
Veronica and Jimmy felt free

2253
01:25:21,152 --> 01:25:22,518
and opened up their souls.

2254
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:24,884
Jimmy spoke about how his mother

2255
01:25:24,884 --> 01:25:26,151
had skipped out on us.

2256
01:25:28,084 --> 01:25:30,184
I've never felt so unwanted before.

2257
01:25:31,317 --> 01:25:33,483
I remember crying my bedroom days

2258
01:25:33,483 --> 01:25:35,782
just waiting for her to return.

2259
01:25:36,183 --> 01:25:38,316
He went on to say how he hated his

2260
01:25:38,316 --> 01:25:39,483
father for making her leave us

2261
01:25:40,082 --> 01:25:41,616
and how he dreamed every day of

2262
01:25:41,616 --> 01:25:43,349
of travelling the world,

2263
01:25:43,882 --> 01:25:45,282
seeing things that you can only see

2264
01:25:45,282 --> 01:25:46,848
in Life magazine.

2265
01:25:47,348 --> 01:25:48,581
Veronica was playful.

2266
01:25:49,348 --> 01:25:50,781
She laughed and giggled like

2267
01:25:50,781 --> 01:25:52,781
she was experiencing her first crush.

2268
01:25:53,947 --> 01:25:56,080
She spoke about how she

2269
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,513
dreamed to become a movie star.

2270
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,080
You know, I wanted it

2271
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,713
ever since I was a little girl.

2272
01:26:00,913 --> 01:26:02,046
And now she fell in love

2273
01:26:02,046 --> 01:26:03,379
with the pictures on the big screen when

2274
01:26:03,379 --> 01:26:04,946
my father would take me

2275
01:26:04,946 --> 01:26:06,478
to watch one movie a week.

2276
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:08,478
I remember sitting there

2277
01:26:08,478 --> 01:26:11,112
and looking up at that big screen

2278
01:26:11,112 --> 01:26:13,745
and just wanting to walk right into it,

2279
01:26:14,045 --> 01:26:15,644
imagining that if I did,

2280
01:26:15,943 --> 01:26:17,277
I would be transported

2281
01:26:17,277 --> 01:26:19,111
right there into that movie picture.

2282
01:26:19,277 --> 01:26:20,210
Jimmy laughed.

2283
01:26:20,777 --> 01:26:23,943
Veronica laughed, to anybody who saw them,

2284
01:26:23,977 --> 01:26:24,577
they would have looked

2285
01:26:24,577 --> 01:26:26,410
like the vision of happiness.

2286
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:29,143
Do you believe in one man

2287
01:26:29,143 --> 01:26:30,942
and one woman together forever?

2288
01:26:32,309 --> 01:26:33,041
Of course I do.

2289
01:26:34,309 --> 01:26:35,142
If it's right.

2290
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:37,641
It's forever.

2291
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:40,608
Then maybe it's true.

2292
01:26:42,308 --> 01:26:43,441
Maybe there is one

2293
01:26:43,441 --> 01:26:44,773
perfect person out there,

2294
01:26:44,773 --> 01:26:46,174
I mean, I know I believe that.

2295
01:26:47,207 --> 01:26:48,639
I know that I hurt so much

2296
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:50,005
when I'm not with you.

2297
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:51,473
An unbearable pain.

2298
01:26:53,005 --> 01:26:54,673
That has to mean something, right?

2299
01:26:57,371 --> 01:26:58,839
That's love, Jimmy,

2300
01:26:59,805 --> 01:27:01,138
the pain of love.

2301
01:27:01,405 --> 01:27:03,205
Jimmy was feeling the pain of love,

2302
01:27:03,205 --> 01:27:03,737
alright.

2303
01:27:04,737 --> 01:27:06,671
All he saw was her.

2304
01:27:07,304 --> 01:27:08,571
All I see is you.

2305
01:27:09,537 --> 01:27:11,004
And all I see is you Jimmy.

2306
01:27:11,404 --> 01:27:13,837
And as the sun started

2307
01:27:13,837 --> 01:27:15,436
to set on a perfect day

2308
01:27:15,436 --> 01:27:16,570
in a perfect bubble.

2309
01:27:17,536 --> 01:27:18,303
The question.

2310
01:27:19,403 --> 01:27:22,502
That question came back, and this time,

2311
01:27:23,169 --> 01:27:24,635
the dame wanted an answer.

2312
01:27:25,535 --> 01:27:26,002
You know,

2313
01:27:27,434 --> 01:27:29,868
you never did say much after my suggestion

2314
01:27:29,868 --> 01:27:32,767
that night, erasing Cliff permanently

2315
01:27:33,967 --> 01:27:36,000
cementing us together eternally.

2316
01:27:37,034 --> 01:27:40,032
At that moment, a reality hit Jimmy.

2317
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,600
His mood changed

2318
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,599
and he turned away from her.

2319
01:27:45,432 --> 01:27:46,332
I can't do it.

2320
01:27:47,732 --> 01:27:49,565
I can't kill Cliff.

2321
01:27:49,565 --> 01:27:49,932
Jimmy.

2322
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:50,632
Trust me,

2323
01:27:51,698 --> 01:27:52,931
I want to get you as far away

2324
01:27:52,931 --> 01:27:54,630
from that son of a bitch as possible,

2325
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:56,464
but killing him.

2326
01:27:56,798 --> 01:27:57,198
I mean,

2327
01:27:58,231 --> 01:27:59,496
there's got to be another way.

2328
01:27:59,664 --> 01:28:01,397
There is no other way, Jimmy.

2329
01:28:02,464 --> 01:28:03,996
The only way to get the money

2330
01:28:03,996 --> 01:28:05,230
that we need to leave is

2331
01:28:06,396 --> 01:28:07,929
is to make sure that Cliff is dead.

2332
01:28:08,329 --> 01:28:09,728
No, I refuse to believe

2333
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,396
that we still can't be together

2334
01:28:11,396 --> 01:28:12,762
and run away together.

2335
01:28:12,995 --> 01:28:14,462
People do it all the time.

2336
01:28:14,495 --> 01:28:16,562
It won't work, Jimmy.

2337
01:28:17,162 --> 01:28:17,995
We'll be living on

2338
01:28:17,995 --> 01:28:19,428
the streets in no time.

2339
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:25,994
I love you.

2340
01:28:26,527 --> 01:28:27,827
With things falling apart.

2341
01:28:28,427 --> 01:28:29,527
Veronica, worked fast

2342
01:28:29,527 --> 01:28:31,026
to get Jimmy back on track.

2343
01:28:33,593 --> 01:28:36,192
Jimmy, you know,

2344
01:28:36,192 --> 01:28:37,725
I wasn't going to tell you this,

2345
01:28:37,759 --> 01:28:40,692
I didn't want to frighten you.

2346
01:28:40,692 --> 01:28:42,225
Veronica, what are you talking about?

2347
01:28:44,325 --> 01:28:44,691
Jimmy.

2348
01:28:46,491 --> 01:28:47,157
I'm pregnant.

2349
01:28:50,224 --> 01:28:50,590
What?

2350
01:28:52,490 --> 01:28:54,423
I'm having your child, Jimmy,

2351
01:28:54,423 --> 01:28:56,823
you're going to be a father.

2352
01:28:58,089 --> 01:28:59,523
A father?

2353
01:29:00,589 --> 01:29:02,489
We can do this Jimmy.

2354
01:29:02,489 --> 01:29:06,088
You, me, our child, a family,

2355
01:29:06,621 --> 01:29:07,788
a family, Jimmy.

2356
01:29:08,388 --> 01:29:10,188
I know how much you've always

2357
01:29:10,188 --> 01:29:12,821
wanted to be part of a real family.

2358
01:29:13,721 --> 01:29:15,021
Jimmy arranged the pieces

2359
01:29:15,021 --> 01:29:16,320
of information in his head,

2360
01:29:17,219 --> 01:29:18,387
the thoughts of a future

2361
01:29:18,387 --> 01:29:19,487
with the woman he loved.

2362
01:29:20,153 --> 01:29:22,486
I know it's a big step Jimmy,

2363
01:29:23,419 --> 01:29:25,186
but I know that with our love,

2364
01:29:26,019 --> 01:29:28,352
we can do anything we want.

2365
01:29:29,919 --> 01:29:30,585
I love you.

2366
01:29:31,818 --> 01:29:33,285
I love you so much.

2367
01:29:35,418 --> 01:29:36,684
And?

2368
01:29:39,217 --> 01:29:40,250
Jimmy?

2369
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:42,517
I'll do it.

2370
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:45,916
I'll kill Cliff.

2371
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:50,216
Another victory for Veronica

2372
01:29:50,816 --> 01:29:52,782
and now, well,

2373
01:29:53,949 --> 01:29:55,415
the deal was sealed.

2374
01:29:55,415 --> 01:29:56,882
Cliff Smart

2375
01:29:58,148 --> 01:29:59,281
would have to die.

2376
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,147
She asked you to kill him?

2377
01:30:10,746 --> 01:30:11,446
Things are bad Riff.

2378
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:14,079
He's beaten her so badly,

2379
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:15,812
I mean, you saw the bruises on her face.

2380
01:30:15,879 --> 01:30:16,512
But killing him?

2381
01:30:17,612 --> 01:30:18,879
He ain't a good guy.

2382
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:20,678
We ain't talking about

2383
01:30:20,678 --> 01:30:21,912
some churchgoing hero

2384
01:30:21,912 --> 01:30:23,145
here, we're talking about a man

2385
01:30:23,344 --> 01:30:24,844
who lays his hands on a woman.

2386
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:27,244
Oh, man, you got it bad Jimmy.

2387
01:30:27,244 --> 01:30:29,277
I mean, loving someone is one thing but

2388
01:30:29,544 --> 01:30:30,544
bumping off the competition?

2389
01:30:30,544 --> 01:30:32,244
Well, that's cockeyed.

2390
01:30:32,244 --> 01:30:33,010
She's pregnant.

2391
01:30:33,643 --> 01:30:34,710
With a baby?

2392
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:37,175
No with a flock of sheep Riff.

2393
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:39,509
Jesus Jimmy. A baby?

2394
01:30:39,843 --> 01:30:41,675
Are you sure it ain't her old mans?

2395
01:30:41,675 --> 01:30:42,409
It's mine.

2396
01:30:42,409 --> 01:30:43,942
Her and Cliff don't,

2397
01:30:45,242 --> 01:30:46,508
you know, practice anymore?

2398
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:48,541
She's offered to pay

2399
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:50,108
a thousand bucks to anyone who helps.

2400
01:30:50,241 --> 01:30:50,708
Woah!

2401
01:30:50,708 --> 01:30:52,141
That's life changing.

2402
01:30:52,141 --> 01:30:53,174
I need you to help me.

2403
01:30:53,607 --> 01:30:55,074
I can't do this alone.

2404
01:30:55,174 --> 01:30:56,707
I don't know Jimmy, murder?

2405
01:30:56,707 --> 01:30:58,073
We would get the chair if we get caught.

2406
01:30:58,173 --> 01:30:59,173
We ain't gonna get caught.

2407
01:30:59,173 --> 01:31:00,307
Why can't she do it herself?

2408
01:31:00,307 --> 01:31:02,005
I mean the lady looks like she would be

2409
01:31:02,005 --> 01:31:02,540
with a meat cleaver.

2410
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,106
The first person, the police suspect

2411
01:31:04,106 --> 01:31:05,306
is always the partner.

2412
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:08,472
This way, Veronica

2413
01:31:08,472 --> 01:31:09,839
could be at the school or,

2414
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:12,305
or out when the murder takes place

2415
01:31:12,305 --> 01:31:14,305
and nobody will suspect us, because,

2416
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:16,404
why would they?

2417
01:31:16,737 --> 01:31:18,271
This is crazy talk.

2418
01:31:18,271 --> 01:31:19,103
We're talking about

2419
01:31:19,103 --> 01:31:20,271
murdering Cliff Smart.

2420
01:31:20,371 --> 01:31:21,603
Why can't she just leave him?

2421
01:31:21,670 --> 01:31:22,704
Because he'll take everything

2422
01:31:22,704 --> 01:31:24,003
and leave her with nothing.

2423
01:31:24,003 --> 01:31:26,303
She would be out on her ass

2424
01:31:26,303 --> 01:31:27,536
with no place to call home.

2425
01:31:27,736 --> 01:31:29,036
Jeez.

2426
01:31:31,869 --> 01:31:35,369
If Cliff dies, Veronica gets everything,

2427
01:31:36,102 --> 01:31:37,868
and Cliff is a very wealthy man,

2428
01:31:37,868 --> 01:31:39,168
even more so when he dies.

2429
01:31:39,168 --> 01:31:39,968
And then

2430
01:31:41,234 --> 01:31:42,334
Veronica gets it all.

2431
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:49,100
We could do this, I know we could

2432
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:50,000
and just think then we can

2433
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,066
all get the hell out of here.

2434
01:31:51,433 --> 01:31:53,666
What, the two of us and you new lady?

2435
01:31:53,666 --> 01:31:55,898
Sure, why not, go to Hollywood,

2436
01:31:55,932 --> 01:31:57,332
start again?

2437
01:31:57,332 --> 01:31:59,632
Riff you've been living on the streets,

2438
01:31:59,632 --> 01:32:00,299
you said it yourself,

2439
01:32:00,299 --> 01:32:02,398
you can't keep doing what you're doing.

2440
01:32:03,630 --> 01:32:04,398
This could get you out.

2441
01:32:04,965 --> 01:32:05,398
Yeah.

2442
01:32:06,098 --> 01:32:07,198
It's just that easy.

2443
01:32:08,031 --> 01:32:08,764
And I could get away

2444
01:32:08,764 --> 01:32:11,764
from my dad, for good.

2445
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:15,862
I'm not built for this life.

2446
01:32:17,330 --> 01:32:18,296
I deserve more.

2447
01:32:20,762 --> 01:32:21,596
I deserve love.

2448
01:32:22,129 --> 01:32:25,295
In that moment the boys face a choice.

2449
01:32:25,295 --> 01:32:28,062
Two sixteen year olds wrestling with life

2450
01:32:29,061 --> 01:32:29,728
and death.

2451
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:31,994
A thousand dollars Riff,

2452
01:32:31,994 --> 01:32:33,693
a thousand dollars.

2453
01:32:34,394 --> 01:32:36,427
No, no, I can't do this,

2454
01:32:36,427 --> 01:32:37,594
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

2455
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:38,660
You need to look in a mirror.

2456
01:32:38,693 --> 01:32:39,427
This isn't you.

2457
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:40,660
Riff I ain't got a choice,

2458
01:32:41,393 --> 01:32:42,860
I gotta defend the woman I love.

2459
01:32:43,026 --> 01:32:43,659
You're just listening

2460
01:32:43,759 --> 01:32:44,626
to what she's telling you.

2461
01:32:44,659 --> 01:32:45,626
How do you know what

2462
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:46,992
she's saying is true?

2463
01:32:47,392 --> 01:32:48,392
What are you trying to say Riff?

2464
01:32:48,392 --> 01:32:49,525
Oh, come on, Jimmy,

2465
01:32:49,525 --> 01:32:51,291
you know I like Veronica,

2466
01:32:51,291 --> 01:32:52,791
she's a fun time with a good heart.

2467
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:54,391
But that woman ain't no saint Jimmy.

2468
01:32:54,491 --> 01:32:56,058
Hey don't disrespect her Riff!

2469
01:32:56,058 --> 01:32:57,924
Do you know for sure she's pregnant?

2470
01:32:58,324 --> 01:32:59,624
Do you know that cliff really beats her?

2471
01:32:59,791 --> 01:33:00,724
Riff, you saw the guy,

2472
01:33:00,724 --> 01:33:02,023
you saw how angry he got

2473
01:33:02,023 --> 01:33:03,690
you said that his head nearly exploded.

2474
01:33:03,823 --> 01:33:05,190
I'm just saying, it's a lot to risk

2475
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:06,255
without all the information.

2476
01:33:06,255 --> 01:33:07,223
Information.

2477
01:33:07,255 --> 01:33:08,556
Who are you, a detective?

2478
01:33:09,489 --> 01:33:11,289
I ain't going to say anything,

2479
01:33:12,089 --> 01:33:13,755
but I can not be involved,

2480
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:16,088
and I pray you don't go through this

2481
01:33:16,955 --> 01:33:17,688
Riff, wait.

2482
01:33:19,288 --> 01:33:20,421
What, Jimmy?

2483
01:33:21,621 --> 01:33:23,353
I need your gun.

2484
01:33:24,254 --> 01:33:25,421
If you ain't gonna help,

2485
01:33:25,421 --> 01:33:26,887
you can at least do that.

2486
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:28,219
I ain't got it on me.

2487
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:29,387
I let a friend borrow it.

2488
01:33:29,387 --> 01:33:29,719
Riff.

2489
01:33:30,487 --> 01:33:32,253
Damn you Jimmy Flynn for telling me this.

2490
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:35,386
Fine.

2491
01:33:36,318 --> 01:33:37,786
The night you're going to do the deed

2492
01:33:38,085 --> 01:33:39,552
I'll meet you before

2493
01:33:39,552 --> 01:33:41,018
and let you borrow it.

2494
01:33:44,684 --> 01:33:45,751
Thank you.

2495
01:33:47,518 --> 01:33:49,484
You know, you really are my best friend.

2496
01:33:49,651 --> 01:33:51,050
Whatever you say Jimmy.

2497
01:33:51,117 --> 01:33:51,784
I got to go.

2498
01:33:52,584 --> 01:33:53,650
My future is calling.

2499
01:33:55,782 --> 01:33:56,883
They say the road to hell

2500
01:33:56,883 --> 01:33:58,349
is paved with good intentions,

2501
01:33:58,349 --> 01:34:00,683
and maybe that's the best way to describe

2502
01:34:00,683 --> 01:34:01,482
Jimmy's decision.

2503
01:34:02,116 --> 01:34:04,715
Cliff was now a dead man walking.

2504
01:34:04,715 --> 01:34:07,682
That night, out clearing his head,

2505
01:34:07,682 --> 01:34:09,548
Cliff stops dead in his tracks

2506
01:34:09,548 --> 01:34:11,114
when he sees Riff in front of him

2507
01:34:11,114 --> 01:34:12,148
warming his hands.

2508
01:34:15,114 --> 01:34:15,647
You!

2509
01:34:15,781 --> 01:34:18,680
After a moment Riff's eyes lock on Cliff.

2510
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:20,447
It was like a showdown

2511
01:34:20,447 --> 01:34:21,380
from the Wild West.

2512
01:34:22,013 --> 01:34:23,280
But who would flinch first?

2513
01:34:23,513 --> 01:34:25,779
We still have unfinished business, kid.

2514
01:34:26,279 --> 01:34:27,079
Mr. Smart.

2515
01:34:41,677 --> 01:34:42,943
It's so different.

2516
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:44,277
You look...

2517
01:34:44,543 --> 01:34:45,210
Glamorous?

2518
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:46,510
Older.

2519
01:34:46,843 --> 01:34:47,843
Well, good.

2520
01:34:48,143 --> 01:34:49,243
Hopefully people start

2521
01:34:49,243 --> 01:34:50,376
to see me as a grown-up

2522
01:34:50,376 --> 01:34:51,876
rather than some dumb kid.

2523
01:34:52,709 --> 01:34:54,575
Has your mother see your transformation?

2524
01:34:55,509 --> 01:34:57,075
Oh, she's out.

2525
01:34:57,608 --> 01:34:58,875
She'll see it when she gets back.

2526
01:34:58,907 --> 01:35:00,108
I'm sure she'll think it's fine.

2527
01:35:01,008 --> 01:35:02,708
Have you met your mother?

2528
01:35:02,708 --> 01:35:03,741
And Vivian,

2529
01:35:03,741 --> 01:35:05,907
how did you manage to afford this?

2530
01:35:05,941 --> 01:35:08,607
Oh, Veronica paid, she said,

2531
01:35:08,607 --> 01:35:11,340
I remind her of her when she was my age.

2532
01:35:11,673 --> 01:35:12,573
She's always getting me

2533
01:35:12,573 --> 01:35:14,106
little gifts we're even talking

2534
01:35:14,106 --> 01:35:15,773
about going to Hollywood together.

2535
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:17,206
Hollywood?

2536
01:35:17,206 --> 01:35:18,139
Vivian,

2537
01:35:18,306 --> 01:35:20,239
your mother nearly has heart failure

2538
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:21,705
every time we go camping,

2539
01:35:22,038 --> 01:35:24,271
and that's usually in your backyard.

2540
01:35:25,438 --> 01:35:27,004
Do you think I should go blond?

2541
01:35:27,603 --> 01:35:29,704
I mean, Veronica says the dark suits me,

2542
01:35:29,704 --> 01:35:31,537
but I'm not so sure.

2543
01:35:31,537 --> 01:35:32,670
You do realise that

2544
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:33,937
all that comes out your mouth now

2545
01:35:33,937 --> 01:35:35,570
is about Jimmy's new girlfriend.

2546
01:35:35,603 --> 01:35:36,969
Girlfriend is a stretch Betty.

2547
01:35:38,103 --> 01:35:39,702
He's just some teenage crush.

2548
01:35:40,303 --> 01:35:41,269
Veronica and I,

2549
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:43,036
we have a true connection, like

2550
01:35:43,402 --> 01:35:44,769
on a deeper level, you know.

2551
01:35:45,602 --> 01:35:46,535
Not really.

2552
01:35:46,668 --> 01:35:48,168
Plus, it's nice to have grown up

2553
01:35:48,168 --> 01:35:49,501
conversations for a change.

2554
01:35:51,234 --> 01:35:53,168
So what am I just some dumb kid?

2555
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:55,367
No, you're just different.

2556
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:57,834
What we have is our thing and what I have

2557
01:35:57,834 --> 01:35:59,333
with Veronica, is...

2558
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,733
Better?

2559
01:36:00,733 --> 01:36:01,500
Betty.

2560
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:03,532
You promised that I wouldn't be

2561
01:36:03,532 --> 01:36:05,499
replaced by your new glamorous friend,

2562
01:36:05,799 --> 01:36:07,799
but I hardly see you anymore.

2563
01:36:07,832 --> 01:36:09,332
Why aren't you happy for me?

2564
01:36:09,599 --> 01:36:10,565
You know what, you're supposed

2565
01:36:10,565 --> 01:36:12,032
to be my best friend.

2566
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,165
When it suits you.

2567
01:36:13,165 --> 01:36:15,531
I'm changing Betty and you better get

2568
01:36:15,531 --> 01:36:16,264
used to it or sit down

2569
01:36:16,264 --> 01:36:17,731
and stay the hell out of my way.

2570
01:36:18,098 --> 01:36:19,231
Goodbye, Vivian.

2571
01:36:20,231 --> 01:36:21,630
I know when I'm not wanted.

2572
01:36:22,697 --> 01:36:24,063
I just didn't think it would be you

2573
01:36:24,063 --> 01:36:25,630
that didnt want me.

2574
01:36:26,263 --> 01:36:27,830
Betty!

2575
01:36:28,896 --> 01:36:30,129
Betty?

2576
01:36:33,262 --> 01:36:34,495
Kids.

2577
01:36:39,327 --> 01:36:41,827
My name? Oh,

2578
01:36:43,561 --> 01:36:46,127
it's Vivian, Vivian Pierce.

2579
01:36:46,527 --> 01:36:47,760
It's a pleasure to meet you.

2580
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:50,027
Did I tell you that I was an actress?

2581
01:36:50,927 --> 01:36:54,093
Yes, I've starred in several movies.

2582
01:36:54,259 --> 01:36:56,526
Actually, one critic

2583
01:36:57,026 --> 01:37:01,025
even called me "dazzling".

2584
01:37:04,425 --> 01:37:06,225
What on earth have you done to yourself?

2585
01:37:06,491 --> 01:37:06,991
Mother?

2586
01:37:08,058 --> 01:37:09,757
Take that stuff off your face.

2587
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:11,291
You think going to church

2588
01:37:11,291 --> 01:37:12,389
looking like some teenage

2589
01:37:12,389 --> 01:37:13,823
Jezebel is appropriate?

2590
01:37:14,123 --> 01:37:15,223
It's just make up mother

2591
01:37:15,223 --> 01:37:16,123
and a new hairdo.

2592
01:37:16,257 --> 01:37:18,090
Why did you have to be such a drag?

2593
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:19,723
And I'm not coming to church.

2594
01:37:20,255 --> 01:37:21,323
I feel like you're changing right

2595
01:37:21,323 --> 01:37:21,989
in front of my eyes

2596
01:37:21,989 --> 01:37:23,056
and I can't reach you.

2597
01:37:23,556 --> 01:37:24,489
I keep trying but

2598
01:37:24,489 --> 01:37:25,822
you keep pushing me away.

2599
01:37:25,922 --> 01:37:27,955
You need to stop worrying about me.

2600
01:37:28,388 --> 01:37:29,888
You've done your job, mother.

2601
01:37:30,388 --> 01:37:32,088
Now it's time for me to take over.

2602
01:37:32,154 --> 01:37:33,487
Vivian, I think it's time

2603
01:37:33,487 --> 01:37:34,687
I put my foot down.

2604
01:37:34,687 --> 01:37:36,487
You would have to take it off my throat

2605
01:37:36,787 --> 01:37:37,954
first mother.

2606
01:37:37,987 --> 01:37:39,053
You listen to me.

2607
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:41,053
No, you listen to me.

2608
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:42,786
This constant need

2609
01:37:42,786 --> 01:37:46,619
to turn me into you is nauseating mother.

2610
01:37:47,219 --> 01:37:49,352
I don't want to be Vivian Pierce.

2611
01:37:49,619 --> 01:37:51,385
There's nothing wrong with her.

2612
01:37:51,418 --> 01:37:54,218
She's so black and white.

2613
01:37:54,518 --> 01:37:55,985
I want to see the world in color.

2614
01:37:56,085 --> 01:37:57,418
I wan to be like those ladies

2615
01:37:57,451 --> 01:37:58,751
who can just click their fingers

2616
01:37:58,751 --> 01:38:00,084
and get whatever they want.

2617
01:38:00,251 --> 01:38:01,617
Well, that is not the real world Vivian.

2618
01:38:01,884 --> 01:38:04,183
No, that is not your world, mother.

2619
01:38:07,216 --> 01:38:08,216
Look at you.

2620
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:11,282
You give up the day you got married.

2621
01:38:11,882 --> 01:38:13,249
Vivian, your father will...

2622
01:38:13,249 --> 01:38:13,716
What?

2623
01:38:14,815 --> 01:38:16,548
Go ahead and call my father.

2624
01:38:16,582 --> 01:38:17,982
I'm not scared of him.

2625
01:38:19,948 --> 01:38:21,781
You know, you can't think

2626
01:38:22,081 --> 01:38:24,314
without a man telling you what to do.

2627
01:38:24,914 --> 01:38:26,847
If it's not father, it's God.

2628
01:38:31,913 --> 01:38:33,013
Is this because of that woman?

2629
01:38:34,978 --> 01:38:36,112
I've seen her around town,

2630
01:38:36,112 --> 01:38:37,579
you know, your actress friend.

2631
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:39,679
Flashy is not attractive

2632
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:40,679
on a woman her age.

2633
01:38:40,679 --> 01:38:42,378
And jealousy is not attractive

2634
01:38:42,378 --> 01:38:43,612
and a woman of your age.

2635
01:38:44,611 --> 01:38:45,545
Give me that dress.

2636
01:38:46,011 --> 01:38:46,844
Give it back mother.

2637
01:38:46,844 --> 01:38:48,644
This is not you Vivian.

2638
01:38:48,644 --> 01:38:49,344
Give it back now.

2639
01:38:49,344 --> 01:38:51,210
What has gotten into you?

2640
01:38:55,843 --> 01:38:59,675
Keep your hands off of my things, Jean.

2641
01:39:01,609 --> 01:39:02,609
Please respect that.

2642
01:39:10,508 --> 01:39:11,641
Vivian.

2643
01:39:13,641 --> 01:39:14,741
You don't need to be

2644
01:39:14,741 --> 01:39:16,041
in such a rush to grow up.

2645
01:39:19,507 --> 01:39:21,840
The world is not always kind to women.

2646
01:39:24,106 --> 01:39:25,439
Do you think I didn't have dreams?

2647
01:39:28,306 --> 01:39:30,005
I wanted to open my own sewing shop.

2648
01:39:31,005 --> 01:39:33,138
Atlantic City, near the boardwalk

2649
01:39:34,438 --> 01:39:36,904
that's where I dreamed of opening it.

2650
01:39:39,304 --> 01:39:41,037
But life isn't a dream Vivian,

2651
01:39:42,937 --> 01:39:43,837
do you think this lady

2652
01:39:43,837 --> 01:39:45,137
is going to turn you into a star?

2653
01:39:45,503 --> 01:39:46,503
She's not.

2654
01:39:48,070 --> 01:39:50,103
That doesn't happen for girls like you.

2655
01:39:54,136 --> 01:39:55,835
You gave up your dream

2656
01:39:57,535 --> 01:39:59,568
because you're weak.

2657
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:14,933
Good morning, sweetheart.

2658
01:40:15,966 --> 01:40:16,799
What's all this?

2659
01:40:17,332 --> 01:40:17,866
Breakfast.

2660
01:40:18,699 --> 01:40:20,264
You know, now we've got our own

2661
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:21,565
little bundle of joy on the way.

2662
01:40:21,565 --> 01:40:22,998
I thought I ought to learn to do

2663
01:40:22,998 --> 01:40:24,032
my part around here.

2664
01:40:24,665 --> 01:40:26,365
Well, crazier things have happened,

2665
01:40:26,365 --> 01:40:27,098
I suppose.

2666
01:40:31,231 --> 01:40:31,996
I told my mother.

2667
01:40:32,364 --> 01:40:33,496
You told your mother?

2668
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,496
I couldn't wait.

2669
01:40:34,496 --> 01:40:35,697
It was bursting out of me.

2670
01:40:35,730 --> 01:40:38,263
I specifically told you not to tell her.

2671
01:40:38,763 --> 01:40:39,829
It's still early.

2672
01:40:40,263 --> 01:40:41,129
And as you pointed out,

2673
01:40:41,129 --> 01:40:42,496
I'm an old shrew now.

2674
01:40:42,496 --> 01:40:45,495
So this is clearly a delicate pregnancy.

2675
01:40:45,862 --> 01:40:47,628
Well, I never called you a shrew.

2676
01:40:48,628 --> 01:40:49,262
Coffee?

2677
01:40:49,861 --> 01:40:50,528
Thank you.

2678
01:40:51,327 --> 01:40:53,994
Now, Cliff, please don't go

2679
01:40:53,994 --> 01:40:56,027
sharing our news with anybody else,

2680
01:40:56,294 --> 01:40:57,527
especially the boys at work.

2681
01:40:57,994 --> 01:40:59,559
Don't think I don't know you can out

2682
01:40:59,559 --> 01:41:00,993
gossip the ladies at the markets.

2683
01:41:01,693 --> 01:41:03,126
I swear on all the Saints.

2684
01:41:04,425 --> 01:41:06,826
I can't tell you how excited I am.

2685
01:41:07,826 --> 01:41:09,059
I can't sleep anymore

2686
01:41:09,059 --> 01:41:10,459
knowing that the day I dreamt

2687
01:41:10,459 --> 01:41:12,692
about is so close.

2688
01:41:12,692 --> 01:41:14,225
It's a new start.

2689
01:41:15,291 --> 01:41:16,891
We still have time, Cliff.

2690
01:41:17,191 --> 01:41:19,624
Let's not go wasting all of our joy.

2691
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:21,557
We'll have none left for the child.

2692
01:41:25,557 --> 01:41:29,023
You um, you are

2693
01:41:29,689 --> 01:41:32,289
excited about our baby aren't you?

2694
01:41:32,289 --> 01:41:33,621
I can hardly wait.

2695
01:41:33,922 --> 01:41:35,389
That's what I needed to hear.

2696
01:41:36,589 --> 01:41:36,987
Now,

2697
01:41:38,355 --> 01:41:39,621
do you need anything else before I go?

2698
01:41:40,987 --> 01:41:42,621
Cliff I'm not even showing yet.

2699
01:41:43,321 --> 01:41:44,821
I think I'm perfectly capable

2700
01:41:44,821 --> 01:41:46,021
of looking after myself

2701
01:41:46,021 --> 01:41:46,987
whilst you're at work.

2702
01:41:47,487 --> 01:41:49,054
After all, I have done it

2703
01:41:49,054 --> 01:41:50,420
for the past 16 years.

2704
01:41:51,387 --> 01:41:52,053
OK, baby.

2705
01:41:54,186 --> 01:41:55,318
Have a good day, Cliff.

2706
01:41:55,886 --> 01:41:56,653
Oh, and

2707
01:41:57,919 --> 01:41:58,486
Veronica.

2708
01:41:59,485 --> 01:42:00,619
Yes, Cliff.

2709
01:42:01,885 --> 01:42:03,152
You are starting to show a little.

2710
01:42:06,118 --> 01:42:07,451
It's beautiful.

2711
01:42:08,550 --> 01:42:09,284
What?

2712
01:42:10,317 --> 01:42:11,017
Bye baby.

2713
01:42:18,083 --> 01:42:19,816
The moment Cliff left the room,

2714
01:42:19,816 --> 01:42:21,216
Veronica jumps up

2715
01:42:21,216 --> 01:42:22,148
and heads for the phone.

2716
01:42:24,849 --> 01:42:27,282
Operator, connect me to New York,

2717
01:42:27,282 --> 01:42:28,682
seven, three, two, four please.

2718
01:42:29,348 --> 01:42:29,815
Thank you.

2719
01:42:32,648 --> 01:42:33,248
Is that you?

2720
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:35,880
Oh, Jimmy, we have to do this soon.

2721
01:42:36,347 --> 01:42:38,114
His temper is out of control.

2722
01:42:38,414 --> 01:42:39,847
My face still stings.

2723
01:42:40,013 --> 01:42:41,580
He ain't ever going to learn is he?

2724
01:42:42,513 --> 01:42:44,446
He's just bad, bad to the core.

2725
01:42:44,913 --> 01:42:47,812
Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, I am scared.

2726
01:42:48,379 --> 01:42:50,412
I'm scared for the life of our baby.

2727
01:42:51,279 --> 01:42:51,912
Don't worry.

2728
01:42:53,512 --> 01:42:54,612
I'm ready when you are.

2729
01:42:55,011 --> 01:42:55,745
Oh, Jimmy.

2730
01:42:56,645 --> 01:42:58,978
Every time I hear your voice, it's

2731
01:42:59,378 --> 01:43:01,044
like the rain clouds lifting.

2732
01:43:01,844 --> 01:43:02,977
I can see clearly,

2733
01:43:03,577 --> 01:43:06,110
I can see our future so clearly.

2734
01:43:07,010 --> 01:43:08,076
When should we do this?

2735
01:43:08,910 --> 01:43:10,009
Tomorrow night, Jimmy.

2736
01:43:10,709 --> 01:43:12,409
We have to do this tomorrow night.

2737
01:43:13,342 --> 01:43:14,309
Tell me you love me.

2738
01:43:16,209 --> 01:43:17,808
Jimmy, I gotta go.

2739
01:43:24,907 --> 01:43:26,807
Vivian, well, don't

2740
01:43:26,807 --> 01:43:28,240
you look like a knockout?

2741
01:43:28,574 --> 01:43:30,073
I knew that dress would suit you.

2742
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:32,073
Oh, thank you Veronica.

2743
01:43:32,073 --> 01:43:33,406
You look beautiful, too.

2744
01:43:33,973 --> 01:43:34,505
Why thank you.

2745
01:43:35,139 --> 01:43:36,673
Now Vivian, what are you doing here?

2746
01:43:36,906 --> 01:43:38,172
Not that I'm not delighted

2747
01:43:38,172 --> 01:43:39,339
for your visit, of course.

2748
01:43:39,572 --> 01:43:40,672
Well, since we didn't

2749
01:43:40,672 --> 01:43:41,839
meet this week after school,

2750
01:43:41,839 --> 01:43:44,038
I thought I'd stop by and say hello.

2751
01:43:44,605 --> 01:43:45,805
That's what friends do, isn't it?

2752
01:43:46,071 --> 01:43:48,171
They pop by and say hello.

2753
01:43:48,638 --> 01:43:50,404
And we are friends, aren't we, Veronica?

2754
01:43:50,937 --> 01:43:52,637
Of course Vivian.

2755
01:43:53,969 --> 01:43:57,103
In fact, I'm delighted you stopped by.

2756
01:43:57,403 --> 01:43:58,070
Really?

2757
01:43:58,070 --> 01:43:58,736
Sure.

2758
01:43:59,236 --> 01:44:00,903
I mean, I think it's about time

2759
01:44:00,903 --> 01:44:02,436
we had another acting lesson.

2760
01:44:02,536 --> 01:44:05,434
Only this time let's do it away from here

2761
01:44:05,434 --> 01:44:06,702
or or the school.

2762
01:44:07,002 --> 01:44:08,102
Let's make it more like

2763
01:44:08,502 --> 01:44:10,501
two girls out on the town.

2764
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:11,601
Oh, Mrs. Smart.

2765
01:44:11,635 --> 01:44:12,634
I would love that.

2766
01:44:13,034 --> 01:44:14,867
We could go to a bar and well,

2767
01:44:14,901 --> 01:44:16,101
I could teach you all about

2768
01:44:16,101 --> 01:44:18,034
how to audition for a movie picture.

2769
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:19,434
A drink?

2770
01:44:19,933 --> 01:44:20,733
In a bar?

2771
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:21,600
Sure.

2772
01:44:21,867 --> 01:44:22,866
Oh, Mrs. Smart.

2773
01:44:23,233 --> 01:44:24,333
I would love that.

2774
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:26,199
But I'm only fifteen.

2775
01:44:26,733 --> 01:44:28,532
But in this dress, Vivian,

2776
01:44:28,532 --> 01:44:30,932
you look like a beautiful woman.

2777
01:44:31,332 --> 01:44:32,398
Every bar in town

2778
01:44:32,398 --> 01:44:33,065
will want you to light

2779
01:44:33,065 --> 01:44:35,565
up their establishment and it'll be nice.

2780
01:44:36,065 --> 01:44:37,198
Just us girls.

2781
01:44:38,164 --> 01:44:41,397
Just us girls?

2782
01:44:41,397 --> 01:44:41,831
You and I?

2783
01:44:41,831 --> 01:44:44,564
A sweet gesture, a blossoming friendship.

2784
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:47,830
No, Veronica was lining up

2785
01:44:47,830 --> 01:44:49,663
alibis like a professional crook.

2786
01:44:50,362 --> 01:44:51,963
Poor sweet Vivian

2787
01:44:51,963 --> 01:44:53,829
was caught up in Veronica's web.

2788
01:44:55,228 --> 01:44:55,862
Mrs. Smart.

2789
01:44:55,895 --> 01:44:56,762
I would love that.

2790
01:44:56,762 --> 01:44:59,228
I, I want to learn everything from you.

2791
01:44:59,228 --> 01:45:01,495
And I will teach you everything

2792
01:45:01,495 --> 01:45:02,561
that you want to know.

2793
01:45:04,693 --> 01:45:07,994
I've never had any real friends before.

2794
01:45:08,527 --> 01:45:10,027
Oh, well, except Betty, and she's well,

2795
01:45:10,627 --> 01:45:11,559
she's just a kid.

2796
01:45:12,793 --> 01:45:14,093
I've never really had anybody

2797
01:45:14,093 --> 01:45:15,493
that truly understands me.

2798
01:45:16,293 --> 01:45:17,226
Everybody just

2799
01:45:18,459 --> 01:45:19,392
passed me by.

2800
01:45:21,559 --> 01:45:22,657
I hope you know how much

2801
01:45:22,657 --> 01:45:24,058
I value our relationship.

2802
01:45:24,325 --> 01:45:26,291
Oh, as do I, Vivian.

2803
01:45:27,157 --> 01:45:28,124
So why don't we say

2804
01:45:28,491 --> 01:45:29,891
eight thirty tomorrow night?

2805
01:45:30,091 --> 01:45:31,257
Perhaps you could tell your mother

2806
01:45:31,257 --> 01:45:32,523
you're staying at a friend's place.

2807
01:45:32,590 --> 01:45:33,957
My mother doesn't control me.

2808
01:45:34,157 --> 01:45:35,357
I want to be like you.

2809
01:45:35,357 --> 01:45:36,823
Strong. Confident.

2810
01:45:37,057 --> 01:45:37,590
I'm afraid.

2811
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:39,990
I don't feel very strong lately.

2812
01:45:40,123 --> 01:45:40,423
Vivian.

2813
01:45:40,723 --> 01:45:41,489
What do you mean?

2814
01:45:43,522 --> 01:45:45,822
My life is is complicated.

2815
01:45:46,522 --> 01:45:47,222
Mr. Smart?

2816
01:45:49,621 --> 01:45:51,487
You know, I used to be like you, Vivian.

2817
01:45:51,487 --> 01:45:54,621
I dreamed of a life in the spotlight.

2818
01:45:54,987 --> 01:45:56,554
People calling my name

2819
01:45:56,887 --> 01:45:58,187
surrounded by glamour

2820
01:45:58,187 --> 01:46:00,153
and most of all, friends.

2821
01:46:00,287 --> 01:46:02,686
But the day I married Cliff,

2822
01:46:02,686 --> 01:46:04,286
I think I let a part of that die.

2823
01:46:04,486 --> 01:46:06,519
No, no, it's still in there.

2824
01:46:07,386 --> 01:46:08,152
Perhaps. But

2825
01:46:09,486 --> 01:46:10,352
I think every time

2826
01:46:10,352 --> 01:46:11,785
Cliff strikes my face,

2827
01:46:13,052 --> 01:46:14,318
he takes a little more of me.

2828
01:46:16,518 --> 01:46:17,085
Veronica.

2829
01:46:17,851 --> 01:46:18,918
You don't need a man.

2830
01:46:19,418 --> 01:46:20,617
I mean, why do any of us

2831
01:46:20,617 --> 01:46:21,584
need men, really?

2832
01:46:21,916 --> 01:46:23,517
They always ruin everything.

2833
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:27,583
My father's idea of raising

2834
01:46:27,583 --> 01:46:28,782
a child is shouting at it

2835
01:46:28,883 --> 01:46:32,183
when called on by my mother.

2836
01:46:32,648 --> 01:46:33,749
Maybe...

2837
01:46:34,216 --> 01:46:35,749
Maybe what sweetheart?

2838
01:46:36,349 --> 01:46:38,215
Maybe we can move to Hollywood together.

2839
01:46:38,582 --> 01:46:39,715
Two girls ready to

2840
01:46:39,715 --> 01:46:40,981
take on the big screen.

2841
01:46:40,981 --> 01:46:42,880
Oh, Hollywood won't know what hit it.

2842
01:46:43,114 --> 01:46:44,681
You could leave Cliff.

2843
01:46:44,681 --> 01:46:46,681
We could just drive there together.

2844
01:46:46,681 --> 01:46:48,414
Oh, Veronica, imagine.

2845
01:46:49,714 --> 01:46:51,513
Well, that sounds wonderful, Vivian.

2846
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:54,213
A dream, but wonderful.

2847
01:46:55,213 --> 01:46:56,546
It doesn't have to be.

2848
01:46:57,246 --> 01:46:58,912
Cliff is so awful to you.

2849
01:46:58,912 --> 01:47:00,344
Why can't he just drop dead?

2850
01:47:00,379 --> 01:47:02,145
Oh, Vivian, you shouldn't

2851
01:47:02,145 --> 01:47:03,245
say such a thing.

2852
01:47:03,577 --> 01:47:05,311
Well, you'd feel positively awful

2853
01:47:05,311 --> 01:47:06,911
if something were to happen to him now.

2854
01:47:07,445 --> 01:47:08,710
I doubt it.

2855
01:47:10,311 --> 01:47:10,977
Look, Vivian,

2856
01:47:10,977 --> 01:47:13,344
I need to head into town, so.

2857
01:47:13,377 --> 01:47:14,677
Oh, oh.

2858
01:47:14,943 --> 01:47:16,410
Sorry, I'll go.

2859
01:47:17,043 --> 01:47:18,943
Oh, shall we say.

2860
01:47:19,276 --> 01:47:20,409
Eight thirty tomorrow.

2861
01:47:20,409 --> 01:47:21,709
Outside the front of the school?

2862
01:47:22,143 --> 01:47:23,776
Sure Veronica, I can um,

2863
01:47:25,109 --> 01:47:26,142
I can hardly wait.

2864
01:47:36,174 --> 01:47:37,574
Why don't you, uh

2865
01:47:38,307 --> 01:47:40,007
come sit on my lap,

2866
01:47:40,507 --> 01:47:42,173
let daddy take care of you.

2867
01:47:43,273 --> 01:47:44,940
OK, baby,

2868
01:47:45,773 --> 01:47:47,073
you like that daddy?

2869
01:47:47,573 --> 01:47:48,639
I do indeed.

2870
01:47:49,772 --> 01:47:50,306
So

2871
01:47:51,739 --> 01:47:52,539
how are you

2872
01:47:53,305 --> 01:47:54,838
going to make your old man happy?

2873
01:47:55,737 --> 01:47:57,505
Whatever you want me to do,

2874
01:47:57,971 --> 01:47:59,671
you're paying.

2875
01:48:00,371 --> 01:48:01,504
Don't talk like that.

2876
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:06,170
Don't talk like a whore.

2877
01:48:06,503 --> 01:48:08,436
OK baby.

2878
01:48:11,969 --> 01:48:13,236
Jimmy.

2879
01:48:13,736 --> 01:48:14,602
I thought I told you

2880
01:48:14,602 --> 01:48:16,135
stay away tonight, I had company.

2881
01:48:16,869 --> 01:48:18,768
Hi dollface, I'm the company.

2882
01:48:18,768 --> 01:48:19,402
I'm sorry.

2883
01:48:19,402 --> 01:48:19,968
I forgot.

2884
01:48:20,102 --> 01:48:21,768
Are you trying to be lippy with me?

2885
01:48:22,068 --> 01:48:23,268
Look dad, I've had a tough day.

2886
01:48:23,268 --> 01:48:23,968
I want to go to bed.

2887
01:48:24,334 --> 01:48:25,867
Tough day?

2888
01:48:25,867 --> 01:48:28,267
My kid, sixteen, at high school.

2889
01:48:28,267 --> 01:48:29,700
Thinks he's had a tough day.

2890
01:48:30,267 --> 01:48:32,567
You don't even know what a tough day is.

2891
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,400
You try breaking your back

2892
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:35,400
every day at work.

2893
01:48:35,566 --> 01:48:38,066
Then you can tell me about a tough day.

2894
01:48:38,732 --> 01:48:40,199
Look, I should go Harvey.

2895
01:48:40,199 --> 01:48:41,764
Sit down!

2896
01:48:43,432 --> 01:48:45,132
You're not going anywhere tonight.

2897
01:48:45,465 --> 01:48:48,130
I'd get out of here if I were you.

2898
01:48:48,130 --> 01:48:49,464
He likes to use his fists

2899
01:48:49,464 --> 01:48:50,597
to beat the women around him.

2900
01:48:51,231 --> 01:48:52,364
Harvey, I'm out of here.

2901
01:48:56,563 --> 01:48:57,930
Do it, go on.

2902
01:48:58,463 --> 01:48:59,830
Let me tell you something, Jimmy Flynn.

2903
01:49:00,896 --> 01:49:02,496
I have protected you from this for years.

2904
01:49:02,596 --> 01:49:03,929
I will not let you talk

2905
01:49:03,929 --> 01:49:04,762
that way about me.

2906
01:49:07,129 --> 01:49:09,495
Your mom was a drunk.

2907
01:49:09,928 --> 01:49:11,695
She would come home every night

2908
01:49:11,695 --> 01:49:13,728
starting a fight throwing things,

2909
01:49:13,728 --> 01:49:14,228
hitting me.

2910
01:49:14,228 --> 01:49:15,094
That's a lie.

2911
01:49:15,094 --> 01:49:16,727
She left you outside of church

2912
01:49:16,727 --> 01:49:18,394
when you were just seven months old.

2913
01:49:18,794 --> 01:49:19,994
She wanted to go to some bar,

2914
01:49:19,994 --> 01:49:21,893
but you were in the way.

2915
01:49:21,893 --> 01:49:22,960
So I came to get you again.

2916
01:49:22,993 --> 01:49:24,226
Why are you lying?

2917
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:25,759
She screwed every man

2918
01:49:25,759 --> 01:49:27,826
without a single thought of you and me.

2919
01:49:28,626 --> 01:49:30,791
So, yeah, you may see me

2920
01:49:30,791 --> 01:49:31,992
as the bad guy, and yeah,

2921
01:49:33,525 --> 01:49:34,925
I ain't perfect,

2922
01:49:35,458 --> 01:49:36,725
you know what,

2923
01:49:37,657 --> 01:49:38,891
I'm still here.

2924
01:49:39,758 --> 01:49:41,124
I'm still here.

2925
01:49:41,124 --> 01:49:42,191
No, no, no.

2926
01:49:42,424 --> 01:49:43,824
You pushed her away.

2927
01:49:44,790 --> 01:49:47,057
Women lie Jimmy, always

2928
01:49:47,057 --> 01:49:49,323
remember that, women lie.

2929
01:49:51,423 --> 01:49:55,456
No dad, that's you.

2930
01:49:56,121 --> 01:49:59,555
Life is easier without them.

2931
01:50:00,821 --> 01:50:03,154
I got mine back when she left.

2932
01:50:04,788 --> 01:50:06,021
And look at you, dad.

2933
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:09,420
You're an embarrassment.

2934
01:50:11,187 --> 01:50:12,153
Spending all the money

2935
01:50:12,153 --> 01:50:13,853
that you make on booze and whores.

2936
01:50:13,886 --> 01:50:15,452
I never, ever

2937
01:50:16,686 --> 01:50:17,886
want to turn out like you.

2938
01:50:18,252 --> 01:50:19,452
Jimmy.

2939
01:50:19,452 --> 01:50:20,318
I know love.

2940
01:50:21,684 --> 01:50:22,452
I've found love,

2941
01:50:22,452 --> 01:50:23,952
I'd kill for love and I tell you

2942
01:50:23,952 --> 01:50:25,318
I've never felt more alive.

2943
01:50:25,318 --> 01:50:27,651
So if you want to fade away,

2944
01:50:28,918 --> 01:50:30,451
then that's fine.

2945
01:50:31,550 --> 01:50:33,317
But I ain't going down with you.

2946
01:50:33,317 --> 01:50:34,617
Do you hear me, old man?

2947
01:50:34,817 --> 01:50:35,983
I ain't going down with you.

2948
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:42,049
(Train Sounds)

2949
01:50:58,447 --> 01:50:59,214
Ha!

2950
01:51:01,413 --> 01:51:02,680
Well, you look like

2951
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:03,112
you've got the weight

2952
01:51:03,112 --> 01:51:04,213
of the world on shoulders.

2953
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:05,879
Now that I could handle.

2954
01:51:05,879 --> 01:51:06,513
What's going on?

2955
01:51:07,246 --> 01:51:08,046
Why aren't you with Jimmy?

2956
01:51:08,213 --> 01:51:09,612
We're not joined at the hip you know.

2957
01:51:09,612 --> 01:51:11,512
No, but you seem to share a brain.

2958
01:51:11,512 --> 01:51:12,012
Haha,

2959
01:51:12,012 --> 01:51:14,312
you should have been a circus clown.

2960
01:51:14,512 --> 01:51:15,012
Riff!

2961
01:51:15,012 --> 01:51:16,611
What happened to your face?

2962
01:51:16,611 --> 01:51:19,244
I walked into a fist, it's New York City,

2963
01:51:19,244 --> 01:51:20,111
what are you gonna do.

2964
01:51:20,844 --> 01:51:21,511
Well, are you OK?

2965
01:51:21,811 --> 01:51:23,011
Honestly, I'm fine.

2966
01:51:27,077 --> 01:51:29,010
Vivian, can I ask you something?

2967
01:51:29,010 --> 01:51:29,543
Sure,

2968
01:51:30,143 --> 01:51:31,743
as long as it's not asking me on a date.

2969
01:51:31,843 --> 01:51:33,043
Not a date, fear not.

2970
01:51:35,276 --> 01:51:36,342
Do you trust Veronica?

2971
01:51:36,375 --> 01:51:37,409
What do you mean trust her?

2972
01:51:37,442 --> 01:51:38,407
You know, the thing

2973
01:51:38,407 --> 01:51:39,808
she says the things about Cliff.

2974
01:51:39,808 --> 01:51:41,075
He's a monster Riff.

2975
01:51:41,075 --> 01:51:42,475
Veronica is one of the most honest

2976
01:51:42,475 --> 01:51:44,308
and trustworthy people I've ever met.

2977
01:51:44,508 --> 01:51:45,674
DIal it down, you sound like you

2978
01:51:45,674 --> 01:51:46,341
run her fan club.

2979
01:51:46,574 --> 01:51:48,074
Well, Veronica cares about us.

2980
01:51:48,107 --> 01:51:49,940
I mean, she's more of a mother to me...

2981
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:50,540
Yeah, but...

2982
01:51:50,540 --> 01:51:52,340
Yeah, but nothing Riff Randall.

2983
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:55,373
I mean, Veronica has taught me so much.

2984
01:51:55,540 --> 01:51:57,039
I mean, she stopped and gave me,

2985
01:51:57,073 --> 01:51:58,639
gave us the time of day.

2986
01:51:59,439 --> 01:52:00,272
I mean, what other adult

2987
01:52:00,339 --> 01:52:01,605
wants to listen to us, huh?

2988
01:52:02,039 --> 01:52:04,105
Like really listen.

2989
01:52:04,772 --> 01:52:06,505
Oh Vivian, I'm wrestling

2990
01:52:06,505 --> 01:52:07,671
with something real bad.

2991
01:52:08,105 --> 01:52:10,871
What are you talking about, Riff?

2992
01:52:10,871 --> 01:52:11,804
Can I trust you

2993
01:52:12,804 --> 01:52:14,337
that no matter what I say,

2994
01:52:14,337 --> 01:52:15,469
it stays between us.

2995
01:52:15,704 --> 01:52:17,337
This is serious, Vivian,

2996
01:52:17,337 --> 01:52:19,170
and it isn't some silly, childish thing.

2997
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:20,603
I don't know if you've noticed but

2998
01:52:20,603 --> 01:52:22,436
I've done a lot of growing up recently.

2999
01:52:22,702 --> 01:52:24,002
So I swear to you,

3000
01:52:24,335 --> 01:52:25,436
I'll take it to the grave.

3001
01:52:27,235 --> 01:52:29,335
Veronica has asked Jimmy to kill Cliff.

3002
01:52:32,268 --> 01:52:33,268
What?

3003
01:52:33,268 --> 01:52:35,201
Jimmy's asked me to be involved as well.

3004
01:52:35,201 --> 01:52:36,434
And it's a thousand bucks,

3005
01:52:36,434 --> 01:52:37,734
which is more money than I ever

3006
01:52:37,734 --> 01:52:38,234
thought I'd see.

3007
01:52:38,234 --> 01:52:39,100
But I can't, can I?

3008
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:40,967
Woah Riff.

3009
01:52:40,967 --> 01:52:41,967
Slow down.

3010
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:43,233
I know he beats her.

3011
01:52:43,233 --> 01:52:44,532
At least that's what she says, but

3012
01:52:44,933 --> 01:52:46,833
murder is just so final, you know,

3013
01:52:46,866 --> 01:52:48,166
I mean, how could I live with that?

3014
01:52:49,532 --> 01:52:51,132
When is this supposed to happen?

3015
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:53,732
Tomorrow night, he's gone girl crazy.

3016
01:52:53,865 --> 01:52:54,832
It's like he thinks that

3017
01:52:54,832 --> 01:52:56,598
if he kills Cliff, Veronica

3018
01:52:56,598 --> 01:52:57,898
will fall madly in love with him.

3019
01:52:57,898 --> 01:53:00,398
The whole thing is just hairbrained.

3020
01:53:00,764 --> 01:53:02,931
Jeez, killing her husband

3021
01:53:02,931 --> 01:53:05,130
to prove his love for her.

3022
01:53:05,130 --> 01:53:06,397
Ain't that something.

3023
01:53:06,397 --> 01:53:08,696
Should I call the police?

3024
01:53:08,696 --> 01:53:10,563
Should I try to stop him? No, no, no.

3025
01:53:10,596 --> 01:53:11,929
He'll go to prison Riff.

3026
01:53:11,929 --> 01:53:13,596
You need to be there and stop him

3027
01:53:13,596 --> 01:53:15,196
from making a stupid mistake.

3028
01:53:15,396 --> 01:53:16,495
He won't listen to me.

3029
01:53:16,529 --> 01:53:17,795
I've already tried.

3030
01:53:17,929 --> 01:53:18,962
Well, if he doesn't,

3031
01:53:18,995 --> 01:53:20,327
then go to the police.

3032
01:53:20,562 --> 01:53:21,761
Just, just stop it.

3033
01:53:22,195 --> 01:53:24,361
This could ruin his life and Veronicas is

3034
01:53:24,394 --> 01:53:25,327
if they get caught.

3035
01:53:25,861 --> 01:53:28,261
We can't allow that to happen Riff.

3036
01:53:28,261 --> 01:53:30,027
Vivian, you better

3037
01:53:30,027 --> 01:53:31,660
not be down by the tracks.

3038
01:53:32,327 --> 01:53:35,925
She is driving me crazy.

3039
01:53:37,093 --> 01:53:38,992
God, killing Cliff.

3040
01:53:38,992 --> 01:53:41,159
Riff, you need to stop it.

3041
01:53:41,192 --> 01:53:44,125
We can't allow Veronica to get hurt.

3042
01:53:44,325 --> 01:53:45,825
She could get sent away

3043
01:53:45,825 --> 01:53:46,691
if she gets caught,

3044
01:53:46,691 --> 01:53:48,258
and that's not the way for her

3045
01:53:48,258 --> 01:53:49,324
to get away from Cliff.

3046
01:53:49,458 --> 01:53:51,624
Veronica, you worried about Veronica?

3047
01:53:52,457 --> 01:53:53,057
I've got to go.

3048
01:53:53,057 --> 01:53:53,624
I'm sorry.

3049
01:53:53,690 --> 01:53:55,590
Vivian, but that's not the whole story.

3050
01:53:55,889 --> 01:53:58,490
I still have more need to say, Vivian!

3051
01:54:01,223 --> 01:54:04,222
(Train Sounds)

3052
01:54:10,522 --> 01:54:12,355
It's 7:30 a.m. on the big day, Cliff.

3053
01:54:12,355 --> 01:54:12,987
Well, Cliff

3054
01:54:14,388 --> 01:54:15,388
wakes up to a life

3055
01:54:15,388 --> 01:54:16,454
he could only dream of.

3056
01:54:17,321 --> 01:54:18,554
Cliff stands and stares

3057
01:54:18,554 --> 01:54:20,020
at Veronica for a few moments

3058
01:54:20,587 --> 01:54:21,787
as she prepares breakfast.

3059
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:24,886
I want to remember this moment.

3060
01:54:25,053 --> 01:54:26,786
Oh, Cliff, you startled me.

3061
01:54:27,919 --> 01:54:29,386
I feel like I'm looking at a new you.

3062
01:54:30,585 --> 01:54:31,318
What's the occasion?

3063
01:54:31,885 --> 01:54:33,318
It's just breakfast.

3064
01:54:34,452 --> 01:54:35,085
I'm already late.

3065
01:54:36,585 --> 01:54:37,485
I've got a big day,

3066
01:54:39,318 --> 01:54:40,550
but I can take it to go.

3067
01:54:41,651 --> 01:54:42,984
You're always on the move.

3068
01:54:47,916 --> 01:54:48,416
Oh, and

3069
01:54:50,383 --> 01:54:50,883
Veronica.

3070
01:54:53,982 --> 01:54:55,482
I always loved you.

3071
01:54:56,582 --> 01:54:58,148
Whatever happened,

3072
01:54:59,715 --> 01:55:00,615
I wanted you to know that.

3073
01:55:01,781 --> 01:55:02,715
UInexpectedly, tears

3074
01:55:02,715 --> 01:55:04,414
form in Veronica's eyes.

3075
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:06,781
These ain't no acting tears.

3076
01:55:07,614 --> 01:55:10,147
Veronica appears moved,

3077
01:55:10,847 --> 01:55:12,280
moved by Cliffs words.

3078
01:55:13,180 --> 01:55:15,612
The man she's about to have killed.

3079
01:55:17,179 --> 01:55:17,978
Veronica.

3080
01:55:18,079 --> 01:55:20,679
Jimmy, Jimmy you startled me.

3081
01:55:24,577 --> 01:55:25,912
You having second thoughts?

3082
01:55:26,112 --> 01:55:27,011
What?

3083
01:55:27,545 --> 01:55:30,878
No, no Jimmy, it's

3084
01:55:30,878 --> 01:55:32,477
me and you from now on.

3085
01:55:32,477 --> 01:55:33,977
Our future begins tonight.

3086
01:55:35,277 --> 01:55:36,577
When can we leave for Hollywood?

3087
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:38,743
A week, maybe two.

3088
01:55:39,543 --> 01:55:40,143
I just don't want it

3089
01:55:40,143 --> 01:55:41,210
to look as though I'm

3090
01:55:41,210 --> 01:55:41,843
fleeing.

3091
01:55:43,675 --> 01:55:46,242
God, I love you Veronica Smart.

3092
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:01,474
So you get here at eight o'clock.

3093
01:56:02,139 --> 01:56:03,040
Cliff would have just

3094
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:03,807
come home from work,

3095
01:56:03,807 --> 01:56:04,940
you'll catch him off guard.

3096
01:56:05,373 --> 01:56:07,106
I have an alibi in place.

3097
01:56:08,239 --> 01:56:12,505
There is nothing that can stand in our way

3098
01:56:19,404 --> 01:56:20,338
Jimmy.

3099
01:56:20,338 --> 01:56:23,271
Hey, Sal Salazar's fighting tonight.

3100
01:56:23,871 --> 01:56:26,037
Why don't you and I have a night in.

3101
01:56:26,637 --> 01:56:29,370
Watch the fight, have a couple of beers.

3102
01:56:30,236 --> 01:56:30,936
I can't dad,

3103
01:56:30,936 --> 01:56:31,969
I've got something I need to do.

3104
01:56:33,103 --> 01:56:34,436
I'm trying here Jimmy.

3105
01:56:36,335 --> 01:56:39,102
You have no idea how it feels to be

3106
01:56:39,102 --> 01:56:41,302
invisible, do you, mother?

3107
01:56:44,201 --> 01:56:44,901
You know, I sit

3108
01:56:46,001 --> 01:56:47,034
and watch the movies

3109
01:56:47,034 --> 01:56:50,500
and see these beautiful women,

3110
01:56:51,700 --> 01:56:52,700
so full of life,

3111
01:56:52,700 --> 01:56:54,700
their eyes sparkle like diamonds,

3112
01:56:57,032 --> 01:56:59,366
and they seem happy.

3113
01:57:01,665 --> 01:57:03,764
Really happy,

3114
01:57:06,032 --> 01:57:07,465
and then

3115
01:57:07,865 --> 01:57:09,364
I look in the mirror and I see,

3116
01:57:13,064 --> 01:57:13,431
me.

3117
01:57:15,864 --> 01:57:16,496
Dad.

3118
01:57:18,563 --> 01:57:19,963
That woman you said you loved,

3119
01:57:24,196 --> 01:57:24,662
Patricia?

3120
01:57:27,662 --> 01:57:28,895
What about her?

3121
01:57:28,895 --> 01:57:30,862
Why didn't you fight for her?

3122
01:57:32,695 --> 01:57:33,895
How do you know I didn't?

3123
01:57:34,161 --> 01:57:36,061
Well, did you?

3124
01:57:37,161 --> 01:57:38,627
How could I Jimmy.

3125
01:57:39,027 --> 01:57:40,427
She made a choice

3126
01:57:41,027 --> 01:57:41,860
as soon as she let

3127
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:43,360
that other guy into her bed,

3128
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:46,460
it was all over.

3129
01:57:47,793 --> 01:57:48,559
Those women on the screen

3130
01:57:48,559 --> 01:57:50,259
aren't like that in real life.

3131
01:57:50,259 --> 01:57:52,425
They have the best makeup

3132
01:57:52,425 --> 01:57:53,592
people and the best gowns.

3133
01:57:53,692 --> 01:57:54,825
And I want that.

3134
01:57:55,992 --> 01:57:57,025
I hate my life.

3135
01:57:57,091 --> 01:57:58,625
I just want to be beautiful,

3136
01:57:58,625 --> 01:58:00,258
why is that so wrong?

3137
01:58:00,258 --> 01:58:01,523
Oh, Vivian you are beautiful.

3138
01:58:01,523 --> 01:58:02,991
Stop it, mother.

3139
01:58:05,690 --> 01:58:08,323
Veronica is making me beautiful.

3140
01:58:09,990 --> 01:58:10,690
Look at me.

3141
01:58:12,623 --> 01:58:13,156
Maybe.

3142
01:58:16,089 --> 01:58:17,121
Maybe she made a mistake,

3143
01:58:18,955 --> 01:58:20,755
got married for the wrong reasons,

3144
01:58:20,755 --> 01:58:21,888
maybe she was waiting for you

3145
01:58:21,888 --> 01:58:22,788
to come and save her.

3146
01:58:24,987 --> 01:58:25,388
Jimmy?

3147
01:58:26,554 --> 01:58:27,621
What is this all about?

3148
01:58:28,087 --> 01:58:29,054
You listen to me.

3149
01:58:31,387 --> 01:58:33,187
You are 15 years old.

3150
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:35,719
You haven't even fully

3151
01:58:35,719 --> 01:58:37,153
blossomed as a woman yet.

3152
01:58:38,818 --> 01:58:39,686
But I see you,

3153
01:58:41,286 --> 01:58:42,419
I see you are beautiful

3154
01:58:43,318 --> 01:58:44,585
and you don't need to hide behind

3155
01:58:44,585 --> 01:58:45,785
this paint to show that.

3156
01:58:47,318 --> 01:58:49,285
Nothing that I got to go, Jimmy.

3157
01:58:51,818 --> 01:58:52,884
Should I be worried about you?

3158
01:58:54,384 --> 01:58:54,850
What do you mean?

3159
01:58:55,916 --> 01:58:56,317
Well,

3160
01:58:57,483 --> 01:59:01,416
this woman, are you serious about her?

3161
01:59:01,416 --> 01:59:02,583
I've never been more serious

3162
01:59:02,583 --> 01:59:03,683
about anything in my life.

3163
01:59:04,716 --> 01:59:05,982
You have to find your own way,

3164
01:59:05,982 --> 01:59:07,582
you can't just become somebody else.

3165
01:59:07,615 --> 01:59:08,382
That's not true.

3166
01:59:09,682 --> 01:59:11,514
Veronica said that many movie

3167
01:59:11,514 --> 01:59:12,915
stars come from lives like mine.

3168
01:59:12,915 --> 01:59:14,614
They get to change their name and

3169
01:59:14,614 --> 01:59:15,814
they're weight and their hair.

3170
01:59:15,814 --> 01:59:17,847
You know how many girls feel like you?

3171
01:59:19,147 --> 01:59:20,514
All wanting the same thing.

3172
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:22,213
So should I be worried?

3173
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:23,713
Worried.

3174
01:59:26,213 --> 01:59:27,279
About love?

3175
01:59:29,213 --> 01:59:32,245
No dad you don't need to be worried.

3176
01:59:34,478 --> 01:59:35,612
I know that she's the one.

3177
01:59:36,645 --> 01:59:37,210
Veronica...

3178
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:38,911
Ahh, Veronica!

3179
01:59:39,544 --> 01:59:41,077
I don't want to be your enemy

3180
01:59:41,378 --> 01:59:42,877
and I want you to succeed.

3181
01:59:44,077 --> 01:59:45,144
But we have few options

3182
01:59:45,144 --> 01:59:46,309
in life as women, Vivian,

3183
01:59:46,910 --> 01:59:47,943
so we have to work harder,

3184
01:59:47,943 --> 01:59:48,877
and that's all I want

3185
01:59:48,877 --> 01:59:50,309
you to do is work harder.

3186
01:59:51,776 --> 01:59:53,943
You know, that is the first time

3187
01:59:53,943 --> 01:59:56,009
you have told me her name.

3188
01:59:56,009 --> 01:59:56,342
Yeah.

3189
01:59:58,075 --> 01:59:59,808
Veronica, Veronica.

3190
02:00:01,808 --> 02:00:03,241
I don't think I know her.

3191
02:00:03,241 --> 02:00:06,441
Well, apart from your teacher.

3192
02:00:13,007 --> 02:00:15,906
Well, I am working harder mother,

3193
02:00:17,673 --> 02:00:18,406
but this time

3194
02:00:19,506 --> 02:00:20,172
it's for me.

3195
02:00:21,372 --> 02:00:21,972
Not you.

3196
02:00:22,672 --> 02:00:24,172
Oh, Vivian.

3197
02:00:24,172 --> 02:00:24,905
Mother I have to go.

3198
02:00:25,605 --> 02:00:27,471
Please tell me you're not involved

3199
02:00:27,471 --> 02:00:28,571
with your teacher.

3200
02:00:28,871 --> 02:00:29,871
I have to go and find Riff,

3201
02:00:29,871 --> 02:00:30,971
and if I can't find him

3202
02:00:30,971 --> 02:00:31,804
I have to find Veronica and stop...

3203
02:00:31,804 --> 02:00:32,304
Stop what?

3204
02:00:32,337 --> 02:00:33,904
What are you talking about?

3205
02:00:33,971 --> 02:00:36,337
I got to go, I won't be late.

3206
02:00:36,504 --> 02:00:36,770
Jimmy please.

3207
02:00:36,770 --> 02:00:37,803
Jimmy stop.

3208
02:00:37,803 --> 02:00:39,037
Jimmy!

3209
02:00:50,335 --> 02:00:52,168
Riff, Riff?

3210
02:00:52,168 --> 02:00:53,435
Is that you?

3211
02:00:56,301 --> 02:00:57,501
So have you got the gun?

3212
02:00:57,534 --> 02:00:59,034
I'm sorry Jimmy I ain't got it.

3213
02:00:59,334 --> 02:01:00,234
The guy never gave it me back.

3214
02:01:00,234 --> 02:01:01,134
And he's vanished.

3215
02:01:01,267 --> 02:01:02,767
Damn it Riff. I need that.

3216
02:01:02,867 --> 02:01:04,633
You don't have to go through with this.

3217
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:06,400
You really don't have it?

3218
02:01:06,766 --> 02:01:07,233
Sorry.

3219
02:01:07,533 --> 02:01:09,633
Oh, well, that's perfect Riff.

3220
02:01:11,732 --> 02:01:13,232
To hell with it, I still got my bat.

3221
02:01:13,465 --> 02:01:14,732
Don't do this.

3222
02:01:14,732 --> 02:01:15,932
You'll ruin your life.

3223
02:01:16,198 --> 02:01:17,065
If I don't do something,

3224
02:01:17,065 --> 02:01:18,431
and he hurts my baby

3225
02:01:19,131 --> 02:01:20,631
how am I supposed to live with that?

3226
02:01:20,898 --> 02:01:21,998
You think your some kind of mobster

3227
02:01:21,998 --> 02:01:23,131
now cause you are gonna kill a guy?

3228
02:01:23,131 --> 02:01:24,164
Oh Riff, go home

3229
02:01:24,164 --> 02:01:24,897
if you don't want to help,

3230
02:01:24,897 --> 02:01:25,897
you ain't got to be here.

3231
02:01:26,197 --> 02:01:27,030
Jimmy.

3232
02:01:27,397 --> 02:01:28,197
Jimmy, look at me.

3233
02:01:28,697 --> 02:01:29,730
all the things you could

3234
02:01:29,730 --> 02:01:30,363
do with your life.

3235
02:01:30,363 --> 02:01:32,763
I don't need anything else

3236
02:01:32,763 --> 02:01:34,263
just her and my kid.

3237
02:01:34,263 --> 02:01:34,696
You're a kid yourself.

3238
02:01:34,696 --> 02:01:36,062
Jimmy, how are you going to raise a kid?

3239
02:01:36,329 --> 02:01:37,096
Riff, go home,

3240
02:01:38,295 --> 02:01:38,995
please.

3241
02:01:39,329 --> 02:01:40,962
Once you're marked by the devil Jimmy,

3242
02:01:40,962 --> 02:01:42,028
you can't come back from that.

3243
02:01:42,295 --> 02:01:43,595
Believe me, I know.

3244
02:01:43,595 --> 02:01:44,628
Some things are worth it.

3245
02:01:45,061 --> 02:01:46,328
I'll call the police, Jimmy.

3246
02:01:46,328 --> 02:01:47,727
No, you won't Riff, that ain't you.

3247
02:01:47,761 --> 02:01:49,327
Jimmy, please just listen to me.

3248
02:01:49,327 --> 02:01:50,960
I really needed that gun.

3249
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:51,860
Call it off.

3250
02:01:51,860 --> 02:01:52,327
No way.

3251
02:01:56,760 --> 02:01:57,426
It just means that

3252
02:01:57,426 --> 02:01:58,959
I have to do this myself.

3253
02:02:00,459 --> 02:02:01,592
Like a man.

3254
02:02:01,592 --> 02:02:02,359
Jimmy please.

3255
02:02:02,359 --> 02:02:03,559
It's going to be fine Riff.

3256
02:02:04,858 --> 02:02:05,425
Trust me.

3257
02:02:06,758 --> 02:02:08,491
In a few hours,

3258
02:02:09,858 --> 02:02:10,758
all this is over.

3259
02:02:14,191 --> 02:02:15,724
Dammit Jimmy.

3260
02:02:17,124 --> 02:02:18,457
I'm sorry.

3261
02:02:20,723 --> 02:02:21,590
A plan.

3262
02:02:21,590 --> 02:02:24,023
A man ain't a man without a plan.

3263
02:02:24,922 --> 02:02:26,089
It's February 13th,

3264
02:02:26,689 --> 02:02:28,922
just after 7.30 that same evening,

3265
02:02:29,922 --> 02:02:32,188
silence washes over the neighborhood.

3266
02:02:32,188 --> 02:02:35,188
A figure seen at the back of the house

3267
02:02:35,321 --> 02:02:36,554
heads towards the back door.

3268
02:02:37,487 --> 02:02:38,621
The figure stands in front

3269
02:02:38,621 --> 02:02:39,454
of it for a moment

3270
02:02:40,054 --> 02:02:41,454
and then knocks on the door.

3271
02:02:42,553 --> 02:02:44,353
As the door opens, however.

3272
02:02:45,153 --> 02:02:48,086
Well, it's not Cliff, It's Veronica,

3273
02:02:49,053 --> 02:02:50,319
and it's not Jimmy stood

3274
02:02:50,319 --> 02:02:53,752
there, it's Riff.

3275
02:02:54,952 --> 02:02:55,718
Riff, what are you doing here?

3276
02:02:56,352 --> 02:02:57,085
You're early.

3277
02:02:57,118 --> 02:02:58,285
I have to leave first,

3278
02:02:58,285 --> 02:03:00,784
and then you come back when Cliff's home.

3279
02:03:00,784 --> 02:03:01,284
Jesus, I thought

3280
02:03:01,318 --> 02:03:02,851
Jimmy went through the plan with you.

3281
02:03:03,717 --> 02:03:04,117
Mrs Smart.

3282
02:03:04,517 --> 02:03:06,217
Where is Jimmy is he not with you.

3283
02:03:07,717 --> 02:03:08,717
Is that the gun?

3284
02:03:09,583 --> 02:03:10,750
I thought you gave that to Jimmy.

3285
02:03:11,583 --> 02:03:12,649
In fact, I thought you said

3286
02:03:12,649 --> 02:03:13,883
you didn't want any part of this.

3287
02:03:13,883 --> 02:03:15,082
Mrs Smart.

3288
02:03:15,082 --> 02:03:16,249
Now run along Riff,

3289
02:03:16,249 --> 02:03:17,349
I need to get out of here,

3290
02:03:17,349 --> 02:03:18,715
go and meet Vivian.

3291
02:03:20,548 --> 02:03:21,282
Riff?

3292
02:03:22,715 --> 02:03:24,381
Riff, what are you doing?

3293
02:03:24,781 --> 02:03:25,214
Aaahh!

3294
02:03:25,914 --> 02:03:26,948
Yes, Riff.

3295
02:03:27,181 --> 02:03:28,614
What are you doing?

3296
02:03:29,014 --> 02:03:30,380
Let's go back to the moment

3297
02:03:30,414 --> 02:03:32,713
Riff and Cliff came face to face.

3298
02:03:32,713 --> 02:03:34,947
It was like a showdown in the Wild West,

3299
02:03:34,947 --> 02:03:36,980
but who would flinch first?

3300
02:03:38,346 --> 02:03:40,612
We still have unfinished business kid.

3301
02:03:41,079 --> 02:03:41,912
Mr. Smart.

3302
02:03:52,911 --> 02:03:54,444
Did you really think

3303
02:03:54,444 --> 02:03:55,044
I was going to let

3304
02:03:55,044 --> 02:03:56,177
you get away with that kid?

3305
02:03:56,177 --> 02:03:57,777
Please Mr Smart, I'm sorry.

3306
02:03:57,777 --> 02:03:58,810
You think you can jump

3307
02:03:58,810 --> 02:03:59,677
me, you little punk?

3308
02:03:59,843 --> 02:04:00,843
It was a mistake, please.

3309
02:04:00,876 --> 02:04:04,343
I didn't know you were Veronicas husband.

3310
02:04:04,343 --> 02:04:05,409
You made a joke out of me

3311
02:04:05,409 --> 02:04:06,242
for the last time.

3312
02:04:06,709 --> 02:04:08,909
You're nothing, street trash.

3313
02:04:09,209 --> 02:04:10,508
I should do the world a favour

3314
02:04:10,508 --> 02:04:11,742
and put you out of your misery.

3315
02:04:11,875 --> 02:04:13,175
Please don't do this.

3316
02:04:13,175 --> 02:04:15,274
I'm a good kid, I didn't mean to hurt you.

3317
02:04:15,574 --> 02:04:16,841
You ain't a good kid Riff.

3318
02:04:16,841 --> 02:04:18,174
Please, please, please.

3319
02:04:18,174 --> 02:04:19,741
Oh God, oh God, oh God!

3320
02:04:19,741 --> 02:04:20,974
So tell me Riff,

3321
02:04:20,974 --> 02:04:22,840
are you sleeping with my wife?

3322
02:04:23,740 --> 02:04:24,573
No, no.

3323
02:04:24,607 --> 02:04:25,640
Why would you think that?

3324
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:28,206
I think you are.

3325
02:04:28,206 --> 02:04:30,339
Now, Is it just you

3326
02:04:30,672 --> 02:04:31,772
or is it Jimmy as well?

3327
02:04:31,806 --> 02:04:33,005
You got it all wrong.

3328
02:04:34,805 --> 02:04:36,238
Ahhh, it's Jimmy.

3329
02:04:37,505 --> 02:04:38,471
Jimmy's stepping out with your wife,

3330
02:04:38,471 --> 02:04:39,638
not me, I swear.

3331
02:04:39,971 --> 02:04:41,638
Give me a Bible and i'll swear on it.

3332
02:04:43,804 --> 02:04:44,904
Jimmy, that son of a bitch!

3333
02:04:45,304 --> 02:04:47,704
Please just let me go.

3334
02:04:47,704 --> 02:04:48,670
I ain't going to cause you

3335
02:04:48,670 --> 02:04:49,437
any more problems.

3336
02:04:49,437 --> 02:04:51,236
You give me one damn reason I should.

3337
02:04:51,403 --> 02:04:53,536
Because I'm just 16.

3338
02:04:53,536 --> 02:04:55,402
I ain't moved.

3339
02:04:57,536 --> 02:04:59,735
Your wife has hired Jimmy to murder you.

3340
02:05:01,368 --> 02:05:02,868
You're lying.

3341
02:05:02,868 --> 02:05:04,235
No, I ain't, he is supposed

3342
02:05:04,235 --> 02:05:05,135
to do it this week?

3343
02:05:05,501 --> 02:05:07,401
She wants your money and Jimmy,

3344
02:05:07,401 --> 02:05:07,901
I swear to you,

3345
02:05:08,101 --> 02:05:09,134
I ain't stupid enough to be lying

3346
02:05:09,134 --> 02:05:10,300
to you right now.

3347
02:05:10,300 --> 02:05:11,900
No, no, she's having my baby.

3348
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:14,700
She said the same thing to Jimmy.

3349
02:05:21,332 --> 02:05:24,865
Veronica, you've made a joke out of me

3350
02:05:24,865 --> 02:05:26,265
for the last time.

3351
02:05:26,265 --> 02:05:29,431
Oh God, what have I done?

3352
02:05:29,431 --> 02:05:31,964
You just saved your own life kid.

3353
02:05:31,964 --> 02:05:32,498
Now

3354
02:05:33,497 --> 02:05:34,564
you're working for me.

3355
02:05:35,264 --> 02:05:36,030
Do you understand?

3356
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:39,863
Everything I tell you to do you do it

3357
02:05:40,297 --> 02:05:42,963
or I will kill you kid, you and Jimmy.

3358
02:05:43,696 --> 02:05:44,729
Do you understand me?

3359
02:05:44,763 --> 02:05:45,396
Yeah, I.

3360
02:05:46,196 --> 02:05:47,196
Yes, sir.

3361
02:05:51,795 --> 02:05:55,594
So, she wants to be dead.

3362
02:05:58,861 --> 02:06:01,327
Aaah. Riff!

3363
02:06:01,327 --> 02:06:04,327
Riff, look at me, we're friends,

3364
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:05,460
why would you do this?

3365
02:06:06,093 --> 02:06:08,193
Cliff knows Mrs Smart,

3366
02:06:08,193 --> 02:06:09,793
he knows all about your plan.

3367
02:06:10,093 --> 02:06:11,692
How, how does he know?

3368
02:06:12,259 --> 02:06:12,692
I had to tell him

3369
02:06:12,726 --> 02:06:13,625
he was going to kill me.

3370
02:06:14,025 --> 02:06:14,992
Why, oh God.

3371
02:06:14,992 --> 02:06:15,825
What have you done.

3372
02:06:16,925 --> 02:06:18,425
I've got to do this Mrs Smart.

3373
02:06:18,425 --> 02:06:20,591
No, no, Riff, don't you see?

3374
02:06:20,891 --> 02:06:22,624
He's trying to set you up for my murder.

3375
02:06:22,891 --> 02:06:24,357
He is going to kill me.

3376
02:06:24,791 --> 02:06:25,990
Do you hear me, he's

3377
02:06:25,990 --> 02:06:27,424
going to put a bullet in my head

3378
02:06:27,524 --> 02:06:30,323
and not just mine, Jimmys as well.

3379
02:06:30,323 --> 02:06:32,823
This way, this way, he said,

3380
02:06:32,823 --> 02:06:33,856
he is going to leave us alone.

3381
02:06:34,956 --> 02:06:37,756
There's got to be a way out of this Riff.

3382
02:06:37,756 --> 02:06:40,189
I'm so sorry.

3383
02:06:40,189 --> 02:06:42,088
I guess this was my path.

3384
02:06:42,088 --> 02:06:43,421
You could flee.

3385
02:06:43,421 --> 02:06:45,554
You could just pretend

3386
02:06:45,554 --> 02:06:46,388
that you killed me.

3387
02:06:46,721 --> 02:06:47,754
What about Jimmy?

3388
02:06:48,087 --> 02:06:48,987
What about him?

3389
02:06:49,454 --> 02:06:49,854
He loves you.

3390
02:06:49,854 --> 02:06:51,087
You would just leave him?

3391
02:06:53,387 --> 02:06:54,420
He's a sweet kid.

3392
02:06:55,120 --> 02:06:55,753
He's young.

3393
02:06:55,753 --> 02:06:57,586
I don't want him on the run,

3394
02:06:57,586 --> 02:06:58,453
he's got the rest of

3395
02:06:58,453 --> 02:06:59,486
his life ahead of him.

3396
02:07:00,686 --> 02:07:04,785
Oh God, Mr Smart was right.

3397
02:07:04,785 --> 02:07:06,452
He said that you didn't love Jimmy

3398
02:07:06,818 --> 02:07:07,385
because you couldn't

3399
02:07:07,385 --> 02:07:08,551
love anybody but yourself.

3400
02:07:08,885 --> 02:07:09,818
And you needed us to play

3401
02:07:09,818 --> 02:07:11,018
a part in your husband's murder?

3402
02:07:11,251 --> 02:07:12,318
Riff, no!

3403
02:07:13,117 --> 02:07:14,817
I wish he'd never met you.

3404
02:07:15,151 --> 02:07:16,417
I wish none of us had.

3405
02:07:16,884 --> 02:07:18,650
You ruined everything.

3406
02:07:18,950 --> 02:07:19,850
Don't you see that he's

3407
02:07:19,850 --> 02:07:21,550
poisoning your mind against me?

3408
02:07:21,816 --> 02:07:22,183
You know,

3409
02:07:23,516 --> 02:07:25,116
the moment my parents died, I knew,

3410
02:07:26,016 --> 02:07:28,115
I knew that my life would mean nothing,

3411
02:07:28,115 --> 02:07:29,749
that I would mean nothing.

3412
02:07:32,382 --> 02:07:33,448
Something like this was

3413
02:07:33,448 --> 02:07:34,348
inevitable, I guess.

3414
02:07:34,915 --> 02:07:36,548
No Riff, no!

3415
02:07:36,548 --> 02:07:38,447
Goodbye Mrs Smart,

3416
02:07:38,447 --> 02:07:40,614
and may God forgive me.

3417
02:07:41,580 --> 02:07:42,280
Nooooo! Oh,

3418
02:08:07,877 --> 02:08:08,943
(Riff Sobbing)

3419
02:08:18,275 --> 02:08:18,842
It's OK.

3420
02:08:22,308 --> 02:08:23,142
It's OK.

3421
02:08:25,108 --> 02:08:27,508
The hard part's done.

3422
02:08:30,974 --> 02:08:34,607
Cliff, help.

3423
02:08:35,307 --> 02:08:37,806
Help me.

3424
02:08:38,839 --> 02:08:40,872
And why would I do that, sweetheart?

3425
02:08:43,405 --> 02:08:46,205
After you tried to have me killed.

3426
02:08:48,805 --> 02:08:50,471
I'm sorry.

3427
02:08:51,904 --> 02:08:55,071
Oh, I know just how sorry you are.

3428
02:08:56,537 --> 02:09:01,503
My God, all I ever asked from you

3429
02:09:01,670 --> 02:09:03,703
was for you to love me,

3430
02:09:04,469 --> 02:09:05,869
and to give me a child,

3431
02:09:06,036 --> 02:09:08,036
you couldn't even achieve that.

3432
02:09:12,435 --> 02:09:18,867
Have you ever, really loved me Veronica?

3433
02:09:21,767 --> 02:09:24,233
I love you.

3434
02:09:24,467 --> 02:09:27,400
No, no, no, you don't.

3435
02:09:28,766 --> 02:09:30,566
Those are just the desperate words

3436
02:09:30,666 --> 02:09:31,899
of a dying woman.

3437
02:09:36,332 --> 02:09:40,165
I never loved Jimmy.

3438
02:09:41,198 --> 02:09:42,731
I love you.

3439
02:09:44,864 --> 02:09:49,563
No, because you lie as often

3440
02:09:49,563 --> 02:09:51,030
as you breathe baby.

3441
02:10:02,728 --> 02:10:05,061
You get out, you get out of town.

3442
02:10:05,061 --> 02:10:06,428
I don't ever want to see you

3443
02:10:06,428 --> 02:10:07,261
around here again.

3444
02:10:09,894 --> 02:10:12,560
Oh, and Riff.

3445
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:14,960
Leave the gun here,

3446
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:18,959
I'll get rid of it,

3447
02:10:20,126 --> 02:10:21,759
I ain't leaving anything to chance.

3448
02:10:25,159 --> 02:10:27,225
Now, get out of here!

3449
02:10:38,857 --> 02:10:39,623
Police.

3450
02:10:44,456 --> 02:10:47,389
Oh God, please.

3451
02:10:48,322 --> 02:10:50,322
There was just some crazy kid here.

3452
02:10:51,688 --> 02:10:53,188
He shot my wife,

3453
02:10:53,188 --> 02:10:55,088
and then he shot me as well.

3454
02:10:55,888 --> 02:10:56,921
Please!

3455
02:11:20,585 --> 02:11:21,184
Oh, God.

3456
02:11:22,684 --> 02:11:24,084
Oh, God, Veronica.

3457
02:11:26,684 --> 02:11:28,384
Who did this to you was it him?

3458
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:29,417
JImmy?

3459
02:11:29,417 --> 02:11:31,683
Is that you?

3460
02:11:31,683 --> 02:11:32,716
Go....

3461
02:11:32,716 --> 02:11:34,983
I ain't going anywhere.

3462
02:11:34,983 --> 02:11:37,482
I won't let anybody hurt you?

3463
02:11:37,482 --> 02:11:40,349
Take care of you, hold on Veronica.

3464
02:11:40,715 --> 02:11:43,682
No, no, wake up Veronica, wake up?

3465
02:11:45,248 --> 02:11:47,048
You can't.

3466
02:11:47,581 --> 02:11:48,614
You can't die.

3467
02:11:48,614 --> 02:11:50,047
You can't leave me.

3468
02:11:58,413 --> 02:12:00,113
Oh God!

3469
02:12:12,544 --> 02:12:13,378
You see, Jimmy.

3470
02:12:16,177 --> 02:12:17,244
I always win.

3471
02:12:19,710 --> 02:12:23,276
I always have and I always will.

3472
02:12:25,609 --> 02:12:26,209
You killed her.

3473
02:12:27,642 --> 02:12:30,409
You son of a bitch, you killed her!

3474
02:12:30,875 --> 02:12:32,808
No you killed her Jimmy.

3475
02:12:38,474 --> 02:12:40,074
If you want to be a man

3476
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:43,873
you've got to be able

3477
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:47,540
to take a shot and not miss,

3478
02:12:50,506 --> 02:12:54,172
and you missed Jimmy,

3479
02:12:55,039 --> 02:12:57,938
it's never wise to miss.

3480
02:12:58,572 --> 02:13:00,371
Give my love to Veronica.

3481
02:13:01,005 --> 02:13:01,738
Wait!

3482
02:13:24,668 --> 02:13:25,635
Oh God!

3483
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:34,567
Oh my God.

3484
02:13:34,933 --> 02:13:36,833
I thought I told you to go.

3485
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:39,033
No, no!

3486
02:13:39,266 --> 02:13:40,699
You know what your problem is Riff?

3487
02:13:40,699 --> 02:13:41,832
You care too much.

3488
02:13:42,766 --> 02:13:44,332
Why would you do that?

3489
02:13:44,332 --> 02:13:45,132
You promised.

3490
02:13:46,898 --> 02:13:50,365
Nobody outwits Cliff Smart.

3491
02:13:50,865 --> 02:13:53,764
Now, I um, I tell the police

3492
02:13:53,764 --> 02:13:56,131
that you and Jimmy just just burst in

3493
02:13:56,697 --> 02:13:57,897
and he was screaming

3494
02:13:57,897 --> 02:13:59,930
at her to leave with him, but no,

3495
02:13:59,930 --> 02:14:01,563
she wanted to stay with me

3496
02:14:02,196 --> 02:14:03,696
because she still loves me.

3497
02:14:04,729 --> 02:14:07,829
But he wouldn't have any of that,

3498
02:14:07,829 --> 02:14:08,762
so he shot her,

3499
02:14:09,795 --> 02:14:11,229
but then I shot him,

3500
02:14:11,229 --> 02:14:12,762
in self defence of course.

3501
02:14:13,595 --> 02:14:15,095
Jimmy, Jimmy come on.

3502
02:14:15,695 --> 02:14:19,627
It's too late for him, but you can run.

3503
02:14:20,894 --> 02:14:21,960
I'm letting you run.

3504
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:23,327
You murdered him.

3505
02:14:23,794 --> 02:14:26,826
He would do anything for her, anything.

3506
02:14:27,793 --> 02:14:28,760
I'm telling the police.

3507
02:14:28,926 --> 02:14:30,059
You're trying to set him up.

3508
02:14:30,926 --> 02:14:32,126
And implicate yourself.

3509
02:14:33,426 --> 02:14:35,192
You ain't stupid enough for that kid.

3510
02:14:35,525 --> 02:14:36,592
I should kill you, right now?

3511
02:14:39,158 --> 02:14:41,158
I don't think your aims that good kid.

3512
02:14:41,591 --> 02:14:43,191
To hell with you Cliff Smart!

3513
02:14:46,457 --> 02:14:47,924
That boy attacked my wife!

3514
02:14:48,724 --> 02:14:50,290
Stop or I'll shoot!

3515
02:15:12,654 --> 02:15:14,154
As I walked around the crime scene,

3516
02:15:14,154 --> 02:15:15,520
I saw Veronica's body

3517
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:17,586
laid on the floor next to Jimmys.

3518
02:15:17,586 --> 02:15:19,719
A table next to the chair, had an ashtray

3519
02:15:19,719 --> 02:15:21,453
on and a half smoked cigarette.

3520
02:15:22,052 --> 02:15:23,986
Veronica had been caught by surprise,

3521
02:15:24,852 --> 02:15:26,285
Jimmy's body laid next to her

3522
02:15:26,285 --> 02:15:27,918
with his eyes wide open with fear.

3523
02:15:29,418 --> 02:15:31,218
I feel like I died alongside her.

3524
02:15:32,951 --> 02:15:33,951
Does that sound normal?

3525
02:15:34,751 --> 02:15:36,084
I notice that Cliff didn't have

3526
02:15:36,084 --> 02:15:37,384
a single tear in his eye.

3527
02:15:38,350 --> 02:15:39,583
I feel empty.

3528
02:15:40,750 --> 02:15:42,316
I've seen the pain etched in the faces

3529
02:15:42,316 --> 02:15:43,450
of those left behind,

3530
02:15:43,450 --> 02:15:44,649
as reality dawns on them

3531
02:15:44,649 --> 02:15:45,283
that death has changed

3532
02:15:45,283 --> 02:15:45,983
everything for them.

3533
02:15:46,949 --> 02:15:48,516
This should have been

3534
02:15:48,516 --> 02:15:49,715
another routine visit,

3535
02:15:49,715 --> 02:15:51,349
but something about it felt off.

3536
02:15:51,948 --> 02:15:54,515
And it all came down to Cliff Smart.

3537
02:15:54,515 --> 02:15:56,381
Now, Mr. Smart,

3538
02:15:57,514 --> 02:15:59,248
can you tell me if you have any idea

3539
02:15:59,248 --> 02:16:01,247
why these two young men would want

3540
02:16:01,247 --> 02:16:02,880
you and your wife killed?

3541
02:16:05,147 --> 02:16:06,147
Yeah, but

3542
02:16:07,980 --> 02:16:09,213
I don't want to tarnish

3543
02:16:09,213 --> 02:16:10,679
the memory of my wife now.

3544
02:16:10,846 --> 02:16:11,646
She's...

3545
02:16:12,179 --> 02:16:12,712
Dead?

3546
02:16:12,879 --> 02:16:13,446
Yeah.

3547
02:16:16,279 --> 02:16:16,645
I mean,

3548
02:16:18,712 --> 02:16:19,312
well, you see,

3549
02:16:21,145 --> 02:16:23,078
she's been spending a lot of time

3550
02:16:23,078 --> 02:16:25,177
with the kid, Jimmy.

3551
02:16:26,744 --> 02:16:28,277
I think he'd fallen in love with her.

3552
02:16:29,677 --> 02:16:31,943
I'd, um, suspected for a while.

3553
02:16:31,943 --> 02:16:34,442
She used to teach him see,

3554
02:16:34,442 --> 02:16:36,609
she gave him private acting lessons.

3555
02:16:36,609 --> 02:16:38,208
And every time I saw him, like

3556
02:16:39,309 --> 02:16:41,242
I saw the way he looked at her,

3557
02:16:41,242 --> 02:16:42,842
I mean, I hate to say it, but

3558
02:16:44,142 --> 02:16:45,940
at times my um, my wife didn't

3559
02:16:47,141 --> 02:16:49,274
dissuade his flirtations.

3560
02:16:52,007 --> 02:16:54,707
Were the two, intimate?

3561
02:16:56,307 --> 02:16:57,172
Yeah. Yeah,

3562
02:16:59,106 --> 02:16:59,773
I think so.

3563
02:17:01,839 --> 02:17:02,606
I think he thought

3564
02:17:02,606 --> 02:17:03,939
they'd be together in the future.

3565
02:17:04,805 --> 02:17:05,472
You know,

3566
02:17:06,505 --> 02:17:07,738
there was something real strange

3567
02:17:07,738 --> 02:17:09,072
about this kid Detective.

3568
02:17:10,904 --> 02:17:12,838
He had something real dark in his eyes.

3569
02:17:13,738 --> 02:17:16,103
He was clearly, very troubled.

3570
02:17:16,271 --> 02:17:18,136
Did he say anything

3571
02:17:18,136 --> 02:17:19,237
when they turned up tonight?

3572
02:17:19,869 --> 02:17:23,036
He just stormed in in a rage

3573
02:17:23,036 --> 02:17:24,602
and just kept screaming

3574
02:17:24,602 --> 02:17:25,969
that Veronica had to go with him.

3575
02:17:25,969 --> 02:17:28,568
But Veronica just kept saying

3576
02:17:28,568 --> 02:17:30,702
that he was just a little boy and that

3577
02:17:32,101 --> 02:17:33,035
she was married

3578
02:17:34,168 --> 02:17:35,235
and she loved me,

3579
02:17:37,201 --> 02:17:38,268
but he wouldn't accept it.

3580
02:17:39,434 --> 02:17:41,701
He just kept screaming his love for her.

3581
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:43,867
Eventually he said,

3582
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:47,332
if I can't have her, then nobody can.

3583
02:17:48,266 --> 02:17:48,900
Oh, God.

3584
02:17:51,766 --> 02:17:52,366
Then he shot her.

3585
02:17:53,966 --> 02:17:55,132
I mean, I tried to shield it,

3586
02:17:55,132 --> 02:17:57,764
but he shot me as well.

3587
02:17:58,932 --> 02:18:03,498
Lucky for me I managed to fall

3588
02:18:03,498 --> 02:18:05,131
near the drawer where I keep my gun.

3589
02:18:05,164 --> 02:18:07,263
So I just about managed

3590
02:18:07,564 --> 02:18:08,897
to let off one shot.

3591
02:18:08,964 --> 02:18:10,230
Straight through the heart.

3592
02:18:10,363 --> 02:18:11,029
I just shot.

3593
02:18:11,029 --> 02:18:11,830
I didn't aim.

3594
02:18:14,929 --> 02:18:16,696
I just wish I could have saved her.

3595
02:18:17,862 --> 02:18:21,462
Still no tears, an actor Cliff was not.

3596
02:18:22,928 --> 02:18:23,962
What about the other boy?

3597
02:18:26,195 --> 02:18:26,695
Oh, yeah.

3598
02:18:28,493 --> 02:18:29,394
He didn't say much.

3599
02:18:31,527 --> 02:18:33,327
I mean, once I'd managed to kill Jimmy,

3600
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:35,093
in self-defense, um, he, he,

3601
02:18:35,093 --> 02:18:37,526
he ran out of the house,

3602
02:18:39,093 --> 02:18:40,793
and then you fine men turned up.

3603
02:18:41,993 --> 02:18:42,492
I see.

3604
02:18:43,492 --> 02:18:44,026
Well, it all seems

3605
02:18:44,026 --> 02:18:45,325
pretty straightforward to me,

3606
02:18:45,325 --> 02:18:46,659
but you might want to get

3607
02:18:46,659 --> 02:18:47,525
that wound looked at.

3608
02:18:48,558 --> 02:18:51,858
If you ask me, you're very lucky

3609
02:18:51,858 --> 02:18:53,457
it just grazed you.

3610
02:18:53,457 --> 02:18:54,724
God must have intervened.

3611
02:18:57,389 --> 02:18:58,189
Indeed.

3612
02:19:02,256 --> 02:19:04,490
Vivian, please sit down,

3613
02:19:04,490 --> 02:19:05,789
I've got something to tell you.

3614
02:19:05,789 --> 02:19:07,722
Mother, I have to go.

3615
02:19:07,722 --> 02:19:09,022
Veronica never showed last night

3616
02:19:09,022 --> 02:19:09,822
and I can't find Riff.

3617
02:19:09,822 --> 02:19:11,289
I need to make sure that he stops...

3618
02:19:11,455 --> 02:19:12,189
Stops what?

3619
02:19:14,421 --> 02:19:15,088
Teenage drama mother.

3620
02:19:15,555 --> 02:19:16,555
You don't need to know everything.

3621
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:18,554
Vivian, please.

3622
02:19:18,988 --> 02:19:20,087
It's terribly important.

3623
02:19:20,386 --> 02:19:21,521
I said I have to go.

3624
02:19:22,154 --> 02:19:23,520
Mrs Smart.

3625
02:19:25,587 --> 02:19:27,020
She's dead.

3626
02:19:31,053 --> 02:19:34,419
Vivian, oh Vivian.

3627
02:19:38,185 --> 02:19:42,084
Jimmy's also dead, and Riff, well,

3628
02:19:43,618 --> 02:19:44,418
it's not looking good

3629
02:19:44,418 --> 02:19:45,451
for him, he's in a coma.

3630
02:19:46,617 --> 02:19:47,350
What?

3631
02:19:48,750 --> 02:19:49,384
They were murdered

3632
02:19:49,384 --> 02:19:50,550
last night at her home.

3633
02:19:50,550 --> 02:19:51,450
They say... What?

3634
02:19:51,650 --> 02:19:53,815
What do they say?

3635
02:19:56,483 --> 02:19:58,582
They say that Jimmy was in love with her.

3636
02:20:00,015 --> 02:20:01,449
She turned him down

3637
02:20:01,449 --> 02:20:03,215
and Jimmy shot Veronica.

3638
02:20:03,215 --> 02:20:04,348
Cliff got off one shot

3639
02:20:04,348 --> 02:20:05,814
and then shot Jimmy dead?

3640
02:20:06,181 --> 02:20:07,914
No, you're lying,

3641
02:20:08,481 --> 02:20:11,014
Cliff is dead, Cliff Smart is dead.

3642
02:20:11,714 --> 02:20:13,080
Cliff's fine. No, you're lying.

3643
02:20:13,114 --> 02:20:14,614
I don't lie Vivian.

3644
02:20:15,113 --> 02:20:17,446
How could she be dead,

3645
02:20:18,246 --> 02:20:20,512
and how could Jimmy kill her,

3646
02:20:20,512 --> 02:20:23,112
he couldn't, he wouldn't kill her.

3647
02:20:23,712 --> 02:20:25,445
Sometimes you don't see what's going on

3648
02:20:25,445 --> 02:20:26,112
even with the people

3649
02:20:26,145 --> 02:20:27,244
that you're closest to.

3650
02:20:27,712 --> 02:20:29,712
Riff, oh, God.

3651
02:20:30,111 --> 02:20:31,911
Riff why didn't you stop it,

3652
02:20:31,911 --> 02:20:32,844
why did you join in?

3653
02:20:34,011 --> 02:20:35,277
Oh Vivian, what can I do?

3654
02:20:36,277 --> 02:20:37,344
He took her from me.

3655
02:20:38,077 --> 02:20:38,844
From us.

3656
02:20:40,010 --> 02:20:42,343
Jimmy was obviously very confused.

3657
02:20:43,276 --> 02:20:44,643
She was my only friend.

3658
02:20:46,343 --> 02:20:47,576
She was the only person

3659
02:20:47,576 --> 02:20:48,742
who ever believed in me.

3660
02:20:48,909 --> 02:20:49,842
That's not true.

3661
02:20:49,842 --> 02:20:51,275
I've always believed in you.

3662
02:20:51,275 --> 02:20:54,175
How can she not be here anymore.

3663
02:20:54,608 --> 02:20:56,575
Oh God mother, it hurts.

3664
02:20:59,974 --> 02:21:01,007
it's OK.

3665
02:21:01,374 --> 02:21:02,074
It's OK.

3666
02:21:02,141 --> 02:21:06,607
It's OK to be sad.

3667
02:21:06,939 --> 02:21:07,740
Sad?

3668
02:21:08,606 --> 02:21:10,839
Sad, he took her from me.

3669
02:21:11,839 --> 02:21:14,606
Oh, no, my head is spinning.

3670
02:21:14,905 --> 02:21:16,005
God, mother

3671
02:21:16,005 --> 02:21:17,738
she was my ticket out of here,

3672
02:21:17,738 --> 02:21:19,538
she was going to make me a star.

3673
02:21:22,005 --> 02:21:23,871
Let me get you some hot tea.

3674
02:21:23,871 --> 02:21:25,604
I don't need hot tea.

3675
02:21:25,604 --> 02:21:27,404
I need to make him pay.

3676
02:21:28,437 --> 02:21:30,037
Jimmy paid with his life, Vivian.

3677
02:21:30,737 --> 02:21:31,303
Jimmy?

3678
02:21:31,303 --> 02:21:34,203
Oh mother, you have no idea

3679
02:21:34,270 --> 02:21:35,569
what you're talking about.

3680
02:21:35,569 --> 02:21:37,003
Then talk to me, please.

3681
02:21:37,003 --> 02:21:38,702
Mother, I need to be alone.

3682
02:21:40,135 --> 02:21:40,669
Vivian, please.

3683
02:21:40,669 --> 02:21:42,902
I said, get out, mother,

3684
02:21:43,101 --> 02:21:44,768
get out, get out, get out.

3685
02:21:45,368 --> 02:21:47,401
I never want to see you again.

3686
02:21:47,401 --> 02:21:49,668
Get out, I never want to see you anymore.

3687
02:21:53,167 --> 02:21:53,967
No.

3688
02:22:00,332 --> 02:22:01,799
Oh God. No. No.

3689
02:22:04,866 --> 02:22:06,465
How can he do this.

3690
02:22:38,028 --> 02:22:39,828
The innocence of youth was lost.

3691
02:22:40,394 --> 02:22:41,094
The paths they took

3692
02:22:41,094 --> 02:22:42,661
led to their own downfall.

3693
02:22:43,493 --> 02:22:44,660
Veronica had destroyed

3694
02:22:44,694 --> 02:22:46,260
everybody to get what she wanted

3695
02:22:46,860 --> 02:22:48,626
and if she went to hell, I'm

3696
02:22:48,626 --> 02:22:49,725
sure even the devil

3697
02:22:49,725 --> 02:22:50,725
wouldn't recognize her.

3698
02:22:51,593 --> 02:22:52,593
It's two days later

3699
02:22:53,026 --> 02:22:54,026
and Cliff was finished

3700
02:22:54,026 --> 02:22:55,225
playing the grieving husband.

3701
02:22:55,659 --> 02:22:57,492
In fact, Cliff had a secret of his own.

3702
02:23:01,690 --> 02:23:02,658
Get over here, baby.

3703
02:23:03,824 --> 02:23:05,557
I got you a brandy darling

3704
02:23:05,557 --> 02:23:06,491
just how you like it.

3705
02:23:06,991 --> 02:23:08,757
God, I'm so grateful

3706
02:23:08,757 --> 02:23:09,957
to have you at my side.

3707
02:23:11,257 --> 02:23:13,655
So, Cliff, Veronica never knew.

3708
02:23:13,990 --> 02:23:15,422
She never knew that we didn't break up?

3709
02:23:15,889 --> 02:23:16,756
Never had a clue.

3710
02:23:17,356 --> 02:23:18,889
Went to her grave, none the wiser.

3711
02:23:19,822 --> 02:23:20,755
I still can't believe

3712
02:23:20,755 --> 02:23:22,322
she was murdered in this house.

3713
02:23:22,522 --> 02:23:24,421
Yeah, tough break.

3714
02:23:25,455 --> 02:23:27,755
I mean, we had our disagreements, but

3715
02:23:28,788 --> 02:23:29,721
I never wanted her dead,

3716
02:23:30,421 --> 02:23:31,386
even after all she did.

3717
02:23:31,921 --> 02:23:34,087
You are handling it so well.

3718
02:23:34,554 --> 02:23:35,886
It can't be easy for you.

3719
02:23:36,853 --> 02:23:38,619
The pain will always be there.

3720
02:23:38,619 --> 02:23:39,886
And that's because you're such

3721
02:23:39,886 --> 02:23:41,019
a good man, Cliff Smart.

3722
02:23:41,353 --> 02:23:42,553
And you're going to make

3723
02:23:42,553 --> 02:23:44,252
a wonderful father to our baby.

3724
02:23:45,019 --> 02:23:46,919
A little Cliff running around.

3725
02:23:46,919 --> 02:23:48,085
Or Lana.

3726
02:23:48,818 --> 02:23:49,718
I'm so grateful

3727
02:23:49,718 --> 02:23:51,151
you decided against doing your show.

3728
02:23:51,151 --> 02:23:53,918
Now you're with child.

3729
02:23:53,918 --> 02:23:55,451
No wife of mine will be

3730
02:23:55,451 --> 02:23:56,317
burdened with work.

3731
02:23:57,517 --> 02:23:58,884
You're a housewife and a mother.

3732
02:23:59,984 --> 02:24:01,117
The greatest job there is.

3733
02:24:03,016 --> 02:24:04,315
Are you expecting anybody?

3734
02:24:05,183 --> 02:24:05,483
No.

3735
02:24:05,815 --> 02:24:07,216
Don't you move, I'll get it.

3736
02:24:07,216 --> 02:24:09,116
You'll do nothing of the sort.

3737
02:24:09,116 --> 02:24:10,182
Let me get it.

3738
02:24:10,182 --> 02:24:11,582
I'll be waiting in the bedroom for you

3739
02:24:11,582 --> 02:24:12,182
Cliffy.

3740
02:24:12,615 --> 02:24:13,282
Lana.

3741
02:24:14,482 --> 02:24:15,415
I ain't going to waste

3742
02:24:15,415 --> 02:24:16,448
my second chance at love, baby.

3743
02:24:23,514 --> 02:24:24,614
Cliff reached out for

3744
02:24:24,614 --> 02:24:26,347
the door and opened it,

3745
02:24:26,947 --> 02:24:29,279
and so his surprise, he sees Veronica

3746
02:24:29,279 --> 02:24:30,746
stood there with her back to him.

3747
02:24:31,646 --> 02:24:32,546
He's taken aback,

3748
02:24:33,179 --> 02:24:34,312
but a moment later,

3749
02:24:34,312 --> 02:24:35,612
the woman turns around

3750
02:24:35,612 --> 02:24:36,645
and it's not Veronica.

3751
02:24:37,011 --> 02:24:38,845
It's Vivian, dressed

3752
02:24:38,845 --> 02:24:40,212
in a killer red dress,

3753
02:24:40,212 --> 02:24:42,145
she looks just like Veronica.

3754
02:24:44,044 --> 02:24:45,278
What the hell do you want?

3755
02:24:46,711 --> 02:24:47,844
Why are you dressed like that?

3756
02:24:48,177 --> 02:24:50,444
Well, Cliffy, I have a message for you.

3757
02:24:51,310 --> 02:24:52,410
Who is it, sweetheart?

3758
02:24:53,510 --> 02:24:54,576
Well what the hell kind of message

3759
02:24:54,576 --> 02:24:55,410
would you have for me?

3760
02:24:56,009 --> 02:24:57,176
It's simple, Cliffy.

3761
02:24:57,609 --> 02:24:58,342
It's from Veronica.

3762
02:24:59,475 --> 02:25:00,742
Veronica's dead.

3763
02:25:00,742 --> 02:25:04,475
Yes Cliffy, and she's real mad about it.

3764
02:25:23,306 --> 02:25:24,339
LANA!!

3765
02:25:25,405 --> 02:25:26,572
Aaaahhhhh!!!

3766
02:25:49,402 --> 02:25:50,101
Vivian would be arrested

3767
02:25:50,601 --> 02:25:52,235
and sent to a mental institution

3768
02:25:52,469 --> 02:25:54,235
where she would remain for years.

3769
02:25:56,768 --> 02:25:58,901
Vivian Pierce, this sweet girl

3770
02:25:58,901 --> 02:26:00,668
with a bright future ahead of her

3771
02:26:00,668 --> 02:26:01,867
had now vanished.

3772
02:26:02,434 --> 02:26:03,567
All that was left,

3773
02:26:03,567 --> 02:26:05,333
a broken shell of a girl

3774
02:26:05,634 --> 02:26:07,067
who soul seems to have been

3775
02:26:07,067 --> 02:26:08,933
completely removed from her body.

3776
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:10,832
Her mother and loyal friend

3777
02:26:10,832 --> 02:26:12,133
will be her only visitors.

3778
02:26:12,499 --> 02:26:15,099
And even then, Jean never gets to truly

3779
02:26:15,466 --> 02:26:16,132
see her daughter.

3780
02:26:17,564 --> 02:26:18,232
It would be a week later,

3781
02:26:18,598 --> 02:26:21,331
when Riff opened his eyes, and his mouth.

3782
02:26:22,365 --> 02:26:24,530
Yeah, he told us the whole sordid story.

3783
02:26:25,030 --> 02:26:26,231
It was only at that moment

3784
02:26:26,431 --> 02:26:27,731
that everything fell into place.

3785
02:26:28,231 --> 02:26:29,630
The affair, the murder

3786
02:26:29,630 --> 02:26:31,097
plot, thedouble cross.

3787
02:26:31,097 --> 02:26:32,330
It was something that

3788
02:26:32,330 --> 02:26:33,696
even the best Hollywood writers

3789
02:26:33,696 --> 02:26:34,363
ccoudn't have dreamed up.

3790
02:26:36,229 --> 02:26:37,896
Riff would be sent to jail for 10 years

3791
02:26:37,896 --> 02:26:39,396
for the murder of Veronica Smart.

3792
02:26:39,962 --> 02:26:40,994
But he's using the time

3793
02:26:40,994 --> 02:26:42,462
to better himself,

3794
02:26:42,462 --> 02:26:44,162
to learn himself a trade.

3795
02:26:44,162 --> 02:26:45,994
God, please let one positive come

3796
02:26:45,994 --> 02:26:46,728
from this tragedy.

3797
02:26:47,728 --> 02:26:48,928
In all my years,

3798
02:26:48,928 --> 02:26:49,828
I had never seen a more

3799
02:26:49,828 --> 02:26:51,327
twisted or tragic story

3800
02:26:51,827 --> 02:26:53,527
from one teenage boys fantasy

3801
02:26:53,794 --> 02:26:55,794
and one manipulative woman's motives came

3802
02:26:55,794 --> 02:26:57,027
the murders of Jimmy Flynn,

3803
02:26:57,327 --> 02:26:59,126
Cliff Smart and Veronica Smart.

3804
02:26:59,793 --> 02:27:01,458
The tragedy wouldn't end there, however,

3805
02:27:01,458 --> 02:27:03,859
the implications were far and wide.

3806
02:27:04,192 --> 02:27:05,392
It would be too much for Harvey.

3807
02:27:05,892 --> 02:27:08,359
He will blame himself for how hard

3808
02:27:08,359 --> 02:27:09,725
he had been towards his son, a charge

3809
02:27:09,725 --> 02:27:10,858
he was sadly guilty of.

3810
02:27:11,358 --> 02:27:13,291
So on a cold winter night,

3811
02:27:13,690 --> 02:27:15,291
Harvey Flynn took a large drink

3812
02:27:15,291 --> 02:27:16,324
from his bottle of whiskey,

3813
02:27:16,891 --> 02:27:17,891
picks up his pistol,

3814
02:27:18,291 --> 02:27:19,724
aimed it at his head and.

3815
02:27:21,257 --> 02:27:23,323
Well, he didn't pull the trigger,

3816
02:27:24,123 --> 02:27:24,890
stopping himself

3817
02:27:24,890 --> 02:27:26,155
becoming the latest victim

3818
02:27:26,155 --> 02:27:26,922
of this tragedy.

3819
02:27:28,522 --> 02:27:30,789
As for me, well, I left the force.

3820
02:27:31,689 --> 02:27:33,522
The case lingered over every move I made.

3821
02:27:34,322 --> 02:27:35,488
This ain't like the movies,

3822
02:27:35,822 --> 02:27:37,521
the detective doesn't always get his man.

3823
02:27:38,421 --> 02:27:40,288
So now I write pulp detective novels

3824
02:27:40,654 --> 02:27:42,787
like this one you witnessed, it's

3825
02:27:42,787 --> 02:27:44,720
cathartic in a way, it helps me release

3826
02:27:44,820 --> 02:27:45,820
the nightmares I see

3827
02:27:45,820 --> 02:27:47,053
in my sleep to the page.

3828
02:27:47,053 --> 02:27:49,186
It helps me to put them to bed for good.

3829
02:27:50,186 --> 02:27:51,153
Now it's your nightmare.

3830
02:27:52,553 --> 02:27:54,618
You see, the city is a scary place.

3831
02:27:54,618 --> 02:27:56,152
nobody is what they seem.

3832
02:27:56,851 --> 02:27:58,419
Evil doesn't always hide around

3833
02:27:58,419 --> 02:28:00,185
dark corners, and innocence

3834
02:28:01,018 --> 02:28:03,218
doesn't automatically mean innocent.

3835
02:28:03,218 --> 02:28:05,684
People are far more complex than that.

3836
02:28:06,583 --> 02:28:07,284
In this case,

3837
02:28:08,550 --> 02:28:09,850
they showed me the horrific acts

3838
02:28:09,850 --> 02:28:11,283
that people can do to one another

3839
02:28:12,017 --> 02:28:13,050
over a beautiful

3840
02:28:13,383 --> 02:28:14,483
but unworthy woman.

3841
02:28:15,850 --> 02:28:17,916
See, nobody is truly bad

3842
02:28:17,916 --> 02:28:19,682
or good, right or wrong.

3843
02:28:20,382 --> 02:28:21,482
Human existence is far

3844
02:28:21,482 --> 02:28:22,715
more complicated than that.

3845
02:28:23,748 --> 02:28:25,314
And that's the scariest thing of all,

3846
02:28:26,314 --> 02:28:27,748
because you can never see it coming.

3847
02:28:29,414 --> 02:28:30,280
This is my city,

3848
02:28:31,247 --> 02:28:32,447
and I prided myself on

3849
02:28:32,447 --> 02:28:33,614
solving every case

3850
02:28:33,614 --> 02:28:34,779
that came across my desk.

3851
02:28:35,779 --> 02:28:36,813
Well, apart from one,

3852
02:28:37,613 --> 02:28:39,180
the case of Veronica Smart,

3853
02:28:40,546 --> 02:28:41,546
a woman who destroyed

3854
02:28:41,546 --> 02:28:42,813
everything that got in her way.
