about to start at the firm,

674

that was to you.

Well, I didn't give anything up.

678
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,289
I mean, I chose my son, so.

679

I figured we'd see each other again.

You know, whenever I would think of you,

-I didn't almost kill your car.

and I was teaching you how to drive stick.

Yes. Yes!

729
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,851
Yes, and at the top of every hill,
you were just peeing in your pants

730
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,145
and praying, "Please,
don't let the light be red."

731
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,772
-No. That's your bad.
-"Please, don't let the light be red."

734

if I could drive those streets,

I mean, nobody here knows me like that.

746
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,992
It's beautiful here.

747
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,955
I mean, everything's so new,
at least to me.

What's he saying?

770
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,887
The girl on the left is his wife.

771
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,516
And the one on the right, his true love.

772
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:17,521
The man who died was
a good friend of mine all my life.

773
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:22,401
Actually, he was more like
a brother than a friend.

774
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:27,156
You may think he's
some kind of ladies' man,

775
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:32,453
but I'd like to think of him as someone
who just had too much love in his heart

776
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,039
to share it with just one woman.

777
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,666
He loved his wife and his family fiercely

778
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,169
and they loved him too.

779
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,923
The wife never really did anything wrong.

780
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:47,510
And yet he still loved another as well.

781
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:52,306
You see, she is his childhood sweetheart.

782
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,811
Though they never really got together
until later in life.

783
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,815
As they say, unrequited love never dies.

784
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,403
You know the problem
with loving two women?

785
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,741
You can never be there fully for either.

786
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,495
Yep, I'm just an old man.

787
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,164
But if I could give you advice?

788
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,961
Don't ever cheat on each other.

789
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:26,006
If ever you fall in love
for another, end it.

790
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,594
And then you can go to the next
and love her all you've got.

791
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,681
But as I see it,

792
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,518
I won't have to worry about you two.

793
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:43,732

Yo, good morning. What's up?

1187
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,641
Just stopping by.
Meeting Sammy at the mall in a bit.

-Maybe I'll meet you later.
-Oh yeah.

Hey, is anybody going to
the Fil-Am dance tonight?

1195

-Oh, Mama, that's your thing.
-Can't do it.

1196
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,702
Tell the titos and titas
that I send my love.

-Yeah, he does, where?

1198

supporting the Fil-Am.

1199
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:06,754
-Hey, Ma, I already sent a check in.
-Yeah, for all of us, right?

1200
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:08,923
Look, it's not enough
to donate money, okay?

1201
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:12,635
My generation is older now
and the models are passing away.

It's up to you guys to keep this going.

I can't make it I got a date.

Oh, I wanna know about that date.
Tell us about it.

-What'd he say?
-I don't know.

1207
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:27,400
-Did he say he has a date?
-I think he has a date.

1208
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,443
-Wow.
-Yeah, wow.

1209
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:32,071
-This is good.
-Yeah, it's good, but how?

-I have no clue.
-It's all good, baby.

1212

Yeah, so, a date, huh?

Yeah, she was… she…

1214

Oh yeah.

1216

-Yeah.
-Hey, how'd you meet her?

1217
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,466
-Yeah, where did you meet this girl?
-On my phone.

-Your phone?
-Yeah, it's an app.

1219
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,555
What, you're on a dating app? All right.

1220
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,765
How does that work?

1221
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,934
You know it's kind of like a… like a bar.

1222
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:03,811
Wait, a bar?

1223

01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,570
You go there, you meet people?
Except it's on your phone.

-Okay, a bar on my phone.
-Is she cute?

-That's good, right?
-She's cute.

Great, man, because
you don't have to buy girls drinks.

you chat, you talk, you smash.

1232
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:24,373
I'm just going to go meet her.

It's cool, right?

I mean, it can't hurt.

go help Lola wipe her butt?

Hi. You came.

I wasn't sure you'd make it.

No, I, I said I'd come,

And you're looking at me right now,

that I lied to you in some way,

I mean I didn't tell you everything, yeah,
okay, but it's just those fucking apps.

I feel like they lend themselves to lying.

And I don't want to lie to you,

01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,013
So, it's good.

1525
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,222
Good.

1526
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:22,474
Good, right?

1527
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,310
Yes, David, you did a good job, okay?

1528
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:28,438
I'm just saying, man. Just give me
some credit where credit's due, okay?

1529
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:30,231
'Cause there are some things
I don't know about,

1530
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:32,650
but then there are some things
that I kind of know about.

1531
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,569
Yeah, well, what do you know
about this fried rice right here?

1532
01:24:34,652 --> 01:24:37,113
-It's SPAM.
-Oh, yo, yo, good morning.

1533
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:40,700
-Morning, son.
-Pop.

1534
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,453
So?

1535
01:24:43,536 --> 01:24:44,496
"So"?

1536
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:46,498
How was your date?

1537
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:48,666
Hey, can you just let
the guy have his coffee?

1538
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,626
I'm just asking.

1539
01:24:49,709 --> 01:24:51,628
What? He's not wrong.
Let the man have his coffee.

1540
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:54,089
-I just wanna know what's happening.
-[Danny boy] Good.

1541
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:55,048
What?

1542
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:56,216
Good. The date.

1543
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:58,468
It actually went kind of good.

1544
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:01,012
Well, see, there you go, man,
shit went good.

1545
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,973
-I mean good like how good?
-Yeah, I mean who is she?

1546
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:05,183
Is she a nice girl?

1547
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:06,810
Well, she's here.

1548
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:07,769
-What?
-She's here?

1549
01:25:07,852 --> 01:25:10,313
-You brought her home last night?
-Well, yeah, I'm sorry.

1550
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:12,941
I would have let you know,
but I was late, you know, so.

1551
01:25:13,024 --> 01:25:15,276
No, it's okay, we're just surprised,
right, guys?

1552
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,528
Good surprised.

1553
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:19,197
Hey, did you guys fuck last night?

1554
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,698
-[speaking Tagalog]
-[woman] David!

1555
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,534
-What?
-The fucking kids, man.

1556
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:23,576
-Dayo.
-[Dayo] David.

1557
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:26,621
What? I'm just saying
what everyone's thinking.

1558
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:29,082
You calm down, you guys,
she's sleeping up there.

1559
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:31,209
-Oh no, she's up.
-[Dayo] She's awake?

1560
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,670
-[David] What?
-She's… I was just getting her some tea.

1561
01:25:33,753 --> 01:25:36,673
-Well, if she's up, bringing her down.
-Yeah, we have breakfast, man.

1562
01:25:36,756 --> 01:25:38,967
-[Dayo] Come and eat.
-[David] Tea ain't breakfast.

1563
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:41,678
-[Duke] Some Filipino breakfast.
-[Dayo] …brother, man.

1564
01:25:41,761 --> 01:25:44,347
-Let her know how us Filipinos roll.
-Okay, I'll go get her.

1565
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:46,683
-All right, go… Yeah, man.
-[mom talks indistinctly]

1566
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:47,809
-Wow.
-Damn.

1567
01:25:47,892 --> 01:25:49,644
I didn't know he was gonna bring her home.

1568
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:52,272
I can't believe
he brought her home last night. Yo!

1569
01:25:52,355 --> 01:25:53,773
[Teresa] I wasn't ready to meet…

1570
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:56,109
-I will, okay.
-[indistinct chatter from brothers]

1571
01:25:56,192 --> 01:25:58,069
-Hi.
-[David] Looks good, guys, looks good.

1572
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,445
[dead silence]

1573
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:07,495
[whoosh]

1574
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:10,415
-[electronic music playing]
-So this is Duke.

1575
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:12,959
-Hi.
-[awkwardly] Pleasure.

1576
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,879
-Hey, I'm David.
-Hello.

1577
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:18,506
-Yeah, you're welcome.
-He's the youngest brother.

1578
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,009
-Oh, you're the one who did the app.
-Gotcha.

1579
01:26:21,092 --> 01:26:22,302
Okay. [laughs]

1580
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:24,762
And this is my oldest brother, Dayo.

1581
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:27,515
Dayo, hi. Teresa.

1582
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,684
-Yo, what the fuck is going on here?
-Dayo, man!

1583
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:32,562
What is this?
Is this some kind of joke or something?

1584
01:26:32,645 --> 01:26:36,191
-David, you're the one who set them up.
-What?

1585
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,318
Hey, I'm so sorry, my family--

1586
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:39,861
You seem really cool. Are you okay?

1587
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:42,405
-Oh, yeah, yeah, it's just Braxton-Hicks.
-Braxton what?

1588
01:26:42,488 --> 01:26:45,116
-It's contractions. Fake contractions.
-Oh. Hey!

1589
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,161
[chaotic angry shouting]

1590
01:26:48,244 --> 01:26:51,039
-You put your brother--
-Dayo, no, he did a good thing!

1591
01:26:51,122 --> 01:26:54,209
Okay, listen, everybody.
Everybody, listen.

1592
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,252
Listen. This…

1593
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:58,713
This is Teresa, okay.

1594
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:01,758
She's pregnant yeah, very, very pregnant.

1595
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:06,054
But she's also resilient a-and beautiful

1596
01:27:06,137 --> 01:27:09,182
and so alive and strong, and…

1597
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:12,101
I don't even know how we met.
Okay? It's crazy.

1598
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:15,438
I can't even understand it,
but she sees me,

1599
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:18,858
and I her, okay?

1600
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:20,151
I know…

1601
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,737
I know I've been, I've been
messed up in the head

1602
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:25,323
for a long time now, but, but…

1603
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:29,661
Dayo, you've been,
you've been very kind to me,

1604
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:31,204
and I appreciate that,

1605
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:33,581
but I'm asking you,

1606
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:36,793
please, please be kind to her too, okay?

1607
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:38,044
Because…

1608
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:41,923
I fell in love with her.

1609
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:45,760
[Teresa giggling]

1610
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:47,178
Wow.

1611
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,888
-Okay.
-[Teresa] That's sweet.

1612
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:51,266
This is awesome.

1613
01:27:52,725 --> 01:27:55,395
-You motherfucker!
-[mom screaming]

1614
01:27:55,478 --> 01:27:56,854
-[Dayo shouts angrily]
-Hey!

1615
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:00,149
-Wait!
-[Dayo] Damn it! Goddamn it!

1616
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:01,484
[Mr. Abasta] What are you--?

1617
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:04,529
You guys are making fools of yourselves
in front of this woman.

1618
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:06,990
That's okay, Mr. Abasta.

1619
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:10,952
When are you guys gonna grow up?
Show some responsibility?

1620
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:15,164
I've had it with you guys.

1621
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:18,751
You boys think you rule everything.

1622
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:21,004
All I see is you running away.

1623
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:23,339
From your culture. From yourself.

1624
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:25,925
Do you think you have control over love?

1625
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:28,219
When it happens? Who it happens to?

1626
01:28:28,761 --> 01:28:30,555
As if you have a say.

1627
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:33,016
But we know better, don't we?

1628
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:34,267
[laughs]

1629
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:38,479
Thank you. [sighs]

1630
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:39,897
He's a good man.

1631
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:43,151
A bit bruised,
but he comes from good roots.

1632
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:46,154
You can't tell by all the commotion
between his brothers,

1633
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:49,741
but if you can love him,
who are we to judge?

1634
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:52,785
Yeah, bro, don't judge.

1635
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:53,911
[Dayo clicks teeth]

1636
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:56,456
-[yelps and groans]
-[splat sound]

1637
01:28:56,539 --> 01:28:58,958
[gasps] I think my water just broke.

1638
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:00,668
[groans] What?

1639
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:02,587
It's in my mouth.

1640
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,714
[Duke] She said she had
Toni Braxton cramps!

1641
01:29:04,797 --> 01:29:08,509
-Oh man, what are we going to do now?
-Get Doris, she's a nurse.

1642
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:12,263
[tinkling upbeat music playing]

1643
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:15,975
These brothers,
these fabulous Filipino brothers,

1644
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:17,852
are my brothers.

1645
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:20,772
Yeah, I'm the youngest, the sister.

1646
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:23,608
To which you say,
"I didn't know they had a sister."

1647
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:26,944
And that's when I say,
"Yes, story of my life."

1648
01:29:27,987 --> 01:29:31,574
For a lot of families,
especially Filipino families,

1649
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:32,742
it's all about the boys.

1650
01:29:32,825 --> 01:29:36,204
And I admit, yes, in my life,
it's been all about these boys.

1651
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:39,791
But while they're running around
making a mess,

1652
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,000
make no mistake,

1653
01:29:41,584 --> 01:29:44,462
it's the women in the family
who hold it down.

1654
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:48,382
How far apart are the contractions?

1655
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:50,593
I don't know, I haven't been
timing them. Ow! Ow!

1656
01:29:50,676 --> 01:29:53,346
It's okay. You're gonna be okay,
you just gotta breathe.

1657
01:29:53,429 --> 01:29:55,056
-Okay, okay.
-This is Teresa.

1658
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:56,849
I am Doris, I am the sister.

1659
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:58,059
Good one, David.

1660
01:29:58,142 --> 01:30:00,770
Let's get her in the hospital. Get her up.
Get her purse, David.

1661
01:30:00,853 --> 01:30:02,939
[David] Why me?
Why do I have to get the purse?

1662
01:30:03,022 --> 01:30:05,983
-I'm not going to make it.
-Stop, everybody. Turn it around.

1663
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:07,902
-On the table.
-Clear the food.

1664
01:30:07,985 --> 01:30:11,697
[Doris] Dayo, get the gloves!
Danny boy, get some pillows!

1665
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:14,158
-Let's go. It's okay, I got you.
-There's food here.

1666
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:16,285
[Doris] Slowly, slowly, slowly.

1667
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:18,287
There we go. There we go.

1668
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:20,164
-[Duke] Towels!
-[David] I got the purse!

1669
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:22,542
-Here are the gloves.
-You're late!

1670
01:30:23,417 --> 01:30:26,087
-[Doris] Then you're gonna push.
-[Teresa] Okay.

1671
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:27,588
-Here it comes.
-Here it comes.

1672
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,465
-[Doris] And, push!
-[all] Push!

1673
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:33,386
[all screaming]

1674
01:30:33,469 --> 01:30:35,596
[soft music playing]

1675
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:41,060
[woman] Good job, Felix.

1676
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:43,855
[all] Cheese.

1677
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:45,815
[photographer] Okay, let's go, one crazy.

1678
01:30:45,898 --> 01:30:49,902
[all cheering]

1679
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:52,738
[upbeat music playing]

1680
01:30:57,368 --> 01:30:58,911
[inaudible]

1681
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:03,249
[all cheering]

1682
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:06,127
-Seven iron all day, I'll beat you.
-David.

1683
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:07,503
-David.
-What?

1684
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:10,173
-I'd like you to meet your cousin.
-Cousin?

1685
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:14,552
Cousin's wife's sister
on Tita Beverly's side.

1686
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:17,972
And she's recently divorced.

1687
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:21,100
