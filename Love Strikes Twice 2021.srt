5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,800
- Because the situation
is blowing up.

6
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:26,700
I don't have time put out
every fire your client

7
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:29,367
feels like starting, that's why.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,266
Well, sure, but enough
with the demurrals

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,233
and the stalling
tactics, counselor.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,934
Well, that's what I'm saying.

11
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,033
I suggest that you settle.

12
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,200
You know if I get you into court

13
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,100
I'll burn this
case to the ground.

14
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:42,266
- And the kitchen's
on fire again.

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,967
- What?

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,300
I was gonna make us eggs.

17
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:46,700
- But then you
answered your phone.

18
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:48,200
- I did, yeah, I did.

19
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,700
It's the Phitzer case.

20
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:52,033
The opposing counsel is
being really uncooperative.

21
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,934
- Well, they are the
opposing counsel.

22
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:55,467
- Thank you.

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,734
Oh, hey, I'm not gonna be
able to get away to pick up

24
00:00:56,867 --> 00:00:59,200
that silver tray for my parents'
anniversary party tonight.

25
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,700
Can you do it?

26
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:02,133
- I have history tutoring
after my last class.

27
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:03,633
You know that.

28
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:06,533
- Josh, can you cancel
it just this once please?

29
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,300
Honey, this case
has got me really-

30
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:09,967
- That's every case.

31
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,500
And I'm always the one
that picks up the slack.

32
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:13,367
- Please.

33
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:17,133
- Okay.
- Thank you.

34
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:21,600
- You're welcome.

35
00:01:21,734 --> 00:01:23,800
- Maggie Turner.

36
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:24,834
- Bon appetit.

37
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:31,600
- Hey, Melissa.

38
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:36,834
- You're
in bright and early.

39
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:38,266
- Good morning, Mr. Baxter.

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,500
I didn't think anyone
else would be in.

41
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:40,433
- There were
transactions I needed

42
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,433
to manage before the
day gets started.

43
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:43,834
- I'm just taking care
of some things myself

44
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,667
'cause I have to leave
an hour early today.

45
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,333
It's my parents' 40th
wedding anniversary.

46
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:52,333
A big party, tent in the
backyard, that kinda thing.

47
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:54,000
I will be taking work with me,

48
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:56,867
and I'll be
available on my cell.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,166
- I like that attitude.

50
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,900
And what you did
with the Inova case,

51
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,066
the way you completely
dismantled opposing counsel

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,233
in the courtroom, that
was very impressive.

53
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,233
- Thank you, sir.

54
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:08,467
- Yeah, you've become
quite the barracuda.

55
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,867
- Well, I'm just hoping to
swim with the sharks one day.

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,834
- Reviews come up next month.

57
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,066
We should discuss a
junior partner slot.

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,333
- That's very
exciting, Mr. Baxter.

59
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:19,600
Thank you.

60
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:24,000
- You know the real carnivores
in the firm can call me Mal.

61
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,734
- All right, Mal, I
will keep that in mind.

62
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:29,433
I'll leave you to it.
- Please do.

63
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,767
- I'm here!

64
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,700
Where's my contract?

65
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:40,667
Whoa, haven't seen you this
intense since rush week.

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,033
- Kappas forever.

67
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,567
- So, I was thinking
that after I sign

68
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,700
my life altering contract,
we could play hooky.

69
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,934
I wanna go shopping
for something

70
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,066
for your parents'
40th anniversary.

71
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,367
- Oh, honey, that's so sweet.

72
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,667
You don't have to come.

73
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,500
- I wouldn't miss it, but I
do need to know the dress code

74
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,600
'cause currently all I have
are swimsuit prototypes

75
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:59,400
for next year's line and
old bridesmaid dresses.

76
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:00,467
- I asked mom.

77
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,266
She said, "festive casual."

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,467
I told her nobody
knows what that means.

79
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,533
- How would you know?

80
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:05,800
So, when was the last
time you went anywhere

81
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:07,333
that wasn't business attire?

82
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:08,300
- Okay, fine.

83
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:09,567
If you're giving me a hard time,

84
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,967
I can bill you for
this conversation.

85
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,467
I was going to congratulate you.

86
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,967
Sign where the flags are
and you will officially

87
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,800
have expanded into
premium outlets.

88
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:20,033
- Yes.

89
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,467
Maybe now my mother will stop
bothering me about Lester.

90
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,300
See, I can commit.

91
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:26,133
- What about Lester?

92
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:27,200
- Ugh, we broke up.

93
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,967
I just couldn't see
myself marrying Lester.

94
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,800
- Fair.
- I just need to find

95
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:30,867
what you and Josh have.

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,900
- I don't know if you
want that .

97
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,066
- No, you guys are good, right?

98
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,600
- I don't know,
I don't know what we are.

99
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:38,800
I feel like he's always
so disappointed in me,

100
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:40,300
and I thought that we both
knew what it would take

101
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:41,834
for me to make
partner here, right?

102
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:43,333
I have to be a killer.

103
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:45,800
And sometimes it's like I
can't turn it off with him,

104
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,834
and I just wonder sometimes

105
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:49,300
if he would be
happier without me.

106
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:50,934
- No, don't say that.

107
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:54,300
If you two can't make it
work, then I have no chance.

108
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:55,834
I am pinning all my
hopes on you guys.

109
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:56,667
- Oh, that's good,
no, that's great.

110
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,633
Thank you so much.

111
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,467
That's just what I
need, more pressure.

112
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,233
Congratulations,
Miss Entrepreneur.

113
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,867
- Oh, that actually reminds me.

114
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,667
You will never guess who
I ran into in the lobby.

115
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,066
- Who?
- Rick Morgan.

116
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,867
- What?
- He had an entourage.

117
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,367
- I thought he was
based in Seattle?

118
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,066
- Yeah, he is, but he's here
meeting with some PR firm.

119
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,800
Something about a
new solar company.

120
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,033
- You talked?
- Yeah.

121
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,700
He actually recognized me.

122
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:20,200
- Wow.
- And he asked about you.

123
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,834
- He asked about me?

124
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:24,033
I am surprised he
even remembers me.

125
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:27,700
- Oh, because you only
dated all through college.

126
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,033
Honestly, I always thought you
and Rick would get married.

127
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,200
- Hm, the road not taken.

128
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:37,166
That is my conference call.

129
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,367
- Oh, so no hooky?

130
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,700
- Sorry.

131
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:42,033
- I'll see you Saturday.

132
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,633
- Hello, this is Maggie Turner.

133
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,033
- Kappas forever.

134
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:47,467
- Hey, Jackson, I meant
to tell you earlier.

135
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,734
We're expected Callahan.

136
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:49,934
- Tell him we'd like to see
a deck for the new campaign

137
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,900
by Monday and I'm gonna send
it to the Seattle office.

138
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:53,233
- And to accept
that counter offer

139
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:54,233
sometime later this afternoon.

140
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:55,333
- And then we'll see
if we're able to buy-

141
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:56,300
- Not so much.

142
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:58,233
Oh, excuse me.
- Excuse...

143
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,467
Maggie.
- Rick, hi.

144
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,400
- Hi.

145
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:03,400
- Carrie was just up.

146
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,200
She told me that you
were in the building.

147
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,767
- This is crazy.

148
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,033
How are you?

149
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,100
Do you wanna grab a coffee?

150
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:10,600
- Yeah, yes.

151
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,100
- Uh, bump the- 00 to a- 30,

152
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:14,600
and the00 to a video
call from the jet.

153
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:16,400
- You know what, I
just realized I can't.

154
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,633
I'm sorry.

155
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:19,433
I'm so late, Josh
is gonna kill me.

156
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:20,700
- Oh, yeah, Josh.

157
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:21,400
How is he?

158
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:22,767
I heard you two got married.

159
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,100
- We did, yeah, we got married.

160
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:27,600
After I passed the bar and he
got his doctorate in history.

161
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:28,500
- Well, I won't keep you then.

162
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:29,800
But I'll be back
here in three weeks

163
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:31,800
if this PR things work out.

164
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:33,800
Call your office to setup lunch.

165
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,767
- Yeah, I'd like that very much.

166
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,600
- Looking forward to it.
- I'll see you then.

167
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:38,734
- Yeah.
- Bye.

168
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:43,934
Well, no, because it's
not a counter offer.

169
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,400
It's an insult.

170
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,433
Listen, I need a real
offer on my desk by Monday,

171
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:50,100
and I'm talking mid sixes or
the deal is off the table.

172
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah, fine.

173
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,100
Oh, come on.

174
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:57,600
- We wouldn't be traffic if-

175
00:05:57,734 --> 00:05:59,667
- Yes, I know, thank you.

176
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:02,600
That must be a good book.

177
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:06,000
What's it about?
- About 200 more pages.

178
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,500
I'm testing the kids on Monday.

179
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,834
- Hm.

180
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:12,333
You know it's not like you can
get an F, you're the teacher.

181
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:15,367
- Just because I don't
negotiate six figure deals,

182
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,000
it doesn't mean what
I do doesn't matter.

183
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:18,867
- I don't, I didn't say that.

184
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,333
I never say that.

185
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,600
You used to like to tell me
about what you were reading.

186
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:36,967
- Oh, hey, can you pull over?

187
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,166
- Mm hm, yeah.

188
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,767
You thinking about
the old library?

189
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,367
- Yeah, the city tore it
down and the lot sat empty

190
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,667
for so long they
built this eyesore.

191
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,166
- Yeah, who knew the
developers would run off

192
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,467
to South America with
the investors' money.

193
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,667
I know you love the library,
but I miss Flannigan's.

194
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,867
- This whole place
really went downhill

195
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,367
after the library was gone.

196
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,066
- Hm.

197
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:03,400
It wasn't all bad though.

198
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:04,567
It brought us
together, didn't it?

199
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,400
- I don't think pity
makes a great foundation

200
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:09,667
for a relationship.

201
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,333
- Why would you say that?

202
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:13,166
- The only reason we
started hanging out, Maggie,

203
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,066
was because you
felt sorry for me.

204
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,567
- That is...

205
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,433
That's not entirely true, Josh.

206
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:21,934
- Oh, come on.

207
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,900
I tried to save the
library, it got demolished,

208
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:28,934
I was crushed, it's not like
you noticed me much beforehand.

209
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:32,133
Let's not rewrite history.

210
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:40,233
- There they are!

211
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:42,266
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, honey.

212
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,667
- You can hire a
gardener you know?

213
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,767
- Oh, I'm
just cleaning up

214
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,100
the beds before the party.

215
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,400
- Yeah, what happened
to all your flowers?

216
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,000
- Oh, you know, I just,

217
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,600
I didn't really feel
up for it this year.

218
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:53,567
- Hm.

219
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,033
- How's my favorite son-in-law?

220
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,333
- Your only son-in-law?

221
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:58,066
- Tomato, tomato.

222
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:01,133
How's your dad?

223
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:02,734
Is he still liking Phoenix?

224
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:04,767
- Yeah, he says he'll take
the heat as long as he doesn't

225
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,567
have to live through
another Illinois winter.

226
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:10,600
- George!

227
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:12,967
- Is that Mags and Josh?

228
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,633
Or are you talking
to yourself again?

229
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:16,000
- Oh, hush, you.

230
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:17,633
Your father thinks
I'm losing it.

231
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:19,734
- She scurried around for half
an hour the other day looking

232
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,500
for her keys and they were
in her hand the whole time.

233
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,266
- This one didn't even
give me the heads up.

234
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,233
- I couldn't get a word in.

235
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,467
You keep talking to yourself.

236
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,467
- Ah.
- To be fair,

237
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,633
I also talk to myself.

238
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:30,834
- Well, don't blame me.

239
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:32,066
You get it from her.

240
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,567
Ash, come say hello
to your sister.

241
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,433
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, how are you?

242
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:37,734
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

243
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:39,133
I wish people would
stop worrying.

244
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:41,166
- Hey, George.
- Hello, son.

245
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,467
- Ash isn't still
living with you, is he?

246
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,467
- No, he has that
studio apartment behind
the Pick 'N Save.

247
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,734
- Huh.

248
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:49,600
- Sup?

249
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:51,800
- Hey.

250
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,300
- I made a pitcher of lemonade.

251
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:58,734
I thought we might all
eat out on the patio.

252
00:08:58,867 --> 00:09:00,066
- Okay.
- Sounds great.

253
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,867
Ash, what are you
up to these days?

254
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,400
- Just the same thing.

255
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,166
- That's not entirely true.

256
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,567
Ash got a promotion last month.

257
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,867
He's now assistant
in charge of...

258
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,900
What is it again?

259
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:14,200
- Software upgrades
and app installations.

260
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,367
Really not a big deal.

261
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,567
- But still, assistant in
charge, that's pretty cool.

262
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,700
- As smart as Ash is with
computers and all those things,

263
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,500
he could be running the
entire place over there

264
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:25,333
if he'd show a little
more confidence.

265
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:26,100
- Oh, whatever.

266
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,834
It's just a, it's a dumb job.

267
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,500
- So, Maggie, how's
work with you?

268
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,834
- Mm, work is pretty
great actually.

269
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:35,000
I won a big court
case last week.

270
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:37,033
And this morning one of the
senior partners mentioned

271
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,967
there might be a junior
partner slot coming up, so.

272
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,400
- How about that?

273
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:44,433
- Hey, is Dad okay?

274
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:45,600
It seems like he's having
more trouble getting around.

275
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:49,667
- Oh, well, you know, he
has good days and bad days.

276
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,400
But the way the fall
tore his spinal cord,

277
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,367
you know I just kick myself.

278
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,567
I shoulda made him throw out

279
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,066
that rickety old
ladder years ago.

280
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,367
- It's not your fault, Mom.

281
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,900
- Are you going back to work?

282
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,233
- I'm just, I'm
checking my email.

283
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:11,967
I always check my email
before bed at home.

284
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,200
- But we're not at home.

285
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,300
- I'm aware that
we're not at home.

286
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:17,333
Do you think maybe
here you can tell me

287
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:19,166
what's going on with you?

288
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,266
- Us, Maggie.

289
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,166
What's going on with us?

290
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:29,033
Sometimes I look at your
parents and I get sad.

291
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,000
They've been
together for 40 years

292
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:33,000
and they still like each other.

293
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,700
We've been together for 15-

294
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,000
- And you...

295
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,567
Are you saying that
you don't like me?

296
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,400
- I'm saying that
sometimes I'm not sure

297
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:44,467
if we ever should've gotten
married in the first place.

298
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,734
- Okay, okay, that's not...

299
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,333
That would be something that
we would need to talk about.

300
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,200
- Not here though, okay?

301
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,233
We'll talk about it when
we get back to Chicago.

302
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:05,700
- Sure.

303
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:08,533
Should I, should I just
sleep in my old room?

304
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:12,266
Should I-
- Whatever you want, Maggie.

305
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,300
- Whatever I want, okay.

306
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:22,266
Um, I'm gonna go for a walk.

307
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,834
- Okay.

308
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,367
- I wish I had a do-over.

309
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:24,000
Oh, shoot.

310
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,633
Ow!

311
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:53,367
Ow.

312
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:05,300
Josh?

313
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:11,533
Ow.

314
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,600
Where's my phone?

315
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:40,600
I'm gonna kill him.

316
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,567
Mom?

317
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,433
- In here.

318
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:46,734
- Mom, where's Ash?

319
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,200
He took my phone.

320
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,066
I can't do anything with
something this ancient.

321
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,166
- Your dad and I
just bought that

322
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,400
for your graduation last week.

323
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,700
How fast is technology moving?

324
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,567
- Mom, you look great.

325
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,166
Your hair looks good.
- Stop teasing.

326
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,467
I have an appointment to get
it done before the party.

327
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,300
- What?

328
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:10,233
- Honestly, George,
we do have glasses.

329
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:11,767
- Dad, what's happening?

330
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,834
What's going on?

331
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:14,467
- Okay, I admit it.

332
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,667
I was jogging.

333
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,066
I'm trying to up my cardio
so I can spin your mother

334
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,834
on the dance floor
all night long, huh?

335
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:21,166
Whoa, hey.

336
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,467
- You're a sweaty mess.
- Oh.

337
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,667
Come on, babe.

338
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Oh, shake it.
- George, stop it.

339
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:27,100
- And the big spin.
- Oh, no.

340
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,233
- Stop it!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

341
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:30,166
- Woo hoo.
- Woo hoo.

342
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,467
- Use the hips.

343
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,967
- Okay, look, I know
you're mad, but Josh...

344
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,000
Carrie.
- Mags.

345
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:50,300
- Carrie, oh my
gosh, okay, listen.

346
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:51,166
I don't know what's going on.

347
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,633
Something happened.

348
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,800
I had a fight with Josh
and then I went for a walk,

349
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:57,567
and then I, I, I, I made
a stupid wish I guess.

350
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,600
And then I hit my head
and then I woke up.

351
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:01,333
Okay, but now,
everything's different,

352
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,400
but it's not different.

353
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,533
It's the same as it was,
but it's not the same.

354
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,834
It's the same as before, but
like before, before, you know?

355
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:08,633
- Mags, what
are you talking about?

356
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:10,400
Sounds like you just
had a strange dream.

357
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:11,600
I dreamt about this big octopus,

358
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:14,633
and now I feel kinda weird
about going into the water.

359
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:16,867
BT dubs, you need
to get here soon.

360
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,667
Derrick is rocking
some board shorts.

361
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,700
- Sweetie, are you okay?

362
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:25,200
You looked a little pale
when you dashed out.

363
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,734
- Yes, I'm, listen, Carrie-

364
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:29,500
I'm gonna have to get back
to you on the shorts, bye.

365
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:31,633
- Rick, she'll be
down in a minute.

366
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:32,967
- Okay.

367
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,500
- What? Wait? Who?

368
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,567
- Hey, babe, are you coming?

369
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,667
Everyone's gonna be
at the lake already.

370
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,000
- Uh, you know what?

371
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:42,967
I don't think I can.

372
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,700
I have too much to do today.

373
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:45,767
- Yeah, going to the lake.

374
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,333
- What are you talking
about too much to do?

375
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:52,233
Yesterday, all you and Carrie
talked about was the lake.

376
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:55,367
Look, your beach bag
is already packed.

377
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,166
Oh, honey, I know it's
been stressful with LSATs

378
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,767
and law school applications,
but that's all behind you now.

379
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,767
Go, enjoy yourself.

380
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,667
You're only young once.

381
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:10,734
- Hi.
- Hey, beautiful.

382
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,934
- Hello.
- Oh, cute beach bag.

383
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:14,400
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

384
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:16,400
- Hi, ooh, holy moly.
- Oh?

385
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:19,300
- That's just, needs
to be over there.

386
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:21,066
- You're not still
mad at me are you?

387
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,767
- I don't know.

388
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,967
Maybe, why?

389
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,800
- I was just repeating
something stupid my dad said,

390
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:27,400
and I'm sorry.

391
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,600
Can we just get a do-over?

392
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:31,934
- Yes.

393
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:35,633
Yes, we can because
this, this is a do-over.

394
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,700
- And I know just how
to make it up to you.

395
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:40,567
- Okay.

396
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,633
Ah, ooh, yep.

397
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:45,633
Just, just one of those.
- Okay.

398
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:48,767
- Okay.

399
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:55,600
Oh, my gosh, it's Flannigan's.

400
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:57,200
I loved Flannigan's.

401
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,767
- Best banana cream
pie in the world.

402
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,433
- It is.

403
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,800
- Am I forgiven?

404
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,233
- I think so, yeah.

405
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:09,200
Wow.

406
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:13,100
- Thanks so much, I'll
see you at the rally.

407
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,934
- Josh.

408
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,867
- Maggie, you're back.

409
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,233
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi.

410
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:22,266
- What's up, Turner?

411
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,700
- Just trying to save
the library, Rick.

412
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,100
Getting ready for a
big rally tomorrow.

413
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:28,300
You should come.

414
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:29,834
- Ah, no can do.

415
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,333
And besides, it's not
even the library anymore.

416
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,600
So, what's the point?

417
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:34,300
- It's part of our
town's history.

418
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:36,934
We wanna repurpose it.

419
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:38,367
What about you, Maggie?

420
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,000
- I can try, yeah.

421
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:44,533
- Hey, we're hitting
the lake, so good luck.

422
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,333
Come on, Mags.
- Sure.

423
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:50,266
Bye, Josh.

424
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,266
- She's back.

425
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,000
- Whoa.

426
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:05,767
- They
haven't even built

427
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,667
the pavilion yet or the park.

428
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,900
- Okay, you're kind of
in a weird mood today,

429
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:11,767
but can we go be
weird in the lake?

430
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,266
- Yeah.
- Come on.

431
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:16,233
- Yeah, sure.

432
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,667
- Oh, there she is!

433
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,467
- Hey, oh, my god.

434
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,166
Hi, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

435
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,367
Hi.

436
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,400
- Okay, check it.

437
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,000
Derrick at 10 o'clock.

438
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:31,233
- That certainly is, yeah.

439
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:32,400
- It's purely professional.

440
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:35,033
Look, if I'm gonna be the
next Vera Wang swimwear,

441
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,567
I'm gonna need a men's line.

442
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,934
- Man, you are just exactly

443
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:40,533
the same as I
remember you being.

444
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:43,233
Sorry, today, now, now,
that I remember you being

445
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:46,233
currently the way that you are.

446
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,233
- And you're a nut job.

447
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:51,066
- Yeah, um, I'm kinda
dealing with a lot.

448
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,433
- Ugh, yeah, I know.

449
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:53,567
I'm dealing with
this best friend

450
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,433
who's being a total buzzkill.

451
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:59,166
Mags, I'm gonna need
you to just chill out,

452
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,767
and go with the flow
this summer, okay?

453
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,200
- Yeah, that's...

454
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:06,467
Yeah.
- Exactly.

455
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,667
Like I'm not even
gonna think about

456
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,967
being an adult until September.

457
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,133
- Okay.
- Okay, I have an idea.

458
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:15,166
Come on.
- Okay, whoa.

459
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,667
- Woo hoo!

460
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,433
Kappas forever!

461
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,467
- Kappas forever.

462
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,667
- Kappas forever.

463
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,633
No, no, no, no.

464
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,233
- Um, I guess have fun
at the club tomorrow.

465
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:51,533
- Oh, yeah, I get to be
my dad's golf partner.

466
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,033
I hate it when
he's between wives.

467
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:55,066
Oh.

468
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,133
- I, I will, I'll see ya.

469
00:19:58,567 --> 00:19:59,900
- Yeah.

470
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,600
- Hey, you know what?

471
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,467
I um, I had fun today.

472
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:10,600
This was a whole day and
all I did was have fun.

473
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:12,533
- Well, there's more
where that came from.

474
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:15,767
See ya later.

475
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:22,133
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

476
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:23,266
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad,
Dad, what are you doing?

477
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,934
- Just hanging some lights.

478
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:25,967
I'm trying to
dress this place up

479
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,400
before the party next week.

480
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:28,233
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

481
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:29,166
This is too old.

482
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,600
It is shaky, you
need to throw it out.

483
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:31,934
- Don't be ridiculous.

484
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,200
You don't throw something away

485
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,734
just because it's
a little shaky.

486
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,133
Fine.
- Thank you.

487
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,633
Hi.

488
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:56,266
- Speak, what brings
you to the realm of Ash?

489
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,266
- Oh, I remember this.

490
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,600
Okay, so-

491
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:01,133
- No, don't mix those up.

492
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:02,500
Don't mix those up.
- I'm not mixing them up,

493
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:04,133
you dork, I'm sitting down.

494
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:05,200
- Well you're touching them.

495
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,500
Don't don't them.
- I'm not touching your stuff.

496
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:09,000
Relax, okay, this is important.

497
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:10,467
Something's going on with me

498
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,266
and I don't think Mom
and Dad would understand.

499
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,834
- Hm sounds ominous.

500
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:14,000
I'll pass.

501
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:15,667
- I'm going to
tell you something.

502
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,000
And you are probably going
to think that I am crazy.

503
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,800
- Er, you're crazier.

504
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,433
- Duly noted.
- Mm hm.

505
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:28,033
- Okay, , yesterday
I was 37 years old.

506
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,367
I lived in Chicago
with my husband.

507
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,433
I was a lawyer at a
prestige law firm.

508
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:33,667
I was about to make
a junior partner,

509
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,767
and this morning I woke up
and it was 15 years earlier.

510
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,133
At first I thought that
maybe it was a dream,

511
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,467
but my dreams are
never this linear,

512
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:48,433
and they usually involve Sonia
Sotomayor, so she's not here.

513
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:49,233
Um, say something.

514
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:55,033
- Are you outta your mind?
- Maybe.

515
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,667
- Okay, why should
I think you're doing

516
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,500
anything besides
yanking my chain?

517
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:01,567
Okay, fine, tell me something
from the future then.

518
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,567
Yeah, go ahead.

519
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,900
- Um .

520
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,400
Oh, oh, oh, so those books.

521
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,667
That book series that you
like with the dragons.

522
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,633
- Mm hm.
- They make it

523
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:10,567
into an epic series,
everybody loves it.

524
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,567
It's all anybody
talks about for ages,

525
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,667
especially at the end when
like nobody thinks that Arya's-

526
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,166
- Stop!

527
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,700
Don't say anymore.

528
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:19,767
- Okay.

529
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:22,233
- Okay, okay, okay.

530
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,734
I'm not saying that believe you.

531
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:26,667
Okay, I'm not.

532
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,567
But if I did, I do happen to
have a time traveling theory.

533
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,000
A couple months ago I
was having an argument

534
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:33,934
with some of my guys
in my DND group, right?

535
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:35,066
- Department of Defense?

536
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,000
- What? No.

537
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:37,433
Dungeons and Dragons.

538
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:40,266
- Okay super nerd.

539
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,600
- Oh, I'm sorry, did I
just walk into your lair

540
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:44,400
and claim to be a time traveler?

541
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:45,166
- That's a good point.

542
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,233
I may have lost the high ground.

543
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:48,400
- We were arguing about
time nomads, right?

544
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,533
- That sounds like
a comic book, yes.

545
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:52,934
- It's a graphic novel, okay?

546
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:54,000
Can you please take
this seriously?

547
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:56,400
- Yep.
- All right, thanks.

548
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:58,266
Anyways, there are
articles out there.

549
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,266
A couple by actual
neuroscientists.

550
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,333
They have case studies of people

551
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:03,834
who have claimed to have
slipped back in time.

552
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,967
They theorize there was
some kinda mutation inside

553
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,300
their brains that is
triggered by stress.

554
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:10,734
The article describes
it as amnesia,

555
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,834
but instead of people
forgetting who they are,

556
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:14,467
in these rare individuals,

557
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,667
they seem to have
forgotten when they are.

558
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:22,166
- I mean, that could be me.
- Yeah.

559
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,533
- I am stressed.

560
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:27,333
What is that anyway?

561
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:28,600
- Oh, this?

562
00:23:28,734 --> 00:23:29,900
This is my prized possession.

563
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,266
I've been working
on it for six weeks.

564
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,467
Sweet, huh?
- That's a long time.

565
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,133
- Yeah.
- Can I see it?

566
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:39,967
- Um, yeah, just be
very careful, okay?

567
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,166
- I'm a grown up.

568
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,967
- Hm, okay.

569
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,133
- So, like...

570
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:47,967
- Not yet.

571
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,934
- Hey, you know what?

572
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:49,867
I got some upstairs stuff to do,

573
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,467
so I'm just gonna
leave you with that.

574
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,300
Thank you so much
for all of your help.

575
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,166
Good bye.

576
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,367
A time nomad.

577
00:24:04,266 --> 00:24:07,467
Okay, well, if that's
true, I should just,

578
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,667
I should just be
able to remember.

579
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,533
Right?

580
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,734
Okay.

581
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,533
I am 37 years old and
I am gonna wake up

582
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:26,834
in Chicago with my husband.

583
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,300
Ugh.

584
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:41,000
No, come on.

585
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:43,200
37, Chicago, husband, go.

586
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,500
Fine.

587
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:51,734
Hello?

588
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,367
- Well, I'm heading
off for a fun day at the club.

589
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,433
Dad and I are playing golf,

590
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:57,066
so there will be lots of
criticism on my swing.

591
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,433
Yay.

592
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:01,400
I just wanted to hear your voice

593
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,767
so I'd have something
to be happy about.

594
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,033
- Aw, well that's really sweet.

595
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,400
Hey, I'm rooting for you today.

596
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:10,700
Do good, uh, do you
know, good golf.

597
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:12,133
- Thanks.

598
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:15,734
Have I told you that I'm
just crazy about you?

599
00:25:15,867 --> 00:25:18,533
- I think you just did it.

600
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:19,400
Bye.
- Bye.

601
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:23,834
- Hey.
- Hi.

602
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:28,767
- Where's Mom and Dad?

603
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,567
- Errands stuff.
- Hm.

604
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,533
You're staring.

605
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:38,600
- Were you goofing
on me last night?

606
00:25:38,734 --> 00:25:40,200
Are you gonna tell me
you're an alien today?

607
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:41,500
Or what's new?
- Nope.

608
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:46,266
Still just your run of the
mill regular old time traveler.

609
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,100
- So you still remember being 37

610
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:50,767
and you're married
to some Chicago dude?

611
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,266
- Oh, no, not some Chicago dude.

612
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,133
I married Josh Turner.

613
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:57,767
- Your dorky friend
from high school?

614
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,734
The guy you were on the
academic decathlon team with?

615
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:01,967
- Yeah, Josh.
- Oh, my gosh.

616
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,967
- After he couldn't save the
library from being demolished

617
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,834
I felt really bad for him and
we started hanging out more.

618
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:09,834
And we fell
for each other.

619
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:11,367
I guess that's how it started.

620
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,700
- Yeah, for you maybe.

621
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:13,867
- What's that supposed to mean?

622
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,333
- That guy's like-liked you
since he was a freshman.

623
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:19,333
- What, okay, how, how
did I not pick up on this?

624
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:21,200
Can you come to his save
the library rally with me?

625
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,700
I'm starting to feel like
I need to get closure

626
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:24,500
on a whole relationship
that hasn't even happened.

627
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:26,633
- I don't even wanna
know what that means.

628
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,667
- It's just in the
future it seems like

629
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,767
we're such different people.

630
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,834
I feel like a bad
guy all the time,

631
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,967
and he just seems so defeated.

632
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,600
And well, not now, he will be.

633
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:39,633
And I just, I feel like
the library is the key.

634
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:42,100
If I help Josh save the
library, then he'll be fine.

635
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:45,166
And he can go down whatever
path makes him happy,

636
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,166
and Rick and I can go
on like we should be.

637
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,834
Like we should have been...

638
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:52,867
I don't, I don't know.

639
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
- Wow, I was hoping
you'd tell me the future

640
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:56,867
is filled with flying cars.

641
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,600
Who knew it would just be
you and your boring drama.

642
00:26:59,734 --> 00:27:00,600
Yeah, I'm good.

643
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:01,834
Thanks.
- Come on.

644
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,567
Your classmates
are gonna be there.

645
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,700
Cheerleaders are gonna be there.

646
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:07,900
Mom says you like one.
- What? No.

647
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:08,834
No, I don't, okay you know what?

648
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:10,367
That's none of your
business actually.

649
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,133
Mom shouldn't be
telling you that.

650
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:12,500
- Not my, but I'm your sister.

651
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:13,500
I'm allowed to know
stuff about you.

652
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:14,567
Come on.

653
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,000
- Okay, fine.

654
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,500
But I'm only going
in case you do

655
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:19,767
any weird time traveling stuff.

656
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,400
I wanna see that.
- Yeah, totally.

657
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:26,700
- Hey, um, what am I like?

658
00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:28,033
- You're like a
big, huge dork, duh.

659
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:31,834
- No, no, I mean in the future.

660
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:36,500
I'm not gonna be you
know, like this forever.

661
00:27:36,633 --> 00:27:37,934
Am I?
- Oh, honey.

662
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:42,000
Hey, you know what?

663
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:45,734
In the future, you're like,
you're kind of amazing.

664
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:46,834
- Yeah, sure.
- No, you are, trust me.

665
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:50,200
You're this like big
genius software developer.

666
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,367
Apps.

667
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,567
- Those stupid
little phone games?

668
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,500
- Okay, but in the future
there's an app for everything.

669
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,100
'Cause right now, phones
are just getting started.

670
00:27:57,233 --> 00:27:58,600
But just, just trust me.

671
00:27:58,734 --> 00:28:00,834
Remember apps, boom!

672
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:02,967
They explode, huge.

673
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,333
Dad brags about
you all the time.

674
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:05,266
- No way.

675
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,734
Your dad brags about me?
- Yeah, he does.

676
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:10,567
He talks about your confidence.

677
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,600
Be ready in an hour or I
will leave without you.

678
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:28,867
I've never noticed that at all.

679
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,500
- No?
- Hi.

680
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:31,367
- Hi.

681
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:33,900
- Hi.
- Hi.

682
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:35,600
- I already said that.
- Yeah.

683
00:28:35,734 --> 00:28:37,367
- I just, I wasn't sure
if you'd show up or not,

684
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,300
so hi.
- Hi.

685
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,133
Yeah, I'm sorry we're late.

686
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:44,834
My timing lately has
been a little uh,

687
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:47,567
it's been a little weird.
- True story, bro.

688
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,533
- How's it going, Ash?

689
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:50,400
- Well, I'm at a save
the library rally,

690
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:52,066
so I'm livin', man.

691
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:55,900
- Thanks anyway.
- No problem.

692
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:56,867
- Really sorry about him.

693
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,567
Um, how can we help?

694
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,333
What's the plan?
- Uh, well,

695
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:01,967
we got a bunch of
high school kids.

696
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,467
The cheerleaders are
over there making signs.

697
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,667
There's another group
trying to paint the signs.

698
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,300
So far it's been a
lot like herding cats.

699
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:09,400
- Well, you know what?

700
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:10,633
It is your lucky day
because Ash is really great

701
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:12,867
at making signs-
- Painting.

702
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,166
Making signs.

703
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:18,133
- You're doing a good job.

704
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:19,767
Okay, go.

705
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,834
- Um, yeah, there's girls.
- Mm hm.

706
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:24,266
- And they're
cheerleaders.

707
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,467
- Remember what Dad said.

708
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,133
Confidence.

709
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,333
- Okay, you're right.
- I believe in you.

710
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:34,333
- Have fun.
- Thanks, man.

711
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:37,300
- He'll be fine.

712
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:38,633
- Wow, this is awesome.

713
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,100
Do you need help?

714
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,300
- Bulldozers come in two days.

715
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:47,500
- Tearing it down is not
gonna be an improvement.

716
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:49,967
- I know, right?

717
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,967
I mean, sure it's old
and needs repairs,

718
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,667
but this is part of
our town's history.

719
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,900
Part of our country's history.

720
00:29:57,033 --> 00:29:59,600
Benjamin Franklin started the
first lending library in 1731.

721
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:02,000
Did you know that?
- No.

722
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,166
- We got to where we are
today because libraries

723
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,133
like this offer education for
everyone, not just the rich.

724
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:09,633
It's places like this
that make America

725
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,934
truly the land of the free.

726
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:15,400
What?

727
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:16,834
You're staring at me.

728
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:18,000
Is something on my face or?
- No, I'm not.

729
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:20,900
I'm not, I'm really not.

730
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:21,900
Okay, I was a little bit.

731
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:23,667
Sorry, I just...

732
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,767
You're just different.

733
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,834
I haven't seen you this
passionate in a while.

734
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:29,834
- You haven't seen
me in a while.

735
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:31,633
- Sort of, yeah.

736
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:32,500
Kinda.

737
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,633
So, okay, bear with me.

738
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:36,867
I get it, libraries
are important,

739
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,934
but they built a new one on
Parkside and they've already

740
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:43,467
moved all the books over, so
what's this really about, Josh?

741
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,467
- Some of my earliest memories

742
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,767
are my mom bringing
me to story time.

743
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,066
She loved books and this
place in particular.

744
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,633
Growing up spending
so many hours here,

745
00:30:57,767 --> 00:31:02,066
after she died I guess I liked
to go and sit in her favorite

746
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,400
spot in the reading room
just to feel closer to her.

747
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:09,533
- How could I not know that?

748
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,200
- Why would you know that?

749
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,200
- No reason.

750
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,333
- Hey, we have a bunch
of water and snacks.

751
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:16,667
Where do you want them?

752
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,033
- Uh, listen, how about
you deal with that,

753
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:20,200
and I'll go motivate
the sign painting crew.

754
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:21,800
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

755
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:28,867
Sounds like they're ready.

756
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,333
- Why are the cops here?

757
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:34,900
I have a permit for this.

758
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:37,367
- It's okay, I got it.

759
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,567
- Yeah, you really got it.

760
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,867
Thanks for bailing
me out, Mr. H,

761
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,100
but you really didn't need to.

762
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:46,066
My dad, he'd come pick me up
as soon as he got off work.

763
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
- Nah, I figure you're
good for the 50 bucks.

764
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:49,200
We'll drop you at your house,

765
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:50,867
but don't even think
about skipping town.

766
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,467
- We will find you.

767
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,400
- Don't worry about my parents.

768
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:55,567
They're harmless.

769
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,867
Oh, you're not.

770
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,700
Come on, what are
you doing here?

771
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,200
- Are you kidding me?

772
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,033
I'm here to witness the
utter demise of my saintly,

773
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:02,133
perfect, straight-A,

774
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:03,133
favorite child sister.

775
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:04,767
I wouldn't miss this
if you threatened me

776
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,233
with the Hydralon
Seven torture pod.

777
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:07,433
- Okay, smart guy.

778
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:10,100
First of all, I do not
consider this my utter demise.

779
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:12,967
Second of all, there's
no way I'm the favorite.

780
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,066
- Quit sniping, you two.

781
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,533
You know your father and
I don't have favorites.

782
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:18,200
You're my favorite.

783
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:19,367
- I'm standing right here.

784
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,433
- Excuse me if I'm a little
bias toward the offspring

785
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:23,767
who will not be spending
time in front of a judge.

786
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,066
- That's not gonna age well.

787
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,266
- Besides, honey, I'm sure you
are your father's favorite.

788
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,266
- I hate to break it
to you, buttercup,

789
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,333
but I just wanted a dog.

790
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:32,367
If your mother wasn't allergic

791
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,433
both of you kids would
be cocker spaniels.

792
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:35,266
Who's a good boy?

793
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,233
Who's a good boy?

794
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:38,734
That's my little puppy.

795
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:40,100
- Oh, Mom, I can help
clear if you want.

796
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:40,967
- Oh, no, honey, you relax.

797
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,100
You must be exhausted.
- From jail.

798
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:45,533
- We're getting a lotta
mileage outta this one.

799
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,133
- For at least a
couple more days, yeah.

800
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:48,800
- Mm hm, got you.

801
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:50,433
- Hey, it's our song.

802
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:51,934
- Aw!
- Come on, come on.

803
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:53,133
You have to.

804
00:32:53,266 --> 00:32:56,100
We must dance.

805
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,333
- No.

806
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,500
- Honey, if we don't stop
you won't get dessert.

807
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:11,800
- I have everything
sweet I need right here.

808
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:12,600
- I'm gonna throw up.

809
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:13,567
Can you please just get a room?

810
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,333
- I did, a bunch of 'em.

811
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:18,600
So as long as I'm paying
the mortgage here,

812
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:20,367
I'll dance with my wife.

813
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,633
- Nope, still happening.

814
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:46,100
- I just don't feel good about
you going in there alone.

815
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,000
- I'm not alone, Mom.

816
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:48,367
I have you guys.

817
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,934
- We should've called
your dad's friend.

818
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:51,133
What's his name?

819
00:33:51,266 --> 00:33:51,934
Helped us with
the room addition.

820
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:52,834
- Yeah, Sid Lawrence.

821
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:53,667
Smart fella.

822
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,934
He works close by.

823
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,367
We could get him
here pretty quick.

824
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,667
- Daddy, I love you, your
friend is a paralegal,

825
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,300
and this is just a
preliminary hearing.

826
00:33:59,433 --> 00:34:00,300
Josh and I will be fine.

827
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:02,000
- I just don't want
you to do anything

828
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:03,233
that's gonna get you in trouble.

829
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:04,667
- But don't worry
if anything happens,

830
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,834
we'll visit you in prison.

831
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:07,400
- Prison.

832
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:08,867
- Boys, this is serious.

833
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
- I am serious.
- Okay, family, family.

834
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:11,867
Hi, focus.

835
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:14,400
I've got this, okay?

836
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:16,600
- Just don't push it.

837
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:18,433
You're not a lawyer yet.

838
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:20,200
- Sure.

839
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,066
Come on.

840
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,900
- In the case of Maggie
Hartman and Josh Turner,

841
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:29,066
do you have representation?

842
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,066
- Your Honor, I'll be
acting as my own attorney.

843
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,266
- Oh, boy, here we go.

844
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,567
- I would also like to speak
on behalf of Mr. Turner.

845
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,567
- Could we have a moment please?

846
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,867
- Why not?

847
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,100
I doubt any of us wants to get
out of here at decent hour.

848
00:34:41,233 --> 00:34:42,567
- Ah, thank you, Your Honor.

849
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,667
What do you think you're doing?

850
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,600
I thought we just plead guilty

851
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:46,066
and do community
service or something?

852
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,066
- No, we don't wanna do that.

853
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,333
I've got this.

854
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:49,400
- That's what you
said yesterday.

855
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:51,200
- Okay, I can understand
your skepticism, Josh.

856
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:52,533
I need you to trust me.

857
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:53,667
Can you do that?

858
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,900
- Mr. Turner, do you suppose
we will be continuing

859
00:34:57,033 --> 00:34:59,567
with these proceedings
anytime soon?

860
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,166
- I also would like Miss
Hartman to represent me.

861
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,467
- Very well.

862
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,900
What do you have to
say for yourselves?

863
00:35:08,033 --> 00:35:09,500
- Your Honor,
we are being charged with

864
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:11,633
the incitement of civil
disorder, is that right?

865
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:13,133
- You are correct, young lady.

866
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:15,967
- So, the definition of
this infraction is willfully

867
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,333
causing or creating
an impediment with
the sole intention

868
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:21,100
of interfering with a
law enforcement officer

869
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:22,266
carrying out their
official duties.

870
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,533
Is that right?

871
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:24,734
- Well, at least you've done
your research on the charges,

872
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:28,834
which is more than 90% of
people who represent themselves.

873
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:31,233
But Miss Hartman,
do you have a point

874
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:33,000
that actually
addresses this charge?

875
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:34,633
- I do, Your Honor,
submitted into evidence

876
00:35:34,767 --> 00:35:37,433
is the authorized permit for
the rally at the library.

877
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:38,667
- I see, and?

878
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,767
- Well, given that the permit
for the rally is valid,

879
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,600
the issue of underlying
cause is absent.

880
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:48,600
Therefore, as issued in the
State of Illinois versus Camden,

881
00:35:48,734 --> 00:35:50,300
the lack of underlying
causes renders

882
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:52,100
the subsequent arrest invalid.

883
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,834
I move that this case be
dismissed with prejudice.

884
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:58,600
- Hm, well, this
certainly took a turn.

885
00:35:58,734 --> 00:36:01,333
Illinois versus Camden you say?

886
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:03,467
Good reference.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

887
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,033
- Underlying cause is
quite relevant here.

888
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:08,567
With that in mind, I'm
going to rule in your favor.

889
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,300
This case is dismissed
with prejudice,

890
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:11,800
and the arrests
shall be stricken.

891
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:13,367
- Thank you, Your Honor.

892
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,166
Um, Your Honor, while I
have the court's attention,

893
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,200
I would like to beg a moment
of your indulgence if I may.

894
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:25,900
- Oh, dear.

895
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:27,133
there is an issue
of grave importance

896
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:28,800
that I'd like to discuss.

897
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:30,200
- Hm, this afternoon
is turning out

898
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,166
much differently than expected.

899
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,367
- Thank you, Your Honor.

900
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,166
We believe that
the very character

901
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,533
of this town can be
found in the old library.

902
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:42,033
Yes, the plaster is
cracked, the paint is faded,

903
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,033
but there's a good foundation.

904
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,800
And the library is important
not only to the history

905
00:36:45,934 --> 00:36:48,467
of our town, but to
each of us individually.

906
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,834
And currently, bulldozers are
set to destroy this building.

907
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:52,367
Now, I have here
paperwork to file

908
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,200
a temporary restraining
order against the demolition

909
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:56,500
of the library at
Main and Grand.

910
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:59,100
May I approach?
- You may do so.

911
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:04,600
You know as a child,
that library was where

912
00:37:04,734 --> 00:37:06,133
I learned to read.

913
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:11,400
I have to admit it's
not often I'm surprised,

914
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:14,233
but you, Miss Hartman,
have done just that.

915
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:17,633
All your T's are crossed
and your I's are dotted.

916
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:18,700
Very well.

917
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:20,967
Unless evidence to the
contrary is presented

918
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,934
as to why demolition of
the library is imperative,

919
00:37:24,066 --> 00:37:27,533
a temporary restraining
order is granted for 14 days.

920
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:33,400
- Thank you, Your Honor.

921
00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:34,333
- Where did that come from?

922
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:37,100
- I uh, I watch a
lot of Law and Order.

923
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:39,367
- You must.

924
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,100
- That was my daughter.

925
00:37:42,233 --> 00:37:43,433
- Hi.

926
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:45,133
- She did it!

927
00:37:45,266 --> 00:37:48,100
She saved the library.

928
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,066
- Hey, buddy, back off the girl.

929
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
It's bad enough you
got her arrested.

930
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,633
- Okay, wow, wow.

931
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:57,100
First of all, the girl, hi.

932
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,266
Second, Josh didn't
get me arrested.

933
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,734
It was the other way around.

934
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:01,667
- I don't think that
matters to my father.

935
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,300
I had to spend the better
part of my morning explaining

936
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:04,767
why I'm dating a jailbird.

937
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,367
- A jail, sheesh.

938
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,667
A jailbird, seriously?

939
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,333
- You can explain it to him.

940
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:10,633
He has requested
that you join us

941
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:12,266
for dinner tonight at the club.

942
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,467
- Your dad did?
- Yeah.

943
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,467
- Wow, okay, yeah.

944
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,000
- Let's go.
- Sure.

945
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,133
- It won't be so bad.

946
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:24,266
I'll see you tonight.
- Okay, bye.

947
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,500
- Objection, overruled!
- Oh, hi.

948
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,333
Hi, you.

949
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:30,834
- Oh, you were a boss out there.

950
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:36,667
Okay, so, your friend
Josh, he's a cutie.

951
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,667
I was thinking about
asking him out.

952
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,667
What do you think?

953
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,967
- Yeah, you know what?

954
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,867
He is great and you're great,
so that would be, that's...

955
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:49,333
Why wouldn't that be great?

956
00:38:49,467 --> 00:38:50,400
- Awesome possum.

957
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:52,133
Okay, I'm gonna see if
I can catch up with him.

958
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:54,867
- Okay.

959
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,333
- You getting in or are we
camping in the parking lot?

960
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:59,633
- I mean, honestly, Dad, at
this point I'd take either one.

961
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:02,066
- Right?

962
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:14,066
- So, what's this
nonsense I hear

963
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,600
about my son's girlfriend
getting arrested?

964
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:17,934
- Oh, that, yes.

965
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:20,066
Well, um, the case
has been dismissed

966
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,000
and the arrest has
been expunged, so it's-

967
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,400
- Expunged?
- It's expunged.

968
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:26,400
- This is how you kids
are talking these days?

969
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:28,066
- Oh, .

970
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,500
No, I just meant that
it's been totally like,

971
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:33,433
like, like wiped
from the record, so.

972
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:35,200
- Okay, well that's
fine and good.

973
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,033
But why were you even
there in the first place?

974
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,033
- Oh, I was helping a friend.

975
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,600
He's trying to save the library.

976
00:39:39,734 --> 00:39:40,700
- Why?

977
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:41,900
I personally donated money

978
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:43,900
to the new library
out in Parkside.

979
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:45,667
It's much better, trust me.

980
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,967
- Well, you know, just
because there's a new library

981
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,900
doesn't mean we have to let
developers bulldoze the old one.

982
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:51,066
- Oh boy.
- When did developers

983
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,567
become a dirty word?

984
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,700
This country was
built by developers.

985
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:57,367
- Okay, nobody's saying
developers are evil, Dad.

986
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,066
So, can we please save
the lecture about how

987
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,533
the first vehicles on the
road to progress were...

988
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,066
Okay.
- Michael Williams is trying

989
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,900
to turn that property
into something useful.

990
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:07,567
And he's a friend.
- Is he?

991
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,567
Is he a friend that
you do business with?

992
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,500
I'm just curious.

993
00:40:10,633 --> 00:40:13,767
- Yes, I plan to
invest in the project.

994
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,900
And do you know how
much tax revenue

995
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:18,033
this new development
will bring into the city?

996
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,400
In addition to a community
center for at risk youth.

997
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:24,567
Housing for low income seniors.

998
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,200
- What Maggie came here to
say is that it was a mistake

999
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,066
being there and she's sorry.

1000
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,433
- No, no, it's not.

1001
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:31,900
The situation was blown
out of proportion.

1002
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:33,066
It was not a
mistake to be there.

1003
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,667
And I am not sorry.

1004
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,100
- But she's never done
this sorta thing before,

1005
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:39,567
so let's just cut
her some slack.

1006
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,734
- Some slack he says.

1007
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:43,533
I never needed slack.

1008
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:47,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1009
00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:50,400
- Looks great, mm.

1010
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:53,767
- Well, I'm so sorry to have
caused problems for you.

1011
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,567
I would at very least like to
hear more about the project.

1012
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,300
- Okay then.

1013
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:04,967
Maybe this girlfriend of yours
has some sense after all.

1014
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:07,033
Dig in.

1015
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:15,700
- Are you okay?

1016
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:17,400
- I just wanna make so
much money that I never

1017
00:41:17,533 --> 00:41:21,133
have to hear one of his
condescending lectures again.

1018
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:23,000
- Hey, you will, okay?

1019
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:29,133
I know that you will.

1020
00:41:29,266 --> 00:41:31,467
- I'm glad at least
you believe in me.

1021
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,266
Thank you for that.

1022
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,633
Promise me you won't let
me turn into him, okay?

1023
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:39,333
- Yeah, I promise.

1024
00:41:47,433 --> 00:41:49,166
Hey.
- Oh, hey, honey.

1025
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,667
- What you doing?

1026
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,433
- Just looking at
pictures for the party.

1027
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:55,100
Oh, will you look at that.

1028
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:58,266
Were you old enough to remember?

1029
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,133
That summer your father grew
that handlebar mustache.

1030
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:02,633
- Seriously?
- Ugh.

1031
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:03,433
- Wow.

1032
00:42:04,533 --> 00:42:05,700
- Aw, there it is.

1033
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:07,400
That is where your
father proposed.

1034
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:08,967
- Huh.

1035
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,400
How did you know that he
was the one do you think?

1036
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:14,400
- Oh, I don't know if he is.

1037
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:15,567
- What do you mean,
what does that mean?

1038
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,533
Are you guys having problems?

1039
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,333
- No, honey, no, it's
nothing like that.

1040
00:42:18,467 --> 00:42:19,367
- Okay.
- No.

1041
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:23,200
I adore your father.

1042
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:25,967
And he had better
say the same for me.

1043
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,567
But I think this notion of the
one does people a disservice.

1044
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,834
It gives folks the idea
that all you have to do

1045
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,800
is meet the one and then
it's smooth sailing forever.

1046
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:40,500
People buy into that and
then when things get rough,

1047
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:43,133
and there's always a point
when things get rough.

1048
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:44,533
It makes it too easy to bail

1049
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:47,567
and look for the
one somewhere else.

1050
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:53,533
- How did you two get together?

1051
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:57,633
- Well, when I was your age
there were several young men

1052
00:42:57,767 --> 00:42:59,834
vying for my attention.

1053
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,900
All of them were very nice.

1054
00:43:02,033 --> 00:43:04,767
I think any one of them
coulda been the one.

1055
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,767
Although, your father did
check off a lotta boxes for me.

1056
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:14,433
He was handsome and bright
and always good for a laugh.

1057
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:16,133
But I didn't go into the
relationship thinking,

1058
00:43:16,266 --> 00:43:19,266
"oh, he's definitely the one."

1059
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,600
Because I think that
love is a choice.

1060
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:27,133
It's a choice we make
on a continual basis.

1061
00:43:30,834 --> 00:43:32,200
Hey, is everything okay?

1062
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:33,633
- Mm hm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1063
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:38,100
I just, I had a bit
of a strange day.

1064
00:43:38,233 --> 00:43:39,433
I think I might go to
Flannigan's and get a piece of

1065
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:41,800
banana cream pie.
- Ooh

1066
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:42,934
- Always makes me feel better.

1067
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:44,800
Do you wanna come?

1068
00:43:44,934 --> 00:43:46,767
- No, I think I
should go through

1069
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,367
this other box of pictures.

1070
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,800
- Okay.

1071
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:51,333
- Hey, I love you.

1072
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,767
- I love you too, Mommy.

1073
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:27,433
Do you live there now?

1074
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,900
Are you wearing aftershave?

1075
00:44:32,033 --> 00:44:32,734
That's a new shirt.

1076
00:44:32,867 --> 00:44:33,600
What's going on?

1077
00:44:33,734 --> 00:44:34,667
- So, what if it is?

1078
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,100
Nicki and I are going on
a picnic this afternoon.

1079
00:44:37,233 --> 00:44:38,433
- Nicki, no, no,
no, no, no, hold on.

1080
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:41,066
I thought you were hitting it
off with um, what's her name?

1081
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,200
Veronica.
- Yeah, duh, Veronica.

1082
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,900
But her friends call her Nicki.

1083
00:44:45,033 --> 00:44:48,066
And now, I'm one of her friends.

1084
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,266
- That girl was Nicki.

1085
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,667
Oh, no, no, no,
what have I done?

1086
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,600
Hey, no, you come back.

1087
00:44:51,734 --> 00:44:52,400
I have questions.

1088
00:44:52,533 --> 00:44:53,567
No fancy towel stuff.
- Mm mm.

1089
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,400
- Come back, come back here.

1090
00:44:54,533 --> 00:44:55,367
Do not slam that door.

1091
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,900
I will take you back
to the brontosaur!

1092
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,567
- Kids, stop slamming the doors.

1093
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,600
I'm doing a load of whites.

1094
00:45:01,734 --> 00:45:04,400
- Nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, no.

1095
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:06,600
- Feel strongly
about laundry, do we?

1096
00:45:06,734 --> 00:45:08,900
- We can't let Ash
date this Nicki person.

1097
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:10,000
- What are you talking about?

1098
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:12,133
He's finally come out of
his shell a little bit.

1099
00:45:12,266 --> 00:45:12,967
- Mom, you don't get it.

1100
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,600
Okay, she is horrible.

1101
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:16,400
She's the girl who toys
with him all summer.

1102
00:45:16,533 --> 00:45:18,066
And then when they go back to
school she breaks up with him

1103
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,467
in front of everybody
at the Homecoming Dance.

1104
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,834
It destroys him.

1105
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:21,967
He never recovers.

1106
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,600
- Someone's a negative Nancy.

1107
00:45:23,734 --> 00:45:24,800
And what's with the grammar?

1108
00:45:24,934 --> 00:45:26,734
Your tenses are
all over the place.

1109
00:45:26,867 --> 00:45:28,800
Is it too late to get
a refund on college?

1110
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:29,934
- Yes!

1111
00:45:30,066 --> 00:45:32,300
- Oh, your young man is here.

1112
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:35,133
- Rick?
- No, the other one.

1113
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:36,734
- Oh, gosh.

1114
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,300
- The game was
unbelievable last night.

1115
00:45:38,433 --> 00:45:39,567
- Don't even talk
to me about it.

1116
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,367
- I mean, we were
completely robbed.

1117
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,567
- Wait, robbed, who was robbed?

1118
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,734
What?
- The Cubs.

1119
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:45,734
But that's nothing new.

1120
00:45:45,867 --> 00:45:47,734
- Okay, hi.
- Hi.

1121
00:45:47,867 --> 00:45:49,100
- What are you doing here?

1122
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:51,300
- Oh, right, barracudas.

1123
00:45:51,433 --> 00:45:52,900
- Okay, care to expand?

1124
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:55,300
- You know how yesterday I
told you you saved the library.

1125
00:45:55,433 --> 00:45:56,467
- Yeah.
- And I was so

1126
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,433
pumped about that.
- Mm hm.

1127
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:00,300
- That might've been
a bit premature.

1128
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:01,266
This morning I got a phone call.

1129
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,300
Apparently Michael
Williams Investments-

1130
00:46:03,433 --> 00:46:04,500
- Who wants to buy the library?

1131
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:05,433
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1132
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,533
- They're teamed up
with a high octane

1133
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:07,800
law firm out of Chicago.

1134
00:46:07,934 --> 00:46:09,633
Luckman and -
- Seriously?

1135
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,200
Luckman, Reed and Baxter?

1136
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,000
- No, just Luckman, Reed.

1137
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:15,133
- Oh, of course, Baxter
wouldn't be partner yet.

1138
00:46:15,266 --> 00:46:16,133
- What?
- What?

1139
00:46:16,266 --> 00:46:16,967
- Why, have you heard of them?

1140
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,166
Is this bad news?

1141
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,200
- Uh, I think ironic is the
word that I'm looking for.

1142
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:23,900
Of course the developer
would have them on retainer.

1143
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:25,900
They're one of the best
law firms in Chicago.

1144
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,066
- That's not reassuring.

1145
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,333
I'm headed to Chicago
to meet with one

1146
00:46:30,467 --> 00:46:32,400
of the lawyers this afternoon.

1147
00:46:32,533 --> 00:46:34,467
I barely had enough
money to print fliers.

1148
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,400
I certainly don't have
enough to hire a lawyer.

1149
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:38,867
I'm doomed.

1150
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
- Mm, no you're not.

1151
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:45,133
You are not doomed because I
am gonna be at that meeting.

1152
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:49,400
Huh.

1153
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,133
Oh, wow.

1154
00:46:56,266 --> 00:46:58,200
You look, you look great.

1155
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:00,867
- I'm sorry?
- Your suit is lovely.

1156
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,033
It's a great, it's a great suit.

1157
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:04,400
Good afternoon.

1158
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:05,767
- Good afternoon.

1159
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,233
I'm Malcolm Baxter,
senior counsel

1160
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:09,066
for Michael Williams
Investments.

1161
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,266
- Hi, I'm Maggie Turn...

1162
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,066
Maggie Hartman is
me, is my name,

1163
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,967
and this is Josh Turner.

1164
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,433
- Well, I'm gonna get
right down to business.

1165
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:17,600
My client has put
considerable time

1166
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,266
and effort into the
property at Main and Grand.

1167
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,633
Now, we understand that
you might have some

1168
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:24,100
emotional attachment to
the existing structure.

1169
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:29,133
So, we are prepared to offer
you a stipend for your trouble.

1170
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,066
Take your time.

1171
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:45,400
- Okay, rule number one
of settling out of court,

1172
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:49,033
you throw money at it
and see if it goes away.

1173
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,567
- Are you kids trying
to play hardball?

1174
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,333
That is cute.

1175
00:47:57,467 --> 00:47:59,700
I have to admit, that is cute.

1176
00:47:59,834 --> 00:48:01,834
But I'm sure you can think
of more enjoyable ways

1177
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:04,333
to spend your summer, so.

1178
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:06,133
Maybe this will help.

1179
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:14,400
- Why is he doing
it like that again?

1180
00:48:14,533 --> 00:48:17,967
- I don't know, it's
just such a long table.

1181
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:18,967
I, we got your point,

1182
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,767
just thank you so much.
- Take your time.

1183
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,333
- Yeah, you
definitely took yours.

1184
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,800
Okay, rule number two, if a
little money doesn't work,

1185
00:48:25,934 --> 00:48:27,166
you throw a lotta money at it.

1186
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,266
- That would buy a lotta books.

1187
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,033
Never have to go
to a library again.

1188
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:33,700
- Mr. Baxter, that's
not why I'm doing this.

1189
00:48:33,834 --> 00:48:34,967
There are more
important issues here.

1190
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:37,667
- You have issues?
- Yes!

1191
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,133
I have issues with your client

1192
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:40,767
disregarding
heritage and history.

1193
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,166
- Right, because anytime someone
wants to develop a property

1194
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,834
people start throwing
around the word history.

1195
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:46,767
Listen, I'm gonna write
another number down-

1196
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,266
- No, no, you're not listening.

1197
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,467
Do you know anything
about this building

1198
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,667
that we're trying to save?

1199
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,333
Does your client?

1200
00:48:54,467 --> 00:48:58,100
In the 1800s, after Andrew
Carnegie made his fortune,

1201
00:48:58,233 --> 00:48:58,867
he decided he wanted to make

1202
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,233
the world a more peaceful place.

1203
00:49:00,367 --> 00:49:03,033
And he knew the only way to
do that was through education.

1204
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:06,433
So he built 2,500 libraries
all over the country.

1205
00:49:06,567 --> 00:49:09,700
And this building that your
client's so anxious to tear down

1206
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:12,200
was one of the very
first ones completed.

1207
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:14,066
And I know as strongly
as I know anything,

1208
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,266
that he had the right idea.

1209
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,266
And that idea lives
in this library.

1210
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,433
I don't think we should
tear something down

1211
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:23,867
just because it's old.

1212
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,533
I think we should leave things
better than we find them.

1213
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:33,166
I'm sure you can agree.

1214
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,033
- Do you do this a lot?

1215
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,433
Does he do this a lot?

1216
00:49:35,567 --> 00:49:37,233
Listen, I have
dinner reservations.

1217
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:40,700
And the minute I walk out,
that offer disappears,

1218
00:49:40,834 --> 00:49:42,834
and so does your library.

1219
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:47,066
- Well, we hope you
enjoy your dinner

1220
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,734
because we will
see you in court.

1221
00:49:49,867 --> 00:49:51,066
Okay, we're storming
out now, Josh.

1222
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,233
- So, you want me to-
- Yes, please.

1223
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:55,567
- Got it.
- Thanks.

1224
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,033
You have yourself a nice day.

1225
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,400
- Miss Hartman,
might I have a word alone?

1226
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:09,934
- It's all right.
- I'll wait outside.

1227
00:50:10,066 --> 00:50:10,800
- Okay.

1228
00:50:13,066 --> 00:50:14,433
How can I help you?

1229
00:50:14,567 --> 00:50:17,066
- I think the question is
how can we help each other?

1230
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,867
After a brief consultation
with my client,

1231
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,700
I'm prepared to take the
offer we made you in there,

1232
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:23,000
and increase it by 50%.

1233
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:24,233
You'd have it in your
bank account today,

1234
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:26,900
and no one needs to know.

1235
00:50:27,033 --> 00:50:28,333
Throw in a little something
for your boyfriend.

1236
00:50:28,467 --> 00:50:32,233
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Oh, I don't care.

1237
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:36,200
- Okay, listen, as much as
I am enjoying this riveting

1238
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:37,500
little round of
divide and conquer,

1239
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:38,433
we've made it
pretty clear that we

1240
00:50:38,567 --> 00:50:39,734
are not interested in money.

1241
00:50:39,867 --> 00:50:42,066
So at this point you're starting
to look a little desperate.

1242
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,667
- Okay, what is it you want?

1243
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,200
- The library, were
you not listening?

1244
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,767
- Well, that's not
going to happen.

1245
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,266
- I mean, a judge might
disagree with you.

1246
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,600
Isn't that why you're in
here with your big numbers

1247
00:50:49,734 --> 00:50:53,000
on your little pieces of paper?

1248
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,900
- Listen, young lady, I
understand you're having fun

1249
00:50:55,033 --> 00:50:56,734
playing dress-up and
interfering with the adults who

1250
00:50:56,867 --> 00:51:01,300
are trying to do business,
but I am part of a machine.

1251
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,567
It's the kinda
machine that grinds

1252
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,934
little naive girls
like you into dust.

1253
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:07,967
So, don't mess with me
because you have no idea

1254
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,800
who you're dealing with.

1255
00:51:12,033 --> 00:51:17,467
- Actually, Mal, I know
exactly who I'm dealing with.

1256
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,567
I think the problem
is that you don't.

1257
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,967
How much do you know
about your client?

1258
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,066
Did you do your due diligence
on Michael Williams?

1259
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,567
Or were you just really fast
to cash that retainer check?

1260
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,834
Because I happen to
know more about you

1261
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,734
and your client than you
could possibly imagine.

1262
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:35,934
So, I guess the
real unknown factor

1263
00:51:36,066 --> 00:51:39,567
in this equation would be me.

1264
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,967
And there is nothing,
nothing more dangerous

1265
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,000
than an opponent you don't know.

1266
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:47,967
And you know where
I learned that from?

1267
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:48,834
From you.

1268
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,066
- Tenets that are
outlined in Kelo v. New London,

1269
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,433
and Lingle v. Chevron USA Inc.

1270
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:02,867
- Your Honor, Mr. Baxter is
misrepresenting those rulings.

1271
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,433
- If I might be
allowed to finish.

1272
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:06,767
- Miss Hartman, you will be
given your turn to present.

1273
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,133
Proceed, counselor.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1274
00:52:09,266 --> 00:52:11,734
Allowing these kids to stop
the demolition is not only

1275
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:13,734
a grave infringement
of my client's rights,

1276
00:52:13,867 --> 00:52:14,900
but it could leave the city open

1277
00:52:15,033 --> 00:52:16,934
to charges of
breach of contract.

1278
00:52:17,066 --> 00:52:18,433
Therefore, we demand
that you overturn

1279
00:52:18,567 --> 00:52:19,967
the restraining order.

1280
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,200
Thank you.

1281
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:24,066
- Miss Hartman, you have
some thoughts on this matter?

1282
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,400
- Yes, I do, Your
Honor, thank you.

1283
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:27,967
The case law that
Mr. Baxter is citing

1284
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,700
is only relevant in issues
of property ownership.

1285
00:52:30,834 --> 00:52:32,867
Now, the court should be
aware that at no point has

1286
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,433
Michael Williams Investments
purchased the library property.

1287
00:52:36,567 --> 00:52:38,300
We'd like to enter into
evidence the city's contract

1288
00:52:38,433 --> 00:52:41,266
with Michael Williams
Investments as
exhibit 4-c please.

1289
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,233
- Duly noted.

1290
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,300
- Now, a review of
this contract reveals

1291
00:52:44,433 --> 00:52:45,934
that Michael Williams
Investments entered

1292
00:52:46,066 --> 00:52:48,967
into a favorable lease
agreement with the city.

1293
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,367
In return they promised
to build a youth center

1294
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,567
and low income seniors housing,

1295
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,266
and therefore access large
city redevelopment grants.

1296
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,567
Now, those of us who oppose
the demolition of the library

1297
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,133
understand and respect the
rights of legitimate developers,

1298
00:53:00,266 --> 00:53:02,433
but we believe that Michael
Williams Investments

1299
00:53:02,567 --> 00:53:04,533
quite frankly aided and
abetted by opposing counsel

1300
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:06,500
have been deliberately
misrepresenting
their intentions.

1301
00:53:06,633 --> 00:53:07,834
- Your Honor, that
is conjecture.

1302
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,467
- He has a point, Miss Hartman.

1303
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,633
Can you back this up?

1304
00:53:10,767 --> 00:53:12,500
- Well, we've noted in the
contract where the city

1305
00:53:12,633 --> 00:53:14,967
is provided a good faith
deposit with the company.

1306
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,600
However, the majority of
the construction grants

1307
00:53:16,734 --> 00:53:18,166
won't be made available
until after Williams

1308
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,266
carries out the demolition.

1309
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,800
This is why they're
following through on this.

1310
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:22,667
Michael Williams
has no intention

1311
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,000
of delivering on his contact.

1312
00:53:24,133 --> 00:53:25,233
He's just desperate
for a payout.

1313
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:28,166
- That is not only rank
conjecture, but also slander.

1314
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,767
- Miss Hartman,
do you have proof?

1315
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,367
- I do not at this
moment, Your Honor.

1316
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,700
If I had some more time
I would probably be-

1317
00:53:33,834 --> 00:53:35,967
- Time, time.

1318
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,934
Your Honor, every day
these people delay

1319
00:53:38,066 --> 00:53:39,834
inflicts financial
hardship upon my client.

1320
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,433
We strongly urge you
to overturn the stay.

1321
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:44,166
- Understood.

1322
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,834
Is there anything else
before I make my ruling?

1323
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,633
- No, Your Honor.

1324
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,800
- The weight of the law
leans heavily towards

1325
00:53:53,934 --> 00:53:57,033
the validity of legally
binding contracts.

1326
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:59,467
Lacking any new and
significant information

1327
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,734
as to why Michael Williams
Investment should not

1328
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:04,233
be allowed to fulfill
this contract,

1329
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:05,700
I'm afraid I have
to rule in favor of

1330
00:54:05,834 --> 00:54:08,066
Michael Williams Investments.

1331
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,233
Your order barring demolition
of the library is overturned.

1332
00:54:11,367 --> 00:54:12,433
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1333
00:54:12,567 --> 00:54:16,233
We expect demolition to start
within the next few days.

1334
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:19,166
- I was supposed to fix this.

1335
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,600
I was supposed to make
sure it would be okay.

1336
00:54:20,734 --> 00:54:22,767
I was supposed to make sure
that you would be okay.

1337
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,300
- Hey, you did the
best that anyone could.

1338
00:54:27,367 --> 00:54:28,100
- Thanks.

1339
00:54:33,633 --> 00:54:35,834
- Well, Miss Hartman,
A for effort.

1340
00:54:35,967 --> 00:54:37,433
Now, I do hope you're able
to find more useful ways

1341
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:43,200
of spending your time instead
of interfering with grown-ups.

1342
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,934
- Hi.

1343
00:54:51,066 --> 00:54:53,700
- Hey, I'm sorry you lost.

1344
00:54:53,834 --> 00:54:55,934
But for what's it
worth you were amazing.

1345
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:56,767
- Thank you.

1346
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,567
I just, I don't know.

1347
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,967
I can't help but feel like

1348
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,633
that should have
gone differently.

1349
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:04,734
- Hm.
- At least your dad's friend

1350
00:55:04,867 --> 00:55:07,667
will be happy, right?

1351
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,333
- Maybe, but let's
forget about all that

1352
00:55:10,467 --> 00:55:12,800
'cause I'm gonna take
you somewhere nice
for dinner tonight.

1353
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:13,967
- Okay.

1354
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:18,967
Why would they do that?

1355
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,900
You know this actually
is cheering me up.

1356
00:55:21,033 --> 00:55:22,967
- Oh, I'm glad because now
that the whole library thing

1357
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,934
is behind us, I
wanna move forward.

1358
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:27,967
- What do you mean?

1359
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,900
- Now that the case
went in my dad's favor,

1360
00:55:30,033 --> 00:55:31,567
I know he can
forgive and forget.

1361
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,166
- Sorry, what do I need
to be forgiven for?

1362
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,300
Isn't your dad an
investor in this project?

1363
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:36,800
- Not yet, he was waiting to see

1364
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:38,400
how the case would shake out.

1365
00:55:38,533 --> 00:55:39,900
Now that it's settled,
he's going for lunch

1366
00:55:40,033 --> 00:55:41,900
with Michael Williams
at the club tomorrow

1367
00:55:42,033 --> 00:55:42,900
to go over the financials

1368
00:55:43,033 --> 00:55:44,300
and finalize the investment.

1369
00:55:44,433 --> 00:55:45,967
- He really shouldn't
do that, Rick.

1370
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,500
- Look, I know you don't
like Michael Williams,

1371
00:55:48,633 --> 00:55:51,066
but it would make it
lot easier on everybody

1372
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,333
if you just got over it.

1373
00:55:53,467 --> 00:55:56,300
You making things difficult
for my dad's friends,

1374
00:55:56,433 --> 00:55:59,967
I'm sure you could see how he
would take that as an affront.

1375
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:02,200
I know your heart was
in the right place.

1376
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:03,367
You were just helping a friend.

1377
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,533
- What? No.

1378
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:06,066
And I don't want them to
demolish the library, Rick.

1379
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,800
- Yeah, but what does it matter?

1380
00:56:07,934 --> 00:56:10,667
We're meant for far greater
things than this town.

1381
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,033
And I have seen how
forceful and passionate

1382
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:14,700
you were in that courtroom.

1383
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:16,467
You have ambition.

1384
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,900
That's how I feel about the
businesses I wanna start.

1385
00:56:20,767 --> 00:56:23,133
We're gonna go places.

1386
00:56:23,266 --> 00:56:24,867
So, what does it matter
if there is or isn't

1387
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,500
an old library in a town that
we're gonna leave behind?

1388
00:56:32,166 --> 00:56:36,633
- Because we should leave places
better than we found them.

1389
00:56:36,767 --> 00:56:38,567
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1390
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,633
Well, talking about better,
I wanna talk about us.

1391
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:46,734
- What about us?

1392
00:56:46,867 --> 00:56:50,867
- The term power couple,
that could describe us.

1393
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,900
Wouldn't that be something
you're interested in?

1394
00:56:54,033 --> 00:56:55,233
Well, I have been
thinking about it since

1395
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:57,867
we first started
dating freshman year.

1396
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,934
And three and a half years
later, I am even more impressed

1397
00:57:02,066 --> 00:57:03,800
and more in love
with you than ever.

1398
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,633
Maggie Hartman, would you
conquer the world with me?

1399
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:21,266
- Yeah, okay.

1400
00:57:23,734 --> 00:57:26,400
Yeah .

1401
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,800
Oh my gosh.

1402
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:37,567
Cheers.

1403
00:57:40,033 --> 00:57:41,900
Dad.
- I'm just texting Ash

1404
00:57:42,033 --> 00:57:44,200
so he can come hear
your big secret news.

1405
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:45,767
- Dad, use your thumbs.

1406
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,667
- What?
- Gotta use your thumbs.

1407
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,433
It's faster if your
use your thumbs.

1408
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,367
No, okay, so you have to
hit the key the number

1409
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,700
of times for the
letter that you want.

1410
00:57:53,834 --> 00:57:54,934
- I just deleted everything.
- Dad.

1411
00:57:55,066 --> 00:57:55,934
- Oh this is never
gonna catch on.

1412
00:57:56,066 --> 00:57:57,300
Okay, we'll just tell him later.

1413
00:57:57,433 --> 00:57:58,467
What is it?

1414
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,000
- Okay.

1415
00:58:02,133 --> 00:58:04,200
- Oh, would you look at that.

1416
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:06,100
- You suppose that boy might
come inside the house now

1417
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,633
instead of just honking outside?

1418
00:58:07,767 --> 00:58:08,400
- I mean, maybe.

1419
00:58:08,533 --> 00:58:09,500
- Invite him for lunch tomorrow.

1420
00:58:09,633 --> 00:58:10,333
We'll celebrate.

1421
00:58:10,467 --> 00:58:11,500
- We should plan that.

1422
00:58:11,633 --> 00:58:13,700
I know that tomorrow he has
to be the fourth for golf

1423
00:58:13,834 --> 00:58:16,700
for his dad and
Michael Williams.

1424
00:58:16,834 --> 00:58:17,567
- No.

1425
00:58:34,734 --> 00:58:36,834
- Thought I might find you here.

1426
00:58:36,967 --> 00:58:39,300
- Yeah, figured I'd
come say goodbye

1427
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:41,900
before the bulldozer showed up.

1428
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,667
Congratulations.

1429
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,100
- Oh, yeah, I wanted
to tell you myself,

1430
00:58:59,233 --> 00:59:01,700
but I guess news travels fast.

1431
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,066
- It is a small town.

1432
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:05,934
- Yeah.

1433
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,233
I'm sorry.

1434
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,934
- About the engagement?

1435
00:59:12,066 --> 00:59:13,967
- No, about the library.

1436
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,066
- Right.

1437
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:19,567
I know it's just
an empty building,

1438
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,867
but it's about
what it represents.

1439
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,233
- Mm hm.
- The power and importance

1440
00:59:24,367 --> 00:59:26,767
of words; words are
knowledge, they're ideas,

1441
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,700
they're the tools we use
to build our thoughts.

1442
00:59:29,834 --> 00:59:31,266
So, they're important.

1443
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,100
Words like community,
justice and I love you.

1444
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,600
- Josh, Josh, I...

1445
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,500
I don't think you
really know me.

1446
00:59:50,633 --> 00:59:53,066
I don't know if you ever did.

1447
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,333
- I know you're
smart and passionate.

1448
00:59:57,467 --> 00:59:59,233
You fight for what
you believe in.

1449
00:59:59,367 --> 01:00:00,233
You help where help is needed.

1450
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:02,266
You're brave, tenacious.

1451
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:06,600
You always see the
best in people.

1452
01:00:08,133 --> 01:00:10,700
Even Rick.

1453
01:00:10,834 --> 01:00:12,433
- He's not a bad guy.

1454
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:15,233
And he loves me, he really does.

1455
01:00:15,367 --> 01:00:17,867
- I know, I know.

1456
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,233
I can tell by the
way he looks at you.

1457
01:00:22,367 --> 01:00:23,300
- Listen, I would
be lying if I said

1458
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:27,266
I don't have feelings
for you because I do.

1459
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,567
But I don't wanna hurt you.

1460
01:00:31,367 --> 01:00:35,500
I've only ever wanted
you to be happy, Josh.

1461
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:36,734
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said anything-

1462
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:38,066
- Oh, no, no, no,
no, please don't.

1463
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,400
Don't be sorry.

1464
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,734
- I want you to be happy too.

1465
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,433
I mean it.

1466
01:00:49,533 --> 01:00:52,734
So, I guess Rick's the one, huh?

1467
01:00:52,867 --> 01:00:54,400
- Ah, yeah, I guess.

1468
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,333
- So, do you think you're
gonna do a big country club

1469
01:00:59,467 --> 01:01:03,333
wedding or an over-the-top
destination wedding?

1470
01:01:03,467 --> 01:01:06,567
I don't know, somewhere exotic.

1471
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:07,867
Brazil, I dunno.

1472
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,300
- Brazil.
- Nah, you're right.

1473
01:01:11,433 --> 01:01:12,567
You should probably do
like Paris or something.

1474
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:13,800
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1475
01:01:13,934 --> 01:01:15,633
not the wedding,
Michael Williams.

1476
01:01:15,767 --> 01:01:17,400
Brazil doesn't have
extradition reciprocity,

1477
01:01:17,533 --> 01:01:19,767
that's why he goes there.

1478
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:20,967
- Why do you know
so many things?

1479
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,066
- Michael Williams is getting
checks from Rick's father

1480
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,834
and another investor at
the country club tomorrow.

1481
01:01:24,967 --> 01:01:29,166
I would love to know what kind
of financials he's claiming.

1482
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,967
- Well, we could...

1483
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,133
Nah, it's stupid.
- What, what?

1484
01:01:34,266 --> 01:01:36,600
- Oh, I was just gonna say
that we could I don't know,

1485
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,400
sneak in and steal
his briefcase.

1486
01:01:38,533 --> 01:01:39,667
But that's just-
- Yeah, that's the kinda

1487
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,567
thing that gets me disbarred.

1488
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,934
If I were a lawyer, which I
am absolutely totally not, so.

1489
01:01:50,033 --> 01:01:54,300
- I mean, like I said, it
was a stupid idea okay?

1490
01:01:54,433 --> 01:01:55,166
- Is it?

1491
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,033
Hi, there.

1492
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:05,533
We're just looking
for job applications.

1493
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:06,500
- All right,
go on through.

1494
01:02:06,633 --> 01:02:07,900
- Thank you so much.

1495
01:02:08,033 --> 01:02:08,934
Have a good day.
- Just some normal people.

1496
01:02:09,066 --> 01:02:10,433
- You go get job
applications for our cover,

1497
01:02:10,567 --> 01:02:11,834
and I'm gonna get the laundry.

1498
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,033
- Okay, let's go.

1499
01:02:21,834 --> 01:02:22,900
- Hello.

1500
01:02:23,033 --> 01:02:23,867
Listen, I know you
have thing about

1501
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,233
wearing other people's clothes.

1502
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:26,533
- What, how would
you know about that?

1503
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:29,767
I mean, not that that's a thing
that I have a thing about.

1504
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,734
I don't have a thing about that.

1505
01:02:30,867 --> 01:02:31,934
- No, of course you don't.

1506
01:02:32,066 --> 01:02:32,867
Um, can you wear
this shirt please?

1507
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,900
- On my body.
- Josh.

1508
01:02:35,033 --> 01:02:35,967
We're not members.

1509
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,934
We have like two seconds
before they kick us out.

1510
01:02:38,066 --> 01:02:39,066
Nobody gives the
staff a second look.

1511
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,600
It's like an invisibility cloak.

1512
01:02:40,734 --> 01:02:44,567
- Okay, Brett, Brett,
my name is Brett.

1513
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,367
I play a lot of Xbox.

1514
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:52,567
I wanna put sweet, sweet
rims on my Hyundai Elantra.

1515
01:02:54,367 --> 01:02:55,667
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1516
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,433
- I don't know how you make it

1517
01:02:56,567 --> 01:02:58,367
through the world as yourself.

1518
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,433
You good?

1519
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:00,700
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You gonna live?

1520
01:03:00,834 --> 01:03:02,433
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good.
- Good, great, great.

1521
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:05,133
And if I have timed
this correctly.

1522
01:03:05,266 --> 01:03:06,100
- There you go.
- All right.

1523
01:03:06,233 --> 01:03:07,467
- Nice.
- Let's do it.

1524
01:03:13,567 --> 01:03:14,266
- You just have to trust me.

1525
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,300
It's not that hard.

1526
01:03:16,433 --> 01:03:17,133
All right.

1527
01:03:18,934 --> 01:03:21,166
Hi, hey, there, Helms.

1528
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,266
Listen, there's a little
old lady in the sauna.

1529
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,800
What'd she say her
name was, Brett?

1530
01:03:25,934 --> 01:03:27,300
- Vermelle.
- Vermelle, Vermelle is saying

1531
01:03:27,433 --> 01:03:29,600
that she lost the
key to her locker,

1532
01:03:29,734 --> 01:03:31,834
and now she's headed towards
the dining room in a towel.

1533
01:03:31,967 --> 01:03:34,667
So, do you have a
spare we could borrow?

1534
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,133
- Are you kids new?

1535
01:03:36,266 --> 01:03:37,800
- Yes, yes, we're very new.
- Yes.

1536
01:03:37,934 --> 01:03:39,100
- We started a couple weeks ago.

1537
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:41,333
- You processed my badge.
- You did.

1538
01:03:41,467 --> 01:03:43,834
- You kids are starting
to blend together.

1539
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:47,133
I stay the same, but y'all
just keep getting younger.

1540
01:03:47,266 --> 01:03:50,633
It's chow time, so I
got nobody to take over.

1541
01:03:50,767 --> 01:03:52,633
So, take the master key.

1542
01:03:52,767 --> 01:03:55,633
But if this isn't back in my
ring by the end of my shift,

1543
01:03:55,767 --> 01:03:58,133
I will come and
find you, Jocelyn.

1544
01:03:58,266 --> 01:03:59,467
- Hope you do.

1545
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,500
You have yourself
a great day, sir.

1546
01:04:04,033 --> 01:04:07,100
Okay, let's hit the
men's locker room.

1547
01:04:15,934 --> 01:04:17,200
Oh, gentlemen,
I'm gonna need you

1548
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:18,867
to give me just one minute.

1549
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,400
Thank you so much.

1550
01:04:26,433 --> 01:04:27,166
- Um, hi.

1551
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,333
Uh, I just fired up the
sauna if you wanna you know,

1552
01:04:32,467 --> 01:04:33,734
grab a fresh towel.

1553
01:04:33,867 --> 01:04:36,834
15 minutes in there and
you'll be new men, huh?

1554
01:04:36,967 --> 01:04:37,700
Maybe?

1555
01:04:38,867 --> 01:04:40,233
Nice and refreshing.

1556
01:04:40,367 --> 01:04:41,133
Get a good schvitz in.

1557
01:04:41,266 --> 01:04:42,166
Yeah, enjoy.

1558
01:04:54,967 --> 01:04:55,700
It's fine.

1559
01:04:59,834 --> 01:05:00,934
Nothing to see here.

1560
01:05:01,066 --> 01:05:03,934
Just Brett with some towels.

1561
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:04,900
Go, go, go.

1562
01:05:05,033 --> 01:05:05,934
- You should keep that name tag.

1563
01:05:06,066 --> 01:05:08,967
You seem to like it.
- What?

1564
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,533
- Hey, a little bit of help!
- Okay.

1565
01:05:10,667 --> 01:05:11,300
- Should we just pull over here?

1566
01:05:11,433 --> 01:05:13,066
- No, keep going, keep going.

1567
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,600
- What about here?
- No, not yet.

1568
01:05:14,734 --> 01:05:15,800
- Why not?

1569
01:05:15,934 --> 01:05:17,100
- Just keep going.
- I am going.

1570
01:05:17,233 --> 01:05:18,233
- Oh, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

1571
01:05:18,367 --> 01:05:19,333
Here.

1572
01:05:19,467 --> 01:05:20,767
While you were charming
Helms out of the key,

1573
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,967
I was clocking where the
security cameras were.

1574
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,533
Besides, cigarette butts.

1575
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:28,433
This is where the staff
smokes so they can't be seen.

1576
01:05:28,567 --> 01:05:29,700
- Props to Brett.

1577
01:05:29,834 --> 01:05:32,467
You are revealing a criminal
mind I did not know existed.

1578
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,633
Respect.
- Don't give me props yet.

1579
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:35,600
Tried it, flopped.

1580
01:05:35,734 --> 01:05:37,533
- Yeah, I figured it would be.

1581
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:38,467
One second.

1582
01:05:40,533 --> 01:05:41,166
I went through a
phase where I wanted

1583
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,567
to be an escape artist as a kid.

1584
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,433
I kept locking Ash
in the basement.

1585
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:47,133
But I came away with a skillset.

1586
01:05:51,834 --> 01:05:54,433
- Now who's the
criminal mastermind?

1587
01:05:54,567 --> 01:05:56,233
Is it in there?
- Yep.

1588
01:06:02,967 --> 01:06:04,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

1589
01:06:04,133 --> 01:06:07,934
- I'm up from billing and
our copier is on the fritz.

1590
01:06:08,066 --> 01:06:09,667
I really need to get
these reports done.

1591
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,133
- Sure, okay.
- Oh, thanks so much.

1592
01:06:12,266 --> 01:06:13,000
Great.

1593
01:06:22,467 --> 01:06:24,033
- Hello to you, sir.

1594
01:06:26,467 --> 01:06:30,834
- Still got it.

1595
01:06:30,967 --> 01:06:32,100
- Oh, sorry, just one second.

1596
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:34,100
- Ugh, why so tiny?

1597
01:06:34,233 --> 01:06:35,934
- Hi, excuse me.

1598
01:06:36,066 --> 01:06:37,166
Yeah, hi, hello.
- Hi.

1599
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,033
- Uh, Jocelyn.
- That's me, yep.

1600
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:40,667
- You could stop
texting your boyfriend.

1601
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,667
- Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

1602
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,633
- I called housekeeping
20 minutes ago.

1603
01:06:42,767 --> 01:06:44,967
Those hampers are
practically overflowing.

1604
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,133
- Right, yes, and
that is why I am here.

1605
01:06:47,266 --> 01:06:48,667
- And you should be there.

1606
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:49,834
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1607
01:06:49,967 --> 01:06:50,567
That's really nice.

1608
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:54,233
Wow.

1609
01:06:55,767 --> 01:06:59,000
- Anytime.
- Hey, just give him a second.

1610
01:07:02,467 --> 01:07:04,400
- Man down .

1611
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:06,266
That's what-
- Come on, help me.

1612
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,333
- Okay, okay.
- Are you all right?

1613
01:07:07,467 --> 01:07:08,734
- No, I'm not all right.
- Come on, get off it.

1614
01:07:08,867 --> 01:07:10,567
- Piece of cake.

1615
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,033
Yeah, Dad, I got it.

1616
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:20,000
- You gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

1617
01:07:21,567 --> 01:07:23,567
- And at least it's bandaged.

1618
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:24,767
Okay.
- Ow, ow.

1619
01:07:32,033 --> 01:07:35,066
- No.

1620
01:07:46,133 --> 01:07:47,900
- Doing well.
- Your son hit me a golf ball.

1621
01:07:48,033 --> 01:07:49,100
- I know, well, what can you do?

1622
01:07:52,033 --> 01:07:55,066
It's just a little
more this way.

1623
01:07:59,567 --> 01:08:01,633
- Hi, there, could we get
medical to the clubhouse please?

1624
01:08:01,767 --> 01:08:03,233
It looks like there's someone
coming in off the golf course.

1625
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:05,266
They appear to be
having a heart attack.

1626
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,100
Oh, thank you so much.

1627
01:08:06,233 --> 01:08:06,967
Bye, bye.

1628
01:08:16,367 --> 01:08:17,800
- Okay, come on.

1629
01:08:17,934 --> 01:08:18,800
It's not a heart attack.

1630
01:08:18,934 --> 01:08:20,900
- He just sprained his ankle.

1631
01:08:21,033 --> 01:08:22,500
Did you order this?

1632
01:08:25,266 --> 01:08:26,133
- Oh, hi, I'm sorry.

1633
01:08:26,266 --> 01:08:27,133
Excuse me.

1634
01:08:27,266 --> 01:08:28,100
Sorry.

1635
01:08:28,233 --> 01:08:31,000
- I was able to copy
90% of the towels.

1636
01:08:31,133 --> 01:08:32,333
Here, take these, take these.

1637
01:08:32,467 --> 01:08:33,600
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1638
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:34,767
- I'm going, I'm going as fast-

1639
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:35,567
- Go faster than you're going!
- Okay.

1640
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:54,533
Have you seen a rat?

1641
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:01,567
- You gonna be okay there?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1642
01:09:05,834 --> 01:09:07,066
- Excuse me, can
you move your cart?

1643
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,333
We're trying to get
in the locker room.

1644
01:09:08,467 --> 01:09:09,400
- Yeah, sorry, my
brake's broken.

1645
01:09:09,533 --> 01:09:10,834
I'm gonna need like a
second to fix it please.

1646
01:09:10,967 --> 01:09:11,834
- Oh, here,
here, let me help.

1647
01:09:11,967 --> 01:09:12,867
There you go.
- Oh my gosh,

1648
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,700
you're really strong.
- The brake's fine.

1649
01:09:13,834 --> 01:09:15,000
- Thank you.

1650
01:09:15,133 --> 01:09:15,667
You have a great day, sir.
- You too.

1651
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,700
- Bye, bye now.

1652
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,700
- You're gonna be fine, okay?

1653
01:09:23,834 --> 01:09:25,166
- It's fine.

1654
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,500
- I know you
wanted to get 18 holes in,

1655
01:09:26,633 --> 01:09:28,500
but wanna just change
and get outta here?

1656
01:09:28,633 --> 01:09:30,200
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

1657
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,367
Hey!

1658
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,533
Could we get some towels?

1659
01:09:43,633 --> 01:09:45,367
These attendants
are crazy today.

1660
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,066
- Yeah.

1661
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,367
- Go, go!
- I'm going!

1662
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:51,200
- Go, go, go!
- I'm going!

1663
01:09:53,033 --> 01:09:54,166
- I can't
believe that worked.

1664
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:58,533
- That was amazing.

1665
01:09:58,667 --> 01:10:00,500
- Oh, hey, Katheryn.

1666
01:10:00,633 --> 01:10:02,333
This is a copy of
Kennsington's Investors list.

1667
01:10:02,467 --> 01:10:03,867
Let's see what we can find
out about everybody in there.

1668
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,700
- Okay.
- Thanks.

1669
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:06,800
- Tracey, hi.
- Hi.

1670
01:10:06,934 --> 01:10:08,100
- How's it going?
- Good.

1671
01:10:08,233 --> 01:10:10,500
I help with bookkeeping for
my dad's construction company.

1672
01:10:10,633 --> 01:10:11,200
- Great.

1673
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:12,800
- These are account numbers.

1674
01:10:12,934 --> 01:10:14,367
The money from the
city and the investors

1675
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,633
should all go into
an escrow account.

1676
01:10:15,767 --> 01:10:19,033
But here's the thing, the
account numbers don't match up.

1677
01:10:19,166 --> 01:10:20,700
- So, what's going on?

1678
01:10:20,834 --> 01:10:22,567
- We don't know.

1679
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:25,900
Unless I like hacked
into the accounts.

1680
01:10:26,033 --> 01:10:28,033
- And see, that
would be unethical

1681
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:31,033
and I could not
ask you to do that.

1682
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,333
- So, I shouldn't?

1683
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:35,500
- Tracey, come with me.

1684
01:10:35,633 --> 01:10:38,066
I would never ask
you to do that,

1685
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,200
just like I would never ever
tell you that you should take

1686
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:44,734
all of these things and
bring them to the basement

1687
01:10:44,867 --> 01:10:48,734
where Ash has the best computer
and the WiFi is very fast.

1688
01:10:48,867 --> 01:10:52,533
- Right, I'm not going to
hack these accounts at all.

1689
01:10:52,667 --> 01:10:53,533
- No.

1690
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:55,734
- And yeah, you guys
have super fast WiFi.

1691
01:10:55,867 --> 01:10:56,934
- Oh, this is nothing.

1692
01:10:57,066 --> 01:10:58,500
When you get down there,
tell Ash that in the future,

1693
01:10:58,633 --> 01:11:01,367
WiFi speeds are going
to blow his mind.

1694
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,467
He'll get it.

1695
01:11:04,066 --> 01:11:07,433
Hey, Tracey, your
shirt is really cute.

1696
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:09,934
- You like it?
- I like it,

1697
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:12,467
but my brother's gonna love it.

1698
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:27,533
.

1699
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:28,500
- What do we do if
the judge asks us

1700
01:11:28,633 --> 01:11:30,533
how the new information
was obtained?

1701
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:31,900
- I find in that
case the best defense

1702
01:11:32,033 --> 01:11:34,667
is to get incredibly offended.

1703
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,667
- Miss Hartman, we must
stop meeting like this.

1704
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,000
People will talk.

1705
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:39,967
- People always
talk, Your Honor.

1706
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,834
We hope to give them
appropriate reason.

1707
01:11:41,967 --> 01:11:42,834
- Your Honor, I would
like to point out

1708
01:11:42,967 --> 01:11:45,033
that we have already
resolved this matter.

1709
01:11:45,166 --> 01:11:47,367
Miss Hartman is filing
nuisance motions as a means

1710
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,533
of wasting the time of
the court and myself.

1711
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:51,300
- This court assumes
that you are billing

1712
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:53,300
your clients for
everything on this case.

1713
01:11:53,433 --> 01:11:57,734
So, our definitions of wasting
time apparently differ.

1714
01:11:57,867 --> 01:12:00,300
Now, it looks like the court
is being asked to invoke

1715
01:12:00,433 --> 01:12:03,233
a permanent stay against
demolition of the library.

1716
01:12:03,367 --> 01:12:05,100
So, have a seat, Mr. Baxter,

1717
01:12:05,233 --> 01:12:06,767
and let's hear what
Miss Hartman has to say

1718
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:10,233
before we toss around
words like nuisance.

1719
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:12,934
The floor is yours.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1720
01:12:14,233 --> 01:12:15,934
Your Honor, we are asking
this court to reinstate

1721
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:17,467
and make permanent
the injunction against

1722
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,800
the demolition of the library.

1723
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:20,200
- On what possible grounds?

1724
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:21,967
- On the grounds
of new information

1725
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,734
that has recently come to light.

1726
01:12:23,867 --> 01:12:25,934
If it'd please the court, we'd
like to submit into evidence

1727
01:12:26,066 --> 01:12:28,767
documents we have labeled
exhibits F through P.

1728
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:29,834
- I move to disallow.

1729
01:12:29,967 --> 01:12:32,300
We haven't been informed
of any new documents.

1730
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:34,133
- I'm sorry, Your Honor,
I'm sure that Mr. Baxter

1731
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:36,200
knows as well as I do
that his is a hearing,

1732
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:38,300
so the rules of
disclosure don't apply.

1733
01:12:38,433 --> 01:12:40,700
However, I have made copies
for opposing counsel,

1734
01:12:40,834 --> 01:12:42,100
although I feel
that their client

1735
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:47,233
will be more than familiar
with the contents.

1736
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:50,066
- Uh, Your Honor, we would
move to have this new evidence

1737
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,767
excluded on a cursory
review it would appear

1738
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,800
that this evidence is
unfairly prejudicial.

1739
01:12:55,934 --> 01:12:57,600
- Your Honor, we maintain
that these documents

1740
01:12:57,734 --> 01:12:59,800
have a highly probative
value to this case.

1741
01:12:59,934 --> 01:13:03,533
- Additionally, it would appear
that many of these documents

1742
01:13:03,667 --> 01:13:05,600
have been stolen from
my client's briefcase.

1743
01:13:05,734 --> 01:13:07,834
- Stolen, you say?

1744
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,000
Miss Hartman.
- Your Honor, I'm outraged.

1745
01:13:10,133 --> 01:13:12,667
Is Mr. Baxter really accusing
me of theft in a court of law?

1746
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,800
I mean, he of all people should
know that such outlandish

1747
01:13:14,934 --> 01:13:16,700
accusations without
underlying proof

1748
01:13:16,834 --> 01:13:19,000
are slanderous and
highly actionable.

1749
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:21,333
- The young lady does
have a very valid point.

1750
01:13:21,467 --> 01:13:23,266
I'm assuming you would not
want to open yourself up

1751
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,367
to that type of legal exposure.

1752
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,700
So, what proof do you have?

1753
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:29,934
Are the originals missing?

1754
01:13:30,066 --> 01:13:32,133
- No, they don't seem to be.

1755
01:13:32,266 --> 01:13:36,734
But these two pages are
wrinkled, indicating tampering.

1756
01:13:41,967 --> 01:13:44,266
- Wrinkles.

1757
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,467
You would like me to throw out
evidence because of wrinkles.

1758
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,333
I like to pride
myself on my patience,

1759
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:51,100
but it has limits, Mr. Baxter.

1760
01:13:51,233 --> 01:13:53,133
It has limits.

1761
01:13:53,266 --> 01:13:55,667
Your motion is overruled.

1762
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,300
Now, Miss Hartman, would
you care to explain

1763
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,667
to the court what
we are looking at.

1764
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,200
- Absolutely, Your Honor.

1765
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:03,700
Michael Williams presented
document F to the city

1766
01:14:03,834 --> 01:14:05,233
as a means of securing funding.

1767
01:14:05,367 --> 01:14:08,066
That is a list of his
45 primary investors.

1768
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,734
We did some research on this
list and it does appear that

1769
01:14:10,867 --> 01:14:15,567
29 of them are deceased and
11 are currently incarcerated.

1770
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,200
- Mr. Baxter?

1771
01:14:21,834 --> 01:14:22,867
- Thank you.

1772
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,667
Exhibits K through M show
a series of transactions

1773
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,834
between escrow accounts
meant for construction funds.

1774
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,233
However, you'll see that
the funds were transferred

1775
01:14:30,367 --> 01:14:32,834
to a subsidiary company,
Platinum Holdings.

1776
01:14:32,967 --> 01:14:38,400
And later used to purchase
property in Bahia, Brazil.

1777
01:14:38,533 --> 01:14:40,367
The sole proprietor
of Platinum Holdings

1778
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,533
is Michael Williams.

1779
01:14:42,667 --> 01:14:43,767
- Whoa, dude.

1780
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:46,233
- Your Honor, you last time
we spoke you asked for proof

1781
01:14:46,367 --> 01:14:48,000
that Michael Williams
intends to defraud the city.

1782
01:14:48,133 --> 01:14:51,400
I feel like these
documents connect the dots.

1783
01:14:51,533 --> 01:14:52,266
Thank you.

1784
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,600
- I take your assertion that
these documents were obtained

1785
01:14:56,734 --> 01:15:00,633
illegally as proof that
they are in fact valid.

1786
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:05,233
- We may not have reviewed them
closely enough, Your Honor.

1787
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:07,133
- Well, perhaps I can help
in your review by turning

1788
01:15:07,266 --> 01:15:10,300
these documents over to
the State Attorney General.

1789
01:15:10,433 --> 01:15:12,967
And Mr. Williams, until they
have come to a conclusion,

1790
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:16,734
you are hereby ordered
not to leave the state.

1791
01:15:16,867 --> 01:15:19,500
In light of this and the current
petition facing this court,

1792
01:15:19,633 --> 01:15:21,834
I am granting a
permanent injunction

1793
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:24,266
against demolition
of the library.

1794
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,667
Court is adjourned.

1795
01:15:29,467 --> 01:15:31,200
- You did it.
- Thanks.

1796
01:15:33,767 --> 01:15:34,500
Okay.

1797
01:15:40,734 --> 01:15:41,867
- Miss Hartman.

1798
01:15:44,266 --> 01:15:46,433
I'm not accustomed
to being bested.

1799
01:15:46,567 --> 01:15:49,266
Especially not by someone
I assumed was a novice.

1800
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,800
- And yet, here we are.
- Yes, here we are.

1801
01:15:51,934 --> 01:15:53,133
- Hm.

1802
01:15:53,266 --> 01:15:54,100
- Give me a call if you need

1803
01:15:54,233 --> 01:15:56,000
a recommendation for law school.

1804
01:15:56,133 --> 01:15:58,433
And there may be a place
for you at our firm.

1805
01:15:58,567 --> 01:15:59,633
That is if you
can prove you have

1806
01:15:59,767 --> 01:16:02,066
what it takes to
swim with sharks.

1807
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:06,600
- Oh, Mal, see the thing is,
I um, I think I just did.

1808
01:16:17,934 --> 01:16:20,900
- You were amazing.
- Thanks.

1809
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,066
- Get a room.

1810
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:35,900
- This is awkward,
I don't know him,

1811
01:16:36,033 --> 01:16:38,467
so it's really embarrassing.

1812
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,333
- Well, all is right
with the world.

1813
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:44,066
- Yeah.

1814
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:47,567
Almost.

1815
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,033
Okay, you ready?

1816
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:50,800
- No!
- Okay, on three.

1817
01:16:50,934 --> 01:16:52,033
- This is my dad's truck.

1818
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:54,200
- This is my dad's spine.
- What?

1819
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:56,066
- One, two, three, go!

1820
01:17:02,734 --> 01:17:04,800
- Happy?
- Nope, back it up.

1821
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,633
- Happy?
- Nope, one more time.

1822
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:20,900
- Happy?
- Now I am happy.

1823
01:18:01,533 --> 01:18:02,266
- Hi.
- Hi.

1824
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Oh, you look beautiful.
- Aw, well, thank you.

1825
01:18:07,133 --> 01:18:08,667
Happy your parents'
25th anniversary party.

1826
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,734
- Oh, thank you very much.

1827
01:18:09,867 --> 01:18:10,800
It's all about me.

1828
01:18:10,934 --> 01:18:11,767
Hey, where's Josh?

1829
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,200
I thought you guys
were coming together?

1830
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:14,734
- Yeah, he was supposed to,

1831
01:18:14,867 --> 01:18:18,900
but he is in love
with someone else.

1832
01:18:19,033 --> 01:18:22,000
- Ah, yeah, I'm
sorry about that.

1833
01:18:22,133 --> 01:18:23,834
- How does that
someone else feel?

1834
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:26,000
- It's that obvious, huh?
- Hm.

1835
01:18:26,133 --> 01:18:27,567
- Okay.

1836
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:28,500
I don't know, I don't know.

1837
01:18:28,633 --> 01:18:31,667
I, I, I guess I didn't
really expect it

1838
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,333
to get this complicated.

1839
01:18:33,467 --> 01:18:34,667
- Hey, while we're on the topic.

1840
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,467
- Uh huh.
- Can I have a look

1841
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,667
at that complication?
- Mm hm.

1842
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,166
- Wow.
- I know.

1843
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,033
- Maggie.

1844
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:41,900
- Hi.
- Hey.

1845
01:18:42,934 --> 01:18:44,800
- Hi.
- Can we talk?

1846
01:18:44,934 --> 01:18:47,867
Somewhere quieter?
- Yes, yes, we can.

1847
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,834
One second.

1848
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:56,066
- So, my dad wanted
me to tell you that-

1849
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,166
- Oh, it's, it's okay.

1850
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,333
He doesn't have to thank me.
- No, he's furious.

1851
01:18:59,467 --> 01:19:01,066
His friend's getting
indited because of you.

1852
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,266
- His friend?

1853
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,233
His friend who was
gonna scam him?

1854
01:19:03,367 --> 01:19:05,133
He's mad at me?
- You don't know my dad.

1855
01:19:05,266 --> 01:19:07,767
He hates being proven
wrong more than anything.

1856
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:12,567
But what I don't get
is I thought we had
put this behind us?

1857
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,367
We were supposed to
conquer the world together.

1858
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,900
But now you're back in court
going against all that.

1859
01:19:19,033 --> 01:19:21,233
Why would you do that?

1860
01:19:21,367 --> 01:19:22,734
- I mean, it was the
right thing to do.

1861
01:19:22,867 --> 01:19:24,200
That's gotta count
for something.

1862
01:19:24,333 --> 01:19:26,033
- I asked you to marry me.

1863
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:28,734
That should count for something.

1864
01:19:30,033 --> 01:19:30,767
- It does.

1865
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:33,133
It really, really does.

1866
01:19:33,266 --> 01:19:35,433
It's just, it's not enough.

1867
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:40,767
I think that the idea of
you is just wrapped up

1868
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,934
in somebody I thought
I wanted to be.

1869
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:47,567
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

1870
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:51,266
- I know, I know you don't.

1871
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,600
I'm um, I'm really sorry, Rick.

1872
01:19:58,567 --> 01:19:59,934
I'm sorry.

1873
01:20:10,166 --> 01:20:12,567
I don't want a
do-over, Josh Turner.

1874
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:16,066
- I can't hear you,
Maggie Hartman.

1875
01:20:23,867 --> 01:20:24,600
Maggie?

1876
01:20:26,533 --> 01:20:29,200
Maggie, can you hear me?
- Sweetheart?

1877
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:32,066
Sweetheart, are you okay?
- Honey?

1878
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,367
- What?

1879
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,233
What, what happened?

1880
01:20:34,367 --> 01:20:35,867
What's goin on?

1881
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,633
- You must've hit
your head pretty hard.

1882
01:20:37,767 --> 01:20:40,066
You were out for
about 30 seconds.

1883
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,066
- I was?

1884
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,567
Oh, it felt way
longer than that.

1885
01:20:49,567 --> 01:20:51,400
You're going gray.

1886
01:20:51,533 --> 01:20:53,233
- Are you sure you're okay?

1887
01:20:53,367 --> 01:20:56,233
It's been coming
in for a few years.

1888
01:20:56,367 --> 01:20:57,767
- All right, it's a good
thing I am dating a doctor.

1889
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:59,233
He's just grabbing
his bag from the car.

1890
01:20:59,367 --> 01:21:00,867
- Oh, gosh.

1891
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,500
Um, Daddy, were you dancing?

1892
01:21:02,633 --> 01:21:03,700
- Well, what do you expect?

1893
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:07,266
It's not everyday we celebrate
our 40th anniversary.

1894
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,066
- Ash!

1895
01:21:09,266 --> 01:21:11,667
Um, I just uh, I just got back.

1896
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:14,967
- What are you talking about?

1897
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,500
- I just got back.

1898
01:21:18,834 --> 01:21:21,533
- No way, seriously?
- Yeah.

1899
01:21:21,667 --> 01:21:23,000
And you're here with Tracey.

1900
01:21:23,133 --> 01:21:23,834
You're here with Tracey!

1901
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:25,033
- Yeah, sis!

1902
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:27,133
We came in from
Palo Alto yesterday.

1903
01:21:27,266 --> 01:21:30,166
We have a couple more
months before I can't fly.

1904
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:32,433
- Oh my gosh, I'm back.

1905
01:21:34,433 --> 01:21:36,700
I'm really back.
- Yeah.

1906
01:21:36,834 --> 01:21:38,133
- Hi.
- Hi.

1907
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,100
- Sweetie, are you
sure you're okay?

1908
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:46,667
I mean, that was
quite a bump you took.

1909
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,000
- I'm fine, I promise.

1910
01:21:48,133 --> 01:21:49,667
I want you guys to
go enjoy your party.

1911
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,467
I just need some rest.
- You're sure?

1912
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,367
- I really am.

1913
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,266
- Let's get you home.
- Okay.

1914
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,633
- Where's uh, where's the car?

1915
01:21:57,767 --> 01:21:59,967
- Uh, honey, you guys
walked over here.

1916
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:02,700
But I can drive you home if
you're not up for the 10 blocks.

1917
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:06,266
- I think that's a good idea.
- No, no, I'm fine.

1918
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,667
- You sure?
- You sure?

1919
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:11,367
- Yeah, I am.
- Aw, I love you so much.

1920
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,900
- I love you.
- And you too.

1921
01:22:14,033 --> 01:22:15,200
- Put some ice on
that bump, okay?

1922
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:16,400
- I will.
- You look after her.

1923
01:22:16,533 --> 01:22:17,367
- Will do.

1924
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,400
Go have fun.

1925
01:22:21,166 --> 01:22:23,934
- We did all right.
- Yeah.

1926
01:22:28,133 --> 01:22:29,066
- Oh my gosh.

1927
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:30,767
Oh, look.

1928
01:22:33,567 --> 01:22:36,367
The library, it's so beautiful.

1929
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,533
- Library?
- Yeah.

1930
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:41,266
- No one's called your
office that in years.

1931
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:44,834
Are you sure you're okay?

1932
01:22:44,967 --> 01:22:46,867
- I just had the strangest
sense of deja vu.

1933
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,033
I thought that, I thought
that we lived in Chicago,

1934
01:22:52,166 --> 01:22:55,166
and I worked at this big firm.

1935
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:56,934
- Okay, all right.

1936
01:22:57,066 --> 01:22:58,667
We're definitely getting
you checked out tomorrow.

1937
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,767
- No, no, no, no, it's okay.

1938
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:04,333
I'm okay, I obviously
know that we live here,

1939
01:23:04,467 --> 01:23:10,500
and that is my office and you
are the school superintendent.

1940
01:23:10,633 --> 01:23:12,100
- And we're the
local power couple.

1941
01:23:12,233 --> 01:23:14,266
- Does anybody
actually call us that?

1942
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,400
- I do.
- Do you?

1943
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:16,900
- All the time.
- All the time?

1944
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:19,333
- All the time.

1945
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,667
- That's enough for me.

1946
01:23:27,934 --> 01:23:29,000
Let's go home.
