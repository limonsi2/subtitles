<i>One, two. One, two…</i>

5
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:26,041
<i>Start on one, two. Okay?</i>

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,708
<i>One, two is the signal.</i>

7
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:31,291
<i>Yeah, I got it.</i>

8
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,708
<i>One, two…</i>

00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,833
<i>I can't get all emotional</i>

10
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,458
<i>I'm just a coward now</i>

11
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,000
<i>These polished sharp words</i>

12
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,416
<i>They're important, so hold on and laugh</i>

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,083
<i>Thump, thump, thump, I'm all excited</i>

14
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,541
<i>Breathe it in, can't let it out</i>

15
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,708
<i>I'm getting sick of you</i>
<i>You're so difficult</i>

16
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,875

17
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,083

<i>Let's work on this lonely love</i>

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,833
<i>My heart aches</i>

20
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:18,375
<i>And today, let's be reborn</i>

21
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,583
<i>We'll be dumb</i>

22
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,125
<i>And fly through the air</i>

23
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:25,083
<i>Let's forget about the now, la ta ta</i>

24
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:28,208
{\an8}<i>Let's dance, heat up tonight</i>

25
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,583
<i>Forget about your tears</i>
<i>So you can't fall asleep</i>

26
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:34,458
<i>Don't let it become a lie</i>

27
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,708
<i>Even for me who's not me, la ta ta</i>

28
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:40,708
<i>Even on my darkest, gloomiest days</i>

29
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,833

<i>Rhythm.</i>

38
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,000
Hey, Aki.

39
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,500
I had a weird dream last night.

40
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:43,416
What was it?

41
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,208
During rehearsal, I panicked
and thought I was the only one off-key.

42
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,750
But you quit orchestra.

43
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,041
I know, right?

44
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,916
I guess I'm still in orchestra
in my dreams.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,291
The more I panicked,
the more off-key I got.

46
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:02,583
Before I realized it,
I wasn't even holding my violin.

47
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,250
What a weird dream.

48
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,541
I was panicking so much.

49
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,583
I thought the teacher would be mad
and looked over

50
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,625
and I saw a one-eyed monster
looking back at me.

51
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,708
One-eyed?

52
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,125
-One-eyed.
-Scary.

53
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,750
It was round like this.

54
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:18,875
You mean the eye?

55
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:23,541
Yeah, it was a one-eyed monster
looking at me.

56
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:28,291
I was so desperate to find my violin
but I couldn't find it.

57
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:33,750
Yeah, I have dreams where
I'm looking for things too.

58
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,250
You do, right?

59
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:39,083
Then, before I knew it,
that one-eyed thing got closer.

60
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:42,375
-That's so scary.
-It was just staring at me.

61
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,625
So creepy!

62
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:47,416
Then I realized it was just a dream.

63
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,041
What did you do then?

64
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,375
I jumped off.

65
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,333
What?

66
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:59,583
Have you ever fallen asleep in class
and woken up with a jerk?

67
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,333
I have…

68
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,125
-Right?!
-Yeah.

69
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:07,500
So I'd thought I would wake up
if I jumped off the building.

70
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,083
You just went all out.

71
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,750
I've been having
all these weird dreams lately.

72
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:12,875
What does it mean?

73
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,166
No idea. I'm going to get us refills.

74
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,833
Oh, thanks.

75
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,375
Wait.

76
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,791
I've had that dream before…

77
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,458
Huh?

78
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,583
<i>Taki never came back after that.</i>

79
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,625
<i>Since then, I've been</i>
<i>sending Taki countless messages.</i>

80
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,666
<i>But she never read</i>
<i>any of the messages I left her.</i>

81
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,000
<i>Those sentences remained unread.</i>

82
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,416
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

83
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,333
<i>I don't care who it is, it can be anybody</i>

84
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,583
<i>Is there anybody there?</i>

85
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,500
<i>Not voices…</i>

86
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,541
<i>I was good friends with Taki.</i>

87
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,083
<i>We both didn't fit in at school.</i>

88
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,875
<i>It was always just the two of us.</i>

89
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:53,083
<i>Our classes, electives</i>
<i>and path home were the same.</i>

90
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,541
<i>We both quit orchestra at the same time.</i>

91
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,375
<i>The music she showed me was all good.</i>

92
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,708
<i>I really liked it.</i>

93
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:06,208
<i>Taki was the first best friend I ever had.</i>

94
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,708
<i>Where on earth did she go?</i>

95
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,833
<i>What's going on? I can't move forward</i>

96
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,458
<i>This town with its hippy-vibes</i>

97
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,291
<i>How did you do it? Why?</i>

98
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:25,083
<i>Saying "everything is important"</i>
<i>It only sounds good</i>

99
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,708
<i>They suddenly appear from the other side</i>
<i>And before we know it, we're taken away</i>

100
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,458
<i>I was so afraid to let you go</i>

101
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,333
<i>Stay with me today too</i>

102
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,833
<i>Stay with me today too</i>

103
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,958
<i>You guys</i>

104
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,000
<i>You guys took me in</i>

105
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,000
<i>I don't remember it</i>

106
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,458
<i>But your face tells me</i>
<i>You want to say something</i>

107
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,666
<i>Everything in my sight</i>

108
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,500
<i>Everything here is all fake</i>

109
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,541
<i>Even if you're compassionate</i>
<i>Even if you've given up</i>

110
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,083
<i>Everything starts now</i>

111
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,791
<i>Try hard to bite your tongue</i>

112
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,500
<i>Stay there and shut up</i>

113
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,791
<i>It's a lie if I say</i>
<i>It's exactly as I imagined</i>

114
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,750
<i>You were sentimental</i>

115
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,333
<i>That's not like you</i>

116
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,125
<i>But that expression on you</i>

117
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:15,625
<i>That expression, for just a moment</i>

118
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:22,625
<i>Reflected beautifully in my eyes</i>

119
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:40,083
<i>For the longest time I yearned for you</i>
<i>And I almost lost myself</i>

120
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,083
<i>Overcome the real thing, if you're scared</i>

121
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,750
<i>Stay with me today too</i>

122
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,875
<i>What's going on? I can't move forward</i>

123
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,000
{\an8}<i>This town with its hippy-vibes</i>

124
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,125
<i>How did you do it? Why?</i>

125
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:30,708
<i>Saying "everything is important"</i>
<i>It only sounds good</i>

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,750
<i>They suddenly appear from the other side</i>

128
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,166

130
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,500
<i>Overcome the real thing…</i>

131
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,416
Did you have that weird dream?

132
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,125
Yeah, seems like
everyone's having that dream.

133
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,666
Yeah, I had it too. I seriously did.

134
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,083
What is that?

135
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,333
I told you yesterday.

136
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,708
-The one-eyed monster.
-The one-eyed monster.

137
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,208
The one-eyed monster.

138
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:12,958
The one-eyed monster.

139
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,708
THE ONE-EYED MONSTER?

140
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,625
<i>The one-eyed monster.</i>

141
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:26,666
<i>Taki used to take me</i>
<i>to all sorts of places.</i>

142
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:31,625
<i>We went to karaoke, cafés, and arcades.</i>

143
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,125
<i>Taki took me everywhere.</i>

144
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,500
<i>The room where the two of us</i>
<i>would sing karaoke</i>

145
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,333
<i>seems like a different place</i>
<i>now that she's not here.</i>

146
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,583
<i>The hustle and bustle of this sweet town</i>

147
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,875
<i>Leads to a traffic jam of feelings</i>

148
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,250
<i>You say you're not a part of this</i>

149
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,458
<i>The state of my heart is bleached white</i>

150
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,625
<i>No matter what, we're not a good match</i>

151
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,875
<i>Laugh at the prank, cheers to your face</i>

152
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,458
<i>I can't tell sweet and sour apart</i>

153
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,791
<i>I'm lost in front of you</i>

154
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,333
<i>Melting away, it's a rendezvous</i>

155
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,083
<i>It'll be platonic</i>

156
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:29,291
<i>It's a slightly bitter expectation</i>
<i>My heart might break</i>

157
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,791
<i>That's why if you're lost in your dreams…</i>

158
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,000
<i>Hey, Taki.</i>

159
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,958
<i>I want you to color my life more.</i>

160
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:42,166
<i>If you color my life, color my life</i>

161
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,583
<i>Don't play with my heart and look away</i>

162
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,916
<i>I want to be missing you</i>
<i>To be thinking about you</i>

163
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,583
<i>A pink heart forecast</i>

164
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:55,083
<i>If I tell you now, tell you now</i>

165
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:59,875
<i>We'll be one</i>
<i>And our gazes will fill with love</i>

166
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,458
<i>If I fail, the next step is goodbye</i>

167
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:09,041
<i>God, please be on my side today</i>

168
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,083
<i>I was a transfer student.</i>

169
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,916
<i>I didn't want people to make fun</i>
<i>of my accent.</i>

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,291
<i>Taki told me with a laugh</i>
<i>that her accent is worse</i>

171
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,583
<i>but it never bothered her.</i>

172
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:29,166
<i>We weren't good at</i>
<i>having conversations with other people.</i>

173
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,750
<i>So we played</i>
<i>a picture version of </i>shiritori<i>.</i>

174
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,833
<i>We didn't speak a word</i>
<i>but we could understand each other.</i>

175
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,500
<i>I expressed the words indifferently</i>
<i>What made me cry…</i>

176
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,958
-Oh no, it's gonna end!
-What?

177
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,666
<i>…Let's just end it today</i>

178
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,208
<i>One, two, wait for the signal…</i>

179
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,583
<i>But…</i>

180
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:50,000
<i>Only when I was with Taki,</i>
<i>could I speak so naturally.</i>

181
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,750
<i>You don't have to stop and stand there…</i>

182
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,833
<i>Taki told me the same thing.</i>

183
00:11:56,125 --> 00:12:00,666
<i>And I thought I could be with her</i>
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

184
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,458
<i>Taki.</i>

185
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,958
<i>The first best friend…</i>

186
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,416
<i>Don't tell me it's too late</i>

187
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,916
<i>…that I've ever made.</i>

188
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,166
<i>Right now</i>

189
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,416
<i>We're a wheel, starting to roll around</i>

190
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,708
<i>More and more! I hate it, but I like it</i>

191
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:26,041
<i>Hey! Hey! I don't understand</i>
<i>This self-meeting</i>

192
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,458
<i>Closer and closer to the middle</i>
<i>But it gets farther away</i>

193
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,750
<i>Bam! Bam! Move to the music</i>
<i>And start dancing</i>

194
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:36,250
<i>More and more! I hate it, but I like it</i>

195
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,583
<i>Hey! Hey! I don't know what's ahead of us</i>

196
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,625
<i>Take my heart and shake, shake</i>

197
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,541
<i>Yeah!</i>

198
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,416
<i>There's no right answer</i>

199
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,083
<i>Then where should we go?</i>

200
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,375
<i>Will the story end?</i>

201
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,125
<i>One, two, wait for the signal</i>

202
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,500
<i>You and me, we touched hands because</i>

203
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,000
<i>I was brave enough to go for it</i>

204
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,208
<i>Phase two</i>

205
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,000
<i>There's no point in being so stiff</i>

206
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,458
<i>It was embarrassing</i>
<i>Say goodbye to your dreams</i>

207
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,083
<i>Take care of me forever</i>

208
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,291
<i>Will you?</i>

209
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,416
<i>Right now</i>

210
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,791
<i>Come on! Come on! Get together</i>
<i>Turn our gazes away</i>

211
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,208
<i>More and more! I hate it, but I like it</i>

212
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,458
<i>Hey! Hey! I don't understand</i>
<i>This self-meeting</i>

213
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,833
<i>More and more! It comes together</i>
<i>And it falls apart</i>

214
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,958
<i>Bam! Bam! Before I touch you</i>
<i>You'll disappear</i>

215
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,583
<i>More and more! I hate it, but I like it</i>

216
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:35,208
<i>Hey! Hey! I don't know what's ahead of us</i>

217
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,250
<i>Until we understand each other, we'll…</i>

218
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:39,875
Taki!

219
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,666
Aki! What are you doing?

220
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,833
I'm taking a break because
the teacher took a long time for class.

221
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,166
Yeah, that did take a long time.

222
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,041
I'm going to the roof now.
Let's go together.

223
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,166
Okay.

224
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,333
<i>Don't tell me it's too late</i>

225
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,041
<i>Right now</i>

226
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,458
<i>We're a wheel, starting to roll around</i>

227
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,791
<i>More and more! I hate it, but I like it</i>

228
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:15,291
<i>Hey! Hey! I don't understand</i>
<i>This self-meeting</i>

229
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,541
<i>Closer and closer to the middle</i>
<i>But it gets farther away</i>

230
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,916
<i>Bam! Bam! Move to the music</i>
<i>And start dancing</i>

231
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,125
<i>More and more! I hate it, but I like it</i>

232
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:29,208
<i>Hey! Hey! I don't know what's ahead of us</i>

233
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,958
<i>Take my heart and shake, shake</i>

234
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:32,875
<i>Yeah!</i>

235
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,083
Aki!

236
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,916
Hurry up, Aki!

237
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,916
Wait a minute!

238
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,916
You're slow.

239
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,583
<i>There's no right answer…</i>

240
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,750
-You okay?
-Yeah, thanks.

241
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,458
Start on one, two. Okay?

242
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,875
Yeah, I know, Taki.

243
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,125
-Hey, Aki.
-Yeah?

244
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,041
<i>Phase two…</i>

245
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,666
Let's be together forever.

246
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,125
Will you?

247
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,291
<i>…Will you?</i>

248
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,541
<i>Hey, Taki.</i>

249
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,125
<i>Why did you disappear all of a sudden?</i>

250
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,166
<i>You're hiding somewhere, aren't you?</i>

251
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,416
<i>That's what I want to think.</i>

252
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,750
<i>If I don't,</i>

253
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:14,000
<i>the world with you in it</i>
<i>will feel like a dream.</i>

254
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,750
Whoa!

255
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,333
What were you dreaming about?

256
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,583
I… fell down the stairs.

257
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,791
It was so scary.

258
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,833
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

259
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,666
Was I sleeping?

260
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,416
You were completely out.

261
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,208
I'm glad that was just a dream.
That scared me.

262
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,125
You were scared? You scared me!

263
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,625
It happened at those stairs, seriously.

264
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,750
-Really?
-Yeah.

265
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,500
Did somebody push you?

266
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,208
-Not sure.
-You're not sure?

267
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,666
But I'm glad you're here, Taki.

268
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,291
It's okay. I'm right here.

269
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,833
It was so scary.

270
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,708
<i>I thought she would disappear one day.</i>

271
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,458
<i>Seeing her in all her glory,</i>
<i>that's what I always thought.</i>

272
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,500
<i>I'm sorry, Taki.</i>

273
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,666
<i>I lied to you back then.</i>

274
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,041
<i>The dream I really had was one</i>

275
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,125
<i>where you got eaten.</i>

276
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,625
{\an8}<i>Backpackers looking for something more</i>

277
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,333
{\an8}<i>I got angry and blew up</i>

278
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,708
<i>I don't expect any sudden changes</i>

279
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,333
<i>I know you're definitely coming</i>

280
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,708
<i>Bibbidi bobbidi boo</i>

281
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,458
<i>It's like a good luck charm</i>

282
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:56,333
<i>I still can't wait to go back</i>

283
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,125
<i>That feeling ran off somewhere</i>

284
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,791
<i>It's gotta be like this</i>
<i>It's gotta be like that</i>

285
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,541
<i>I'll get more and more impatient</i>

286
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:06,791
<i>I wanted someone to hold my hand tightly</i>

287
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,833
{\an8}<i>I don't know what warmth is</i>

288
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,833
<i>My heart's become poor</i>

289
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:17,000
<i>I'm wandering in the gray seas</i>

290
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,500
<i>The world's filled with beauty</i>

291
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,666
<i>Don't miss it</i>

292
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:26,666
<i>Come to your senses before the night ends</i>

293
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,583
<i>You don't have much time</i>

294
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,000
<i>I want to close my eyes</i>

295
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,916
<i>Boring days like these</i>

296
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,041
<i>You'll definitely want to overcome them</i>

297
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:39,583
<i>Until you hear what I have to say</i>
<i>I'll express my feelings</i>

298
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,458
<i>Until I'm aimlessly wandering around</i>

299
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,291
<i>We can't ever forget that</i>

300
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,958
<i>Never ever</i>

301
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,708
<i>Until we stop thinking altogether</i>

302
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,916
<i>Mad Hatter who starts dancing</i>
<i>Late at night</i>

303
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,541
<i>Before you know it, time has passed</i>

304
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,250
<i>I don't expect anything while daydreaming</i>

305
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,416
<i>I know you're definitely coming</i>

306
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,291
<i>I'll cry in the space between reality</i>

307
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,166
<i>With these feelings that rip up my insides</i>

308
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,791
<i>The words I swallowed sting</i>

309
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,041
<i>All that's left is the absurdity</i>

310
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:18,666
<i>My favorite forks and knives</i>
<i>Bring only supreme bliss</i>

311
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,250
<i>I wanted everyone to sit around the table</i>

312
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,458
<i>Thrusting that knife</i>

313
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,833
<i>Tearing your Adam's apple</i>

314
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,958
<i>My fingertips are moist</i>

315
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,708
<i>Nobody taught me</i>

316
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,750
<i>How to use a fork</i>

317
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,166
<i>I don't even try to look at the truth</i>

318
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,750
<i>I measured the weight of life</i>

319
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,125
<i>The center of the bonfire flickers</i>

320
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,375
<i>What did I see?</i>

321
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:23,166
<i>Come to your senses before the night ends</i>

322
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,666
<i>You don't have much time</i>

323
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,500
<i>I want to close my eyes</i>

324
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,500
<i>Boring days like these</i>

325
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,541
<i>You'll definitely want to overcome them</i>

326
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,833
<i>Until you hear…</i>

327
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,750
WE CAN'T EVER FORGET THAT

328
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,875
NEVER EVER

329
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,666
UNTIL WE STOP THINKING ALTOGETHER

330
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,250
<i>I'm can't believe I'm still alive</i>
<i>How many years is it now?</i>

331
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,541
<i>How many thousands of lies did I tell?</i>
<i>Like I was breathing</i>

332
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,041
<i>I'm blunt as I grovel on the floor</i>

333
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,791
<i>I'm getting so dizzy</i>

334
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:23,083
<i>Those heels, where are you going</i>
<i>With those flattened shoes?</i>

335
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:27,583
<i>Don't look at me in contempt</i>

336
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:32,708
<i>All by myself in this room</i>
<i>Soaked with cigarette smoke</i>

337
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:37,875
<i>The sunset is heartwrenching</i>
<i>It gets close to you</i>

338
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,541
<i>What I want to say right now</i>

339
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,875
<i>It hurts, this restless center of a flower</i>

340
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,416
<i>It's misery</i>
<i>The words that want to meet you</i>

341
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,541
<i>Find their way to photo reprinted memories</i>

342
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,458
<i>Waiting for the lonely stars</i>

343
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:57,291
<i>A young boy knowing he wants to be loved</i>

344
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:01,583
<i>If you look up to the night sky</i>
<i>Dance right now</i>

345
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:06,458
<i>Declare your goodbye until you beg</i>

346
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,875
<i>Waiting for the lonely stars</i>

347
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,791
<i>A young boy knowing he wants to be loved</i>

348
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,333
<i>The night becomes faint</i>

349
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,625
<i>Waiting for the lonely stars</i>

350
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:29,416
<i>A young boy knowing he wants to be loved</i>

351
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,750
<i>If you look up to the night sky</i>
<i>Dance right now</i>

352
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:40,166
<i>Declare your goodbye until you beg</i>

353
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,666
<i>I'm can't believe I'm still alive</i>
<i>How many years is it now?</i>

354
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,541
<i>But somehow I feel just fine</i>

355
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,416
-<i>Hey, Aki.</i>
-<i>Yeah?</i>

356
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,333
<i>Let's be together forever.</i>

357
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,833
Will you?

358
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:09,833
Start on one, two. Okay?

359
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:12,083
One, two is the signal.

360
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,833
One, two…

361
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,125
<i>I get the chills</i>

362
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,458
<i>when I hear Taki play the violin.</i>

363
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,916
<i>It's comfortable, so romantic.</i>

364
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,666
<i>But it also sounded lonely.</i>

365
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,625
<i>She'd sometimes say embarrassing things</i>

366
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,250
<i>but I would be thinking</i>
<i>the same things too.</i>

367
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:25,916
<i>Hey, Aki.</i>

368
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,416
<i>Are you glad you quit?</i>

369
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:35,333
We can play the violin
without being in the orchestra.

370
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,583
I'll quit too then.

371
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:41,708
What?

372
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:46,083
Let's practice here on the roof together.

373
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,250
It's more fun if it's just the two of us.

374
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:01,125
Thanks, Taki.

375
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:05,250
-It's settled then, yay!
-I'm so excited.

376
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,958
-I can't wait.
-Yeah.

377
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:34,666
<i>There's no way to save me</i>
<i>I was born and fell</i>

378
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:41,708
<i>There's a brave heartbeat cry</i>
<i>In this distorted heart shape</i>

379
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:46,833
<i>I won't turn around to this road of strife</i>

380
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:53,833
<i>Overcoming the seasons that dry up</i>
<i>I looked for the real truth</i>

381
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:56,208
<i>This wretched voice</i>

382
00:25:56,291 --> 00:26:01,083
<i>We're going to be driven out</i>
<i>From this world</i>

383
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:05,791
<i>Still, I prayed for tomorrow</i>

384
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:11,333
<i>You also sleep with sadness and loneliness</i>

385
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:16,958
<i>These tears are so beautiful</i>
<i>I want to touch you</i>

386
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:20,375
<i>If the moon hides</i>

387
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:24,916
<i>I can love you until the depths of tonight</i>

388
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:32,375
<i>That flame still flickers</i>

389
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,041
<i>So that it doesn't get dirty</i>

390
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,791
<i>So that it doesn't disappear</i>

391
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:44,750
<i>I want to hold onto the things I can't see</i>

392
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:50,750
<i>I wasn't wrong that day, that saving voice</i>

393
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:57,458
<i>It was lost in this bloodied story</i>

394
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:59,208
<i>Colored by this dark night</i>

395
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:03,875
<i>Nevertheless, I continue to walk forth</i>

396
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:09,500
<i>You're not alone anymore</i>

397
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:18,750
<i>How long are you going to be tormented</i>
<i>By your foolishness?</i>

398
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:24,375
<i>But if it hurts and is a neverending night</i>

399
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:27,791
<i>I'm sure you won't suspect it</i>

400
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:32,583
<i>I can love this cursed world</i>

401
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:37,291
<i>I'm burdened by it all now</i>

402
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:40,541
<i>We'll get it back</i>

403
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:47,291
<i>It's like I was having a bad dream, Taki.</i>

404
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:52,541
<i>But whenever I woke up from a dream,</i>
<i>you were always there.</i>

405
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:54,083
<i>I had a weird dream last night.</i>

406
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:57,333
<i>Yeah, I have dreams where</i>
<i>I'm looking for things too.</i>

407
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:06,541
<i>Taki, I want you back here.</i>

408
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,625
<i>Start on one, two. Okay?</i>

409
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,958
<i>One, two is the signal.</i>

410
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:20,375
<i>The lights are changing.</i>
<i>Please do not rush to cross.</i>

411
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:24,791
<i>Please do not rush to cross.</i>

412
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,583
<i>I knew it and lamented over it</i>

413
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,166
<i>I laughed at the way I laid down</i>

414
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,875
<i>I don't know what love or loneliness is</i>

415
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:53,833
<i>I threw away my human shell</i>

416
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:59,291
<i>I can't embrace this</i>
<i>This identity full of empty words</i>

417
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,500
<i>I can't get out of this small box</i>

418
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,041
<i>Before I knew it, I wanted to escape</i>

419
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,625
<i>We all played our parts</i>

420
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:06,625
<i>Heading toward the end credits</i>

421
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:13,083
<i>Try your best to play your part</i>
<i>There are no bystanders here</i>

422
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,666
<i>I don't want to think about it</i>

423
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,333
<i>I just want to be dumb</i>

424
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:21,875
<i>I can't ever become anybody</i>

425
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:24,416
<i>That's why I'm standing on the front lines</i>

426
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,000
<i>Waving that flag nice and high</i>

427
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,791
<i>It's inferior</i>
<i>It's a partner you can rely on</i>

428
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,791
<i>I don't even need any words</i>

429
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:34,916
<i>Any dramatic turn of events</i>
<i>Will result in a Dot Heat</i>

430
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,291
<i>You say yes, yes, take a breath</i>

431
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,791
<i>Swear you'll see me again</i>

432
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,416
<i>I only got one chance</i>

433
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,666
<i>Place our bets on that one moment</i>

434
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:49,000
<i>My hands sweat like it's the climax</i>

435
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,250
<i>Standing alone, crying out</i>

436
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:55,000
<i>That truth I hid is nowhere to be found</i>

437
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:58,125
<i>People who sneered at me have no place</i>

438
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:01,083
<i>Remembering it so casually</i>
<i>There's no feelings</i>

439
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,666
<i>Tears that fall have no reason</i>

440
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,458
<i>Kindness can't feel any warmth</i>

441
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:11,000
<i>A hand that's stretched out</i>
<i>There's nothing but doubt</i>

442
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:14,333
<i>A hole opens with love dripping out</i>

443
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:17,083
<i>You take a peek at me falling down</i>

444
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:20,250
<i>Right in front of a person</i>
<i>Who's about to give up</i>

445
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:23,583
<i>You're there, laughing at me</i>

446
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:26,416
<i>What does it look like to you?</i>

447
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,291
<i>Just breathe, all right, all right</i>

448
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:35,625
<i>I can't ever become anybody</i>

449
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,458
<i>We're fighting each other now</i>

450
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:39,958
<i>It's overtime, surrender now</i>

451
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,666
<i>Mayday! I'm slightly fond of you</i>

452
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,291
<i>Dripping with words of love and hate</i>

453
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:48,916
<i>I bet you're hoping for</i>
<i>A dramatic turn of events</i>

454
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,250
<i>You say yes, yes, take a breath</i>

455
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:54,458
<i>The directions are over there</i>
<i>Headshot! Thoughts clamor in my mind</i>

456
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:56,958
<i>Shoot out that heart</i>

457
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,916
<i>Pull that string you don't see</i>

458
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,583
<i>It's time for the puppeteer to come out</i>

459
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:07,083
<i>What's reflected in those eyes?</i>

460
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:15,125
I shared my playlist with you.

461
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,500
It's really good. I like sharing my music.

462
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,208
Thanks.

463
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:22,708
Do you listen to this a lot?

464
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:25,458
Yeah. On a loop.

465
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:28,208
Lately I've been listening to
"Last Dance."

466
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:30,166
-"Last Dance?"
-It's a great song.

467
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,083
I see.

468
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,875
What songs do you like?

469
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,000
Uh…

470
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,708
I've been listening to "As You Like It."

471
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:37,750
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

472
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,166
So you are listening to it.

473
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,291
Yeah, I mean, you have been too.

474
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,958
-Did you memorize it?
-Yeah.

475
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:46,041
What else? Oh, "Heart Forecast."

476
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,208
-They're all good, I can't pick one.
-You're right.

477
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:49,541
Listen to all of them.

478
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,125
I'll listen to "Last Dance."

479
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:53,208
Yeah, we can dance to it.

480
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,708
<i>This city is overgrown with skyscrapers</i>

481
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:20,208
<i>I nipped what was sure</i>
<i>About you in the bud</i>

482
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:23,541
<i>You can't take everything I want</i>

483
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:24,916
<i>Distorting me</i>

484
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,541
<i>My sense of values are different</i>
<i>From that person I hate</i>

485
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:28,875
<i>We can laugh at the absurdity</i>

486
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:31,500
<i>Lay on some pretty words</i>
<i>Wait for it, rush for it, struggle for it</i>

487
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:34,500
<i>Diligently exploit the wisdom</i>
<i>Diligently become greedy</i>

488
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,458
<i>Crash deep into your ego</i>

489
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:49,166
<i>You told me they were expendable</i>

490
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,500
<i>But I'm still thinking about them</i>

491
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:54,958
<i>Maybe one day again</i>

492
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,166
<i>You'll dance for me like this</i>

493
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,958
<i>Tinged with irritation</i>
<i>Young boys and girls</i>

494
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:03,083
<i>Distracted, the yes-man patient</i>

495
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:05,750
<i>Nobody's anything</i>

496
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:08,500
<i>If you know the true meaning</i>
<i>It may be the end for you</i>

497
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:11,250
<i>Let's talk until our tongues are dry</i>

498
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,708
<i>I put up a front and lost myself</i>

499
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:27,458
<i>I told lies and became an illusion</i>

500
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:30,041
<i>I'll be dumb and fly through the air</i>

501
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:33,666
<i>Then I break down</i>

502
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,291
<i>Pure and clear young boy</i>

503
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,916
<i>You do it under the spell of your feelings</i>

504
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,625
<i>Remember and think about it</i>

505
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:44,000
<i>You won't get to where you need to go</i>

506
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:56,208
<i>The true meaning you talked about</i>

507
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:58,875
<i>I'll think about it</i>
<i>In the corner of the world</i>

508
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:01,375
<i>Those now cold lies</i>

509
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:04,041
<i>If you can melt them for me</i>

510
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,000
<i>A talented person that knows loneliness</i>

511
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:10,375
<i>And a melancholy patient choose tomorrow</i>

512
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,583
<i>Saying goodbye to me, who can never return</i>

513
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:15,833
<i>Add your fingers</i>
<i>But don't cry, it's no use</i>

514
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:18,041
<i>Maybe one day again</i>

515
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:26,416
<i>Taki, I finally remember now.</i>

516
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:31,958
<i>You and I have been having the same dream.</i>

517
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:37,000
And I saw a one-eyed monster
looking back at me.

518
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,083
One-eyed?

519
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:39,083
One-eyed.

520
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:41,666
<i>Dream… One-eyed…</i>

521
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,375
<i>I saw a dream and in that dream…</i>

522
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,666
<i>It was in my dream…</i>

523
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,500
<i>Then, before I knew it,</i>
<i>that one-eyed thing got closer.</i>

524
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:55,416
-<i>That's so scary.</i>
-<i>It was just staring at me.</i>

525
00:34:56,166 --> 00:35:00,083
<i>Then I realized it was just a dream.</i>

526
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:01,875
<i>Then I…</i>

527
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,208
<i>There's no love</i>
<i>Nothing you can do about it</i>

528
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:23,833
<i>I'm laughing at that hoarse voice</i>

529
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,875
<i>Relying on this unreliable talent</i>

530
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,583
<i>Dampening the night with my cries</i>

531
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:29,416
<i>It's the same</i>
<i>No matter how many years pass</i>

532
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,375
<i>Somehow it rises to the surface</i>

533
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:33,416
<i>Binding these thoughts of nobody</i>

534
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,625
<i>A rendezvous into the evening</i>

535
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:39,041
<i>Drunk and wandering about</i>
<i>In nameless and pointless days</i>

536
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:43,041
<i>Just how many words have made you suffer?</i>

537
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:46,125
<i>These feelings are in a jam</i>
<i>This discomfort is pretty simple</i>

538
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:50,166
<i>I'm the worst existence ever</i>
<i>Don't overlook anything</i>

539
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:57,208
<i>Drowning in dizziness like I'm in love</i>

540
00:35:57,291 --> 00:36:03,958
<i>Howling with rage</i>

541
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:07,541
<i>Raise your voice at the end</i>

542
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,750
<i>Can I still do this?</i>
<i>This body might fall apart at anytime</i>

543
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:14,666
<i>I don't care about your talent</i>

544
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,166
<i>Can't you just leave me alone?</i>

545
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,666
<i>This flag flies without bending</i>

546
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:25,416
<i>What I want is for you to accept me</i>

547
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:36,375
<i>The flames burned me beyond recovery</i>
<i>And they surrounded me</i>

548
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,750
<i>"Don't try this at home, kids"</i>

549
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:39,833
<i>That's how I was dealt with</i>

550
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:41,833
<i>That's right, they're all idiots</i>

551
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:44,083
<i>They wave their stupid sense of justice</i>

552
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,791
<i>They can't come back or drop dead</i>

553
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,666
<i>The eyes of a brilliant clown that laughs</i>

554
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:54,291
<i>If you just swallow up those thoughts</i>

555
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,833
<i>Those voices</i>
<i>Will go farther and farther away</i>

556
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,916
<i>Those expectations and ideals</i>

557
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,291
<i>You're still cursed now</i>

558
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:05,666
<i>That's why even if you fall</i>
<i>At the ends of the world</i>

559
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,916
<i>You'll still be alive in my eyes</i>

560
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,541
<i>Draw a picture in your mind</i>
<i>From now until forever</i>

561
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,333
<i>There's no love</i>
<i>Nothing you can do about it</i>

562
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:19,166
<i>I'm laughing at that hoarse voice</i>

563
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,125
<i>Relying on this unreliable talent</i>

564
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,791
<i>Dampening the night with my cries</i>

565
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:24,708
<i>It's the same</i>
<i>No matter how many years pass</i>

566
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:26,333
<i>Somehow it rises to the surface</i>

567
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:28,333
<i>Binding these thoughts of nobody</i>

568
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:30,333
<i>A rendezvous into the evening</i>

569
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:36,541
<i>I pray the near future will become</i>
<i>A bright long and far away future</i>

570
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:39,500
<i>It doesn't look like I can keep</i>

571
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:43,875
<i>The promise I made to you</i>

572
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:48,000
<i>Words are like breathing</i>

573
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:51,333
<i>They connect wishes</i>

574
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:57,583
<i>I'm sorry, mom and dad</i>

575
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:00,583
<i>I couldn't be what you wanted</i>

576
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:13,083
I'm gonna kill you all!

577
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,958
<i>Raise your voice at the end</i>

578
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:21,041
<i>Can I still do this?</i>
<i>This body might fall apart at anytime</i>

579

587
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:49,458
<i>Draw a picture in your mind</i>

588
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:09,958
<i>Draw a picture in your mind</i>

598
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:27,875
<i>A rendezvous into the evening</i>

599
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,041
<i>A rendezvous into the evening</i>

600
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:32,041
<i>A rendezvous into the evening</i>

601
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:39,083
<i>A rendezvous into the evening</i>

602
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:59,083
<i>Take us to the deepest parts of the heart</i>

603
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:02,208
<i>Extend your hand out to me</i>

604
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:05,916
<i>So that you can bring me to tomorrow</i>

605
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,500
<i>I know now it's okay to be here</i>

606
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:35,416
<i>I think you can still say it now</i>

607
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:39,666
<i>Aki.</i>

608
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:41,541
<i>Aki.</i>

609
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:05,000
<i>Aki…</i>

610
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:22,250
<i>One, two. One, two…</i>

611
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:26,000
<i>One, two. One, two.</i>

612
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:29,791
<i>One, two. One, two…</i>

613
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:32,500
I jumped off.

614
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,500
<i>Aki…</i>

615
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:54,916
<i>The blur of the masses in shapes of people</i>

616
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,333
<i>Bluffs, mental images, inhuman</i>
<i>Like vengeful ghosts</i>

617
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:00,375
<i>An open-minded frankness lives here</i>

618
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:03,583
<i>And the rest, empty humans</i>

619
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:05,708
<i>Expectations made, life is unfair</i>

620
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:08,791
<i>The unusual is a Great Vehicle</i>
<i>With no talents</i>

621
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:10,666
<i>Treating friends and enemies alike</i>
<i>Lacking individuality</i>

622
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:14,541
<i>The memories that come to me</i>
<i>Have no place at all</i>

623
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:17,166
<i>Don't cry in between dreams</i>

624
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,583
<i>You know what expression</i>
<i>You should have on your face</i>

625
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:23,416
<i>But keep on doing it</i>

626
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,916
<i>Cleanse the darkness, cleanse the darkness</i>

627
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,666
<i>When the curtain of night falls</i>
<i>That's the signal</i>

628
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,708
<i>Confront this circular game</i>

629
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:33,666
<i>Spit out these lies</i>

630
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,375
<i>Don't stop yet, don't stop yet</i>

631
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:40,208
<i>Be smarter than anybody else</i>
<i>Be your true form where you were born</i>

632
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:45,416
<i>Create our future that's still cursed</i>

633
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:49,708
<i>Run, fall, hold on to the pain</i>
<i>That never disappears</i>

634
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:54,000
<i>The world is waiting for this moment</i>

635
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:04,500
<i>These lyrical feelings shake</i>
<i>Like a computer bug</i>

636
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:07,500
<i>Punishment for these defects are obedient</i>

637
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:10,708
<i>There's uncertainty</i>
<i>To love with no choice but to defend it</i>

638
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,208
<i>I can't say anything at all</i>

639
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:14,875
<i>Veritable pandemonium of puppet vows</i>

640
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:17,458
<i>The end is linked together</i>

641
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:20,791
<i>A peaceful death rejects reality</i>
<i>And calms down</i>

642
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:23,541
<i>Don't throw away your life</i>

643
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,750
<i>Immerse in your inner fragility</i>

644
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:29,375
<i>You don't know what expression</i>
<i>You should have on your face</i>

645
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:32,000
<i>But keep on doing it</i>

646
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,666
<i>Release the Five Virtues</i>
<i>Release the Five Virtues</i>

647
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,208
<i>Ideas that assemble unsure voices</i>

648
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:39,375
<i>Counterbalance these revolving emotions</i>

649
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:42,250
<i>Raise your hand to the destination</i>

650
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:44,875
<i>Chase after it, chase after it</i>

651
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:49,250
<i>Pray to live more than anybody else</i>
<i>It's your life</i>

652
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,458
<i>You're at the gloomy depths of the night</i>

653
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:54,833
<i>Fall deep, deep inside</i>

654
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:15,041
<i>Do I look so ugly?</i>

655
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:17,166
<i>This is me right now</i>

656
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:22,166
<i>I'm a corpse that can't become anybody</i>
<i>So laugh at me</i>

657
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:27,083
<i>I stopped running</i>
<i>From everything in front of me</i>

658
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:31,666
<i>Repeating the same images</i>
<i>Running toward my imagination</i>

659
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,291
<i>Cleanse the darkness, cleanse the darkness</i>

660
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,833
<i>When the curtain of night falls</i>
<i>That's the signal</i>

661
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:39,125
<i>Confront this circular game</i>

662
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:42,291
<i>Spit out these lies</i>

663
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:44,666
<i>Don't stop yet, don't stop yet</i>

664
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:48,833
<i>Be smarter than anybody else</i>
<i>Be your true form where you were born</i>

665
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:53,916
<i>Create our future that's still cursed</i>

666
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,291
<i>Run, fall, hold on to the pain</i>
<i>That never disappears</i>

667
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:02,458
<i>The world is waiting for this moment</i>

668
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:14,291
…<i>Two, one, two.</i>

669
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:17,416
<i>One, two, one, two…</i>

670
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,250
<i>-I had a weird dream last night.</i>
<i>-…Where I'm looking for things.</i>

671
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:21,625
<i>You were sleeping for a while.</i>

672
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:23,416
<i>I realized it was just a dream</i>
<i>and I jumped off.</i>

673
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,250
<i>What were you dreaming about?</i>
<i>I shared it with you.</i>

674
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:26,625
<i>If I jumped off… On a loop.</i>

675
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:29,000
<i>-Wondering when you'll wake up.</i>
<i>-I'm glad you're here, Taki.</i>

676
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:31,291
<i>It's okay. I'm right here.</i>

677
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:33,625
<i>Let's be together forever.</i>

678
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:37,750
<i>Apple.</i>

679
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:40,750
<i>Elephant.</i>

680
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:42,250
<i>One, two, one, two…</i>

681
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:43,458
<i>Terrier.</i>

682
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,166
<i>Room.</i>

683
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,291
<i>Maracas.</i>

684
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,083
<i>Squash.</i>

685
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:55,375
<i>Start on one, two. Okay?</i>

686
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,250
<i>Hamster.</i>

687
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,750
<i>One, two is the signal.</i>

688
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:03,750
<i>Rhythm.</i>

689
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,000
<i>One, two.</i>

690
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:26,916
I got you apple tea, okay?

691
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:32,250
Thanks.

692
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:36,583
What's the matter, Aki?

693
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:40,000
You're here but you're not here.

694
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:42,916
I jumped off.

695
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,500
What?

696
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:49,083
You went to get refills
and never came back.

697
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:51,583
What's that? Sounds so real.

698
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:54,958
Then I ran around looking for you.

699
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:56,875
Then what happened?

700
00:48:56,958 --> 00:49:01,458
Then these one-eyed people?

701
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:06,541
That's the dream I was just talking about.

702
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:08,916
Yeah…

703
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:12,708
That's funny. You're easily influenced.

704
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:13,833
But it's true.

705
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:17,166
I was really running around
looking for you.

706
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,541
-I see.
-Yeah.

707
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:21,125
You must be tired.

708
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:24,333
I am… It was a tiring dream.

709
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:26,083
-I can imagine.
-Yeah.

710
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:29,083
Let's get some good food to eat then.

711
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,916
Yeah, let's.

712
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,166
What should we eat?

713
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:33,750
I'm not sure.

714
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,291
Something savory would be nice.

715
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:38,041
What do you want to eat?

716
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:39,958
An <i>omurice</i>.

717
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:41,833
An <i>omurice</i>? Yeah, let's get that.

718
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:44,166
-We can split it.
-Yeah, good idea.

719
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,666
Anything else?

720
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,375
Not sure…

721
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:48,500
Let's order first.

722
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:49,875
Good idea.

723
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:57,166
<i>We'll spend our lives together</i>
<i>from now on.</i>

724
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:03,041
<i>And share one thing between the two of us.</i>

725
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:06,583
<i>Ready, set…</i>

726
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:08,083
<i>One, two.</i>

727
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:25,166
<i>Dig up this blue that's bloomed</i>

728
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:27,083
<i>This previously divided rendezvous</i>

729
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:29,166
<i>With this plain design language of flowers</i>

730
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,875
<i>I just wanna take it easy</i>
<i>The moment we connected</i>

731
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,708
<i>A sweet lack of consumption</i>

732
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:35,666
<i>Every night I think of those memories</i>

733
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,416
<i>A real neverending motion</i>

734
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,000
<i>In the end, it's an anniversary birthday</i>

735
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:42,166
<i>Even if I'm nude</i>

736
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,333
<i>Nobody will see anything</i>

737
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:48,416
<i>Even if I speak words</i>
<i>They're shallow and distressed</i>

738
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,166
<i>The highway in my dreams</i>

739
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:55,000
<i>I want to expose its warm, cold, gray form</i>

740
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:59,375
<i>It's like I saw it in a dream</i>
<i>Save me from this world</i>

741
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:00,833
<i>It's okay, I'm useless</i>

742
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:03,250
<i>But it's no joke, let's plunge forward</i>

743
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:06,875
<i>As long as I live, the voice</i>
<i>In the last chapter will melt away</i>

744
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:09,041
<i>Let me hear this mundane night</i>

745
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:12,250
<i>Remember those regrets you tell</i>

746
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,083
<i>Don't replay the boredom</i>

747
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:17,083
<i>Don't replay the boredom</i>

748
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:18,791
<i>Don't replay the boredom</i>

749
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:22,125
<i>As long as I live</i>
<i>The voice of love and hate will melt away</i>

750
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:24,916
<i>With this child-like blue hand</i>

751
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,375
<i>Remember those songs that feel</i>

752
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:33,791
<i>Tomorrow, just nod your head</i>
<i>And wander over there</i>

753
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:36,708
<i>Inviting us to the evening, mellow</i>

754
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:41,750
<i>But you're not settled like this</i>

755
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:44,583
<i>In this restless step, yellow</i>

756
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,083
INHUMAN CONSULTATION

757
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:51,291
CHASE THE MYSTERY
OF THE MYSTERIOUS MASKED PLAY

758
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:02,583
{\an8}<i>If it's the same as before</i>

759
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:04,750
<i>You won't gain anything from it</i>

760
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:09,208
<i>Even if I speak words</i>
<i>They're shallow and distressed</i>

761
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,500
<i>The highway in my dreams</i>

762
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:15,625
<i>I want to expose</i>
<i>Its lonely, hurtful fantasy</i>

763
00:52:15,708 --> 00:52:19,958
{\an8}<i>If I still face forward tomorrow</i>

764
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:21,500
{\an8}<i>It's okay, I won't win</i>

765
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:23,958
<i>But it's no problem, let's plunge forward</i>

766
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:27,541
<i>As long as I live</i>
<i>I'll laugh crazily with no answers</i>

767
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:29,500
<i>Let me hear this mundane night</i>

768
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:33,708

<i>Don't replay the boredom</i>

772
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:50,458
<i>Don't end it just yet</i>

773
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:07,208
<i>It's like I saw it in a dream</i>
<i>Save me from this world</i>

774
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:08,708
<i>It's okay, I'm useless</i>

775
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:11,000
