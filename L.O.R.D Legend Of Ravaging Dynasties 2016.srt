00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,833
<i>My name is Asbel,</i>

4
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,166
<i>and in my dreams…</i>

5
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,958
<i>I used to fly.</i>

6
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:48,500
<i>I dreamed about</i>
<i>how this world began.</i>

7
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,500
<i>I dreamed of the void,</i>

8
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,375
<i>of chaos and silence.</i>

9
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,375
<i>I dreamed of a golden flame,</i>

10
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:05,208
<i>flashing in the darkness</i>
<i>like a torch in the forest,</i>

11
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:10,208
<i>creating life…</i>
<i>creating the universe.</i>

12
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,583
<i>But my world is a cruel place</i>

13
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,625
<i>ruled by Spirit Power.</i>

14
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:18,291
<i>A world of killing and war</i>
<i>and conspiracy…</i>

15
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:22,083
<i>where everything is paid for</i>
<i>with blood and corpses.</i>

16
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,416
<i>Now I no longer dream.</i>

17
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,125
<i>But there are still some nights</i>
<i>when I find myself</i>

18
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,208
<i>jolted awake by nightmares,</i>

19
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:34,750
<i>terrified for my younger,</i>
<i>simpler self.</i>

20
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:40,458
<i>Back then, I was joyful</i>
<i>and carefree…</i>

21
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:44,666
<i>until the night I collided</i>
<i>with my destiny.</i>

22
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,250
Hey!

23
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,083
Hey, watch it!

24
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,958
-Excuse me!
-Watch it!

25
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,750
Whoo!

26
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,458
Whoop. Sorry!

27
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,416
Hey. Hey!
Cut that out, kid!

28
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,375
You don't want to get in trouble
with the High Lords!

29
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,458
Oh, please!
The High Lords are like gods, dude!

30
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,166
You think they've got time
for little old me?

31
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,875
I got everything
you put on the list,

32
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,875
but I think
you ordered too much.

33
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,541
Who do you think's actually
gonna eat all this stuff?

34
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,833
It's too cold for tourists…

35
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,958
but it's pretty hot in here.

36
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,041
This is pretty good.
Try it.

37
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,708
It's marvelous.
What is it?

38
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,500
Uh… it's a special tea

39
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,000
from Fuze.

40
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,875
Hey, there.

41
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,000
May I ask,
are you Spirit Warriors?

42
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,500
Why'd you say that?

43
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,458
The clothes
kind of give it away.

44
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,166
Folks around here,

45
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,958
most of them don't tend
to dress like that.

46
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,958
We're from Glanort,
the capital.

47
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,625
That guy over there
is my brother, Shen.

48
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,458
Aeron's my name.

49
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,000
Your brother,
is he a Duke, maybe?

50
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,041
Hmm. I'm afraid not.

51
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,375
That's the highest level
of Spirit Warrior.

52
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,791
There are only seven Dukes
in the whole country.

53
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,500
The chances of
running into them,

54
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,291
it's not like you'll
bump into one on the street.

55
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,833
Oh, wow.

56
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,250
Tell me, I'm curious.

57
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,375
Why'd you guys come here?

58
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,750
We arrived here
on a mission…

59
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,000
to hunt a Spirit Beast.

60
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,708
Oh, cool!

61
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,875
-Hmm.
-What do they actually look like?

62
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,833
Like a…

63
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,541
It's so powerful--
much more than we thought!

64
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,208
-Let's move!
-Move now!

65
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,875
I can face you alone,
Ice Fang.

66
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:23,041
Silver,
Loyal Duke Seven…

67
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,833
your Disciple has finally
manifested himself.

68
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,916
Find him at once.

69
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,125
Lady Nox,
Loyal Duke Four,

70
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,500
your mission is
to assist Dark, Duke Two,

71
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:57,250
in his hunt for Duke Five,
along with his Disciple.

72
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,958
Yes, my High Lord.

73
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,875
But why are we hunting
a fellow Duke?

74
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,083
Treason.

75
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,708
It's the Wraith Mirror.

76
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,333
Your Blood Weapon.

77
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,208
Take a look
at your reflection.

78
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,708
Fitting end for treason.

79
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,375
You're awake.

80
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,541
Come with me.

81
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,791
Wait. Dude,
why would I ever do that?

82
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,250
I don't even know you.

83
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,291
So…
where we goin'?

84
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,708
To Glanort.

85
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,125
The capital?
I've never been there before.

86
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,958
Wait a minute. Are you
some kind of slave trafficker?

87
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:31,291
Uh, you're not
gonna kill me?

88
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,458
No. I'm protecting you.

89
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,666
Well, okay.

90
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,750
The thing is, I've never even
been away from home.

91
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,541
And now you want me to leave,
leave everything behind,

92
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,791
and go with some stranger?
That's crazy talk.

93
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,666
Crazy or not,
your past life is over.

94
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,166
From now on, you will
become my Disciple.

95
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,333
I'm your Disciple?

96
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,000
My successor.

97
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,916
Like, I'm in your will?

98
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,666
The sun is getting to you.

99
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,333
I'm going to test your capacity
for Spirit Power.

100
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,250
Relax.

101
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,791
Inside your body.
It's there.

102
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,458
Let it happen.

103
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,625
What… did you do to me?

104
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,666
Stay back.

105
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,208
I conferred a Seal on you.

106
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:58,041
You might want
to keep your distance.

107
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,041
Why is that?

108
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:03,458
Because once I show you this,

109
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:07,166
you'll find you won't…

110
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,833
be able to… resist.

111
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:14,416
Uh… I'm sorry, man,

112
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,833
I don't think so.

113
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,625
You're not really my type.

114
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,541
Whoa! Hold on!
Didn't you hear me?

115
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,291
You are so not my--

116
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,208
Whoa!

117
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,333
This is my Soul Loop.

118
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,333
And now it is yours, too.

119
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:50,333
The center, where the lines converge,
is the mark of a Duke.

120
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,333
Every Duke has one Disciple,

121
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,875
and as soon as he finds one

122
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,041
he must bring him
back to Glanort

123
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,291
and grant him the same
Soul Loop and Seal.

124
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,208
You are now my Disciple.

125
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,958
Understand?

126
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:17,041
So if you had to give me
that Soul Loop thing,

127
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,083
why out here?

128
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,625
We're in the middle of nowhere.

129
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,166
Because if I hadn't,
you'd be dead.

130
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,208
-What?
-You recently encountered

131
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,625
a Spirit Beast
which entered your body.

132
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,875
If I hadn't sealed you in time,

133
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,250
Ice Fang would have killed you.

134
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,458
The lion is now present inside you.

135
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,000
It is locked quietly within.

136
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,166
It is in your mark.
Got it?

137
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,666
Oh. Yeah.

138
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,000
Uh, but wait.

139
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,166
Are-- Are you saying-

140
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,916
You gotta be kidding me!

141
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,541
I've got a lion up my ass?!

142
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,250
You could say that.

143
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,333
<i>Drawing Spirit Power from the Seal</i>

144
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,625
<i>and controlling it</i>
<i>with our Soul Loop</i>

145
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:05,500
<i>gives us a range</i>
<i>of superhuman abilities.</i>

146
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:09,708
<i>Strength, speed, rebirth,</i>
<i>resistance.</i>

147
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:13,291
<i>Also our Spirit Power</i>
<i>can converge with the elements--</i>

148
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:17,125
<i>water, wind, soil, and fire.</i>

149
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,750
<i>Their energy can be harnessed</i>
<i>for our use in special attacks.</i>

150
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,041
This is my Spirit Beast--
Scorpion.

151
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,375
-We are inside its jaws.
-Really?

152
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,333
What sort of animal is it?

153
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,708
A scorpion.

154
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,916
<i>We summon</i>
<i>our Spirit Beasts to fight</i>

155
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,250
<i>by channeling our Spirit Power.</i>

156
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,958
<i>Ice Fang has great control</i>
<i>over ice and snow.</i>

157
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:34,208
<i>From him, you can learn</i>
<i>the manipulation of water.</i>

158
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,791
Let's do it.

159
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,958
<i>Each Duke and Disciple</i>
<i>have twin Soul Loops.</i>

160
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,583
<i>As a result, they develop</i>
<i>a deep bond of loyalty</i>

161
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,666
<i>and faithfulness between them.</i>

162
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,041
<i>But at the beginning,</i>
<i>this bond feels more like…</i>

163
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,250
<i>a bit of a crush.</i>

164
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:24,625
You were right--
it <i>is </i>hard to take my eyes off you.

165
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,791
Did your mom ever tell you
you're kind of smokin' hot?

166
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,291
Tomorrow we'll go
to the Spirit Cave

167
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,416
so you can find your own
unique Blood Weapon.

168
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,041
Spirit Cave?

169
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,333
Sounds like a spooky tomb.

170
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,208
-Do we have to?
-Yes, we do.

171
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,791
The Spirit Cave
is in Ryen Strait.

172
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,875
That's where
the Blood Weapons are grown.

173
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,541
If they grow there,
surely there's like, I don't know,

174
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,041
a million people
trying to get them, right?

175
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,791
Only Disciples
can enter the cave.

176
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:29,125
What?

177
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,291
So, what sort of stuff
do we need?

178
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,166
Water? Food?

179
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,916
Hey, do Disciples need
to cook for their Dukes?

180
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:40,583
The innkeeper tells me
I can't even boil hot water.

181
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,750
Sorry.

182
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:09,666
Hey, Silver. Your father,
was he a Duke, too?

183
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,958
I never actually knew my father.

184
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,791
I'm an orphan.

185
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,875
Me as well.

186
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:22,583
My father was killed by a wolf
when I was nine.

187
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,666
Mom cried for
three days straight,

188
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,833
but on the fourth, quietly got up
and jumped into a well.

189
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:32,666
Guess we were destined
to find each other.

190
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:34,458
So, who are you?

191
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:36,375
And what do you want?

192
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:40,791
My name is Aeron.

193
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:44,041
-I'm here to kill you.
-Do you know who I am?

194
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:50,208
Of course. Lotus,
Disciple of the traitor, Duke Five.

195
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:53,291
I'm a Disciple, too.

196
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:57,083
My Duke is Dark -- Duke Two.
I'm stronger than you are.

197
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:59,625
-But why kill me?
-Don't pretend you don't know.

198
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:02,666
-And my Duke--
-He's with Dark.

199
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,250
I'll kill you,
and my Duke kills yours.

200
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:10,333
I'd tell you this won't hurt,

201
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:13,083
but that'd make me a liar.

202
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,541
Ready?

203
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,875
My Lord.

204
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,541
What a city!

205
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,125
Uh, what's that?

206
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,916
It's the Fruit of Hisya.

207
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,875
From the High Lords--
the ones we serve.

208
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:16,916
Open your eyes
and make sure you don't move.

209
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,416
Don't worry.

210
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,583
Come on.

211
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:32,208
What?

212
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,958
Oh, man!

213
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,083
It's the Golden Mist,

214
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:52,125
which comes from
our Spirit Power.

215
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:56,750
The Fruit of Hisya
let's you see it.

216
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:59,250
The mist is everywhere
in Ashland.

217
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:03,375
<i>It surrounds all life</i>
<i>in varying concentrations.</i>

218
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:07,625
<i>And it can heal those like us--</i>
<i>Dukes and Disciples.</i>

219
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:11,750
<i>There are two places with the highest</i>
<i>concentration of Golden Mist.</i>

220
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,666
<i>One is the Spirit Cave</i>

221
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,875
<i>which breeds powerful</i>
<i>Blood Weapons.</i>

222
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:19,875
<i>The other is the Abyss Corridor</i>
<i>where many Spirit Beasts live.</i>

223
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:24,500
<i>Legend says that</i>
<i>in the Abyss Corridor</i>

224
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:27,916
<i>there is a golden lake</i>
<i>solely generated by Golden Mist.</i>

225
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:47,416
My Lord, it is I.

226
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:52,166
<i>Come to me.</i>

227
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,125
I'm going to need your help.

228
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:07,416
Get me to the Golden Lake.

229
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:23,583
Is it always this busy here?

230
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:25,458
There's a big parade today.

231
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:27,166
Oh, cool.

232
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,291
Okay if I go check it out?

233
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,208
Please, can I?

234
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:38,083
I've never seen anything like that
before in my life.

235
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,875
All right.

236
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:42,333
I can explain how to enter
the Spirit Cave later.

237
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:44,041
Yes!

238
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:47,166
Hold on.

239
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:56,833
Are they for me?

240
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:02,958
This is excellent.

241
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:11,916
Hey, won't you get bored
staying here on your own?

242
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,250
Do you maybe
want to come with me?

243
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:19,583
Don't worry.
I'm used to solitude.

244
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:24,833
I'll be fine.
I'll still be here… when you return.

245
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:27,416
-Go have fun.
-'Kay.

246
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,750
Want some fun?
Doesn't cost much.

247
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:16,125
-Stay here!
-No, no.

248
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:51,000
Quiet, now.

249
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:24,041
Can you go bigger?

250
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,750
Help me impress everyone.

251
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:35,666
Even bigger.

252
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,291
Even bigger.

253
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:03,791
Well, that was awkward.

254
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:08,500
Beautiful!

255
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,833
Excuse me!

256
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:13,541
Young man.

257
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:15,875
You from around here?

258
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,833
I've never seen a Spirit Beast
like yours, and I--

259
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:23,000
-It's okay.
-I don't mean any harm!

260
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:26,166
I work for the Tenso family,
the noblest in Glanort.

261
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,333
We're seeking a suitable match
for young Princess Kira.

262
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,291
Someone who will impress.

263
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:34,833
And looking at you,
you might just fit the bill.

264
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:37,250
Uh… a match?

265
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,166
You mean, like,
as in marriage?

266
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,000
But I'm… eighteen!

267
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:42,541
That's a perfect age.

268
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:44,666
Our princess
is sixteen years old.

269
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,125
No, I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

270
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:52,375
Um… I'm way too busy.

271
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,416
Let's go.

272
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,625
What's going on?

273
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:06,208
What's going on?

274
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,375
No one turns me down.

275
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,458
Princess Kira.

276
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,041
That guy--
who was he?

277
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,375
-So, you're a Disciple, too.
-How'd you know that?

278
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,708
This place leads
to the Spirit Cave.

279
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:32,958
Only Dukes and Disciples
can get through the wall.

280
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:35,916
Yeah.
Oh, I'm Disciple Seven Asbel.

281
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,208
And I don't give a damn
who you are. Be quiet.

282
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:45,333
Take it easy! There's really
no need for that!

283
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,375
You.

284
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:57,625
Where is he?

285
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,458
Wait, wait!
I don't wanna fight!

286
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:36,166
My name's Asbel.

287
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,166
I won't hurt you.
I kinda got here by accident.

288
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,833
I just wanna
get out of here.

289
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:45,416
I'm Lotus, a Disciple.
Why are you here?

290
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,208
Well, this crazy girl
was trying to kill me,

291
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:50,833
and then I fell…
into a statue.

292
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:54,000
That was a portal.
It brought you to the Spirit Cave.

293
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:57,166
Now that you're here, you're going
to need to find that Blood Weapon.

294
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:01,416
I found mine.
Resurrection Chains.

295
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,208
Ready to discover yours?

296
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:07,583
Oh, <i>this </i>is the Spirit Cave!

297
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:10,666
So this Blood Weapon--
how will I choose?

298
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,291
You're kidding me.
Your Duke didn't tell you?

299
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:16,875
No, he didn't.

300
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:19,791
You get one chance at this.

301
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:22,666
Don't you know anything
about our ways?

302
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,041
-You have a Spirit Beast?
-Yeah.

303
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:27,541
-The Fruit of Hisya?
-Oh, yeah.

304
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:29,375
Okay. Well, it's a start.

305
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:30,541
Look out!

306
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:37,500
And who the hell are you?

307
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:40,541
The High Lords and the Resurrection Chains
belong to <i>me.</i>

308
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,625
You can't have them.

309
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:47,208
There you are.

310
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:49,583
Stop cowering!
What sort of Disciple are you?

311
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:52,208
I should never have promised Silver
that I'd help you.

312
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:54,375
Wait. Silver asked you
to come find me?

313
00:41:56,833 --> 00:42:00,208
You want me to save
your Disciple? Okay.

314
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,541
Beg for it. On your knees.

315
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:12,333
Now the other one.

316
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:21,208
<i>Silver wanted me to tell you…</i>

317
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:24,875
that your Blood Weapon
is Resurrection Chains.

318
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,000
Impossible.

319
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:57,750
Lotus, wait. I know
she's kind of a pain in the ass,

320
00:42:57,833 --> 00:43:00,125
but shouldn't we
take her with us?

321
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:03,250
-It's not safe here.
-I don't need your pity.

322
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:04,833
I don't pity you.

323
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,083
There's hundreds
of Blood Weapons here.

324
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:10,416
Why can't you just pick another one,
and leave this one for me?

325
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,083
I've got an extra Fruit of Hisya--
I can let you have it.

326
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:17,208
Take it, and find
a different weapon.

327
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:18,833
Okay?

328
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:28,750
Maybe we should find a place
with denser Golden Mist,

329
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:31,291
so you can heal.

330
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:47,375
Don't be shocked.
That's the Blood Gift of Duke Six,

331
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,833
<i>and of his Disciple.</i>

332
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:51,708
Huh? Blood Gift?
Blood Weapon?

333
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:53,791
Ignorant <i>and </i>pathetic.

334
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:56,833
Each Soul Loop consists
of a unique pattern.

335
00:43:56,916 --> 00:44:01,083
It generates an ability for
each Duke and their Disciple.

336
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:03,416
Duke Six, the Eternal Duke,

337
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,958
has the Blood Gift
of regeneration.

338
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:07,833
She is his Disciple,

339
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:10,041
so has also received
that ability.

340
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,916
And what's your gift?
You and your Duke?

341
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,916
My ability is that
I can control Spirit Beasts.

342
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,166
I'm able to hypnotize them,
and on a large scale

343
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,916
So, I…

344
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:31,000
Do we have any of those--
Silver and me?

345
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,791
Like, how come I don't have one yet?

346
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,125
Now we go find the bastard
who took my arm.

347
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:36,833
He's going to pay for this--
I swear that he will.

348
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,416
Hi, and "you're welcome."

349
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,750
I didn't say "thank you."

350
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,000
I never asked for your help.

351
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,333
What's this useless pig doing?!

352
00:46:43,416 --> 00:46:45,750
Easy.

353
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:48,000
Stop being mean.
My friend isn't a pig.

354
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:49,500
A beast is a beast.

355
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,541
There's no point
making friends with it.

356
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:54,083
You'll understand when
you find <i>your </i>Spirit Beast.

357
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:56,625
It's the one being
that's always guaranteed

358
00:46:56,708 --> 00:46:58,250
to risk its life to protect you.

359
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:01,208
Whatever.
I'm royal, unlike you.

360
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:03,083
I just have to say the word

361
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:05,541
and whole armies
would all die for me.

362
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,750
Let alone beasts like this.

363
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:23,208
Why so jumpy?
I'm just testing out my Blood Weapon.

364
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:25,458
Listen.

365
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:27,625
-Let's move on. And keep an eye out.
-Yeah.

366
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:58,208
I hear you're a traitor.

367
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:09,750
Asbel, be careful!

368
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:12,625
Stay away from the fog.

369
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:35,166
-Asbel!
-Asbel!

370
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,958
Be careful!
Keep holding on!

371
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,375
I am holding on!

372
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:57,875
You go ahead! Leave me here!

373
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,041
Wait! No!

374
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:38,166
Help! Help me!

375
00:49:50,708 --> 00:49:52,125
Ice Fang!

376
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,625
Hang in there!

377
00:50:56,416 --> 00:50:57,958
Hold on tight!

378
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:09,333
This is for Ice Fang!

379
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:50,500
The copper ring on the left
is the exit.

380
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:52,916
Let's go.

381
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,833
I want Ice Fang back.

382
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,208
Wait, hold it!

383
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:04,708
Someone switched the door.
The one on the right is the exit.

384
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:08,208
You sure about that?

385
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:11,541
You know the consequence
if we choose the wrong one.

386
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:15,083
Yeah. We choose wrong,
we die.

387
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:17,666
So I'd listen to me
if I were you.

388
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,250
You have to trust me.

389
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:23,625
I know what I'm talking about.

390
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,708
Is that true?

391
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,250
-What are you doing?!
-Let go!

392
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,375
You're obviously terrified.

393
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,583
I guess it <i>was </i>the truth.

394
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:42,458
Of course it was.

395
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:55,458
Hey, what did you do that for?!

396
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:56,625
You killed her!

397
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:57,958
She tried to kill me first!

398
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:01,750
She wasn't actually
gonna do it!

399
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:10,458
Asbel!

400
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:21,833
Fine. Go with her.

401
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:25,041
It's not my fault
if you have a death wish.

402
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:44,916
This place is…

403
00:53:46,666 --> 00:53:49,083
Who's there?!

404
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:53,208
But how are you--

405
00:53:53,291 --> 00:53:55,500
how are you still--

406
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,291
I'm confused.

407
00:54:00,083 --> 00:54:03,083
Come with us…
if you want to live.

408
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:30,208
If it isn't Silver.

409
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:31,625
It's good to see you.

410
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:34,666
You and I have things to…

411
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,125
discuss.

412
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:21,208
Hey. Why'd you turn 'em off?

413
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:22,541
Wasn't me.

414
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:27,833
Kira, stop running around.

415
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:29,958
I'm not, I've been right here
the whole ti--

416
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:31,458
Shh!

417
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:40,833
Uh, seriously?
Then who was it?

418
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:53,791
I've told you all I can.

419
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:59,625
No more time.
Go to the Eternal Island.

420
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:01,625
Find Duke Six.

421
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:04,125
He will tell you…

422
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:09,375
And you are?

423
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:21,833
I am Duke Three. Zillah.

424
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:41,333
Silver!

425
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:56,833
Zillah.

426
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:58,791
How come you're with
these three Disciples?

427
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:01,041
I found them in the Ruins of Utool.

428
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:04,541
They said someone
changed the portals in the Spirit Cave.

429
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:07,083
-To escape.
-That's impossible.

430
01:00:07,166 --> 01:00:08,666
Why do you say that?

431
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,375
Because Zillah
made the portals.

432
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:12,416
No one else
can manipulate them.

433
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:17,208
Silver, did you ask Kira
to tell Asbel

434
01:00:17,291 --> 01:00:18,833
about his Blood Weapon?

435
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:21,500
That it would be…
Resurrection Chains?

436
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:22,708
So what if I did?

437
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:25,916
Well, the problem is…

438
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,250
the three of us
got the same message.

439
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,250
Duke Four, Lady Nox, is the one

440
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:32,208
who passes down messages
about Blood Weapons.

441
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:34,291
That means either Lady Nox

442
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:37,500
received conflicting messages
from the High Lords,

443
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:41,791
or else… she's been lying
to all of us.

444
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:44,166
-But why?
-I have no idea.

445
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,291
But I might know
how to find her.

446
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:48,958
She, with Duke Two, is hunting
the supposed traitor, Wind Walker.

447
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:52,208
I have information that he's headed
to the Eternal Island

448
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:53,875
to find Duke Six, Hillure.

449
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:55,458
But why should the High Lords

450
01:00:55,541 --> 01:00:57,166
think that you and your Duke
have betrayed them?

451
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:59,708
That doesn't sound
like Wind Walker.

452
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:05,625
Hillure has been missing for years.

453
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:07,458
Why would he resurface now?

454
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:09,166
We need to find out.

455
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:32,750
I don't really understand
what's going on.

456
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:35,666
However, I'm going with them.

457
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:38,500
So, are you sure
you don't wanna follow along?

458
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:40,083
My Duke is Hillure.

459
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:43,375
Finding him is…
an obligation.

460
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:46,041
So I'm not following you,
you puppy.

461
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,583
You can follow <i>me.</i>

462
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:58,166
Step this way.

463
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:08,750
Whoa. It'd be great if I could
make my own portals.

464
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:10,541
Go wherever I want--
so cool!

465
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:12,083
Keep dreaming.

466
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:13,833
It's Zillah's unique Blood Gift.

467
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:18,958
Making portals is his gift?
And that's it?

468
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:22,208
His Blood Gift
is far more powerful.

469
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:24,708
He controls time and space.

470
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:26,458
Oh, that's impressive!

471
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:29,500
I forgot to ask Silver
what our gift was going to be.

472
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:21,041
You use this monster
to welcome an ally?

473
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:28,083
An ally? Do you like
my dear savage, Neon?

474
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:30,500
He's the perfect weapon
for killing monsters,

475
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:33,250
especially those with Spirit Power.

476
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:35,041
But why are you
attacking me?

477
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:36,916
As if you need to ask.

478
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:39,333
But it makes no sense at all.

479
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:41,375
Sweet Aeron, I see
right through you.

480
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:45,333
I know your Blood Gift
is yours, and yours alone;

481
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:47,791
distinct from Dark,
your Duke, and my lover.

482
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:51,333
You have what is known
as Passive Evolution.

483
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:53,791
When you defeat an enemy,
you acquire their power,

484
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:55,416
absorbing their Blood Gift.

485
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,291
<i>We arrived here on a mission--</i>
<i>to hunt a Spirit Beast.</i>

486
01:03:58,375 --> 01:04:01,083
<i>Ah, yes. The Spirit Beast.</i>

487
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:04,083
<i>You went to that town</i>
<i>searching for more power--</i>

488
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:05,833
<i>the power of Ice Fang.</i>

489
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:07,791
<i>But you failed, didn't you?</i>

490
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:10,916
<i>Dark believes</i>
<i>you are loyal to him.</i>

491
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,458
But your ambition
surpasses your loyalty.

492
01:04:14,541 --> 01:04:18,291
<i>Indeed, your ambition has surpassed</i>
<i>the capacity of your mortal body</i>

493
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:20,916
<i>to hold all of your stolen power.</i>

494
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,333
<i>And therein lies your problem.</i>

495
01:04:23,416 --> 01:04:27,500
<i>But you believe the solution is here</i>
<i>on Eternal Island, with Hillure.</i>

496
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:30,666
Once you have obtained
his Blood Gift,

497
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:33,166
his power of
extreme regeneration,

498
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,666
then you will be able
to endure any attack,

499
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:39,583
making you the most powerful
monster in the territory.

500
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:41,541
Am I right?

501
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:43,708
Or am I right?

502
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,041
But which Duke
are you planning to replace?

503
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:50,541
I am the only Duchess in Ashland,

504
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:54,083
and not even you
can change that fact.

505
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:03,958
Well, well.

506
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:06,166
Look at that.

507
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:12,041
No wonder you're still alive.

508
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:14,625
My little pet seems
to have a thing for you.

509
01:05:14,708 --> 01:05:17,625
Now, isn't that sweet?

510
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:19,041
You can stop this now.

511
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:21,958
Did you forget why we're here?

512
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:27,875
This is no time
for sideshow grievances.

513
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:32,791
We are here
to stop a traitor…

514
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:34,333
Wind Walker.

515
01:06:04,416 --> 01:06:07,000
I sense my brother is here.

516
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:10,208
I must go to him.

517
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:16,250
-I'll come too.
-Silver.

518
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,250
Dark's also here.

519
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:21,208
Do you want to be seen
helping a traitor?

520
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:23,500
-That's not--
-If you stand with Duke Five,

521
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:26,375
you will also be betraying
the High Lords.

522
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:28,791
You will become
an enemy to Ashland.

523
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:32,458
Instead, we need to fight Lady Nox,
Dark, and Aeron.

524
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:34,583
Heed my words.

525
01:06:34,666 --> 01:06:38,708
The Blood Gifts
of Wind Walker and Lotus

526
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:42,208
will be used by them
to hypnotize all Spirit Beasts in the sea.

527
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:46,041
But if it goes wrong,
those beasts will destroy Ryen City.

528
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:48,708
Choose carefully, Silver.

529
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:52,416
Do you want to be
responsible for that?

530
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:56,125
Brother.

531
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:59,833
Are you all right?

532
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:03,083
I'm okay. Don't worry.

533
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:08,541
-Is Silver here?
-Yes, with his Disciple, Asbel.

534
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:11,333
Plus Princess Kira,
Hillure's Disciple.

535
01:07:11,416 --> 01:07:14,416
And Duke Zillah,
who brought us here through a portal.

536
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,083
Zillah's here with you?

537
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:18,833
Hmm. What's wrong?

538
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:21,250
I'm not sure.

539
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:24,000
But whatever's going on,
there's not much we can do about it

540
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:26,166
now that the path
has been set.

541
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,000
All the Dukes of Ashland,

542
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:30,666
apart from Duke One,
have gathered here.

543
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:33,625
There's no way
that's a coincidence.

544
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:38,458
The Spirit Power
on this island is overwhelming.

545
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,916
It's like looking into
the eye of a storm.

546
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,791
But I can't feel
where that storm comes from.

547
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:50,416
Where does it originate?

548
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:55,125
The center of all this power--

549
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:59,791
we find that, and that's how
we'll find Hillure.

550
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:04,083
We already have.
We're standing on Hillure.

551
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:07,958
This whole island is his body.

552
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:49,583
<i>Seventeen years ago…</i>

553
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:53,291
Hillure was ordered
to merge his body with this island.

554
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:56,208
And by doing so,
created a prison.

555
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:58,833
What evil
does this island hold?

556
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:02,291
And why sacrifice a Duke
to imprison hi--

557
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:03,875
Brother!

558
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:07,625
I'm okay.
Just stay focused.

559
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,333
Stay here.
And don't move.

560
01:12:22,416 --> 01:12:24,875
Silver. Is this your weapon?

561
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:27,083
-It's one of them, yes.
-Say what?

562
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:29,791
Infinite Weapons.
That's our gift.

563
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:32,291
Huh? Silver!

564
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:36,958
What is all this
white stuff, anyway?

565
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:39,458
It's one of the most
famous shields in Ashland.

566
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:41,625
The Hem of the Goddess.

567
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:44,750
It shields any attack from Spirit Beasts
<i>and </i>Spirit Power.

568
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:47,041
However, I thought
it belonged to Lady Nox.

569
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:48,708
Amazing.

570
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:51,250
So, we're safe in here.

571
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:52,875
Don't be such an idiot.

572
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:55,083
Never underestimate
Duke Five.

573
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:56,625
Look at them now.

574
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:01,583
How many Spirit Beasts
do you think are under the sea?

575
01:13:01,666 --> 01:13:03,375
I'll protect you!

576
01:13:03,458 --> 01:13:05,291
I'll be fine. You just
protect yourself.

577
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:11,833
All right, then.

578
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:14,041
So, Silver was able to steal

579
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:16,625
the broken shards
of my Blood Weapon.

580
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:18,750
But those children won't last.

581
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:21,125
Not for a minute.

582
01:13:21,208 --> 01:13:24,833
Not if they're relying
on that pitiful excuse for a shield.

583
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:27,666
I will show them
the real Hem of the Goddess.

584
01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:26,375
-Go out, and you'll die!
-Silver's in danger!

585
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:28,208
If a Duke can't deal with this,

586
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:30,500
what on earth makes you think
you can do it?

587
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:33,166
Maybe I won't make it,
but I gotta try and save him!

588
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:35,083
Asbel! You idiot!

589
01:17:39,458 --> 01:17:40,958
Watch out!

590
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:47,208
-Go back.
-I'm here for you.

591
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:51,708
You told me Duke and Disciple
always fight together.

592
01:18:22,458 --> 01:18:24,250
Brother.

593
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:26,750
I don't know
if I can do this anymore.

594
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:31,208
Hypnotizing this many
Spirit Beasts is draining me.

595
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:33,250
If we lose control,
you have to…

596
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,958
I can deal with them.

597
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:37,041
You go find Hillure.

598
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:41,250
They split up.
How interesting.

599
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:57,958
Hillure? Duke Six?

600
01:20:58,041 --> 01:20:59,708
Can you hear me?

601
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:02,541
Is that you up there?

602
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:07,833
Yes. It is I.

603
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:12,000
Why have you brought
all these monsters to my island?

604
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:14,500
We had no choice,
my brother and I.

605
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:17,291
Those beasts
had to be hypnotized.

606
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:20,916
We never intended to--

607
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,750
I am not talking about
the Spirit Beasts!

608
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:27,750
I mean the monsters
who are fighting your brother.

609
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:31,375
Including the one
that followed you.

610
01:21:32,916 --> 01:21:38,000
I can slow her down,
but I cannot stop her.

611
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:40,833
She will find her way here soon.

612
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,875
Hillure.

613
01:21:56,958 --> 01:22:00,208
It seems I may have
underestimated you.

614
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:32,166
However, you have also
underestimated me.

615
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:52,000
Tell me, Hillure, does that hurt?

616
01:23:13,166 --> 01:23:14,958
Think carefully, Wind Walker.

617
01:23:15,041 --> 01:23:17,083
If you lose control of these beasts,

618
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:20,541
the people of Ryen will suffer.

619
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:23,041
Is that really
the outcome you seek?

620
01:23:25,708 --> 01:23:28,166
Why have you turned
against us like this?

621
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:31,125
Zillah, I can't
explain it now.

622
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:34,875
I am as true a son of Ashland
as I have ever been.

623
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:36,708
But if I die here today,

624
01:23:36,791 --> 01:23:39,041
do what you can to contain
the Spirit Beasts.

625
01:23:39,125 --> 01:23:40,541
I'm begging you.

626
01:23:40,625 --> 01:23:43,125
Ryen shouldn't suffer.

627
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:04,416
Come on, let's go!

628
01:24:08,166 --> 01:24:09,166
Come on, hurry it up!

629
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:11,000
Come on! Go, go, go!

630
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:12,375
Keep moving!

631
01:24:12,458 --> 01:24:14,083
Come on!

632
01:24:33,541 --> 01:24:36,041
Aim…

633
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:38,208
Fire!

634
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:00,291
Fire!

635
01:27:00,375 --> 01:27:01,958
Fire!

636
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:37,333
Silver, decide where you stand.

637
01:28:39,416 --> 01:28:41,833
What's happening?

638
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,750
Quick, Dark.
We have to kill Lotus. Now.

639
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:53,458
Hillure sacrificed himself to give her
the power of regeneration.

640
01:29:53,541 --> 01:29:56,125
That makes her Duke Six.

641
01:29:56,208 --> 01:29:58,250
We're running out of time.

642
01:29:58,333 --> 01:30:01,250
She now shares the original Soul Loop
with Duke Five.

643
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:03,708
If she combines that
with Hillure's power,

644
01:30:03,791 --> 01:30:05,291
she can surpass anyone.

645
01:30:05,375 --> 01:30:06,958
Once her new Soul Loop completes

646
01:30:07,041 --> 01:30:10,291
there's no way any of us
will be able to stop her.

647
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,000
Dark. Zillah. Silver.

648
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:47,708
Neon. Aeron.

649
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:49,333
On behalf of the High Lords,

650
01:30:49,416 --> 01:30:52,083
I command you to get out there
and kill Lotus!

651
01:30:52,166 --> 01:30:54,666
We cannot let the traitor escape!

652
01:31:29,333 --> 01:31:31,000
Brother!

653
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:38,875
Don't kill him.

654
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:41,375
<i>Don't! That's his plan!</i>

655
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:44,041
She'll get his power!

656
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:45,708
No, don't!

657
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:19,458
Look what you've done.

658
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:21,791
You killed him, you idiot.

659
01:33:21,875 --> 01:33:23,333
His power has passed to her.

660
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:26,125
She is now Duke Five <i>and Six--</i>

661
01:33:26,208 --> 01:33:28,625
the first double-Duke in history.

662
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:43,500
You killed my brother.

663
01:33:43,583 --> 01:33:46,416
Each one of you
is to blame for this!

664
01:33:48,291 --> 01:33:51,166
But I'll have my vengeance.

665
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:54,416
My brother may be dead,
but he will not die alone.

666
01:33:56,250 --> 01:34:00,333
Trust me,
you will accompany him!

667
01:34:00,416 --> 01:34:04,250
I'll make damn sure
his death wasn't in vain.

668
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:35,458
We still have a chance.

669
01:34:35,541 --> 01:34:38,208
The two Soul Loops haven't fused.
They're in conflict.

670
01:34:38,291 --> 01:34:39,791
It's our only chance to kill her.

671
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:42,250
Let's go. <i>Now!</i>

672
01:35:51,791 --> 01:35:53,333
They all left.

673
01:35:53,416 --> 01:35:55,583
What about you?
Will you leave, too?

674
01:35:59,708 --> 01:36:01,375
I don't know.

675
01:36:01,458 --> 01:36:03,625
But you should go home.

676
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:07,875
You parents are waiting
for you to marry.

677
01:36:07,958 --> 01:36:11,625
What parents?
My mother died when I was born.

678
01:36:11,708 --> 01:36:16,500
And my father,
I'd never seen him before today.

679
01:36:16,583 --> 01:36:19,375
-And now he's gone, too.
-Why is that?

680
01:36:19,458 --> 01:36:21,958
Duke Six. Hillure.

681
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:24,166
He was my father.

682
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:27,291
My mother was his Disciple.

683
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:30,166
She made the ultimate sacrifice.

684
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:32,041
When she was pregnant with me,

685
01:36:32,125 --> 01:36:35,833
I stole her Soul Loop
from within the womb.

686
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:38,750
But without her,
my Soul Loop was incomplete

687
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:41,333
and always will be.

688
01:36:41,416 --> 01:36:44,916
Sometimes I feel like
a lonely, deserted freak.

689
01:36:47,333 --> 01:36:50,041
The truth is,
you're really not alone.

690
01:36:50,125 --> 01:36:52,625
If you're a freak,
then so am I.

691
01:36:52,708 --> 01:36:56,541
When I was younger,
the other kids would laugh at me.

692
01:36:56,625 --> 01:36:59,500
I was always bullied.

693
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:02,000
Then one day I met Silver,

694
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:04,666
and my life was changed.

695
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:06,375
It was a dream.

696
01:37:06,458 --> 01:37:08,375
A wonderful dream.

697
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:11,375
An impossible dream.

698
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:13,916
But the craziest thing about it--

699
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,500
Now he's gone. Like it was
just a dream after all.

700
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:22,708
They say a Duke and his Disciple
are like family,

701
01:37:22,791 --> 01:37:25,833
like lovers, but my Duke,
my own father,

702
01:37:25,916 --> 01:37:28,416
chose to pass on his Soul Loop
to a stranger instead of me.

703
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,416
Your Duke abandoned you.

704
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:35,625
And so it seems
it was all a lie.

705
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:45,916
Hey. Come on, cheer up.

706
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,500
Life was hard.

707
01:37:48,583 --> 01:37:50,583
I was on my own,

708
01:37:50,666 --> 01:37:52,375
except for my parents,

709
01:37:52,458 --> 01:37:54,250
until Silver came along.

710
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:56,958
And how he's here.

711
01:37:57,041 --> 01:38:00,125
He is my family now.

712
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:03,250
He won't abandon me.
I trust him.

713
01:38:08,375 --> 01:38:13,250
I'm going back to Glanort.
I'll wait for him there.

714
01:38:13,333 --> 01:38:16,208
And he'll come back to me.

715
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:18,541
I know he'll come back.

716
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:22,375
I'll come with you.

717
01:38:41,375 --> 01:38:44,208
I've chosen to help you,
but I need to know.

718
01:38:44,291 --> 01:38:47,166
What was Hillure guarding?

719
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:51,500
<i>To answer that, we must</i>
<i>go back to the beginning.</i>

720
01:38:51,583 --> 01:38:55,333
<i>Wind Walker and I were deep</i>
<i>in the Abyss Corridor.</i>

721
01:38:55,416 --> 01:39:00,083
<i>We were practicing our gift--</i>
<i>hypnotizing Spirit Beasts.</i>

722
01:39:00,166 --> 01:39:02,791
<i>Suddenly, he appeared.</i>

723
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:08,125
Stay back! It's dangerous!

724
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:09,208
You'll--

725
01:39:41,208 --> 01:39:43,625
<i>I thought I was helping</i>
<i>by warning him,</i>

726
01:39:43,708 --> 01:39:46,791
<i>but you might as well tell the sun</i>
<i>that the day is long.</i>

727
01:39:46,875 --> 01:39:49,375
<i>He told us his story--</i>
<i>we had to help him.</i>

728
01:39:49,458 --> 01:39:51,583
<i>So then, they hunted us.</i>

729
01:40:01,833 --> 01:40:03,958
Who exactly are you?
Be smart, kid.

730
01:40:04,041 --> 01:40:06,666
I'll… show you.

731
01:40:36,333 --> 01:40:39,458
So you're saying
this boy prevented you

732
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:41,625
from killing Wind Walker?

733
01:40:41,708 --> 01:40:46,250
Prevented me?
It was generous of him not to kill me.

734
01:40:46,333 --> 01:40:49,833
If you could see no other reflection
in the mirror,

735
01:40:49,916 --> 01:40:53,041
surely you should have realized
that the boy's Spirit Power

736
01:40:53,125 --> 01:40:55,000
<i>was greater than your own.</i>

737
01:40:55,083 --> 01:40:57,375
<i>The Wraith Mirror</i>
<i>showed me nothing.</i>

738
01:40:57,458 --> 01:40:59,541
It reflects
two types of people.

739
01:40:59,625 --> 01:41:03,458
As you know,
those who don't have powers.

740
01:41:03,541 --> 01:41:07,333
And the others
who the mirror reflects

741
01:41:07,416 --> 01:41:09,791
are those
who are stronger than me.

742
01:41:09,875 --> 01:41:13,375
And the only one
who is stronger than me

743
01:41:13,458 --> 01:41:15,125
is Gilgamesh.

744
01:41:15,208 --> 01:41:18,333
You should have
realized sooner.

745
01:41:18,416 --> 01:41:21,708
<i>Have you ever noticed that</i>
<i>in the High Lords' temples</i>

746
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:26,125
<i>only the side rooms are used</i>
<i>to enter their chambers?</i>

747
01:41:28,125 --> 01:41:31,375
<i>The door to the middle room</i>
<i>is always closed.</i>

748
01:41:31,458 --> 01:41:33,791
<i>Why do you think that is?</i>

749
01:41:33,875 --> 01:41:37,041
Now, I could be wrong
about this,

750
01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:39,791
but I think the boy you met
in the Abyss Corridor

751
01:41:39,875 --> 01:41:43,916
is actually the High Lord
who escaped from that little room.

752
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:49,041
But the High Lords
won't leave their crystal rooms.

753
01:41:49,125 --> 01:41:54,750
It's not "won't"--
the truth is, they <i>can't </i>leave.

754
01:41:54,833 --> 01:41:58,166
The High Lords
are powerful beings,

755
01:41:58,250 --> 01:42:01,458
come to us from another world.

756
01:42:03,416 --> 01:42:06,083
They're confined
to their quarters.

757
01:42:06,166 --> 01:42:10,583
We treat them as if they're gods,
but they're far from that.

758
01:42:12,958 --> 01:42:16,583
<i>-They're prisoners.</i>
<i>-What do you mean?</i>

759
01:42:16,666 --> 01:42:20,333
That young boy?
A renegade High Lord

760
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,416
took over his body as his own,

761
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:24,500
used it as a vessel to escape.

762
01:42:24,583 --> 01:42:26,958
But there was a problem.

763
01:42:27,041 --> 01:42:29,666
The young boy's body was still mortal.

764
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:31,541
There was no way
it could bear the weight

765
01:42:31,625 --> 01:42:33,625
of a High Lord's soul for long.

766
01:42:33,708 --> 01:42:36,916
Otherwise, every single
High Lord would escape.

767
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,708
They would leave their crystal prisons
for eternity,

768
01:42:39,791 --> 01:42:42,000
go out and wreak havoc.

769
01:42:42,083 --> 01:42:46,250
The High Lords gave orders
to hunt down my brother and I.

770
01:42:46,333 --> 01:42:48,500
Sounds all too familiar,
doesn't it?

771
01:42:48,583 --> 01:42:50,208
<i>What happened four years ago was</i>

772
01:42:50,291 --> 01:42:53,000
a catastrophe.

773
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:55,416
The farmer, Duke One,

774
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,375
Gilgamesh,

775
01:42:57,458 --> 01:42:59,333
and his Disciple

776
01:42:59,416 --> 01:43:01,708
were branded as traitors.

777
01:43:01,791 --> 01:43:04,000
And for that,
we were given the task

778
01:43:04,083 --> 01:43:06,375
of hunting them both down.

779
01:43:06,458 --> 01:43:08,541
<i>So we did just that.</i>

780
01:43:08,625 --> 01:43:10,333
Gilgamesh--

781
01:43:10,416 --> 01:43:12,708
it wasn't him who betrayed us.

782
01:43:12,791 --> 01:43:15,083
He happened to know our secrets--

783
01:43:15,166 --> 01:43:19,541
yes, all of our secrets.

784
01:43:19,625 --> 01:43:23,708
He knew the reason
why we're all here.

785
01:43:23,791 --> 01:43:26,041
He knew our purpose.

786
01:43:26,125 --> 01:43:28,833
But he was too powerful for us.

787
01:43:28,916 --> 01:43:31,291
We were not able to destroy him.

788
01:43:31,375 --> 01:43:35,500
We could only trap him in a cage.

789
01:43:35,583 --> 01:43:38,250
So you want us
to rescue Gilgamesh.

790
01:43:38,333 --> 01:43:41,708
No. You don't understand.

791
01:43:41,791 --> 01:43:44,333
Our hands were
stained with blood,

792
01:43:44,416 --> 01:43:46,000
stained with sin,

793
01:43:46,083 --> 01:43:49,500
so we were exiled
and imprisoned here.

794
01:43:49,583 --> 01:43:53,666
But there are cracks in the prison.

795
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:56,125
And the day is fast approaching

796
01:43:56,208 --> 01:44:00,375
when the rest of my kin
will begin to escape.

797
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:03,125
And when that does happen,

798
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:05,625
this world will become
another hell.

799
01:44:05,708 --> 01:44:10,083
And only Gilgamesh
can save us all.

800
01:44:12,125 --> 01:44:14,416
How do you know these secrets?

801
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:18,250
Not just me.
And therein lies the danger.

802
01:44:18,333 --> 01:44:22,833
You see, a secret is like
a flame in the darkness

803
01:44:22,916 --> 01:44:24,708
with no kindling.

804
01:44:24,791 --> 01:44:27,958
It cannot grow into a fire.

805
01:44:28,041 --> 01:44:30,458
But even the smallest
spark of light…

806
01:44:32,916 --> 01:44:36,375
…is enough
to attract predators.

807
01:44:37,875 --> 01:44:40,500
I fear no one.
Where is Gilgamesh?

808
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:50,291
The jail used
to imprison Gilgamesh…

809
01:44:50,375 --> 01:44:53,208
was inside Hillure.

810
01:44:57,166 --> 01:44:59,416
<i>Gilgamesh discovered</i>
<i>that the High Lords</i>

811
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:03,500
<i>are more demons than gods--</i>
<i>as did I.</i>

812
01:45:03,583 --> 01:45:07,041
<i>But these demons are the ones</i>
<i>who give us our power.</i>

813
01:45:07,125 --> 01:45:11,750
<i>Unlike that fool Gilgamesh,</i>
<i>I refuse to bite the hand that feeds us.</i>

814
01:45:11,833 --> 01:45:16,458
<i>Because of his strength, the High Lords</i>
<i>had to find somewhere to jail him</i>

815
01:45:16,541 --> 01:45:19,541
<i>from which is was impossible</i>
<i>to escape.</i>

816
01:45:19,625 --> 01:45:22,291
<i>Hillure's blood gift</i>
<i>of eternal regeneration</i>

817
01:45:22,375 --> 01:45:24,041
<i>let him merge with the island</i>

818
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:27,666
<i>and kept Gilgamesh's</i>
<i>imprisonment eternal.</i>

819
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:31,083
<i>So Hillure sacrificed himself,</i>

820
01:45:31,166 --> 01:45:35,125
and then made Lotus
the new immortal Duke.

821
01:45:35,208 --> 01:45:38,750
Because he wanted
to release Gilgamesh?

822
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:41,000
Possibly.

823
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:46,166
Or maybe,

824
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:48,291
<i>just maybe,</i>

825
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:51,875
<i>he was tired of eternity,</i>

826
01:45:51,958 --> 01:45:55,083
<i>living in a state of limbo.</i>

827
01:45:57,375 --> 01:46:01,333
<i>No one wants to be</i>
<i>half-dead forever.</i>

828
01:46:22,791 --> 01:46:25,500
So much secrecy.

829
01:46:25,583 --> 01:46:28,791
I wonder how many lies
are in this kingdom?

830
01:46:28,875 --> 01:46:31,625
More than you
can ever imagine.

831
01:46:32,916 --> 01:46:35,166
I will tell you more,

832
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:38,583
however, first you must promise me

833
01:46:38,666 --> 01:46:41,875
that you will stand by my side.

834
01:46:45,041 --> 01:46:47,333
And what side is that?

835
01:46:49,458 --> 01:46:52,666
The side that will survive…

836
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:54,166
of course.

837
01:47:04,375 --> 01:47:06,875
I wanted to be a Duke so badly,

838
01:47:06,958 --> 01:47:10,083
to always remain loyal
to the High Lords.

839
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,875
I wanted to guard Ashland
with my life.

840
01:47:14,958 --> 01:47:18,458
But it turns out the Dukes
are just ignorant pawns.

841
01:47:18,541 --> 01:47:21,333
doing whatever
the High Lords want.

842
01:47:23,958 --> 01:47:27,125
And at the end of the day,
we're disposable.

843
01:47:27,208 --> 01:47:30,666
We're practically Spirit Beasts
residing in human form.

844
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:33,041
No more and no less.

845
01:47:33,125 --> 01:47:35,666
I've had to learn
to accept that.

846
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:38,958
It's not easy.

847
01:47:39,041 --> 01:47:41,458
Long ago, the world was filled

848
01:47:41,541 --> 01:47:43,583
with a great number of Dukes--

849
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:45,750
<i>new Dukes were born,</i>

850
01:47:45,833 --> 01:47:48,083
<i>old Dukes died.</i>

851
01:47:48,166 --> 01:47:51,333
<i>The fortunes of noble families</i>
<i>rose and fell accordingly.</i>

852
01:47:51,416 --> 01:47:55,000
<i>Eventually, legends</i>
<i>were turned into relics.</i>

853
01:47:55,083 --> 01:47:58,416
<i>Their secrets were shrouded</i>
<i>in darkness.</i>

854
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:03,041
<i>Since the dawn of time,</i>
<i>people have killed</i>

855
01:48:03,125 --> 01:48:05,541
<i>in pursuit of glory…</i>

856
01:48:05,625 --> 01:48:07,250
<i>wealth…</i>

857
01:48:07,333 --> 01:48:10,166
<i>power… and justice.</i>

858
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:12,708
<i>Yet they all end up in the same place:</i>

859
01:48:12,791 --> 01:48:14,958
<i>destruction.</i>

860
01:48:15,041 --> 01:48:18,083
<i>They wanted to hoard</i>
<i>their Spirit Power</i>

861
01:48:18,166 --> 01:48:22,375
<i>and allow their descendants</i>
<i>to worship them as legends.</i>

862
01:48:22,458 --> 01:48:26,666
<i>Instead, they became cold skeletons,</i>

863
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:29,458
<i>their emotions withering away</i>

864
01:48:29,541 --> 01:48:31,750
<i>until they perished.</i>

865
01:48:33,458 --> 01:48:35,541
<i>Nothing was left inside them</i>

866
01:48:35,625 --> 01:48:39,083
<i>but an insatiable desire</i>
<i>for even more Spirit Power--</i>

867
01:48:39,166 --> 01:48:43,750
<i>a dark, soulless ambition</i>
<i>that fills this world with bleakness.</i>

868
01:48:49,666 --> 01:48:52,583
So, then, are you going
to help me practice?

869
01:49:05,375 --> 01:49:07,291
<i>When I found out</i>

870
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:09,916
about all this, it was a burden.

871
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,583
It was hard to cope.

872
01:49:12,666 --> 01:49:14,583
Not now.

873
01:49:14,666 --> 01:49:17,791
Now there's only one thing
left for me to feel.

874
01:49:17,875 --> 01:49:20,000
-Sorrow?
-Anger.

875
01:49:20,083 --> 01:49:21,958
Now tell me…

876
01:49:27,458 --> 01:49:31,000
Ever since the catastrophe
first happened four years ago,

877
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:33,875
you've kept a low profile.

878
01:49:33,958 --> 01:49:36,875
You've maintained
a dignified silence,

879
01:49:36,958 --> 01:49:40,333
you've kept away from the fight
for power and control.

880
01:49:40,416 --> 01:49:43,500
What I wouldn't give
to see Gilgamesh.

881
01:49:47,208 --> 01:49:50,375
I was his Disciple then.

882
01:49:50,458 --> 01:49:55,375
And so… my heart
still remains with him.

883
01:49:55,458 --> 01:49:59,041
What about Asbel?

884
01:50:35,083 --> 01:50:38,333
Asbel, don't worry.

885
01:50:38,416 --> 01:50:41,375
I'll return… eventually.

886
01:51:28,958 --> 01:51:30,750
<i>To save Gilgamesh,</i>

887
01:51:30,833 --> 01:51:33,125
<i>we must overcome many hurdles.</i>

888
01:51:33,208 --> 01:51:34,833
<i>We will become enemies</i>
<i>of all the Dukes</i>

889
01:51:34,916 --> 01:51:36,750
<i>and of their Disciples.</i>

890
01:51:36,833 --> 01:51:38,958
<i>Danger lies ahead.</i>

891
01:51:39,041 --> 01:51:41,125
<i>But there is hope in the darkness--</i>

892
01:51:41,208 --> 01:51:45,000
<i>a pinprick, yet bright enough to follow,</i>
<i>and believe in.</i>

893
01:51:45,083 --> 01:51:48,291
<i>Gilgamesh,</i>
<i>I will see you again.</i>

894
01:51:48,375 --> 01:51:51,125
<i>Your prison</i>
<i>is no longer eternal.</i>

895
01:51:51,208 --> 01:51:54,375
<i>You will awaken,</i>
<i>and you will save us.</i>
