Can you make your brother
some breakfast, please?

48
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,493
- He ate.
- When?

49
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:17,662
Before you were awake.

50
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:22,101
You have a class?

51
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:23,903
One early.

52
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,872
You were supposed to be
with Mia.

53
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:29,008
I'll be here. She'll be here.
We'll be here.

54
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,979
- I can handle it.
- Kai! Come on.

55
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,087
<i>I have to go
to the market.</i>

56
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:42,922
Didn't you order
some stuff online?

57
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:45,291
I tried. It's on backorder.

58
00:02:45,523 --> 00:02:48,493
I have to get Kai a new pen
and... and toilet tissue.

59
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:52,497
I don't have many needs,
but I do have my dignity.

60
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:55,034
Come on, Mom.

61
00:02:55,935 --> 00:02:57,236
All right.

62
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:15,888
- Good morning.
- <i>Good morning, Greg.</i>

63
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:17,957
Hey, Mia.

64
00:03:22,228 --> 00:03:23,329

<i>are turning to violence again

68
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,819
Shit.

69
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:52,825
<i>As you can see
unfolding before our eyes,</i>

70
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:55,560
<i>this unrest is continuing
late into the night</i>

71
00:03:55,728 --> 00:03:57,495
<i>as many local shop owners</i>

72
00:03:57,595 --> 00:03:59,531
<i>have abandoned
their storefronts.</i>

73
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:02,600
<i>If you haven't seen,
any real attempt to safely...</i>

74
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:10,743
<i>You know, we've seen</i>

75
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,211
<i>this path of destruction</i>

76
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:14,646
<i>sweeping in from the northeast
corner of the state</i>

77
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:16,949
<i>as early as last Wednesday,</i>

78
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,552
<i>and it's only picking up
momentum as it heads south.</i>

79
00:04:20,652 --> 00:04:22,922
<i>And as you can see right here...</i>

80
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,957
- I... I need to...
- Excuse me.

81
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,961
I really need to.
Please hurry.

82
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,131
Can I help you?

83
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,233
Yeah, I thought
it opened at 8:00.

84
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,936
- The pharmacist never showed.
- I'm a doctor.

85
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:39,537
Can I just, you know, go back
there and get what I need?

86
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:40,940
He's the only one with the key.

87
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,309
- Hmm.
- We're about to close up in a few minutes.

88
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,778
- Closing?
- Haven't you seen the news?

89
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:48,114
No. I...

90
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,283
<i>This unrest is
continuing late into the night</i>

91
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,085
- <i>as many local shop owners...</i>
- Oh.

92
00:04:54,186 --> 00:04:55,254
One minute.

93
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,590
Are you okay?

94
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:00,658
Everything's gone.

95
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:04,830
I... I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

96
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,799
You're about ready?

97
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,868
About.

98
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:13,538
Uh. Come. Come with me.

99
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:16,308
Take this. And this.

100
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,010
That's good. No.

101
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,079
And these.
That's really all you need.

102
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:24,050
- Any nausea?
- It's random.

103
00:05:24,549 --> 00:05:26,919
Yeah. Can come back sometimes.

104
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,394
Take this.

105
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:39,732
Slice it up, put a little
honey and lemon, hot water.

106
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:41,200
I'm Helen.

107
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:42,802
Amber.

108
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,005
I don't think I've seen
you around here before.

109
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:49,341
Oh, my family just moved out
here a few months ago.

110
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:51,676
Well, you picked
a heck of a time.

111
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:53,779
Yeah.

112
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,682
<i>Uh. You know,
this is a panic driven drop.</i>

113
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,252
<i>Much like the Great Depression,
this is not a monetary...</i>

114
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:04,123
Looks like that's
your college tuition.

115
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:10,695
Okay, my girl. All right.
Are you interrupting me, huh?

116
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:13,432
Oh, what's going on?

117
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,902
You okay?

118
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:20,372
Hey, sweetie.

119
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:21,673
<i>You have to come get us, Dad.</i>

120
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:23,608
- <i>They're ending classes early.</i>
- Why? What's going on?

121
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,277
<i>Something's going on
in the city.</i>

122
00:06:25,411 --> 00:06:27,012
- <i>Everybody's leaving.</i>
- Why?

123
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:29,647
<i>It's bad. Everything they said
on the news,</i>

124
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:30,883
<i>they think it's happening.</i>

125
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,953
Oh, okay, uh...

126
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,388
Shit.

127
00:06:36,755 --> 00:06:38,491
All right, let me, um,
call your mom.

128
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:44,864
You see this?
It's picked over.

129
00:06:44,964 --> 00:06:47,366
Nothing left.

130
00:06:48,968 --> 00:06:50,668
I'm sorry,
but we're about to close up.

131
00:06:52,138 --> 00:06:53,973
<i>Hey,
your mom's not answering.</i>

132
00:06:54,672 --> 00:06:56,375
I'm with the baby. Where's Kai?

133
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:57,977
<i>He's with me. He's fine.</i>

134
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,278
Sit tight.

135
00:06:59,445 --> 00:07:00,712
I'm an OB, by the way.

136
00:07:00,846 --> 00:07:03,082
Uh. You know the farmhouse
on Shingle Mill Road?

137
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:04,716
Oh, I think we're neighbors.

138
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:06,352
You know where to find me.

139
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,388
If you need me.

140
00:07:27,473 --> 00:07:28,706
Where's Greg?

141
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:32,344
- Famous last words.
- All right. Seriously?

142
00:07:32,645 --> 00:07:33,846
Not time for jokes.

143
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:36,015
I'm just standing out here
in the fucking wilderness.

144
00:07:36,215 --> 00:07:37,750
We didn't move
to the middle of nowhere

145
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,151
so I could wonder where he is.

146
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:41,554
Don't be mad at me.
I'm on your side.

147
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:42,687
I mean, I love Greg too,

148
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:46,025
but standing out here
with your scary-ass chickens.

149
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:51,297
- Did you call him?
- I called you. Several times. Yeah, me.

150
00:07:51,664 --> 00:07:52,932
Swipe. Me, me.

151
00:07:53,032 --> 00:07:54,200
Okay, great.
That's what I'm saying.

152
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,402
You're always the worst
with your fucking phone.

153
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,772
I'll take the bag.

154
00:08:03,142 --> 00:08:04,743
Nephew!

155
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:07,346
Oh, Kai.

156
00:08:07,712 --> 00:08:09,548
You outta school? Huh? Hmm?

157
00:08:09,682 --> 00:08:11,283
What's that mean, chicken time?

158
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,120
Where were you?

159
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:18,090
What?

160
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,233
Wow, the air is thick
around here, huh?

161
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,003
I'm saying
it's worth looking at.

162
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,838
And they have a class.

163
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:35,774
<i>Excuse me, Jake.
I am sorry to interrupt.</i>

164
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:37,409
<i>We do have breaking news.</i>

165
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:39,445
Hey, Merrick-Stern
just went down.

166
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:41,313
Guessing that's bad, huh?

167
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,249
They're one of the biggest
brokers on Wall Street.

168
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:47,086
- It's worse than bad.
- If you got money.

169
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,854
Hey, you're not on Wall Street.

170
00:08:49,188 --> 00:08:50,956
<i>Just unbelievable.
Unbelievable.</i>

171
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:53,559
<i>I... I've just
never seen a collapse this bad.</i>

172
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:56,195
<i>2008 was nothing
compared to this.</i>

173
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:57,796
<i>Oh, Stan,
take a look at these...</i>

174
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:03,135
Is he okay?

175
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:04,903
Bird got out.

176
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,540
What is it? Huh?

177
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:09,975
What's wrong?

178
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:12,711
What's...

179
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:16,415
Fuck!

180
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,019
- Greg.
- The fence is electric.

181
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:21,954
- Since when?
- Now, see, that's some bullshit.

182
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:25,257
All right, come on. I want you to move away.

183
00:09:25,324 --> 00:09:26,025
I'll get him.

184
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,093
All right, everybody
stay away from the fence.

185
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:29,528
You need to go talk to them.

186
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,163
Them who?

187
00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:33,632
Uh, the assholes
who hotwired your fence.

188
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:34,734
You don't know who lives there?

189
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:37,069
The seller said they were quiet.
They never met him before.

190
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:39,138
Yeah, they're obviously
fucking crazy.

191
00:09:40,072 --> 00:09:42,374
Don't worry, he'll be back.
He'll fly back in.

192
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:43,909
Look at me.

193
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:46,345
Sweetie, you'll see.
He'll be back.

194
00:09:46,945 --> 00:09:48,180
All right, come on.

195
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:50,215
He'll be back. Come on.

196
00:09:57,823 --> 00:09:59,925
- What you see coming in?
- Nothing strange.

197
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,960
I spent half the trip
trying to stay out of the way

198
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:03,696
of people who were driving
like maniacs.

199
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:06,165
And the other half of the trip
wondering why these fools

200
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,567
acting like it's their first
time ever hearing bad news.

201
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:10,069
I'm scared.

202
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:12,271
How are we gonna get
what we need?

203
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:13,405
Babe.

204
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,341
People overreact.

205
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:17,376
They did the same thing
when COVID hit.

206
00:10:17,543 --> 00:10:18,812
I got a text, what, 20 times

207
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:20,780
that the president
was gonna declare martial law

208
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:22,214
and the country was gonna go
into lockdown.

209
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:23,716
And the country
went into lockdown.

210
00:10:23,783 --> 00:10:25,551
The country went to "Stay home."

211
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:27,920
Well, since we all gonna
be stuck at home,

212
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,689
maybe you can get our neighbor
to cut off his fence.

213
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,625
You ain't got but one
neighbor for ten or 15 miles.

214
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:35,127
You might want to know
who they are.

215
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,796
Huh. Well, who's your neighbor?

216
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,197
Oh,
there's a lot of people

217
00:10:38,297 --> 00:10:40,599
live next door to me, Mr. Shade.
I thought we were friends.

218
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:41,700
Hmm.

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,436
Look, I will drive up the road
to see if I can find

220
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,739
the entrance to the property.

221
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,406
Entrance? How big is the place?

222
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:48,374
I don't know.

223
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:50,943
Dry your hands before
you get electrocuted again.

224
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:53,747
Ah, yeah.

225
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:55,849
Oh, shall we, me <i>chérie?</i>

226
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:56,982
I'm nursing.

227
00:10:57,082 --> 00:10:58,550
And you're pumping.
Get over yourself.

228
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:00,319
One glass won't hurt.

229
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:11,029
Oh,
talking about a curfew.

230
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:21,340
Mom, can I watch TV
in your room?

231
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:23,242
Stay off my bed.

232
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,844
I don't want to be on your bed.

233
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,346
Just thinking about
what goes on there. Ugh.

234
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:28,380
Nothing goes on there.

235
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:30,916
Which is why you want me
to stay off of it.

236
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,452
Nothing goes on there?

237
00:11:34,888 --> 00:11:36,823
- Is that your business?
- It's not my business.

238
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,957
I don't want it to be.

239
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:43,429
Who else am I supposed
to talk to?

240
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,131
Think it rhymes with therapist.

241
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:49,535
He's the one who should...

242
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:51,103
Oh, God, see.

243
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,173
You got your man back.
That's the win.

244
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,909
Plus you got your baby.

245
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:57,811
I thought I was done.

246
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,014
The minute you stop trying is
when you actually get pregnant.

247
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:05,317
- Karma.
- Hmm. Sex.

248
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,486
I wish.

249
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:10,422
He doesn't want it?

250
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:17,229
- He tries.
- Oh. He's here, Helen.

251
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,699
It was an affair,
not the Titanic.

252
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,635
If you want your man,
you better act like it.

253
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,970
Why is it on me?

254
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:27,673
You want to be happy,
so get happy.

255
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,041
You want to trade?

256
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:31,510
I want the man I married.
I want my husband.

257
00:12:31,577 --> 00:12:34,213
No, you want a time machine.

258
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:36,315
You set these impossible
expectations

259
00:12:36,415 --> 00:12:38,984
that no one can keep,
including yourself.

260
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:41,286
When it comes time for you
to do one little thing...

261
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,022
- It's not little.
- Well, then I'm happy for you.

262
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,494
'Cause size matters.
You better use it or lose it.

263
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:53,332
- I hate you.
- You love me.

264
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:55,400
You just don't know
how to show it.

265
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:57,904
Did you talk to him?

266
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:02,608
All I saw was a rundown stable
and an old trailer.

267
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,845
- There's nobody there.
- They just issued a curfew.

268
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:07,646
Yeah, I should probably go.

269
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:09,047
No, stay.

270
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:13,085
- I mean, you've been drinking.
- I've been sipping and it's fine.

271
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:14,586
It's only 30 minutes away.

272
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,355
I'll be at my house

273
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:17,957
before you guys
turn off all these lights.

274
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:19,224
Okay, you want me
to take you home?

275
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:20,292
I'll bring your car
in the morning.

276
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,261
No. Nothing exciting
happens on my street

277
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:25,732
except finding a place to park.
And besides, I have a life.

278
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:27,666
Call me tomorrow.

279
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:30,669
Okay. Bye!

280
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:44,043
<i>...secretary is saying</i>

281
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:46,645
<i>with the market's recent
collapse, that we can expect...</i>

282
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:47,747
You see him?

283
00:14:48,113 --> 00:14:49,281
Ah, he's gone.

284
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:51,650
I can't imagine he's
gonna last very long out there.

285
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:54,053
Maybe. Maybe not.

286
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:56,154
I mean, if you think about it,
it's weird

287
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:58,825
how long a bird survives
inside of a coop.

288
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:00,392
Is that what
you're gonna tell Kai?

289
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:02,394
His bird is better off
without him?

290
00:15:02,594 --> 00:15:04,731
I don't know
who that guy thinks he is.

291
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:08,901
All the schools are shut down.

292
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:10,937
There's a bunch of armored cars
in the city.

293
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:12,671
I need you to check on Brooke.

294
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:15,607
I called, I text.
She hasn't answered me.

295
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:18,143
It's getting bad out there.

296
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:20,379
I don't think I should
leave you guys alone.

297
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:23,315
We'll be fine.

298
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,717
<i>...unemployment
as high as it is.</i>

299
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:28,087
<i>Uh. William Calverts here
with a little update.</i>

300
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:29,321
<i>To your point, you know,</i>

301
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:31,390
<i>who are they gonna pay
these loans back to?</i>

302
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:35,327
<i>It would take a major disruption</i>

303
00:15:35,427 --> 00:15:37,130
<i>to prompt a suspension
of civil liberties.</i>

304
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,497
<i>General Brennan,</i>

305
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:40,532

311
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:53,445

I'm out here on the streets.</i>

312

<i>I am trying to get
to some shelter here.</i>

313
00:15:57,349 --> 00:15:59,217
<i>Uh, there are shots
being fired...</i>

314
00:15:59,284 --> 00:16:00,585
Hey!

315
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:02,454
<i>I don't, I don't know
where they're coming from.</i>

316
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:12,497
<i>Greg?</i>

317
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:14,433
Brooke.

318
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:18,037
Thank God. We've been calling
you all morning. Come on.

319
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:20,472
They're sending in
the National Guard.

320
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:21,774
<i>Okay, I'm coming.</i>

321
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:29,548
Kai. We're not going
to school today. Come on.

322
00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:37,656
Oh, my God.

323
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:39,725
You okay? Okay, stay right here.

324
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,861
I'm gonna go get Mom,
all right? Mom.

325
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:44,964
Mom. Kai got stung by a bee.

326
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:48,500
Have you seen his pen?

327
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:51,470
- No.
- Go look in your father's office.

328
00:16:56,843 --> 00:16:57,777
Hey.

329
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:00,612
- <i>Kai got stung by a bee. We need a pen.</i>
- Get out of the way!

330
00:17:00,612 --> 00:17:01,948
I thought you got one.

331
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:03,648
Just tell Brooke to bring hers.

332
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:04,884
All right.

333
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:09,654
Hey. Kai got stung by a bee.
Do you have a pen?

334
00:17:09,721 --> 00:17:12,058
Yeah, I think so. Uh,
just let me go back upstairs.

335
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:15,260
Can you look in my car
for my phone? I can't find it.

336
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,462
Mom. I found it.

337
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,002
Hey, here. Here.

338
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:24,503
- Did you find my phone?
- No.

339
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,371
- Fuck.
- Look, we got to go.

340
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:28,340
Give me a second.
I need my phone.

341
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,509
Brooke, we got to go!

342
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:38,283
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

343
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:40,186
Just let me look one more time.

344
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:41,821
Come on, Brooke.

345
00:17:44,257 --> 00:17:45,858
Geez.

346
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:47,860
What are these guys doing?

347
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:52,664
Are they jacking cars?

348
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:56,701
- Come on. Look for a ride.
- Here we go.

349
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:00,773
No. No. No, no. Shit.

350
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:03,642
Shit!

351
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:05,011
Brooke!

352
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:06,879
- No, leave me alone.
- Come on, open it!

353
00:18:06,946 --> 00:18:08,014
Hey!

354
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:13,351
Brooke!

355
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:52,591
Where's Brooke?

356
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:09,108
I got you.

357
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:29,095
Greg. You haven't
answered my question.

358
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:31,864
How could you just leave?

359
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:34,834
Babe, I tried.

360
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,671
Yeah, that's what you do.

361
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,774
Helen.

362
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:45,745
- Listen, I...
- When are you gonna do more than fucking try, Greg?

363
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:48,948
You always try.

364
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:50,950
The man had a gun.

365
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:55,453
- So?
- So, you want me dead? I got... I got kids.

366
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,621
I got you!

367
00:19:57,223 --> 00:19:59,491
Oh. So now
you're worried about me?

368
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:02,194
- Oh. Don't even...
- Don't what?

369
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:07,733
Don't cry? Don't hurt?

370
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:09,802
Don't scream?

371
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:13,372
What do you not want me to do

372
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,975
so you can fucking feel good
for yourself?

373
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,711
- There ain't nothing...
- Just tell me. Tell me what it is. I'll do it.

374
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:23,115
There's nothing... There was
nothing else for me to do.

375
00:20:23,382 --> 00:20:25,785
I know.

376
00:20:28,254 --> 00:20:29,487
You tried.

377
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:46,772
<i>...in an
attempt to quell the violence,</i>

378
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:48,908
<i>they have set up checkpoints,
and at this point,</i>

379
00:20:48,975 --> 00:20:50,843
<i>no one is being allowed
in or out of the city</i>

380
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:54,146
<i>after another night of violence
has left at least 60...</i>

381
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:09,527
Can I help you?

382
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,231
You Helen?

383
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:14,734
Yes.

384
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:16,902
Ma'am, could you come with me,
please?

385
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,471
And who are you?

386
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:22,008
Amber sent me.
She met you at the store.

387
00:21:22,308 --> 00:21:23,508
Is she okay?

388
00:21:24,777 --> 00:21:26,644
I just need you to come
if you can.

389
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:29,647
- Let me grab my bag.
- Wait, come where?

390
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:31,283
I'm sorry, sir. Just her.

391
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:33,119
No, she's not going anywhere.

392
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:37,990
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

393
00:21:38,523 --> 00:21:39,691
Be right back.

394
00:22:09,321 --> 00:22:10,555
Wait.

395
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,959
Put these on.

396
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:16,729
No.

397
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:17,963
- I have to.
- Uh-uh.

398
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:19,799
I'm not letting my wife
walk off blindfolded

399
00:22:19,932 --> 00:22:23,202
- with some white boy.
- Greg. That's not necessary.

400
00:22:25,404 --> 00:22:26,839
Look, man, we can leave.

401
00:22:36,515 --> 00:22:38,084
Well, this way.

402
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,731
To your right.

403
00:23:45,818 --> 00:23:47,253
Told you to blindfold them.

404
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:48,720
They wouldn't put 'em on.

405
00:23:49,188 --> 00:23:51,290
I didn't ask for you.

406
00:23:52,858 --> 00:23:54,093
Matty, take her in.

407
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,361
Yes, sir.

408
00:23:58,864 --> 00:24:01,033
Hey. Have a seat.

409
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:14,346
Okay.

410
00:24:15,614 --> 00:24:18,050
Do you have any cramps or
contractions with the bleeding?

411
00:24:18,217 --> 00:24:19,151
No.

412
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,289
Matty! Come here.

413
00:24:37,803 --> 00:24:41,207
- There it is. That's the heartbeat.
- Oh.

414
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,475
Very good.

415
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:46,345
How about that? All right.

416
00:24:46,512 --> 00:24:48,147
I'm going to have to
examine you.

417
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:56,055
All right.

418
00:25:02,761 --> 00:25:04,029
How old are you?

419
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:17,376
All right.

420
00:25:20,846 --> 00:25:22,648
- What is it?
- Well,

421
00:25:22,748 --> 00:25:24,750
it looks like
a subchorionic hematoma.

422
00:25:25,017 --> 00:25:26,685
And she's gonna need
attention for it

423
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:28,153
if it gets worse.

424
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:29,088
What do you mean worse?

425
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:31,156
Well, it might be a sign
of placental abruption.

426
00:25:31,257 --> 00:25:32,157
Might.

427
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:33,859
Might not.

428
00:25:34,093 --> 00:25:35,894
Well, is that how you want
to handle this?

429
00:25:38,097 --> 00:25:39,965
Next time, you come alone.

430
00:25:40,065 --> 00:25:41,400
That's not your decision.

431
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:44,303
She can either come alone
or leave alone.

432
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:47,806
Okay? Your choice.

433
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:50,976
My son got a shock
when he touched the fence

434
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:52,511
up against our property.

435
00:25:52,778 --> 00:25:53,912
Fence is there for a reason.

436
00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:55,114
Maybe you should put a sign up.

437
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:57,216
Maybe you should keep
an eye on your boy.

438
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:02,187
- Matty, take 'em home.
- Yes, sir.

439
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,312
The kitchen
looks pretty stocked.

440
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:02,147
Just grab all the food.

441
00:27:02,448 --> 00:27:04,216
Find anything else of value.

442
00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:07,453
All right, man.

443
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,830
Go get the baby. Yeah.

444
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,364
Okay. Come on.

445
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:25,204
Take this one.

446
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,211
Yo, I found two more.

447
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:37,916
Right here.

448
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:43,655
That's it.

449
00:27:57,236 --> 00:27:58,437
Grab 'em both.

450
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:05,144
All right, I got one.

451
00:28:14,953 --> 00:28:17,857
Shit. Upstairs. Go.
I don't know.

452
00:28:28,634 --> 00:28:30,202
Come on.
Go, go, go, go, go.

453
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:31,503
Go, go.

454
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,971
The kids are in the car.

455
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:23,756
Helen...

456
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:25,959
what are we doing?

457
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:29,328
We have no food.
They took everything.

458
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,130
We have to go.

459
00:29:51,183 --> 00:29:52,451
You have to leave.

460
00:29:52,952 --> 00:29:54,019
We need your help.

461
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:55,721
<i>Can't help you.</i>

462
00:29:56,488 --> 00:29:58,858
- Can't or you won't?
- <i>You're trespassing.</i>

463
00:29:59,224 --> 00:30:00,827
Somebody broke into our house.

464
00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:02,628
<i>And how do I know
you're not bringing them</i>

465
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:05,464
- <i>to break into mine?</i>
- We would never do that.

466
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:07,165
<i>How do I know that?</i>

467
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:09,969
You help us, we can help you.

468
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:11,470
<i>I don't need you.</i>

469
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,272
What about Amber?

470
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:16,508
You give a damn about that baby,
she's gonna need somebody.

471
00:30:16,776 --> 00:30:19,077
So if you're saying you'll
take your chances, then...

472
00:30:19,746 --> 00:30:21,146
we'll take ours.

473
00:30:24,918 --> 00:30:26,418
- Let's go.
- <i>Matty.</i>

474
00:30:26,753 --> 00:30:28,120
I'm here.

475
00:30:28,654 --> 00:30:29,621
<i>How many are they?</i>

476
00:30:30,188 --> 00:30:32,792
The two you saw,
plus three younger.

477
00:30:33,492 --> 00:30:34,459
One's a baby.

478
00:30:36,763 --> 00:30:38,297
<i>Put the car in the stable.</i>

479
00:30:39,565 --> 00:30:40,499
All right.

480
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:30,382
Thank you.

481
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:32,417
How old are you?

482
00:31:34,252 --> 00:31:37,389
- His name is Kai. He is about...
- He can speak for himself.

483
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:39,826
He doesn't talk.

484
00:31:41,226 --> 00:31:42,361
But you do.

485
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:45,497
Zoe. Mind your manners.

486
00:31:51,336 --> 00:31:52,805
Can she use your bathroom?

487
00:31:53,806 --> 00:31:54,807
Matty.

488
00:31:58,143 --> 00:31:59,311
Follow me.

489
00:32:01,246 --> 00:32:05,350
Sub chorionic hematoma?

490
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:10,222
"These blood clots
are rarely problematic."

491
00:32:10,757 --> 00:32:13,725
"They usually result
in a onetime bleed

492
00:32:14,192 --> 00:32:15,862
once the clot has passed."

493
00:32:19,065 --> 00:32:20,298
The bleeding stopped.

494
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,937
- You think I'm stupid?
- I don't.

495
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:26,873
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

496
00:32:27,205 --> 00:32:30,442
- You lied to me.
- I was being cautious.

497
00:32:30,743 --> 00:32:33,980
The only reason you're here
is because she wants you.

498
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:36,281
You lie to me again,

499
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:39,217
we got nothing else
to talk about.

500
00:32:42,121 --> 00:32:43,388
Let's go get your stuff.

501
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:47,927
Go.

502
00:32:48,795 --> 00:32:50,529
- I'll check on Zoe.
- Mm-hmm.

503
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:54,633
Okay.

504
00:32:55,935 --> 00:32:56,869
Protect your mom.

505
00:33:10,315 --> 00:33:12,718
- Did you change your pad?
- Yeah.

506
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,821
Where'd you put it?

507
00:33:15,088 --> 00:33:17,222
- In the trash can. Why?
- Okay, good.

508
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,791
No, never mind.

509
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:22,694
- Go check your brother.
- Okay.

510
00:33:24,496 --> 00:33:26,933
She has to stay on bed
rest. She's still bleeding.

511
00:33:27,033 --> 00:33:28,400
Is the baby in trouble?

512
00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:29,501
Could be.

513
00:33:29,736 --> 00:33:31,536
Something is aggravating
her condition.

514
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:34,639
- What has she been doing?
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

515
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:36,976
Besides living in a bunker.

516
00:33:38,243 --> 00:33:39,846
Let her stay, Winter.

517
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:41,346
Please? Just...

518
00:33:41,513 --> 00:33:43,281
Okay, just... just
give me a second.

519
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:44,784
All right, hon?

520
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:47,619
With third trimester bleeding,

521
00:33:47,854 --> 00:33:50,056
the chances of her having
a complicated delivery

522
00:33:50,156 --> 00:33:51,690
are significantly higher.

523
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:56,963
You know, we could be dealing
with placenta previa,

524
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,998
placental abruption,
incompetent cervix.

525
00:33:59,065 --> 00:34:01,734
There's really no way to know,
given the lack of prenatal care.

526
00:34:01,801 --> 00:34:03,568
I've been taking care
of this family for years.

527
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:06,538
Yeah, well, this baby is coming.
She going to need help.

528
00:34:07,106 --> 00:34:08,540
You're going to need help.

529
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:11,811
I'm not gonna need help
from all of you.

530
00:34:12,377 --> 00:34:14,046
But you can't get it without us.

531
00:34:14,646 --> 00:34:17,016
I don't think you know
what's been going on out there.

532
00:34:18,617 --> 00:34:19,919
Why do you think I'm in here?

533
00:34:27,459 --> 00:34:30,196
The girl and my boy
will have the sofa bed

534
00:34:30,295 --> 00:34:31,496
in the living room.

535
00:34:31,964 --> 00:34:32,799
You all are here.

536
00:34:33,032 --> 00:34:35,835
Uh-uh. My daughter's
not sharing a bed with your son.

537
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:37,203
It's okay.

538
00:34:37,435 --> 00:34:38,738
I can sleep on the floor.

539
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:41,107
- No, it's okay.
- It's fine.

540
00:34:41,406 --> 00:34:43,408
Lights shut off at 9:00,
come back on at 6:00.

541
00:34:43,508 --> 00:34:45,778
- And the hatch stays locked.
- Why?

542
00:34:45,945 --> 00:34:47,345
'Cause that's what we do.

543
00:34:58,257 --> 00:35:00,659
So, how come I never
seen you around before?

544
00:35:02,261 --> 00:35:03,528
Like at school and stuff?

545
00:35:05,064 --> 00:35:06,799
Uh, the school system is, um...

546
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:10,368
Uh, my dad doesn't
believe in it.

547
00:35:11,037 --> 00:35:12,337
So, you're homeschooled?

548
00:35:12,437 --> 00:35:14,941
I guess
you could call it that.

549
00:35:34,227 --> 00:35:35,493
What's wrong with your brother?

550
00:35:37,629 --> 00:35:38,396
Nothing.

551
00:35:38,898 --> 00:35:41,100
I mean,
he's actually really smart.

552
00:35:42,134 --> 00:35:43,401
He's adopted.

553
00:35:45,204 --> 00:35:47,139
- For real?
- Yeah.

554
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,841
We got him
when he was about five.

555
00:35:49,374 --> 00:35:51,610
We know his birth mother died
when he was a baby,

556
00:35:51,676 --> 00:35:54,146
but... other than that,

557
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:56,048
we don't know
what trauma he suffered.

558
00:35:56,381 --> 00:35:58,650
I mean, my mom got him tested
for everything.

559
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:00,719
He just doesn't talk.

560
00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:03,521
They said it's like
a coping mechanism.

561
00:36:04,357 --> 00:36:06,092
Yeah, well,
not having a mom sucks.

562
00:36:07,425 --> 00:36:08,526
Where's your mom?

563
00:36:09,195 --> 00:36:12,131
She's, uh... she got into
a lot of bad stuff, that's all.

564
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,134
Like what?

565
00:36:15,368 --> 00:36:17,303
Oh,
just about everything.

566
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,437
Drugs, alcohol, you name it.

567
00:36:20,538 --> 00:36:22,540
But she got into it
'cause of this guy.

568
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:24,944
My dad...

569
00:36:25,878 --> 00:36:29,414
he didn't know about it,
but when he found out...

570
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:32,584
...it was too late.

571
00:36:33,418 --> 00:36:34,552
Where is she?

572
00:36:35,888 --> 00:36:36,789
She OD'd.

573
00:36:38,456 --> 00:36:41,493
- I'm sorry.
- It's not a big deal.

574
00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:47,934
Are we safe here?

575
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:55,074
Yeah.
Get some sleep.

576
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:57,709
- Okay.
- Yeah.

577
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:20,866
Hey, hey.

578
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:23,235
What do you think you're doing?

579
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:25,905
Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

580
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:27,340
Put that down, boy!

581
00:37:27,505 --> 00:37:29,275
God!

582
00:37:29,408 --> 00:37:30,542
Hey, man, what's going on?

583
00:37:30,642 --> 00:37:32,378
These cans were stored
by expiration date!

584
00:37:32,477 --> 00:37:33,879
Now everything's out of order!

585
00:37:33,946 --> 00:37:36,015
Hey, you don't have
to yell at him.

586
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:43,756
Jesus.

587
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:46,425
You have everything.

588
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:47,893
There's enough in here for mine.

589
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:52,465
You all being here one month
uses up six months of supplies!

590
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,933
You don't know that.

591
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:55,868
You can't just take from us.

592
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:58,636
Everybody's got to bring
something to the table!

593
00:37:58,738 --> 00:38:00,072
All right, do me a favor, okay?

594
00:38:00,272 --> 00:38:02,341
When you talk about me,
talk to me.

595
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,965
Dear Lord,
please bless this food

596
00:38:26,065 --> 00:38:27,532
we are about to receive.

597
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:29,402
Watch over Amber

598
00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:33,973
as she prepares to bring
a precious life into this world.

599
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:36,208
Pray for my guests.

600
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:38,610
Bless their Kai...

601
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:43,816
so that he may be
one day healed and...

602
00:38:44,649 --> 00:38:45,985
and speak your good word.

603
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:48,921
In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.

604
00:38:49,388 --> 00:38:50,489
- Amen.
- Amen.

605
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:52,224
- Amen.
- Amen.

606
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,168
Why didn't you say "Amen"?

607
00:39:04,669 --> 00:39:09,041
That's kind of a... personal
question, don't you think?

608
00:39:10,109 --> 00:39:12,577
I like to know what kind of
man's sitting at my table.

609
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:18,050
Amen to that.

610
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,988
There's nothing wrong with Kai.

611
00:39:25,057 --> 00:39:26,025
What's that?

612
00:39:26,724 --> 00:39:29,095
You said bless Kai
so he can speak.

613
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:32,398
- He can speak. He just doesn't.
- Zoe.

614
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,999
I'm just saying
what you told me to say

615
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:36,902
when people treat Kai like
he's different. He's not.

616
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:39,371
He's fine.

617
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,808
Amen to that.

618
00:39:46,045 --> 00:39:47,012
Hmm.

619
00:39:49,614 --> 00:39:52,017
We spoke to Kai
about touching your things.

620
00:39:53,953 --> 00:39:55,254
And that won't happen again.

621
00:39:58,524 --> 00:39:59,724
Appreciate that.

622
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,106
You, uh...
you want to pour.

623
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:20,279
You got to let it sit.
Wipe it off.

624
00:40:22,314 --> 00:40:24,183
And drop 'em in.

625
00:40:26,252 --> 00:40:27,386
Think you can handle that?

626
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:30,688
Pour, let it sit,
wipe it off and drop it in?

627
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,992
- I think so.
- Yeah, okay.

628
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:44,236
And pour.

629
00:40:45,804 --> 00:40:47,672
You got to let it sit
for a second.

630
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:49,341
Wipe it off.

631
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,648
There you go.

632
00:40:56,048 --> 00:40:57,950
Okay. You keep doing this.

633
00:41:22,707 --> 00:41:24,009
That's fine.

634
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:28,981
Man should know how to shoot.

635
00:41:29,315 --> 00:41:32,284
Uh, mm-mm. "A rifle these hands
will never fire."

636
00:41:33,018 --> 00:41:34,587
"History will look upon the Act

637
00:41:34,753 --> 00:41:37,323
depriving a whole nation
of arms as the blackest."

638
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:41,427
Ah. You know your Gandhi.

639
00:41:43,395 --> 00:41:48,901
That quote is out of context.
He wasn't arguing for more guns.

640
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:52,071
He was arguing for the repeal
of the Arms Act of 1878.

641
00:41:52,404 --> 00:41:54,340
Well, it would've been
a more convincing argument

642
00:41:54,406 --> 00:41:55,441
if he had a gun.

643
00:41:59,612 --> 00:42:00,913
Where'd you study?

644
00:42:02,014 --> 00:42:05,551
Library mostly.
Iraq, Afghanistan.

645
00:42:07,553 --> 00:42:08,454
Hmm.

646
00:42:09,822 --> 00:42:14,660
W.E.B. Du Bois believed that
without a proper education,

647
00:42:15,194 --> 00:42:17,429
anything that the Black man
was working to get

648
00:42:17,796 --> 00:42:19,198
could be taken away from him.

649
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:21,667
Booker T. Washington
believed a man

650
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:24,236
should not use
an education to avoid labor.

651
00:42:25,304 --> 00:42:26,839
He was Black, too, right?

652
00:42:28,707 --> 00:42:29,842
Yes, he was.

653
00:42:30,776 --> 00:42:32,746
Well, I believe it's best
to have an education

654
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:34,046
than to need one.

655
00:42:35,914 --> 00:42:38,951
How do you expect
to protect your family?

656
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,354
There are other ways.

657
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:45,824
Not here.

658
00:42:47,626 --> 00:42:48,927
Go ahead.

659
00:43:03,976 --> 00:43:06,912
I guess,
I guess you were right.

660
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:11,016
You just got...
Yeah, you got to cock it.

661
00:43:25,064 --> 00:43:28,000
Oh, my gosh, he ordered
the same thing every time.

662
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,536
It was eggs over hard
with extra bacon.

663
00:43:30,602 --> 00:43:32,838
And mind you, this is at
three o'clock in the morning.

664
00:43:32,971 --> 00:43:34,573
He never said
more than two words to me,

665
00:43:34,673 --> 00:43:36,041
until one night,
I left my lights on

666
00:43:36,141 --> 00:43:38,110
and he jumpstarted my car.

667
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:41,280
Next time he came in,
I offered to comp his meal,

668
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,615
but no, no, no,
he wanted the bill.

669
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:45,884
When I came
back to his empty table,

670
00:43:45,984 --> 00:43:48,921
I thought, "He must've left me
his number."

671
00:43:49,823 --> 00:43:51,457
But you know what he wrote
on the receipt?

672
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:54,626
"You left your
lights on again."

673
00:43:54,761 --> 00:43:57,229
I know.

674
00:43:57,563 --> 00:43:58,330
What's that fabric?

675
00:43:58,497 --> 00:44:01,133
Oh, that's...
Winter got that overseas.

676
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,302
He calls it a, um...

677
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:05,471
a du... something.

678
00:44:05,537 --> 00:44:06,472
- Dupatta.
- Dupatta.

679
00:44:06,572 --> 00:44:09,108
- That's right.
- Yes, dupatta. You're right.

680
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:11,410
Excellent.

681
00:44:11,477 --> 00:44:13,545
Whoo. It's beautiful.

682
00:44:14,748 --> 00:44:16,215
- It's nice.
- Mm.

683
00:44:16,816 --> 00:44:18,150
You don't like it?

684
00:44:18,717 --> 00:44:20,452
He thinks I don't know,
but he...

685
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:23,455
It was for his wife.

686
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:26,725
Then he gave it to me and it
still had the card inside,

687
00:44:26,793 --> 00:44:29,094
so I just didn't feel right
wearing it.

688
00:44:30,696 --> 00:44:31,964
Looks really pretty on you.

689
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:58,390
Get up!

690
00:44:59,057 --> 00:45:02,094
Get up! Matty, we got a breach!

691
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:18,912
- What's all this?
- What's going on?

692
00:45:19,044 --> 00:45:21,413
Sons of bitches
rammed the gate.

693
00:45:21,547 --> 00:45:23,215
- How many?
- Four.

694
00:45:23,817 --> 00:45:24,918
Here, take it.

695
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:26,685
Wait, you're taking your son
out there?

696
00:45:26,786 --> 00:45:28,855
Uh-uh. I'm taking you.
Go get dressed.

697
00:45:28,987 --> 00:45:30,956
- Dad, no.
- Amber.

698
00:45:31,056 --> 00:45:33,659
Baby. Bed rest, baby.
Get in bed.

699
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,027
What do they want?

700
00:45:36,328 --> 00:45:37,996
Not what they're about to get.

701
00:45:56,348 --> 00:45:58,450
Don't shoot unless
you have a shot.

702
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,653
- But if you have a shot, take it.
- Look, I didn't come here for all this.

703
00:46:01,788 --> 00:46:03,055
This is not a negotiation.

704
00:46:03,455 --> 00:46:05,090
You're either an asset
or liability,

705
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:06,425
and I don't have time
to guess.

706
00:46:06,692 --> 00:46:08,026
I'm not a liability.

707
00:46:08,928 --> 00:46:11,330
- Over there.
- This way.

708
00:46:11,831 --> 00:46:13,131
Stay down.

709
00:46:18,771 --> 00:46:20,239
Damn!

710
00:46:26,144 --> 00:46:27,679
Stay.

711
00:46:29,214 --> 00:46:30,616
You take the shot, you move.

712
00:46:30,716 --> 00:46:32,752
You don't want to be
where the shot came from.

713
00:46:33,151 --> 00:46:34,620
Stay low. Be quiet.

714
00:46:41,326 --> 00:46:42,327
Helen.

715
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:45,564
Oh.

716
00:46:46,498 --> 00:46:49,334
Okay. All right, Amber.
You're okay.

717
00:46:49,434 --> 00:46:51,403
Let's get you back on the bed.

718
00:47:08,353 --> 00:47:09,087
Fuck.

719
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:13,793
Put your feet close
to the bottom as you can.

720
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:27,006
Matthew!

721
00:47:27,105 --> 00:47:28,875
Put that down.

722
00:47:29,042 --> 00:47:30,409
Go get me some towels.

723
00:47:48,061 --> 00:47:50,395
This baby wants
to come out, all right?

724
00:48:03,776 --> 00:48:04,911
Come on!

725
00:48:11,017 --> 00:48:12,517
Okay.

726
00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:13,886
Push!

727
00:49:15,614 --> 00:49:16,682
Thanks.

728
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,795
Everything okay?

729
00:49:49,816 --> 00:49:50,750
Greg?

730
00:49:57,957 --> 00:49:58,958
Greg.

731
00:50:58,751 --> 00:50:59,852
Um...

732
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:55,640
Greg, come on!
Get a move on!

733
00:52:32,144 --> 00:52:33,112
The shoes.

734
00:53:37,276 --> 00:53:40,046
So, I'm screaming and crying

735
00:53:40,346 --> 00:53:44,383
and yelling, and Kai is sitting
there with me, holding my hand.

736
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:46,218
He's really, he's such
a sweet boy.

737
00:53:46,352 --> 00:53:48,754
He is.
You did a great job.

738
00:53:49,155 --> 00:53:50,189
Now, listen.

739
00:53:51,456 --> 00:53:52,624
I want to call him Daniel.

740
00:53:55,328 --> 00:53:56,262
That's a good name.

741
00:53:56,628 --> 00:53:59,265
- It is.
- Virtue. Integrity.

742
00:53:59,631 --> 00:54:02,234
- A man of God.
- Hmm.

743
00:54:03,436 --> 00:54:05,871
- Here's to blessings.
- Mm.

744
00:54:08,174 --> 00:54:09,075
Amen.

745
00:54:11,844 --> 00:54:12,878
Amen.

746
00:54:38,536 --> 00:54:40,039
I can't. I'm still nursing.

747
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,975
Ah. Yeah.

748
00:54:48,881 --> 00:54:49,882
What's wrong?

749
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:56,621
- Greg told me he killed a man.
- He did what needed to be done.

750
00:55:00,658 --> 00:55:01,861
Needed?

751
00:55:06,564 --> 00:55:09,835
The first time you take a life,
it haunts you.

752
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:15,640
Second time, it thrills you,
you know?

753
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:19,211
Eventually, it just numbs you.

754
00:55:23,416 --> 00:55:24,649
Maybe it's like
delivering babies.

755
00:55:24,784 --> 00:55:26,185
You do it enough, it gets old.

756
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:29,554
Bringing life into the world...

757
00:55:31,257 --> 00:55:32,724
that never gets old.

758
00:55:35,828 --> 00:55:37,595
I delivered a baby once.

759
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:42,134
Afghanistan.
We're in this canyon

760
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,838
taking fire from a bunch
of 12-year-olds. Right?

761
00:55:46,772 --> 00:55:50,309
And I see this little
mud brick house, okay?

762
00:55:50,543 --> 00:55:52,745
So, I shimmy over to it,
you know, take cover.

763
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:56,648
And inside there's this girl,
scared to death,

764
00:55:56,749 --> 00:55:58,583
with a baby's head
halfway out of her.

765
00:56:00,886 --> 00:56:04,256
So, I go over to her.

766
00:56:04,757 --> 00:56:07,860
And she's pushing,
and out pops this baby,

767
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:11,797
a little boy,
right into my hands.

768
00:56:12,597 --> 00:56:16,836
And I knew right then
that I needed to get home.

769
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:18,871
But you come back,
it's like...

770
00:56:19,671 --> 00:56:24,743
It's like I was frozen in time
but my life kept moving.

771
00:56:28,013 --> 00:56:30,549
And I found out my wife slept
with somebody, you know.

772
00:56:30,783 --> 00:56:33,185
- She left you?
- I left her.

773
00:56:36,055 --> 00:56:38,257
But, you know, this guy,
he was no good for her.

774
00:56:38,357 --> 00:56:39,825
I knew that, but I wasn't there.

775
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:45,630
And she had...
she had this laugh.

776
00:56:45,998 --> 00:56:49,101
Had pretty red hair.
Auburn, she liked to call it.

777
00:56:50,702 --> 00:56:52,004
I loved her.

778
00:56:54,173 --> 00:56:55,207
I really did.

779
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,849
I'm sorry.

780
00:57:15,127 --> 00:57:17,997
Your husband...
he's got a spirit in him.

781
00:57:18,197 --> 00:57:19,965
It's only so long
before it comes out again,

782
00:57:20,032 --> 00:57:21,867
and when it does,
I don't want it coming at me.

783
00:57:21,967 --> 00:57:23,302
That's not gonna end well.

784
00:57:29,275 --> 00:57:31,143
I think you and your family
need to figure out

785
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:32,478
what you're gonna do.

786
00:57:33,212 --> 00:57:36,081
- Winter...
- I'll give you a week.

787
00:57:50,129 --> 00:57:51,430
- When?
- A week.

788
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:57,503
To stay, we have
to prove our value.

789
00:57:57,603 --> 00:57:59,305
What, killing a man
is not enough?

790
00:57:59,438 --> 00:58:01,307
You did what needed to be done.

791
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,675
When did he tell you that?

792
00:58:02,875 --> 00:58:04,610
Another one of your
breakout sessions?

793
00:58:04,677 --> 00:58:05,911
Greg, don't you question me.

794
00:58:06,111 --> 00:58:08,414
- You have no right to question me.
- I'm asking you.

795
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:11,550
Okay? I'm asking you.
You're my wife.

796
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:14,453
Yeah. Don't I know it.

797
00:58:18,824 --> 00:58:22,027
Helen, I'm trying to understand
what's happening here.

798
00:58:22,394 --> 00:58:23,963
All right, let me recap for you.

799
00:58:24,463 --> 00:58:25,831
Winter wants to throw us out,

800
00:58:25,965 --> 00:58:27,299
and you're worried about me
talking to him,

801
00:58:27,399 --> 00:58:29,068
instead of trying to figure
out what we gonna do.

802
00:58:29,168 --> 00:58:31,270
Okay, so now it's okay
for me to try.

803
00:58:37,876 --> 00:58:39,078
So, what do you want?

804
00:58:39,912 --> 00:58:43,482
I want you
to not have to ask me that.

805
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:06,171
Can I ask you something?

806
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,275
Sure.

807
00:59:11,443 --> 00:59:13,379
How old were you when you had
your first girlfriend?

808
00:59:16,782 --> 00:59:17,950
I was about your age.

809
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:20,953
Um...
maybe a little bit younger.

810
00:59:21,253 --> 00:59:25,057
I wasn't the macho type,
but I could talk.

811
00:59:25,324 --> 00:59:29,228
Girls like that.
The girls I knew anyway.

812
00:59:30,929 --> 00:59:32,331
I'm not much of a talker.

813
00:59:37,636 --> 00:59:38,537
Is it Zo?

814
00:59:38,772 --> 00:59:40,072
No. No, no, she, uh...

815
00:59:40,172 --> 00:59:41,407
No, you don't even
have to explain.

816
00:59:41,607 --> 00:59:43,976
I mean, is this the first time
you've been around a girl?

817
00:59:48,847 --> 00:59:50,249
Let me ask you a question.

818
00:59:50,949 --> 00:59:51,984
Okay.

819
00:59:52,418 --> 00:59:57,222
How long... you guys been here?
Like, you know, in the bunker?

820
00:59:57,956 --> 00:59:59,491
Not too long. Couple months.

821
00:59:59,992 --> 01:00:01,527
We were living in the trailer
up front.

822
01:00:02,027 --> 01:00:04,330
- Oh.
- I liked it a lot better.

823
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:06,999
Then my... my dad
started hearing about

824
01:00:07,099 --> 01:00:08,667
all this stuff on the news
about everything,

825
01:00:09,468 --> 01:00:12,204
and, uh, he said
we needed to get ready.

826
01:00:17,176 --> 01:00:18,243
Need to get back to work.

827
01:00:18,344 --> 01:00:19,813
<i>No, this is so hard.</i>

828
01:00:19,945 --> 01:00:22,414
- This is so hard.
- No, no, but you can do it. You can do it.

829
01:00:22,481 --> 01:00:25,184
Now, take your right hand
and get your breast.

830
01:00:26,018 --> 01:00:27,787
His nose a little tickle
with the nipple.

831
01:00:29,088 --> 01:00:30,956
You know,
he's ready to latch.

832
01:00:31,023 --> 01:00:34,193
He's ready to latch, so get
his head right on the tip.

833
01:00:34,293 --> 01:00:37,162
Oh. Ow, God, that hurts!
Get him off!

834
01:00:37,262 --> 01:00:38,964
Get him off, please!
Get him off, get him off!

835
01:00:39,031 --> 01:00:40,899
Come on, Amber!
You got to try, Amber!

836
01:00:40,999 --> 01:00:42,568
Just try! The boy needs to eat.

837
01:00:42,668 --> 01:00:44,870
- No, no, no, no, no. Okay...
- You got to try. The boy's...

838
01:00:45,003 --> 01:00:47,172
Listen, unlatch him
or you're gonna do more damage.

839
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:49,608
Helen, I can't do this. I can't
do this. You make it look...

840
01:00:50,008 --> 01:00:51,143
Watch your tone, Amber.

841
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,885
Let's switch to the other side.
Come on.

842
01:01:00,085 --> 01:01:02,321
All right. There you go.

843
01:01:04,123 --> 01:01:06,760
Let's try now. Lift his mouth
right on the tip.

844
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:07,960
Mom, I thought
you were supposed to...

845
01:01:09,094 --> 01:01:10,730
Is it normal
for it to hurt this bad?

846
01:01:11,029 --> 01:01:12,097
No, this... this...

847
01:01:12,264 --> 01:01:14,166
Ow! No, this...
it cannot be normal

848
01:01:14,233 --> 01:01:16,301
- for it to hurt this bad. It cannot be normal...
- Just relax.

849
01:01:16,402 --> 01:01:17,804
- ...for it to hurt this bad!
- Relax.

850
01:01:19,905 --> 01:01:22,074
Lord, Lord,
just give me strength!

851
01:01:22,141 --> 01:01:24,009
Lord, give me strength.

852
01:01:30,884 --> 01:01:32,918
No. This is impossible.

853
01:02:02,614 --> 01:02:03,615
Listen.

854
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:10,522
Listen. Amber's falling apart.
Her nipples are a bloody mess.

855
01:02:10,622 --> 01:02:13,793
Mm-hmm. Yeah, this may be
a more complicated issue.

856
01:02:14,092 --> 01:02:17,596
Her nipples could be inverted.
Daniel could be tongue-tied.

857
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,565
What do...
what do you mean?

858
01:02:19,698 --> 01:02:21,233
Daniel's losing weight.

859
01:02:21,768 --> 01:02:24,670
I mean, we've got to start
thinking about formula.

860
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:27,473
You did think to stock up
on formula?

861
01:02:27,573 --> 01:02:29,274
I mean, after all,
you bought popcorn.

862
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:31,109
Breastfeeding was supposed
to be healthy and free.

863
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:33,212
No one knew
how challenging this would be.

864
01:02:33,278 --> 01:02:35,981
But we've got
to get Daniel some milk.

865
01:04:30,295 --> 01:04:31,764
She doesn't look so good.

866
01:04:50,215 --> 01:04:51,516
It'll be okay, man.

867
01:04:52,819 --> 01:04:54,286
My dad will check on her, okay?

868
01:05:19,846 --> 01:05:21,246
You need to try harder.

869
01:05:21,914 --> 01:05:25,350
You think I don't know that?
And what the fuck is she doing?

870
01:05:25,484 --> 01:05:27,020
She's taking care of your child.

871
01:05:27,152 --> 01:05:29,521
And you're okay with that?

872
01:05:30,355 --> 01:05:32,491
I'm not gonna let her
replace me.

873
01:05:32,658 --> 01:05:35,193
She ain't the one
trying to replace you.

874
01:06:00,652 --> 01:06:04,090
- What was that about?
- Um. Nothing to worry about.

875
01:06:04,589 --> 01:06:06,224
Come on, Dad,
don't do this to me.

876
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:07,726
Don't do to me
what you do to Mom.

877
01:06:07,827 --> 01:06:10,129
- Come on, be straight up.
- Zo, Zo, please.

878
01:06:10,328 --> 01:06:12,065
I'm telling you
everything is okay.

879
01:06:12,165 --> 01:06:13,766
No, everything is not okay.

880
01:06:13,933 --> 01:06:16,468
- I'm not stupid.
- What are you talking about?

881
01:06:16,601 --> 01:06:19,072
- You think I don't know what's going on?
- Okay, what's going on?

882
01:06:19,138 --> 01:06:20,272
I know about you
and that woman.

883
01:06:20,873 --> 01:06:23,341
- That's between me and your mom.
- It's not just between you and her. It's not.

884
01:06:23,675 --> 01:06:26,045
She's feeding that man's baby
right now.

885
01:06:26,445 --> 01:06:27,914
And all she's saying
is trust her,

886
01:06:28,081 --> 01:06:31,084
- but you're not even saying anything.
- Zo, listen, I'm your father.

887
01:06:31,216 --> 01:06:33,251
- Okay?
- And this is your fault.

888
01:06:33,485 --> 01:06:36,756
The fucking world is collapsing.
That's not my fault.

889
01:06:38,124 --> 01:06:39,892
Look, I know you're scared.

890
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,327
So are we.

891
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,803
Your mother and I are trying
to figure this thing out.

892
01:06:51,204 --> 01:06:52,739
It don't look like it.

893
01:06:55,707 --> 01:06:57,709
You can't let him do this
to our family.

894
01:06:58,811 --> 01:06:59,912
You just can't.

895
01:07:11,289 --> 01:07:12,792
I think I'm ready to try again.

896
01:07:14,593 --> 01:07:15,727
Are you sure?

897
01:07:16,796 --> 01:07:18,363
It can take a few weeks
for you to heal,

898
01:07:18,463 --> 01:07:19,531
and the last thing
you want to do

899
01:07:19,631 --> 01:07:22,135
is... hurt yourself even more.

900
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,970
Well, she said
she wanted to try.

901
01:07:41,386 --> 01:07:42,687
You ought to...

902
01:07:43,421 --> 01:07:45,490
You ought to watch
where you put your hands.

903
01:07:49,494 --> 01:07:51,264
Hey. You need to eat that.

904
01:07:51,663 --> 01:07:53,232
We don't let food go to waste
around here.

905
01:07:53,298 --> 01:07:54,633
We eat what we make.

906
01:07:55,433 --> 01:07:57,270
- I'm not hungry.
- Won't keep.

907
01:07:57,636 --> 01:07:59,337
You can warm it up later.

908
01:08:00,807 --> 01:08:05,310
There's a lot going on.
She just needs a little rest.

909
01:08:08,313 --> 01:08:09,581
Okay.

910
01:08:11,683 --> 01:08:14,954
Amber, will you
please fix me a bowl?

911
01:08:32,872 --> 01:08:33,806
Kai.

912
01:08:36,809 --> 01:08:39,879
Finish your dinner, Kai.
Now is not the time.

913
01:08:40,579 --> 01:08:43,182
The boy's inspired.
Let him embrace God's good Word.

914
01:08:43,883 --> 01:08:47,854
Doesn't the Word tell him
to honor his mom and his father?

915
01:08:49,755 --> 01:08:52,058
Your father's telling you
to eat your dinner.

916
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:03,002
Hey, Dad.

917
01:09:03,836 --> 01:09:07,505
Uh, one of the hens...
she doesn't look too good.

918
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:09,541
Don't beat around the bush.

919
01:09:09,641 --> 01:09:11,277
The bird's about to die,
just say so.

920
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:12,845
Either an asset or a liability.

921
01:09:14,646 --> 01:09:17,649
Chickens, people,
all the same to you, hmm?

922
01:09:20,152 --> 01:09:22,889
Chickens are more dependable.

923
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,035
Greg.

924
01:10:11,370 --> 01:10:13,438
Time to wake up, Greg.

925
01:10:16,342 --> 01:10:17,676
- Greg.
- Hey.

926
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:20,780
- Greg has a surprise for everybody.
- Hey.

927
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,082
Right, Greg? Hmm?

928
01:10:23,316 --> 01:10:25,384
What were you planning, Greg?

929
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:27,219
- What's...
- What's going on?

930
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:29,255
Get up.

931
01:10:29,454 --> 01:10:30,423
Go!

932
01:10:30,588 --> 01:10:32,490
Kai, get Mia.

933
01:10:33,225 --> 01:10:34,226
Come on.

934
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:39,131
- Get in there. Get in there!
- Greg! Stay here!

935
01:10:40,132 --> 01:10:42,001
- What's going on?
- Please stop!

936
01:10:42,101 --> 01:10:43,736
- Stop!
- Hey, Dad!

937
01:10:43,903 --> 01:10:44,971
Dad!

938
01:10:45,338 --> 01:10:46,372
Stop!

939
01:10:46,504 --> 01:10:48,107
- What's going on? Zoe!
- Winter!

940
01:10:51,043 --> 01:10:52,345
Guys! Come on.

941
01:10:52,644 --> 01:10:54,579
- Winter!
- Dad!

942
01:10:54,814 --> 01:10:56,681
- Kai, get back.
- Wait.

943
01:11:01,653 --> 01:11:03,289
Dad, please! Put...

944
01:11:05,257 --> 01:11:06,292
Oh, my God.

945
01:11:06,759 --> 01:11:08,560
Dad.

946
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:13,733
- Oh, my God.
- Look at me!

947
01:11:15,134 --> 01:11:17,169
Look at me.

948
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:18,938
Please, don't.

949
01:11:19,671 --> 01:11:23,209
See,
this is what happens, Greg,

950
01:11:23,342 --> 01:11:24,810
when you try and take
what's mine.

951
01:11:24,877 --> 01:11:26,611
I'm trying to take what's yours?

952
01:11:26,711 --> 01:11:30,449
You should be thanking me.
Everybody here contributes!

953
01:11:30,648 --> 01:11:32,818
But you, all you do is take!

954
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,354
Right? You take!

955
01:11:35,788 --> 01:11:39,557
You live inside your head,
while people like me...

956
01:11:40,826 --> 01:11:43,496
- end up with that...
- Please.

957
01:11:43,628 --> 01:11:46,032
protecting people like you.

958
01:11:48,334 --> 01:11:50,403
I took you in, Greg.

959
01:11:50,503 --> 01:11:52,738
- I fed you!
- Mom, make him stop.

960
01:11:52,838 --> 01:11:57,709
Your family! Helen! I provided
for you! I protected you!

961
01:11:59,412 --> 01:12:01,113
And you can't protect her!

962
01:12:01,514 --> 01:12:05,484
You can't protect her, Greg!
Not like I can!

963
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:13,759
You don't have to do this.

964
01:12:18,696 --> 01:12:20,766
- He goes.
- What?

965
01:12:25,871 --> 01:12:28,640
- <i>The boy goes, too.</i>
- <i>No!</i>

966
01:14:50,382 --> 01:14:53,085
Mm. This is good.

967
01:14:56,956 --> 01:14:59,058
Zoe. Come on, have some.

968
01:15:01,227 --> 01:15:02,361
Why?

969
01:15:04,463 --> 01:15:08,367
- Oh, I know you're upset.
- Because you won't let us leave?

970
01:15:10,669 --> 01:15:12,071
The new normal.

971
01:15:12,838 --> 01:15:13,939
"New normal"?

972
01:15:15,307 --> 01:15:16,275
That what you said? What?

973
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:17,910
There's no such thing
as "new normal."

974
01:15:17,977 --> 01:15:19,245
No, baby,

975
01:15:19,311 --> 01:15:23,315
anybody who believes in that
got conned.

976
01:15:25,718 --> 01:15:26,952
Now...

977
01:15:28,053 --> 01:15:29,388
while we're scraping by
down here,

978
01:15:29,455 --> 01:15:32,324
I guarantee you there's somebody
up there living like a king.

979
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:34,126
Right, Matty?

980
01:15:35,461 --> 01:15:36,829
That's not new.

981
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:39,098
That's normal.

982
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:43,836
Oh, we are blessed.

983
01:15:45,271 --> 01:15:49,341
We can live under the open sky
the way the Lord intended.

984
01:15:50,744 --> 01:15:52,044
We grow our own food.

985
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,749
Now, you don't put poison
in your body.

986
01:15:55,814 --> 01:15:58,884
Your body can heal itself.
You don't need drugs.

987
01:16:00,419 --> 01:16:01,387
Don't need pills.

988
01:16:02,955 --> 01:16:07,926
We don't have to answer
to some corrupt politicians,

989
01:16:08,327 --> 01:16:10,129
robbing us blind,
sending good men

990
01:16:10,195 --> 01:16:13,432
to far away...
...places to do bad things.

991
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:19,004
Y'all answer to me.

992
01:16:20,506 --> 01:16:21,840
I answer to the Almighty.

993
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:59,578
Where'd you find that?

994
01:17:59,238 --> 01:18:00,272
<i>Hey, Brooke.</i>

995
01:18:00,372 --> 01:18:01,775
<i>I was thinking about
what you said.</i>

996
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:05,377
<i>It still hurts, you know?
Maybe you don't.</i>

997
01:18:05,611 --> 01:18:08,614
<i>I love Greg, and I know
he loves me. I just...</i>

998
01:18:09,248 --> 01:18:11,283
<i>He made me feel like
I was in this alone.</i>

999
01:18:11,885 --> 01:18:13,887
<i>Maybe I made him
feel like that, too.</i>

1000
01:18:14,653 --> 01:18:16,054
<i>It's just hard.</i>

1001
01:18:17,089 --> 01:18:20,092
<i>Anyway, I love you.
Call me when you get home.</i>

1002
01:19:16,648 --> 01:19:18,183
I'll be out in a few minutes.

1003
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,534
Don't be afraid.

1004
01:19:40,405 --> 01:19:41,440
I'm not.

1005
01:19:53,853 --> 01:19:55,087
Good.

1006
01:20:08,902 --> 01:20:10,135
You are...

1007
01:20:11,004 --> 01:20:13,205
You are a beautiful woman.

1008
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:16,542
Decent.

1009
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:20,546
You're a good mother,
strong-willed.

1010
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,681
This man...

1011
01:20:24,984 --> 01:20:26,218
wants you.

1012
01:20:28,888 --> 01:20:30,790
This man, he needs you.

1013
01:20:37,596 --> 01:20:39,498
I've waited for this.

1014
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,502
I know.

1015
01:20:46,171 --> 01:20:47,606
Tell me you want this.

1016
01:20:49,207 --> 01:20:51,310
It's not that simple.

1017
01:20:55,014 --> 01:20:57,149
You being here is no accident.

1018
01:21:00,118 --> 01:21:02,855
Winter, I'm married.

1019
01:21:03,923 --> 01:21:05,157
He's gone.

1020
01:21:08,061 --> 01:21:10,729
- He's not coming back.
- Maybe.

1021
01:21:14,067 --> 01:21:15,467
Remember what it felt like.

1022
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:18,570
You loved a woman.

1023
01:21:20,405 --> 01:21:21,941
When you left, she betrayed you.

1024
01:21:24,376 --> 01:21:26,278
No, baby, this is different.

1025
01:21:28,347 --> 01:21:29,281
Is it?

1026
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:32,484
What are you gonna think of me

1027
01:21:33,285 --> 01:21:35,822
when you realize
I'm the type of woman

1028
01:21:36,355 --> 01:21:39,892
that wouldn't wait a day
after claiming to love...

1029
01:21:42,527 --> 01:21:43,528
love a man?

1030
01:21:45,497 --> 01:21:46,698
Her husband?

1031
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:49,836
The father of her children?

1032
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:55,842
Is that the type of woman
you want?

1033
01:21:57,342 --> 01:21:58,778
You need me, Helen.

1034
01:21:59,277 --> 01:22:00,646
Not like this.

1035
01:22:02,347 --> 01:22:03,750
It has to be right.

1036
01:22:04,751 --> 01:22:05,717
Helen.

1037
01:22:06,919 --> 01:22:08,186
Let it be right.

1038
01:22:54,901 --> 01:22:55,902
Don't move, okay?

1039
01:22:59,504 --> 01:23:01,808
I know you're scared,
but I got to go get your mom,

1040
01:23:01,941 --> 01:23:04,744
Zoe and Mia. I'll be back.

1041
01:24:34,033 --> 01:24:37,435
Dad!

1042
01:24:38,204 --> 01:24:40,705
Geez.

1043
01:24:46,411 --> 01:24:47,679
Get down, Matty!

1044
01:24:49,115 --> 01:24:50,283
Amber, get back in your room!

1045
01:24:50,382 --> 01:24:52,118
Everybody, Helen, Helen,
get down! Get down!

1046
01:24:52,218 --> 01:24:55,288
- I'm coming with you.
- You stay with the women.

1047
01:24:55,654 --> 01:24:57,355
Hatch stays locked.

1048
01:25:00,392 --> 01:25:03,262
The bedrooms are safe.
Get in the bedrooms!

1049
01:25:03,562 --> 01:25:06,065
- You can't leave us down here.
- Stay low.

1050
01:25:09,735 --> 01:25:12,038
Okay, Amber, close that door.
Close it!

1051
01:26:00,753 --> 01:26:01,988
Winter!

1052
01:26:19,005 --> 01:26:21,974
Amber, take the baby
in the other room.

1053
01:26:27,579 --> 01:26:30,750
Give me that!
There's got to be another key!

1054
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:32,018
Where is it?

1055
01:26:32,385 --> 01:26:35,121
- My dad told me not to say anything.
- Come on, boy!

1056
01:26:36,188 --> 01:26:37,689
Come on.

1057
01:26:45,164 --> 01:26:46,531
Oh, it was here.

1058
01:26:52,138 --> 01:26:55,573
Uh-uh-uh-uh. Stay down.

1059
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:42,989
Though I walk
through the valley

1060
01:27:43,055 --> 01:27:44,090
of the shadow of death,

1061
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:49,195
I will fear no evil,
for you are with me.

1062
01:27:49,962 --> 01:27:52,365
Your rod and staff,
they comfort me.

1063
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:56,402
You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.

1064
01:28:23,796 --> 01:28:24,964
Ma!

1065
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,736
No, no, Greg.
Okay, Greg.

1066
01:28:30,836 --> 01:28:35,174
Step on out.
I got ya.

1067
01:28:45,384 --> 01:28:47,585
Oh, Greg. I see you.

1068
01:28:48,854 --> 01:28:50,722
Come on, take it like
a man. Come on out.

1069
01:28:51,057 --> 01:28:53,125
Get back. Get back.

1070
01:28:56,429 --> 01:28:58,464
I can see you.
Come on out.

1071
01:28:58,563 --> 01:28:59,664
Move!

1072
01:29:03,002 --> 01:29:05,738
- Come on out.
- Winter!

1073
01:29:06,472 --> 01:29:07,672
Put it down.

1074
01:29:09,641 --> 01:29:10,843
Put it down.

1075
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,748
- Put it down.
- Helen.

1076
01:29:21,619 --> 01:29:24,156
- What? Helen.
- Don't you say my name.

1077
01:29:25,324 --> 01:29:26,525
Baby.

1078
01:29:27,059 --> 01:29:29,128
Honey, you don't know
what you're doing. Come on.

1079
01:29:29,228 --> 01:29:30,563
Oh, I do.

1080
01:29:30,695 --> 01:29:34,033
I do. Trust me. Put it down.
Put it down!

1081
01:29:35,101 --> 01:29:38,904
You know I...
I can't. I can't do that.

1082
01:29:40,605 --> 01:29:41,907
You know I can't do that.

1083
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:47,580
How you gonna make it?

1084
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:48,848
You can't make it
out here without me.

1085
01:29:48,948 --> 01:29:50,615
How you gonna... you're not
that type of woman.

1086
01:29:50,783 --> 01:29:54,520
You don't know shit about me.

1087
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:00,259
You wouldn't.

1088
01:30:05,697 --> 01:30:09,235
Ah. You wouldn't do that.

1089
01:30:12,738 --> 01:30:14,106
You wouldn't.

1090
01:30:14,373 --> 01:30:16,041
Daniel's not my son.

1091
01:30:16,775 --> 01:30:18,844
And you aren't my husband!

1092
01:30:30,655 --> 01:30:32,057
Dad!

1093
01:30:37,662 --> 01:30:39,365
That's fine.

1094
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:45,538
Dad!

1095
01:30:59,451 --> 01:31:01,820
Ah, my hand!

1096
01:31:16,435 --> 01:31:17,903
<i>Chickens have</i>

1097
01:31:18,003 --> 01:31:20,406
<i>a survival instinct
just like we do.</i>

1098
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:23,242
<i>Theirs tell them
to find a high roost</i>

1099
01:31:23,309 --> 01:31:25,277
<i>before nightfall
to avoid predators.</i>

1100
01:31:25,411 --> 01:31:28,380
<i>Ours tells us
that we have a choice...</i>

1101
01:31:30,549 --> 01:31:32,985
<i>...to run, to hide</i>

1102
01:31:33,752 --> 01:31:35,054
<i>or to fight.</i>

1103
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:40,426
I'm sorry.

1104
01:31:44,729 --> 01:31:45,731
Me, too.

1105
01:31:46,031 --> 01:31:48,200
<i>Within the flock,
the pecking order remains.</i>

1106
01:31:48,567 --> 01:31:52,371
<i>If you remove the aggressor,
the hierarchy resets...</i>

1107
01:31:53,539 --> 01:31:54,573
Hey, look!

1108
01:31:54,773 --> 01:31:56,442
<i>...and everyone finds
their place again.</i>

1109
01:31:56,976 --> 01:31:59,144
<i>But the flock will always
need a leader.</i>

1110
01:32:00,279 --> 01:32:03,249
<i>And sometimes
the one who emerges</i>

1111
01:32:03,649 --> 01:32:05,851
<i>is the one you least expect.</i>
