00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,791
[panicked breathing]

177
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,750
Nobody goes outside.

178
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,208
[breathing shakily]

179
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,416
[panel beeps]

180
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,666
[hostage taker]
Don't leave! Get back here!

181
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,708
[breathing heavily]

182
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,291
-[male officer] Hey, you! Move!
-[female officer] Out of the way, move!

183
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,916
[breathing heavily]

184
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,541
[music fades]

185
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,708
[muffled screaming in background]

186
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,791
[breathing heavily]

187
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,416
[pop music playing faintly]

188
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,750
[breathing heavily]

189
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:04,708
Hands, bro.

190
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,166
Hands.

191
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,208
What?

192
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,541
[gun clicks]

193
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:13,416
Put your hands behind your back,
stay down and shut the fuck up, okay?

194
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,625
[Ilian breathing heavily]

195
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,958
[tense, quirky music playing]

196
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,666
Okay, don't move.

197
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,541
[sirens wailing in distance]

198
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,041
[both panting shakily]

199
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,041
It's one man. He has a weapon,
camouflage clothing.

200
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,958
Send more units.

201
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,375
OC, he's wearing an explosive vest.

202
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,541
[breathing heavily]

203
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,416
Stay down, bro.

204
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:36,666
Jesus.

205
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,416
OC, we're being shot at.
When is our backup arriving?

206
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,833
Close all of Leidseplein off.
Where's the DSI?

207
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,000
Ten minutes out.

208
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,791
-Injured, dead? How many armed?
-We only know of one man.

209
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,125
Robbery, attack, terrorism?
What should I say?

210
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,666
Who should report?

211
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,875
Everyone.

212
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,333
[phone vibrating]

213
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,625
This is Winston.

214
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,416
-Yes, understood.
-[sighs]

215
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,250
I need a few seconds.

216
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,708
Hey.

217
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,125
Give dad a hug. Mm. I'll be right back.

218
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,625
I love you guys.

219
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,291
-[boy] You'll be back soon?
-You bet.

220
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,291
Okay.

221
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,208
I love you.

222
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,333
I know.

223
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,000
Bye.

224
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:36,791
Hey.

225
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:38,875
Be careful.

226
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,458
I will.

227
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,875
[tense music playing]

228
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,958
[siren wailing]

229
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,833

[dog barks]

231
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,625
[operator] Call for all available units.
Priority one incident at Leidseplein.

232
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,458
Operation instructions to follow.

233
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:09,333
14-11, the DSI are on their way.
Stay back and keep cover.

234
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,666

[sirens wailing]

236
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,000
Attention all units,
do not enter Leidseplein.

237
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,333
Close off all access roads.

238
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,000
No one is to enter Leidseplein.

239
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,208
I repeat, Leidseplein is being closed off.

240
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,875
If you're arriving on site,
we're recommending you use Kevlar vests.

241
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,541
-CCTR, can you hear me?
-[man] Yes.

242
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,208
All cameras on the Apple Store.

243
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,791
-[man] I'm on it.
-Stand by.

247
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:48,958
Excuse me.

248
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,708
-Yeah?
-Kees, it's Karina.

249
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,708
We need you at operation control ASAP.
Shit's hit the fan

250
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,708
Possible hostage situation
in the Apple Store.

251
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,208
I'm on my way.

252
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,458
[suspenseful music playing]

253
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,000
Checkmate.

254
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,250
Sorry, man, duty calls.

255
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,083
-[breathing heavily]
-[distant sirens]

256
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,208
[hostage taker] Bro. Bro.

257
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,375
Stand up.

258
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,291
Stand up, bro.

259
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,125
Come on.

260
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,208
[Ilian panting]

261
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,750
Let's take a walk.

262
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,541
[sirens wailing]

263
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,958
[sirens get louder]

264
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,833
I want a negotiator.

265
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,041
I'm ready to talk.

266
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,916
I said go get me a negotiator.

267
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,083
Or I'll blow this whole block up.

268
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,875
What's your problem?
Stop hiding! Stop hiding!

269
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,291
-[gunshot fires]
-Fuck.

270
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,541
With me. Come on.

271
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,291
[tense music playing]

272
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,041
Sit. Sit.

273
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,791
Stay there.

274
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,458

[breathing shakily]

277
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,208
Sir?

278
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,375
Am I gonna die?

279
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,291
You just listen. Don't talk, okay?

280
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,458
INTAKE + TASKFORCE

281
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,833
112 Police.
What's the location of your emergency?

282
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,541
[hostage taker] I'm in the store
right now.

283
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,166
In the Apple Store.

284
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:33,000
I have demands.
I want to talk to a negotiator.

285
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,916
Sorry, repeat that, who are you?

286
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,750
I'm the hostage taker.
Get a negotiator on the phone.

287
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,833
A mediator. Someone I can trust.
Stop pretending.

288
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,875
I'm dead serious.
Get me someone who can handle this.

289
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,791
-Karina? He's on the phone.
-Don't play with me.

290
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,166
Or this whole place goes up.

291
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,833
Hello? Are you there? Hello!

292
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,166
Yeah. I'm here. I'm here.

293
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,666
You want to speak to a negotiator,
do I have that right?

294
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,875
Yeah, are you fucking deaf?

295
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,833
I want to negotiate.

296
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,166
Just a minute
while we find you a negotiator.

297
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,541
That's good.
You have my number now, right?

298
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,375
You can call me from now on. Okay?

299
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,083
[tense music playing]

300
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,375
They're gonna call me back.

301
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,416
[music intensifies]

302
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,458
[whispering] What shall we do?

303
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,083
[breathing shakily]

304
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,958
-We have to get out of here.
-[whispering] Ma'am, wait.

305
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,625
We have to be really quiet, okay?

306
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:46,000
He doesn't know we're in here
so if we're quiet he won't hear us.

307
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,791
Wait, ma'am.
We're all dead if you open that door.

308
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,083
Mom, we can't leave.

309
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,916
[mom sighing]

310
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,541
[breathing heavily]

311
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,041
Does anyone have their phone?

312
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,166
It's sitting out there.

313
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,125
Oh, man.

314
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,916
-Can I use your phone?
-Yeah.

315
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,541
[connection tone]

316
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,291
112 Police.
What's the location of your emergency?

317
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,958
[whispering] Hi, my name's Mingus.

318
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,125
Um, there's a group of us
in a closet in the Apple Store.

319
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,875
There's a man here with a machine gun.

320
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,500
You said you're in a closet
in the Apple Store?

321
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,500
Where in the store?

322
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,875
[Mingus] The ground floor,
across from the elevator.

323
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,375
I work here.
I snuck people into the closet.

324
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,458
[operator] Okay.
How many people are with you?

325
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,541
[Mingus] Four.

326
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,375
[operator] Are you safe in there?

327
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,208
Um…

328
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,416
Mingus?

329
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,583
-Hello?
-[quietly] No.

330
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,375
Okay. Can anyone see you?
Does anyone know you're in there?

331
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,666
No. The door's locked
and it can only be opened with a key card.

332
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,833
[tapping on keyboard]

333
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,208
Okay, got it.

334
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,833
And have you seen the assailants, Mingus?

335
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,000
How many are there?

336
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,708
-Fuck. I think it's just one guy, right?
-Yeah.

337
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,708
Yeah, one. He fired a gun.

338
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,500
But I also saw people run upstairs,
to the Genius area.

339
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,833
[operator] Thank you, Mingus,

340
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,166
we know about the people
who escaped upstairs.

341
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,916
They've been in contact with us already.

342
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:38,875
[whimpering]

343
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:42,708
The most important thing you can do now
is not attract attention, okay?

344
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,333
Our team is outside.

345
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,666
Just be patient, we're gonna get
this situation under control.

346
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,583
Just give us time.

347
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,166
[pilot 1] Leidseplein is on the left.

348
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,500
[pilot 2] Yes, I put it on the left
so you have a nice line of sight.

349
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,125
[pilot 1] Zulu has arrived
and we have eyes on the square.

350
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,708
You're good to go in, OC.

351
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,291
We can see the two officers in the square.

352
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,041
Let's get them out of there.

-[indistinct radio chatter]

354
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,166
Hey, they're trapped.
They're pinned down over there.

355
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,375
Uh, 80-14 OC.

356
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,791
Our officers are trapped in front.
They're sitting ducks right now.

357
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,208
If they can't come to us,
we'll go to them. We're moving in.

358
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,541
[male officer]
All officers are standing by.

359
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:37,000
OC, the vehicle is heading
toward the Hirsch building.

360
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,416
[dramatic music continues]

361
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,375
The situation's stable,
but things could escalate.

362
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,958
Keep everyone as far away as you can.

363
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,041
[music fades]

00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,583
[helicopter whirring]

365
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,750
Come, bro, come. Come!

366
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,958
Come. Come here. Come on.

372
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,791
[hostage taker] Come here.

373
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,875
Don't try anything stupid, okay?

374
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:25,708
Sit.

375
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,625
Sit.

376
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,208
So they can see you.

377
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,791
[pop music playing faintly]

378
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,708
My name is Ilian.

379
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:00,958
I'm from Bulgaria.

380
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,750
Hey. I don't care, man.

381
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:18,166
[woman] Get everyone off
the streets, understood?

382
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,291
Keep 'em on the line.

383
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,916
-Hey.
-Okay, talk to me.

384
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,458
We know that there's a man
inside the Leidseplein Apple Store

385
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:26,791
with an automatic weapon.

386
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,833
He's fired several times,
but no one's hurt.

387
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,041
Four people have hidden in a closet
on the ground floor

388
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,541
across from the elevator.

389
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,708
As far as we know he has one hostage,

390
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,666
and there are people trapped
on the floor above.

391
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,833
-There's 40 or 50 of them.
-Okay.

392
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:43,250
Have they called in?
Are we sure it's not a hostage situation?

393
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,208
Yeah, we have them on the line.

394
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,000
For now they're safe,
he doesn't know that they're there.

395
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,750
-We'll have a problem if he goes upstairs.
-Okay.

396
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,625
Our first priority is getting them out.

397
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,291
-Comms check. Valerie, can you hear me?
-Yes, Kees. I hear you.

398
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,291
And he's requested a negotiator.

399
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,791
-A negotiator, is that right?
-Yeah.

400
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,458
That's a first for me.

401
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,666
-Where do you want the command center?
-Here.

402
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Have routine updates go to Zaanstad.
We'll run it from here.

403
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,041
The negotiators will go in there.

404
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,375
His number.

405
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,166
-[Kees] What's this?
-You have to call him.

406
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,958
The mayor's on vacation
and the commissioner's on his way.

407
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,416
-Now I'm an operator?
-It's what the protocol says.

408
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,666
My concern is the hostages,
arresting this guy and getting them out.

409
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,500
Kees? The DSI's closing in. One minute.

-[man] Winston?

416
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,791
-[Winston] Hey, who's in charge?
-Double Zero.

417
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:55,958
Holy shit. Double Zero?

418
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:58,333
Welcome, Winston. Sorry for calling you.

419
00:24:58,416 --> 00:24:59,666
[Winston] Tell that to the wife.

420
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,583
I'll send Maya flowers
when this is all over, deal?

421
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:07,041
[Winston] Flowers? You'll need to buy
Keukenhof to make up for this one, chief.

422
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:10,916
Listen, there's about 40 people
trapped on the floor above the store.

423
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,625
We need to get them out of there ASAP.

424
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:18,125
Once we have the floor plan, I want
a tactical analysis. Then we're going in.

425
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,333
Not before.

426
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:20,875
-Hey.
-Hey.

427
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:24,500
Team Alpha, prepare for entry.
Bravo and Charlie will take

428
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:26,666
things over from the officers
on the ground.

429
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,958
We're covering the whole scene.

430
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:31,250
Priority, evacuate
all retailers and offices. Understood?

431
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:32,208
[Winston] Okay, copy.

432
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:35,333
Guys, we've got to get
these officers out of here. Let's go.

-We have the building layout?
-Some floors are missing.

438
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,250
Wait, what floors are missing?

439
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,291
The Apple Store itself.
We can't track them down.

[sirens wailing]

441
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:09,250

I want those floor plans now. Understand?

Hey, Abe. Glad you could make it.

445
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,041
Kees, the negotiators
are on their way in now.

446
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:37,250
Have fun with that. I'm going to Leidse.

447
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,458
[pilot 1] Leidseplein Square
on the left at ten o'clock.

448
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,250
[pilot 2] Holding off for now.

449
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,916
[pilot 1] Yes, OC, we'll descend slightly
and keep an appropriate distance.

450
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
[music continues]

451
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:49,291

[keyboard tapping]

453
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:02,541
-Okay, Lynn, you're number one.
-What's the situation?

454
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:05,541
He has hostages, motive unknown.
We think it's just the one guy.

455
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,250
Okay. So is that everything?

456
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:09,958
You should know that he asked
for a negotiator almost immediately.

457
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:10,875
He insisted on it.

458
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:13,000
-Where's our set up at?
-There.

459
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,583
In this circus?

460
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:19,000
Ugh, I get it, but I want us all together.

461
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:21,375
It's the plan, for now.

462
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,291
We're not sure
if snipers can hit him or not,

463
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,208
the glass at the store is really thick.

464
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,541
Be aware that there are
explosives attached to him.

465
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,125
And he's holding a detonator.

466
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:32,041
So taking him out from a distance
isn't an option.

467
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:35,166
This also means letting him leave
with explosives can't be an option.

468
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,291
He needs to come out without explosives,

469
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:40,458
or we bide our time,
he'll crumble if we wear him down.

470
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:43,125
I'll get him out. Promise you that.

471
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,125
Lynn.

472
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,166

Hey. Everyone ready?

00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:21,916
[Winston] We're just waiting
for the floor plans. Any word?

481
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,791
-Not yet.
-[Winston] Fuck.

482
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,750
-Is that him?
-[Winston] Yeah.

483
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,833

00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:09,375
[phone ringing]

526
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:11,666
Lynn speaking.

527
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:14,000
[hostage taker] Yeah, hello.

528
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,000
Hi, I'm happy you called us back.

529
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:18,375
You asked for a negotiator.

530
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,583
-Isn't that right?
-Yeah, that's right.

531
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:24,958
-That's me. My name's Lynn.
-Yeah, you said that.

532
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,791
-Twice already.
-Can I have your name?

533
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:29,625
That doesn't matter.

534
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:32,708
Make something up.
You're going to find out eventually.

535
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:33,750
[Lynn] Okay.

536
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,916
We can talk about anything.

537
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,333
Shouldn't I just tell you
what you can do for me?

538
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,750
Huh?

539
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,583
Isn't that what this is all about? Right?

540
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:45,583
-Come on.
-[whispers] He's coming.

541
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,875
[hostage taker chuckles]
Do you think I'm stupid, is that it?

542
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:53,166
[Lynn] Well, I think we have
a situation here

543
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,625
and we should try
to get out of it together.

544
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:58,083
[hostage taker] I don't have a situation.

545
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:02,333
You've got a situation.
Let me tell you exactly what I want.

546
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,208
-My demands.
-[Lynn] That's why I called.

547
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,125
[hostage taker] Yeah? Okay.

548
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:14,250
I want 200 million in Bitcoin
and free passage.

549
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,916
200 million?

550
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:20,333
Yeah. What?
You're not hard of hearing, are you?

551
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,333
[Lynn muffled] No.
I just wanted to make sure

552
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:28,333
I heard you correctly.
I mean, it's a big sum, right?

553
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:29,916
It's a big sum?!

554
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,875
Is that a joke? That's nothing to you.
That's pocket change to you people.

555
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,541
Not to me, and as payment
for you've done to me,

556
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:38,791
200 million is nothing.

557
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,625
I'm letting you off easy.

558
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:43,875
Listen, I've got enough explosives
to incinerate this plaza, you understand?

559
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,500
-I understand, we--
-[phone disconnects]

560
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:49,416
Hung up.

561
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:52,125
Lay down, stay on the ground.

562
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,125
[tense, somber music playing]

563
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:00,333
He said he's going to blow up the plaza.

564
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:02,875
[mom sighs]

565
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:06,625
Fuck. I shouldn't even be here.

566
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:10,250
You kept me waiting here
for that fucking laptop.

567
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,666
If you had kept your mouth shut,
I wouldn't even be here now.

568
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,750
Were you helping him?

569
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:16,458
[sighs]

570
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:17,791
Hey.

571
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,583
-Yeah?
-[mom] Enough.

572
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,250
This won't help us get out of here.

573
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:25,375
[girl] What are you talking about?

574
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:28,166
He wasn't helping him.
It wasn't his fault, all right?

575
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,958
[ominous music playing]

576

00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:47,875
Sir?

-[music fades]
-[helicopter whirring]

579
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,125
Excuse me, sir.

580
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:55,208
What?

581
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,666
You spoke to the police just now?

582
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,333
What did they say?

583
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,666
How much money do you want?

584
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,833
A lot.

585
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:12,000
Okay?

586
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:16,791
Enough to pay everything.

587
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:18,583
You know why?

588
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,083
Because they all tried to fuck me.

589
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:25,333
The police,
the justice department, the government.

590
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,875
They all tried to fuck me.
My life is over!

591
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,541
They, they ruined my fucking life!

592
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:31,083
They all tried to fuck me!

593
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:32,875
I understand.

594
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:37,625
But, please,
I don't want to fuck with you, brother.

595
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:39,708
[tense music playing]

596
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:43,833
No.

597
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:46,500
You won't fuck with me.

598
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:51,250
But you know why you won't?
If you try something,

599
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:53,125
I will kill you.

600
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,916
And if they try something,

601
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,208
I will blow up this whole building.

602
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,541
My brother.

603
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:13,791
Smile.

606
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:30,833
[Kees] What's this?

607
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:35,541
-How'd we get this?
-It appears he sent it in to AT5 just now.

608
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:38,458
-Don't let this photo go public, okay?
-Yeah, on it.

609
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:41,333
[Kees] Abe, I just sent you a photo.

610
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,791
-Is the bomb squad there?
-Fuck.

611
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,541
[whistles]

612
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,750
We need to know the type of explosive.

613
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,166
-Can you get a confirmation?
-[Abe] Stand by.

614
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:56,208
Well?

615
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,875
From this photo,
they look like fake explosives.

616
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:04,750
Fake?

617
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:07,208
-They won't explode then?
-I wouldn't hinge it on a photo.

618
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:10,791
-It's not that simple.
-Your advice isn't helpful, as usual.

619
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,250
[sighs] I'm just telling you what I see.

620
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:16,583
Do we know what's
in the other bags he has in there?

621
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,125
No. Why?

622
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,125
Let's say a detonation happens.

623
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:23,000
And he's hidden explosives inside them.

624
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:26,250
-[Abe] The Apple Store is blown up?
-Not just the Apple Store.

625
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'd get my men further back if I were you.

626
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,458
You'll never be me.

627
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,708
You hear that, Kees?

628
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:37,833
I heard it.

629
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,416
[Winston] Stop.

630
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,458
-[pounds on hood]
-That's good.

631
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:50,458
-[Winston] Chief.
-Hey.

632
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:53,500
Okay. I need two plans.

633
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:57,625
One, get the people upstairs out
as quickly and as quietly as possible.

634
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:01,875
-[Winston] Okay.
-Two, we rush in through the ground floor.

635
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:03,541
He's wearing explosives.

636
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:08,916
No idea if they're real or not.
We can't really tell from out here.

637
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,625
We know he has one hostage

638
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:11,958
and four people are holed up

639
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:13,708
in a closet
on the ground floor behind him.

640
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,875
[Winston] He doesn't know?

641
00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:17,500
Not yet.

643

[whispering] I'm sorry.

644
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,583
I was just trying to help you.
I had no idea that--

645
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:40,125
No, it's okay.

646
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:43,875
None of this is your fault, I know that.

647
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:48,375
I'm sorry that I said it. I was angry.

648
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,541
My name's Mingus, by the way.

649
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:05,500
Lukas.

650
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,500
[whispering] I'm Bente.

651
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:15,166
I'm Soof.

652
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:19,000
And this is my… [crying softly]

653
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:20,583
…daughter.

654
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,458
So, Mingus, do you have kids?

655
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:27,875
Yeah, a son.

656
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,583
Nigel, he's really…

657
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,166
[chuckles softly]

658
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,958
He's a great little guy.

659
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,875
We were gonna see Ajax tonight.

660
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:43,375
[Soof] How about you?

661
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,583
-Any kids?
-No.

662
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:51,875
I've got a great girlfriend, but, um…
It's just, uh…

663
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,958
Yeah, it's a bit complicated.

664
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:58,083
Tonight we had plans
to get dinner together.

665
00:39:58,166 --> 00:39:59,875
[gentle music playing]

666
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:02,708
She's probably wondering where I am.

667
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:04,750
[sighs] We'll have another fight now.

668
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:06,333

-Hello?
-Mingus, this is Mark.

676
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:04,458
I'm with the police.

677
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:08,416
I'm going to be your contact person
from now on, okay?

678
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,041
I'm very close by. I just parked
on Leidseplein opposite the store.

679
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:12,958
[Mingus] Okay.

680
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,833
How is everyone holding up?

681
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,541
[whispering] We're all right. Just scared.

682
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:21,875
He must have hostages right?

683
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:24,875
If he didn't,
you guys would have gone in by now.

684
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:28,125
Yes, we're in contact with him.
Negotiators are working with him now.

685
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:32,125
We're doing our best to get this over with
as soon as we can, Mingus.

686
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:35,083
We're setting aside this line
for you to call, but stay quiet.

687
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,166
Okay.

688
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:39,541
I hope he doesn't know we're in here.

689
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:42,625
[Mark] I don't think he does,
as far as what we can gather.

690
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,916
And there's music in the store,
so that helps.

691
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:48,458
Shit.

692
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:49,750
Not for long.

693
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:52,458
Why'd you say not for long?

694
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,125
The music turns off at closing time,
at nine o'clock.

695
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:58,791
And the alarm goes off
if there are people inside.

696
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,375
[Mark] Okay.

697
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:05,208
Do you know if there's a way to keep
the lights and music on for longer?

698
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:07,958
The security's automatic
and they run it from America.

699
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:09,750
[Mark] Okay, I'll look into it.

700
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:12,500
Put your phone on silent,
and on low-battery mode.

701
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:15,000
Don't use anything
that could use up battery. Okay?

702
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,333
Okay.

703
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:20,833
[radio beeps]

704
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,458
Kees, we need to contact Apple.

705
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,250
The security system's on a timer.

706
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:28,375
So the lights and music inside
will shut off and the alarm will trigger.

707
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,791
[phone ringing]

708
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,750
[pop music playing faintly]

709
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:44,333
Is the money ready?

710
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:47,583
Listen, there's a chance that
you're going to lose the lights and music.

711
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,125
Normally the store closes now,

712
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:51,833
since you're walking around,
it could set the alarm off, all right?

713
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:54,708
But that's not us, okay?

714
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:57,750
It happens automatically,
just know it's normal.

715
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:00,416
Come. Come. Come on. Get up.

716
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,708
[tense music playing]

717
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,666
[hostage taker] Stay calm.
This whole block will go up in flames.

718
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,625
Don't lie to me, Lynn.

719
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:13,791
Don't lie to me, okay?

720
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:16,916
[Lynn] I'm not lying to you.
You can trust me.

721
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,291
It's automatic security.
Just keep talking to me when it goes off.

722
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:23,458
-Please don't.
-[Lynn] You have to trust me.

723
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:24,625
Don't do this, sir.

724
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:26,958
[Lynn] It happens every night.
We don't control the alarm.

725
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:31,458
Sorry, can you tell us
what happens to the lights after nine?

726
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:34,375
[Lynn] It's just the lights and the music.

727
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:37,541
It's an automatic system.
We have no control over the alarm.

728
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:39,250
I'm married, sir.

729
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:41,375
Please don't do this.

730
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:42,750
Don't do this, sir.

731
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,416
Please. Please don't do this.

732
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:48,833
Please.

733
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:52,625
[lights shut off]

734
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:59,000
[pilot 1] The alarm system will activate,
don't move in, hold your positions.

735
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,666
[pilot 2] Everyone stay on alert,
something might happen.

736
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:05,000
OC. We're keeping a safe distance.

737
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:07,041
[Lynn] Stay with me, okay?

738
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:11,583
Everything is okay.
Stay calm. Nothing is gonna happen.

739
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:25,625
[lights buzz]

740
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,583
[breathing heavily]

741
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:39,208
The lights are on.

742
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:41,958
And no alarm. You lied.

743
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:44,416
I didn't, I was telling you the truth.

744
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,500
-I don't--
-[phone disconnects]

745
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,791
Shit.

746
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:51,041
What the hell, Kees, you have me lying?
I'm trying to gain his trust.

747
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:53,041
Please hold the line. Kees!

748
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,791
[woman] Apple took care of it.
The music and lights are staying on.

749
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:01,083
They're transferring
the feed from their cameras to us.

750
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:03,291
Okay, great. And the floor plans?

751
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:06,458
There's a separate department
that holds all the floor plans. Protocol.

752
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:09,625
It could be minutes,
couple of hours, they'll get back to us.

753
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,791
-They're doing their best.
-[man] We've got the feed from the store.

754
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:23,875
[typing angrily]

755
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Can you call him back?

756
00:45:27,416 --> 00:45:29,958
I don't think he trusts you.
After that call.

757
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,000
I can gain his trust back.

758
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:35,083
[sighs]

759
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:39,250
[phone ringing out]

760
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:42,291
[ominous music playing]

761
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:50,208
[phone ringing]

762
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,916
[ringing stops]

763
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,250
-[hostage taker] Yeah?
-Hey.

764
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:58,250
You holding up all right?

765
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,708
Why wouldn't I be?

766
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,500
Well, you hung up on me.

767
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:05,416
[hostage taker] You lied.
I don't like that.

768
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:09,916
That's fair. I'd feel the same way.
I'm going off the information I get here.

769
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,708
They said that after nine,
you'd lose lights and music.

770
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:15,291
-That you'd set off the alarm.
-Hm.

771
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:17,125
I thought it'd be better
if I let you know.

772
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,833
In case you got scared.

773
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:19,833
Okay.

774
00:46:21,416 --> 00:46:23,166
Is my money ready yet?

775
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:26,833
I can confirm that we are working
really hard to get it done.

776
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:30,250
I want it in Bitcoin, okay?
You do know what a Bitcoin is, right?

777
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:31,708
Yeah, of course I know.

778
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:37,708
Hey, I, uh, I'm just realizing you…
you never told me what your name is.

779
00:46:37,791 --> 00:46:39,875
I mean, it just feels so impersonal.

780
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:48,333
Double A. From now on call me Double A.

781
00:46:48,416 --> 00:46:50,625
Okay, thank you. Double E, cool name.

782
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:54,000
No, wait. Not… No, no, no, no, no, no.
Not E. A.

783
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:56,541
Double A, are you deaf?

784
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:58,500
A as in angels. Double A.

785
00:46:58,583 --> 00:46:59,958
Did you forget English?

786
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:02,083
No, I can still speak English.

787
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:04,541
Despite being born
right here in Amsterdam.

788
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:06,416
How about you, are you from here?

789
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,625
Yeah, the way you speak.
Sounds like you're from here.

790
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:11,166
Listen, it's not about me.

791
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,458
This is about you
and what you can do for me, understood?

792
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:15,250
We'll talk about resolving this.

793
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,625
I really hope we can work together
and come to an agreement, Double A.

794
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:19,708
[Double A] Oh yeah?

795
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:23,333
Who says I want to resolve this?

796
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:29,833
Well, I assume that you want to.
You want something, right?

797
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:31,333
[Double A] What I want is simple.

798
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:35,000
200 million in Bitcoin
and a way out of here.

799
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:36,666
Then this can be over.

800
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:40,625
And what are you thinking,
Double A, for a way out of there?

801
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:42,541
What's the plan?

802
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:46,583
A fast luxury car,
and free passage to the A10.

803
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:48,041
To the A10?

804
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:51,875
Then what?

805
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:55,916
You make a promise
that after we leave nobody will follow us.

806
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:58,375
-We'll make a clean getaway.
-We?

807
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,458
Me and my friend here.

808
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:05,333
[Lynn] Your friend?

809
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:08,708
-You want him to go with you?
-Want?

810
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,416
He's coming.

811
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:14,833
Once I'm safe and you're not following me,
I'll let him go.

812
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:15,958
Listen.

813
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:19,166
You've been in there a while now.

814
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,958
You must be getting hungry or thirsty,
or maybe he is?

815
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:24,750
I gave him a drink.
It was for his medicine.

816
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:26,291
Oh, that's very nice to hear.

817
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:29,625
Thanks for looking after him.
What kind of medicine was it?

818
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:32,708
Your medicine.

819
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:36,625
-What is the name of your medicine?
-Lisonopril. For my heart.

820
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:39,958
[Lynn] Okay.

821
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:42,333
Aren't you concerned for him?

822
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:43,958
Since he's so sick?

823
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:46,250
You should be concerned for him instead.

824
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:49,250
Deliver on what I want,
and we'll all get out of here.

825
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:53,250
My friend here, he doesn't look that sick.

826
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:56,666
The pain is in his heart.
You can't see it on the outside.

827
00:48:57,666 --> 00:48:59,916
Yeah, all the more reason to get my money.

828
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:04,166
Otherwise, it'll take even longer
and if something happens to him then,

829
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,666
that's your fault then, friend.

830
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,208
[scoffs] My fault?
That's a stretch there, friend.

831
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:11,958
I'm not the one who stormed in
with weapons and took a hostage.

832
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:12,958
That was you.

833
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:15,750
Yeah, okay.
Good point, I'll give you that.

834
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:18,083
Kees?

835
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,916
EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS
ARE TRAPPED UPSTAIRS

836
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,833
[Kees] Oh, God.

837
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:26,833
IN THE CANTEEN.
STAY TUNED FOR UPDATES!

838
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:28,708
What's their location?

839
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,000
I assume it's from someone
upstairs in the Apple Store.

840
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:32,958
It's already posted
on websites and socials.

841
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:33,875
Shit.

842
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:36,125
Abe, report.

843
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:37,708
[Abe] I'm listening.

844
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,625
There's an idiot
who just posted on social media

845
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:41,708
that people are trapped upstairs.

846
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:43,583
[Abe] Shit.

847
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:46,458
Getting people out is our top priority.

848
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:48,166
If he finds out
those people are upstairs…

849
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,458
Then we'll have 40 more hostages'
lives put at risk.

850
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:51,666
Get them out of there.

851
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,916
It's risky, but let's go in now.

852
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,041
Get those posts taken down
as soon as possible.

853
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:57,250
Understood.

854
00:49:58,458 --> 00:50:00,625
Get me the network providers.

855
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,875
[whispering] What the hell's
taking so long?

856
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,500
-[Mark] Mingus?
-[Mingus] Yeah.

857
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:09,416
[Mark] Listen. We're doing our best
to get the store's floor plans,

858
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,166
but we don't have them yet.

859
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,708
We have to go in now
to get the people upstairs to safety.

860
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:15,250
Is there a quick way to get upstairs?

861
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,708
[whispering] The rear exit,
because it's also connected to next door.

862
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:21,666
You can get to the other building.

863
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,375
You can cross over to the back.

864
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:26,250
I can create a map of where it is.

865
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:28,083
[Mark] Incredible. Please do.

866
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:30,625
-Send it ASAP if you can.
-Right.

867
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:34,125
What are you doing?

868
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,375
[beep]

869
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:41,333
[dramatic music playing]

870
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:42,708
[Winston] I got it.

871
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:44,291
Hey, guys, gather around.

872
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:47,583
We're about to enter
via the south side of the Hirsch building.

873
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:52,000
We know there's an armed tango downstairs.
We don't know if he's acting alone.

874
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:54,375
There are 40 sierras upstairs.

875
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:58,166
We gotta get them out. Quietly.
This is the situation, got it?

876
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,666
Stay focused in there, okay?

877
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,041
Let's go.

878
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:05,125
[indistinct chatter]

879
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:07,125
Lynn, keep him on the line, okay?

880
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:10,500
Everyone, DSI's going in.

881
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:13,083
Ma'am, this is serious, I need you to--

882
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:15,875
Kees.

883
00:51:15,958 --> 00:51:16,958
Intake four.

884
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:25,250
The girl who posted that message
refuses to remove it, I've tried.

885
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:26,166
Who is she?

886
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,125
Some influencer who insists
I call her the "opinion maker" now.

887
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:30,208
Call her back.

888
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:32,916
[phone rings out]

889
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Yeah, Kees van Zanten. General Commander
of the Amsterdam Police.

890
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:41,416
Did you mention people
in the Apple Store in a post?

891
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:45,541
You have no idea how many innocent lives
are at risk because of you,

892
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:47,041
you stupid little shit.

893
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:48,375
My patience has run thin.

894
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:50,500
If that post isn't down
in the next ten seconds,

895
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:53,833
I will personally send an arrest team
to drag you out of your apartment

896
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:56,083
with a sack
over your goddamn stupid head!

897
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:57,416
Is that clear to you?

898
00:51:58,333 --> 00:51:59,625
Is it clear or not?!

899
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:01,708
Okay, do it then!

900
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:04,958
[phone beeps]

901
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,083
[Lynn] I'm curious.

902
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:14,250
What happened today that upset you?
And caused you to do this?

903
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:22,583
[Winston] Okay, tactical formation.

904
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:27,166
[Double A] Don't you get it?
It's not about what happened today.

905
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,625
It's been happening for a while.

906
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:34,750
The injustice you have constantly
subjected me to, that's what it's about.

907
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:36,708
[Winston] Okay.

908
00:52:37,541 --> 00:52:38,791
You know all about it.

909
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,083
It's all of you
and your infamous Bermuda triangle.

910
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:43,000
[Winston] NVGs.

911
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:45,375
[Double A] The public prosecutor,
the police, the law.

912
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:47,000
-[Winston] Get ready.
-You've abused me.

913
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:48,125
[keypad beeping]

914
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:51,625
You handcuffed me,
you threw me on the floor in a cell.

915
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:52,916
You have wronged me.

916
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:56,708
One day it has to stop.

917
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,791
Finally, that day has arrived.

918
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:03,208
That's why I've demanded
the money from you.

919
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,125
I want you to pay me off.

920
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:08,708
And I'll go away.
Since I don't matter to anyone anyway.

921
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:11,208
No one here cares.

922
00:53:14,916 --> 00:53:16,458
But I do matter, just watch me.

923
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:19,333
-Okay, friend?
-[Lynn] I'm listening.

924
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:22,583
I'm working hard to get the money.
I swear.

925
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,500
You have no choice, though.

926
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:27,291
Or are you trying to say
you care about me?

927
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,541
You'll be going home after this,
to your boyfriend, your child, whatever.

928
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:37,375
I want you to stay alive
and you do matter.

929
00:53:38,291 --> 00:53:39,958
There are people who care about you.

930
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:43,000
I'm sure of that, and they want to see you
come out of this unharmed.

931
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:44,916
I care about you.

932
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,958
About getting you out of there safely.

933
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:49,125
Double A.

934
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:52,541
It's Ammar.

935
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:54,125
[dramatic music playing]

936
00:53:57,541 --> 00:53:58,541
Okay.

937
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:01,500
Ammar.

938
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:03,500
Thank you.

939
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,916
Like I said, I'm here for you. Okay?

940
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:09,291
But also for the man in there.

941
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:10,916
That man who's with you.

942
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:14,333
He doesn't have anything to do with this,
he went to the store

943
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:16,458
looking for something to buy.

944
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:19,000
He must be terrified too, don't you think?

945
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:21,125
What's your play?

946
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:23,750
[Lynn] I'm not playing games.

947
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:27,833
I just want to know how he's doing.

948
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,166
Ammar Ajar? A-J-A-R. First name Ammar.

949
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,083
Bus driver. You said you remembered him
from the bus?

950
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:41,208
Date of birth? April 21st '95.

951
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:44,833
Ma'am, I'm connecting you to an officer,
don't hang up.

952
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:47,708
Take over. Channel five.
Harry, big screen, now.

953
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,125
Ammar Ajar.
Born in Amsterdam, roots in Syria.

954
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:56,083
A few misdemeanors.
He went back to Syria as a child.

955
00:54:56,166 --> 00:54:58,416
He suffers from psychiatric problems.

956
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,458
That's him.

957
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:01,208
You're watching, right?

958
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:03,750
Yeah.

959
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:08,041
I am. We have access
to the cameras, Ammar.

960
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:10,125
I can see you.

961
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:13,250
Then you'll see what happens
if my bitcoin isn't delivered.

962
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:18,458
[Lynn] What I've seen so far
is that you're looking after him.

963
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:20,875
That's really nice.

964
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:22,625
[dramatic music playing]

965
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,791
It's kind of you, Ammar.

966
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:28,083
You even gave him a cigarette.

967
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:30,833
It seemed to… to help him calm down.

968
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:32,916
Yeah, yeah.

969
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,083
He's only…

970
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,083
[Lynn] He's only human.

971
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:39,208
I agree with you.

972
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:43,000
[Ammar] Yeah, right.

973
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:47,833
[Lynn] Exactly, he's only human,
like you and me.

974
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:49,333
[Winston] You can open it.

975
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:54,041
Go. Police. Police, get back.

976
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:55,708
Hands on your head.

977
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:57,708
Hands on your head. Back up.

978
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:00,416
[music intensifies]

979
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,958
Bravo for Double Zero. Space is clear.

980
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:06,708
No tangos, only sierras. Standby for evac.

981
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:15,833
Move. Keep it moving. Okay, clear.

982
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,708
[Ilian coughing]

983
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:25,416
I'm done talking for now, Lynn.

984
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,291
[music fades]

985
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:42,250
[sighs]

986
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:47,333
She talks too much.
She's giving me a headache.

987
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,375
[tense music playing]

988
00:56:57,208 --> 00:56:58,458
-Mingus?
-[Mingus] Yeah?

989
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:03,125
[Mark] Those people are safe. We were able
to get everyone out of the upper floor.

990
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:05,791
You made that happen, Mingus,
so thank you.

991
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:08,333
-We're working hard to get you out, okay?
-[Mingus] Okay.

992
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:11,708
Mark, how long is this gonna take?

993
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:14,916
We're doing our very best, Mingus.
Trust me.

994
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:19,625
They're still working on it.

995
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:23,750
[sighs]

996
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:25,666
[music intensifies]

997
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:30,458
[Abe] Great work, team. Thank you.

998
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:34,541
Get the boys together. There's coffee
and we've ordered a hundred pizzas.

999
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:38,166
-How are the negotiations going?
-He's totally unpredictable.

1000
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:40,625
It's gonna take a while.

1001
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:41,833
[watch beeps]

1002
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:45,375
Don't worry, I'll buy the Keukenhof.

1003
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:49,041
Now, take a break. Pizza's coming.

1004
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:52,416
[music settles]

1005
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,583
[phone ringing]

1006
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:00,083
Is that yours?

1007
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,583
That's my wife.

1008
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:26,791
[Ammar] Wanna talk to her?

1009
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:28,875
-[phone continues to ring]
-[breathes heavily]

1010
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,875
[breathing shakily]

1011
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:37,416
[ringing stops]

1012
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:42,416
[somber music playing]

1013
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:55,125
[all breathing heavily]

1014
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:17,708
[footsteps approach]

1015
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:27,416
You're not Bruce Lee.

1016
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,833
[breathing heavily]

1017
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:55,041
It's so hot.

1018
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:16,875
You know,
my wife wants me to buy an apartment.

1019
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:19,583
Which we can never afford, so…

1020
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:22,583
I'm here to work.

1021
01:00:23,791 --> 01:00:25,416
A couple of months. [sniffs]

1022
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,125
I earn some money.

1023
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,166
It's not enough, but…

1024
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,541
but I love her.

1025
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:34,458
[sniffs]

1026
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:36,541
And if she wants that apartment…

1027
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:41,000
I will do my best, you know, for…

1028
01:00:41,666 --> 01:00:43,666
for her, for us.

1029
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:48,958
She's so worried right now.

1030
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,458
Don't you have someone
who's worried about you?

1031
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:00,166
I'm not worth worrying about.

1032
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:04,333
It's my own fault.

1033
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,500
I could also get a gun.

1034
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,208
Go in a store and take someone hostage.

1035
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:18,666
But it will always be
the wrong hostage. Always.

1036
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:23,916
Someone who doesn't deserve
to be so scared, or killed.

1037
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,166
I didn't deserve
to be treated the way I was.

1038
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,041
I understand that. I know the feeling.

1039
01:01:31,291 --> 01:01:33,041
They treat you like shit.

1040
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:34,125
The government.

1041
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:36,583
You pay everything they want you to pay.

1042
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:40,041
But still they come after you
with all these extra taxes.

1043
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:41,958
And you end up having nothing.

1044
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:43,208
I know that.

1045
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:46,333
Here…

1046
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,791
Here, I'm nothing.

1047
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:53,458
But somewhere, with that money, I am…

1048
01:01:54,666 --> 01:01:56,208
I will be like a king.

1049
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:59,708
I will help people
who are in the same situation as me.

1050
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:02,708
I will be like, like a Robin Hood king.

1051
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:04,875
You know Robin Hood, right?

1052
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:08,000
I'll see if that money makes me happy.

1053
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,791
I'm honestly afraid
that you'll never make it.

1054
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:22,666
They might shoot you.

1055
01:02:24,291 --> 01:02:26,625
This is probably
the worst place you could have picked.

1056
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:30,291
I'm not afraid.

1057
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:32,666
I have you.

1058
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,500
You have me, yeah.

1059
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:39,791
But let's say
they won't give you the money.

1060
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:43,666
You'll kill me, and then what?

1061
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:46,083
Then they win.

1062
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:48,666
And they will lose.

1063
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:14,458
Do you want coffee?

1064
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:16,833
Sure.

1065
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:30,083
Mingus?

1066
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:34,375
He's slowly coming towards you.
Make sure everyone remains silent.

1067
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:36,750
-[groaning]
-Shh! Mom, stay still.

1068
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:38,541
[Mingus breathing heavily]

1069
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:40,708
[breathing heavily]

1070
01:03:45,916 --> 01:03:49,958
He's coming.
Hit him with this if he comes in. Okay?

1071
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:52,000
Where does it hurt?

1072
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,875
My heart.

1073
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:02,875
[coffee machine whirs]

1074
01:04:09,583 --> 01:04:10,583
[fire extinguisher clunks]

1075
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:18,250
-[Soof groans]
-Mommy. Mom.

1076
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:21,458
-Mark.
-[Mark] Yeah.

1077
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:23,125
Soof isn't doing well.

1078
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:24,333
What's wrong?

1079
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:26,708
She's fading fast.

1080
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:27,833
[Soof groans]

1081
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:30,041
Her hand's over her breast.

1082
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:32,666
My girl…

1083
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:37,291
Kees, Abe, a woman in the closet
may be having a heart attack.

1084
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,666
This could be a serious problem.

1085
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:40,625
Lynn?

1086
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:43,791
-Call him and keep him talking.
-Yeah.

1087
01:04:44,666 --> 01:04:47,583
Officer. We need
to get a doctor over here. Right now.

1088
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:49,000
-[officer] Yes. Understood.
-Okay.

1089
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:52,083
[indistinct radio chatter]

1090
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:53,416
They need you there.

1091
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,500
[phone ringing]

1092
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,125
Hi, Lynn. We're on a coffee break.

1093
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:03,166
Ah, that's good to hear.

1094
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:05,083
How you holding up?

1095
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:11,083
-[Mingus] Mark?
-I'm listening.

1096
01:05:11,166 --> 01:05:12,791
I've spoken with Kees.

1097
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,208
If it's a serious heart attack,

1098
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:16,000
we're going in immediately.

1099
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:19,083
But only if it's life-threatening,
because my men would be at serious risk.

1100
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,458
Understood, got it.

1101
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:24,458
-Hi.
-Hey.

1102
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:27,250
-Help give us a diagnosis here.
-Okay.

1103
01:05:28,416 --> 01:05:31,083
[Mark] Mingus,
I have a doctor here with me.

1104
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:33,541
[doctor] Is she unconscious or awake?

1105
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:34,833
[whispering] She's still awake.

1106
01:05:35,416 --> 01:05:37,125
[doctor] Is it radiating pain?

1107
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:39,500
-Is it radiating pain?
-Nah-ah.

1108
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,958
Shh.

1109
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,208
No, it isn't.

1110
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:45,041
He's becoming a problem, you know?

1111
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:48,000
He really wants to get back to his wife.
He's scared.

1112
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:49,666
He's worrying more and more.

1113
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,625
Yeah, I can imagine.

1114
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:54,750
[Ammar] Yeah, well you
should be worried too.

1115
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:56,541
Sooner or later
you'll have to call his wife

1116
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,333
to tell her her husband's not coming home.

1117
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:00,083
Let's not go there just yet.

1118
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,375
We're still talking this through.

1119
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,208
[doctor] Is she sweating?
Are her lips blue?

1120
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:10,375
[Mingus] She's sweating, yeah,
but her lips aren't blue.

1121
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:12,333
[doctor] Can you feel her heartbeat?

1122
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:16,958
The Apple Watch is equipped
with a heart monitor. I can measure it.

1123
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:17,958
[doctor] Go ahead.

1124
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:20,625
What exactly are we talking through, Lynn?

1125
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:23,333
Oh, well. All the bitcoin you want?

1126
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:25,125
It's not just any amount.

1127
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:28,375
-What were you hoping to do?
-[laughs wryly]

1128
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:32,000
-Do you want a cut or something?
-[Lynn laughs] No.

1129
01:06:32,791 --> 01:06:35,416
Thanks. I'm just curious.

1130
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,916
[elevator lands and dings]

1131
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:47,875
[Ammar] There's no way out of my problems.

1132
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,500
I won't turn back.

1133
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:53,041
-I can't keep suffering.
-We have support.

1134
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:58,458
Have you thought of talking
to a professional about it?

1135
01:06:58,541 --> 01:07:01,291
There are specialists
that can really help.

1136
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:04,375
The time for talking is over. Yeah.

1137
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:07,958
I've had enough shit social workers
pretend to care about me, all right?

1138
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:10,541
Just nodding along and smiling.

1139
01:07:11,291 --> 01:07:13,875
They just push you
further and further into a corner.

1140
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:16,000
I leave more depressed
than when I got there.

1141
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:19,958
[Mingus] Okay.

1142
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:21,916
[breathing heavily]

1143
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:22,875
Thanks.

1144
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:25,291
READING.…

1145
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:29,750
Hey, Ammar. I had an idea.

1146
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:36,250
Let's say that you walk outside,
nice and slow, and calm.

1147
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:38,291
Imagine that happened.

1148
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:41,000
The worst was over, you're relieved.

1149
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:43,666
No fear of what could happen.

1150
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,833
You want me to give up and surrender?

1151
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:48,708
You want me to come outside?

1152
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:00,291
-That's never going to happen.
-Tell me why.

1153
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:05,291
Because I always finish what I've started.

1154
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:07,875
I'm past the point of no return.

1155
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:09,375
[doctor] Is the heart rate regular?

1156
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:10,916
READING…
HEART RATE 117 BPM

1157
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,083
Yeah, a normal heart rate.

1158
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:15,375
[doctor] Okay, Mingus. Thank you.

1159
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:18,166
She's suffering from anxiety,
a panic attack.

1160
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,041
Nothing to worry about.

1161
01:08:20,125 --> 01:08:22,333
-It's not your heart, okay?
-[Soof groans]

1162
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,375
-Sorry.
-[Mingus] Don't be.

1163
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:26,083
Don't worry, it's okay.

1164
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:29,000
Abe, the doctor just talked to them
over the phone,

1165
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:31,333
and it's not a heart attack.

1166
01:08:31,916 --> 01:08:34,208
I repeat: it's not a heart attack.

1167
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:35,875
Okay, stand down, men.

1168
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:46,000
Fuck you, you lying bitch!

1169
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:47,750
[tense music playing]

1170
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,750
What was that?

1171
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:50,875
Fuck.

1172
01:08:50,958 --> 01:08:51,958
My bad, Double Zero.

1173
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,166
I need all lasers off.

1174
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:55,291
Did you want me to get shot?

1175
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:58,083
-Stand up. Now I know what you're up to.
-Ammar?

1176
01:08:58,583 --> 01:09:01,333
Do you think I'm stupid or something?
I saw a green dot on my body.

1177
01:09:01,416 --> 01:09:03,083
Hey. What's going on, what's wrong?

1178
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:04,750
[Ammar grunting]

1179
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:07,916
[Ammar] Lynn, I swear.

1180
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,958
I'll empty this whole clip into him.

1181
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:12,041
Listen carefully now, Ammar.

1182
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:14,541
You're in the store,
and you're the one who set all of this up.

1183
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:16,875
Weapons, explosives, a hostage.

1184
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:18,125
You had to know the response.

1185
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:21,458
Did you think there'd be
a neighborhood cop standing on the corner

1186
01:09:21,541 --> 01:09:22,500
stopping traffic?

1187
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:23,708
Come on, man!

1188
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:26,416
There are all kinds of things outside.
Yes, they have lasers.

1189
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,916
But nothing is going to happen
as long as we're still talking.

1190
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,458
I promise. Okay?

1191
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:33,416
Fuck you, Lynn. Fuck you.

1192
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,583
Go get me a man to negotiate with.
This is business.

1193
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:40,083
The next call I get better be from a man.

1194
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,291
[call disconnects]

1195
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:45,666
[Lynn breathing heavily]

1196
01:09:48,666 --> 01:09:50,666
[indistinct radio chatter]

1197
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:53,750
[man] Back together again.

1198
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:56,083
[phone chimes]

1199
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:59,666
HONEY
WE'RE THINKING OF YOU.

1200
01:10:01,291 --> 01:10:02,875
[Winston sighs deeply]

1201
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:08,583
-Does she know what you're doing?
-Of course she does.

1202
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:10,958
It's all over the news. She's not stupid.

1203
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:14,791
If only our friend in there
could have waited two nights.… [laughs]

1204
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:18,666
-I wouldn't have to be here.
-Nah, something else would've come up.

1205
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:21,541
It's not letting up any time soon.

1206
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:25,333
It seems like the world's getting crazier.

1207
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:27,625
They don't tell you that at the interview.

1208
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:31,208
The fighting never ends.

1209
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:33,666
It's not just the bad guys,
but your family too.

1210
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:37,625
Yeah, unfortunately for me,
I lost that battle a long time ago.

1211
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:39,083
[Winston chuckles]

1212
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:40,500
So dramatic.

1213
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,333
[man chuckles]

1214
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:43,916
[Winston] How'd that pan out?

1215
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,208
The first month was great. [chuckles]

1216
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:49,958
Going out every night. Parties, girls.

1217
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:51,708
[laughs] Yeah?

1218
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:53,000
It doesn't take long

1219
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,125
to realize what you're missing out on.

1220
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,666
Someone who's always there.

1221
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:05,083
Someone to share your days with.

1222
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:13,250
Ah. Enough of that.

1223
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:15,500
Look where we are.

1224
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:18,041
It doesn't get any better than this.

1225
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:19,666
My advice though…

1226
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:24,333
don't take it for granted.

1227
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:34,166
Nice. Pizza. Just what we needed.

1228
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:35,291
[Winston] Thanks, man.

1229
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:39,625
-Here.
-Thanks.

1230
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:45,875
-[Wilco] Well, I think we have to.
-[Rachelle] Yeah, I agree.

1231
01:11:46,666 --> 01:11:48,666
-Sounds good.
-All right.

1232
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:50,750
[Lynn scribbling]

1233
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:05,916
-Lynn…
-I've got him, Wilco.

1234
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,166
I've got him.

1235
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,125
And he, he knows it too.

1236
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:13,583
And that's precisely why
he won't talk to you anymore.

1237
01:12:13,666 --> 01:12:14,750
Give me an hour.

1238
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:19,250
-And he will walk out of that store.
-Sorry, it's way too risky.

1239
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:22,750
He's not going to shoot
if I'm on the phone.

1240
01:12:22,833 --> 01:12:25,208
-He calls me "friend."
-[Wilco] Lynn, he wants a man.

1241
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:28,458
[Lynn sighs]

1242
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:30,166
What do you think?

1243
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:33,125
I think you definitely
have a chance with him.

1244
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:35,958
You did well with the hostage.

1245
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:38,125
You really dug deep.

1246
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:40,458
But he's crazy and not crazy.

1247
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:42,541
This guy's completely unpredictable.

1248
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:45,333
-And therefore, he's dangerous.
-Yeah.

1249
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:49,291
That's very clear.
He has a history of illness.

1250
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:52,208
He belongs in the mental health system,
and right now he's our problem.

1251
01:12:52,791 --> 01:12:56,333
He needs help, now.
And that's part of our job as negotiators.

1252
01:12:58,458 --> 01:12:59,291
Give me an hour.

1253
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:03,416
[sighs softly]

1254
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:05,708
Then half an hour.

1255
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:09,125
Lynn, we can't risk that he'll spiral.

1256
01:13:09,791 --> 01:13:11,083
You know the deal.

1257
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:13,333
You can read between the lines.

1258
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:15,166
-What's he really planning?
-[door opens]

1259
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:17,875
That he won't survive.

1260
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:19,958
[tense music playing]

1261
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,958
[music continues]

1262
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:30,500
[phone ringing]

1263
01:13:37,666 --> 01:13:38,500
[Ammar] Yeah?

1264
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,375
Ammar, my name's Wilco.
I'm from the police.

1265
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:45,250
I work with Lynn,
who you were speaking to.

1266
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:47,958
You requested a male negotiator.

1267
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:51,125
I'm speaking to a man? Are you sure?

1268
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:52,666
Yes. I'm a man.

1269
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,791
A man delivers, right?

1270
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:59,083
-So? When can I get what I asked for?
-[Wilco] We're doing our best.

1271
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:02,166
But you know that kind of money
isn't so readily available.

1272
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:04,833
We need to see
where we can get 200 million.

1273
01:14:04,916 --> 01:14:07,458
Our financial experts are handling it.

1274
01:14:07,541 --> 01:14:09,916
That's not a real answer,
so you're not a real man.

1275
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:12,291
Yeah.

1276
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:15,333
If you can't do it,
all you have to do is tell me.

1277
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:17,250
Then you'll face the consequences.

1278
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:20,333
As a man.

1279
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:23,916
You see this, right?

1280
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:28,000
Are you taking me seriously?

1281
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,291
Find out what his motivation is.
Show you think he's serious.

1282
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:36,541
[Wilco] I'm taking you serious, as a man.
What do you want from all this, Ammar?

1283
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:39,583
Listen, if today's the day I die,
then I'll die fighting.

1284
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:41,916
Is that what he's after?

1285
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:44,833
Is that what you want? To die today?

1286
01:14:46,166 --> 01:14:47,208
Because, um… [chuckles]

1287
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:50,041
I'll stop trying
to get this money together then.

1288
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:51,333
It would save a lot of time.

1289
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:53,291
[Ammar] You're right,
it'll save a lot of time,

1290
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:56,791
because instead of getting it done,
you're stalling. Let them shoot me then.

1291
01:14:57,291 --> 01:14:59,375
I won't feel any pain anyway.

1292
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:03,916
You see this?

1293
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,416
If I set it off, then all
your little snipers outside will blow up.

1294
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,208
You don't care about me,
Lynn doesn't care about me,

1295
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:11,916
nobody cares about me.

1296
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,375
Fuck it.

1297
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:14,958
Start the countdown.

1298
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:17,416
Ten, nine, eight…

1299
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,916
Take him to the here and now.
Okay, get him back.

1300
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,416
Ask what kind of car he wants.

1301
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:22,791
…five…

1302
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:25,250
[Wilco] Ammar, we're working hard
for you, like I said.

1303
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:27,583
As far as your getaway car.
What type of car do you want?

1304
01:15:27,666 --> 01:15:28,708
…one.

1305
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:35,291
I want a limousine.

1306
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:42,125
L-limousine?
You want a… limousine as a getaway car?

1307
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:44,875
You heard me. I want a black Hummer Limo.

1308
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:46,416
You guys started this game.

1309
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,083
I'm playing along now,
get what I ask for, asshole.

1310
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:50,458
Why not fuchsia?

1311
01:15:52,666 --> 01:15:53,583
No.

1312
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:55,958
That's a color I considered.

1313
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:58,458
But black is better.

1314
01:15:59,041 --> 01:16:02,041
Okay, Ammar. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1315
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:09,500
A limousine? He's being serious.

1316
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,291
Stay on the line.

1317
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:21,875
A limousine?

1318
01:16:22,958 --> 01:16:24,750
If we go, we go in style.

1319
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,750
[breathing shakily]

1320
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:33,291
Ask for some water, please.

1321
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:39,458
Ask for some water.

1322
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:41,166
I have Red Bull.

1323
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:44,208
No, that's not good for my heart, man.

1324
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:47,458
They have to do what you want.

1325
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:49,875
You're in charge.

1326
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:53,083
Ask for some water.

1327
01:16:55,916 --> 01:17:00,000
Instead of water,
he wants a shitty black limousine.

1328
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,708
You idiotic fuck!

1329
01:17:01,791 --> 01:17:03,250
You idiot, that's enough!

1330
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:07,791
Ask for some fucking water.

1331
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,583
Or just shoot me.

1332
01:17:16,916 --> 01:17:20,291
I need water for him now.
A few bottles of water.

1333
01:17:20,375 --> 01:17:22,041
[Wilco] Okay, Ammar. Okay.

1334
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:25,291
Thank you.

1335
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:28,666
I just know they have to listen to you.

1336
01:17:29,791 --> 01:17:33,333
Watch your mouth, or you'll get
a fucking bullet through your head, okay?

1337
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,458
[tense music playing]

1338
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:48,125
[indistinct radio chatter]

1339
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:12,708
[music stops]

1340
01:18:12,791 --> 01:18:14,083
[Lynn] Has it been delivered?

1341
01:18:15,333 --> 01:18:17,333
[tense music playing]

1342
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:24,708
[phone dials out]

1343
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:30,708
-[Ammar] Yeah?
-Ammar?

1344
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,708
The water's ready for you.

1345
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:38,875
As requested.

1346
01:18:42,166 --> 01:18:43,375
Several bottles.

1347
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:47,083
The robot is backing up now.

1348
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:50,833
We will stay away.

1349
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,208
Ammar, are you still there?

1350
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:03,625
We're coming to get the water.

1351
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:06,083
Don't try anything, or the place goes up.

1352
01:19:06,166 --> 01:19:07,708
[Wilco] I know nothing's gonna happen.

1353
01:19:07,791 --> 01:19:10,875
Remember, if you keep talking to me,
you'll be fine. Promise.

1354
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:21,833
[Ammar] Turn around.

1355
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:23,833
Get up.

1356
01:19:24,333 --> 01:19:25,166
Turn around.

1357
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:27,250
[music intensifies]

1358
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:34,125
Stand up.

1359
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:42,458
Go. Go.

1360
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,333
Stop.

1361
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:12,833
[helicopter whirring]

1362
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:26,500
[pilot 1] OC, we've got eyes
on the front door.

1363
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:30,625
We're going to back off a little more.
The snipers have him in their sight.

1364
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:33,125
Yes, we see two men at the door. Stand by.

1365
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:34,250
[Mark] Mingus?

1366
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,083
The moment I say "get down,"
immediately drop

1367
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,666
and get your face down on the floor, okay?

1368
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:43,541
[Mingus] What… What's going on?

1369
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:46,791
Mingus, just know you'll be fine, okay.
Trust me and do what I say.

1370
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,416
If I shout "get down,"
you all need to lie down immediately.

1371
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,791
Once it's safe, we will come and get you.

1372
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:54,125
Officers from the DSI
will give you a code word.

1373
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:58,000
Once you hear that, and only then,
you can open the door. Do you understand?

1374
01:20:58,083 --> 01:20:59,500
What's the code word?

1375
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:01,500
iHostage.

1376
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:03,125
[scoffs]

1377
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:08,958
Nothing crazy, okay, Wilco?

1378
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:10,500
[Wilco] We won't do anything.

1379
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:12,500
Take the water, Ammar.

1380
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:14,333
No one's going to hurt you.

1381
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:20,708
We'll stay back. You can just grab it.

1382
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:24,125
-Go get it.
