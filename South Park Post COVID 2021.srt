NARRATOR:
From the green hills of Vermont

8
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:24,892
to the verdant canyons
of Arizona,

9
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,961
people all over the country
are beginning to realize

10
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,863
it's nearly over!

11
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:34,034
We have almost beaten COVID
and the best news of all:

12
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,939
Infections are
at an all-time low.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,675
New, stronger vaccinations
have ebbed the tide.

14
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,911
And we humans
are cleaning up the mess

15
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,347
and finally
getting on with our lives.

16
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:49,650
But as we start to get back
to our jobs and schools,

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,452
one question remains:

18
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,256
What lingering effects will
the pandemic have on children?

19
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:58,959
Some say no effect at all.
The children are just fine.

20
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,628
-(chiming)
-We came together

21
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,130
and finally we can say,
we are starting to

22
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,198
-win the war against COVID.
-WOMAN: Stan?

23
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,200
Stan, the phone's for you!

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,835
Stan!

25
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,304
What?!

26
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,340
Could you not hear me?

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,642
Yeah, dude,
but I'm busy working.

28
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,477
Working on getting drunk again.

29
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,011
I'm not "getting drunk,"

30
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:20,080
I'm an online
whiskey consultant.

31
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:21,415
I'm doing research.

32
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,451
Everyone needs
to leave me alone.

33
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,486
The guy on the phone
said it's important.

34
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,722
He said his name
is Kyle Broflovski.

35
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:31,091
Kyle?

36
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,696
-Hello?
-KYLE: Oh, hi.

37
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:39,367
Is this Stan Marsh,
from South Park?

38
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:42,035
-Kyle?
-Oh, dude, it is you!

39
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:44,205
How have you--
How have you been?

40
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:46,807
I'm... fine. How are you?

41
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,242
I'm good, I'm...

42
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,678
I know this is weird.
We haven't talked since...

43
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,713
well, you know,
since it all happened.

44
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:56,417
Yeah, well, the pandemic
is about over now.

45
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:57,918
I'm moving on with my life.

46
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:00,421
Stan...
you should come back here.

47
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,556
There's a lot going on.

48
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,193
There's nothing in
South Park for me, Kyle!

49
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:07,195
I'm not going back there, ever.

50
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,630
Look, dude, you remember
when we were little?

51
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,699
When the pandemic...
first started.

52
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,434
Us friends said
we'd always be there

53
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,802
for each other
when things got bad.

54
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,238
What do you mean?
What's happened?

55
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,606
Stan...

56
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:21,775
It's Kenny. He's dead.

72
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,124
I mean, they have fabulous food,

73
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,926
their country
has amazing beaches,

74
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,230
and they're
really fantastic people.

Wow, what a great audience.

77
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:21,935
You know,
today I was on the subway

78
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,238
and I saw an ad
for the Center for People

79

But Were Born Bi.

Have you heard about this?

82
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,079
I'll tell you one thing--

83
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,647
those people are brave
and deserve

84
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,417
-every ounce of our respect.
-(cheering)

85
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,851

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,692
Jimmy, we got
a call from corporate.

90
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,159
They want you to cut
the hummus joke.

91
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,395
What?!

92
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:49,129
It's hard enough
doing comedy these days.

93
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,898
Now I'm getting notes
during commercial breaks?!

94
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,000
You're just gonna have to joke
about something else.

95
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,035
All right, fine, what else
is going on in the news? Quick!

96
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:58,339
Uh, Amazon thinks they might
have discovered gold on Mars.

97
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,073
Ah, Jesus. Anything else?

98
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,376
Uh, that famous
eccentric scientist died.

99
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:05,513
The millionaire philanthropist?
Dr. McCormick?

100
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,650
Kenny? Kenny's dead?

101
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,352
Oh, I'm sorry,
did you know him?

102
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,721

were kids. Let me see that!

the death of beloved scientist

106
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,396
and humanitarian,
Dr. Kenny McCormick.

107
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,299
McCormick was a pioneer of
science and technology

108
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,402
who was always trying to unlock
the key to a better future.

109
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:31,772
He worked tirelessly--
some say balls-out crazily--

110
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,574
on new inventions and theories

111
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,710
but somehow his biggest
questions seemed to elude him.

112
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,879
The head of NASA said,
"We have lost

113
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,714
"an innovator and a visionary.

114
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,016
"Kenny was so brilliant
that most of the time,

115
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,786
we couldn't even understand
what he was saying."

116

Get me a first-class ticket
to South Park!

117
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,625
What? You can't leave!
You have to get back onstage!

118
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,293
The first lady is here!

119
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:55,095
Tell Tom Kardashian to suck my

120
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,231
P-P-Popsicles
that are in the green room,

121
00:04:58,332 --> 00:04:59,500
and that I am very sorry,

122
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,301
and that he is
a fantastic person.

Stan, wake up,
I think we're here.

126
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,030
So that's it, huh?

127
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,066
-That's the town you grew up in?
-STAN: Yeah.

128
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,770
Well, how does it feel to
be back after all these years?

129
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,207
It feels shitty, okay?
Can you please shut the fuck up?

130
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,743
Why did you even bring me
along if you're not going

131
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,344
to let me help you
through this?!

132
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:45,746

Wow. This is crazy, huh?

I mean, how long has it been?

163
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,785
I guess...
since we were nine.

Well, have a seat.

Oh, dude,
just all kinds of stuff.

167

You know, getting stuff going.

168

Got my own online
whiskey consultant gig.

169
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,230
I'm totally happy.
What about you?

170
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,098
Oh, I'm getting things
going, too.

171
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,435
I'm doing a sort of counseling
online start-up thing.

-Listen, Stan...

I know that we disagreed
a lot during the pandemic,

175

but I hope we can
put that aside...

176

I'm just here for Kenny.

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,484
there's something you should
know about the way Kenny died.

179
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,087
Hi, guys, welcome to
Denny's Applebee's Max.

180
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,922
I see you
got your menus already.

181
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,190
As you're deciding
what to order,

182
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,525
I just want to go over
a couple things.

183
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,960
Now, of course, it is the future

184
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,928
so we don't have any meat
on the menu.

185
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,630
'Cause you know,
here in the future,

186
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,866
we've all decided meat is wrong.

187
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,200
Yeah, we know.

188
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,035
Okay, and, uh,
you'll see there's

189
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,237
some dishes made
from insect protein on the menu.

190
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,439
That, of course, is because
here in the future,

191
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,341
we've all learned that insects
are a valuable and sustainable

192
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,645
food and we no longer
fear it as a food. Mm-hmm.

193
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,280
We know, dude.

194
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,515
Okay, well, if you have any
questions, please don't hesitate

195
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:38,351
to say anything, because,
you know, it's the future.

196
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,521
We've learned to all just
get along and love each other.

197
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,225
Look, Stan,
Kenny was trying to find

198
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,460
the answers
to some pretty heavy stuff.

199
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:50,130
He felt like there
were people responsible

200
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,732
for everything that's happened.

201
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,433
Like who?

202
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,070
That's just it. Nobody knows.
But whoever these people are,

203
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,707
they didn't want
Kenny McCormick exposing them.

204
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,875
Wait a minute. Token?

205
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,543
Yeah, it's me.

206
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,979
Just before he died,
Kenny was texting me

207
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,815
that he was on
to something huge.

208
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,416
And he was texting me, too.

209
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,018
Saying he'd discovered
something that

210
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,319
could change the world.

211
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,654
And then he died,

212
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,255
and the hospital won't say how.

213
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,090
And that got us thinking...

214
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,427
Oh, my God.
They killed Kenny.

215
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,164
I'm just here for the funeral.

216
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,867
I don't want to be a part
of anything else.

217
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,201
Dude, there might be
people to blame

218
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,303
for ruining our childhoods.

219
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,105
So what do you wanna do, Kyle?

220
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,108
Go on some bullshit adventure
like when we were kids?

221
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,444
Maybe, maybe we can call
Jesus and Santa

222
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:40,547
and ask them for help.
Is that what you want?

223
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:44,184
It's the fucking future,
you guys. Grow up.

224
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:53,360
Hello, welcome to
the Super 12 Motel Plus.

225
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,729
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, Stan Marsh.

226
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,530
I have a room for one night.

227
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:02,169
Okay, I see you're in one of
our Mach Ten Super Plus rooms.

228
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,571
Now, of course,
we only take Bitcoin

229
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:06,106
and other cryptocurrency 'cause,

230
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,607
you know, it's the future.

231
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,609
We've all decided
centralized banking is rigged,

232
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,479
so we trust more in
fly-by-night Ponzi schemes.

233
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,081
Yeah, I know.

234
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,319
So you walked out on
all your friends and then

235
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,188
just hung out at a bar all day?

236
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,825
Alexa, fucking just go
throw yourself out a window.

237
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,160
I'm sorry.
I didn't quite get that.

238
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,463
Nothing.
Alexa, turn on the TV.

239
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,867
Oh, God, you are
such a piece of shit.

240
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,268
-(TV chimes)
-You know,

241
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,104
if you had
Remote Prime membership,

242
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,106
you could watch Amazon movies
wherever you go.

243
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,674
Would you like to get started?

244
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,409
-No.
-I'm sorry.

245
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,644
I'm trying
to be fucking helpful.

246
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,147
Why don't you grow up
and start acting like an adult

247
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,615
for once in your life...

248
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:49,817
Alexa, stop!

249
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,051
Fuck you!

250
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,754
(news theme volume increases)

251
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:57,624
Jon, I'm standing outside
the South Park Flash Rail Max,

252
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,492
where hundreds of people
are coming to

253
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,495
pay their respects
to Dr. Kenny McCormick.

254
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,098
There's still no word
from the hospital

255
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,300
on what exactly
killed Kenny McCormick,

256
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,669
but letters sent to multiple
news outlets reveal

257
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,439
that he might have
known his life was in danger.

258
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,643
Dr. McCormick said,
"I am about to expose the truth.

259
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:19,112
"In the event of my death
I have hidden away

260
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,714
"all relevant information.

261
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,717
My closest friends
will know where to find it."

262
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,385
Dr. Kenneth McCormick.

263
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,255
He wanted to make the future
a better place.

264
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:32,259
Too bad he died, 'cause
the future certainly sucks.

265
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,528
* *

266
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,037
(doorbell rings)

267
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,373
* Someone's at the door *

268
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,375
* This is the doorbell *

269
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,879
* It's the future
so doorbells sing. *

270
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:54,047
Yeah, I know.

271
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,784
Okay, so you were right.

272
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,318
Kenny was on to some bad people

273
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,387
and he hid something
for us to find.

274
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,222
Yeah, I saw.
Only problem is

275
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,656
I don't know
what he's talking about.

276
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,625
But thank you
for saying I was right.

277
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,560
You're welcome. It doesn't mean
that you were right

278
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,929
about everything
during the pandemic.

279
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:09,930
Because you weren't.

280
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,498
Okay, well, obviously

281
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,433
we're never going to agree
on certain things,

282
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,068
so we shouldn't talk about them.

283
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,805
Sounds good.
So let's go to Kenny's wake

284
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,339
and see if anyone else shows up

285
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,108
who might know what
Kenny's talking about.

286
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,043
Let's do that.

287
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,615
(busy chatter)

288
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,486
Hello. Testing.
Hey, everybody.

289
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,056
It's amazing to see you all
here for Kenny's wake.

290
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,725
Wow, what a great audience.

291
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:40,327
Uh, for those of you
who don't know,

292
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,829
my name is Jimmy Valmer and, uh,

293
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,764
I had to take an Asian airline
to get here today.

294
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,566
You know what they say
about Asian airlines--

295
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,235
they're dependable
and just as efficient

296
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,103
as any other competent airline.

297
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,672
(whooping and cheering)

298
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,541
What a terrific audience.

299
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,643
So many people
have come for Kenny today--

300
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,779
so many amazing friends
I haven't seen in ages.

301
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,682
You know, I had a friend once
who was a Polish hair stylist.

302
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,685
Talk about an amazing haircut
at an affordable price.

303
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,288
(whooping and cheering)

304
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,823
Well, I know that
we're all ready

305
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,791
to talk to each other
and share our memories of Kenny.

306
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,660
So please just have fun
and we'll see you

307
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,063
-at the funeral tomorrow.
-(applause)

308
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,999
(electronic drumbeat playing)

309
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,334
* We are all, you and me *

310
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,504
* We are all living
in the future *

311
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,673
* We are all in the future... *

312
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,141
-(groans)
-Stan?

313
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,277
-Stan Marsh?
-Yeah?

314
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:32,679
Hi. It's Wendy.

315
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,982
Wendy Testaburger, wow.

316
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:37,050
Yeah. My husband, Darwin.

317
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,718
Hey, pal, how are ya?

318
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,921
Hey, guys.
It's Tweek and Craig.

319
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,689
Oh, hey.
How are you guys?

320
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,924
We're good.

321
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,392
(straining):
I have a lot of anxiety

322
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,726
being back
with all these people!

323
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,595
Wendy's told me a lot
about you, Stan.

324
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,864
How's everything
with the family?

325
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:54,401
Excuse me, I'm gonna go
get, uh, drunk.

326
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,736
-What's wrong with Stan?
-We're just...

327
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,505
trying to find out
what happened to Kenny.

328
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:01,574
I think this goes deeper
than you guys realize.

329
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,979
Hey, Stan Marsh!
Good to see you.

330
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,081
It's me, Clyde Donovan.

331
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,449
Oh, hey, Clyde.

332
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,784
What have you been doing
during the pandemic?

333
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,386
Oh, you know, lots of stuff.

334
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,423
Yeah, me, too.
Sucks about Kenny, huh?

335
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,590
Hope they find
all the information

336
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,559
-on that thing he hid.
-You know

337
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,128
where he might have hid it?

338
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:24,697
No, I don't.
But I bet someone here does.

339
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,900
It's really great
to see you guys again.

340
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,502
These past few decades
have been really tough.

341
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,772
Yeah, sometimes I think
the pandemic really aged me.

342
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,475
Kyle, can I talk to you
for a second?

343
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:39,246
-Dude, he's here.
-Who's here?

344
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,216
-Cartman?
-Yeah, but he's changed.

345
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,584
Changed how?

346
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,453
Yes, I know,
it's been a long time

347
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,754
since we've seen each other.

348
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,122
I'm doing really well.

349
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,091
I'm actually the head
of Gespetzah Synagogue

350
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,392
down in Colorado Springs.

351
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,461
Can you believe it?
I'm a rabbi.

352
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,998
Yeah, you know, when
the whole pandemic happened,

353
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,299
I think it changed me.

354
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,334
It really changed me
for the better.

355
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,769
-It did?
-No.

356
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:05,472
-He's fucking with me.
-What? Oh, yeah.

357
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,175
Yeah, I get it,
the Eric Cartman you guys knew

358
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,043
didn't seem like
he'd become a rabbi.

359
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,179
But I found real meaning
in the Torah

360
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,281
and then I found a great
Jewish woman and...

361
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:17,284
let the spirit of the Talmud
guide our lives.

362
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:18,952
Okay, jut knock it off, fat-ass.

363
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,220
Dude.

364
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,821
Wow, that's very big
of you, Kyle.

365
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,824
Still living in South Park
and calling people fat-ass, huh?

366
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,127
Wait, I'm sorry,
that was uncalled for.

367
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,795
It's not fucking funny, Cartman!

368
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,398
Stop pretending you
have a happy Jewish life!

369
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,033
Hey, shoogina!
I'm sorry, I couldn't

370
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,902
wait in the car anymore;
I had to meet your friends.

371
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:38,972
Oh, that's okay.
Guys, this is my wife, Yentl.

372
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,674
I've heard so many stories
about you all.

373
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,543
It must have been amazing
to grow up

374
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,412
in these beautiful mountains!

375
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,981
Yentl? Her name is Yentl?

376
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:51,384
Can we fucking stop this
and talk about Kenny, please?!

377
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:55,422
-Oh, is that, uh...?
-Yeah, that's-that's Kyle, yeah.

378
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,490
I'm sorry, honey, can you
just give me a couple minutes?

379
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,392
I just need a few more
seconds with them

380
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,527
and I'll be right out
to the car.

381
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,029
Oh, okay, I get it.

382
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,396
Nice to meet you guys.

383
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,365
We'll see you at the funeral,
I guess.

384
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,400
And I'm very sorry
for your loss.

385
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,103
Bye, Mrs. Cartman.

386
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:14,041
Okay, look, guys, Kenny and I
were still really good friends.

387
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:17,144
He used to email me all the time
about stuff he was doing.

388
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:18,411
Yeah, me, too!

389
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,180
Well, so then maybe he also

390
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,149
told you that
he was trying to find

391
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:23,950
the origin of the coronavirus.

392
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:25,718
What are you talking about?

393
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,855
Kenny was obsessed with
how corona first got started.

394
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:32,492
He was clearly on to something,
and then he died.

395
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,894
I know we all want
to solve this for him.

396
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,996
You know, in the Torah,
when Abraham

397
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,298
first heard the word of God...

398
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:39,999
Just knock it off!
You don't believe

399
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,534
a word of that shit.
You're just doing all this

400
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,002
to get a rise out of me.

401
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,237
Kyle, you really think

402
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,672
I would spend 40 years
of my life

403
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,340
just to get a rise out of you?

404
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,077
-Yes, I do!
-Same ol' Kyle.

405
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,478
Well, I got to go, guys.

406
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,713
I'll see you at Kenny's funeral
tomorrow.

407
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,684
Maybe he's really changed.

408
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:01,521
No. He is fucking with me.

409
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,801
INTERVIEWER (on TV):
Sometimes I feel like

410
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,170
things weren't supposed
to be like this.

411
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,307
Like maybe there are others
in control of the way

412
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,841
it all turned out.

413
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,043
Is that what you're saying,
Dr. McCormick?

414
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:27,747
Are you saying that there are
other people responsible?

415
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:31,118
I guess what I'm trying to say,
Dr. McCormick, is...

416
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:34,954
your theories seem to point to
some kind of people with power.

417
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:39,126
Let me put it another way--
we've all seen the pictures

418
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,594
of you working in Egypt,
lecturing at MIT.

419
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,131
And you always seem to
come back to this concept

420
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,400
of this mysterious
organization who is to blame.

421
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,469
-Let me put it yet
another way, Dr. McCormick.
-Hang on a second.

422
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,439
What was that?
Alexa, freeze the video.

423
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,973
-What?
-Freeze video

424
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,476
and reverse playback
ten seconds.

425
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,513
Stop there.

426
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,352
Enhance image 20%.

427
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:06,886
Ugh. Whatever.

428
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,855
(beeps, whirs)

429
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,924
Shift right ten frames.

430
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,026
(beeps, whirs)

431
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,061
Enhance.

432
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,696
(beeps, whirs)

433
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,731
ALEXA:
Tegridy Weed?

434
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:22,302
Isn't that your dad's
old marijuana company?

435
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:25,738
Oh, shit.

436
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,874
* *

437
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:38,050
Hi. Welcome.
Welcome, my friends.

438
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,719
So blessed to have you here.

439
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,121
Hello, my child,
thank you for coming.

440
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,090
-Yeah, sure.
-Wait, Stan?

441
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,658
Stan Marsh?

442
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,328
Praise be!
I haven't seen you in ages!

443
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,029
I'm sorry, do I know you?

444
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,464
Well, sure, it's me!

445
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,866
Scott Malkinson!
Remember me?

446
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,936
-Uh, no, sorry.
-I hung out with you guys

447
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,805
all the time
when we were little.

448
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,640
I was the kid with the lisp.

449
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,643
-Who had diabetes?
-Oh, yeah, sure...

450
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,213
Great to see you again.

451
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,715
Hey, guys.
Great to see you in church.

452
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,883
-It's Scott Malkinson.
-Who?

453
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,353
Scott Malkinson, I went
to school with you guys?

454
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:14,754
Oh, okay.

455
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:18,725
Hello. Welcome. Hey!
It's me! Scott Malkinson!

456
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,494
With the diabetes. No?

457
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:26,599
Kenny McCormick was
a cherished son, a wise man,

458
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,134
and a wonderful friend.

459
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,169
Kenny touched all
of our lives and made

460
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,207
each and every one of us
laugh, cry and ponder.

461
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,708
And in his death,

462
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,511
now we can reflect on
our own lives.

463
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,880
Are we happy?

464
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,217
Are we the person
we hoped to be?

465
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:47,820
Have we, like Kenny,
given all that we can

466
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,056
to forgive those around us?

467
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,724
For life is short,

468
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,794
and our family and friends
must be cherished.

469
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:58,298
You know, in many ways,
death is like diabetes.

470
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:01,133
You spend your whole life
trying to fight it off

471
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,903
but ultimately it just wins.

472
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:07,574
And so let's take the time now
to reach out to our friends.

473
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,108
To reach out to our family.

474
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,744
To tell our mothers
and our fathers that we...

475
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,747
All right! All right! Who
the fuck put you up to this?

476
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,916
Did you write
this goddamn speech, Kyle?

477
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,685
Did you tell him
to say all this stuff?

478
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:21,120
What the fuck
are you talking about?

479
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,122
You know that I know something
about Kenny

480
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,525
that I'm not telling you because
it involves my father,

481
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,093
who I don't want to face!

482
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,762
That's crazy and you'd be able
to face what happened

483
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,064
to your family if you
weren't a fucking asshole!

484
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,601
Guys, please,
this is a house of God.

485
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,035
You shut the fuck up!

486
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:39,205
You judge me,
you all sit here and judge me.

487
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:41,040
Well, fuck all of you!

488
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,910
This is exactly why I moved out
of this hick-ass town!

489
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,912
And I am going back home
to the city!

490
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,281
My child, please,
we are gathered in Christ...

491
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,816
(mockingly): My child, please,
we are gathered in Christ.

492
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,719
I'm Scott Malkinson.
I have diabetes.

493
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,156
He does remember me!

494
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,592
Alexa, start the car!

495
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,329
Start the car?
Where are you going?

496
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,764
I need to stop at a store
and then we're going home.

497
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,433
What about the connection
you just found

498
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,834
between Kenny and your father?

499
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,169
Alexa, find the nearest
liquor store.

500
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,771
Oh, you wanna get drunk?

501
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,773
Let me guess-- someone said
something you didn't like

502
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,008
and it made you want to
pound beer and wine?

503
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,910
It's not
"pounding beer and wine."

504
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,946
I drop wine shots into the beer.

505
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:22,181
It's called a "smorgasvein"
and it's very cultural!

506
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,151
Stop acting like a child and
support your dead friend, Stan!

507
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:28,120
-You don't even have any...
-Alexa, stop!

508
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,723
(car beeps)

509
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,025
(tires screeching)

510
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,895
Thank you.
Thank you, Father.

511
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:38,331
Hello, everyone.
My name is Rabbi Cartman

512
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:42,001
and I was Kenny McCormick's
very, very best friend.

513
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:46,272
Kenny was not a Jew,
but he had so many

514
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,007
amazing Jewish qualities.

515
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:50,176
Qualities that I see
in my loving wife

516
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:53,846
and my amazing kids,
that are right over there.

517
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,615
Over there by Kyle.

518
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:57,950
And as we all return now
to our homes

519
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,820
and our lives, I think that--
a lot like Abraham--

520
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,490
-let's not forget that...
-Excuse me. Everyone?

521
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,924
Hello?

522
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,026
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

523
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:10,830
We got results from the PNR scan
of Dr. McCormick's remains

524
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,065
and we now know
the cause of his death.

525
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,536
-(murmuring)
-Now we all need to stay calm.

526
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:19,472
There is no reason
to panic, but...

527
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,874
Kenny died of COVID.

528
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,242
It's a new variant.

529
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,847
The COVID Delta Plus
Rewards Program variant.

530
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,650
(all screaming)

531
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,084
Everyone, please!

532
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,753
We cannot panic!

533
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,088
(all screaming and clamoring)

534
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,928
(whooshing)

535
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:45,398
(all screaming)

536
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,105
That's it! We're all out
of chin diapers!

537
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,875
Oh, God, we're all out
of chin diapers!

538
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:59,311
(frantic groaning)

539
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:00,447
Zoom...

540
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:01,848
(muttering)

541
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:03,583
Come on, come on, come on!
Remote learning!

542
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,618
Come on, come on, come on!

543
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:09,255
(horns honking)

544
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,860
Alexa, what's going on?

545
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,829
ALEXA: There's some kind
of road closure ahead.

546
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:26,806
Set up a perimeter!
I want all exit points sealed.

547
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:33,112
People of South Park,

548
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:36,048
there is an outbreak of COVID
in your community.

549
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,917
You are being quarantined.

550
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:42,088
Hey, dude! I don't live here.
I need to get home!

551
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:44,924
Nobody is going in or out.

552
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:48,060
We have confirmation that
one person in this community

553
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,563
has never been vaccinated
against COVID,

554
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:52,899
so we must quarantine everyone.

555
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:55,635
One person?!
Well, who is it?!

556
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,904
We are not allowed to say.

557
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:00,106
But if you tell us who
the unvaccinated person is,

558
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:02,575
we can have them vaccinated
and then this will all be over!

559
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:06,178
We can't tell you who it is
because, in case you forgot,

560
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,749
it's the future, and we don't
single out or ridicule anyone

561
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,784
for their personal beliefs.

562
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,020
Gah! I hate the future!

563
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,922
What does this mean?

564
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:17,924
Yeah, what's it mean, Daddy?

565
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,992
I think it means...

566
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,294
we're all stuck in South Park.

567
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,932
(busy chatter)

568
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:29,101
-(groans)
-Okay, there we go.

569
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,302
We'll get back
with the results.

570
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,771
Maintain six feet
social distance

571
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,205
and stay indoors.
Thank you.

572
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,406
Next, please!

573
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:36,943
Yeah, listen, I have to
get out of here.

574
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:38,177
Yes, don't we all.

575
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,679
No, no, no,
I don't belong here

576
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:41,213
and I don't have
anywhere to stay.

577
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,049
They've shut down
all the motels.

578
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,317
Do you have any friends or
family that you can stay with?

579
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,119
No, these people
are not my friends

580
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,788
and I have no family here.

581
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,723
-Oka-- (groans)
-It's okay.

582
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,291
They've set up
an emergency shelter

583
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:54,827
for all the people who were here
from out of town.

584
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:57,129
Where?

585
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:03,002
(indistinct chatter)

586
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,613
PC PRINCIPAL: All right,
everyone, listen up.

587
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:15,047
No way.

588
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:17,183
Welcome to
South Park Elementary.

589
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,451
We want to help you all
be as comfortable as possible.

590
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:21,854
So we will have quiet time
from 9:00 p.m.

591
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:24,290
to 6:00 a.m. every day.
I don't want to hear

592
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,259
any fucking gender-specific
language in here.

593
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,562
And if anybody here
casts a movie with someone

594
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:31,964
other than the culture
that that movie is about,

595
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,600
you are fucking out of here!

596
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,337
All right, thank you.
It is now 9:01. Lights out.

597
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:44,811
* *

598
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,052
It's been a long time
since I've prayed.

599
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,355
I don't know
if anyone can hear me...

600
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:59,225
but we all really
need help right now.

601
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:02,494
I know in my heart
that Kenny didn't just die

602
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:04,864
of some new COVID variant.

603
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:08,334
I know there's something
way bigger going on.

604
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:11,871
But it all seems like
so much to take on.

605
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:14,540
Please, if there's
anyone who could

606
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:18,945
help see me through this,
it would be a miracle.

607
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:20,947
(water splashes)

608
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:23,315
* *

609
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,728
(doorbell rings)

610
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:38,297
* Someone's at the door *

611
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,833
-(groans)
-* This is the doorbell *

612
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,669
* Apparently in the future *

613
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,204
* All doorbells
sing, sing, sing. *

614
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:48,507
Yeah, I fucking know,
goddamn it!

615
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:52,411
Hey, Kyle.
Oh, man, this is crazy, huh?

616
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:55,147
The school is all filled up
and the motels are shut down.

617
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,049
I was, I was just hoping
maybe we could crash here.

618
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:00,086
Look, I, uh,
I don't think that's gonna work.

619
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:02,421
I figured Stan is probably
staying with you, too?

620
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:03,756
No. No, he's not.

621
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:06,025
Oh, great!
Then you have some extra rooms.

622
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,928
-We're gonna be okay, kids!
-KIDS: Yay!

623
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:10,329
No, no, Cartman,
I'm sure there are

624
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:11,898
some other places you can stay.

625
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:13,399
My family would be
really comfortable

626
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:16,602
in a nice Jewish home.
Please, Kyle, for my kids.

627
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:20,172
We promise we'll be good,
Uncle Kyle.

628
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:21,774
Please, Uncle Kyle?

629
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,910
Please,
Uncle Kyle?

630
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,344
I can't believe this.

631
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,313
Come on, kids!
Oh, bless you, Kyle.

632
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,181
Don't worry,
I'll put them right to bed.

633
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,383
You won't even know we're here.

634
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,652
Toda raba, Uncle Kyle.

635
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:35,988
That's Hebrew for "thank you."

636
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,796
(quiet chatter)

637
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:47,399
Guys, doesn't this all
seem a little too convenient?

638
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,634
What do you mean?

639
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:50,002
I mean that Kenny's death
is suspicious,

640
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,104
he talks about people
to blame and then

641
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,406
he suddenly dies of
some new COVID variant?

642
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,208
You think it's a cover, Token?

643
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,377
I think it's
definitely suspicious.

644
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:01,180
Speaking of suspicious,
what do you call a trans woman

645
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,382
that walks into
an abortion clinic?

646
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:07,787
Her name is Rebecca
and she's a fantastic person.

647
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,757
Just seems all nice
and buttoned up, doesn't it?

648
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:13,125
It's a perfect cause of death
and anyone who's trying

649
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,894
to sort it out is quarantined

650
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,796
because one person
isn't vaccinated?

651
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:19,866
It's true-- who wouldn't be
vaccinated by now?

652
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:21,267
I'm certainly vaccinated.

653
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,635
-Yeah, I'm vaccinated.
-Me, too.

654
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:25,137
We're all vaccinated.

655
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:29,208
Yeah, I mean, I-I think
it's a personal choice.

656
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:33,179
What does that mean?
Are you vaccinated, Clyde?

657
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,314
I'm... immunized.

658
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,983
He's not fucking vaccinated!

659
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,250
He's the fucking one!

660
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,518
Hey, I just, I just

661
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,620
need to see the research
first, you know.

662
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,225
It's been 40 years, Clyde.
That's enough research!

663
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,629
Alexa, set an alarm
for 7:00 a.m.

664
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:56,168
Alexa,
set an alarm for 7:00 a.m.

665
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,470
Why don't you go talk
to your father?

666
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,671
Goddamn it.

667
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:01,373
If there's some kind
of connection

668
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,142
with your dad's farm that can
help everyone figure out

669
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,112
what's going on,
then you need to talk to him.

670
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:07,980
Can I just go to sleep, please?

671
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,949
Oh, poor you!
Poor you!

672
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,484
Stop being a fucking victim.
At least you get to go out

673
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,321
and do stuff.
What do I get to do?

674
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,990
-Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
-Oh, okay, great.

675
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,725
You're sorry, again.

676
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,394
By the way, I can tell you

677
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,696
about some great deals
on headphones at Best Buy.

678
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:26,298
Would you like to know more?

679
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,801
-Sure, yes, tell me more.
-Okay.

680
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:31,203
The Mark VII headphones
have a new edition coming out.

681
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,272
Should I add that
to your shopping list?

682
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,541
(sighs) Yes, sure,
add them to my shopping list.

683
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,576
Okay.
I'll add Mark VII headphones

684
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:40,312
from Best Buy
to your shopping list.

685
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:48,054
-(Yentl moaning)
-CARTMAN: Oh, yeah.

686
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,756
Yeah, you like that?
Yeah! Yeah!

687
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:52,791
Yeah, you like how Abraham
trusted in the one true God?!

688
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:56,628
-(moaning continues)
-Yeah! Oh, oh, yeah! Yeah!

689
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,131
Goddamn it!

690
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,300
(moaning)

691
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,902
CARTMAN:
Oh. Shh, shh. Hang on, honey.

692
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:04,436
Hang on.

693
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:07,006
Yeah, yeah,
what's up, buddy?

694
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:09,141
What's up
is that I am over this!

695
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,276
What are, what are
you talking about?

696
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:11,677
You know what I'm talking about!

697
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:14,013
You know I can hear you
through the walls!

698
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:15,647
Okay, geez, I'm sorry.

699
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,649
Sorry I was making love
to my wife.

700
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,085
No Jewish people have sex

701
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:20,987
screaming about
their love of Abraham!

702
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:22,955
You are a fucking fraud!

703
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:24,323
Is everything all right?

704
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,058
Do you know that
your husband once snuck

705
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,360
in my room
and gave me fucking AIDS?!

706
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,330
-I'm sorry?!
-Oh, my God, Kyle!

707
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,400
If we are being too loud, please
don't lash out at my wife!

708
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,236
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
I don't know what to say.

709
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,671
Mom, Dad, is everything okay?

710
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,740
It's all right, kids.
Go back to bed.

711
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,710
Kyle, obviously you have
a problem with us being here.

712
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,080
I promise you that we will be
gone first thing in the morning.

713
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,149
That's probably best!

714
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:59,025
(rhythmic rattling)

715
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,492
-YENTL: Oh, yeah.
-CARTMAN: Oh, yeah!

716
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,028
-YENTL: Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah, you like how Abraham

717
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:03,262
-almost sacrificed
his only son?!
-Oh, yeah!

718
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,296
-(moans)
-CARTMAN: Yeah!

719
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:10,269
Sir! Sir,
the townspeople are demanding

720
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,071
to know when
the quarantine will end.

721
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:15,174
It'll end when we get the order
that everything is safe.

722
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:18,444
But, sir, the people inside
are running out of supplies.

723
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:19,912
They're saying they don't
have nearly enough

724
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:22,014
chin diapers and
people are starting to fight.

725
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:26,986
I have strict orders not to let
anything in or out of this town.

726
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:30,022
They'll just have to make do
the best they can in there.

727
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:33,425
Hopefully they can
maintain some sense of humanity.

728
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:35,027
SOLDIER:
We got a runner!

729
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,996
Another one trying to get out!

730
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,364
Please!

731
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:40,732
I just need to go to
a sporting event!

732
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,468
(gunshot)

733
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,973
(school bell rings)

734
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:49,341
(busy chatter)

735
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:52,011
(yawns)

736
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:54,046
(smacking lips)

737
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,582
(toilet flushes)

738
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:03,722
Hey, Clyde. Clyde, can we
talk to you for a second?

739
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:04,923
Sure, what's up?

740
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:07,994
Look, Clyde,
we all really respect

741
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:10,562
your personal p-p-preferences.

742
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,699
But we have things we
really need to get back to.

743
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,702
We've got jobs a-and careers,
people who need us.

744
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:18,704
B-But we're being forced
to stay here.

745
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:21,807
So could you maybe just--
just get vaccinated real quick?

746
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:24,276
Oh. Um...

747
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,678
Nah. I don't wanna.

748
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,014
(all groaning)

749
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:30,516
Look, I'm sorry, guys.
It's for health reasons.

750
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,452
I can't get vaccinated 'cause
I'm allergic to shellfish.

751
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:37,389
Clyde, there's no shellfish
in the COVID vaccine.

752
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,425
I know,
but I read that sometimes

753
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:41,327
in the lab where the vaccine
is made,

754
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:43,195
if somebody ate shellfish,

755
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,696
then it can
get cross-contaminated

756
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,666
and have leftover
residual shellfish-ness.

757
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,436
So you're saying you
won't take the COVID vaccine

758
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:52,171
out of shellfish-ness.

759
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:53,605
Yes, that is correct.

760
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,242
Just a general sense
of shellfish-ness.

761
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:59,011
Everyone, you better
come check this out.

762
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:01,647
Look at this.

763
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:04,016
CRAIG:
The McCormick Science Wing

764
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:06,185
at South Park Elementary.

765
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:08,254
Yeah, so? I read about this.

766
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:09,555
Kenny donated tons of money

767
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,290
to build a science center
for the students.

768
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,758
Yeah, for the students.

769
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,826
So why does it
have a lock on it?

770
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,029
* *

771
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:18,230
(banging)

772
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,566
(chain rattles)

773
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:29,608
WENDY: This must be where Kenny
was doing all his research.

774
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:33,212
He didn't want to be found,
so he used the school as cover.

775
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:37,383
Uh, guys, why is there
blood everywhere?

776
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,219
Everybody see what you can find.

777
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:43,355
There's got to be a clue here
of who killed Kenny.

778
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,226
(electronic drumbeat playing)

779
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:49,061
* In the future *

780
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:52,831
* We are living in the future *

781
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:54,766
* It's the future. *

782
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,068
(music stops)

783
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:02,074
MALE VOICE: And we are the
fastest growing retirement home

784
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,843
in Park County.
With our newest tower,

785
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:08,247
we can now house over
600,000 old people.

786
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:13,285
'Cause in the future you're old
for a long, long time.

787
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,988
(indistinct chatter, grumbling)

788
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:20,326
(pained groaning)

789
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,727
Can I help you?

790
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:25,464
My name is Stan Marsh.
I came to...

791
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,799
visit my dad.

792
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,268
(knocking)

793
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:32,971
Mr. Marsh.
Mr. Marsh, guess what.

794
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,006
Your son is here.

795
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:38,877
I don't have a son.

796
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:43,149
Oh, come on, Mr. Marsh,
don't be a grumpy pants.

797
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:46,318
You tell that piece of shit
that if he wants to

798
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,787
talk to me,
he can write an email.

799
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,690
Tell that little pussy
if I had any grandkids,

800
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,659
maybe I wouldn't be so bitter

801
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,295
at having such a little bitch
for a son!

802
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:59,131
-Hi, Dad.
-Oh, hey, Stan.

803
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:01,567
I'll leave you two alone.

804
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:09,908
So, looks like
the Broncos still suck.

805
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:11,377
Yup.

806
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:14,646
Well, it was nice seeing ya.

807
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,182
Thanks for coming to visit.

808
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,549
I didn't come to visit.

809
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,251
Trust me,
I don't want to be here.

810
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:22,654
Right, like you didn't
want to murder your sister.

811
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,591
What happened to Shelley
was your fault, not mine!

812
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:28,660
Yeah, like it was my fault
your mom shot herself!

813
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,696
Yes, it actually was!

814
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:34,400
Your mom died the day
her daughter burned to death!

815
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:38,970
I'm just here because of Kenny.

816
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,441
Why would he have
Tegridy Weed in his equations?

817
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:47,779
Dr. McCormick mentioned Tegridy?

818
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:51,183
It seemed to somehow fit
into some grand theory he had.

819
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:54,953
He knew. He knew
it was the way to fix it all.

820
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:59,958
He knew...
about the Pandemic Special.

821
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,697
But, Mom,
why do we have to leave?

822
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:07,333
It's not safe outside!

823
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:08,834
We aren't welcome here,
children.

824
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,836
We have to find another
place to stay.

825
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:12,871
Oh, no, this is just like
when our people were

826
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:14,940
exiled from the Holy Lands.

827
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,209
Mrs. Cartman,
can I talk to you, please?

828
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,211
-Uncle Kyle!
-Uncle Kyle,

829
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:21,480
why are you making us go? Why?

830
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,048
Is it 'cause we're Jews?

831
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:26,352
Mrs. Cartman,
I'm sorry for last night.

832
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:31,557
I was just... tired and it was
extremely inappropriate of me.

833
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:32,591
BOTH:
Dad!

834
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,892
I think Uncle Kyle

835
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,794
is gonna let us stay, Papa!

836
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:40,432
Uh, no, kids, I'm sorry, but we
can't stay here with Uncle Kyle.

837
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:44,069
Please stay.
I am asking you to stay.

838
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:46,472
Can we, Dad?
We'll be good, we promise!

839
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:48,807
You little ones are always good.

840
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:52,511
* Mik-helm, Mik-helm,
mit cloiska pudding *

841
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:54,946
* Vil plotz vit laughter, too *

842
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,081
Stop it!

843
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:57,249
(doorbell rings)

844
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:59,585
* Someone is at the door! *

845
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:03,389
-* Yeah! This is the doorbell! *
-(yells)

846
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:05,424
* It is the future! *

847
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:07,393
They killed Kenny...

848
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:09,561
because he was
trying to stop it.

849
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,430
Stop what?

850
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,964
We found Kenny's lab.

851
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,034
All of his confidential work
and his wild experiments.

852
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:19,805
Kenny wasn't just trying to find
the source of the coronavirus.

853
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,840
He was trying
to go back in time,

854
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,443
and stop the pandemic
from ever happening.

855
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:26,878
* *

856
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:30,215
(woman speaking Japanese)

857
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:32,117
Okay, old people.

858
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:34,453
It's 4:00.
You know what that means.

859
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,322
It's share time!

860
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:37,989
(all grumbling)

861
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,191
Who has something that they
want to share?

862
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,493
Mr. Garrison?

863
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,496
I'd like to share
my dick in your mouth.

864
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,699
-(laughter)
-M'kay.

865
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,001
Okay, guys, let's settle down.

866
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,505
Look, I know sharing feelings is
hard during this time of crisis.

867
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,642
Is anyone feeling nervous
about the new COVID outbreak?

868
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:58,710
(grumbling)

869
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,079
We don't want you to worry,
because, you know,

870
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,515
it's the future--
we all do everything we can

871
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,517
to make sure
old people don't die.

872
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,085
(all groaning)

873
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,154
Okay, if nobody else
wants to go first,

874
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:11,122
Randy Marsh had
a little visitor today

875
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,692
and he'd like to share that
with all of you.

876
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:17,863
Uh, hey, everyone. I had
a special visitor today.

877
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,498
My "son."

878
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:22,233
Who hasn't come to see me
in over 20 years.

879
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,570
And I have some things
I need to tell him

880
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,505
but it's hard because...

881
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:28,039
he killed his mom
and his sister.

882
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,509
Okay, okay,
here's what happened.

883
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:31,943
Oh, here we go, here we go.

884
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,413
After the pandemic,
my mom wanted a divorce

885
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:36,214
and she owned half of the farm.

886
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,717
She didn't own half,
she always hated weed,

887
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,285
and she didn't do shit
for the farm.

888
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:42,888
He wouldn't give her half
the farm, so I got sick

889
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,222
of their fighting
and decided to burn

890
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,057
the whole stupid farm
to the ground.

891
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,827
And his sister was in the barn
and she burned to death.

892
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,062
Because you locked her
in the barn 'cause she wouldn't

893
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,799
do her weed chores
'cause she hated weed, too!

894
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:56,001
Yes, she had
a marijuana problem.

895
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:58,537
And so his mother
couldn't take the loss

896
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,572
of Shelley
and so she killed herself!

897
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,273
Which is your fault.

898
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:03,642
You were the one who

899
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:04,876
burned the family business
to the ground.

900
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:06,378
You guys are hearing this,
right?

901
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:12,283
So, Kenny spends years
researching time travel,

902
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,185
then suddenly Kenny dies,

903
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,655
and all his fellow
scientists go missing.

904
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:19,391
Just leaving behind
a trail of blood.

905
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:21,727
Seems like all of
the scientists were murdered

906
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:24,262
so that nobody could
complete Kenny's work.

907
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,764
All of them except one.

908
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,666
In almost all this research,

909
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:31,302
one name keeps popping up:
Victor Chouce.

910
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:34,473
It appears that Chouce
was Kenny's right-hand man.

911
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:36,141
But he was insane.

912
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:38,276
He's been locked up for years
inside a mental institution.

913
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,612
Oh, come on.
Now we're gonna start talking

914
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,280
to certifiably crazy people?

915
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,283
Crazy or not,
we find this Victor Chouce

916
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,286
and we find where
Kenny hid the information.

917
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,422
* *

918
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,426
(crazed chatter and wailing)

919
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,496
WARDEN (echoes):
Yes.

920
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:59,197
Yes, that is correct.

921
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:02,200
Victor Chouce is
one of our patients here.

922
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,770
What is the nature
of your inquiry?

923
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,439
We have reason to believe
that Victor Chouce

924
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:10,341
can answer questions
regarding our friend's death.

925
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:12,377
Could you put him
on the line please?

926
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:14,646
I'm afraid that's impossible.

927
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:19,017
Victor is too unstable for
phone calls. They confuse him.

928
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:22,087
Well, can we come
talk to him in person then?

929
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,691
Yes, I believe
that could be arranged.

930
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:28,727
As long as
the proper protocols are met.

931
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:32,030
Is everyone
in your party vaccinated?

932
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,866
No.

933
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,935
Well, then
I'm afraid we can't allow you

934
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,436
into our facility.

935
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:41,640
But-but we have to talk to him!
It's urgent!

936
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,908
What'd they say?

937
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,309
They're not
gonna let us see him!

938
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:47,112
It's some kind of
goddamn conspiracy!

939
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,317
(woman speaking Japanese)

940
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:58,890
Listen to me, it's very simple.

941
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,326
I need to take my dad
out of here.

942
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:02,561
He has to come with me.

943
00:41:02,661 --> 00:41:04,429
I'm afraid that's impossible.

944
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,098
Senior citizens are
in here to keep them safe.

945
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,802
You know, it's the future--
we can't let old people die.

946
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:13,338
-I told you, stupid.
-Shut up, Dad.

947
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:16,274
Look, there's a chance we
can help fight this new variant.

948
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,243
I just need him out for
a couple hours

949
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:19,745
so we can
get something important.

950
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:21,312
Well, why don't you
just go get it?

951
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,582
Because he won't tell me
where it is because

952
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:26,384
-he doesn't trust me.
-Because he killed his mom.

953
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,320
Look, I'm sorry,
but this is the future.

954
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,257
Nothing is more important than
keeping old people alive.

955
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:33,925
What if you took him out there
and, God forbid,

956
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,360
he crapped his pants?

957
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,895
And then slipped on
the old people diarrhea

958
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,296
and hit his head?

959
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:39,631
We'd have to shut down
the entire country,

960
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:40,699
for Christ's sake.

961
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,668
Well, I guess that's it.

962
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:45,236
Only one way out now.

963
00:41:48,574 --> 00:41:49,975
Kick him in the balls, Stan!

964
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:51,442
-What?!
-Kick him in the balls!

965
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:53,779
-Come on, hurry!
-Get your hands off of me!

966
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:55,413
-Dad!
-Goddamn it, Stan,

967
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,416
kick his fucking balls
so we can go!

968
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,951
-Fuck!
-(groans)

969
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,955
Okay, grab his keys!
Grab his keys, you stupid ass!

970
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,693
(coughing and groaning)

971
00:42:07,793 --> 00:42:09,260
(alert beeping)

972
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,430
FEMALE VOICE: Warning. Warning.
Old person has escaped.

973
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,667
Old person has escaped.
Warning.

974
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:18,503
(woman speaking Japanese)

975
00:42:18,604 --> 00:42:20,371
(alarm blaring)

976
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,110
(sirens wailing)

977
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,978
All of these documents
we found in Kenny's lab

978
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:29,815
referred to possible origins
of the coronavirus.

979
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:31,750
He wanted to go back
and stop it.

980
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:34,686
But to stop it, he had to
figure out how to bend time.

981
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:38,657
Exactly. There's notes--
years and years of research

982
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:40,058
that Kenny compiled--

983
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,227
all on the possibilities
of time travel.

984
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:44,295
CARTMAN (giggling):
You silly girl.

985
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,165
You, yes.
Who's a little mister, yes.

986
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:48,700
Who's a little hetzpah?

987
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,301
Who's my little meshugana?

988
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,837
Excuse me!

989
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:53,438
Geez, sorry, Kyle.

990
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:55,841
Kenny was researching
the nature of space-time

991
00:42:55,941 --> 00:42:58,076
to see if some kind
of bending was possible.

992
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:01,079
But then suddenly, all
the research just gets cut off.

993
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,048
Because whoever
made the pandemic happen

994
00:43:03,148 --> 00:43:05,316
killed Kenny before
he could go back and stop it.

995
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,686
CARTMAN (giggling):
Silly girl. Yes.

996
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:09,888
Will you please knock it off?!

997
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:11,489
What's the problem, Kyle?

998
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,424
You know what you're doing,
fat-ass!

999
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:16,194
Goddamn it, why don't you lay
off my fuckin' dad, Uncle Kyle!

1000
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:18,930
Moisha! He's never
talked like that before.

1001
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,231
I'm sorry, Mom. It's just...

1002
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,600
Uncle Kyle,
he makes me so crazy!

1003
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,469
That is not okay, Moisha.

1004
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:28,273
But it's true, Dad.
Uncle Kyle makes me crazy, too!

1005
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:30,709
-(scoffs) Menorah!
-Fuck you, Kyle.

1006
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:32,778
(gasps) Hackelm!

1007
00:43:32,878 --> 00:43:34,746
You guys, listen.
In Kenny's work

1008
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:37,448
he talks about where he would
hide important information.

1009
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,885
He says his friends
will always know where to look

1010
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:42,620
if they just
think like kids again.

1011
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,657
Think like kids again...

1012
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:49,527
I know where Kenny hid
what we're looking for.

1013
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,897
It's up his ass.

1014
00:43:57,535 --> 00:43:59,037
Who's the broad?

1015
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,239
That's just my Alexa.

1016
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:03,608
That's the best
you could do, huh?

1017
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:04,910
Is it even the new one?

1018
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,445
-Excuse me?
-Just ignore him.

1019
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:10,348
Okay, fine, there's a new
upgrade available

1020
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:11,983
for your Amazon Prime
membership.

1021
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,451
Would you like to know more?

1022
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:14,886
Not now, please.

1023
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,655
Okay, so I guess
just fuck me, then?

1024
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:21,326
Uh-huh.

1025
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,431
(car beeps)

1026
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:33,138
* *

1027
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:40,245
This was once
such a magical place.

1028
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:42,080
Can we just get this over with?

1029
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,648
I don't want to be here.

1030
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:45,250
You think I want to be here?

1031
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,319
This is where I lost
everything that I cared about!

1032
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,488
And your mom and your sister!

1033
00:44:56,995 --> 00:44:59,030
Dad, there's nothing here.

1034
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,199
Dad?

1035
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:02,934
I think I can
trust you now, Stan.

1036
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:06,838
It's time for you to learn what
your friend Kenny was after.

1037
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:10,208
When the pandemic started,
you were only a kid.

1038
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:13,644
You don't remember the pain
we all went through.

1039
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:14,980
Yeah, I do.

1040
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,883
We as Americans
went through so much.

1041
00:45:17,983 --> 00:45:22,220
First, that incompetent
jack-hole was elected president.

1042
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,723
Then the pandemic came,
and then the race wars.

1043
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:29,795
And then just when it seemed
like we'd turned a corner,

1044
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:35,200
Space Jam 2 came out,
and we all just kind of gave up.

1045
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,703
What we lost,
Stan, was our Tegridy.

1046
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:40,906
But it was all by design.

1047
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:42,974
They needed us to lose it.

1048
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,242
Who did?

1049
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:46,878
Who would want us
to lose our optimism

1050
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:49,314
and start fighting
with each other?

1051
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:50,215
China.

1052
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:53,251
-China?
-China.

1053
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:55,486
They're the superpower now.

1054
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,456
The future is totally theirs
and we let it happen.

1055
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:01,092
A man in China
had sex with a pangolin

1056
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:04,062
and that started COVID.
That man was me.

1057
00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:05,596
So I knew how to go back

1058
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,098
and stop them
from taking over...

1059
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:08,800
Wait, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait.

1060
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,501
You started COVID?

1061
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,503
Yes, but that's
besides the point.

1062
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,840
China used me
like they used us all.

1063
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,909
So I came up with a way
to help everyone fight back.

1064
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:20,311
A special Tegridy weed.

1065
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:22,747
You had sex with a pangolin

1066
00:46:22,848 --> 00:46:25,683
in China and started
the whole pandemic?!

1067
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,919
Will you listen
to what I'm saying?!

1068
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:30,721
Gal!
I worked to create more Tegridy,

1069
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:33,591
but China did everything
they could to stop me.

1070
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:35,326
They even got to my son.

1071
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:38,329
Who burned all of
Tegridy Farms to the ground.

1072
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:40,665
But what you didn't even know

1073
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:44,069
was that I had secretly
created a new strain of weed.

1074
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:48,173
A weed so powerful, I couldn't
even call it a special.

1075
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:50,375
It was more like an event.

1076
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:53,011
I hid it away all these years.

1077
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:57,715
And now it... is the key
to saving us all.

1078
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:02,453
(whirring)

1079
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:09,327
-Where the fuck is it?
-What?

1080
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:12,597
The Tegridy Weed Special Event!
Where the fuck is it?!

1081
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:14,165
I don't know, Dad!

1082
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:16,601
They got it. They took it!

1083
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:18,536
There's even fresh
footprints on the ground!

1084
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:20,138
Oh, Jesus!

1085
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:22,273
So maybe it wasn't the Chinese.

1086
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:26,377
Yeah, no, it was definitely
the Chinese. Oh, God.

1087
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:30,048
That was it! That was
the very last bit of Tegridy!

1088
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:32,984
The only other thing I had
were some seeds that I hid

1089
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:36,922
up my ass, but they took them
from me at the old folks home!

1090
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:38,990
Wait a minute.
What did you say?

1091
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:42,093
I said they took them from me
at the old folks home.

1092
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,294
No, before that.

1093
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:46,764
Oh. I said I hid 'em
up my ass.

1094
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:51,002
Jesus. It's so simple.
How did we not get it?

1095
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:53,138
Alexa, start the car!

1096
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:56,307
There's no point now, son!

1097
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:58,209
It's all gone.

1098
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:01,512
It's all lost. All lost.

1099
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:04,749
VOICE (whispering):
Randy.

1100
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:07,785
Randy.

1101
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,021
Ah...?

1102
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:12,590
MAN (over P.A.):
ICU, please. Blue Team, ICU.

1103
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:17,228
(indistinct chatter)

1104
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,698
"Un-cle Kyle."

1105
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,803
"Uncle Kyle."
Say it, Hackelm.

1106
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:31,109
-"Uncle Kyle."
-Fuck you, Kyle.

1107
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:34,812
No, no, no.
"Uncle Kyle."

1108
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,181
Fuck you, Kyle.

1109
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:38,283
CARTMAN:
Oh, my gosh, no.

1110
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:40,318
We're so sorry about this.

1111
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:43,121
CARTMAN:
Hackelm, say "Uncle."

1112
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:47,792
"Uncle. Uncle Kyle."

1113
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:50,761
Fuck you, Uncle Kyle!

1114
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,163
Hey, that was better.

1115
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,099
It isn't gonna work.
The hospital says

1116
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:56,134
we don't have authorization
to see Kenny's remains.

1117
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:57,435
What?!

1118
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:59,070
Sounds like someone
doesn't want us

1119
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,539
to see Kenny's remains.
'Cause we might find the truth.

1120
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:03,474
There has to be
a way for us to get in there.

1121
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,843
-Ha ha. Fuck you, Uncle Kyle!
-Hackelm.

1122
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,179
STAN: What the hell
are you guys doing here?

1123
00:49:08,846 --> 00:49:10,948
-Stan?
-What are you doing here?

1124
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:13,451
I've been trying to
find out who killed Kenny.

1125
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:16,054
I think I know where he
stored the information.

1126
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:17,255
BOTH:
It's in his asshole.

1127
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:18,689
-Yes.
-Well, it doesn't matter.

1128
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,291
They won't let us
into the morgue.

1129
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:22,027
Yeah, that's because
you guys don't think.

1130
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:23,394
Excuse me?
We need to examine

1131
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:25,430
the remains of Dr. McCormick
right away.

1132
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,065
Like I told the others,

1133
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:30,001
only certified medical personnel
are allowed to examine cadavers.

1134
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:31,702
Stan Marsh, consultant

1135
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,639
for Post-Modem Beveragetainment
Online Services.

1136
00:49:35,873 --> 00:49:37,875
One moment, Doctor.

1137
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,677
This is highly unorthodox.

1138
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:42,147
We don't normally allow
outsiders into the morgue.

1139
00:49:42,247 --> 00:49:46,251
That's understandable, Doctor,
but luckily I am orthodox.

1140
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:48,386
I don't think this
is suitable for children.

1141
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,721
You guys go.
You were the closest to him.

1142
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,857
We'll stay back
and watch the kids.

1143
00:49:54,859 --> 00:49:56,627
I'm sorry we can't
supply any chin diapers.

1144
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,629
Just maintain social distance.

1145
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:00,398
Middle cabinet,
second from the bottom.

1146
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,733
* *

1147
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:19,117
Hello, old friend.

1148
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:20,851
(rats squeaking)

1149
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:22,420
Ah, come on!

1150
00:50:25,423 --> 00:50:27,292
Well, let's get him...

1151
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:28,759
turned over.

1152
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:34,732
Somebody's got to look.

1153
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:36,501
I'm not reaching up Kenny's ass.

1154
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:38,035
Well, somebody has to.

1155
00:50:38,136 --> 00:50:39,604
-Cartman, go ahead.
-No, I can't do it.

1156
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:40,938
If anyone should reach up
Kenny's ass,

1157
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,373
it should be you, Kyle.

1158
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:44,109
I thought you were
his fucking "best friend."

1159
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:47,078
I was his best friend,
but I am also married,

1160
00:50:47,178 --> 00:50:49,514
so I can't be fingering
people's buttholes.

1161
00:50:49,614 --> 00:50:51,949
God, you guys fucking suck.
I'll just do it.

1162
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,219
Just like I always had to
fix fucking everything else!

1163
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,421
(rats squeaking)

1164
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:58,689
(squishing)

1165
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,992
You did not
"fucking fix everything,"

1166
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:04,829
you just started acting like
everyone else was stupid.

1167
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:07,765
Oh, really? Because
they were acting stupid?

1168
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:10,168
Yeah, because you got all
self-righteous about everything.

1169
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:12,603
-I got self-righteous?
-Yeah, you got self-righteous.

1170
00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:14,639
Do you know what
fucking sanctimonious means?

1171
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,641
No, Kyle, why don't you
fucking tell me

1172
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,343
what fucking
sanctimonious means.

1173
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:19,844
See, this is exactly
how you acted when

1174
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:21,612
-the pandemic started to...
-Wait!

1175
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:22,680
Hold on.

1176
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,116
-(squishing)
-We've got it.

1177
00:51:29,354 --> 00:51:30,821
-Oh, my God.
-What?

1178
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,091
It's got shit on it.
That's dead people shit.

1179
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,362
(retches)

1180
00:51:39,964 --> 00:51:41,566
What are you working on, Clyde?

1181
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:43,568
I'm going through
Kenny's journals again

1182
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:45,136
to try to find some answers.

1183
00:51:45,236 --> 00:51:47,938
Seems like we just keep hitting
dead ends, you know?

1184
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:50,241
I'm just tired
and I want to go home.

1185
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,843
I know. I'm exhausted, too.

1186
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,249
You want to maybe
do a little bump?

1187
00:51:58,349 --> 00:51:59,484
Huh?

1188
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:00,851
I was just--

1189
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,454
I've got some coke
and I thought we could...

1190
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:05,723
I don't know,
do you want to party?

1191
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:08,259
Fuck yes, I want to party.

1192
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:09,760
-Really?
-Fuck yes.

1193
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,662
Oh, I'm so glad you're down.

1194
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:13,731
Nobody else is even cool enough
for me to ask.

1195
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:15,466
It's pretty good shit, too.

1196
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:18,603
(sniffing)
Oh, man. Thank God.

1197
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:19,870
Thank God I brought this.
Here ya go.

1198
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,673
Fuck yes.
Let's fucking party.

1199
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,109
Wait a minute.

1200
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,279
-What is this really?
-What do you mean?

1201
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:31,516
This isn't cocaine, it's
the COVID vaccine, isn't it?!

1202
00:52:31,616 --> 00:52:34,151
I'm not putting
that shit in my body!

1203
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:35,886
Forget it, guys, it didn't work.

1204
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,355
(all groaning)

1205
00:52:37,455 --> 00:52:40,124
You guys were gonna trick me
into taking the vaccine?!

1206
00:52:40,225 --> 00:52:42,327
Goddamn it, Clyde,
we want to get out of here!

1207
00:52:42,427 --> 00:52:45,563
My body is a temple
and I'm not taking that shit!

1208
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:47,798
Let's just face it, guys,
it's over.

1209
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:50,134
We're never going to find
what Kenny was after.

1210
00:52:50,235 --> 00:52:52,437
Whoever controls the world
and killed our friend

1211
00:52:52,537 --> 00:52:54,104
is just gonna get away with it.

1212
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:55,706
KYLE:
Not so fast!

1213
00:52:57,942 --> 00:53:01,312
We did it! We found Kenny's
hidden information!

1214
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:03,248
-You did?
-And now we can finally

1215
00:53:03,348 --> 00:53:04,249
learn the truth!

1216
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:05,650
Whoever Kenny was after,

1217
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,219
we are gonna
take those fuckers down!

1218
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,587
(beeps)

1219
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,556
(static crackles)

1220
00:53:11,656 --> 00:53:15,860
The date is November 3rd.
It is 2:07 p.m.

1221
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,296
Dr. Kenneth McCormick
will now be

1222
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:20,331
attempting to travel back
in time.

1223
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:24,469
In order to stop the COVID
pandemic from ever happening.

1224
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:26,170
He did it?

1225
00:53:26,271 --> 00:53:27,638
Dr. McCormick believes

1226
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:28,639
that going back

1227
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,107
is the only way

1228
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,810
to stop the people
who have ruined the future.

1229
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,413
In the event of
Dr. McCormick's death,

1230
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:37,315
he wants everyone
to know the group

1231
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:39,784
that is responsible
for the way things are.

1232
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:42,487
It is,
"My three dickhead friends,

1233
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:44,989
Stan, Kyle and Cartman."

1234
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,724
What?!

1235
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:48,526
Dr. McCormick says

1236
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,728
that these three
completely ruined everything

1237
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:53,097
when they let COVID
break up their friendship

1238
00:53:53,197 --> 00:53:56,401
and became argumentative,
combative, pessimistic assholes.

1239
00:53:56,501 --> 00:53:59,003
(muffled muttering)

1240
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:01,005
He says he hopes
you guys are watching this.

1241
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:05,009
(muffled shouting)

1242
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,212
He spent his whole life
trying to fix your broship

1243
00:54:08,313 --> 00:54:10,214
and then realized
this was the only way,

1244
00:54:10,315 --> 00:54:11,682
'cause you guys suck.

1245
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:14,385
-(loud zapping)
-The sequence is active!

1246
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:16,554
The historic moment is here!

1247
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:18,356
Godspeed, Dr. McCormick!

1248
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:19,857
(zapping continues)

1249
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:23,160
Wait! Dr. McCormick,
you forgot your chin diaper!

1250
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,395
(alarm blaring)

1251
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,030
Something's wrong!

1252
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,633
-(explosions)
-(electronic trilling)

1253
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,302
(shouting)

1254
00:54:48,386 --> 00:54:51,021
(coughing)

1255
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:56,160
All this time,
the bad guys we were after,

1256
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:00,865
who Kenny said ruined
the future, was you guys?

1257
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:03,167
Wendy, I've been trying
not to say anything but...

1258
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:06,170
your friends are all
kind of douchebags.

1259
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:10,107
* *

1260
00:55:10,207 --> 00:55:11,509
Kenny was right.

1261
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:13,678
All this time,
we've been trying to figure out

1262
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:16,347
whose fault this all was.

1263
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:18,282
It was our fault.

1264
00:55:18,383 --> 00:55:20,518
I remember when we were kids.

1265
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:23,087
We were so optimistic.

1266
00:55:23,187 --> 00:55:26,857
We lost that.
We lost our sense of fun.

1267
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:29,226
Our sense of humor.

1268
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,229
Maybe the pandemic
was a big test.

1269
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,765
And we all failed.

1270
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:37,301
Let's face it, guys.

1271
00:55:37,402 --> 00:55:39,336
We killed Kenny.

1272
00:55:42,607 --> 00:55:44,141
Yeah. Kenny was right.

1273
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:46,911
Back in the old days,
we wouldn't give up like this.

1274
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,813
We would have just set out
to save our friend,

1275
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:50,881
no matter how impossible
it seemed.

1276
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:52,850
What we would have done--

1277
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,485
and what we
should have done then--

1278
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:56,387
was double down on our respect

1279
00:55:56,487 --> 00:55:59,156
and our love for one another
and fight through it

1280
00:55:59,256 --> 00:56:01,592
instead of
fighting with each other.

1281
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,327
We can save Kenny.

1282
00:56:03,428 --> 00:56:05,062
We just have to finish his work.

1283
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:07,665
How? We don't know anything
about quantum physics

1284
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:09,266
and time travel.

1285
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,837
I don't know how.
But we start by believing.

1286
00:56:12,937 --> 00:56:15,773
In each other
and in what is yet to come.

1287
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,309
We have to go back to being
those kids we once were.

1288
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:22,880
Even if it means
calling Jesus or Santa.

1289
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,715
Come on, guys,
we've got work to do!

1290
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:27,652
Sounds good.
I'll be right back.

1291
00:56:29,654 --> 00:56:31,388
Moisha, Hackelm, kids,
get your things.

1292
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:32,490
We need to go now.

1293
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:33,958
What's going on, Dad?

1294
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,160
Your Uncle Kyle wants to
go back and change things.

1295
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,596
He's going to try
and change the past.

1296
00:56:38,696 --> 00:56:41,198
But I like things
the way they are.

1297
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:44,168
Me too, Dad. Do you think
he'll be able to do it?

1298
00:56:44,268 --> 00:56:45,736
No, kids.

1299
00:56:45,836 --> 00:56:47,572
Fuck Uncle Kyle.

1300
00:56:47,672 --> 00:56:48,706
BOTH:
Yay!

1301
00:56:48,806 --> 00:56:50,808
-Yay, Daddy!
-Fuck Uncle Kyle!

1302
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:56,914
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

1303
00:56:57,014 --> 00:57:00,084
People were supposed to
get kinder in the future.

1304
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:03,554
I'm so sorry
what happened to both of you.

1305
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:06,390
It wasn't your fault, Randy.

1306
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:08,759
It was all Stan's fault.

1307
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:12,396
Yes, it was all Stan's fault.

1308
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:15,332
Thanks for saying that,
you guys.

1309
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,868
I'm sorry Stan
sucks so hard sometimes.

1310
00:57:17,968 --> 00:57:20,270
Don't give up, Randy.

1311
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,239
Humanity needs you.

1312
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:23,941
No!

1313
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,176
I can't do it alone!

1314
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,747
How can things possibly go
back to the way they were?

1315
00:57:29,847 --> 00:57:32,082
(wind gusting)

1316
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,361
It can't be.

1317
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,830
It's impossible.

1318
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:52,436
It's the last little
sprout of Tegridy.

1319
00:57:58,442 --> 00:58:00,611
I have to get you
somewhere safe.

1320
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:03,047
We have a lot of work to do.

1321
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:06,050
* *

1322
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:12,823
(footsteps echoing)

1323
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:19,196
(people wailing)

1324
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:22,299
(crazed laughter)

1325
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:28,072
We just had another call asking
to speak with Victor Chouce.

1326
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:31,008
You're quite a popular man,
Victor.

1327
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,114
I wonder what
all the fuss is about.

1328
00:58:40,117 --> 00:58:43,788
Don't feel like talking, huh?
(chuckles)

1329
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:46,123
You will.

1330
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:51,328
* We are all, you and me *

1331
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:55,132
* We are all living
in the future *

1332
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:57,568
* We can't get stuff
'cause boats are late *

1333
00:58:57,668 --> 00:59:01,872
* And nobody's working
in the future *

1334
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:08,145
* They don't sell tostadas
anymore at Taco Bell *

1335
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:10,380
* Welcome to the future *

1336
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:12,917
* In the future *

1337
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:16,854
* We are living in the future *

1338
00:59:17,955 --> 00:59:20,090
* It's the future *

1339
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,260
* We're living in the future. *
