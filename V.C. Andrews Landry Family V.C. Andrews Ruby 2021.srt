00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,138
I was born in the bayou in
the low country in Louisiana,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Official YIFY movies site:
YTS.MX

4
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:10,706
and raised by my Grandmère,
Catherine.

5
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:13,622
Grandmère was a spiritual
healer.

6
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:16,973
Someone unafraid to do
battle with evil.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,714
When Grandmère was summoned
at night

8
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:23,023
it meant someone was
very sick or in pain

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,807
or it meant death.

10
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:29,464
Something evil took my baby.

11
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,379
I- I felt it.

12
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:34,904
I felt the spirit enter the room
when the baby died.

13
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:40,388
When a baby dies before it is
baptized a dark spirit lingers.

14
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:44,000
It's trapped the baby's soul
and we must release it.

15
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:45,132
Ruby?

16
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:47,308
Holy water.

17
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:48,570
Quick.

18
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:51,747
The spirit hides itself
in standing water.

19
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:53,531
We must find it
and wash it away.

20
00:00:56,186 --> 00:00:57,405
Grandmère?

21
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:58,319
Over here.

22
00:00:58,406 --> 00:00:59,233
Water.

23
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:04,760
Je vousez chassez diabolique.

24
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:08,807
Je vousez chassez diabolique.

25
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:11,419
Je vousez chassez diabolique!

26
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:17,425
Be gone, demon!

27
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:24,736
Bury the child.

28
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:26,869
The evil is gone.

29
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,539
Is that for tourists
or for you?

30
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:45,844
It's to sell.

31
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:49,109
Oh, is that Grandpère Jack?

32
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:50,675
Where's his whiskey bottle?

33
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,417
It isn't Jack.

34
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,332
It's my father.

35
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:56,725
He's watching over me.

36
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:58,683
Oh, I don't think
he's that type.

37
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,684
If you only met him that once

38
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:01,599
how do you know
what he's really like?

39
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:03,471
You know I have the sight.

40
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:05,168
That doesn't mean
you see everything.

41
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:06,474
No, I don't.

42
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:11,740
But I do know that Landry women
don't pick good men.

43
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:15,483
You'd do well to remember
that with the boys.

44
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,962
Finish up.

45
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:19,139
You'll be late for school.

46
00:02:20,314 --> 00:02:21,837
Landry!

47
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:24,187
Were you avoiding me at school?

48
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:29,540
So I heard Skeeter Fitch asked
you to the fais dodo dance.

49
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:32,761
He most certainly did.

50
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:35,677
And I'm told you said
you'd think about it.

51
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,809
Did I tell him that?

52
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:40,812
I suppose I might have.

53
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:42,118
Ruby, why would you say that?

54
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:45,817
Because, Paul, so far he's
the only boy who's asked me.

55
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:51,562
We've been going together
for more than a month.

56
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:54,522
I didn't think I would have
to officially ask you.

57
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:58,178
Well, I guess you just learned
something about girls.

58
00:02:58,265 --> 00:02:59,527
And besides, how do I know?

59
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:01,137
Maybe you didn't wanna be seen
in public

60
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:03,357
with a lowly Cajun girl.

61
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:05,141
What would your vague,
rich father say?

62
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,882
Hey, hey, hey.

63
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:16,544
Well, Miss Ruby Landry,

64
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:20,852
would you do me the honour
of being my for real date?

65
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,203
Fine, I'll go with you.

66
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:24,900
Wish me luck.

67
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:26,510
I'm gonna help Grandmère
at her craft stand.

68
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:28,425
I'm putting up some
of my paintings.

69
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:29,905
Maybe I'll sell one.

70
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:32,037
Good luck.

71
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:33,735
I just love your preserves,
Catherine.

72
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,563
Best in the bayou.

73
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:38,870
There you go.
Thank you.

74
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:40,785
Thank you.

75
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,918
I'm going to the dance
with Paul.

76
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,311
Why are you being so difficult,
Grandmère?

77
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:45,442
I'm looking forward to this.

78
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,096
Ruby, don't argue with me.

79
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:50,012
I cannot have you running around
with Paul Tate.

80
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,755
I'm not running around with him,
I'm going to the dance with him.

81
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:55,626
He's a Tate, you're a Landry.

82
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:57,498
Nothing good can come of this.

83
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:59,282
My goodness, Grandmère,
what are we now,

84
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,241
the Hatfields and the McCoys?

85
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,547
You are headed straight
for a heart break.

86
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:04,940
This is ridiculous.

87
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:06,028
He's a perfectly nice boy.

88
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:07,159
Don't argue with me-

89
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:11,120
Are you alright, Grandmère?

90
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:16,256
Welcome.

91
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:18,736
What can I help you with today?

92
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:20,434
These are remarkable.

93
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:21,522
But none of them are signed.

94
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:22,566
Who did this?

95
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:23,828
She did.

96
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:24,916
You?

97
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:25,917
You painted these?

98
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:26,918
Mmmhmm.

99
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:28,964
They're $5 a piece.

100
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,749
I want 'em all.

101
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,229
What's your name?

102
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:36,537
Um... Ruby Landry, sir.

103
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:39,844
You- you really want to buy
every one of my paintings?

104
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:41,237
This is what I'm gonna do
for you.

105
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:45,023
This... is $50.

106
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,243
Now, that's just
a down payment.

107
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,508
My name is Dominique LeGrand.

108
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:53,075
I run an art gallery down
in the French Quarter

109
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:53,989
and I don't believe
that your paintings

110
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:56,905
are gonna be on the wall
for very long.

111
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:58,733
Thank you, sir.

112
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,125
May I?

113
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:01,344
Yes, yes.

114
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:01,953
Of course.

115
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:06,828
Almost there.

116
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,932
He bought every
single painting

117
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:25,803
and said it was only
the start.

118
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,892
It's unreal!

119
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:30,330
So what's next?

120
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:32,419
Move to the city,
forget all about me?

121
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:33,463
No.

122
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,638
You can come with me.

123
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,553
I'll need a chauffeur after all.

124
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,773
Let's go in and celebrate?

125
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,427
Get outta here,
ya damn rummy!

126
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:41,819
Don't come back!

127
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:43,299
Oh, no.

128
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:44,866
I don't know what the heck
you're doing, I paid my bill.

129
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:46,476
Hey, hey, come on,
leave him be!

130
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:47,912
Take your boy home!

131
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:48,565
What do you want?

132
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:49,218
He's asking for it!

133
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:50,306
Grandpère!

134
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:51,438
Jack.

135
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,746
Ruby?

136
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,269
Come on, loan me-
loan me a dollar.

137
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,836
Come on, Jack.

138
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:00,055
Worthless rummy.

139
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:03,493
We're taking you home,
Grandpère.

140
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,234
I'm fine. I can walk
on my own.

141
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:08,237
Alright, almost there.

142
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:10,195
Just a few more steps.

143
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:12,894
There we go.

144
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:16,985
Ok, Jack.

145
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:18,378
You sleep it off.

146
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:27,125
Ruby, forget it.

147
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:29,389
Nothing's gonna get this place
clean, anyway.

148
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:31,521
Thank you for helping me
get him back.

149
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:33,305
I'm sorry you had to get
all caught up in it.

150
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,089
Well, don't worry about it.

151
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:36,526
I am worried about it,
Paul.

152
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:38,876
Word's probably
all over town.

153
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:40,008
Your parents are going
to hear

154
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:42,140
that you muddied your hands
in Landry business.

155
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:43,228
Hey.

156
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:44,229
Those dirt poor swamp folks.

157
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:45,883
Listen.

158
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,363
I don't care.

159
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,235
They can't tell me
not to see you.

160
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:56,241
Ruby... I love you.

161
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:00,594
Are you serious?

162
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:03,945
Am I serious?

163
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:06,295
Is that really your response?

164
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:08,297
I- I mean, I- I don't know
what I was expecting

165
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:09,951
dropping it on you
out of nowhere

166
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,605
but I know what I was hoping
to hear-

167
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:12,867
Paul...

168
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,523
I love you, too.

169
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:21,049
That's better.

170
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,644
What's going on out there?

171
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,302
This is exactly how
I imagined it.

172
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,507
I know what you're going to say
so don't bother.

173
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:33,251
You have got to stop seeing
this boy now.

174
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:36,298
Grandmère, I...

175
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:39,301
I'm in love with him.

176
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:42,391
Oh lord.

177
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:48,310
Ruby, you are not your mother's
first born.

178
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,576
Paul was.

179
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:54,882
Oh, come on.

180
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:57,058
It's true.

181
00:08:57,145 --> 00:09:00,235
Paul's father was
already married

182
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:01,802
when he seduced your mother.

183
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:04,108
I don't know what he told
his wife,

184
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:04,979
how they explained
things away-

185
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:05,980
Stop it!

186
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:07,068
It's true, Ruby.

187
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:08,069
I don't believe you.

188
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:10,680
I wish I hadn't had to tell you,
cherie.

189
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:14,205
Of all the boys in the world
you had to pick Paul Tate

190
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:15,337
to fall in love with,

191
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:17,861
and he just happens to be
your half-brother.

192
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,733
It's not true.

193
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:24,738
It's not true.

194
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:30,831
You're going to have
to tell him goodbye.

195
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,580
Ok, but since when do you care
that I'm from money

196
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,146
and you're not?

197
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:47,108
I just think we need to admit
we're from two different worlds.

198
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:50,285
We should stop it now
before it goes too far.

199
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:55,682
I... I really think I
need to focus on being
an artist right now

200
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,076
and to do that
I need to live more.

201
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:02,471
I can't stay in Houma forever.

202
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:06,823
I need to be open
to more experiences.

203
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,955
Oh.

204
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,044
Ok.

205
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:11,567
Now I get it.

206
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,177
More experiences.

207
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:15,397
In other words more boyfriends,
right?

208
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:16,398
Paul, I'm not saying that.

209
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:18,748
No. No, look.
Everything's clear now.

210
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:22,752
You're a Landry. That's what
I would expect from you.

211
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,408
I know you don't mean
what you're implying.

212
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:27,714
I know you're just trying
to hit me back-

213
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:30,847
No, no. Everything I heard
is true.

214
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:34,808
I didn't wanna believe it
but look, here we are.

215
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:38,550
Hey, and best of luck to you
and your new experiences.

216
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,639
Paul.

217
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,336
Paul!

218
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:52,477
Grandmère!

219
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:53,696
Look!

220
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:55,350
Special delivery from
the Chevalet Gallery.

221
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:56,873
This just arrived.

222
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,834
Someone in New Orleans has one
of my paintings on their wall.

223
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:01,878
Can you believe it?

224
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,318
Grandmère, I don't think
you're getting any better.

225
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:08,537
Let me get a doctor.

226
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:09,625
No doctors.

227
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,018
Just- just listen to me.

228
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:12,672
I think we should take
this money

229
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:15,109
and hide it in my private chest,

230
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,241
'cause if grandpère Jack
gets wind of this

231
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:19,722
he'll come looking.

232
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:24,596
You'll find my bible under
my small jewellery box

233
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,686
on the bottom.

234
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:45,922
Listen to me, Ruby.

235
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:49,056
Now that you know about
your mother and the Tates

236
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,972
I think that you should know
all of it.

237
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:56,716
You'll find a photo in the Book
of Revelation.

238
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:04,027
That's me.

239
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:06,769
That's me when I was
a little girl.

240
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:08,858
But who is this man?

241
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:11,818
His name is Pierre Dumas.

242
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:16,997
Ruby, he's your father.

243
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:20,870
So I knew him once?

244
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:24,787
No, that's not you
in the picture.

245
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:27,921
That's your twin sister.

246
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:32,186
You're old enough now, you
should know the whole story.

247
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:35,015
Your grandpère would sell
anything he could

248
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:39,106
to get himself some whiskey,
including a newborn child.

249
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:42,936
Your father came to the bayou
on a hunting trip.

250
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:47,549
Even though he was already
married he met your mother,
Gabrielle,

251
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:50,770
and fell hopelessly in love.

252
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,554
She got pregnant.

253
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,817
Pierre's wife couldn't
have children

254
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:58,038
but his father wanted his son
to have an heir.

255
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,692
Pierre paid your Grandpa Jack
$1,000

256
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,782
to provide him with one.

257
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:06,742
What none of us knew that
you were still yet to come.

258
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,314
You were born an unexpected
twin, Ruby.

259
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:16,317
It was like my Gabrielle
was determined to give me

260
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:18,710
a granddaughter no matter
what your Grandpère's

261
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,540
devilish plans may be.

262
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:26,153
You were an angel sent straight
from heaven to me, Ruby.

263
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,546
When Jack tried
to snatch you too,

264
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:32,289
I took that pitcher and tried
to cave his head in with it.

265
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:34,944
I told him if he ever set
another step into this house

266
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:39,253
he'd never take another.

267
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,778
My beautiful daughter,
Gabrielle, died

268
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,649
before the sun rose.

269
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:51,178
I have a father.

270
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:54,355
I have a sister.

271
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:03,712
Ruby, get me my powders.

272
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:06,367
The brown- the brown one.

273
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:11,546
This one, grand-?

274
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:54,110
She was an angel if ever one
walked this earth.

275
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:58,332
A dear, dear friend.

276
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:01,117
I'll miss her terribly.

277
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:04,555
Thank you, Mrs. Thibodeau.

278
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:08,603
You know I'm just down
the street if you ever
need anything.

279
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:14,087
She's really gone.

280
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,829
She was just too good
for this world.

281
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,222
I don't need no comfort
from you, woman!

282
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:23,792
Oh, are you gonna speak to me
like that on a day like today?!

283
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,186
Let me make you a plate,
Mrs. Thibodeau.

284
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:28,318
Yes. Thank you, sweet girl.

285
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:30,799
I can handle myself.

286
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:50,514
What happened?

287
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:54,214
Her heart just gave out.

288
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:02,744
Why don't you come
to the table?

289
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:03,919
I'll fix you a plate.

290
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,486
Come on.

291
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:13,189
I swear, I'm gonna dry out.

292
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:14,625
Alright, grandpère.

293
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:19,891
You believe what I'm saying,
don't you, Ruby?

294
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,198
Yes.

295
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:23,504
Come on.

296
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:00,280
Can I come in?

297
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:01,368
Yeah.

298
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:17,079
I saw Jack and his buddies
in the front window.

299
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,428
I didn't know if he'd
let me see you.

300
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:20,822
What are you doing here?

301
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:23,129
Ruby, I feel really rotten

302
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:26,175
about how I talked
to you the other day.

303
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:27,698
I didn't mean any of it.

304
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:30,049
I know you didn't.

305
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:34,401
Look, if you don't wanna
see me anymore

306
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:37,447
I guess I can deal with it.

307
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:42,800
But it would really help me
to understand why.

308
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:46,282
Ruby, you said you loved me.

309
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:47,544
I do.

310
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:50,330
And I don't wanna see
other boys.

311
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,288
I didn't wanna break things off
with you, Paul.

312
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,768
Ok.

313
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,597
Ok, well, then don't do it.

314
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:58,294
I have to.

315
00:17:58,381 --> 00:17:59,208
But why?

316
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,080
If you love me?

317
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,342
Paul...

318
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,086
you're my brother.

319
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,265
-No, it can't.
-It's true.

320
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:14,310
Your father and my mother
were together-

321
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:15,790
Ruby, for god sakes.

322
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,619
If I was going to lie to you,
this is what I'd come up with?

323
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:24,059
No, Ruby, this-
this has to be a joke.

324
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:27,454
Don't you know I wish it was?

325
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,021
Oh, my god.

326
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,981
Everybody kept this secret
for so long.

327
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:36,593
We were never supposed
to know about it.

328
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,727
No one was.

329
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:42,295
Well, that's it.

330
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:44,732
That's the answer.

331
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:47,126
Ruby, no one has to know
about this.

332
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:55,656
Even if that is true,
I don't care.

333
00:18:55,743 --> 00:19:02,315
I love you, and I will never
want anyone else.

334
00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:05,318
Tell me you don't feel
the same way.

335
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:19,593
Ruby, I have to have you.

336
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,920
Who you got in here?!

337
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:44,705
Go. Quick! Go!

338
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:54,845
I shoulda known you had
loose knees just like your ma.

339
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:56,325
You're gonna get yourself
knocked up

340
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:57,935
one of these days, girl.

341
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,155
Yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

342
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:03,027
Another baby to sell?

343
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,644
Now, I don't know what
you think you heard,

344
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:13,560
rumours maybe.

345
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:18,565
Now, you get to sleep and I best
not hear no more noise in here,

346
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,219
or I swear to god...

347
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:54,557
Where'd everybody go?

348
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:57,256
It's the middle of
the afternoon, grandpère.

349
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:03,610
Guess I must have fell asleep.

350
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,748
Damn, if that don't smell good.

351
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:13,097
I'm cooking extra

352
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:17,232
so there should be plenty
you can take home with you.

353
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:20,279
You know who'd like
some of that?

354
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,585
Buster Trayhaw.

355
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:24,021
He's my buddy.

356
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:26,241
He was over here
just last night.

357
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,678
I heard.

358
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:31,159
Oh, he kept talking about you.

359
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:35,468
Ruby this and Ruby that
and Ruby's so pretty,

360
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:39,689
we couldn't shut him up
about you.

361
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:44,085
Point of fact I told Buster
to come on over tonight.

362
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:48,132
Maybe we could talk about the
two of yous getting married.

363
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,440
I'm sorry?

364
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:53,224
Are you insane?

365
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,705
Have you ever been out
to his plantation?

366
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:58,665
He's got more land than
the kingdom of heaven.

367
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:01,145
He could sure take care
of you.

368
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:03,670
You wouldn't want for nothing
the rest of your life.

369
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:07,804
I'm not ready to marry anyone.

370
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:09,023
Do you hear me?

371
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:12,505
Certainly not Buster Trayhaw.

372
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:14,898
I'm going to be an artist.

373
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:16,857
Buster would be fine with that.

374
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,554
All his money may even buy you

375
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:19,947
all the paint and crap
you'd ever want.

376
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:23,472
You listen to me,
you worthless rummy!

377
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:29,173
You don't have a say in this
and I want you out of here!

378
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:31,219
This is my house now,

379
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:33,352
so you go back
to your swamp shack

380
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:36,355
and be retched all by yourself!

381
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:14,001
I'm gonna show you
what happens

382
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:15,959
when you get lippy
with me, girl!

383
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:16,612
I've about had it-

384
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:17,918
Let go!

385
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:19,876
-with the females in this
family telling me what for!

386
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:21,791
No! No, please!

387
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:22,923
I got Buster coming
over here

388
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,707
and we're gonna cut us
a deal.

389
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,274
And that's it!

390
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:28,363
Unlock me, please!

391
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,757
I'm your granddaughter!

392
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:53,127
Buster.

393
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:54,955
Evening, Jack.

394
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:57,436
I brought you a little something
for your pain.

395
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,307
Mighty nice of you.

396
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:01,527
Come on in.
Sit down.

397
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:03,877
Oh, it's hot out...

398
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:05,356
Everything all set?

399
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,401
Talk to her?

400
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,576
I talked to her.

401
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:09,317
She's no problem.

402
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:14,191
But you and me, we haven't fixed
on no price yet.

403
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:15,192
Well, we're both gentlemen,

404
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,933
we'll agree on something
when the time comes.

405
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,676
Buster, the time is now.

406
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,985
And I don't think I can let Ruby
go for anything less than...

407
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:28,292
probably, I'd say, $1,000.

408
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:31,861
Oh, what the hell,
I'll throw you $500 now

409
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:35,386
and the balance on her
and my wedding day?

410
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,520
Come on, Buster, don't get me
angry at you, now.

411
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:40,087
You got the money.

412
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:42,219
I figure a man's got to know
what he's paying for

413
00:24:42,306 --> 00:24:43,873
if he's putting up this kind
of money all at once.

414
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,005
What're you talking?

415
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:46,354
You've seen Ruby before.

416
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:49,052
Seeing is one thing.

417
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:51,707
I will go you one better,
Jack.

418
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:55,885
This on the table is yours,

419
00:24:55,972 --> 00:25:00,890
plus another $500
if I can break her in tonight.

420
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:02,892
Deal.

421
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:05,634
Said bonus money
is to be paid

422
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:09,551
only after the merchandise
has been thoroughly tested.

423
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:30,224
I'm comin' in, Ruby.

424
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:41,583
Jack, you son of a bitch.

425
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,671
Ugh!

426
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:52,899
Buster?

427
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:55,423
Aaargh!!!!!!

428
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,227
Bus to New Orleans, please.

429
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:01,315
One way.

430
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,282
Ooh, look at that.

431
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:14,720
Your daddy is a sharp-looking
man.

432
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:16,460
He sure is.

433
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:19,028
Is he as handsome now
as he was back then?

434
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:21,378
I couldn't say,
I've never met him.

435
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:23,380
You never met your own daddy?

436
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:27,210
I didn't even know he existed
until about a week ago.

437
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:29,691
I have some butterflies about
it, to tell you the truth.

438
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:30,823
Nonsense.

439
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,215
I'm sure they can't wait.

440
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,043
They don't know I'm coming.

441
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,524
They don't know I exist, either.

442
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,918
Oh, honey.

443
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:42,704
I'm gonna give you something to
help take the butterflies away.

444
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,536
This here is the neck bone of
a black cat killed at midnight.

445
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:50,103
The gris-gris.

446
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,452
You know voodoo?

447
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,540
Some.

448
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:54,368
Well, this one's worked on me.

449
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:56,936
My aunt got me a new job
in New Orleans

450
00:27:57,023 --> 00:27:59,982
and now I can finally save up
enough for nursing school.

451
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:02,245
Annie, that's terrific.

452
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,595
Not so much for the cat though.

453
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:07,686
Well, you keep this on you
and you'll be just fine.

454
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:10,732
Oh, I couldn't take
your good luck piece.

455
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:13,213
It's bad luck for me
to take it back now.

456
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,868
Even worse luck for you
to give it.

457
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:21,874
Thank you, Annie.

458
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,063
My god.

459
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:47,421
That's amazing.

460
00:28:49,118 --> 00:28:51,817
You look like you should be
selling flowers

461
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:53,296
on the street corner.

462
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,734
I'm sorry, did I ask
for your opinion?

463
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:57,213
You just surprised me.

464
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,346
All I was expecting
was a Mardi Gras gown.

465
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,870
Not a full-on costume.

466
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,916
Well, you're the one
with the mask.

467
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,961
Hey, Gisselle, I'm impressed.

468
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,049
Keep up the attitude

469
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:09,312
and you're sure to win
first place at the ball.

470
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:10,923
Could you leave me alone,
please?

471
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,880
Come on, let's go inside.

472
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:13,621
Let go of me!

473
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:17,712
Wait a minute.

474
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,583
You know the people
that live here?

475
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,802
Gisselle, stop.

476
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:21,934
My name is Ruby!

477
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:29,985
Oh my god, you must think I'm...
my name is Ruby Landry.

478
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:32,422
I think I know
what's going on.

479
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:46,567
What?

480
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:48,482
It's me.

481
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:50,789
Get lost, Beau.

482
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:53,574
I brought you something.

483
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:57,230
Something shiny?

484
00:29:57,317 --> 00:29:59,319
I'll see you downstairs.

485
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:05,978
Alright, Beau.

486
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:09,024
Where's the big surprise?

487
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:13,202
Gisselle Dumas,
meet Ruby Landry.

488
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:16,249
She's your sister.

489
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:18,860
I don't understand this.

490
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:20,993
Beau, what the hell is
going on?

491
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,690
I...

492
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,000
This is as big of a shock to me
as it is to you.

493
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:28,696
I didn't mean to-

494
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:29,218
No.

495
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:30,350
No, no, no.

496
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:32,221
I don't have a sister.

497
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:35,790
Is this some kind of joke, Beau?

498
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,400
Why did you let this person
in here?

499
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:39,359
Because she's clearly
your twin sister.

500
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:40,839
Look at her.

501
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:45,887
I don't accept this.

502
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,584
This is just a mean prank
you're pulling, Beau,

503
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:48,324
and I'll never forgive you-

504
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:50,674
Gisselle, it's crazy, I know.

505
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:53,895
I was shocked to learn
I had a sister, too.

506
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,549
We were separated at birth-

507
00:30:55,592 --> 00:30:57,159
You shut your mouth!

508
00:30:57,246 --> 00:31:00,989
You're just pulling
some kind of a scheme.

509
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:02,469
She wants money.

510
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:03,687
Don't you get it?

511
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:04,906
Look how she's dressed.

512
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:05,864
Gisselle, for god sakes.

513
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,691
Just get her out of here.

514
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:12,740
I'm sorry.

515
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:13,915
I didn't mean to cause her any-

516
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:15,525
She'll come around.

517
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:18,093
But I think it's time you met
your father.

518
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,920
Don't you?

519
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:19,965
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

520
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:21,270
They're at a party next door.

521
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:22,358
Just wait here.

522
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:25,144
Don't leave me here alone.

523
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:28,190
Ruby, everything's
gonna be fine.

524
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:56,392
It's true.

525
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:03,965
Hello.

526
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:07,882
The butler told me there
was another Gisselle.

527
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:09,275
I'm Ruby.

528
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:10,537
I'm Nina.

529
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,931
I'm the cook.

530
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:15,281
You won't be needing that.

531
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:17,587
I'm not some evil spirit.

532
00:32:17,674 --> 00:32:19,981
So you know what this is?

533
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:22,418
Five-fingered grass?

534
00:32:22,505 --> 00:32:27,293
My grandmother used to use it
to ward off dark forces.

535
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,253
Like I say, I'm harmless.

536
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,168
You're troubled.

537
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:37,216
I've just never seen myself
with a father and mother.

538
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:39,870
Even though I know
that's not me.

539
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,135
No, you're not another Gisselle.

540
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:45,615
I can see it clear now.

541
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:48,531
I can't blame her for the way
she reacted.

542
00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:51,360
I probably would, too,
if I was in her shoes.

543
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:53,797
Don't you worry about Gisselle
and her shoes.

544
00:32:53,884 --> 00:32:55,886
She's go too many

545
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,760
and she'll use every pair
to walk all over you

546
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:01,327
if you let her.

547
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:02,981
Yes. Thank you, Nina.

548
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,852
Good evening, Monsieur Dumas.

549
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:10,684
I'm so sorry to show up
like this without any warning,

550
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:13,687
I- I had to leave my home,
and...

551
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,348
I didn't know.

552
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:31,313
I didn't know.

553
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,013
Your grandfather's name is Jack,
he's a swamp guide.

554
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:41,019
I have two daughters.

555
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:42,020
Two.

556
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:45,501
Daphne, come meet Ruby.

557
00:33:45,588 --> 00:33:47,547
It's my pleasure.

558
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:54,858
I really didn't come here
to cause any trouble,

559
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:56,295
I just hoped I could meet you.

560
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:57,600
Trouble?

561
00:33:57,644 --> 00:34:01,039
My darling, this is a blessing.

562
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:03,780
I... I only mean
I didn't come here

563
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:05,521
with any expectations
to stay here.

564
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:06,827
No, of course not.

565
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:07,828
Of course not?

566
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:09,438
Of course yes!

567
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:11,614
This is as much your home
as it is ours.

568
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:12,833
Darling, don't pressure
the poor girl.

569
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,923
If she doesn't wanna stay
she must feel very awkward.

570
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:20,449
I couldn't send my own daughter
away now that I know she exists.

571
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:23,409
Nina, fetch Edgar, will you?

572
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:27,413
Have him make up a room
for Ruby.

573
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,416
We have so much
to talk about.

574
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:06,974
Oh. I forgot all about you.

575
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:08,889
Good morning.

576
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:11,152
It was.

577
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:13,154
Was the ball nice?

578
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:15,852
Depends on what you call nice.

579
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:18,203
I hear you're a swamp girl.

580
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:20,988
Do they have fancy formals
down there?

581
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:24,209
We've been known to throw
a dance or two.

582
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:26,820
Well, there weren't any banjos
or washboards

583
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:28,952
so I doubt you would have
liked it.

584
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,173
I'm just trying to be nice
to you, Gisselle.

585
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,785
Like it or not we are sisters.

586
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:39,963
Yes, so everyone keeps
telling me.

587
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:42,662
That doesn't make us friends.

588
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:49,190
Good morning, Mr. Dumas.

589
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:51,497
Oh, there she is.

590
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:55,196
Ruby, come sit with me.

591
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,156
"Mr. Dumas", that won't do.

592
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:00,680
I'm your father, aren't I?

593
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:03,378
I'm just getting used to it,
that's all.

594
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:06,816
Oh, well you take all the time
you need.

595
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:09,167
This is your first time
in New Orleans, I take it.

596
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,386
I've never been out
of the bayou.

597
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,867
Well, why don't we make
a day of it?

598
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:14,607
You and me.

599
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:15,738
I'll give you the full tour.

600
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:17,349
Sound good to you?

601
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:20,700
Yes, it sure does, Daddy.

602
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:46,116
Well, what do you think?

603
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,119
Wow.

604
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,252
You know, I really wish
I could have seen

605
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:53,298
you and my mother together.

606
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:56,562
Oh, well, I was only with
Gabrielle, your mother,

607
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:58,955
for a short time.

608
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:03,699
But I have to say, it was
the most marvellous time.

609
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:06,615
Everything was so unexpected
with your mother.

610
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:08,965
My father had taken me
on a hunting trip

611
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:11,751
down to the bayou and there,
suddenly,

612
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:14,580
was this beautiful spirit.

613
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:17,409
That was your mother.

614
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:21,413
I never loved like that before.

615
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:24,546
What do you think of these?

616
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:28,637
Well, they're marvellous,
aren't they?

617
00:37:28,724 --> 00:37:30,378
Let me see.

618
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:35,775
Oh, now this is great.

619
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:41,128
I suppose it reminds you
of home.

620
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:42,782
I know the artist.

621
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:44,436
Oh, you do?

622
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:50,616
Will you look at that.

623
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:53,271
Bravo.

624
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:07,459
So, now that I understand you'll
be staying with us for a while,

625
00:38:07,546 --> 00:38:09,809
I'm hoping in time you'll feel
comfortable addressing me

626
00:38:09,852 --> 00:38:11,767
as "mother".

627
00:38:11,854 --> 00:38:13,813
I hope so, too.

628
00:38:15,728 --> 00:38:17,643
I've come up with a little story

629
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:19,775
to explain your
sudden appearance.

630
00:38:19,862 --> 00:38:21,734
I'd like you to commit it
to memory.

631
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:23,692
People will ask.

632
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:25,607
I couldn't just tell people
the truth?

633
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:26,782
Oh, no, my dear.

634
00:38:26,826 --> 00:38:29,742
The truth of your origin
would put people off.

635
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:33,441
As unfair as it sounds, they
would look at you differently.

636
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:35,748
Less... kindly.

637
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:37,967
As they would the rest
of the family.

638
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:41,275
You see, the Dumas name carries
a power and a responsibility

639
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:45,671
and it is my duty
to protect both.

640
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:49,196
Yes, of course.

641
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:53,331
So, the truth is...

642
00:38:56,246 --> 00:39:01,687
you were kidnapped, when
you were just a few hours old,

643
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:02,949
right out of our nursery.

644
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:08,258
We'll tell people that you were
stolen by Cajuns

645
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:10,217
who sold you to the people
that you've come to know

646
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,828
as your family in the bayou.

647
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:18,617
But by the grace of God
you've been returned to us.

648
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:24,753
We kept our search and our
tragedy private until today.

649
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:27,408
Understood?

650
00:39:27,495 --> 00:39:33,936
I don't know how comfortable I
am telling people such a story.

651
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,025
Well, you don't have
to say anything

652
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:37,505
other than you'd rather
not talk about it.

653
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:40,595
But this simply is what
the story will be.

654
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,684
I've spoken to Pierre
and he agrees.

655
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:46,166
I could never say a bad word
about my Grandmère.

656
00:39:46,253 --> 00:39:47,385
Well.

657
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:53,608
As I said... if you can't say
anything bad

658
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:57,133
then just don't say anything
at all.

659
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,266
In any case, the first thing
we need to do

660
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:02,051
is make you look like
a Dumas.

661
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:12,758
Thank you so much.

662
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:17,763
I guess it's Christmas.

663
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:20,113
Wow.

664
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,812
You're gonna have to let me
borrow this whenever I want.

665
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:26,641
You can borrow anything here.

666
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:28,426
Thanks.

667
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:32,865
Listen, I want to apologize
for being such a snit.

668
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:33,909
Oh, no-

669
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:35,345
You have to understand
this whole thing

670
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:37,696
has been a big shock for me,
you coming out of nowhere,

671
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:41,134
but Daddy has explained the
whole horrible thing to me.

672
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:43,005
I would have just killed myself
if I had to grow up

673
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:46,313
in a swamp full of kidnappers
and poor beggars.

674
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:47,836
It wasn't all bad.

675
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,665
But I think it's gonna be fun
having a twin sister, don't you?

676
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:53,059
I'm so glad to hear you
say that, Gisselle.

677
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:55,148
Really.

678
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:56,932
We missed the chance
to grow up together.

679
00:40:57,019 --> 00:41:00,893
Well, I can help you figure
out what goes with what.

680
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,634
It's not your fault
that you don't know

681
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:05,985
anything about fashion.

682
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:07,943
The boys are gonna love you
in this.

683
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:12,034
I have something similar and
they just die when I wear it.

684
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:13,471
I'll bet Beau gets jealous.

685
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:15,995
Oh, they all get jealous.

686
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:17,518
I like Beau.

687
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:19,738
I think he seems very sweet.

688
00:41:19,825 --> 00:41:21,348
Hmm, he's alright, I guess.

689
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:23,350
He's just one among dozens.

690
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:25,221
But I'm sure you've been
with tons of guys.

691
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:27,876
I've read all about you
Cajun girls.

692
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,704
I don't know what you've heard.

693
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:32,446
I've really only ever had
one boyfriend my whole life.

694
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:33,621
Oh yeah? Who?

695
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:34,796
Your brother?

696
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:38,321
Anyway, I'll introduce
you around,

697
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:41,194
make sure you know who is
worth dating and who isn't,

698
00:41:41,281 --> 00:41:44,893
but first we've got a little
work to do.

699
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,286
This is it.

700
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:49,071
This is the one.

701
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:51,639
I think it'll look better on me,
though.

702
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:52,684
Yeah.

703
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,524
Alright, now blot like
I showed you.

704
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:08,787
Perfect.

705
00:42:08,874 --> 00:42:10,702
You could almost pass for me.

706
00:42:10,745 --> 00:42:12,965
No one would believe
I'm that nice.

707
00:42:13,052 --> 00:42:14,749
Har har.

708
00:42:14,793 --> 00:42:15,968
No thanks.

709
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:17,404
Square.

710
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:22,409
Oh, my god, I just had
a great idea.

711
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:23,584
Let's trade.

712
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:24,629
Trade what?

713
00:42:24,672 --> 00:42:26,282
Trade each other when the boys
get here.

714
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:28,589
You pretend to be me
and I'll pretend to be you.

715
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:29,590
Fool them.

716
00:42:29,634 --> 00:42:30,939
I don't think so, Gisselle.

717
00:42:30,983 --> 00:42:32,767
Hi, y'all, my name's Ruby.

718
00:42:32,854 --> 00:42:34,813
My pet skunk's named Petey.

719
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:37,903
No one on planet Earth
talks like that, Gisselle.

720
00:42:37,946 --> 00:42:39,208
And this is a dumb idea.

721
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:40,775
Oh, don't be such a simp.

722
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:41,863
It'll be a scream.

723
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,038
Gisselle, please.

724
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:46,259
Nothing but bad can come
from a trick like that.

725
00:42:46,346 --> 00:42:50,089
Well, I guess we're gonna
have to see.

726
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:04,277
Why, hello, boys.

727
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:09,369
Beau, so nice to see you again.

728
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:13,199
And you, you handsome thing,
you must be Martin.

729
00:43:13,286 --> 00:43:15,549
I'm Gisselle's sister, Ruby.

730
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:17,595
Nice meeting you.

731
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:20,119
Wow, you two really
do look alike.

732
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:21,860
It's spooky.

733
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:23,557
Well, you might not have
thought so

734
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:26,821
when I first showed up
in my raggy swamp clothes.

735
00:43:26,865 --> 00:43:29,302
I was just a little, old,
filthy, dirty sight,

736
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:30,825
wasn't I, Gisselle?

737
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:33,611
Well, you're about as far from
that as you can get tonight.

738
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:36,788
I don't know if this town can
handle this much good-looking.

739
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:40,095
Oh, he's every bit as charming
as you said he was, Gisselle.

740
00:43:40,182 --> 00:43:43,229
I could just eat him up like
a plate of fried possum.

741
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:49,017
Just look at the pearly whites
on you.

742
00:43:49,104 --> 00:43:51,106
We swamp girls aren't used
to boys having

743
00:43:51,193 --> 00:43:53,282
so many teeth left
in their heads.

744
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:55,937
Well, I've still got all
the parts god gave me,

745
00:43:56,024 --> 00:43:57,243
and then some.

746
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,246
Let's go into the living room

747
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:02,988
and leave these two
love birds alone.

748
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,387
Gisselle, I've never seen you
looking prettier

749
00:44:11,474 --> 00:44:13,085
than you do right now.

750
00:44:13,172 --> 00:44:14,564
Thank you, Beau.

751
00:44:14,608 --> 00:44:16,349
I guess anyone standing
next to Ruby

752
00:44:16,436 --> 00:44:18,873
is going to look at least
a little nicer.

753
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,701
Oh, I'm sorry, was that mean?

754
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:22,398
You know, Gisselle,

755
00:44:22,442 --> 00:44:25,663
I've been just burning to be
alone with you all day.

756
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,664
Oh?

757
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,449
Come here, beautiful.

758
00:44:29,536 --> 00:44:30,668
Alright, Beau.

759
00:44:30,755 --> 00:44:32,452
You know I'm not Gisselle.

760
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:33,409
Ruby?

761
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:34,541
Cut it out.

762
00:44:34,628 --> 00:44:36,021
The whole thing was her idea.

763
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:38,327
How stupid does she think I am?

764
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:40,460
Martin seems fooled.

765
00:44:40,547 --> 00:44:43,071
She never knows when
she's gone too far.

766
00:44:43,115 --> 00:44:45,030
Listen, since you went along
with this,

767
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:48,033
you're gonna help me
get back at her.

768
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:01,220
What- I don't think I get
the plan.

769
00:45:01,263 --> 00:45:03,483
She can't even see us in here.

770
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,876
That's the plan.

771
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:06,834
She has no idea what
we're doing in here

772
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:09,489
and Gisselle has a dirty
imagination.

773
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:14,363
Sorry for kissing you
like that.

774
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:17,845
Without asking, I mean.

775
00:45:17,932 --> 00:45:19,499
I pranked you.

776
00:45:19,586 --> 00:45:22,415
I had it coming.

777
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:25,940
What if I were to try it again?

778
00:45:25,984 --> 00:45:29,901
I suppose I'd have to slap
your face.

779
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:40,738
Slap.

780
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:48,833
Wait a sec!

781
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,617
Where are those two?

782
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:57,580
You get out here right now,
Beau Andreas!

783
00:45:57,624 --> 00:45:59,713
Yes, Ruby Landry from the bayou?

784
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,975
May we help you?

785
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:01,715
Alright, cut it out.

786
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:04,065
You know damn well who's who.

787
00:46:08,026 --> 00:46:10,506
You're the only gentleman
I know, Martin.

788
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,813
Uh, what the hell
is going on here?

789
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:20,647
Oh god. Oh, my...

790
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:33,225
Maybe don't drink the whole
bottle next time, Gisselle?

791
00:46:33,312 --> 00:46:34,661
Just leave me alone.

792
00:46:34,748 --> 00:46:36,315
I'll be alright.

793
00:46:36,402 --> 00:46:38,883
And don't you get any ideas
about Beau.

794
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:42,800
He'll never be interested
in a swamp girl, anyway.

795
00:46:58,511 --> 00:47:00,121
Hello?

796
00:47:18,923 --> 00:47:20,446
Oh.

797
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:22,578
Does this stuff really work?

798
00:47:22,622 --> 00:47:25,668
Gisselle is about as hung over
as I've seen,

799
00:47:25,755 --> 00:47:27,714
and I have seen hung over.

800
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:30,151
It works every time.

801
00:47:30,238 --> 00:47:32,980
I learned this skill from
Mama Dede herself.

802
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:34,155
Oh, your mother?

803
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:35,591
Not my mother.

804
00:47:35,678 --> 00:47:38,638
Mama Dede, voodoo queen.

805
00:47:38,725 --> 00:47:40,858
She got a cure for everything.

806
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:41,728
Hmm.

807
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:42,903
Terrific.

808
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,731
I'll go see her next time
my skin breaks out.

809
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:46,602
Oh, you do not wanna see
Mama Dede

810
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:49,301
unless you got big troubles.

811
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:55,394
Even then, the price may be
more than the money you pay.

812
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:57,570
How's Gisselle been treating
you, cherie?

813
00:47:57,613 --> 00:47:58,701
Better?

814
00:47:58,788 --> 00:48:00,486
Well, no.

815
00:48:00,573 --> 00:48:02,531
Worse, I guess.

816
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:03,968
Hmm.

817
00:48:04,011 --> 00:48:06,666
Maybe we give her another
half hour to feel the evils

818
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:08,842
of too much drink, yes?

819
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:11,801
Might help her make better
choices in the future.

820
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:15,762
And I know you only want
to help your sweet sister,

821
00:48:15,805 --> 00:48:18,199
even though it might hurt some.

822
00:48:31,996 --> 00:48:33,127
What the hell is that?

823
00:48:33,214 --> 00:48:35,956
Nina says it'll take the gongs
out of your head.

824
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,784
Drink it.

825
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:44,312
Ugh.

826
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:45,661
It tastes like pig snot.

827
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:48,795
Nina swears it works
in seconds.

828
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,324
Huh.

829
00:48:56,411 --> 00:48:57,760
That's crazy.

830
00:48:57,847 --> 00:48:59,806
Here's to voodoo.

831
00:49:03,288 --> 00:49:04,811
Hey, can I ask you something?

832
00:49:04,854 --> 00:49:05,812
Mmmhmm.

833
00:49:07,553 --> 00:49:10,469
Last night I thought I heard
someone crying

834
00:49:10,512 --> 00:49:12,514
in the bedroom two doors down?

835
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:15,343
Oh yeah, you'll hear that
every once in a while.

836
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:17,345
That's Uncle Jean's old room.

837
00:49:17,432 --> 00:49:19,565
Wha- Uncle Jean?

838
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:20,958
Daddy's younger brother.

839
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,829
He was in an accident
forever ago

840
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:24,483
and Daddy sometimes
goes in there

841
00:49:24,526 --> 00:49:26,224
and cries his little eyes out.

842
00:49:26,311 --> 00:49:27,921
It's so embarrassing.

843
00:49:28,008 --> 00:49:29,140
So do me a favour

844
00:49:29,227 --> 00:49:31,751
and keep your trap shut about it
to people, huh?

845
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:32,665
He died?

846
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:34,014
No, worse.

847
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:35,320
He got brain damage

848
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:37,844
so they stuck him in one
of those hospitals for kooks.

849
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:39,933
Daddy makes me visit him
once a year.

850
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,717
It's just awful.

851
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:45,069
You think Daddy would let me
go see him?

852
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:47,114
Cripes, I guess he would
if you wanted to.

853
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:48,681
Why would you?

854
00:49:48,724 --> 00:49:51,510
Because he's family, Gisselle.

855
00:49:51,597 --> 00:49:52,641
Does he speak?

856
00:49:52,685 --> 00:49:54,339
No, he's a vegetable.

857
00:49:54,426 --> 00:49:55,862
But he's still quite
good-looking

858
00:49:55,905 --> 00:49:57,081
and keeps himself together.

859
00:49:57,168 --> 00:49:58,821
Best dressed loony in the bin.

860
00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:00,519
Anyway, it's Saturday.

861
00:50:00,562 --> 00:50:02,173
I'm calling the boys.

862
00:50:16,622 --> 00:50:18,189
Why are we stopping here?

863
00:50:18,276 --> 00:50:19,407
Martin's got a connection.

864
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:20,974
He's gonna get us some reefer.

865
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:22,541
Be right back.

866
00:50:33,204 --> 00:50:34,031
Ruby?

867
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:37,643
It's me, Annie.

868
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:38,600
Remember?

869
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:39,514
Yes!

870
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:40,646
Hi.

871
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:42,865
I cannot believe I ran into you.

872
00:50:42,952 --> 00:50:45,216
I thought you said you were here
visiting your aunt?

873
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:46,521
Yeah, I work with her.

874
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:47,914
Right over there.

875
00:50:49,437 --> 00:50:51,613
How did everything come up
with your daddy?

876
00:50:51,657 --> 00:50:54,051
Uh, great, thanks.

877
00:50:54,138 --> 00:50:56,749
My gris-gris worked,
didn't it?

878
00:51:01,188 --> 00:51:02,537
I gotta go.

879
00:51:02,624 --> 00:51:05,410
Nursing school don't pay
for itself.

880
00:51:06,585 --> 00:51:08,282
You come see me again,
huh?

881
00:51:08,326 --> 00:51:09,240
Ah, ok.

882
00:51:19,685 --> 00:51:21,513
I only met her that one time
on the bus.

883
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,254
I had no idea.

884
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:27,780
Oh my god.

885
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:31,914
Ruby's friends
with a prostitute.

886
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:37,137
Ruby, I think you better be
real nice to me.

887
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:41,272
It would be a real shame
if this got out.

888
00:51:47,756 --> 00:51:49,280
Oh, my god.

889
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:51,020
It's Ruby, right?

890
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,935
Y'all are gonna have to start
wearing name tags.

891
00:51:53,022 --> 00:51:55,112
I can't tell one
from the other.

892
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:58,985
Did you really get kidnapped
when you were a baby?

893
00:51:59,028 --> 00:52:01,335
You have got to be so brave.

894
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:04,033
After everything that happened.

895
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,861
I'd really rather not talk
about that.

896
00:52:05,905 --> 00:52:07,646
Don't worry about your starting
school late.

897
00:52:07,689 --> 00:52:10,127
I can help you get caught up.

898
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,304
What're you doing after school?

899
00:52:24,053 --> 00:52:27,535
Hi, I'm looking
for Miss Popularity?

900
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:29,537
She's over there in the mirror.

901
00:52:29,581 --> 00:52:31,191
She used to be.

902
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:33,062
Not anymore.

903
00:52:33,106 --> 00:52:36,501
Gisselle, you're not really
threatened by me.

904
00:52:36,544 --> 00:52:39,112
I'm just this week's sideshow.

905
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:40,200
I don't know.

906
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:42,202
Claudine Simpkins asked me
to invite you

907
00:52:42,289 --> 00:52:43,769
to her slumber party
on Friday.

908
00:52:43,856 --> 00:52:44,813
Really?

909
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,033
Mmmhmm.

910
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,817
I've never been
to a slumber party.

911
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:50,819
Oh, they're real fun.

912
00:52:50,906 --> 00:52:51,994
We talk about the boys,

913
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:56,477
do each other's makeup,
eat lots of bad stuff.

914
00:52:56,564 --> 00:52:58,175
You should come.

915
00:52:58,262 --> 00:53:03,745
Besides, it'd be a fun thing
to do as sisters.

916
00:53:03,832 --> 00:53:04,746
Ok.

917
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:05,791
Great.

918
00:53:05,878 --> 00:53:06,922
I'll tell her.

919
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:09,011
Claudine's parties are always
a good time

920
00:53:09,098 --> 00:53:12,058
and she always cooks up
some fun surprise.

921
00:53:23,461 --> 00:53:24,418
What do you think, ladies?

922
00:53:24,462 --> 00:53:27,029
Will this drive Steve wild
with desire?

923
00:53:27,073 --> 00:53:28,466
Maybe if that's all you wear.

924
00:53:30,032 --> 00:53:30,903
Where did you dig those up?

925
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:32,905
They're my grandmother's
old clothes.

926
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:33,949
In the trunk.

927
00:53:33,993 --> 00:53:37,039
Well, you realize what
we have to do.

928
00:53:37,126 --> 00:53:39,085
Old-timey fashion show.

929
00:53:39,172 --> 00:53:42,088
We'll each pick something out,
walk the runway,

930
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:43,002
and vote.

931
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:44,221
Loser has to sleep
in the garage.

932
00:53:45,526 --> 00:53:46,397
Hmm.

933
00:53:48,921 --> 00:53:50,662
Oh!

934
00:53:50,749 --> 00:53:53,578
Ruby, this is so you.

935
00:53:53,665 --> 00:53:54,579
What do you think, girls?

936
00:53:54,622 --> 00:53:56,363
Mmmhmm.

937
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:57,886
You go first.

938
00:53:57,973 --> 00:54:00,062
-Oh.
-Go into the bathroom
and change.

939
00:54:00,149 --> 00:54:02,761
Give a knock when you're ready
to come out.

940
00:54:02,804 --> 00:54:05,111
Careful you don't show
too much ankle, now.

941
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,877
This was your idea, wasn't it?

942
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:33,574
Oh, don't be such a spoil sport.

943
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:34,749
It's just a goof.

944
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:36,838
If it's so funny why don't you
strip down naked

945
00:54:36,925 --> 00:54:38,144
in front of the boys?

946
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:40,146
I'm not that stupid.

947
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:43,323
Oh, Ruby.

948
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:46,152
What, are you leaving now
because of this?

949
00:55:02,864 --> 00:55:05,345
Hi.

950
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:07,304
Hi, Beau.

951
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:08,783
Didn't the butler tell you

952
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,611
Gisselle's off at
a slumber party?

953
00:55:10,698 --> 00:55:12,961
Yeah, I had forgotten
about that.

954
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:14,093
He said you were here.

955
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,747
Why didn't you go?

956
00:55:15,834 --> 00:55:16,835
I did.

957
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,751
What's wrong?

958
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:21,622
Nothing.

959
00:55:21,709 --> 00:55:23,320
Just... Gisselle.

960
00:55:26,888 --> 00:55:29,891
I got to be the brunt of
one of her mean jokes.

961
00:55:29,978 --> 00:55:32,851
I told you, she doesn't know
what "too far" is.

962
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:34,853
She knows what it is.

963
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:36,463
She just doesn't care.

964
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:39,553
You're right.

965
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:42,513
Why do you like her?

966
00:55:42,556 --> 00:55:45,080
I guess I don't really like her.

967
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:46,821
You go out with her.

968
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:52,697
Look, she's beautiful
and she can be a lot of fun.

969
00:55:52,784 --> 00:55:56,918
But no, she's not nice.

970
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:59,007
You're nice.

971
00:56:04,883 --> 00:56:07,973
You're nice, too.

972
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:12,107
So why aren't we going out?

973
00:56:12,194 --> 00:56:16,155
I... I don't think that would be
so simple.

974
00:56:16,242 --> 00:56:17,504
Why not?

975
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:19,245
You have some guy
in the bayou?

976
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:21,116
Well, no.

977
00:56:21,203 --> 00:56:24,990
I- I mean, there was someone,
but we've already...

978
00:56:25,077 --> 00:56:26,818
I've put that behind me.

979
00:56:26,905 --> 00:56:27,906
Perfect.

980
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:30,778
What else?

981
00:56:30,865 --> 00:56:38,438
Well, I am not the type of girl
to steal her sister's boyfriend.

982
00:56:38,525 --> 00:56:43,182
Ok, what if... I wasn't
her boyfriend?

983
00:56:44,662 --> 00:56:46,490
Look, I'm nothing special
to Gisselle.

984
00:56:46,577 --> 00:56:48,927
To her I'm just an adornment.

985
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:50,232
One among dozens.

986
00:56:50,276 --> 00:56:52,321
Exactly.

987
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,062
And I really like you.

988
00:56:54,149 --> 00:56:57,152
And you really like me.

989
00:56:57,239 --> 00:57:00,329
The only thing stopping us
is Gisselle,

990
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,680
who doesn't like anyone.

991
00:57:06,684 --> 00:57:07,728
Hmm.

992
00:57:22,395 --> 00:57:25,093
So the date wasn't a fail,
right?

993
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:28,575
That's gotta be the fanciest
place I've ever been.

994
00:57:28,662 --> 00:57:30,577
Only the best.

995
00:57:30,664 --> 00:57:31,883
So the date so far,
how do I rate?

996
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:32,884
An A?

997
00:57:32,971 --> 00:57:34,451
A B plus?

998
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:37,628
I can't grade you in the middle
of a test.

999
00:57:37,671 --> 00:57:38,977
Alright.

1000
00:57:39,064 --> 00:57:39,760
Multiple choice.

1001
00:57:39,847 --> 00:57:40,805
Oh.

1002
00:57:40,892 --> 00:57:45,287
We hold hands
in the moonlight.

1003
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:47,594
Shadow puppets
in the headlights.

1004
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:54,122
I kiss you.

1005
00:57:54,209 --> 00:57:58,387
Maybe you kiss me back.

1006
00:58:16,797 --> 00:58:22,586
Ok, um, I think we should
slow down, huh?

1007
00:58:22,629 --> 00:58:25,023
We're just going
a little too fast here.

1008
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:28,679
But Ruby, I'm crazy
about you.

1009
00:58:28,766 --> 00:58:31,203
And you said you liked me.

1010
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:32,204
Now, Beau, what makes
you think

1011
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,511
that kind of talk's gonna
work on me?

1012
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:35,555
What do you mean?

1013
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:36,991
I'm not some dumb Cajun girl

1014
00:58:37,078 --> 00:58:40,691
who gets on her back just 'cause
she's fed a little sweet talk.

1015
00:58:40,778 --> 00:58:41,866
Ok.

1016
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:43,868
So sweet talk's a no.

1017
00:58:43,955 --> 00:58:45,565
Is serenading worth a try?

1018
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:48,220
Beau, I'm serious.

1019
00:58:48,263 --> 00:58:51,136
I know, I'm sorry.

1020
00:58:51,223 --> 00:58:55,009
But the driving me crazy part
wasn't sweet talk.

1021
00:58:55,096 --> 00:58:58,056
That part's true.

1022
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:02,016
So B, shadow puppets.

1023
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:05,672
Yeah.

1024
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:07,892
Yeah?

1025
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:22,689
Something wrong?

1026
00:59:22,776 --> 00:59:24,430
I should say so.

1027
00:59:24,473 --> 00:59:26,127
I understand you
introduced Gisselle

1028
00:59:26,214 --> 00:59:28,434
to some special friend of yours
the other day?

1029
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:31,785
Some prostitute down
in Storyville?

1030
00:59:31,829 --> 00:59:33,221
Is that what you told them?

1031
00:59:33,308 --> 00:59:36,224
How do you know this whore,
Ruby?

1032
00:59:36,311 --> 00:59:38,009
I don't know her.

1033
00:59:38,096 --> 00:59:39,227
Of course not.

1034
00:59:39,314 --> 00:59:40,664
She just knew your name

1035
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:43,492
and what brought you to New
Orleans like a total stranger.

1036
00:59:43,536 --> 00:59:46,626
A bus brought me to New Orleans
and she was sitting next to me.

1037
00:59:46,713 --> 00:59:48,585
That's the entire story
and you know it.

1038
00:59:48,628 --> 00:59:50,761
So why are you lying?

1039
00:59:50,804 --> 00:59:53,590
All I did was say what happened.

1040
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:56,810
Is this because Beau
wants me now and not you?

1041
00:59:56,854 --> 00:59:58,899
Because this isn't going
to change that.

1042
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:03,121
If Beau wants you

1043
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:07,212
it's clearly because he thinks
swamp girls are easy.

1044
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:10,041
Girls, cut it out.

1045
01:00:10,084 --> 01:00:14,654
I think Ruby's story sounds
perfectly believable to me.

1046
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:16,308
I knew you'd take her side!

1047
01:00:16,395 --> 01:00:18,179
This is all people are gonna
talk about.

1048
01:00:18,223 --> 01:00:21,661
How our family now consorts
with prostitutes.

1049
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:22,357
Oh, darling.

1050
01:00:22,444 --> 01:00:24,098
It isn't as bad as all that.

1051
01:00:24,185 --> 01:00:25,534
Gisselle's right.

1052
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,494
You do always side with Ruby.

1053
01:00:28,537 --> 01:00:29,930
Well, I have my limits, Pierre.

1054
01:00:29,974 --> 01:00:32,933
We never had any kind of trouble
like this before she arrived.

1055
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:36,371
Another scandal and one of us
is going to have to leave.

1056
01:00:36,415 --> 01:00:37,634
I think it would be a good idea

1057
01:00:37,721 --> 01:00:40,506
if we picked this up
in the morning.

1058
01:00:55,913 --> 01:00:58,393
I hope you and Beau had
a lovely time.

1059
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,830
You guys are great together.

1060
01:00:59,873 --> 01:01:01,353
You happy now, Gisselle?

1061
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:06,532
No, not yet.
Maybe soon though.

1062
01:01:18,587 --> 01:01:20,067
Hey.

1063
01:01:20,111 --> 01:01:21,678
Come on in.

1064
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:24,376
Isn't this great?

1065
01:01:24,463 --> 01:01:27,205
Daddy turned this whole room
into an art studio for me.

1066
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:29,598
Very nice.

1067
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,731
You ever paint anything other
than the bayou?

1068
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,950
Of course.

1069
01:01:33,037 --> 01:01:35,126
I'm just... I'm just a little
homesick, I guess,

1070
01:01:35,213 --> 01:01:37,432
and the bayou is beautiful.

1071
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:42,524
Well, I think if you wanna paint
real beauty you gotta paint me.

1072
01:01:42,611 --> 01:01:45,614
I don't think I have enough
paint for your big head.

1073
01:01:45,658 --> 01:01:47,921
You're a big, famous
gallery artist.

1074
01:01:48,008 --> 01:01:49,793
Woah, what do you think
you're doing?

1075
01:01:49,836 --> 01:01:51,751
Haven't you ever painted
a reclining nude?

1076
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:54,145
Beau, no.

1077
01:01:54,232 --> 01:01:56,713
Beau, put it back on.

1078
01:01:58,845 --> 01:02:02,675
Oh my god, Beau, if you take
those pants off...

1079
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:07,941
Don't let perfection
frighten you, Ruby.

1080
01:02:07,985 --> 01:02:10,030
Now, tell me this isn't art.

1081
01:02:13,512 --> 01:02:14,556
Ok.

1082
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:24,958
I have packages in the car.

1083
01:02:25,002 --> 01:02:26,481
Get them for me, would you?

1084
01:02:26,568 --> 01:02:28,092
Drop 'em, nature boy.

1085
01:02:45,979 --> 01:02:48,199
Ruby, why is this door locked?

1086
01:02:48,286 --> 01:02:49,287
Hurry!

1087
01:02:49,896 --> 01:02:51,855
Oh, uh, is it?

1088
01:02:51,898 --> 01:02:53,595
I don't abide locked doors
in this house.

1089
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:55,423
Open it immediately.

1090
01:02:55,510 --> 01:03:01,125
Just a second, my um...
my easel is stuck.

1091
01:03:01,995 --> 01:03:02,953
Ruby!

1092
01:03:09,263 --> 01:03:10,308
Beau.

1093
01:03:11,352 --> 01:03:12,745
I didn't know you were here.

1094
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:14,703
Yeah, well, just keeping
Ruby busy

1095
01:03:14,747 --> 01:03:16,575
while she paints her
boring landscapes.

1096
01:03:20,753 --> 01:03:23,147
You leave this door open.

1097
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:30,284
I will kill you.

1098
01:03:50,435 --> 01:03:51,915
Is there something
I can help you with?

1099
01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:54,352
Hey Ruby, you look
a little cold.

1100
01:03:54,439 --> 01:03:56,702
Your epidermis is showing.

1101
01:04:00,749 --> 01:04:04,188
Make sure you tell everyone
it's my sister and not me.

1102
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:06,233
And you think Cajuns are scum?

1103
01:04:06,277 --> 01:04:07,713
You animals!

1104
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:17,549
I heard what happened
and I cannot believe it.

1105
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:18,855
Neither can I.

1106
01:04:18,898 --> 01:04:20,073
I didn't think it was possible

1107
01:04:20,117 --> 01:04:22,249
but somehow you have managed

1108
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:24,295
to disgrace the Dumas family
name even further.

1109
01:04:24,382 --> 01:04:26,123
I've disgraced the family name?

1110
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:30,867
Were you drunk when you let them
take those pictures of you?

1111
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:33,347
Yes, that's exactly
how it happened.

1112
01:04:33,434 --> 01:04:35,959
I- I actually wanted
to go further

1113
01:04:36,002 --> 01:04:39,223
but thankfully Gisselle was
there to come to my rescue.

1114
01:04:39,266 --> 01:04:41,225
I suppose that's the story
you've been told,

1115
01:04:41,312 --> 01:04:43,270
or something close to it.

1116
01:04:43,357 --> 01:04:45,490
I haven't spoken to Gisselle
about this,

1117
01:04:45,577 --> 01:04:47,274
but I just got off the phone

1118
01:04:47,361 --> 01:04:49,624
with Beau's mother
who is beside herself.

1119
01:04:49,668 --> 01:04:50,756
As of now you will not leave
this house

1120
01:04:50,843 --> 01:04:54,325
for any reason other than school
until further notice.

1121
01:04:54,412 --> 01:04:55,892
Understood?

1122
01:04:56,805 --> 01:04:58,068
Yes, ma'am.

1123
01:05:09,818 --> 01:05:12,169
What is it now?

1124
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:15,955
Sometimes the bad people
get what's coming to 'em.

1125
01:05:16,042 --> 01:05:19,916
It's not my experience,
Nina.

1126
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:23,093
It can be if you want it
bad enough.

1127
01:05:23,136 --> 01:05:25,791
But you got to want it
bad enough.

1128
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:27,619
Want what?

1129
01:05:27,706 --> 01:05:31,101
People like Gisselle to get
hers, yeah?

1130
01:05:31,188 --> 01:05:34,060
That would be nice but...

1131
01:05:34,147 --> 01:05:37,107
it doesn't usually seem to work
that way though, does it?

1132
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:42,068
You come with me, child.

1133
01:06:14,231 --> 01:06:16,494
I should never have agreed
to come.

1134
01:06:16,537 --> 01:06:18,670
It's gonna be alright.

1135
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,501
Sit.

1136
01:06:32,597 --> 01:06:36,993
Ruby, tell Mama Dede
your troubles.

1137
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:42,868
I have a sister.

1138
01:06:42,955 --> 01:06:44,217
A twin sister.

1139
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:45,871
Ah, lamarasa.

1140
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:52,878
For some reason she just seems
to hate me.

1141
01:06:52,965 --> 01:06:57,100
No matter how hard I try to...

1142
01:06:57,187 --> 01:07:01,321
I just want her to stop
hurting me.

1143
01:07:01,408 --> 01:07:04,716
You brought me an item
that belongs to your sister.

1144
01:08:15,526 --> 01:08:17,615
Remove the item.

1145
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,804
I cannot remove it for you.

1146
01:08:36,982 --> 01:08:43,815
Trust me, and all your
difficulties will soon end.

1147
01:09:01,528 --> 01:09:02,616
Good.

1148
01:09:04,923 --> 01:09:08,187
The spell be very strong now.

1149
01:09:08,274 --> 01:09:10,450
Very strong.

1150
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:25,596
Thank you.

1151
01:09:25,683 --> 01:09:30,035
What was done here tonight
was done by you, not me.

1152
01:09:30,078 --> 01:09:32,429
If things turn out
the way you want,

1153
01:09:32,516 --> 01:09:34,170
you deserve the things.

1154
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:45,181
And if they don't...
you deserve the blame.

1155
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:51,535
Come now.

1156
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:00,239
Hey.

1157
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:01,545
Careful, Beau.

1158
01:10:01,632 --> 01:10:03,242
You're not supposed to have
anything to do with me.

1159
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:04,548
So I heard.

1160
01:10:04,635 --> 01:10:07,812
Maybe we should just be smart
and lay low for a while.

1161
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:09,030
Hop in, guys.

1162
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:11,076
We'll give you a ride.

1163
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:12,382
Go to hell.

1164
01:10:12,425 --> 01:10:15,602
Ugh, Ruby you're such a bore.

1165
01:10:15,646 --> 01:10:18,083
This whole thing will go away
in a few days

1166
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:19,780
and everything goes back
to normal.

1167
01:10:19,824 --> 01:10:21,782
So come on, get in.

1168
01:10:21,869 --> 01:10:23,219
Martin's got some good stuff.

1169
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:24,742
We're going back
to his house.

1170
01:10:24,829 --> 01:10:26,396
Don't wave that around,
Gisselle.

1171
01:10:26,483 --> 01:10:28,441
Look, you know I don't smoke
that stuff,

1172
01:10:28,485 --> 01:10:29,442
and you've gotta be dreaming

1173
01:10:29,486 --> 01:10:30,791
if you think I'm gonna
trust you again.

1174
01:10:30,835 --> 01:10:33,577
You're just trying to lead me
into some other trap.

1175
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:34,926
I give up.

1176
01:10:35,013 --> 01:10:39,104
This is what I get for trying
to be a good sister.

1177
01:10:43,587 --> 01:10:45,415
Let's go.

1178
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:09,090
Daddy?

1179
01:11:09,177 --> 01:11:11,484
Oh, Ruby.

1180
01:11:11,528 --> 01:11:13,312
There's been a horrible
accident.

1181
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:15,793
Gisselle was in a car wreck.

1182
01:11:17,751 --> 01:11:19,492
What happened?

1183
01:11:19,536 --> 01:11:23,931
She and Martin...
horrible.

1184
01:11:24,018 --> 01:11:26,847
He just spun off the road.

1185
01:11:26,934 --> 01:11:27,848
Oh, my god!

1186
01:11:27,892 --> 01:11:31,374
Gisselle's in very,
very bad shape

1187
01:11:31,461 --> 01:11:34,290
and Martin... he wasn't
so lucky.

1188
01:11:34,377 --> 01:11:38,337
He uh, he died.

1189
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:40,208
It's all my fault.

1190
01:11:40,252 --> 01:11:44,169
Everyone I love suffers
for my sins.

1191
01:11:44,212 --> 01:11:46,519
Your fault?

1192
01:11:46,563 --> 01:11:47,390
How could this possibly be-

1193
01:11:47,477 --> 01:11:48,956
You!

1194
01:11:49,043 --> 01:11:51,655
We have had nothing but misery
around here since you showed up!

1195
01:12:13,067 --> 01:12:14,286
Nina!

1196
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:17,594
Did this happen because...
because of what I did?

1197
01:12:17,681 --> 01:12:20,031
There's no way to know that
for certain.

1198
01:12:20,118 --> 01:12:22,033
Could be it was just
an accident.

1199
01:12:22,076 --> 01:12:23,164
Or something else.

1200
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:25,689
Nina, you have to take me back
to Mama Dede.

1201
01:12:25,732 --> 01:12:27,517
I- I never meant for this
to happen.

1202
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,955
I- I just wanted her to stop
torturing me.

1203
01:12:31,042 --> 01:12:32,957
Well, she'll probably do now.

1204
01:12:33,044 --> 01:12:34,045
Nina.

1205
01:12:34,132 --> 01:12:35,307
I mean it.

1206
01:12:35,394 --> 01:12:36,743
Take me back to Mama Dede.

1207
01:12:36,787 --> 01:12:38,919
She- she must be able
to do something.

1208
01:12:38,963 --> 01:12:42,227
There is nothing that you can do
to change things

1209
01:12:42,314 --> 01:12:44,011
once they've happened.

1210
01:12:44,098 --> 01:12:45,752
Once you throw your anger
in the air

1211
01:12:45,839 --> 01:12:48,364
it can't be pulled back.

1212
01:13:06,077 --> 01:13:08,079
Gisselle?

1213
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:12,083
Come on in.

1214
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:20,352
I guess you were smart not
to get in the car.

1215
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:21,832
Gisselle, I'm so sorry.

1216
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,181
Really?

1217
01:13:23,268 --> 01:13:25,705
You're not even a little bit
pleased I can't walk?

1218
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:27,272
No.

1219
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:30,275
Of course not.

1220
01:13:30,318 --> 01:13:34,758
I only hope that dope Martin's
at least as bad off as I am.

1221
01:13:34,801 --> 01:13:37,848
I told him we were
going too fast.

1222
01:13:37,935 --> 01:13:38,936
Martin?

1223
01:13:41,982 --> 01:13:42,679
They didn't...

1224
01:13:42,766 --> 01:13:43,767
What?

1225
01:13:48,902 --> 01:13:52,123
Gisselle, I need to tell
you something.

1226
01:13:53,994 --> 01:13:56,736
I think the accident...

1227
01:13:56,823 --> 01:13:59,260
I think it may have been
my fault.

1228
01:13:59,347 --> 01:14:01,306
What're you talking about?

1229
01:14:01,349 --> 01:14:03,656
You weren't even in the car.

1230
01:14:03,743 --> 01:14:09,314
I think... I may have put
a curse on you.

1231
01:14:09,401 --> 01:14:10,446
Hardy har.

1232
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:12,535
What are you,
a witch now?

1233
01:14:12,622 --> 01:14:15,625
No.

1234
01:14:15,712 --> 01:14:19,280
I went to see a voodoo
priestess.

1235
01:14:19,367 --> 01:14:23,371
I was so furious at you

1236
01:14:23,415 --> 01:14:27,288
and I just wanted her to make
you stop tormenting me.

1237
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:29,595
I never thought that something
this bad could happen.

1238
01:14:29,682 --> 01:14:30,944
Are you serious?

1239
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:32,729
Gisselle, please.

1240
01:14:32,816 --> 01:14:34,557
You have to forgive me.

1241
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:36,472
All I've ever wanted
since the beginning

1242
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:38,865
was for us to be sisters.

1243
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:40,650
Real twins.

1244
01:14:40,737 --> 01:14:42,869
You wanna be twins, Ruby?

1245
01:14:42,913 --> 01:14:46,612
Then you go out and
get paralyzed yourself.

1246
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:50,007
Then we'll be twins, Ruby.

1247
01:15:18,862 --> 01:15:20,298
Daphne?

1248
01:15:20,385 --> 01:15:21,734
You wanted me?

1249
01:15:21,778 --> 01:15:24,041
Yes, Ruby. Come in.

1250
01:15:26,434 --> 01:15:30,569
I would be so grateful if you
could do me a favour.

1251
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:33,093
Of course.

1252
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:36,270
Today's your Uncle Jean's
birthday and normally

1253
01:15:36,357 --> 01:15:41,798
your father and Gisselle would
go see him at the facility,

1254
01:15:41,841 --> 01:15:45,541
but your father doesn't have
the strength to go

1255
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:49,457
and Gisselle... anyway.

1256
01:15:49,501 --> 01:15:52,809
I promised your father
that I would go see him.

1257
01:15:52,852 --> 01:15:56,290
And I was wondering if you would
consider coming with me.

1258
01:15:56,377 --> 01:15:59,076
Of course I'll go with you.

1259
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:02,296
Don't give it a thought.

1260
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:05,430
I really want things to be
different around here, Ruby.

1261
01:16:05,473 --> 01:16:10,261
Yes, I do, too.

1262
01:16:17,877 --> 01:16:19,923
Madame Dumas.

1263
01:16:19,966 --> 01:16:20,924
Please.

1264
01:16:21,011 --> 01:16:22,665
So nice to see you again.

1265
01:16:22,752 --> 01:16:27,278
Doctor Cheryl, this is
my daughter, Ruby.

1266
01:16:27,321 --> 01:16:29,236
Ruby, yes.

1267
01:16:29,323 --> 01:16:31,108
Yes. Please, have a seat.

1268
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,767
If you'll excuse me, I'm going
to run to the ladies room.

1269
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:38,594
Oh, yes.

1270
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:39,638
Yes, of course.

1271
01:16:39,682 --> 01:16:41,292
Just down the hall.

1272
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:47,472
So, what do you think of
our institute, Ruby?

1273
01:16:47,515 --> 01:16:53,173
Um, it seems very professional.

1274
01:16:53,217 --> 01:16:55,523
Your mother has told me
quite a bit about you.

1275
01:16:55,567 --> 01:16:58,526
I understand you've had a little
trouble adjusting.

1276
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,659
Everything's still
a little new to me,

1277
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:02,574
but I'm getting used to it.

1278
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:04,010
Making friends?

1279
01:17:04,097 --> 01:17:05,664
Some.

1280
01:17:05,751 --> 01:17:08,145
And the boys?

1281
01:17:08,232 --> 01:17:09,886
Tell me about the boys.

1282
01:17:09,973 --> 01:17:13,193
I'm sorry, the boys?

1283
01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:15,631
Well, I understand there
was an incident.

1284
01:17:15,718 --> 01:17:19,199
Something to do
with photographs.

1285
01:17:19,243 --> 01:17:21,637
Daphne told you about that?

1286
01:17:23,029 --> 01:17:26,467
I wonder, Ruby, are you familiar
with the words

1287
01:17:26,511 --> 01:17:29,514
"promiscuous" and "nymphomania"?

1288
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:30,907
I don't understand.

1289
01:17:30,994 --> 01:17:33,039
I'm just here to see my uncle.

1290
01:17:33,126 --> 01:17:34,998
Your mother found this

1291
01:17:35,085 --> 01:17:36,521
and she's had some
notable concerns

1292
01:17:36,564 --> 01:17:38,958
about your behaviour lately.

1293
01:17:41,178 --> 01:17:42,875
Ok, what is this?

1294
01:17:42,962 --> 01:17:43,833
Where is Daphne?

1295
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,225
I don't want you to be scared,
Ruby.

1296
01:17:45,269 --> 01:17:47,619
The floor we've assigned you to
is for temporaries only.

1297
01:17:47,706 --> 01:17:49,534
We expect your stay here
to be brief.

1298
01:17:49,577 --> 01:17:50,796
Gentlemen?

1299
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:52,319
Daphne!

1300
01:17:52,406 --> 01:17:54,365
They're just gonna show you
to your room.

1301
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,890
It's alright, Ruby.

1302
01:17:57,977 --> 01:17:58,674
No!

1303
01:17:58,717 --> 01:17:59,892
No!!!

1304
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:19,390
I know what you're thinking.

1305
01:18:19,477 --> 01:18:23,786
But you can forget about
escaping from the common room.

1306
01:18:23,829 --> 01:18:27,659
If you're serious, though,
there is one way out.

1307
01:18:27,746 --> 01:18:31,619
I'd use it myself but I'm
no good on the outside.

1308
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,710
I'm sorry, but could you
leave me alone?

1309
01:18:52,249 --> 01:18:54,251
Best dressed loony in the bin.

1310
01:19:03,521 --> 01:19:04,565
Jean Dumas?

1311
01:19:06,698 --> 01:19:09,309
Uncle Jean?

1312
01:19:09,396 --> 01:19:12,660
It's you, isn't it?

1313
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:18,057
I know I look like Gisselle
but my name is Ruby.

1314
01:19:18,144 --> 01:19:20,364
I'm her twin.

1315
01:19:20,451 --> 01:19:23,889
I only met the family
a short while ago,

1316
01:19:23,976 --> 01:19:30,330
but your brother, Pierre, he
cries about you all the time.

1317
01:19:30,374 --> 01:19:31,984
I don't know what troubles him
so much

1318
01:19:32,028 --> 01:19:35,945
but he obviously cares
about you.

1319
01:19:36,032 --> 01:19:38,382
Jib.

1320
01:19:38,469 --> 01:19:40,471
I'm sorry, did
you say something?

1321
01:19:40,558 --> 01:19:44,649
Jiiiiiiib!

1322
01:19:44,692 --> 01:19:45,998
Jib! Jib!

1323
01:19:46,085 --> 01:19:47,086
Jib!

1324
01:19:47,173 --> 01:19:51,787
Jib! Jib! Jib!

1325
01:20:01,709 --> 01:20:04,364
That guy is tough to talk to.

1326
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:07,324
I probably should have
said something.

1327
01:20:07,367 --> 01:20:09,979
You said there was a way
out of here?

1328
01:20:12,459 --> 01:20:15,506
I need to use the ladies room.

1329
01:20:58,941 --> 01:21:03,423
Thank you, but I think
in the face of tragedy

1330
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:08,080
any one of us would have found
the strength that I have.

1331
01:21:08,167 --> 01:21:09,865
I've surprised myself.

1332
01:21:15,696 --> 01:21:17,829
Good afternoon, ladies.

1333
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:20,614
What do you think
of my new dress?

1334
01:21:20,658 --> 01:21:22,878
Daphne picked it out special
for me.

1335
01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:24,488
Oh, forgive me.

1336
01:21:24,575 --> 01:21:26,316
I mean mother.

1337
01:21:26,403 --> 01:21:28,057
Ruby!

1338
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,449
I'm afraid I got a little muddy.

1339
01:21:29,493 --> 01:21:33,584
You see, I had to hitchhike home
from the mental hospital.

1340
01:21:33,627 --> 01:21:35,020
It's no easy task.

1341
01:21:35,107 --> 01:21:37,153
Ladies, I must apologize.

1342
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,982
Mother, darling, say goodbye
to your friends, would you,

1343
01:21:40,069 --> 01:21:42,288
and meet me in the study?

1344
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:43,594
Your office.

1345
01:21:43,637 --> 01:21:44,682
Now.

1346
01:22:00,002 --> 01:22:01,699
I really think we ought
to discuss

1347
01:22:01,786 --> 01:22:03,919
that little trick
you pulled on me.

1348
01:22:04,006 --> 01:22:06,791
I did what I did to protect this
family and I would do it again.

1349
01:22:06,878 --> 01:22:09,402
You did what you did
to get rid of me.

1350
01:22:09,489 --> 01:22:11,491
You've hated me since the day
I showed up.

1351
01:22:11,578 --> 01:22:12,840
You don't belong here!

1352
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:15,800
And I know why you hate me.

1353
01:22:15,887 --> 01:22:18,411
It's because I remind you
that my father

1354
01:22:18,498 --> 01:22:21,153
was once in love
with someone else

1355
01:22:21,197 --> 01:22:23,808
much more than he could ever
love someone like you.

1356
01:22:23,895 --> 01:22:26,550
I am sorry, I will not tolerate
that tone in this house.

1357
01:22:26,637 --> 01:22:29,553
You should hear yourself,
Daphne.

1358
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,772
And you should know daddy
will be hearing

1359
01:22:31,859 --> 01:22:34,514
all about what you tried
to do to me.

1360
01:22:34,601 --> 01:22:37,082
The other day you said

1361
01:22:37,169 --> 01:22:39,606
you hope things could be
different around here.

1362
01:22:39,693 --> 01:22:42,914
Well, you're going to get
your wish.

1363
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:46,874
Don't you expect any help
from your father.

1364
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,311
I have half a mind
to commit him, too.

1365
01:22:48,354 --> 01:22:50,269
The man is an emotional wreck!

1366
01:22:50,356 --> 01:22:53,272
In this house, who isn't?

1367
01:22:55,796 --> 01:23:00,279
We are going to stop hiding
behind lies in this family.

1368
01:23:00,366 --> 01:23:03,065
The mental institution called.

1369
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:07,417
I told them Ruby
won't be returning.

1370
01:23:11,508 --> 01:23:14,946
Thank you, Daddy.

1371
01:23:15,033 --> 01:23:18,558
They say you saw Jean?

1372
01:23:18,645 --> 01:23:22,910
I need you to know that
he's there because of me.

1373
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:24,738
Because of my jealousy.

1374
01:23:24,825 --> 01:23:30,309
Jean was the golden child
in my father's eyes and I-

1375
01:23:30,396 --> 01:23:32,920
I was the disappointment.

1376
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:36,489
I deliberately released the jib
of that sail boat

1377
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:42,713
that struck his head and
jealousy is still the cause

1378
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:48,240
of all our family's troubles
and it stops today.

1379
01:23:48,284 --> 01:23:51,374
You have to stop trying
to destroy me,

1380
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:54,899
because I promise you,
you will never succeed.

1381
01:23:54,986 --> 01:23:58,033
I really hope one day
I can call you "mother"

1382
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,122
and I can mean it.

1383
01:24:29,194 --> 01:24:30,804
How is she?

1384
01:24:30,891 --> 01:24:35,287
Exhausted, but happy to be home.

1385
01:24:35,374 --> 01:24:36,593
I wanted to tell you

1386
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:40,466
that I've decided to send
Gisselle to private school.

1387
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:42,512
I think it would be a lot better
for her

1388
01:24:42,599 --> 01:24:46,907
due to her condition
than in public school.

1389
01:24:46,951 --> 01:24:47,952
I think you're probably right.

1390
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:52,435
It's a boarding school
for girls and um,

1391
01:24:52,522 --> 01:24:57,657
well, I wondered if you might
consider going with her?

1392
01:24:57,701 --> 01:24:59,572
I know Gisselle would do
a lot better there

1393
01:24:59,659 --> 01:25:01,444
with you at her side.

1394
01:25:01,531 --> 01:25:04,490
You're assuming Gisselle
wants my help.

1395
01:25:04,534 --> 01:25:08,538
Well, she may not want it
but she needs it.

1396
01:25:14,065 --> 01:25:15,501
Can I think about it?

1397
01:25:15,588 --> 01:25:16,633
Sure.

1398
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,983
You take all the time you need.

1399
01:25:44,443 --> 01:25:45,923
Paul!

1400
01:25:47,925 --> 01:25:49,579
How did you find me?

1401
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:51,320
I took a bottle of whiskey
over to your grandfather.

1402
01:25:51,407 --> 01:25:52,799
I picked his brain.

1403
01:25:52,886 --> 01:25:54,192
Once I got the Dumas name
out of him

1404
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:56,020
it wasn't hard to piece
things together.

1405
01:25:56,107 --> 01:26:01,156
Oh, I'm so glad to see you,
I can't even say.

1406
01:26:07,771 --> 01:26:11,122
You're still the only girl
I'll ever love, Ruby.

1407
01:26:11,209 --> 01:26:14,343
Well, you have to get over that.

1408
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:17,128
I'm so sorry for the way
I had to leave,

1409
01:26:17,215 --> 01:26:19,261
without saying goodbye.

1410
01:26:19,348 --> 01:26:23,134
Listen, uh, Jack uh,
he was talking crazy

1411
01:26:23,221 --> 01:26:25,397
about some twin sister.

1412
01:26:25,484 --> 01:26:28,052
Oh my god, that's right.

1413
01:26:28,095 --> 01:26:30,489
Gisselle doesn't know she's also
got a swamp brother.

1414
01:26:30,576 --> 01:26:32,404
Gisselle?

1415
01:26:35,929 --> 01:26:36,974
Gisselle?

1416
01:26:37,061 --> 01:26:39,759
Guess who's coming
to dinner tonight?

1417
01:26:39,803 --> 01:26:42,545
Your long lost brother
from the bayou.

1418
01:26:42,632 --> 01:26:44,199
What?!
