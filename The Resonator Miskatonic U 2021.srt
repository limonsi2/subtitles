3
00:01:00,577 --> 00:01:03,097
- Remind me what this
thing's supposed to do again.

4
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:05,065
- Only save mankind.

5
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,928
- Oh, right.

6
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:09,207
- Shut up and turn
the camera on.

7
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:15,834
Is it on?

8
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:20,839
- Uh...

9
00:01:21,943 --> 00:01:22,772
Rolling.

10
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:25,395
- Connection good?

11
00:01:25,395 --> 00:01:28,088
- It says all
receptors are linked.

12
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:34,956
- Functioning at full capacity.

13
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:47,555
- Punch it.

14
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:50,248
- Powering up.

15
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,102
- Crawford, what is this thing?

16
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:22,694
- The Resonator.

17
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,502
It's alive.

18
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:48,927
- You getting this?

19
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,696
You feel that?

20
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,150
- Brian, are you getting this?

21
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:07,497
Brian?

22
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:09,879
Brian?

23
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:27,862
- Brian!

24
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,716
- So, after sitting in this
musty old house for 12 hours

25
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:41,133
and witnessing total
manifestation, I go home,

26
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,376
look at my camera.

27
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,413
Everything I got's
been wiped clean.

28
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:45,828
- What about your EVP?

29
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,001
- All of it, gone.

30
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:49,452
That place is unprecedented.

31
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:55,458
Mara to the world of the living.

32
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,390
Give us a sign.

33
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,253
- Sorry.

34
00:05:58,427 --> 00:05:59,911
- I don't know why
you're so worried.

35
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:03,293
- I'm not worried, but I know
Crawford, something's up.

36
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,504
- Mara, the guy's a freak.

37
00:06:06,504 --> 00:06:09,299
- He's probably got some math
equation stuck in his head.

38
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:10,508
- That's not it, okay?

39
00:06:10,508 --> 00:06:12,302
He stopped texting me.

40
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:14,201
He's never at his place anymore.

41
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:15,927
Yesterday in class,
he barely spoke to me.

42
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:19,206
- Quantum physics isn't exactly
the setting for romance.

43
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:21,381
- He's been checked
out for two months.

44
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,417
- Well, then break up with him.

45
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,627
Sure, he's hot in an
unwashed genius kind of way,

46
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:29,181
but his mood swings are
really effecting your juju.

47
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:34,566
Look, you're one of the
smartest girls on campus.

48
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:35,740
Act like it.

49
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,879
Ghost on him.
- He's not a keeper.

50
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,467
- Ladies.

51
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:41,021
- Hey, Brandon.

52
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:42,402
- I gotta go.

53
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,577
- Ah, well, happy Friday
to you to.

54
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:46,578
What's wrong?

55
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,824
Oh, more Tillinghast drama.

56
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:52,170
- Yeah.

57
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,999
- Well, I've just
the cure for that.

58
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,863
Let's all meet up
at Stu's tonight.

59
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:58,038
- I'm in.
- Yeah.

60
00:06:58,038 --> 00:06:58,901
- Well, Mara.

61
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:01,110
What do you say?

62
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,042
Miskatonic brainiacs
all together,

63
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:03,388
a little fray of festivities?

64
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:04,665
- I have a full day.

65
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:06,598
- And I'm gonna spend
the next week six hours

66
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:07,772
cutting up a cadaver.

67
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:08,566
Come on, like.

68
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:11,948
I'll even get
your boy to show up.

69
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:14,917
- Speaking of.

70
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:17,885
- Crawford?

71
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:23,753
Crawford!

72
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:24,582
- Hey.

73
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,069
- Okay, what is wrong with you?

74
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:31,554
- Nothing.

75
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:35,869
I have a lot on my mind.

76
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,149
- Are you seeing someone else?

77
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:40,977
- What?

78
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:43,117
No.

79
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:44,084
No, things are just

80
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:47,294
complicated right now.

81
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,643
Very, very complicated.

82
00:07:51,643 --> 00:07:53,093
- Well, let me help you.

83
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:55,198
- I can't, not yet anyway.

84
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:57,338
Besides, there are

85
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:58,823
unsavory points to the story

86
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:00,134
that you're better
off not knowing.

87
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:07,866
- Are you in trouble?

88
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,490
- No, no.

89
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,078
No, I promise, okay?

90
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:15,046
We're good, okay?

91
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:19,395
- Okay.
- Okay?

92
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:23,192
- We're meeting up at Stu's
tonight, you want to go?

93
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:23,986
- Uh.

94
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,885
Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah.

95
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:28,300
Just for a little bit, okay?

96
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:30,510
Trust me.

97
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,373
You'll understand
everything soon enough.

98
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:57,709
- For some, the idea
that an afterlife

99
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:02,507
was created by an
omnipotent god is a myth.

100
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:06,649
A blessed ruler, King of Kings.

101
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:09,618
Lord of Lords.

102
00:09:11,102 --> 00:09:16,107
However, hundreds of years
of human experience suggests

103
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:19,938
it's not only
plausible, it's a fact.

104
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,773
Mr. Tillinghast.

105
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:33,365
- Crawford.

106
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:36,610
- Yo, heads up.

107
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,407
- Uh.

108
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:46,102
Repeat the question.

109
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:47,656
- Is there an afterlife?

110
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:53,420
Do God, heaven and hell exist?

111
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,490
- Religious ideologies
were created

112
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,699
to control simple minds.

113
00:09:56,699 --> 00:09:58,839
- You sound sure of yourself.

114
00:09:58,839 --> 00:09:59,978
- Dimensions in our
conscious reality

115
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:03,361
go far beyond imaginary
gods and realms.

116
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:04,189
- Meaning?

117
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:08,331
- The end of the human
experience, or death,

118
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:11,231
is just one stop on
a perpetual journey.

119
00:10:11,231 --> 00:10:13,129
- So, what makes you so sure?

120
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:18,721
- We all know energy never dies.

121
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:20,205
It can only evolve
or move forward.

122
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:21,828
The so-called universe
is never ending,

123
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:24,451
especially if you consider
the notion of true reality.

124
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:27,178
- You paid close attention
to your father's work.

125
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:28,455
- Well, he was right.

126
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:31,561
Especially if you can
fathom there are in fact,

127
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:34,150
multiple universes all
stacked on top of each other

128
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,773
like pages in a ream of paper.

129
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:37,498
- I'm
aware of the notion.

130
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:41,882
How do you prove such
a colorful theory?

131
00:10:43,332 --> 00:10:44,713
- I'm really,

132
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:48,199
really good at math.

133
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:57,691
- You should stick to
solving math problems.

134
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,969
Your theory is intriguing,

135
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:02,282
but it's difficult to
wrap your head around

136
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:05,665
from a spiritual point of view.

137
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:09,703
- You don't see God

138
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,604
but you believe he exists?

139
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,264
Just because you can't
comprehend something

140
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:21,715
doesn't mean it isn't so.

141
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:04,931
- Yo, Crawford!

142
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:06,035
Where are you heading, man?

143
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:08,141
- Working on Project X.

144
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:09,073
- It figures.

145
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:10,626
How's that thing going anyway?

146
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:12,524
- Catastrophic, but
thanks for asking.

147
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:16,114
You didn't tell anyone did you?

148
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:18,254
- Hell no, man.

149
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:21,085
People can figure out that
you're nuts on their own time.

150
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:22,603
You know, you've been
working on that thing

151
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:24,709
since I cheated off you the
first time in Butler's class.

152
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,884
What the hell is it anyway?

153
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:28,920
- Only my dead father's
mission in life.

154
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,990
I figured I'd
finish what kept him

155
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,889
so checked out all those years.

156
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:34,132
- Ah, so just
another overachiever

157
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:35,755
chasing the love he never
got from his father.

158
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,757
- Yeah,
something like that.

159
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,585
- Mm, classic.

160
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:41,139
- Tillinghast.

161
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:42,244
Been looking for you.

162
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,867
- Professor Wallace.

163
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:46,489
- Have you seen Brian Hemingway?

164
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:50,355
- No, last time I
saw him was Friday.

165
00:12:51,494 --> 00:12:53,427
- Hm, his mother called
and said he didn't

166
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:55,498
show up for Sunday dinner.

167
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:57,535
Nobody's seen him
on campus all week.

168
00:12:57,535 --> 00:12:59,779
- No, but I'll keep an eye open.

169
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:03,299
- Mr. Johnson.

170
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,026
- I've been at
practice every day.

171
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:08,235
- Practice, of course.

172
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:10,375
It's humorous that you
attend a university

173
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,101
that shapes the greatest
minds in the world

174
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:15,104
and your focus is football.

175
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:16,485
- What can I say?

176
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:18,245
I kick ass.

177
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:19,729
- How nice?

178
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:21,973
I hope your forward pass is
better than your baseball swing.

179
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:27,772
Tillinghast, one more question.

180
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:29,636
Professor Gordon said
there's some components

181
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:31,258
missing from his lab.

182
00:13:31,258 --> 00:13:34,814
Electronics, cable, plutonium.

183
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,369
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

184
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:39,197
- Of course not.

185
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:42,580
Not really my style.

186
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,927
- Tillinghast, your father
and I were competitors,

187
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:47,550
but that does not mean that
I'm not rooting for you.

188
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:50,139
Especially since his death.

189
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:53,694
I know it's your passion
to continue with his work,

190
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:56,042
but you don't want
to lose your head.

191
00:13:58,285 --> 00:14:01,633
I'd be interested in
seeing your progress.

192
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,221
You know, should you
have a change of heart

193
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:05,672
and decide that you want to
pick up where he left off.

194
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:09,055
I'd even be willing
to mentor you.

195
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,339
- Thanks, Professor,

196
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,859
but my father's work
died when he did.

197
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,860
- Of course, it did.

198
00:14:45,746 --> 00:14:48,577
- And then he says, "I
hope your forward pass

199
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:49,992
"is better than your swing."

200
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:51,097
- Oh.

201
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:52,961
- I'll get the drinks.
- Yeah.

202
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:54,479
- Thank you.

203
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:56,171
- All right.

204
00:14:56,171 --> 00:14:59,105
To the most brilliant minds
Miskatonic's ever known.

205
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:00,382
- Cheers.

206
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:02,522
One for the dead!

207
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,731
- Oh.

208
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,389
- Speaking of brilliant minds,

209
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:08,908
you finally gonna tell us
what the hell you been up to?

210
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,323
- Where you been, man?

211
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:12,187
- Yeah, where have you been?

212
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:13,222
- Um.

213
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:15,604
- Go ahead, tell 'em.

214
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:18,918
- Wait, you know,
what's been going on?

215
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,953
- Hey, don't shoot
the messenger.

216
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,266
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

217
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:27,133
But this is not for publication.

218
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:28,203
- What is it?

219
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:31,931
- Monumental.

220
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,108
Just before my dad died,
he was on the verge

221
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:39,628
of a very big
scientific breakthrough.

222
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:41,630
The kind of thing that would
change the world forever.

223
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,460
After years spent
exploring the theory

224
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,256
that we live in a
multi-dimensional universe,

225
00:15:47,256 --> 00:15:50,121
he finally figured out a way
to prove that they exist.

226
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:51,640
- Shut up.

227
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,366
- Yeah, more importantly, he
found a way to look into them.

228
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:54,884
- How?

229
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:57,128
- He was close to finishing
a prototype for a device.

230
00:15:57,128 --> 00:15:58,543
One that emits a
sonic vibration that

231
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:00,200
stimulates the pineal gland.

232
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,202
- The third eye.
- Yeah.

233
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:03,721
- You finished building it?

234
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:06,689
- No, it was destroyed in
the explosion when he died.

235
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:08,622
I originally thought the
plans burnt up with it.

236
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:09,761
- But?

237
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,280
- When I was
helping my mom move,

238
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:14,111
I found copies of his notes.

239
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:16,596
- You rebuilt it.

240
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:17,873
- Where?

241
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:23,844
- I'll show you.

242
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,017
- Multi-dimensional philosophy,
dimensional imagery.

243
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:02,849
Korean cheerleader bondage.

244
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:09,097
Hm, if anything, you got
good taste, Tillinghast.

245
00:17:11,754 --> 00:17:14,688
What in the world would you
need 20 cell phones for?

246
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,347
Mathematical certainty.

247
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:19,900
Fourth dimension tesseract.

248
00:17:25,423 --> 00:17:27,701
Nuclear fusion core components.

249
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:37,953
How to dissolve a human body.

250
00:17:39,368 --> 00:17:40,404
Busy, busy, busy.

251
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,303
- Wallace.

252
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:45,616
- Yes?

253
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:49,171
Hello, who is it?

254
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:32,973
- This is the Resonator.

255
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:37,219
- Whoa.

256
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:40,360
- It's beautiful.

257
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:43,156
- What is this place?

258
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,262
- My uncle used to
grow weed in here.

259
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:46,849
There's a great power grid.

260
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:48,506
Doesn't air pulse
a lot of juice.

261
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:53,408
- What exactly is this
thing supposed to do?

262
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:54,685
- One way to find out.

263
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:56,307
- Don't touch it.

264
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:59,138
It has a uranium micro core.

265
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,000
- Uranium?

266
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:05,489
Dude, are you out of
your fucking mind?

267
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,803
- Are we safe?

268
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:11,978
- If you don't come
into contact with it.

269
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:14,912
Don't ever touch the casing,
especially if it's powered up.

270
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:18,502
- Let's see what it does.

271
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:26,786
- What's this?

272
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:27,683
- Human heart.

273
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:29,789
Fresh.

274
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:32,136
Thought you gave up meat, buddy.

275
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:33,862
- That's funny.

276
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:35,622
- Where'd you get it?

277
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:36,451
- Forensics lab.

278
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:38,349
I wanted to see how soft tissue

279
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:40,351
was affected by the Resonator.

280
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:43,389
- Crawford Tillinghast,
always going the extra mile.

281
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:44,631
- Yeah.

282
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:48,256
- So, what exactly
does this thing do?

283
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:49,118
- A lot.

284
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:53,226
That is, when it's
fully functioning.

285
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:57,575
Admittedly, there
have been a few kinks.

286
00:19:57,575 --> 00:20:00,440
My father was an expert
in studies of the brain.

287
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,443
Behavioral, neurology,
dysfunction.

288
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:06,860
He spent a lot of time
studying mental patients.

289
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,311
Over the course of his
tenure, he developed a theory,

290
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:12,211
that people diagnosed
with schizophrenia

291
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,627
are not in fact mentally ill.

292
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:17,250
- What's wrong with 'em?

293
00:20:18,355 --> 00:20:19,218
- Nothing.

294
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,944
They're actually evolved beings

295
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:23,739
somehow straddling our world

296
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:26,880
and the parallel universes
at the same time.

297
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,228
- Which explains why
they see things we don't.

298
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,437
- Correct, he believed their
senses were in overdrive.

299
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:34,647
- So, he created this to
disprove their diagnosis.

300
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:35,889
- At first.

301
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:37,374
Then he realized
that schizophrenics

302
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:38,927
aren't the only ones who
can have these experiences.

303
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:42,241
You have psychics, people who
have paranormal encounters.

304
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,795
- Tweakers.
- Yes, actually--

305
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:46,797
- Angels and demons.

306
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:48,074
Alien sightings.

307
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:50,145
- Or, or what you think
is an alien sighting.

308
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:52,147
- Yeah, the deeper he
dug the more he realized

309
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:54,701
that the people who witnessed
these kinds of phenomenon

310
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:56,116
all have one thing in common.

311
00:20:57,877 --> 00:21:00,259
- Their brains have
hypersensitive pineal glands.

312
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:02,537
- Correct.

313
00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:06,679
- So, this stimulates
the pineal gland

314
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:10,199
so that the average person
can also see these entities.

315
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:11,166
- Yeah.

316
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,789
- Brilliant.

317
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:16,275
- Yeah, if it actually works.

318
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:18,069
You've tried it?

319
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:22,833
And?

320
00:21:24,835 --> 00:21:26,112
- It really works.

321
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:29,736
- Let's get this party started!

322
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:35,915
- I told you it
was a good reason.

323
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:25,447
- So, all this time you knew
what Crawford was up to?

324
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,141
- Yeah.

325
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,833
- Why didn't you say anything?

326
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,111
Could have spared
Mara a lot of worry.

327
00:22:34,111 --> 00:22:37,045
- Because he asked me not to.

328
00:22:37,045 --> 00:22:40,842
And the fact that all
this is bullshit anyway.

329
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:42,291
- I don't know.

330
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,156
I've experienced some
pretty fantastic phenomenon.

331
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,779
Anything's possible.

332
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:48,677
- Come on, you cannot
possibly believe

333
00:22:48,677 --> 00:22:51,093
that that thing does what
Crawford says it does.

334
00:22:55,822 --> 00:22:57,997
Look, his old man was nuts.

335
00:22:57,997 --> 00:23:00,827
And Crawford, he's
a close second.

336
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:02,346
I love the guy, I do,

337
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:05,384
but that Adderall habit's
clearly taken its toll.

338
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:09,595
Speaking of tolls.

339
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:13,771
Have I told you that we
should go out sometime?

340
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:15,635
- Only if you bring
a girl for me.

341
00:23:16,498 --> 00:23:18,362
- I love threesomes.

342
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:37,795
What is it?

343
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:45,838
- Something's here.

344
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:51,395
I can feel his energy.

345
00:23:55,261 --> 00:23:59,679
- And that would be
our cue to go back.

346
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,680
- No.

347
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:13,003
- Stay behind me, and
keep your eyes open.

348
00:24:14,107 --> 00:24:16,696
And a couple of warnings.

349
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:18,215
- Warnings?

350
00:24:18,215 --> 00:24:20,320
- The Resonator creates
minor side effects.

351
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,805
Slight headache.

352
00:24:21,805 --> 00:24:23,738
You may feel mildly aroused.

353
00:24:23,738 --> 00:24:24,601
- More than normal?

354
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:25,809
- Shut up.

355
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:27,327
- Stay focused.

356
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:30,020
It's your senses going into
overdrive, and don't move.

357
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,401
They can't see you,
if you stay still.

358
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,301
Ready?

359
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:41,238
Remember, if you see anything
at all, point it out.

360
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:42,446
Some of them can be

361
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:44,483
testy.

362
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,208
- Get real.

363
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:51,869
- Here we go.

364
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,126
- This thing
leak radiation?

365
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:09,508
- Not as far as I know.

366
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,061
Just keep your eyes open.

367
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:12,925
The moment you see one of
them, I'm shutting it off.

368
00:25:54,725 --> 00:25:55,657
- Crawford.

369
00:27:01,516 --> 00:27:03,587
- Whoa.

370
00:27:03,587 --> 00:27:04,761
I...

371
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:07,660
I am a big fan of this thing.

372
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:17,532
- Please tell me we just looked
into the future.

373
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:13,036
- Yeah.

374
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:15,452
- Just checking on you.

375
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:17,696
- I'm good, just

376
00:28:19,905 --> 00:28:20,802
frustrated.

377
00:28:22,355 --> 00:28:24,323
- Don't
beat yourself up.

378
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:27,533
You said you had the Resonator
working before, right?

379
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:28,776
- Sort of.

380
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:30,018
- Then you'll get
it working again.

381
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,368
You're right, this
thing could change the world.

382
00:28:35,368 --> 00:28:37,370
- Every time I think
I'm getting close,

383
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:40,788
something goes wrong.

384
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:43,549
- Well, you just
had a testing phase.

385
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:46,103
It's not like anything
tragic has unfolded.

386
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,728
If anybody can do it, it's you.

387
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,143
I believe in you.

388
00:28:54,422 --> 00:28:55,250
- Thanks.

389
00:28:58,184 --> 00:28:59,358
Hey, listen, I'm gonna
get a couple hours sleep

390
00:28:59,358 --> 00:29:00,808
then head back to the lab.

391
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:04,777
- Tell everyone to meet me
there tomorrow night at eight.

392
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:05,640
- Okay.

393
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:08,712
Crawford?

394
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:11,680
- Yeah?

395
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,959
- I love you.

396
00:29:17,963 --> 00:29:18,929
- Good night.

397
00:29:23,727 --> 00:29:25,177
- Can I ask you something?

398
00:29:25,177 --> 00:29:26,074
- Yeah.

399
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,252
- Does my telling
you that I love you

400
00:29:31,252 --> 00:29:33,772
have any effect on you at all?

401
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,501
- I'm sorry, Mara.

402
00:29:41,055 --> 00:29:43,782
That phrase wasn't
exactly thrown around
a lot in my family.

403
00:29:44,713 --> 00:29:47,509
It doesn't mean I don't care.

404
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:51,479
- Gotcha.

405
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,138
Guess it's good night then.

406
00:30:09,255 --> 00:30:10,947
- You shouldn't
be playing God, Crawford.

407
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:18,299
- Dad?

408
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:19,748
- There are things
in our universe

409
00:30:19,748 --> 00:30:22,648
not meant for the
eyes of mortals.

410
00:30:22,648 --> 00:30:23,822
Dismantle it, son.

411
00:30:25,168 --> 00:30:26,928
You're not only risking lives,

412
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:29,655
you're manipulating time itself.

413
00:30:29,655 --> 00:30:31,346
- I can get it to work properly.

414
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:35,143
- You saw for yourself, the
results can be disastrous.

415
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:38,008
- It can help people, I know it.

416
00:30:38,008 --> 00:30:39,941
- My calculations were wrong.

417
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:43,980
The device, it has the
potential to tear a hole

418
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,914
in your dimension that
can never be closed.

419
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,125
Destroy it before it's too late!

420
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:53,403
- He's right, Crawford.

421
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:54,956
Don't be an asshole.

422
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,720
- All right, I've
got this figured out.

423
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,755
Hey, listen up!

424
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:36,929
Come over here.

425
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:38,689
- But I still have
egg rolls to destroy.

426
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:39,794
- Crawford, you have to eat.

427
00:31:39,794 --> 00:31:41,416
- Bear, go wide.

428
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:42,521
- I'm serious,
I think I fixed it.

429
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:47,077
- Time for another
bite of the show.

430
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:48,907
- Last time it bifracted,
the power source got yanked,

431
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,218
the pins in the
connector shorted,

432
00:31:50,218 --> 00:31:51,668
and corrupted the program.

433
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:52,980
I fixed the pins, reinstalled
the operating system,

434
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,016
and according to this...

435
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:02,817
- It's Showtime.

436
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:05,544
- Remember, keep your distance.

437
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:07,235
If you see anything
at all, point it out.

438
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,859
- I can't leave it on for long.

439
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:12,137
- What's that for?

440
00:32:14,035 --> 00:32:15,243
- Insurance.

441
00:32:18,867 --> 00:32:20,317
Connection good?

442
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,425
- Says all power sources linked.

443
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:25,771
- Full capacity?

444
00:32:25,771 --> 00:32:26,599
- Yeah.

445
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:28,670
- Punch it.

446
00:33:04,844 --> 00:33:06,950
- Whoa, head rush.

447
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,504
- Don't move.

448
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,512
- My head.

449
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:19,100
- That's your dopamine,
try and stay still.

450
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,171
It can see you when you move.

451
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:38,361
- You feel that?

452
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,260
- Yes.

453
00:34:19,402 --> 00:34:20,506
- It's happening.

454
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:02,238
- Take me!

455
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:08,968
Take me.

456
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:11,557
Take me.

457
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:17,080
I want you inside me.

458
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,740
- Crawford,
you must end this.

459
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,778
Power down the device and
never turn it back on.

460
00:35:59,778 --> 00:36:02,953
There's things not meant
for the eyes of mortals.

461
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,162
Crawford.

462
00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:06,819
Son.

463
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:12,446
I'm working, please
find your mother.

464
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:14,517
Son, you can't help me.

465
00:36:16,346 --> 00:36:17,451
Please!

466
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:33,570
Son.

467
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:36,780
Turn it off.

468
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:48,723
- You did it.

469
00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:55,834
- Turn it off!

470
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:00,839
- No!

471
00:37:43,157 --> 00:37:44,917
Bear,
keep a look out.

472
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:49,439
- Tell me
she's gonna be okay!

473
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,512
- Hold the chest compressions.

474
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:57,136
Carrie, put your hand here.

475
00:37:57,136 --> 00:37:59,069
Bear, Bear, tear some
tape, and the stints,

476
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:00,347
pour it over the gauze.

477
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:01,520
- Come on, Mara!

478
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,941
- Come on, we gotta keep going!

479
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:10,667
- This can't be happening.

480
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:11,668
- A little late for that!

481
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:13,636
Everybody back!

482
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:15,258
Clear!

483
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:20,125
Clear!

484
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:22,161
- Mara,
don't do this.

485
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:26,959
Do it again.

486
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:38,385
You're gonna be okay.

487
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:39,765
I'm so sorry.

488
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:56,808
- Missed
you in Trig today.

489
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,224
- I had a long night.

490
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:04,056
- Same.

491
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:08,820
- How is she?

492
00:40:10,338 --> 00:40:15,274
- Lacerated oblique,
but she's gonna be fine.

493
00:40:15,274 --> 00:40:18,450
- I was able to track
down a bunch of ice.

494
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,072
She's feeling good, considering.

495
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:22,696
You should call her.

496
00:40:22,696 --> 00:40:23,524
- Yeah, I will.

497
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,391
- So what are we gonna do?

498
00:40:31,118 --> 00:40:33,465
We all agree that
this has to go, right?

499
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:35,640
- Brandon.

500
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,124
- No, Crawford.

501
00:40:37,124 --> 00:40:39,885
We could have been taken
out by those things.

502
00:40:39,885 --> 00:40:43,233
- I am on the precipice of
something revolutionary.

503
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:46,340
- You're on the
precipice of mass death.

504
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,445
Look at yourself.

505
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:52,553
You have no idea what this
thing is actually capable of!

506
00:40:54,003 --> 00:40:55,901
It's taking its
toll on you, man.

507
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:57,627
You're not
even thinking straight.

508
00:40:57,627 --> 00:40:59,180
- I just need to
reconfigure the vectors--

509
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,769
- Your Dad's gone, Crawford!

510
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:05,463
He's dead!

511
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,119
I know, man.

512
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,639
I know you love the
guy a lot, but this,

513
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:12,055
this is never gonna
bring him back!

514
00:41:13,436 --> 00:41:15,576
You proved his
theory, now move on!

515
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:18,199
It's dangerous.

516
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,375
Take it apart.

517
00:41:22,756 --> 00:41:25,103
You can rebuild it once you
know more about it, but.

518
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,831
Come on, look what
happened to Mara.

519
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:30,798
- Okay.

520
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:40,808
I'm sorry I put
you all in danger.

521
00:41:42,603 --> 00:41:44,467
- Why was Brian's
coat in your car?

522
00:41:46,676 --> 00:41:49,507
His jacket, it was in your car.

523
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:52,924
- He must have left it there.

524
00:41:52,924 --> 00:41:54,512
- No, no.

525
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,790
Saturday night, after me and
him ganked that shit for you

526
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:00,448
from Gordon's lab, he said
that he was coming here.

527
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:04,107
You said you hadn't
seen him since Friday.

528
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:05,592
He was here after that.

529
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:11,114
- You're gonna
pile on too, Bear.

530
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:13,289
- Brian was here?

531
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:14,117
- Is that true?

532
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,500
- Where the fuck is he?

533
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,570
- Canada.

534
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:21,297
Quebec to be exact.

535
00:42:24,024 --> 00:42:25,577
Jail.

536
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:27,545
Twink like that should
be very popular.

537
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,133
I spoke to his mother.

538
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,792
It seems your friend was
running prescription meds

539
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:34,724
across the border.

540
00:42:36,243 --> 00:42:37,244
It's very sloppy.

541
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:42,249
I also saw some very interesting
campus security video.

542
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:43,457
It seemed you all
have been very busy

543
00:42:43,457 --> 00:42:45,459
with your after hours thievery.

544
00:42:47,495 --> 00:42:49,221
Do not say one word
about any of this

545
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:51,845
to anyone or you all
will end up in jail.

546
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:55,883
Okay, this is the moment
where you run back to class

547
00:42:55,883 --> 00:42:57,644
before I have to expel you.

548
00:43:02,994 --> 00:43:03,788
Bye-bye.

549
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,970
Crawford Tillinghast.

550
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,766
So much for your father's
efforts dying when he did.

551
00:43:26,811 --> 00:43:27,881
- He knows about
the stolen stuff!

552
00:43:27,881 --> 00:43:29,227
- Now what do we do?

553
00:43:29,227 --> 00:43:31,332
- Lay low, till he leaves.

554
00:43:31,332 --> 00:43:32,610
- No, I can't lose
my scholarship

555
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,681
over Crawford's
stupid love machine.

556
00:43:34,681 --> 00:43:36,648
- Oh, Mara
isn't picking up.

557
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:38,029
- Fuck it.
- No, no.

558
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:39,547
We need to talk to Mara first.

559
00:43:53,734 --> 00:43:54,632
- It doesn't work.

560
00:43:56,564 --> 00:43:58,636
- It was working last night.

561
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,429
- No.

562
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:02,018
No, they're right.

563
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,608
The resonator needs
to be reconfigured.

564
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,716
The beings that came
through were uncontrollable.

565
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:10,889
I have to contain
the scope or anyone

566
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:12,580
near it is a sitting duck.

567
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,792
- Turn it on.

568
00:44:18,794 --> 00:44:19,967
- No.

569
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:23,661
- Turn it on.

570
00:44:30,253 --> 00:44:31,599
- It's not ready.

571
00:44:34,879 --> 00:44:36,639
- Turn it on.

572
00:44:39,124 --> 00:44:39,953
- Stand back.

573
00:44:43,301 --> 00:44:44,267
Over there!

574
00:44:49,548 --> 00:44:50,618
- That's it.

575
00:44:58,661 --> 00:44:59,800
Now activate it.

576
00:45:16,127 --> 00:45:16,955
You idiot!

577
00:45:21,201 --> 00:45:24,066
The sheriff is gonna be
very interested to learn

578
00:45:24,066 --> 00:45:26,309
who stole the uranium.

579
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:28,173
And not to mention your
obvious responsibility

580
00:45:28,173 --> 00:45:30,866
for Hemingway's disappearance.

581
00:45:30,866 --> 00:45:32,212
Yes, that's right.

582
00:45:32,212 --> 00:45:34,559
We both know he's not in jail.

583
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,459
Now, you have one hour
to get that working.

584
00:45:39,495 --> 00:45:41,566
If it's not functioning
when I return,

585
00:45:41,566 --> 00:45:44,431
you'll be looking at some very
serious jail time or worse.

586
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:45,950
- It's dangerous.

587
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:47,537
- Don't talk to anyone.

588
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:48,987
If your friends call,

589
00:45:48,987 --> 00:45:51,783
you tell them that you've
decided to take their advice,

590
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:55,166
and you're dismantling
it, understand?

591
00:45:57,651 --> 00:45:59,273
Good boy, Crawford.

592
00:45:59,273 --> 00:46:01,137
Now, you play your cards, right,

593
00:46:01,137 --> 00:46:02,345
you'll earn a
little extra credit

594
00:46:02,345 --> 00:46:03,761
at the end of the semester.

595
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:08,904
Good for you.

596
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:23,988
- You're up.

597
00:46:23,988 --> 00:46:24,816
- Yeah.

598
00:46:26,231 --> 00:46:27,715
- Amoxicillin.

599
00:46:27,715 --> 00:46:29,269
That'll spare you any infection.

600
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:30,201
- Thanks.

601
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:31,789
- How are you feeling?

602
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,825
- Well, I won't be doing
sit-ups anytime soon,

603
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:35,482
but I'm walking.

604
00:46:35,482 --> 00:46:36,897
- Have you heard from Crawford?

605
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,832
- No.

606
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:41,833
- Wallace showed up.

607
00:46:43,524 --> 00:46:44,629
- What?

608
00:46:44,629 --> 00:46:45,837
Why?

609
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:47,425
- He knows what
the Resonator is.

610
00:46:49,082 --> 00:46:50,221
- Where's Crawford?

611
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:51,739
- Still at the warehouse.

612
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:55,536
- He was about to dismantle
it, and then he just shows up.

613
00:46:55,536 --> 00:46:57,021
- Wallace told us to leave
and not to tell anyone

614
00:46:57,021 --> 00:46:58,436
about the device.

615
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:02,371
Guys, I have a really
bad feeling about this.

616
00:47:02,371 --> 00:47:05,339
- Hey, random question,

617
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:07,514
but your parents have any guns?

618
00:51:54,835 --> 00:51:57,804
- That will be quite
enough of that.

619
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,289
Go fuck yourself.

620
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:21,819
- Nice form.

621
00:53:55,473 --> 00:53:56,336
- Wallace.

622
00:53:57,889 --> 00:54:00,237
- Your programming
skills are very advanced.

623
00:54:01,307 --> 00:54:03,723
It warms my heart to see you

624
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:06,691
getting the most out of
the curriculum, Crawford.

625
00:54:06,691 --> 00:54:08,521
- What are you doing?

626
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:11,006
- What does it look
like I'm doing?

627
00:54:11,006 --> 00:54:14,837
I'm using science to
preserve humanity.

628
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:19,911
Alter history,
dominate the world.

629
00:54:19,911 --> 00:54:22,604
Just a typical Tuesday actually.

630
00:54:23,536 --> 00:54:24,606
- We can work on this together,

631
00:54:24,606 --> 00:54:27,264
but my calculations are wrong.

632
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,404
- I'll be the judge of that.

633
00:54:29,404 --> 00:54:31,198
- Wallace, listen to me.

634
00:54:31,198 --> 00:54:32,614
You cannot power this thing up.

635
00:54:32,614 --> 00:54:35,582
There will be unspeakable death
if it gets out of control.

636
00:54:35,582 --> 00:54:38,136
- You sound like
your pathetic father.

637
00:54:38,136 --> 00:54:41,485
So worried that someone is
gonna steal his thunder,

638
00:54:41,485 --> 00:54:44,591
that he's gonna lie to keep
this monumental discovery

639
00:54:44,591 --> 00:54:45,661
to himself.

640
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:47,629
- Do not turn it on!

641
00:54:47,629 --> 00:54:50,148
- What you don't
understand is your father

642
00:54:50,148 --> 00:54:52,979
and I both created
the Resonator.

643
00:54:54,912 --> 00:54:58,916
I designed the schematic and
he took it to the next level.

644
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:01,505
Unfortunately, our motives
were completely different.

645
00:55:02,782 --> 00:55:04,853
He wanted to help mankind.

646
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,753
I wanted to become a God.

647
00:55:11,204 --> 00:55:13,137
That's why he had to go.

648
00:55:15,346 --> 00:55:16,313
- You killed him.

649
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,337
- That's it.

650
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,032
That's it.

651
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,611
I can feel it.

652
00:56:32,527 --> 00:56:35,219
What your father failed
to tell you, Crawford,

653
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,359
about these beasts,

654
00:56:39,326 --> 00:56:40,638
if you want you control them

655
00:56:43,227 --> 00:56:46,955
you would have to become
one of them.

656
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:54,411
I can feel it!

657
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,628
- Told you I kick ass.

658
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:52,814
- Time to join your
father in hell!

659
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:17,079
At last.

660
00:58:18,184 --> 00:58:20,186
- Get away from my son!

661
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,021
It has the potential to
tear a four-way dimension

662
00:58:28,021 --> 00:58:29,989
that can never be closed.

663
00:58:31,715 --> 00:58:35,235
There are things not meant
for the eyes of mortals.

664
00:58:35,235 --> 00:58:36,478
Never toy with our home.

665
00:59:08,786 --> 00:59:11,686
- Crawford.

666
00:59:16,932 --> 00:59:19,832
Whoa, hello to you too.

667
00:59:20,867 --> 00:59:22,524
- How are you feeling?

668
00:59:22,524 --> 00:59:24,215
- Great, how are you?

669
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:26,770
- Good.

670
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:31,913
You are so beautiful.

671
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,192
There's something I've
been meaning to tell you.

672
00:59:35,192 --> 00:59:36,987
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

673
00:59:37,988 --> 00:59:39,714
I'm sorry I've been so distant.

674
00:59:41,129 --> 00:59:43,096
I should've said this
1000 times before the day.

675
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,789
- What?

676
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:48,550
- I love you.

677
00:59:49,413 --> 00:59:50,379
- I sure hope so.

678
00:59:51,553 --> 00:59:54,314
I love you too, Mr. Tillinghast.

679
00:59:57,076 --> 00:59:59,423
- If it isn't the most
brilliant minds Miskatonic U

680
00:59:59,423 --> 01:00:00,251
has ever known.

681
01:00:03,185 --> 01:00:05,463
Well, happy Friday to you too.

682
01:00:05,463 --> 01:00:07,811
Let me guess, more
Tillinghast drama?

683
01:00:10,123 --> 01:00:11,608
- Hey, guys.

684
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:12,747
- Yo, Carrie, want to
meet up at Stu's tonight?

685
01:00:12,747 --> 01:00:13,679
- I'm in.

686
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:16,302
- Well, Mara, what do you say?

687
01:00:16,302 --> 01:00:17,855
Miskatonic brainiacs
all together?

688
01:00:17,855 --> 01:00:18,753
Little Friday festivities?

689
01:00:18,753 --> 01:00:20,617
- I have a full day.

690
01:00:21,928 --> 01:00:23,620
- And? I'm gonna spend
the next six hours

691
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,138
cutting up a cadaver.

692
01:00:25,138 --> 01:00:26,415
Come on.

693
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:27,244
What's wrong?

694
01:00:28,176 --> 01:00:29,626
- Today's Friday?

695
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,386
- Uh, yeah.

696
01:00:31,386 --> 01:00:32,214
- Crawford!

697
01:00:33,975 --> 01:00:35,459
What up?

698
01:00:35,459 --> 01:00:38,255
We nabbed those components
you wanted from Gordon's lab.

699
01:00:38,255 --> 01:00:39,877
- Oh yeah, sorry.

700
01:00:39,877 --> 01:00:41,396
This is my bud from upstate.

701
01:00:41,396 --> 01:00:42,604
He just enrolled.

702
01:00:42,604 --> 01:00:44,571
Gang, meet Herbert West.

703
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:46,504
- How do you do?
