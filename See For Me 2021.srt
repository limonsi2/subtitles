00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,927
<i>Picking up speed nicely.</i>

4
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,497
<i>She's ahead of the leader now,
on pace for a top time.</i>

5
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:07,301
<i>It's a fantastic day here at
Areskatan Mountain</i>

6
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:11,071
<i>for day two of the 2019
Alpine Skiing Grande Prix.</i>

7
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:14,909
<i>Today is the lady's super G.</i>

8
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,279
<i>Here we go, it's a quick drop.</i>

9
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:20,949
<i>Not much of a jump.</i>

10
00:01:20,982 --> 00:01:22,482
<i>Ooh, really hugging
the gate here,</i>

11
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,184
<i>that's gonna add to her time.</i>

12
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,054
<i>We'll see whether it's
enough to sink her,</i>

13
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,088
<i>or if she can come back
with a strong finish</i>

14
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,624
<i>down the Dragon's Back.</i>

15
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,060
<i>Nice turns here,</i>

16
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,895
<i>her confidence really showing.</i>

17
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:36,363
<i>And she's already
ahead of the leader,</i>

18
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,666
<i>skiing very well through
the middle section,</i>

19
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,068
<i>keeping her speed.</i>

20
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:45,138
<i>A great performance from
the American, Emily Garner,</i>

21
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:47,407
<i>in a quest for a second gold.</i>

22
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,511
<i>What a come-back story
that would be</i>

23
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:52,312
<i>after the heartbreaking injury</i>

24
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,949
<i>that caused her to miss Sochi
four years ago...</i>

25
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,328
<i>Now, I think
there can definitely be</i>

26
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,764
<i>some speed down here</i>

27
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:44,565
<i>to make up for her rocky start.</i>

28
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,166
<i>But she's running out of room.</i>

29
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,706
<i>Coming to the final turn
up ahead...</i>

30
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,643
<i>keeping great form, skis tight,</i>

31
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:58,079
<i>checking the inside gate...</i>

32
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,647
<i>this is the approach that's been</i>

33
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:01,448
<i>tough for her competitors
yesterday</i>

34
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,818
<i>where everyone
dropped off the pace.</i>

35
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,887
<i>Will it cost her the same time?</i>

36
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,157
<i>Just a tenth of a second
is more than she can afford.</i>

37
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,392
<i>She's still in the medals
by 5/100 of a second,</i>

38
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:15,096
<i>but she needs to get through
this combination right</i>

39
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,765
<i>without taking the turn
too wide.</i>

40
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:20,400
<i>And here she comes to
the final pattern.</i>

41
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,402
<i>Coming up to the key turn.</i>

42
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:25,173
<i>Here it comes now and
she gets her line right.</i>

43
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,475
<i>This could be our best new time.</i>

44
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,611
<i>Now, this is known as
Magic Valley, it will be...</i>

45
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,013
What are you doing?

46
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:33,748
Nothing.

47
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:35,215
Doesn't look like nothing.

48
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,019
I got another gig, okay?

49
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:39,987
So you were just gonna leave?

50
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,723
I was gonna call you
from the road.

51
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,059
You're not leaving until you
tell me what is going on.

52
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,426
I just told you.

53
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,865
The cab's gonna be here
any minute.

54
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,134
He can wait.

55
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,936
<i>And she's done it!</i>

56
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,740
<i>What a great performance
from the American.</i>

57
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,240
Can you please shut that off?

58
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,576
<i>All the way from...</i>

59
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,678
I was going to
right after her run.

60
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,378
No, I don't care, okay?
I just want to go.

61
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,781
I'm on a schedule.

62
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:08,783
Okay. Then I'll drive you.

63
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:11,753
You don't need to drive me.

64
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,888
You know you can tell me
anything, right?

65
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:17,158
Stop putting your shoes on.

66
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:25,133
I saw your deposits.

67
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,001
4200?

68
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,872
I got paid.

69
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:33,608
You were paid a third of that.
I saw the listing, honey.

70
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,179
- Is it a sugar daddy?
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom...

71
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,947
Or if it's one of those
OnlyFans things,

72
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:41,015
I will just say this:

73
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,450
It lasts forever, Sophie.

74
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:46,254
He's here.

75
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,089
And it's called
getting a tip, okay?

76
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,858
If the owners get back home
and the place isn't trashed

77
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:52,059
or their pets aren't dead,

78
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:53,995
then they pull out
another wad of cash.

79
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:55,863
Can I go?

80
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,535
Thank you.

81
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:04,105
That's a hell of a tip.

82
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,207
Yeah, well, they're rich.
What do you want?

83
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,377
You think it's charity.

84
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,613
I didn't say that.

85
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,616
I'm sorry. Look, just...

86
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,886
Let me drive you, it's silly
to waste money on a cab.

87
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,453
I'm not, the owner is.

88
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:25,492
Do you have everything?

89
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:27,161
Gloves? Hat?

90
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:28,328
Yes.

91
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:33,201
Can I have a hug at least?

92
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:37,672
Come here.

93
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:42,810
I worry. Okay?

94
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,813
One day, you won't
hold that against me.

95
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:48,415
I'm gonna be late.

96
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,585
Yeah.

97
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:57,859
Be safe.

98
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,317
<i>Hey, sweetie. You okay?</i>

99
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:05,086
Can I call you back?

100
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,355
<i>You were supposed to call me
when you got there.</i>

101
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:08,966
<i>I hadn't heard from you,
so I got worried.</i>

102
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,925
I'm fine. I'm almost there.

103
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,094
<i>Okay. You have
your charger, right?</i>

104
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,638
<i>You know you can call me
if you need anything.</i>

105
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:17,465
- Mom.
- <i>Okay, okay, just last thing.</i>

106
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,966
<i>Check my email.</i>

107
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,568
<i>There's this new app
I heard about</i>

108
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:23,004
<i>and it could be...
handy in case you need...</i>

109
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:25,573
- Okay, I'll check it out.
- <i>No, really, I think...</i>

110
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:26,984
<i>I think it's perfect for you,
sweetie.</i>

111
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,518
- <i>If you get stuck and...</i>
- Hello? Mom?

112
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,945
You're breaking up. We must be
in the mountains or something.

113
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,681
<i>Well, I hear you fine.
How about now?</i>

114
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:34,815
- Hello?
- <i>Sophie?</i>

115
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,584
Hello, Mom?
I'll call you back, okay?

116
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:37,651
<i>Can you hear...</i>

117
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,654
I got bars if you want mine.

118
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:42,523
I'm good.

119
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:43,860
- Can I take these for you?
- I got it. Thanks.

120
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:44,952
Okay.

121
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,788
Uh, where's the front door?

122
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:49,657
Oh, it's just... it's just...

123
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,092
You... Just tell me.

124
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,596
Yeah, right there,
straight ahead.

125
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:56,664
Okay.

126
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,433
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

127
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:08,109
There's, uh...
There's just a little step...

128
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:09,511
Yep. I got it.

129
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:10,579
Okay.

130
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:18,819
- Sophie. Hi.
- Hi.

131
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:20,754
Uh, please come in.
Come in. Uh...

132
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:22,223
- Yep, this way.
- Okay.

133
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:23,800
- You good?
- Yeah. Sorry I'm a bit late.

134
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,693
Um, would you mind
grabbing my bags for me?

135
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,294
I'll be right back
in a second, okay?

136
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:28,462
Thank you.

137
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,300
All right, so I'll make it quick

138
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:34,935
because I'm late for my flight.

139
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,172
The security system code is
7-4-2-6-7.

140
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,383
- Do you need me to show you?
- I'll get it.

141
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,843
Okay. So job number one.

142
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:46,347
Archie. Come here, baby,
come to Mama.

143
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,485
Oh, uh, careful 'cause
he's allergic to...

144
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,821
Gluten. Yeah.
I called your vet before I left.

145
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:55,489
That is so great.

146
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,526
And here I was, worried.

147
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,160
Why?

148
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:00,828
Oh. No, I just mean...

149
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,297
everything was so last minute,
you know,

150
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,666
and you were the only one
that responded in time

151
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:06,734
on the website.

152
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,538
So, uh, what's the occasion,

153
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,704
business or pleasure?

154
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,072
Uh, pleasure.

155
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,341
Fresh off a divorce.

156
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,010
Filled out the paperwork
yesterday.

157
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,014
Sorry to hear that.

158
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:25,753
Oh, don't be.

159
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:28,989
If anything, it was a good
training ground, you know?

160
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:33,194
I married older for maturity,
not for money.

161
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,030
Found out he has neither.

162
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:37,998
That was great.

163
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,467
Uh, anyway, look.

164
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:42,369
All of Archie's food
is in the pantry.

165
00:11:42,637 --> 00:11:43,771
I can show you where it is.

166
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,105
No, I'll find it. Thanks.

167
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:48,776
Okay, just do me a favor.

168
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:49,944
Don't overdo the treats.

169
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,780
Um, his box and his toys
are in the den.

170
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:56,217
And, oh, yes. The breaker box
and the thermostat

171
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,253
are in the utility room
next to the laundry room.

172
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:02,741
And the guest room's all ready
for you, just down the hall.

173
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:05,892
- Why don't I show you?
- No, that's okay, I'll find it.

174
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:08,929
Of course, you will.

175
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,966
Well, you have my number, so...

176
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,439
Archie, honey, Mommy will be
home soon, okay?

177
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,408
<i>Ciao.</i>

178
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,612
Have a safe flight.

179
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:52,439
Monitor.

180
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,180
Video call, Cam.

181
00:13:03,752 --> 00:13:06,020
- <i>Hey!</i>
- What's up, loser?

182
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,955
<i>How's the crib?</i>

183
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,491
You tell me.

184
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,762
<i>Uh, high ceilings.</i>

185
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:15,664
<i>Skylight.</i>

186
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,533
<i>Marble floors.</i>

187
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:19,867
<i>Bougie as fuck.</i>

188
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,878
Better be. I didn't come
all the way out here

189
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,037
for a log cabin.

190
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,540
Can I go straight, this way?

191
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:27,207
- <i>Yes, you can.</i>
- Yeah?

192
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,343
<i>Um, you have a footstool
coming up ahead.</i>

193
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:30,844
- Okay.
- <i>Three feet and closing,</i>

194
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:31,879
<i>step to your left.</i>

195
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:34,982
- Good?
- <i>You're good.</i>

196
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,652
<i>We got a deerskin rug.</i>

197
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,954
<i>Post-modern chandelier.</i>

198
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,324
<i>Lots of wood. Chalet vibes.</i>

199
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:45,092
I heard my voice traveling.

200
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,860
<i>Yeah, there's an open partition.</i>

201
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,962
<i>Kitchen, and through that
a family room, I guess.</i>

202
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,666
<i>Oh, head's up. You got a...
a wall just ahead of you.</i>

203
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,734
<i>Big painting on it.</i>

204
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,201
Anything famous?

205
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,336
<i>What am I, cultured?</i>

206
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,438
You really shouldn't
take it for granted.

207
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:01,041
<i>Okay, kitchen ahead.</i>

208
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:03,377
<i>The island is on your right.</i>

209
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:05,513
<i>Two steps.</i>

210
00:14:06,548 --> 00:14:07,682
<i>Okay, you're good.</i>

211
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:08,717
<i>You're in the kitchen.</i>

212
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,686
<i>Uh, you got some couches.</i>

213
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:13,722
<i>Fireplace.</i>

214
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:18,158
<i>And floor to ceiling windows
with a great view.</i>

215
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:19,927
View of what?

216
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,564
Nothing. Just nature.

217
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,236
<i>Okay, on your left,</i>

218
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,405
<i>you have, um, stairs leading to</i>

219
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,273
<i>what looks like an open room.</i>

220
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,545
<i>And a... a hallway.</i>

221
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,114
<i>Pick one.</i>

222
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,519
Hallway.

223
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:46,420
<i>Okay, you've got some stairs
ahead of you.</i>

224
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,055
<i>Railing's on your left.</i>

225
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,624
- <i>Careful.</i>
- I'm fine.

226
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,031
<i>Okay, you're reaching the end
to a landing.</i>

227
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,703
<i>And you're there.</i>

228
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:05,973
What's over here?

229
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,675
<i>Looks like a greenhouse.</i>

230
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,377
<i>Plants everywhere,
like a solarium, I guess.</i>

231
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:11,746
Cool.

232
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,985
<i>Oh, wait. Another set of
stairs. Careful.</i>

233
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:28,274
<i>It's too dark, I can't see.</i>

234
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:30,732
Flashlight.

235
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:34,636
- Good?
- <i>Good.</i>

236
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,905
<i>You got a narrow hallway with
a few doors on your right.</i>

237
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,071
Okay.

238
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,244
<i>Pantry.</i>

239
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,121
<i>Water heater.</i>

240
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:00,929
Cam?

241
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,030
Hello?

242
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,198
<i>Poor connection.</i>

243
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:06,734
<i>Soph, you there?</i>

244
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:09,036
Yeah, sorry, I had a bad
connection for a second.

245
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:12,105
What's this?

246
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,173
<i>Wine cellar.</i>

247
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:14,642
Sweet.

248
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:28,590
What do we got?

249
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:33,060
<i>Uh, Chambertin Grand Cru, 1989.</i>

250
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:35,897
I don't hear any Googling.

251
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:38,999
<i>$4500.</i>

252
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,969
Perfect. Still petty.

253
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,002
<i>You should put it back.</i>

254
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:44,071
She's not gonna miss one.

255
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,207
<i>I told you,
I can't keep doing this.</i>

256
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,910
You're not, you're just...

257
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,043
pointing the way.

258
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,581
Then I walk out with it,
then list it.

259
00:16:53,615 --> 00:16:55,583
<i>And then I help you sell it.</i>

260
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:56,885
<i>You couldn't do it without me</i>

261
00:16:56,918 --> 00:16:58,586
<i>and that makes me
just as guilty.</i>

262
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,620
<i>Last place was two grand,
it was three before that.</i>

263
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:03,056
<i>I only went along</i>

264
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,570
<i>'cause I thought
you needed the money.</i>

265
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:08,696
<i>You think being blind
is gonna save you?</i>

266
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:12,499
Yeah. It always saves me.

267
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:15,904
You'd know that if you saw
how they treated me.

268
00:17:15,937 --> 00:17:17,177
<i>You walk out with it, I'm done.</i>

269
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,774
What does that mean?

270
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:22,635
<i>You know the last time
we talked...</i>

271
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,313
<i>the last house... a month ago...</i>

272
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,506
Yeah, what the fuck else are we
supposed to talk about?

273
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,194
The fact that you're on a hill
right now and I'm not?

274
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,486
<i>You could be, right behind me.</i>

275
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,964
Okay, well, why don't you
go down a mountain

276
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:36,624
at 110 blindfolded
and then talk to me.

277
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:38,425
<i>You have the courage
to rob a house</i>

278
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,028
<i>but not to let me guide you
down a hill?</i>

279
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,395
Fuck you!

280
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,438
<i>Are you putting it back or not?</i>

281
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,404
Don't worry, I can't do it
without you, right?

282
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:51,437
<i>Soph...</i>

283
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,245
<i>From Paralympics USA.</i>

284
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,948
<i>Subject, Reminder:</i>

285
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:01,783
<i>Deadline for upcoming

286
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:03,785
- Delete.
- <i>Message deleted.</i>

287
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:06,754
<i>From Mom. Subject: See For Me.</i>

288
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:09,089
<i>How cool is this? Love you, Mom.</i>

289
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:11,224
<i>See For Me.</i>

290
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:14,328
<i>A new app for the blind
and visually impaired.</i>

00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,396
<i>Connect to a sighted helper
on demand</i>

292
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,332
<i>for visual assistance

293
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,001
- Delete.
- <i>Message deleted.</i>

294
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,117
I put it back, all right?

295
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,151
<i>Put what back?</i>

296
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:41,154
Nothing. Hi, Debra.

297
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:43,591
<i>Hey, uh, so listen.
I'm just checking in.</i>

298
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,660
<i>Just wanted to see if
you, uh... you fed Archie.</i>

299
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,160
- Yep.
- <i>Great.</i>

300
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:48,963
<i>And did you arm
the security system?</i>

301
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,465
I was just about to.

302
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,703
<i>Why don't we do that together?</i>

303
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:57,437
<i>It would just make me feel
a lot better.</i>

304
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,474
Absolutely.

305
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:09,017
<i>Sophie?</i>

306
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,985
<i>We could video call
if that helps.</i>

307
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:13,353
Uh, no, I got it, I'm good.

308
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:16,189
<i>Okay.</i>

309
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:19,727

00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:22,262
<i>You're great.</i>

312
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:24,398
<i>Call me if you
need anything. Okay?</i>

313
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:25,967
- Sure thing, Debra.
- <i>Bye.</i>

314
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:48,990

How can I help you?</i>

329
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:37,138
Yeah, I locked myself out.

330
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:38,706
Do you see a way
to get back inside?

331
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,842

are just gonna have to pay</i>

00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:56,691

Take the higher ground on
the right, use your cover.

<i>Let's get these motherfuckers.</i>

<i>- Oh, please.
- Fuck off!</i>

352
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:29,891
<i>Jesus Christ. Chill!</i>

353
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:36,931
Taking five. You guys are
on your own.

354
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,135
Hey, what can I do for you?

355
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,402
<i>Hi, I'm locked out.</i>

356
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:43,795
<i>Do you see a way
I can get back in?</i>

357
00:21:44,772 --> 00:21:46,841
Uh, is there somebody
that you could call?

358
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:49,010
I'm talking to you, aren't I?

359
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:54,048
Uh, you are because
you called me.

360
00:21:54,782 --> 00:21:56,449
Hold on a second here.

361
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:03,891
All right, can you
show me around a little bit?

362
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:05,526
Uh...

363
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,829
<i>just slowly pan
from left to right.</i>

364
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:13,234
Yeah, I don't see
an easy way in.

365
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,036
I think you might have to
call the cops.

366
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,705
I knew this was a waste of time.

367
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:20,407
Look, my last call on here
was telling a guy

368
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,777
the expiration date
on his milk, okay?

369
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,580
This isn't exactly
routine for me.

370
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:26,933
<i>Now, do you want to
get in or not?</i>

371
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:28,850
Yeah, I just...

372
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:31,351
I just want to do it myself.

373
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:34,021
Copy.

374
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:36,991
Okay, uh...

375
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:40,928
do you know if there's any
unlocked doors or windows,

376
00:22:40,962 --> 00:22:42,997
preferably on the ground floor?

377
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,065
<i>I don't know.</i>

378
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:46,734
This isn't my house,
I'm just cat sitting.

379
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:50,037
Okay. Uh, let's move around
the perimeter.

380
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:52,240
Can you angle your phone
at 9:00?

381
00:22:55,076 --> 00:22:56,277
- Over here?
- <i>Good.</i>

382
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,179
<i>Okay, you're okay.</i>

383
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,514
<i>Keep going.</i>

384
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:03,017
You're doing great.

385
00:23:03,985 --> 00:23:06,354
Keep going.

386
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,089
<i>Okay, good,
now just hug the wall.</i>

387
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:10,591
<i>Good.</i>

388
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,026
<i>Great, keep going.</i>

389
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:14,528
Yep. All right, now you're at
a set of stairs.

390
00:23:14,562 --> 00:23:16,864
There's six steps and
a railing on your right.

391
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:19,600
<i>Good.</i>

392
00:23:19,634 --> 00:23:20,968
<i>All right, down another.</i>

393
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:23,537
<i>You're doing great.</i>

394
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,941
<i>Okay, at the bottom of
the steps,</i>

395
00:23:26,974 --> 00:23:28,709
<i>there's a walkway about 40 feet</i>

396
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:30,211
<i>and there's
nothing ahead of you.</i>

397
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:32,747
<i>Great.</i>

398
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:35,092
Can you hold the phone steady?
It's just shaking a bit.

399
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:37,251
Yeah, I'm freezing and
I don't have my cane

400
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:38,686
so I can't go up steps fast.

401
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:41,355
I... I hear you but I still
need to see, all right?

402
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:44,058
You're doing fine,
just... just go slow.

403
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:46,627
All right? And take your time.

404
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:49,263
<i>Uh, okay, stop there.
Angle the phone down a bit.</i>

405
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:51,332
Oh... Split the difference.
Little bit too much.

406
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:53,734
All right, you're right in front
of a sliding glass door.

407
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:54,802
Can you feel it?

408
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:00,107
It's locked.

409
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,085
Yeah, but there's no rod
so this could work.

410
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,011
So you're gonna need
two hands for this,

411
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:05,605
<i>so can you put your phone
on the ground?</i>

412
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:06,948
Seriously?

413
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:08,416
Trust me, all right?

414
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,217
You're gonna put one hand
on the handle,

415
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:11,986
and you're gonna place
your other hand

416
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:13,020
<i>firmly on the glass pane.</i>

417
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:15,488
<i>You're gonna push in,</i>

418
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:16,857
<i>and you're gonna rock the door</i>

419
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:18,292
<i>up and down, up and down.</i>

420
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:19,860
<i>All right?</i>

421
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:21,694
<i>We're gonna try to
dislodge it from the track.</i>

422
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:24,165
[Sophie grunting.

423
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:26,400
It's not working.

424
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:28,903
<i>Just trust me. Keep going.</i>

425
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:30,771
<i>Up and down and to the left.</i>

426
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:33,107
Okay, what the hell
are we doing here?

427
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:35,810
Uh, I'm helping
a stubborn blind girl

428
00:24:35,843 --> 00:24:37,554
break into a house that
may or may not be hers.

429
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:38,779
How about you?

430
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:40,390
Yeah, well, I'm down on my
hands and knees

431
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:42,149
getting trolled by
some random...

432
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:51,659
You were saying?

433
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:53,027
No shit.

434
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:55,863
Oh, shit!

435
00:24:56,864 --> 00:24:58,833
Hey, I'm right here.
I'm right here.

436
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:03,404
Oh... Plant, 12:00.

437
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:05,806
Oh, shit!

438
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,400
Twelve o'clock means
right ahead of you.

439
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,889
<i>You're good. To the right,
to the right to the right.</i>

440
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,648
Okay, keep going, there's
stairs in front of you.

441
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:16,517
Right, right there. Yeah.

442
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,918
<i>Okay, a few more.</i>

443
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:22,490
Keep going, try to
hold the phone steady.

444
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:23,858
<i>Okay, there's stairs
to your left.</i>

445
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,271
Yeah, it's right ahead of you.
Okay, good, good, good.

446
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:29,330
Up, up, up, up. Up.

447
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:39,106
<i>System disarmed.</i>

448
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:42,676
<i>Yes!</i>

449
00:25:43,512 --> 00:25:44,612
Mission accomplished.

450
00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:46,280
Nice trick.

451
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:50,051
Most people wouldn't be
so quick to...

452
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:52,586
help a stranger
break into a house.

453
00:25:53,888 --> 00:25:55,790
Well, I didn't exactly
take you for a criminal,

454
00:25:55,823 --> 00:25:57,058
if that's what you're saying.

455
00:25:57,992 --> 00:26:01,362
Or, wait. Am I now
an accessory to a B and E?

456
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:03,416
You don't sound
too worried about that.

457
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,400
Yeah, well, I've done worse.

458
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,249
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

459
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:12,873
Uh, no, I'm good.

460
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:14,408

00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:16,277

488
00:34:15,023 --> 00:34:16,290
We've got a problem.

489
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:18,191
I think someone's here.

What? What the hell
are you talkin' about?

491
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:24,566
Stick to the plan.
Until we hear from him.

<i>9-1-1, what's your emergency?</i>

494
00:35:34,736 --> 00:35:37,872
There's people in the house.
I'm at Six Golden Lane.

495
00:35:37,905 --> 00:35:39,439
<i>Okay. Do they know
you're in the house?</i>

496
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:41,109
I think so.

<i>And did you see the intruders?</i>

498
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:44,253

and their in the house,

00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:47,515
<i>Okay, stay calm.

501
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:49,449
How long?

502
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:51,753
<i>Given your location,
I can't be sure exactly</i>

503
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:53,387
<i>but I'll be here with you

Wait, what's wrong?

513
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:00,922
There's people in the house.

<i>Are you sure?</i>

515
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,525
Yeah, I heard them,
I heard their voices.

516
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:06,961
What's your location?
I'll call the cops.

517
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:08,196
<i>No, I already did that.</i>

518
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:11,032
Okay, um...

519
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:12,800
Just stay calm.

520
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:14,301
Stay exactly where you are,

521
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:15,937
let them take
whatever they want.

522
00:37:16,504 --> 00:37:17,744
I think they're looking for me.

523
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:20,474
How many of them are there?

524
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:22,877
At least two.

525
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,078
<i>Are you sure?</i>

526
00:37:24,112 --> 00:37:25,947
Yes, I'm sure, there's
two different voices.

527
00:37:27,081 --> 00:37:28,583
Okay, Sophie,
where are they now?

528
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:39,160
Close.

529
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:19,700
Sophie.

530
00:38:19,734 --> 00:38:20,802
<i>You're too exposed,</i>

531
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:22,369
we need to get you to
the basement,

532
00:38:22,402 --> 00:38:24,522
somewhere where you can hide
until the cops get there.

533
00:38:24,672 --> 00:38:25,907
And trap myself down there?

534
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,575
No, I need to
get out of here now.

535
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:30,745
Okay, just go slowly,
keep panning.

536
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:33,181
I need to see angles
before we move, okay?

537
00:38:37,051 --> 00:38:38,686
<i>All right,
you're coming to a turn.</i>

538
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,720
<i>Stop.</i>

539
00:38:40,254 --> 00:38:41,289
Let me see.

540
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,994
All right.

541
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:49,597
You've got one guy

542
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,199
in the foyer

543
00:38:51,232 --> 00:38:53,400
<i>past the door on the far wall.</i>

544
00:38:56,304 --> 00:38:57,446
No, no, no, you can't go
back that way.

545
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,873
No, the other guy's there.

546
00:38:58,906 --> 00:38:59,907
<i>Show me the wall.</i>

547
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:03,044
<i>Oh, door, 10:00.</i>

548
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:22,597
<i>Okay, bring your phone up</i>

549
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,031
<i>and then pan
left to right for me.</i>

550
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:26,067
Okay.

551
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,870
We got one guy drilling,
facing the wall.

552
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:32,540
That hallway at 11:00
goes away from both of them.

553
00:39:32,573 --> 00:39:34,374
If you stay down,

554
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:35,408
<i>you can make it.</i>

555
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:37,678
I know where the front door is.

556
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:42,283
I'm gonna go for it.

557
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:44,185
No, no, Sophie. Not the door.

558
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:47,955
Shit!

559
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:50,057
<i>Ten o'clock.</i>

560
00:39:55,596 --> 00:39:57,064
- Hey.
- Yeah, you know what?

561
00:39:57,098 --> 00:39:58,842
This would go a lot faster
if I had some help.

562
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:01,702
Yeah. Well, there's
definitely someone here.

563
00:40:01,936 --> 00:40:03,304
What?

564
00:40:07,308 --> 00:40:08,309
<i>You're early.</i>

565
00:40:08,843 --> 00:40:10,311
There's someone else
in the house.

566
00:40:11,012 --> 00:40:12,146
<i>Impossible.</i>

567
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:14,048
There's someone here.

568
00:40:15,116 --> 00:40:16,617
<i>Search it,</i>

569
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:18,753
<i>room by room, top to bottom.</i>

570
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:25,226
Copy.

571
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:28,162
Keep drilling.
I'm sweeping the place.

572
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:29,230
Hey, hey, hey.

573
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:31,508
If someone's here,
we're not supposed to be.

574
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:33,010
He said the place was gonna be
fuckin' empty.

575
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:35,102
He said keep drilling.

576
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:40,741
Fuck.

577
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:45,613
Okay, come on.

578
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:46,847
He's drilling again.

579
00:40:47,415 --> 00:40:48,582
Is the other one gone?

580
00:40:50,618 --> 00:40:52,987
I think so, just... just
hold there a second.

581
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:55,656
I'm going for it.

582
00:40:56,057 --> 00:40:57,191
No, no, no, Sophie...

583
00:40:57,224 --> 00:40:58,458
Sophie, just slow down,

584
00:40:58,491 --> 00:40:59,627
<i>I need to see.</i>

585
00:41:04,899 --> 00:41:06,133
Wait. Sophie, wait!

586
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:08,069
Sophie!

587
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:11,706
Sophie.

588
00:41:14,942 --> 00:41:17,278
Sophie! Sophie, can you hear me?

589
00:41:19,981 --> 00:41:20,982
Fuck.

590
00:41:23,985 --> 00:41:25,319
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

591
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:26,821
Hey!

592
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:28,923
Shut your fuckin' mouth.

593
00:41:28,956 --> 00:41:30,391
What the hell
are you doing, man?

594
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:35,696
Shh!

595
00:41:54,148 --> 00:41:56,017
Go get her things.
They're in the bedroom.

596
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:06,193
<i>Speak.</i>

597
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:08,529
She dialed 9-1-112 minutes ago.

598
00:42:08,562 --> 00:42:09,563
<i>Response time?</i>

599
00:42:09,797 --> 00:42:11,866
We timed it at 22,
19 to be safe,

600
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:13,934
that gives us... seven.

601
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,104
<i>Let her go.</i>

602
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:27,882
<i>Who are you?</i>

603
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:30,017
Just take what you want and go,
I won't say anything.

604
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:32,920
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

605
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:34,622
Cat sitting.

606
00:42:36,991 --> 00:42:38,626
- Six minutes.
- Yeah.

607
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,961
We need to go. We gotta go.

608
00:42:41,662 --> 00:42:43,397
Please, this wasn't the plan.

609
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:46,267
<i>No one's going anywhere.</i>

610
00:42:46,734 --> 00:42:48,302
We need to off her right now.

611
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:50,071
You can just go.
I don't know anything.

612
00:42:50,505 --> 00:42:51,872
She's seen our faces.

613
00:42:51,906 --> 00:42:53,074
No, I haven't!

614
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:56,210
I'm blind.

615
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:02,950
ID.

616
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,395
<i>Sophie Scott.</i>

617
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:20,468
<i>"Hm. " The diagnosis of
retinitis pigmentosa</i>

618
00:43:20,501 --> 00:43:23,572
<i>dashes the Olympic dreams of
top under-18 female skier."</i>

619
00:43:24,371 --> 00:43:25,406
<i>Bring me in close.</i>

620
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:35,915
<i>There's nothin' left in there.</i>

621
00:43:36,984 --> 00:43:38,018
No.

622
00:43:38,953 --> 00:43:40,788
Just light perception.

623
00:43:40,821 --> 00:43:42,223
<i>No shit.</i>

624
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:44,024
<i>All right, pack it up,
make it spotless.</i>

625
00:43:44,058 --> 00:43:45,326
<i>Tail lights in two.</i>

626
00:43:45,594 --> 00:43:46,794
Just gonna leave her here?

627
00:43:46,827 --> 00:43:47,862
<i>She's not a problem.</i>

628
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:50,264
- Four minutes.
- But she knows.

629
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:52,500
<i>No names, no faces.
She's useless.</i>

630
00:43:52,534 --> 00:43:53,767
<i>No offense, Sophie.</i>

631
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:55,402
When she tells the cops
we were here,

632
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:56,704
it's game over.

633
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:58,973
<i>And if she goes missing?</i>

634
00:43:59,006 --> 00:44:00,941
<i>Lost blind girl in the woods?</i>

635
00:44:00,975 --> 00:44:02,511
<i>They'll comb the property
for weeks.</i>

636
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,454
But you said
you're the only other person

637
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:05,880
who knows that it's here.

638
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:08,883
We should go because we could
always come back.

639
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:11,452
It won't still be here if we do.

640
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:13,622
Do you want to kiss
7 million goodbye?

641
00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:15,823
<i>We have no time.</i>

642
00:44:15,856 --> 00:44:17,324
<i>It's a risk we have to take.</i>

643
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:19,994
He's right.
We need to go now, guys.

644
00:44:20,294 --> 00:44:21,962
It's tonight or it's never.

645
00:44:21,996 --> 00:44:23,565
It's that fuckin' simple.

646
00:44:23,598 --> 00:44:25,065
<i>What choice do we fuckin' have?</i>

647
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:27,067
- <i>The cops'll be there...</i>
- I can do it.

648
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:42,584
I can get rid of the cops.

649
00:44:43,552 --> 00:44:44,592
I'll say it was a mistake.

650
00:44:46,086 --> 00:44:47,188
<i>And why would you do that?</i>

651
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:49,323
I want an equal share.

652
00:44:50,991 --> 00:44:52,026
<i>I'm listening.</i>

653
00:44:52,993 --> 00:44:55,564
And I want you to prove
you won't hurt me.

654
00:44:55,597 --> 00:44:58,165
<i>I told you,
you are not a witness.</i>

655
00:44:58,465 --> 00:45:00,334
Just say it. All of it.

656
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:02,836
<i>Say what?</i>

657
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,338
I get rid of the cops,

658
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:06,073
then...

659
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:07,841
<i>Then we finish
and give you your share.</i>

660
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:09,443
<i>Five percent.</i>

661
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:12,547
<i>Ten, 15 minutes,
then we're done.</i>

662
00:45:14,448 --> 00:45:16,483
<i>And you'll never see...</i>

663
00:45:16,518 --> 00:45:17,918
<i>You'll never hear from us again.</i>

664
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:20,087
What about Debra?

665
00:45:20,988 --> 00:45:23,057
When she gets back,
she's gonna know.

666
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,626
<i>It will look like
we were never here.</i>

667
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:26,160
<i>You don't have to
worry about her.</i>

668
00:45:26,193 --> 00:45:27,962
<i>Just leave when you're
supposed to.</i>

669
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:30,532
What if the cops come and
she changes her mind.

670
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:31,832
I won't.

671
00:45:31,865 --> 00:45:33,067
How do we know that?

672
00:45:33,668 --> 00:45:34,735
Look in my bag.

673
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,077
4500 retail.

674
00:45:44,345 --> 00:45:45,545
I was gonna sell it for three.

675
00:45:47,314 --> 00:45:49,551
<i>No, no you didn't.</i>

676
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:51,586
Who's gonna suspect
the little blind girl, right?

677
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,054
Three minutes.

678
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:58,959
<i>Make the call.</i>

679
00:46:01,795 --> 00:46:02,997
<i>On speaker, please.</i>

680
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:16,410
<i>9-1-1, what's your emergency?</i>

681
00:46:18,245 --> 00:46:21,015
I, uh...

682
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:22,082
<i>Hello?</i>

683
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:27,589
My name is Sophie Scott.
I'm at Six Golden Lane.

684
00:46:27,821 --> 00:46:29,923
I called earlier and reported
a home invasion.

685
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:31,693
It was a false alarm.

686
00:46:31,726 --> 00:46:32,761
<i>Are you sure?</i>

687
00:46:32,926 --> 00:46:34,696
Yeah, I made a mistake.
There's no one here.

688
00:46:37,264 --> 00:46:39,133
I'm blind. I thought
I heard something,

689
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:41,001
but I forgot I left the TV on.

690
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:42,671
It's stupid, I know.

691
00:46:44,673 --> 00:46:46,353
<i>I'm glad to hear
everything's okay, Sophie.</i>

692
00:46:48,075 --> 00:46:49,511
<i>An officer will be
arriving shortly</i>

693
00:46:49,544 --> 00:46:50,612
<i>to check in and confirm.</i>

694
00:46:51,312 --> 00:46:53,881
But I just said I'm fine,
I don't need anyone.

695
00:46:53,914 --> 00:46:55,949
<i>It's required by law that
we send a responder,</i>

696
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:57,117
<i>even if it's a mistake.</i>

697
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:59,186
<i>They'll be there soon.</i>

698
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:01,059
<i>Is there anything else
I can do for you, ma'am?</i>

699
00:47:01,188 --> 00:47:03,525
No. No, that's it. Thanks.

700
00:47:05,025 --> 00:47:06,160
Fuck.

701
00:47:06,427 --> 00:47:07,971
It's not my fault.
I didn't know they were g...

702
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:09,430
<i>Relax, you did great.</i>

703
00:47:09,463 --> 00:47:10,831
<i>They were never gonna
turn around.</i>

704
00:47:10,864 --> 00:47:12,066
<i>You just set it up.</i>

705
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:13,867
<i>Now is when you nail it.</i>

706
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:15,537
<i>You can do that, right, Sophie?</i>

707
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,572
- I can do it.
- <i>You sure?</i>

708
00:47:17,605 --> 00:47:19,583
<i>Last chance to back out.
If you think it's too much...</i>

709
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:20,687
I said I can fucking do it.

710
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:23,210
<i>Good.</i>

711
00:47:23,243 --> 00:47:25,145
<i>O, get back to your perch,
give us a head's up.</i>

712
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:26,890
<i>D, move all of the equipment
into the vehicles.</i>

713
00:47:26,914 --> 00:47:28,349
<i>And E, lights off.</i>

714
00:47:33,621 --> 00:47:34,756
Scott.

715
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:37,759
Sierra, Charlie, Oscar,
Tango, Tango.

716
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:40,127
<i>Now, you said
you've never met her?</i>

717
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,929
I was just talking to her.

718
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,264
Look.

719
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:47,635
How many blind, female,
teenage ex skiers

720
00:47:47,669 --> 00:47:48,837
do you think there are?

721
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:50,638
This has to be her.

722
00:47:50,672 --> 00:47:52,607
<i>Ma'am, I understand
your distress,</i>

723
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,676
<i>but I can't forward this to
another department</i>

724
00:47:54,709 --> 00:47:56,276
<i>without knowing her location.</i>

725
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:59,279
Look, her last Twitter post
puts her in New York. Okay?

726
00:47:59,313 --> 00:48:01,850
She's in a rural mansion,
likely upstate,

727
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:04,952
and she's already made a
9-1-1 call for a home invasion.

728
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:08,222
You need to get a hold of
every department north of NYC

729
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:09,824
to cross check that call,

730
00:48:09,858 --> 00:48:12,560
and let them know there are
three hostiles, minimum.

731
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:29,711
On site, one car.

732
00:48:31,111 --> 00:48:32,279
Copy.

733
00:48:33,947 --> 00:48:36,350
<i>Sophie, listen to me.
Don't shake him off like</i>

734
00:48:36,383 --> 00:48:37,985
<i>the guy who grabs your arm
on the subway.</i>

735
00:48:38,018 --> 00:48:39,687
<i>Let them think they helped,</i>

736
00:48:39,721 --> 00:48:42,089
<i>so they can walk the fuck out
happy with themselves.</i>

737
00:48:42,122 --> 00:48:43,223
<i>You got it?</i>

738
00:48:46,694 --> 00:48:48,897
<i>Comin' up the driveway,
one minute.</i>

739
00:48:50,297 --> 00:48:51,566
Copy that.

740
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:57,137
You good?

741
00:49:52,459 --> 00:49:53,962
Police.

742
00:49:54,596 --> 00:49:56,063
Hello?

743
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:58,465
Hello. This is Deputy Brooks
from the Sheriff's station.

744
00:49:58,499 --> 00:49:59,534
Who am I speaking with?

745
00:50:00,434 --> 00:50:01,468
Sophie.

746
00:50:01,936 --> 00:50:03,671
You mind opening the door
for me, Sophie?

747
00:50:05,807 --> 00:50:08,208
I... I made a mistake,
I called back and explained it.

748
00:50:08,676 --> 00:50:09,911
It was just an accident.

749
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,347
You accidentally called 9-1-1

750
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,048
and reported a home invasion?

751
00:50:15,783 --> 00:50:17,284
Yeah,
I thought I heard something

752
00:50:17,317 --> 00:50:18,653
and I overreacted.

753
00:50:20,454 --> 00:50:21,856
Could you open the door, please?

754
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:24,391
I'm not allowed to.

755
00:50:26,393 --> 00:50:27,562
Says who?

756
00:50:28,228 --> 00:50:30,364
Debra. The homeowner.

757
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:32,767
She hired me to
look after her house,

758
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,368
and she said
I shouldn't let anyone in.

759
00:50:35,537 --> 00:50:36,938
I'm a police officer.

760
00:50:40,675 --> 00:50:43,243
Sophie, one way or another,
I'm coming inside.

761
00:50:55,422 --> 00:50:56,456
Hi.

762
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:58,292
Evening.

763
00:50:59,092 --> 00:51:00,695
Like I said,
it was just a mistake.

764
00:51:02,095 --> 00:51:03,130
Okay.

765
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:05,999
I'll be out of your hair
in no time.

766
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:14,207
House sitting, huh?

767
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:16,209
Cat sitting, actually.

768
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,825
I'm more of
a dog person, myself.

769
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:33,946
Still beats sitting in
a car all night.

770
00:51:35,063 --> 00:51:37,065
It's nice and warm in here.

771
00:51:37,765 --> 00:51:39,667
Good place to hide out
from this cold front.

772
00:51:43,403 --> 00:51:44,939
So, you want to give me
the grand tour?

773
00:51:46,608 --> 00:51:48,342
There's not much to see.

774
00:51:50,979 --> 00:51:52,013
That was a joke.

775
00:52:03,323 --> 00:52:04,592
You said you heard voices?

776
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:08,428
Uh, yeah, I... I forgot
I left the TV on.

777
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:11,532
You mistook the TV for
people in the house?

778
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:16,004
I also might have been
a little drunk.

779
00:52:36,024 --> 00:52:37,692
It's a big house.

780
00:52:38,993 --> 00:52:40,928
Is it possible maybe
someone did break in,

781
00:52:40,962 --> 00:52:43,002
but then they left when they
realized you were here?

782
00:52:43,097 --> 00:52:44,132
No.

783
00:53:43,157 --> 00:53:44,257
What's going on here?

784
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:46,094
What?

785
00:53:47,028 --> 00:53:48,529
You got a panel loose.

786
00:53:49,262 --> 00:53:50,798
There's a fire hazard here.

787
00:53:52,499 --> 00:53:53,634
Oh...

788
00:53:54,168 --> 00:53:55,570
Okay, I'll let Debra know.

789
00:54:07,749 --> 00:54:08,950
I guess I'll get going, then.

790
00:54:13,286 --> 00:54:14,387
Drive safe.

791
00:54:19,961 --> 00:54:20,995
Sophie.

792
00:54:23,564 --> 00:54:26,266
Is it possible that maybe
someone was here,

793
00:54:26,768 --> 00:54:29,070
but there's a reason
you have to lie about it?

794
00:54:32,707 --> 00:54:33,775
No.

795
00:54:36,376 --> 00:54:38,646
Maybe they're still close by.

796
00:54:44,652 --> 00:54:46,429
You think I wanted to bring you
all the way out here

797
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:48,256
just so I can
embarrass myself like this?

798
00:54:49,123 --> 00:54:50,158
Please.

799
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:51,793
I'm just trying to help.

800
00:54:51,826 --> 00:54:53,027
I don't need any help.

801
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,365
Okay.

802
00:55:00,768 --> 00:55:01,803
Take care.

803
00:55:10,111 --> 00:55:11,145
That your phone?

804
00:55:12,513 --> 00:55:13,548
Yeah.

805
00:55:14,115 --> 00:55:15,149
You wanna get it?

806
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:18,119
No, it's not...

807
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,500
- Let me grab it for you.
- No, it's okay, um...

808
00:55:21,956 --> 00:55:23,456
It's a big house.

809
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:24,930
Wouldn't want
you to lose it in here.

810
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:31,699
Thanks.

811
00:55:33,534 --> 00:55:35,036
You gonna answer it or what?

812
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:37,404
No, it's...

813
00:55:37,437 --> 00:55:38,539
Might be important.

814
00:55:46,647 --> 00:55:47,682
Hello?

815
00:55:49,382 --> 00:55:51,351
Uh, yeah, pocket dial. Sorry.

816
00:55:52,987 --> 00:55:54,021
No, it's okay.

817
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:57,925
Look, Cam, sorry,
I really gotta go.

818
00:56:00,995 --> 00:56:02,163
We good, officer?

819
00:56:05,233 --> 00:56:06,934
Yeah.

820
00:56:08,636 --> 00:56:09,670
We're good.

821
00:56:14,175 --> 00:56:15,877
Sorry to bring you
all the way out here.

822
00:56:16,244 --> 00:56:17,945
Hey, shit happens. Right?

823
00:56:17,979 --> 00:56:19,180
<i>Dispatch to Victor One.</i>

824
00:56:20,147 --> 00:56:21,182
Go for Victor.

825
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:24,218
Have a good night, Sophie.

826
00:56:24,252 --> 00:56:26,320
<i>Be advised, we got
a call about your 2-11</i>

827
00:56:26,354 --> 00:56:28,122
<i>forwarded from
a Florida precinct.</i>

828
00:56:28,155 --> 00:56:29,924
<i>A woman there says
she was on a video chat</i>

829
00:56:29,957 --> 00:56:31,626
<i>with the 9-1-1 caller
during the incident.</i>

830
00:56:33,327 --> 00:56:35,529
They give a description?

831
00:56:35,563 --> 00:56:37,098
<i>At least three perpetrators.</i>

832
00:56:37,131 --> 00:56:38,900
<i>She saw one of them,
white male, mid 30s,</i>

833
00:56:38,933 --> 00:56:39,934
<i>dressed in black.</i>

834
00:56:41,702 --> 00:56:44,906
Dispatch, was there
a description of the girl?

835
00:56:46,173 --> 00:56:48,441
<i>A blind girl, Sophie.</i>

836
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,347
Stay back.

837
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:54,481
I'm sorry.

838
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:55,549
Where are they?

839
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:56,817
I don't know.

840
00:56:58,786 --> 00:57:00,087
Coming out.

841
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:02,489
Hands where I can see them!

842
00:57:03,724 --> 00:57:05,927
It's just me, it's only me.

843
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,962
- I... I'm not resisting.
- Get on the ground.

844
00:57:08,229 --> 00:57:09,263
Now!

845
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:15,468
- How many of you?
- It's just me.

846
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:17,772
Sophie, how many?

847
00:57:18,606 --> 00:57:19,941
Dispatch, this is Victor One.

848
00:57:19,974 --> 00:57:22,076
I need back up at
Six Golden Lane.

849
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:24,145
Just take me in. It's only me.

850
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,214
Sophie.

851
00:57:27,248 --> 00:57:28,916
I'm gonna ask you one last time.

852
00:57:29,216 --> 00:57:30,751
Where are they?

853
00:57:30,785 --> 00:57:33,025
There's two more of them but
I don't know where they are.

854
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:36,023
Stop!

855
00:57:37,258 --> 00:57:38,326
Ahh!

856
00:58:31,979 --> 00:58:33,914
Oh, fuck.

857
00:58:34,615 --> 00:58:35,649
Jesus Christ.

858
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:38,819
She was gonna arrest me
for a fucking B and E.

859
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:42,089
Dave could have finished.
I'd have been out in six months.

860
00:58:42,123 --> 00:58:44,792
- Fuck.
- It's a fucking misdemeanor!

861
00:58:44,825 --> 00:58:47,261
You never said anything
about this, man, this is fucked!

862
00:58:47,294 --> 00:58:49,230
Hey. You good?

863
00:58:50,498 --> 00:58:51,699
Yeah.

864
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,001
Where's the girl?

865
00:58:56,037 --> 00:58:58,372
No, wait.
Get me out of these things.

866
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:02,410
Dave.

867
00:59:03,577 --> 00:59:04,879
- Dave!
- Fuck.

868
00:59:04,912 --> 00:59:06,047
Get back to the safe.

869
00:59:06,914 --> 00:59:08,949
We've got 20 minutes before
her back up gets here.

870
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:16,290
Where's her gun?

871
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:23,564
Sophie, Sophie, are you okay?

872
00:59:23,664 --> 00:59:24,765
They killed a cop.

873
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:26,667
<i>Where are you?</i>

874
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:27,835
I'm getting out of here.

875
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:29,312
No, no, no, no,
just hold on a second.

876
00:59:29,336 --> 00:59:30,371
<i>Where are they now?</i>

877
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:32,973
I can't help you if you don't...

878
00:59:34,075 --> 00:59:35,409
You got a gun?

879
00:59:38,712 --> 00:59:40,381
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

880
00:59:40,414 --> 00:59:41,492
No, no, no, don't go outside,

881
00:59:41,516 --> 00:59:42,759
you'll be a sitting duck
out there.

882
00:59:42,783 --> 00:59:43,783
<i>Sophie, listen to me.</i>

883
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:48,923
Is there anything in my way?

884
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:51,158
It's rough terrain,
it's open ground,

885
00:59:51,192 --> 00:59:52,693
and it's too dark.

886
00:59:52,726 --> 00:59:54,428
<i>I can't see for you
if you're out here.</i>

887
01:00:05,473 --> 01:00:07,050
- <i>You're not gonna make it.</i>
- Yes, I will!

888
01:00:07,074 --> 01:00:08,577
Sophie, they're gonna kill you.

889
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:10,478
<i>Please listen to me.</i>

890
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:12,514
I swear we can do this.

891
01:00:12,947 --> 01:00:15,015
You just need to trust me.

892
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:21,155
What should I do?

893
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:37,438
Bingo.

894
01:00:47,882 --> 01:00:49,183
<i>Okay, careful.</i>

895
01:00:49,216 --> 01:00:50,651
<i>It's too dark for me
to see clearly.</i>

896
01:00:52,286 --> 01:00:53,622
Okay, go slowly.

897
01:00:57,958 --> 01:00:59,293
<i>Okay, I think you're clear</i>

898
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:01,061
<i>but I can't see the ground.</i>

899
01:01:01,095 --> 01:01:02,163
<i>Can you pan for me?</i>

900
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:06,993
<i>Sophie, Sophie, are you okay?</i>

901
01:01:12,507 --> 01:01:13,974
I lost the gun.

902
01:01:14,008 --> 01:01:15,042
Show me the ground.

903
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:18,913
Flashlight.

904
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:42,571
Okay. Two o'clock.

905
01:01:43,971 --> 01:01:45,940
Yeah, almost. Good, good.

906
01:01:55,749 --> 01:01:56,917
They're drilling again.

907
01:01:57,586 --> 01:01:59,129
Okay, but that's just one,
we need to assume

908
01:01:59,153 --> 01:02:01,121
the other two are still
looking for you, okay?

909
01:02:01,155 --> 01:02:02,356
<i>So you have to stand up.</i>

910
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,974
Flashlight.

911
01:02:20,841 --> 01:02:21,842
What is it?

912
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:23,043
Someone's coming.

913
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:24,979
Soft-shoed guy.

914
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:27,081
You have eyes on her?

915
01:02:32,621 --> 01:02:34,855
<i>Hold the gun out.</i>

916
01:02:34,888 --> 01:02:37,726
<i>I want you to feel on the side
for a little knob,</i>

917
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:39,031
<i>and tell me if it's up or down.</i>

918
01:02:40,361 --> 01:02:41,895
Uh, it's down.

919
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:43,489
<i>Okay, good, that means
the safety's off.</i>

920
01:02:50,471 --> 01:02:51,573
He's in the room.

921
01:03:04,552 --> 01:03:06,020
It's okay.

922
01:03:06,053 --> 01:03:07,921
Let him get
a little closer to you.

923
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:15,530
<i>Hold the phone steady.</i>

924
01:03:27,642 --> 01:03:29,009
- She came in...
- Now!

925
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:32,614
- Sophie.
- <i>Adjust left.</i>

926
01:03:32,647 --> 01:03:34,114
Split the difference.

927
01:03:34,148 --> 01:03:36,551
- <i>Inhale.</i>
- What are you doing?

928
01:03:36,584 --> 01:03:38,018
<i>And on my mark...</i>

929
01:03:39,053 --> 01:03:40,655
<i>fire on your exhale.</i>

930
01:03:40,689 --> 01:03:42,022
Sophie, it's okay.

931
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:44,726
Just relax.

932
01:03:44,759 --> 01:03:45,794
Fire!

933
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,461
Everything's okay.

934
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:48,896
Sophie, shoot him.

935
01:03:50,632 --> 01:03:52,032
<i>Okay, he's coming closer to you.</i>

936
01:03:52,066 --> 01:03:54,001
- <i>Sophie.</i>
- Don't come any closer.

937
01:03:54,703 --> 01:03:56,036
<i>To the right.</i>

938
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:57,071
<i>Adjust right.</i>

939
01:03:58,472 --> 01:03:59,973
Sophie,
he's getting closer to you.

940
01:04:00,341 --> 01:04:02,910
It's fine. You're fine.

941
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:06,847
We'll make... We'll make
something work,

942
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,016
just, uh, put the gun down.

943
01:04:09,049 --> 01:04:10,984
Adjust left, up, up.

944
01:04:11,018 --> 01:04:12,219
<i>Split the difference and fire.</i>

945
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,054
<i>Fire.</i>

946
01:04:14,088 --> 01:04:15,089
<i>Sophie!</i>

947
01:04:15,956 --> 01:04:17,358
No one's gonna hurt you.

948
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:18,827
Sophie, he's got a knife.

949
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:25,499
<i>Sophie, he's coming toward you.</i>

950
01:04:25,966 --> 01:04:27,134
Fire now!

951
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:42,784
<i>Sophie?</i>

952
01:04:43,585 --> 01:04:44,619
Sophie!

953
01:04:45,486 --> 01:04:46,521
<i>Sophie.</i>

954
01:04:46,554 --> 01:04:49,056
Yeah.

955
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:52,359
Okay. Okay, he's down.

956
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:53,994
We need to keep moving.

957
01:04:54,027 --> 01:04:55,307
They probably heard
the gunshots.

958
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:58,198
<i>Low battery. Twenty percent.</i>

959
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:00,367
Where's your charger?

960
01:05:00,835 --> 01:05:02,970
In my bag by the door.

961
01:05:03,003 --> 01:05:04,806
<i>No, it's too exposed.
You have to keep moving.</i>

962
01:05:06,006 --> 01:05:07,326
- <i>Wait, watch...</i>
- Stairs. I know.

963
01:06:20,013 --> 01:06:21,549
Adjust right. Fire!

964
01:06:24,451 --> 01:06:25,954
- Kelly?
- Sophie.

965
01:06:25,986 --> 01:06:27,755
- <i>Poor connection.</i>
- Sophie?

966
01:06:27,789 --> 01:06:29,624
Kelly? Kelly, where are you?

967
01:06:29,657 --> 01:06:30,825
Sophie, can you hear me?

968
01:06:52,947 --> 01:06:55,082
Uh, left. Fire!

969
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,095
<i>Hold.</i>

970
01:07:09,062 --> 01:07:10,097
Hold.

971
01:07:11,633 --> 01:07:12,767
He's dead.

972
01:07:17,304 --> 01:07:19,007
Okay, get his radio
on his waist.

973
01:07:45,332 --> 01:07:46,801
Now take a minute.

974
01:07:48,736 --> 01:07:53,440
The other one's... upstairs.
I need to move.

975
01:07:53,473 --> 01:07:55,242
<i>No, I can hear
that he's still drilling.</i>

976
01:07:55,342 --> 01:07:57,144
You're in a good position, okay?

977
01:07:57,177 --> 01:07:59,246
Just... Just take a second...

978
01:07:59,279 --> 01:08:00,280
<i>and breathe.</i>

979
01:08:00,848 --> 01:08:03,618
- Breathe.
- I am fucking breathing.

980
01:08:03,651 --> 01:08:04,919
<i>No, you're not.</i>

981
01:08:05,553 --> 01:08:06,588
Through your nose.

982
01:08:07,855 --> 01:08:11,091
Like you're at the top of
the ski slope before a run.

983
01:08:13,427 --> 01:08:14,829
<i>You're gonna inhale...</i>

984
01:08:15,997 --> 01:08:17,130
<i>hold it for a second...</i>

985
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:19,700
<i>and exhale.</i>

986
01:08:24,872 --> 01:08:26,808
How did you know I used to ski?

987
01:08:27,474 --> 01:08:30,078
Top ten best skiers
under 18 in the country.

988
01:08:30,645 --> 01:08:31,913
Pretty impressive.

989
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:33,681
I haven't skied in years.

990
01:08:33,915 --> 01:08:35,883
Yeah, what's your excuse?

991
01:08:35,917 --> 01:08:37,719
<i>Well, for starters,
I live in Florida.</i>

992
01:08:37,752 --> 01:08:39,754
<i>Low battery.</i>

993
01:08:39,787 --> 01:08:40,855
<i>Ten percent.</i>

994
01:08:40,888 --> 01:08:41,923
Kelly.

995
01:08:42,957 --> 01:08:44,759
Yeah, I heard.

996
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:47,361
All right, listen.

997
01:08:48,295 --> 01:08:49,797
There's only one left,

998
01:08:49,964 --> 01:08:51,532
and the cops are almost there.

999
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:54,468
All right, you just need to keep
camping out down there.

1000
01:08:54,501 --> 01:08:56,938
One way in and one way out.

1001
01:08:56,971 --> 01:08:59,473
And you're gonna
hold your gun on it. Copy?

1002
01:09:00,608 --> 01:09:01,643
Copy.

1003
01:09:04,012 --> 01:09:06,380
<i>Why do you talk
like you're in the Army?</i>

1004
01:09:06,948 --> 01:09:08,281
Twenty-second infantry.

1005
01:09:08,616 --> 01:09:09,817
Combat engineers.

1006
01:09:10,283 --> 01:09:11,552
Iraq?

1007
01:09:11,953 --> 01:09:12,987
Yeah.

1008
01:09:14,354 --> 01:09:17,992
And now I'm behind a desk
on admin duty.

1009
01:09:19,694 --> 01:09:21,094
<i>You make it sound like
a punishment.</i>

1010
01:09:21,963 --> 01:09:23,031
It is.

1011
01:09:24,297 --> 01:09:26,067
And I deserve it.

1012
01:09:32,807 --> 01:09:34,876
<i>Is it worse than
getting a cop killed?</i>

1013
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:38,311
You can't be sorry you called
the cops, Sophie.

1014
01:09:43,985 --> 01:09:45,687
I was working with them.

1015
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:51,324
<i>I told them I could
get rid of the cops if...</i>

1016
01:09:53,027 --> 01:09:55,029
they gave me an equal share.

1017
01:09:58,498 --> 01:09:59,901
I could have told her.

1018
01:10:00,735 --> 01:10:02,269
I could have left with her.

1019
01:10:05,673 --> 01:10:07,675
I shouldn't even be here.

1020
01:10:08,509 --> 01:10:09,577
Yeah, no shit.

1021
01:10:11,179 --> 01:10:13,748
No, I mean these bullshit jobs.

1022
01:10:17,417 --> 01:10:19,587
Should be out on the slopes
training.

1023
01:10:20,922 --> 01:10:22,523
You can ski blind?

1024
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:25,292
People can, yeah.

1025
01:10:26,994 --> 01:10:30,131
If you have
years of training and...

1026
01:10:31,666 --> 01:10:33,433
a guide that you trust
with your life.

1027
01:10:38,271 --> 01:10:40,373
Come on. Yeah.

1028
01:10:41,876 --> 01:10:43,711
There we go. We're in.

1029
01:10:49,016 --> 01:10:50,051
Guys?

1030
01:10:55,255 --> 01:10:56,289
<i>Guys, where are ya?</i>

1031
01:10:58,659 --> 01:11:00,293
<i>Low battery. Five percent.</i>

1032
01:11:00,528 --> 01:11:02,063
I'm gonna lose you any minute.

1033
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:04,065
<i>All right.</i>

1034
01:11:04,297 --> 01:11:05,332
We have two options.

1035
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,835
One: You can square up
on the stairs,

1036
01:11:07,869 --> 01:11:09,137
wait for the cops to arrive.

1037
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:12,272
But I need you to tell me
where to shoot.

1038
01:11:12,874 --> 01:11:14,809
No, if he's dumb enough to
come down that way,

1039
01:11:14,842 --> 01:11:16,282
<i>you'll be able to get him
without me.</i>

1040
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:19,279
What's option two?

1041
01:11:28,656 --> 01:11:30,925
- <i>Speak.</i>
- I need two more minutes.

1042
01:11:31,793 --> 01:11:34,028
Ernie and Otis are MIA.

1043
01:11:34,061 --> 01:11:35,263
<i>You want to elaborate on that?</i>

1044
01:11:35,295 --> 01:11:36,697
I don't know where they are.

1045
01:11:36,731 --> 01:11:39,100
They're not answering.
They went after the girl.

1046
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:41,301
<i>Just get it done.
Call me when you're leaving.</i>

1047
01:11:41,334 --> 01:11:42,637
Understood.

1048
01:11:48,643 --> 01:11:49,887
All right,
his back is toward you,

1049
01:11:49,911 --> 01:11:51,012
he can't see you.

1050
01:11:52,847 --> 01:11:53,881
Okay, keep going.

1051
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:14,969
Little closer.

1052
01:12:16,103 --> 01:12:18,405
All right, square up,
plant your feet on the ground.

1053
01:12:19,907 --> 01:12:21,042
<i>Adjust right.</i>

1054
01:12:28,683 --> 01:12:30,184
Fire!

1055
01:12:30,718 --> 01:12:31,853
Jesus!

1056
01:12:32,687 --> 01:12:34,722
- Hey.
- Down! Adjust left!

1057
01:12:34,755 --> 01:12:36,924
- Stop! Please!
- <i>Fire!</i>

1058
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:38,434
- <i>Sophie, fire.</i>
- Don't, don't, don't!

1059
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,161
Just let me go.

1060
01:12:40,194 --> 01:12:41,672
<i>No, don't listen to him.
He's just trying to stall.</i>

1061
01:12:41,696 --> 01:12:44,131
Sophie, I'm gonna lose you.
You need to fire.

1062
01:12:44,165 --> 01:12:45,700
- He's right in front of you.
- Please.

1063
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,902
Sophie, shoot him,
you've got him.

1064
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,042
It's open.
You can take what you want,

1065
01:12:55,076 --> 01:12:56,744
you can have it all,
just let me go.

1066
01:12:56,777 --> 01:12:57,788
<i>You're gonna lose me. Shoot him.</i>

1067
01:12:57,812 --> 01:12:59,280
Shoot him!

1068
01:12:59,313 --> 01:13:00,324
<i>He said the house
was gonna be empty.</i>

1069
01:13:00,348 --> 01:13:01,692
I never would have
signed up for this shit

1070
01:13:01,716 --> 01:13:03,117
if I knew you were
gonna be here.

1071
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:04,352
<i>Sophie, you're gonna lose...</i>

1072
01:13:04,384 --> 01:13:05,853
Please, just let me go.

1073
01:13:07,355 --> 01:13:09,056
Sophie! Sophie.

1074
01:13:11,424 --> 01:13:13,127
Shit! Shit!

1075
01:13:19,934 --> 01:13:20,968
Don't move.

1076
01:13:22,937 --> 01:13:24,205
We wait for the cops.

1077
01:13:47,628 --> 01:13:48,829
I said don't move!

1078
01:13:53,466 --> 01:13:54,535
I'm gonna go.

1079
01:13:54,568 --> 01:13:57,939
And... I'm gonna take my share.

1080
01:14:03,911 --> 01:14:05,179
You can have the rest.

1081
01:14:08,783 --> 01:14:10,084
If you keep moving, I'll shoot.

1082
01:14:12,219 --> 01:14:14,021
You're not gonna shoot
an unarmed man.

1083
01:14:14,622 --> 01:14:15,957
In the back.

1084
01:14:17,091 --> 01:14:18,326
You're not a killer.

1085
01:14:24,966 --> 01:14:26,334
Stop!

1086
01:14:40,448 --> 01:14:41,983
I'm gonna go down on
my knees, okay?

1087
01:14:42,817 --> 01:14:43,951
Don't move.

1088
01:14:43,985 --> 01:14:45,095
I'm just gonna go down on
my knees.

1089
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,721
- I mean it!
- Okay.

1090
01:14:47,621 --> 01:14:49,489
Just relax.

1091
01:14:49,957 --> 01:14:51,192
I'm just gonna get down.

1092
01:14:51,859 --> 01:14:52,960
I'm not gonna move.

1093
01:14:52,994 --> 01:14:54,829
I'm right here. Okay?

1094
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:00,701
Okay?

1095
01:15:01,769 --> 01:15:02,803
Just be cool.

1096
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:07,041
Don't move!

1097
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,018
<i>Is it done?</i>

1098
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:53,522
Yeah.

1099
01:15:54,255 --> 01:15:55,389
It's done.

1100
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:40,027
Sophie.

1101
01:17:41,962 --> 01:17:43,964
You want your cut? Or not?

1102
01:17:45,099 --> 01:17:46,167
You earned it.

1103
01:17:47,134 --> 01:17:48,469
Shit, I'm not even mad.

1104
01:17:50,371 --> 01:17:51,405
You killed it tonight.

1105
01:17:53,274 --> 01:17:54,842
Don't be scared.

1106
01:17:57,378 --> 01:17:59,280
I told you already,

1107
01:17:59,313 --> 01:18:01,015
you are not a witness.

1108
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,685
You are my partner.

1109
01:18:06,987 --> 01:18:08,523
Whether you like it or not.

1110
01:18:13,528 --> 01:18:14,596
Are you worried?

1111
01:18:16,163 --> 01:18:18,232
Sophie.

1112
01:18:23,904 --> 01:18:26,006
You are worried about the cops.

1113
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,683
Okay. You know what?

1114
01:18:35,316 --> 01:18:37,218
I'm gonna make a call
to the cops.

1115
01:18:41,822 --> 01:18:43,490
<i>9-1-1 emergency response.</i>

1116
01:18:43,525 --> 01:18:45,560
Hello, 911. Hello.

1117
01:18:45,993 --> 01:18:47,061
You gotta come.

1118
01:18:47,228 --> 01:18:49,631
Six Golden Lane.
There's dead bodies.

1119
01:18:49,664 --> 01:18:51,966
You gotta send someone.
Oh, my God!

1120
01:18:51,999 --> 01:18:53,267
<i>We have cars on route, sir.</i>

1121
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,540
<i>They're about five minutes out.</i>

1122
01:18:54,603 --> 01:18:56,538
Hurry. Hurry. Oh, my God.

1123
01:18:56,571 --> 01:18:58,005
I'm hiding, I'm hiding,
I'm hiding.

1124
01:18:58,038 --> 01:18:59,106
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1125
01:18:59,139 --> 01:19:00,140
<i>Sir, stay on the...</i>

1126
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:06,080
My tracks are covered.

1127
01:19:07,181 --> 01:19:09,483
They can't pin any of
these guys on me.

1128
01:19:09,517 --> 01:19:10,985
Well, you made sure of that.

1129
01:19:12,052 --> 01:19:13,754
I was the reasonable one.

1130
01:19:14,188 --> 01:19:16,090
I just wanted to make
everything fair.

1131
01:19:16,423 --> 01:19:17,992
But, no, Debra.

1132
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,129
She wanted to fuck me and
the government in the divorce.

1133
01:19:22,863 --> 01:19:25,299
Why do you think all this cash
isn't in a bank?

1134
01:19:27,134 --> 01:19:29,671
You can't steal
what's already stolen.

1135
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:32,306
This is all ours now.

1136
01:19:32,707 --> 01:19:35,376
You and me, we're the only two
who know about this

1137
01:19:35,409 --> 01:19:36,977
in the whole world.

1138
01:19:37,478 --> 01:19:39,346
You can have
all my guys' shares.

1139
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:40,381
All of it!

1140
01:19:40,414 --> 01:19:41,750
There's two million bucks!

1141
01:19:41,782 --> 01:19:45,452
You gotta tell me if
we're gonna split this

1142
01:19:45,486 --> 01:19:46,621
when the heat dies down.

1143
01:19:46,655 --> 01:19:48,088
You gotta tell me right now!

1144
01:19:48,956 --> 01:19:49,990
Are you in?

1145
01:19:52,727 --> 01:19:53,961
Or are you out?

1146
01:20:14,081 --> 01:20:15,849
There's my answer.

1147
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:19,521
Oh, what a mistake, baby.

1148
01:21:08,202 --> 01:21:10,037
Sophie.

1149
01:21:11,972 --> 01:21:13,107
Where are you?

1150
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,146
Sophie.

1151
01:23:52,466 --> 01:23:53,935
Redial.

1152
01:24:49,557 --> 01:24:51,124
No, no, no!

1153
01:26:30,457 --> 01:26:31,693
Straighten out.

1154
01:26:31,893 --> 01:26:32,927
Keep going.

1155
01:26:33,293 --> 01:26:35,830
Okay, a turn is coming up
to the left.

1156
01:26:36,631 --> 01:26:38,298
- To the left.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1157
01:26:38,331 --> 01:26:39,901
To the left. Straighten out.

1158
01:26:40,134 --> 01:26:41,135
That's it.

1159
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:44,072
What is it?

1160
01:26:45,006 --> 01:26:46,273
After four days, I forgot

1161
01:26:46,306 --> 01:26:48,275
the world didn't
smell like sanitizer.

1162
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:54,515
Do you mind, uh, taking me
the rest of the way?

1163
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:57,151
Yeah, of course.

1164
01:26:57,185 --> 01:26:58,586
Can I have my backpack?

1165
01:26:59,053 --> 01:27:00,088
Sure.

1166
01:27:01,989 --> 01:27:03,356
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1167
01:27:07,195 --> 01:27:09,275
Thought you would have
pulled out a cigarette by now.

1168
01:27:10,164 --> 01:27:12,299
Can't smoke anymore.
Bad for my training.

1169
01:27:14,267 --> 01:27:15,302
What?

1170
01:27:15,335 --> 01:27:16,904
I emailed Paralympics back.

1171
01:27:17,337 --> 01:27:19,040
I should be able to walk
in a week, so...

1172
01:27:19,674 --> 01:27:21,085
I want to be
back on the hill in six,

1173
01:27:21,109 --> 01:27:22,143
before the season ends.

1174
01:27:26,781 --> 01:27:28,549
Well, you're gonna need
new skis, then.

1175
01:27:31,686 --> 01:27:33,453
Your gear's almost
four years old now.

1176
01:27:35,189 --> 01:27:38,059
Just have to figure out how to
cover the training costs.

1177
01:27:39,927 --> 01:27:41,829
Too bad you didn't get a tip
this time, huh?

1178
01:27:45,867 --> 01:27:47,001
Yeah.

1179
01:27:58,646 --> 01:28:00,081
Hey, there you are.

1180
01:28:00,114 --> 01:28:01,149
Hey.

1181
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:02,583
How's the picture?

1182
01:28:03,718 --> 01:28:05,119
Uh... whoa.

1183
01:28:05,153 --> 01:28:06,954
Hey, what happened
to the beginner hill?

1184
01:28:08,055 --> 01:28:09,590
Thought it was
time for the real thing.

1185
01:28:10,825 --> 01:28:12,468
You know, Sophie,
if you're not up to this,

1186
01:28:12,492 --> 01:28:14,361
you definitely
don't have to do it.

1187
01:28:15,029 --> 01:28:17,265
You thought I came up here
just for the view?

1188
01:28:17,297 --> 01:28:19,033
<i>Do you need me to do anything?</i>

1189
01:28:19,066 --> 01:28:21,334
- <i>I told you I'd never...</i>
- Kelly, it's fine.

1190
01:28:21,903 --> 01:28:23,336
Just enjoy the ride, okay?

1191
01:28:23,905 --> 01:28:25,225
I'm gonna have this guy
in my ear.

1192
01:28:25,773 --> 01:28:28,441
Cam, Kelly. Kelly, Cam.

1193
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:30,278
Don't worry, Kelly.

1194
01:28:30,745 --> 01:28:32,025
She was always the better skier.

1195
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:33,322
She'll probably just ignore me

1196
01:28:33,346 --> 01:28:34,706
and beat me to the bottom,
anyways.

1197
01:28:35,817 --> 01:28:37,018
<i>I can believe that.</i>

1198
01:28:37,552 --> 01:28:38,553
<i>Okay.</i>

1199
01:28:41,522 --> 01:28:42,690
Mic check.

1200
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:44,992
Good, check.

1201
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:50,064
Whenever you're ready.

1202
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:07,982
- <i>Hey, Sophie.</i>
- Yeah.

1203
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:10,251
<i>Breathe.</i>
