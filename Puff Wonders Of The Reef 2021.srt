<i>[fluttering]</i>

6
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:57,958
<i>[narrator]</i> Imagine you're cast at birth
into a galaxy of tiny drifting creatures.

7
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,375
<i>A speck lost in the ocean.</i>

8
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,125
<i>You never met your mother or father.</i>

9
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,416
<i>You have no one to show you</i>
<i>where to go or what to do.</i>

10
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,916
<i>That's how life begins</i>
<i>for this little sharpnose pufferfish.</i>

11
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,625
<i>We'll call him Puff.</i>

12
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,916
<i>Just a couple of months old,</i>
<i>he's smaller than a fingernail.</i>

13
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,458
<i>Adrift in the ocean,</i>
<i>headed for an uncertain future.</i>

14
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,958
<i>This is Puff's world.</i>

15
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:48,458
<i>A vibrant coral reef,</i>
<i>home to thousands of creatures.</i>

16
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:54,041
<i>But to see what Puff sees,</i>
<i>you have to look closer.</i>

17
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,250
<i>Even closer.</i>

18
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:07,583
<i>Because the story of every coral reef</i>
<i>starts with its tiniest creatures.</i>

19
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:16,875
<i>For the first time, we have opened</i>
<i>a window to their incredible micro-verse.</i>

20
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:24,041
<i>A world where drama unfolds</i>
<i>on scales too small…</i>

21
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,541
<i>too fast…</i>

22
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,916
<i>or too slow for the human eye to perceive.</i>

23
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,416
<i>And from Puff's tiny point of view,</i>

24
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,333
<i>it must seem almost magical.</i>

25
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,708
<i>The reef as we've never seen it before.</i>

<i>[narrator] </i>To the naked eye,
{\an8}the open ocean may seem lifeless,

29
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:13,791
{\an8}<i>but when you look closer,</i>
<i>billions of tiny creatures are revealed.</i>

30
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,541
{\an8}<i>Some so minute</i>
<i>that hundreds of individuals</i>

31
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,083
{\an8}<i>would fit in a single drop of water.</i>

32
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,833
<i>This is where Puff</i>
<i>begins his life journey.</i>

33
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:34,958
<i>He hatched from an egg on the reef</i>
<i>and drifted with the current out to sea,</i>

34
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,083
<i>to feed on tiny plankton.</i>

35
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,041
<i>This is how many reef fish</i>
<i>begin their lives.</i>

36

<i>[dramatic music playing]</i>

37
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,375
<i>[narrator] </i>But within months,

38
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,083
<i>these microscopic morsels</i>
<i>are no longer enough to sustain him.</i>

39
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,041
<i>He needs to find bigger things to eat.</i>

40
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,208
<i>And that poses a problem</i>
<i>as big as the ocean.</i>

41
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,166
<i>How will Puff find his way back</i>
<i>to the reef?</i>

42
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:40,708
<i>Something amazing happens when lots</i>
<i>of creatures gather in the same place.</i>

43
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,666
<i>Crowds make noise,</i>

44
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,250
<i>and a coral reef is a busy place.</i>

45
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,291
<i>Sound can travel for miles underwater.</i>

46
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,125
<i>All Puff has to do is listen.</i>

47
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,833
<i>Most of what you see</i>
<i>here is built by animals</i>

48
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,041
<i>smaller than the tip of your finger.</i>

49
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:20,375
<i>Thousands of lives</i>

<i>Don't believe me?</i>

51
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,500
<i>Try looking from Puff's perspective.</i>

52
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:57,125
<i>The smallest of these animals</i>
<i>are no larger than a grain of sand.</i>

<i>[ethereal music playing]</i>

54
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,500
<i>[narrator] </i>Puff's new world

<i>[muffled breathing]</i>

58
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:24,833
<i>[narrator]</i> At around three months of age,
Puff is only the size of a jellybean.

59
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,666
<i>That's not just daunting,</i>

60
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,750
<i>it's dangerous.</i>

61
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:36,916
<i>Fortunately for Puff, he has</i>
<i>an ingenious way of defending himself.</i>

62
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,041
<i>He's toxic.</i>

63
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,916
<i>And he comes with a warning label.</i>

64
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,000
<i>The markings on his body say,</i>

65
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,666
<i>"Eat me, and you'll regret it."</i>

66
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,166
<i>But being poisonous</i>
<i>doesn't make him invincible.</i>

67
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,458
<i>And nearby, a predator lurks.</i>

68
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,875
<i>A lionfish.</i>

69
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,333
<i>This ferocious hunter's dazzling fins</i>

<i>[soft music playing]</i>

73
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,666
<i>[narrator] </i>Most young reef fish

74

<i>Luckily for Puff,</i>

75
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,666
<i>the coral creates a maze</i>

<i>[suspenseful music playing]</i>

81

<i>[narrator] </i>Every year,

<i>the moon, the tides,</i>
<i>and the water temperature</i>

83
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,875
<i>all signal to billions of corals</i>

00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,958
<i>that tonight is the night</i>

<i>At the mouths of tiny coral polyps,</i>

<i>minuscule bundles</i>
<i>of eggs and sperm appear.</i>

87
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,916
<i>In near perfect synchronicity,</i>
<i>they lift off…</i>

88
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,375
<i>and journey to the surface.</i>

89
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,208
<i>The bundles drift with the current</i>
<i>and mix with the spawn</i>

90
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,750
<i>of thousands of other coral colonies.</i>

91
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,625
<i>If among the billions of eggs</i>

93
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,208
<i>something extraordinary happens.</i>

94
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,791
<i>A microscopic larva forms,</i>

95
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:39,416
<i>a barely visible creature</i>
<i>on a quest to build a new coral colony.</i>

96
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,250
<i>It drifts for days</i>

97
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,125
<i>until it hears the call of the reef.</i>

98
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,750
<i>And dives,</i>

99
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,583
<i>braving a minefield</i>
<i>of predators and traps.</i>

100
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,666
<i>[sinister music playing]</i>

101
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,166
<i>[narrator]</i>
When you're the size of a speck,

102
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:38,125
<i>a three-centimeter-long shrimp</i>
<i>can be monstrous.</i>

103
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,166
<i>[eerie music playing]</i>

104
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,291
<i>[narrator] </i>On the reef, the larva searches
for a perfect place to make its home.

105
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,583
<i>When it finds the right spot,</i>

106
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,375
<i>it transforms</i>

107
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:53,000
<i>from a free-swimming larva</i>
<i>into a young coral.</i>

108
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,375
<i>As it grows,</i>
<i>its skeleton forms part of the reef.</i>

109
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,625
<i>With the help</i>
<i>of other tiny construction workers,</i>

110
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,625
<i>the corals build living structures</i>

111
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,791
<i>that create homes</i>
<i>for countless other creatures.</i>

112
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,791
<i>It takes hundreds,</i>
<i>sometimes thousands of years,</i>

113
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:18,083
<i>for generations of tiny reef-builders</i>
<i>to construct Puff's coral metropolis.</i>

114
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:37,041
<i>Inside his reef hiding place,</i>
<i>Puff is safe for now.</i>

115
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,708
<i>But he needs to brave the predators</i>
<i>and head out to find food.</i>

116
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,333
<i>And once again, the corals help out.</i>

117
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:54,708
<i>Because corals produce energy</i>
<i>that feeds the animals of the reef.</i>

118
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,583
<i>It all starts with single-celled,</i>
<i>plant-like creatures</i>

119
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,250
<i>living within the corals,</i>
<i>the zooxanthellae.</i>

120
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,625
<i>Don't let that big name fool you.</i>

121
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,750
<i>Everything here, really small.</i>

122
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,250
<i>These little guys</i>
<i>are the coral's life partners,</i>

123
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,750
<i>harvesting energy from sunlight</i>
<i>to feed their coral hosts.</i>

124
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,833
<i>And as the corals grow and thrive,</i>

125
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,333
<i>they share their energy</i>
<i>with the rest of the reef.</i>

126
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:37,250
<i>Some creatures consume the energy directly</i>
<i>by eating the coral.</i>

127
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,750
<i>This baby crown-of-thorns starfish</i>

128
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:47,958
<i>uses tiny eyespots on the end</i>
<i>of each arm to locate coral colonies.</i>

129
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:57,250
<i>A keen sense of underwater smell</i>
<i>helps it find the right species.</i>

130
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:05,833
<i>And it devours the coral polyps,</i>
<i>leaving a scar on the reef.</i>

131
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,291
<i>Not all inhabitants</i>
<i>feed on the coral directly.</i>

132
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,875
<i>If they did,</i>
<i>they'd soon demolish their reef city.</i>

133
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,916
<i>Fortunately, there's another way</i>
<i>corals supply food.</i>

134
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,208
<i>They do it with slime.</i>

135
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,458
<i>Corals shed mucus too fine</i>
<i>for creatures like Puff to eat,</i>

136
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:50,500
<i>but an ancient group of organisms</i>
<i>makes sure this energy is not lost.</i>

137
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,000
<i>Sponges.</i>

138
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,208
<i>To the naked eye,</i>
<i>they may appear motionless,</i>

139
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:02,416
<i>but if you speed up time,</i>
<i>their vital role in the reef is revealed.</i>

140
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,916
<i>Sponges pump huge volumes of water</i>
<i>through their bodies,</i>

141
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,291
<i>filtering out the coral mucus</i>
<i>and using the energy to grow.</i>

<i>[soft music playing]</i>

143
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,750
<i>[narrator]</i> After they've had their fill,

144

<i>the sponges concentrate organic waste</i>
<i>on their surfaces,</i>

145
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,916
<i>creating a bite-sized buffet</i>

<i>for tiny creatures to feed on.</i>

147
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,291
<i>And those animals</i>
<i>are eaten by slightly bigger creatures.</i>

00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,666
<i>Oh no. No, no, no. Just slightly bigger?</i>
<i>No, that's</i>…<i> That's way too big.</i>

149
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,250

<i>This… yes.</i>

151
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,500
<i>That's better.</i>

152
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:05,166
<i>Some of the recycled sponge food</i>
<i>also washes up the water column</i>
