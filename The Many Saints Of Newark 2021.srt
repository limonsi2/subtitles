3
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:41,274
Nam etsi ambulavero
in medio umbrae mortis,

4
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:45,578
non timebo mala,
quoniam tu mecum es.

5
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:51,051
Virga tua et baculus tuus
ipsa me consolata sunt.

6
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:54,120
She was furious with me,
because if I had my law degree,

7
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,523
I could have represented us.

8
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,358
The jury ruled against me.

9
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,027
I told my lawyer
I considered suicide.

10
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,030
I drove home from Nyack,
and guess what?

11
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,365
She had left me.

12
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,567
I recall almost
a sigh of relief...

13
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,070
Somehow it made a lasting
impression on her life.

14
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,572
My first child
came easy enough.

15
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:18,111
But with Patricia,
they had to open me up
under anesthesia.

16
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,147
I've often thought that
perhaps the reason...

17
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,316
I told them
when I got here,

18
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,152
"Okay, I explored
the criminal lifestyle."

19
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,988
But I was an altar boy,
for Christ's sake.

20
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:34,160
Moltisanti is a religious name.
And still I'm fucked.

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,998
I met death on Route 23,
not too far from here.

22
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,235
But that was much later.

23
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:47,173
Back in 1967,
the man wearing the hat
was my father.

24
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,442
In those days,
he didn't have a son.

25
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,744
Five dollars says
I spot him first.

26
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,580
I don't got five dollars.

27
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,915
Then you better win,
gagootz.  Huh?

28
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,751
Uncle Dick, think fast.

29
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,753
Oh, you want to fight, huh?

30
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,624
The little fat kid
is my uncle, Tony. Soprano.

31
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,658
You got nothing.

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,997
Well, we call him
my uncle, by marriage.

33
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,000
He choked me to death.

34
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,142
There! Pay up.

35
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,277
We have a winner,
ladies and gents.

36
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,479
Huh?

37
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,014
My grandfather
and his brother were with

38
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,617
the DiMeo crime family
in Newark.

39
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,485
My grandfather
was an associate,

40
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,786
-but he stacked more  scharol...
-Pop!

41
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,522
...than any of the made guys.

42
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,557
Hey, there he is!

43
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,160
Including
a Cadillac dealership.

44
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:47,734
Cara mia, fammi presentare
mio figlio,  Richard Moltisanti.

45
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,403
Everybody calls me Dickie.

46
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,674
Welcome to America.

47
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,009
Benvenuta.

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,484
Most guys 65
go to Europe on vacation,
they come back with the gout.

49
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:08,154
You come back with the winner,
Miss Provolone, 1967.

50
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,761
Oh. Antonio Soprano.

51
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,897
U picceri.

52
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,768
After he murdered me,

53
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,505
Tony gave my wife and baby
his pocket change.

54
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,407
But that was much  later.

55
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,617
E squisita.

56
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,955
I'm embarrassed.
You're all such
great cooks over there.

57
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,225
Can you translate for me?

58
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,293
Forget it.
She understands enough.

59
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,312
Giuseppina,
what does your family
do over there?

60
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,082
Mio padre--

61
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,150
The fascists killed
her old man.

62
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,052
Her mother never recovered.

63
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,721
Fuckin' Mussolini.

64
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,090
I don't get it.
When I was a kid,
you and Vito Genovese

65
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,424
always praised Mussolini.

66
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,660
Let's not talk politics
at the table.

67
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,730
But I'll tell you, Dick,

68
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,266
it's paradise over there.

69
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,168
On the one hand,
you can't believe the beauty.

70
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,672
On the other hand,
they don't even have toilets.

71
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:38,511
I told Giuseppina that
"you're gonna live the life
of a proud American lady.

72
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:42,582
And I'm gonna have
my second set of children
with you."

73
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,450
And they'll be deluged
with a life

74
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:47,186
that they could never even
imagine over there.

75
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,923
Like you were, Dick,
as a kid.

76
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,294
These'll be your
brothers and sisters.

77
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:59,799
So... Giuseppina
is your stepmother, Dickie.

78
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,306
Yeah.

79
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,508
-

80
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,575
It wasn't me
who ripped you off!

81
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,344
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

82
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,812
-Come on!
-

83
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,058
Shit!
-Harold.

84
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,594
All right, already.

85
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,029
This punk ass snapper.

86
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,865
Japped one of our runners,
took 600 bucks.

87
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,669
I want a full bag tomorrow.

88
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,671
Who the fuck are you?

89
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,907
The guy who one time
put out somebody's eye
for talkin' to him like that.

90
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,614
-You winded there,
Jesse Owens?
-

91
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,449
I gotta quit smoking.

92
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,252
I agree.

93
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,554
Can't I get you
to switch to Newports?

94
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,415
Hey, Harold.
My son here say

95
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,483
he gonna be Hank Aaron
when he grown up.

96
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,419
I'm gonna hit
318 like him.

97
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,555
Hmm. 318,
your lucky number, boy,
play it.

98
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,290
Yeah. Numbers
is the only chance

99
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,992
Black folks got
to get out of
this sinkhole city.

100
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,560
How does that work, anyway?

101
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,495
Well, you pick out
three numbers,

102
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,963
like for you, 3-1-8.

103
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,331
You bet a quarter,

104
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,833
and if your numbers
come on at the racetrack,

105
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,336
then you win
$125 for a quarter.

106
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,571
-For a quarter?
-Mmm.

107
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,007
Bet a dollar, you get $500.

108
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,109
-You shitting me, Harold?
-Uh!

109
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,911
What if my numbers
don't come out?

110
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,746
Well, if your
numbers don't hit,
you don't get nothing.

111
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,015
Harold collects
everybody's bets
and gives it to the Man.

112
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,684
How you think the Italians
drive those long, fancy cars

113
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,120
and wear those diamond
Swiss watches on their wrists?

114
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,999
Thank you. Thank you,
everybody, welcome.

115
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,501
-Uh...

116
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:52,772
Well, mostly, I...
I just want to say how pr...

117
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,974
Knock it off, Anthony.

118
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,547
I want to say how proud I am
of my big girl, Janice...

119
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,483
who is today...

120
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,718
a woman.

121
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,554
Cheers!
-

122
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,723
You know, Janice, she, uh...

123
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,992
She went to her catechism.

124
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,994
She practiced her Latin.

125
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,897
She even stopped
watching those two  stunods,
Sonny and Cher,

126
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,398
long enough to think
about God, huh?

127
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,067
Too much fucking
salt on this.

128
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,070
At least for a minute or two,
but... boy, did she cost me.

129
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,838
You know,
I made a bet that, uh,

130
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,307
Janice would not do
her religious duties.

131
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:32,011
But if Janice did,
you know, got confirmed...

132
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,213
I'd shave off my mustache.

133
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,984
Ooh...

134
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,919
Enjoy.
-His  comare  told him

135
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,421
it makes him
look like Robert Goulet.

136
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,230
This stuff ain't so authentic.

137
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,365
Ow!

138
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,234
Just use your fork.

139
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,769
But, you know,
the gravy's good.

140
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,739
Oh. Come here.
-Your daughter's confirmation.

141
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,040
Congrats, skip.

142
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,075
I'm here, too, Mr. Handsome.

143
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,244
Yeah, and looking like
a million dollars.

144
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,446
And not
Mexican dollars, either.

145
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,782
-What are you talking about?
-

146
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,123
Same fucking gang.
Colored kids hit
one of my colored runners.

147
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,358
Threw him a beating.

148
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,961
You believe this?
How these people
prey on their own?

149
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,964
Hey, Boot DiMeo's gonna
rag on me when he sees this.

150
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,133
It looks bad too,
perception-wise.

151
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,636
Even the papers say
the numbers is the biggest
percentage of our cash flow.

152
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,307
Junior's right, you gotta get
your arms around this.

153
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,947
You got big ears there,
gagootz?

154
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:45,151
Big brother,
go and get yourself
some Pez.

155
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,892
Silvio, Puss, come here.

156
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,962
-Marone!
-Oh!

157
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,663
Ah? The second
Mrs. Hollywood Dick.

158
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,899
I was just explaining
to His Holiness, here.

159
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,834
I think I went to school
with your father.

160
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,069
Calogero Dante.

161
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,171
"Butch."

162
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,306
He said you were a bully.

163
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:12,244
Whoa, what do we got here?
The Italian actress,
Sophia Lotsa-Pizza.

164
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,580
Get out of here,
you fucking mutt!

165
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,249
Uh... Sorry.

166
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,186
Buddha. It's Joe D.
He's up at the Boot's Mansion.

167
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,522
Mr. DiMaggio.  Come stai?

168
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,959
Your saints name
you took in church today,
Apollonia?

169
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,996
She's the patron saint
of dentists.

170
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,774
Take it from me,
chains are more effective
than snow tires.

171
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,676
Why didn't you bring
the missus, Dick?

172
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,545
I tried, but the poor kid's
self-conscious about
her English.

173
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,781
She's making progress, though.

174
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,383
I didn't catch the name.

175
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,118
Pussy.

176
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,820
Don't worry, Father,
it's not what you think it is.

177
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,393
This is my dog.

178
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,296
This is my dog.

179
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,333
This is your dog.

180
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,403
This is your dog.

181
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,738
Your dog.

182
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,143
Buddy Durham
in the light trunks...

183
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,744
the white trunks.

184
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,913
Durham has always been known
as a counter-puncher...

185
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,849
-Huh...
-

186
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,085
He gets
a great hook in there.

187
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,687
Hey.

188
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,659
What did you learn to say?

189
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,832
This... is... his... ball.

190
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,670
Whose ball?

191
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,440
Spot.

192
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:55,047
Oh, I think this is
a waste of money.

193
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,583
We hear from Hoboken's
own Chairman of the Board.

194
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,553
Hi, there, my name
is Francis Albert Sinatra

195
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,021
and I got news for you.

196
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,223
Here's your host,
William B. Williams.

197
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,226
My mother met
his mother once. Frank.

198
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:12,131
Frank? He grabbed me
to go to some party once.

199
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,534
It was on the Upper East Side,
it was a penthouse.

200
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,237
Some celebrity,
I don't know who.

201
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:24,243
So... he and Dean, they have
this donkey brought downstairs
to the basement.

202
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,979
And the donkey's just stuffed
full of laxatives, right?

203
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,948
So they put it in
the private elevator.

204
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,817
They send
the private elevator up,
the door opens,

205
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:36,922
and the donkey starts kicking
and shitting over everybody
in the party!

206
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,462
Oh!

207
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,831
Ah, your sister's cunt!

208
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,834
Junior,
it's the Summer of Love.

209
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,339
It's just a line to you

210
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:58,077
And never seemed
so right before...

211
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,349
Nice car.

212
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,352
You a friend of Dickie's?

213
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,820
No English.

214
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,593
Oh!

215
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,662
Hopalong  Che Si Dice!

216
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,466
It's fucking light again?

217
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,435
Picked up from
most of the runners,
but this kid, Overall...

218
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,004
Who the fuck is Overall?

219
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,106
He's a crazy young motherfucker
that runs the Saints.

220
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,040
Leon Overall.

221
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,875
He's from East Orange.

222
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,545
My cousin's, uh,
the placekicker over
at the high school over there.

223
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,681
Yeah, well me and Harold
played East Orange
Thanksgiving game.

224
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,550
We used to beat 'em
every fucking year.

225
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,051
You should have
seen this man run.

226
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,886
Are you sure you don't
got no Black blood?

227
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,556
That's Sicilians.
I'm Napoletano.

228
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,025
Oh! I'm Siciliano.

229
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,362
Come on. Come over here.

230
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,704
The big picture, you told me
this thing was over
with the Black Saints.

231
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,539
I know, I...

232
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,842
thought I schooled the kid,
Overall, when I whupped him,
but...

233
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,378
He's got a wild hair
across his ass.

234
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,682
I gotta know, Harold...

235
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,518
aren't you humiliated
by what you just said?

236
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,687
I know I would be.

237
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,423
You're a grown man.

238
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,092
Fucking punk street gang?

239
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,358
Come on in, son. Have a seat.

240
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,936
I think we lost him.

241
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,440
Hold up. Hold up. Turn around.

242
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,111
Would I for sure
be going to Vietnam?
Like my dream?

243
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,812
You heard about the G.I. Bill?

244
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,615
Yeah, college. Sure.

245
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,083
Thinking about being a...

246
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,052
-scientist.
-Hmm.

247
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,554
Wait over there.

248
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,926
No, this... this war
wasn't my idea!

249
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,082
Isola, turn that light out.
I'm trying to sleep.

250
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,284
That's why I brought you
a 7 and 7, baby.

251
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,756
What's the matter with you?

252
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,795
Goddamn Gentleman
Dickie Moltisanti.

253
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,498
Always comes to me
to handle his nasty work.

254
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,935
Done made you
his house nigga.

255
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,947
Put it away.

256
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,059
The army won't take me now.

257
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,064
I always wanted
to join up, but I...

258
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,667
I had two felony convictions.

259
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:42,901
Take you?

260
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:48,073
Happened to stop by
a recruiting office today,
and it made me remember.

261
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,710
Brothers doing
all the dying over there.
We don't need no more.

262
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,512
Well, somebody's gonna to win
the Medal of Honor.

263
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,248
Not a Black man.

264
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:57,916
Please.

265
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,553
Ooh, baby, you are
a riot tonight.

266
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,607
Make a right here.

267
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,775
It's a one-way.

268
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,376
Fuck it, make the right.

269
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,594
Fuck.

270
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,276
Step out of the car.

271
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,311
I know what I did, Officer.

272
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,725
with your sigh

273
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,341
Oh!

274
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,518
Hey, why aren't they home,
sleeping till noon?

275
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,856
Two officers picked up
some colored taxi driver,
had to rough him up a little.

276
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,357
These morons think
we killed him.

277
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,659
It spread around
the Central Ward that way.

278
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,528
They broke windows
up and down Belmont Avenue.

279
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,130
They're throwing bricks
and bottles at us.

280
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,865
We got two officers
had to go to the hospital.

281
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,466
- No shit.

282
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,203
You ain't nothin'
without that badge!

283
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,672
You think this is funny?

284
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:16,455
for a day...

285
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,230
Get the fuck away
from the car!

286
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,750
and she kissed me

287
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,424
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for
our host tonight.

288
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,893
They call him
Gentleman Dick Moltisanti.

289
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,066
Ahh!

290
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,072
Paulie.

291
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:08,874
This?

292
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,348
It's about time.
Pinto the Butcher
sent over some capuzzelle.

293
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,050
The fuck happen to you?

294
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,854
There's something
you gotta see.

295
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,904
What the fuck?

296
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,640
That's Belmont Avenue.

297
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,767
You wanna get smart now?

298
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,769
Ma vaffanculo!

299
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,007
Why don't you go after
the  ditsoon,  huh?

300
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,742
They almost
burned the city down.

301
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,377
Oh, you'll hold
the door, huh.

302
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,978
Daddy!

303
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,747
Janice, go home!
- Daddy!

304
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,215
Go home!
Take the bus.

305
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,390
Hey, stop! Stop!

306
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,991
-Agh!

307
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,593
- Anthony!

308
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,430
Anthony! What are
you doing here?

309
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,108
My God!

310
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,677
What did they do?

311
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,545
We raided a card game,
but we got lucky.

312
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,781
Picked up your husband
on an outstanding warrant.

313
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,782
Had to take 'em somewhere.

314
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,117
Warrant? For what?

315
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,252
Assault with a deadly weapon.

316
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:08,587
The Lobster Trap Restaurant?

317
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,222
That wasn't him.
He didn't do that.

318
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,256
Where is he?

319
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,758
Downtown.

320
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,459
He's downtown,
where he might get
burned to death?

321
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,395
-What are you people thinking?
-

322
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,296
Janice, shut up with that!

323
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,032
What were the two of you doing
at that card game?

324
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,435
Dad took Janice
to ride the rides
while he played cards.

325
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:27,639
But he wouldn't take me
because I passed gas
while he was eating lunch.

326
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,709
Get inside, both of you!

327
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:33,979
Anthony!

328
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:55,801
Standing in the ruins
Of another Black man's life

329
00:23:55,901 --> 00:24:00,939
Or flying through the valley
Separating day and night

330
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:04,609
"I am death," cried the vulture

331
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,412
"For the people of the night"

332
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:17,689
In a wilderness of heartbreak
And a desert of despair

333
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,761
Evil's clarion of justice
Shrieks a cry of naked terror

334
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:27,866
Taking babies from their mommas
Leaving grief beyond compare

335
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,702
Please help me! Help me!
Please, help me!

336
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:35,373
So if you see
the vulture coming
Flying circles in your mind

337
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,543
-Remember,
there is no escaping

338
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,113
For he will follow
close behind

339
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,649
Only promise me a battle

340
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:48,186
Battle for your soul
and mine

341
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,856
And mine

342
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,191
Talk to young Negro men
on the street

343
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,627
and they will
tell you, they say,

344
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:59,064
they're supposed to go away
and die for this country
that isn't really theirs?

345
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,234
This tells you
right there that for
understandable reasons,

346
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,237
they don't consider themselves
complete Americans.

347
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,405
And I don't say this
comprises all of them,

348
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,542
but it's obvious the reason
they can burn their
own homes...

349
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,544
Huge fire.

350
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,347
Ashes.

351
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,396
Thought I heard
somebody fall.

352
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,499
You fall this morning?

353
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,903
I tripped in the bathtub.

354
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,338
Oh.

355
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:43,875
You shouldn't
wear your sunglasses
in the tub, you know?

356
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,617
He's got a temper.

357
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,853
È arrabbiato,  my father.

358
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,291
He start to yell.

359
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,193
Yeah, he wasn't like this
back in Ariano?

360
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,298
'Cause he used to...
me, as a kid.

361
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,567
Every day.

362
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,038
I should have stayed there.

363
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,406
No.

364
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,745
Maybe I come to America
for America money.

365
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:22,914
But...

366
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,420
But here,
in America, he become...

367
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:30,922
Uno stronzo!

368
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,231
I think maybe
you still love him.

369
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,143
What's the matter with you?

370
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,413
My wife's right inside.

371
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,919
You're my father's wife.

372
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,212
Oh.

373
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:04,916
Where are you going?

374
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,920
I'm going down to Rexall.
The doc switched
my blood thinner.

375
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,422
I'll ride with you.

376
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,535
What?

377
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,670
How high did she bounce?

378
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,172
What are you talking about?

379
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,940
When you threw her
down the stairs.

380
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,076
Got two left feet.

381
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,744
'Cause you used to throw
my mother down the stairs.

382
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,446
I didn't like it then,
I don't like it now.

383
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,515
Well, some women
like the rough stuff.
Don't ask me why.

384
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:41,853
Yeah, it's funny how
they're all attracted to
Hollywood Dick Moltisanti.

385
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,055
You wanted to get
into her fucking pants

386
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,957
since the day
I brought her over.

387
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,127
I give you permission
to picture her while
you're jerking off.

388
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,197
I promise you,
you hurt her again,
you're going down the stairs.

389
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:54,299
-Who the fuck do you think
you're fucking talking to?
-You got away with it

390
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,900
once with Mom.
But I was a little kid.

391
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,235
You're not getting away
with it again.

392
00:28:57,302 --> 00:29:01,473
Oh, I marry sluts.
What do I know?

393
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:06,111
Ow! Hey! Get...
Get your fucking...
Get off me!

394
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,145
Hey! Hey!

395
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,154
Dick...

396
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,607
Pop.

397
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,454
Pop?

398
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,150
Uncle Dickie.

399
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,686
Anthony, what the fuck
are you doing?

400
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,254
The city's burning down.

401
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,522
Over on Springfield Avenue.

402
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,591
Dickie? Who blew the horn?

403
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,559
I'm working
on the car.

404
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,394
You want pork chops tonight?

405
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:04,729
Yeah, that's fine.

406
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,164
Can I watch you
work on the car?

407
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,498
With the applesauce?

408
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,667
I don't know what sauce!

409
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,336
I gotta go out for a while.

410
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:12,570
Can I?

411
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,505
Can you what?

412
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,174
Watch.

413
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,742
What the fuck did I
just say, God damn it?
Now, go home!

414
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,855
...from the newsroom.

415
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:34,292
American warplanes
have expanded the air war
over North Vietnam

416
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,395
with the bombing of five
previously untouched targets

417
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:40,198
near the heart of
the port city of Haiphong.

418
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:44,302
Four of the new targets,
one of them only a mile
and a half from Haiphong...

419
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,654
Democratic Majority Leader
Mike Mansfield

420
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,455
-sounded a warning tonight...
-Go ahead, sir.

421
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:06,624
He's white.

422
00:33:52,196 --> 00:34:00,671
a love-in there

423
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:07,912
of San Francisco...

424
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:10,081
Three guesses
who they blame this on.

425
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,349
The Harlem Globetrotters.

426
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,187
Shh.

427
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:34,305
They called him Hollywood Dick.
Imagine what he looks like now.

428
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,808
Tell Ma what you told me,
about the bird.

429
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,043
There was a bird
in the garage.

430
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,078
So?

431
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,412
It means
somebody's gonna die.

432
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:44,215
You're talking
through your hat.

433
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,985
A bird would never
fly into a garage
to announce a death.

434
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,754
A house is another matter.

435
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,325
Poor Dickie.

436
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,495
I still can't believe it.

437
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,844
I gotta talk to Johnny Soprano,
the putrescible trash routes.

438
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,679
The Sposato Brothers
are making a grab.

439
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,281
You didn't hear?
Johnny's gonna be
a guest of the government.

440
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,850
He couldn't make bail.

441
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,119
When my brother's away,
everything goes through me.

442
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,453
You got diarrhea?

443
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,123
Comedian.

444
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,030
The three C's I owe you.

445
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,500
What the fuck is this?
It's supposed to be cash.

446
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,934
That's an RCA.

447
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,507
What am I gonna do with this?

448
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,153
What a blow.

449
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,822
Yeah, well,
at least you still got
your brother. I'm...

450
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,060
Yeah. I got nobody.

451
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,831
Dickie, consider me your
brother from now on, huh?

452
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,007
Where's your brother?

453
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:19,177
He went to see if he could
sneak into the room
where they do the bodies.

454
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,414
In Newark tonight,

455
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,017
state troopers
and the National Guard
ceased...

456
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,318
You son of a bitch.

457
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,587
You can't watch
television in here.

458
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,822
Vincent, it's the news.

459
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,324
...President Johnson,
we've been told,

460
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,226
has been following
the situation...

461
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:40,164
Ah, they're never gonna
catch those bastards.
I told the cops.

462
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:45,436
In the dull
and commonplace occurrences
of day-to-day living,

463
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:52,243
one thing stands out
as a completely unique
experience: Colt .45.

464
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,280
Jesus Christ.

465
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,416
The fuck's
the matter with you?

466
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:01,752
You have
no respect for my father,
you fucking animals!

467
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,588
He's dead!

468
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,456
Looks like the riots
are ending though, Dick,
that's good news.

469
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,059
I wish that
the shooter killed you!

470
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,727
All of you!

471
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,140
John Francis Soprano.

472
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,743
On the charge of assault
with a deadly weapon,

473
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,146
I hereby sentence you
to no more than five

474
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:33,317
and no less than two years
in Rahway State Prison.

475
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:57,008
-

476
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,023
Uncle Sally.

477
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,593
I'm Dickie,
your brother Dick's boy.

478
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,370
How are you?

479
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:32,343
You know, I'm sorry,
I know I never came
to visit you before.

480
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,011
My father wouldn't allow it.

481
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,354
I came to tell you...

482
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:48,893
your brother, my dad...
he passed.

483
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,195
They burned him up
in the riots.

484
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,566
I brought you
some sfogliatelle.

485
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,469
I don't eat dairy.

486
00:38:59,136 --> 00:38:59,970
Oh.

487
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,310
Well, you being
out here isolated,

488
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:07,845
out of contact
with the family,

489
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,480
my old man said
you deserved it,

490
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,583
but I want to do whatever I can
to help you from now.

491
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,685
It wasn't right
how they treated you.

492
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,555
I was 25.

493
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:21,425
I murdered a made guy
in our own family.

494
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,829
I'm here for a good reason.
You don't need to help me.

495
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,098
But...

496
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,733
What do you want, Richard?

497
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,841
I'll be honest with you.

498
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,112
I want to do a good deed.

499
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,446
Huh!

500
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,881
A what?

501
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,751
A good deed.

502
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,859
Miles.

503
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,027
Birth of the Cool.

504
00:39:58,462 --> 00:39:59,463
What?

505
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,564
It's a record.

506
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,900
I'm a jazz nut.

507
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,536
Bring me a copy
next time you come.

508
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,438
If you come.

509
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:13,978
-

510
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,289
-Quant'e bella!
-Sì?

511
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,259
It's so beautiful.

512
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,962
We're gonna go down
to Bamberger's.

513
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,465
We're gonna fill
the place with furniture.

514
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,435
Madonna mia.

515
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,504
Mmm.

516
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,809
Could you give us
a few minutes?

517
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,243
You got it.

518
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,524
Aunt Concetta says
you've been looking for a job.

519
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:04,195
At, uh, DiLorenzo Brothers
Beauty Parlor.

520
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,197
I cut hair back in Ariano.

521
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,365
You don't need to do that.

522
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,468
I want to keep
taking care of you.

523
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:14,805
But I like to work, Dickie.
And America has so many work.

524
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,209
Un giorno,  I want to have
my own beauty parlor.

525
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,711
Well, you're not gonna work
for those two  fanooks.

526
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,481
The DiLorenzos?

527
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,305
Motherfucker.

528
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:51,141
-I like that word.

529
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,743
Motherfucker.

530
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,419
Eighteen. Paul's birthday.

531
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,188
We don't take
Beatle birthdays.

532
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,090
We'd go broke.

533
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,593
Fuck it. Make it eight.
Micky Dolenz.

534
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:13,931
I dreamed about
Whitey Ford last night.
He wears number 16.

535
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,202
The boys
basketball team is playing
St. Stephen's this afternoon.

536
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,405
The high temperature today
will be 53 degrees.

537
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:25,509
Faculty advisory,
absentees: 16.

538
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:27,711
Sixteen, I hit the number!

539
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,582
You gotta talk to him.

540
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,584
Johnny should do it.
- You're the only one
he listens to.

541
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,219
Johnny should do it.
You're gonna see him
visiting day.

542
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,620
- Side door's open.

543
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,122
Johnny's just gonna
want to hit him,

544
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,257
and he can't because of
the glass partition

545
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,293
and he's just gonna
get frustrated.

546
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,131
Hey, Jun'.
-I got some
Lady Schick blow dryers.

547
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,600
Livia, take one for yourself.
One for Janice.

548
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,435
I got bigger problems
than blow dryers.

549
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:53,470
Anthony got kicked
out of school.

550
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,272
Let me go talk to him.

551
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,474
I promised Johnny
I'd take care of Tony
while he was in jail.

552
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,144
The way you talk,
you just confuse him.

553
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,946
He only listens to Dickie.

554
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:03,981
Ma vaffanculo.

555
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,750
Jun', leave me
a blower for Joanne.

556
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:12,923
What are you reading?

557
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:18,596
Oh, can't you read
a regular comic?

558
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,631
You know,
Superman, Jughead.

559
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,133
It's about some
Jewish girl and a knight.

560
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,735
And Robin Hood's in it.

561
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:28,172
I didn't know they had Jews
back in the Middle Ages.

562
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,307
Well... the Bible.

563
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:33,510
Anyway, your mother
asked me to talk to you, so...

564
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,280
What, about getting
suspended from school?

565
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,349
Hey, put that down, huh?

566
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,683
Sorry.

567
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:49,860
You know I don't like to
lean on you about stuff.

568
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,430
But you can't start
a gambling operation
at school.

569
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:54,932
I know that...

570
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,266
now.

571
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,535
Hey, don't bullshit me.
You always knew it.

572
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,704
And it's not
just the gambling.
It's everything.

573
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:04,108
The cherry bombs at the YMCA,
letting the air out of
Mrs. Russo's tires...

574
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:05,843
-I apologized to her!
-You talk big about

575
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,511
wanting to be
on the football team
in high school

576
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,446
and you're smoking
already? Oh!

577
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:12,149
You gotta have
a better attitude.

578
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,852
With your father gone,
your mother's got
a lot on her plate.

579
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,854
You gotta be good.

580
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,390
I don't want to go
through this again.

581
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,058
I try to be good.

582
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,561
I don't think so.
Try harder.

583
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,067
Pinky swear?

584
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,468
Jesus.

585
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,570
Hey, you don't talk
to me like that.

586
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,240
See, you're not listening.

587
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,176
Fine. Pinky swear.

588
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,652
All right.

589
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:53,057
One time I went to Playland...

590
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,393
I saw the cops shoot a friend
of my dad's right in the back.

591
00:44:56,493 --> 00:45:00,831
Yeah, Chickie Sasso.
He still can't move
his bowels like normal.

592
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:06,036
I don't want that
to happen to me.

593
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:09,273
And it won't,  gagootz.
Not while I'm around.

594
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,909
We're gonna see
that it don't.

595
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:34,765
Junior. Junior.
Where's Candy tonight?

596
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,133
Migraine.

597
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,935
Again with the migraine.

598
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,070
Keep a close eye
on that one.

599
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,906
She keeps disappearing,
she's probably fucking some
Tom, Dick and Harry.

600
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:44,641
-Found a new gravy train.
-

601
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,710
A guy checks into a hotel,
calls up the front desk,

602
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,913
"I got a leak in the sink."
Clerk says, "Go ahead.

603
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,416
-Customer's always right."
-

604
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:55,085
Yeah, that was funnier when
Henny Youngman told it.

605
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:57,154
No, no, don't... Don't.
Just leave it the way it is.

606
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:01,125
I wonder what the origin
of the sobriquet
"gravy train" is.

607
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,327
They named it after
the dog food.

608
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,995
I don't know
about you, Junior.

609
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,331
Guy tells you your girlfriend's
banging somebody else,

610
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,833
you're worried about
the origin of "gravy train"?

611
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,069
Oh!
-

612
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,971
Oh, smile, my brother.

613
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,843
White flight.

614
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,579
Oh!
It's Hopalong  Che Si Dice.

615
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:23,847
Whatever the fuck
that means.

616
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:27,584
Hey! Language.
There's ladies here.

617
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,186
What can I get you?

618
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,156
Bartender's special tonight,
for the ladies: Pink Squirrel.

619
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:34,525
Courvoisier and Coke.
Water back.

620
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,694
That what they
drink on the plantation?

621
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,933
Oh, you didn't hear?
We're off the plantation.

622
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,769
We got wops digging ditches
since they come over.

623
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,437
Hey, come on.

624
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,486
It's Dickie's business.
Let it go, Paulie.

625
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,655
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

626
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,523
You got a murder warrant
over your head.

627
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:09,026
I'm heading down south.
North Carolina.

628
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,061
So where's your mule?
Get going.

629
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,030
Thing is, I need to
borrow some money.

630
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,899
-How much?
-A grand.

631
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:19,369
All right, I'll tell you what.

632
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,208
I'm gonna give you
five C's. Yeah?

633
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,677
It's my gift to you.
You don't gotta give it back.

634
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,579
No, I want to pay you back.

635
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,581
Ah, it's better this way.
You don't gotta be afraid
to say hello to me,

636
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,917
I don't gotta chase you down.
Won't come between us.

637
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,053
So I guess this is goodbye.

638
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,862
Yeah, you said your goodbye,
so go.

639
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:06,850
You don't stare
at those people.
They don't like it.

640
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,127
Brought you that
record you wanted.

641
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,030
Plus, a couple others
I picked out.

642
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:21,798
What's this?

643
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:25,969
Al Hirt. Trumpet.
He's on Carson all the time.

644
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,939
It's not jazz. Take it back.

645
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,075
These, too.

646
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:42,319
So...

647
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,154
you did your good deed.

648
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,089
Well, don't put it like that.

649
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,126
I plan to do a lot more.

650
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:54,131
Your poor father, huh?

651
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:59,436
He goes down to board up
that Atta Boy business
that he had...

652
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:03,173
and he dies
in that horrible way.

653
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,008
It's just weird, though.

654
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,576
What, weird?

655
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:11,515
My brother's hands were soft.
Like a baby's  pishadeel.

656
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,751
Always with the manicures,
your father.

657
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:16,486
Yeah, what's your point?

658
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:21,124
He never touched a hammer
or a board in his life.

659
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,768
What's your problem?

660
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,642
Well, for one thing...

661
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:41,511
my wife, she can't
get pregnant.

662
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:45,048
You know, it takes a toll.
I want a son so bad.

663
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,650
What would you do?

664
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,152
It's the wanting.

665
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,221
Huh?

666
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,558
The Buddhist will tell you:
"All life is pain."

667
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:59,062
Pain comes from
always wanting things.

668
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,132
A son is not a thing.

669
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,402
It's the wanting.

670
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,810
You know, Tone, we could
still run that numbers game
down at the fucking CYO.

671
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,146
I got fucking suspended,
I can't get in fucking
trouble again.

672
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,482
No. Fucking school
will never know.

673
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,083
I want to make it to
the NFL someday.

674
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,685
For that, I gotta
go to college.

675
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,854
So I gotta watch
my fucking ass.

676
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,723
My old man
told me I gotta run his fucking
restaurant when I grow up.

677
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,658
What does your old man say?

678
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,594
He says
I gotta fucking rob
your old man's restaurant.

679
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:35,665
Do you know who I'd wanna be?
Your Uncle Dickie.

680
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,434
How he fucking dresses.

681
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,937
He said he'd give me $500
if I graduate from
fucking high school.

682
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,439
Fuck, man.

683
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:52,582
of circular time?

684
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:59,389
has got you in its sway

685
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:05,195
has got you in its sway

686
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,299
The '60s ended.

687
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,469
Neil Young gave that
speech from the moon.

688
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:16,106
Then came the RICO statutes
around when I was born.

689
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,210
I wish I had come before that.

690
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:24,481
Hey, Uncle Dick.

691
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,150
They're gonna be here soon.
We gotta get inside and hide.

692
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,554
Hey, Anthony,
you go see
Dirty Harry  like I told you?

693
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,990
"You gotta ask yourself,
do you feel lucky?"

694
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,792
"Well, do you, punk?"

695
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,298
Madonna.

696
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:46,169
It's that old fig tree,
in 'Lino's backyard.

697
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,838
-Nothing changes.
-Yeah.

698
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:53,944
Nothing changes?

699
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,746
That's... that's
Poupette's house.

700
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,685
-What are you mad at me for?
-Ah, you...

701
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,520
Mother...

702
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,956
How did you let this happen?

703
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:08,158
Oh, what do you want
from me, Johnny?

704
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,527
I had plenty on my shoulders
taking care of things
while you were in the joint.

705
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,129
Yeah.

706
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:14,264
Raising Anthony. The disaster
with the Electricians Union.

707
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,799
-Ah!
-Your wife with the cramps.

708
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:18,468
Boo-hoo-hoo!
Look at Dickie Moltisanti.

709
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:21,037
His father gets whacked,
he steps up.

710
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,440
Takes care of his family,
takes care of all the business.

711
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:26,643
Not a peep out of him.
He's younger than you.

712
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,112
Yeah.

713
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,114
- Surprise!

714
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:32,883
Jesus Christ.
- There he is.

715
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,118
All I want to do is
bang my  goomar,
go to sleep.

716
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,053
-Hey.
-Good to see you.

717
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,724
Hey, Paulie,
how's your ma, huh?
- Much better.

718
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:41,958
Johnny.

719
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:44,528
Hey, baby, how are you?
Come here.

720
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:47,397
Did the surprise work?

721
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,499
You know, I'll tell you
what surprised me.

722
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:51,067
You got shiners on
the block, huh?

723
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,336
Oh, look at you.
Not a pound.

724
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,739
He's just a regular
Charlton Heston.

725
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,908
You come,
you visit...

726
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,011
But you don't tell me
they moved in.
On my street.

727
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:02,245
He's a doctor.

728
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,747
-A doctor.
-He's not operating on me.

729
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,682
You gotta berate me
in front of everybody?

730
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:06,650
Ah, Jesus.

731
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:07,551
You know, just like always.

732
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:08,585
Ah,  va' a Napoli.

733
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,853
Come on.

734
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,757
Hi, Dad.

735
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,325
What do you got on?

736
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,661
Go upstairs, right now,
put on some decent clothes.

737
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,597
Johnny, it's what
they're wearing nowadays.

738
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,399
Go do what I said, Janice.

739
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:27,370
Sweetie. You recognize
your daddy, pumpkin?

740
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:31,208
Yeah. That's it. Yeah.

741
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:34,678
What's the matter with you?
Go give your father
a proper hello.  Stunod!

742
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:38,415
Come here.

743
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,086
I missed you, Dad.

744
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:45,522
I missed
you too, kid.

745
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,857
You know, I made your
favorite pizza gain.

746
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,893
Even though it's not Easter.

747
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,762
I got everybody together.
I dressed up.

748
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,699
And you spit on
it all, on me!

749
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:58,068
I didn't invite the coloreds
onto the block!

750
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:59,736
Here we go.

751
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:01,871
Livia,
give him a break.
He just did four years.

752
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,440
I did four years!

753
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,386
I missed
your baked ziti, baby.

754
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:19,389
I put extra veal bones in
with the sausage.

755
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,994
How about you,  chooch?
You gonna be a linebacker, huh?

756
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,664
Coach says
I'm gonna be starting.

757
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,833
-He don't have the makings
of a varsity athlete.
-

758
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:33,003
It was up to me,
you wouldn't be
playing at all,

759
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,171
but you went ahead
and you forged
my signature.

760
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,340
Nah, relax.

761
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,675
He's not gonna get hurt.

762
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,611
Here he is.
Fresh from his nap.

763
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:42,846
Joanne, Joanne...
- Yeah?

764
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,147
He hasn't met Johnny.

765
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:45,515
Aw.

766
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,650
Wow.

767
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,185
Johnny, this is
our Christopher.

768
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:56,159
Hello,
Christopher Moltisanti.
It's your Uncle Johnny.

769
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,761
I'm back from England.

770
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,764
-Go with your daddy.
-Come here.

771
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,600
Oh!  Bambolino!

772
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:07,937
Finally, huh?
Corrado, right?
Got myself a son.

773
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:08,972
Hi.

774
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,141
I hear he's slow
with the talking.

775
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:12,809
Hi, Christopher, hello!

776
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,177
-Oh!

777
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,279
What's the matter?
Don't cry. It's only me,

778
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:17,847
-your Uncle Tony.
- Oh!

779
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:19,215
-What's wrong.
Cootchie-coo!
- Oh! Oh!

780
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,984
Okay. All right. All right.

781
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:24,020
You know, every time
you're near him
he cries like this.

782
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,722
I didn't do anything.

783
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:29,959
What happened?
-

784
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:31,161
It's okay.

785
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:32,862
Look at that.

786
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:35,632
I don't know what it is,
it's like I scare him
or something.

787
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:39,569
Some babies, when they
come into the world,

788
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:43,173
know all kinds of things
from the other side.

789
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:59,723
Night descends
As the sun's light ends

790
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:03,059
And Black comes back,
to blend again

791
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:05,228
-Wake up, nigga
- Yes!

792
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,030
And with the death of the sun

793
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:07,997
Wake up

794
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:09,899
Night and blackness become one

795
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:11,267
Wake up

796
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,002
-Blackness being you
- Wake up, nigga

797
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:16,039
Peeping through the red
The white, and the blue

798
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:18,108
Dreaming of bars,
Black civilizations

799
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,776
That once flourished and grew

800
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:20,944
-Wake up, nigga
-Hey!

801
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,879
Wake up, niggas,
or y'all through!

802
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:25,215
He's right. He's right.

803
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:27,717
Drowning in the puddles
Of the white man's spit

804
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:28,952
Wake up

805
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,286
As you
pause for some drawers

806
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,921
-In the midst of shit
- Wake up

807
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:35,024
And ain't got nothing
to save your funky-ass with

808
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:37,394
-Wake up, nigga
-You cool, fool

809
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,796
Sipping on a menthol cigarette
'round midnight

810
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,732
Wake up
- Rapping about how
the Big Apple is outta sight

811
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,901
Wake up
- When you
ain't never had a bite

812
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:45,935
Wake up

813
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:48,605
Who are you fooling?
Me, you?

814
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:51,307
Wake up, niggas,
or we're all through!

815
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:54,144
- Yeah! Yeah!

816
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,424
That's some inspirational shit.
Even the speeches.

817
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:11,728
This decides me.

818
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:14,497
Know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna start my own book.

819
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,665
You're gonna do what?

820
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,267
We're gonna start...

821
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:21,905
first Black numbers bank
in the Central Ward.

822
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:30,346
Nigga, you talking
about facing down
the motherfucking mafia.

823
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,248
Frank Lucas will be my backer.

824
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:35,018
He's got money
up his ass from the skag.

825
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,352
You know the Dope King?

826
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,087
Down home.

827
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:40,457
Country boys.

828
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:43,693
This ain't Greensboro,
North Cackalacky.

829
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:46,529
The Italians got
soldiers over there.

830
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,131
Okay?
That's what they call 'em.

831
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:51,201
What... what's the matter,
you ain't no soldier?

832
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,136
Never thought about
myself that way, no.

833
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:54,304
Well, think about it.

834
00:57:56,773 --> 00:58:00,009
Right. "He's got a gun,"
you think, "and I haven't."

835
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,444
You figure it's the gun.

836
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,481
Well, listen, soldier.

837
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:07,884
Thousands of guys got guns,
but there's only one
Johnny Rocco!

838
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,953
How do you
account for it?

839
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:12,021
Well,
he knows what he wants.
Don't you, Rocco?

840
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,957
-Sure.
-  What's that?

841
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:15,992
Tell him, Rocco.

842
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:17,393
Well, I want, uh...

843
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,063
He wants more.
Don't you, Rocco?

844
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,898
Yeah, that's it. More.

845
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,733
That's right, I want more.

846
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:27,904
Here. Why don't you buy
you and your friends
some of those...

847
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,739
McDonald's.

848
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,574
-The burgers?
-Yeah.

849
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,309
-  You,
do you know what you want?

850
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:35,178
Yes, and I
had hopes once, but...

851
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,247
Hopes for what?

852
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,483
A world in which
there's no place
for Johnny Rocco.

853
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:43,553
Okay, soldier, you can
make your hopes come true.

854
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,422
But you gotta die for it.

855
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,525
See where I'm aiming?
Right at your belly.

856
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,094
Go ahead, shoot.

857
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:57,033
-Your turn, Daddy.
- All right.

858
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:08,578
Hey, Hopalong  Che Si Dice.

859
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,248
Oh, fuck.

860
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,288
How's it going, Harold?

861
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,623
Cyril, how's your ass?

862
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:23,092
How you doing, son?

863
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,362
I'm taking my nephew
to the Yankees game.

864
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,867
Is something funny
back there?

865
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:32,569
Sorry, Uncle Dick.

866
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,704
No, really, I'm sorry!

867
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:36,139
You fuckstick.

868
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,974
I heard your ass
was back in Jersey.

869
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,943
You still got that warrant
over your head?

870
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:43,246
Lead detective died.
Nobody gives a shit.

871
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,914
Leon Overall
had been a white boy,

872
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:47,150
it'd be a whole
different story.

873
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,954
Hey, Harold,
how 'bout you come around,
talk to me over here.

874
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,964
When are you gonna come back
and work for me again?

875
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:06,002
Got stuff of
my own percolating.

876
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,671
While you're waiting for
that Maxwell House to boil...

877
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,828
Hey, how much he give you?

878
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,833
Like I'm a fucking
Pullman porter.

879
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:38,668
Man, it's $100.

880
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,943
I need to see the lease.

881
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:48,878
Here you go.

882
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,013
Thank you.

883
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,217
Due per cento
increase every year.

884
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,386
Six and a half years still.

885
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,520
Right?

886
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,821
-I like.
-Yeah.

887
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,724
It's Dionne Warwick.

888
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,960
Comes from right over here
in South Orange.

889
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:05,495
I love Dionne Warwick.

890
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:07,030
Me, too.

891
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,033
I wonder where she
gets her hair done.

892
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:12,869
Probably some fancy place
in Beverly Hills.

893
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:16,372
I bet she pays $100.
Oof!  Marone!

894
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:18,708
I should move
to Beverly's Hill.

895
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,811
Where'd you learn to do hair?

896
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:23,746
I learned from  mia mamma.

897
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,515
-Mmm.
-My...

898
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:28,985
She had a chair
in the front room.

899
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:33,222
Women would come,
and I sweep up.

900
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:34,257
And I watch.

901
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,758
Oh, how wonderful.

902
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,061
But that's not the life
I want for me.

903
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:39,662
-Mmm.
-Over there,

904
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:41,831
you get old so fast.

905
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:45,001
Ten children and a big,
black dress.

906
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,703
You know, over there,

907
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,938
I wanted to be a priest.

908
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,941
-You mean "nun."
-No, no, priest.

909
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,510
Nuns have to do
what they told.

910
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:58,081
The priest is the boss.  Capo.

911
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,252
So you never tried
the convent, huh?

912
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,221
Not for me.

913
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:08,891
I could not stand the silence.
No male.

914
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:10,293
No, yeah.

915
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:15,098
You wind up doing... push-ups
in the asparagus garden.

916
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:16,299
You know?

917
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:22,705
What's so funny?

918
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,574
Nuns.

919
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,110
Yeah. They weren't so funny
when they were hitting me
with a ruler.

920
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,714
First thing you gotta do
is look at the lease.
Is that, uh, the lease?

921
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,316
We already look at the lease.

922
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,784
It's good.

923
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,053
Oh, yeah? I'm gonna
look it over.

924
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:46,596
Two percent increase a year,
six years still remaining.

925
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:49,398
There's just one thing
I want to make better.

926
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:50,933
Oh, yeah?

927
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,602
-New sinks.
-Hmm.

928
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,004
Those are disgust.

929
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:58,674
We can do that, sure.

930
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,576
This is some
fantastic salsicce.

931
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:02,078
Guarda basso.

932
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,517
I am worried about
the fucking boiler, though.

933
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,418
Looked like shit.

934
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:10,920
Inspector says it's fine.

935
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:13,456
Okay, okay. But the thing
about remodeling is,

936
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:15,258
you start with the sinks
and then you go,

937
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:16,359
"We might as well
do this other thing
while we're at it."

938
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,326
It spins out of control.

939
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:18,294
Ah.

940
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:22,532
We don't want to be pouring
good money after bad.

941
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,469
Can you stop eating
for one minute?

942
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:31,607
Finisci di mangiare
poi stammi a sentire.

943
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:35,311
No  capisce,
but I'm all fuckin' ears.

944
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,847
So we're not going to buy it
for me, the beauty parlor?

945
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:41,217
All I'm saying,
I don't want us walking
into a stupid situation.

946
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,618
You think I'm stupid?

947
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:44,554
Oh, let me ask you,
what are you, on the rag?

948
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:48,057
Every time I say
something you don't like,
you ask me if I'm...

949
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,859
il marchese.

950
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:53,296
First you tell me
to find a store I can turn
into beauty parlor.

951
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:55,398
I do that.
You say it looks good.

952
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:59,168
Then you say,
"No, let's buy a place
already a beauty parlor."

953
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:01,704
I find this place.
Now the boiler!

954
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:03,973
Sweetheart, why are we arguing
about fucking plumbing?

955
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,576
I always want to do
right by you!

956
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,744
You know, I love you!

957
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,179
Io ti voglio piu bene
di quanto tu ne vuoi a me,
lo vuoi capire o no?

958
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,547
You know
I don't speak Italian!

959
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:13,316
Maybe you should learn!

960
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:14,584
Oh, where you going?

961
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,019
To put on a robe.
I'm cold.

962
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,710
Better hurry up.
Pot roast night.

963
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:42,545
Right. You know Wednesdays
I gotta go home.

964
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,013
And what are you
getting so pissy about?

965
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,948
Why did I make the sausage?

966
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:48,584
To make me happy?

967
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,053
Because I love it?

968
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,356
But it's not as good as
Joanne's fucking pot roast.

969
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:55,391
Oh, you're digging
at Joanne again.

970
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:56,559
I hate her.

971
01:04:56,626 --> 01:05:00,229
Of course you do.
It's only natural.

972
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:03,032
Go home and eat.
I don't want the beauty salon.

973
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:04,300
No,  vaffanculo.

974
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,735
Motherfucker!

975
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,438
You think you know everything!

976
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:34,330
Jackie, you drive stick?

977
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,898
-Fuck no.
-I do!

978
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:36,832
You drive.

979
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,801
Grab his arm, hold him down.

980
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,137
Fucking punks!

981
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,412
We're gonna get in
so much fucking trouble!

982
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:51,747
My father's gonna
use the belt on me!

983
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:53,482
You little shit!

984
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:57,987
If anybody tells
anybody about this,
next time we use the belt.

985
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:01,691
stand back,

986
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:07,530
Ah, don't worry
'bout me, babe

987
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,533
Oh! Come here!
Free ice cream!

988
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:18,541
Here, here.

989
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,712
Get more of it.

990
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:30,052
Here, here.
Here you go.
Here you go.

991
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:33,489
How 'bout this one?
There you go, sweetheart.

992
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,461
That manicott
at Vesuvio's is so rich.

993
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,830
How'd you hear
about them throwing
Mister Softee a beating?

994
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:43,065
His cousin
Tony Blundetto
told Janice.

995
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,301
I was down in the islands
when he pulled that shit.

996
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:48,237
If I was home, I'd have
given him a  schiaffo
he'd never forget.

997
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,006
What's he want to be
when he gets older?

998
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:52,408
Thinks he's gonna be
a football player.

999
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,845
He's good.
I don't think
he's pro material.

1000
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:57,546
What do you think, Dick?

1001
01:06:57,646 --> 01:07:00,549
Probably not. But who knows,
he puts on a few pounds,

1002
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:02,351
four years of college ball...

1003
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:04,320
He should go to work
for my cousin Frank

1004
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:06,088
in the patio
furniture business.

1005
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,390
Here we go with that tune.

1006
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,858
So maybe he's not
a ball player, but Li,

1007
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:10,159
you don't wanna step
on the kid's dream.

1008
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:11,560
You always
take his side.

1009
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,929
Look, you give him
the best advice you can,

1010
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,732
you lead by example,
he'll make the right decision.

1011
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:19,101
This kid's got what it takes.
That's what I'm saying.

1012
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,937
We all do things like that
when we're kids, right?

1013
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,773
Beat up the Mister Softee man.

1014
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:27,076
If my Christopher
grew up to be like Tony,
I'd be goddamn proud of him.

1015
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:28,844
I told him the other day,
I said,

1016
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:31,247
"You play football
for a career,
it doesn't last long.

1017
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:34,250
You wind up
an old crippled man
by the time you're 32."

1018
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:37,887
Bobby Piocosta, he's a junior,
on Anthony's team.

1019
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:40,289
He fractured
his shoulder last week.

1020
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:41,924
The mother was hysterical.

1021
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:44,126
They had to take him to
a specialist at St. Barnabas.

1022
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,861
You think the school's
gonna pay for that?

1023
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:47,797
That's some
Christmas present, huh?

1024
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:51,367
Having your kid laid up.
He can't help outside,
hang the decorations.

1025
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,135
He can't help
shovel the walk...

1026
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:06,949
Don't give me that look.

1027
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,943
I though it will be different.

1028
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:36,846
What?

1029
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:40,649
Make love with a Black man.

1030
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:42,918
Is it?

1031
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:46,122
No.

1032
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,361
It's all about
Italian men, huh?

1033
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:55,197
There's stories
about Dean Martin
and Rossano Brazzi,

1034
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,799
how they're great lovers.

1035
01:08:58,467 --> 01:08:59,702
If you feed them.

1036
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:04,206
Oh!

1037
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:07,877
You gotta give Dickie his
meatballs and his noodles.

1038
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,012
I'm Dickie's  comare.

1039
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:17,386
Dickie and his friends,
they like their women
to stay at home.

1040
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,388
Don't go out.

1041
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:21,524
Wait on them, hand and feet.

1042
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,996
I'd stack my bread
if you were my girl.

1043
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:30,232
You want to have
your own beauty parlor?

1044
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,902
Knock yourself out.
I'd even back it.

1045
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,970
You want your woman to work?

1046
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:37,239
No, but I'd be
real proud of her.

1047
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:40,509
Owning a business.

1048
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:43,012
My mama used to
take in the washing.

1049
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,815
I always respected her
for that.

1050
01:09:54,056 --> 01:09:58,260
Dickie says colored men
don't have no head
for making money.

1051
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,676
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

1052
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:30,926
You will not be able
to stay home brother!

1053
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:33,229
Four, two, seven.

1054
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:34,697
Box it for me?

1055
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:36,632
You know, another nurse
hit the number last night.

1056
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:37,933
Big time.

1057
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:39,802
Damn. Who was it?

1058
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,904
What do I know, it was
up in the First Ward.

1059
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,639
It was, uh...
It was St. Michaels.

1060
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,642
That jinxes it for me.

1061
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:48,377
The revolution will not
be brought to you

1062
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:50,546
by the  Schaefer Award Theatre.

1063
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:54,116
And will not star Natalie Woods
and Steve McQueen
or Bullwinkle and Julia.

1064
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,954
See, the law of averages say
you got the same chance
of hitting

1065
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:00,322
as any two random people.

1066
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,258
Yeah, but two people
at the same time

1067
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:04,059
don't have
the same chance of winning.

1068
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:05,561
That's the law of averages.

1069
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:08,130
That's a fallacy,
Ms. Johnson.
It's all random.

1070
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:09,765
You don't understand fate.

1071
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:15,137
What do you got
for me, professor?

1072
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:18,474
See you tomorrow.

1073
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:28,117
Tomorrow there'll be
a brother here for the pickup.

1074
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:32,288
No more whitey's cut.

1075
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:41,830
What the fuck, man?

1076
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:47,836
The revolution will be live.

1077
01:11:55,978 --> 01:12:01,116
And this Black guy,
Harold McBrayer,
popped one of my guys.

1078
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:03,052
He used to be a runner
of mine.

1079
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,454
We don't know who ordered it.
We can't find McBrayer.

1080
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,791
So what do you
want from me?

1081
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:11,860
I was thinking maybe
you could ask in here.

1082
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,962
Nation of Islam,
talk to Alonzo Turner,

1083
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:15,564
see if any of them
knows anything.

1084
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:18,067
I don't talk
to people in here.

1085
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:21,170
I mostly read all day.

1086
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,676
How you doing
on your merit badges?

1087
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:33,082
I'm coaching
a beep baseball team.

1088
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,683
A who?

1089
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,886
It's baseball. For blind kids.

1090
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:41,023
Get the fuck outta here.

1091
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,591
No, for real.

1092
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,403
Run, run, run, come on!

1093
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:55,904
Shortstop, left!

1094
01:12:57,339 --> 01:12:59,274
-Attaboy!

1095
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:02,578
Way to go, Coach.
Our boys looked
sterling out there today.

1096
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:06,081
Two, four, six, eight,
who do we appreciate?

1097
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:10,052
Coach Moltisanti!
Coach Moltisanti!

1098
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:11,620
You're a saint!

1099
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,739
Oh, shit!
- Gun!

1100
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:08,677
Where's Harold?

1101
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:11,013
In your mother's
fat guinea ass.

1102
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,681
You take that back!

1103
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:14,983
Who put him up to it,
Angelo Salerno?

1104
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:17,186
Anthony Bello?

1105
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,787
Chef Boyardee.

1106
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:22,024
-Come.
-

1107
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:25,027
Put him on the table!

1108
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:28,764
Pussy, grab his legs.

1109
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,203
What are you gonna do,
rotate my tires?

1110
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,208
Dick, I just got this jacket.

1111
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:43,879
You...

1112
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,449
Open!

1113
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:48,383
What about it?

1114
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,551
Fuck you!

1115
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:56,058
Stop for a minute!

1116
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,193
God damn it!

1117
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:00,729
Oh! I don't fucking...

1118
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,232
-So?
-

1119
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,736
Harold! Harold McBrayer!

1120
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,304
I asked you
whose idea it was!

1121
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:12,641
I told you! It was Harold!
Nobody put him up to it!

1122
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:13,842
Oh.

1123
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:35,163
The fucker
acted on his own?

1124
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:37,933
All right, Dickie.

1125
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,902
- Go get it.

1126
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:46,608
That fall,
Johnny moved to the suburbs,
the Black thing.

1127
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:49,945
And he was seriously earning.

1128
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:53,115
This move made
Tony half a pussy,
in my estimation.

1129
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:58,020
What made you think
it was a good idea

1130
01:15:58,086 --> 01:16:00,455
to steal the answers
to the geometry test?

1131
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,761
I didn't study,
and, uh, I needed to pass,

1132
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:08,430
so I could stay
on the football team.

1133
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,865
You know,

1134
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:11,867
you got Charlie Nodzak
in trouble, too,

1135
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:14,903
when you paid him
for the answers.

1136
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,372
Well, he was the only kid
I knew on the mimeo squad.

1137
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:20,242
Well, Charlie was
on the honor roll.

1138
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:22,411
And you're missing the point.

1139
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:24,613
You know stealing
the tests was wrong.

1140
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:28,717
Yeah, I guess so.

1141
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:30,552
But if you're gonna
kick me out of school,

1142
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:33,221
I mean, you should just do it,
instead of us talking about it.

1143
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,593
You talk a lot at home?

1144
01:16:39,828 --> 01:16:41,096
I don't know.

1145
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:47,502
Well, your dad, for example,
what does he talk to you about?

1146
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:51,807
The lawn.

1147
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,109
What about the lawn?

1148
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:57,179
I don't know,

1149
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:01,249
he goes to Yankee Stadium
and he comes home and says
our lawn looks crummy.

1150
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:05,420
What about your mother?
Is she someone
who likes to talk a lot?

1151
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,357
I guess so.

1152
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:11,827
Well...

1153
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:14,796
what makes her happy?

1154
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:16,632
Happy?

1155
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:17,933
My mother?

1156
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:25,440
Let's go, Anthony.

1157
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:28,810
I wonder if I
could talk to you for a moment
alone, Mrs. Soprano?

1158
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,279
Well, it's gonna
have to be fast,

1159
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:32,981
'cause I'm parked
at the hydrant.

1160
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,622
On the basis of
the Stanford-Binet,

1161
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:43,225
he's high IQ,
but you know that.

1162
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:47,129
You can't prove it by me.
He's got a D-plus average.

1163
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:51,667
Well, that's because
he doesn't apply himself,
but he is smart.

1164
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:58,507
There's a big difference
between a smart person
and a smart aleck.

1165
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:03,745
I also administered
the Briggs-Myer personality
inventory just now,

1166
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:06,181
and the results tell us,
he's a leader.

1167
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:11,086
"Enthusiastic,
insightful, playful."

1168
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:13,822
Ah, you're talking
through your hat.

1169
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:19,594
He did tell me one thing
I'd like to share with you.

1170
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,230
But it's gotta be fast,
because I'm still
at the hydrant.

1171
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:23,932
Do you remember
a children's book called

1172
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,400
-Sutter's Mill?
-No.

1173
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,070
About the gold rush
in California?

1174
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:30,839
Yeah, maybe I do. Yeah?

1175
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:35,043
He told me about a night
your husband was... away.

1176
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:39,414
And you got in the bed
with Anthony and hugged him.

1177
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,123
He said that?

1178
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:51,860
No, his exact words were
you "snuggled up close."

1179
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:03,638
Yeah. Yeah,
I remember that now.

1180
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,141
You read to him
from that book.

1181
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,076
Long into the night,
apparently.

1182
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:10,412
He remembered details.

1183
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:12,147
He didn't know
the word "ingot,"

1184
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,549
and you explained it to him.

1185
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:22,791
He said it was one of his
best memories of his life.

1186
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:36,605
Is that a hotel Bible?

1187
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,275
I forget where I got it.

1188
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:44,479
Baby, Cousin Cyril is dead.

1189
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:02,831
You're supposed
to do an hour.

1190
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:04,966
It's an hour on,
ten minutes off.

1191
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,869
All of a sudden youse
two are only on 40 minutes
and then disappear.

1192
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:10,105
We don't know
where the fuck you are.

1193
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:12,774
We're off somewhere thinking,
"What more can we do for
Gentleman Dick and Johnny?"

1194
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,376
Don't get cute.

1195
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,378
Where's Giuseppina tonight?

1196
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:19,548
The movies
with her girlfriend.

1197
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,183
I would eat her shit.

1198
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:22,384
Oh!

1199
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:28,156
You don't talk
about her that way.

1200
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:30,392
In fact, you don't
talk about her at all.

1201
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,726
Hey, take it easy!

1202
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,728
-I love her. I love her!
-

1203
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,697
Get down!
-

1204
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,335
Hey, asshole!
- Dickie!

1205
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:42,170
Motherfucker!

1206
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,246
Come on, you fucker.
Come here.

1207
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:52,914
-You like that, huh?
-

1208
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:54,716
-How 'bout that?
- Come on,
you motherfuckers.

1209
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:58,587
Fuck!

1210
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:13,501
No, no, no! Frankie,
Frankie, Frankie! Frankie!

1211
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:15,270
No!

1212
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:17,606
You mother...

1213
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:22,611
Shit!

1214
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:56,938
Anthony, come eat!

1215
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,712
There's my big boy.

1216
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,880
Oh, cool, man, a hamburger.

1217
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:08,550
I thought you'd like a change
from a mortadella sandwich.

1218
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,385
I made it special for you.

1219
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,689
You look nice.

1220
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:16,458
Aw.

1221
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:20,028
Me and Aunt Mary
are going to the city
to see  No, No, Nanette.

1222
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,063
What's that?

1223
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:23,832
Broadway. A play.

1224
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:26,568
Shoes are killing my bunions.

1225
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:29,137
You should go see
Dr. Cuomo.

1226
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:31,539
We don't go to him anymore.

1227
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:33,842
We don't?

1228
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:36,911
He said some
very rude things to me.

1229
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,146
Like what?

1230
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:41,916
He wants me to take pills
for my sleeping.

1231
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,918
And... and other things.

1232
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,355
I'm not some lunatic.

1233
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:51,092
No, but maybe some
medicine would be good.

1234
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:54,095
Ah, you and your father.
Why don't you get in line
to blame me?

1235
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,264
I wasn't blaming you,
I was just saying...

1236
01:23:56,364 --> 01:24:00,001
This new thing...
called Elavil.

1237
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:01,903
For people who are sick
in the head.

1238
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:12,113
Of a mother's little helper

1239
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:13,048
What?

1240
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,617
It's a song.

1241
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:16,718
It's by the Stones.

1242
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:18,686
Exactly what I'm talking about.

1243
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:21,289
They're drug addicts.
I don't take drugs.

1244
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:25,026
The song's not saying
that you take drugs, it's...

1245
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:30,732
You smoking marijuana,
I suppose?

1246
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:33,468
Mom, I'm on the team.

1247
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:36,471
Your sister is.
I'm almost sure of it.

1248
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:38,807
-This hamburger's great, Mom.
It's really good.
-Agh!

1249
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,142
Go on.

1250
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:43,078
I went to all that trouble

1251
01:24:43,144 --> 01:24:45,647
just so we could have
a nice conversation for once,
and for what?

1252
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:48,550
How am I supposed to enjoy
a Broadway show

1253
01:24:48,616 --> 01:24:50,051
with my children
and their pot?

1254
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:51,619
Ma, I don't smoke pot!

1255
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:53,488
Well, your sister comes in here
smelling like a gypsy.

1256
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:56,091
Well, I'm not my sister.
I'm always being accused.

1257
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:59,327
Oh! Poor you!

1258
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:23,318
Sempre, sì,
sempre problemi al cuore.

1259
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:27,589
Don't look so blue, kid.

1260
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:30,692
You and me'll cut out,
go play catch.

1261
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:32,193
It's raining.

1262
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:33,661
...sa benedica,
gets put in the ground,

1263
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:34,462
all they want to do
is eat my food.

1264
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:38,766
It's not an Irish wake,
right, no food.

1265
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:39,834
You get carried to your car.

1266
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:41,669
Watch your step there, boss.

1267
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:48,209
-How you doing?
- How you been?

1268
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:55,150
Eckley,
how's the boy?

1269
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:57,485
Wonder what they
talk about in there.

1270
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:09,464
Uncle Dick, can I talk
to you for a minute?

1271
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:10,965
What's up, Joe Cocker?

1272
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:13,368
All right, I'm gonna
wait in the car.

1273
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:15,236
You help her? Help her.

1274
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:16,304
Well, spit it out.

1275
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:20,508
You ever heard of this?

1276
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:23,511
Yeah, so, what about it?

1277
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:25,580
Well, my mom's been
in a bad mood lately.

1278
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:31,152
The doctor said that
this medicine could help her,
but she won't take it.

1279
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:32,687
So what do you want from me?

1280
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:35,924
So I was thinking maybe
you could talk to her.

1281
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,392
What about your old man?

1282
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:39,694
Nah, she's not speaking to him.
He did something.

1283
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:41,596
I see the way
she looks at you.

1284
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:43,865
Always sits
next to you at dinners.

1285
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:46,000
She bought you that
fur hat for Christmas.

1286
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:47,769
I never wear it.

1287
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:50,905
I mean... she looks up to you.

1288
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:53,107
And maybe you could
get her some.

1289
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,275
You need a prescription.

1290
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:55,577
I can't get it
in my own name.

1291
01:26:55,677 --> 01:26:57,078
I know you can get anything.

1292
01:26:57,178 --> 01:26:58,446
Don't be a wise-ass.

1293
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:01,449
I'm not, I'm just saying
it could make her happy.

1294
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:02,750
Even Janice says.

1295
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,118
Janice.

1296
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,753
There's somebody we all
want to take advice from.

1297
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:09,023
Anthony!

1298
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:11,926
The pros play in the rain.

1299
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:15,463
Ah,
what are you doing, Jun'?
-Uncle Jun'!

1300
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,969
Oh,  Madonna mia!

1301
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:22,237
Stay down. Don't move him!

1302
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:23,471
Uncle Jun'!

1303
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:24,739
I just said
don't move him!

1304
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:27,942
Your sister's cunt!

1305
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:29,310
Corrado!

1306
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,546
I'm calling an ambulance.
God damn it.

1307
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:33,481
Here you go. Here you go.

1308
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,250
-Take my hand.
-Cocksucker!

1309
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:41,456
-

1310
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:49,264
or understand me

1311
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:54,836
they all hand me

1312
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:58,506
These are Frank Sinatra, Jr.
tickets for your uncle.

1313
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:01,843
I gotta fly down
to the dog track.

1314
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:05,013
They boast a string of hits
that seems to have no end,

1315
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:06,848
out of Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania,

1316
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:09,617
the mighty Delfonics.

1317
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:14,355
Hey, kid.
How's your rash?

1318
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:15,923
Uncle Dickie around?

1319
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:21,629
Hey.

1320
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:29,771
Mezzanine?

1321
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:31,706
What the fuck.

1322
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:33,374
What?

1323
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:35,510
That medicine.

1324
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:36,778
Oh...

1325
01:28:36,844 --> 01:28:38,780
You nervous Nellie,
I got stuff to do.

1326
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:45,386
Hey, hey, come here.

1327
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:47,188
I want to show you something.

1328
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:57,498
Holy shit. JBLs.

1329
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:02,203
A pair of them are yours
to take home.

1330
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:05,239
Yeah, well, they're hot.

1331
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,708
Eh, fell off a truck.

1332
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:08,910
Far out, man.

1333
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:13,014
Oh!

1334
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:14,148
Ten-inch woofers.

1335
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:18,519
I want to go to college.

1336
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:20,254
I can't get caught
with shit like this.

1337
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,090
Okay, my friend Hesh...

1338
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,259
says only goys
and children pay retail.

1339
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,262
This isn't wholesale,
it's totally on the arm.

1340
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:33,201
Look...

1341
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:36,938
You want to be a civilian,
I appreciate that.
I'm all for it.

1342
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:39,207
But pay attention to me
for once, okay?

1343
01:29:39,273 --> 01:29:41,008
You take the speakers, right?

1344
01:29:41,075 --> 01:29:44,579
At the same time,
you promise yourself
these speakers are it.

1345
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:46,247
Now, you say to yourself,

1346
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:48,583
"This is the last time
I'm ever gonna
steal something."

1347
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:50,017
And you stick to it.

1348
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:54,088
It's that simple.

1349
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,942
-

1350
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:20,715
Maybe... Maybe
I should get on top.

1351
01:30:35,163 --> 01:30:36,164
Agh!

1352
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:39,834
Fucking Dickie Moltisanti!

1353
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:45,907
It's more than a month now!

1354
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:47,575
For God's sake, Corrado.

1355
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:50,511
He didn't push you
down the stairs,
you slipped.

1356
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:52,580
He got a good laugh
out of it, though.

1357
01:30:57,819 --> 01:30:59,854
Any excuse not to fuck.

1358
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:06,360
They don't vote
the motherfucker
out of the White House,

1359
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:09,030
somebody gonna
assassinate his lying ass.

1360
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:11,165
Azalea, you got it!

1361
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:14,769
Say, hey!

1362
01:31:14,836 --> 01:31:17,472
There's my farm boy
from the Garden State.

1363
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:19,040
-Where's my tomatoes?

1364
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,541
Brought you collard greens.

1365
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:23,010
Ah, now you talkin'.

1366
01:31:24,879 --> 01:31:25,947
Sit down.

1367
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:28,616
Have a hot chocolate
and Baileys.

1368
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:29,817
So, we square?

1369
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:31,819
Ooh, Chanel.

1370
01:31:37,124 --> 01:31:37,892
Small bills.

1371
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:39,293
You're doing good.

1372
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,895
Soon I'll be in
the stratosphere with you.

1373
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:42,363
Call me Buzz Aldrin.

1374
01:31:42,463 --> 01:31:45,132
Well, Buzz,
gonna hype you again.

1375
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:46,868
State lottery's coming.

1376
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:49,904
Your woman's not gonna be
wearing French footwear
very long.

1377
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:51,539
Now, with smack,

1378
01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:54,809
you got white kids coming in
from Long Island, New Jersey,

1379
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:56,978
Westchester
to the East Village,

1380
01:31:57,044 --> 01:32:00,348
paying 30 bucks to
stick their arm in a hole.

1381
01:32:00,414 --> 01:32:04,218
Invisible person
on the other side
finds a vein,

1382
01:32:04,318 --> 01:32:05,553
shoots 'em up...

1383
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:09,223
Should tell you something
about the future.

1384
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:11,726
You make a good point.
We'll talk.

1385
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:12,660
Thanks.

1386
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:17,331
This week I gotta...

1387
01:32:17,398 --> 01:32:21,202
gotta do something about
this guinea motherfucker
or he'll do me.

1388
01:32:21,269 --> 01:32:23,037
Ah, DiMeo?

1389
01:32:23,104 --> 01:32:25,072
Nah, Dickie Moltisanti.

1390
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:29,076
Controls the numbers,
whole rest of Newark.

1391
01:32:29,176 --> 01:32:31,445
You maybe need
an assist on the play?

1392
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:36,784
Why would you want
to do that for me?

1393
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:40,021
I got my own issues
with the Five Families.

1394
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:41,889
I appreciate it, Frank, but...

1395
01:32:42,957 --> 01:32:45,126
Terms of the community.

1396
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:47,028
I'd better do this myself.

1397
01:32:48,763 --> 01:32:50,097
Darryl.

1398
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:58,539
Merry Christmas, Buzz.

1399
01:33:14,655 --> 01:33:19,327
in the slipstream

1400
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:22,763
of your dream

1401
01:33:24,832 --> 01:33:28,436
steel rims crack

1402
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:32,340
in the back roads stop

1403
01:34:03,504 --> 01:34:05,373
I'm so hungry.

1404
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:10,011
I got news.

1405
01:34:10,111 --> 01:34:13,481
That beauty parlor?
I took it over.

1406
01:34:15,616 --> 01:34:17,018
For me?

1407
01:34:17,118 --> 01:34:19,020
We'll be partners.

1408
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,788
It'll be in my name,
but you'll run it.

1409
01:34:20,855 --> 01:34:23,391
Exactly how you want it.
I'll be hands off.

1410
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:38,806
in the slipstream

1411
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:44,211
of your dream

1412
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:47,381
in the back roads stop

1413
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:26,353
Hey,
what did the bartender say
when the horse came in?

1414
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:27,755
"Why the long face?"

1415
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:30,725
You told me that
a million times.

1416
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:33,728
Yeah, so?
Why the long face?

1417
01:35:35,362 --> 01:35:37,031
I'm all, uh...

1418
01:35:37,765 --> 01:35:39,433
intronata.

1419
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:42,103
You're mixed up? Well,
what are you mixed up about?

1420
01:35:43,804 --> 01:35:45,473
So many things.

1421
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:48,109
Ten minutes ago, you were
laughing like an idiot.
What did I do?

1422
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:51,412
The beauty parlor.

1423
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:52,480
The beaut--

1424
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,381
I thought that's
what you wanted.

1425
01:35:54,448 --> 01:35:56,817
More than anything.

1426
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:59,420
But now we partners
in business.

1427
01:35:59,487 --> 01:36:01,322
It's like a marriage.

1428
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:07,128
I'm alone so much.

1429
01:36:09,563 --> 01:36:11,065
I get lonely.

1430
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:15,169
Maybe you didn't
love me anymore.

1431
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:17,271
Hey, if I don't
love you anymore,

1432
01:36:17,338 --> 01:36:19,073
you won't mistake it
for a maybe.

1433
01:36:22,977 --> 01:36:25,112
Someone else came along.

1434
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:32,653
I said yes.

1435
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:36,290
Who?

1436
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:39,794
Don't make me say.

1437
01:36:41,529 --> 01:36:44,465
What, you said,
"Yes, come fuck me?"

1438
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:46,801
Is that what
you're trying to say?
What else, yes?

1439
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:49,537
It didn't mean
anything, Dickie.

1440
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:51,305
-I love you!
-How many times?

1441
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:52,473
I don't know.

1442
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:54,008
You don't know?

1443
01:36:54,108 --> 01:36:55,843
So many times
you can't remember?
Who was he?

1444
01:36:55,943 --> 01:36:57,711
-I doesn't matter, it's over!
-Who was he?

1445
01:36:57,812 --> 01:37:00,014
-I can't!
-Tell me! Fucking tell me.

1446
01:37:00,114 --> 01:37:01,282
Promise you won't hurt him!

1447
01:37:01,348 --> 01:37:02,650
I don't promise anything,

1448
01:37:02,716 --> 01:37:03,984
but you don't tell me,
it's gonna be worse.

1449
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,154
Harold.

1450
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:28,242
You fucked that
murdering nigger?

1451
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:30,511
But I don't
love him, Dickie!

1452
01:37:30,578 --> 01:37:33,347
I love you! Please! Don't!

1453
01:37:34,148 --> 01:37:37,084
No, please! No! No!

1454
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:13,921
Ah!

1455
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,576
a girl like you

1456
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:22,856
a girl like you

1457
01:39:28,862 --> 01:39:32,299
One thing
I still miss at Christmas...

1458
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:35,836
The Seven Fishes.
My wife used to make it.

1459
01:39:35,936 --> 01:39:38,138
And tripe, too.

1460
01:39:38,205 --> 01:39:42,776
She could make
those two things,
out of this world.

1461
01:39:42,843 --> 01:39:47,114
You celebrate Christmas
with your  goomar,
or you stick around home?

1462
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:50,050
What makes you ask?

1463
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:53,387
I just remember,
with my girlfriend,
it was always a big argument.

1464
01:39:56,957 --> 01:39:58,158
She died.

1465
01:40:01,328 --> 01:40:02,830
So young.

1466
01:40:04,898 --> 01:40:06,533
What happened?

1467
01:40:07,401 --> 01:40:08,702
Pneumonia.

1468
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:10,971
Pneumonia?

1469
01:40:11,038 --> 01:40:15,242
She had weak lungs,
from growing up
on the other side.

1470
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:18,379
Fucked up doctors...

1471
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:23,150
So much tragedy
in your life.

1472
01:40:24,351 --> 01:40:27,021
Your father, your mistress...

1473
01:40:28,422 --> 01:40:30,257
I don't even have
a picture of her.

1474
01:40:36,063 --> 01:40:37,931
You know, I... I try so hard.

1475
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:42,669
What kind of God, huh?

1476
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:49,376
I go to church
when Joanne wants.

1477
01:40:49,443 --> 01:40:51,678
I try to set an example
for my nephew,

1478
01:40:51,745 --> 01:40:52,713
I come see you...

1479
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:54,515
I do all kinds of good things.

1480
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:58,919
You know the Christmas song,
"My Favorite Things"?

1481
01:40:59,787 --> 01:41:00,721
Yeah.

1482
01:41:02,022 --> 01:41:05,292
Maybe some of the things
you choose to do...

1483
01:41:06,193 --> 01:41:07,761
aren't God's favorite.

1484
01:41:10,531 --> 01:41:12,599
What are you trying to say?

1485
01:41:14,068 --> 01:41:17,538
What do I know?
I'm a murderer.

1486
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:25,479
As far as your nephew goes...

1487
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:29,883
may I make a brief suggestion
for a nice Christmas present
you could give him?

1488
01:41:33,754 --> 01:41:35,055
I'm listening.

1489
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:38,792
Stay out of his life.

1490
01:41:50,504 --> 01:41:51,672
It's damaged.

1491
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:53,440
And you're out of line
with your prices.

1492
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:24,805
Who is this?

1493
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:27,674
Hey, Uncle Dick, it's Tony.
How's it going?

1494
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:31,044
There's a party tonight,
and I was wondering

1495
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:33,447
if we could get
a couple cases
of Rolling Rock?

1496
01:42:34,715 --> 01:42:35,883
Uncle Dick?

1497
01:42:38,886 --> 01:42:39,987
Uncle Dick?

1498
01:42:41,054 --> 01:42:41,889
Hello?

1499
01:42:44,825 --> 01:42:46,727
There's something wrong
with his phone.

1500
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:48,996
Your ass. Same as last time.

1501
01:42:50,564 --> 01:42:52,399
It doesn't have to be
Rolling Rock.

1502
01:42:52,499 --> 01:42:53,834
Does he know that?

1503
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:56,303
It's not about
the fucking name brand.

1504
01:42:57,204 --> 01:42:58,639
Carmela, you got a dime?

1505
01:43:14,087 --> 01:43:14,988
Hello?

1506
01:43:15,055 --> 01:43:17,391
Hey, Aunt Jo. It's Tony.

1507
01:43:17,491 --> 01:43:18,892
Can I speak to Uncle Dick?

1508
01:43:20,527 --> 01:43:22,196
I haven't seen him today.

1509
01:43:22,262 --> 01:43:23,330
Yeah?

1510
01:43:25,666 --> 01:43:27,201
Well, how's Christopher?

1511
01:43:29,269 --> 01:43:31,205
You know, the colic?

1512
01:43:31,271 --> 01:43:33,707
For my money,
you kids shouldn't be
drinking at your age.

1513
01:43:33,774 --> 01:43:35,909
Give me
the goddamn phone.

1514
01:43:44,117 --> 01:43:47,354
Fuck. Hey, Joe Jerk-off.

1515
01:43:51,592 --> 01:43:53,026
What'd you say?

1516
01:43:53,093 --> 01:43:54,728
I said, hey, Joe Jerk...

1517
01:43:54,795 --> 01:43:55,762
Your sister's twat!

1518
01:43:55,862 --> 01:43:56,797
What?

1519
01:43:58,398 --> 01:43:59,266
Stop it!

1520
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:01,935
Stop it!

1521
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:17,818
What do you got for us?

1522
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:20,153
It's what I told you,
furniture. Ethan Allen.

1523
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:23,056
Dinette sets
and, uh, TV trays.

1524
01:44:23,991 --> 01:44:25,459
TV trays?

1525
01:44:25,559 --> 01:44:26,893
I didn't argue.

1526
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,830
-Mmm.
-Fucking truck's
not gonna unload itself.

1527
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:34,568
I'll let him know.

1528
01:44:45,612 --> 01:44:47,748
Hey, Sil, I need to talk
to my Uncle Dickie.

1529
01:44:48,915 --> 01:44:51,118
He's not here.

1530
01:44:51,184 --> 01:44:52,286
His car's here.

1531
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:54,354
Battery's dead.

1532
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:58,792
You know where he is?

1533
01:44:58,859 --> 01:45:00,694
Who am I, Rand McNally?

1534
01:45:06,033 --> 01:45:07,801
Okay, well...

1535
01:45:07,868 --> 01:45:09,303
Merry Christmas, Sil.

1536
01:45:11,938 --> 01:45:13,140
You too, kid.

1537
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:29,856
Carmine spotted Harold,
Rockhaven Motel,
down on 46th.

1538
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,494
Well,
we'll do it tomorrow.

1539
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:38,165
I'll pick you up at 10:00
at the Pork Store.

1540
01:45:42,402 --> 01:45:45,305
It's the kid again.
I told him you're not here.

1541
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:49,543
Turn the lights out.

1542
01:45:51,178 --> 01:45:53,146
But the guys,
they're still unloading.

1543
01:46:39,459 --> 01:46:40,727
You know...

1544
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,476
The fuck are you doing?

1545
01:47:29,576 --> 01:47:31,178
I don't want these!

1546
01:47:37,317 --> 01:47:40,153
Oh! That was a gift!

1547
01:47:40,253 --> 01:47:41,254
You take 'em!

1548
01:47:41,321 --> 01:47:43,123
I don't want
any part of this!

1549
01:47:43,190 --> 01:47:45,158
None of it! I don't
want any part of this!

1550
01:47:45,258 --> 01:47:47,994
Huh?
What "this"?

1551
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:51,865
What "this"?

1552
01:47:58,605 --> 01:48:00,040
Night, Dick.

1553
01:48:09,015 --> 01:48:10,383
Dick...

1554
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:13,520
The kid. I don't know
what happened with you two.

1555
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:16,223
But he worships you.

1556
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:17,958
He's got so much potential.

1557
01:48:18,024 --> 01:48:21,294
Anthony, with that
loony tune of a mother.

1558
01:48:21,361 --> 01:48:24,231
Johnny, who's in line
for a personality transplant--

1559
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:26,032
-What, I'm some kind
of example?
-What can I tell you?

1560
01:48:26,132 --> 01:48:27,400
You're his best shot.

1561
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:29,669
Ah, I should never
have let this happen.

1562
01:48:31,137 --> 01:48:32,239
Get in close.

1563
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:34,307
Dick, he misses you.

1564
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:38,011
What?

1565
01:48:40,881 --> 01:48:41,748
Nothing.

1566
01:48:45,886 --> 01:48:46,887
Actually...

1567
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:49,489
that's it.

1568
01:48:56,029 --> 01:48:57,063
Nothing.

1569
01:48:59,499 --> 01:49:01,034
I'm not sure I follow.

1570
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:03,837
Yeah, well.

1571
01:49:04,437 --> 01:49:05,372
Okay.

1572
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,709
I know I shouldn't
say this, but...

1573
01:49:09,776 --> 01:49:12,112
Anthony, he could
end up somewhere.

1574
01:49:12,212 --> 01:49:13,747
Be on this thing of ours, even.

1575
01:49:25,725 --> 01:49:27,694
Tell him Holsten's, tomorrow.

1576
01:49:27,761 --> 01:49:30,263
-There you go.
-Let me finish,
for Christ's sake!

1577
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:35,368
9:00 a.m. No later.

1578
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:37,470
This is good.

1579
01:49:37,571 --> 01:49:38,605
Okay.

1580
01:49:38,705 --> 01:49:40,373
-It's all right, but it--
-Okay!

1581
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:41,775
It's over, go home.

1582
01:49:43,743 --> 01:49:45,078
The fuck am I doing?

1583
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:47,414
This one's yours.

1584
01:50:52,178 --> 01:50:53,313
Help!

1585
01:50:54,447 --> 01:50:55,515
My God!

1586
01:50:56,349 --> 01:50:58,718
Mrs. Moltisanti!

1587
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:20,006
Yeah?

1588
01:51:20,073 --> 01:51:21,241
It's done.

1589
01:52:10,757 --> 01:52:16,296
to Christmas?

1590
01:52:16,396 --> 01:52:21,534
way of living?

1591
01:52:23,603 --> 01:52:28,441
to the giving

1592
01:52:35,482 --> 01:52:36,783
Jun'.

1593
01:52:36,883 --> 01:52:39,986
to Christmas?

1594
01:52:41,488 --> 01:52:48,161
and left no traces...

1595
01:52:48,261 --> 01:52:54,267
You know, they found
a couple bottles of that Elavil
in his coat pocket.

1596
01:52:54,334 --> 01:52:55,635
Oh.

1597
01:52:57,771 --> 01:53:00,907
I used to think
Dickie was so strong.

1598
01:53:00,974 --> 01:53:03,743
It shows you never
know about people.

1599
01:53:12,285 --> 01:53:14,954
God, he was
my favorite uncle.

1600
01:53:17,323 --> 01:53:20,360
Remember when he used
to take us to the movies?

1601
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:22,629
Ones Mom
wouldn't let us go to.

1602
01:53:54,994 --> 01:53:58,198
That's the guy,
my uncle Tony.

1603
01:53:58,298 --> 01:54:00,567
The guy I went to hell for.

1604
01:54:05,505 --> 01:54:10,210
you'd be the chosen one

1605
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:14,080
"you're one in a million,
you got to burn to shine"

1606
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:17,250
Kevin, quit bouncing
that ball.

1607
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:19,085
Go do something useful, man.

1608
01:54:25,225 --> 01:54:27,060
Morning.

1609
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:31,764
about right and wrong

1610
01:54:31,865 --> 01:54:34,901
but you're looking good, baby

1611
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:36,903
you're a-feelin' fine

1612
01:54:38,605 --> 01:54:42,175
with a blue moon in your eyes

1613
01:54:45,612 --> 01:54:49,749
-
in your eyes

1614
01:54:53,219 --> 01:54:56,422
you woke up this mornin'

1615
01:54:56,522 --> 01:54:58,524
upside down

1616
01:54:58,591 --> 01:55:00,960
things ain't been the same

1617
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:03,963
walked into town

1618
01:55:04,063 --> 01:55:06,466
but you're one in a million

1619
01:55:06,566 --> 01:55:09,269
shotgun shine

1620
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:14,540
with a blue moon in your eyes

1621
01:55:28,488 --> 01:55:32,725
you wanna be the chosen one

1622
01:55:34,761 --> 01:55:37,230
help yourself, yeah

1623
01:56:01,788 --> 01:56:05,625
Santa Susannah

1624
01:56:05,692 --> 01:56:09,529
Santa Copelia

1625
01:56:09,629 --> 01:56:13,433
Mary Angelica

1626
01:56:13,499 --> 01:56:17,203
Frater Pietro

1627
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:27,814
Vladimir and all the rest

1628
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:39,058
is placed upon the steps
and a baby cries

1629
01:56:39,158 --> 01:56:44,030
the church bells
start to ring

1630
01:56:48,167 --> 01:56:54,140
the body settles in

1631
01:56:54,207 --> 01:56:58,311
a mother sing

1632
01:57:00,813 --> 01:57:08,154
then the other
as you step out on the road

1633
01:57:13,393 --> 01:57:17,096
How much?

1634
01:57:17,196 --> 01:57:23,736
and how far
and how many times

1635
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:39,352
Calling all angels

1636
01:57:39,419 --> 01:57:46,426
Don't leave me alone

1637
01:58:07,113 --> 01:58:11,818
you gaze upon the sunset

1638
01:58:11,918 --> 01:58:16,055
and intensity

1639
01:58:23,396 --> 01:58:26,065
crack the code

1640
01:58:26,132 --> 01:58:29,669
finally understand

1641
01:58:37,276 --> 01:58:41,347
trade in all

1642
01:58:41,447 --> 01:58:47,520
and suffering?

1643
01:59:21,487 --> 01:59:25,525
Calling all angels

1644
01:59:25,625 --> 01:59:29,562
Calling all angels
