3
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,816
Whenever the order
for table down the federal.

4
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:16,283
That's the special lunkhead
to go, ooh, la la.

5
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,663
We used to make it in culinary school,
but I did my own little twist.

6
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,008
All right, look alive, everyone.

7
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,594
We have a full house tonight.

8
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,348
Ari, you're overcooking it.

9
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,310
Start over. This is the Bowery,

10
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,561
not a burger joint.

11
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,192
I like burgers, is that the special?

12
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,362
It looks like beef stroganoff.

13
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,114
It's Blanka Duvel.

14
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,199
Try some. No thanks.

15
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,202
I'll leave the fancy cuisine to you.

16
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,459
Brett? Just nervous, Alice.

17
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,505
You know, we're expecting Janice Silver
any day now. Relax, babe.

18
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,549
The customers are going to love it.

19
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,135
We sold out of my bouillabaisse
last time, remember?

20
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,720
Bold words from a sushi chef.

21
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,390
Well, I'm not going to
be a sous chef forever. Hmm.

22
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,195
Welcome to the Bowery.

23
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,280
Do you have a reservation?

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,950
No, I don't. Well,
we can put you on the waiting list.

25
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,910
We're running about an hour.

26
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,747
Your name, Janet Silver.

27
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,418
Actually, I have something
ready for you right now.

28
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,793
Isn't that nice?

29
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:52,297
Right this way, Miss Silver.

30
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,196
There. She's here.

31
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,364
Janet Silver is here. Super.

32
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,492
OK. This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

33
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,412
Janet Silver is here.

34
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,748
We've made a top 10 list
for the last 10 years.

35
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,042
And this year will be no different.

36
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,127
Am I being clear? Yes, chef.

37
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,130
All right. What did you order?

38
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,133
Potato bisque, swordfish, filet mignon

39
00:03:38,091 --> 00:03:42,889
and the special. The special.

40
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,228
All right, everyone.

41
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,478
Let's get to it.

42
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,942
Potato leek soup.

43
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,862
He grilled swordfish.

44
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,285
He filet mignon and a special.

45
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,208
Oh, I was surprised to see
that you have at DVO on the menu.

46
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,835
Usually you're so predictable.

47
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:55,169
Enjoy. So far, so good.

48
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,276
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

49
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,404
So are you all right?

50
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,782
Oh, boy, it is this one moment.

51
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,370
What's in the blockhead to vote, Bill?

52
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,790
Onions, garlic, carrot, egg,
clarified butter, shanté,

53
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:37,712
parsley, thyme, parsley, parsley,
cardamom. Whip, now

54
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,465
janissaries electric.

55
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,009
Parsley, every seven new knows that.

56
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:56,522
Not every chef. I'm sorry,

57
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,443
but how was I supposed to know
about the parsley?

58
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,653
Least she'll be all right. Right.

59
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,657
Stick to the menu from now on out.

60
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,619
It's going to pass us big time
and it still might.

61
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,956
We're definitely
not going to make our top two this time.

62
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:18,252
I'm sorry. There is nothing
actually wrong with the dish.

63
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,130
I'm sticking around here for a while,
so maybe you should take off.

64
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,841
I want you to miss your train.

65
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:47,240
Good night. Hey, hey, Christine.

66
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,534
We're so excited for your new concept.

67
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,454
You tell me what drew you to the space.

68
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:57,332
I love the open kitchen layout gives
the customer a true culinary experience.

69
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,919
No, I don't have an opening date yet.

70
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:03,423
I'm still looking for a chef,
but I got to runner.

71
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,133
So she, like Danielle, is waiting for you.

72
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,509
Good morning, Marta.

73
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:21,274
Christian, good morning,
Daniela. Good morning.

74
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,402
You want something to eat?

75
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,946
No thanks. Oh, 70

76
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,242
at 10:00 a.m., you have a conference call
about the design

77
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,161
of the new hotel in Charleston.

78
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,914
Then lunch with the governor at 12 30,
followed by a 4:00 p.m.

79
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:40,251
tour of the new wing of the Children's
Hospital and a 7:00 p.m.

80
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,212
dinner with the Association
of Female Business Owners.

81
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,589
Can we push dinner back?

82
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,842
I've been emailing with the director of
the hospital, and I want to stick around

83
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:52,096
after the tour to discuss
additional fundraising strategies, OK? OK.

84
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,393
Unless my charming
nephew would attend for me.

85
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,815
Heaven knows he could use an evening out
with some strong, intelligent women.

86
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,944
What you could at least act interested.

87
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,573
You know, it's one of the many skills
you'll find handy when you're in my shoes.

88
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,784
I'm interested. I promise.

89
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,205
Maybe you'll find the next topic
a little more captivating.

90
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,207
The annual fundraiser for the St.

91
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,709
Andrews Children's Hospital is coming up.

92
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,295
We attend a fundraiser
every other weekend, Moynat.

93
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,215
Yes, but we're hosting this one.

94
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,384
And it's a cooking competition.

95
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,429
The theme is Farm to Fork.

96
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,475
I like it. It's cute.

97
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,893
It was Marty's idea.

98
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,188
We still haven't
settled on the judges yet.

99
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,483
Maybe our resident Garamond
could make a suggestion.

100
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,779
We could get Duncan
Rames, that British Ebola. Absolutely not.

101
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,532
This is a charity event. It's
not one of his reality shows.

102
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,785
All the best chefs
have the most difficult personalities.

103
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,496
Why have we under season
a dish at the Academy?

104
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,833
Chef Baumgarten would feed it to his
master and make us watch this one time.

105
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,128
Alice Toxify? Yes. Alice Meyers.

106
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:11,425
Hmm. Well, in any case, Martta,
I will be selecting our judges.

107
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,178
OK, your conference call is in 20 minutes.

108
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,181
OK, I'm going to confirm every word
for you. Thank you, Marta.

109
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,812
Christian, what's wrong?

110
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,482
You've been distracted lately.

111
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,901
Sorry, I didn't mean to be here.

112
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,613
I know the prospect of taken over
the family business can be quite

113
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,783
overwhelming. I felt the same way
when I took over from my husband.

114
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,954
But now, short, 20 years later.

115
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,084
I can't think of any path more fulfilling.

116
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:55,344
Thanks, Daniel. How would you like to be
one of our judges?

117
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,930
I'm not qualified. Of course you are.

118
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,975
You may not work in the kitchen,
but you are a chef.

119
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,228
You've got the diploma to prove it.

120
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,442
That's very kind, but you want judges
with big personalities for the fundraiser.

121
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,902
That's why people watch those shows.

122
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,988
Is that why they watch them?

123
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,698
I never knew why.

124
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,200
Well, offer still stands.

125
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,036
Think about it, will you?

126
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:43,643
I will. What's got into you, Chef?

127
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,730
I just came from a meeting.

128
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,900
Guess who's catering
this year's Gotham gala?

129
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,322
The Gotham Gala is in the biggest party
in New York City.

130
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,533
That's the one red carpet celebrities.

131
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,119
And now the Bowery.

132
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,414
This came for you, Alice.

133
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,626
That isn't the Jay Leno week.

134
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,128
Their first choice canceled.
We're the runner ups.

135
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,799
But after the Jenna Silver incident,
we need this one.

136
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,219
Alice, are you listening?

137
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,055
I've just been invited to judge
a cooking competition.

138
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,349
What do you miss, Myers?

139
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:27,061
You are cordially invited
to serve on the judges panel for the St.

140
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,355
Andrews Children's
Hospital Charity Cookoff.

141
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,148
This event will bring together

142
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,902
esteemed chefs from around the world
for a weekend in Kansas City.

143
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,987
I look forward to you being my guest.

144
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,031
Please respond before October 1st.

145
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:44,954
Daniela Billups, the hotel
magnate and philanthropist, apparently.

146
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:50,376
Wow, it's in Kansas City and a week
and they are paying for everything.

147
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,670
I recognize your talent.

148
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,132
That's why I want you working
with me at the gala.

149
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,344
This will be great recognition
for both of us, for you.

150
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,471
Look, I don't want to argue with you.

151
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,474
You can stay here with me
and cook for the stars,

152
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,936
or you can watch
some old washed up chefs cook.

153
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,021
It's your choice.

154
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,075
Blackcurrant plum.

155
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,996
Give me a little, OK? Nice Tannin's.

156
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,874
What do you guys think?

157
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,585
Tastes like red wine? Very astute.

158
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,588
We're not here to talk about the wine.

159
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,425
We want to talk about you
and the cooking competition.

160
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,303
You have to go. I don't know.

161
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,097
Bret really wants me
to work with him at this gala.

162
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,808
It's a big deal for him.

163
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:51,020
But Brett's too busy thinking about bread
to think about what's best for you.

164
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,689
How long did it take him
to let you try out that special?

165
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:58,027
Then he turns around and pulls it off
the menu after one tiny accident.

166
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,281
Well, in his defense,
I did send a food critic to the hospital.

167
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,327
She's fine. That's not the point.

168
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,828
He's the head chef.

169
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,247
He should have seen the parsley
before the dish even went out.

170
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,709
He dropped the ball, not you.

171
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,921
Maybe it's OK to have your own dreams.

172
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,007
I don't get it. A

173
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,427
lot of people would kill for my job
and my boyfriend.

174
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,096
Why am I not happier?

175
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,682
It's a great restaurant, but

176
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,143
maybe it's not great for you.

177
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,774
Well, then. Here's

178
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,693
to Dreams, to dreams.

179
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:50,079
I think the prime. I'm feeding my.

180
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,168
So close that I can touch.

181
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,088
I'm thinking. I'm Alice Myers,

182
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,465
welcome to Kansas City.

183
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,596
If you. Everything of.

184
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,561
This is our power and light district.

185
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:30,703
Just a short walk
from your hotel. Hotel Phillips.

186
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,623
You sure this is where I'm staying?

187
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,441
Yes. I think that'll be fine.

188
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,028
Checking it. Yes. Welcome.

189
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,154
We're glad to have you stand with us.

190
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,364
Could I have your name, Alice Myers?

191
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,411
It might be. And I see
you're one of the judges for the cookoff.

192
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,706
Miss Phillips has made some
very special arrangements for your stay.

193
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,878
This might be a silly question,
but does Miss Phillips own this hotel?

194
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:26,091
Yes, she does. This hotel was the first
built by the Phillips Group in the 1930s,

195
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,887
and now they have luxury hotels
all over the world

196
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,932
San Francisco, Paris, Tokyo, Zurich.

197
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,101
Everything is taken care of.

198
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,145
You're on the fifth floor.
Elevators are to your left.

199
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,105
If things will be brought to your room.

200
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,609
And if there's anything I can do for you,
do in your state, please let me know.

201
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,944
And I will. Thank you.

202
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,487
This is amazing.

203
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,621
Do you mind? Not at all.

204
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,128
Thanks. If you want to see a great view,
you don't have to do.

205
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,422
I well, thank you.

206
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,425
Have a nice day with you, too.

207
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,890
Please join us for a meet and greet
this evening, 7:00 p.m..

208
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,289
Lisa Whiteley's. Yeah.

209
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:31,425
Some mean great losers,
nothing Switalski this weekend, huh?

210
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,765
Alice Christian.

211
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,439
You must be this Myres Alice.

212
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,734
Let me introduce you to Christian.

213
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,528
This is Daniel's nephew.
He'll be a judge this weekend.

214
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:56,325
We know each other
more than a small world. Really small.

215
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,746
I'll leave you two
to get reacquainted thingee.

216
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,833
Daniela's nephew,

217
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,002
Daniella Phillips. That's the one.

218
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,589
Why don't you tell me?

219
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,885
Yes, it never came up, never came up.

220
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,555
How long were we together back then?

221
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,142
And Danielle and I don't
particularly close friends,

222
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:26,230
but being part of the Phillips family,
it's not the sort of thing we talk about.

223
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,150
People look at you
differently, like, you know,

224
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:35,322
I'm sorry. I'm just surprised is all.

225
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,119
So that's why I'm here, because of you.

226
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,412
Believe me, I had nothing to do with this.

227
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,623
I mean, surprised as you.

228
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,709
So what are you doing now?

229
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,795
I'm Daniela's apprentice.

230
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,631
You're not a chef. Don't tell me.

231
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,887
After my parents
passed, Antonello took me under her wing.

232
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:03,142
She doesn't have any children
of her own, so Yaroun,

233
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,646
she runs the hotel business and spearheads

234
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,190
a million charity events. And I help

235
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:17,114
you live here, mostly based here,
but it involves a lot of traveling.

236
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,576
Sounds like a dream job.

237
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,413
What about you? You must be doing
very well for yourself.

238
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,457
One of the esteemed judges
of the competition.

239
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:31,128
I am a sous chef in New York.

240
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,173
A sous chef. Here we go.

241
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,093
Oh, I mean, that's great.

242
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,136
Go on. You can say.

243
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,597
I'm just surprised. That's all.

244
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,556
But I can't say anything.

245
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,600
I'm purely out of nepotism.

246
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,894
Well, I don't know about now.

247
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,021
But you were a great chef in school.

248
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,191
That's pretty nice.

249
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,818
There was a long time ago.

250
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,488
It won't be weird

251
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,658
us together as judges right

252
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,830
now with me. Me neither.

253
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,249
That is all ancient history.

254
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,505
I should mingle with the other guests.

255
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,632
That's certainly.

256
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,302
Yeah, definitely.

257
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,023
It seems like everyone
is enjoying the party.

258
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,067
Christian, you are.

259
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,945
Have you met Governor Dumont? Yes.
Nice to see you, Governor.

260
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,697
I believe we're still overdue
for a round of golf.

261
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,657
Your club or mine?

262
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,950
Let's set it up.

263
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,535
We will. Can I steal my hand for a moment?

264
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,372
I just need to have a quick word
in private. By all means.

265
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,795
What's so pressing,

266
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,172
you put a sous chef on the judges panel.

267
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,133
You must be referring to Alice
Myers. That's the one.

268
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,762
She's an up and coming
young chef, very talented.

269
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,725
She is a sushi. She's been working
at a top tier restaurant in New York

270
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:13,146
since she graduated from that
very prestigious Swiss culinary school.

271
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,108
You might have heard of it.

272
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,652
I can't believe you did this. Did what?

273
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:22,614
Wasn't she a friend of yours
who you still talk about?

274
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,785
And I didn't think you'd mind
seeing an old friend.

275
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,038
You don't have a problem
with that, do you?

276
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,750
I don't have a good because you too
will be working a lot together

277
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,963
then yellow fields,

278
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,382
businesswoman, philanthropist,

279
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:45,220
matchmaker, maybe. Oh, thank you.

280
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,598
Are you kidding me? I know, right?

281
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,642
It's just like reality TV.

282
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:54,146
Seriously. We're so proud of you, Ellen.

283
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,940
Well, I'm here because of you guys.

284
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,651
I'll bring you a souvenir. Oh,
how about one of those bathrobes?

285
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,280
So the other thing is,

286
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,368
I ran into an old friend
here. Oh, Christian.

287
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,246
Wait, wait. The guy from Switzerland.
What's he doing there?

288
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,664
How does he look?

289
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,208
Turns out he's Danniella Philip's nephew.

290
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,711
He is one of the judges, too.

291
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,547
Wait, wait a minute.
So he's like super wealthy.

292
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,466
You're dating a millionaire.

293
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,052
Well, he wasn't rich then.

294
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,928
He didn't act like it.

295
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:27,721
Just Googled him.

296
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,224
Yeah. Dude is loaded. OK,
so he's rich and good looking.

297
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,726
Now I'm really jealous.

298
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,728
I'm with Brett. Remember?

299
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,192
Oh, got to go. That's Brett,

300
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,612
speak of the devil, text us by five.

301
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,158
Hi, I wasn't sure I'd hear from you.

302
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,827
Yeah, it's kind of a madhouse here.

303
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,329
How are things with you?

304
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,748
I'm sorry. I can't be there to help.

305
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,875
I wish I could be two places at once.

306
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,669
Me, too. I'm sure they'll be fine.

307
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,380
You're just stressed.

308
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,465
You just see the menu I put together.

309
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,093
Nothing fancy, but I think the guests
are going to dig it.

310
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,263
That's great. We've had this organic
beef farm upstate.

311
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,475
You should see these cuts
being some of the best I've ever.

312
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,144
Hey, hey, watch that flame over there.

313
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,772
Where was I? Hey, I

314
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,734
have to go. Actually, I'm really tired.

315
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:27,322
Talk soon, though. Oh, OK. Later.

316
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,164
Good afternoon. I'm Daniela Phillips.

317
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,708
And I'd like to welcome you to the St.

318
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,378
Andrews Children's
Hospital Charity Cookoff.

319
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,425
Most importantly,

320
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:50,595
I want to thank all of you
for your very generous and kind donations.

321
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,973
Now to get things started.

322
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,392
Let's meet our judges.

323
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,771

326
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,365

328
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:24,337
She is also a graduate of the prestigious
McAdams EastWest Desert Culinary.

329
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:33,722
And last but not least of our judges
is my dear nephew Christian Graham,

330
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:38,560
a globe trotting gourmand
and also a graduate of the Academy.

331
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,650
And let me introduce to you our chefs,

So, chefs, you have come
from all around the world.

335
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,958
Thank you for your first challenge.

336
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,295
I'd like for you to prepare an appetizer.

337
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,924
From your hometown.

338
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:14,554
And 60 Minutes. Ready, chefs ready.

339
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:18,808
All right. On your mark, get set, cook.

340
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,334
One having flashbacks.

341
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,545
Contract infusion.

342
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:50,090
Good cooking isn't a race,
but you have to move fast.

343
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,193
Five more minutes.

344
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,661
Time's up, chefs,

345
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,665
now our judges will go to work
to decide the winner. Chef Lee.

346
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,129
I'm from Taiwan,
and these are Xinjiang lamp's Uighurs

347
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,716
season would kuman chili flakes,
Sichuan peppercorn

348
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,636
and fennel. Spice is nice.

349
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,348
The great combination of flavors.

350
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:44,185
I agree it's bold
but not overpowering. Nice work.

351
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,646
And it finishes very nice. Good job.

352
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,984
I live in Los Angeles,
but originally I'm from El Salvador.

353
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:55,572
So this is my version of pupusa,
a traditional appetizer.

354
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,408
It is the national dish of El Salvador.

355
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,621
And we celebrate it every year, annually
on the second Sunday of November.

356
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:12,005
Please enjoy. 1813

357
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:16,009
voted for my native France, but Nepeta.

358
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,611
Judges have you reach a decision,
the authentic flavors really stood out.

359
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,114
The winner of today's competition.

360
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:48,208
The Shepley. Hey, congratulations, chef.

361
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:52,796
So winning this round, Chef Lee has earned
you 100 points. Well done.

362
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,507
The next round is worth 200 points.

363
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,385
And the final round
will be worth 300 chefs.

364
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,054
It's anybody's game. Our next challenge.

365
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:05,642
You have 24 hours
to create an entree of your choosing.

366
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,019
But there's one catch farm to fork.

367
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:12,357
You can only use ingredients from our
local farm. Are you ready?

368
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,944
The challenge begins.

369
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,197
Great meeting you.

370
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,742
If they put that together in an hour.

371
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,869
I can't wait to see
what they come up with tomorrow.

372
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,497
You just love to eat.

373
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,040
It doesn't matter what it is.

374
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,586
Okay, Mr. Pretentious,
how did we ever agree on the lamb skewers?

375
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,132
You know, so little
surprised myself. Are you ready?

376
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,428
What you're going

377
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:45,432
with the chefs to the farm in case
they have questions about the rules.

378
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,100
Is that really necessary?

379
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,227
Oh, come on, it'll be fun. Splendid.

380
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,940
You can ride on the bus with the chefs
if you want the bus

381
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,902
else you want to ride with
me. Hmm. Depends.

382
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,612
What are you driving these days?

383
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:03,908
I guess something fast, shiny and foreign.

384
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,078
I miss the fresh air.

385
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,706
It's not exactly New York.

386
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,053
He chefs, let's get a photo.

387
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:34,647
I love markets, everything's
just so fresh. Oh, my gosh.

388
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,983
I just smelled something so wonderful.

389
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,778
I'm going to go follow my nose
and I'll catch up with you both later.

390
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,740
Oh, I guess we don't have to stay

391
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:49,537
with the chef. Adobe fine.

392
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,332
Where are you going?

393
00:29:52,707 --> 00:30:23,154
You'll see. Hi, Christine. Hey.

394
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,240
Well, looks good.

395
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,369
What just came out of the oven Christmas?

396
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,956
They smell amazing.

397
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,291
I want those who live for please.

398
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,296
Wait till you taste them.

399
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:43,299
They made with European butter
and a Wild East starter.

400
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,011
This kind of reminds me of our trip

401
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,139
to move on, the water was like glass.

402
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,685
It was beautiful. Yeah, but what was that

403
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,897
name of the little shop
we went to back then? Canini Dorce.

404
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:02,443
That's right. Here we go.

405
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:07,073
Thank you. Enjoy that.

406
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:14,497
Not yet, but some place on
shore, are you OK?

407
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,144
So you own a farm, too?

408
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,980
Well, mine. It's a family farm,

409
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,733
almost reminds me of Switzerland,

410
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:46,237
though I do believe
the Alps are just a tiny bit bigger.

411
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,825
Well, I mean, this

412
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,994
and spending time with you

413
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,413
and all it took was a free trip.

414
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,665
Well, can't all be jet setters.

415
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:02,462
You know, as you recall, I'm
from Long Island and not the ritzy part.

416
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,882
I worked my tail off since graduation.

417
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:11,137
Since since you got the job
as a prep cook, the Bernadine, I remember

418
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:15,099
you were jumping and screaming
all over the place when you found out.

419
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,394
And we all wanted
to lock you in the freezer.

420
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,855
Right. Sorry about that.

421
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,733
We were jealous. You deserved it.
And you made your own way.

422
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:28,404
I respect that. Really? You mean that?

423
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,118
I left a lot of things unsaid

424
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,288
when we were together.

425
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:42,293
And I'm sorry. And the way things ended.

426
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:49,550
I really do handle it that well.

427
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,344
It was a long time ago.

428
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,388
You don't have to say anything. I want to.

429
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,934
I was supposed to join you
in New York, but I didn't.

430
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,479
You were going through a lot
with your parents death.

431
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,774
I just wanted to be there for you.

432
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,944
I know you did. It was a dark time
and I shut you out.

433
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,949
You deserve better than that.

434
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,827
I understood. Really? It's OK.

435
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,580
Oh, I'm in a real mess of things.

436
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,877
But everything worked out for the best.

437
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,296
You're taking over for your aunt.

438
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,466
I'm number two at one of the
best restaurants in New York.

439
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,971
I couldn't be happier. It's.

440
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:41,019
I don't know what I was thinking,
letting you go. Whoa!

441
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,440
I guess we've worn out our welcome

442
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,067
back to the car.

443
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,496
Daniela, relax Sheff's

444
00:34:42,996 --> 00:34:47,085
I'm not here in any official capacity
and just merely feeling a little peckish.

445
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,504
It would be an honor
to serve you something.

446
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,005
Oh, that's quite all right. Thank you.

447
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,176
Just pretend I'm not here.

448
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:58,805
Squint to read the refrigerator.

449
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,434
Oh. That's perfect.

450
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,105
Do you mind if I use this?

451
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,241
Do you mind terribly as Chef
Rafael Natatorium?

452
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:25,414
No, I quite enjoyed your dish today.

453
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:30,920
I have spent plenty of time in France,
and I must say your tartine

454
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,756
was delicious. Merci.

455
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:39,470
In my humble opinion, uniform chic.

456
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,557
I might stumbly disagree,

457
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:46,144
but I must admit I was quite
surprised by the level of competition

458
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,105
you brought together,
but not unpleasantly.

459
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,107
What do you mean?

460
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,652
I love surprises,
combining new ingredients,

461
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:58,239
improvising a mere Adobe
cooking my whole life.

462
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,783
But I am yet a student.

463
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,536
There's always something new to learn.

464
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,289
You're very insightful.

465
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,750
A side effect of spending most of my life
at my cutting board.

466
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,838
Plenty of time to think.

467
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,632
Speaking of which, may I?

468
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,968
Oh, by all means. Please do.

469
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,428
I'm frightful in the kitchen.

470
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,680
I disagree with Tissier.

471
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,603
I think there's a smooth.

472
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,154
After a few calls,

473
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,364
well, a few dozen.

474
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:41,949
I was able to book

475
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,660
you back to back meetings
while you're in San Francisco next week.

476
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,537
You're an angel, Marda.

477
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,665
That's your revised itinerary.

478
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,501
As much as I love a full schedule.

479
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:56,130
I am so looking forward to retirement.

480
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,051
No second thoughts.

481
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,929
I think Christian is about
as ready as I'll ever be

482
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,681
to take over the Phillipsburg, but

483
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,892
I do love my job,

484
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,062
but I am so ready to do
all the things that I just.

485
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,236
Yeah, I'm going to
sound like a foolish old woman,

486
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:23,532
but I'd really like to find love again
before it's too late.

487
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,788
You are not old,

488
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,667
you're not foolish. Not at all.

489
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,093
One more minute, chef.

490
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,602
Ten seconds left.

491
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:44,530
Shefali, this is Shway
show you or Szechwan boiled fish?

492
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,993
I've made it with a fresh catfish
from a local lake catfish.

493
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,703
Interesting choice.

494
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,015
Chef Martinez, this is my

495
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,477
take on off the Google,
a specialty of Lombards cuisine.

496
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:19,148
The volcano cut lamb shank
braised in a red wine vegetable sauce

497
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:27,823
on top of a Parmesan risotto. OK.

498
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:32,244
Not about osso buco. I agree.

499
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,163
The sauce is a bit thin.

500
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,665
It's supposed to be a hearty dish.

501
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,794
I'm sorry, but any Italian grandmother
can make it better.

502
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,672
Who's pretentious now?

503
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,302
And Chef Raphael.

504
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,848
This is Gasolina for volson.

505
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:57,478
Unfortunately, the rules did not permit me
to use to lose sausage,

506
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,606
but I discovered that many local options.

507
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:10,741
Daniela? So you. C. Bon appetit.

508
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,587
I vote Chifley as opposed
to respond so delicious.

509
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:28,551
Chef Rafael's dish was much more complex
and at least a solution.

510
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,929
You and I have to agree
with Alex Castellanos, one of the most

511
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,598
challenging dishes in all of French
cuisine. Superb.

512
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,726
It's four fights to.

513
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:41,397
Cheverly is hiding behind the spices
that was overcooked.

514
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,732
I'm standing up.

515
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,984
I have to agree.

516
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,655
OK. Well, looks like we have a winner.

517
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:59,623
The winner of today's
competition, Chef Raphael.

518
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,131
Congratulations to Chef Rafaelle,

519
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,050
who has captured the lead with 200 points,

520
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,928
but I have one more challenge to go.

521
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,931
Well, chefs, the final challenge
will be to complete

522
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,766
the meal that you've done so far.

523
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:20,644
My personal favorite dessert.

524
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,938
Now you can cook or bake
anything that you like.

525
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,650
The only requirement is that the recipe
must come from the heart.

526
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,528
All right. You've got 24 hours. Let's go.

527
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:30,988
Good luck, chefs.

528
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,410
Great job, thank you.

529
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,746
You're quite the food critic.

530
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,165
Oh, you're just mad, you're outnumbered.

531
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:45,294
I'm still not sure I agree with you,
but you did argue your point.

532
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:49,840
Well, you know, all this eating
is actually making me pretty hungry.

533
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:54,345
I know a place where we can go,
if you don't mind working for your food.

534
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,722
Sounds good to me.

535
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,702
This space is amazing.

536
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,955
Reminds me of what we used to talk about,
it looked to me.

537
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,874
I thought you'd like it.

538
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,294
Location's great, too.

539
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:30,005
You said a friend's opening this place.

540
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,216
Yeah. What kind of food?

541
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,469
He hasn't decided, really.

542
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,305
Once the opening?

543
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,058
I'm not sure yet.

544
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:46,313
Less questions. More cooking. OK, OK.

545
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,110
You're the pseudo.

546
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:56,198
Why believe when you mix little love

547
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:01,412
into Olive? You have.

548
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,250
Why? Because when you add it all.

549
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,631
Well, it all goes back.

550
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:16,760
Jackie Mason from Hilton.

551
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:23,642
What happens when
you take a leap of faith?

552
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:29,273
Guess we're bound to find out.

553
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,487
Something beautiful. Let's get down.

554
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,657
I forgot our funguses.

555
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,953
I know it's ready to happen.

556
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:46,915
There will be. Not.

557
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,504
Twenty. Oh, it's perfect.

558
00:43:55,132 --> 00:44:07,019
Just just. Chef Rafael Re,

559
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,189
I thought you'd be in the kitchen working.

560
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,651
It may not seem like it,
but I'm actually hard at work right now.

561
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:18,447
Well, if that's hard work, then
I'd like to enroll in culinary school.

562
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,825
Will you join me? Sure.

563
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,081
I'm searching for
the perfect cheese for my dish.

564
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:32,127
Of course, in France,
we invented the cheese for the occasion.

565
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,921
I have been outside of my country.

566
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,298
I have not tried too many other kinds.

567
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:41,595
It seems pointless, but there are times
when I have been surprised.

568
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:46,725
These trees, for example, it's
not like anything we had at home.

569
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:53,691
Is. I say. Sebel.

570
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,652
Yeah, it's good, it's good.

571
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,119
Where we both have a passion
for what we do. We do.

572
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,206
Have you ever heard the same?

573
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:12,376
If you love what you do,
it will never work a day in life.

574
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:18,298
I just hope Christian finds that.

575
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,050
What do you mean?

576
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,181
Can you keep a secret?

577
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,439
I'm retired, but you are so young.

578
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:37,901
Well, I appreciate
your flattery, but I'm tired.

579
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:44,158
I'm not tired of my job,
I'm just I'm tired of only having my job.

580
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:48,662
I, too, am fanatical and it hasn't
been easy on my personal life,

581
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:52,291
but giving up my work
would be like giving up myself.

582
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,961
Who am I without my job?

583
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,672
But aren't you curious to find out?

584
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,299
I know who I am.

585
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:17,441
Do you? What did we make again?

586
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,361
So this is my take on Tyrolean food.

587
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,281
I fell in love with it
when we were in Austria.

588
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,450
You mean Innsbrook? I remember that trip.

589
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,077
We just met, you know,
growing up in Long Island.

590
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,580
I'd never seen a mountain before.

591
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:37,294
And suddenly there I was in the Alps
on skis falling all over the place.

592
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:43,175
You were delirious
and you kept making fun of me.

593
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,471
But you stayed on the bunny
slopes with me all day just to make sure

594
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,555
I got the hang of it.

595
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,766
I wasn't going to leave you alone.

596
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,727
Those were good times.

597
00:46:54,645 --> 00:47:08,283
Yes, they were. Unbelievable.

598
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,037
This makes me feel like I'm right back in
that Özkan ski lodge.

599
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,415
Well, that's the idea.

600
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,503
I try to recreate
my experiences on the plates.

601
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,631
I use the flavors to convey my memories.

602
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,595
How do you not have
your own restaurant? I'm serious.

603
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:34,017
Running a restaurant has so little
to do with cooking.

604
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:39,273
It's all about having a mind for business
and a lot of luck.

605
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,068
I have a good job.

606
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,446
Be a huge risk going out on my own.

607
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,657
I know I feel there

608
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,869
you seem to have your future
pretty locked up.

609
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,161
I went to culinary school

610
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,998
the same as you, and I had a dream
of working in a kitchen to.

611
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,626
As fortunate as I am
to be in the situation.

612
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,672
It's not what I want.

613
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:10,012
I no idea, as I've got
a confession to make.

614
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,516
This is not my friend's
restaurant. It's mine.

615
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,563
I bought it about a year ago
from a retiring chef and.

616
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,524
I've just been fixing
it up, it's sort of a hobby

617
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,653
I've been wanting
to tell and Danniella, but

618
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,738
I don't want to let her down.

619
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,574
You know, she's she's been so good to me
and she has no one else

620
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:34,036
to take over the first group
when she retires.

621
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,413
Tell me about your restaurant.

622
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,042
Tell me tell me everything
you planned. Why?

623
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,669
It's not like I'm going
to open the place anyway.

624
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,505
It's a hypothetical question.

625
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:49,259
OK, I'll start my dream restaurant.

626
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,014
It's someplace where there are no food
critics or best of lists,

627
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,602
a place where I can cook
using only what's fresh and in season.

628
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,813
And there's only a few tables
in the dining room

629
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:06,193
so I can come out of the kitchen and talk
with the guests, maybe share some wine.

630
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:11,490
I live in a cozy apartment upstairs
because I never want to leave.

631
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:19,414
Now you go. OK. At my dream restaurant,

632
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:24,336
you're the chef because you cook
better than I do,

633
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:29,299
but I still want to cook
some and manage the place well ahead.

634
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,178
Sorry. Why am I the chef
at your restaurant?

635
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:38,558
You could have any chef in the world
in the history of Yoshihiro

636
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,937
Murata, Julia Child,
Edna Lewis, Thomas Keller.

637
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,900
And YouChoose Me. Yes.

638
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,365
Excuse my reach.

639
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:12,175
Delicious. Forgot how much I love cooking.

640
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,722
Don't you cook where you work?

641
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,099
I do. Not for fun.

642
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,977
We don't experiment with new.

643
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:26,106
Stick to standard fare. Price.

644
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,985
Hey, Bill, what about your restaurant?

645
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,654
Do you realize how perfect it is?

646
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,239
I wouldn't give it up.

647
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,993
I mean, even if you can't be the chef,
that you could hire

648
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:41,246
someone to run the daily and sneakin
whenever you feel like cooking.

649
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:53,592
That idea. Beyonce.

650
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,014
It's because of you that I'm here judging
the competition, it's

651
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:03,143
not some random coincidence
or my talent. Is it.

652
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,189
Some call it coincidence.

653
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:12,027
The point is, you're young enough
and coming chef who's very talented.

654
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:30,712
Thanks. You can't believe it's only.

655
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,396
I had a lovely day. To.

656
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,270
I thought I saw you come out here.

657
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,064
The bellman said
I should come check out The View.

658
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:36,653
It's beautiful. I come up here

659
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,656
when I need a little perspective.

660
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:43,577
From my apartment in New York
or someone else's window.

661
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,664
A smaller city does have its perks.

662
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,375
Like what? We're friending.

663
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,339
There's no fighting over
parking, low cost living. Less traffic.

664
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,217
Sounds like you're on the tourism board.

665
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:02,095
Well, we are in the
hotel business. But honestly,

666
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:07,684
I like it here. I can see why.

667
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:15,108
Do you ever see yourself living near or.

668
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,157
If there were. The reason?

669
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:28,413
A reason. Christian,

670
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,542
do would like a word with you. Excuse me.

671
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,308
Sit down, Christian.

672
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,602
Is there something wrong
we're supposed to be doing in the kitchen?

673
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,647
No, this will only take a minute. OK.

674
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,070
After the competition,

675
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,615
I am going to formally announce
my retirement from the Phillips Group.

676
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:07,452
Why now? Because you're ready

677
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:10,455
and because now more than ever, it's

678
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:14,209
become apparent to me that it.

679
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:19,422
I want more. Thanks so much.

680
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,676
This is a great honor and Daniela,

681
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,679
but we have a competition
to get to. Quite right.

682
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,141
That's not. Well,

683
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:33,395
let's go and Daniela.

684
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,899
Oh, Christian, don't look so nervous.

685
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:42,237
You are going to be
a great leader. I'm certain

686
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,240
your mom and dad would be so

687
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,244
proud of you. I know I am.

688
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:55,292
Was there anything else?

689
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:59,170
No, good, then, off we go.

690
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,006
Oh, one more thing.

691
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,340
I quite like your girlfriend.

692
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,676
Oh, she's not my girlfriend.

693
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:08,221
Hmm. Well, I like her.

694
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,478
She'll read as easily

695
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:18,815
daily fantasy and love.

696
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,575
Five more minutes.

697
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,836
One minute left.

698
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,555
I don't think about your husband.

699
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,766
I'm not sure your dream show is available.

700
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,728
I know a lot of people in New York
would love to work with you.

701
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,022
I'll introduce you.

702
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,441
I appreciate that.

703
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:09,032
All right, time's up, chefs.

704
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:15,789
Ready, judges? Shefali.

705
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,050
This is Steve who.

706
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,427
Or black sesame soup, a sweet soup

707
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:32,305
popular in southern China,
where my wife is from.

708
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,308
I parroted what Chinese
donuts were dipping.

709
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:47,737
Chef Martinez, this is
my take on three is cake.

710
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:51,533
It's a cake soaked in three kinds of milk,
evaporated, condensed and heavy cream.

711
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:56,037
You can find it all across Latin America,
and that is where

712
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,247
my heart will always be.

713
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,626
Well, I like the.

714
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,632
And Chef Rafaelle,

715
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:11,594
this is a souffle
I prepared from a surprising cheese

716
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,556
I found at the creamery
outside of Kansas City.

717
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,309
The day I tasted my first souffle,

718
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,479
that was the day I fell in love with

719
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:31,739
cooking. Perfect walks.

720
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:37,328
Are you. Saying that's a vast right wing.

721
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,499
OK, judges, have you reached a decision?

722
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:46,504
We have the winner of the dessert
challenge with one of the most

723
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:53,678
elegantly delicious executed
desserts. Chef Rafael.

724
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:06,274
This win erns chef Rafaelle,
an additional 300

725
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:12,197
points, making him
the winner of this charity cook off.

726
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,921
Thank you. This is truly an honor.

727
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:33,301
And of course, tomorrow night,
our judges will prepare dinner

728
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:36,346
and Chef Rafael's honor.

729
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:43,102
What was that? You got to read the letter
before you've been to being a judge.

730
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,397
Not the fine print, apparently

731
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,691
if you prepare just one of the dishes
you did last night.

732
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:51,736
Everyone will be eating
the best meal they have read.

733
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,782
MSG Myers, has Christian told

734
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:59,160
you the good news yet, but good news.

735
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:06,417
Go on. Tell her tomorrow night
I will be announcing my retirement.

736
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:10,296
But more importantly, I'll be announcing

737
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:13,216
that Christian is the new head
of the Phillips Group

738
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:19,013
who has such a bright future ahead of him
, don't you think, tomorrow?

739
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,058
Well, I must be off.

740
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:24,269
And you three have a dinner to prepare.

741
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:27,605
I catch up with you guys.

742
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,486
I was going to tell you myself. Congrats.

743
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,613
That's what you want.

744
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:41,494
Is it oh. Alice? Brett?

745
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:49,627
Whoo! Oh, well, what are you doing here?

746
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:52,005
I got on the first flight here
after the Gaylon.

747
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,465
I wanted to surprise you. You did?

748
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,427
How was it? Major success.

749
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,887
The Bowery is back on the map.

750
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,180
Have some really incredible news.

751
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:06,561
They may. Bret Porchetto,
Alice's boyfriend.

752
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,022
Christian Graham.

753
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,274
And I was just leaving.

754
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,567
I'll see two more.

755
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,988
Who's that? Old friend.

756
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:24,912
All right. There you are.

757
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,999
Just sign right here.

758
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:31,044
And it's official.

759
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:34,672
You'll be owner and CEO
of the Philips Group.

760
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:50,647
Now that you're in charge of everything,
I think you look a little more pleased.

761
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,858
I appreciate everything
you're doing for me, but. But

762
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:59,656
what is it, Alice?

763
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,285
You think it's a secret?

764
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:08,081
Don't be ridiculous, everyone knows.

765
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,625
So what if she has a boyfriend?

766
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:14,045
That's a pretty big
so what do you think? No, I don't.

767
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:17,382
Well, I've seen you two together
the past few days. And,

768
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,843
you know, if it's meant to be, then

769
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,681
no job or amount of money
to to change the fact

770
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:29,352
that she's living a life in New York,
a good life, a life without me.

771
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,938
Have you told her how you feel about her?

772
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,940
I'm pretty sure she knows.

773
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:37,694
Well, I'm no expert in love,
but in any business

774
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,863
deal, you always
state your intentions clearly

775
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:45,118
or you will never get what you want.

776
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:57,046
Oh, there you are, chef,
I've been looking all over for you.

777
01:01:57,046 --> 01:02:01,759
What is it? I was just hoping you
might join me for a celebratory beverage.

778
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:07,557
You're aware that we employ
a small army of dishwashers here, chef.

779
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,435
I requested the dishwasher leave me be.

780
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:13,730
I don't trust anyone
with my cooking utensils.

781
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:17,150
Chef's job doesn't end
when the meal is served.

782
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:20,027
In fact, a chef's job never ends.

783
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,489
So is that a no on the drink?

784
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:27,660
May I join you when I finish
my task, please?

785
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:31,998
Because I have something
to celebrate as well, which is that

786
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:36,502
tomorrow night I will be announcing
my retirement from the Phillips Group.

787
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:40,798
I will finally have all the time to do
everything I've put off.

788
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:44,218
I'll travel the world.
I suppose I've already done that, but

789
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,014
maybe I'll find a hobby.

790
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:51,350
I've never had one of those.

791
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,190
Should I take up cooking?

792
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,984
May I speak my mind, please?

793
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:04,113
I can't understand
why you are leaving a career

794
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,741
that has made you suffer fulfilled.

795
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,367
You're good at what you do.

796
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,411
You have a bathroom of shows.

797
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:16,125
It material from time to time,
but what honest work does?

798
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,882
I want some things for my life that.

799
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:27,678
This job has just made impossible.

800
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:35,353
Love, for instance.

801
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:39,065
I took over my husband's business
after his death, and

802
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,945
this job has has driven away

803
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:46,113
every proper man I've met since then.

804
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:52,662
Perhaps some fault was with the man
and not the job. Excuse me.

805
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,666
I don't have to be familiar
with the details to know

806
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,793
that these were the right man for you.

807
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,213
They became involved
with the hardworking woman and what

808
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,383
hanaway, because you couldn't change.

809
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:10,388
Only a fool would have to admire
and respect your dedication

810
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,849
for your business, your philanthropy.

811
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:18,062
If you retire now,
you stand a chance of beating Wohlforth

812
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:22,733
when you deserve a man
who appreciates the power.

813
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,202
Remind me, why are we here again?

814
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:36,205
I'm making a deconstructed
apple strudel for dessert.

815
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,917
Don't they have grocery stores?

816
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:44,046
I want everything
as fresh as possible. Huh?

817
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,091
Why are you so worked on?

818
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,885
We're on vacation.

819
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,303
You're on vacation.

820
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,889
I'm cooking and I want this
dinner to be perfect.

821
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:56,100
Well, I have some good news
that will put you in a better mood.

822
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,937
The Times did a glowing review on this
after the Gailen.

823
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,608
The owners want to capitalize
on the publicity.

824
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:08,988
They're talking about
opening another location in Brooklyn.

825
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:14,035
That's great. They
want you to be the head chef.

826
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:19,206
You mean I'd have my own restaurant?

827
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:27,256
Mazing, I want. The idea
is that you'll serve everyone's favorites,

828
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:31,135
but with a pared down menu.

829
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,346
A pared down menu.

830
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,432
I'm still the executive chef
of the flagship restaurant,

831
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:41,520
so I have the final approval on
everything, but we'll work on it together.

832
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:46,859
Oh. You have to stick to the brand.

833
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,404
Steaks, potatoes and martinis.

834
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,324
Not any of the fancy European stuff.

835
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:58,204
It won't really be my own kitchen
if I can't make my own food.

836
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,624
I basically still be your sous chef.

837
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,668
This is a big opportunity for you.

838
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:07,254
I thought you'd be excited. I am.

839
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,969
I think I just have a lot on my mind,
the dinner tonight and.

840
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:16,514
And you're right.

841
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,059
It's a lot to digest.

842
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,896
I'll let you concentrate
on what you're doing

843
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:26,899
and I'll go look
at some animals or something.

844
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:32,196
Thanks. And thank
you for coming out to surprise me.

845
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,282
Really appreciate it.

846
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,275
Hey, small world.

847
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:14,655
Big world, small farm.

848
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:16,657
You've assigned quite the shopping list.

849
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:18,409
It'll all be worth it.

850
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:21,996
I've got everything under control.

851
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:27,043
Right. Hey, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about Brett.

852
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:31,213
It just never came up.

853
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,757
You've got a boyfriend.

854
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,134
It's not a big deal. Yeah,

855
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:37,386
that's what I thought.

856
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,764
Why would it be no reason?

857
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:44,143
We're friends house.

858
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,896
Exactly. Just friends.

859
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:51,025
If you'll excuse me,
I've got some shopping to do.

860
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,611
I'll see you in the kitchen.

861
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:56,155
Hey, if you want to talk
about your restaurant,

862
01:07:56,155 --> 01:08:00,284
I decided to sell it. Just like that.

863
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:04,955
Some dreams are just dreams.

864
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:25,267
You all let them go. Is it?

865
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:29,604
You're going to knock them
down and look good doing it.

866
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,526
You know, I haven't said yes, right?

867
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:37,404
I know, I know, but you will.

868
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:40,241
So what are you going to do today?

869
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:43,702
There's a museum nearby, or you could do
one of those walking tours.

870
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:49,250
Now I want to go back to the room
to answer emails, order room service.

871
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:52,253
But you're on vacation.

872
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,337
Yeah, you're right.

873
01:08:54,337 --> 01:08:56,005
I want to watch TV.

874
01:08:57,424 --> 01:09:11,354
Ha'apai, I bet. That's money.

875
01:09:19,737 --> 01:09:22,657
I can't believe you still have
our school chef's coat.

876
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,912
I don't wear it all the time or anything.

877
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,081
Right. Head chef. Aren't you a.

878
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:32,126
Alice got a promotion.

879
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,544
Isn't that great?

880
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:36,462
Yeah. The Thari wants to open
a restaurant in Brooklyn

881
01:09:36,462 --> 01:09:38,841
and its owners want me to run it. Really?

882
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,760
That's wonderful.

883
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,888
I'm really happy for you.

884
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:47,308
Yeah, of course, your own kitchen,
this is what you've been working for.

885
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,144
Congratulations.

886
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:53,522
Oh, that's so sweet.

887
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,148
Well, we got a four course meal to prep.

888
01:09:55,148 --> 01:09:56,775
Let's go. Right.

889
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,611
All right, Tony.

890
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,321
You're on salad and order.
Irv's Christian.

891
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:03,616
You got the appetizer? I'll get main
and I might need a hand with dessert.

892
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,284
Sounds good, huh?

893
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:08,077
All right. Let's get to it.

894
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,188
OK, everyone likes Steak Totar.

895
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:37,066
They will love it.

896
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,168
What's for dessert?

897
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:59,421
Deconstructed apple strudel.

898
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:03,717
Can wait. Sounds delicious.

899
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:16,897
What do you think?

900
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,776
This might sound crazy,

901
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:23,779
but what about cardamom trimming?

902
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:50,097
Genius. Finished.

903
01:11:51,514 --> 01:12:00,065
May I? Here, a magician.

904
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,528
It wasn't even my recipe.

905
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:06,822
I stole it from Chef Baumgarten.

906
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:09,867
You did not share filmgoer
would never make something like this.

907
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:12,327
He was strictly old school.

908
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:16,582
Well, it wasn't exactly his recipe,
but I used it as a jumping off point.

909
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:22,671
It's amazing. Whatever
it is, it wasn't just me.

910
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,966
They still make a great team.

911
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:30,721
Yes. Can I tell you something?

912
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:32,973
Guys, that's talking

913
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:35,559
more plaiting, come on,
our first course goes out in five.

914
01:12:36,934 --> 01:12:38,978
What did you want to tell me?

915
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:42,566
You heard Tony all hands on deck.

916
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:14,514
Well, can I get a photo

917
01:13:14,514 --> 01:13:16,058
blades of grass?

918
01:13:18,977 --> 01:13:21,021
They're handling the circus
quite well, chef.

919
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:24,733
The apps I've learned a thing or two
from the ring master himself.

920
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:29,655
I used to make a huge announcement

921
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:33,157
after dessert. OK.

922
01:13:33,157 --> 01:13:35,619
You don't think I should do.

923
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:37,287
Only you can do that.

924
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:40,666
And Daniela Christian,
what are you doing here?

925
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,459
Shouldn't you be in the kitchen?

926
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:43,877
Can I have a word?

927
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,965
Now, excuse me a moment.

928
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,056
So what's so urgent?

929
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:59,351
Being your apprentice
has been a true honor,

930
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,853
and I appreciate that
you think I can do what you can do.

931
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:04,982
It's your dream.

932
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:09,778
No. It's not my dream
is to own my own restaurant.

933
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:13,740
And I know that you've been preparing
for your retirement and you deserve that.

934
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:18,912
But I'm not the person
to take your place. Christian.

935
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:23,959
I don't want to say

936
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:27,921
this is a lot to take in right now.

937
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:30,924
This time, it's time to heal. Yes.

938
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:39,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

939
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:45,564
welcome to this very special dinner
honoring Chef Rafael The Room.

940
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:56,325
Tonight's meal has been prepared
by our judges panel

941
01:14:56,950 --> 01:15:01,871
Tony Mitchell, Alice Myers
and my nephew, Christian Graham.

942
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:05,166
And now I believe our first course
is about to be served.

943
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:09,630
But hello, everyone.

944
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:13,634
Tony Mitchell, many of our dishes
this evening come from France,

945
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:15,260
which, of course is Chepa Frails.

946
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:18,263
Oh, and your first course is a mushroom

947
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:21,892
tartlets made with fresh
local mushrooms. Bon appetit.

948
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,304
So. Our next course

949
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:01,807
is steak tartare.

950
01:16:41,054 --> 01:16:44,933
For main course,
I've prepared my take on Blanket Duvel.

951
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:48,895
It's a personal favorite
and a classic of cuisine bourgeoisie.

952
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:18,008
Messy, so messy.

953
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:19,509
That please get the recipe.

954
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:21,594
This needs to be in my next cookbook.

955
01:17:21,594 --> 01:17:23,388
And doing you'll get full credit.

956
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:26,224
Yes, of course. I'd be honored.

957
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:31,772
I don't know. To me,
this is a bit complicated. Excuse me.

958
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:36,026
Do you know the prep for this requires
some serious technique?

959
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:39,612
And in my opinion, it is flawless.

960
01:17:40,237 --> 01:17:42,866
Unless the flavors, though,
they're complex and accessible.

961
01:17:43,407 --> 01:17:45,327
Susan, look around the entire room.

962
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:47,037
Everyone's loving.

963
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,957
What do a bunch of rednecks
know about food? Right.

964
01:17:52,041 --> 01:17:53,293
That is so rude.

965
01:17:53,293 --> 01:17:55,796
And what do you know about
cooking, young man?

966
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:59,132
I am the executive chef at the Bowery
in New York City.

967
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,802
And I know a good man when I taste one.

968
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:05,972
Rockefeller, for instance, or

969
01:18:05,972 --> 01:18:08,350
a filet mignon. Is that so?

970
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:11,311
And do you think filet
mignon is better than this?

971
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:15,065
I cannot agree with you.

972
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:17,359
And I am French.

973
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,986
I agree. This dish is sublime.

974
01:18:21,112 --> 01:18:23,865
That was. Come on. Yes, OK. Sure.

975
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:29,996
But it meant this is a fireworks show
steak. And potatoes.

976
01:18:30,746 --> 01:18:33,916
I think that's what everybody here wants.

977
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,254
Can I talk to you from.

978
01:18:53,853 --> 01:18:55,981
Some people like steak and potatoes.

979
01:18:56,356 --> 01:18:58,358
A lot of people really.

980
01:18:58,358 --> 01:19:00,736
But I don't. And I am tired

981
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,780
of you trying to shove it down my throat.

982
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:07,784
And I don't care
if you think my food is too fancy

983
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:11,496
or complicated or European. It's my food.

984
01:19:12,121 --> 01:19:16,418
And as much as I appreciate
the opportunity to run my own kitchen,

985
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:19,004
if I can't make what I love,

986
01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:21,339
I don't want it.

987
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:26,011
You're making a big mistake,
Alison. I quit, Fred.

988
01:19:26,969 --> 01:19:29,055
The Bowery and us.

989
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:35,853
He sure. Have it your way.

990
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,993
I'm sorry about that.

991
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:51,161
I didn't mean to ruin the meal.

992
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:53,496
Oh, not at all, dear.

993
01:19:54,246 --> 01:19:57,083
I'm pretty certain that you made.

994
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,960
And if he's not going to eat his, I just.

995
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:13,600
Before we serve dessert,
I have an announcement.

996
01:20:14,934 --> 01:20:20,773
Lately, I've been considering retirement
stepping down from the Phillips Group

997
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:25,403
after a long and very fulfilling career.

998
01:20:25,862 --> 01:20:29,574
But after all the fun
I've had this weekend and the lessons

999
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:32,619
I've learned from Chef Rafael,

1000
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:37,332
Chef Alice and Chef Christian,

1001
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:43,004
I want you all to know
that Daniela Phillips is here to stay.

1002
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:47,092
I love my job and I'm not going anywhere.

1003
01:20:59,103 --> 01:21:01,022
Why didn't you just tell me?

1004
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:02,941
I wanted to make you happy.

1005
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:04,568
I don't want to let you down.

1006
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:07,654
Christian could never
let me down. I love you. You

1007
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:18,790
changed your mind.

1008
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:21,209
I came to my senses.

1009
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:26,255
You know, chef, I'm going to be in Paris
for a few business meetings,

1010
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,425
should I find myself
having a free evening,

1011
01:21:29,425 --> 01:21:32,637
would it be possible
to reserve a table at your restaurant?

1012
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:36,057
You'll have the best seat in the house

1013
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:38,602
next to the kitchen,
I hope. But, of course.

1014
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,731
So you're not taking over the Phillips?

1015
01:21:44,148 --> 01:21:46,776
Just like that. Just like that.

1016
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:51,698
Which means I guess
you can open up that restaurant now.

1017
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,284
They're still going to have a chef.

1018
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:57,245
Oh, that is a problem. It is.

1019
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,249
I don't suppose you're interested.

1020
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:10,383
I'll take that as a yes, that's a yes.

1021
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:33,573
That might be some kind of.

1022
01:22:36,993 --> 01:22:46,127
Ladies. Stuff that.

1023
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,925
Chef, now I'm going with the crab.

1024
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:11,111
I believe I have a reservation
under the name at Danniella. You made it.

1025
01:23:12,612 --> 01:23:14,823
I'm so proud of you.
