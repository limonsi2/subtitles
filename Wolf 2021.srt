I was a German shepherd,

is corned beef.

00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,970
Go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go.

186
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:39,007
[footsteps running]

187
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:49,638
Nature is a construct of man.

188
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:51,191
Quicker, quicker.

189
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:53,297
Dr. Mann
will tell you all about it--

190
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:55,023
his plastic theories.

191
00:15:57,853 --> 00:16:00,131
We call him the Zookeeper.

192
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,719
Keep clear of him.

193
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:04,273
Dr. Angeli's better.

194
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:05,895
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

195
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,554
Still, she buys into
his methods, so...

196
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:11,971
Go, go, go, go, go. Go.

197
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:15,905
She says
it's an illness we can cure.

198

[footsteps running]

199
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:26,847
Well, what is it, then?

200
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,230
God.

201
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,168

202
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,456

[leaf crackles]

204
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:11,064
DR.
Come on.

205
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,618
Hey! Come here.

206
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:16,069
DR.Come on, Jeremy.
There's no trick.

207
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,969
Do you need me to help you out?
Come on.

208
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:21,592
Let's see you at it.

209
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:23,525
That's it.

210
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,528
Be yourself.
This is who you are.

211
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:28,530
There, yes.

212
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:30,566
Go.

213
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:32,568
Don't be shy
in front of our new friend.

214
00:17:32,603 --> 00:17:34,743
Climb this tree.

215
00:17:34,777 --> 00:17:37,056
Come on.
Should be easy for you.

216
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,750
That's it.

217
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:47,514
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

218
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:51,277
No, no. Like a squirrel.

219
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:53,002
Not like a boy.

220
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:58,525
Don't you know
how squirrels climb?

221
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,666
You should since you are one.

222
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:07,327
No, no, no.

223
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:09,157
Squirrels go vertically.

224
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:13,264
They use their pads and
their claws to go up, up, up.

225
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,922
So come on, use those pads,
those claws.

226
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:18,476
Yes. Yes.

227
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:20,478
Latch on. Yes.

228
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:22,963
Come on, Jeremy.

229
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:25,173
Come on, Jeremy.
This is what you are.

-That's it. Keep trying.

237
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,741

-What's the matter?
-[sobbing continues]

243
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:00,622

[whimpers]

245
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,350
Oh, come on.

246
00:19:04,384 --> 00:19:05,937
It's nothing.

247
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:08,837
[sobbing]

248
00:19:08,871 --> 00:19:12,323
You see now
you can't truly be a rodent?

249
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:14,463
No?

250
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:16,465
All right. We'll get you there.

251
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,742
It's trial and error.

252
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:19,158
Help him out.

253
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:22,161
You're all tangled up.

254
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,232
He's got a bit of a...

255
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:26,337
bit of a scratch on his finger.

256
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:30,893
Anja will take care of you.

257
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,556
Jacob.

258
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:42,629
Jacob the wolf.

259
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:49,049
If you're a wolf...

260
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:52,536
...get down on all fours.

261
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,193
Come on.

262
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,574
[Jacobs grunts, pants]

263
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,266
That's it.

264
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,200
Now, if you're a wolf, howl.

265
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,927
Attack me if you're a wolf.

266
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:08,966
You've attacked people before,
haven't you?

267
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,761
Your parents told me
what happened.

268
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:12,245
I don't want to be a wolf.

269
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,282
Don't lie to me.

270
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:16,594
I've known boys
who thought they were wolves

271
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:18,734
and died because of it.

272
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:22,773
Now, howl.

273
00:20:24,602 --> 00:20:26,639
-Please.
-Howl!

Good boy.

Did you see that?

277
00:20:50,456 --> 00:20:52,354
He resisted.

that with these hands,

that, uh...

292
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:18,198
this is a boy.

293
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:20,028
Is that right?

294
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:28,933
You say you don't want
to be a wolf.

as a wolf.

-[groans]
-Stop it.

371
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:17,445
This is my turf,
and you're gonna get us caught.

372
00:29:18,618 --> 00:29:20,275
I can't.

373
00:29:23,727 --> 00:29:25,764
[footsteps approaching]

374
00:29:29,388 --> 00:29:31,459
[both panting]

00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:34,496
[door opens]

376
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:38,500
Someone there?

377
00:29:38,535 --> 00:29:40,157
Hello?

378
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,726
[distant, animallike moaning]

379
00:29:58,762 --> 00:30:00,281
[distant moaning continues]

00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:02,317
[door closes]

381
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,907
[whispers]:
Not there. Come on.

[short howl]

[Jacob howls softly]

[dogs barking in distance]

392
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:21,120
Better?

393
00:31:34,513 --> 00:31:36,411
Do you work here?

394
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:40,139
Not exactly.

395
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:45,144
How do you have the keys?

396
00:31:46,456 --> 00:31:48,113
I'm connected.

397
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:58,088
So you're a patient?

398
00:32:01,195 --> 00:32:02,886
Not exactly.

399
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:08,547
How long have you been here?

400
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:12,654
Long enough.

401
00:32:17,176 --> 00:32:18,867
Too long.

402
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,977
Ever think of running away?

403
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:28,739
Only one person ever did.

404
00:32:30,672 --> 00:32:32,640
He was beaten to a pulp
by local thugs

405
00:32:32,674 --> 00:32:35,470
and died of starvation
in the forest.

406
00:32:37,645 --> 00:32:39,405
That sounds made up.

407
00:32:40,406 --> 00:32:42,063
It's not.

408
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:45,170
It's the truth.

409
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:00,909
-[Louise neighing]
-[quiet chatter]

410
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:10,885
Some things for you.

411
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,783
To eat, mostly.

412
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:16,304
-Thanks, Mum.
-Oh.

413
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:18,410
[Jacob's father clears throat]

414
00:33:18,444 --> 00:33:21,033
-I have another little bracelet
for you. -[Father chuckles]

415
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:22,690
[chuckles]
I thought you might like

416
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:24,416
something colorful
on your wrist,

417
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,419
if you're feeling
a bit low or...

418
00:33:34,115 --> 00:33:36,566
It doesn't seem too bad here.

419
00:33:38,982 --> 00:33:41,398
Your brother wanted
to join us, but...

420
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:43,055
How's he doing?

421
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,505
[indistinct chatter]

422
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:46,231
He misses you.

423
00:33:46,265 --> 00:33:47,715
Come with me.

424
00:33:47,749 --> 00:33:49,165
-I miss him, too.
-Dr. Mann?

425
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:51,098
Dr. Mann!

426
00:33:51,132 --> 00:33:53,790
DR.
Is there a problem, Mrs. Walsh?

427
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,241
MRS.
Look what you've done to him.

428
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:58,588
Right, um, you have to trust
our process.

429
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:00,279
-We only do what's needed.
-Needed?

430
00:34:00,314 --> 00:34:02,178
This is brutality.

431
00:34:02,212 --> 00:34:03,938
I'm not leaving my son here.

432
00:34:03,972 --> 00:34:06,803
Mrs. Walsh, I understand
your anguish. I really do.

433
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,530
It's difficult to see
those we love suffer,

434
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:12,360
but imagine how much more
he will suffer outside.

435
00:34:12,395 --> 00:34:16,054
Species identity disorder,
it stems from trauma,

436
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:18,090
isolation, insecurity,

437
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,368
but these patients can be cured.

438
00:34:20,403 --> 00:34:23,647
And my sole mission is to ensure
that I do everything it takes

439
00:34:23,682 --> 00:34:26,754
so they can resume a happy,
healthy and rewarding life.

440
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:30,482
Is that not what you want
for your son?

441
00:34:32,173 --> 00:34:34,658
Come on,
let's go and speak in private.

442
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:36,764
You're fine.
Come on, Mrs. Walsh.

443
00:34:36,798 --> 00:34:38,835
[quiet chatter]

444
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,981
You have to get better.

445
00:34:49,535 --> 00:34:51,813
You deserve a normal life.

446
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,506
A family.

447
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,301
-A job.
-Edwina.

448
00:34:56,335 --> 00:34:58,061
Well, he does.

449
00:34:59,614 --> 00:35:02,272
Don't you want
all of those things?

450
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:16,666
[indistinct chatter]

451
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,047
I... Well, I...
Th-There's some stuff in there.

452
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:21,015
DR.
It's mostly empty pages.

453
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:22,982
-There's, uh...
-[camera clicking]

454
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:26,331
-DR.- Two pages.
-- Yeah.

455
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:28,367
DR.That's it,
use the screen as your eyes.

456
00:35:28,402 --> 00:35:30,058
[Rufus speaking indistinctly]

457
00:35:30,093 --> 00:35:31,750
DR.
Yes, I can see that.

458
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:35,995
This is all you've written:
"Today...

459
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,274
"me and Squirrel played fetch.

460
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:39,792
-Yeah.
-"It was fun.

461
00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:41,967
-I love fetch."
-[chuckling]: Yeah.

462
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:46,178
Yeah. We-we-we played, uh,
fetch, um, yesterday.

463
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:47,869
And it was... it was fun.

464
00:35:47,904 --> 00:35:50,389
I'm sure it was fun.
But, Rufus, this is

465
00:35:50,424 --> 00:35:52,391
where you're supposed to put
your inner feelings.

466
00:35:52,426 --> 00:35:54,807
It's picture time, Judith.

467
00:35:54,842 --> 00:35:58,086
It's picture time,
Judith.

468
00:35:58,121 --> 00:35:59,812
-Off.
-Off.

469
00:35:59,847 --> 00:36:03,091
Judith, I don't want
to repeat myself again.

470
00:36:03,126 --> 00:36:05,749
It's picture time, Judith.

471
00:36:05,784 --> 00:36:08,511
DR. ANGELI [sighs]:
Come on, you can play later.

472
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:10,582
You can lay Peter.

473
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,896
She's not having a breakthrough.

474
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:16,519
-Right.
-[camera clicking]

475
00:36:16,553 --> 00:36:18,348
Well, maybe I should do
some work with you.

476
00:36:18,383 --> 00:36:20,005
DR.
No, I think she's too fragile.

477
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,593
I just need
some more time with her.

478
00:36:21,627 --> 00:36:23,595
-Animal freaks!
-[panicked gasping]

479
00:36:23,629 --> 00:36:25,597
-This is how you'll end up!
-[Rufus barking]

480
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:28,082
[frantic chatter,
patients making animal noises]

481
00:36:28,116 --> 00:36:30,222
[alarm blaring]

482
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:31,603
-DR.Try and stop him.
-[Rufus barking]

483
00:36:31,637 --> 00:36:33,191
Go through
the main entrance, please.

484
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:34,226
-Rufus, quiet!
-[barking stops]

485
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:35,400
Go inside, everybody, please.

486
00:36:35,434 --> 00:36:37,022
-Go inside now.
-Inside.

487
00:36:37,056 --> 00:36:38,506
-Come on.
-[alarm blaring]

488
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:40,059
-Come on!
-That's it. That's it.

489
00:36:40,094 --> 00:36:41,854
I'll go and see if
the CCTV caught anything.

490
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:43,615
Come with me and see
if they tried to force

491
00:36:43,649 --> 00:36:45,099
-the back doors.
-DR.It's all fine.

492
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:47,757
They're just some angry,
mean people

493
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:50,415
with no empathy
for those who are different.

494
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:52,279
That's it. In you go.

495
00:36:52,313 --> 00:36:54,281
[footsteps receding]

496
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:43,882
[Jacob grunts softly]

497
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:15,914
[leaves and weeds
rustling in wind]

498
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:31,032
I've been here
since I was little.

499
00:38:34,484 --> 00:38:37,556
And Dr. Angeli's been
like a mother to me.

500
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:42,216
This place is all I've known.

501
00:38:47,394 --> 00:38:51,536
The only thing I remember
from before was this water.

502
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:55,919
And there was a crack
in the ceiling, and...

503
00:38:57,887 --> 00:39:01,960
...there was this water that
just never stopped dripping.

504
00:39:06,516 --> 00:39:10,037
I would hear it, and I would...

505
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,041
...count the drops all night.

506
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:19,978
And that's the first thing
I remember.

507
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,572
And I wish I didn't.

508
00:39:32,922 --> 00:39:34,786
What about you?

509
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:46,798
I've always had this feeling.

510
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:50,733
These instincts.

511
00:39:54,495 --> 00:39:58,430
Everything I was learning
as a child just...

512
00:39:58,465 --> 00:40:00,328
felt wrong.

513
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:04,367
Didn't fit.

514
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:11,857
I can't explain it.

515
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:19,313
[quietly]:
Go on.

516
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:34,190
We were walking
through the nature park...

517
00:40:36,157 --> 00:40:38,194
...when I heard a sound.

518
00:40:41,887 --> 00:40:43,855
I can still feel it.

519
00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:48,653
It felt like
it was meant for me.

520
00:40:52,898 --> 00:40:55,073
I wanted to run towards it.

521
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:58,456
And I tried.

522
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:02,874
I tugged away from my father,
and I ran towards it.

523
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:08,811
I felt...

524
00:41:08,845 --> 00:41:10,882
such lightness.

525
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,369
Every breath.

526
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,653
He pulled me back.

527
00:41:25,379 --> 00:41:27,450
Took me up in his arms.

528
00:41:29,452 --> 00:41:31,868
And he was speaking to me,

529
00:41:31,903 --> 00:41:33,939
but I couldn't hear him.

530
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:39,082
All I could hear was this howl.

531
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:46,434
And then I looked into his eyes.

532
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,924
And I remembered I was his son.

533
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:21,055
What is it about the forest?

534
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:36,450
The smells.

535
00:42:40,488 --> 00:42:42,145
The ground.

536
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:46,184
Damp.

537
00:42:47,185 --> 00:42:48,842
Cold.

538
00:42:49,808 --> 00:42:51,845
[wind howling]

539
00:42:53,812 --> 00:42:55,607
This skin.

540
00:42:56,988 --> 00:42:59,922
These arms, this hair.

541
00:43:03,477 --> 00:43:06,273
I have no human form.

542
00:43:11,312 --> 00:43:12,969
I'm running.

543
00:43:15,938 --> 00:43:17,698
Breathing.

544
00:43:20,218 --> 00:43:22,841
[Judith screaming]

545
00:43:22,876 --> 00:43:24,843
No! No!

546
00:43:24,878 --> 00:43:26,327
No!

547
00:43:26,362 --> 00:43:29,123
-That's it, go. Fly.
-No, no. No, please.

548
00:43:29,158 --> 00:43:31,781
-Yes. Jump.
-No. No!

549
00:43:31,816 --> 00:43:34,128
-Come on, jump.
-No. No, no.

550
00:43:34,163 --> 00:43:36,130
Are you, or are you not
a parrot?

551
00:43:36,165 --> 00:43:37,476
I am.

552
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:39,271
-You are? Then fly.
-No!

553
00:43:39,306 --> 00:43:41,653
No. [whimpering]

554
00:43:41,688 --> 00:43:44,104
-If you're a parrot, then fly.
-No. No.

555
00:43:44,138 --> 00:43:45,830
No, no, no, no. No, no!

-No, no!

No, no, no, no! I'm a girl!

558
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:50,697
I'm a girl, I'm a girl,
I'm a girl, I'm a girl.

559
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:52,560
[panting]

560
00:43:52,595 --> 00:43:54,321
DR.
What are you?

561
00:43:55,494 --> 00:43:57,462
I'm a... I'm a girl.

562
00:43:57,496 --> 00:43:58,843
Good.

563
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:00,568
Very good.

564
00:44:00,603 --> 00:44:02,640
[Judith whimpering softly]

565
00:44:05,056 --> 00:44:06,713
DR.
This is freedom.

566
00:44:06,747 --> 00:44:09,854
The will to be responsible
to ourselves.

567
00:44:11,821 --> 00:44:15,169
When you're old,
you'll remember me

568
00:44:15,204 --> 00:44:18,276
as the man who taught you
to walk for the second time.

569
00:44:20,727 --> 00:44:22,452
Take her down.

570
00:44:37,295 --> 00:44:39,262
Go on, through to lunch.

571

[snarling and hissing intensify]

00:48:30,355 --> 00:48:32,840
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

585
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:34,842
Stop.

00:48:34,877 --> 00:48:36,914

[wind howling outside]

590
00:49:42,082 --> 00:49:44,774
DR.
You know what a howl is?

591
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:49,365
It's you...

592
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,678
wanting to be heard.

593
00:49:54,681 --> 00:49:57,718
There's something
you want to say,

594
00:49:57,753 --> 00:50:00,031
something...

595
00:50:00,066 --> 00:50:03,448
you want to scream out
to the world.

596
00:50:09,558 --> 00:50:12,423
Your, uh... your parents.

597
00:50:13,769 --> 00:50:15,460
Your father.

598
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:20,879
What kind of relationship
did you have with him?

599
00:50:27,576 --> 00:50:29,578
[teeth chattering]

600
00:50:30,786 --> 00:50:32,822
What's your earliest memory?

601
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:35,722
Jacob?

602
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,187
DR.
Oh, let's see happiness.

603
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:54,085
Good. Happiness.

604
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,122
I'm seeing that happiness
radiate from your face.

605
00:50:56,156 --> 00:50:57,537
That's it.

606
00:50:57,571 --> 00:50:59,470
See what that does to you, Ivan?

607
00:50:59,504 --> 00:51:01,644
How does it brighten up
your face?

608
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:03,715
-Can you show me? Look at that.
-[Ivan quacking]

609
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:06,063
Good. And that's how
happiness begins.

610
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:08,720
But happiness becomes laughter.

611
00:51:08,755 --> 00:51:11,723
[Dr. Angeli laughing heartily]

612
00:51:11,758 --> 00:51:15,658
Like it's the best joke
you've ever heard.

613
00:51:15,693 --> 00:51:18,109
Yes, Ola, that's it.

614
00:51:18,144 --> 00:51:20,007
[laughing]:
Show me that bright smile

615
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:21,768
coming from deep inside.

616
00:51:21,802 --> 00:51:24,460
[Dr. Angeli continues laughing]

617
00:51:24,495 --> 00:51:26,738
You got to let
that laughter out.

618
00:51:26,773 --> 00:51:29,327
And sometimes
it tightens up your face.

619
00:51:29,362 --> 00:51:32,503
Let's have hysterical laughter.

620
00:51:32,537 --> 00:51:34,160
Yes, Ivan.

621
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:36,265
[laughing hysterically]

622
00:51:38,716 --> 00:51:40,959
Hysterical laughter
will also come out of here.

623
00:51:40,994 --> 00:51:42,478
See if you can find that.

624
00:51:42,513 --> 00:51:44,308
Let's hear it. [whoops, laughs]

625
00:51:44,342 --> 00:51:45,999

We're laugh... we're laughing.

-DR.That's it.
-We're laughing.

627
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:51,038
DR.Let me hear
what a giggle sounds like.

628
00:51:51,073 --> 00:51:53,179
[giggling]: A giggle is very
different to everything else.

629
00:51:53,213 --> 00:51:56,043
A giggle isn't a laugh
quite yet.

630
00:51:56,078 --> 00:51:59,840
It's a giggle, and it's
bubbling up all small inside.

631
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,773
That's it. That's good.

632
00:52:01,808 --> 00:52:04,086
Yes, Louise.

633
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:06,537
Yes, Ivan, good.

634
00:52:08,677 --> 00:52:11,473
[fading]:
Yes, yes, yes.

635
00:52:20,206 --> 00:52:21,655
I fancy... [grunts]

636
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,174
some duck for dinner, eh?

637
00:52:23,209 --> 00:52:25,142

Get off me. Get off me.

641
00:52:31,838 --> 00:52:34,461
Yes, I'll-I'll leave him alone.

-DR.Jacob!

647
00:52:49,027 --> 00:52:50,546
Jacob, get off!

648
00:52:50,581 --> 00:52:51,858
Get off!

649
00:52:51,892 --> 00:52:53,549
-Come with me.
-Freak!

650
00:52:53,584 --> 00:52:55,275
Get off. Come with me.

651
00:52:57,381 --> 00:52:59,072
We'll get it sorted.

652
00:53:00,038 --> 00:53:01,868
Mm-hmm.

653
00:53:01,902 --> 00:53:03,835
Okay, yeah.

654
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,906
All right. I'll see you then.

655
00:53:06,942 --> 00:53:08,426
Okay.

656
00:53:08,461 --> 00:53:10,532
Chat soon. All right, bye-bye.

657
00:53:15,088 --> 00:53:17,539

658
00:53:18,954 --> 00:53:20,714
Jacob.

659
00:53:22,129 --> 00:53:24,580
I'm Dr. Sullivan,
the general manager.

660
00:53:27,549 --> 00:53:29,999
And, Jacob,
this is your only warning.

661
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:36,558
Violence will not be tolerated
in this institution.

662
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:45,325
Your parents have been informed.

663
00:53:48,155 --> 00:53:49,743
Another episode like this,

664
00:53:49,778 --> 00:53:51,987
and you'll face
serious consequences.

665
00:53:55,508 --> 00:53:57,820
You don't want
to go down this path.

666
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:04,033
I hope this is
sinking in, Jacob.

667
00:54:06,173 --> 00:54:08,279
For your own sake.

668
00:54:08,314 --> 00:54:10,764
You won't get anywhere
by fighting us.

669
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:12,007
Okay.

670
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:14,009
Rufus, you ready?

671
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:15,838
[Rufus clears throat]

672
00:54:15,873 --> 00:54:18,634
Okay, so, uh, as you all know,

673
00:54:18,669 --> 00:54:21,672
I've been doing
incredibly well recently.

674
00:54:21,706 --> 00:54:23,467
Exhibit A.

675
00:54:23,501 --> 00:54:27,229
And, uh, as a result,
Mum is taking me out.

676
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:31,958
I know. She says I've been here
long enough and that...

677
00:54:31,992 --> 00:54:34,788
you know, she wants to give me
a chance on the outside, so...

678
00:54:34,823 --> 00:54:37,308
Everyone's thinking, what's
Jacob gonna do without me?

679
00:54:37,343 --> 00:54:39,345
He's getting emotional,
but yeah.

680
00:54:39,379 --> 00:54:41,450
And look, I'm sad, too,
uh, that I'm missing

681
00:54:41,485 --> 00:54:43,694
the Almost Out graduation
tomorrow.

682
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:45,972
And that I won't be able
to graduate with you guys

683
00:54:46,006 --> 00:54:47,594
when the time comes.

684
00:54:47,629 --> 00:54:49,596
But Mum knows best.

685
00:54:49,631 --> 00:54:51,874
But anyway, we're gonna go
on holiday together.

686
00:54:51,909 --> 00:54:55,602
And, um, I'm gonna be
on my best human behavior.

687
00:54:55,637 --> 00:54:58,156
But I want to leave you
with one message.

688
00:54:58,191 --> 00:54:59,882
-And that's-- my success...
-Rufus.

689
00:54:59,917 --> 00:55:01,850
Your mother's not
taking you on holiday.

690
00:55:01,884 --> 00:55:03,541
-She is...
-Your mother is collecting you,

691
00:55:03,576 --> 00:55:05,025
but she's not taking you
on holiday.

692
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,889
We're going on
a-a sort of holiday,

693
00:55:06,924 --> 00:55:10,030
but-but what I wanted to say is
it's kind of a holiday.

694
00:55:10,065 --> 00:55:12,239
It's a home holiday.

695
00:55:12,274 --> 00:55:16,382
Anyway,
my success is your success.

696
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:18,038
The moment was slightly...

697
00:55:18,073 --> 00:55:20,109
Anyway, my success
is your success.

698
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:31,604
[classical music playing]

699
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:38,852
DR.Now, as is tradition
when our patients graduate,

700
00:55:38,887 --> 00:55:43,063
we like to honor their hard work
with a little ceremony.

701
00:55:43,098 --> 00:55:47,551
So, please, come to the front,
Robert Ward.

702
00:55:47,585 --> 00:55:49,622
Well done, Robert.

703
00:55:53,211 --> 00:55:56,007
Hold it up, Robert,
so the parents can see.

704
00:55:56,042 --> 00:56:00,391
Now, your goodbye consists
with the final severance

705
00:56:00,426 --> 00:56:02,428
from your animal.

706
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:08,710
When you're ready, Robert.

707
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:10,332
It's time.

708
00:56:12,058 --> 00:56:14,163
That's it.

709
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,031

Knowing that he was coming.

806
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:48,755
I would close my eyes tight...

807
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:50,827
and imagine...

808

...that I could jump
out the window

809

and fall to the ground
unscathed.

810
