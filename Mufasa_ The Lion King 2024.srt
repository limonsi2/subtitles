1
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,750
Look at the stars.

2
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:49,917
Whenever you feel alone...

3
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,208
the great kings of the past...

4
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,083
will always be up there to guide you.

5
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:57,250
And so will I.

6
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:19,667
My friends, the time of my family's growth
is upon us.

7
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:24,500
This home we share is the fulfillment
of my father's vision.

8
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:28,667
How wonderful is it that Nala and I
get to continue his dream...

9
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,417
and make even greater the Circle of Life?

10
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,875
Nala, my love, I'm on my way.

11
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:20,458
Simba...

12
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,583
I'm here.

13
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,250
I'm here.

14
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,792
Security detail has arrived!

15
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,458
One gentle reminder: we are not food.

16
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,625
No, no, no. We are just two guys...

17
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,083
walking to work
through a pride of hungry lions.

18
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,958
Which is perfectly normal.
I'm not terrified.

19
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:55,500
Security detail reporting for duty,
Your Grace, Your Highness...

20
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:58,083
Ruler of all four-legged creatures.

21
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,458
And that one three-legged zebra.

22
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,875
Oh, right, Ron. That was tragic.

23
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,333
- It was an eat-and-Ron.
- Yeah.

24
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,417
Ron has three legs.
That's still one more than me.

25
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,625
- Well, are those arms or legs?
- Guys.

26
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:09,458
- I don't know. I think they're paws.
- Guys.

27
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,417
- I consider all those legs.
- Guys! This is serious.

28
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,500
I need you to stay with Kiara
until I get back.

29
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:20,291
Are you saying that your security detail
has been called on to do babysitting?

30
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,375
Pumbaa, we should really discuss this
because I don't really love...

31
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:26,000
Guys, I promised her
everything would be okay.

32
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:27,292
Well, that's one way to parent.

33
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,500
She's gonna have to grow up sometime.

34
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,250
What else did you tell her, that she
could be whatever she wants to be?

35
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:32,458
That life is fair?

36
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,917
I need you two to try
and act like adults, okay?

37
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,125
Don't scare Kiara.
And most of all, no stories.

38
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:39,750
- No stories?
- Wait a second.

39
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:42,458
I know where your head goes.
I grew up with you two. Promise me.

40
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,417
Okay. You know what, you know what,
you know what? Fine. No stories.

41
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,958
Speak for yourself, Pumbaa.

42
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,167
No. We'll tell a story anyway.

43
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,750
Okay, we'll tell him that
we're not gonna tell a story and then...

44
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,792
- we're gonna tell a story.
- Are you guys serious?

45
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,500
- He can't stop us.
- I'm clearly within earshot.

46
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:55,792
Dad.

47
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,958
Hey, little one.

48
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:04,167
Dad, the storm's coming, and I'm scared.

49
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,833
I wanna go with you and Mom.

50
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:07,542
Don't be scared, my love.

51
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,750
Timon and Pumbaa
will watch you while I'm gone.

52
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:11,375
Be brave now, Kiara.

53
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,000
Be brave.

54
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,083
Okay! We've prepared a story.

55
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,625
Scar looked at us.

56
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,875
He knew it was the end of the line.

57
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,875
I could smell the fear.

58
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:31,167
That was actually me, but yes.

59
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,792
So you two defeated Scar?

60
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,042
And then you ate him?

61
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,208
Honestly, one of the best meals I ever had.

62
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,292
My dad told me he defeated Scar.

63
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,417
Well, okay. But your dad,
as we all know, is a pathological liar.

64
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,667
He's always lyin'. Get it?

65
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:07,333
I'm scared. I want Mom and Dad.

66
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,625
Look, look, look.

67
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,417
Don't be scared, Kiara.

68
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:14,000
How about we sing you a song?
And, a-one...

69
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,667
Pumbaa, no, it is way too early for the song.

70
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,292
It worked on Simba.
He thought he had murdered his own father.

71
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,292
He was singin' and dancin' around in seconds.

72
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,417
I can't just turn it on like that.
I have to be in the moment.

73
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,792
He sang that song for six years straight.

74
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,375
Well, who didn't?

75
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,083
- Look!
- No!

76
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,042
It's Ron, the three-legged zebra.

77
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,333
- Run for your lives!
- He heard what we've been sayin' about him.

78
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,292
We're sorry, Ron. They were jokes.
They were just jokes!

79
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:37,917
It's Rafiki.

80
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,917
Rafiki! Rafiki!

81
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,833
Little one, there's no reason to cry.

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
My parents...

83
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:47,542
they're gone.

84
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,208
Look out there, mdogo.

85
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,250
You see those baobab trees
blowing in the wind?

86
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,042
The roots of those trees are very strong,
like your family.

87
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,083
And, just as they did for you...

88
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,750
your parents have gone
to the ceremonial birthing grounds.

89
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:10,042
And when they return, the Circle of Life
will bring a blessing to you, Kiara...

90
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,542
that you will never forget.

91
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,542
Man, he's good.

92
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,458
He's such a visual storyteller.

93
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,708
Yet it makes sense that he lives alone.

94
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,000
I just want the storm to pass,
and then I promise to be brave.

95
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:25,708
I'll tell you a secret.

96
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,250
When your father Simba was your age...

97
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:32,250
he was afraid of the thunder
and would hide behind the king.

98
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,625
When did he stop hiding?

99
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:35,875
One day, during a big storm...

100
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:41,167
your grandfather Mufasa took your father
to the very top of Pride Rock...

101
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,833
told him to stand with him...

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,875
and howl into the wind.

103
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:47,833
And Simba slowly stepped out with the king.

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,333
And together, they roared into the night.

105
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:55,167
But I'm not brave like my dad.

106
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,667
And I could never be like Mufasa.

107
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,458
Is that so?

108
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,167
Then maybe it's time I tell you a story.

109
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,458
A story of a cub, not much bigger than you.

110
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,125
A lion born without a drop
of nobility in his blood.

111
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:15,125
A lion who would change our lives forever.

112
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:17,833
A story! So glad I brought some crickets.

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,708
But go easy. We're in a cave.

114
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,500
This story begins far beyond...

115
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,500
the mountains and the shadows.

116
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,458
On the other side of the light.

117
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:30,875
In this place,
everything was dying of thirst...

118
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:35,542
as 20 full moons had passed
without a single drop of water.

119
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,457
But when the skies finally opened...

120
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,000
destiny would reign.

121
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,625
Mufasa.

122
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:15,208
Mufasa! Come see.

123
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:23,833
Mom, what is that light way out there?

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,667
Oh, that's very special.

125
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,458
Beyond the horizon...

126
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,750
beyond the last cloud in the sky...

127
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:34,708
that's a place we call Milele.

128
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:35,917
Milele?

129
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:38,375
It means, "forever."

130
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:41,625
Imagine a kingdom full of life...

131
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,417
water and food...

132
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,375
grass and sky as far as the eye can see.

133
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:49,667
Will we ever go there?

134
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,292
Oh, yes, Mufasa.

135
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,458
That's exactly where we're headed.

136
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,625
But we can also be there right now.

137
00:09:57,042 --> 00:09:58,708
We can close our eyes.

138
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,167
Let our dreams take us.

139
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,167
Beyond the horizon

140
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,042
Beyond the last cloud in the sky

141
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,708
There's a place I know

142
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,167
Imagine a kingdom

143
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,333
The water flows, the grass is high

144
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,042
It's not a dream

145
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,250
Someday we'll go

146
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:41,750
We call it Milele

147
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:46,000
It's always there

148
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,583
Milele

149
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:53,833
It lives in you, it lives in me

150
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,750
You'll see

151
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,500
- Life, great and small
- The Circle of Life is not small

152
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:05,667
- We know that there's enough for all
- There's enough for all

153
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,292
There is always more

154
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,667
- Can you feel it?
- Can you feel it?

155
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:15,583
- We're on your side
- We'll wander no longer

156
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,167
- We carry ancestors inside
- Like a constant tide

157
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,667
- It's not a dream, can you see it?
- On an endless shore

158
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,167
- And as you grow, can you find your way?
- Can you see it?

159
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,250
We call it

160
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,750
Milele

161
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,417
It's always there

162
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,708
Milele

163
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,583
We call it

164
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,833
Milele

165
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,333
It's always there

166
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,042
Milele

167
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:58,042
It lives in you, it lives in me

168
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,125
We're free

169
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:05,000
Milele

170
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,583
Wow.

171
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:16,792
What is this?

172
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,917
Rain. Rain!

173
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,208
Oh, finally we have rain!

174
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:26,417
Dad, race you to the light!

175
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,042
You're too fast.

176
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:30,792
I've never beaten you.

177
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,708
Nobody has ever beaten you.

178
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:34,542
I know!

179
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:39,042
Mufasa! Fastest cub in the world.

180
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:10,417
Thank you.

181
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,167
Mufasa...

182
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,208
that's enough.

183
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,000
Mufasa, come back now.

184
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,250
Mufasa, stay there! I'm coming, son.

185
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,458
- Father!
- Mufasa!

186
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,250
Mufasa?

187
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,875
I'll catch you on the turn.

188
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,458
Find my voice.

189
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,250
Find my voice!

190
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,417
Mom!

191
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,208
Mufasa, the cliff is too high,
but you can cross at the dam.

192
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,583
Come on, Mufasa, you can do this.

193
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,292
Find your mother's voice.

194
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,292
Listen to your father, Mufasa!

195
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,792
Listen to us!

196
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,875
Afia, he's there.

197
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,167
- Mom!
- He's there!

198
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,125
- Mother!
- Mufasa!

199
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,958
Find your footing one step at a time.

200
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,708
- I can't.
- You can do this. I'm right here.

201
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,167
Mufasa!

202
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:42,917
Mom?

203
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:45,417
Dad?

204
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,583
Can you hear me?

205
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,375
Is anyone out there?

206
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Mom?

207
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,083
Please.

208
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,750
I'm scared.

209
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,625
I'm scared.

210
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,542
The floodwaters joined a distant river...

211
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:14,458
carried Mufasa far
from his mother and father.

212
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,750
Beyond all that he knew.

213
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:45,292
Hello.

214
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:49,167
I'm Taka, son of Obasi.
What's your name?

215
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,458
Mufasa.

216
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,333
I'm not allowed to talk to Outsiders...

217
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,208
but I have a secret...

218
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,375
and I really want to tell you.

219
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,375
- What's the secret?
- I'll get in trouble.

220
00:16:58,542 --> 00:16:59,542
Please, just tell me.

221
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:01,333
I don't know.

222
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,542
Just tell me!

223
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,875
Okay. You're about to be eaten.

224
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,250
I hate secrets!

225
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,541
- Swim!
- But I can't!

226
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,333
- You have to swim.
- I don't know how!

227
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,583
All right. Chin up,
then walk underwater really fast.

228
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,958
I can't!

229
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,583
Come on, Mufasa. Faster!

230
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,291
Help me, Taka! Help me!

231
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,375
I told you to wait for me.

232
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:41,833
It's not my fault, Mum.

233
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,500
I came down for a drink
and saw him floating by.

234
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:45,917
I'd like you to meet Mufasa.

235
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:50,292
You're lucky those crocs were young
and afraid to fight. Let's go!

236
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,958
We can't just leave him here.

237
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,875
Rules are rules, Taka.

238
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:56,375
Obasi will never accept a stray.

239
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,292
I'm not a stray. I'm just... lost.

240
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,458
See?

241
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,875
He's just lost.

242
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,292
There was a flood.

243
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,083
My parents, they tried to save me.

244
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:13,667
Do you know which way is home?

245
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,542
Home?

246
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,667
To be lost is to learn the way.

247
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,750
Call me Eshe.

248
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm tired, Eshe.

249
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,125
Come on, it's this way.

250
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,958
Come on, Mufasa.

251
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:54,958
Is this Milele?

252
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,167
No, my love.

253
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,083
I was trying to nap, Eshe.

254
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,583
The all-important nap of kings...

255
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,375
only to be awoken by the disgusting...

256
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:13,125
hideous, revolting stench of a stray.

257
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:14,417
When we come upon an Outsider...

258
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,958
tell me, what do we do?

259
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,875
Obasi, I know.

260
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:20,042
Eat it.

261
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,958
But I found him, Dad. I saved his life.

262
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,667
Taka, we do not associate with Outsiders.

263
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,667
The only true bond is blood.

264
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,750
I've heard stories of lions twice our size.

265
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,500
These Outsiders...

266
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:37,042
will devour everything in their path.

267
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:39,708
Does he look like he's going to devour you?

268
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,792
That smell is disgusting.

269
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,125
I'm not even sure I could eat this kibeti!

270
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:48,208
I'm not a kibeti. I'm a Mufasa.

271
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,667
- Do you even know what "Mufasa" means?
- No.

272
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,833
It means, "king."

273
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,417
And that's me.

274
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,000
You better start running, little Mufasa...

275
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,167
for your life.

276
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,375
If I run, you'll never catch me.

277
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm the fastest cub that ever lived.

278
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,208
My father told me so.

279
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,917
Taka, you have a challenge.

280
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,625
They will race to the dead tree and back.

281
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:09,750
And when the prince defeats him...

282
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,375
I will finish him in one bite.

283
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:14,500
What if Mufasa wins?

284
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,958
If he wins, he lives, Obasi.

285
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:19,333
He stays with me.

286
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,292
You have my word.

287
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,833
Let the race begin!

288
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,583
Clumsy little stray.

289
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,167
Run, Mufasa!

290
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,917
You did not have to do that.

291
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,917
Taka is the future king.

292
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,000
He has to win his first challenge.

293
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:39,375
No, Obasi. To be a true king,
he must earn it.

294
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,042
Don't take that away from him.

295
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:39,417
Better hurry.

296
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:04,542
I have one more secret, Mufasa.

297
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,167
I always wanted a brother.

298
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:26,917
Cheater!

299
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:27,958
Obasi!

300
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,000
You will keep him with the females.

301
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:35,917
Taka, how could you lose to a stray?

302
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:38,583
Well done, Taka.

303
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,125
Well done.

304
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,792
I thought you said you were fast.

305
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,042
I had to let you win.

306
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,083
Well, I did just go days with no sleep
while riding the waves of...

307
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:48,833
Anyway, come on, Mufasa.
Let's get in some trouble.

308
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,625
When I am king

309
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:56,958
No other animal will break my stride

310
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,875
Break my stride

311
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,333
- And my brother
- My brother

312
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,208
When I'm king, you'll always take my side

313
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,292
- Ha! Yeah, right
- That's right

314
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,292
- When I am king
- When you are king

315
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:12,208
No other animal will break our pride

316
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,542
Break our pride

317
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,625
- And my brother
- My brother

318
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,958
Our prey may run away,
but they can't hide

319
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,833
Watch your hide

320
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,500
Let's go, let's go

321
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:24,708
Let's go

322
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:29,375
Hey, did your mama say
you could be up this late?

323
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,208
Okay, she didn't say either way

324
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:32,542
Hide away, let's go

325
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:37,000
Hey, did your father say
you could be out this far?

326
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,292
Okay, we're on our way

327
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,125
On our way, run away
Let's go

328
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:44,833
Hey, did your mama say
you could be up this late?

329
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,083
Ha ha, you're very sharp

330
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,833
Yes, you are,
yes, you are, let's go

331
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,750
Hey, did your father say
you could be out this far?

332
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,417
Make a wish on the brightest star
And I say

333
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:59,208
I always wanted a brother
I always wanted a brother

334
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,208
I always wanted a brother
just like you

335
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,042
And I always wanted a brother

336
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,917
I always wanted a brother

337
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:10,208
I always wanted a brother
just like you

338
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,417
You see that tree?

339
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:15,375
Those birds are watching the world unfold

340
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,708
The world unfold

341
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,917
- Oh, brother
- My brother

342
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,792
When I'm king, they will do as they're told

343
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:25,667
You may look down on them

344
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,500
- But they are free
- You can't catch me

345
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:30,583
And where they go
cannot be controlled

346
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,375
No one looks down on me

347
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:35,625
They look down on us, brother

348
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,292
Some things you chase
but you cannot hold

349
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:41,792
- Okay, it's getting old, let's go
- Let's go

350
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:46,875
Hey, did your mama say
that you could learn this way?

351
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,667
I've got to find a way, find our prey

352
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,000
- Fine, I'll wait
- Let's go

353
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:52,667
- Hey
- I heard his father say

354
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,833
He doesn't want this stray

355
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:57,375
I dare you to say that again to my face

356
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:59,125
What did you say 'bout my brother?

357
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:00,958
That's not a stray, that's my brother

358
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,583
You stay away from my brother
'cause I say so

359
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,875
If you put your paws on my brother

360
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,792
You'll meet the jaws of his brother

361
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,042
Those are the laws for my brother

362
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:12,917
Where'd he go?

363
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:24,333
I always wanted a brother

364
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,292
I still remember my mother

365
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:32,125
One season after another

366
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:36,125
One season after another

367
00:25:36,292 --> 00:25:39,917
One season after another

368
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:43,750
One season after another

369
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,500
- Everyone sing for my brother
- Hey

370
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,583
- I'd do anything for my brother
- Hey

371
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,417
- Soon I'll be king with my brother
- Hey

372
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:51,500
- By my side
- Hey

373
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:53,458
- I always wanted a brother
- Hey

374
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,250
- Now we rely on each other
- Hey

375
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:57,500
- One season after another
- Hey

376
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,833
- Hey, Mufasa
- Yes, Taka?

377
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,917
- I'll race you to the other side
- Hey

378
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,833
- Race you to the other side
- Hey

379
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,375
Race you to the other side
Ha!

380
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,708
Elephant stampede!

381
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,458
Run for your lives!

382
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,292
Chigaru jumped, like, 20 feet.

383
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,625
Oh, that's a new record.

384
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:32,917
Obasi, they did it again.

385
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,917
Your sons are nothing but trouble.

386
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,083
That one is not my son.

387
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,167
They're heathens, the both of them.

388
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:42,542
This stray is forbidden
to be near the Shade Tree.

389
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:43,958
Mufasa and I were just playing.

390
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,625
You two will never be brothers.

391
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:48,167
Now go back to the females...

392
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:51,042
and stay away from my son.

393
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:55,000
Oh, your mother, she adopts every lizard...

394
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:57,500
speaks to passing grasshoppers.

395
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:58,667
I want to go with him.

396
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,458
You want to be with the females?

397
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:02,208
You belong with the males.

398
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,167
He gets to hunt with Mother.

399
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,917
One day, he will betray you.

400
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,667
That is what strays do.

401
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,250
Mufasa would never betray me.

402
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:12,708
Hey, hey.

403
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:15,625
This will all be yours, my son.

404
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:18,125
You will be king.

405
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:19,542
So pay attention.

406
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:23,083
Study every move I make.

407
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,083
Sleeping again.

408
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,333
That is what males do.

409
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,667
We protect the pride as we nap.

410
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,083
That's...

411
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,042
Well, that's power.

412
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,375
Power?

413
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,667
Why are we stopping?

414
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,500
Close your eyes.

415
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,958
And tell me what you hear.

416
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,833
What you feel.

417
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:12,750
There's a herd of antelope
heading across the dry lakebed.

418
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:15,625
About half a day from here?

419
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:17,833
And how do you know they're not gazelles?

420
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,083
Their steps are too heavy.

421
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,542
- Moving way too slow.
- What else?

422
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,125
Come on. You can do it.

423
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:32,000
When the wind hits their horns,
it moves up...

424
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:36,042
instead of across.
So, definitely antelope horns.

425
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:37,708
Very good.

426
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:46,125
What is it, Mufasa? What's wrong?

427
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,125
Sometimes I get a scent.

428
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:50,667
It's barely a trace on the wind.

429
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,417
And it smells like home.

430
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Then it's gone.

431
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,167
Mufasa, your parents are still out there.
We can keep looking.

432
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,542
I lost them, Eshe.

433
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,833
You're wasting your time
training me like this.

434
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,875
But these skills you have,
no other male has them.

435
00:29:09,042 --> 00:29:11,250
Obasi will never accept me.

436
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,917
I'll never be his blood. His family.

437
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:18,542
But you are my family.
And if Obasi could see how gifted you are...

438
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:21,583
Well, maybe I like being a stray, you know.

439
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,292
No rules, no responsibility.

440
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,958
I'm the lucky one, Eshe.

441
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,500
What do you mean, Mufasa?

442
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:29,667
I never have to be like Taka.

443
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:32,292
I never have to be king.

444
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,625
Did he say, "no rules and no responsibility"?

445
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:50,125
An outcast, afraid of water,
never takes a bath.

446
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:51,667
Which means he smells like me.

447
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,083
Which is not good.

448
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,125
Well, either way,
I think that means that he's one of us.

449
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:58,000
- This is it.
- It's our time!

450
00:29:58,167 --> 00:30:01,292
- This is our moment.
- And a-one, and a-two and a-one, two...

451
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,333
Hakuna Mufasa

452
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,708
What a wonderful name

453
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:07,750
Hakuna Mufasa

454
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:10,167
He ain't no passin' craze

455
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,417
It means no...

456
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:12,750
- Stop!
- What?

457
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:14,167
Don't go there.

458
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,833
All right, all right, Rafiki's right.
We'll get letters from legal.

459
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,708
Those vultures will take everything we have.

460
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:20,625
Which, technically, is nothing.

461
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,000
Look at us. We're naked animals.

462
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:23,458
No wonder I'm always freezing.

463
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:25,667
- They want this!
- Come on, Pumbaa.

464
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:26,833
Let's bring it home.

465
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,292
Hakuna Mufasa

466
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,333
Quiet!

467
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:31,833
Kiara's a music snob.

468
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,917
Rafiki, keep going.

469
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:41,375
Later that day, Eshe was teaching Mufasa
how to hunt in pairs.

470
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:45,542
But, as Taka was secretly watching...

471
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:48,125
something terrible was hunting them.

472
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:44,625
Mufasa, run!

473
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,000
Eshe!

474
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:49,792
Mother.

475
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,042
Mother!

476
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,250
Eshe!

477
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,375
Keep moving, Mufasa.

478
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,167
They go for the neck!

479
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:34,000
It's okay, Mufasa.

480
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:36,083
It's okay.

481
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,833
It's okay.

482
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,500
That was very brave of you, Mufasa.

483
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:42,667
Thank you.

484
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:51,292
Eshe...

485
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:52,833
What has happened?

486
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:56,292
Are you hurt?

487
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,458
They were huge. White as ghosts.

488
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,125
Like nothing I've seen before.

489
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:05,792
Obasi.

490
00:33:07,042 --> 00:33:09,625
Had Mufasa not been there, I...

491
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:15,583
Taka.

492
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:29,292
I owe you a great debt, Mufasa.

493
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:31,792
We need to prepare.

494
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:34,542
They're downwind less than a day away.

495
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:36,833
No.

496
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,875
You couldn't possibly know this.

497
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:41,292
Send a scout and you'll see...

498
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,708
they'll be coming for us.

499
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:45,917
Chigaru.

500
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:50,458
Father, please, let me explain.

501
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,458
No. Not now.

502
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:55,958
Taka, come.

503
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,208
Where is my son?

504
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:20,292
There was a young lion, Majesty.

505
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,667
He fought Shaju.

506
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,833
And yet you came back.

507
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,833
You survived.

508
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,083
I was badly hurt. I promise, Majesty.
This is the truth.

509
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,458
- The truth?
- Yes, the truth.

510
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,917
The truth is standing behind you.

511
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,667
- There were others, Majesty.
- No, no, no.

512
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,625
But only one left blood on his mane.

513
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:49,208
Which means he left Shaju to die.

514
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:50,667
Saved himself.

515
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:53,708
This young lion, was he their king?

516
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,333
His blood is common. Ordinary.

517
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Answer me!

518
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:59,708
Was he their king?

519
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:04,375
No, Kiros, you are the only king.

520
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,583
An ordinary lion?

521
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,583
And you left my son to die?

522
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,625
I was injured. There was no choice.

523
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,833
Please, Majesty, you have to believe me.

524
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,083
There's no reason to fear me.

525
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,708
I would never harm one of my own.

526
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,000
Thank you, Majesty.

527
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,750
I'll leave that pleasure...

528
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:25,917
to them.

529
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,542
Majesty! No. Kiros!

530
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:31,167
Kiros!

531
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,250
No one can ever know you ran.
That you ran from your mother.

532
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,458
It never happened, Taka.
Do you understand?

533
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,708
But I didn't know.
I was just... I was just scared.

534
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:54,833
It doesn't matter.
We must protect the bloodline.

535
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,083
Protect it with a lie?
Father, that's deceitful.

536
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:02,417
Deceit is a tool of a great king.

537
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:04,958
Taka...

538
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:08,875
it's what kings must do.

539
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,667
But I'm not a king.

540
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:12,417
I'm just your son.

541
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:13,875
Obasi!

542
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,125
Chigaru.

543
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:17,292
Obasi!

544
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:21,625
Chigaru, I'm here. What did you see?

545
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:23,292
They're coming this way, Obasi.

546
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:25,375
Two lions for every one of ours.

547
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:27,208
Each one bigger than the next...

548
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:31,333
but none as mighty as Kiros,
their terrifying king.

549
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,292
Outsiders.

550
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,750
The stories were all true.

551
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:39,000
I must protect the bloodline, Eshe.

552
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:41,042
The future of this pride.

553
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,042
Taka, you are that future.

554
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,042
Future? Dad, what do you mean?

555
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:48,250
I'm sending you away.

556
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:50,333
Far from here.

557
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:55,292
You will leave and start a new life,
a new beginning.

558
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,625
I need you to go with him, Mufasa...

559
00:36:57,792 --> 00:36:59,417
to pledge your loyalty.

560
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:01,958
They'll arrive with the sunrise.

561
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,083
Where will we go, Eshe?

562
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,708
Without you, I have no home.

563
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,958
Mufasa, you and Taka together. That...

564
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:19,000
- That is home.
- Eshe...

565
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:20,833
Mufasa, look out there.

566
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:22,583
Beyond the light...

567
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,042
You know what I see?

568
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:28,833
I see the place your mother told you about,
a place beyond the river's end.

569
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,292
Across the deepest canyon
on the other side of the mountains...

570
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,875
a place beyond the horizon itself.

571
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:37,208
A pride land so green...

572
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,208
so perfect...

573
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:43,417
that to see it is to see...

574
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:44,750
Milele.

575
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:47,500
Yes. Forever.

576
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:51,750
My parents spoke of Milele often.
My mother told me it was where we were going.

577
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:53,417
And don't you see, Mufasa?

578
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:54,708
You must keep going.

579
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:57,125
You must continue your journey
toward the light.

580
00:37:57,292 --> 00:38:00,125
Please, Eshe. I can't lose you.

581
00:38:00,292 --> 00:38:02,917
You have my love always, Mufasa.

582
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:05,958
But your family is still out there,
waiting for you.

583
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,667
I can feel their presence.

584
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:09,500
And I know you can, too.

585
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Go.

586
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:15,250
Go, Mufasa. Find your way home.

587
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,750
Mother, please forgive me. I beg you.

588
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:29,125
There's no need, my love.

589
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:32,167
Taka, your moment of courage will come.

590
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,250
Now both of you go.

591
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,250
Go and find your place...

592
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,250
in the Circle of Life.

593
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:08,000
They left their family
never to see them again?

594
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:09,333
This story is killing me.

595
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,042
It's toying with my emotions.

596
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:12,667
And here is the worst part.

597
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,542
- What's that?
- I'm out of crickets.

598
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:15,958
Oh, maybe that's for the best.

599
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,667
I need a bathroom break
before the second act.

600
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,292
Everyone wait for me.

601
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:25,542
I am back.

602
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,708
- Pumbaa, did you wash your hooves?
- Mm-hmm.

603
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:29,250
- Pumbaa?
- I did. I did.

604
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:30,667
- Pumbaa?
- I'm just gonna...

605
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,417
- walk on them again right after.
- Pumbaa?

606
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:37,000
Rafiki, did the Outsiders come?

607
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,167
Yes.

608
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:41,083
And as the hunters led Kiros
into the Valley of Kings...

609
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:44,625
Obasi and Eshe stood their ground.

610
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,417
Which one of you is king?

611
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:03,542
You have no reason to challenge me.

612
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:08,208
Does this look like a challenge, King?

613
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:11,042
There are rules among lions.

614
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,375
Not anymore.

615
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:16,042
While you ruled this pride,
I've built my army.

616
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,042
Yours is the last pride...

617
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:21,167
in the Valley of Kings, which means...

618
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:25,208
everything the light touches belongs to me.

619
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,042
There will be one ruler.

620
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:29,833
One Lion King.

621
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:41,042
You say you're the king,
but you lie around in the shade

622
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,667
Out of shape, unafraid

623
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:48,042
The moon cuts a path through the sky

624
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:50,292
By night or by day

625
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,667
It doesn't obey

626
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:55,042
And neither do I

627
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:57,708
You took my son

628
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:02,292
I hope you can run

629
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:06,542
'Cause I'm going to be
the last thing you see

630
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:08,625
Before you go bye-bye

631
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:11,042
There you go, bye-bye

632
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,667
Climb every tree
Cross land and sea

633
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,542
I'll make you go bye-bye

634
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:19,875
I'll make you go bye-bye

635
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:24,667
Everything in my clutches, ha!
Bye-bye

636
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,042
Everything the light touches

637
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:32,958
The Circle of Life is a lie

638
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,875
A pretty way to say

639
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:37,667
There are predators and prey

640
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:41,875
That circle of vultures up high

641
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,208
They keep stealing glances

642
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:46,417
They don't like your chances

643
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,875
And neither do I

644
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:52,250
I run my pride

645
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:56,000
You run and hide

646
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,500
'Cause I'm going to be
the last thing you see

647
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:02,500
Before you go bye-bye

648
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:04,792
There you go, bye-bye

649
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:09,500
Climb every tree
Cross land and sea

650
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:11,708
Until you go bye-bye

651
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,708
Will you go bye-bye?

652
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,167
Bye-bye, for vengeance is mine

653
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:22,000
If I'm the last of my line

654
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:27,958
I must be strong

655
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,333
Gotta go bye-bye

656
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:31,625
I'll make you go bye-bye

657
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:38,167
Bye-bye

658
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,542
We have to move. They'll be tracking us.

659
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:50,583
- Taka!
- What if you're wrong?

660
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:51,958
What if they're okay?

661
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:54,417
They live in you now.

662
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,417
Follow me, brother.

663
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,458
We have to move...

664
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:00,583
together.

665
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:26,792
Run, Mufasa.

666
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:29,500
Run!

667
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:31,750
Hunters.

668
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:33,250
What's the plan?

669
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:36,542
Run! Very fast!

670
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:43,542
This way!

671
00:43:58,167 --> 00:43:59,417
Back to the trees.

672
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,250
We're trapped. We have to swim.

673
00:44:01,417 --> 00:44:02,833
No, we have to fight.

674
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,458
If we fight, we die.

675
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:06,000
But if we swim, we drown.

676
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:08,250
Okay, I didn't want to do this...

677
00:44:08,417 --> 00:44:10,500
- but I command you to swim!
- You what?

678
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:13,292
You pledged your loyalty.
I command you to swim.

679
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:15,958
Taka, this is not the time for jokes.

680
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,083
Which one of you killed my son?

681
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,333
I did. This lion with me
is nothing but a stray. Let him go.

682
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,208
Kiros, the other is no stray.

683
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,125
He holds the blood of the pride.

684
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:43,500
The last blood of the king?

685
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:48,208
Blood for blood.

686
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:05,958
They're coming!

687
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:07,708
What do we do?

688
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,167
We find the advantage?

689
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:12,917
What advantage?
We're on a rock in the middle of the water!

690
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,417
Taka, this is it. We go for the king.

691
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,083
Mufasa, I'm ready.

692
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:29,417
Just one last thing.

693
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:30,625
- What?
- Chin up!

694
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:33,333
Taka!

695
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:36,917
This was a bad idea.

696
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,042
Mufasa!

697
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:47,625
Mufasa!

698
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,417
- Mufasa, we're alive.
- Yeah!

699
00:45:57,583 --> 00:45:59,792
I did it. I saved us.

700
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:04,083
You were saying?

701
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:34,333
Okay. Okay.

702
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,208
No more water.

703
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:38,417
Tell me you can track them down river.

704
00:46:38,583 --> 00:46:40,833
We can track them anywhere.

705
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,583
They can run, but they can't hide.

706
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:47,375
So just to be clear, we're not in this story?

707
00:46:47,542 --> 00:46:50,833
It feels a little bit like
Kiros is stealing my thunder here.

708
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Yeah. You know, I don't feel seen.

709
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:55,667
No. There's a lotta stories with all of us.
Tell one of those!

710
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:57,625
Can I make one small suggestion?

711
00:46:57,792 --> 00:47:00,375
Less childhood trauma, more meerkat.

712
00:47:00,542 --> 00:47:03,250
Rafiki, I know who Taka's gonna be.

713
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:06,000
Me too. It's so obvious.

714
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:07,833
But maybe,
just so we're on the same page, tell me?

715
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,708
- Is it Simba? Is it me?
- Pumbaa.

716
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:11,667
Oh, wait. Am I Obasi?

717
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:14,042
That makes no sense.
But seriously, I have one question.

718
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,125
Am I Taka?

719
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:20,875
I did it again. I did it again.

720
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,917
Not that I'm counting,
but I saved your hide. Again!

721
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:29,125
As much as it kills you to say it,
let's hear a little, "Thank you, Taka."

722
00:47:29,292 --> 00:47:33,083
You want me to thank you
for pushing me off a waterfall?

723
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,000
Yes, and you're welcome.

724
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:38,250
Look, it's not my fault
crocodiles are simply attracted to you.

725
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:40,500
Don't say that.

726
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:46,708
I did it again. I did it...

727
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:49,167
Mufasa.

728
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:51,833
Is it them? Is it the Outsiders?

729
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,875
No. She's right there.

730
00:47:54,042 --> 00:47:55,167
"She"?

731
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,292
There's no place to run.

732
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:00,875
We have your scent.

733
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:02,208
My scent?

734
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:04,708
I've been stalking you two all night.

735
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:06,708
That's not possible.

736
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:09,750
Then why did I circle you
three times in this wood...

737
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:12,125
while you two
were chasing each other's tails?

738
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:33,250
That's embarrassing.

739
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:37,167
Yeah, well, I meant to do that, so...

740
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:39,250
Still think I'm afraid?

741
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:44,542
- Why are you following us?
- I was hoping to find my pride.

742
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:46,583
- What happened to them?
- The Outsiders happened.

743
00:48:47,042 --> 00:48:50,833
A few of us got away,
but you're the only other lions I've seen.

744
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:53,083
You two better keep moving.

745
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,500
Wait! Please.

746
00:48:55,917 --> 00:48:56,917
My name is Taka.

747
00:48:58,083 --> 00:48:59,792
Son of Obasi.

748
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:01,625
I know what it's like to lose everything.

749
00:49:01,792 --> 00:49:03,042
Come with us. We can help you.

750
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:04,792
I don't need any help.

751
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:07,083
But you don't have anyone.

752
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,875
She does indeed have someone.
Thank you very much.

753
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:12,250
That's Zazu. Don't eat him.

754
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:13,875
You heard her. Do not eat me.

755
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:16,833
As a recent addition
to the King's Royal Guard...

756
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,792
I must kindly ask you both to move on.

757
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,708
Thank you for stopping by.

758
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,917
Your king hired a bird to protect you?

759
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:25,792
How high can you fly?

760
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:28,625
Look, I needed a scout.

761
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:30,375
Zazu was the last option.

762
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:32,083
Well, next to last.

763
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,083
Between Albert the Iguana and I...

764
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,833
His Majesty
decided on the underling with wings.

765
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,792
And thus, I became the lead scout
for the princess.

766
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:43,750
It's my third day, going swimmingly,
if I may say so myself.

767
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:45,208
Sarabi, you can say so as well.

768
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:46,958
How far do you think you'll get with a bird?

769
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:51,000
How far do you two geniuses think you'll get
stumbling around, running into each other?

770
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:53,083
All the way to Milele.

771
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,042
- Milele is nothing but a myth.
- It's not a myth.

772
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:57,292
Circle of Life and fairy tale herds.

773
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:59,375
- You're chasing something that doesn't exist.
- Honestly. As If.

774
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:02,000
I don't know that Milele exists,
but right now...

775
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,333
it's the only hope we have.

776
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,333
We don't need hope. We need food.

777
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:11,208
Good job, brother. Real nice.

778
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,333
There's trouble in the trees.
My first real trouble...

779
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,500
and I am going to pass. Not going.
I am staying right here, thank you.

780
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:20,875
Come on, Sarabi.
Looks like there's dinner headed our way.

781
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:23,125
Sarabi, if I may.

782
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:26,375
He makes a valid point, Your Highness.

783
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:29,042
But, on the other hand,
he's a starving lion, he wants to eat me...

784
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:30,458
so I am slightly torn.

785
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,917
I think that went quite well,
all things considered.

786
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,500
And now, Kiara, this is where I come in.

787
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,500
Rafiki.

788
00:51:00,042 --> 00:51:02,708
Order! We will have order
in the Congress of Baboons.

789
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:06,333
Tonight, a cheetah came into our trees
for the third night in a row.

790
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,833
Almost took one of our own.

791
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
It was Rafiki's fault.

792
00:51:09,292 --> 00:51:11,250
He summoned the beast with his dreams.

793
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:14,792
Rafiki and his visions
must be banished once and for all.

794
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:16,125
Rafiki tried to warn you.

795
00:51:16,292 --> 00:51:20,000
His dreams conjure our enemies.
He talks to the spirits, summons the devil.

796
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:22,292
- What are you talking about?
- He's done it before.

797
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,417
His brother was chased
from these very trees...

798
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:25,708
never to be seen again.

799
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,083
Rafiki was just a child.

800
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,833
A child born with a leg that does not work.
Yet somehow, he survived?

801
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,458
It was Rafiki who found water
in the dry season.

802
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:35,958
Who healed you, Inaki, when you were sick.

803
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:39,208
He speaks to the insects,
converses with the moon.

804
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:42,333
Zala, you know what will happen
if you send him down from the trees.

805
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,292
He is amelaaniwa!

806
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:45,333
A curse to us all.

807
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:47,625
- That's not true.
- He doesn't belong here.

808
00:51:47,792 --> 00:51:50,667
All in favor of banishment, cover one eye.

809
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,417
How can you trust him?

810
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:54,375
Don't trust him, and I don't trust his magic!

811
00:51:54,542 --> 00:51:55,500
He doesn't belong here.

812
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:57,417
He's not a baboon.
And he never will be.

813
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:59,000
He's not one of us.

814
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:01,125
And so, it is time.

815
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:02,583
No, wait.

816
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,625
Where will you go?

817
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:07,208
Where I should have gone long ago.

818
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:09,417
To find all that was lost.

819
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:11,167
My family.

820
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:13,458
You can't survive on your own.

821
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:14,958
Nobody can.

822
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:17,500
And yet, here we are.

823
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:20,750
Oh, Rafiki.

824
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:25,375
The eye never forgets
what the heart has seen.

825
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:47,000
It's all right.

826
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,083
You can try to run,
but I'm afraid you won't get very far.

827
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,042
And why would I run from you?

828
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:28,750
Because we're lions.

829
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:31,625
As in lions!

830
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:36,125
A flea can trouble a lion
more than a lion can trouble a flea.

831
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:38,958
I don't think you understand
what's about to happen.

832
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:40,625
There's no place for you to go.

833
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:42,583
I am going forward.

834
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,167
I seriously doubt that.

835
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:48,125
It is easy to doubt everything
when you know nothing.

836
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:50,375
Can we get on with this, please?

837
00:53:50,542 --> 00:53:53,833
If you take my life,
you will never find Milele.

838
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,750
Wait, did you say Milele?

839
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:58,750
That is where I'm going. Toward the light.

840
00:53:58,917 --> 00:54:02,542
I have been there many times in my dreams.

841
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:04,708
My brother waits for me there.

842
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,208
I've seen the tree.

843
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:08,375
Can picture it. The two of us...

844
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:10,042
together again.

845
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:12,542
And why would anyone trust a baboon's dream?

846
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,958
Sometimes, a dream is all you have.

847
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:17,500
The only truth that lives in you.

848
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:20,125
Like the memory of a great king.

849
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:21,708
How did you know?

850
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:25,167
Okay. Help us get to Milele,
and we will let you live.

851
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,917
- Do we have a deal?
- No.

852
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:28,250
What? Why?

853
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:31,417
Rafiki will let you live.

854
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,708
I've had enough of this!

855
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:35,542
Taka, do not eat him.

856
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:38,667
Wonderful. Another misfit stray
we're not supposed to eat.

857
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:41,417
So, you expect us to follow this baboon...

858
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:44,000
to a place nobody has ever seen?

859
00:54:44,667 --> 00:54:45,833
I'll be better off alone.

860
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:49,750
A single stick may smoke...

861
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:51,792
but it will never burn.

862
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,458
Okay, now that there's five of us...

863
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:59,208
why don't we all go around
and say a fun fact about ourselves?

864
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:00,375
I'll go first.

865
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:03,500
I once had a crush on a flamingo.

866
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,667
I've never said that out loud.

867
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,292
And they're walking away.

868
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:09,250
Yeah, places to go, kingdoms to see.

869
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:10,875
We're busy. Let's hustle.

870
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:23,417
Wait, wait, wait.
Now you're the star of this thing?

871
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:26,167
Someone's a little tired
of bein' second banana, huh?

872
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:28,625
All of a sudden,
there's a lotta Rafiki in this story.

873
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,667
You even gave yourself a long-lost brother.

874
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:32,625
- Yeah.
- What's next? A funny catchphrase?

875
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:34,792
You gonna be fartin' next?
'Cause that's my thing.

876
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,333
You cannot tell the story of Mufasa...

877
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,958
without the story of Rafiki.

878
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:42,500
Oh, now he's even talkin' about himself
in the third person.

879
00:55:42,667 --> 00:55:43,917
Pretty soon, he'll have his own fragrance.

880
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:46,458
And I'm the only one
with a fragrance around here.

881
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:48,167
It's called "Pumbaa by Pumbaa"...

882
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:50,833
and from what I hear, it's pretty gross.

883
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:52,958
Mom? Dad?

884
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:55,750
If you can hear me, come home.

885
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:57,875
Please.

886
00:55:58,292 --> 00:55:59,542
Come home.

887
00:56:07,292 --> 00:56:08,292
Mother?

888
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:11,667
Mother?

889
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:17,167
Milele.

890
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,500
Mother!

891
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:38,208
Rafiki.

892
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,667
- What are you doing?
- I am fishing.

893
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:43,292
You're sitting on a rock
with your eyes closed.

894
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:46,708
My eyes are open.
It is my lids that are closed.

895
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:49,250
Why am I talking to a baboon?

896
00:56:49,417 --> 00:56:53,167
I am not a baboon.
I am a mandrill.

897
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:56,042
No offense, but a monkey is a monkey.

898
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,625
And a stray is a stray.

899
00:56:57,792 --> 00:56:58,750
What's that supposed to mean?

900
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:01,042
It means we are very much the same.

901
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:04,250
We are nothing alike.

902
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:07,750
Take a good look. I am a lion.

903
00:57:07,917 --> 00:57:11,292
A lion who fears water,
fears his own reflection.

904
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:15,250
Who can't sleep because of what he sees
when he closes his eyes.

905
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:19,458
You are afraid of your dreams, Mufasa.

906
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:21,625
Afraid of what you see in them.

907
00:57:21,792 --> 00:57:24,208
I see my parents.

908
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:26,958
I feel them everywhere.

909
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,917
Of course you do, Mufasa.

910
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:32,125
You will feel them forever.

911
00:57:32,542 --> 00:57:35,458
My mother, I hear her voice.

912
00:57:35,917 --> 00:57:39,625
She tells me that
we are on a journey to Milele...

913
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:43,000
but I feel so lost without her.

914
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:46,625
Your journey is not a dream, Mufasa.

915
00:57:46,792 --> 00:57:48,583
Your mother is guiding you...

916
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:52,250
and where you are going,
a family awaits.

917
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:06,250
What are you doing?

918
00:58:06,792 --> 00:58:07,750
We're starving.

919
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:09,333
'Twas not its time.

920
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:13,208
Instead, the fish has agreed
to let us share the water.

921
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,708
I have a report.

922
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:26,458
It's morning.

923
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:28,792
End of report.

924
00:58:36,542 --> 00:58:39,208
The earth divided is now a choice.

925
00:58:39,417 --> 00:58:40,958
Around or down?

926
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:43,250
The decision is yours.

927
00:58:47,417 --> 00:58:50,208
Look out there, beyond the light.

928
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:53,792
Across the deepest canyon.

929
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:57,208
"Across the deepest canyon."

930
00:58:57,917 --> 00:58:58,917
We should go down.

931
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:01,500
Why? Because of some fairy tale?

932
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:03,042
The rocks will hide our tracks.

933
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:04,667
It's safer to go around.

934
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,250
I picked up their scents.

935
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,917
The only thing you picked up
is a hallucinating baboon.

936
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,167
I am a mandrill.

937
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,708
This is a waste of time.

938
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:13,292
Close your eyes.

939
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:14,833
What?

940
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,708
Tell me what you see. What you feel.

941
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:19,250
There's nothing on the wind.

942
00:59:19,417 --> 00:59:21,875
- No, they're moving through the bush willow.
- They, who?

943
00:59:22,042 --> 00:59:24,875
The females, out front. Come on.

944
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:27,125
Clear your thoughts. Concentrate.

945
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:29,333
I am concentrating.

946
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:42,250
He's right.

947
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:45,292
We have to go down.

948
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:47,292
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

949
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:52,708
Now the many sticks will make fire as one.

950
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:55,792
Come on. We have places to go.

951
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:58,208
And kingdoms to see.

952
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:00,208
And kingdoms to see!

953
01:00:03,542 --> 01:00:05,958
If you wanna go fast, go alone

954
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:08,042
There's the road

955
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:10,083
Off you go

956
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:13,458
But if you wanna go far

957
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:15,333
We go together

958
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,292
So good, so far

959
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:19,125
We go together

960
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:21,750
Your father left you in my care

961
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:25,667
And now we're running who knows where

962
01:00:26,917 --> 01:00:29,125
Sometimes you need a bird's-eye view

963
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,667
And I've got you to see me through

964
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:34,333
By land, by air

965
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,417
If you wanna go fast, go alone

966
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:37,500
Day and night

967
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:39,292
- There's the road
- I just might

968
01:00:39,458 --> 01:00:41,458
- Off you go
- Yeah, right

969
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:44,125
If you wanna go far

970
01:00:44,292 --> 01:00:46,042
We go together

971
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:48,000
So good, so far

972
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:50,000
We go together

973
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:53,958
I will find my family again

974
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:57,875
I will walk with you until then

975
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:01,667
I will walk with you till the end

976
01:01:02,042 --> 01:01:05,083
It's much easier with a friend

977
01:01:05,917 --> 01:01:09,542
I will find my family again

978
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:13,333
I will walk with you until then

979
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,792
- I will walk with you till the end
- Flying through

980
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:20,667
It's much easier with a friend

981
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:22,917
Like the clouds and rain

982
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:27,583
Like a meal in a field of grain

983
01:01:28,458 --> 01:01:31,333
Like the flecks of gold in your mane

984
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,792
Sarabi, you and me, we go together

985
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:39,708
- Like clouds and rain
- We will find our family again

986
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:43,708
- Like a meal in a field of grain
- We will walk together till then

987
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:48,083
- Like the flecks of gold in your mane, Sarabi
- We will find our way to the end

988
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:51,208
- You and me, we go together
- It's much easier with a friend

989
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:55,208
- My brother waits for me to find him
- We will find our family again

990
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:59,042
- My brother knows I'm right behind him
- We will walk together till then

991
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:01,792
- My brother tends to lose his way
- We will find our way

992
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,375
- And go astray, say
- To the end

993
01:02:03,542 --> 01:02:06,875
- If you see my brother, please remind him
- It's much easier with a friend

994
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:10,625
It's much easier with a friend

995
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:15,958
It's much easier

996
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:19,167
- We won't go alone
- Not alone

997
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:21,083
- Here we go
- Here we go

998
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,333
- Down the road
- Down the road

999
01:02:23,542 --> 01:02:25,875
- 'Cause we're gonna go far
- Hey, hey, hey, hey

1000
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:27,833
We go together

1001
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,792
- So good, so far
- Hey, hey, hey, hey

1002
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:31,833
We go together

1003
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:42,542
As we headed across the Great Valley...

1004
01:02:43,167 --> 01:02:45,417
the hunters tracked our every move.

1005
01:02:47,792 --> 01:02:50,042
Kiros. They are not alone.

1006
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:51,958
They've collected a lioness.

1007
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:54,417
And a monkey.

1008
01:03:04,417 --> 01:03:05,542
Mufasa.

1009
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:07,625
Mufasa. You have to help me.

1010
01:03:07,792 --> 01:03:08,667
Help you how?

1011
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:10,167
It's Sarabi, Mufasa.

1012
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:12,417
She is the light my mother spoke of.

1013
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:14,083
- What?
- She's special.

1014
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:16,750
The most amazing female
I've ever met in my life.

1015
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:20,000
I don't know what to say to her.
You've spent your life with females.

1016
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:22,042
Please, tell me what to say.

1017
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:24,417
Just talk to her. Be yourself.

1018
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:25,750
No, Mufasa.

1019
01:03:25,917 --> 01:03:28,375
You don't understand.
Myself isn't good enough.

1020
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:29,917
You...

1021
01:03:30,417 --> 01:03:32,125
just know things.

1022
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:34,708
Fine. Fine.

1023
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:37,792
Keep it simple. Ask her a question.

1024
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:40,750
Right. A question. This is good.

1025
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:44,542
Yeah, try to be confident. Disinterested.

1026
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:46,208
But I'm very interested.

1027
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:49,625
- Tell her about the flowers.
- What flowers?

1028
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:53,250
The valley she comes from.
There's flowers everywhere.

1029
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:55,375
They're called duck flowers.

1030
01:03:55,542 --> 01:03:57,167
Long stems.

1031
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,500
It's absolutely beautiful.

1032
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:01,208
How do you know that?

1033
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:04,417
When she passes, I can smell them on her fur.

1034
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:05,875
Okay.

1035
01:04:06,333 --> 01:04:08,583
Flowers. Disinterested.

1036
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:11,500
- Flowers. And disinterested. Flowers.
- And here's the most important thing, okay?

1037
01:04:11,667 --> 01:04:12,833
- And disinterested.
- Listen...

1038
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,667
- Flowers and disinterested.
- ...when she speaks.

1039
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:16,500
- Males have trouble with that one.
- Flowers...

1040
01:04:17,042 --> 01:04:19,542
Sorry. What did you say?

1041
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:22,458
Really?

1042
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:24,792
I heard you, brother.

1043
01:04:25,417 --> 01:04:27,167
I'm gonna make you proud.

1044
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,833
It's very hot, isn't it?

1045
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:42,292
Yep.

1046
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:46,750
I love listening.

1047
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:48,042
Okay.

1048
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:50,167
- I'm listening right now.
- To what?

1049
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:52,208
- What you just said.
- You're the one that's talking.

1050
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:53,375
I am.

1051
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:56,167
- You smell like a duck.
- What?

1052
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:57,333
Flower.

1053
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,792
A duck flower.

1054
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:02,083
How do you know about those flowers?

1055
01:05:03,458 --> 01:05:05,292
Well, I inhaled you with my nose.

1056
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:06,958
I can smell them.

1057
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,750
That's amazing.

1058
01:05:09,917 --> 01:05:11,958
Our valley was full of those flowers...

1059
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:15,042
thousands of them
as far as the eye could see.

1060
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:18,375
It was the most beautiful place, Taka.

1061
01:05:19,042 --> 01:05:21,042
Did he just say she smells like a duck?

1062
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,333
And you call me a baboon?

1063
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:40,250
They shouldn't be here.

1064
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:42,083
The migration patterns are broken.

1065
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,708
- I don't understand...
- Outsiders!

1066
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:46,333
This is not a drill! Just to be clear...

1067
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,292
I never signed up for this.

1068
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:52,958
It's okay. We're safe.

1069
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,500
They're on the other side.

1070
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:56,292
Nope!

1071
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:57,917
They can just jump across!

1072
01:05:58,083 --> 01:05:59,542
We are trapped!

1073
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:00,833
What do we do?

1074
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,375
The elephants will fight with us.

1075
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:03,542
And why would they do that?

1076
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:06,125
Because I'm going to ask them.

1077
01:06:06,292 --> 01:06:07,667
Got a better idea?

1078
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:10,667
Yes, Mr. Ask-Questions-First.

1079
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:11,875
Get ready to run.

1080
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,833
Where is she going?

1081
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,750
Hello? Listen to me, please.
We need your help.

1082
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,708
Can you talk with me?
We need your help. Please.

1083
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,583
They're coming!

1084
01:06:24,417 --> 01:06:26,583
Sarabi! Sarabi, wait!

1085
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:29,250
Sarabi! Sarabi, wait. Wait!
Where is she going?

1086
01:06:31,292 --> 01:06:33,167
She's going for the hive!

1087
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:36,833
Like I said, get ready to run!

1088
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:50,042
Run!

1089
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:52,125
Get to the trees!

1090
01:06:52,292 --> 01:06:56,083
Why am I running?

1091
01:07:23,042 --> 01:07:25,083
Your Highness, hold on!

1092
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:26,917
Zazu!

1093
01:07:36,292 --> 01:07:37,750
Sarabi!

1094
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:53,167
Stand your ground!

1095
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:54,917
Do not retreat!

1096
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:14,583
I got you.

1097
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:16,207
I got you.

1098
01:08:17,082 --> 01:08:19,292
Sarabi, I got you.

1099
01:08:26,417 --> 01:08:29,417
That's right. Run along, little kitty cats.

1100
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:34,207
Thank you, my friend.

1101
01:08:52,042 --> 01:08:53,332
Over here.

1102
01:09:08,292 --> 01:09:09,625
Sarabi.

1103
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:19,042
Alive. She's alive!

1104
01:09:24,457 --> 01:09:26,000
Why are you all looking at me?

1105
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:28,332
You were thrown from the tree.

1106
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,667
He saved your life.

1107
01:09:31,707 --> 01:09:32,707
Who?

1108
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:33,750
Taka.

1109
01:09:34,832 --> 01:09:36,332
Taka saved you.

1110
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,375
Isn't that right, brother?

1111
01:09:41,917 --> 01:09:43,417
You saved me?

1112
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:46,750
Well, I had to do something.

1113
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:48,082
Thank you.

1114
01:09:49,457 --> 01:09:50,707
We're lucky.

1115
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:53,125
Those bees almost killed us all.

1116
01:09:53,292 --> 01:09:54,875
Those bees saved our lives.

1117
01:09:55,042 --> 01:09:56,458
- Mufasa.
- Really?

1118
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:59,292
Because it felt like an elephant stampede.

1119
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:01,708
- We're alive, aren't we?
- The elephants would have fought with us.

1120
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:02,917
We're lions.

1121
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:04,333
Nobody will fight with us.

1122
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,667
Not out here.

1123
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,708
Where's he going?

1124
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:18,500
Beyond the horizon itself.

1125
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,208
Mufasa, thank you.

1126
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:38,750
Rafiki...

1127
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:41,875
Who are the Outsiders?

1128
01:10:42,042 --> 01:10:45,167
Well, the Outsiders come from many prides.

1129
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:47,042
But, when they are born...

1130
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:50,833
they are hated
because they are different from their tribe.

1131
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,375
Like you and your tribe?

1132
01:10:52,542 --> 01:10:54,125
Yes, just like me.

1133
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:56,458
- But, Rafiki?
- Yes?

1134
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:58,542
Why do they wanna hurt everybody?

1135
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:02,667
Sometimes, when the people most like you
don't love you...

1136
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:06,042
it is a hurt
that can cause the greatest pain.

1137
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:07,708
And this pain...

1138
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:11,250
can lead you to hate everything.

1139
01:11:11,417 --> 01:11:14,000
I'm glad that didn't happen to you, Rafiki.

1140
01:11:14,167 --> 01:11:16,708
Yes, my child. I'm glad too.

1141
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:19,333
Hi. We're here, too.

1142
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,250
Yeah, why are you leavin' us
outside this story...

1143
01:11:21,417 --> 01:11:24,042
when I'm pretty sure
we are the ultimate outsiders.

1144
01:11:24,208 --> 01:11:26,250
- Come on!
- Yeah, we've always been misunderstood.

1145
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,833
I contain multitudes.

1146
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:36,250
There are many ways to Milele.

1147
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:39,333
But this will be ours.

1148
01:11:47,542 --> 01:11:50,167
Go. Go, Mufasa.

1149
01:11:50,583 --> 01:11:52,417
Find your forever.

1150
01:11:53,667 --> 01:11:55,375
I got you.

1151
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:57,708
Sarabi, I got you.

1152
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,083
Hey, Rafiki?

1153
01:12:19,833 --> 01:12:21,000
What are you doing?

1154
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:24,625
I am confirming my vision, Mufasa.

1155
01:12:28,042 --> 01:12:29,917
Can I ask you something, Rafiki?

1156
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:33,125
How many of your visions have come true?

1157
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:36,167
- So far, none.
- None?

1158
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:39,417
But it's not what I see. It's what I feel.

1159
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:41,292
But how do you...

1160
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:44,417
How do you know
when you should follow a feeling?

1161
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:46,750
Milele exists.

1162
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:49,583
I feel it in here.

1163
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:51,250
The question is...

1164
01:12:51,417 --> 01:12:53,792
what do you feel, Mufasa...

1165
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,417
in there?

1166
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:17,000
The weather's shifted.

1167
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:18,833
There's not enough fresh snow.

1168
01:13:19,292 --> 01:13:23,458
Hey, if the Outsiders find our tracks,
they'll follow them to Milele.

1169
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:26,167
Zazu, only you can help us now.

1170
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:28,125
Are you quite sure about that?

1171
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:29,333
No, I was actually thinking...

1172
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,083
that Rafiki looks pretty handy,
and with the stick...

1173
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:32,625
Zazu, you can use your wings...

1174
01:13:32,792 --> 01:13:34,458
to cover our tracks
as we head up the mountain...

1175
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:36,000
without leaving a trace.

1176
01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:38,083
Hey, you can do this.

1177
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:40,083
Yeah.

1178
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:42,375
Yes, sir. You're right. I've got this.

1179
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:48,458
Okay. It's just me against a frozen mountain.

1180
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:51,292
One hornbill
charged with saving the future...

1181
01:13:51,958 --> 01:13:53,208
Mummy!

1182
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:57,375
Man alive, that's cold.

1183
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:12,917
Now what's happening?

1184
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:15,125
We can't keep stopping.

1185
01:14:15,292 --> 01:14:17,667
Somehow, they have covered their tracks.

1186
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:19,250
In the snow?

1187
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:21,042
It's not possible.

1188
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:23,375
Majesty, they could be anywhere
on this mountain...

1189
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:24,583
Then find them!

1190
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:25,792
Now.

1191
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:27,875
Zazu, Zazu, Zazu

1192
01:14:28,042 --> 01:14:30,042
Zazu, Zazu!

1193
01:14:34,958 --> 01:14:36,208
I have a report.

1194
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:39,167
The Outsiders are completely lost.

1195
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:40,417
Well played, Mufasa.

1196
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:41,750
Great job, Zazu.

1197
01:14:41,917 --> 01:14:42,917
And as per usual.

1198
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:44,333
I knew you could do it.

1199
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,750
We did it. We did it.

1200
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,292
No, you did it.

1201
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:51,208
Great thinking, Mufasa.

1202
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:53,917
We're all rubbing off on each other.
Perfectly normal thing to do.

1203
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:55,792
Who wants to rub against Zazu?

1204
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,500
No one. I'm leaving now.

1205
01:14:57,667 --> 01:14:58,833
I'll scout ahead.

1206
01:15:13,833 --> 01:15:15,333
I got you, Rafiki.

1207
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,708
- Hey.
- I got you.

1208
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:18,125
Ho monate, Mufasa.

1209
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:19,500
Yeah, I got you.

1210
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:25,583
Mufasa...

1211
01:15:27,042 --> 01:15:28,417
"I got you."

1212
01:15:41,292 --> 01:15:45,292
Hidden in the shadows,
downwind, light of foot.

1213
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,958
Interesting hunting style, Mufasa.

1214
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:51,375
We have to eat something
before we take on that descent.

1215
01:15:51,542 --> 01:15:53,667
Unfortunately,
there's nothing to hunt up here.

1216
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:55,000
See under that rock?

1217
01:15:55,167 --> 01:15:57,625
There's a civet about to leave his den.

1218
01:15:58,042 --> 01:16:00,792
Of course you can smell a civet
hidden in the snow.

1219
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:04,042
You, the lion who can do anything.

1220
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:05,958
What's that supposed to mean?

1221
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,750
It means I see you, Mufasa.

1222
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:10,833
I don't know what you're talking about.

1223
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,333
Now, that part, I believe.

1224
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,625
Because, smart as you are...

1225
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:17,583
you have a way of seeing
everything but yourself.

1226
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:19,125
What is this?

1227
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,958
What is this, Sarabi?

1228
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:24,417
There is a civet in the snow
right where you said it would be.

1229
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:26,500
And you smelled the Outsiders
on the wind...

1230
01:16:26,667 --> 01:16:28,958
which means you're the one
who smelled the flowers on my fur.

1231
01:16:29,125 --> 01:16:30,125
It was a lucky guess.

1232
01:16:30,292 --> 01:16:32,500
You can smell the exact flower
from my valley.

1233
01:16:32,667 --> 01:16:34,542
No, that's not possible.

1234
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:36,083
You saved me.

1235
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,708
Held me, covered me in the stampede,
comforted me.

1236
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:39,875
No, it was Taka.

1237
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:42,000
"I got you. I got you, Sarabi."

1238
01:16:42,167 --> 01:16:44,292
- I'm here to protect him.
- That was you.

1239
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:47,542
I was lost in the water, and he found me.
My brother saved me.

1240
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:49,208
I sensed it from the beginning.

1241
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:52,167
- His blood is the blood of the king.
- Mufasa.

1242
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:54,333
- That is his destiny.
- No!

1243
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:56,708
His destiny was to save you.

1244
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:02,250
Now tell me it's you.

1245
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:17,167
Ever since you appeared

1246
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:21,792
I've been running from something
deep inside

1247
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:23,625
And it's worse than I feared

1248
01:17:25,042 --> 01:17:28,292
'Cause I look in your eyes
and I can't hide

1249
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:31,250
- I push you away
- Don't push me away

1250
01:17:31,417 --> 01:17:34,500
But the feelings come back
just twice as strong

1251
01:17:34,667 --> 01:17:37,625
- I don't know what to say
- You know just what to say

1252
01:17:37,792 --> 01:17:40,625
But I know that I'm right where I belong

1253
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:42,708
The way you know just where to be

1254
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:45,917
- I don't know
- The way you move, the way you see

1255
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:49,500
- You see me
- The way you feel when you're with me

1256
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:53,917
- Beside me
- Don't hide from me anymore

1257
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:56,875
Tell me it's you, I know it's you

1258
01:17:57,042 --> 01:17:58,542
What do I say?
Where do I go?

1259
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:00,000
How do I know you feel the same?

1260
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:03,167
Tell me it's you, I know it's you

1261
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:06,125
Quiet and low, letting it go,
letting you know it's in me

1262
01:18:06,542 --> 01:18:08,667
Ev'rywhere that I roam

1263
01:18:09,792 --> 01:18:12,875
I remind myself not to overstay

1264
01:18:13,042 --> 01:18:14,875
Ev'ry time I find home

1265
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:19,292
Something happens to take that home away

1266
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:21,000
But you've seen what I've seen

1267
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:23,333
- I see you
- As you lead with

1268
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,750
A strength that shines right through

1269
01:18:26,042 --> 01:18:28,625
You move like a queen, a true queen

1270
01:18:29,042 --> 01:18:32,417
Don't let anything take me away from you

1271
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:35,042
Tell me it's you, I know it's you

1272
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:36,917
Say it again, say it again

1273
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:38,708
Tell me I'll always be with you

1274
01:18:38,958 --> 01:18:41,667
- Tell me it's you
- I know it's you

1275
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:43,250
Say it again, say it again

1276
01:18:43,417 --> 01:18:44,792
Tell me you're always with me

1277
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:47,500
- The way you know just where to be
- Now I know

1278
01:18:47,667 --> 01:18:50,792
- The way you move, the way you see
- I see you

1279
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:53,292
The love I feel when you're with me

1280
01:18:53,833 --> 01:18:56,833
Beside me, beside me

1281
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,250
Say it again, say it again, say it again

1282
01:18:59,417 --> 01:19:00,875
Tell me the world won't interfere

1283
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:02,458
Say it again, say it again

1284
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:04,083
Tell me the words I wanna hear

1285
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,667
Say it again, say it again

1286
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:09,667
Open your eyes and here we go

1287
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:14,250
I know it's you

1288
01:19:17,375 --> 01:19:21,500
I know it's you

1289
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:53,625
You know I love her, my brother

1290
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:58,917
There's nothing we keep from each other

1291
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:02,042
I saved your life

1292
01:20:02,208 --> 01:20:07,750
This is how you repay me?

1293
01:20:10,042 --> 01:20:12,375
What do I do?
What does it mean?

1294
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:14,792
How do I ever unsee
what I've seen?

1295
01:20:14,958 --> 01:20:17,417
He was my kin
She was my queen

1296
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:19,208
Now it's broken forever and...

1297
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:22,000
"Tell her it's you!
She knows it's you!"

1298
01:20:22,167 --> 01:20:24,333
What did you say to her?
What did you do?

1299
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,833
I'm next in line
She should be mine, ha!

1300
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:28,833
Are the ancestors laughing, I...

1301
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:31,667
What would they say?
Father is gone

1302
01:20:31,833 --> 01:20:34,125
Not before giving me strength to go on

1303
01:20:34,292 --> 01:20:35,625
He never trusted you!

1304
01:20:35,792 --> 01:20:38,667
Did he know
you'd betray me so?

1305
01:20:38,833 --> 01:20:41,167
When you were drowning
I pulled you out

1306
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:43,375
I gave you life
which you lived in my debt!

1307
01:20:43,542 --> 01:20:46,000
Now I'm the one drowning
Tumbling down

1308
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:48,208
Trying to escape what I cannot forget

1309
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:50,667
I have a brother no longer

1310
01:20:50,833 --> 01:20:52,292
It's over and done

1311
01:20:52,792 --> 01:20:56,125
Now all I have is this shame
and this rage that I can't...

1312
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:58,875
Out...

1313
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:27,333
...run

1314
01:21:43,542 --> 01:21:48,333
Deceit is a tool of a great king.

1315
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:10,500
There wasn't much to eat on this mountain...

1316
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:12,167
until now.

1317
01:22:13,292 --> 01:22:16,667
Tell me, how did you cover your tracks
in the snow?

1318
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,292
A bird helped us.

1319
01:22:18,458 --> 01:22:21,208
Lions getting help from a bird?

1320
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:24,083
Just as I will help you.

1321
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:25,833
You will help us?

1322
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,833
You think we need help from a wounded coward?

1323
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,375
I may hold the blood of a king...

1324
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:38,417
but it was Mufasa who killed your son.

1325
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:41,000
It was Mufasa...

1326
01:22:41,167 --> 01:22:43,083
who trapped you up here...

1327
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:46,125
outsmarted you at every turn.

1328
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:50,333
Now I will lead you to him and to Milele.

1329
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:52,542
Milele!

1330
01:22:52,708 --> 01:22:57,292
Milele is nothing but a dream,
a vision sold to cubs.

1331
01:22:58,708 --> 01:23:00,375
Well, tell that to the monkey.

1332
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,125
He leads them to it.

1333
01:23:02,583 --> 01:23:03,708
Look at you.

1334
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:07,083
A pack of starving wolves...

1335
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,375
clinging to the side of a mountain.

1336
01:23:09,542 --> 01:23:11,167
No tracks to follow.

1337
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:15,875
Only one chance at revenge.

1338
01:23:17,042 --> 01:23:18,042
Me!

1339
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:20,833
Revenge...

1340
01:23:22,917 --> 01:23:24,875
What about your father?

1341
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:27,500
Because of Mufasa...

1342
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:29,917
I have no father.

1343
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,792
He did this.

1344
01:23:35,167 --> 01:23:36,292
Yes.

1345
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:38,083
You lost a father...

1346
01:23:38,958 --> 01:23:40,583
and I, a son.

1347
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:43,667
Taka, will you join us?

1348
01:23:45,167 --> 01:23:48,417
Together, we can both have our revenge.

1349
01:23:51,208 --> 01:23:52,958
It will be my pleasure...

1350
01:23:55,292 --> 01:23:56,375
King.

1351
01:24:20,542 --> 01:24:21,542
Taka!

1352
01:24:22,833 --> 01:24:24,208
Taka, where have you been?

1353
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:26,292
Hunting.

1354
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,167
I couldn't find anything...

1355
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:30,458
but I was never as good as you.

1356
01:24:31,292 --> 01:24:32,667
Or my mother.

1357
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:37,208
- There's something I need to tell you.
- No.

1358
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:40,083
There's something I need to tell you.

1359
01:24:40,667 --> 01:24:42,375
I need to thank you.

1360
01:24:42,542 --> 01:24:45,458
You kept your word to Eshe and Obasi.

1361
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:47,708
- Taka...
- You saved me, Mufasa.

1362
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:49,542
And I...

1363
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:54,875
will never forget what you've done,
my brother.

1364
01:24:57,667 --> 01:25:02,125
Guys! I have found a way down
just beyond those near peaks.

1365
01:25:03,583 --> 01:25:05,000
Was it something I said?

1366
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:16,833
Hey, Rafiki?

1367
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,708
Yes.

1368
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:21,375
We are nearing destiny, Mufasa.

1369
01:25:21,542 --> 01:25:24,250
And so, the earth must shake.

1370
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:47,375
Okay, now I am 100 million percent sure
who Taka is.

1371
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:48,500
Just be honest. Is it me?

1372
01:25:48,667 --> 01:25:51,125
In case you missed it,
we're not featured in this.

1373
01:25:51,292 --> 01:25:52,750
I think the civet has more screen time.

1374
01:25:52,917 --> 01:25:55,875
- Hey, maybe they'll put us in the play.
- No, no, please don't mention the play again.

1375
01:25:56,042 --> 01:25:57,125
I went to see it.

1376
01:25:57,292 --> 01:25:58,750
I'm nothing but a giant sock puppet.

1377
01:25:58,917 --> 01:26:00,208
You went to see it?
You didn't bring me?

1378
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:03,250
Rafiki, Mufasa and Sarabi are in love?

1379
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:05,208
Love?

1380
01:26:05,375 --> 01:26:08,542
That sounds gross and not something like
I constantly think about and really want.

1381
01:26:08,708 --> 01:26:10,250
What is Taka gonna do to them?

1382
01:26:10,417 --> 01:26:13,667
Little one, Taka's heart was broken.

1383
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:16,708
And now his trap was set.

1384
01:26:32,542 --> 01:26:34,542
Mufasa. Do you see?

1385
01:26:34,917 --> 01:26:36,458
I don't believe it.

1386
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,708
The other side of the light.

1387
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:40,375
Home.

1388
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:43,042
Milele.

1389
01:27:33,542 --> 01:27:34,542
I can't believe it.

1390
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:38,958
We found it. We found Milele.

1391
01:27:39,125 --> 01:27:40,125
Yes.

1392
01:27:40,917 --> 01:27:45,417
You found it, brother.
You always do.

1393
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:26,292
Rafiki.

1394
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:30,958
This is the tree from your visions.

1395
01:28:33,042 --> 01:28:35,375
I have seen this tree many times...

1396
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:38,833
and, in each vision,
there was always a brother...

1397
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:40,958
standing right here.

1398
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:42,667
But there's no one here, Rafiki...

1399
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:45,625
and you came here to find your twin.

1400
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:48,708
He was taken from me long ago.

1401
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:51,875
What I saw in my dreams was a brother.

1402
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:54,083
Standing right here.

1403
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:56,958
A friend, family.

1404
01:28:57,125 --> 01:28:58,833
What I saw was you.

1405
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,500
The unseeable.

1406
01:29:00,667 --> 01:29:03,125
I saw Mufasa.

1407
01:29:03,292 --> 01:29:04,292
Me?

1408
01:29:04,458 --> 01:29:06,292
Yes, you.

1409
01:29:06,458 --> 01:29:08,042
My brother.

1410
01:29:14,125 --> 01:29:15,167
Mufasa.

1411
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:16,750
How do you know who I am?

1412
01:29:16,917 --> 01:29:20,708
We know the Outsiders are hunting you,
and we fear you'll bring danger.

1413
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:22,875
No. No. We covered our tracks.

1414
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:25,250
I promise you Milele is a safe place...

1415
01:29:25,417 --> 01:29:28,042
and I would never do anything
to jeopardize that.

1416
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:34,000
Do not run.

1417
01:29:34,167 --> 01:29:36,208
You have nothing to fear.

1418
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:38,167
We are not here for you.

1419
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:41,708
We have come for Mufasa.

1420
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:44,167
Oh, no, no. How did they get here?

1421
01:29:45,167 --> 01:29:47,417
Do not let him divide us.

1422
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:56,000
It's no use, Mufasa.
The Circle...

1423
01:29:57,708 --> 01:29:59,833
The Circle is broken.

1424
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:01,042
No!

1425
01:30:01,208 --> 01:30:02,667
Mufasa, what are you doing?

1426
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:06,167
I'm going to fight, and I'm going
to show them that they can fight, too.

1427
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:09,750
Rafiki, when you hear my signal,
help me call them together.

1428
01:30:09,917 --> 01:30:11,208
Yes, my brother.

1429
01:30:13,042 --> 01:30:15,042
There are other lions here.

1430
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:16,333
Find them.

1431
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,583
With pleasure, Your Majesty.

1432
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,667
Mufasa, you're not alone.

1433
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,292
It's my turn to go ask questions first.

1434
01:30:37,958 --> 01:30:40,750
This is where the hunt ends, Mufasa.

1435
01:30:42,542 --> 01:30:44,125
Thanks to your brother.

1436
01:30:44,292 --> 01:30:46,667
He left a trail of scars for us to follow.

1437
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:48,875
He made a deal to save himself.

1438
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:51,792
- Gave us this kingdom.
- Tell me he's lying.

1439
01:30:51,958 --> 01:30:53,500
Asked us to kill the stray.

1440
01:30:53,667 --> 01:30:54,833
Taka, please!

1441
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,042
I'm the son of a king.

1442
01:30:57,625 --> 01:30:59,625
But Sarabi chose you.

1443
01:30:59,792 --> 01:31:01,167
Just like Mother.

1444
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:03,583
Just like my own father.

1445
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06,958
I saved you and you betrayed me!

1446
01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:08,583
What have you done?

1447
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:10,417
I'm your brother, fight with me!

1448
01:31:10,583 --> 01:31:13,208
You stole my destiny.

1449
01:31:13,375 --> 01:31:15,000
Now this is yours.

1450
01:31:16,792 --> 01:31:18,667
He's one of us now.

1451
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:21,000
My son's name...

1452
01:31:21,917 --> 01:31:23,292
was Shaju.

1453
01:31:24,292 --> 01:31:25,833
Shaju!

1454
01:31:26,375 --> 01:31:28,417
All of this should have been his.

1455
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:33,083
And now I will rule it without mercy.

1456
01:31:39,542 --> 01:31:41,833
This one is mine.

1457
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:30,875
Please. We can't wage this battle alone.

1458
01:32:31,042 --> 01:32:32,292
There's nothing we can do.

1459
01:32:32,458 --> 01:32:34,625
They've chased us
from our pride lands before.

1460
01:32:34,792 --> 01:32:36,708
- They're too strong.
- Fight with us.

1461
01:32:36,875 --> 01:32:39,375
Fight for your young.
For your future.

1462
01:32:39,542 --> 01:32:42,167
What future?
They've taken all we have.

1463
01:32:42,333 --> 01:32:44,375
And they will always take more.

1464
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:12,125
I am Mufasa, a stray with no pride...

1465
01:33:12,292 --> 01:33:14,125
and yet I stand before you.

1466
01:33:14,292 --> 01:33:15,333
Head unbowed.

1467
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,708
I know you're afraid, but trust me.

1468
01:33:17,875 --> 01:33:21,875
Nothing will change
if we remain isolated to our own tribes...

1469
01:33:22,042 --> 01:33:24,667
without concern for the fate of others.

1470
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:26,625
But why should we stand with you?

1471
01:33:26,792 --> 01:33:28,542
This is your fight.

1472
01:33:28,833 --> 01:33:31,625
Today, they are here for us lions,
but I assure you...

1473
01:33:31,792 --> 01:33:34,708
as you let them walk among you
in search of us now...

1474
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:37,583
they are plotting to come for you tomorrow.

1475
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:40,792
One lion's hope cannot change
the fate of Milele.

1476
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:44,917
There is no lion as large as an elephant,
as strong as an oxen...

1477
01:33:45,083 --> 01:33:47,542
fast as a cheetah or tall as a giraffe...

1478
01:33:47,708 --> 01:33:50,125
who can soar and scout as wide and far...

1479
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:52,208
as the cranes and hawks in the sky.

1480
01:33:52,417 --> 01:33:54,417
So, can't you see...

1481
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:57,417
Every being has a place
in the Circle of Life.

1482
01:33:57,583 --> 01:33:59,375
My breath is your breath.

1483
01:33:59,542 --> 01:34:01,500
Your fight is my fight.

1484
01:34:01,667 --> 01:34:05,042
I will not bend to evil,
and neither should you.

1485
01:34:14,542 --> 01:34:16,208
Mufasa is right.

1486
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,042
Milele is home.

1487
01:34:18,583 --> 01:34:22,333
We must stand with Mufasa!

1488
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:29,292
Together we shall stand strong for Milele!

1489
01:34:36,667 --> 01:34:38,833
Here comes the lion!

1490
01:34:47,375 --> 01:34:49,542
From this moment on...

1491
01:34:49,708 --> 01:34:54,333
everything the light touches belongs to me.

1492
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:55,958
You'll have to take it.

1493
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:22,875
Bye-bye.

1494
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:32,500
You've messed with the wrong hornbill!

1495
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:36,875
Lunch is served.

1496
01:35:37,333 --> 01:35:40,708
Stand down! I am highly trained
and occasionally a...

1497
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:45,125
This is so embarrassing.

1498
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:49,500
I do have wings, you know.

1499
01:36:07,083 --> 01:36:08,292
Taka!

1500
01:36:09,375 --> 01:36:12,208
Taka, please. Please!

1501
01:36:16,417 --> 01:36:18,583
Mufasa.

1502
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:20,958
Mufasa.

1503
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:18,708
You dare...

1504
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:21,792
to challenge me?

1505
01:37:22,833 --> 01:37:25,167
You took my son.

1506
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:27,792
My future.

1507
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:32,292
Taka, your moment of courage will come.

1508
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,833
Blood for blood.

1509
01:37:47,167 --> 01:37:49,417
Please. Don't kill him.

1510
01:37:49,583 --> 01:37:51,250
I didn't kill him.

1511
01:37:51,417 --> 01:37:52,750
You did.

1512
01:38:21,917 --> 01:38:23,458
They're coming.

1513
01:38:26,042 --> 01:38:28,167
The last lions.

1514
01:38:28,333 --> 01:38:30,042
Time for their extinction...

1515
01:38:30,208 --> 01:38:32,458
and we'll start with the youngest.

1516
01:38:42,417 --> 01:38:45,083
The earth will shake.

1517
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:50,542
Attack!

1518
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:25,625
Mufasa.

1519
01:39:57,625 --> 01:39:59,250
Close your eyes...

1520
01:39:59,417 --> 01:40:01,625
and tell me what you hear.

1521
01:40:01,792 --> 01:40:03,792
What you feel.

1522
01:41:28,042 --> 01:41:29,125
Mufasa!

1523
01:42:08,333 --> 01:42:10,333
He defeated the Outsiders.

1524
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:13,208
- The king of Milele!
- The king of Milele!

1525
01:42:17,375 --> 01:42:19,625
Is that him? Our king?

1526
01:42:26,292 --> 01:42:27,375
Your Highness.

1527
01:42:28,875 --> 01:42:31,042
- The King of Milele.
- The King of Milele.

1528
01:42:31,833 --> 01:42:33,125
The King of Milele.

1529
01:42:38,833 --> 01:42:40,333
- My king.
- Your Highness.

1530
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,125
- Your Majesty.
- My king.

1531
01:42:42,292 --> 01:42:43,458
Defeated Kiros!

1532
01:42:46,875 --> 01:42:48,833
- My king.
- King?

1533
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,708
No, no, I'm not king.

1534
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:53,000
Raise your heads.

1535
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:55,792
No. I'm just... No, no!
No more kings.

1536
01:42:55,958 --> 01:42:58,292
We are all one. Please.

1537
01:42:58,458 --> 01:43:00,583
Please. Raise your heads.

1538
01:43:00,833 --> 01:43:02,792
But, Mufasa...

1539
01:43:02,958 --> 01:43:04,917
you have brought them together.

1540
01:43:05,417 --> 01:43:09,458
You helped them see in themselves
what they considered unseeable.

1541
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:12,583
Nothing is more kingly.

1542
01:43:12,792 --> 01:43:14,833
No, Rafiki.

1543
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,083
I'm not king.
I'm not royal blood.

1544
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:20,042
Don't you see, my brother?

1545
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:22,958
It is not what you were...

1546
01:43:23,167 --> 01:43:26,500
it is what you have become.

1547
01:43:28,208 --> 01:43:31,000
The King of Milele.

1548
01:43:37,958 --> 01:43:39,333
My brother...

1549
01:43:39,792 --> 01:43:42,750
something beautiful awaits you.

1550
01:43:55,208 --> 01:43:56,417
Is this real?

1551
01:43:59,875 --> 01:44:01,083
But it can't be.

1552
01:44:03,792 --> 01:44:05,208
It can't be.

1553
01:44:27,375 --> 01:44:28,583
Mufasa.

1554
01:44:29,333 --> 01:44:31,000
But how can it be?

1555
01:44:31,458 --> 01:44:34,875
I had a son named Mufasa.

1556
01:44:35,083 --> 01:44:37,875
Taken from me by a great flood.

1557
01:44:38,375 --> 01:44:39,375
Mother?

1558
01:44:41,083 --> 01:44:43,208
I never stopped hoping.

1559
01:44:43,375 --> 01:44:45,125
Believing.

1560
01:44:45,292 --> 01:44:46,625
My son.

1561
01:44:49,708 --> 01:44:51,500
I've dreamt of this moment.

1562
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:55,958
And now it's come true.

1563
01:44:56,167 --> 01:44:57,917
Oh, Mufasa.

1564
01:45:03,042 --> 01:45:04,333
But Father?

1565
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:07,458
Where's Father?

1566
01:45:14,042 --> 01:45:16,000
He lives in you now.

1567
01:45:16,917 --> 01:45:19,875
He lives in you.

1568
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,875
I always dreamed we'd be together again.

1569
01:45:30,125 --> 01:45:34,083
And I knew it would be in Milele.

1570
01:45:36,125 --> 01:45:37,250
My son.

1571
01:45:38,417 --> 01:45:39,625
Mufasa.

1572
01:45:46,583 --> 01:45:49,708
Mufasa, please forgive me.

1573
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:53,292
You must banish him, Sire.

1574
01:45:55,125 --> 01:45:57,000
As long as I am king...

1575
01:45:57,167 --> 01:45:59,625
my brother will have a place here.

1576
01:46:01,375 --> 01:46:03,875
Brother, I am so...

1577
01:46:04,042 --> 01:46:05,875
But I won't ever...

1578
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:08,167
say your name again.

1579
01:46:09,542 --> 01:46:10,792
I can't.

1580
01:46:12,042 --> 01:46:13,250
I won't.

1581
01:46:14,083 --> 01:46:15,917
Then call me Scar.

1582
01:46:16,542 --> 01:46:19,792
So I will never forget what I have done.

1583
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:21,875
Scar.

1584
01:46:22,875 --> 01:46:24,583
Your Majesty.

1585
01:46:34,083 --> 01:46:35,542
Welcome home.

1586
01:46:42,833 --> 01:46:44,292
Your Majesty.

1587
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:53,833
So, Mufasa...

1588
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,167
I see your family has been awaiting you
in Milele after all.

1589
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:01,917
Yes, Rafiki.

1590
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:04,542
Yes, they were.

1591
01:47:11,542 --> 01:47:14,417
It is your time, Mufasa.

1592
01:47:15,583 --> 01:47:18,000
Rafiki, I wish I could see him.

1593
01:47:18,458 --> 01:47:20,458
I wish I could meet my grandfather.

1594
01:47:20,625 --> 01:47:23,167
As Mufasa once told your father...

1595
01:47:23,333 --> 01:47:25,417
look into the heavens, Kiara.

1596
01:47:25,583 --> 01:47:29,167
The great kings of the past
will always be there...

1597
01:47:29,958 --> 01:47:31,208
waiting for you.

1598
01:49:19,083 --> 01:49:22,667
I don't want him to go, Rafiki.
I don't want it to end.

1599
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:25,167
Don't you see, Kiara?

1600
01:49:25,542 --> 01:49:28,250
Mufasa lives in you.

1601
01:49:29,125 --> 01:49:31,500
He lives in you.

1602
01:49:34,708 --> 01:49:35,667
Dad!

1603
01:49:37,042 --> 01:49:39,250
- Rafiki.
- It was unbelievable.

1604
01:49:39,417 --> 01:49:41,292
- It was perfect.
- You could not improve on it.

1605
01:49:41,458 --> 01:49:43,000
That said, I do have notes.

1606
01:49:43,167 --> 01:49:45,625
Some suggestions.
Take 'em or leave 'em. But take 'em.

1607
01:49:47,167 --> 01:49:48,875
- Dad!
- Kiara!

1608
01:49:51,833 --> 01:49:53,167
Kiara.

1609
01:49:53,333 --> 01:49:54,333
Dad.

1610
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:56,167
Where's Mom?

1611
01:49:56,333 --> 01:49:58,958
Well, love, there's something
you need to know.

1612
01:49:59,125 --> 01:50:01,333
What? Did something happen to Mom?

1613
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:03,792
Baby, I'm right here, and I'm fine.

1614
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,583
Where were you?

1615
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:06,750
Kiara...

1616
01:50:06,917 --> 01:50:08,917
this is your new brother.

1617
01:50:09,083 --> 01:50:10,167
Brother?

1618
01:50:10,333 --> 01:50:11,583
I have a brother?

1619
01:50:12,542 --> 01:50:15,958
Hi there. I'm Kiara.
I will take care of you.

1620
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:17,917
Forever.

1621
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,292
Little one...

1622
01:50:20,458 --> 01:50:22,208
let me tell you a story.

1623
01:50:22,708 --> 01:50:25,458
A story of a great king.
