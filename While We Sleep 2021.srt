3
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,921
- Daddy! Can I go to the pool?

4
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,257
- Yes, but be careful.

5
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:40,070
Tell me, did she have
previous concussions?

6
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,154
- No.

7
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,197
- No.

8
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,157
- I don’t know.

9
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,577
- Allergic reactions to
medications?

10
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,786
- No.

11
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:54,668
- Well... We can do
a CT scan... if you want.

12
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,749
Whiskey?

13
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,113
Want to tell?

14
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:37,789
- One patient, a girl.
Her CT is the same as...

15
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:39,750
- Will you be able to help her?

16
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,171
- The second shot was normal.

17
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,592
Hmmm... that's it.

18
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,052
How are you?

19
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,012
- My affairs?

20
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,097
Nobody asks the bartender
about his business.

21
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,807
They tell him theirs.

22
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,228
- Cheers.

23
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,760
- Kolya, hey!... I told you!
Hey... what’s this!...

24
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,553
- What’s going on?
This is a mess!

25
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,555
- You... come in ... Sorry!

26
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:11,350
Come on, pick it up!
Well, we have taps.

27
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,602
- Well, and who pays?
It’s from your salary.

28
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:18,315
- What have I got to do with it?
I'm just stuck, that's all.

29
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,863
- You can! Come on! Hey!...
- Ok.

30
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:06,802
- Anton!
- Sorry, we are closed.

31
00:57:08,804 --> 00:57:11,306
Ah, it’s you.

32
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:14,226
- I need a drink.

33
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:18,522
- Can I offer you
something special?

34
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:24,361
Thirty years of whiskey,
cures everything.

35
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:26,613
Soft, fragrant.

36
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:28,198
You’ll like it!

37
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:32,786
At the expense of the
institution.

38
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:40,919
- Will you give me ice?

39
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:42,379
- This one is just clean.

40
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:56,685
Bad day?

41
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:00,397
- Can I have more?

42
01:20:12,437 --> 01:20:15,357
- Come on, come on. Come in.
Come on, be careful.

43
01:20:19,152 --> 01:20:22,406
- Enough, enough,
enough, enough!

44
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,910
Get ready for reanimation!

45
01:20:26,994 --> 01:20:30,205
- No, no, you can't come here.
Wait, please, there.

46
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:34,251
- They will take care of her,
ma'am.

47
01:20:34,334 --> 01:20:36,170
Try to calm down.

48
01:20:36,253 --> 01:20:38,255
Everything will be fine.

49
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,765
One, two!... Three!...

50
01:22:08,095 --> 01:22:09,763
- How are you?

51
01:22:09,847 --> 01:22:12,224
- Some water?
- No!

52
01:25:11,612 --> 01:25:13,614
You can't go there!

53
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,722
- She has a cardiac arrest.

54
01:27:01,805 --> 01:27:03,807
- Prepare a defibrillator.
- Calm down!

55
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:06,894
Warning! Discharge!

56
01:27:13,692 --> 01:27:15,903
- The heart did not start.

57
01:27:16,195 --> 01:27:17,571
- Let's do one more time.

58
01:27:17,654 --> 01:27:20,199
Warning! Discharge!

59
01:27:24,661 --> 01:27:26,830
How much time has passed?

60
01:27:26,914 --> 01:27:28,957
- Thirty seconds.

61
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:31,126
- Raise it.
- Ok.

62
01:27:34,755 --> 01:27:37,591
Discharge!

63
01:27:37,674 --> 01:27:39,384
- We lose her.

64
01:27:42,846 --> 01:27:44,681
You can't come here!
Who are you?

65
01:27:44,765 --> 01:27:46,099
Listen, we are...

66
01:27:57,736 --> 01:27:59,530
- Attention! The heart started!

67
01:27:59,613 --> 01:28:01,406
Get parents out of here.
- Prepare oxygen!

68
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:02,866
Please take off your hands...
- Come on, come on!...

69
01:28:03,116 --> 01:28:04,868
- Attention! Attention!
- Where is the oxygen mask?

70
01:28:04,952 --> 01:28:07,829
- Get away!
- Wait, wait, wait.

71
01:28:08,497 --> 01:28:10,874
- Where's the mask?
- Give me the mask, faster!

72
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:13,627
- The mask!
- Here you go.

73
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:18,590
- All right. It works!

74
01:29:13,687 --> 01:29:15,439
- Now I am free, Mommy.

75
01:29:20,819 --> 01:29:22,529
- Forgive me.

76
01:29:25,532 --> 01:29:26,867
- I love you.

77
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:33,916
- I love you, too, my baby.

78
01:29:37,628 --> 01:29:39,755
I miss you so much.
