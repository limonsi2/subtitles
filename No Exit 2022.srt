00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,458
[Jade] Every day, it was the same.

4
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:49,167
Is there anyone…

5
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:56,333
anyone in my old life
who would still talk to me?

6
00:00:57,417 --> 00:01:00,583
[sniffles] Wouldn't hang up the phone
when I ask for money?

7
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,083
And as soon as I got that money,
it was gone.

8
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:05,958
And then I needed more.

9
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,708
Like that guy in the story.

10
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,250
That guy who keeps pushing
the rock up the hill,

11
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:17,708
and every time he gets to the top,
it rolls straight back down.

12
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,583
Every day, I pushed that rock up the hill,

13
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:26,500
and every day,
it rolled right back down to the bottom.

14
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,333
‐[sighs]
‐[sniffles] But I'm here now,

15
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:33,500
and I know that every day can be
a fresh start if you want it to.

16
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,250
[Bill] Amen, Jade.

17
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,333
‐[applause]
‐Thank you.

18
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:39,458
[patient] Good job.

19
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:40,542
Thank you.

20
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,333
[sighs]

21
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,000
Darby.

22
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:55,250
Darby, it's your turn.

23
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,250
Um, okay. [sighs]

24
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,042
Darby, 11 days.

25
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:11,292
The whole pushing a rock up the hill thing
is very moving.

26
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,500
I remember the first time I heard you
tell that story at the recovery center.

27
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,958
What was that, like, two years ago?

28
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:21,167
[whispers] Fuck you.

29
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,042
Honestly, what are we doing here? [scoffs]

30
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:33,667
Sobriety is a battle. It's a daily battle.

31
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,250
I know, I've tried. Seven times.

32
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,792
The Sobriety Center,
Way Forward Recovery Clinic,

33
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,125
A Better Tomorrow.

34
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,250
NA.

35
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,375
But, hey, it's rehab or jail.

36
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,833
[inhales sharply]
Darby, I've sat where you're sitting.

37
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:56,583
I told myself the same thing,
"Rehab doesn't work."

38
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:57,958
‐But‐‐
‐[Mike] Excuse me.

39
00:02:58,042 --> 00:03:00,500
‐Darby, phone for you.
‐Just a minute, Mike.

40
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,708
They said it's urgent.

41
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,208
Carry on.

42
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,917
[man on PA, indistinct]

43
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:16,792
Hello.

44
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:18,542
It's Joe.

45
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:22,708
Your mom's in the Lakeview Hospital.
She had a brain aneurysm.

46
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:25,125
Doc‐Doctor says there's a lot
of bleeding in her brain,

47
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,875
so they're gonna operate tonight.

48
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,208
I know you haven't talked to anyone
since you left,

49
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:31,917
but you should call your sister.

50
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:34,583
Devon's at the hospital now.

51
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:37,750
I'll give you her number.

52
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:42,333

‐Wait, can you‐‐ Wait.

801‐555‐0148.

54
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,750
‐ You got that?
‐Yeah.

55
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,917
Look, I'm not sure
I should even be calling you

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,625
but I just thought you oughta know.

57
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,167
‐[person] Joe, we need you.
‐ I'm sorry. I gotta go.

58
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,667
Things are crazy here right now.
You should call Devon.

59
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah. I'm, um…

60
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,875
‐ Promise me you'll call her.
‐Yeah, I'm going to now.

61
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,333
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

62
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:07,000
‐Okay, bye.
‐ Bye.

63
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,542
You okay?

64
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,875
‐Darby?
‐Yeah.

65
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,750
[stammering] Yeah, my mom‐‐

66
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,250
I need to make a call.

67
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,417
[phone clicks]

68
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,500
No outgoing calls. You know the rules.

69
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,792
My mom is in the hospital.
I have to call my sister.

70
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,625
Last week you said
your mom was in a car accident.

71
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,208
Last week I was in detox.
Who knows what the fuck I was saying?

72
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:34,458
This is a big thing, Darby.
I have to call Dr. Fletcher.

73
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,875
[Bill] What's going on?

74
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,958
My mom is in the hospital.
He won't let me make a call.

75
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:41,917
Darby, you know the rules.
I have to speak with Dr. Fletcher.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,083
He's your doctor.

77
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,583
Call him.

78
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,583
‐[phone beeps]
‐ Ben Fletcher. Leave a message.

79
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,458
‐Tell him that it's urgent.
‐[Mike] Hey, Dr. Fletcher.

80
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:04,083
It's Mike from the Center. Can you give me
a call when you get this message?

81
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,042
Tell him that it's urgent.

82
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,125
‐It's Friday afternoon. They're‐‐
‐Go fuck your Friday afternoon.

83

Darby.

[footsteps departing]

85
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:24,958
[whispers] Jade.

86
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:28,875
Jade.

87
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,167
‐What?
‐I need to borrow your phone.

88
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,292
[scoffs]

89
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,250
I don't have a phone.

90
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,583
Sarah told me
that you let her call her kids yesterday.

91
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:43,792
[sighs]

92
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:49,042
If you don't give it to me, I'm gonna tell
Dr. Bill his perfect patient has a phone.

93
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,708
And then no one gets to make calls.

94
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:56,333
I'm doing this program at the Center here.

95
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,667
It's actually going really well.

96
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,750
I just‐‐

97
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:08,167
You need to call them
and tell them what's going on,

98
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,667
so I can come and see Mom.

99
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:14,375
[Devon] That's not a good idea.
You should stay where you are.

100
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,875
You call them. It'll be fine.

101
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,583
Jesus, Darby.
I'm not bailing you out of rehab.

102
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:23,000
I've got enough problems
with Mom in the hospital.

103
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:26,625
Fuck. I told Joe not to look for you.

104
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,292
No one has time
for your bullshit right now.

105
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,292
‐ Mom could die.
‐Devon.

106
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,125

[nurse 2] Hey, Mikey,
can you give me a hand with Susan?

114
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,708
[Mike] What's the problem?

115
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,208
[nurse 2] She said she had a nightmare.

116
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,583
Now she won't get back in bed.
Roaming the halls.

Interstate's closed too.

My mom is in the hospital.
I have to get to Salt Lake City.

[officer] No one's getting through
until the storm passes.

156
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:35,917
You got two choices.

157
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,750
You can either head back down,

158
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,750
or I opened up the Visitors' Center
for some folks.

159
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:43,000
It's a few hundred yards up the road.
You can wait it out there.

160
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,208
Ma'am, you need to decide now.

161
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:51,292

Promise me you won't drive on.
You won't get through.

[Sandi] You heard what that cop said.
We can always head back out the mountain.

176
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:39,583
[Ed] I can't believe…

177
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:42,583
Anyway, you go back down,
you'll change your mind.

178
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,083
[sighs]

179
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:59,542
[wind whistling]

180
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,250
[rattling]

181
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,167
Anybody in there?

182
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,542
[breathing shakily]

183
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,208
[exhales sharply]

184
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,458
[snoring]

185
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,167
Do you have the Wi‐Fi?

186
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,000
Excuse me.

187
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,542
Mm‐mmm. No, there's no Wi‐Fi.

188
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,833
[door opens]

189
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,625
Storm's on top of us now.

190
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,375
[Sandi] Well?

191
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,750
I got one bar by the tree
for about ten seconds.

192
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
[Sandi] Which tree?

193
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,042
Muir Tree.
The tree in the middle of the lot.

194
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,125
[muffled screaming]

195
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,625
[screaming continues]

196
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:28,250
[thud]

197
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:36,292
[screaming intensifies]

198
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,167
[muffled shrieking]

199
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,250
[gasps]

200
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,000
[muffled sobbing, whimpering]

201
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,708
[grunting]

202
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,167
[screaming continues]

203
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,125
I'm here. I'm here.

204
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:42,167
Fuck.

205
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:48,375
I'm gonna get you out, okay?
I promise, okay?

206
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,500
[whimpering]

207
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,583
Come on, come on.

208
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:28,875
[phone beeping]

209
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,000
Shit.

210
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,125
[panting]

211
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,083
Leaving already?

212
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,583
No, I‐I forgot something in my car.

213
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:12,708
Yeah, you were out here so long,
I thought maybe you got some service.

214
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:13,875
No, nothing.

215
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:43,958
[Sandi] Hey.

216
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:45,958
Hey, are you okay?

217
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,250
Yeah.

218
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,375
Why don't you come on over here
and sit down?

219
00:21:55,125 --> 00:22:00,125
Make yourself comfortable.
We are here till the storm clears.

220
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,167
And then some.

221
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,833
So what's your name?

222
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:05,333
Darby.

223
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:07,042
I'm Sandi.

224
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,250
Ed.

225
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,083
[Sandi] And what's your name, son?

226
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:19,500
[whistles]

227
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,708
What's your name?

228
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:27,833
Lars.

229
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:29,417
[snoring]

230
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,792
[clears throat, sniffs]

231
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:35,167
Was I snoring?

232
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,125
I was snoring, wasn't I? Yeah.

233
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,292
Place sure filled up.

234
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:46,250
[Sandi] And what about you?
What's your name?

235
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,042
Oh. I'm Ash.

236
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:52,708
Sandi, Ed, Darby and Lars.

237
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:53,917
Anybody wanna play?

238
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,292
You can't wait?

239
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,417
We're stuck here.

240
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:01,333
Seven Card Stud. Quarter a hand?

241
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:03,375
I don't gamble.

242
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:04,667
That's smart.

243
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,333
What about you, Ash?

244
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:10,458
Oh, I'm not too good at poker.

245
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:11,833
Perfect.

246
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,333
[chuckles]

247
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,167
Wanna play?

248
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,708
Got a lot of time.

249
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:20,167
I got a game everyone could play.

250
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:22,042
What's that?

251
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,375
Bullshit.

252
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:25,958
Bullshit?

253
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:27,667
Yeah, Bullshit.

254
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:30,000
It's the best game.

255
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:34,292
[Ed] Okay. I'll try anything once.

256
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,250
‐Really?
‐[Ed] Yeah, come on.

257
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,542
[Lars] Okay.

258
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:57,833
‐Sandi. You in?
‐Fine.

259
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:00,250
But aren't you scared you're gonna lose?

260
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,500
You know I can
see right through your bullshit.

261
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,792
‐Oh!
‐Your game, your deal, Mr. Bullshit.

262
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,125
How do we play this thing?

263
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:09,583
[Lars] Well, it's pretty simple.

264
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:13,417
I divide the cards evenly
between everyone,

265
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,583
then the person to the left of the dealer
puts a card facedown on the table.

266
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,875
They say what it is, but none of us
can see it 'cause it's facedown.

267
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,458
The next person's gotta put a card
down on top of that,

268
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:28,208
that's either the same value,
one higher or one lower.

269
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:29,667
Suits don't matter.

270
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,958
So, if I put down a two, the next person's
gotta put down a two, a three or an ace.

271
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:36,167
And all the cards are always facedown,

272
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,667
so we either gotta
take each other's word for it,

273
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,375
or if you think someone's lying,

274
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:42,792
you call, "Bullshit!"

275
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:45,792
[Ed] Then what?

276
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:47,750
That depends.

277
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:51,333
Um, if you call bullshit, the person's
gotta show the card they put down.

278
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:54,000
If they were lying, they gotta pick up
all the cards on the table.

279
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,292
But if they weren't lying,

280
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:58,083
the person who called bullshit
has to pick up all the cards.

281
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:01,708
First person
to get rid of all their cards wins.

282
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,375
Ten cards each leaves two in the middle.
Facedown.

283
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:08,750
Sure we don't wanna make this interesting?

284
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:11,750
Well, it's a friendly game.
Let's keep it that way.

285
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,500
Left of the dealer goes first.

286
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:19,917
Jack. So, where's everyone from?

287
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:22,958
Jack.

288
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:26,750
Um, Lower Haight.
It's right next to San Fran.

289
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,500
San Jose. Jack.

290
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:29,875
Jack.

291
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,958
Oh, four in a row to start a game?

292
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:35,500
‐[Ed] They got a name for that?
‐Yeah, bullshitter's row.

293
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,875
That's not a thing.

294
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,375
Queen.

295
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,667
‐Jack.
‐Bullshit! Jacks are out.

296
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,958
‐Ooh!
‐[Ed] Hmm.

297
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:52,292
If you had two Jacks,
you should've put them both down.

298
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,333
I just did.

299
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:55,625
But the same time.

300
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,208
[Ed] Hmm. Is that the rule?

301
00:25:57,292 --> 00:25:58,833
No, doesn't‐‐ [scoffs]

302
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:01,333
No, you don't‐‐ I guess you don't have to.

303
00:26:01,417 --> 00:26:02,417
[chuckles]

304
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:04,500
It's your turn.

305
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:08,708
Six.

306
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,083
‐Seven.
‐Two eights.

307
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:16,708
So, Lars, you didn't say where‐‐
Where are you from?

308
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:18,917
Battle Mountain.

309
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:20,458
Where is that?

310
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,167
[clears throat] Two nines.

311
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,125
‐Bullshit.
‐Goddamn it.

312
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,167
You cleared your throat.

313
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,083
Everybody's got a tell.

314
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,542
Trick is, play the man, not the hand.

315
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,250
Everybody's got a tell, huh? What's yours?

316
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:37,708
[chuckles] You're gonna have to
figure that one out for yourself.

317
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:38,917
[chuckles]

318
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:43,917
Two sixes.

319
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,875
Where you from?

320
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:48,875
Sacramento.

321
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:52,417
Five. So you're a big poker guy, huh?

322
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,042
Four. Guilty. Picked it up in the service.

323
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,125
Two fives.

324
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,417
‐[Lars] Four.
‐You're in the army?

325
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,583
Marines. 22nd MEU.

326
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:03,542
My dad was a marine.

327
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:05,958
[Ed] Yeah? Where'd he serve?

328
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,958
Uh, Third Battalion, First Marines.

329
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:10,667
Fallujah?

330
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,625
Yeah.

331
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:14,833
Some hard fighting.

332
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:17,458
Were you there?

333
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:21,000
No. I stopped after Desert Storm.

334
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:26,125
Well, thank you for your service, really.
And your dad too.

335
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:29,042
Okay, everyone always says that,

336
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:32,458
and it sounds about as empty
as "thoughts and prayers."

337
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:33,542
[Ed] Babe.

338
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,750
Look, nobody knows
what you sacrificed, Ed.

339
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:38,750
‐It's okay.
‐I didn't mean to offend.

340
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:41,583
‐I'm sorry. I‐‐ Really.
‐[Ed] No offense taken.

341
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:44,375
[sighs]

342
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:45,542
Did you ever kill anyone?

343
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,000
Jesus.

344
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,292
What?

345
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:52,875
I lost count.

346
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:57,458
Just kidding.

347
00:27:58,208 --> 00:27:59,208
[exhales]

348
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,250
‐[chuckles]
‐[Lars] Whoa.

349
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,875
[Ed] Your turn, Darby.

350
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,583
Three. So, where's everyone headed?

351
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,292
Two twos.

352
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:13,792
Ah, Reno.

353
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:18,292
Yeah, Sandi here surprised me with
a little vacation to my favorite city.

354
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,792
Reno's your favorite city?

355
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:24,333
Yeah, all the action of Vegas,
half the noise.

356
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:26,542
[chuckles]

357
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:28,792
Ace.

358
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,000
Ace. And you, Darby?

359
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:32,833
‐[Lars] Two twos.
‐Uh.

360
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:33,958
Three. Salt Lake.

361
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:36,333
Four. What's in Salt Lake?

362
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:38,958
My mom's in the hospital.

363
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:40,792
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

364
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,458
[Ed] Sandi's a nurse.

365
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:44,917
[Sandi] Was a nurse.

366
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,750
‐Two fives.
‐Bullshit. [smacks lips]

367
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:50,583
Goddamn it.

368
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,417
[laughing]

369
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
[Sandi] Told ya.

370
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:55,833
I go through Salt Lake on my way home.

371
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:57,833
Where's home?

372
00:28:57,917 --> 00:28:59,958
My parents live in Johnstown, near Denver.

373
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:02,042
[Sandi] Hmm, that's a long drive.

374
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,042
Queen.

375
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:05,958
[clears throat] King.

376
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,875
‐Bullshit.
‐Bullshit.

377
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,542
Nine. Um, Lars, so where you headed?

378
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,708
Uh…

379
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:19,208
‐I'm headed home.
‐[Ash] Ten.

380
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:22,125
Battle Mountain?

381
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:25,208
Yeah. Yes, middle of Nevada.

382
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:37,667
[Ash] Ed, are you gonna play or what?

383
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,750
[Ed] Two nines.

384
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,792
Three tens.

385
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:44,833
Damn.

386
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,167
Bullshit.

387
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,250
Mm‐mmm.

388
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,625
[Ed] Ooh.

389
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:51,917
Screwed in your own game.
That's a bad beat.

390
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:53,750
Fuck that!

391
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,750
‐Whoa. Hey, buddy.
‐[Ed] Hey, hey.

392
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:56,917
Relax.

393
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,583
‐[Ed] We playing 52 Pickup now?
‐[Lars scoffs]

394
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,833
That's not‐‐ Don't‐‐
That's not funny. Don't‐‐

395
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,333
Don't‐‐ Don't make fun of me.

396
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:06,375
No one's laughing.

397
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:09,083
Yeah, I'm sorry. I‐‐

398
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:13,500
Ugh, sometimes I just‐‐ Sorry. Sorry.

399
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:14,792
Shit.

400
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,833
‐[Ash] You need a hand with that?
‐No.

401
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:18,500
[Ed] You need to relax, young man.

402
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,958
[phone beeping]

403
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:58,125
[chimes]

404
00:30:58,208 --> 00:30:59,375
[groans]

405
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,208
[wind whistling]

406
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
[muffled whimpering]

407
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,458
[Darby] Oh!

408
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:29,000
We're getting out of here.

409
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,417
‐Okay? I've just got to cut you free.
‐Mm‐hmm.

410
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,083
Are you sick?

411
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:37,167
Mm‐hmm.

412
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:50,292
"That's a bad beat, huh?
Fifty‐two Pickup, huh?"

413
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:53,958
That's funny. That's real funny, huh?

414
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:56,000
I'll put a bullet
in your fuckin' brain funny!

415
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:57,375
How about that, huh?

416
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,167
[muffled crying]

417
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:02,167
Oh, sorry, Jay.

418
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,250
[sighs]

419
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:08,542
Sometimes people‐‐

420
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:13,125
You're lucky you're out here, Jay.
That place is full of liars and cheats.

421
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:17,083
I just came to warm it up for you.

422
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,417
[engine starts]

423
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,083
Where's he going?

424
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:29,875
Sore Loser‐ville.

425
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,417
Good thing he doesn't gamble.

426
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,208
[Ed] Oh, it's gonna be a long night.

427
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:41,042
Yeah. That's better, huh?

428
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:42,667
[chuckles]

429
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,875
Feeling better?

430
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:47,792
You don't look so great.

431
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:54,083
What the hell?

432
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:55,250
Oh, shit.

433
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,042
You do that?
Don't touch the cardboard, okay?

434
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:07,542
[muffled crying]

435
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,333
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

436
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,792
I know this is the scary part,
but you're gonna be all right.

437
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,583
You're gonna be more than all right.

438
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:18,208
Just gotta hang in there, Jay. All right?

439
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:21,208
It'll get much better when we get
to Uncle Kenny's. Trust me.

440
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:28,000
Shit! I was gonna bring you a snack.

441
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,375
You like snacks?

442
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:31,083
Brb.

443
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:35,583
Shit.

444
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:49,042
[breathing heavily]

445
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:52,458
I can't be here when he comes back.

446
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:53,875
There's not much time.

447
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,250
Listen. Listen.

448
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:57,375
Your name's Jay, right?

449
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:58,917
[whimpering] Mm‐hmm.

450
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,333
My name's Darby,
and I need to go get help.

451
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:05,917
I'll come back.
I promise I will. I promise.

452
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:25,333
Party in the van?

453
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:32,125
I left my phone out there.

454
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,000
Uh‐huh.

455
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,667
I'll be back as soon as I can.

456
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,750
[muffled whimpering]

457
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:06,708
"Party in the van." Are you serious?

458
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,833
Shit.

459
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,250
[muffled crying]

460
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:52,625
Hello?

461
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:54,708
[knocks]

462
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:56,708
Darby?

463
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,625
Everything okay in there?

464
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:03,083
Look, if you need someone to talk to
about your mom, I'm here.

465
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:05,417
[whispering] Get in here. Get in here.

466
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:09,333
‐What? Yeah, what's going on?
‐Just please‐‐

467
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:23,375
Okay.

468
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,542
What the‐‐ What the hell is going on?

469
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,667
He has a little girl tied up in his van.

470
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,208
Mr. Bullshit?

471
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,292
‐Are you sure?
‐Yes.

472
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:43,208
She's little, like, nine or ten.

473
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:44,833
I knew he was a fucking creep.

474
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,250
‐We need to call the cops.
‐I tried. I tried. No service.

475
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,292
Shit. No.

476
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:52,458
What do we do?

477
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,667
I don't know. I don't know.
I hoped maybe you or Ed‐‐

478
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,000
Okay. Maybe we can wait until
there's a break in the storm,

479
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,625
‐and then we can call cops.
‐No, it's gonna take too long.

480
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:05,875
He's not gonna be able to go anywhere.
There's a blizzard. He can't drive any‐‐

481
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,958
No, no, no. She's‐‐

482
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:11,583
She's sick or something.
She could die out there.

483
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:14,208
‐We gotta go get her.
‐Yeah.

484
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,125
But he's probably just waiting out there.

485
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,875
I think he knows that I was in the van.
That's why he came in here.

486
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:25,750
If he suspects you,
then he will follow you out, right?

487
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:27,417
Mm‐hmm.

488
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,375
Okay, so if you go outside,

489
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:33,542
he follows you out just long enough
for me to tell Ed.

490
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:35,958
And then the both of us
will follow you straight out.

491
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:37,042
He has a gun.

492
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:42,292
Look. Maybe Ed has a gun. He's a marine.

493
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:45,500
All right. You're gonna be okay.
You're not gonna be out there by yourself.

494
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,208
What if Ed doesn't have a gun?

495
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:53,292
Then we have to find something here.

496
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,875
[clattering]

497
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,333
Okay.

498
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:15,958
So, where is Reno?

499
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:18,208
Well, it's not on this map.

500
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:22,000
Forty miles north of Lake Tahoe.

501
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:27,375
[Sandi] I bet it'll still be there
when the storm clears.

502
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:33,500
[Ed] I'm sorry we're stuck here.

503
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:36,250
It's, uh... It's not your fault.

504
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,292
[Ed]
I was the one that said we should stay.

505
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:50,542
I know it hasn't been easy lately.

506
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:54,375
[Sandi] Maybe the universe is telling us
we need to spend more time together.

507
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,750
I have to pull it off.
Okay, like a Band‐Aid.

508
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,250
‐One, two‐‐
‐[Jay whimpering]

509
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,250
[screams]

510
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:04,125
[sobbing]

511
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:06,458
Fuck. It's okay.

512
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:10,667
It's okay. We're getting you
out of here right now, okay?

513
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,792
But where are the men?

514
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:16,375
Men?

515
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:19,708
The ones who took me. [sobbing]

516
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:25,167
How many men were there?

517
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,625
How many men?

518
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,375
Two.

519
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,667
[Jay whimpering] What's wrong?

520
00:40:34,208 --> 00:40:37,000
‐She's in the van.
‐Yeah, no shit, she's in the van.

521
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:56,708
‐Why would you bring up Battle Mountain?
‐I'm not good at making things up.

522
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:59,708
Then stay quiet. Listen, and that's it.
Stay fucking quiet.

523
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:01,375
Now we gotta do damage control.

524
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:03,917
Give me the gun.

525
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:10,958
‐What's this?
‐Careful.

526
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:13,250
I rigged the safety
so it fires like a real gun.

527
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:18,083
‐We were gonna ambush you.
‐[panting]

528
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:20,708
Let's go.

529
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:24,458
What're we gonna do? Ash?

530
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,500
Keys.

531
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:34,125
[sobbing]

532
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,208
Where the fuck is she?

533
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:39,833
[Sandi] Did you see anything?

534
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:40,917
No.

535
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,625
‐I'm going out there.
‐[Sandi] Ed. Ed.

536
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,583
Just relax.

537
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:59,167
[panting]

538
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:03,167
‐[clattering]
‐[gasps]

539
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:07,375
Keep fucking quiet.

540
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:10,833
[panting] Fuck.

541
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:12,083
[grunts]

542
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,083
‐Go around.
‐[panting]

543
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:32,833
Whew!

544
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:37,292
‐Everything okay?
‐Yeah, it's, uh... It's all good.

545
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:05,208
[panting]

546
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:26,625
[whispers] I don't like that guy.

547
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,500
Ed, you don't know that guy.

548
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:32,500
I've known plenty of "that guy."

549
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,750
Weird little white boys
with a chip on their shoulder.

550
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:37,833
Give me your phone.

551
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:53,833
You text anyone else about this?

552
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:56,667
No.

553
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:57,750
[Ash] Let's see.

554
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,833
Who sent these? Hmm?

555
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:05,583
My sister.

556
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:08,083
And she's expecting you at the hospital?

557
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:11,375
Mm‐hmm.

558
00:44:12,042 --> 00:44:13,792
And why would she write that?

559
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,833
She doesn't want you there
and, apparently, neither does your mom.

560
00:44:16,917 --> 00:44:17,917
Why do you care?

561
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,250
I need to know who's messing up my life
right now.

562
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:21,333
Hey!

563
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:26,917
Where's Darby?

564
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,167
Darby?

565
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,583
Yeah. Darby.

566
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:34,708
I don't know.

567
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:43,250
Ugh. Uh…

568
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:48,500
[clears throat] I think she's outside
trying to find bars.

569
00:44:49,292 --> 00:44:50,292
Darby's outside?

570
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:52,958
Yeah.

571
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,250
I'll be back in a minute.

572
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:10,875
[Ash] So your mom kicked you out of home,
huh?

573
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,500
Why'd she kick you out?

574
00:45:13,917 --> 00:45:15,125
Lots of reasons.

575
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,500
Yeah? What did you do?

576
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:21,625
Drugs.

577
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,750
What kind of drugs?

578
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,292
Whatever I could get.

579
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,875
Bet your dad loved that, huh?

580
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:36,167
Big‐time war hero with a junkie daughter.

581
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:39,500
He's dead.

582
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:41,083
What, he die in the war?

583
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:51,167
He shot himself in the head.

584
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,167
Like this?

585
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:56,375
[gulps]

586
00:45:57,625 --> 00:45:58,792
No.

587
00:45:58,875 --> 00:45:59,917
Was it like this?

588
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:05,583
‐[stammers] Um…
‐Well, then, it must've been like this.

589
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:08,458
No?

590
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,167
[whimpers]

591
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:13,458
[gasps]

592
00:46:14,542 --> 00:46:16,042
[sighs, sniffles]

593
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:23,125
[grunts]

594
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:44,333
[sighs]

595
00:46:44,417 --> 00:46:48,833
First, the kid got sick,
then there's a storm, and now you.

596
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,458
‐A junkie.
‐You don't know me!

597
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,917
I know exactly who you are.

598
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
At least I'm not a child molester.

599
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:57,042
I'm not a fucking child molester.

600
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,000
This is about money.

601
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,500
You should see the house
that little girl lives in.

602
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:04,292
Her dad's some tech big shot.

603
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:08,042
So he's gonna pay and then we're gonna
ship her back without a fucking scratch.

604
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,125
She's sick.

605
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:11,833
‐She needs a doctor.
‐Yeah, no shit.

606
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,292
She's got Addison's.

607
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,875
If she gets too excited,
she'll OD on adrenaline.

608
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:22,208
So your little intervention
didn't do her any favors.

609
00:47:22,292 --> 00:47:24,292
[wind whistling]

610
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:32,125
‐[breathing shakily]
‐[ripping]

611
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:33,667
[door rattling]

612
00:47:54,542 --> 00:47:55,542
[sighs]

613
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:57,250
[Ash] So, here's what's gonna happen.

614
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,958
‐We're gonna walk out‐‐
‐[knocking]

615
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:03,292
[kissing]

616
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:05,667
[Ash clears throat]

617
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,792
Hi, uh, think I could talk to Darby
for a moment, please?

618
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:11,292
Sure.

619
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:13,125
I'll see you outside.

620
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,458
[kisses]

621
00:48:14,542 --> 00:48:17,125
[whispering] Fuck this up,
I'll kill everyone.

622
00:48:25,292 --> 00:48:27,333
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

623
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:32,042
We're just‐‐ We're stuck here. So…

624
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:34,458
Mmm.

625
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,667
You know,
if there's anything else that you, um…

626
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,083
I can handle it.

627
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:47,167
[Sandi] Darby.

628
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:55,542
‐Lars was spying on us earlier.
‐Oh.

629
00:48:55,625 --> 00:49:01,875
So I wanted to talk to Ash alone
without him following me.

630
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:02,958
[Sandi] Mmm.

631
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:06,250
Okay.

632
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:09,833
'Cause if there is something
that's really wrong

633
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:14,833
and you need to tell me anything,
you will, right?

634
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:24,792
Do you know anything
about brain aneurysms?

635
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:28,750
Uh, is that why your mom's
in the hospital?

636
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:31,583
Is she gonna die?

637
00:49:33,042 --> 00:49:36,375
If she's in the hospital,
she's in the best place she can be, right?

638
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:59,458
Darby, wanna join us?

639
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:01,458
Please?

640
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,333
[sighs]

641
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:16,583
You said your dad was Third Battalion,
First Marines?

642
00:50:17,292 --> 00:50:18,792
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐[Ed] Hmm.

643
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:20,542
What'd he do?

644
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:23,083
He was a gunner.

645
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:27,125
How 'bout that. So was I.

646
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:29,958
‐I bet we could swap some stories.
‐[sighs]

647
00:50:31,917 --> 00:50:37,667
What you said earlier about me not knowing
what they go through, you were right.

648
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:42,000
Darby, she told me what her dad did

649
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,333
when he got home.

650
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:49,417
It's a tragedy.

651
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,083
I mean,
someone taking their own life like that…

652
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:56,500
I can't imagine that kind of pain.

653
00:51:07,042 --> 00:51:08,542
Sorry about your dad.

654
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:14,208
That wasn't your goddamn story to share.

655
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:18,542
You might wanna think harder
before you open your damn mouth.

656
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,792
Jesus.

657
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:30,042
Well… [clears throat]

658
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:48,292
[footsteps departing]

659
00:51:50,792 --> 00:51:52,458
I should go apologize.

660
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:54,167
Yeah, you should.

661
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:04,792
[Ash grunts]

662
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:07,417
[both grunting]

663
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,708
‐No!
‐[groans]

664
00:52:13,792 --> 00:52:15,792
[whimpering, screaming]

665
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:21,667
All you had to do was nothing.

666
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:29,167
‐[Lars] Ash?
‐[panting]

667
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,625
‐[chokes, coughs]
‐What are you doing?

668
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:33,625
Where's the girl?

669
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:36,542
She went up a hiking trail.
Uncle Kenny's gonna be so pissed.

670
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:39,500
Uncle Kenny's not gonna find out.
We're gonna go get her right now.

671
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:41,042
She's not gonna come to us.

672
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:43,458
‐[Darby coughing]
‐Doesn't matter how cold she is.

673
00:52:43,542 --> 00:52:45,000
[Ash] Maybe not.

674
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:47,875
But she'll come to her.

675
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,625
‐Get up.
‐[Lars] Come on.

676
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:54,542
‐Quick, she's gonna freeze to death.
‐[Ash] Get up.

677
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:55,750
‐[Lars] Hurry!
‐[Ash] Don't worry.

678
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:57,708
‐We're gonna find her, all right?
‐Okay.

679
00:52:57,792 --> 00:53:00,042
‐She won't get far.
‐[Lars] Yeah.

680
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:07,625
I'm cold.

681
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:09,875
It's really cold.

682
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,542
‐Should've worn something warmer.
‐[Darby shivering]

683
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:17,833
We just gotta keep pushing, all right?
We're almost out of here.

684
00:53:17,917 --> 00:53:20,958
When we get to Uncle Kenny's
we're gonna look back at this and laugh.

685
00:53:21,042 --> 00:53:23,708
[Lars] Yeah.
We're not gonna tell him anything, though.

686
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:28,000
Remember what happened last time?
He went nuts.

687
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,083
[Ash] Yeah.

688
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:30,167
[Lars] He was so pissed.

689
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:31,875
Who's Uncle Kenny?

690
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,458
[Lars] He's our foster dad.
Took us in when no one else would.

691
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:37,375
[Ash] Better than blood.

692
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:38,458
[Lars] That's right.

693
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:44,833
What's Uncle Kenny think
about your line of work?

694
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:46,542
[Lars] We work for him.

695
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:49,000
He finds them better homes.

696
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:52,208
Call out for her.

697
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:54,458
Do it.

698
00:53:55,417 --> 00:53:56,542
[Darby] Jay?

699
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:58,625
[Lars muttering]

700
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:00,792
Jay.

701
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:02,625
Louder.

702
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:06,417
She dies out here, it's your fault.

703
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:08,042
[Darby] Jay!

704
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,667
[Ash] Louder.

705
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,125
[Lars muttering]

706
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:17,625
[Ash] Louder, so she can hear it.

707
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:19,792
Jay!

708
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:23,167
‐[Lars] I told you she wasn't gonna go‐‐

‐That was a gunshot.
‐Hmm.

714
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:37,917
[stammering] Are you sure?

715
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,708
There's only one thing
that sounds like a gunshot.

716
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:41,750
Ed.

‐[Sandi] Is she alive?
‐Yes, she's alive. She's in a bad way.

723
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:27,375
‐Shot? Oh!
‐[Ed] No.

724
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:28,458

Hey.

731
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:06,958
Oh, God. Ed, she's freezing.
Give me your coat.

732
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:09,250
Where the hell did she come from?

733
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:10,458
Come on, honey.

734
00:57:13,042 --> 00:57:14,500
Shh. Come on.

735
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:17,000
‐What's this?
‐[Sandi] It's a medical alert bracelet.

736
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:20,667
She's in an adrenal crisis.

737
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,750
‐You got her. [sighs]
‐You know this girl?

738
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:41,292
Ash and Lars kidnapped her.
She was in their van.

739
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,375
[Sandi] What?

740
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,042
Ash has a gun. He's gonna kill us all

[panting] We have to go now.

744
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:56,583
Ed, she's right.
We need to‐‐ We need to move.

745
00:57:56,667 --> 00:57:57,958
Come on, honey.

746
00:57:58,042 --> 00:57:59,667
‐What do we do‐‐
‐Lars! Give me a minute!

747
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,250
‐Yeah, yeah. All right.
‐All right?

748
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:07,250
Hey! Give us the girl
and no one gets hurt.

749
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,458
They're gonna kill us.

750
00:58:12,917 --> 00:58:14,792
Don't make me come in there and get her.

751
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:16,625
[Sandi] That's not gonna stop them.

752
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:18,208
[Ed] I'm buying us time.

753
00:58:18,292 --> 00:58:19,792
[Ash] What are we doing here?

754
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:28,958
‐You ready?
‐Yeah.

755
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:31,625
Okay. I got Ed, you cover the other two.

756
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:32,833
‐Okay.
‐Okay?

[hammer cocks]

758
00:58:34,792 --> 00:58:35,833
Here they come.

759
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,417
You walk through that door,
I will shoot you dead.

I don't know.

764
00:58:55,708 --> 00:58:56,708
Ed!

765
00:58:57,833 --> 00:59:00,000
I think I'm gonna call bullshit on that.

766
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:02,708
Okay. Come on in.

767
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,042
[Ash] Fuck!

768
00:59:08,708 --> 00:59:09,708
Is it working?

769
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:15,542
They're talking.

770
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:20,292
Good. Let them talk all they want.
Out there.

771
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:24,250
We gotta get her out of there.

772
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:27,667
‐No shit, Lars.
‐She probably needs her medication.

773
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:34,167
You're a goddamn genius, Lars.
You're a goddamn genius!

774
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:38,042
The girl is sick.

775
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:43,125
She needs her meds, and we have them, Ed.

776
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:45,750
Huh? We have them!

777
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:49,208
Sandi, you're the nurse.

778
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:52,667
You know it's true.
You keep her, she dies.

779
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:55,458
It's your choice.

780
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:57,875
He's right.

781
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:03,292
You give her to us, we'll be gone.
It's that simple.

782
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:05,333
I say we do it.

783
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:06,875
‐[Ed] No!
‐No!

784
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:11,667
If this girl does not get her medication,
she will die. Let them take her.

785
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:14,333
They can't leave. I have their keys.

786
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:16,458
What?

787
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:20,375
No. You have to give them back.
We want them to leave. They have to leave.

788
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:22,042
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

789
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:24,708
Hey, Ash?

790
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:26,542
Yeah?

791
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:29,333
Give us the medicine,
and we'll let you leave.

792
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,208
Are you serious?

793
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:35,875
Yeah. Give us the medicine,
and we'll give you the keys to your van.

794
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:44,917
[Lars] Ash?

795
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:48,375
Ash!

796
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:53,125
Medicine for the keys.

797
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:04,167
Are they doing it?

798
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:08,625
[Darby] They're walking back to the van.

[sighs]

800
01:01:21,417 --> 01:01:24,542
[Sandi] Can you see anything?
Do they have the medicine?

801
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:25,875
No. They have a gas can.

802
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:27,542
What? No, no.

803
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:30,000
‐Shit.
‐What the fuck do we do now?

804
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:32,333
They're bluffing.
They're not crazy enough to do it.

805
01:01:32,417 --> 01:01:34,833
‐I think maybe they are.
‐Just give them what they want.

806
01:01:34,917 --> 01:01:36,125
If we do that, we're dead.

807
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:37,542
You don't know that.

808
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:40,292
Wait, wait, wait.

809
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:43,125
They can't kill us if they can't leave,
right?

810
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:46,500
Hide the keys. These too.

811
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,375
Go ahead.

812
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:52,875
[Ash] Ed!

813
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,625
Hey, Ed!

814
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:04,167
Ed.

815
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:08,042
We should just give them what they want.

816
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:09,625
We've been in holes before.

817
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:13,750
And we're gonna claw ourselves out
of this one the way we always do.

818
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:16,708
But this isn't a hole. This is a grave.

819
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:18,417
Splash it everywhere. Let's go.

820
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:22,375
So what's your plan, Ash?

821
01:02:23,292 --> 01:02:25,750
What does it look like, Ed? Huh?

822
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:27,083
It looks like you're thinking about

823
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:29,000
setting fire
to the only thing you care about

824
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:31,833
and stranding yourself
at the scene of the crime.

[grunting]

826
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,542
You're stupid, Ash,
but you're not that stupid.

827
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:38,542
[Ash] You know what's stupid, Ed?

828
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:42,583
Stupid is getting yourself killed
for a stranger.

829
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:45,583
I'm a Marine, you idiot. It's what we do.

830
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,125
How about you, Sandi?

831
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:55,583
You wanna die
because Ed wants to play hero?

832
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:56,667
Huh?

833
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:04,042
You give us the medicine.
We give you the keys.

834
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:06,000
You drive out and it's done.

835
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:08,250
I'm done talking, Ed.

836
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:11,583
They're hidden.

837
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:13,500
Good.

838
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:16,958
[Sandi] Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I forgot I have something better.

839
01:03:21,667 --> 01:03:23,583
[Ed] Since when you been carrying Mace?

840
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:27,167
I'd need a much bigger purse
to fit everything you don't know about me.

841
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,417
Give me the matches.

842
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,333
[Lars] Are we really gonna burn 'em?

843
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:33,458
[Ash] That's up to them.

01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:42,958
They won't do it.

Fuck.

850
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:57,833
Ed, I don't wanna die here.

Nobody is dying here.

Get in here.

Hey, guys. This is my maid, Mrs. Lowery.
And now she's gonna do the dance.

Ready?

No‐‐ Honey, I've got work to do.

862
01:04:34,667 --> 01:04:36,375
Well, then, I could tell my mom

863

on the porch.

01:05:27,167 --> 01:05:29,167
[muffled whimpering]

886
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:32,250
[Ash] The medicine
wasn't where you said it would be.

887
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:33,667
And now she's dying again.

888
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,208
So you need to come meet us,

889
01:05:35,292 --> 01:05:39,333
or we'll bury this kid in the mountains
and you get nothing. You got that?

890
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:45,625
[Ash] One!

891
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,292
[Sandi] Wait! Wait!

892
01:05:47,917 --> 01:05:49,333
He doesn't have a gun!

893
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,250
‐What the fuck did you just do?
‐God! She's the one who fucking did‐‐

894
01:05:57,333 --> 01:06:00,208
‐[screaming]
‐Jesus Christ, Sandi!

895
01:06:00,292 --> 01:06:02,000
Are you crazy?

896
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,208
[screaming continues]

897
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:06,333
Ash, what‐‐ What'd she say?

898
01:06:06,417 --> 01:06:09,458
The bank called me,
and they told me that it was all gone.

899
01:06:09,958 --> 01:06:14,167
Our savings, our future. All of it, Ed.

900
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:15,750
All of it!

901
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:18,667
So I tried to fix it. That is what I did.

902
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:20,208
[coughing]

903
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:25,875
Why didn't you just say something?
I had a plan!

904
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:28,583
What? You're gonna win it back?

905
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:30,417
[Ash] We're coming in, Ed.

906
01:06:36,417 --> 01:06:38,500
Drop it! Drop it!

907
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:41,958
‐Lars, take her over by Jay.
‐What?

908
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:44,958
Do it.

909
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:48,292
[Darby moaning]

910
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:49,458
[Lars] Stay there!

911
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,833
Please, don't move. Please.

912
01:06:56,167 --> 01:06:58,708
‐[Darby] Leave‐‐
‐You're gonna‐‐ You're gonna be okay.

913
01:06:58,792 --> 01:07:01,792
I just wanna go home.

914
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:02,875
Yeah, I do too.

915
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:05,917
Are you done?

916
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:09,708
Hurry up, Sandi!

917
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:12,833
[Jay screams]

918
01:07:14,833 --> 01:07:16,292
[Sandi] You'll be okay now, Jay.

919
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,083
Kid's gonna live. Hallelujah!

920
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,708
How did you even meet these freaks?

921
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:21,917
The Internet.

922
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
We were never even supposed to meet
and nothing was supposed to happen to Jay

923
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:28,917
and nothing is going to happen to her,
right?

924
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:31,458
You're still gonna ransom her, right?

925
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:34,792
They were never gonna ransom her. [coughs]

926
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:38,125
They traffic kids. They sell them.

927
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:39,833
You got catfished.

928
01:07:39,917 --> 01:07:41,125
Don't you say that.

929
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,542
Yeah. We're finding her a better home.

930
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:46,833
Right, Ash?

931
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:48,417
‐That's right, Lars.
‐[Lars] Yeah!

932
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:54,542
No. Whatever you were planning,
you can still change your minds.

933
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:56,458
It's $2 million.

934
01:07:56,542 --> 01:07:59,458
Is someone offering you more than that?
Huh?

935
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:03,625
Whatever it is,
Jay's parents will triple it.

936
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:05,708
‐They'll‐‐ They'll triple‐‐
‐No.

937
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,750
Ed, you get it, right?

938
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:13,458
I just did it for the money.
It's so much money‐‐

939
01:08:13,542 --> 01:08:16,458
Sandi, this isn't about the fucking money.
Shut up.

940
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:19,917
We don't deliver the kid, we're fucked.

941
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:23,833
Okay.

942
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:27,250
Okay.

943
01:08:29,292 --> 01:08:33,333
Okay, you've got her now,
so why don't you just leave?

944
01:08:33,417 --> 01:08:35,042
Well, that's a good idea, Sandi.

945
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:38,542
Where are the keys, Ed?

946
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:40,708
I don't know.

947
01:08:40,792 --> 01:08:44,417
I'm done playing games!
Where did you put the keys?

948
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,542
Fuck you.

949
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:47,458
She hid them out back somewhere.

950
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,250
Darby!

951
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:52,083
Where did you put the keys?

952
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:55,125
Listen, you tell him, and we're all dead.

953
01:08:56,208 --> 01:08:57,208
[Sandi screams]

954
01:08:57,292 --> 01:09:00,042
No! [screaming]

955
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:01,500
Oh, God.

956
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:03,875
No!

957
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:07,625
[Jay, Darby scream]

958

[crying] Oh, Ed.

961
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:33,125
I'm so sorry.

[Darby] No, no! No!

[grunting, screaming]

966
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:56,333
No! No! No! No, please! No!

Please! No, please! [crying]

968

Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!

970
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:10,583
Listen, please, please!

[whimpering]

975
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,417
Ash. Ash, my eyes!

[Ash panting]

977
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:34,667
Hey. Let me see.

978
01:10:36,042 --> 01:10:39,917
We're gonna wash it out. Okay? Come on.

979
01:10:43,292 --> 01:10:46,625
‐Jay, if you move, I'll kill her.

[panting]

984
01:11:30,542 --> 01:11:33,500
[crying] You killed him.
You shot him dead.

985
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:35,083
You shot him.

986
01:11:39,792 --> 01:11:42,417
[crying, panting]

987

Ja‐‐ Jay!

989

[whispers] I need your hel‐‐
I need your help.

990
01:12:03,375 --> 01:12:04,833
It's okay. Quickly.

991
01:12:05,417 --> 01:12:07,833
Come‐‐ Come here. Come here.

992
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:10,333
I had to. I had no choice.
I have to look after us. All right?

993
01:12:10,417 --> 01:12:12,250
‐I know. I know!
‐I have to look after‐‐

994
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:13,875
I have to look after you, Lars!

[panting]

996
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:27,792
‐[Jay whispers] I'm scared.
‐I need the hammer.

997
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:29,958
I need the hammer.

998
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:34,000
I need you to keep it together.

999
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:37,667
We just gotta get the keys,
and we're gone. All right? Come on.

1000
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:38,792
Let's go.

‐No.
‐Shh!

1003

Okay, okay.

1004
01:12:55,708 --> 01:12:58,250
It's quitting time, Darby.
Where are the keys?

1005
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,750
I don't have them.

1006
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:04,708
[phone chimes]

1007
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:24,208
Your mom died.

1008
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:43,833
Thoughts and prayers.

1009

[phone chimes]

1010
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:03,833
What's wrong?

1011
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,167
The text to the cops went through.

1012
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:09,958
You know she sent a text?

1013
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:12,292
Yeah, but I deleted it.

1014
01:14:13,042 --> 01:14:14,042
[sighs]

1015
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:17,833
Where are the keys?

1016

Keys.

1017
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:23,417
[screaming] Where are the keys, Darby?

1018
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:30,208
[screams] No! Please! No!

1019
01:14:31,792 --> 01:14:33,042
Ash, don't!

1020
01:14:34,417 --> 01:14:36,958

[Jay] No. [whimpers]

1024

1025
01:14:47,333 --> 01:14:49,125
[footsteps departing]

1026
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:51,958
All right. Hold it.

1027
01:14:54,333 --> 01:14:55,917
Come on. You got that?

1028
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,583
If she tries anything,
you shoot her, okay?

1029
01:14:58,667 --> 01:15:00,583
[Jay whimpers]

1030
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,750
‐[siren blaring]
‐[on radio] All roads are opening back up…

1031
01:15:39,417 --> 01:15:41,667
It's okay, Jay.
We're gonna be out of here soon.

1032
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:00,792
Come on.

1033
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:10,792
[whispering]
I need you to turn out the lights.

1034
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:19,625
I can't.

1035
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:21,458
[Darby] Yes, you can.

1036
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:24,708
He won't hurt you.

1037
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,625
Jay, what are you doing?

1038
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:34,458
‐Lars. I know you don't wanna hurt Jay.
‐Jay, sit down.

1039
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:37,667
Go back now. Jay, sit down!

1040
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:40,000
‐Lars. Listen to me.
‐Uh‐huh?

1041
01:16:40,083 --> 01:16:42,458
You're not that guy, Lars.
You don't have to do this.

1042
01:16:42,542 --> 01:16:44,708
‐Jay, don't‐‐
‐Lars, that's not who you are.

1043
01:16:44,792 --> 01:16:46,750
‐You're not like him.
‐Shut up! Shut up!

1044
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,708
‐[Darby] Put the gun down, Lars.
‐[Lars] Stop.

1045

‐Lars, she's just a little girl!
‐Tell her to sit down! Tell her.

1046
01:16:52,042 --> 01:16:56,125
‐[Darby] It's okay, Jay. It's okay.
‐I need you to sit down, okay?

1047
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:58,417
I have a gun. Jay.

1048
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:01,500
Jay, where are you going? Jay. Please.

1049
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:03,708
He told you what was gonna happen.

1050
01:17:04,417 --> 01:17:07,833
Don't make me use this. Huh? Jay?

1051
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:14,250
I need you to sit down now.

1052
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:17,208
Jay. Before he comes back,
I need you to sit down.

1053

Wait‐‐ No‐‐ Don't‐‐

1054
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:21,667
