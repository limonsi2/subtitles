starting to shape up.

8
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:06,656

Give me some skin, girl.

(audience laughing)

16
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:21,531
- What?

17
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:23,176
- I'm just trying to high five.

18
00:01:23,176 --> 00:01:24,825
- No thanks.

19
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:26,701
- Aren't you excited about the set list?

20
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:28,306
- Yeah, but I don't feel the need

21
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:32,616
to engage in skin-on-skin
Neanderthal expressions of joy.

22
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:34,830
(audience laughing)

23
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,895
- Burn on you, dude,

24
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,016
'cause she didn't want to high five you.

25
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:40,429
Sorry.
(audience laughing)

26
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:42,860
- Hey gang, what is up!
(audience cheering)

27
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,384
- [All] Hi James!

28
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:46,357
- Wow, is that what I think it is?

29
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:48,409
The set list for tonight's show?

30
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,730
- Yup, and I think it's a good one.

31
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,783
- Let me check it out.

32
00:01:52,783 --> 00:01:54,700
Okay, wow, I like this.

33
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,692
This is amazing, this is brilliant.

34
00:01:58,692 --> 00:02:00,584
Bravo, Nancy, yes!

35
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:04,270
- Thank you.
(audience laughing)

36
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,173

(audience applause)

40
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:13,998
- [All] Hey Pat.

41
00:02:13,998 --> 00:02:15,676
- Oh, hey y'all.

42
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,483
- Hey Pay, what's that?

43
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:18,316
- Oh this?

44
00:02:18,316 --> 00:02:21,896
Oh, this is my world
famous spicy Pat nachos.

45
00:02:21,896 --> 00:02:24,261
- Nachos!
(audience laughing)

46
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:26,799
- Those nachos look yum yum delish.

47
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:28,299
Can I have a bite?

48
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:31,197
- Uh, I can give you a small one.

49
00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:33,319
You know, I'm really hungry for my nachos.

50
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,557
- Okay, I promise you it's gonna be

51
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:37,286
a teeny tiny baby bite.

52
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:40,869
- Okay.
(audience laughing)

53
00:02:41,743 --> 00:02:43,417
(audience laughing)

54
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:46,236
Well, you might as well finish 'em,

55
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:48,436
since you put your greasy fingers

56
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,246
all over my world famous nachos.

57
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:51,606
(audience laughing)

58
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:54,134
- Ugh, nachos are freaking grody, dude.

59
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,495
(audience laughing)

60
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:57,709
- Is that the set list for tonight?

61
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,398
- That is, my good man.

62
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:00,452
This is the set list.

63
00:03:00,452 --> 00:03:02,112
Nancy worked really hard on it.

64
00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:06,824
And we think it might be the
best set we've ever done.

65
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:08,401
I hope he likes the set list

66
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:09,820
and the order of the songs.

67
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,820
(audience laughing)

68
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,284
(paper ripping)
(audience exclaiming)

69
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:17,893
- What are you doing, Pat?

70
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:19,513
- I hate this.

71
00:03:19,513 --> 00:03:22,440
You know I can't do these
particular songs all in a row.

72
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,455
I need to pace myself

73
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:24,628
in order to give a great performance.

74
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:25,733
You know this!

75
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:28,380
- I know it might be
hard, but you can do it.

76
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,420
And we all think this can be

77
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,808
the greatest set we've ever done together.

78
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:33,661
- I said no!
(audience exclaiming)

79
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:37,102
I don't want to do it in that order.

80
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:41,707
I am offended you guys
would even consider this.

81
00:03:41,707 --> 00:03:44,202
I don't want to go on stage with you.

82
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:45,523
With any of you.

83
00:03:45,523 --> 00:03:48,187
As long as you keep on
ganging up on me like this.

84
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,861
- Yo, yo!
(audience cheering)

85
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:51,952
What is all this commotion?

86
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:53,516
- He just tore up the set list.

87
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:56,485
- He tore up the set list.
(all talking over each other)

88
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:57,318
(audience laughing)

89
00:03:57,318 --> 00:03:59,445
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- Understand.

90
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:00,826
- You guys are giving me a damn headache.

91
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:03,376
One at a time.
(audience laughing)

92
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,891
Pat.

93
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:07,655
- These guys are having
a nervous breakdown

94
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:10,111
about the cool set list.

95
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:12,071
And I just think it's too hard,

96
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:13,423
and I don't think I'm gonna play tonight.

97
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:15,340
- Now now, Pat, listen.

98
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:17,873
These guys are not just your band mates,

99
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:19,643
these are your good friends.

100
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:22,603
They got your back, they believe in you.

101
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:23,830
- I don't know.

102
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,382
- Pat, you can do it.

103
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:26,746
- Ooh, I know what we can do.

104
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:28,040
We can ask Tyler.

105
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,957
He's really good at set lists.

106
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:31,660
- Hey, that's a great idea.

107
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,953
But, where is Tyler?

108
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:35,870
- I think I might know.

109
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:39,891
(knocking on door)

110
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:41,665
Tyler, you in there?

111
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:42,932
- [Tyler] Yeah.

112
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:45,159
- Do you mind if I come inside?

113
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,409
- [Tyler] Okay.

114
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:50,921
(audience laughing)

115
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,530
- What are you doing in here?

116
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,780
- I don't know.

117
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:57,919
- How long have you been in here?

118
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,169
- I don't know.

119
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:02,249
(audience laughing)

120
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:03,950
- Poor Tyler.
(melancholy music)

121
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,950
He's been through a lot.

122
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:09,068
It's a big show for him.

123
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:11,188
For all of us, really.

124
00:05:11,188 --> 00:05:12,200
- Yeah, okay.
(audience laughing)

125
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,779
Now that we've found Tyler,

126
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:16,117
let's get you guys to the stage.

127
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:18,262
Pat, I know you're not
excited about the set list,

128
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:20,975
but listen, we believe in you.

129
00:05:20,975 --> 00:05:22,714
And you know, sometimes
you have to push yourself

130
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:24,430
to the top of the mountain

131
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,806
with the help of all my friends.

132
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:31,031
- Yeah, I'll try.
(audience applause)

133
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,288
- Let's go.
(bright music)

134
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:34,107
- Let's go!
- Let's do it!

135
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:35,579
Let's have a great show!
(audience applause)

136
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:37,631
Come on!

137
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:38,743
(all cheering)

138
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:39,576
- Rock and roll!

139
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:40,741
Have a bitching show!

140
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,238
Let's go, you guys!

141
00:05:42,238 --> 00:05:43,495
Show 'em what you're working with.

142
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:45,148
Come on, let's go, baby.

143
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:47,148
Yes yes yes yes yes yes!

144
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:49,687
Fuck!

- Okay.

148
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:29,202
Hey everybody.

149
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:30,035
