But the resemblance
is uncanny.

In exchange
for my freedom,

I gave GUN
the most powerful weapon

But firing a weapon
that powerful

could threaten millions
of innocent lives!

Once we have both,

And done!

821
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:43,877
Masterpiece.
- Look at that.
- Yay!

822
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:47,489
It's really been great
having time to ourselves.

823
00:48:47,663 --> 00:48:50,101
Right. Absolutely.
I just feel so...

824
00:48:50,275 --> 00:48:51,667
relaxed, you know?
Clearheaded.

825
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:54,148
Mmm, look at all these
new interests we found.

826
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:56,324
- I know, so many hobbies.
- So many!

827
00:48:56,498 --> 00:48:59,327
After the action and adventure
of the last few years,

828
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:01,721
- well, I could get used to this.
- Same.

829
00:49:01,895 --> 00:49:03,897
[deep rumbling]

830
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:09,816
[Sonic] Tom! Maddie!
We need your help on a super--

831
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,819
- Knuckles, do you mind?
- Oh! Excuse me.

832
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:14,429
Tom! Maddie! We need your help

833
00:49:14,603 --> 00:49:16,127
on a super-dangerous
top-secret mission!

834
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:17,345
Hmm.

835
00:49:19,086 --> 00:49:20,740
- Thank God. Yeah, we're in.
- Let's go.

836
00:49:20,914 --> 00:49:23,134
Really? You're in?
Just like that?

837
00:49:23,308 --> 00:49:26,050
Yes. It was getting so boring
- without you guys here.
- Yeah. So...

838
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:27,877
No offense....boring. No, none taken.

839
00:49:28,052 --> 00:49:29,531
I mean, whatever crazy plan
you're cooking up,

840
00:49:29,705 --> 00:49:31,011
- the answer's yes.
- Yes.

841
00:49:31,185 --> 00:49:34,145
Great. But first things first:
What is that?

842
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,798
Oh! This is...

843
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,409
[in puppet voice]
...Li'l Tom!

844
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,063
[normal voice]
Isn't he great?

845
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:42,849
I told you
to get rid of that.
It's very creepy.

846
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:44,198
[puppet voice]
I told him to get rid of you.

847
00:49:44,372 --> 00:49:45,765
[normal voice]
Okay, that's, mmm...

848
00:49:45,939 --> 00:49:48,159
- crossing a line there.
- You are in so much trouble.

849
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:52,990
Okay, this is it.
The belly of the beast.

850
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:55,427
GUN Headquarters in London.

851
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:58,560
[gasps] Tom, we're finally gonna
get to see London together.

852
00:49:58,734 --> 00:50:00,693
Hey, I told you we'd
get there someday, baby.

853
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:02,564
Okay. So here's the plan.

854
00:50:02,738 --> 00:50:04,784
I run in superfast,

855
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:06,916
fly over that water,
no problem,

856
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:08,396
and right when I get to the--

857
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:11,443
[shrieks]
What just happened?

858
00:50:11,617 --> 00:50:12,966
Congratulations.

859
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,142
You just got incinerated
by their energy shield.

860
00:50:15,316 --> 00:50:18,928
We'll need to shut it down
by planting a USB drive
in their server room

861
00:50:19,103 --> 00:50:21,322
that will give me full control
over it.

862
00:50:21,496 --> 00:50:23,107
That's what we need you two for.

863
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:24,978
Couple of badass spies,
that's what we are.

864
00:50:25,152 --> 00:50:26,675
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

865
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:28,503
[Tails] Once we
disable the shield,

866
00:50:28,677 --> 00:50:30,505
you'll face the laser hall.

867
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:32,290
[grunts]

868
00:50:32,464 --> 00:50:35,728
These high-density bad boys
will cut you into tiny pieces.

869
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:39,732
And cut those pieces
into even tinier pieces!

870
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:41,995
Once again... [shrieks]

871
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:44,389
Can't we just get Tom Cruise
to do this?[Tails] Nope.

872
00:50:44,563 --> 00:50:48,175
Because not even he
could break into... the vault.

873
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:49,785
[Sonic]
Why is it empty in there?

874
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:51,396
[Tails]
Because we have no idea

875
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:53,050
what's on the other side
of that door.

876
00:50:53,224 --> 00:50:55,704
To prevent the vault from ever
being accessed by a ring,

877
00:50:55,878 --> 00:50:58,838
all images and schematics have
been wiped from GUN's database.

878
00:50:59,012 --> 00:51:01,058
So for the last leg
of this heist...

879
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,278
[in puppet voice]
...we're going in blind.

880
00:51:08,978 --> 00:51:10,197
Sorry.

881
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:11,894
[Maddie] Okay,
I'm just gonna say it.

882
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,462
It sounds like this plan would
work a heck of a lot better

883
00:51:14,636 --> 00:51:18,162
if Sonic used the Master Emerald
to go Golden God mode

884
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:19,554
to get the key.

885
00:51:20,642 --> 00:51:22,166
No way, Maddie.

886
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,298
The Master Emerald
is too powerful
to ever use again.

887
00:51:24,472 --> 00:51:26,779
We made a promise to each other
to keep it hidden.

888
00:51:26,953 --> 00:51:29,086
In a location
only Knuckles knows.

889
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,436
As guardian
of the Master Emerald,

890
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:34,482
anyone who tries
to take it away
for any reason...

891
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:36,963
will become a sworn enemy.

892
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:38,878
Okay, okay! Sheesh!

893
00:51:39,052 --> 00:51:40,662
No need to get
all growly on me, buddy.

894
00:51:40,836 --> 00:51:43,970
You guys are always telling us
to make good choices.

895
00:51:44,144 --> 00:51:45,885
Well, this is the right choice.

896
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:47,626
Okay.

897
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,107
I guess
we're going to...

898
00:51:50,281 --> 00:51:53,719
["London Town"
by Mr Eazi playing]

899
00:52:05,687 --> 00:52:07,515
London, baby!

900
00:52:10,779 --> 00:52:13,304
GUN Headquarters
is right there.

901
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:17,438
Let me go in, get the key
and destroy anyone in my way!

902
00:52:17,612 --> 00:52:19,179
I want revenge.

903
00:52:19,353 --> 00:52:20,702
[Gerald]
Patience, Shadow.

904
00:52:20,876 --> 00:52:23,140
Just let us handle this...

905
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,448
and I promise
you'll have revenge

906
00:52:27,622 --> 00:52:31,365
on a scale you couldn't
possibly imagine.

907
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:34,542
Come on, Granddaddy-O,
we've got...

908
00:52:34,716 --> 00:52:35,761
dirt to do!

909
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:37,719
Suits.

910
00:52:37,893 --> 00:52:38,894
Right here, sir.

911
00:52:39,939 --> 00:52:41,810
Stone, babysit the hedgehog.

912
00:52:41,984 --> 00:52:44,422
Keep the crab on a low boil.

913
00:52:45,597 --> 00:52:47,903
It's time
for more family bonding.

914
00:52:52,691 --> 00:52:54,171
Come on, Shadow.

915
00:52:54,345 --> 00:52:58,262
Got fresh avocados in the crab.
We'll make guac.

916
00:53:00,002 --> 00:53:01,830
Revenge guac!

917
00:53:09,751 --> 00:53:13,799
Guys, are you ready for me yet?
I've been waiting here all day.

918
00:53:16,584 --> 00:53:19,413
Sonic,
we literally just started.

919
00:53:19,587 --> 00:53:21,807
Tom, Maddie,
are you in position and ready?

920
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:24,113
- We were born ready.
- Let's do this.

921
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:25,506
[Tails]
Knuckles, how about you?

922
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,813
I have taken my perch
atop the giant clock.

923
00:53:27,987 --> 00:53:30,642
Now, where is this glass
I'm supposed to break?

924
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:32,296
Actually, Knucks, your job

925
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,776
is to "Break Glass
in Case of Emergency."

926
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,474
Understood.

927
00:53:36,648 --> 00:53:39,868
I will shatter this glass
like the jaw of a vile foe.

928
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:41,957
In case of emergency.

929
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:44,830
I will pulverize it like
the skull of a loathsome rival!

930
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:48,094
Just to be clear,
the "emergency"
is the important part.

931
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:49,922
The glass will beg for mercy

932
00:53:50,096 --> 00:53:52,403
under the shadow
of my mighty fist!

933
00:53:52,577 --> 00:53:54,013
Guys, remember,
we're a team.

934
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:55,536
- Let's focus.
- Please.

935
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:56,885
[Sonic] You know what?
Let's move on.

936
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:58,887
All right,
everyone knows what to do.

937
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:01,150
Tom and Maddie,
you guys plant the USB drive.

938
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:03,849
I'll disable the traps.
Sonic will snag the launch key.

939
00:54:04,023 --> 00:54:05,764
And Knuckles, you stand by to--

940
00:54:05,938 --> 00:54:08,288
Break glass in case
of emergency.

941
00:54:08,462 --> 00:54:09,681
See? He gets it.

942
00:54:09,855 --> 00:54:11,204
Then we're all set.

943
00:54:11,378 --> 00:54:12,945
Hologram time.

944
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:15,426
You go first.

945
00:54:17,558 --> 00:54:19,256
Tom, it's me, Rachel!

946
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:21,258
Can you believe it?
We're both in London together.

947
00:54:21,432 --> 00:54:23,216
Have you met your sister?
Try again.

948
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:24,435
Unless...

949
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:26,393
you're not
up for this mission.

950
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:28,787
Yeah, maybe you want
to be back in Green Hills,
baking sourdough.

951
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:30,615
- Thomas Michael Wachowski!
- Gah!

952
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:32,225
You brought aliens
to my wedding,

953
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:34,227
punched out my husband
and buried me in an avalanche.

954
00:54:34,401 --> 00:54:36,316
Your day of reckoning
is at hand!

955
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:37,491
Yeah, that's perfect.

956
00:54:37,665 --> 00:54:40,102
Okay, now for
her better half.

957
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:46,674
Ho-ho, my name is Randall,
and I am too much to handle!

958
00:54:46,848 --> 00:54:48,502
Welcome to the gun show!

959
00:54:48,676 --> 00:54:51,723
Baby, would you describe me
as jacked, juiced,

960
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:54,116
or shredded?

961
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,944
I would describe your head
as swollen.

962
00:54:56,118 --> 00:54:57,294
Let's get to work.

963
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:02,603
Agent Randall Handel.

964
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:05,432
I'm here to have lunch
with my lovely wife, Rachel.

965
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:06,912
[desk guard]
I'm sorry, Agent Handel,

966
00:55:07,086 --> 00:55:09,349
this facility's
currently locked down.

967
00:55:09,523 --> 00:55:11,133
Command-level
clearance only.

968
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,310
One minute.

969
00:55:14,267 --> 00:55:16,530
Tails... we have a problem here.

970
00:55:16,704 --> 00:55:19,577
Wow, they must have
tightened security
after Shadow's escape.

971
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:21,230
I got this.

972
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:23,798
You must be new here.

973
00:55:23,972 --> 00:55:26,627
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Rachel.

974
00:55:26,801 --> 00:55:28,194
Rachel Gonnagetyoufired.

975
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:31,110
Do you know what GUN
stands for?

976
00:55:31,284 --> 00:55:33,678

01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:49,599
Well, now it's the only choice.

1301
01:13:49,773 --> 01:13:51,557
And if neither of you
have the guts to help me,

1302
01:13:51,731 --> 01:13:53,167
then I'll do it alone.

1303
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:55,431
But I thought
the three of us
were a team.

1304
01:13:55,605 --> 01:13:57,607
I thought that's what
made us special.

1305
01:13:57,781 --> 01:13:59,565
I'm not asking you twice,
Knuckles.

1306
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:03,264
Where is the Master Emerald?

1307
01:14:05,005 --> 01:14:08,356
Your heart is being consumed
by anger, hedgehog.

1308
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:11,577
You are in no condition
to make decisions right now.

1309
01:14:11,751 --> 01:14:14,319
I know you're upset about Tom.
We all are.

1310
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:16,190
Last chance.

1311
01:14:16,364 --> 01:14:18,976
Where... is it?

1312
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:21,065
Don't do this.

1313
01:14:27,724 --> 01:14:30,683
Part of our oath
is to trust each other.

1314
01:14:30,857 --> 01:14:33,077
And I must abide
by that promise,

1315
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:35,558
even if you have chosen
to break it.

1316
01:14:35,732 --> 01:14:37,473
But heed this warning:

1317
01:14:37,647 --> 01:14:40,998
The Master Emerald is guarded
by a fearsome warrior.

1318
01:14:41,172 --> 01:14:43,348
And to seize
this ultimate power,

1319
01:14:43,522 --> 01:14:45,437
you will have to go...

1320
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:47,657
through him.

1321
01:14:47,831 --> 01:14:48,962
[exhales deeply]

1322
01:14:49,136 --> 01:14:51,748
Okay, Wade...
all comes down to this.

1323
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,141
Last few seconds.

1324
01:14:54,315 --> 01:14:55,447
Whipple down the ice.

1325
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:59,146
He shoots... he scores!

1326
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:02,367
Wade Whipple
is a champion again!

1327
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:03,716
[cackles]

1328
01:15:08,286 --> 01:15:11,463
Oh, hey, Sonic. See my goal?
Pretty sick, right?

1329
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:13,465
I'm here for the Emerald.

1330
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:15,162
Look, Sonic, I'm sorry.

1331
01:15:15,336 --> 01:15:17,513
I promised to guard this emerald
with my life.

1332
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:19,515
I will do whatever it takes--

1333
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:21,734
Well, I tried.

1334
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:25,869
[thunder rumbling]

1335
01:15:27,174 --> 01:15:28,175
[Wade] Sonic!

1336
01:15:32,092 --> 01:15:33,093
Too bright!

1337
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:39,752
[woman] This is an urgent
national emergency broadcast.

1338
01:15:39,926 --> 01:15:42,363
A spacecraft designed
by the agency GUN

1339
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:45,453
has been hijacked and launched
out of the River Thames.

1340
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:49,240
[man broadcasting in Japanese]

1341
01:15:51,242 --> 01:15:54,288
[man] All residents are urged
to seek immediate shelter.

1342
01:16:16,354 --> 01:16:18,617
[Gerald] It's time, Shadow.

1343
01:16:20,271 --> 01:16:24,362
Professor, is this really
what Maria would have wanted?

1344
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:30,498
The question isn't
what Maria would have wanted.

1345
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,632
It's what do they deserve.

1346
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:37,114
Remember what she meant to us.

1347
01:16:38,985 --> 01:16:41,901
Remember what they took from us.

1348
01:16:52,346 --> 01:16:53,391
[Gerald] Kids!

1349
01:16:53,565 --> 01:16:55,480
We have to go, now!

1350
01:16:55,654 --> 01:16:57,264
[Maria panting]

1351
01:17:00,703 --> 01:17:03,140
[Gerald] They want to take
Shadow away from us, Maria!

1352
01:17:07,971 --> 01:17:09,146
[weapons charging]

1353
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:14,455
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
Those are children.

1354
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,414
- We've got our orders, Walters!
- Stand down!

1355
01:17:18,068 --> 01:17:19,939
[gasps]

1356
01:17:27,817 --> 01:17:29,819

[groaning]

1359
01:17:40,264 --> 01:17:41,482
Huh?

1360
01:17:43,049 --> 01:17:44,137
Maria!

1361
01:18:17,867 --> 01:18:19,259
[angry roar]

1362
01:18:19,912 --> 01:18:21,697
[panting heavily]

1363
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:34,622
Excuse me,
Grand Paso Doble.

1364
01:18:34,797 --> 01:18:37,756
What is that thermonuclear
gerbil doing?

1365
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:40,280
[Gerald] Infusing the core...

1366
01:18:40,454 --> 01:18:41,934
with chaos energy.

1367
01:18:42,108 --> 01:18:44,720
That's my little secret.

1368
01:18:44,894 --> 01:18:47,505
The Eclipse Cannon
is about to turn this planet

1369
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:50,464
into a flaming pile
of rubble,

1370
01:18:50,638 --> 01:18:55,469
wiping out everything
in a 25,000-mile radius.

1371
01:18:58,646 --> 01:19:00,823
Including us.

1372
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,002
What?

1373
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:10,006
We can't annihilate
the Earth!

1374
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:14,619
- Hmm?
- By combining our genius,
we can rule humanity.

1375
01:19:14,793 --> 01:19:15,707
Together!

1376
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:18,971
Humanity is a failed experiment.

1377
01:19:19,145 --> 01:19:21,365
If anyone should know that,
it's you.

1378
01:19:23,106 --> 01:19:26,022
All your life, you've been
rejected by this world.

1379
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:28,546
You have nothing down there.

1380
01:19:30,156 --> 01:19:32,202
No one who cares about you.

1381
01:19:33,986 --> 01:19:35,553
But I have you now.

1382
01:19:38,251 --> 01:19:39,644
We're family.

1383
01:19:40,558 --> 01:19:42,168
We have each other.

1384
01:19:43,648 --> 01:19:44,910
Oh, Ivo...

1385
01:19:46,738 --> 01:19:48,435
you're no Maria.

1386
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:55,747
The moment I lost her,
my family was gone forever!

1387
01:19:57,401 --> 01:19:59,142
The only way
to give Maria's life
meaning

1388
01:19:59,316 --> 01:20:01,579
is to destroy the world
that took her from me.

1389
01:20:02,449 --> 01:20:04,582
So I'm burning it all down!

1390
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,455
It's done.

1391
01:20:08,629 --> 01:20:10,936
Good work, Shadow.

1392
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:12,982
I'm prepping
the firing sequence.

1393
01:20:13,156 --> 01:20:17,029
The weapon will be fully charged
in ten minutes.

1394
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:23,079
It's almost finished, Maria.

1395
01:20:23,993 --> 01:20:26,343
You will have justice.

1396
01:20:26,517 --> 01:20:28,127
[muffled, distant boom]

1397
01:20:30,738 --> 01:20:32,044
What is that?

1398
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:35,918
Is GUN launching
missiles at us?

1399
01:20:36,092 --> 01:20:39,138
Impossible.
It's moving too fast.

1400
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:43,882
It's him.

1401

[both grunting]

You hurt my family.
This ends now!

1404
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,549
Now you know my anger.

1405
01:20:58,723 --> 01:21:01,595
The pain I've felt
for 50 years.

1406
01:21:01,769 --> 01:21:05,034
And you've made
the same choice I did.

1407
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:06,774
I'm nothing like you!

1408
01:21:06,949 --> 01:21:08,037
We'll see.

- Where?

- Higher.

since I hate-watched
Green Lantern in 2011.

I was saving it for Comic-Con.

But now there won't
be a Comic-Con!

They tried to stop you,
didn't they?

01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:38,056
But you came anyway.

1445

Your anger was too much.

1446
01:23:40,841 --> 01:23:43,583
What kind of hero
abandons his friends

1447
01:23:43,757 --> 01:23:45,803
to pursue revenge?

1448
01:23:45,977 --> 01:23:48,284
Abandons his family!

1449

Don't you dare talk
about my family.

And here I thought
you cared for them.

for the one and only person
who ever cared about me.

1627
01:36:26,519 --> 01:36:28,434
Don't do this, Doctor, please!

1628
01:36:28,608 --> 01:36:32,221
Stone, you were more
than a sycophant to me.

1629
01:36:35,093 --> 01:36:36,355
You were...

1630
01:36:37,835 --> 01:36:39,358
a syco-friend.

1631
01:36:44,929 --> 01:36:48,454
I'll miss your lattes
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

1632
01:36:50,413 --> 01:36:52,284
I love the way you make 'em!

1633
01:37:35,371 --> 01:37:39,201
So... I guess there's
only one thing left to say.

1634
01:37:39,984 --> 01:37:42,421
[mimics robotic servos]

1635
01:37:43,988 --> 01:37:45,468
It's been a real drag.

1636
01:37:46,164 --> 01:37:47,644
Thanks for nothing.

Shadow and Robotnik.

1641
01:38:19,676 --> 01:38:21,896
They sacrificed
themselves...

1642
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:24,072
to save everyone.

1643
01:38:24,811 --> 01:38:26,857
You always have a choice.

1644
01:38:28,119 --> 01:38:30,861
Guys, I'm really sorry
for running off like that.

1645
01:38:31,035 --> 01:38:32,645
I shouldn't have
left you behind.

1646
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:36,040
The truth is...

1647
01:38:36,214 --> 01:38:38,869
you're the best teammates
a hedgehog could ever ask for.

1648
01:38:40,610 --> 01:38:42,438
And the best friends.

1649
01:38:42,612 --> 01:38:44,483
Can you ever forgive me?

1650
01:38:48,574 --> 01:38:50,359
Team Sonic?

1651
01:38:54,450 --> 01:38:57,061
[Sonic]
How about just "team"?

1652
01:39:05,374 --> 01:39:06,984
Goodbye, Doctor.

[Sonic] Big finish.[Knuckles] Mmm!

Now that's
what I call teamwork.

Okay! It's ready!

Knuckles,
how could you?

1659
01:39:36,753 --> 01:39:38,581
Gotta be faster than that!

1660
01:39:39,495 --> 01:39:40,583
Give me a break.

1661
01:39:40,757 --> 01:39:42,063
Still moving a little slow

Okay, Knuckles, that's... I am having the love.

01:39:48,721 --> 01:39:50,071
[barks]
I want the love!

[Tails] Aww... Get in here, Ozzy.

1667
01:39:53,117 --> 01:39:54,814
It's great
to be back together.

1668
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:56,816
We're stronger than ever.

1669
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:59,428
And nothing is gonna
stand in our way.

1670
01:40:00,777 --> 01:40:04,607
Except that one piece
of unfinished business.

1671

And way out in front, to the
surprise of absolutely no one,

it's the Blue Blur!

Let's do this!

Yeah! [laughs]

1678
01:40:26,411 --> 01:40:29,501

All right, boys,
try and keep up.

Okay. Yeah, I overshot
the finish line.

[Sonic] Pro tip:

1690
01:43:02,437 --> 01:43:03,655
If you're gonna take a shot

1691
01:43:03,829 --> 01:43:05,962
at the fastest creature
in the universe...

1692
01:43:08,312 --> 01:43:09,922
you'd better not miss.

1693
01:43:13,752 --> 01:43:16,364
Um... I'm flattered
by the cosplay,

1694
01:43:16,538 --> 01:43:18,235
but you got
a few details wrong.

1695
01:43:18,409 --> 01:43:21,282
I can't blame you, though.
It's hard to copy perfection.

That's a neat trick.
