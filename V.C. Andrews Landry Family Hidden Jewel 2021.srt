3
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,142
Man's voice: Help me...

4
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:21,520
Help me...

5
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:49,882
Another one?

6
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:52,468
Tell me what you saw.

7
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:53,510
Come on, Mom.

8
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:54,887
It was just a dream.

9
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,013
Come here.

10
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,434
Go to sleep now.

11
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,437
You've got a big day tomorrow,
Miss Valedictorian.

12
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,695
Pearl had another
nightmare last night.

13
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,372
I'm concerned about her.

14
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,699
Morning.

15
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,168
Sleep well the rest
of the night?

16
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,252
Fine.

17
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:32,925
Except... somehow my cap
has disappeared.

18
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,718
Anyone?

19
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,679
Jean? Pierre?

20
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,849
I mean, what type of cap?
Like a, like a bottle cap?

21
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,051
Nice try.

22
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,729
Now go get your sister's
graduation cap.

23
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,274
All right, give it here.

24
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:51,819
Thank you.

25
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,279
All right, let's get
you kids ready.

26
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:55,656
Yes.

27
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:04,373
I'm so lucky, Pearl, to have you
and your wonderful brothers.

28
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,959
I remember when I was
your age.

29
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,002
It doesn't seem long ago
at all.

30
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:12,589
And now my daughter's 18?

31
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,216
All grown up.

32
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,300
Trying.

33
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,844
But hopefully even
when you're my age

34
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,138
you'll always feel the freedom
of being a kid,

35
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:22,266
and not burdened like
so many people are.

36
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:23,809
Burdened by what?

37
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:28,430
Well, a lot of people can't
let go of their demons,

38
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,107
or of their past.

39
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,109
You have to let bygones
be bygones.

40
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,102
That's what I say.

41
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:36,280
Is that why you
never wanna tell me

42
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,490
what it was like when
you were my age?

43
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,950
Sweetie...

44
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,243
It's fine.

45
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,945
I know it wasn't glamorous.

46
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,747
It's a long story.

47
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,959
But thank god I survived
and was able to find happiness

48
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,795
with your father,
the boys, and you.

49
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,790
Your mama is strong.

50
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:56,967
Nina, you're here!

51
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,136
I'm so glad to see you.

52
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,014
Nina helped me during a really
bad time when I was young.

53
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,184
Without her I couldn't have
gotten through it.

54
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,770
Your mama and daddy
are so proud of you, Pearl.

55
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,481
Real slick.

56
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,149
What does it say, kick me?

57
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,367
My vote was for kick me,

58
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:26,371
but Pierre thought a poem
would be a little bit nicer.

59
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:33,587
To our beautiful big sis,
whom we'll soon miss,

60
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:37,341
your big day is here,
and there's nothing to fear,

61
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:41,720
for wherever you are,
our hearts will be near.

62
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:44,890
Thank you.

63
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,852
Thanks, Jeeves,
we're all 18.

64
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:58,862
You really should try this.

65
00:03:58,989 --> 00:03:59,696
Hey, sweetheart.

66
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:00,572
Looking good.

67
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:01,856
It's really delicious.

68
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:05,327
Nina, this dish is so good.

69
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,413
Mmm. My father lived
for this jambalaya.

70
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:11,458
Oh, your daddy.
He was a good man.

71
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,960
Mmm.

72
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,536
Are you feeling any better?

73
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,870
Comme ci, comme ca.

74
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:19,874
But I wouldn't miss this joyous
celebration for the world.

75
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:23,053
Did you know that Pearl
is class valedictorian?

76
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,054
Mom.

77
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,098
Now, you are embarrassing
this poor girl,

78
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,599
bragging like this.

79
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:28,892
Though, I have to admit,

80
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,052
there's a lot about her
to brag about.

81
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,729
Mmmhmm.

82
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,697
I'd like to make a toast
to my wonderful daughter, Pearl.

83
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,951
You're my shining jewel
and I'm so proud of you today,

84
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,745
and every day.

85
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,038
To Pearl.

86
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,623
To Pearl.

87
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,545
Good going, seriously.

88
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,913
Smooth, Jean.

89
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:00,749
No poem this time?

90
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,093
Nah, Pierre's more the poet.

91
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,419
Me, I'm the clever one.

92
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,387
Right.

93
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,598
It's so nice that
you're graduating.

94
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,017
Hi, Jeanne.

95
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,810
I'm so happy you made it.

96
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,261
Oh, it's wonderful to be here.

97
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,563
Congratulations, Pearl.

98
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,483
I heard about Tulane,
and I got you a little gift.

99
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,027
Oh, Jeanne.

100
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,112
Thank you so much.

101
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,368
Oh, look at you.

102
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,635
Who is this man?

103
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:49,556
Well, that's your Uncle Paul,
of course,

104
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,634
though I don't remember putting
that particular photo in there.

105
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:53,894
You don't?

106
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,230
I mean, maybe I did.

107
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,068
Hon, what is it?

108
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:07,982
This is the man I've been seeing
in my nightmares.

109
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,618
Paul?

110
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,486
A... and what do you see?

111
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,832
I'm lost and wandering and...

112
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,169
I see him in the water, tangled.

113
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,754
Is he dead?

114
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,464
Dead in the water?

115
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,133
How did you know?

116
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,470
Mom?

117
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,846
Tell me.

118
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:31,515
What is it?

119
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,682
Paul drowned.

120
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,059
He committed suicide.

121
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:37,145
And Jeanne said she didn't
put it in the book,

122
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,022
which means it's an omen.

123
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,359
An omen of what?

124
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,070
Something bad is gonna happen.

125
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,530
I can feel it.

126
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,698
Babe, you have to let go

127
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:53,036
of these silly Bayou
Cajun superstitions.

128
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,580
They're not silly, Beau.

129
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,699
She's right.

130
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,918
I've seen things.

131
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:03,880
And grandmére, she... she
always told me to never boast.

132
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,716
Pride is the devil's eye.
It's what lets him in.

133
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:11,054
Now this photo and Pearl's
dreams and Paul.

134
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,597
It means something.

135
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,391
Maybe it's just memories.

136
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,017
Memories?

137
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,812
But you were a baby
when you last saw him.

138
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:23,692
I must still remember, though,
somewhere deep inside.

139
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,154
But I never told you
he drowned.

140
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,780
Give me this book.

141
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,566
Is everything okay?

142
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,902
Fine. Fine.

143
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,954
I... I'm so happy you came.

144
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,081
I do miss you.

145
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,074
Thank you so much
for the photo album.

146
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,126
Of course.

147
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,296
Are you ready to go back
to my place?

148
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,339
My parents are gone so it's just
a few of us.

149
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:52,471
Um, let's just stay here
a little while longer.

150
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,423
I feel bad leaving after
my parents planned all this.

151
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,017
What about what we planned?

152
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,394
Finally doing this tonight.

153
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,356
Okay, fine.

154
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,192
Let me just go talk to my mom
for a minute,

155
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,902
then we can go.

156
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,696
Sweetie, come on.

157
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,282
Everything okay?

158
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,117
Are you gonna go out
with your friends?

159
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,120
Yeah, they want to.

160
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,830
Well, do be careful, and...

161
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,448
I know what I'm doing.

162
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,918
Honey, I... I know that.

163
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,213
You're an adult and whatever
your gut says,

164
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,507
and whatever you choose...

165
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,627
I... I think I just need
to go lie down.

166
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,137
Are you not feeling well?

167
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,515
No, I... I'll be fine.

168
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,520
You know, I think
I'll stay here.

169
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,604
Really?

170
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,608
That would very much
make me happy.

171
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,486
I just worry.

172
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,239
Let me just tell them
I'm gonna stick around.

173
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,532
Okay.

174
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,246
Come on, Pearl,
uh, let's go.

175
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,414
It's just, it's the party

176
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,708
and it would be rude of me
to leave, so-

177
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:07,504
So we'll stay
and do it here.

178
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:12,884
Wait... where are we going?

179
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,516
In the house
with my parents?

180
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,193
Look, I know you're nervous,

181
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
but you just gotta take
the plunge.

182
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,286
Uh, it's just...

183
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,704
I just think that-

184
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:44,499
That's right,
you think too much.

185
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,879
I don't wanna have sex
until it feels special.

186
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,257
And this doesn't feel special?

187
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,722
No! Not now, not with-

188
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,181
With what?

189
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,766
With me?

190
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:02,517
Oh, my god.

191
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:03,893
Claude, I didn't mean not-

192
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,395
That's what you were gonna say,
right?

193
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,896
But no, it's not because
it's with you-

194
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:11,568
I'm like a ten, Pearl,
and you're like a six.

195
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,069
You're lucky you even
date me.

196
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,529
Okay, this is over.

197
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,114
Oh, you do not get
to dump me,

198
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,398
I'm dumping you first.

199
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,568
Like, seriously, I can't get you
to feel anything,

200
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,746
like any emotion whatsoever.

201
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,706
Not like I was even looking
for that.

202
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,124
What were you looking for?

203
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,375
A challenge.

204
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,128
To see if I could get with
somebody who's such a prude.

205
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,296
Which doesn't matter now

206
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,090
because all my friends think
I did, anyway.

207
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,084
You lied?

208
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,385
What did you tell them?

209
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,722
That we did it in a lab,
and you took notes.

210
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,516
Now give me back
my promise ring.

211
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,456
Kids can be so mean.

212
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:14,172
But as strong as you are,
as strong as your grandmére,

213
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,133
you'll be just fine.

214
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,555
Except I don't know the first
thing about love.

215
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:26,134
Sweetie, to love you have
to keep your heart

216
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,977
as open as your mind.

217
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,479
But I'm just afraid.

218
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,648
Just trust your gut.

219
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,650
Not just your brain.

220
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,979
Trust your gut?

221
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,981
That's just an expression, Mom.

222
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:43,651
There's no decision making
brain cells in your gut.

223
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,162
But you feel something there,
right?

224
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,580
And what's that?

225
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,165
I'll tell you what it is.

226
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,043
It's what got me through
a living hell.

227
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,003
Growing up was really
that bad?

228
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,547
Not with grandmére.

229
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,216
But finding out the man
you're in love with

230
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,010
was your half-brother?

231
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:04,172
And then my terrible twin
sister, Gisselle.

232
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:07,175
She almost ruined it for me
with your father.

233
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:10,520
But I trusted my gut,
did what I had to do,

234
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,896
lord forgive me,

235
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,982
and that's what got me through
all of it.

236
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,527
That, and a little of
grandmére's Cajun gris-gris.

237
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,697
Here.

238
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,323
This is for you.

239
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,025
For good luck.

240
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,244
For good gris-gris to ward off
evil spirits.

241
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,696
Mom, you don't have to.

242
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,123
I want to.

243
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,791
But I know you don't believe
in any of it-

244
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:34,043
But your art opening
is happening tomorrow

245
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,204
and I know it means
so much to you.

246
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:39,215
And that's why I want you
to have it.

247
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,375
Especially with...

248
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,261
What?

249
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,379
Nothing.

250
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:49,100
Just those dreams.
And that picture of Paul.

251
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,051
Mom-

252
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:53,554
I know, I know.
I'm just being silly.

253
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:54,722
Here.

254
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,065
Come here.

255
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,909
I love you, Mom.

256
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,579
I love you, too.

257
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,586
Well, I guess the reason
I don't paint from memories

258
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,757
is the world around us
is so beautiful and rich,

259
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,343
and capturing that is
what my art is about.

260
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,386
It's about the present,
and the future...

261
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,262
Ruby?

262
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,972
I'm looking for Ruby Dumas.

263
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:31,601
Clarice, is everything okay?

264
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,603
No, it's not, Ruby.

265
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,939
My sister Nina is nearing
her end.

266
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,607
It all happened very suddenly,

267
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,101
and as a last resort we took her
to Mama Dede's.

268
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,319
It's what Nina wanted.

269
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,779
Oh, my god.

270
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:43,863
Nina, no.

271
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,616
I'm not here for her sake,
but for yours.

272
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,786
She said she needs to give
you something before she goes.

273
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,496
A warning, she says.

274
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,539
About what?

275
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:53,998
I don't know.

276
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,950
But she says it's urgent.

277
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,210
You best come tonight

278
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,287
because I don't know that she'll
make it till the morning.

279
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,005
I've got to be going,

280
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,882
but you need to take care
of yourself, you hear me?

281
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,467
Yeah, you too.

282
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,797
What's wrong, Mama?

283
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:14,018
Nina, she's sick.

284
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,803
I have to leave
and go see her.

285
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,138
How sick?

286
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,190
She's dying, Pearl.

287
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,976
And she means more to me
than this show.

288
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,144
I gotta go.

289
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,146
Then I'm coming with you.

290
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,825
Nina helped me
when Gisselle was being
so evil to me.

291
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,368
She knew a woman,

292
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,953
a powerful voodoo queen,

293
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,248
who put a curse on Gisselle
to stop her.

294
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,162
Ruby, tell Mama Dede
your troubles.

295
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,090
I have a sister,
a twin sister.

296
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,758
Ah, la marassa.

297
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,012
For some reason she just
seems to hate me.

298
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,840
I just want her to stop
hurting me.

299
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:14,370
Gisselle was riding in a car and
got into a horrible accident.

300
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:18,366
Her boyfriend died and she...
she was paralyzed.

301
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,752
The spell will be
very strong now.

302
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,837
Very strong.

303
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,216
I have to open up
to what I've done.

304
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,686
Mama Nina called out
your name.

305
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:42,106
She said she had a message
for you from the dead.

306
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,695
Y'all are too late.
She gone now.

307
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,868
Oh, Nina.

308
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,871
Nina, Nina.

309
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:04,245
So there was something
she wanted me to know.

310
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,632
Do you know what it was,
Mama Dede?

311
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,842
Je ne sais pas.

312
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:15,181
All of that is between you
and her and the dead now.

313
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,978
But I have to know.

314
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,063
Ruby...

315
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,526
You know what to do.

316
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:35,618
Bring a sacrifice to the
cemetery tonight at midnight.

317
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,279
That's the only way to speak
to her spirit now.

318
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,447
By killing a rabbit?

319
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,874
By Bringing an offering.

320
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:48,006
Your mama needs to know
what Nina saw near death.

321
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,717
She must have glimpsed something
on the other side

322
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,845
that made her want
to warn her.

323
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,109
Paul was a good man.

324
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,530
He was trying to tell you
the same thing in your dream.

325
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,981
Tell me what?

326
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,576
A warning.

327
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,986
That bad gris-gris
is descending upon us

328
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
because of something I did.

329
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,206
What?

330
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,750
What did you do?

331
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,626
I don't know.

332
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,965
But I have to figure out
what it is and atone for it.

333
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,091
Mama-

334
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:36,929
If I don't, something awful
is going to happen.

335
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,840
Mark my words.

336
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,941
When the dead try
to speak...

337
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:54,864
No, no. Guys, this is...
Bodies can do this.

338
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,617
It's reflexes relaxing.

339
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,860
Air being released
from the lungs.

340
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,530
What makes you so sure,
child?

341
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,416
I worked in a hospital
this summer.

342
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:06,667
Mm-hmm.

343
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,221
I'm so sorry about Nina,
mama,

344
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,215
but you can't believe
these things.

345
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,519
Let's go home, okay?

346
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,252
What are you doing?

347
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,131
Singing an old Catholic prayer

348
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,749
to the saints that
grandmére sang.

349
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,635
About what?

350
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,679
About accepting our sins.

351
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,256
And the incense?

352
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,434
Something Mama Dede
told me to try.

353
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,261
Just in case.

354
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,105
In case what?

355
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,940
Unfriendly spirits.

356
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,267
Mama.

357
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,988
Honey, people all over the world
believe in them

358
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,115
in some form or another.

359
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,867
Can they all be wrong?

360
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,288
What is a spirit
even supposed to be?

361
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:32,453
A thing, like a life force
in the past

362
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,506
that lingers beyond its death.

363
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,426
Will you come inside, Mama?
It's cold.

364
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,637
See?

365
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,014
What was that?

366
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,808
It's probably just
an upset neighbor.

367
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,393
Let's go inside.

368
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,353
Come on.

369
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,151
Listen, Mom.

370
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,870
"The exhibit showcased
a masterful body of work.

371
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,707
"A profound post-modern panoply
of allegorical inquisitions

372
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,668
"and disquisitions
that stir the soul."

373
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:13,994
I don't know what that means,

374
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,548
but it sounds like
they loved it.

375
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,682
She's still upset, huh?

376
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:30,895
It's just, she says that Nina
has a message from the grave,

377
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,897
and she and a woman
she called Mama Dede

378
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,733
were talking about killing
a rabbit in a cemetery.

379
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:42,198
Look, I'm not one to disrespect
anyone's beliefs or traditions,

380
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:46,360
but this Bayou faith she has?

381
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:49,038
It's the one thing she hasn't
been able to let go of.

382
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,581
I'm worried about her, Poppa.

383
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:56,420
I suppose she just has to grieve
in her own unique Bayou way.

384
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,214
I have an idea.

385
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,467
What if we all go to the country
house for a couple of days?

386
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:05,713
It might help her and all of us
to relax and unwind.

387
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:09,058
That's a good idea.
Let's do it.

388
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,660
Mom, let's have a good time.

389
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,203
Relax.

390
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:32,957
If you're thinking
about Nina-

391
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:33,874
Oh, I know.

392
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,919
It'll all be fine, I hope.

393
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,672
Well, that drive always
wears me out.

394
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,507
I'm gonna head up for a nap.

395
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,427
-Last one outside is a loser!
-No fair, you got a head start!

396
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:45,469
Be careful!

397
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:46,887
Yeah, yeah.

398
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,937
Jean, Jean, look.
Do you see it?

399
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,939
There's a turtle on the rock.

400
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,400
Woah, cool.

401
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:09,443
Jean, Jean, wait!

402
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,703
There's a snake!
Watch out!

403
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,333
Mom! Dad! Jean got bit
by a snake!

404
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,790
Yes. 241 Bayou Bend.

405
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,925
My brother just got bit
by a snake.

406
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,260
Please hurry.

407
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,388
Mom! Dad! Hurry!

408
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,184
What happened?

409
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,268
Snake bite.

410
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,020
It's all my fault.
I told him to go in there.

411
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,315
We need to slow the spread
of poison to his heart.

412
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:40,900
We need his torso elevated.

413
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,818
Here, let's prop him up
against the tree.

414
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,532
Oh, my baby.
What have I done?

415
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:50,868
His heart's beating too fast.

416
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,653
Jean, you have to stay awake,
okay?

417
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,497
Don't close your eyes.

418
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,333
I'm going
to start a line.

419
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,667
Is he breathing?

420
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,327
Why won't
he open his eyes?

421
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,380
Beau? Why?

422
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,383
Jean, Mom,
what is happening?

423
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:07,051
Is he going to be okay?

424
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:13,307
I'm sorry, there's
nothing more I can do.

425
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:30,524
I can't believe he's gone.

426
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:37,415
What did I do for this to happen
to such a sweet little boy?

427
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,958
Guys.

428
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,962
Guys.

429
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,631
I can't... I can't breathe.

430
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,926
Pierre?

431
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,136
What's wrong?

432
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:51,762
What happened?

433
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:55,048
I got dizzy and everything
went black a second.

434
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,049
Oh, my god.

435
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:56,892
What's wrong with him?

436
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,603
Pierre, take a big,
deep breath.

437
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:03,274
I'm supposed to protect him like
he's supposed to protect me.

438
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,226
It wasn't your fault, Pierre.

439
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,446
Now, breathe with me.

440
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,280
In...

441
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:11,282
Out.

442
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:13,951
In.

443
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:16,579
Out.

444
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,914
There you go.

445
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,291
Good job.

446
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,084
Are you feeling better?

447
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:24,879
Okay.

448
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,715
Thank you.

449
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:33,804
Jean. Jean.

450
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,638
Come on, Jean.

451
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,432
Let's get you upstairs.

452
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,143
This is all my fault.

453
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,270
No, it's not your fault.

454
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:42,688
This was an accident.

455
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:46,099
No, I should have gone to her
gravesite and talked to Nina.

456
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:49,487
Mom, listen to me.

457
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:52,573
There's no such thing as
anything that Nina's sister

458
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:56,243
or that voodoo queen
were talking about.

459
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,578
Okay?

460
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,290
This was not your fault.

461
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,667
This was an accident.

462
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:06,086
Do you hear me?

463
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:24,605
Mom?

464
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,151
Mom.

465
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,985
You need to get some rest.

466
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,120
It's late.

467
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,249
Mom?

468
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:14,530
If... if only I didn't want
the turtle

469
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:18,534
or if I hadn't been in such
a rush to be out there...

470
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:20,027
if we were five minutes later

471
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:23,030
the snake wouldn't have
been there.

472
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:26,709
Pierre, it's not your fault.

473
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:32,798
I was sleeping.

474
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,801
In the middle of the day.

475
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,469
I never do that.

476
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,597
It's not your fault, either.

477
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:40,764
No.

478
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,434
It's mine.

479
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,894
It's something I've done
that's caused this.

480
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:50,316
Stop with this nonsense.

481
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,375
No, no.

482
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,460
No!

483
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:11,670
Pierre?

484
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:13,547
What's wrong?

485
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:14,340
I was...

486
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,425
I had a nightmare.

487
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,720
We were all trapped underwater.

488
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:23,807
Caught in these vines
like in the Bayou.

489
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,394
You're burning up.

490
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:38,113
Pierre had a fever so I gave him
an Aspirin.

491
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,448
Thank you, dear.

492
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,441
You should go to him, Mama.

493
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,452
He called for you.

494
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,996
I can't see him.

495
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:48,448
I will not bring him
any more bad luck.

496
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,210
I have to make Jean's funeral
arrangements...

497
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,287
Why don't I make the calls
while you nap

498
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:55,714
and then you don't
have to-

499
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:04,890
Pierre!

500
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,892
Baby, are you okay?

501
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,060
My chest hurts.

502
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:08,977
It hurts how?

503
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,145
Like someone's sitting
on it.

504
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,640
Let's just breathe, okay?
Slow, deep breaths.

505
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,150
Come on. Come on.

506
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,695
Pierre!

507
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,154
Call 911.

508
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,155
Pearl?

509
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,574
Pearl, what's happening?
Is Pierre ok?

510
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,492
Make the call!

511
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:24,151
Pearl! Pearl!
Talk to me!

512
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:24,993
Dad, give me the phone!

513
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,370
Talk to me!

514
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,916
Yes, we need an ambulance.

515
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,918
My brother,
he can't breathe.

516
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:37,297
It's 10337 St. Charles Avenue.

517
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,216
Hurry, please.

518
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,840
He'll die now, too.

519
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,675
Mom, the doctors will know
what to do.

520
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:52,020
Dr. Clark, room 103.
Dr. Clark you're needed...

521
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,523
I gave him a sedative and
he should be stable for now.

522
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,849
What's wrong with him?

523
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,527
His heart rate is all over
the place and we don't know why.

524
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,353
He hasn't eaten
since his brother died.

525
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:01,447
Could it be shock?

526
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:02,522
That wouldn't explain why

527
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,700
his white blood cell count
is so high.

528
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,077
No, something else is wrong.
Something physical.

529
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,195
He played in the water
in the swamp.

530
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,363
Could it be some kind
of bacteria?

531
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,832
We'll keep running tests.

532
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,668
Will he be able to go to his
brother Jean's funeral?

533
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:15,461
I'm afraid not.

534
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,629
We need to keep him here.

535
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,799
Housekeeping,
room 301.

536
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,032
Jean.

537
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,950
Jean, Jean... Jean.

538
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:48,160
No!

539
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:49,578
It's okay.

540
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:50,245
It's okay.

541
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,404
It's okay.

542
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:52,247
I... I have to get ready to go.

543
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:52,998
Go where?

544
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:53,907
To the funeral.

545
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:54,958
Pierre, it's already happened.

546
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:55,459
No.

547
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:56,084
No, no, no.

548
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:56,794
Where's Mama?

549
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:57,461
She's at home, resting.

550
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,837
I need to go see Mama!

551
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:00,547
No.

552
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:01,298
Uh... can we get some help
in here?

553
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,217
We need help! Please!

554
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:06,470
Excuse me, excuse me.

555
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,763
Stand back.

556
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,597
Check his pulse.

557
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,390
What's going on?

558
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:11,600
Charge the defibrillator.

559
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,760
Charging.

560
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,312
Charge.

561
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:15,896
Charged.

562
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,231
Clear!

563
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,265
Clear.

564
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,358
Charge.

565
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:20,400
Charged.

566
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,610
Clear!

567
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,028
Charge.

568
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:23,770
Charged.

569
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:24,863
Clear!

570
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,288
How is he?

571
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,782
He's stable again,
for now.

572
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,836
But we still don't know
what's wrong with him.

573
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,421
Then you need
to figure it out.

574
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,724
Yeah?

575
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,311
Pearl?

576
00:30:58,482 --> 00:30:59,982
What're you doing?

577
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:02,484
Research.

578
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,861
I'm trying to figure out
what on earth

579
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:06,280
might be going on
with Pierre.

580
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:11,484
It just doesn't make
any sense.

581
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,579
It does.

582
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,323
In its own way.

583
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:19,042
I'm gonna go back
to the hospital.

584
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,211
You have to come with me.

585
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:27,500
Sweetheart, your brother,
I... I can't.

586
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:30,929
It kills me I can't
see him but...

587
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:34,341
he would be worse off
if I did.

588
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:35,642
Mom...

589
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:05,047
Dr. Ganyon?

590
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,133
I found this thing,

591
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:11,711
it doesn't make a lot
of sense to me but I wonder,

592
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,597
do you think Pierre could be
suffering from

593
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,098
Broken Heart Syndrome?

594
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:17,717
You think cardiac arrest is
a figment of his imagination?

595
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,270
I know it doesn't seem logical
on the surface but it-

596
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:21,980
No, it doesn't.

597
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,568
But you have no other ideas,
right?

598
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,737
No.

599
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,906
If you wanna learn more
about Broken Heart Syndrome

600
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,825
the person to talk to
is a psychiatrist.

601
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:36,078
They treat conditions
like that.

602
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,537
Thank you.

603
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:42,709
Dr. Smith line 2.
Dr. Smith line 2.

604
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:50,300
Excuse me, Dr. Lefevre,
you're in psychiatry, correct?

605
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:51,468
Yes.

606
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,678
Can I help you?

607
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,262
I'm Pearl Andreas.

608
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,264
I just have a quick question.

609
00:32:56,392 --> 00:33:02,145
My brother is a patient here but
they don't know what's wrong.

610
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:07,943
And I just read in a textbook
about Broken Heart Syndrome.

611
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,987
Is it a real ailment?

612
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,271
Have you ever seen it?

613
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:12,614
Oh, yes.

614
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,158
First hand at the V.A.
after Vietnam.

615
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:17,786
Most internists wouldn't even
consider it.

616
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:19,371
They're so stubborn.

617
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,498
But, after a powerful
and tragic event,

618
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,959
the body can release all kinds
of stress hormones

619
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,003
that can deregulate
the entire system.

620
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:30,465
Powerful and tragic event
like your brother dying?

621
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,217
That could do it.

622
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:35,971
Dr. Ganyon is his internist?

623
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,131
I'll talk to him.

624
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,633
If you're right, a cocktail
of sedatives and a medication

625
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:44,312
that treats PTSD might do
the trick and stabilize him.

626
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,481
But the most important thing,

627
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:50,310
this kind of stress and shock
weakens the immune system.

628
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:53,321
It makes a patient very
vulnerable to infections

629
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:57,317
so the patients need
to be soothed.

630
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,536
Soothed how?

631
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:03,656
The best way is being around
family and loved ones.

632
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,876
Being around what's familiar.

633
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,337
Psychology, pick up line 1.
Psychology, pick up line 1.

634
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,147
What are you doing?

635
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,818
Was Mama Dede here?

636
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,279
Yes.

637
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:37,282
I hoped she could give me
some answers.

638
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,617
Right.

639
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:50,879
In life, when something's wrong
like this,

640
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:54,466
you can't afford to rule out
any possibilities,

641
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,427
however remote.

642
00:34:57,513 --> 00:35:00,097
I can't let anyone else
get hurt.

643
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,224
I've already lost Jean

644
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:05,218
and I can't bear the thought
of anything bad happening

645
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:09,731
to Pierre, your dad or you
because of what I've done.

646
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:13,110
Mama, even if these things
are true,

647
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,904
what could you have possibly
done to have killed Jean

648
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:18,657
and make Pierre sick?

649
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:21,243
I don't know.

650
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,621
There's so many things
it could be.

651
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,740
I don't have a clue
which it is,

652
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:30,335
but I know in my gut
that Mama Dede

653
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,912
is the one who can help me
figure it out.

654
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:35,248
Mom, come on.
Come with me.

655
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,633
I spoke to the doctor and-

656
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:43,256
The doctors are doing their work
and I'm doing mine.

657
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,599
And tonight-

658
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:45,976
Not the cemetery.

659
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,019
I need to talk to the dead

660
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:51,106
to see what forces
are behind all of this.

661
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:56,778
Mama, this stuff,
it's ridiculous.

662
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,780
That's what you think.

663
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,283
Fine.

664
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:13,170
If you go then
I'm going, too.

665
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,623
It's dangerous there at night.

666
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:19,092
You shouldn't be alone.

667
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,810
Meet me downstairs at30.

668
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,189
And don't tell your father.

669
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,108
I wouldn't know how.

670
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:06,223
Mom.

671
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,814
Oh, dammit.

672
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,043
Mama.

673
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,756
Everything will be okay soon.

674
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,179
What did you just do?

675
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,591
Nina spoke to me.

676
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:35,520
Because I turned my back on
the past and showed pride,

677
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,431
the curse has gained power.

678
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:42,944
No, Pearl, this is real.

679
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:47,157
To save Pierre I need to find
out what's causing this curse,

680
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,742
whom it's coming from,

681
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:53,446
and then make amends to zap it
of its power and fury.

682
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,914
I just don't know where
to start.

683
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,793
Mama, let's get you home.

684
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,304
So this new doctor on
Pierre's case, Dr. Lefevre,

685
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:21,307
she says it's too early
to get our hopes up

686
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,235
but Pierre seems
to be stabilizing.

687
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,988
Our spiritual work
is helping.

688
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:32,702
When I spoke to her,
Dr. Lefevre said

689
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:35,830
that it'd be good
to have family around,

690
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,791
and things that feel familiar.

691
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,168
Maybe we can bring
some clothing of Jean's,

692
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,754
and some of his favorite toys.

693
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,715
And then you can come
to the hospital with us, Mama.

694
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:47,217
Okay?

695
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,178
He's getting better.

696
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:54,891
You don't have to worry
about this... thing now.

697
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:03,566
You don't understand, Pearl,
but you'll see.

698
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,878
Dad, I'm heading back
to the hospital!

699
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,380
Okay, hon!

700
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,187
Mama, where are you going?!

701
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,105
No!

702
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,193
Mama!

703
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,905
Whoever's driving that car,
stop, now!

704
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,128
Mama's gone off in a car with
some people from the Bayou.

705
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,672
Dad, I'm really worried.

706
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,341
What is this?

707
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,427
It's a letter she wrote us.

708
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,806
"As a woman of science,
Pearl,

709
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:18,925
"you know actions
cause reactions,

710
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:21,427
"and Jean's death
and Pierre's illness

711
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:24,689
"are the result of some action
of mine in the past.

712
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:28,985
"What exactly that is,
I don't know... yet.

713
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,937
"But I have to find out.

714
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:35,283
"And to do that I have to open
myself up to the past.

715
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,537
"I have to go back to the Bayou
and relive it.

716
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:44,617
"Only then will I know
what's cursing us.

717
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:48,004
"And only then will I be able
to atone for it."

718
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:55,887
"I know you don't
understand this,

719
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,972
"but please allow me
to finish my work

720
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:01,100
"without coming to find me."

721
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:14,480
"And if I don't return,
if the fates have it,

722
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,649
"should that I must move on
from this world,

723
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,493
"please know this.

724
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:25,500
"I love you, Pierre, and your father with all my heart."

725
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,828
What does that mean?

726
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:31,381
"If I don't return."

727
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:37,345
Could she be in danger?

728
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:39,430
What if she sacrifices herself.

729
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:41,266
You think she would do that?

730
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:44,352
Dad, she's distraught and
that's what she believes.

731
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,479
We have to find her.

732
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:49,357
If something happens
to her...

733
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,234
Pierre needs her.

734
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:54,862
This family needs
to stay together.

735
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,365
If she's going back through
her past where would she start?

736
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,866
At the beginning.

737
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,201
At the Landry shack.

738
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,620
You're not actually thinking
about helping her, are you?

739
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:03,696
I'm gonna make sure
that she's okay

740
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,540
and that she comes back
for Pierre.

741
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,459
Dad! Come on!
Let's go.

742
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,382
Dead end.

743
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,134
She's not here.

744
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,761
Hard to imagine
that she lived here

745
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:19,929
but she did.

746
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:20,930
With Paul?

747
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:23,224
Until he built Cypress Woods.

748
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:25,935
Do you think that she was
actually in love

749
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:27,478
with her half-brother?

750
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:29,722
That's not something
I wanna answer for her.

751
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,108
So she was with him
when she met you.

752
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,277
They had already broken up
because she found out

753
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:37,488
the truth about him
and how they were related.

754
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:39,991
When your mom and I
met we...

755
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:44,954
well, it was only a short time
before I was sent away.

756
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,125
She was pregnant with you
and alone and desperate,

757
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,586
so I don't think she had a
choice but to go back to Paul.

758
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:54,422
She says he was trying
to warn me.

759
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,965
Warn her.

760
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:57,842
I don't know.

761
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,929
Maybe we should go
to Cypress Woods next.

762
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,956
This place has seen better days.

763
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,302
Hey!

764
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:44,639
This is private property.

765
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:47,433
Belonging to Mrs. Ruby Dumas.

766
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,185
I know.

767
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,311
I'm John.

768
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,480
I work for Southern Oil.

769
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,524
I'm doing a survey here
for the new wells.

770
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:55,775
The company rents me
an apartment

771
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,360
in an old manor next door.

772
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,570
Have you been here long?

773
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:01,364
A couple hours.

774
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,533
We're looking for my mom.

775
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,317
This woman.

776
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:07,987
Have you seen her?

777
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:11,323
No one's come or gone
that I saw.

778
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:12,792
Is there any phones nearby?

779
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,669
I need to call my wife's friends
in the area.

780
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:17,329
Yeah, I got one in my place.

781
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:18,923
It's close.

782
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:26,139
So, you're Pearl Dumas, huh?

783
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:26,806
Hmm?

784
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,725
Oh.

785
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,342
Yes.

786
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:31,519
You know who I am?

787
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,847
Of course, your family is
well-known around here.

788
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,515
And I've been working the rigs
in this parish long enough

789
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,018
to know just about everybody.

790
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,519
I heard about how beautiful
your mother is,

791
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:42,947
which I see she's passed on.

792
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,116
Not to overstep.

793
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,702
Just pointing out a fact.

794
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:50,029
And of course your grandmére,

795
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,831
I heard about what a talented
traiteur she was

796
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:55,084
and how many people
she healed.

797
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,003
So I've heard.

798
00:45:58,298 --> 00:46:02,759
You're planning on studying
medicine, right?

799
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,428
Word gets around here.

800
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:08,806
I can tell you're gonna be
a fine doctor one day.

801
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,517
Pearl, we have to go.

802
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:12,384
What's wrong?

803
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,561
I just talked to the hospital

804
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,773
and Pierre has taken a turn
for the worse.

805
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,065
Thank you for your help

806
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:20,985
and if you see or hear anything
regarding my wife

807
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,445
please just call me at home

808
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,071
or at Broadmoor Hospital.

809
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:25,615
I sure will.

810
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,325
Dad, look.

811
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:31,037
It's Mom
and Mama Dede.

812
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:35,541
Poppa!

813
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:38,077
Are you okay?

814
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:39,411
Can you call 911?

815
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:40,379
Yeah.

816
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:41,881
Poppa, it's gonna be okay.

817
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,257
It's okay.

818
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:48,387
How are you feeling?

819
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:51,098
Do you remember anything?

820
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:54,927
Mr. Andreas, your radius
and ulna are shattered.

821
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,262
Compound fractures,

822
00:46:56,356 --> 00:46:59,315
which means you need surgery
and hardware put in tonight.

823
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,942
It's a lengthy operation

824
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:02,819
so he'll be out the rest
of the night.

825
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:08,324
Dr. Jameson to ICU.
Dr. Jameson to ICU.

826
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,743
I'm so sorry.

827
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:13,445
I'm failing you.

828
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,790
I'm failing this family.

829
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,668
Miss Andreas?

830
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:19,952
Could you come with me?

831
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,505
We need to discuss
your brother.

832
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,884
Dr. Stuartson to Ward 12.
Dr. Stuartson to Ward 12.

833
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:34,559
I don't understand.

834
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:35,935
I thought he was recovering

835
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,854
with the medication
Dr. Lefevre gave him.

836
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,313
He was.

837
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,649
But, as I had feared, his
immunocompromised state

838
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:46,979
has left him vulnerable to
a serious systemic infection.

839
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:48,281
Sepsis?

840
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:49,824
Exactly.

841
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:51,826
The problem is,
the infection he has,

842
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:55,830
the bacteria is resistant
to most of our antibiotics.

843
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:58,332
But there's still some
that can work.

844
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,167
There is one that might work.

845
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:02,003
It's an IV antibiotic
that we seldom use

846
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,921
because of the serious
side effects,

847
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:06,048
particularly to a patient
already weakened,

848
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:07,925
so it could do him more harm
than good.

849
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:09,668
But it's our best shot
at keeping him alive

850
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,337
and we have to move quickly,

851
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:14,673
so with your mother not here
and father incapacitated,

852
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:16,675
I need your consent.

853
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:17,852
Mine?

854
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,688
As next of kin it's your
decision whether we try it.

855
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,189
Your call.

856
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:28,446
I trust you.

857
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,324
I'll have the nurses
set up the IV.

858
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,915
Do you still think that
having family around

859
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,750
will make him stronger?

860
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:44,378
It's more important now
than it ever was.

861
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,589
Where's your mother?

862
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:52,878
A mother is the closest
connection for a boy of his age.

863
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:54,380
She really needs to be here.

864
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:55,389
I'm working on it.

865
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:56,682
Excuse me.

866
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:57,725
Pearl Dumas?

867
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,551
There's a call for you.
His name is John?

868
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:01,687
If you want I can
put it through.

869
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,728
Hello?

870
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,063
I saw your mother
in a car.

871
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,698
I think I know where
they're headed.

872
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,116
That's great.

873
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:15,159
I'll come pick you up.

874
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:16,744
Okay.

875
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:31,300
My grandmére's grave.

876
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:34,428
Someone must have
been here.

877
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:35,346
Your mom?

878
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:36,639
Must be.

879
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,809
Okay. Where next?

880
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,644
I don't know.

881
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:44,596
Your guess is as good as mine,
though it's late.

882
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:46,649
She has to be staying somewhere.

883
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,268
Cypress Woods.

884
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:52,196
She told my dad that she
and Paul were happiest there.

885
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:53,906
Okay. Let's go.

886
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,236
Mom?

887
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,114
Mama?

888
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,329
This doesn't really seem like
the kind of place

889
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:52,506
a lady would stay.

890
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:55,000
I saw pictures of this place.

891
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,053
It used to be beautiful.

892
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:00,139
Mama?

893
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,143
She's gone.

894
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:10,274
But she stopped here.
Look, handprints.

895
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:16,489
They must be hers, which means
she might come back.

896
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,538
I think I'm gonna stay here
for tonight.

897
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:26,082
Thanks for your help.

898
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,366
Stay here?

899
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,543
There's thieves and vandals
out in these parts.

900
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,045
What about them?

901
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:32,505
It isn't safe.

902
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:40,379
Okay, then I'll stick around,
crash on the couch.

903
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:42,214
You know, protect you.

904
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,183
Who says I need protecting?

905
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:52,024
Don't move.

906
00:51:58,116 --> 00:51:59,365
Hold on.

907
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:15,214
How did you know for me
to stop moving?

908
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:16,632
They only bite in defense.

909
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,918
When their webs are disturbed
or they're scared.

910
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:20,752
Thank you.

911
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:22,847
Oh, no. You got it covered.

912
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:24,974
No need for help from me.

913
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:41,448
Scared of all the noises?

914
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:45,119
No.

915
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:47,121
I just don't want you to be.

916
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:21,864
Are you okay?

917
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:26,202
Yeah, it's just...

918
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,245
Could we um...

919
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:33,709
We could keep
each other warm.

920
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:38,756
Oh, okay.

921
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,758
Morning.

922
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,585
We should start looking again.

923
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:09,013
Okay.

924
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:11,056
Where to first?

925
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:14,977
To see my Aunt Jeanne.

926
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,428
This is about Paul.

927
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:20,607
He is survived by his mother,
Gladys, and my Aunt Jeanne.

928
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:25,821
I think whatever is happening
it... it has to do with them.

929
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,114
How do you know that?

930
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:29,575
It's just a gut feeling.

931
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,826
Okay.

932
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:38,834
My, my.

933
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:42,338
For a second I thought
you were Ruby Dumas.

934
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:44,631
It's the town drunk.
Let him be.

935
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,842
He might know something.

936
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:50,596
Buster Trahaw at your service.

937
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:51,847
You know my mom?

938
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,800
I worked for the family
for years.

939
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:56,685
So you're her daughter, huh?

940
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:58,145
Yes.

941
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,314
Have you seen her?

942
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:02,808
I heard she was back in town,

943
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:05,694
but I haven't seen her
for a while.

944
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,364
If you do,
would you find me?

945
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:10,115
With pleasure, ma'am.

946
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,152
Oh, look who it is.

947
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,704
Pearl, I'm so glad to see you.

948
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,289
It's good to see you, too,
Aunt Jeanne.

949
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:18,490
This is John.

950
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,042
He works for the oil company.

951
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:21,585
Come on in.

952
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,380
We just have some questions
about Paul.

953
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:30,502
He was in so much pain
after she broke up with him.

954
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:36,517
But, you know, half brother
and sister, it couldn't be.

955
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:38,227
But then they got
back together.

956
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:44,775
When your father was sent away
and Gisselle, that witch,

957
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:49,947
turned her against Beau,
yes, she took Paul back.

958
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,448
She used him...

959
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:57,246
for comfort and support,
and he knew it.

960
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:58,414
Don't listen to her.

961
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,416
She's just getting bitter
with old age.

962
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:03,001
Have you seen my mom?

963
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:04,670
I really think that she could be
in danger.

964
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:05,712
She is.

965
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,798
I know that for a fact.

966
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:09,374
How?

967
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:13,595
I have it on good authority
that she's cursed.

968
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:17,724
Owing to the fact
that she killed Paul.

969
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:18,600
Killed Paul?

970
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:21,186
No, Pearl, do not listen
to her.

971
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:22,312
Paul drowned.

972
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:23,397
No!

973
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:28,735
She had him wrapped around her
little finger so much...

974
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:33,699
it... drove him
to kill himself.

975
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,076
She knows it.

976
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:38,737
I gave her a little reminder.

977
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:40,038
What do you mean?

978
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:44,910
It was you who put that photo
of Paul in the album I made.

979
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:48,755
Now somebody has put
a curse on her.

980
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:50,883
So she'll die, too.

981
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:57,923
After she loses everything
and everyone she loves.

982
00:57:58,017 --> 00:58:00,058
If you haven't seen her

983
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:03,937
how do you know that she thinks
that there's a curse?

984
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:07,191
Mother, what did you do?

985
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:12,821
Fine, I did it. I put the hex
on Ruby.

986
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:19,161
And Ruby seeing that photo and
remembering what she did to him,

987
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,613
that was its beginning.

988
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:29,129
Now his pain can haunt her
and power my spell.

989
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:31,507
She didn't do anything wrong
to him.

990
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:33,383
If you don't believe me,

991
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:37,963
what makes you think that
after all of these years,

992
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:43,685
on the eve of the anniversary
of his death,

993
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:46,772
this isn't happening?

994
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,358
You think it's all random?

995
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:50,859
Hmm?

996
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:58,408
No. The moon and the stars

997
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:01,703
all the signs of heaven
and hell

998
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:06,708
have finally lined up
the same

999
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,504
as on that terrible day.

1000
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:16,385
And now the whole storm
of bad gris-gris

1001
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:19,221
is gonna blow back on her.

1002
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:21,515
Let's get going.

1003
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:22,849
We're done here.

1004
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:25,477
You'll see.

1005
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:30,065
There's a storm coming.

1006
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:43,287
I don't know much more
than you do,

1007
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:46,331
but after years round these
Bayou superstitions

1008
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:47,541
I do know one thing.

1009
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:51,295
If Ruby believes that the curse
that Mom put on her

1010
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:53,839
is fueled by Paul's pain

1011
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,341
then she's going to be trying
to make amends with him.

1012
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:59,678
She'll be trying to track down
his spirit and talk to it.

1013
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:02,797
Gladys is right about one thing.
A storm's coming in.

1014
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,800
We need to call it a day,
and get some place safe, okay?

1015
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:06,635
Okay.

1016
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:08,687
-Bye.
-Bye.

1017
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:18,822
There's no big storm yet.

1018
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,285
Are you hungry?

1019
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:26,872
No.

1020
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,957
If there's no big storm
then let's get going.

1021
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:31,501
Pearl, if we go out there
we'll get stuck.

1022
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:34,838
There could be flash floods.
It's not safe.

1023
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,665
And it's not letting up
any time soon.

1024
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:37,758
Fine.

1025
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,093
When the storm passes

1026
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:42,387
maybe we should start
with his grave first.

1027
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:43,597
I don't know.

1028
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:46,308
My aunt who was into this
kind of stuff used to say

1029
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,853
that spirits don't really
cling on to their graves

1030
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,690
but they're in the places
they felt their pain.

1031
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,405
Pearl, I gotta insist you eat.

1032
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:03,116
But I got options.

1033
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:06,370
What options do I have?

1034
01:01:06,497 --> 01:01:11,583
Spaghetti with tomato sauce
or...

1035
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:13,502
spaghetti with tomato sauce.

1036
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:16,871
I'll have it with the sauce.

1037
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:18,131
Perfect.

1038
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:19,758
Order coming right up.

1039
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:23,887
Do you uh, do you like things
being spicy?

1040
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,013
Pardon?

1041
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:29,726
Do you like spicy foods?

1042
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,520
Sometimes when I'm cooking pasta
just for me

1043
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:34,940
I put some hot sauce
in the sauce.

1044
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,942
How spicy?

1045
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,819
Not too spicy.

1046
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:42,823
Wanna try it?

1047
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:55,001
Come here.

1048
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:10,267
Mm-hmm.

1049
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:11,259
It's good.

1050
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:12,352
Yeah?

1051
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:48,764
It's okay if you don't want to.

1052
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:52,392
No, I want to.

1053
01:02:56,482 --> 01:02:59,316
I've never met anyone quite
like you, Pearl Dumas.

1054
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:02,611
I've never met anyone
like you.

1055
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:07,482
No other oil hands
with my charm?

1056
01:03:07,576 --> 01:03:10,577
Nobody else who makes me
feel safe.

1057
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,208
Wait a second.

1058
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:16,991
What's this?

1059
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:52,694
About last night...

1060
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:54,037
Yeah?

1061
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:59,251
That was my first time.

1062
01:03:59,962 --> 01:04:01,753
Darn.

1063
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,964
I wish I could have taken you
somewhere beautiful

1064
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:05,206
and made it more special.

1065
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,008
No.

1066
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:09,210
It was perfect.

1067
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:12,556
You made me feel things that I
didn't think I was capable of.

1068
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:14,808
What do you mean?

1069
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:15,976
I was starting to think

1070
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:19,312
that I wasn't capable of love
or passion.

1071
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:22,440
You are more passionate
than anyone I've ever met.

1072
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:25,402
And you've got brains
on top of it.

1073
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,197
Sometimes you just have
to find something

1074
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:32,993
that gives those two forces
their balance, you know?

1075
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:34,911
I think I found it.

1076
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:42,168
I'm late.

1077
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:43,503
I gotta go.

1078
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:45,797
One of your wells broke down.

1079
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:47,749
It's mine?

1080
01:04:47,843 --> 01:04:50,719
Then I can give you
the day off.

1081
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:52,053
Trust me, there's nothing
I'd want more

1082
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:57,851
than to stay here with you but
it wouldn't be fair to the team.

1083
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:00,103
I'll come back
as soon as I can.

1084
01:05:05,903 --> 01:05:08,820
Listen, be careful.

1085
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:10,405
Why?

1086
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,990
I don't know.

1087
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:13,366
This whole thing.

1088
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:15,160
Well, you're not believing
in curses now, are you?

1089
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,954
I don't know what
I believe now.

1090
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,624
What's changing your mind?

1091
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:25,211
Part of it... you.

1092
01:05:25,297 --> 01:05:27,964
And what happened
last night.

1093
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:31,426
It opened my eyes
to something.

1094
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:35,513
That there's so much more
to life than the surface.

1095
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,391
And I've seen it
before, too.

1096
01:05:38,477 --> 01:05:40,977
With Pierre.

1097
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:45,565
The fact that he's dying
from something so inexplicable.

1098
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:47,976
Broken Heart Syndrome.

1099
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:52,989
Just, it stretches the rational
mind to the point...

1100
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,534
just be careful.

1101
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:59,913
I'll come back as soon as
I'm done with work.

1102
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:02,207
I'm going to stay here
and read up more

1103
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:04,042
on the history
of Cypress Woods.

1104
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:05,794
Maybe it will help.

1105
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:07,253
Okay.

1106
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:18,890
Buster, right?

1107
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:20,392
Is everything okay?

1108
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:21,810
No, ma'am.

1109
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:23,395
I found your mama.

1110
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,397
But she's in terrible shape.

1111
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:27,065
What? What happened?

1112
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,650
Not sure.

1113
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:32,195
I found her unconscious near my
place on the shore of the Bayou

1114
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:33,613
bleeding from her head.

1115
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:34,990
My god.

1116
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:38,451
I took her back to her house
and laid her on the couch

1117
01:06:38,537 --> 01:06:41,121
but she's not waking up,
and I tried the doc,

1118
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:42,247
but he's out of town.

1119
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:43,957
Can you take me to her?

1120
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:45,917
Just give me a sec,
I'll grab my coat.

1121
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:57,637
Here we are.

1122
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:09,441
Where is she?

1123
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:10,900
That's what I've been
asking myself

1124
01:07:11,028 --> 01:07:14,487
for the past 20 years.

1125
01:07:14,573 --> 01:07:16,823
I... I don't understand.

1126
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:22,579
You see, your great granddaddy
promised me a wife.

1127
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:25,999
I paid for a wife.

1128
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,751
Paid for a wife?

1129
01:07:27,878 --> 01:07:30,086
Your mama.

1130
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:33,465
She was about your age.

1131
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,050
Okay, look.

1132
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:38,261
I... I don't know everything
that happened, but...

1133
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:41,422
All you need to know
is that I'm owed a wife

1134
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:43,808
and I'm gonna have me one.

1135
01:07:43,894 --> 01:07:46,686
And if it ain't gonna be Ruby
it's gonna be you.

1136
01:07:53,612 --> 01:07:55,770
Your mama was a fighter, too.

1137
01:07:55,864 --> 01:08:00,241
Had her chained to the bedpost
before she got away.

1138
01:08:00,327 --> 01:08:02,827
But that ain't happening
this time.

1139
01:08:02,913 --> 01:08:05,446
Help! Help!

1140
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:08,583
Nobody around here for miles.

1141
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:12,462
Trust me, you ain't getting out.

1142
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:17,550
I built this just for you.

1143
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:42,367
Don't kill me!

1144
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:43,993
Don't make me!

1145
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:45,203
You know I could drain
all your blood

1146
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:47,539
if I go a millimeter lower
and deeper.

1147
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:49,082
Right into the jugular!

1148
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:50,917
Okay, easy now.

1149
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:55,255
Get in the cage!

1150
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,881
Okay, okay!

1151
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:02,053
You can't run far enough.

1152
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:03,263
I'll find you!

1153
01:09:04,683 --> 01:09:06,015
I'll find you!!

1154
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:17,235
Hello? Hello?

1155
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,738
Please, please.

1156
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:21,906
Help!

1157
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,367
Pearl, Pearl, Pearl!

1158
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:25,359
It's me. It's me.

1159
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:26,411
It's me.

1160
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:28,705
Buster, he tried to...
oh, thank god it's you.

1161
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:29,664
What did that man do
to you?

1162
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:30,331
It was horrible.

1163
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:31,124
Did he, did he-

1164
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:32,667
No, no, thank god.

1165
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:34,210
I've been looking all over
for you.

1166
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:35,962
Thank god you're all right.

1167
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:52,553
He's already got a record,

1168
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:56,524
so he's not getting out of jail
any time soon.

1169
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:57,901
Good.

1170
01:10:01,156 --> 01:10:03,731
I'm so sorry I left you there
alone today.

1171
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:07,660
No, it's not your fault.

1172
01:10:07,746 --> 01:10:10,788
I went with him when my gut
told me not to.

1173
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:13,416
I should have listened
to my mom.

1174
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:17,245
John.

1175
01:10:17,339 --> 01:10:18,338
Look.

1176
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:21,007
Someone's there.

1177
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,888
It's my mom's car.

1178
01:10:32,187 --> 01:10:33,269
Mama?

1179
01:10:40,237 --> 01:10:41,602
Hello, dear.

1180
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,029
Mama, where have you been?

1181
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:46,616
Out here, trying to figure out
what dark cloud

1182
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:49,160
is hanging over us.

1183
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:52,280
You've had us all worried
to death.

1184
01:10:52,374 --> 01:10:55,208
I'm sorry. I know.

1185
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:57,210
And I know you don't
understand this,

1186
01:10:57,295 --> 01:11:02,298
but this is the only way
Pierre stands a chance.

1187
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,842
Mama, no.

1188
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:07,470
I do understand.

1189
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:08,972
Or at least I'm starting
to understand

1190
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:14,143
that I don't understand
everything.

1191
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:18,064
That's marvelous, sweetheart.

1192
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:19,774
As Grandmére Catherine
used to say,

1193
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,568
that's the first step
to wisdom.

1194
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:27,073
I just wish there was something
we could do.

1195
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,451
We found out about Gladys
and her-

1196
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:32,704
-Curse.

1197
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:35,156
Yes.

1198
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:37,658
She's riled up Paul's hatred
of me

1199
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:40,044
and used that anger
to power the hex.

1200
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,171
Hatred?

1201
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:44,215
But he loved you.

1202
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:48,836
Love is a funny thing.

1203
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,889
It sometimes turns to spite.

1204
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:54,350
You saw with Claude.

1205
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:57,178
Paul is nothing like Claude.

1206
01:11:57,272 --> 01:12:00,481
Even Poppa said
that he was kind,

1207
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:05,028
and that he owed him so much for
selflessly taking care of us.

1208
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:09,190
But that was until
your poppa came back.

1209
01:12:09,284 --> 01:12:13,453
And then Paul spiraled down.

1210
01:12:15,749 --> 01:12:21,085
I couldn't love him back
the way he wanted, and...

1211
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:23,037
it killed him.

1212
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:28,593
And now, out of spite,
on this night,

1213
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:31,212
when all the stars
and the moon line up

1214
01:12:31,306 --> 01:12:38,219
exactly the same as they did
on that night, so long ago,

1215
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:42,315
he wants to make us feel
the same pain.

1216
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,609
But it doesn't make sense.

1217
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:48,071
Well, you saw yourself
in your dreams.

1218
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:50,615
No.

1219
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:59,707
Mama, in my dreams he was
reaching out asking for help.

1220
01:12:59,793 --> 01:13:01,667
Help?

1221
01:13:01,753 --> 01:13:03,577
Yes.

1222
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:06,214
He said "help me".

1223
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:10,885
You have such good intuition.

1224
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,933
You have the gift.

1225
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,434
The gift?

1226
01:13:19,938 --> 01:13:25,483
If he's asking for help
then this isn't about hatred.

1227
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,568
It's about hurt.

1228
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:33,441
He's trapped here
by his love for us

1229
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:37,662
and only I can set him free.

1230
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,288
How will you do that?

1231
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:41,541
With this painting.

1232
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:43,876
And Mama Dede.

1233
01:13:43,962 --> 01:13:47,672
We need to show him
what he meant to me.

1234
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,053
How can we help?

1235
01:13:54,139 --> 01:13:57,849
Well, I'll need more light.

1236
01:13:57,934 --> 01:13:58,975
More paints.

1237
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:01,978
Oh, and turpentine.

1238
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,299
It's done.

1239
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:42,018
Oh, my god.

1240
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:46,355
It looks almost exactly like
how I saw him in my dreams.

1241
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:48,858
I painted his face
from memory.

1242
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,234
What's next?

1243
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,112
We find out where Mama Dede
wants to meet.

1244
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:56,407
We gotta get this done tonight.
Time is running out.

1245
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,631
Mama You have
the painting.

1246
01:15:14,052 --> 01:15:15,593
Let me see.

1247
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:19,555
Oh, Ruby.
It's beautiful.

1248
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:20,890
Do you think it'll work?

1249
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:23,142
It's the spitting image of him.

1250
01:15:23,228 --> 01:15:24,185
And what's more,

1251
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:27,396
your soul shines through
every brush stroke.

1252
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:29,056
Your spirit reaching out
to his

1253
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:32,360
through this symbol
of your love.

1254
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:41,202
What's next?

1255
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:45,957
Well, now we have to give Paul
another send off.

1256
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:47,792
A proper one this time,

1257
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:50,545
which in essence means
we rebury him.

1258
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:51,629
Are you gonna dig him up?

1259
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,923
Oh no, child,
not literally.

1260
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:56,676
That's a felony in Louisiana.

1261
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:59,086
We do it metaphorically now,

1262
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,681
which means your mama
has to tell him goodbye,

1263
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:03,182
and when she does so she-

1264
01:16:03,268 --> 01:16:06,477
I have to open up
to the past.

1265
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:08,354
My past.

1266
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:13,109
And tell him the truth.
That I loved him.

1267
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:15,269
Because I really did.

1268
01:16:15,363 --> 01:16:19,198
And if he accepts this,
if he understands this,

1269
01:16:19,284 --> 01:16:24,612
he'll go on and let go,
and the curse will be lifted.

1270
01:16:24,706 --> 01:16:26,455
And all the bad stuff
will stop happening?

1271
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:29,625
One hopes.

1272
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:37,008
But the smoke needs to rise
right at midnight.

1273
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:38,292
Why is that?

1274
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:41,554
That's the time between
the living and the dead.

1275
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,313
It's time.

1276
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:54,734
It's now or never.

1277
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:06,487
I'm sorry I tried to forget.

1278
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:09,915
I can't imagine how much
that hurt you

1279
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:13,252
and I don't have any way
to make it better

1280
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:17,340
except by being honest
about it.

1281
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:23,721
I painted this to show you that
I still remember every detail.

1282
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:28,676
I've opened my soul up to it
and the fact that I loved you

1283
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:32,521
in some way that perhaps
wasn't right,

1284
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:35,358
but that was
nevertheless real.

1285
01:17:38,613 --> 01:17:41,405
I loved you, Paul.

1286
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:44,033
I still do.

1287
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:49,497
But now I have to let go
and so do you.

1288
01:17:58,675 --> 01:18:01,709
I know it will be hard,

1289
01:18:01,803 --> 01:18:05,546
but it's holding you back
from where you're meant to go.

1290
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,891
From the peace you're going
to have.

1291
01:18:10,103 --> 01:18:12,103
Let me help you.

1292
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:17,900
Paul, my love.

1293
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:19,860
Go.

1294
01:18:21,656 --> 01:18:23,531
Be free.

1295
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:46,178
And Paul, tell Jean
what to do.

1296
01:18:46,264 --> 01:18:49,140
Tell him to release Pierre.

1297
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:53,427
That they'll be together again
one day

1298
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:57,189
when the time is right,
long from now.

1299
01:19:08,745 --> 01:19:10,619
What just happened?

1300
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,582
The past let go.

1301
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:17,418
Now we can move forward
with the present.

1302
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,003
Pierre.

1303
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:21,455
My baby boy.

1304
01:19:21,549 --> 01:19:22,923
We need to hurry.

1305
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:24,124
Yes.

1306
01:19:24,218 --> 01:19:27,428
Ruby, I have to tell
you something.

1307
01:19:29,015 --> 01:19:30,798
I saw in the flicker
of the flame

1308
01:19:30,892 --> 01:19:33,467
that Pierre may not make it.

1309
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:35,636
What?

1310
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:36,979
But the curse is lifted.

1311
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:40,474
The curse was just the beginning
of his tragedy.

1312
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:42,693
He lost his twin,

1313
01:19:42,779 --> 01:19:46,197
his dearest friend
to the other side.

1314
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:49,533
When souls are torn apart
like that they hold on.

1315
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:53,245
They cling together.

1316
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:57,917
If he makes it,
it's up to him now.

1317
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:58,492
But-

1318
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:01,170
But nothing.

1319
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:03,664
He may want to go
with his brother

1320
01:20:03,758 --> 01:20:05,007
or maybe, just maybe,

1321
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:10,179
he may want to stay here
with you and your mom.

1322
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:13,390
But it's his choice now.

1323
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,019
We better go.

1324
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:31,033
Mom, what happened tonight...

1325
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:32,326
I know.

1326
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:38,290
So much of life is a mystery.

1327
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,376
Who knows anything, really?

1328
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:42,962
I don't think anyone does.

1329
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:48,926
But honestly, it makes things
a little more exciting.

1330
01:21:04,694 --> 01:21:07,403
Pierre, my dear.

1331
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:11,073
Mama's here now.

1332
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:15,578
I'm so very sorry for not
being here earlier,

1333
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:19,790
but I had to make sure no more
harm could come to you.

1334
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,837
We're all here now.

1335
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,923
That's right.

1336
01:21:28,009 --> 01:21:31,802
You have me and your dad.

1337
01:21:31,888 --> 01:21:36,265
And you may have lost
your brother for now,

1338
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:40,769
but you have the most amazing
big sister who's here,

1339
01:21:40,855 --> 01:21:43,272
and she wants you to stay.

1340
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:49,353
This night is going
to be tough.

1341
01:21:49,447 --> 01:21:51,447
His system wouldn't take
any more of the antibiotics

1342
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:53,073
so we had to take him
off it.

1343
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:54,408
But the infection...

1344
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:57,077
What are his chances, doctor?

1345
01:21:57,163 --> 01:21:59,029
I can't say.

1346
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:02,958
It's just going to be his body
fighting to survive.

1347
01:22:03,044 --> 01:22:06,962
Oh, he has a spirit
in there.

1348
01:22:07,048 --> 01:22:12,343
He's fighting
and he's deciding.

1349
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,386
I can feel it.

1350
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:31,737
Excuse me, can you tell them
the IV has run out?

1351
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:35,741
Hon, it's not up
to you anymore.

1352
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:38,160
You have to relax.

1353
01:22:38,245 --> 01:22:39,370
Sit.

1354
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:40,454
Breathe.

1355
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:45,334
Grandmére used to say
this is the witching hour.

1356
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:49,254
The transitional phase
between the living and the dead.

1357
01:22:49,382 --> 01:22:51,382
This is when he'll decide.

1358
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,691
What is this thing?

1359
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:10,901
Where am I?

1360
01:23:10,987 --> 01:23:12,653
What day is today?

1361
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:14,488
It's a good day.

1362
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:16,573
It's one of the best.

1363
01:23:19,412 --> 01:23:22,454
And you have a cast.
What happened?

1364
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:24,957
Just your dad being clumsy.

1365
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:27,418
But no one's signed it.

1366
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:28,627
You know it's a tradition

1367
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:29,837
to have your cast signed
by someone.

1368
01:23:33,092 --> 01:23:36,593
That's a cute poem you did
on my cast there, hey?

1369
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:38,846
I wish Jean was here
to sign it.

1370
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:40,597
Why don't you sign it
for him?

1371
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:42,099
What would he say?

1372
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:44,810
Here.

1373
01:23:50,818 --> 01:23:52,568
Kick me?

1374
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:53,810
You little prankster.

1375
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:56,238
I have no explanation
for what happened,

1376
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:59,033
or how you beat the infection,
Pierre.

1377
01:23:59,118 --> 01:24:00,868
I've never seen anything
like it.

1378
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:02,745
You're a lucky boy.

1379
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:05,289
And lucky to have a sister
like you do.

1380
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:09,626
You folks take care.

1381
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:11,754
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Doctor.

1382
01:24:13,299 --> 01:24:14,882
Should we go?

1383
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,261
How was your first day?

1384
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:20,763
Thrilling.

1385
01:24:20,848 --> 01:24:21,930
And the drive?

1386
01:24:22,016 --> 01:24:24,767
Not bad, but ask me
after another eight years.

1387
01:24:24,852 --> 01:24:26,602
Maybe less.

1388
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:29,980
I found out today that I can
apply for an accelerated track

1389
01:24:30,066 --> 01:24:32,649
to finish undergrad
a year earlier.

1390
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:35,360
You just can't wait to finish,
huh?

1391
01:24:36,489 --> 01:24:38,572
I was thinking,

1392
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:40,574
maybe I could practice
in the Bayou.

1393
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:42,534
Sounds good to me.
I'm a country boy at heart.

1394
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:45,579
And hanging up my shingle
out there wouldn't be bad,

1395
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,206
like my grandmére.

1396
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,699
But you'll be a real doctor.

1397
01:24:49,794 --> 01:24:53,212
I have no doubt that she cured
plenty of people her own way.

1398
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:55,130
I'm sure she did.

1399
01:24:59,512 --> 01:25:01,804
Look at that sky.

1400
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:03,180
Wow.

1401
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:04,556
Heavenly.

1402
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:08,060
I always wonder why you see
such beautiful colors

1403
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:10,562
in the sky sometimes.

1404
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:12,022
Refraction.

1405
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:14,900
The angle of the sun
at the end of the day

1406
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:17,361
as opposed to midday

1407
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:21,824
splits up colors into a
beautiful rainbow of shades.

1408
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:29,623
You're just so stunning
inside and out.

1409
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:33,335
Brains, guts, beauty.
You have it all.

1410
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:44,221
It makes me so happy
that you decided

1411
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:48,225
to renovate Cypress Woods,
and bring it back to life.

1412
01:25:53,566 --> 01:25:54,982
It's gonna look amazing.

1413
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,150
I love it.

1414
01:25:56,235 --> 01:25:58,110
It will make a wonderful home
for the two of you.

1415
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:01,113
Wow, it's really coming along,
John.

1416
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,407
It's gonna look so cool.

1417
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,659
You can stay here on the
weekends during the school year.

1418
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:06,827
And, after you graduate,

1419
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:09,779
if you still decide you want
to practice out here.

1420
01:26:09,874 --> 01:26:12,082
There's no other way
I'd have it.

1421
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:17,296
I'm so glad you're making this
your home.

1422
01:26:17,423 --> 01:26:19,965
It feels like a commencement.

1423
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:22,801
The commencement
of a new journey.

1424
01:26:25,097 --> 01:26:27,723
I think we're gonna be okay.

1425
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:30,601
More than okay,
dare I say it.

1426
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:32,019
Good.
