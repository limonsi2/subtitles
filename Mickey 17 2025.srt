1
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,320
How did I survive that?

2
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,100
It was some damn fall.

3
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,540
Oh shit. My comms busted.

4
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,060
My thermals busted too.

5
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,080
I should have got snapped in
half and died on the way down.

6
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,380
Instead of slowly turning
into a meat popsicle.

7
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,620
Seymour!

8
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,400
Seymour! I'm down here!

9
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Seymour!

10
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,260
Mickey?

11
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,620
Seymour!

12
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,420
Seymour, I'm down here!

13
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:14,000
Mickey! Whoa!

14
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,160
You haven't died yet?

15
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,680
No!

16
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,980
Hold on.

17
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,550
Oh shit!

18
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,281
Your flamethrower's still good.

19
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,530
Not a single scratch.

20
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,866
It's a good thing I thought
to come down here.

21
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,251
Weapons will be happy to see this.

22
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,366
Yeah, I'm gonna turn this in, okay?

23
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,390
I can take it.

24
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,910
You're not mad, right?

25
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,530
That I'm just taking this?

26
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,850
I mean, it's not looking
very good for you, right?

27
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,351
Also, line only goes this far.

28
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,870
Uh-huh.

29
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,950
Yeah, I know.

30
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,050
We're cool.

31
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,931
You shouldn't have to take the risk, huh?

32
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,411
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

33
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,991
Plus, they're gonna reprint
you back out tomorrow anyway.

34
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Yeah.

35
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,430
Hey, Mickey.

36
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,330
Yeah?

37
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,711
What's it feel like to die?

38
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,661
I'm sure you're used to it by now.

39
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,620
Still.

40
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:34,621
Still.

41
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,530
How many times is this?

42
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,560
You're Mickey 16?

43
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
17.

44
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,620
Jerk.

45
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,020
18 after this one.

46
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,900
Well, it's nice knowing you.

47
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Have a nice death.

48
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,260
See you tomorrow.

49
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,110
Oh, great.

50
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,250
Why not?

51
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,620
That's a pretty big one.

52
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,760
Hopefully, I'll just get
swallowed in one go.

53
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,440
It's gotta be better than
slowly freezing to death.

54
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,060
I guess.

55
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,520
Or maybe not.

56
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,380
But they just printed me
out again every time I died.

57
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,400
All my data is saved and I
just get a whole new body.

58
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,273
They do all this kind of regular
uploads of memories and

59
00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:14,320
my personality traits and
re-implant it back in my brain.

60
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,840
That's some crazy technology, man.

61
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,700
Let's just say it's advanced.

62
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,450
It's very advanced.

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,280
Come on.

64
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Wait.

65
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,080
Just hold on a second.

66
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,260
Just like, you know, calm down.

67
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,740
Just relax.

68
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,120
Breathe.

69
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,540
That's right.

70
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Breathe.

71
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,855
The whole body printing and memory transplanting thing,
to be honest, was so ridiculously ahead of its time

72
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:55,940
that it caused so many, like, ethical fights and religious
blah blah blah that it was actually banned on Earth.

73
00:05:55,941 --> 00:06:00,860
And they only allow it now in
outer space for expandables like me.

74
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,961
So from the second we
left the atmosphere, they

75
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:06,440
made me work my ass
off all the way to this planet.

76
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,120
Gave me one mission after another.

77
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,580
Uh, Tech?

78
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
What's going on?

79
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,140
The extra cable's here already.

80
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,960
Um, the thing is, Mickey...

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,620
Hey, Medical, you wanna tell him?

82
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
Tell me what?

83
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,520
Hi, Mickey. How you doing? Um...

84
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,360
Are you experiencing any
vertigo, nausea, or dizziness?

85
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,700
Uh, I guess I am feeling a little dizzy.

86
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,920
It's only gonna get worse from
here, Mickey, with a nice fever, too.

87
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,538
Truth is, you're exposed to
unthinkable levels of radiation

88
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,660
right now, which is why we
sent you out in the first place.

89
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,420
Okay.

90
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,696
If you could give us a full
description of your symptoms.

91
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,260
So, a couple things I wanna go
through on our cosmic radiation checklist.

92
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:55,500
First, how long until
your skin starts to bleed?

93
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,620
Then, how long until you go blind?

94
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,260
And of course, how long until you die?

95
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,320
That's the real nut we're after.

96
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,900
There was this one time in my fourth grade
science class, I messed with a lab frog.

97
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,860
I just figured this all
must be my punishment.

98
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,380
Mickey, take off your glove so I can see
what's happening under your space suit.

99
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,210
Oh! Oh!

100
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,490
Wow! Did you see that?

101
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Good morning.

102
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,790
Good morning.

103
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,600
Keep yourself hydrated, Mickey.

104
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,660
You'll start to feel extremely parched.

105
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:14,060
Arkady, I think the dose was too high.

106
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,780
Who cares, Dorothy?
He's gonna be dead in ten minutes.

107
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,820
Just focus on getting
all the blood samples.

108
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,560
He's gonna bleed through his
eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and rectum.

109
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,700
Make sure to collect separate
samples from everyone.

110
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,580
Okay? And keep the memory
upload going at the same time.

111
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,740
This Mickey's special.
You know that, right?

112
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,940
Out of all the Mickeys, you
will have the shortest life span.

113
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,980
I heard.

114
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,840
Terminus.

115
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,720
Well, aren't you any good news?

116
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,400
Smaller than 15. Much better, isn't it?

117
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,636
I would have been filthy rich
by now with life insurance,

118
00:08:51,648 --> 00:08:54,760
except I have obviously
expendables or uninsurance.

119
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:59,600
There's no workers' comp,
no unions, no pension benefits.

120
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,068
Now, I wouldn't be surprised
if you were thinking at

121
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:06,180
this point, well, then why
did you do this to yourself?

122
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,938
Well, because I had a
friend who told me that

123
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,800
one day macarons would
sell better than burgers.

124
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,924
And because I trusted
this shitty friend and I

125
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:25,580
got an enormous loan from a wonderful
gentleman to open a macaron store.

126
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,740
All right, all right, calm down.

127
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,860
I'm well aware that
you have four weeks left.

128
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:06,900
Just think of this
as a little field trip.

129
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,660
Taste of what may unfold should you
fail to reimburse us in a timely manner.

130
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,500
Besides, you two have a
lot of time on your hands.

131
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,620
With your little macaron shop gone under.

132
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,140
Woo! This is, uh, this is quite a show.

133
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,150
You got on here for me. Quite a show.
The message is clear. I hear you.

134
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,290
I hear it loud and clear. I'm late.
I'm late. The money is late. It's coming.

135
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,120
Darius Blank.
A name I wish I'd never heard.

136
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,500
Mr. Blank is no less concerned with money.
He has plenty.

137
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,330
This building is just
one of his many assets.

138
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,741
Watching his delinquent
borrowers die, savoring

139
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:45,620
the details of death,
that he truly enjoys.

140
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,736
The message is clear. You can stop now.
We can stop. You know, it's, it's, it's...

141
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,620
I hear you. Two, you
know, two weeks, uh,

142
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:53,640
two weeks is all it
takes. All it takes now.

143
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:57,300
And, and, and, and, more time.
More time. More money. More money.

144
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,860
Who caught that gentleman four
days ago at Ulaanbaatar? Mongolian?

145
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,020
Looks expensive.

146
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,637
Best assured, anyone
who misses the deadline,

147
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:18,980
we chase them to
the ends of the Earth.

148
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,820
So we decided to get off of Earth.

149
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,360
Nothing was working out,
and I got no family lying on me.

150
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,563
So I applied to the colony
expedition, but there's,

151
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:33,800
like, a million other
people with the same idea.

152
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,540
Seems like the whole of this rotten
planet was running away from something.

153
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,380
I guess everybody's got money problems.

154
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,300
But anyway, we had to get on this ship,
because it was the last one of the season.

155
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,580
Waves upon waves of people
desperate to leave Earth.

156
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:52,760
It's clear anti-migrationists are
talking to a brick wall when they insist...

157
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,220
...on fixing up the Earth instead of risking
lives by migrating to another planet.

158
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,040
It feels like these passionate
applicants are already off in space.

159
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,354
More importantly, this
is the expedition led

160
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:08,840
by former Congressman
Kenneth Marshall...

161
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,200
...who lost his last two elections.

162
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,800
Is this failed politician now trying to
establish a kingdom beyond the stars?

163
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,660
Is it his fanatical supporters who
won him a generous sponsorship...

164
00:12:21,661 --> 00:12:24,820
...from a particular religious
organization and corporation?

165
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,840
So many questions left unanswered.

166
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,360
Let's go and talk to the crowd.

167
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,000
Excuse me, are you a
Kenneth Marshall supporter?

168
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:34,320
I am. I am. Big time.

169
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,960
I am a full-on supporter.
I basically am the one and only.

170
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,320
Are you from Marshall's official channel?

171
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,860
No way!
So Marshall's watching this right now?

172
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
Oh, my God!

173
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,560
You need to pick me.
I swear. Please, pick me.

174
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:50,200
You need people young and healthy...

175
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,140
...and gentlemen, we have
another wild sandstorm today.

176
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,500
Access is now restricted to game three.

177
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,680
Please visit our stand for
discounted goggles and masks.

178
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,060
Additional 5% off with
Marshall Pay, as always.

179
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,560
The other expeditions wouldn't
take me, but they're wrong.

180
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,540
I promise I can fix toilets.
I make gingerbreads.

181
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,981
You've got to take me, Commissioner.

182
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,350
Expendable.

183
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,790
You're applying to be an expendable?

184
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,570
Seriously?

185
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,320
You read through the whole application?

186
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,490
Uh, yeah.

187
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,130
I should have read through it.

188
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,050
I mean, I didn't have too much of a choice.

189
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,310
I don't have any bona fide certifications.

190
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,470
I don't really have any skills whatsoever.

191
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,125
But then I find out
Timo's already called dibs

192
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:52,530
on a position for
himself as a flitter pilot.

193
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,070
He only just got his learner's
permit a couple of weeks before.

194
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,230
No idea what he had to
come up with to pull that off.

195
00:14:01,195 --> 00:14:02,515
But you've got to give it to him.

196
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,510
Excuse me.

197
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,490
Is there, like, some construction going on?

198
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,870
Sorry, what?

199
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:13,010
I don't hear like a...

200
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:16,470
like a chainsaw.

201
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,130
Uh, no.

202
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,200
I want it to get the hell out of there.

203
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,370
Somewhere where the
sound couldn't follow me.

204
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,610
Far out into space.

205
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,590
You read through the paperwork?

206
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,090
Yes.

207
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:36,890
You read it, so you know, right,
this is gonna be a pretty extreme job.

208
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:39,870
But it's also gonna be... fun.

209
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,230
I'll explain all the details.

210
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,250
I got so distracted by that smell.

211
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,630
Uh, the smell of this woman's hair.

212
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:52,070
It was like it brought back some
faraway memory or something.

213
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,310
That giant tank downstairs
is called a cycler.

214
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,250
It takes organic waste
produced in the spaceship.

215
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:05,550
Apple peels, chicken bones, rotten eggs,
dead bodies, human waste, you name it.

216
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,830
Then it combines,
refines and recycles them.

217
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,650
And sends a portion to this printer.

218
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,430
Raw materials for a human body.

219
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,784
Once you die and the
committee approves, it'll

220
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:21,210
print a new version of
your body within 20 hours.

221
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Take your clothes off.

222
00:15:24,645 --> 00:15:25,645
Change into this.

223
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,390
I couldn't even hear
anything she was saying.

224
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,730
It was like all my senses
were focused on my nose.

225
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,590
Like real deja vu, but for a smell.

226
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,010
We're going to do a
full scan of your bio data.

227
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,290
That means you'll be reprinted
exactly as you are right now.

228
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,010
Forever.

229
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,210
I better pop this.

230
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,550
Otherwise it'll be there every time.

231
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,380
Well, I'm glad she didn't
know about the one on my butt.

232
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,960
So after she does the body
scan, she uploaded my memories.

233
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,680
Call it a personality backup.

234
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,428
And I gotta do this
once a week so I don't

235
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,880
have any big gaps every
time they print me out.

236
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,220
In the past, you would have
needed a hard drive the size

237
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:22,880
of a commercial refrigerator
to copy an adult brain.

238
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,730
Now this little brick.

239
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,140
Clever, right?

240
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,800
So I was injected with
some special solution.

241
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,620
It brought back a flood of old memories.

242
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,900
Too many memories.

243
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
We were heading home from the supermarket.

244
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,660
And I asked to sit in the front seat.

245
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,700
I said, I'm big enough.

246
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,120
And that's when I saw the red button.

247
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,080
And I just pressed it and she crashed.

248
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,200
Put it to your head and pull the trigger.

249
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,980
This is the final requirement
to become an expendable.

250
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,100
Prove to me you have faith in this system.

251
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,030
From now on you need to get used to dying.

252
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,220
This is your job.

253
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:08,970
I began the four and a half
year journey as Mickey One.

254
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,840
When you're stuck in a spaceship
for that long, food is everything.

255
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,140
Warning, Mickey One.

256
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,580
Seven calories over the
current ration allocation.

257
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,900
On that first day in the cafeteria,

258
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,800
I think I might have started thinking,

259
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,320
what have I done?

260
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,160
A little.

261
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,500
The whole room was full of
people eating this crappy food.

262
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,700
And there's total silence.

263
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,260
Like you could hear a pin drop.

264
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,000
Until Kenneth Marshall...
and his wife, Ilfa, walk in.

265
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,460
And a whole bunch of
people just started going nuts.

266
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,660
I was thinking, what
the hell am I doing here?

267
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,380
But that's when I saw her.

268
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,860
Nasha.

269
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,180
That was the first time
I saw Nasha Barrage.

270
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,860
On day one of this long journey.

271
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,760
Keep that up for one...

272
00:20:43,215 --> 00:20:46,430
That's two percent of the precious
meal you're eating right now.

273
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,243
As you know, our number
one priority is to conserve

274
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:53,170
food resources until
our arrival at Niflheim.

275
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,830
So that we maximize our survival rate.

276
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,030
So listen up.

277
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,130
Sexual intercourse, for example.

278
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:05,670
Each session consumes
a whopping 100 calories.

279
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,770
At least.

280
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:12,290
Depending on the participant's
duration times friction equals...

281
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,690
The point is, Kenneth is
talking to the committee

282
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,450
about banning all
sexual activity on the ship.

283
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Are you sure this is the
right time to bring that up?

284
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,080
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help you.

285
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,500
It's okay, Ilfa.

286
00:21:37,425 --> 00:21:38,500
Am I doing okay?

287
00:21:38,855 --> 00:21:40,100
Should I go harder?

288
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,540
Yes, yes. Go hard.

289
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,780
All right.

290
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,200
Fellow pioneers.

291
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,100
Once we've arrived at Niflheim and
we've secured our food production,

292
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:56,080
we will launch the greatest sex
encouragement campaign in history.

293
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,860
You will spread your
seed across the planet.

294
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,540
Even when it's restrictive,
you will always seafood.

295
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,520
NOW.

296
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:17,060
Formigating.

297
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,640
calidad to you.

298
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,200
Início.

299
00:22:22,201 --> 00:22:27,600
God bless um...

300
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,760
God bless...

301
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,820
God bless...

302
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,240
Those four years would have
felt like 40 if it weren't for Nasha.

303
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:04,760
She stayed with me in the best of times...
and kept by my side in the worst of times.

304
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,530
Not everyone gets lucky
enough to find a soulmate like this.

305
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,660
None of this would have happened
if I'd never boarded this spaceship.

306
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,830
So all hail the great
loan shark, Darius Blank.

307
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:24,505
Thanks, Darius.

308
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,146
But it wasn't like I was slack, you know.

309
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,090
I was super busy every
day taking care of Nasha.

310
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,890
She's an all-in-one elite agent.

311
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,117
And it's not easy
supporting someone who's a

312
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:39,950
soldier, a police
officer, and a firefighter.

313
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,690
But what she sees in me, I got no idea.

314
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,310
I'm just grateful.

315
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:50,450
But as soon as I step out the door,
the ship was filled with mostly dickheads.

316
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,090
Hey, Mickey, right?

317
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,690
Can we just ask?

318
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:00,190
What's it like to die?

319
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,790
You know, when you're reprinted?

320
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,410
Now, how does that feel?

321
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,290
Oh, come on, just tell us.
We really want to know.

322
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:13,150
Imagine spending years
elbow to elbow with these bozos.

323
00:24:13,555 --> 00:24:15,275
It was enough to push anyone over the edge.

324
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,290
Sometimes even if
Nasha, who is a model

325
00:24:19,302 --> 00:24:22,330
citizen, would have to
step in and remind us...

326
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:24,950
...that we were all one big happy family.

327
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,990
There to help one another.

328
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,890
There to have each other's backs.

329
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,590
A tight-knit, harmonious community.

330
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:40,410
...and the committee
has written about this.

331
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,330
Hey, Mickey.

332
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,370
You must be hungry. Have some more.

333
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,690
Uh, thanks, Kai.

334
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,850
Can you change your shampoo?

335
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,290
Shampoo?

336
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,210
There's only one shampoo in
this entire space. Thank you.

337
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:05,230
It was a very long trip
in a beautiful community.

338
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:05,810
Hi.

339
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:12,150
But, uh, Nasha was obviously
my one and only, you know.

340
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,590
For real.

341
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:22,210
And as for my one and
only job, I was proud of it.

342
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,430
I felt like I was part of the team.

343
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:28,830
Be careful.

344
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:29,970
Patty!

345
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,090
Travelers... And
sisters... And sisters...

346
00:25:43,091 --> 00:25:48,070
It is long that we have caught
four years together in this ship...

347
00:25:48,071 --> 00:25:51,690
...and that we love you
like our very own family.

348
00:25:52,130 --> 00:26:00,130
And here we are right below us
awaits our very own planet of purity...

349
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,650
What's fucking wrong with him?
It's fine, aren't it?

350
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,610
Maybe we have some glue or something.

351
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,710
Like a virgin vanilla ice cream.

352
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,430
Touched for the very first time.

353
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,930
It's gonna be really cold.

354
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,470
Whoever's gone down there
first is gonna freeze to death.

355
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,410
And then, make easy
breaths, fill your lungs,

356
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:32,990
and you're sucking in every single
microscopic particle floating around.

357
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,810
All the viruses.

358
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,110
Fill every avioli.

359
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,190
So good?

360
00:26:44,255 --> 00:26:45,255
Oh, so good!

361
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,450
Brilliant.

362
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,690
There really was an
unknown virus in the air.

363
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,830
A lethal one.

364
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,120
So fucking warm.

365
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,620
I'm fine.

366
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:10,540
In the end, thanks to the lab
rats Mickey 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16

367
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:14,480
getting stabbed, gasped, dumped,
and burned, we got the vaccine.

368
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,860
My great gift to mankind.

369
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,600
And so, we didn't need oxygen masks,

370
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,270
and we could see our
breath as much as we wanted.

371
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,340
Look at that, Jennifer. Ridiculous.

372
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,076
I can't believe we
still live in that thing.

373
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,100
I know, right?

374
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Planfall was ages ago.

375
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:35,020
And we're still eating the
same crappy in-flight TV dinner.

376
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,600
Precisely why we ought to
build residential complexes.

377
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,000
You know, grow crops as soon as possible.

378
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,740
Yeah, sure.

379
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,920
You know, spread the seed.

380
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,060
Infest the land.

381
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Propagate the species.

382
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,660
It's freezing.

383
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,070
Whoa.

384
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,590
Look at that color.

385
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,190
Yeah.

386
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,250
It's beautiful.

387
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,310
Oh.

388
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,130
Oh.

389
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,550
Oh.

390
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,110
He's such a klutz.

391
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,000
You should learn some Breakfall moves.

392
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:20,350
You okay?

393
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,770
Yeah, I'm fine.

394
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:22,890
Come on.

395
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,550
What's Breakfall?

396
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,380
What is it?

397
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,270
Come on, Mickey, let's go!

398
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,700
Go, go, go, go!

399
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,580
Mickey, Mickey, it's Marshall.

400
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,660
You fucking useless little asshole.

401
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
You're an expendable.

402
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,220
You're here to be expended.

403
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:38,700
Damn it!

404
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,280
I'm so sorry.

405
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:44,100
And why is Jennifer Chilton, a
precious, fertile female, dead and not you?

406
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,000
How do you train us?

407
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,000
You know?

408
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,400
Fuck you.

409
00:30:47,401 --> 00:30:47,860
Fuck you.

410
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,480
That's what I want to know.

411
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,520
Disgusting.

412
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,520
Really?

413
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,780
You don't like my sauce?

414
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,520
No, no, no, no, darling.

415
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,760
Those things.

416
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,480
Look at them.

417
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,640
What the fuck's going on?

418
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,980
They're delicious, aren't they?

419
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,336
Oh, for some reason, I like it.

420
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,840
Hey, you.

421
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,700
Stand still.

422
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,780
Don't move.

423
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
They lust.

424
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,960
For humans.

425
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:08,200
God.

426
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,201
You're a body of flesh.

427
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,180
Creepy.

428
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,560
Oh, honey.

429
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,740
That's perfect.

430
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,001
We should call them creepers.

431
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:18,025
I'll call them creepers.

432
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,040
I'm calling them creepers.

433
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,530
Preston, are you listening?

434
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,022
Expendable, I've decided
in the committee that

435
00:31:25,023 --> 00:31:28,381
going forward, your
rations will be halved.

436
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:33,408
So, my shift doubled,
14 hours every day, seven

437
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:37,401
days a week, until I brought
home a creeper sample.

438
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,020
How did I survive that?

439
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,620
What's it feel like to die?

440
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,150
Even on my 17th
go-round, I really hate dying.

441
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:04,890
Still. Always.

442
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Bon appétit.

443
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,720
Where am I? What's going on?
I'm not coming out of the printer.

444
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,020
I'm still 17.

445
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,200
Why didn't that thing eat me?

446
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,880
I was passed out.

447
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,780
Did I not look tasty enough?

448
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,120
Oh, I've got it.
They're saving me for their kiddos.

449
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:57,910
What a great mom.

450
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,200
Oh, please just make it quick.

451
00:34:02,935 --> 00:34:04,920
Come on, guys. Big bites. Big bites.

452
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Ow!

453
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,900
Where are you taking me now?

454
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Ow!

455
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,980
Has my meat gone bad
after all that reprinting?

456
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm still good meat!

457
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,580
I'm perfectly good meat!

458
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,090
I taste fine!

459
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,220
...

460
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
...

461
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,480
...

462
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,420
... ...

463
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
...

464
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,960
...ditching me out here
in the middle of nowhere...

465
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
...it's not cool!

466
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:27,080
...that rock is, are you blind? You can't
just have the other bat feuds through here!

467
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,560
Science requested it, so
don't give me shit about it!

468
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:34,860
You try to jam it in and scratch anywhere
on this date, my date, it's on you!

469
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,032
On me? How? Blame the
guys in science. They cut into

470
00:36:38,044 --> 00:36:41,200
this site, but I got specific
orders to bring it as is!

471
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,080
I don't fucking care, okay? Through the
meeting over there, I can't reach them.

472
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,401
I'm not taking the fall for
this. Every time you come in

473
00:36:48,413 --> 00:36:51,300
here, my gate, gate 3, you
act like you own the place.

474
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,160
Why would I wanna own this shit already?

475
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:54,560
You should shut the fuck up, okay?

476
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,120
You know what? You need to get laid.

477
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:56,760
Fuck you!

478
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,060
...you need to get laid. Fuck you!

479
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,200
Fuck you!

480
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:01,460
Oh damn, Nicky!
Didn't expect to see you out there today.

481
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,780
Wait, is that the time?

482
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
It's 3.30?

483
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,260
...it doesn't really make any sense.

484
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:18,180
...Do you remember what?
Do you remember when I left?!

485
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:19,300
What did you say?

486
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,580
...razón!

487
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,620
...shut it off!

488
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,240
...the maze!

489
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
...the switch!

490
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,745
It's that time again, the
dinner of your dreams,

491
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:45,780
with Kenneth Marshall,
who will be this month's

492
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:48,823
lucky guest of honour.
A grand surprise awaits.

493
00:37:48,835 --> 00:37:51,760
Hang onto your ship,
because the dove of luck

494
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,160
just might come fluttering its wings with
an invitation for you. From Dove with Love,

495
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
over and out.

496
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
What is this?

497
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,320
Why aren't you dead?

498
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:52,600
Oh God, oh God, oh God. No, no, no, no.
18? They printed you out today?

499
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,666
What the fuck is going
on? According to Timo, you

500
00:38:55,678 --> 00:38:58,980
should be sliding out on one of those
creeper's assholes right about now.

501
00:38:59,435 --> 00:39:00,596
You have to put it like that?

502
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,540
Oh God, I'm completely fucked.

503
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,380
What do you mean?

504
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,240
We're multiples.

505
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,640
I gotta kill you.

506
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,460
Kill me?

507
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,241
I mean, you should probably
kill yourself if one of us has to die.

508
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:37,280
It's been, like, two hours since I
was printed. I've barely had a life.

509
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:41,800
Well, I was never dead. So you don't count.
Go back to the cyclone!

510
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,620
Multiples. Where do I even begin?

511
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,467
Mankind is not equipped to
deal with the legal and ethical

512
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:56,480
implications of adopting this
human printing technology.

513
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,580
Please tell me.

514
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,280
Can any of you honestly guarantee
that the technology will not be abused?

515
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,760
No one in their R&D department
could come up with a convincing answer.

516
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:13,496
But the real problem was
that one of the brains behind

517
00:40:13,508 --> 00:40:16,480
human printing turned out
to be a certified psychopath.

518
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,900
Helen Manikova.

519
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,590
I think it's him.

520
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
Are you sure?

521
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:29,000
There was this series of particularly
brutal murders targeting homeless people.

522
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:31,220
And only one eyewitness account.

523
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,420
But it matched Alan
Manikova's appearance to a tee.

524
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:39,060
The cops thought they had their man,
except Manikova had a surefire alibi.

525
00:40:39,425 --> 00:40:41,234
At the time of the
murder, he was getting his

526
00:40:41,246 --> 00:40:42,946
makeup done for a
children's science show.

527
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,460
But the cops had his number.

528
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:55,300
When they raided Manikova's house, they
brought two sets of handcuffs and warrants.

529
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:56,810
They were on to him.

530
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,500
Or rather, they were on to them.

531
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,220
Which one's Manikova Prime?

532
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,080
You?

533
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,200
Or you?

534
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,160
Yep, there were two.

535
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,860
One for the murder, and one for the alibi.

536
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,180
Manikova had printed another
Manikova without the company knowing.

537
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,160
So here's a question for you.

538
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,280
Are they accomplices, or did
one act under the other's orders?

539
00:41:21,675 --> 00:41:26,260
Are these separate and independent crimes,
or were they one person from the get-go?

540
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,900
They only get half portions in jail, or...

541
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,400
they get a full meal each.

542
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:35,280
Police, legal experts,
philosophers, everyone was stumped.

543
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:40,160
But while Manikova One and Two were
both locked up in an interrogation room,

544
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,480
another homeless man was brutally murdered.

545
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,200
Lo and behold, Manikova Three.

546
00:41:55,745 --> 00:41:59,265
I think it was some cheap
tabloid reporter who called

547
00:41:59,315 --> 00:42:02,520
them multiples, or some
professor or something.

548
00:42:02,925 --> 00:42:04,360
Whoever came up with it, it stuck.

549
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:10,380
And pretty soon the word
multiples spread fear and contempt.

550
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,360
So multiples are an abomination.

551
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,381
They destroy the natural order.

552
00:42:14,775 --> 00:42:17,140
Each soul shall only have one body.

553
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,380
Right?

554
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,200
One soul, one body.

555
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,320
The Lord, he only blesses
this one-to-one union.

556
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,000
But former Congressman Marshall
does have a point worth considering.

557
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,820
It would be a shame.

558
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,540
Not to explore the potential
application of this advanced technology.

559
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:39,600
I was happy to receive an
invitation from this committee.

560
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,540
You were subpoenaed, Mr. Marshall?

561
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,800
Sure, sure.

562
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:49,980
In any case, I want to take this opportunity
to speak as an expedition commander.

563
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,940
Human printing is a sin.

564
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,900
Multiples are Satan's work.

565
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:02,241
However, I've been
contemplating how can we use

566
00:43:02,253 --> 00:43:05,780
this abomination for our
common economic benefit.

567
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:14,440
I propose a trial run of human printing far
from Earth under the strictest oversight,

568
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,891
limiting such individuals
to one per expedition

569
00:43:18,903 --> 00:43:22,220
per planet under the
designation expendable.

570
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,660
Multiples, in the case of multiples,

571
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,860
we exterminate every offending individual,

572
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:36,760
in totality, mind and body, all
for the sake of public service.

573
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,677
On this Niflheim
expedition, all multiples will

574
00:43:40,689 --> 00:43:44,760
immediately be arrested,
executed and permanently deleted.

575
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,280
Oh, man.

576
00:43:53,015 --> 00:43:55,220
What the hell is this guy?

577
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,760
Nasha told me that Mickey
3 was whiny and clingy,

578
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:06,280
5 was indecisive and apparently 8
was pretty annoying and kind of stupid,

579
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,880
but none of them were complete nut jobs.

580
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:13,560
Even this lunatic is scared
of being a multiple, though.

581
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,460
That's permanent deletion.

582
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,920
Trying to trash me in the cycler.

583
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,720
If one of us has to go...

584
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,920
it ain't gonna be me.

585
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,350
We can split the workload, too.

586
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,130
And we can take turns dying.

587
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:19,510
You're 18, so you can take even numbers,
and I'll just cover 19, 21 and odd numbers.

588
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,410
Are you afraid to die?

589
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:23,290
Kinda, yeah.

590
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:25,930
You've died plenty of times.

591
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:27,810
What are you so scared of?

592
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:32,210
Until now, I died
and... I was just...

593
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:33,590
born again.

594
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:34,830
You know?

595
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:38,790
It felt like it was me, continuing on.

596
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:40,630
But now...

597
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,570
once I die...

598
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,950
it'll be over for me.

599
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:50,050
It'll be you living on.

600
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:51,970
You get what I mean?

601
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,060
I don't like you.

602
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:05,880
You're such a little bitch.

603
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:07,940
But I'm you.

604
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,540
I'm not you.

605
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,140
I'm not gonna live like you.

606
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,880
I'm gonna kill you!

607
00:46:39,305 --> 00:46:40,390
What the fuck, man?

608
00:46:40,391 --> 00:46:41,591
Are you trying to get noticed?

609
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,050
They don't even have cameras.

610
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,230
Take that off, you dumbass.

611
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:46,630
Amateur.

612
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:47,930
Your first time.

613
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,030
No, no.

614
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,701
This is the pure stuff, right?

615
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:52,390
Undiluted?

616
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,001
Who do you think you're talking to?

617
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,010
This...

618
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:59,030
is pure uncut oxy.

619
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,050
It's fucking rare.

620
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,050
You only get two oxyzulfocapsules
and one flamethrower, man.

621
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:08,611
... ...

622
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:12,870
...

623
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:22,670
...

624
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,451
... ... ... ... ... ... ...

625
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:29,970
...

626
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,770
... ... ... Wait. Fact-checking.

627
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:39,810
Have fun, man.

628
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,570
Let's kill him.

629
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:43,770
Are you crazy?

630
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,850
He's like my only friend.

631
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:48,630
Forever.

632
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,190
Same warfare as this meat shit.

633
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:51,570
Wait, wait, wait.

634
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:55,270
Demo!

635
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,390
Mickey, what?

636
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,041
Looks like business is blowing up, huh?

637
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:00,671
What are you talking about?

638
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,010
Another junkie coming in.

639
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,070
Hey!

640
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,390
Are you mental?

641
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,610
Wait till I get out of
here or I'll kill you!

642
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:23,690
What the fuck is this?

643
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:26,530
Come down lower!

644
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,770
You fucking idiot!

645
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,010
Mickey, help me.

646
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:55,210
What is that?

647
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:56,786
Why is it so red? That looks hot.

648
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:58,910
What are you doing?

649
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,930
I want you to have a car dying.

650
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,840
You son of a bitch.

651
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:04,450
What?

652
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:06,350
Come on!

653
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:09,450
Stop!

654
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:10,590
Stop!

655
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:11,910
Shh, shh, shh.

656
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,940
Who's that, Mickey?

657
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:27,010
Hey, what's going on?

658
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,891
Mickey, what are you doing here?

659
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,100
Uh, Demo accidentally fell in.

660
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,160
But, uh... he's alright now.

661
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,720
I wanna keep dealing, motherfucker.

662
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,280
Watch what you say.

663
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,720
What happened?

664
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,340
You okay?

665
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,290
What's up with your hand?

666
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,460
Uh...

667
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,040
I was taking out the trash
and I tripped into the hole.

668
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:56,426
I would have been a
goner if not for Mickey.

669
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:57,680
I almost became a cyclodust.

670
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,740
Hey.

671
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,320
You alright?

672
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:05,261
Don't you stay in bed. It's only been
a few hours since you were printed.

673
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:06,260
Yeah, I should have died.

674
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,300
You heard the rumor?

675
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:08,580
Huh?

676
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,080
Some guy out there is
dealing undiluted oxytocin.

677
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:12,600
What?

678
00:50:12,601 --> 00:50:15,100
That's crazy. That's pretty messed up.

679
00:50:15,715 --> 00:50:16,715
Between us, Timo?

680
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:19,440
A drop here and there before
bed to take the edge off?

681
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,560
I get it.

682
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,920
But the pure uncut
stuff is crossing the line.

683
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,080
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

684
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,360
That's... bad.

685
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,800
Nasha, take Mickey home. I'll wrap up here.

686
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,020
Yes.

687
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,560
Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

688
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,731
Today I feel like... B6.

689
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:51,810
B6?

690
00:50:51,811 --> 00:50:52,811
Yeah.

691
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,190
Flying Nasha.

692
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,610
It's definitely my place for now.

693
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:58,850
It's alright.

694
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,070
B6.

695
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:08,710
B6 was ours, Nasha.

696
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,600
Mickey?

697
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:20,470
Hey, brother.

698
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,396
I was just headed to your room to catch
you, but here you are. Looking good, Mickey.

699
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,420
Yes, sir.

700
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,520
Stand there.

701
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,640
Arm around, please.

702
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,120
Great.

703
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,000
Big smile, Mickey.

704
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:34,780
Sorry. Could you just stand there?

705
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,860
Great. Thank you.

706
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,280
And action.

707
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:39,940
Congratulations.

708
00:51:40,895 --> 00:51:41,936
This month's lucky winner,

709
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:46,100
the fortunate soul who will have the
privilege of a private dinner at the camera,

710
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:49,740
will have a private dinner with the
one and only Kenneth Marshall is...

711
00:51:49,741 --> 00:51:50,760
Is that the barrel?

712
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,500
It's Mickey.

713
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:54,940
Great. Big smile. Smile.

714
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,960
Yeah. Amazing.

715
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:57,700
Okay, cut.

716
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,040
Now, Marshall wants you to come ASAP, okay?

717
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,141
He's got a whole feast
prepared just for you.

718
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,260
The Lord is truly blessing
you today, Mickey.

719
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,566
I need to go back to my room.

720
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,311
You get to stuff your fucking face, Mickey.

721
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:13,820
I bet that freak is probably

722
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,761
drooling all over my
beautiful Nasha already.

723
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,080
It's disgusting.

724
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,620
What's even more
disgusting is that I'm drooling

725
00:52:21,621 --> 00:52:24,541
at the thought of the tenderloin
steak I ordered for Marshall's dinner.

726
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,960
This is so wrong!

727
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,560
So glad you seem to be enjoying it.

728
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,480
How's the sauce?

729
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,800
Oh.

730
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,980
Oh, sorry, sorry. Please.

731
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,260
Continue.

732
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,080
Yeah, yeah, Mickey, uh,

733
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,360
listen, going back to everything that

734
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,020
happened with, uh...

735
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,540
Jennifer?

736
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,300
Yes, Jennifer.

737
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:52,730
Jennifer, uh...

738
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,200
I know, I know.

739
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:58,581
When we lost our
dear Jennifer Chilton,

740
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,300
I may have gotten a little

741
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,499
angry and said some
terribly unkind things.

742
00:53:04,899 --> 00:53:07,780
I know it's late, and
I want to apologize.

743
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,237
Oh, he's always like this.

744
00:53:10,537 --> 00:53:11,460
Such an adorable

745
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,541
man, and then suddenly he's all cutthroat.

746
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,640
Sorry.

747
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,660
You're still squishy,
fresh out of the printer.

748
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,520
Continue feeding him.

749
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,240
Oh, anyway, we have
another special guest here.

750
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,340
Hi, Kai.

751
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:32,190
Sorry I'm late.

752
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:33,770
You look very nice.

753
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,540
Thank you.

754
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:35,660
Come, come.

755
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,680
It's good to see you.

756
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,780
Sit.

757
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,740
You okay, emotionally?

758
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:43,950
Yeah, I feel fine, sir.

759
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,260
Thank you.

760
00:53:45,425 --> 00:53:46,120
I'm glad to hear it, Kai.

761
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:47,960
I'm so sorry about Jennifer.

762
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:50,760
I hear you were extremely close,

763
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:52,310
your best friend.

764
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,581
But I knew you'd stay
strong throughout the long.

765
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,020
Thank you, ma'am.

766
00:53:56,475 --> 00:53:59,581
But we didn't invite you
here simply to comfort you.

767
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,640
We've had our eyes on you, Cass.

768
00:54:04,185 --> 00:54:05,168
Me, sir?

769
00:54:05,169 --> 00:54:07,821
May I ask why?

770
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,080
You're one of us.

771
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:14,540
With your impeccable
genetics, you are the perfect

772
00:54:14,815 --> 00:54:17,561
specimen for the
colony I envision.

773
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:20,960
Thank you, sir.

774
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,840
That's why the church,

775
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,420
I mean, um, company,

776
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,340
has chosen me to lead this expedition.

777
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,440
The Earth's beyond saving

778
00:54:29,715 --> 00:54:30,860
with all its muddied people.

779
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,500
But you,

780
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,370
you're something special,

781
00:54:34,555 --> 00:54:36,380
and I'm creating a world

782
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,180
on a pure white planet

783
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:41,860
full of superior
people like you and us.

784
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,056
Isn't that right, darling?

785
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,780
Yes. It's his vision,

786
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,380
his sensibilities.

787
00:54:47,715 --> 00:54:48,715
But let's be honest.

788
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,560
With your medical records in hand,

789
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,240
you ran to join our expedition

790
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,260
instead of one of those pathetic

791
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,780
planets where they plant microchips

792
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,621
in their artificially
inseminated baby embryos.

793
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,540
You really are the perfect candidate for
Niflheim's natural child birthing program,

794
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,660
aren't you, dear?

795
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,180
Mr. Marshall,

796
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,340
am I just a uterus to you?

797
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,880
No! No, no, no, no, no.

798
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,820
Oh, it's nothing like that.

799
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,600
Kai, no.

800
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,700
This man is not one to objectify women.

801
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:21,620
All my husband means to say

802
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,820
is he has very high standards.

803
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:28,760
His only dream is of a planet
exclusively for a pure human race.

804
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,840
That consumes real crops

805
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:32,190
and real meat

806
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:34,900
and dinners with delicate,

807
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,060
delicious sauces.

808
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:39,561
Oh, sauce is the true
litmus test of civilization.

809
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:42,360
People who devour
burnt meat are barbarians.

810
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,760
Do try the sauce, Kai.

811
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:45,240
Here, I made it myself.

812
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:46,730
Oh, thank you.

813
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,601
But first, I'd like to say a few
words in Jennifer's memory.

814
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,160
A prayer.

815
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:56,620
Always ready for a prayer.

816
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,160
Jennifer,

817
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,551
when I first met you at
the cafeteria four years ago.

818
00:56:02,552 --> 00:56:04,080
..

819
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,520
You were...

820
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:19,300
Dear Lord, Jennifer Chilton's

821
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,040
one and only soul

822
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,040
was taken from her
wonderful friend, Kai.

823
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,500
Dear Lord,

824
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,940
Jennifer Chilton... Rejoice
in the Lord our one and only

825
00:56:35,685 --> 00:56:40,940
Almighty Let us
sing for our Father's

826
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,220
grace

827
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:49,620
Thank God for our Father's
grace God almighty free at last

828
00:56:49,621 --> 00:56:54,780
We're going to the
promised land A sea of light

829
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:01,561
in your light Your kingdom
in front of our eyes Hallelujah

830
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:07,841
Hallelujah Your servant
at the top has died Let's go!

831
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:09,760
Let's get up now

832
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:16,080
Forever and then
Come again Come again

833
00:57:26,655 --> 00:57:36,721
For ever is your kingdom God Almighty
God of glory Christ has welcomed us Who HD

834
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:46,061
is God This peace
You are perfect

835
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:50,920
No, no, no, not at all.
I mean, artificial meat is crap.

836
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:54,960
How are we supposed to improve it
unless we fail upward to perfection?

837
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,220
No. Arkady, stand tall in
your failures like me, my friend.

838
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:03,520
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

839
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:07,840
Commander, so you were testing
out your in-flight TV dinner on him?

840
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,040
In-flight TV dinner?

841
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,040
Is that what the young
troops are calling it now?

842
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,880
Excuse me.

843
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,720
Are you in a lot of pain?

844
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,580
I'm being punished.

845
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:21,980
What?

846
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,680
It's my punishment.

847
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:27,460
I should have gone to
Nosh and not come here.

848
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:34,640
Dorothy, bring me Purple Joe.

849
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,120
Sir, you remember the special
painkiller we've been developing?

850
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:41,940
Yeah, Purple Joe.
It's a quick-fix turn to the agents, right?

851
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:42,900
Yes, since...

852
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,033
Since Mickey here is
in such awful pain, it's

853
00:58:45,045 --> 00:58:46,960
a perfect opportunity
to try a little test.

854
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,080
So give it to him.

855
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,160
Oh, great. All right.

856
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,180
Don't touch him, please.

857
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,880
Mickey, can you see me?

858
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Mickey?

859
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,800
Mickey!

860
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:16,270
Get back down there.

861
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,280
Mickey?

862
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:18,980
Mickey?

863
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,140
Oh, God. Oh, God.

864
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,440
What did he do?

865
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,040
What did he do?

866
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,380
Ah!

867
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,260
Apologies, sir.
The painkiller's not working.

868
00:59:45,435 --> 00:59:47,960
Don't film this, Preston.
Please, turn it off.

869
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,800
This is better, right? More humane.

870
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:53,020
Yes, sir. More humane.

871
00:59:53,021 --> 00:59:54,741
No, no, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?

872
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:55,960
Huh?

873
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,201
You can't tear a hole in my fucking carpet!

874
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:00,380
Well, we'll just shoot him from the side.

875
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:01,940
But what about the blood?

876
01:00:01,941 --> 01:00:04,640
This is a Persian tavern!

877
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:06,650
Honey, calm down.

878
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,040
Shoot him now.

879
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:09,520
What the hell is going on?

880
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,220
This was supposed to be a fucking dinner!

881
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:14,740
He's your guest!

882
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,940
Agent Guy Katz, what the
hell's going on with you?

883
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:19,630
He's a meat matrix.

884
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,700
It's a goddamn print job.

885
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,680
Inexpendable.

886
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,560
He signed up for this.

887
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,380
Yes, sir.

888
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,420
This is for our planet, Agent.

889
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:29,680
I'm sorry, sir.

890
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:30,900
Come on, guys.

891
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,720
Please don't shoot him.

892
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:39,550
I'm okay now.

893
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:42,330
I don't think so.

894
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,790
He still seems like he's in a lot of pain.

895
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:46,130
Of course he is.

896
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,360
Are you really okay?

897
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,750
Just thank you for dinner.

898
01:00:58,310 --> 01:00:59,310
Huh.

899
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:02,730
My room's just there.

900
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,421
You need to clean up and rest, Mickey.

901
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:08,510
Don't worry about me.

902
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,010
I can walk.

903
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:12,491
I just need to get back to my room.

904
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,930
No, I'm just about to...

905
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:16,310
Actually, we're going to mine.

906
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,020
Here.

907
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,480
It's dry.

908
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,160
I drink this whenever I have a stomachache.

909
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,080
It's from Earth.

910
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:41,860
It's precious.

911
01:01:42,895 --> 01:01:43,895
So I've been saving it.

912
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:50,610
But I made some for you.

913
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:54,600
Thanks.

914
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,920
Sit.

915
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,240
You know, Mickey...

916
01:02:07,025 --> 01:02:08,240
I didn't want to ask you this.

917
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,560
But just this once, okay?

918
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,700
And I'm so sorry.

919
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,600
What's it like?

920
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:27,700
Dying?

921
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,080
You're asking because of Jennifer?

922
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,340
Yeah.

923
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,590
We locked eyes...

924
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:46,090
in the last moment.

925
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:51,770
What did you feel?

926
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:55,370
As all that ice came crashing down on her?

927
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,800
I can't stop thinking about it.

928
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:12,060
I don't think it's what I usually feel.

929
01:03:12,061 --> 01:03:13,061
It's...

930
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,900
I die so often.

931
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,100
Because you know you're
going to wake up again, right?

932
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,100
Because you die knowing that.

933
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:32,540
Oh...

934
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:37,370
Well, I always feel scared.

935
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,190
It's terrible.

936
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:44,010
Dying.

937
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:45,910
I hate it.

938
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,600
No matter how many times I go through it.

939
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:55,520
It's scary.

940
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,920
Still.

941
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:00,940
Always.

942
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,100
Every time.

943
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:07,510
But you're here.

944
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,380
And Jennifer isn't.

945
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:16,730
Out there.

946
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:20,290
The entire universe.

947
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:25,510
She's nowhere.

948
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,681
You don't look like you're printed out.

949
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,320
You're just a person.

950
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,650
Are you and Nasha open?

951
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:05,810
I have to go.

952
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:09,390
Nasha.

953
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:10,670
Please forgive me.

954
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:14,690
The guy that you're having sex with.

955
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:16,670
That's not me.

956
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:20,330
That's not me.

957
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:22,630
You motherfucker.

958
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:25,890
How dare you touch her.

959
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:50,410
Seventeen.

960
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,511
I knew this would happen at some point.

961
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:56,430
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

962
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:57,530
Stand, stand.

963
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:58,730
Stand next to each other.

964
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:00,510
Wait, take this off.

965
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,250
What?

966
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:03,711
Yeah, I want you to look the same.

967
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:15,180
Oh, my God.

968
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:25,000
Nasha, how can you laugh right now?

969
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:26,861
This is a multiples violation.

970
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,060
I'm as good as dead.

971
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,420
Oh, come on.

972
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,280
When else am I going to get these shots?

973
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:33,640
I mean, think about it.

974
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:36,980
It would be so psyched
if there were two of me.

975
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:40,650
This is mild Mickey.

976
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,720
And this is habanero Mickey.

977
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,600
This is so exciting.

978
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:53,860
This is so different.

979
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:55,980
Nasha, you're different, too.

980
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,200
You don't seem like yourself.

981
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,220
Oh, Jesus.

982
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:05,580
You just did oxyzophil with him?

983
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:07,640
Just a teeny tiny bit.

984
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,200
With a ton of water.

985
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:09,520
What?

986
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,080
Do you want some?

987
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,080
Yeah, yeah.

988
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,160
Relax.

989
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:14,090
Just take it easy.

990
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:15,340
Nasha.

991
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:17,676
This piece of shit just
tried to kill me earlier.

992
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,500
Right here in this room.

993
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,100
Look, I was bleeding.

994
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,941
Like you weren't thinking
of trying the same thing.

995
01:07:24,445 --> 01:07:26,000
I saw you sneaking up behind me.

996
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:26,680
Hey, hey, hey.

997
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:27,700
Shut up.

998
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,740
Shut up.

999
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:30,180
And sit down.

1000
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:32,480
Oh, hey.

1001
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,560
Attention.

1002
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:37,240
From now on, I'm going to
feed you both as often as I can.

1003
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,841
So be good boys and don't fight.

1004
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:42,091
Now, 18 tells me you guys
have sorted it out already.

1005
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,080
E-Huff.

1006
01:07:44,081 --> 01:07:45,260
Work off.

1007
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,960
Alternating deaths?

1008
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,280
Even so not.

1009
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:50,700
It's a great system.

1010
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,460
Negotiation time.

1011
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,760
So everyone just chill.

1012
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:57,580
Okay?

1013
01:08:29,445 --> 01:08:30,606
You leave us alone for a sec.

1014
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:32,180
Why?

1015
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:33,260
What's the problem?

1016
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:37,650
I'm leaving.

1017
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,700
Oh, you're such a baby.

1018
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:41,620
I'm scared.

1019
01:08:41,621 --> 01:08:43,140
This guy needs some oxyzole for him.

1020
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,340
Relax.

1021
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,480
Talk about what?

1022
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:46,951
I don't care about your private life.

1023
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:48,860
Okay, fine.

1024
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:50,400
But what's up?

1025
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,180
What's the rush? Where are you going?

1026
01:09:52,385 --> 01:09:54,960
I just witnessed the multiples
violation with my own eyes.

1027
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,281
As an agent, I have a duty to report it.

1028
01:10:06,325 --> 01:10:08,286
Since when have you been
coming to Mickey's room?

1029
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,881
This is your first time, right?

1030
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:15,631
What's up with you and Kai, bro?

1031
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,720
Why was she here?

1032
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,161
What are you supposed to do now?

1033
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,360
She's gonna go straight to
Marshall and report us, isn't she?

1034
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,080
You need to relax.

1035
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,760
Nosh is handling it.

1036
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,980
She can convince anybody of anything.

1037
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:31,420
Phew. Oh my God.

1038
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:37,420
Besides, this moron is
busy with his clown show.

1039
01:10:46,865 --> 01:10:47,865
This fucker.

1040
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,160
Such an attention whore.

1041
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:57,940
And what did that asshole serve for dinner?

1042
01:10:58,380 --> 01:10:59,380
Was it good at least?

1043
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:02,110
You really wanna know?

1044
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,381
What went down at that dinner?

1045
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,120
So...

1046
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,820
the one with 17 on his chest...

1047
01:11:10,835 --> 01:11:12,836
that's the Mickey that
was in my room just before?

1048
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,140
Mm-hmm.

1049
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:17,940
And the one you were grabbing...

1050
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,880
he's 18, right?

1051
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:21,220
Yeah.

1052
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,680
Okay.

1053
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:29,790
You can have 18. I'll take 17.

1054
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:32,310
Whoa.

1055
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:34,110
There's two of them.

1056
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:35,150
Why not share?

1057
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:37,010
All right.

1058
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:39,570
So you get this straight.

1059
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:43,310
You were shitting your pants on the floor.

1060
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:49,630
And he comes up and stabs
you in the neck with a syringe.

1061
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,400
That's what happened.

1062
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:56,650
I wasn't, like, shitting my pants.

1063
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,530
I was just puking up a little.

1064
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:01,170
That's not the point!

1065
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:04,741
I've seen you rubbing up on Mickey
every chance you get, you fuckface.

1066
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:07,571
You know, I've always wanted
to kick the living shit out of you.

1067
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:09,971
Oh, Masha, come on.
I'm trying to be considerate.

1068
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:12,390
Mickey, 17...

1069
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:16,150
was about to double dip,
if you know what I mean.

1070
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:18,970
Move on from you to me.

1071
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:22,071
In fact, we almost...
Double dip?

1072
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:23,550
Shut up!

1073
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:23,950
Oh.

1074
01:12:24,195 --> 01:12:26,116
Mickey is not some
cookie you can split in half.

1075
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,110
17 and 18 are both Mickey.

1076
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:29,670
Both my Mickey.

1077
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,230
So then after Marshall fucks you sideways,

1078
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,861
you really let him have it, right?

1079
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:36,370
Right!

1080
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:38,250
What did you say?

1081
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:42,010
I said...

1082
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,430
I said I said thank you for dinner.

1083
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:50,370
You said what?

1084
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,990
I said thank you for dinner.

1085
01:12:54,215 --> 01:12:55,490
Thank you for fucking what?

1086
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,140
God!

1087
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:03,580
You son of a bitch!

1088
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,600
Fucking loser!

1089
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:09,410
Mike...

1090
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:11,610
I guess I am kind of a loser.

1091
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:13,310
What?

1092
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:18,390
Is that what you are?

1093
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:19,750
Huh?

1094
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:20,990
Is it?

1095
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:22,210
Free Atlanta!

1096
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:25,930
The floor to the promised land!

1097
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:27,650
And free Hawaii!

1098
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:28,870
God!

1099
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:30,410
Gah!!

1100
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:45,110
It's not your fault.

1101
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,480
Let's kill that fucker.

1102
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,660
This guy would be killing each...

1103
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,160
Kill this, kill that!

1104
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,681
Why don't we kill everybody?

1105
01:13:58,145 --> 01:13:59,866
She can stay here and watch TV if you like.

1106
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:00,620
You can stay here and watch TV if you like.

1107
01:14:00,621 --> 01:14:00,780
W. wait!

1108
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:05,340
You can't negotiate
shit with that attitude.

1109
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,620
Hey Jesus. You're hot on oxyzole foam.

1110
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,400
Mickey!

1111
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,640
He has your gun.

1112
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:19,980
Gun?

1113
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,160
We have to stop him.

1114
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:23,740
What? Where's he going?

1115
01:14:26,155 --> 01:14:31,560
Why? Why? Why is Commander Marshall cutting
into that big beautiful handsome rock?

1116
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,100
It's sleek, hot, exquisite.

1117
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:54,600
This is where our names will be etched.
Mine and yours.

1118
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:58,700
And you! And you! And you!

1119
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:03,360
And you, my beautiful Eoclid.

1120
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:09,760
Almost every single one of you will
be remembered throughout history

1121
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,780
as the proud founders of Eoclid.

1122
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,060
The land of Niflheim's first generation.

1123
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,740
Our cornerstone. Black diamond.

1124
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:23,700
Beautiful and shimmering in purity.

1125
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,120
This rock will become the
symbolic monument of Niflheim.

1126
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:31,280
The one and only pure colony planet.

1127
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:33,580
The one and only Niflheim!

1128
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,660
The one and only Niflheim!

1129
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,880
The one and only!

1130
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:24,150
God, don't touch it, sir!

1131
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:26,110
Maybe it's contagious!

1132
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:27,470
It's contagious!

1133
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:30,650
You touch it, you die!

1134
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:39,620
Damn it!

1135
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,020
I say it's contagious!

1136
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:47,200
Stay calm! God damn it!

1137
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,300
Scalding!

1138
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,140
Initiate stay calm!

1139
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,101
... ... ... ... ...

1140
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:06,260
...

1141
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,120
...

1142
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,200
...

1143
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:43,810
... ... ...

1144
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:45,410
...

1145
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:52,111
... ... ... ...

1146
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:55,651
... ... ... ... ... ...
... ... ... ... ... ... ...

1147
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:05,800
...

1148
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:16,580
Don't shoot!
I'm not about to control! Don't shoot!

1149
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:22,820
Yes? Calm down. Calm down.
We have everything under control.

1150
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:24,740
You have, Marshal!

1151
01:18:27,615 --> 01:18:33,600
Those low-life multiples have
ruined our precious symbology.

1152
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,120
Kill it! Get down, sir!

1153
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,280
Open fire!

1154
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:53,290
Kill it!

1155
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:12,390
Arrest him, fucking multiples.

1156
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:34,559
Tell the committee you are aiming
at the Creeper behind Marshal.

1157
01:19:34,571 --> 01:19:37,680
Otherwise you could
get permanently deleted.

1158
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:41,070
Fuck that shit.

1159
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,881
You really think Captain
Crane Pie is going to let us live?

1160
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:49,551
He's probably going to shoot us himself.

1161
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:53,080
He's a nutjob.
He doesn't listen to anybody.

1162
01:19:55,045 --> 01:19:57,286
He's the biggest, dumbest
nutjob out of all the Mickeys.

1163
01:19:57,765 --> 01:19:58,886
And that's saying something.

1164
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:02,540
You screwed my entire life up.

1165
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:05,630
Oh, really? We all got
fucked the minute you

1166
01:20:05,642 --> 01:20:08,360
decided not to die and
came crawling home to me.

1167
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:11,700
That wasn't my fault.
That was the Creeper's fault.

1168
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:14,760
Creeper?

1169
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:17,583
Well, if that Creeper
is eating me like it's

1170
01:20:17,595 --> 01:20:20,000
supposed to, then we
won't be in this situation.

1171
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:24,560
But they all kicked me out,
and I'm a goddamn multiple.

1172
01:20:26,005 --> 01:20:26,660
They kicked you out?

1173
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:27,920
Yeah.

1174
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:34,680
You're all pushing me and pulling me,
and they all threw me back into the snow.

1175
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:41,160
Maybe I didn't look tasty enough,
or smelled off. I don't know.

1176
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:44,766
Maybe I was in some kind of sauce.

1177
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:49,960
Hold on. You're telling me they saved you?

1178
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:57,140
Think about it. You shouldn't have died
in that crevasse. The Creeper saved you.

1179
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:05,520
Uh, I guess if you put it like that,
uh, they were sort of saying me off.

1180
01:21:07,390 --> 01:21:09,111
I mean, maybe I should have said thank you.

1181
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:13,900
Yeah. I don't think they
were going to eat you. Right?

1182
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:17,440
Oh, my God.

1183
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:20,581
We have to report this to science.
They saved humans.

1184
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,780
Yeah. People need to know this.

1185
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,380
They saved me.

1186
01:21:38,005 --> 01:21:40,806
Where's the fucking ladder?
You're supposed to bring a fucking ladder.

1187
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:41,990
I don't know.

1188
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:45,590
Here. Let me help.

1189
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,890
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
Stop. I'll do it myself.

1190
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,150
I'm coming down myself. Get the fuck off.

1191
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:56,230
Come on.

1192
01:21:56,990 --> 01:21:58,870
Hey, Timo. What are you doing here?

1193
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:02,990
Oh, wow. You two really are multiples, huh?

1194
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:04,630
But it's you.

1195
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,972
Yeah, I see it in that
schmuck face of yours.

1196
01:22:07,984 --> 01:22:09,890
You're the one that
gave me this. Right?

1197
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:11,950
Oopsie.

1198
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:15,610
Here you go, guys.
You guys must be starving.

1199
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:18,971
Thanks, man. I knew you'd be coming for us.

1200
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:22,170
What are you up to?

1201
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:24,710
What's all that?

1202
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,950
So, um, here's the thing.

1203
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:33,810
I need to shoot a video
and send it to Earth ASAP.

1204
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,330
Video? To Earth?

1205
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:40,130
Yeah. Um, it's for, uh...

1206
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:42,840
Darius Blank.

1207
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,010
Darius Blank? Who's that?

1208
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,570
I found this at my door today.

1209
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:53,710
It's written by hand.

1210
01:22:54,690 --> 01:22:56,050
It's a beautiful handwriting.

1211
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,501
It's from Darius Blank's associate.

1212
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,630
Yeah. His associate.

1213
01:23:04,425 --> 01:23:06,870
I'm not kidding. His associate.

1214
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:10,011
You know what I mean? Like, of course.

1215
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:13,610
Of course the loan shark
of all fuckin' loan sharks

1216
01:23:13,611 --> 01:23:15,630
would figure out a way
to send one of his guys

1217
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:18,530
to follow us all the way here to Niflheim.

1218
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,090
To where we are right now.

1219
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:22,526
That's like a million fuckin'
miles from the world out there.

1220
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:23,686
You know what I'm talking about?

1221
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:24,716
Do you know how far that is?

1222
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:27,690
No matter what pittance you
manage to scrape together,

1223
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:30,690
we've found that
sending it to Earth will cost

1224
01:23:30,691 --> 01:23:34,210
you an intergalactic
transfer fee more than...

1225
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:36,570
half the total sum.

1226
01:23:36,571 --> 01:23:37,571
God fucking associate!

1227
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,630
I have no idea who that is!

1228
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,710
I don't know who that is!

1229
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:43,580
Isn't that fucking crazy?

1230
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:45,870
Send a visual work of art.

1231
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:46,510
That's fucking crazy.

1232
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:50,130
A video file that captures
the details of death.

1233
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:52,050
Read the back.

1234
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:55,950
It says, chop up into a
minimum of 13 pieces.

1235
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:56,490
Chop up?

1236
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:57,450
Is that it?

1237
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:58,490
What the fuck is this?

1238
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:01,270
Hey! What did I say about the close-up?

1239
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:03,051
Close-up is more important, okay?

1240
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:06,321
So take the 32K camera
and put it over here for Mr.

1241
01:24:06,322 --> 01:24:07,270
Darius Blank.

1242
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:08,430
You understand?

1243
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:14,170
I'm sorry, Nicky.

1244
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:16,410
It's all there.

1245
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:17,930
Right? In the letter.

1246
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:22,070
If I shoot this video and I
send it to him, he'll let me live.

1247
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:25,820
If I don't,

1248
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,330
I'm gonna send that guy in.

1249
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:29,530
He's gonna kill me first.

1250
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,920
What am I supposed to do?

1251
01:24:34,290 --> 01:24:36,490
Come on, dude. If I die, that's it for me.

1252
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:38,720
But you're expendable.

1253
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:40,271
They'll just print you right back out.

1254
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:42,510
Please.

1255
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:44,170
Nicky.

1256
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:45,550
I'm your friend.

1257
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:48,450
Okay?
Please do this for your friend one time.

1258
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:50,226
You gotta do this for me, man.

1259
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:51,250
I'm your brother.

1260
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,480
I'm sorry.

1261
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,120
I'm sorry.

1262
01:25:00,090 --> 01:25:01,220
I'm so sorry.

1263
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:05,550
I'm so sorry.

1264
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:06,740
Oh, shit.

1265
01:25:07,730 --> 01:25:09,731
I should've killed this guy
when I had the chance.

1266
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:13,040
You guys just do this for me this one time.

1267
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:14,210
That's all I'm asking.

1268
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,180
I'm so sorry.

1269
01:25:15,181 --> 01:25:16,380
Stop crying, you prick!

1270
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:18,940
I'm getting on my fucking nerves.

1271
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:23,136
Why don't you guys do
rock, paper, scissors, okay?

1272
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,840
And then we'll just shoot the loser, yeah?

1273
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:26,060
No.

1274
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,240
All right.

1275
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:28,380
Shoot him.

1276
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:29,560
Him?

1277
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:31,180
Yeah, him.

1278
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:32,640
I wasn't expecting that.

1279
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:33,560
I thought you'd choose him.

1280
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:35,496
Yeah, you'd think so,
but the soft one's easier.

1281
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:35,800
Come on.

1282
01:25:35,801 --> 01:25:36,801
Come on.

1283
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:52,230
You're a dumb fucking bitch, Timo.

1284
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,710
If you do this and what space lets you
live, you think that'll be the end of it?

1285
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,801
You don't think I'll tell you
to fuck in pieces myself?

1286
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:03,910
Oh, my God.

1287
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:04,940
What is the big deal?

1288
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:06,831
All right, just take me instead.

1289
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:08,650
What?

1290
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,410
Just chop me up, not him.

1291
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:15,430
Look at him.

1292
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:17,766
You shot him one time with the tager,

1293
01:26:17,790 --> 01:26:20,670
it's like you just boofed a
fucking electric eel, man.

1294
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:24,870
But you can chop my whole
body up into ten mickey chunks,

1295
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:30,890
and I'll still be fresh as the
freshest sashimi, head held high.

1296
01:26:31,690 --> 01:26:32,690
Theorists will love that.

1297
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:36,211
I just need a little of your help.

1298
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:37,530
My help?

1299
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:41,830
Can't I need more of that?

1300
01:26:43,410 --> 01:26:44,410
Oxy's hopeful.

1301
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,330
Yeah, I got some oxy.

1302
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:49,400
But undiluted.

1303
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:52,410
You want...

1304
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,330
You want undiluted oxy right now?

1305
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:56,570
Yeah.

1306
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,250
Just think of it as the, uh...

1307
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:06,470
Think of it as the final
cigarette before execution.

1308
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,121
It's the least you could do for a friend.

1309
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:14,410
Give him yours.

1310
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:15,110
What?

1311
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:15,810
Come on.

1312
01:27:16,230 --> 01:27:16,710
No.

1313
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,206
I'll give you a freebie next time.

1314
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:19,230
You know me.

1315
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:22,250
This was expensive.

1316
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,160
The keys!

1317
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,340
Nasha!

1318
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:43,920
It's all mine.

1319
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,160
Do it!

1320
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:51,720
Nasha!

1321
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:52,960
What are you doing?

1322
01:27:55,005 --> 01:27:56,005
What's going on here?

1323
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:57,460
Nasha!

1324
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,680
Stay put.

1325
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,560
That did kind of shock me a bit.

1326
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:07,880
I mean, she literally was gonna
cut his head off with a chainsaw.

1327
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:14,000
Uh, but then I thought
about it and I was so touched.

1328
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,260
She's the only person who'd
ever lose it like that over me.

1329
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,940
And it wasn't the first time either.

1330
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:19,330
Nasha.

1331
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:22,130
She's the only one who's
always been there for me.

1332
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:24,670
She's always loved me.

1333
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:27,190
Every me.

1334
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:29,410
Even him.

1335
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:32,350
The me I don't understand at all.

1336
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:34,410
What is this?

1337
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:35,730
Oh, you don't know about this.

1338
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:37,531
They've been circling the whole night.

1339
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:38,990
And still more coming in.

1340
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:40,130
What are they doing?

1341
01:29:40,210 --> 01:29:41,210
We don't know.

1342
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,270
They can break through solid ice and stone.

1343
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:45,130
Imagine if they all come from this ship.

1344
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,790
Terrifying!

1345
01:29:45,791 --> 01:29:48,231
But you couldn't even tear
through the sack at the cafeteria.

1346
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:50,770
You hear that?

1347
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,841
It's coming from the one
we captured yesterday.

1348
01:29:52,870 --> 01:29:53,730
Keep going, keep going.

1349
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:54,870
Wait, you mean the baby?

1350
01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:55,870
Well, yeah.

1351
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,710
It's been screaming and crying like one.

1352
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,821
And that's when they all started gathering.

1353
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,140
That was... That was the
one that I... Keep going.

1354
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:10,600
Never mind.

1355
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:12,200
Hi.

1356
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:13,820
How you doing?

1357
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,200
Excuse me!

1358
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:16,780
Come up.

1359
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,360
Somebody passing through?

1360
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:19,540
Hey.

1361
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:21,900
Why did they set up
the situation room there?

1362
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,420
Beats me.

1363
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,916
I was just told to bring the prisoner.

1364
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,380
Apparently, Otha made a big scene.

1365
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:26,720
She wants the creeper now.

1366
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:29,360
Darby, I have crucial
information about the creepers.

1367
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:32,136
McGee needs to file an official
report with the head of science.

1368
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,160
Oh, wait.

1369
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,700
Yes, I knew it.

1370
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:49,400
Yesterday, at the cafeteria when
you held on to the baby, I saw it.

1371
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,600
You saw that?

1372
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,076
I don't know what it means, though.

1373
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:53,480
Oh.

1374
01:30:53,481 --> 01:30:53,600
What?

1375
01:30:53,925 --> 01:30:55,006
So you were just imitating?

1376
01:30:55,045 --> 01:30:56,820
Well, originally... No offense.

1377
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:57,500
What's the matter?

1378
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,160
It's really hectic right now.

1379
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,280
Let's talk later.

1380
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:03,440
We're recording the sounds to see
if we can analyze any kind of pattern.

1381
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:07,120
The committee is declaring
a level three emergency.

1382
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:09,788
Sole command and
control has been granted

1383
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:12,140
to Commander Marshall
by a vote of 36 to 21.

1384
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:16,560
Thank you.

1385
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:19,120
What an event.

1386
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,200
This is a truly novel ingredient.

1387
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:25,520
This opens up a whole new
world of potential sauces.

1388
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:28,600
It's such a great... how should I put it?

1389
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:30,550
Opportunity, ma'am.

1390
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:31,980
Yes, quite the opportunity.

1391
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Just super.

1392
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,160
Yes, it is a super opportunity.

1393
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:43,130
Oh, wow.

1394
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,350
It's such a godsend, too.

1395
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:50,191
It is free from harmful pathogens, correct?

1396
01:31:50,470 --> 01:31:51,110
Yes, ma'am.

1397
01:31:51,111 --> 01:31:52,111
Sure.

1398
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:13,920
Which dickhead is it, Mickey 18?

1399
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:16,630
Keep his head still!

1400
01:32:21,865 --> 01:32:23,480
Now I can tell you to a punch.

1401
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:24,920
Filthy multiples.

1402
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:25,600
Oh, yeah.

1403
01:32:25,830 --> 01:32:26,980
That does seem fair.

1404
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,160
Oh, goodness.

1405
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,400
Bright meat.

1406
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:30,680
That's nothing, honey.

1407
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:33,660
Wait till these two are
scorched sausages in the cyclo.

1408
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:35,640
How are you going to handle that stench?

1409
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,760
Mickey.

1410
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,520
I'm so sorry.

1411
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,400
You too.

1412
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:44,240
This brick stores your memories, right?

1413
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,360
Now you'll watch as I permanently
delete your being from it.

1414
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:51,620
That way you'll understand
the meaning and terror of finality.

1415
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,300
No more reprints!

1416
01:32:53,815 --> 01:32:55,936
That's what you both should
be thinking when you die.

1417
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:57,120
Dead forever!

1418
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:01,320
Now that the memory is
gone, which body goes first?

1419
01:33:01,525 --> 01:33:02,980
One of the times, twice the fun.

1420
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:04,580
Creepy.

1421
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:05,840
Commander Marshall, sir.

1422
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:08,400
May I say a few words?

1423
01:33:09,015 --> 01:33:11,240
Regardless of who burns
first, the simple fact is...

1424
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:13,651
we currently have two
Mickeys here before us.

1425
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:16,031
Due to no fault on their part, I might add.

1426
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:18,940
One of them is being falsely
accused of firing his gun at you.

1427
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:20,510
But the truth is...

1428
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:22,891
he was concerned for your safety.

1429
01:33:24,315 --> 01:33:27,036
He was the first to notice the second
Creeper coming out of the stone behind you.

1430
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:31,001
And as you are well aware, the day
an expendable is printed... Enough!

1431
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:34,780
You, defending these idiots,
should be mopping up your own shit.

1432
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:36,600
Illegal possession of oxyzophil.

1433
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:39,111
Concealment of a multiples violation.

1434
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:39,820
It's disappointing.

1435
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:42,270
An attempted murder
without... fucking chainsaw?

1436
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:46,056
I mean, it's quite the colorful rap
sheet, don't you think, Miss Barrage?

1437
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,980
The clouds of war are billowing.

1438
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:49,660
Look at those vermin swarmed.

1439
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,720
Mankind must unite
at this critical juncture.

1440
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,420
Why are we wasting our time
with these dregs of society?

1441
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:58,160
Spoken like a true wartime commander, sir.

1442
01:33:58,900 --> 01:33:59,900
Very impressive.

1443
01:34:00,490 --> 01:34:04,140
And a fine entry to add to your
collection of battle quotes, if I may.

1444
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:04,800
You like that?

1445
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:05,180
I do.

1446
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,000
More of that?

1447
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:06,600
Please.

1448
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:08,781
You keep mentioning
that we're in a state of war.

1449
01:34:10,450 --> 01:34:12,491
May I be so bold as to
offer two observations, sir?

1450
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:14,020
Be my guest.

1451
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:18,560
Firstly, fighting a war requires a
huge amount of energy and calories.

1452
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:21,587
Seeing as we're in
the early stages of

1453
01:34:21,599 --> 01:34:23,461
settlement and our
survival is in the balance,

1454
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:25,781
I wonder whether this
expenditure is prudent.

1455
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,420
Secondly, our apparent
enemies are the Creepers.

1456
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:32,486
But do we know whether they
actually want to engage in war?

1457
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:36,381
For hours they've been swirling
in circles doing nothing but wailing.

1458
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:38,400
My God, Agent Verge.

1459
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:44,220
You used to be a five-time
Marshall Cup champion.

1460
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:46,080
Agent of the Month.

1461
01:34:47,055 --> 01:34:51,320
And now you're sweating
over these alien insects?

1462
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:52,840
How far you've fallen.

1463
01:34:55,370 --> 01:34:58,651
What are you going to do when they tear
a hole in this ship and tear off your ass?

1464
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:02,600
These grotesque shit gibbons.

1465
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:05,240
Grotesque or not, they are the
native inhabitants of this planet.

1466
01:35:06,325 --> 01:35:08,120
And we have proof that
they saved one of us.

1467
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:10,600
They didn't eat him or attack him.

1468
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,100
Saved and not eaten who?

1469
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:14,460
Uh, me.

1470
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:17,820
They saved me.

1471
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,600
Of course they didn't eat you.

1472
01:35:24,810 --> 01:35:25,810
You're crap food.

1473
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,320
You're recycled spam, baby.

1474
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:32,780
You get chewed up and shit
out over and over and over again.

1475
01:35:32,781 --> 01:35:34,781
Well, I guess they aren't
just stupid bugs, honey.

1476
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:36,140
I mean, they knew to pass on crap.

1477
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:36,960
Junk.

1478
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,160
They must have some cognitive ability.

1479
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:40,380
Exactly.

1480
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:43,780
Actually, they exhibit
signs of high intelligence.

1481
01:35:44,090 --> 01:35:46,320
They may be able to engage
in meaningful conversation.

1482
01:35:46,930 --> 01:35:48,700
And we're analyzing this and...

1483
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:51,180
Sir?

1484
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:54,191
You must try communicating
with them yourself.

1485
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,480
We're developing a sort of translator.

1486
01:36:00,195 --> 01:36:01,340
Like that, you mean?

1487
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:03,490
You think I'm an idiot?

1488
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:07,140
Oh, fuck.

1489
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:25,588
Four and a half years
across the fucking galaxy

1490
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,160
just to hear these
goddamn alien squawks?

1491
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:33,280
Tell me how the fuck that
makes any sense, somebody?

1492
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:34,540
How does this make any sense?

1493
01:36:35,895 --> 01:36:37,416
How does your bullshit make any sense?

1494
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:40,996
You know, your fucking fuckface is what
really doesn't make any fucking sense.

1495
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:42,020
You fucking...

1496
01:36:42,125 --> 01:36:43,125
IDIOT!

1497
01:36:44,110 --> 01:36:45,110
You call them aliens?

1498
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:47,040
We're the aliens, dumbass!

1499
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:48,356
They would have been here before us.

1500
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:49,380
And Mickey...

1501
01:36:50,530 --> 01:36:52,260
Mickey was always just Mickey Barnes.

1502
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:54,991
Do you even understand what that means?

1503
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:59,560
They were just living their lives
before you came in with your bullshit!

1504
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:02,740
And you think you get to
decide who lives and who dies?

1505
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:04,360
You are a dumb fuck!

1506
01:37:07,345 --> 01:37:09,960
No wonder you blew the
elections, you fucking moron.

1507
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,420
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1508
01:37:30,650 --> 01:37:31,650
God, hang up!

1509
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:42,860
Bite.

1510
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:44,880
What?

1511
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,040
Falling in three, two, one.

1512
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,250
Fine, as you shut the fuck up.

1513
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,770
This is clearly abuse,
one kiss after the other.

1514
01:38:05,710 --> 01:38:06,710
Rolling.

1515
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:10,810
In the 32K.

1516
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,201
Make sure you get everything.

1517
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:15,430
Impressive teeth.

1518
01:38:15,650 --> 01:38:16,650
Yeah.

1519
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:17,910
We need more of our guys.

1520
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:23,490
Sir, now might be the prime
time to initiate total extermination.

1521
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:26,031
The ones out there alone
would be more than enough.

1522
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:27,330
What are you talking about?

1523
01:38:27,955 --> 01:38:29,836
We're gonna gas them,
we're gonna gas them all.

1524
01:38:32,290 --> 01:38:33,290
What's that look for?

1525
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:35,710
Still not confident in your failures?

1526
01:38:35,711 --> 01:38:37,010
No, no, sir.

1527
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:40,670
Arcadi 3.0 has gone through
several meticulous stages of testing.

1528
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:43,290
Arcadi 3.0 is the ultimate nerve gas.

1529
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:45,290
I have every confidence in it, sir.

1530
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:46,630
As you should, Arcadi.

1531
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:47,650
This has to succeed.

1532
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:49,621
I'll put it in my prayers.

1533
01:38:50,570 --> 01:38:52,330
This is the day we've
been waiting for, sir.

1534
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:55,771
Future historians will
mark today as error-defining

1535
01:38:55,783 --> 01:38:58,130
for cleansing dangerous
species on colony planets.

1536
01:38:58,945 --> 01:39:00,826
Why don't you board
the flitter yourself later?

1537
01:39:01,630 --> 01:39:02,746
You mean when we spray the gas?

1538
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:03,770
Yeah.

1539
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:05,210
I pull the trigger?

1540
01:39:05,211 --> 01:39:06,290
Exactly, sir.

1541
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:10,510
If you write the leaf flitter and
appear to commandeer the operation,

1542
01:39:11,690 --> 01:39:13,470
the footage I get, it will be historic.

1543
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:18,270
And the members, the church
members back on Earth, they will adore it.

1544
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:19,890
Yes, yes, the company.

1545
01:39:20,290 --> 01:39:21,290
All right.

1546
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:24,290
It's time we initiate
Operation Total Extermination.

1547
01:39:24,530 --> 01:39:25,826
Honey, can I have a word with you?

1548
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:26,850
Yes, my love.

1549
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:28,810
I've got an idea.

1550
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:35,190
I hope you both can appreciate what a
great honor my wife has bestowed on me.

1551
01:39:35,210 --> 01:39:36,970
I'm going to be storing
on your shit stains.

1552
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:39,750
And so I can press both
buttons simultaneously?

1553
01:39:40,570 --> 01:39:41,150
Yes, sir.

1554
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:43,066
Press them and they'll
go off at the same time.

1555
01:39:43,090 --> 01:39:46,290
They'll also explode automatically if
they exit the range of the remote control.

1556
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:47,050
You hear that?

1557
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:48,130
I have you by the balls.

1558
01:39:48,185 --> 01:39:49,465
Don't even think of running off.

1559
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,746
You'll each be given a primitive
weapon as you head out.

1560
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:54,214
You cut off as many creeper
tails as you can, and the

1561
01:39:54,226 --> 01:39:56,590
first Mickey to bring back
100 tails is the winner.

1562
01:39:57,295 --> 01:39:58,376
And the winner doesn't die.

1563
01:39:58,410 --> 01:40:00,230
But the loser goes...

1564
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:02,150
Boom!

1565
01:40:02,290 --> 01:40:02,590
Boom!

1566
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:03,190
Boom.

1567
01:40:03,191 --> 01:40:04,191
Boom.

1568
01:40:04,435 --> 01:40:05,830
A world keeps going from here.

1569
01:40:06,190 --> 01:40:08,773
Your job is to make
them scream so loudly that

1570
01:40:08,785 --> 01:40:11,550
every last creeper comes
running in to save them.

1571
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:14,210
We'll kill two birds with
one stone, right honey?

1572
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:17,750
Oh, absolutely. 100 tails is enough to
make enough sauce to last a couple years.

1573
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:19,290
Better be on your toes.

1574
01:40:20,415 --> 01:40:22,110
One false move and you're man burger.

1575
01:40:38,170 --> 01:40:39,610
It's all punishment.

1576
01:40:41,570 --> 01:40:42,570
What was that?

1577
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:48,390
My entire life's a goddamn punishment.

1578
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:51,090
All for pressing that
button when I was five.

1579
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:54,250
Oh, this again.

1580
01:40:56,810 --> 01:40:59,150
Accident was caused by a
car defect, you know that?

1581
01:41:00,350 --> 01:41:01,350
I don't know.

1582
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:08,530
Well, it wasn't pressing
that stupid button.

1583
01:41:10,550 --> 01:41:12,210
It wasn't while I was driving either.

1584
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:15,190
How many times I gotta tell you?

1585
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:20,690
Sorry, Mickey.

1586
01:41:21,170 --> 01:41:23,290
Mickey, you need to move. Like, now.

1587
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:25,510
Can you at least put the ramp down?

1588
01:41:25,590 --> 01:41:27,230
We can't do that right now. I'm sorry.

1589
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:28,490
You're gonna have to drive.

1590
01:41:28,491 --> 01:41:29,491
What?

1591
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:32,550
Mickey!

1592
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:39,920
Take this.

1593
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:43,796
It's not finished, but it might help
you communicate with the Creepers.

1594
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:44,060
Let's go.

1595
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,260
Is this like a translator thing?

1596
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:47,520
Yes. Good luck.

1597
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:50,720
For what it's worth, I doubt
Marshall will kill both of you.

1598
01:41:50,780 --> 01:41:51,780
Come on.

1599
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,080
Come on.

1600
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:56,081
Well, I... Go.

1601
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:06,370
With this device, I got a job to do.

1602
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:09,330
All right.

1603
01:42:09,450 --> 01:42:12,150
They saved me. Now I save them.

1604
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:14,570
What are those fuckers doing?

1605
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:16,310
Even I can count.

1606
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,341
Dozens of fresh tails
they're leaving behind.

1607
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:19,590
Are they out of their minds?

1608
01:42:20,430 --> 01:42:21,430
Oh, honey.

1609
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:24,230
Should I just press the button?

1610
01:42:24,350 --> 01:42:25,350
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1611
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:27,470
Let's sit back and watch.

1612
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:31,664
They'll start chopping
tails as soon as they

1613
01:42:31,676 --> 01:42:33,810
realize one of them
has to outlive the other.

1614
01:42:35,510 --> 01:42:35,990
Hey!

1615
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:37,350
Hey!

1616
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:38,750
It's me!

1617
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:42,300
You gotta run away!

1618
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:44,620
You gotta get them all out of here!

1619
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:46,800
You gotta go back to your cave!

1620
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:50,380
Go back to your cave!

1621
01:42:54,165 --> 01:42:55,600
Or you're all gonna die.

1622
01:42:58,240 --> 01:42:59,240
What?

1623
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:00,580
Oh, hello.

1624
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:03,460
Um...

1625
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:06,020
Yes, I just... I wanted...

1626
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:07,720
About last time, I...

1627
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:09,600
Uh...

1628
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:10,260
I...

1629
01:43:10,585 --> 01:43:11,840
I wanted to say...

1630
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:13,440
Thank you.

1631
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:15,120
Um...

1632
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,580
Do you remember me right?

1633
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:21,060
Mickey.

1634
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:23,260
Uh...

1635
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:25,700
How do you know my name?

1636
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:30,540
Cigarette.

1637
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:33,461
Wait, are they having a conversation?

1638
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:36,240
Yes.

1639
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,300
We already explained it just now.

1640
01:43:38,301 --> 01:43:38,640
How?

1641
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:39,820
How is this possible?

1642
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:44,840
Oh, well, it's still a prototype,
but it's like a translator device.

1643
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:46,660
Dor... Dorothy?

1644
01:43:47,170 --> 01:43:48,380
Oh, no, where's Dorothy?

1645
01:43:49,295 --> 01:43:50,936
I can't hear a thing with all the static.

1646
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:53,220
I mean, even the video is shit!

1647
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:58,881
Apologies, sir. The snowstorm is exacerbating
the absorption... What about this?

1648
01:43:59,305 --> 01:44:00,305
Will this detonator work?

1649
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:03,420
Yes, sir. That is a special
shortwave signal, so it'll be fine.

1650
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:04,620
And who's that big one there?

1651
01:44:05,570 --> 01:44:06,961
Is that the queen bee of the bunch?

1652
01:44:06,985 --> 01:44:09,360
Hmm, looks like a croissant dipped in shit.

1653
01:44:10,565 --> 01:44:13,586
Uh, official reports
are still being finalized,

1654
01:44:13,598 --> 01:44:16,760
but we think everything
revolves around that one.

1655
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:18,240
The mama creeper.

1656
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,680
So that one's the boss. Like you.

1657
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:23,720
Say what?

1658
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:29,220
We gotta get out of here, or they're
gonna kill you all with this death gas.

1659
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:35,060
That gas, Arcadi 3.0,
I got blasted with that.

1660
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:36,100
It's seriously...

1661
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
...insanely painful.

1662
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:42,400
Do you know what gas is? Gas?

1663
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:44,240
Like...

1664
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:46,540
...like gas?

1665
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,900
Mind your own business, stupid.

1666
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:55,740
Mind my own business? What about you?

1667
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:59,140
Why'd you save him at the cave?

1668
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,000
Should kill him?

1669
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:05,420
No!

1670
01:45:05,860 --> 01:45:06,860
No!

1671
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:11,000
I'm... ...we're very
grateful. That's all.

1672
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:12,800
Then why?

1673
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:17,240
Why kill Luko?

1674
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:20,560
Uh... ...Luko?

1675
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:25,240
Baby...Luko.

1676
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:27,660
Oh.

1677
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:31,040
You grew.

1678
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:33,620
Shattered.

1679
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Blood.

1680
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:37,340
Yeah, uh...

1681
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:39,040
...oh, that's, uh...

1682
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:41,120
...that's Luko.

1683
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:44,360
We save you.

1684
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:50,260
You kill Luko.

1685
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:57,020
So what's the name of the other baby?

1686
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:58,750
The one on the ship?

1687
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:01,260
Zuko.

1688
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:05,260
Kill Zuko, too.

1689
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:10,120
What if Zuko dies? What will you do?

1690
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:14,080
Death.

1691
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:16,120
All.

1692
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:21,270
You mean all humans.

1693
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:27,440
Extinction!

1694
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:28,800
How?

1695
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:31,860
Easy.

1696
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:20,930
Unless somebody
wants to kill me.

1697
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:24,570
Desperate.

1698
01:47:24,670 --> 01:47:25,931
Dusko.

1699
01:47:55,591 --> 01:47:59,510
уль What's wrong with them? What's wrong
with him? And they're saying something.

1700
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:03,130
What is that idiot saying?
It's not sign language.

1701
01:48:16,030 --> 01:48:18,010
C3? C3? What's C3?

1702
01:48:24,710 --> 01:48:30,810
Bring the baby! Bring the baby!

1703
01:48:33,150 --> 01:48:37,344
Honey, this doesn't sit
well with me. Why are those

1704
01:48:37,356 --> 01:48:41,150
two losers chatting with
the boss of the bugs?

1705
01:48:41,590 --> 01:48:44,111
They think they're negotiating
on behalf of mankind, humankind?

1706
01:48:44,715 --> 01:48:46,236
You should be standing out there, sir.

1707
01:48:46,905 --> 01:48:48,870
Ushering in this historic moment.

1708
01:48:50,210 --> 01:48:55,170
You're seeing two bosses meeting
face to face in a climactic snowstorm?

1709
01:48:55,290 --> 01:48:56,290
A moment of destiny?

1710
01:48:56,890 --> 01:48:58,291
All you have to do is go out there.

1711
01:48:58,695 --> 01:49:00,250
I know I can create an iconic scene.

1712
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:03,630
A decisive moment in the
history of the Niflheim settlement.

1713
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:06,110
Oh, I can picture it now.

1714
01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:09,290
Adorning the ceiling and
the walls of the Grand Chapel.

1715
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:10,670
Yes, ma'am. Yes.

1716
01:49:12,205 --> 01:49:13,410
One final touch, sir.

1717
01:49:14,530 --> 01:49:17,830
I think it would be great if you give
them a message before spraying the gas.

1718
01:49:18,130 --> 01:49:19,130
A message?

1719
01:49:19,845 --> 01:49:22,518
Without such poignancy,
today will be a third-rate

1720
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:25,590
carnival where we spray cheap
pesticide over cockroaches.

1721
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:31,230
Yes, they are disgusting, filthy, evil
insects, but it will be their last moment.

1722
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:35,410
And you could offer them a few
merciful words as a proper farewell.

1723
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:38,290
Like a wise, benevolent priest.

1724
01:49:39,490 --> 01:49:42,470
Get me a camera crew. Tell the
first squad to meet me fully armed.

1725
01:49:42,471 --> 01:49:43,030
Yes, sir.

1726
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:45,230
My love, the Situation Room is yours.

1727
01:49:45,490 --> 01:49:46,490
Till we meet again?

1728
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:52,080
C-3!

1729
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:53,540
Not who you want to meet.

1730
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:54,720
It's the wrong thing.

1731
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:57,600
I want to get Sokol back safe.

1732
01:49:57,860 --> 01:49:58,860
I mean it!

1733
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:02,400
Not enough.

1734
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:05,100
But what else?

1735
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:08,420
We lose Luko.

1736
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:11,220
One.

1737
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:13,440
Be fair.

1738
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:15,800
Be fair?

1739
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:17,840
And we have to contribute to death?

1740
01:50:19,610 --> 01:50:20,610
Yes.

1741
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,440
Fair.

1742
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:24,800
One of yours.

1743
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:26,840
Die.

1744
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:30,460
So if we bring back Sokol
safe, and a human dies?

1745
01:50:32,550 --> 01:50:33,550
Peace.

1746
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:37,120
Peace.

1747
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:07,160
Peace.

1748
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:08,180
Do you copy?

1749
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:11,352
Okay, the radio signal is
a little patched right now,

1750
01:51:11,353 --> 01:51:14,020
so the comms speaker will
be on the right line of comms.

1751
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:15,680
Units, who do you copy?

1752
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:19,800
Our orders are to send you a
score for under-martial... Die!

1753
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:21,840
I'm not going to dance!

1754
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:24,520
Do not entertain the queen!

1755
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:25,640
Die!

1756
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:26,980
I'm down.

1757
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:39,057
Okay, right after your speech,
sir, we'll close the canopy

1758
01:51:39,058 --> 01:51:41,561
at once, and that will be
the signal for the air squad.

1759
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:42,820
Spray that gas.

1760
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:45,380
Glorious annihilation, sir.

1761
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:48,600
You.

1762
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:49,280
Yes, you.

1763
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:49,620
Come here.

1764
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:50,060
What's your name?

1765
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:50,360
Matthew?

1766
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:51,040
Oh, Matthew.

1767
01:51:51,210 --> 01:51:52,320
You have the face of an angel.

1768
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:52,520
Here.

1769
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:53,800
Try my socks.

1770
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:55,440
Here you go.

1771
01:51:55,740 --> 01:51:56,740
Tell me what you think.

1772
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:58,180
No!

1773
01:51:58,660 --> 01:51:59,660
No!

1774
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:00,100
No!

1775
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:01,400
No!

1776
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:02,100
No!

1777
01:52:02,101 --> 01:52:02,240
No!

1778
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:03,780
No!

1779
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:08,980
No!

1780
01:52:08,981 --> 01:52:09,981
No!

1781
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:10,160
No!

1782
01:52:10,161 --> 01:52:11,161
Take it easy.

1783
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:14,520
One snap and it's instant death.

1784
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:19,380
Nasha Barrage, what do you want?

1785
01:52:21,140 --> 01:52:22,140
The baby.

1786
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:24,300
We have to take it to the moment.

1787
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:25,140
That's all?

1788
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,360
Yes.

1789
01:52:26,980 --> 01:52:27,980
Guarantee us a safe exit.

1790
01:52:29,190 --> 01:52:30,831
Unless you want to see me break her neck.

1791
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:32,840
No.

1792
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:34,220
Nasha, please don't.

1793
01:52:35,070 --> 01:52:37,200
Look, we secure Nasha's exit as negotiated.

1794
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:39,540
Nasha, can you release her carefully?

1795
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:43,440
Let me get the baby.

1796
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:44,480
Be careful.

1797
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:46,060
Nasha, are you okay?

1798
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:46,540
I need to hurry.

1799
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:48,060
Can I get a flitter?

1800
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:48,660
I doubt it.

1801
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:49,680
You'll have to run.

1802
01:52:57,620 --> 01:53:01,700
Ma'am, today you and the
commander have displayed

1803
01:53:01,712 --> 01:53:05,220
an impressive range
of verbal and physical

1804
01:53:05,221 --> 01:53:08,720
abuse and acts of cruelty that
far exceed your granted authority.

1805
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,740
You want to be executed for mutiny?

1806
01:53:11,345 --> 01:53:14,580
All video evidence of abuse will be
presented to the committee for review.

1807
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:17,431
I suggest you have answers
prepared for your hearing.

1808
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:18,800
Thanks, Zeke.

1809
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:21,980
Maintain control on site.

1810
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:25,800
Here!

1811
01:53:35,110 --> 01:53:43,110
We'll start slowly circling
the creature from the outside...

1812
01:53:43,111 --> 01:53:46,010
Making the scene
absolutely spectacular, sir.

1813
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:50,290
I'll keep my speech short and tight.

1814
01:53:51,210 --> 01:53:54,270
A marvelous address, no need to add it.

1815
01:53:54,810 --> 01:53:56,770
And then I'll blow off the mickeys.

1816
01:53:57,190 --> 01:53:58,150
Pokemon Go!

1817
01:53:58,151 --> 01:54:01,570
You can do this, Nachi.
We'll get things under control inside.

1818
01:54:01,910 --> 01:54:04,310
Okay. See ya.

1819
01:54:04,450 --> 01:54:05,450
Good luck!

1820
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:13,760
Nachi's gonna figure this all out.

1821
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:15,180
His own will be back, you see.

1822
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:17,620
Who is that?

1823
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:19,640
Who's coming?

1824
01:54:56,380 --> 01:54:57,380
Wait.

1825
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,040
What is this bullshit?

1826
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:03,040
Which one's your mama?

1827
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:08,520
What the fuck am I supposed to be
looking at when I make my speech?

1828
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,980
I was gonna send them off with some dinghy!

1829
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:16,280
Now a barbarian can fuck off!

1830
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:19,020
Is that bazooka ready?

1831
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:20,680
Yes, sir. Loading now.

1832
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:24,060
We're gonna blast that
mama bitch into oblivion.

1833
01:55:24,260 --> 01:55:26,000
We need to fucking speed.

1834
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:28,720
I'll go hard.

1835
01:55:29,260 --> 01:55:30,860
That's the mama there, sir!

1836
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:31,620
Can you see it?

1837
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:32,960
That's a different shit!

1838
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:34,720
Yes, it's her!

1839
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:39,120
It's not her death!

1840
01:55:39,820 --> 01:55:40,820
Sorry, sir.

1841
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:48,120
McKay!

1842
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:50,620
Naza!

1843
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:52,320
Naza!

1844
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:21,460
Come to say goodbye.

1845
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:23,100
What?

1846
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:24,420
Jesus Christ!

1847
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:23,960
I knew you would make it!

1848
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:25,460
Is the baby okay?

1849
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:27,360
Look!

1850
01:58:20,365 --> 01:58:21,365
You're also afraid.

1851
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:30,240
Yeah, I'm afraid.

1852
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:32,230
I need you, human.

1853
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:35,190
You're important.

1854
01:58:37,585 --> 01:58:38,630
Come to me, my boy.

1855
01:59:24,150 --> 01:59:32,150
Okay, guys!

1856
01:59:32,810 --> 01:59:33,810
Guys!

1857
01:59:34,410 --> 01:59:35,410
Don't be shy.

1858
01:59:35,490 --> 01:59:37,170
Sit down, take your seats.

1859
01:59:37,905 --> 01:59:40,110
The groundbreaking
ceremony will come later.

1860
01:59:40,270 --> 01:59:41,950
But we'll start with the expendable stuff.

1861
01:59:42,690 --> 01:59:44,830
Mickey, come up to the front, mate.

1862
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:48,430
Can someone please sit on the
front row, you fucking introverts.

1863
01:59:55,620 --> 01:59:56,620
Hello everyone.

1864
01:59:57,670 --> 01:59:59,391
I'm Nasha Barrage, member of the committee.

1865
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:05,980
After weeks of debate, we have
finally come to this momentous day.

1866
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,460
The day we abolish the
Expendables Programme.

1867
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:13,151
I would like to thank my fellow
committee members for their support.

1868
02:00:13,690 --> 02:00:15,320
I've been really feeling the love.

1869
02:00:15,970 --> 02:00:18,300
And especially for
fighting right to the end

1870
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:22,820
and persuading the committee to
permanently abolish human printing.

1871
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:27,700
I would like to thank our
very own Mickey Barnes.

1872
02:00:29,670 --> 02:00:32,740
And to be fair, I'm just so fucking
happy I get to grow old with Mickey.

1873
02:00:32,980 --> 02:00:34,740
I was really stuck in
getting old by myself.

1874
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:36,600
Okay.

1875
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:39,340
Alright.

1876
02:00:41,770 --> 02:00:42,770
So you hit the button.

1877
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:43,920
Wait.

1878
02:00:44,830 --> 02:00:45,911
Nasha will give the signal.

1879
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:47,140
You hit the button.

1880
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:47,720
Wait.

1881
02:00:47,990 --> 02:00:48,990
And then over there...

1882
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:51,680
Do I get up and press it or...?

1883
02:00:52,055 --> 02:00:53,055
No, in my seat, right?

1884
02:00:53,405 --> 02:00:55,140
I honestly couldn't give a fuck.

1885
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:00,080
Henceforth, on Niflheim, as on Earth,

1886
02:01:00,540 --> 02:01:03,200
human printing is now
permanently abolished.

1887
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:10,260
Here today, the human
printer will be burnt to ashes

1888
02:01:11,445 --> 02:01:12,500
and erased from memory.

1889
02:01:13,830 --> 02:01:14,940
Nasha's such a natural.

1890
02:01:15,830 --> 02:01:18,271
I think she could even run for
committee chair next election.

1891
02:01:19,005 --> 02:01:21,260
It blows my mind still to
think that this amazing woman

1892
02:01:21,261 --> 02:01:25,340
just six months ago was riding
with the rest of us in that shitty prison.

1893
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:30,000
The day Marshall got blown to dust,

1894
02:01:30,590 --> 02:01:33,060
Ilfa went into shock and
was taken to the psych ward.

1895
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:36,240
Rumors went around that
she slit her wrists there.

1896
02:01:37,180 --> 02:01:39,200
And everyone else
involved was shoved into jail

1897
02:01:39,201 --> 02:01:41,980
and somehow lucky Timo
squeezes out on parole.

1898
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:47,180
But as soon as he got out, he
spent every day dreading the moment

1899
02:01:47,181 --> 02:01:49,621
he'd come face to face with
the man who delivered the letter.

1900
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:53,320
The associate of Darius Blank.

1901
02:01:53,680 --> 02:01:55,320
Who one day finally jumped him.

1902
02:01:58,400 --> 02:01:59,880
It was a fight to the death.

1903
02:02:01,220 --> 02:02:04,880
In the end, the associate became a...

1904
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:06,780
cyclosoup.

1905
02:02:09,130 --> 02:02:10,130
Except for one ear.

1906
02:02:12,690 --> 02:02:15,520
Even at the trial, Timo
chooses to represent himself.

1907
02:02:17,865 --> 02:02:21,420
As he had his grip on me, he brought his
knife around to my midsection right here.

1908
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:23,660
And he sliced...
And he got released.

1909
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:25,281
...took him...
...on self-defense.

1910
02:02:26,235 --> 02:02:27,235
Classic Timo.

1911
02:02:28,165 --> 02:02:31,120
But our trials, on the other
hand, were never-ending.

1912
02:02:33,050 --> 02:02:36,500
It became a whole political
fight between all the pro-marshals

1913
02:02:37,110 --> 02:02:38,760
and the anti-marshals.

1914
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:41,720
But by then, Nasha had made up her mind.

1915
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:45,040
She'd overhauled the
committee and changed it herself.

1916
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:48,840
So after she got out, she
really did run in the election.

1917
02:02:50,425 --> 02:02:52,000
And she won in a landslide.

1918
02:02:54,050 --> 02:02:58,100
On her first day in the assembly,
Nasha was so cool about the whole thing.

1919
02:03:00,710 --> 02:03:02,800
I was very, very nervous.

1920
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:05,601
I don't think she really noticed, though.

1921
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:08,560
Nikki?

1922
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:10,601
I got the upgraded translator.

1923
02:03:10,700 --> 02:03:11,700
It just came out.

1924
02:03:15,525 --> 02:03:16,525
Okay, let's be fair.

1925
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:17,840
Can I ask you a question?

1926
02:03:19,820 --> 02:03:20,820
Go.

1927
02:03:22,350 --> 02:03:25,560
You said before about
extinction and all that.

1928
02:03:26,610 --> 02:03:27,740
When you're all like...

1929
02:03:29,630 --> 02:03:31,380
...and, like, screeching and everything.

1930
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:34,680
Mmm...

1931
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:38,540
...would that really
make our brains explode?

1932
02:03:39,550 --> 02:03:40,860
From, like, the pitch?

1933
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:44,960
Explode.

1934
02:03:46,055 --> 02:03:50,940
But you said that our
eyeballs would explode.

1935
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:53,440
Mmm...

1936
02:03:53,610 --> 02:03:55,060
...why not our eardrums?

1937
02:03:56,090 --> 02:03:57,660
Because it's, like, sound.

1938
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:02,200
All I explode.

1939
02:04:03,340 --> 02:04:04,340
Really?

1940
02:04:05,775 --> 02:04:06,900
Can you try it right here?

1941
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:07,960
Right now?

1942
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:27,230
Who said bluffing was only for humans?

1943
02:04:28,570 --> 02:04:30,510
Gotta love that, uh, poker face.

1944
02:04:31,820 --> 02:04:33,850
Yeah, and, uh, nice burp, too.

1945
02:05:40,030 --> 02:05:41,030
Uh, hello?

1946
02:05:42,410 --> 02:05:43,410
What are you doing here?

1947
02:05:44,270 --> 02:05:45,351
In the middle of the night?

1948
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:48,900
Well, I just, uh...

1949
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:50,940
...I thought you were in the hospital.

1950
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:51,860
Hey, watch it.

1951
02:05:51,861 --> 02:05:52,861
Look down.

1952
02:05:53,070 --> 02:05:54,480
Don't step on it.

1953
02:05:58,460 --> 02:05:59,701
It's a priceless delicacy, Bab.

1954
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:01,560
Go on.

1955
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:02,680
Take a dab.

1956
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:03,920
Have a taste.

1957
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:08,040
A what?

1958
02:06:08,430 --> 02:06:10,191
Now you're too good
for sauce off the floor?

1959
02:06:10,875 --> 02:06:13,996
You think anyone else would allow scum
like you to taste something so refined?

1960
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:15,700
What is...

1961
02:06:17,130 --> 02:06:18,130
...what is it made of?

1962
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:19,160
Rude.

1963
02:06:19,335 --> 02:06:20,335
Not how it works.

1964
02:06:21,070 --> 02:06:22,940
A taste of faith comes first.

1965
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:24,561
Then I tell you what's in it.

1966
02:06:25,070 --> 02:06:27,257
Mickey, you don't think
I'm letting you taste this

1967
02:06:27,269 --> 02:06:29,380
out of some high regard
for your palate, do you?

1968
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:30,840
It's the opposite.

1969
02:06:31,555 --> 02:06:34,202
A true masterpiece would
be a sauce that could

1970
02:06:34,214 --> 02:06:36,700
appeal to even an
ignorant cretin like you.

1971
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:45,980
Whatever.

1972
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:48,061
Fuck it. Taste it. Waste it. I don't care.

1973
02:06:48,210 --> 02:06:49,210
You're worthless now.

1974
02:06:49,910 --> 02:06:52,180
Much better to bring back my usual taster.

1975
02:06:52,340 --> 02:06:55,640
The supreme one with
an actually refined palate.

1976
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:00,640
Wait. That's...

1977
02:07:02,060 --> 02:07:04,880
Even his kidneys are
more handsome than you.

1978
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:11,160
Not this. It can't be.

1979
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:16,400
Of course it can.

1980
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:19,100
Admit it. It's what you want.

1981
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:21,500
It's what everyone wants.

1982
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:25,920
Hey, Ilfa.

1983
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:29,220
I just remembered.

1984
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:34,320
You died...

1985
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:36,580
...the day after Marshall.

1986
02:07:56,260 --> 02:07:58,600
Go ahead. Touch me.

1987
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:02,940
See if I'm ghost or human.

1988
02:08:08,060 --> 02:08:11,330
Ever since I was a kid,
I've had scary dreams.

1989
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:13,890
This time I wasn't scared.

1990
02:08:15,770 --> 02:08:18,670
I just thought to myself, what would 18 do?

1991
02:08:20,810 --> 02:08:21,810
Fuck off.

1992
02:08:23,410 --> 02:08:25,050
What are you doing? Press the button.

1993
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:27,150
Mickey, press it.

1994
02:08:38,890 --> 02:08:40,810
I am glad the printer's gone.

1995
02:08:41,070 --> 02:08:43,791
But a part of me can't
help feeling guilty that I

1996
02:08:43,803 --> 02:08:46,870
didn't let all the other
Mickeys have a chance at life.

1997
02:08:47,485 --> 02:08:49,390
But I have to stop feeling guilty.

1998
02:08:51,110 --> 02:08:52,850
It's okay for me to be happy.
