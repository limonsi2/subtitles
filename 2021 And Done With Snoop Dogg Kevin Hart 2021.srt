00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:00,700
- Woo.
Oh.

00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,070
- Yeah, it was good
to see you, man.

4
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,138
It's been about
a year and a half

5
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,307
since the Tokyo Olympics, man.

6
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,275
- No it hasn't.
It was like six months ago.

00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,977
We're in 2021, man.
- What?

9
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:11,878
Damn, you're right.

10
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,079
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

11
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,681
My short term memory.

12
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:17,817
- Short term memory?
You on that stuff, ain't you?

13
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,886
- What stuff?
- You what I'm talkin' about.

14
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,588
- Hey, man, we on TV.
- Okay.

15
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,857
- Three, two, one.

16
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,894
- 2021, what a year!

17
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,530
After spending 2020
in lockdown,

18
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:33,033
America was ready
to get down.

19
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:36,036
It was a 365 day
balls to the wall,

20
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,071
anything goes rager.

21
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,774
- This is absolutely insane!

22
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:44,477
- It was a year that
we flipped out and wigged out.

23
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,980
When some of us
drank too much beer,

24
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,582
others drank too much Kool-Aid.

25
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:54,354
According to the Chinese zodiac,
2021 was the year of the ox.

26
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,256
And boy, was it ever.

27
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,758
But it was also
the year of the goat,

28
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,927
the year the cat.
- I'm not a cat.

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,531
- Year of the squid,
the year of the seagull,

30
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:09,235
and definitely not
the year of the tiger.

31
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,339
In 2021,
the Bidens were welcomed in,

32
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,741
and the Cuomos were tossed out.

33
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:20,080
Facebook got Meta,
and this fool's ass got wetter.

34
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:24,451
Stadiums were packed,
some people got smacked,

35
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:29,356
Bennifer was back and
what this kid saw was wack.

36
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,395
It's the year Ted Cruz
fled to Cancun

37
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,765
and Captain Kirk
went to the goddamn moon.

38
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,201
- Oh, wow.

39
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,471
- Millions refused to get a job
and one desperately

40
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,873
tried to keep his job.

41
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:51,044
Some believed in Ted Lasso,
others believed Q,

42
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,714
and the world of social media
brought us these two.

43
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:58,885
- I'mma just island boy.
I'mma just island boy.

44
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:02,422
- Yeah, 2021 was poppin',
it was something to see.

45
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:07,193
Now, to make sense of it all
is Kevin Hart and Snoop D-o-gg.

46
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,132
- "Welcome to 2021 and Done",
I'm your homie,

47
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,700
Big Snoop D-o-gg,

48
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,603
The Dog Father, The Player,
The Coach, The Pimp,

49
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,873
The Liaison, The Executive,
The Money Maker,

50
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,109
The Producer of Algorithm,
and so on and so on.

51
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,310
- And I'm Kevin.

52
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,781
A.K.A., long, little feet,
uh, big nose, happy mouth.

53
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,651
Uh, long forehead,
little structure, uh,

54
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,620
big knuckles, small hands.

55
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,655
Um, that's all I got, Snoop.

56
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:36,923
- I like that.

57
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,492
You know, Kev, I'm just glad
we survived another brutal year.

58
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,928
I guess 2021 was better
than 2020,

59
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:42,862
but that's just like saying

60
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,097
the Jets are better
than the Lions.

61
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,099
[laughing]

62
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,702
- The Lions suck!
Yeah.

63
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,103
Now, uh, listen,
it's been a strange year,

64
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,271
and on this show,

65
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,239
we're gonna look back at
the stuff that you remember

66
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,375
and the shit that
you wish you could forget.

67
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,510
- Yeah, yeah.
Let's get into it.

68
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,513
It's time for
Shaking My Damn Headline.

69
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,349
- Oh, I like that.

70
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,551
Now, the year started off
with so much promise,

71
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,685
but less than a week in.

72
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,787
Well, it went off the rails
when a bunch of tourists

73
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,423
showed up for a field trip
in D.C.,

74
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,459
hoping to meet with
their congressmen

75
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,127
and hang with Mike Pence.

76
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,496
- Hang with Mike Pence?
Or hang Mike Pence?

77
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,530
- Oh my god.

78
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,332
- Let's take a look at
this white hot mess.

79
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:22,469
Oh, look at this.

80
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,536
This is when they
acted a fool.

81
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,372
January sixth, I remember
this like yesterday.

82
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,773
- Look at this.
- Look at this.

83
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,808
- Just shit.
- Just madness.

84
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,111
- What are you doing?
- Taking over the Capitol.

85
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,213
- Look at this dumb ass.
Look at you.

86
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,814
What you gonna do?

87
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,817
He got a bongo in his arm.

88
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,986
He's got a bongo on him!

89
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,554
This really makes you
just think like--

90
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:42,722
- I want him to fall.

91
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,891
- -what the fuck
are you doing, man?

92
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,860
- I need somebody to fall, Kev.
This is not right.

93
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,062
- Look at this.
Look at this idiot.

94
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,531
Oh! Oh!
[laughing]

95
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,333
Oh, come on.
Come on.

96
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,435
- Now that was an Olympic
highlight for your ass.

97
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,837
- Don't you lose your grip.
God damn.

98
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,939
- There was one true hero
that day.

99
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,342
Capitol Police Officer
Eugene Goodman,

100
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,678
who led the mob away from
the Senate chamber.

101
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,312
Roll the clip.

102
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,448
- Don't you come up-
don't you come up, boy.

103
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,349
- Boy.
- Boy.

104
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,483
- You see this little stick?

105
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,818
- All right,
I'mma go over here.

106
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,053
- That motherfucker get bigger
every time it hits your head.

107
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,721
- Hey, don't you go further.

108
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:19,592
Hey, hey, hey!
Get your ass back, bitch.

109
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:20,727
- See, that was
the smartest move

110
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,961
he made right there,

111
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,496
'cause there was political
people in that room.

112
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,266
And he knew he had to deter 'em
to go this way.

113
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,767
That was the smartest move
right there.

114
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,836
See, that-- he from the streets,
because he knew

115
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:30,870
how to psych them out.

116
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,072
They didn't even pay attention
to that room.

117
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,074
They started following him.

118
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,810
That was a great,
great strategic move.

119
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,244
- Yeah, he better than me.

120
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,713
I would have got 'em
off my ass.

121
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,214
I was like,
"That's who you want.

122
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,484
"You want the people in there.
Go that way."

123
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,919
That's exactly
what I would have did.

124
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,887
Yeah, that man
trying to be a hero.

125
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,090
Sometimes you got to
worry about yourself, man.

126
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,124
- That's a fact.

127
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,492
I think that clip would be
way more gangster

128
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:53,693
if we reverse that.

129
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:54,861
Look at him now.

130
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,363
Get your bitch ass outta here.
- What would I say?

131
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,330
- Got the stick.

132
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,498
- Want me to crack
your head, cuz?

133
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,567
- Get your motherfucking ass
outta here right now.

134
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,369
Back up, boy.
- Back up, bitch.

135
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,070
Yeah.
- I got this.

136
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,605
Don't even worry about
what's going on out here.

137
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,941
Y'all just stay in there.
I got this shit.

138
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,376
- Yeah.
- Yeah, get on back,

139
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,878
and I'm gonna run
these motherfuckers outta here.

140
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,214
Matter of fact, I'mma back
that nigga get outta here.

141
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:19,252
[laughter]

142
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,259
- Oh! Oh!
Yeah, kiss my ass.

143
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,228
That's what y'all gonna do.
Everybody.

144
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,496
By the way,
that's one of those moments

145
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,432
where you really look around and
you got the feeling to go,

146
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,134
"Why did I take this job?"

147
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,502
Like, when all those people
standing there,

148
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,504
you look and realize
you're the only one.

149
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,572
He been the only one there
for years.

150
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,307
He been only one there
for years,

151
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,476
and it's been the best job ever
'cause nothing's ever happened.

152
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,744
- No.

153
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,347
- On that day, he was like,
"Ain't this about a bitch."

154
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,648
"Where Charles at?
Charles--

155
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,483
- He kept doing-
he kept doing this too.

156
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,018
Pushing that little thing.

157
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,453
Weren't nobody
on the other end.

158
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:57,023
- Nobody-nobody-
he kept doing this.

159
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,125
What I say--
"Hey, Charles.

160
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,061
"Hey, Charles."
- What, nigga?

161
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,431
I'm at McDonald's.

162
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,399
- Charles, I need you to act
like you in the other room.

163
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,134
- What you want, nigga,
number five or four?

164
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,869
I need you to get
your black ass back up here.

165
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:13,173
[laughter]

166
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,575
- Hey.
All right.

167
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,777
These insurrectionists
not only looted laptops,

168
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,412
but one dude try to walk out
with a podium.

169
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,747
Look at this right here.

170
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,817
- Nah, that's not a podium,
Kev, that's actually a lectern.

171
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,218
- Is it?
- Yeah, it's a lectern.

172
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,419
- How the fuck
do you know that, Snoop?

173
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:30,957
- Two things about me, Kev--
I smoke and I know things.

174
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,625
I just can't believe
that this guy would, like,

175
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,361
try to smash and grab America.

176
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,228
This is a country,

177
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,763
not a Louis Vuitton store,
asshole.

178
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:37,931
- I mean,
it's just ridiculous.

179
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,099
Where's he going put that?

180
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,868
The insurrections led to
Trump's second impeachment,

181
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,103
and Trump lawyered up.

182
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,971
The only lawyer missing
from the dream team

183
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,639
was the cat right here.

184
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,609
- We're trying to-we're trying
to- can you hear me, judge?

185
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:50,643
- I can hear you.

186
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,179
I think it's a filter--
- It is.

187
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:56,349
I don't know how to remove it.

188
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:57,884
- I don't know
how to remove it, judge,

189
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,286
but can you hear me?
It's some thing.

190
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,255
My kids put this damn emoji
on my face.

191
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,257
I don't know how to move,
but, uh--

192
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,159
- I'm not a cat.

193
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:11,031
- That-- if you're live,
I'm not a cat.

194
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:15,335
He said-he said,
"I'm not a cat, judge.

195
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,237
"I promise I'm not a cat."

196
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,507
"I don't know how to get this--"
- Who the hell does--

197
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,842
- I don't know how to get this
off the computer, judge.

198
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,045
- I'm not a cat.
- I'm not being an asshole,

199
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,380
but this is not a cat
talking to you.

200
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,415
Oh.

201
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,650
After the impeachment,
Joe Biden was sworn in

202
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:31,651
as president.

203
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,054
The inauguration was
a star-studded affair

204
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,823
with J.Lo in Chanel.
- Nice.

205
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,091
- Oh my god, look at this.

206
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,293
Lady Gaga, she was
in a Schiaparelli.

207
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,695
- Mm-hmm, fashion.
- And Bernie Sanders.

208
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,096
Bernie Sanders was in
whoever the fuck

209
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,065
made these mittens.
Look at this here.

210
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,599
Look at that.
Look at those mittens.

211
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,534
- Nigga's mask on wrong.

212
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,902
He got his mask
to the wrong side.

213
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,203
What's going on, buddy?

214
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,739
- But the real star of the show
is the young poet laureate

215
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,507
Amanda Gorman.
Play the clip.

216
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,577
- The successors of a country
in a time

217
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,381
where a skinny black girl
descended from slaves

218
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:06,553
and raised by a single mother
can dream of becoming president,

219
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,056
only to find herself
reciting for one.

220
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,224
- Very strong.
- Strong.

221
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,192
- Come on, man.

222
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,360
- I mean, listen,
that's what our young

223
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,427
Black girls need to see.

224
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,129
They need to see--
- Black girl power!

225
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,697
- ...in positions of power.

226
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,065
That's a moment
in history right there.

227
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,133
- Great work, baby girl.

228
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,868
- Absolutely.
- We commend you on the show.

229
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:25,271
In 2021, Mother Earth
stopped all of us in our tracks.

230
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,041
Fires, hurricanes,
record-setting temperatures.

231
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,909
But not even a historic flood
in New York

232
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,512
could stop fries
from getting delivered on time.

233
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,414
Roll the clip.

234
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,049
- That's right.
- Gotta love it.

235
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,751
- I'm not gonna fucking ing
get a bad rating.

236
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:38,718
You want me to get
fucking two stars?

237
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:39,886
- Oh, he gonna get
a bad rating, nigga,

238
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,756
'cause them fries is
in the water right now.

239
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,057
I don't give a fuck
what you talking about.

240
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,825
That nigga done drop
my whole bag of fries

241
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,693
in the water.

242
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,994
- I mean, but he
gettin' em to me.

243
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,396
You know, I know
what's going on outside.

244
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,031
- I don't want
no soggy fries, nigga.

245
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,666
Don't put my fries
in the water, Cuz.

246
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,501
You keep- you hold them
motherfuckers up top like this

247
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,069
when you walking
through the water, 'kay?

248
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,270
- What commitment.

249
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,539
You know, in the summer,
we thought the pandemic was over

250
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,174
and life resumed
back to normal.

251
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,076
People were finally
letting their hair down.

252
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,578
Let's take a look this.

253
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,614
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, here we go.

254
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:08,782
- Her hair finna
get out of there.

255
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,016
Oh, it's going.
It's out.

256
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,217
Bye bye.

257
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,020
- Oh.
Time out.

258
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,755
She just turned
into The Exorcist.

259
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,057
Did you hear
what she just said?

260
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,227
- What'd she-what'd she say?

261
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,031
- Wig!
- My wig!

262
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,166
- My fuckin' wig.

263
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,668
- That ride needs
to be shut down.

264
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,603
Taking that girl
wig off like that.

265
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,440
That girl is a beautiful,
intelligent woman

266
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,542
that came to that park
to have a good time,

267
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,876
and she left without a wig.

268
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,912
That-- you should be ashamed
of yourself, park.

269
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,280
Shut it down.
- Yup.

270
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,115
- All right, Snoop,
let's keep it going.

271
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,351
- After a year of quarantine,
people seemed to forget

272
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,453
how to behave
out in the real world,

273
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,589
especially on airplanes.
Take a look.

274
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:54,027
- Sit down now.
- You can't hold us!

275
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,962
- Oh man.
- Down on the ground, sir.

276
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,797
- We're not on the ground.
- Yes, we are!

277
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,299
- Wow.

278
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,635
Yeah, see-see, this is
way too much patience.

279
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:03,703
It's way too much patience.

280
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,706
You gotta knock him
the fuck out right there,

281
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,607
right there.

282
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,075
- He already
knocking himself out.

283
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,577
- Look at this.
- Look at this sh-.

284
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,346
- Yeah, I see this.
He got to die.

285
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,748
You're not gonna
do this next to me.

286
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,982
- No.

287
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,717
What I'm gonna do is take
three, two people in the back

288
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,419
that I don't know and say,
"We finna come together

289
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,286
and kick his
motherfucking ass.

290
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,621
- We gonna beat his ass.

291
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,456
You're not going to look at me
and eat your mask.

292
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,925
No.
- Really? Really?

293
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,360
Oh, man, he calm now.
The police got him.

294
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,462
- Really?
What did I do?

295
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,031
Shut your stupid ass up.

296
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,433
You know what you did over here
growling at the goddamn

297
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,300
flight attendant.

298
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,468
- Why didn't they
cuff him, though,

299
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:36,569
that's that privilege again.
They didn't cuff him.

300
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:37,904
- By the way,
they shouldn't have trusted him

301
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,973
from the beginning.
He had on jean shorts.

302
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,410
I never met anybody
trustworthy in jean shorts.

303
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,145
Uh, in 2021,
the most boring thing

304
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,847
you could ever attend
finally got exciting.

305
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,783
I'm talking about
school board meetings.

306
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,151
Take a look at this clip
right here.

307
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,220
- The children and
your children's children

308
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,456
will be subjugated!

309
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,093
They will be asked,
"How many vaccines have you had?

310
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,063
"Have you been
a good little Nazi?

311
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,698
"Hail Fauci!?"

312
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,333
- I don't know who's next up
on that mic,

313
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,069
but that mic had a hot,
batch of COVID waiting for them.

314
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:13,573
- All variants included.

315
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,909
- That mic was a mess.
Jesus Christ.

316
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,578
Joining us now to make sense
of all this senselessness

317
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,214
and break down some of
the other big stories of 2021,

318
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,850
a man who never keeps it
on the DL.

319
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,419
Of course, I'm talking about
my brother, D.L. Hugley,

320
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:27,954
a.k.a. one of the kings
of comedy.

321
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,456
What up, D.L.?
- Hey now, what's up?

322
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,291
How y'all doing?
- Good, man.

323
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,393
- D.L., you didn't put
your Crocodile Dundee brim

324
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,295
on for this shit, huh?
- Fo sho, fo sho, fo sho.

325
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:38,498
You never know.

326
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,434
- I hope 2021
was better than 2020 for you

327
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:42,736
after you fainted on stage.

328
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:43,903
And I'm being
serious about you.

329
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,638
You are right physically,
mentally, you all right?

330
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:46,706
- Oh yeah, for sure.

331
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,408
Yeah, it took a while,
but you know,

332
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,543
2021 was challenging
for a lot of people.

333
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,379
But, uh, it was, uh,

334
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,713
it was an interesting
experience.

335
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,582
I learned a lot about myself

336
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,117
and I learned a lot
about the world.

337
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,652
But I never thought
I would see America

338
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:00,754
so frightened of a virus,

339
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,288
they let niggas
walk around with masks on.

340
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,725
[laughter]

341
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,296
- Yo, 2021, Juneteenth
finally became a holiday.

342
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,265
What's your feeling
about Juneteenth now?

343
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,366
- Well here's the thing.

344
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,568
It's interesting because
at a time when

345
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,203
they don't want to
teach slavery in school,

346
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,938
they want to commemorate
the end of it.

347
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,441
Like-- so good luck
explaining to kids

348
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,642
why they're off that day.

349
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,679
But I think we should
understand that Juneteenth

350
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:26,846
is the official--

351
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,848
is the commemoration of
the end of slavery.

352
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:31,818
Which is funny because
more white people will be off

353
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,087
on Juneteenth than us.

354
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,456
I think on Juneteenth, uh,
white people should have to

355
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,893
work all day for free.

356
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,862
- This motherfucker
got a great solution.

357
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,497
- Let's talk about
Joe Biden for a second.

358
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,766
You know, the black community
showed up for Joe Biden.

359
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,768
Do you feel like
he has delivered?

360
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,270
What's your take on that?

361
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,639
- I think that it's--
it would be like talking about

362
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,841
if the Atlanta Falcons
only had to play one quarter,

363
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,276
they would have been
Super Bowl champions.

364
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,178
But it's not.
It's four quarters.

365
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:01,381
Truth of the matter is,
our relationship with Joe Biden

366
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,816
was transactional.

367
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,418
If you have a transactional,
uh, relationship,

368
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,954
you gotta come through
with some transactions.

369
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:11,391
Like, you can't--
and they gotta be the ones

370
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,460
that the people
who voted for you find valuable.

371
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,395
So I think
the jury's still out.

372
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,797
I think he's done some things
I'm-- I've been pleased with

373
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,066
and some that I haven't been
very pleased with at all.

374
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,868
- D.L., you are--
you're the real deal.

375
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,770
I tell you all the time.
- Thanks, Man.

376
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,071
- Uh, and not only that.
You're a friend,

377
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,573
you're a brother,
and you're a legend.

378
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:27,707
So, man, please--

379
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,476
- I gotta say something
before we go.

380
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,245
First off, you-- this is like-
remember how nobody thought

381
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,347
stripes and-and polka dots
would to go together?

382
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:37,083
That's you and Snoop now.

383
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:40,420
You're seeing two men together
have so much fun, fucking up,

384
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:41,988
it's hilarious to me.

385
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:45,191
I can't believe-I can't believe
that they got you all

386
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,560
commentating on the world.
Thank, y'all, man.

387
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:48,695
Thank, y'all for having me on.
- Thank you.

388
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,230
- Thank you, man.
Thanks for coming on.

389
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,766
D.L., we appreciate you,
we love you.

390
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,733
- Likewise.

391
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:54,601
- Ladies gentlemen,
D.L. Hugley, king,

392
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,936
king of comedy, uh,
my brother.

393
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,238
I love you, man.
We'll talk soon.

394
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,072
- All right.
Thank you.

395
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,173
- Peace and love.
Love you, boy.

396
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,207
- Wow.

397
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,642
Hey, people will be right back
with more of

398
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:09,215
Welcome back.

399
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,084
Snoop, you know what?

400
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,485
It's time to talk about
that one thing

401
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,888
that gets us fired up
more than anything else.

402
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,356
- Antiquing?
- No, no.

403
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,524
Snoop, that's not
what I'm talking about.

404
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,059
I'm talking about sports!

405
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,861
In 2021 we said goodbye to
cardboard cutouts,

406
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,596
and welcome back
to real fans.

407
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,167
And sports got balls out.
- Yes.

408
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,702
- It was a great year for
the world champion,

409
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:29,903
Milwaukee Bucks.

410
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,772
And one enthusiastic fan
couldn't curb his enthusiasm.

411
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:36,509
Take a look.

412
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,244
Uh oh.

413
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,947
Oh, if he chugs it,
he gonna go ham.

414
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,550
He about to go ham.

415
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,553
No. No.
- Take that motherfucker off.

416
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,789
- Oh, don't rip it.
Yeah.

417
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:50,623
You know what?

418
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,025
That's always good
in the moment.

419
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,328
But then after they stopped
the music and they go "Mah!"

420
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,429
and they start
the game back up--

421
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,630
- And he like, "It's cold.
Where my shirt at?"

422
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,466
- You just gotta
sit back down.

423
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,335
You ain't got no shirt on
and you notice the people

424
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,703
looking at your stupid ass.

425
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,305
- I feel that.
Looking at you.

426
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,272
- They're like,
"You don't have another shirt?

427
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,907
- No.

428
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:11,411
Tore this motherfucker off
in the heat of the moment.

429
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:15,749
The Bucks won the NBA Finals
and at the victory celebration,

430
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,717
there was less than
winning speeches.

431
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,219
Let's take a look.

432
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,589
- Well, I came here they're
like, "Yo, you gotta, like,

433
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,658
"show, like,
you got to be the dog.

434
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,894
And I'm like --
- What?

435
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,064
- Man, we got dogs.
Like, they just ain't, like--

436
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,167
- What?

437
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,870
- We're-- like, I got here,
like, we-we already got dogs.

438
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:37,837
- What?

439
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,606
- They just don't know
how to be dogs,

440
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,740
and we gonna be dogs.

441
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:41,775
- What are you talking about
right now?

442
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:47,681
P.J. first and foremost,
you guys are Bucks.

443
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:50,817
- And they were, like, you know,
you got to be the dog.

444
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,620
So I'm like,
we already got dogs.

445
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:54,888
- What?

446
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,122
- Yeah, but we
the Bucks though.

447
00:15:56,156 --> 00:16:00,260
- You just hear people
in the background going, what?

448
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,229
What, what?
What'd he say?

449
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:04,264
That's the part
that made me laugh.

450
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,665
That's why I'm like.

451
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,302
[laughing]

452
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,539
Don't even--
I'm like, what?

453
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,040
- Stop it.

454
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,208
- Uh, the Tampa Bay Bucs

455
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,343
celebrated their
Super Bowl victory

456
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,911
with a boat parade.

457
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,146
And even though he won
a seventh Lombardi,

458
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,617
Tom Brady partied like
it was his first championship.

459
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,053
- I'm open, Tom.
I'm wide open.

460
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,155
- Oh, wow!

461
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,790
- Hit me with it.

462
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,893
Look at this.
Come on, what?

463
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,962
Super Bowl?
What are you talking about?

464
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:39,299
Tom, why you got a knee brace?

465
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,469
- He had on a knee brace
at the after party?

466
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,404
- Tom, why got your--

467
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,706
Tom, don't ever
put your knee brace on

468
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,909
just to hang out, Tom.

469
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,177
- He was gone, man.

470
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,846
- That looked like that
Brett Favre commercial.

471
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,847
The copper--
What was it called?

472
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,015
- Coppertone.

473
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,016
- With him and Jerry Rice --
- Him and Jerry Rice

474
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:59,085
running them old ass routes.

475
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,421
He's out there playing
three on three with some bums.

476
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,023
- Hey.

477
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,491
- When I wear Coppertone,

478
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,260
I'm just as fast
as I was in 1987.

479
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,162
- Tom Brady,
don't you ever put

480
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,197
another goddamn
knee brace on

481
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:12,599
to go to a parade.

482
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,035
Sit your ass home if that's
what you gotta do, man.

483
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,636
- You sure you're in
a position to judge people

484
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,838
for getting to wild
after a Super Bowl, Kev?

485
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:19,906
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I remember

486
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,474
this thing happening
to you a few years ago.

487
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,044
- Late in the game,
you guys didn't flinch, and--

488
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,479
- Sorry to interrupt, but I got
a special fan for you.

489
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:27,847
How's Kevin Hart for you?

490
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,616
- Oh, he need--
he need a ladder.

491
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,886
- Not one of!
The best!

492
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,187
- I like it.

493
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,890
- How'd you feel when Brady
had that ball and got sacked?

494
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:38,191
Lost the ball.
- Look at my eye.

495
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,627
- I'll say this.
- Look at my eyes.

496
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,363
- We're very lucky
to have this guy

497
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,632
a part of this team.

498
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:49,569
I've been drinking.
[laughter]

499
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,705
- I'm on cloud nine.

500
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,773
That's the best part.
- You were so fucked up.

501
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,442
- Yeah!
- Here you was trying
to be professional.

502
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:56,543
That's the part
I'm tripping on.

503
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,744
- Yeah.
- But you was like up here,

504
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,013
I-I am on TV, but,
look, let me tell you all.

505
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,848
Look--
- Hey!

506
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,249
I have never been more--

507
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:04,751
I have never been
more intoxicated in my life.

508
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,120
But guess what?
I'd do the same thing again.

509
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,121
Have you ever had that?

510
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,323
Have you ever been
so-so messed up,

511
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,359
like that you-you're
trying to keep it together,

512
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,827
but while you're trying
to keep it together,

513
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,128
in your mind, you're like,

514
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,496
"I look stupid as
fuck right now."

515
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:19,032
- I definitely did that
when the Lakers hit the, uh,

516
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:20,333
they hit
the Portland Trailblazers

517
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,035
in their game seven.

518
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,037
And me and the homies
just busted in the locker room

519
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,372
at the end of the game.

520
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,873
And they was doing
an interview with Jim Hill.

521
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,041
We was like, "We don't
give a fuck.

522
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:28,942
What's happening, nigga?

523
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,710
The Lakers rule, nigga.

524
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,846
Nigga, we just
won, nigga.

525
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:33,913
That nigga Jim Hill
was like,

526
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,615
"Uh, uh, back to you."

527
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,584
[laughter]

528
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,052
And I was like,
damn, we was acting a fool,

529
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,186
but fuck it,
we was excited,

530
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,521
you know what I'm sayin'?
- Yeah, yeah.

531
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,423
- Now, the Atlanta Braves
brought home

532
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,326
their first championship
in 26 years.

533
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,895
Over a million people
turned out for the parade.

534
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,398
And after waiting
three hours for it to start,

535
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,433
this is what they saw.

536
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,868
- Ah!

537
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:58,238
- They going fast
as a motherfucker.

538
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,575
- Oh, my God!
- Why they going so fast, cuz?

539
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,345
- Holy shit, man.

540
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,480
You know that-that may be
the funniest clip

541
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,816
that we've seen all day.

542
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,284
They going like 35.

543
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,452
They going--
- Motherfuckin'--

544
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,355
Do they know what a parade's
fucking supposed to be?

545
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,523
- What did they
tell the drivers?

546
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,025
No matter what,
under no conditions

547
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,194
do you slow
this bitch down?

548
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:22,862
But this is the parade,
we just wanna see the people.

549
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,197
I don't give
a fuck what it is.

550
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,732
You drive this bitch
through there

551
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:29,803
until we get to a place
where I feel like it's safe.

552
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,404
They-they did 35, 40.

553
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,273
- They was flying
through that bitch, man.

554
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,841
- Jesus Christ!

555
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,443
Do you see the people there?
What the fuck is going on?

556
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,812
- I'm crying laughing
'cause they was going so fast.

557
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,447
- Oh, my God, man.

558
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,848
That's probably one of
the worst parades ever.

559
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,616
That's gonna go down
in history.

560
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,452
While we're celebrating
championships,

561
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,053
how about Candace Parker,

562
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,555
who came back
to her hometown

563
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:52,325
and brought the Chicago Sky
their first WNBA title?

564
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,461
Go ahead, Candace,
roll the clip.

565
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,930
- Nope.

566
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:59,532
- Candace, haul ass.
Go to your family. Go!

567
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,001
Go to your family,
Candace.

568
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,235
- Where they at?
- Hug 'em! Hug 'em!

569
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,236
- Find 'em!
- Come on,

570
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,170
- Come on, give me
a hug, my people.

571
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,372
- That's what I'm
talking about.

572
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,307
- I love it, I love it.
- Go back to my people.

573
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,009
Good for her, man.
- So happy for CP3.

574
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,110
- All jokes aside.

575
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:11,511
- Yeah, she did
that in, uh, L.A.

576
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,080
She was a great player
for the L.A. Sparks.

577
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:15,548
She-she did
great things for us,

578
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,150
but for her to go back
to her hometown

579
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,385
and get that
championship game,

580
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,619
I know that means
the world to her.

581
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:20,754
Shout out to CP3.

582
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,922
- I mean, I don't think
there's a better taste,

583
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,592
a better taste of success
for us athletes.

584
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,427
I, I know because of,

585
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,162
uh, my success in
the church league.

586
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,264
I told you, we won
a championship.

587
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,265
We played against--
- I would love to have

588
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,266
played against y'all

589
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,300
in the church league
championship games.

590
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,402
- I don't know why, Snoop.
We were quite--

591
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,237
we were-we were
the real deal, okay?

592
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,438
The real deal.
- Okay.

593
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,706
- I'll never forget
the championship game.

594
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,509
I had seven points,
eighteen assists,

595
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:45,478
36 rebounds, 15 blocks.

596
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:47,347
Uh, and I believe--
if I think--

597
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,615
what was it,
what was the other one?

598
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:49,883
Uh, I forced
a lot of turnover.

599
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,918
Either way, it was one
the best games ever played, man,

600
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,219
and they still talk about it.
- And I wish they had

601
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,055
a VHS back in the day
to see that.

602
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:56,690
- Well, brother, all you
gotta do is go to,

603
00:20:56,723 --> 00:21:00,293
uh, SaintChristian.com
ZionBaptistedu.,

604
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,462
uh, BasketballForGod,

605
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:04,631
and you'll see all
of my success, brother.

606
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,099
That's all you gotta do.

607
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,068
- In other news...
- Hoopin' for the Lord.

608
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:09,636
- Yes, praise God.

609
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,138
In 2021, boxing
made a big comeback.

610
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:14,607
But some of the biggest fights
didn't feature real boxers

611
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:17,977
like this match between
Lamar Odom and Aaron Carter?

612
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:19,779
- Oh, Jesus.
Look at this shit.

613
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:21,214
Jesus Christ, man.
- Look how big he is

614
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,817
to the dude he's fighting.
That isn't-- that's--

615
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,719
- Aaron was catching him though
in some of the rounds.

616
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:28,088
I actually-- here's what's bad,
I watched the fight.

617
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:30,290
[laughter]

618
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:32,459
I paid for it
and everything.

619
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:36,162
I was like, oh, this
is gonna be good.

620
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:39,099
I'm a firm believer.

621
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,901
I'm a supporter of
all these fights.

622
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:43,503
- So you spent that
$5.99 for that fight?

623
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,904
- Yeah, I remember
that now.

624
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:47,107
So that was like Lamar Odom
versus Aaron Carter.

625
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,441
I was like,
I gotta see this shit.

626
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,944
- Fighting live for $5.99.

627
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:52,712
- I thought,
this is gonna to be good.

628
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:54,347
This here is gonna
to be real good.

629
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,683
- Over in the UFC,
Conor McGregor broke his leg

630
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,685
during a fight
and it was nasty.

631
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,720
- Oh, my God, are you sure
you wanna see that photo?

632
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:01,655
I don't wanna look at it.
- Oh!

633
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:04,290
- God damn it, man.
Look at that.

634
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,959
- But I love
his-his-his tenacity

635
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,260
and his fierce way
of fighting.

636
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,895
He was talking shit
after he broke his leg.

637
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,296
He was, "I fuck him up,

638
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,565
there's nothing
he can do to me."

639
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,833
And his leg was
fucked up.

640
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:17,804
I'm like,
cuz still talking shit?

641
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:21,608
- Snoop just pulled
that accent out his ass.

642
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,076
It was great!

643
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:24,177
Oh, my God.

644
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,746
- He said that he believes
that one of the kicks

645
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,082
that he checked
is what broke your leg.

646
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:44,464
- Only Conor, man.

647
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:45,699
Only Conor.
- While his shit is broke,

648
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,267
in pain,
sitting on the ground

649
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,202
and Joe Rogan got
to sit down next to him,

650
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,670
'cause the nigga
can't stand up.

651
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,372
Who does the interview
sitting next to the nigga?

652
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:53,573
- I don't know.
But if his shit was broke,

653
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:54,941
he was extremely calm.

654
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,577
Tell you what, you wouldn't
had got a word out of me.

655
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,079
Jesus...
How you feel?

656
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:02,182
Fucked up, man.
Get me outta here!

657
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:03,850
Oh, my God.

658
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,386
My foot's in my ass, man.
Get me outta here.

659
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,854
Uh, you know, Snoop, man,

660
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,056
I think the best
sporting event of 2021

661
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,726
was actually
the 2020 Olympics.

662
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,228
- Hey, hey, you know,
what my favorite part
of the Olympics was?

663
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:17,230
- Oh, Snoop man, come on.
Don't say it.

664
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,065
You ain't gotta make me blush.
I already know.

665
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,433
- No, it's not you.

666
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:22,535
It's the horse.
Roll that clip.

667
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,805
- Oh! Oh!
- Hey! Yeah.

668
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,273
Oh, look at this, cuz.

669
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:29,909
- Oh, come on, man.
- This horse is off the chain.

670
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:33,513
I got to get this
motherfucker in the video.

671
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:34,948
- You made that horse famous.

672
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:37,584
That horse probably got
a lot of ass after that.

673
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:39,285
- He probably got
a lot of jealousy, too.

674
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,553
I know when he
went back in the barn,

675
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,355
all the other horses
was mad and shit.

676
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:43,590
Oh, you think you
something, huh?

677
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,959
You think you-you think
you hot 'cause you was on TV

678
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:47,927
and Snoop was talking
about you, huh?

679
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:49,829
Fuck you
and your fake ass hair.

680
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:52,932
[laughter]

681
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:55,402
- Our next guest gets in
a lot of passionate debates

682
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,803
every single morning.

683
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,038
You may know him
as an analyst,

684
00:23:58,038 --> 00:23:59,639
but I know him
as my alarm clock.

685
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:02,709
Here to give us the last take
on sports in 2021,

686
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:04,911
please welcome
Stephen A. Smith.

687
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,579
- What up? What up?
How you y'all doing?

688
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,214
- We all good, baby.
Good to see you, man.

689
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:09,282
I see you lookin' good.

690
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:10,784
Got the fireplace
in the background.

691
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:12,052
I like that.
I can put somethin'

692
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:13,720
on that fire
if you want me to.

693
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,588
- Hey, I don't mind.
Here's the only problem,

694
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:16,756
obviously I got
the fireplace on,

695
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,124
that means
it's cold outside.

696
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:19,659
- So, uh, we'd like
to welcome you to the show.

697
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:21,061
How was your 2021

698
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:23,563
and did you happen to get into
any disagreements this year?

699
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:26,399
- No, 15 segments a day,
75 a week,

700
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:27,534
over 3,000 a year,

701
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:30,170
I'd say I got into
my share of disagreements

702
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:33,239
pretty much every day,
every minute of every day.

703
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:36,309
Except I haven't lost
any of those disagreements,

704
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:37,677
and that's
the most important.

705
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:39,479
- 75,000 and 0.

706
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:41,214
- Stephen A. Smith,
two naked women just walked by

707
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:42,549
in the background,
explain it.

708
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:46,219
[laughter]
- That is a lie.

709
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:49,622
- Why you didn't turn around
and see if he was lying?

710
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:52,025
- He just sat up.

711
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:54,127
Oh!

712
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,197
Was 2021 a good year
for sports to you, Stephen?

713
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,199
- Well, for me personally,
I-I was shocked

714
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:02,635
to see that Tom Brady was
gonna smack down Kansas City

715
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:03,737
the way that they did.

716
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,438
I didn't think that
they'd be able to do that.

717
00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:08,041
Uh, but to see
a brother in his 40s

718
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,310
go out on that football field
against young lines,

719
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,545
against a stud
like Patrick Mahomes,

720
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:15,448
Travis Kelce's big time,
Tyreek Hill's big time.

721
00:25:15,482 --> 00:25:18,585
And to see Tom Brady do it,
but not just what he did,

722
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:19,719
it was how he did it.

723
00:25:19,753 --> 00:25:21,655
Remember, you saw him
going at the Honey Badger,

724
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:22,889
- Right.
- Tyrann Mathieu.

725
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:25,125
And we all got mad respect
for the honey badger,

726
00:25:25,158 --> 00:25:27,227
we know what a big time
player he is.

727
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,496
But it's one thing
to-to-to go at him,

728
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,197
it's another thing
to talk smack to him,

729
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:33,500
to get this face
during the Super Bowl,

730
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,201
to let him know
I'm coming for you,

731
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:36,770
and went for him
and got him,

732
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:39,105
'cause it made
this upcoming season

733
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:40,407
that much more beautiful.

734
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,376
We all thought that Kansas City
was relatively invincible

735
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,812
until we saw them
get smacked down like that.

736
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:48,181
- Uh, Stephen A. Smith,
we talkin' about 2021.

737
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,817
Let me tell you, um, one of
my least favorite moments.

738
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,552
And I-I think we got a clip.

739
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:54,454
Do we have the clip
of Stephen A. Smith

740
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:56,056
hitting the heavy bag

741
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:58,024
when he was
working out boxing?

742
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:01,261
Uh, just roll the clip
of Stephen A. Smith

743
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:03,830
throwing some of
the most aggressive uppercuts

744
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:06,399
that I've ever seen
in my life.

745
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:10,036
Uh, dressed like he has
never went to the gym.

746
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,805
Uh, Stephen A. Smith,
as you can see,

747
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:15,375
has on a pair of
the loosest gray sweatpants,

748
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:19,045
and a, uh, black tank top
that definitely doesn't fit.

749
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:22,148
It looks like it's been
through seven family reunions

750
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:25,051
and, uh, and two barbecues.

751
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:26,720
But boy, when I tell you,

752
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,822
this did not do good
for our race as well.

753
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,790
- I know that was rehab
for your rotator cuff.

754
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:32,092
- Yeah.
- I know that, so that was--

755
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:33,760
that was good work to show
that it was coming back to you.

756
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:35,095
Didn't nobody understand
the whole story

757
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:36,129
behind the video.
- Yeah.

758
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:38,064
- That was progress
on your rehabilitation.

759
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,133
- I'll tell you what
I do understand: bullsh-.

760
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,268
The trainer kept saying--

761
00:26:42,302 --> 00:26:44,437
the trainer kept
telling Stephen A.

762
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:48,241
good, good, good.

763
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,076
Good. That's--

764
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,445
And it shows
how easy it is for us

765
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:54,114
to get caught up
in the moment.

766
00:26:54,147 --> 00:26:56,282
He got caught up
in the goods.

767
00:26:56,316 --> 00:26:59,285
Uh, okay, let's get back to
some serious stuff right now.

768
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:02,889
- Steven A., I wanna speak to
the wisdom and the knowledge

769
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,858
that you speak to
when you on television.

770
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:06,326
I really appreciate you
for giving

771
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,261
the young homies
in the industry

772
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:11,131
and the young homies
in the-in the sports world

773
00:27:11,164 --> 00:27:13,299
understanding of
what they can and can't do,

774
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,567
and you try
to keep them straight.

775
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:15,769
And even though
they get mad at you,

776
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:18,204
I appreciate you and I do
know that behind your back,

777
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:19,372
they be thanking you.

778
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:21,041
They just ain't man enough
to say it to your face,

779
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:22,142
so I'mma say it for 'em.

780
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:23,276
Thank you.
- Nice.

781
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,378
- I love y'all as brothers.
I'm proud of y'all,

782
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:28,181
and I'm always, always, always
here for the both of y'all.

783
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:29,849
And that's just
real love as a brother.

784
00:27:29,883 --> 00:27:31,551
- Damn, look at that.
- That's heavy, right?

785
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:32,819
- Kicked it off
with a bang, man.

786
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:34,921
Stephen A. Smith,
thank you so much, Stephen.

787
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:36,956
We love you, man.

788
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:38,058
Wow.
- Peace.

789
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:39,059
- We'll be right back.
We got more highlights

790
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:42,162
and low lights in 2021
when we come back.

791
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:44,364
- Put chestnuts roasting on
a fire in the background.

792
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:46,166
- Stephen A. Smith, huh?
- That's nice.

793
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,338
- Welcome back to
"2021 and Done".

794
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:55,542
- 2021 was a jam-packed year
in entertainment.

795
00:27:55,575 --> 00:27:58,345
The best limited series on
Netflix was "True Story".

796
00:27:58,378 --> 00:27:59,746
- And that is a fact.

797
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,781
And the best album of the year
was "Algorithm".

798
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:03,383
- That is also a fact.

799
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:05,885
The best talk show of
the year was "Hart To Heart".

800
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,454
- And you do know that.

801
00:28:07,487 --> 00:28:09,923
And the best entertainment
sports show of the year

802
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,291
was "Olympic Highlights".

803
00:28:11,324 --> 00:28:12,859
- Man, if you don't
talk your talk,

804
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,294
I'mma walk my walk.

805
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:17,030
As a matter of fact, Snoop,
you already know I'm in a doop,

806
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,398
and I'mma tell you
something else,

807
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:19,699
I'll throw you for a loop.

808
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:22,035
Get the car, and I'mma
drive it around the hoop.

809
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:23,436
Who wanna get with me?

810
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,638
They better ask 2003,

811
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:28,141
because I now know
I'm where I'm supposed to be.

812
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:29,876
- Mmm!
- Wrapping up the charts

813
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:31,644
and being the... walk.

814
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:33,279
All right.

815
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:34,581
Okay, I'm sorry.
It's getting ridiculous.

816
00:28:34,614 --> 00:28:35,849
Let's just move on.

817
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:37,450
In one of the most watched
television events of the year,

818
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:39,219
Prince Harry
and Meghan Markle,

819
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:40,720
sat down with Oprah

820
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:42,455
to talk about leaving
the royal family.

821
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:45,425
And after hearing this shit,
well, it isn't hard to see why.

822
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,559
Watch this.
- Check it out.

823
00:28:46,593 --> 00:28:47,994
- Hold up, stop right now.
- There are several--

824
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:49,095
there are several
conversations about it.

825
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:52,599
- There's a conversation
with you-

826
00:28:52,632 --> 00:28:54,134
- With Harry.

827
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:57,604
---about how dark
your baby is going to be?

828
00:28:57,637 --> 00:28:58,738
- Huh?

829
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:00,840
- Potentially, and what that
would mean or look like.

830
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:01,875
- Ooh.

831
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:03,677
- Oh, God, don't freeze frame
Oprah like that.

832
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,544
Come on, man.
- Don't do her like that

833
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:05,512
with her mouth like that.

834
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:07,414
- Don't do freeze frame
Oprah like that.

835
00:29:07,447 --> 00:29:09,282
Uh, I mean,
look, that was tough.

836
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:10,216
But you know what?
- That was tough.

837
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,685
- We gotta stand
by Harry, man.

838
00:29:11,718 --> 00:29:13,219
Harry did the right thing.

839
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:14,621
That man sided with
his woman and said--

840
00:29:14,654 --> 00:29:16,056
- And said, you know what?
fuck that, I'm out.

841
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,290
- I'm out, I'm out.

842
00:29:17,324 --> 00:29:19,059
- You all gonna question
what color my baby gonna be

843
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:20,093
and all that?

844
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,194
That ain't got nothing
to do with nothing.

845
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:22,362
I love this woman right here.
- That's right.

846
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:24,130
- And if I love this woman,
love has no color on it.

847
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:27,434
- Mmm, said and shouldn't
be said any more.

848
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,169
- Mmm...
- God damn it, Snoop.

849
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:31,671
Sometimes you just get
so profound with it, man.

850
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:33,039
You know what you
made me wanna do?

851
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,474
- What?
- Sing another song.

852
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:36,710
* At the end of the day
I'mma flow my way *

853
00:29:36,743 --> 00:29:39,245
* Ask me where I'mma be
and it's another day *

854
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,581
* Don't matter what the
color is cause I do *

855
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:42,916
* What the fuck
you wanna see *

856
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:44,050
* It's me and Snoop *

857
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,219
Oh! That was an accident.

858
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:47,420
It came together
at the end, though.

859
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,255
- It really did.
- Came together at the end.

860
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:52,392
Uh, 2021, brought the end
of the Kardashians on E!

861
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:55,128
and the end of
Kim and Kanye in real life.

862
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:56,863
Uh, in the divorce,
Kim got the house

863
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,932
and Kanye got the stadium.
That's right.

864
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:01,434
When they separated,
Kanye moved into

865
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,837
Atlanta's
Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

866
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,972
This is actually Kanye's room.
Let's take a look.

867
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:07,741
- The motherfucker
really did move in.

868
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:09,209
- Yeah, yeah.

869
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:11,745
It looks like the women's gym
at the NCAA tournament.

870
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:12,946
Look at this shit.

871
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,881
Remember, they only
had three weights?

872
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:17,951
- It looked like
the Olympic dressing room--

873
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:20,387
- The box beds!
---with the beds. Exactly!

874
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,589
- Only Kanye.
Look at this shit, man.

875
00:30:22,622 --> 00:30:25,525
- Then he went to a game
later that night

876
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:28,194
that was on top of the stadium
that he was sleeping up under.

877
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:29,262
- Yeah, well,
when they said, Kanye,

878
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:30,263
what you about
to do after this?

879
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:31,331
I'm about to go downstairs
and go to bed.

880
00:30:31,364 --> 00:30:33,199
[laughter]
What?

881
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:35,268
Wh-What?

882
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:36,636
Yeah, I'm about to go
right to sleep.

883
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,571
I ain't gonna do
too much after this.

884
00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:39,906
I ain't trying
to be up all night.

885
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:41,574
I'm gonna go right downstairs
and go to bed.

886
00:30:41,608 --> 00:30:44,077
Tell 'em they gotta wrap
this basketball shit up.

887
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,946
I got a big day tomorrow.

888
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,515
- While he was living there,

889
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:50,884
Kanye was spotted
making an appearance

890
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:52,819
at one of those games
we talking about.

891
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,054
Let's check it out.

892
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:59,259
- Hey, Kanye!
- Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

893
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:01,061
Kanye got pantyhose
on his face.

894
00:31:01,094 --> 00:31:02,429
[coughing from laughter]

895
00:31:02,462 --> 00:31:05,565
Kanye-Kanye walked--

896
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,068
Kanye walked in
that bitch looking like

897
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:10,837
a bank robber
from the '80s.

898
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,206
Put the money in
the bag, bitch!

899
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,641
Luther?

900
00:31:14,674 --> 00:31:16,209
You know, they could always
see who was robbing them

901
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:17,377
in the pantyhose?

902
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,913
- Say, you jive-ass nigga.
Put the money in the bag.

903
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:24,184
[laughter]

904
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:26,152
- I don't wanna hear
shit you got to say

905
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:28,221
if there ain't
the money in the bag.

906
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:29,556
- Hey, man, I know you.

907
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:32,258
You don't know me.
Stop looking at me, man.

908
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:34,961
Just put the money
in the fucking bag.

909
00:31:34,995 --> 00:31:36,229
- Yo, roll the clip again.

910
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,365
Let me see what he had on
walking to the gym again.

911
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,868
Look at this shit here.
God damn it.

912
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,903
God damn it, Kanye.

913
00:31:43,937 --> 00:31:46,473
- Nigga had on the
Eddie Murphy "Delirious" outfit

914
00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:47,774
with a stocking cap.

915
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:49,843
[laughter]

916
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:53,613
I can't make
this shit up, man.

917
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:55,915
- You gotta-you gotta-- I mean,
there's only one Kanye, man.

918
00:31:55,949 --> 00:31:58,485
You know, Kanye was trying
to hide from the paparazzi,

919
00:31:58,518 --> 00:32:00,053
but the pantyhose
weren't enough.

920
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:01,254
So he took it
to the next level,

921
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,356
as seen in this photo.
Look at this right here.

922
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,691
- Oh, shit.
- Yup, there it is right there.

923
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:06,626
Yeah, yeah.

924
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,361
By the way,
perfectly normal.

925
00:32:08,395 --> 00:32:10,296
I don't know who that is.

926
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,432
Who's that?
Who's this?

927
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:15,735
Who's this regular guy
at the bank?

928
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,371
This isn't suspicious
at all.

929
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:19,939
I'm not scared.

930
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:21,608
I'm not scared at all.

931
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:24,444
Who is this man monster
that looks perfectly normal?

932
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:27,113
He doesn't eat people.
Who the fuck is this?

933
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:29,249
Oh, he's got black eyes.

934
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:30,717
Look at this fucking--

935
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,786
look at the mask
and then look at the eyes.

936
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:34,387
- This shit is amazing, man,
that he would do some--

937
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:35,455
- What is Kanye
trying to do, man?

938
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:36,656
- I don't know.

939
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,092
This year, the people
started a movement

940
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:42,896
to #FreeBritney,
and it worked.

941
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:45,565
- Fans are important.

942
00:32:45,598 --> 00:32:48,802
That right there,
that should not be

943
00:32:48,835 --> 00:32:49,903
just looked past.

944
00:32:49,936 --> 00:32:51,204
That's love.

945
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:53,473
That's people standing by
who they've supported

946
00:32:53,506 --> 00:32:54,474
over the years.

947
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:55,375
That's dope as hell, man.

948
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:56,743
- Yeah.
No justice, no peace.

949
00:32:56,776 --> 00:32:58,511
Get Britney
on these streets.

950
00:32:58,545 --> 00:33:00,680
[laughter]

951
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:11,191
- I don't-I don't know
how he does it,

952
00:33:11,224 --> 00:33:12,092
he just does it.

953
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:14,127
Shit just comes
to him so fast.

954
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,062
My last rap, it thought--
I literally took about

955
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:18,932
ten minutes thinking of
that shit before I did it.

956
00:33:18,965 --> 00:33:21,401
It was an incredible year in
entertainment and pop culture,

957
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,636
so we thought,
who better to check in with

958
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,306
than the only guy
who's on TV more than us?

959
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,074
You know him from
"Good Morning America"

960
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:29,776
and "Fox Football Sunday",

961
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:31,978
please welcome the man,
the myth, the legend,

962
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:33,279
Michael Strahan.

963
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:34,547
- What's up, fellas?

964
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:35,582
- There he is.
- What's up?

965
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:36,616
- There he is.
- Where you at, Mike?

966
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:37,884
In the closet?
Wh-where they got you?

967
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:39,619
In a closet doing
an interview?

968
00:33:39,652 --> 00:33:41,855
- Hey, you know what,
Snoop, you-you know,

969
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,256
when you do all right
for yourself,

970
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,392
this is what you call
a bookshelf, buddy.

971
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:46,893
This is, like,
an office, baby.

972
00:33:46,926 --> 00:33:48,595
Look how expansive it is.

973
00:33:48,628 --> 00:33:50,263
- Hey, I haven't read
in a long time, Mike.

974
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:51,531
Reading is fundamental.

975
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:53,700
I may have to come over
and borrow a book or something.

976
00:33:53,733 --> 00:33:54,634
- Nah, nah, nah.

977
00:33:54,668 --> 00:33:55,902
I never open 'em,
they just look good.

978
00:33:55,935 --> 00:33:57,237
I buy these big thick books,

979
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,505
they'll look good.
- They just look good.

980
00:33:58,538 --> 00:33:59,806
- I was watching
the NFL, man,

981
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,741
and I love how they
gave you your flowers, man

982
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:03,576
on the air, man.
How does that feel?

983
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,679
Getting that appreciation
from your coworkers, man,

984
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:08,114
those Hall of Famers that was
giving you that love that day?

985
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:09,749
- You know what, man?
It's-it's amazing.

986
00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:11,885
I-I-I mean, to have
your-your teammates,

987
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,386
the guys you played with

988
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,855
to show love by showing up,
man, meant the world to me.

989
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,490
And the Giants
retired my jersey,

990
00:34:17,524 --> 00:34:19,059
I never thought
that was gonna happen.

991
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,427
You know, I'm out there
just trying to survive,

992
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,628
just trying to keep a job

993
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:23,363
so I had to move back
in with my parents.

994
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:25,365
Next thing you know,
my jersey's gonna hang

995
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:26,666
in the rafters forever.

996
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,101
So that was a big--
that was incredible.

997
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:29,369
That was incredible.

998
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:30,970
- Well, Mike, listen, you know
nobody likes the trash you

999
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:32,939
more than I do,
but in this moment,

1000
00:34:32,972 --> 00:34:34,908
I'm going to take
the high road.

1001
00:34:34,941 --> 00:34:37,610
And I gotta honestly say,
it's well deserved.

1002
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:39,913
I talk trash to your face.

1003
00:34:39,946 --> 00:34:42,515
I-I try my best to get you
off your rocker.

1004
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:45,085
But I can say, man,
that-that jersey,

1005
00:34:45,118 --> 00:34:46,720
it belongs
in the-in the rafters.

1006
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,022
That's the last time that
you're gonna hear me say

1007
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:50,123
anything nice to you.

1008
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:51,591
Don't you ever
expect it again.

1009
00:34:51,624 --> 00:34:52,892
I'm doing it because
you deserve it.

1010
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:55,428
This is the end of the year,
we're-we're wrapping it up,

1011
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:57,530
so I felt like I should throw
something nice to you in it.

1012
00:34:57,564 --> 00:34:59,532
All right? So don't
ever expect it again.

1013
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:01,201
That's the only time.

1014
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:02,502
- All right, Kev--
Kevin, if you do that again,

1015
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:03,503
I know something's wrong.

1016
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:04,437
- Yeah.
- Something's wrong.

1017
00:35:04,471 --> 00:35:05,672
- Let's get into
the year, man.

1018
00:35:05,705 --> 00:35:07,340
What do you feel,
in your opinion,

1019
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:09,609
was the biggest entertainment
story of the year?

1020
00:35:09,642 --> 00:35:10,677
- Oh, man!

1021
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,679
Dave Chappelle is one
of the biggest, I think.

1022
00:35:12,712 --> 00:35:13,446
- Ahh.
- You know?

1023
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,381
- Yeah.

1024
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:15,882
- I think that was one of
the biggest

1025
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:18,084
because comedy has always been
that one place

1026
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,686
where people can go when--

1027
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:21,755
if you're a great comic
at what you-you do,

1028
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:25,425
you can do it and kind of
not say have free reign,

1029
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,161
but you're able to kind of,
you know, balance it.

1030
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:29,095
- Um-hmm.
- And I do--

1031
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:30,497
I think that
the Dave Chappelle story

1032
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,333
and the cancel culture with him
was one of the biggest--

1033
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:34,234
biggest stories.

1034
00:35:34,267 --> 00:35:35,335
- It actually was.
- So, yeah.

1035
00:35:35,368 --> 00:35:37,070
- And this year we saw
the last James Bond movie

1036
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,204
with Daniel Craig.

1037
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:40,473
Is it true that you're playing
the next James Bond?

1038
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:42,609
- Ah, man.
Hey, first of all, I--

1039
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:43,810
they called me,
but I can't--

1040
00:35:43,843 --> 00:35:46,746
I can't do the accent, Snoop,
so, I pulled myself out.

1041
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,683
- You pulled yourself out.

1042
00:35:49,716 --> 00:35:52,285
Uh, did you agree with
<u>People Magazine's</u>decision

1043
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:55,288
to name Paul Rudd
the sexiest man alive?

1044
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:58,625
- Hey, Paul's my guy, man.
Laughing is sexy.

1045
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:00,160
- Which is why
I don't understand

1046
00:36:00,193 --> 00:36:01,795
why I keep getting robbed!

1047
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:04,397
Why do I keep getting robbed?

1048
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:06,900
Every year I'm overlooked.
Year after year, man.

1049
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:08,802
- So, Mike, you're one of
the best game show hosts

1050
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:10,070
I've ever seen.

1051
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:12,038
Why weren't you named
the new host of "Jeopardy"

1052
00:36:12,038 --> 00:36:13,039
this year?

1053
00:36:13,073 --> 00:36:14,140
I thought that was going to be
you to fill in

1054
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:15,442
for Alex Trebek, man.

1055
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,177
- Hey, Snoop,
I ain't smart enough for

1056
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,545
that show, man.

1057
00:36:18,578 --> 00:36:20,747
I sat on the couch with my mama
watching that show last week.

1058
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,048
I'm like, Mama, get it.

1059
00:36:22,048 --> 00:36:23,316
Because, you know, your mom--
my mom thinks

1060
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,417
she can win everything.

1061
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:26,286
And then after about
five wrong answers,

1062
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:28,154
she go, I'll stick to
"Wheel of Fortune".

1063
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:30,757
I said, yes, Mama,
stick with the wheel.

1064
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,392
Hey, your son ain't smart enough
for it either.

1065
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:34,627
I'm messin'--
I'm not smart enough for that.

1066
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:36,396
I'll stick with
"Pyramid", man.

1067
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:37,630
I'm good with it.

1068
00:36:37,664 --> 00:36:38,698
- I love the honesty.

1069
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:40,667
I mean, I think it takes
a smart man to realize

1070
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,068
that he's a dumb man

1071
00:36:42,068 --> 00:36:45,271
that puts him in a position
to be a better smart man.

1072
00:36:45,305 --> 00:36:47,540
I love it.
I love it.

1073
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:48,875
T-That's brilliant!

1074
00:36:48,908 --> 00:36:51,845
- Hey, Mike,
what gives you hope for 2022?

1075
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:54,614
- Oh, man, what gives me hope
for 2022?

1076
00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:57,817
Every year we go to
a military instillation.

1077
00:36:57,851 --> 00:37:01,454
And we do a-a show.

1078
00:37:01,488 --> 00:37:03,323
And then you go, you sit around
these young soldiers

1079
00:37:03,356 --> 00:37:05,025
and you realize
that we all right.

1080
00:37:05,025 --> 00:37:07,460
So, when we go to do things
with the military

1081
00:37:07,494 --> 00:37:09,262
and the people
who really protect our freedom

1082
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:10,497
here in this country

1083
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:15,035
and really are behind us
or in front of us in most ways,

1084
00:37:15,035 --> 00:37:16,302
it gives me hope, brother.

1085
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:17,937
Every time I see that
it kind of rejuvenates me

1086
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:18,905
about where we're at.

1087
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:19,939
- That sounds dope, Mike.
- That's dope.

1088
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,508
- And I just want to give you
a shout-out

1089
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:23,109
for joining us on the show.

1090
00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:24,377
We love you;
we appreciate you.

1091
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:27,213
- Man, I appreciate you.
- Peace and love, Mike.

1092
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:33,186
**

1093
00:37:34,054 --> 00:37:36,222
- Welcome back to
"2021 and Done".

1094
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:37,791
Social media had
a lot of likes

1095
00:37:37,824 --> 00:37:39,659
and some really big dislikes
this year.

1096
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:40,927
We're going to talk about
some of them

1097
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,897
in a segment that we're calling
"Viral Overload".

1098
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,400
- This past summer,
Kevin and I

1099
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,402
covered the Olympics on Peacock.

1100
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:51,438
And some of our clips
went viral.

1101
00:37:51,471 --> 00:37:54,140
But shortly after the Olympics,
a new trend popped up

1102
00:37:54,174 --> 00:37:55,809
on social media.

1103
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:57,477
The hood Olympics.

1104
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,812
Check this shit out.

1105
00:37:58,845 --> 00:38:02,849
[chatter]

1106
00:38:07,153 --> 00:38:10,023
- One, two, three,
four, five, six...

1107
00:38:10,023 --> 00:38:11,024
- Do you know
this was started by

1108
00:38:11,057 --> 00:38:12,926
some crackheads, right?
- Of course.

1109
00:38:13,026 --> 00:38:15,395
- This was a-this was a move
that the crackheads

1110
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:16,529
told the dope dealers,

1111
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:19,165
if I do this,
you give me a 20 rock.

1112
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,633
And then everybody
around the world

1113
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:23,036
started doing crackhead shit
and didn't even know it.

1114
00:38:25,872 --> 00:38:27,741
- All to go viral.
- Yep.

1115
00:38:27,774 --> 00:38:30,043
Just to be seen and break
your motherfucking neck.

1116
00:38:30,043 --> 00:38:31,911
- Bunch of people with
fucked up spines out there

1117
00:38:31,945 --> 00:38:33,113
because of this dumbass thing.

1118
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:34,180
- Bang!

1119
00:38:34,214 --> 00:38:36,483
- Necks and spines
rearranged all over.

1120
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:37,384
- Um-hmm.

1121
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:38,785
- Uh, that's a lot
of fail videos.

1122
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:41,287
But one guy successfully
took home the crate gold.

1123
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:42,422
Check him out.

1124
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:45,358
- Mike said he going up there
rolling up a blunt.

1125
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:47,060
- Oh, he's rolling up a blunt.

1126
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,663
Homeboy, if he pull this off,
he gonna get it.

1127
00:38:49,696 --> 00:38:52,332
He rollin' up?

1128
00:38:52,365 --> 00:38:56,736
Lookin' like DJ drama and
Drake and motherfucking--

1129
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,340
Every light-skinned nigga
I know.

1130
00:39:00,373 --> 00:39:02,676
- It's all good!
- Oh, he caught one, too.

1131
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:05,011
Them George is on point.
Look at his George.

1132
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:06,913
Oh, he licked it down.

1133
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:09,549
No spinnin' and lip it.

1134
00:39:09,582 --> 00:39:12,218
That's the spin lip technique
right there.

1135
00:39:12,252 --> 00:39:13,787
You do that good,
I'm gonna roll--

1136
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,188
when you rollin' a blunt,
that's the technique

1137
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:16,323
that you use
when you on the run.

1138
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:17,357
Like a lot of times we runnin'

1139
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,925
and tryin' to get
outta there fast rollin' up.

1140
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:21,027
He's--
[applause]

1141
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:24,197
- Give that nigga a lighter.
Give that nigga a lighter.

1142
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:28,034
- This nigga-this nigga right
here gets the standing

1143
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:29,336
motherfucking ov--
look at his homie on his side.

1144
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,638
- Oh, my god. Look.
Oh, yeah.

1145
00:39:31,671 --> 00:39:34,341
The hype up from everybody else
is what makes it even better.

1146
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:36,810
Yeah! Yeah!

1147
00:39:36,843 --> 00:39:38,144
Go get him a light!

1148
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:40,080
- Get that nigga light and
light that bleezie

1149
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:41,948
cause that was too easy.

1150
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,684
- If you're an aspiring artist,
social media is an amazing tool

1151
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:46,353
to help you
promote your talent.

1152
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:47,420
Roll the clip.

1153
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:49,255
* Cause I'm an island boy *

1154
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:51,358
* and I been trying to amaze *

1155
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:53,693
* Oh, I'm an island boy *

1156
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:56,029
* I'ma just island boy *

1157
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:58,064
* I'ma just island boy *

1158
00:39:58,098 --> 00:40:00,066
* I'm a good cute white boy *

1159
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,102
* Let me just keep that gun *

1160
00:40:02,135 --> 00:40:04,471
* Let me just
staring at the sun *

1161
00:40:04,504 --> 00:40:06,006
* I'ma fool gazing *

1162
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:07,741
* I'm like in the pool I stand *

1163
00:40:07,774 --> 00:40:09,476
* I'm an island boy *

1164
00:40:09,509 --> 00:40:10,944
* I put my vest on, yeah, *

1165
00:40:10,977 --> 00:40:14,047
* like a wild woman
tryin' to make it to the tall *

1166
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,150
* But I'm an island boy
I been tryin' to make it *

1167
00:40:17,183 --> 00:40:19,686
* I ain't singin' with
a gang gang slang *

1168
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:20,687
- Gang, gang.

1169
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,856
There they got
to use that word.

1170
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:25,458
I'm speechless.

1171
00:40:25,492 --> 00:40:26,993
- I'm not.
- Two goofballs in the pool.

1172
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:28,061
- You know why
I'm not speechless?

1173
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:29,763
- Why?

1174
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:34,868
- Because I'm an island boy.
[laughter]

1175
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:39,406
* I'm an island boy *

1176
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:42,108
* I'm an island boy *

1177
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:43,309
What is happening, man?

1178
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:46,112
- I don't know and
ain't tryin' to understand it.

1179
00:40:46,146 --> 00:40:47,213
- Dammit!

1180
00:40:47,247 --> 00:40:49,349
- What's understood
don't need to be explained

1181
00:40:49,382 --> 00:40:50,850
and I don't want to
understand it.

1182
00:40:50,884 --> 00:40:51,851
- Tell you what does.

1183
00:40:51,885 --> 00:40:52,485
Tell you what does
need to be explained.

1184
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:53,353
- What?

1185
00:40:53,386 --> 00:40:58,758
- How I became an island boy.

1186
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:00,393
- Knock it off, man!

1187
00:41:00,427 --> 00:41:02,228
* Cool and gay *

1188
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:03,330
- All right,
all right, all right.

1189
00:41:03,363 --> 00:41:05,198
We been making fun of
social media

1190
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:07,300
and we know that it can be
a very dark place.

1191
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:10,070
But it also brought
some joy in 2021.

1192
00:41:10,103 --> 00:41:12,572
Here to show us the lighter side
of social media

1193
00:41:12,605 --> 00:41:15,942
is our good friend,
comedian Lonnie Love.

1194
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:18,244
- Oh, Lonnie!

1195
00:41:18,278 --> 00:41:19,746
- Lonnie, don't show out
like that,

1196
00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:22,082
got all your little awards
and shit behind you.

1197
00:41:22,115 --> 00:41:24,317
You just showin' out.
Look at you!

1198
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:28,421
Just awards everywhere.
Go, girl!

1199
00:41:28,455 --> 00:41:31,958
Look at her!
You go, girl!

1200
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:33,259
- What-- wait!
- Hi, fellas!

1201
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:36,329
- What an asshole!
What an asshole!

1202
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:38,565
[laughter]

1203
00:41:38,598 --> 00:41:41,301
- I love you, too, Kevin.

1204
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:42,702
Now, look.
I want to--

1205
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:44,904
before I give you
my-my video clips

1206
00:41:44,938 --> 00:41:48,041
that I selected for you fellas;
I want to talk about

1207
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:50,310
how great of a year
this was for women.

1208
00:41:50,343 --> 00:41:52,879
Yes, I know you're excited
to hear about this, fellas,

1209
00:41:52,912 --> 00:41:54,581
so just hang in there.

1210
00:41:54,614 --> 00:41:58,451
We had Adele; she's going to
have a residency in 2022.

1211
00:41:58,485 --> 00:42:02,155
Jennifer let go of that
cheatin' ass fiancé

1212
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:04,624
and got a new one,
her old thang.

1213
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:07,727
And I'm like Bennifer 2.0,
I'm all for that.

1214
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:11,131
Tina Turner got inducted in
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

1215
00:42:11,164 --> 00:42:12,966
on her own.
- Yes! Yes!

1216
00:42:13,066 --> 00:42:16,069
- Without that
beatin' ass Ike.

1217
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:17,437
- Oh, my god!
- Yay for women!

1218
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:20,306
And we had the first female
vice president

1219
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,877
inducted this year.
It was a great year.

1220
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,645
Britney Spears was freed;

1221
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,081
Meghan got the hell
up out of Britain

1222
00:42:28,081 --> 00:42:30,984
and came on over here
and lived next to Kev.

1223
00:42:31,084 --> 00:42:32,218
That's what I heard.
- No.

1224
00:42:32,252 --> 00:42:36,723
[laughter]

1225
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:39,192
There goes the neighborhood.

1226
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:41,294
- Yeah, that's what I heard.

1227
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:43,663
No, it was an amazing year
for women, Lonnie.

1228
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:45,198
You-you couldn't have
said it better.

1229
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:48,034
And me and Snoop,
we support the women

1230
00:42:48,034 --> 00:42:51,171
that are thriving
in today's entertainment world

1231
00:42:51,204 --> 00:42:52,772
and just in life in general.

1232
00:42:52,806 --> 00:42:55,442
I'm definitely a supporter
of you and all your success.

1233
00:42:55,475 --> 00:42:56,843
You left yourself out of it.

1234
00:42:56,876 --> 00:42:58,912
I mean, look at the awards
and stuff in the back.

1235
00:42:58,945 --> 00:43:00,580
I mean, look at
your progression,

1236
00:43:00,613 --> 00:43:02,449
look at your growth.
- You're doing the same, wow!

1237
00:43:02,482 --> 00:43:03,683
- You should have
been on your own list.

1238
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:05,185
- Well, you know,
we've come a long way

1239
00:43:05,218 --> 00:43:07,620
since "Soul Plane",
Kev and Snoop.

1240
00:43:07,654 --> 00:43:08,655
- Yes, we have.
Yes, we have.

1241
00:43:08,688 --> 00:43:09,589
That's right!
- Right.

1242
00:43:09,622 --> 00:43:10,857
- So, I almost
forgot about that!

1243
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,158
- Ain't that a reunion, huh?
- Ain't that about a bitch!

1244
00:43:12,192 --> 00:43:13,159
Yeah, Lonnie.

1245
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:14,094
- That's a hell of
a reunion right here.

1246
00:43:14,127 --> 00:43:15,161
Talk about it, Lonnie.

1247
00:43:15,195 --> 00:43:16,496
- God damn, I forgot about it!
- God is good.

1248
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:18,064
Look at us!
Look at us now!

1249
00:43:18,064 --> 00:43:19,532
- Kev was the star.

1250
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:22,435
Snoop was the costar;
he was the pilot.

1251
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:26,373
And we made $17
at the box office.

1252
00:43:26,406 --> 00:43:27,841
But look!
- Yeah. Yeah.

1253
00:43:27,874 --> 00:43:29,442
- Look what happened.
We are back together.

1254
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:31,277
So, this is an inspiration.

1255
00:43:31,311 --> 00:43:34,080
You guys have always been
an inspiration to me.

1256
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:37,417
And I want to show you
a couple of viral videos

1257
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,420
this year that I promise
that will warm your hearts.

1258
00:43:40,453 --> 00:43:43,390
So, roll it, Leslie!
Roll the clip!

1259
00:43:43,423 --> 00:43:44,324
- Aww.

1260
00:43:44,357 --> 00:43:45,859
- Oh, it's a little
chicken asleep.

1261
00:43:45,892 --> 00:43:48,461
- There we go.
That's good.

1262
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:51,331
- Is that what it is?
A baby chicken?

1263
00:43:51,364 --> 00:43:52,565
- It's a duckling.
- A duckling.

1264
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:53,867
- Okay.

1265
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,037
- Is that the ugly duckling?

1266
00:43:57,037 --> 00:43:58,338
- He's asleep.
- Yeah.

1267
00:43:58,371 --> 00:44:00,073
- Didn't that warm your heart?
I could feel it.

1268
00:44:00,106 --> 00:44:01,074
I could feel the look.

1269
00:44:01,107 --> 00:44:02,208
I could feel the warmth
in y'all heart.

1270
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:03,176
- Yeah.

1271
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:04,177
- Just wanna double check,
Lonnie,

1272
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,613
you went and found that
yourself, right?

1273
00:44:06,646 --> 00:44:08,048
You searched for that.
- Yes, I did.

1274
00:44:08,048 --> 00:44:09,182
- Okay.
- I said what--

1275
00:44:09,215 --> 00:44:11,184
what would encourage Kevin
and put a--

1276
00:44:11,217 --> 00:44:14,120
a smile on his face?
And I said a duckling.

1277
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:15,889
Something smaller than him.

1278
00:44:15,922 --> 00:44:18,658
I was like that is great.
- Okay, all right.

1279
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:19,859
- Now, I have something else.

1280
00:44:19,893 --> 00:44:21,561
I have something else
that maybe you guys would like

1281
00:44:21,594 --> 00:44:23,897
because you guys are fathers
and you work a lot.

1282
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,065
- Yes.

1283
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:26,466
- So, you're gonna love
this next viral video.

1284
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:28,802
I dare you not to cry.
This is a good one.

1285
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:29,836
Okay, let's watch.

1286
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:31,938
- Okay. I've got a tear
ready to fall now.

1287
00:44:31,971 --> 00:44:36,609
Oh, oh, wow!
See?

1288
00:44:36,643 --> 00:44:38,778
This is a dad's dream
right here, man.

1289
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:40,680
You see how
he threw that hat off?

1290
00:44:40,714 --> 00:44:41,648
- Yep.

1291
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:42,549
- He threw that hat off
and was like,

1292
00:44:42,582 --> 00:44:43,783
"Hey, that's my daddy
out there!

1293
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:45,685
"I don't give a damn about
nothing else but my daddy!"

1294
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:46,586
- That's right.

1295
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:47,821
- Yeah, I just want to
make sure--

1296
00:44:47,854 --> 00:44:49,556
I just want to make sure
I'm looking at the same videos.

1297
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:51,458
You talking about the baby
that just ran to his dad, right?

1298
00:44:51,491 --> 00:44:54,327
- Yeah.

1299
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:56,029
- Was he supposed to
run to somebody else?

1300
00:44:56,062 --> 00:44:58,498
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

1301
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:00,533
There was no--
there was nobody else out there.

1302
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:02,802
It's not like-it's not like
somebody else

1303
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:05,405
got out of the truck
and he made a decision.

1304
00:45:05,438 --> 00:45:08,108
It was one man
that stepped out the truck.

1305
00:45:08,141 --> 00:45:10,643
And the man probably said,
"Son, come here."

1306
00:45:10,677 --> 00:45:12,212
I mean, I-- okay.

1307
00:45:12,245 --> 00:45:15,148
Yeah, Lonnie, that's, uh,
my eyes are watering.

1308
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:19,152
Just right now I'm--
I'm a mess if you look at me.

1309
00:45:19,185 --> 00:45:20,787
That's an adorable
little boy, Lonnie.

1310
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,088
Thank you for that.
That's cool.

1311
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:23,757
- Okay, okay, I got one more.
- Oh.

1312
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:24,824
- Okay?

1313
00:45:24,858 --> 00:45:26,593
I got another one that'll
make you feel better

1314
00:45:26,626 --> 00:45:29,062
about the state of the world
in 2021.

1315
00:45:29,095 --> 00:45:30,263
- Okay.

1316
00:45:30,296 --> 00:45:31,665
- Now, we've seen so many people
using the social media

1317
00:45:31,698 --> 00:45:34,701
to show off their clothes and
their cars and their houses.

1318
00:45:34,734 --> 00:45:35,769
You know?

1319
00:45:35,802 --> 00:45:38,204
But this lady used
social media to give back.

1320
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:39,372
- Okay.
- Let's roll that clip.

1321
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:40,573
- Let's see it.

1322
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:06,399
Man, take
the motherfucking money!

1323
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:14,808
- I'm gonna tell you something.

1324
00:46:14,841 --> 00:46:17,644
Let them give that to--
to Jamal.

1325
00:46:17,677 --> 00:46:20,580
I know a dude named Jamal
that drive an Uber.

1326
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:21,915
"Hey, Jamal,
I want to give you--"

1327
00:46:21,948 --> 00:46:23,516
he gonna snatch that shit
out your hand.

1328
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,684
You won't even finish--

1329
00:46:24,718 --> 00:46:26,052
you won't even
finish the sentence.

1330
00:46:26,052 --> 00:46:28,054
- No, don't give-- no, no.
- No.

1331
00:46:28,088 --> 00:46:29,055
- This is a lot.
- No.

1332
00:46:29,055 --> 00:46:31,458
- That's a lot.
- You better not.

1333
00:46:31,491 --> 00:46:33,760
No, you're lying.
You're lying.

1334
00:46:33,793 --> 00:46:35,462
No, I'm serious,
I'll give it to you.

1335
00:46:35,495 --> 00:46:37,530
- Well, have a happy--
have a Happy New Year, fellas.

1336
00:46:37,564 --> 00:46:39,933
- Yes, Lonnie.
- We're gonna make 2022 great.

1337
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:41,067
Thank you so much.

1338
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:42,769
- And, Lonnie Love,

1339
00:46:42,802 --> 00:46:44,070

00:46:44,104 --> 00:46:45,805

1342
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:50,510
So, I want to give a shout-out
to the man behind the scenes.

1343
00:46:50,543 --> 00:46:52,212
I don't know where he at,
but he doin' somethin'

1344
00:46:52,245 --> 00:46:54,414
cause he got you smilin'!
- I heard-I heard...

1345
00:46:54,447 --> 00:46:55,548
- It's the ring light.
It's the ring light.

1346
00:46:55,582 --> 00:46:58,752
- No. No, I heard he was
a island boy.

1347
00:46:58,785 --> 00:47:02,389
[laughter]

1348
00:47:02,422 --> 00:47:03,657
- Get outta here!
- All right, Lonnie.

1349
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,691
Love you!

1350
00:47:04,724 --> 00:47:06,292
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
Lonnie Love,

1351
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:08,928
always great!
Thank you for uplifting us.

1352
00:47:09,029 --> 00:47:11,631
Hopefully we see more of that
in 2022.

1353
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:14,034
We'll be right back
with more after this.

1354
00:47:20,373 --> 00:47:21,041
Welcome back to
"2021 and Done".

1355
00:47:22,876 --> 00:47:25,145
This year, some people
struggled to get by on stimmies,

1356
00:47:25,178 --> 00:47:27,247
but some people
made so much money

1357
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,182
they flew their asses to space.

1358
00:47:29,215 --> 00:47:31,551
"This is All Up
in Your Business".

1359
00:47:31,584 --> 00:47:33,186
- Yeah, we nosey.

1360
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:35,755
Now, for rich people,
space is the new St. Bart's.

1361
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:39,326
Elon Musk, Richard Branson,
and Jeff Bezos all are competing

1362
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,561
to dominate
the final frontier.

1363
00:47:41,594 --> 00:47:43,797
Bezos sent four civilians
into space,

1364
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,332
including Captain Kirk!

1365
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:46,633
Let's take a look at this.

1366
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:47,634
- Ready to go.

1367
00:47:47,667 --> 00:47:49,169
- Let's listen in and
watch this launch.

1368
00:47:49,202 --> 00:47:51,237
Blue Origin.

1369
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:54,841
- Is that space?

1370
00:47:54,874 --> 00:47:55,842
- No. Shit!

1371
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:57,077
- That look like
the desert, cuz!

1372
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:59,112
- Looks like Utah.

1373
00:47:59,145 --> 00:48:02,015
- God, then done flew to
the hills of Utah or something.

1374
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:04,117
Like they went to space.
That's some bullshit!

1375
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:06,453
- It is so moving, commander.

1376
00:48:06,486 --> 00:48:10,023
This experience is
something unbelievable.

1377
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:11,858
- Beaming into our studios,

1378
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:15,028
please welcome
William Shatner!

1379
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:16,329
- Whoo!

1380
00:48:16,363 --> 00:48:17,664
- Captain Kirk,
what's up, baby?

1381
00:48:17,697 --> 00:48:18,565
- There he is!

1382
00:48:18,598 --> 00:48:20,900
- There I am!
I knew I was there.

1383
00:48:20,934 --> 00:48:23,036
That's called
a minor event.

1384
00:48:23,036 --> 00:48:24,604
There are four people
there to greet you.

1385
00:48:24,637 --> 00:48:26,039
Oh, I'm so happy
you're alive.

1386
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:28,108
Four people.
After a lifetime.

1387
00:48:28,141 --> 00:48:30,210
[laughter]

1388
00:48:30,243 --> 00:48:32,278
- William Shatner,
we just saw a video

1389
00:48:32,312 --> 00:48:34,681
of you getting shot into space
and coming down.

1390
00:48:34,714 --> 00:48:36,683
You seem to be emotional.

1391
00:48:36,716 --> 00:48:39,319
Could you describe
the moment for me?

1392
00:48:39,352 --> 00:48:44,524
- I had the most, uh,
unexpected reaction.

1393
00:48:44,557 --> 00:48:48,395
We got up there
and we hit weightlessness.

1394
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:52,265
And then we were allowed
out of this 5-point harness

1395
00:48:52,298 --> 00:48:54,034
that kept us in the chairs.

1396
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:55,301
And suddenly we're
floating around.

1397
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:58,004
And I had seen footage
of Jeff Bezos,

1398
00:48:58,004 --> 00:49:00,640
who had done
a previous trip,

1399
00:49:00,674 --> 00:49:04,077
in weightlessness
with his back to camera

1400
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:06,546
and his feet spread
and his little--

1401
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:09,382
his little tushie exposed.

1402
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:12,886
And one of the other people
in the spaceship

1403
00:49:12,919 --> 00:49:16,256
was throwing candies
at his little tushie.

1404
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:18,024
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yeah.

1405
00:49:18,058 --> 00:49:20,293
- Is he saying they was puttin'
candy in Jeff Bezos ass?

1406
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:21,895
I just want to make sure
I heard you correctly.

1407
00:49:21,928 --> 00:49:23,897
- Yeah, I-I didn't know
how far you guys went

1408
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:25,865
with ass and asshole.
- Yeah.

1409
00:49:25,899 --> 00:49:28,134
- Okay, either/or.
- I didn't know where to go.

1410
00:49:28,168 --> 00:49:29,235
- Yeah.
- But look,

1411
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:32,339
what's the difference
between Bezos rocket ship

1412
00:49:32,372 --> 00:49:35,842
and the Starship Enterprise?
- His asshole.

1413
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:37,410
[laughter]

1414
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:44,718
So, I looked
out the window,

1415
00:49:44,751 --> 00:49:46,252
and I was looking
down to my left

1416
00:49:46,286 --> 00:49:49,255
and I could see the way
the spaceship cut through

1417
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:50,590
the blue air.

1418
00:49:50,623 --> 00:49:52,292
And suddenly,
we were through it

1419
00:49:52,325 --> 00:49:55,729
and I looked up into
the right-hand side.

1420
00:49:55,762 --> 00:49:58,198
Oh, wow.

1421
00:49:58,231 --> 00:50:03,003
And I saw black,
black, ominous space.

1422
00:50:03,036 --> 00:50:06,139
And it was
so shocking to me.

1423
00:50:06,172 --> 00:50:08,375
I thought
I'd see moon, stars.

1424
00:50:08,408 --> 00:50:09,976
Nothing! It was--

1425
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:13,079
what I was looking at
looked to me like death.

1426
00:50:13,113 --> 00:50:14,581
- Wow!

1427
00:50:14,614 --> 00:50:17,083
William, man, we were
honestly in awe of the fact

1428
00:50:17,117 --> 00:50:18,051
that you did it.

1429
00:50:18,084 --> 00:50:19,552
We think it's dope
as hell.

1430
00:50:19,586 --> 00:50:21,221
- Thank you for taking us
to space, Kirk!

1431
00:50:21,254 --> 00:50:22,155
- Yes, sir.

1432
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:23,223
- It's a pleasure
to talk to you guys.

1433
00:50:23,256 --> 00:50:26,426
- Thank you so much.
- T.J. Hooker!

1434
00:50:26,459 --> 00:50:28,328
Hello!

1435
00:50:30,397 --> 00:50:33,066
From Bitcoin to Ethereum,
to Dogecoin,

1436
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:35,301
cryptocurrency
blew up in 2021.

1437
00:50:35,335 --> 00:50:36,536
- Oh, my god!
Indeed, it did!

1438
00:50:36,569 --> 00:50:38,405
Snoop, what do you know
about cryptocurrency?

1439
00:50:38,438 --> 00:50:39,673
- Well, I'm a Crip, cuz,
so you know I know about

1440
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:41,541
everything that got
crip in it.

1441
00:50:41,574 --> 00:50:42,976
- Well, Snoop, gotta be
honest with you.

1442
00:50:43,009 --> 00:50:44,511
I'm not sure if
that's how it works.

1443
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:47,180
But some people made a shitload
investing in this stuff.

1444
00:50:47,213 --> 00:50:49,049
Like this guy.
Take a look.

1445
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:51,851
- On February 5, Dogecoin
dipped back down to 4.5 cents

1446
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:56,122
and Glauber went all in
and invested $250,000.

1447
00:50:56,156 --> 00:50:57,857
- That's when I sell
all my stocks,

1448
00:50:57,891 --> 00:50:59,592
max out my credit cards,
call my mom,

1449
00:50:59,626 --> 00:51:02,929
my aunt, my uncle to borrow--
let me borrow some money

1450
00:51:02,962 --> 00:51:06,566
and I go all in on
Dogecoin at 4.5 cents.

1451
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:11,171
- On April 15 at 6 p.m.,
Glauber Contessoto

1452
00:51:11,204 --> 00:51:13,273
became a crypto millionaire.

1453
00:51:13,306 --> 00:51:15,308
- I just became a millionaire
by spending all my money

1454
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:16,543
on Dogecoin.

1455
00:51:16,576 --> 00:51:17,644
- That's really
not a millionaire

1456
00:51:17,677 --> 00:51:20,347
'cause Uncle Sam will
take half of that shit.

1457
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:23,249
- Once Uncle Sam
swipes at that, buddy,

1458
00:51:23,283 --> 00:51:25,251
you're gonna get a harsh
dose of what the fuck!

1459
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:26,786
- He gonna get an understanding.
- Yeah.

1460
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,488
- You 100,000-aire,
you can say that.

1461
00:51:28,521 --> 00:51:30,890
- Yeah. Yeah.
There you go.

1462
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:32,859
People took crypto to
the new level this year.

1463
00:51:32,892 --> 00:51:35,829
I mean, look, they use
blockchain to trade NFTs.

1464
00:51:35,862 --> 00:51:37,330
Snoop, do you got NFTs?
You got some, don't you?

1465
00:51:37,364 --> 00:51:38,798
- I got a whole--
yeah, I got some NFTs.

1466
00:51:38,832 --> 00:51:39,799
I got my mind
on my money

1467
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:41,267
and my money on NFTs.

1468
00:51:41,301 --> 00:51:43,103
I built a whole metaverse
called, uh,

1469
00:51:43,136 --> 00:51:45,005
you know what I'm saying,
the sandbox.

1470
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:46,573
Flexin' on them.
Check this out.

1471
00:51:46,606 --> 00:51:48,808
**

1472
00:51:48,842 --> 00:51:52,912
Hey! Get 'em, Dogg!

1473
00:51:52,946 --> 00:51:54,914
Get 'em Dogg.

1474
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:57,617
I don't know shit about it,
but I'm getting' this money.

1475
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:59,786
[laughter]

1476
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:01,588
Get 'em, Dogg!

1477
00:52:01,621 --> 00:52:02,756
Look at that nigga's party.

1478
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,357
Look at this fake nigga's party
in the fake world.

1479
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:06,126
- It's a metaverse.
- I know!

1480
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:07,827
- God damn it!
- And it's goin' down.

1481
00:52:07,861 --> 00:52:09,829
- It's goin' down.
Look like it's goin' up.

1482
00:52:09,863 --> 00:52:11,431
Look like you
crushin' over there.

1483
00:52:11,464 --> 00:52:12,766
- I'm getting' it in, Kev.
I got some property.

1484
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:13,867
You wanna buy
a little space over there?

1485
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,502
I got a little neighborhood.
- So, wait.

1486
00:52:15,535 --> 00:52:18,071
Just can you break it
down a little bit to me?

1487
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:20,573
Just what the world
of your metaverse is?

1488
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,742
- Yeah, so the metaverse
is like, you know,

1489
00:52:22,776 --> 00:52:24,844
it's real but it ain't real,
but then again it is real.

1490
00:52:24,878 --> 00:52:25,845
- Okay.
- And it's--

1491
00:52:25,879 --> 00:52:27,480
it's a place
where you live with avatars.

1492
00:52:27,514 --> 00:52:28,848
You got all kinds
of things goin' down.

1493
00:52:28,882 --> 00:52:30,116
Like whatever I do
in my real life

1494
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,317
is happening
in this world.

1495
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:33,453
And then we sellin' property,
we sellin' avatars,

1496
00:52:33,486 --> 00:52:34,788
and we sellin' space,

1497
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:37,624
and we sellin' all of the above
with the NFTs in that world

1498
00:52:37,657 --> 00:52:39,726
to create a whole
other metaverse

1499
00:52:39,759 --> 00:52:41,461
outside the universe.

1500
00:52:41,494 --> 00:52:42,562
Now, I know you don't
understand nothin'

1501
00:52:42,595 --> 00:52:46,466
about what I'm sayin',
but just listen to me.

1502
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:48,201
Like most people get
like this much space,

1503
00:52:48,234 --> 00:52:49,302
I got this much property.

1504
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:50,770
Hold on, let me lay
my shit out.

1505
00:52:50,804 --> 00:52:52,305
[mumbling]

1506
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:53,673
- All this is yours?
- Yeah, I got this one--

1507
00:52:53,707 --> 00:52:54,774
- This is all your metaverse?
- Yeah.

1508
00:52:54,808 --> 00:52:56,443
And everybody else
got like a corner.

1509
00:52:56,476 --> 00:52:57,577
- Ain't this a bitch.

1510
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:58,611
- So, people tryin' to be
my neighbors right now.

1511
00:52:58,645 --> 00:53:00,213
They tryin' to move
next to my community.

1512
00:53:00,246 --> 00:53:02,048
But I'm tryin' to put
a neighborhood watch together

1513
00:53:02,048 --> 00:53:04,317
'cause I don't need

1514
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:08,521
no ignorant shit around me
in my neighborhood.

1515
00:53:08,555 --> 00:53:09,789
- Now, last question.

1516
00:53:09,823 --> 00:53:11,658
How often
are you checkin' in

1517
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:12,926
on your-on your metaverse?

1518
00:53:12,959 --> 00:53:13,927
Is it like a daily thing?

1519
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,961
- Oh, I'm the landlord.
I'm the landlord.

1520
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:16,329
You know, they break bread
or fake dead,

1521
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:17,364
I'm gonna give you
them numbers.

1522
00:53:17,397 --> 00:53:18,365
When I give you
the number, Kev,

1523
00:53:18,398 --> 00:53:19,632
let me give you
the numbers on the low.

1524
00:53:23,603 --> 00:53:24,971
- You a goddamn--
hey, let me tell you

1525
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:26,072
something about Kevin Hart.

1526
00:53:26,072 --> 00:53:28,174
Kevin Hart just got himself
a metaverse, too.

1527
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:29,843
Uh, yeah.

1528
00:53:29,876 --> 00:53:31,611
Y'all gonna get to see
when my world is goin' in

1529
00:53:31,644 --> 00:53:33,179
and what's goin' down, man.

1530
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:35,982
Break bread or get dead
unless you wanna be fed.

1531
00:53:36,082 --> 00:53:38,351
Uh... Come in,

1532
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:39,986
that's my Mini Cooper
right there.

1533
00:53:40,086 --> 00:53:42,122
Snoop got a Cadillac.

1534
00:53:42,155 --> 00:53:44,090
That's my Mini Cooper.

1535
00:53:44,124 --> 00:53:45,625
Think of the homies
right there.

1536
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:48,094
I'm-I'm about to have
the same shit

1537
00:53:48,128 --> 00:53:49,496
or I'm gonna come
live with Snoop.

1538
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:50,830
Something' got to happen.
- Oh, shit!

1539
00:53:50,864 --> 00:53:52,032
- If those numbers
is real, brother,

1540
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:53,166
me and you are roomies.

1541
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:55,535
- I'm tellin' you, man.

1542
00:53:55,568 --> 00:53:57,837
Let me get back
to the script.

1543
00:53:57,871 --> 00:53:59,172
Crypto isn't the only place

1544
00:53:59,205 --> 00:54:00,473
where people
made money this year.

1545
00:54:00,507 --> 00:54:03,143
Some, uh, Reddit users
took it upon themselves

1546
00:54:03,176 --> 00:54:04,577
to disrupt Wall Street.

1547
00:54:04,611 --> 00:54:05,612
- Yes, they did.

1548
00:54:05,645 --> 00:54:06,913
People that never
invested before

1549
00:54:06,946 --> 00:54:08,848
decided to get
a piece of the action.

1550
00:54:08,882 --> 00:54:10,650
Take a look at this little
investor right here.

1551
00:54:10,684 --> 00:54:12,419
- She gave him
ten shares of GameStop

1552
00:54:12,452 --> 00:54:14,754
for Kwanzaa back in 2019.

1553
00:54:14,788 --> 00:54:15,655
- Wow.
- At the time,

1554
00:54:15,689 --> 00:54:17,791
it was worth
about 6-bucks a share.

1555
00:54:17,824 --> 00:54:19,659
- I know this kid
loves videogames.

1556
00:54:19,693 --> 00:54:21,628
And at the time,
I was teaching him,

1557
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:23,496
you know,
financial literacy.

1558
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:26,700
- She was saying that
I basically owned

1559
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:28,668
a small portion
of the company.

1560
00:54:28,702 --> 00:54:30,370
- Jaiden made
the call to cash out,

1561
00:54:30,403 --> 00:54:32,272
making more than $3,000.

1562
00:54:32,305 --> 00:54:33,540
- What are you going
to do with the money

1563
00:54:33,573 --> 00:54:35,108
that you've made
on GameStop?

1564
00:54:35,141 --> 00:54:38,078
- Come on, mama, you made him
cash out at 3 Gs?

1565
00:54:41,414 --> 00:54:44,184
- I-I think-I think we supposed
to make this positive.

1566
00:54:44,217 --> 00:54:46,986
[laughter]

1567
00:54:47,087 --> 00:54:49,789
- Man, that some bullshit.

1568
00:54:49,823 --> 00:54:52,792
- Well, I'll tell you what,
what a-what a time, right?

1569
00:54:52,826 --> 00:54:57,030
Just to-to breakdown of
life level of understanding

1570
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,231
to our youth

1571
00:54:58,264 --> 00:55:00,800
and pretty much just
make sure they understand

1572
00:55:00,834 --> 00:55:03,336
the world of stocks
and investing

1573
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,672
and that's what's
important today.

1574
00:55:05,705 --> 00:55:07,774
Um, man!
All right, you know what?

1575
00:55:07,807 --> 00:55:09,809
Here to drop more knowledge
on the world of business

1576
00:55:09,843 --> 00:55:12,679
and our economy is the owner
of the Dallas Mavericks

1577
00:55:12,712 --> 00:55:15,048
and the best-looking
shark since "Jaws".

1578
00:55:15,048 --> 00:55:18,051
Y'all show some love
for my guy Mark Cuban.

1579
00:55:18,051 --> 00:55:19,319
- What up, Kev?
What up, Snoop?

1580
00:55:19,352 --> 00:55:21,054
- Mark, what's happening
with it, baby?

1581
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,056
- Uh, just crackin',
havin' fun.

1582
00:55:23,056 --> 00:55:25,258
- Let's talk about
the highlights of 2021.

1583
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:28,261
Give me your biggest
highlight of 2021, Mark.

1584
00:55:28,294 --> 00:55:30,397
- Oh, the vaccine.

1585
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:32,766
Getting that vaccine
in my arm

1586
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:33,967
and getting into family.

1587
00:55:34,067 --> 00:55:35,935
That-that was
my highlight for 2021.

1588
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:39,072
And, you know, with all-all
the stress everybody has had

1589
00:55:39,072 --> 00:55:41,574
and all the battles over it,

1590
00:55:41,608 --> 00:55:45,412
just being able to-to have
a little bit of confidence

1591
00:55:45,445 --> 00:55:47,614
that, at least for, you know,
some period of time,

1592
00:55:47,647 --> 00:55:50,483
my-myself and my family
were protected.

1593
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:52,519
- Mark, uh,
you're a billionaire.

1594
00:55:52,552 --> 00:55:54,187
I know it.
The world knows it.

1595
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,556
Do you plan on launching
yourself into space soon?

1596
00:55:56,589 --> 00:55:58,091
- Hell no!

1597
00:55:58,124 --> 00:56:00,026
I'm afraid of heights,
guys, no lie.

1598
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,028
Like I won't even go on
a rollercoaster,

1599
00:56:02,028 --> 00:56:03,730
let alone a spaceship.

1600
00:56:03,763 --> 00:56:04,864
No.

1601
00:56:04,898 --> 00:56:07,200
- Oh, my God, with all
these supply chain issues,

1602
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:08,768
are you finding it
hard to import,

1603
00:56:08,802 --> 00:56:11,671
you know, more white players
from overseas?

1604
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:14,808
- Oh, damn!

1605
00:56:14,841 --> 00:56:15,775
Oh!

1606
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:17,577
And see, I even put
my Steelers jersey

1607
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,912
back there for you, Snoop.

1608
00:56:18,945 --> 00:56:21,214
I mean, right back there
I got my Steelers jersey.

1609
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:25,118
And here you are
killing me!

1610
00:56:25,151 --> 00:56:26,753
- Come on, MC, you know
it's love, baby.

1611
00:56:26,786 --> 00:56:27,921
You know it's love.
- I know it is.

1612
00:56:27,954 --> 00:56:30,090
I don't care if they're
from the moon.

1613
00:56:30,123 --> 00:56:33,526
If J-Jeff Bezos goes up
and grabs me one from Mars

1614
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,296
and he can come back
and play, I got him.

1615
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:38,832
- So, Mark, when you
become president in 2024,

1616
00:56:38,865 --> 00:56:41,868
what will you do to make sure
the economy runs smoother?

1617
00:56:41,901 --> 00:56:44,070
- First, I'm not
running for president.

1618
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:46,306
Two, what I would do,

1619
00:56:46,339 --> 00:56:48,808
we've just got to get
people more comfortable

1620
00:56:48,842 --> 00:56:50,010
with each other.

1621
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:51,144
That's the key
to it, right?

1622
00:56:51,177 --> 00:56:52,846
The economy is not
doing bad.

1623
00:56:52,879 --> 00:56:55,315
I mean, we're getting over
as much as we can,

1624
00:56:55,348 --> 00:56:57,117
but there's just
too much divisiveness

1625
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,551
and there's just
too much conflict.

1626
00:56:58,585 --> 00:57:01,021
And somebody's gotta go
out there and be a leader

1627
00:57:01,021 --> 00:57:03,256
and really just start to
bring people together.

1628
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:04,624
And I think it's possible,

1629
00:57:04,658 --> 00:57:06,493
but it's just gotta be
the right person.

1630
00:57:06,526 --> 00:57:08,495
- What I want to know is
how did you get people excited

1631
00:57:08,528 --> 00:57:10,096
about going back to work?

1632
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,831
- You know, people want
to deal with people, you know?

1633
00:57:11,865 --> 00:57:15,635
The cool thing about
the pandemic, if there is one,

1634
00:57:15,669 --> 00:57:17,704
people really got
to find out

1635
00:57:17,737 --> 00:57:20,040
more about themselves
and experiment.

1636
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,409
And that led to some people
going back to work,

1637
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:23,843
some people working
from home,

1638
00:57:23,877 --> 00:57:26,246
but a lot of people
starting businesses,

1639
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:28,615
a lot of people being
really creative

1640
00:57:28,648 --> 00:57:31,518
and, you know, selling NFTs,
learning about crypto

1641
00:57:31,551 --> 00:57:32,952
and new opportunities there.

1642
00:57:33,053 --> 00:57:35,322
We saw an explosion
of entrepreneurship.

1643
00:57:35,355 --> 00:57:36,756
- What was the dumbest
pitch you heard

1644
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,058
on "Shark Tank" this year?

1645
00:57:38,091 --> 00:57:39,359
- Goddammit!
- Oh, my God!

1646
00:57:39,392 --> 00:57:40,927
There were so many.

1647
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,396
We've had like
fart candles come on,

1648
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:45,865
wakin' bacon where you
wake up to the smell

1649
00:57:45,899 --> 00:57:48,635
of bacon in a toaster
that catches on fire.

1650
00:57:48,668 --> 00:57:50,470
I mean, it was just crazy.

1651
00:57:50,503 --> 00:57:52,005
So, this is
their life, right?

1652
00:57:52,038 --> 00:57:53,039
- Yeah.

1653
00:57:53,073 --> 00:57:54,307
- They put everything
that they own.

1654
00:57:54,341 --> 00:57:56,076
Lots of times it's
their life savings,

1655
00:57:56,109 --> 00:57:58,712
their family's life savings,
they mortgage their house.

1656
00:57:58,745 --> 00:58:01,247
And they come in and say
I-I believe in this so much.

1657
00:58:01,281 --> 00:58:02,615
And they've mortgaged
their house.

1658
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:04,117
And, you know,
like, oh, my God!

1659
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,752
And you feel horrible
for them.

1660
00:58:05,785 --> 00:58:07,754
But you've gotta respect
the grind, right?

1661
00:58:07,787 --> 00:58:08,788
- Yeah.

1662
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:10,023
- You gotta respect
that they went for it.

1663
00:58:10,023 --> 00:58:12,025
And so, that's why I always
try to give them advice

1664
00:58:12,025 --> 00:58:13,293
and always
wish them the best,

1665
00:58:13,326 --> 00:58:14,894
even if I think
it's awful.

1666
00:58:14,928 --> 00:58:16,062
But there's been
some good ones, too.

1667
00:58:16,096 --> 00:58:17,330
And Kev will tell you.

1668
00:58:17,364 --> 00:58:19,466
He's got some good ones that
we put-- we-we did together.

1669
00:58:19,499 --> 00:58:20,333
- That's dope.

1670
00:58:20,367 --> 00:58:22,035
So, I'm coming on
"Shark Tank" 2022.

1671
00:58:22,035 --> 00:58:23,336
Let's go ahead and sign off
on that right now.

1672
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:24,571
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do it!

1673
00:58:24,604 --> 00:58:25,338
- Let's make it official like
a referee with a whistle.

1674
00:58:25,372 --> 00:58:26,573
- Lock it in.
You gotta do it.

1675
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:27,540
- You better know.
- Hey, if we get

1676
00:58:27,574 --> 00:58:28,708
you both on at
the same time,

1677
00:58:28,742 --> 00:58:30,710
that-that's fire
right there.

1678
00:58:30,744 --> 00:58:32,045
- Done deal.
I like it.

1679
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:33,680
- Until Snoop cusses
one of them people out.

1680
00:58:33,713 --> 00:58:35,915
Hey, get your stupid
ass outta here!

1681
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:37,317
Your dumbass invention
you got.

1682
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:39,052
Get your dumbass
outta here, man!

1683
00:58:39,052 --> 00:58:42,455
I said no, cuz!
I said no, cuz!

1684
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:45,625
I ain't giving you
none of my money.

1685
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:48,628
- 2021 left so many people
searching for answers.

1686
00:58:48,662 --> 00:58:51,097
So, before you go, Mark,
I got a question for you.

1687
00:58:51,131 --> 00:58:55,235
Who's gonna play in
the 2022 NBA finals?

1688
00:58:55,268 --> 00:58:57,804
- Dallas Mavericks
versus I don't care!

1689
00:58:57,837 --> 00:58:59,873
- I like that answer.
I like it.

1690
00:58:59,906 --> 00:59:01,875
Peace and love.
Let's go Mavericks!

1691
00:59:01,908 --> 00:59:03,376
- Yes, sir!

1692
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:04,577
- Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

1693
00:59:10,517 --> 00:59:11,184
- Welcome back to
"2021 and Done".

1694
00:59:12,819 --> 00:59:14,287
- For the final word on
the year that has been

1695
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,022
both challenging
and inspiring,

1696
00:59:16,056 --> 00:59:18,591
we turn to a man who can
put it all into perspective

1697
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:20,393
with his unfiltered take
on everything

1698
00:59:20,427 --> 00:59:22,062
from politics
to pop culture.

1699
00:59:22,095 --> 00:59:24,731
Please welcome to
the show Killer Mike!

1700
00:59:24,764 --> 00:59:26,433
- Hey, what's up, fellas?
How y'all doin', man?

1701
00:59:26,466 --> 00:59:27,701
- There he is?
What's goin' on tonight?

1702
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:29,703
- Killer Mike,
what's happenin'?

1703
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:30,837
- Welcome!
- Oh, man,

1704
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:33,139
I'm glad to be in
the presence of kings, man.

1705
00:59:33,173 --> 00:59:34,240
Glad to be here.

1706
00:59:34,274 --> 00:59:35,842
- Let's not pull
any punches here, man.

1707
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:38,845
2021 was a mixed bag
for the Black community.

1708
00:59:38,878 --> 00:59:41,915
Do you see things
improving in 2022?

1709
00:59:41,948 --> 00:59:43,316
- Yeah, absolutely.

1710
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:45,919
Things are constantly
improving for Black people

1711
00:59:45,952 --> 00:59:47,587
because Black people
don't give up.

1712
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,856
Dick Gregory talked about
that, at our ability

1713
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:51,324
to, within
one to two generations,

1714
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:53,226
change the whole dynamic
of our families.

1715
00:59:53,259 --> 00:59:54,961
So, he was someone
I knew and loved

1716
00:59:54,995 --> 00:59:56,563
his last three years
in life

1717
00:59:56,596 --> 00:59:58,898
and he helped me to refuse
to look at the world cynically.

1718
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:00,900
So, Black people,
we always improving.

1719
01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:02,335
We always beatin' the odds.

1720
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:05,438
- Uh, Killer Mike, um,
what-what was the highlight

1721
01:00:05,472 --> 01:00:07,741
of 2021 for you, man?

1722
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:09,309
- Aw, man,
on a personal level,

1723
01:00:09,342 --> 01:00:11,411
my baby girl made
the JV team.

1724
01:00:11,444 --> 01:00:13,146
- Here you go!
Congrats!

1725
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:14,214
- But I tell you something.

1726
01:00:14,247 --> 01:00:16,683
We got a call from
a brother named JB

1727
01:00:16,716 --> 01:00:18,284
who's a rapper
in Oklahoma.

1728
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:19,619
And he said, man,
there's a brother named

1729
01:00:19,652 --> 01:00:22,689
Julius Jones here,
and he may be executed.

1730
01:00:22,722 --> 01:00:25,759
You know? And he's-he's
probably not guilty,

1731
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:27,560
based on what
other men have said

1732
01:00:27,594 --> 01:00:29,696
about another guy
said that he did it.

1733
01:00:29,729 --> 01:00:32,966
And right up until literally
the day before his execution,

1734
01:00:32,999 --> 01:00:36,036
like day of, the governor
of Oklahoma, Governor Stitt,

1735
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:38,605
was being petitioned
by smaller groups

1736
01:00:38,638 --> 01:00:40,240
to say, hey, we need help.

1737
01:00:40,273 --> 01:00:42,108
Me and Tip jumped
onboard the last minute

1738
01:00:42,142 --> 01:00:45,345
but it really was spearheaded
by people locally on the ground

1739
01:00:45,378 --> 01:00:47,447
and in the rap scene
by my guy JB.

1740
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,416
And the fact that
that brother got clemency,

1741
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:50,917
that was
a highlight for me.

1742
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:52,285
- Huge.
- And the other highlight

1743
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:55,188
was right here in Georgia,
I-I got to see three men,

1744
01:00:55,221 --> 01:00:57,357
who deservedly so,
get convicted

1745
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:00,060
on various forms of murder
on Ahmad Arbery.

1746
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,761
And I'm hoping that
as we get forward,

1747
01:01:01,795 --> 01:01:04,331
we will stop letting these
be the premier cases

1748
01:01:04,364 --> 01:01:06,666
and we can hear
more cases of justice

1749
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,668
gone right from the start
and not wrong

1750
01:01:08,702 --> 01:01:10,236
and we have to make
a fuss about it.

1751
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,471
- Mmm...
- So, Mike,

1752
01:01:11,504 --> 01:01:13,473
you spent a lot of time
with Bernie Sanders this year.

1753
01:01:13,506 --> 01:01:15,175
Did you burn one
with him?

1754
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:17,344
- Man, you know what?
He won't burn with me, man!

1755
01:01:17,377 --> 01:01:18,578
- Goddammit!
- He'll eat fried chicken,

1756
01:01:18,611 --> 01:01:20,647
but he won't burn
the dope with me, man.

1757
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,749
But-but listen,
it's my goal to get the OG

1758
01:01:22,782 --> 01:01:23,917
to burn one with me.

1759
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:25,952
It is my goal to burn it down
with Willie Nelson.

1760
01:01:25,985 --> 01:01:27,721
So, I know you know Willie.
- Yeah, I love it.

1761
01:01:27,754 --> 01:01:29,289
- I'm gonna make
the Willie Nelson play
happen for you.

1762
01:01:29,322 --> 01:01:30,757
Say less.
- Say less.

1763
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:31,958
- That's-that's a done deal.

1764
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:34,394
- What do you feel
we have to do in 2022

1765
01:01:34,427 --> 01:01:37,564
to bring more justice,
more hope, more opportunity,

1766
01:01:37,597 --> 01:01:38,999
and more laughs to the year?

1767
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:41,968
- I want to say, man, take care
of your coin Black people.

1768
01:01:42,002 --> 01:01:45,005
If we, as a community,
build our tax base

1769
01:01:45,105 --> 01:01:46,339
and take care of our money

1770
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:48,908
and take care of our own small
and medium businesses,

1771
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:50,944
then you become
financial donors

1772
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:53,346
to these local politicians
that want your vote.

1773
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,581
And then they forget
about you

1774
01:01:54,614 --> 01:01:56,316
and they have to respond
to you differently.

1775
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:58,752
If we, as a community,
are shopping with one another,

1776
01:01:58,785 --> 01:02:00,220
taking care of one another,

1777
01:02:00,253 --> 01:02:01,688
we starting to
create an economy

1778
01:02:01,721 --> 01:02:03,089
that takes care
of ourselves.

1779
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:05,258
Because ain't nobody
coming to save us,

1780
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:07,227
don't nobody
love us like us,

1781
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:10,196
and if we cheap labor,
they gonna always use us cheap.

1782
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,264
- Well equipped, man!

1783
01:02:11,297 --> 01:02:12,632
Well equipped with
a plethora

1784
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:14,367
of knowledge
and information, man.

1785
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:15,535
- So, why are you
gonna use plethora?

1786
01:02:15,568 --> 01:02:16,736
You don't even know
how to spell that shit.

1787
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:18,071
- Pleth-- I can spell
plethora right now.

1788
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:19,072
- Spell it right now, man.

1789
01:02:19,072 --> 01:02:20,173
- You want me to
spell it right now?

1790
01:02:20,206 --> 01:02:21,207
- Spell it.
- I can spell it right now.

1791
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:22,175
- It's the spelling bee.
- Right now.

1792
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:23,376
- Spell plethora.

1793
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,145
- Me spelling plethora,
that takes the light

1794
01:02:25,178 --> 01:02:26,446
off of Killer Mike.

1795
01:02:26,479 --> 01:02:27,414
And that's not
what I want to do.

1796
01:02:27,447 --> 01:02:28,515
- No, no, it don't.
- Yes, it does.

1797
01:02:28,548 --> 01:02:29,516
- Mike wanna know
you smart.

1798
01:02:29,549 --> 01:02:30,950
- No. It's not about me
right now, Snoop.

1799
01:02:30,984 --> 01:02:31,985
- Okay.
- So, after we're done

1800
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:33,119
with Killer Mike,
all right, then I'll go

1801
01:02:33,153 --> 01:02:34,254
and I'll spell it for you.
- All right.

1802
01:02:34,287 --> 01:02:35,955
- But right now, I want to
continue to shine a light

1803
01:02:35,989 --> 01:02:36,990
on this brother

1804
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,491
and the-and the amount
of positivity

1805
01:02:38,525 --> 01:02:41,328
that he's doing for us
and our community.

1806
01:02:41,361 --> 01:02:43,830
Mike, an amazing
conversation.

1807
01:02:43,863 --> 01:02:45,799
We appreciate you coming on
and showing us some love, man.

1808
01:02:45,832 --> 01:02:46,900
We love you.

1809
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:48,134
Thank you so much, man.
- Love you.

1810
01:02:48,168 --> 01:02:49,536
Love and respect, brother.
- Killer Mike for president!

1811
01:02:49,569 --> 01:02:52,739
- Yes, sir.
Take it easy, Mike.

1812
01:02:52,772 --> 01:02:54,808
Now, Snoop, before
we take a break, man,

1813
01:02:54,841 --> 01:02:56,409
I just wanna--
I want to take a moment.

1814
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:57,744
This is all kidding aside.

1815
01:02:57,777 --> 01:03:00,480
I just want to take a moment
just to-to have the opportunity

1816
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:02,682
to give you
my sincere condolences

1817
01:03:02,716 --> 01:03:04,751
for the loss of
your mother this year.

1818
01:03:04,784 --> 01:03:07,320
You know, I now how much
you adored your mom, Beverly.

1819
01:03:07,354 --> 01:03:08,655
And I know how much
she meant to you.

1820
01:03:08,688 --> 01:03:10,757
So, I feel like
we should take a moment

1821
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,459
to reflect on
the memory of your mom

1822
01:03:12,492 --> 01:03:13,793
and also some
of the other people

1823
01:03:13,827 --> 01:03:14,961
that we lost this year.

1824
01:03:15,061 --> 01:03:16,596
- Thank you, Kevin,
I appreciate that.

1825
01:03:16,629 --> 01:03:19,799
* Yeah 'til we meet again

* Until we meet again

1884
01:06:13,606 --> 01:06:15,542
- Welcome back to
"2021 and Done".

1885
01:06:15,575 --> 01:06:16,943

1886
01:06:17,043 --> 01:06:18,678
but celebrities get

sent to them ahead of time.

and I got an invite
to Oprah's inauguration.

1890
01:06:24,684 --> 01:06:25,752
Very true.

1891
01:06:25,785 --> 01:06:27,587
- They also send us all
of next year's stories

1892
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:30,523
so we already know what's
gonna happen in 2022.

1893
01:06:30,557 --> 01:06:32,125
- Yeah, You know, Snoop,
let's give 'em a little peek,

1894
01:06:32,158 --> 01:06:34,194
just a little sneak peek
at what we're talking about.

1895
01:06:34,227 --> 01:06:35,261
- A sneak peek?

1896
01:06:35,295 --> 01:06:36,429
- Yeah, guys, give us
those envelopes, please.

1897
01:06:36,463 --> 01:06:38,832
- The man in all black.
- Mm-hmm, thank you, man.

1898
01:06:38,865 --> 01:06:40,066
Appreciate it.

1899
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:41,768
Okay. First thing.
Cardi B.

1900
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:44,204
Cardi B's gonna hit menopause
and she's gonna release

1901
01:06:44,237 --> 01:06:48,742

- Megan Thee Stallion

1903
01:06:50,643 --> 01:06:54,414
to a beautiful baby boy
and name him Tony the Pony.

1904
01:06:54,447 --> 01:06:55,515
- Oh, man!

1905
01:06:55,548 --> 01:06:59,519
Not the pony!
Not Tony the Pony!

1906
01:06:59,552 --> 01:07:00,553
Kyle Rittenhouse

1907
01:07:00,587 --> 01:07:03,023
his new stand
your ground beef tacos.

1908
01:07:03,023 --> 01:07:06,192
So good, they'll make you cry
without tears. That's good.

1909
01:07:06,226 --> 01:07:08,762
- In an effort to put
the controversy behind them,

1910
01:07:08,795 --> 01:07:10,730
"Jeopardy" announces
its new host,

1911
01:07:10,764 --> 01:07:13,166
Dave Chappelle.
- Oh, shit!

1912
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:14,734
By the way,
it would be great.

1913
01:07:14,768 --> 01:07:16,503
- It would be.
- That'll be fucking strong.

1914
01:07:16,536 --> 01:07:18,471
I can see it.
- I'd like it.

1915
01:07:18,505 --> 01:07:21,074
- Colin Kaepernick
will turn down an offer

1916
01:07:21,107 --> 01:07:22,308
from the Jets, saying,

1917
01:07:22,342 --> 01:07:25,378
"I don't want to play
football that bad."

1918
01:07:25,412 --> 01:07:27,580
You say Lions.
You should have said Lions.

1919
01:07:27,614 --> 01:07:30,150
- A Black person will
finally watch "Yellowstone".

1920
01:07:30,183 --> 01:07:32,752
[laughing]

1921
01:07:32,786 --> 01:07:34,454
- I been watching that
show for a very long time.

1922
01:07:34,487 --> 01:07:38,058
[laughing]

1923
01:07:38,091 --> 01:07:40,226
Very good show.
- It's okay, Kev.

1924
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,062
- It's a good show.

1925
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:43,530
I'm really into it, too.

1926
01:07:43,563 --> 01:07:44,931
Uh, I'm out.
You got any more?

1927
01:07:44,964 --> 01:07:46,066
- Okay, what about this one?

1928
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:49,035
Elon Musk will
announce the new Tesla

1929
01:07:49,069 --> 01:07:52,305
that can suck your dick.
- Oh, wait a minute!

1930
01:07:52,339 --> 01:07:57,043
[laughter]

1931
01:07:57,077 --> 01:08:00,347
I mean, technically...

1932
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:02,048
I mean, what's wrong
with that if that happens?

1933
01:08:02,082 --> 01:08:05,552
[laughing]

1934
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:07,220
Like, I ain't in the wrong,
the car doin' it.

1935
01:08:07,253 --> 01:08:08,254
I ain't doin' it!

1936
01:08:08,288 --> 01:08:10,457
[laughing]

1937
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:13,893
Don't be mad a me,
be mad at Tesla. Right?

1938
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:17,097
Why you keep driving back
and forth to the store?

1939
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:20,066
- Ask Tesla.

1940
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,369
[laughter]

1941
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:26,139
And that was
Storylines of 2022.

1942
01:08:26,172 --> 01:08:28,074
- Oh, shit. I thought--
that's what I wanted to do.

1943
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:33,046
- We all been through a lot
this past year and half.

1944
01:08:33,046 --> 01:08:35,348
But one of the brightest spots
of this strange time

1945
01:08:35,382 --> 01:08:36,950
has been our friend, D-Nice.

1946
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,686
His Club Quarantine
kept us positive while apart

1947
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:41,821
during the pandemic.

1948
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:44,624
- We got 100,000
people in here

1949
01:08:44,658 --> 01:08:46,226
rocking with us
right now.

1950
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:48,061
This is absolutely insane!

1951
01:08:48,094 --> 01:08:51,998
- Say hello to
the one and only D-Nice!

1952
01:08:52,032 --> 01:08:53,333
- What's up, Snoop?
What's up, Kev?

1953
01:08:53,366 --> 01:08:55,101
- What it do? What up?
- What's goin' on
with ya, champ?

1954
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:56,870
- Aw, man, I'm so happy
to be here with you guys.

1955
01:08:56,903 --> 01:08:59,739
- It's an honor and a treat.
It's a treat when players meet.

1956
01:08:59,773 --> 01:09:01,141
- Well, let's get
right to it.

1957
01:09:01,174 --> 01:09:02,842
Was the highlight
of 2021 getting out

1958
01:09:02,876 --> 01:09:04,277
of the Club Quarantine
and performing live

1959
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:05,512
in front of people?

1960
01:09:05,545 --> 01:09:08,081
- Man, my highlight was
playing the Hollywood Bowl.

1961
01:09:08,114 --> 01:09:09,049
You know?

1962
01:09:09,082 --> 01:09:11,117
I sold out the Hollywood
Bowl in two days.

1963
01:09:11,151 --> 01:09:12,252
It was awesome.

1964
01:09:12,285 --> 01:09:13,887
- Where did the idea for
Club Quarantine come from?

1965
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,922
Like how did you--
how did you come about?

1966
01:09:16,022 --> 01:09:17,357
- I was having a cigar
with one of my buddies

1967
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:18,725
who used to play in the NBA,
Jimmy Jackson.

1968
01:09:18,758 --> 01:09:20,760
And we were just
trying to figure out

1969
01:09:20,794 --> 01:09:23,863
what we were going to do
for like the two weeks

1970
01:09:23,897 --> 01:09:25,398
that they said we were
going to be quarantined.

1971
01:09:25,432 --> 01:09:27,434
And he talked about working
on his commentating skills,

1972
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:29,402
and I was like, hey,
they got this feature

1973
01:09:29,436 --> 01:09:31,871
on Instagram called Live.

1974
01:09:31,905 --> 01:09:33,273
They weren't really using
it that much at the time.

1975
01:09:33,306 --> 01:09:35,408
I was like, yeah,
I just think I'll go on there

1976
01:09:35,442 --> 01:09:38,678
and just play some songs
and share stories.

1977
01:09:38,712 --> 01:09:40,180
And then it took off.

1978
01:09:40,213 --> 01:09:41,181
- Huge.

1979
01:09:41,214 --> 01:09:43,817
And you DJ'd Obama's
60th birthday party.

1980
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,618
You gotta give me
the details man.

1981
01:09:45,652 --> 01:09:46,820
- Yes.
- What was it like?

1982
01:09:46,853 --> 01:09:48,888
- His birthday
party was just fun.

1983
01:09:48,922 --> 01:09:51,624
And his thing is,
if we make the kids dance,

1984
01:09:51,658 --> 01:09:53,259
then we'll have
a good party.

1985
01:09:53,293 --> 01:09:56,329
So, Barack is never really about
playing just Stevie Wonder.

1986
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:58,298
Like he wants
the [indistinct], you know?

1987
01:09:58,331 --> 01:09:59,599
He wants all of that.
You know?

1988
01:09:59,632 --> 01:10:01,668
He wants his kids to be able
to have a good time, as well.

1989
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:03,370
- Super dope.
- So, D-Nice, you are--

1990
01:10:03,403 --> 01:10:06,072
you also DJ'd Snoop Dogg's
50th birthday party.

1991
01:10:06,106 --> 01:10:08,041
How was that?
- I did.

1992
01:10:08,074 --> 01:10:10,710
I had a blast
at your party, bro.

1993
01:10:10,744 --> 01:10:13,246
One, you looked amazing,
and your wife looked beautiful.

1994
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:15,115
And there was nothing
but love in there.

1995
01:10:15,148 --> 01:10:16,816
- Hey, man, thank you
for doing that for me

1996
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,885
on Grandma's birthday,
on Grandma's day.

1997
01:10:18,918 --> 01:10:19,819
You know what I'm
talking about?

1998
01:10:19,853 --> 01:10:21,354
- Yes, sir.
- I'm not a shit starter,

1999
01:10:21,388 --> 01:10:22,889
I'm all about
positivity and peace,

2000
01:10:22,922 --> 01:10:26,292
but you did-- you did Snoop
and Barack Obama's party.

2001
01:10:26,326 --> 01:10:29,362
Um, whose was better?
Whose party was better?

2002
01:10:32,666 --> 01:10:34,701
- Damn! That's a tough one.
Snoop's party was better.

2003
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:36,202
- That's politically correct.

2004
01:10:38,938 --> 01:10:40,640
- Let me get
Barack on, please?

2005
01:10:40,674 --> 01:10:42,642
[chuckling]

2006
01:10:42,676 --> 01:10:45,578
If I can. Just let me get
Barack on the line, please.

2007
01:10:45,612 --> 01:10:48,782
Yeah, DJ-- DJ Nice said
your party was ass.

2008
01:10:48,815 --> 01:10:51,151
Well, listen, D-Nice,
we can't talk about what you do

2009
01:10:51,184 --> 01:10:55,689
and not allow you to-to put
what you do on display, man.

2010
01:10:55,722 --> 01:10:57,257
That is our show.
And listen,

2011
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,725
we're going to wrap
things up here.

2012
01:10:58,758 --> 01:11:01,061
It's been real, honestly,
way too real, Snoop.

2013
01:11:01,094 --> 01:11:02,762
- Come on, man. It don't get
no realer than this.

2014
01:11:02,796 --> 01:11:04,698
And you ain't
gotta go home 2021,

2015
01:11:04,731 --> 01:11:07,367
but you gotta get
your ass up outta here!

2016
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,469
- D-Nice, listen,
we love your positivity.

2017
01:11:09,502 --> 01:11:12,172
Will you play us off as we
head into the better new year?

2018
01:11:12,205 --> 01:11:13,340
- Please do.
- Let's do it.

2019
01:11:13,373 --> 01:11:15,275
- That's what I'm
talking about.

2020
01:11:15,308 --> 01:11:16,943
- Okay.
- Get the hell outta here, 2021.

2021
01:11:16,976 --> 01:11:19,979
Oh, that's your track, Snoop.

2022
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,082
- You better know it.
- This your track.

2023
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:23,783
You know what, man?
We gotta--

2024
01:11:23,817 --> 01:11:25,919
you better be lucky
I ain't put on my Chux.

2025
01:11:25,952 --> 01:11:27,454
If I didn't have
on these little pants,

2026
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,222
I woulda
showed you something.

2027
01:11:29,255 --> 01:11:31,825
I don't have a lot of wiggle
room in these, Snoop.
