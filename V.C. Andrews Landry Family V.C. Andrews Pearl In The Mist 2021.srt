3
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,641
Beau!

4
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:35,035
You know I have to leave
in a minute.

5
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:37,733
Fifteen seconds is all I need.

6
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,393
God, am I going
to miss you.

7
00:00:45,523 --> 00:00:48,657
It's killing me.

8
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:50,876
So don't go, Ruby.

9
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:53,488
Stay here with me.

10
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:00,060
Ruby!

11
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,584
Uh, I'll be down in a second,
Daddy.

12
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:04,020
You go out
the back.

13
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:05,326
Ten seconds?

14
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,592
What, am I supposed
to roll myself

15
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:12,681
down the front steps?

16
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:17,077
Gisselle, my love.

17
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:18,904
Try to keep an open mind,
my darling.

18
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:20,993
I'm sure you'll grow
to love it there.

19
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:22,473
I'm sure I won't.

20
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:24,562
And you'll have Ruby
to help you along.

21
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:28,044
Did you say that to make
me feel better?

22
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:35,921
There she is.

23
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,800
So, Gisselle's already
in the car.

24
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:45,844
Mm-hm.

25
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:46,932
Are you nervous?

26
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:48,108
I'm excited.

27
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:49,370
Going to a school like Greenwood

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,241
was something I never even
dared dream about

29
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:52,851
when I lived in the Bayou.

30
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:54,375
If you weren't going
to the greatest school

31
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:55,550
in Louisiana,

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,422
I wouldn't let you leave here.

33
00:01:58,553 --> 00:01:59,554
Shall we?

34
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:01,469
We shall.

35
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:06,038
Goodbye, sweetheart.

36
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,997
Chin up.

37
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:13,002
Don't get too used to me
being gone, Mother.

38
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,617
Goodbye, Daphne.

39
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:21,750
Good luck, Ruby.

40
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:43,772
You went to a voodoo queen
to put me in a wheelchair.

41
00:02:43,902 --> 00:02:45,774
You couldn't pay her a visit
to get us out of this?

42
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:48,864
Will you ever forgive me
for that?

43
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:49,952
Yeah.

44
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:53,695
When I can walk again,
so... never.

45
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:02,269
Thank god, they're gone.

46
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:16,674
What do you think?

47
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:17,936
I think if boredom
is a major,

48
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,200
I'm gonna get straight As.

49
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,429
What are we, in the army?

50
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,823
It looks completely comfortable,
Gisselle.

51
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:36,128
Yeah, maybe to you.

52
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,174
You grew up sleeping
in the mud.

53
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:39,958
Welcome ladies.

54
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:42,309
I'm Mrs. Penny.
I'm your dorm mother.

55
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,354
You must be the Dumas sisters.

56
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:45,921
What gave it away?

57
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:48,271
You can pick any room you like
since you're the first here.

58
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:49,490
I'm not rooming with her.

59
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,405
I'll bunk with literally
anyone else.

60
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:52,536
Excuse me.

61
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:53,711
What's your name, girl?

62
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:55,191
Uh, Samantha.

63
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:56,932
You and me are going
to be roomies.

64
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:58,063
Can you grab my bags
for me?

65
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:01,023
I'm handicapped.

66
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:04,809
Good afternoon, girls.

67
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,115
I'm Mrs. Penny.

68
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,899
You'll want to hurry
and get yourselves settled.

69
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,075
We have an assembly at 1:00.

70
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:12,077
Your uniforms will be
here shortly.

71
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,079
Uniforms?!

72
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,779
I would like to welcome
all of you to Greenwood.

73
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:23,175
You are joining a small elite
group of scholars and athletes,

74
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:26,396
and we expect you
to make us proud.

75
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:29,747
At Greenwood, unerring
respect for your teachers

76
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:32,924
and staff is expected
without fail.

77
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:34,752
We do not have time for,

78
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:37,581
nor will we tolerate
insubordination

79
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:40,497
inside or outside class.

80
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:43,848
In addition, the possession
of any alcoholic beverage

81
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,111
or any drug on campus

82
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:49,724
will result in your
immediate expulsion.

83
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:55,469
Loud music, smoking,
or any act of vandalism,

84
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:59,516
carries severe punishments
and a high number of demerits.

85
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:02,389
In other words, no fun
at all in this dump.

86
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:08,482
I will have quiet
when I'm speaking.

87
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:15,663
However, your school experience
is not all books and homework.

88
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:21,146
We have a wide variety of campus
activities for you all to enjoy,

89
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:26,064
and we have several supervised
social events

90
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:28,328
with the Willowdale School
for Boys.

91
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,678
Sounds like a real orgy.

92
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:32,201
Can't wait.

93
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,637
Shh!

94
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,639
It is incumbent upon each one
of you to remember

95
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,990
that you are all Greenwood
girls now,

96
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:44,474
and Greenwood girls are
the elite of the elite.

97
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,783
All you have to do is just let
a boy think

98
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:52,264
he's got a sliver of a chance,
and he's basically your slave.

99
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:53,788
Even if you just let them
go to second,

100
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,485
you'll never get rid of them.

101
00:05:57,661 --> 00:06:00,795
Which, um, which one is second?

102
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:02,579
Goodnight.

103
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,539
What, am I trapped in here
with a pack of virgins?

104
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,193
Hi, I'm Abby.

105
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:10,631
I'm not really sure where
I'm supposed to go.

106
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,197
Hi.

107
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:14,939
I'm Ruby, and the only bed
left is in with me,

108
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,333
so I guess we're roomies.

109
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:18,639
Here, let me help you.

110
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:21,250
Wow, you really got great colour
this summer.

111
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,470
I never even got
to the beach once.

112
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:26,908
I guess I tan easily.

113
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:27,822
Lucky.

114
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:28,866
I burn easily.

115
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:31,391
Redhead, you know.
Come on.

116
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:40,704
It's my first year here too.

117
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:43,446
Why'd you pick Greenwood
for your senior year?

118
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:47,015
Well, my parents didn't like the
school I was supposed to go to.

119
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:48,625
Oh, yeah?

120
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:50,148
What was the matter with it?

121
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,761
Oh, there was just
a whole "thing."

122
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:56,024
Who's Prince Charming?

123
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:57,895
My boyfriend Beau.

124
00:06:58,026 --> 00:06:59,375
Talk about a dreamboat.

125
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:04,206
He was my dreamboat
before Ruby stole him from me.

126
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,382
Nice sister, huh?

127
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:08,428
It wasn't like that.

128
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:13,781
I'll tell you later.

129
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:17,915
When a non-artist looks
at our subject here,

130
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:20,396
all they see is an old boot.

131
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:22,920
It is an old boot,
but you need to do more

132
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:25,183
than just render
what's in front of you.

133
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:27,011
You've got to breathe life
into it.

134
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:28,491
It's got a story to tell,

135
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:31,233
and that's what's got to come
through in your drawings.

136
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,106
Really great work here, Ruby.

137
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,804
Although I'm not surprised.

138
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:39,241
You know your father made a
point of being in touch with me.

139
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,548
He said that your work hangs
in a New Orleans gallery.

140
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:44,725
Oh, I didn't know
he spoke with you.

141
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,857
I wasn't sure if he was
just a proud poppa

142
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:49,599
or if we had a real prodigy
on our hands.

143
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,905
It looks like the latter.

144
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:52,994
Thanks.

145
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,475
Excuse me, Miss Stevens.

146
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:58,129
Mrs. Ironwood sent me
for Ruby Dumas.

147
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,790
I want you to know, Ruby,
that I have been made...

148
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,489
familiar with your history.

149
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:14,145
I'm sorry, my history?

150
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:15,625
Your mother Daphne and I

151
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:18,236
had a very long telephone
conversation.

152
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:21,501
You spent most of your life
in the Bayou

153
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:24,504
with the Cajun people,
I'm told.

154
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:27,332
Daphne does like to say things
about me, doesn't she?

155
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:31,728
You are suggesting
she spoke falsely?

156
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:34,296
I grew up on the Bayou, yes.

157
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:35,732
I want you to know
from the outset

158
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:37,865
that I will be watching
you more closely

159
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:39,997
than I will the other students.

160
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,654
You find that funny?

161
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:47,222
I find it curious.

162
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:48,528
I suppose I'd like to know

163
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:50,921
what I've done to deserve
this extra scrutiny.

164
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:54,838
Whether you deserve it
is my decision.

165
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:57,537
I've had many dealings
with swamp people,

166
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:01,453
and I never met one
that I could trust.

167
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:05,588
I know your kind,
your type.

168
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:09,070
Your bad behaviour
is insidious.

169
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,812
You learn quickly who
is the most vulnerable,

170
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:15,990
who has certain
weaknesses, and
you play to
those weaknesses.

171
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,080
But I do believe people
can change their behaviour,

172
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,648
if not their nature.

173
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:25,913
So it is your behaviour
I will be judging.

174
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:31,353
You are dismissed.

175
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:41,668
Ruby.

176
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:44,322
What's the matter?

177
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:47,325
Careful Abby.

178
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:50,720
You're in the presence
of a swamp creature.

179
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,461
I wouldn't have guessed.

180
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,767
Oh, yes.

181
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:56,683
I am a Cajun
from the Bayou.

182
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,772
Come on.

183
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:01,035
Walk with me.

184
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:04,908
What happened?

185
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,955
I thought when I came here,

186
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:11,611
people would stop looking at me
like an outsider.

187
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:13,700
But it's the same thing
wherever I go.

188
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,094
It's... it's like I'm branded.

189
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:19,227
I know that feeling.

190
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:23,623
The reason I enrolled here
instead of the other school

191
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:26,626
is because they found out
something about me.

192
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:32,370
I'm what some people call
half-breed.

193
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:34,285
I'm part negro.

194
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,853
It is 1962, for god's sakes.

195
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:39,203
Why do people still care
about nonsense like that?

196
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:41,292
Well, they do.

197
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:44,469
Anyway, my parents sent me here,
hoping that having me immersed

198
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,995
with the creme de la creme,
it would rub off?

199
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,389
No one would suspect that
a Greenwood girl was impure.

200
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,393
And Greenwood shall wash us
both clean.

201
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:56,873
God, have mercy.

202
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,399
What are you two doing
down here?

203
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,140
You know you can't be here
after dark.

204
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:04,664
So go on and get back up
to the school.

205
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:06,404
You're the groundskeeper
or something.

206
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:07,579
Yeah.

207
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,233
I'm a lot of things
around here.

208
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:10,191
What's your name?

209
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:11,932
Buck.

210
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:14,195
But it'll be "Mud" if I get seen
with a student after dark.

211
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:23,683
Get a look at those muscles?

212
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,515
Mrs. Penny: Mrs. Clairborne's
family started the school,

213
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:32,300
and she's still
the largest donor.

214
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,694
You told us this twice
back at the dorms, Mrs. Penny.

215
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:37,131
And I may tell you once more,
dear.

216
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:40,830
It's very important you're all
on your best behavior.

217
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:43,572
We are lucky to be invited
to her home for tea.

218
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:46,880
Hi.

219
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:19,651
Good afternoon, ladies.

220
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:22,089
I'm so pleased to make
your acquaintance.

221
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:23,568
Oh, Mrs. Clairborne.

222
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,701
Thank you, as always,
for inviting us

223
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,572
into your marvellous home.

224
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:28,748
Oh, it's my pleasure.

225
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:30,924
Please everyone, sit.

226
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,667
I like to make a point of
meeting all the new students.

227
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,366
Your home is just lovely,
Mrs. Clairborne.

228
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:39,889
Thank you.

229
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:43,110
Abigail, is it?

230
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:48,768
Well...

231
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:51,248
Let's get to know each other,
shall we?

232
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,860
I should probably start
with the Dumas twins,

233
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,950
so I know one from the other.

234
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,909
I'm the crippled one, hmm.

235
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,434
Ah. I hope only physically.

236
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,962
You must be Ruby then, yes?

237
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,224
Yes ma'am.

238
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:12,008
I understand you're the artist
of the two.

239
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,270
Yes.

240
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:14,663
I paint and draw.

241
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,405
Then you must be familiar
with Renoir and Van Gogh.

242
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:19,233
Of course.

243
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:21,278
Two of my absolute favourites.

244
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:24,455
I have one of each hanging
in my foyer.

245
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:25,805
You don't mean originals?

246
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:28,851
My dear, I only
have originals.

247
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,114
Please, go have a look
if you like.

248
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:32,899
Thank you.

249
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:38,965
Who's there?

250
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:41,228
Oh, I'm sorry.

251
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:45,797
I didn't mean to disturb you.
I just heard you playing.

252
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:48,235
And who are you?

253
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:50,193
My name is Ruby Dumas.

254
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:52,065
I'm a student at Greenwood.

255
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:54,763
Do you play?

256
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,983
No.

257
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:59,028
I paint.

258
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,030
Well, ladies don't paint.

259
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:02,989
You'll learn that
from my Aunt Martha,

260
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:07,036
or as you know her,
Mrs. Ironwood.

261
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,429
We've met.

262
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,734
Yeah.

263
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:11,301
If you even have an ounce
of independent spirit,

264
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:13,347
she'll take care to knock it
right out of you.

265
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:15,436
I guess we'll see about that.

266
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,874
You're from the Bayou.

267
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,571
How can you tell?

268
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:21,964
You have a little bit
of an accent,

269
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:23,705
even though you try
to cover it.

270
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,751
My ears miss nothing.

271
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:29,711
They make up for my eyes,
which obviously see nothing.

272
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:31,017
I'm very sorry.

273
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:32,235
Yeah.

274
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:34,585
You know, I get that a lot.

275
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:37,066
You should probably run back
to Grandmother's tea

276
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,850
before she thinks
you're sneaking off

277
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:42,376
stealing ashtrays
or something.

278
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:45,292
It was nice to meet you, Mr...

279
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:46,423
Louis.

280
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:47,947
Louis Clairborne.

281
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:57,957
You as well, Ruby Dumas.

282
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:16,976
That was so boring I wanted
to wheel myself out a window.

283
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,195
I thought it was
very interesting.

284
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:21,241
That's because you were gone
half the time.

285
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:23,330
You didn't have to listen
to that lady go on

286
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,810
about her days as
a Greenwood girl.

287
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,422
I think it was nice how much
she misses her school days.

288
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:30,946
Actually, I ended up meeting
her grandson,

289
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:32,165
Louis Clairborne.

290
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:33,688
You what?!

291
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:36,996
He's blind, but you should
hear him play the piano.

292
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:39,085
Ruby, you had no right
to wander off

293
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:40,956
in Mrs. Clairborne's
house like that.

294
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,131
I wasn't.

295
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:43,959
I just peeked in to see
who was playing.

296
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,482
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

297
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:47,093
Mrs. Clairborne hasn't
allowed people

298
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,269
in that side of the house
since the tragedy.

299
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,487
What tragedy?

300
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:54,100
Her... daughter
and son-in-law died.

301
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,362
That's all I'll say about it.

302
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:56,493
Were they murdered
or something?

303
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:57,929
I am not discussing it.

304
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,975
Well, there you have it.
They were murdered.

305
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,150
I'm psychic.

306
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,325
Gisselle, that's enough.

307
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:04,153
Ruby, I'm very disappointed
in you.

308
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:06,112
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

309
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:07,852
What happened is the
Clairborne's business,

310
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:10,420
and not for us
to gossip about.

311
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:13,945
That poor boy Louis was left an
orphan and blind from his grief.

312
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:16,992
Isn't that gossip,
Mrs. Penny?

313
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,019
How does someone go blind
from grief?

314
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,934
Maybe it's psychological?

315
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,197
I guess.

316
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:51,766
So was he good looking?

317
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:52,854
Very.

318
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:56,466
Good looking and mysteriously
blind.

319
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:59,165
I'm dying to know
what happened up there.

320
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,731
Well you won't get it
out of Mrs. Penny.

321
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,342
The keeper of the
Clairborne secrets.

322
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:06,215
I can do without knowing theirs

323
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:09,349
as long as they don't
find out mine.

324
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:10,524
Oh?

325
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:13,527
And what is your secret, Abby?

326
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:14,745
Don't you have something
better to do

327
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:16,225
than eavesdrop, Gisselle?

328
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:17,444
I wasn't.

329
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:18,706
I was just coming in
to tell you

330
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:22,449
I got the dirt on this
Clairborne tragedy.

331
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:24,277
You going to tell us,
or what?

332
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:26,714
Well, I'll tell you my secret
when Abby tells hers.

333
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:28,933
Fine. Never mind.

334
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:30,718
You might as well
tell me, Abby.

335
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:33,460
If you don't, I'll just
make something up.

336
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:41,207
Okay. I'll tell you.

337
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:42,947
Abby.

338
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:46,429
You tell her, you're
telling everybody.

339
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,475
Don't say a word.

340
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:58,441
The reason I transferred
to this school

341
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:01,140
is because I got kicked
out of my last one.

342
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,490
I got caught with a boy.

343
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,752
Nude, right?

344
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:06,449
It didn't go that far.

345
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,451
But he was in my room
and I got caught.

346
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:09,583
You happy?

347
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:11,106
Thrilled.

348
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:14,153
All right. Gisselle.
So now you know.

349
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:16,285
What did you learn
about Louis?

350
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:20,637
Maybe I'll tell you...

351
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:24,250
when Abby learns to be
a better liar.

352
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,874
That's nice.

353
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:43,617
One thing I've learned to do is,
um, cheat a little bit.

354
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:46,881
See here on my tree how I've
added those subtle highlights

355
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:48,752
to sort of capture the sun
a little bit better?

356
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,145
Yeah.

357
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,321
I didn't get that on mine.

358
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:54,541
I will commence cheating.

359
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,380
We're studying landscapes
today, Ruby.

360
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,033
Not the human form.

361
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,254
This is Saturday.

362
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:14,691
I'm allowed to daydream
when I'm not in class.

363
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:16,127
I thought you had a fella
back home.

364
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,521
Who I'm totally faithful to.

365
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:21,785
Besides, Buck's way too old
for me.

366
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,526
But not for you.

367
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:26,399
He is not my type.

368
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,531
That's not your type?

369
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,316
My god, what is?

370
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:33,928
Not that.

371
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:35,582
Okay.

372
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:39,194
Well, I know a beautiful blind
pianist I can introduce you to.

373
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:40,500
You met Louis Clairborne?

374
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,588
Mm-hmm.

375
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,549
What a sordid bit of business
all that was.

376
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,986
Hold on now, you know
what happened?

377
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:51,598
Of course.
Everybody does.

378
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:54,731
Gossip is the faculty sport.

379
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:58,257
I'm waiting.

380
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:00,737
Okay.

381
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,740
Louis Clairborne's mother
was having an affair

382
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,438
with a younger man.

383
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,527
A much younger man.

384
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,964
He was her dirty little
secret.

385
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:12,793
She would sneak him into
the house while he was at
work.

386
00:21:12,923 --> 00:21:16,144
But it didn't remain a secret
from Louis' father for long.

387
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,102
Get out!

388
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:20,148
You cheating whore!

389
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:22,324
You no good tramp!

390
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:24,457
No! No!

391
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:27,155
After a while, he convinced
her
all was forgiven.

392
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,897
But that was far
from the case.

393
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:33,292
He wanted her out of his life,
for good.

394
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:45,260
Neither one of them was going
to be leaving that bedroom alive

395
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:48,002
early that morning.

396
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:49,830
I love you.

397
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,269
Of course he knew he was also
sealing his own fate.

398
00:21:57,098 --> 00:22:00,536
What he never knew
was there was a witness.

399
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:03,626
Louis went into a coma
from the shock,

400
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:05,889
and he didn't come out of it
until weeks later.

401
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,677
And when he did, he was
completely blind.

402
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:12,940
Oh, Miss Stevens.
That's horrible.

403
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,202
You wanted to know.

404
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,986
Now I kind of wish I didn't.

405
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:17,988
Did you get a look at the clocks
up at the house?

406
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,121
Yes, I did.

407
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,384
They're all set to 5:02.

408
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:24,647
The time of the killings.

409
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:34,396
Ruby!

410
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,006
I've got exciting news.

411
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:39,880
You, my dear, have been invited
back to the Clairborne Mansion

412
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,272
for dinner tonight!

413
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,709
That's big news?

414
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:45,015
Why and how are
they inviting her?

415
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:47,496
I'm the interesting one.

416
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:50,543
Ruby, my goodness,
hurry and get yourself ready!

417
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:19,006
You do like to snoop,
don't you?

418
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:23,271
Oh. I'm... I'm sorry.
I was just curious.

419
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,186
Well please, in the future
look with your eyes

420
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:26,405
and not your hands.

421
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:29,277
Oh, the irony.

422
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:33,237
Good to see you again, Louis.

423
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:36,240
And thank you so much for
the invitation Mrs. Clairborne.

424
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:38,852
Actually, the invitation
was mine, Ruby.

425
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:40,897
You see I'm afraid I was rather
rude to you the other day,

426
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:41,942
and I'm sorry.

427
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:43,378
I would like to demonstrate
to you

428
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:46,425
that I'm not such a bad fellow
for a blind recluse.

429
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:50,124
I'm smiling, by the way.

430
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:52,605
Good.

431
00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:56,478
So Ruby, tell me
about the Bayou.

432
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:57,958
Thank you.

433
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:02,223
I don't know.

434
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:05,748
I've just always found it
so peaceful there.

435
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:08,882
I actually visited the Bayou
when I was much younger.

436
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:11,275
I can still see it
in my mind,

437
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:15,541
it's very beautiful and
mysterious as I recall.

438
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:16,498
Louis?

439
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:17,934
Hmm?

440
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:22,069
Do they think there's any hope
that you might see again?

441
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:25,072
You mean, is the problem
in my eyes or in my brain?

442
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:27,901
I don't think this is suitable
dinner table discussion.

443
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:30,686
They call my condition
an emotional trauma.

444
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:34,342
In other words, my eyes
are completely healthy.

445
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:36,736
I'm sorry.

446
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:41,305
I only ask because my grandmère
was a healer in the Bayou.

447
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:45,962
She fixed people who everyone
else thought were beyond hope.

448
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:47,703
With respect dear,

449
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:53,448
I don't think witch doctor
con artists are the answer.

450
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:55,145
Also with respect, ma'am,

451
00:24:55,276 --> 00:25:00,063
my grandmère never conned
a penny out of anyone.

452
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:03,371
She never accepted payment
for her gifts.

453
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,373
Hmm.

454
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,027
And how much money
have we spent

455
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:10,421
on so-called "respectable
doctors," grandmother?

456
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:13,076
Ones who haven't restored my
eyesight by a single rod or cone

457
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:16,166
in all these years?

458
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:19,213
Yes, but who are the charlatans,
I wonder?

459
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:29,266
Transports the soul,
doesn't it?

460
00:25:32,008 --> 00:25:33,706
Okay.

461
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,552
That is so beautiful.

462
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:09,132
What's the matter?

463
00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:10,743
Sorry, sorry.

464
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:13,963
It's actually, uh, just you
leaning against me like that

465
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:15,443
for some reason, um...

466
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,531
Oh.

467
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,054
I didn't realize.

468
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:23,233
I was just so taken
with your playing.

469
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:25,496
This may sound a little
bit ridiculous,

470
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:29,457
but I've actually never been
alone with a young woman before.

471
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,721
Not all that scary, am I?

472
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:34,723
I wonder, Ruby.

473
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:39,249
Um, maybe you'd allow me
to touch your face.

474
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,905
You... you could absolutely
say no.

475
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:45,821
Uh, sure you can.

476
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:48,302
As long as you don't poke me
in the eye.

477
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:49,433
Okay.

478
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:17,287
You look so nervous.
Don't be.

479
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:31,258
So.

480
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:32,607
What do you think?

481
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:34,740
Marilyn Monroe?

482
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,176
I wouldn't know.

483
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:38,831
-Oh, of course not.
-Yeah.

484
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:40,876
What am I thinking?

485
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,664
I mean, of course I've never
even kissed a girl, so.

486
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:48,667
You ever heard anything
so pathetic?

487
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:52,105
Sorry, I shouldn't have
brought that up.

488
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,976
Louis, it's okay.

489
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:57,023
I mean, that's an easy thing
to fix.

490
00:27:58,198 --> 00:28:00,504
Really?

491
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:03,769
You would kiss me?

492
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:05,596
Sure.

493
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:08,208
I mean, it's really not
such a big deal.

494
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:11,211
And, and if I can
help you...

495
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,213
Okay.

496
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:19,698
Three, two, one.

497
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:24,267
I'm sorry, what's funny?

498
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:25,747
Nothing.

499
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:28,010
It's just that you need
to relax a little more.

500
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:29,882
Don't be so stiff.

501
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:31,274
I shouldn't have
invited you here.

502
00:28:31,405 --> 00:28:34,060
Louis, I'm not laughing
at you, really.

503
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,366
We can try it again, okay?

504
00:28:43,678 --> 00:28:44,853
She returns.

505
00:28:44,984 --> 00:28:48,204
How was the big dinner?

506
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:51,512
How familiar are you with
the works of Franz Kafka?

507
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:53,601
That bizarre, huh?

508
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:02,175
There's a lot more to tell.

509
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,438
But not here.

510
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:24,632
"Dear girls.

511
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,766
"You can't know how much
your mother and I miss you,

512
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:30,246
"and how much we're looking
forward to Christmas

513
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:33,162
"when we'll all be
together again.

514
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:35,643
"I hope you haven't been
too homesick,

515
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,820
"and that you're making lots
of friends at Greenwood."

516
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:40,213
Ruby!

517
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,660
Beau!

518
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:55,358
Gisselle.

519
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:56,882
Good to see you.

520
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:58,797
No kiss hello?

521
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:03,453
Is that the best you can do?

522
00:30:05,281 --> 00:30:08,458
So, did Ruby tell you about
her big date the other night?

523
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:10,286
It was scandalous.

524
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:12,985
I had dinner with some big
school donors.

525
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:14,900
A blind man and
his grandmother.

526
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,163
A good looking,
suave blind man.

527
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:19,774
And she looked awfully guilty
when she got back.

528
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:20,993
She's right, Beau.

529
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:22,472
I don't know how
to tell you this,

530
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:25,432
but I let the blind man touch
my whole face.

531
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:26,781
We're through, Ruby!

532
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:28,304
Oh!

533
00:30:28,435 --> 00:30:29,392
Nice try, Gisselle.

534
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:31,177
There's a big school dance
coming up too.

535
00:30:31,307 --> 00:30:33,657
There's a whole school
full of boys going to be there.

536
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:36,704
Well, they can touch your face,
but no dancing.

537
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:40,316
You guys are gross together.

538
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:42,536
Let's go Samantha, god.

539
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:52,720
Oh god, Beau. I've missed
you so much.

540
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,374
Me too.

541
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,642
Oh, I've missed your touch.

542
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:09,084
What's the matter?

543
00:31:09,215 --> 00:31:11,173
Nothing.

544
00:31:11,304 --> 00:31:13,915
I'm just getting a little
overheated,

545
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:16,570
and I kind of already know
where this is going.

546
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,268
Or rather, where
this isn't going.

547
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:21,880
Maybe we should
just head back.

548
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:53,259
I think we've waited
long enough, don't you?

549
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:13,932
Abby!

550
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:18,240
We want you to know
we all took a vote,

551
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:19,502
and we've decided that

552
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,417
you're the prettiest girl
in the school.

553
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:22,984
So we think you have
the best chance

554
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:25,508
of being voted queen
of the fall mixer.

555
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:27,946
Um, thank you?

556
00:32:28,076 --> 00:32:29,773
Queen of the mixer?

557
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:31,340
Is that something they do?

558
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:33,734
We're planning on making it
a tradition.

559
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:34,822
Samantha?

560
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:41,350
This represents
our school colours.

561
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:43,657
We'd hoped you'd wear it
to do us proud.

562
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:46,747
Thanks guys.

563
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,318
Well, it's not ticking.

564
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:54,276
It'll look pretty.
Come here.

565
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:57,932
Wow.

566
00:32:58,063 --> 00:33:00,630
You two look so gorgeous.

567
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:03,111
You clean up pretty well
yourself, Miss Stevens.

568
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:05,157
I hardly ever see you
without a smock on.

569
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:06,462
Well, I'm chaperoning,

570
00:33:06,593 --> 00:33:08,116
so I'll be the one to tap you
on the shoulder

571
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:09,335
if you're dancing too close.

572
00:33:09,465 --> 00:33:10,423
Oh.

573
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,295
You two be sure to give
all the other girls

574
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:15,210
a chance with the boys
tonight, huh?

575
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:26,178
All right, everyone.

576
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:32,140
We are happy to welcome
the boys of Willowdale Prep.

577
00:33:35,274 --> 00:33:39,495
Now, I want to remind you all
to behave appropriately.

578
00:33:39,626 --> 00:33:41,932
Perfect ladies and
perfect gentlemen.

579
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,064
Yes, ma'am.

580
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:45,023
Have fun!

581
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:50,463
Oh, would you look at that.

582
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:51,986
My grandmother's
favourite song.

583
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,383
Is he coming
over to me?

584
00:33:57,513 --> 00:33:59,820
Don't be nervous,
he's not that good looking.

585
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,478
Go.

586
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:34,159
Thank you.

587
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:37,162
I'm going to take a break
and go powder my nose.

588
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:46,432
Hi Buck.

589
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:47,650
Don't tell me
there's some rule

590
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:50,349
you can't talk to students
here too.

591
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:51,872
Why do you want to talk
to me?

592
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:53,613
All I said was hi.

593
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:55,441
I was brought up
to be polite.

594
00:34:55,571 --> 00:34:56,442
I'm sorry.

595
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:58,139
I'm not trying to be rude,

596
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,750
but you understand that this
is an all-girls school

597
00:35:00,881 --> 00:35:02,100
and the rules are pretty strict
around here?

598
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,971
Yeah, well between you and me,

599
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,627
I could do without one or two
of their rules.

600
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:09,455
I guess I could too.

601
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:11,805
Until next time, Buck.

602
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:37,265
What's going on?

603
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,006
I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

604
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,965
There's no way that none of the
boys want to dance with Abby.

605
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:44,925
They are avoiding her like
she's a nest of hornets.

606
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:46,796
Is that so?

607
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:48,624
What are you up to?

608
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:50,887
Why do you assume I have
anything to do with it?

609
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:54,630
Maybe the boys just get a sense
that Abby's a little... off,

610
00:35:54,761 --> 00:35:57,285
if you know what I mean.

611
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:04,118
Time to announce the queen.

612
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,128
Okay, everybody.

613
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,565
This is the big moment.

614
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:21,657
In this envelope I have the name
of the queen of the fall mixer.

615
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:26,184
Wow, everybody.

616
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:29,230
Looks like history's about
to be made tonight.

617
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:33,800
Our very first queen
is part negro.

618
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:39,022
Let's give a big hand
to Miss Abby Tyler.

619
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:55,561
Well Abby, aren't you going
to give us a speech?

620
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:03,395
I'd like to tell you

621
00:37:03,525 --> 00:37:09,401
what an honour it is to be
chosen your queen.

622
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:11,881
But clearly honour
is not a word

623
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:16,495
any of you are remotely
familiar with.

624
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:19,628
Spoken like a true half-breed.

625
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:21,239
Here we go!

626
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:23,632
I knew you wouldn't be able to
hide your true colours for long.

627
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:26,026
Putting a hand on you
is beneath me, Gisselle.

628
00:37:26,156 --> 00:37:27,375
Not me!

629
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:36,036
You dummies have already chosen
your queen.

630
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:40,736
She's right there,
crawling on the ground.

631
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:42,782
All hail...

632
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,439
You are on thin ice as it is,
Miss Dumas.

633
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:52,574
Do not damage yourself further
for the sake of a mixed blood

634
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:54,924
that does not belong here.

635
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:04,630
Help me!

636
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:16,424
Gisselle went too far
this time.

637
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:18,992
It isn't just Gisselle.

638
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:23,083
It's the entire institution,
Ruby.

639
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:32,222
You're really going to leave me
here all by myself?

640
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:36,488
You know they're going
to kick me out anyway.

641
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:40,318
This way at least I get to do it
on my own terms.

642
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:45,845
I'll always be your friend,
Abby.

643
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,286
I'll always be yours, Ruby.

644
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:31,369
I think maybe you've forgotten
what's important

645
00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:33,588
about being a Greenwood girl,
Ruby.

646
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:35,764
I'll tell you what
isn't important.

647
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:36,635
Money.

648
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:37,505
Lineage.

649
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:38,419
Skin colour.

650
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,681
Blood.

651
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:43,293
All the things you idiots
put so much value on.

652
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:45,905
Just tell me how you found out
about Abby.

653
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:47,341
She should thank me.

654
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:49,038
I did her a favour.

655
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:52,564
I'd give anything to get kicked
out of this crappy school.

656
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:53,869
Besides, what makes you think

657
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,958
I'm speaking to you
after what you did to me?

658
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,264
Right.

659
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,700
All those chivalrous boys

660
00:39:58,831 --> 00:40:01,877
rushing to the aide of
poor helpless Gisselle.

661
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:03,531
You loved it.

662
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:05,664
They do all love me so,
don't they?

663
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:09,058
And if little Abby didn't
want me to read her letters,

664
00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:10,712
she shouldn't have left them
unattended in a box

665
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:12,061
behind her underwear

666
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:14,412
with a lock that was
ridiculously easy to open.

667
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:16,239
But I guess you know
all about lock and key,

668
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,067
since you're basically
a prisoner in this dorm

669
00:40:18,198 --> 00:40:19,634
for what you did to me.

670
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:21,462
Just kills me when
I think about it.

671
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:23,246
I'm sure it kills you
to think, period.

672
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:26,206
You take that back!

673
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:28,251
Ruby, I've just got a message.

674
00:40:28,382 --> 00:40:30,253
You've been invited back up
to the mansion.

675
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:33,256
Why the hell does she always
get to go up to that nice house?

676
00:40:33,387 --> 00:40:35,084
Ruby's on lockdown anyway.

677
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:36,434
Tell them she can't go.

678
00:40:36,564 --> 00:40:38,087
I'm afraid the Clairbornes

679
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:41,221
have the authority to override
Mrs. Ironwood's punishments.

680
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:43,092
Louis Clairborne sent for her.

681
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:45,443
What if I don't want to see
Louis, Mrs. Penny?

682
00:40:45,573 --> 00:40:47,314
I'm overriding the override.

683
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,272
Ruby.

684
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:51,405
It's just that Louis Clairborne

685
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:53,538
says he's regaining
his eyesight.

686
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:56,932
He says he thinks
it's because of you.

687
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:05,158
Hello, Louis.

688
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:06,507
Ruby.

689
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:07,552
You came.

690
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:09,075
I was so afraid you wouldn't.

691
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:11,643
I wasn't going to.

692
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:15,168
You know, you really have
to work on your moods, Louis.

693
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:17,387
Don't snap at me anymore, okay?

694
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:19,520
I um, I promise.

695
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:21,957
Okay? I'm very, very sorry.

696
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:26,092
Is it true?

697
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:28,964
Can you see?

698
00:41:29,095 --> 00:41:30,662
I can see shapes now.

699
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:34,579
It's not just blackness anymore.

700
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:37,407
That's fantastic.

701
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:40,149
You know, Ruby?

702
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,021
I really can't believe
that this is coincidence

703
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:45,677
that this is happening
so shortly after I met you.

704
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:46,939
Perhaps some of your
grandmother's abilities

705
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:49,028
rubbed off on you
a little bit.

706
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:55,121
That magnolia tree over there.

707
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:57,036
I can almost see it.

708
00:41:57,166 --> 00:42:00,822
You know, I used to climb that
thing every day as a little boy.

709
00:42:00,953 --> 00:42:01,997
I'd spend more time up there

710
00:42:02,128 --> 00:42:04,347
than I would in front
of the piano.

711
00:42:04,478 --> 00:42:06,698
My bedroom, just up there,

712
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:09,439
so the garden was always
just outside the window.

713
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,919
I could see the whole campus,

714
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,313
the lake and the stables
from up there too.

715
00:42:13,443 --> 00:42:15,315
I'd like to see that.

716
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:17,709
Can we go up there?

717
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,885
I don't know if that would be
exactly proper

718
00:42:20,015 --> 00:42:22,670
for me to bring a Greenwood
student up to my room alone.

719
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:23,976
Oh, come on.

720
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:25,543
I think you can learn a lot
about a person

721
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:27,719
from what their room
looks like.

722
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:34,943
Okay.

723
00:42:35,074 --> 00:42:38,643
Although, you might not want
to learn too much about me.

724
00:42:58,314 --> 00:43:00,055
The woman in the painting?

725
00:43:00,186 --> 00:43:01,970
It's my mother.

726
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:03,406
I don't keep pictures
of my father

727
00:43:03,537 --> 00:43:06,453
since he was the one
who smothered her to death.

728
00:43:08,194 --> 00:43:11,545
Can I ask you why he did it?

729
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:13,765
I'm sure you've heard
the rumours.

730
00:43:13,895 --> 00:43:16,724
Oh, I don't trust rumours.

731
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:19,727
I've been on the bad end
of too many of them.

732
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:21,990
And the truth always
gets distorted.

733
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:24,906
I don't think you want to know
the truth.

734
00:43:25,037 --> 00:43:26,604
Louis, are we friends?

735
00:43:26,734 --> 00:43:28,954
I would hope so, yes.

736
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:31,609
Well then, you should trust me.

737
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:35,482
I only want to help you
if I can, in some way.

738
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:43,011
My mother and I were always
very close.

739
00:43:43,142 --> 00:43:47,973
Some nights I'd lie here,
scared.

740
00:43:48,103 --> 00:43:50,497
She would hear me whimpering.

741
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:53,631
I remember hearing her come
into the room,

742
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:57,939
and I would reach out my hands,
and she would take it.

743
00:43:59,462 --> 00:44:01,290
Please.

744
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:04,163
I want you to know how it was
with us.

745
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:09,647
She would lie beside me
on her back.

746
00:44:13,912 --> 00:44:17,045
She would take my hand,

747
00:44:17,176 --> 00:44:18,743
and she would press it against
her chest

748
00:44:18,873 --> 00:44:21,354
so I could feel her heartbeat.

749
00:44:26,968 --> 00:44:33,932
Then she would take her
other hand and place it here.

750
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:37,892
I'm not asking you to do that.

751
00:44:38,023 --> 00:44:46,205
My hand would travel from
her heart to her breasts.

752
00:44:49,512 --> 00:44:52,994
Till one night my father
found us like this.

753
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:56,389
My god, he was furious.

754
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:58,826
He...

755
00:44:58,957 --> 00:45:00,349
And every time after that,

756
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,960
he thought I was crying
for my mother

757
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:04,614
when I would lie here, scared.

758
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,399
And then it was him
who would come see me.

759
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:08,836
He would lay his belt
to me.

760
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,624
It's okay, Louis.

761
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:20,195
After that, my mother found
another boy.

762
00:45:20,326 --> 00:45:22,241
He replaced me.

763
00:45:24,156 --> 00:45:27,420
My father snapped.

764
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,857
I stood across the hall
and I watched him murder her,

765
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:33,339
and I did nothing.

766
00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:34,035
Nothing.

767
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:35,820
Shhh...

768
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:38,736
I'm sorry, Ruby.

769
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:43,218
I'm sorry, I... I don't mean to
make things awkward between us.

770
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:46,091
It's okay.

771
00:45:46,221 --> 00:45:48,223
I understand now, Louis.

772
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:53,054
You can trust me.

773
00:45:54,186 --> 00:45:55,578
It's okay.

774
00:46:07,939 --> 00:46:09,723
Ruby?

775
00:46:09,854 --> 00:46:11,333
Mrs. Ironwood sent me
to get you.

776
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:13,205
She needs to see you
right away.

777
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:17,775
Because what else is new?

778
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:28,133
Let's just get to it, okay?

779
00:46:28,263 --> 00:46:30,135
What lies is she telling
you now?

780
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:39,492
Daddy had
a heart attack, Ruby.

781
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:42,800
He died.

782
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:54,942
I want you girls to know

783
00:46:55,073 --> 00:46:57,466
that things are going to be
different around here.

784
00:46:57,597 --> 00:46:59,860
I'm not going to end up
like your father, dying young,

785
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:03,603
worrying more about others
than myself.

786
00:47:03,733 --> 00:47:06,127
To begin with, I'm replacing
the house staff,

787
00:47:06,258 --> 00:47:07,563
and Nina is gone.

788
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:08,826
Now, you'll get
your inheritance,

789
00:47:08,956 --> 00:47:10,610
but not until
you're both 21.

790
00:47:12,264 --> 00:47:14,309
Your father's business partner,
Mr. Bristol here,

791
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,485
will be working with me
to make sure

792
00:47:16,616 --> 00:47:18,487
all your financial matters
are handled properly.

793
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:21,926
Everything will remain in
a trust until you're of age.

794
00:47:22,056 --> 00:47:24,537
Have you told Uncle Jean
about Daddy?

795
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:31,370
Your father's deranged brother
is... no longer my concern.

796
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,980
But Daphne, you have to tell-

797
00:47:33,111 --> 00:47:35,026
That is enough, young lady.

798
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:37,376
Furthermore, the days
of your indulgent father

799
00:47:37,506 --> 00:47:38,812
spoiling you are over.

800
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:40,205
Is that understood?

801
00:47:40,335 --> 00:47:41,293
Yes, ma'am.

802
00:47:41,423 --> 00:47:42,816
Mostly.

803
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:46,080
You bear the Dumas family name
now more than ever.

804
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:50,693
And I expect your behaviour
moving forward

805
00:47:50,824 --> 00:47:52,826
to be irreproachable.

806
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:25,554
Uncle Jean?

807
00:48:25,685 --> 00:48:28,079
It's me. It's Ruby.

808
00:48:30,385 --> 00:48:33,519
Do you remember me?

809
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:35,216
I have no idea why
you've been moved

810
00:48:35,347 --> 00:48:38,089
from your private room
to here, but...

811
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:42,920
I'm going to find out, okay?

812
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:50,449
Your brother Pierre has died.

813
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,804
Do you understand
what I just said?

814
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:04,550
My father, your brother,
is dead.

815
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:17,084
It was very sudden.

816
00:49:17,215 --> 00:49:19,130
Almost immediate, I'm told.

817
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,610
He couldn't have felt any pain.

818
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:40,847
Nooooo!

819
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:51,684
I'm so sorry.

820
00:49:59,257 --> 00:50:01,433
How could you be so cheap?!

821
00:50:01,563 --> 00:50:02,651
Excuse me?

822
00:50:02,782 --> 00:50:05,350
You put Uncle Jean
in a communal ward!

823
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,394
The man's a vegetable.

824
00:50:06,525 --> 00:50:07,874
He doesn't even know
where he is.

825
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,441
How would you even know?!

826
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:11,356
You never even go out
to see him!

827
00:50:11,486 --> 00:50:12,748
Are you quite done?

828
00:50:12,879 --> 00:50:14,794
He knows what's happening
to him!

829
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:17,666
You should see where
they put him!

830
00:50:17,797 --> 00:50:20,191
Don't you shout at me
in this house.

831
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:21,801
I'm the one who makes
the financial decisions

832
00:50:21,931 --> 00:50:22,976
from here on out.

833
00:50:23,107 --> 00:50:24,630
Do you understand me?

834
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,979
No, Daphne.

835
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,895
I do not understand you.

836
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,029
Uncle Jean is
in very bad shape.

837
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:33,856
He's only going
to get worse.

838
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:36,163
Well, I wasn't aware you earned
a degree in psychiatry.

839
00:50:36,294 --> 00:50:38,861
I don't need a degree.

840
00:50:38,992 --> 00:50:41,951
I have compassion
and human kindness.

841
00:50:42,082 --> 00:50:45,303
Not that those words mean
a thing to you.

842
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:52,179
You don't have your father
to run to anymore.

843
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,529
It's just me.

844
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:58,620
And talking to me that way
will only bring you regrets.

845
00:50:58,751 --> 00:51:00,579
As a punishment,

846
00:51:02,494 --> 00:51:06,150
you are not allowed to attend
your father's funeral.

847
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,673
What?

848
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:09,240
You can't do that!

849
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:12,765
Oh, you'll be surprised at
the breadth of things I can do.

850
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:39,879
How'd you get past
the dragon?

851
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:41,968
What did Daphne do?

852
00:51:43,926 --> 00:51:46,103
Beau, could you lock
the door please?

853
00:52:00,421 --> 00:52:04,991
I have to go back to Greenwood
the day after tomorrow,

854
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:10,997
and I just need something nice
to happen while I'm here.

855
00:52:55,824 --> 00:52:57,957
I'm beginning to think you
want us to get caught together.

856
00:52:58,087 --> 00:52:59,698
Oh, hi Buck.

857
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,310
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
it was getting dark.

858
00:53:05,007 --> 00:53:06,531
I'm just trying to be careful.
You understand that, right?

859
00:53:06,661 --> 00:53:07,793
Yes.

860
00:53:07,923 --> 00:53:10,578
Those pesky Greenwood rules
we can't change.

861
00:53:10,709 --> 00:53:12,058
I'll leave in a minute.

862
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,539
It's probably for the best.

863
00:53:14,669 --> 00:53:16,976
But I guess I'll see you later?

864
00:53:17,106 --> 00:53:19,674
Not if I see you first.

865
00:54:05,198 --> 00:54:07,983
Have I told you I started seeing
a psychiatrist?

866
00:54:08,114 --> 00:54:09,811
You mean you haven't been
all along?

867
00:54:11,857 --> 00:54:13,293
Well, of course, because
why would someone like me

868
00:54:13,424 --> 00:54:14,816
need a psychiatrist, right?

869
00:54:14,947 --> 00:54:17,079
I didn't mean it
to sound like that.

870
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,951
Yeah, well.

871
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:21,083
He seems to think that the
reason my vision is returning

872
00:54:21,214 --> 00:54:23,085
is because I finally have
someone who I can trust

873
00:54:23,216 --> 00:54:25,523
in my life.

874
00:54:25,653 --> 00:54:27,960
That's you, Ruby.

875
00:54:32,617 --> 00:54:34,227
Honestly, I can't tell you
how glad I am

876
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:37,099
that you came into my life.

877
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:41,713
Louis, there's something
you should know.

878
00:54:41,843 --> 00:54:44,237
I should've said
something before.

879
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:45,891
Oh, Ruby.

880
00:54:46,021 --> 00:54:48,285
I always assumed you had
a boyfriend.

881
00:54:48,415 --> 00:54:50,417
I mean, how could you not?

882
00:54:51,505 --> 00:54:54,203
Marilyn Monroe.

883
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:08,087
I've only been back for a couple
of days, Mrs. Penny.

884
00:55:08,217 --> 00:55:09,915
What crime am I supposed
to have committed this time?

885
00:55:10,045 --> 00:55:12,483
Don't pretend you don't know
what this is about, Ruby.

886
00:55:12,613 --> 00:55:14,963
I can't tell you how
disappointed I am in you.

887
00:55:15,094 --> 00:55:17,444
Okay. This should be good.

888
00:55:17,575 --> 00:55:19,751
Don't you dare be so flippant
about this.

889
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:22,623
Don't you know this is certain
to get you expelled?

890
00:55:32,546 --> 00:55:34,374
You sent for me?

891
00:55:34,505 --> 00:55:36,115
Again?

892
00:55:36,245 --> 00:55:38,639
Sit down.

893
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:47,822
As you may have guessed by now,
you have been found out, Ruby.

894
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:50,999
I figured something was up
when I was hauled out of class.

895
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:53,915
Don't make it worse for yourself
by talking smart to me.

896
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:56,657
Mrs. Ironwood, isn't
it customary to at least

897
00:55:56,788 --> 00:55:58,964
tell the accused what
the fuss is all about?

898
00:55:59,094 --> 00:56:02,141
You are not talking your way
out of this one.

899
00:56:03,882 --> 00:56:08,495
That, in your hand, is a signed
confession from the handyman,

900
00:56:08,626 --> 00:56:13,021
Buck Jenson, recounting
all the disgusting details

901
00:56:13,152 --> 00:56:15,372
of your tryst last night.

902
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:17,374
Multiple trysts,
I might add.

903
00:56:17,504 --> 00:56:20,377
Your expulsion hearing will be
this afternoon at 1:00.

904
00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:26,383
Mrs. Ironwood, I can understand
you being upset,

905
00:56:26,513 --> 00:56:29,560
but every word of this
is a lie.

906
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,997
I don't understand why he would
make such a thing up.

907
00:56:32,127 --> 00:56:34,216
You were seen, Ruby.

908
00:56:34,347 --> 00:56:38,438
We have an eyewitness who saw
the two of you together.

909
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:41,528
So do not play me the fool.

910
00:56:44,662 --> 00:56:48,883
You can expect to be on
your way home by day's end.

911
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,370
Congratulations,
I heard the news.

912
00:56:57,501 --> 00:56:58,893
Why are you packing?

913
00:56:59,024 --> 00:57:00,068
Well, if you're
getting kicked out,

914
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:01,766
I'm sure Mother's
not going to let me

915
00:57:01,896 --> 00:57:03,202
rot up here all by myself.

916
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:05,204
You don't really think I slept
with Buck, Gisselle?

917
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:06,597
I don't see why not.

918
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:08,207
He's awful damn easy
on the eyes,

919
00:57:08,337 --> 00:57:09,774
and let's face it,

920
00:57:09,904 --> 00:57:12,994
the pickings at an all-girls
school are pretty slim.

921
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,909
Unless you're Miss Stevens.

922
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,694
What are you talking about?

923
00:57:16,824 --> 00:57:18,304
Come on, Ruby.

924
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,176
You're not that stupid.

925
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:22,613
Miss Stevens?

926
00:57:22,743 --> 00:57:23,657
You think she's...

927
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:27,444
You're such a bumpkin, Ruby.

928
00:57:27,574 --> 00:57:28,967
You're crazy.

929
00:57:29,097 --> 00:57:31,360
Anyway, you may as well unpack.

930
00:57:31,491 --> 00:57:33,232
This story is total nonsense.

931
00:57:33,362 --> 00:57:34,581
Why should that matter?

932
00:57:34,712 --> 00:57:35,364
You're accused.

933
00:57:35,495 --> 00:57:36,975
You may as well have done it.

934
00:57:37,105 --> 00:57:38,542
I'm not taking this
lying down.

935
00:57:39,717 --> 00:57:40,718
What a choice of words.

936
00:57:40,848 --> 00:57:43,590
Ruby, don't waste your time
fighting this.

937
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:45,679
Can't you see this is our way
out of here?

938
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:47,115
Just button your lip,
and before you know it

939
00:57:47,246 --> 00:57:49,596
we'll be back at our own school
with our friends again.

940
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:51,990
And you won't be so far away
from your precious Beau.

941
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,557
Don't you want that?

942
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:55,472
It's nothing to you, Gisselle.

943
00:57:55,602 --> 00:57:58,562
It's not your reputation
at stake.

944
00:57:58,692 --> 00:58:00,389
They can kick me out
if they want,

945
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,870
but it's not going to be
because of a lie.

946
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:04,916
Can you get my other suitcase
down for me?

947
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:13,968
And then what happened,
Mrs. Grey?

948
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:16,101
I looked through
the boathouse window.

949
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:18,669
And tell us what you saw,
Mrs. Grey.

950
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,540
I saw skin.

951
00:58:20,671 --> 00:58:27,329
Ruby and that man were
in the heated throes of...

952
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,853
I'll just say whoopie.

953
00:58:29,897 --> 00:58:31,159
Compose yourself, Miss Dumas.

954
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,510
Was I giving him his money's
worth, Mrs. Grey?

955
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,989
I, I think we have
heard enough.

956
00:58:39,428 --> 00:58:41,779
My defence is pretty simple.

957
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:44,346
I couldn't have been
at the boathouse at 7:30

958
00:58:44,477 --> 00:58:47,349
because I was at the Clairborne
house then.

959
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,090
You can confirm it
with Mrs. Clairborne.

960
00:58:49,221 --> 00:58:50,962
Mrs. Clairborne left town
this morning.

961
00:58:51,092 --> 00:58:53,225
Well, that's convenient for you.

962
00:58:53,355 --> 00:58:55,749
The problem is, her grandson
Louis also knows I was there.

963
00:58:57,142 --> 00:58:58,317
Louis is blind.

964
00:58:58,447 --> 00:58:59,753
Yes, I noticed that too.

965
00:58:59,884 --> 00:59:04,149
How could a blind man testify
as to what time it was?

966
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,200
Buck Jenson's
detailed confession

967
00:59:12,331 --> 00:59:14,333
about your multiple trysts.

968
00:59:14,463 --> 00:59:17,336
Sworn to and signed.

969
00:59:17,466 --> 00:59:19,338
I want him to repeat that lie
to my face.

970
00:59:19,468 --> 00:59:20,861
Mr. Jenson was fired,

971
00:59:20,992 --> 00:59:24,169
and escorted from campus
this morning.

972
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:28,390
Well...

973
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:31,829
I guess you have nothing else
to say.

974
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,399
Any last words?

975
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:41,186
I know Mrs. Grey believes
she's telling the truth.

976
00:59:41,316 --> 00:59:43,318
But I was not there.

977
00:59:43,449 --> 00:59:44,406
I was...

978
00:59:44,537 --> 00:59:47,279
I'll tell them where you were,
Ruby.

979
00:59:47,409 --> 00:59:48,889
This is a school matter, Louis.

980
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,369
Yes, and I have information

981
00:59:50,499 --> 00:59:52,980
pertaining to that matter,
Martha.

982
00:59:53,111 --> 00:59:54,591
I take it that some people
here are saying

983
00:59:54,721 --> 00:59:57,898
that Ruby wasn't at my house
last night at half past seven.

984
00:59:58,029 --> 00:59:59,770
I'm saying she was.

985
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,293
Court adjourned?

986
01:00:01,423 --> 01:00:05,514
Louis, your testimony about
the correct time is doubtful,

987
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:07,255
for reasons that are obvious.

988
01:00:07,386 --> 01:00:10,345
Well see, there's blind and then
there's not so blind anymore.

989
01:00:10,476 --> 01:00:12,565
Take the clock on the wall,
for instance.

990
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:15,960
I'm reading 1:37.

991
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:19,964
Yes, fine!

992
01:00:20,094 --> 01:00:21,835
But... but that
does not matter!

993
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:24,098
The evidence against Ruby
is overwhelming.

994
01:00:24,229 --> 01:00:26,753
The butler knows exactly
what time she came and left.

995
01:00:26,884 --> 01:00:28,973
His eyes are top-notch,
I might add.

996
01:00:29,103 --> 01:00:31,279
I think we can assume a case
of
mistaken identity

997
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:34,543
on the part of Mrs. Grey, and
throw away the paper
confession

998
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:36,633
from a man who's either
unwilling to,

999
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:38,852
or has been prevented
from allowing Ruby

1000
01:00:38,983 --> 01:00:42,029
to face her accuser because
I believe that is not the kind

1001
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,988
of railroading the Clairborne
Foundation

1002
01:00:44,118 --> 01:00:47,644
would like to be
associated with.

1003
01:00:47,774 --> 01:00:51,125
Nor is it in the tradition of
the Greenwood School for Girls.

1004
01:00:51,256 --> 01:00:53,301
Is it, Martha?

1005
01:01:00,308 --> 01:01:01,832
I thought I was finished
for sure.

1006
01:01:01,962 --> 01:01:02,963
When she said
"case dismissed,"

1007
01:01:03,094 --> 01:01:04,748
it sounded like it was
her last breath.

1008
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:06,706
Yeah, I'm kind of having
a hard time

1009
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:08,665
breathing myself right now,
thank you.

1010
01:01:08,795 --> 01:01:12,233
I had no idea your sight
had improved that much.

1011
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:13,974
Well, I mean, the thing
about that is...

1012
01:01:14,105 --> 01:01:15,497
Now Ruby, I don't
encourage cheating,

1013
01:01:15,628 --> 01:01:17,282
but I figured
they'd test him,

1014
01:01:17,412 --> 01:01:19,676
so I told Louis what time it was
before we barged in.

1015
01:01:19,806 --> 01:01:21,112
Everything else I said
was true.

1016
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:24,115
You're a true friend.

1017
01:01:24,245 --> 01:01:25,899
You both are.

1018
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:27,640
I'll never forget this.

1019
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:29,424
And I can't wait to see
the look on Gisselle's face

1020
01:01:29,555 --> 01:01:30,948
when she learns she's
not going anywhere.

1021
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:35,300
Mrs. Grey?

1022
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:40,218
I just want you to know
that I don't blame you

1023
01:01:40,348 --> 01:01:43,830
for anything you said,
and I don't think you lied.

1024
01:01:43,961 --> 01:01:47,791
But I promise you,
you were mistaken.

1025
01:01:49,488 --> 01:01:52,709
Ruby. You got away with it.

1026
01:01:52,839 --> 01:01:55,929
Please, don't insult me
on top of everything.

1027
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:58,584
I saw you plain as day.

1028
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,587
I saw your face,
I saw your dress,

1029
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:06,070
I saw your shoes,
I saw everything.

1030
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,594
I know it was you.

1031
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,909
What did you say
I was wearing?

1032
01:02:46,414 --> 01:02:48,765
Mrs. Grey: Blue suede shoes.

1033
01:02:51,028 --> 01:02:52,072
Samantha?

1034
01:02:53,552 --> 01:02:55,380
Where are you, dummy?

1035
01:03:05,956 --> 01:03:07,261
Gisselle!

1036
01:03:07,392 --> 01:03:09,220
Oh, my god! Are you trying
to give me a heart attack?

1037
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:10,438
You can walk?!

1038
01:03:10,569 --> 01:03:12,876
Keep your voice down.

1039
01:03:13,006 --> 01:03:14,791
What are you doing anyway,
spying on me?

1040
01:03:14,921 --> 01:03:17,402
Everybody thought your injury
was permanent.

1041
01:03:17,532 --> 01:03:19,926
Yeah, well, it wasn't.

1042
01:03:20,057 --> 01:03:22,233
This is a new low, Gisselle.

1043
01:03:22,363 --> 01:03:24,191
Even for you.

1044
01:03:24,322 --> 01:03:27,804
You let everyone keep thinking
you were disabled and helpless.

1045
01:03:27,934 --> 01:03:29,588
Stop making such a big
thing over it.

1046
01:03:29,718 --> 01:03:31,633
I get treated better
when I'm in the chair.

1047
01:03:31,764 --> 01:03:34,854
I guess I should be surprised,
but...

1048
01:03:34,985 --> 01:03:36,682
So you were the one
who was with Buck.

1049
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,728
I had to find something fun
to do up here in snooze city.

1050
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:41,426
He was the only game
in town.

1051
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:43,602
I only slept with him
three or four times.

1052
01:03:43,732 --> 01:03:45,343
And you should feel flattered,
he thought I was you.

1053
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:47,171
Well, the fun's over, Gisselle.

1054
01:03:47,301 --> 01:03:49,129
I'm going to tell everyone
what a fraud you are.

1055
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,175
Oh, I don't think that's such
a good idea, Ruby.

1056
01:03:51,305 --> 01:03:52,306
No kidding.

1057
01:03:52,437 --> 01:03:53,830
You rat on me and
I'll have no choice

1058
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,962
but to spill the beans
about your gay art teacher

1059
01:03:56,093 --> 01:03:58,269
to Mrs. Ironwood.

1060
01:03:58,399 --> 01:03:59,487
Wha?

1061
01:03:59,618 --> 01:04:01,838
Oh, my god, could it be
any more obvious?

1062
01:04:01,968 --> 01:04:04,318
Ironwood's got to be more blind
than her nephew.

1063
01:04:04,449 --> 01:04:06,755
There really is no limit
to the depths you'll sink to.

1064
01:04:06,886 --> 01:04:09,497
You better believe it, sister.

1065
01:04:09,628 --> 01:04:10,977
Oh, ease up.

1066
01:04:11,108 --> 01:04:12,152
I'm not going to roll around
in this chair forever.

1067
01:04:12,283 --> 01:04:13,806
In a couple of weeks
it'll be Christmas,

1068
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:15,068
and my present to the world

1069
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:16,722
will be me miraculously
rising up

1070
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,290
onto my two healthy
legs again.

1071
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,206
Leave it to you to outshine
Jesus on his birthday.

1072
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:24,773
You're the one who always
wants to be on the cross, Ruby.

1073
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:26,601
Just keep your kisser zipped
until then,

1074
01:04:26,732 --> 01:04:28,473
and everything goes back
to normal.

1075
01:04:28,603 --> 01:04:30,736
Can you handle that?

1076
01:04:47,144 --> 01:04:49,189
Oh!

1077
01:04:50,321 --> 01:04:53,193
The day I wear puce.

1078
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:56,893
Ruby, you can have this one.

1079
01:04:59,591 --> 01:05:01,941
Men's shirts and ties.

1080
01:05:02,072 --> 01:05:04,901
Daphne, how did you know?

1081
01:05:05,031 --> 01:05:06,903
I bought them for
your Uncle Jean.

1082
01:05:07,033 --> 01:05:10,080
I thought it would be nice
if you could bring them to him.

1083
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:13,648
I think he'd much prefer being
taken out of that horrible ward

1084
01:05:13,779 --> 01:05:16,390
and put back in
his private room.

1085
01:05:16,521 --> 01:05:17,826
I think you're right.

1086
01:05:17,957 --> 01:05:19,350
I'll call the hospital today.

1087
01:05:22,135 --> 01:05:24,572
Okay Daphne.
What's going on?

1088
01:05:24,703 --> 01:05:26,313
Gisselle and I can do
whatever we want,

1089
01:05:26,444 --> 01:05:28,620
out of nowhere you care
about Uncle Jean.

1090
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,143
I have to believe
something more

1091
01:05:30,274 --> 01:05:31,753
than the Christmas spirit's
gotten into you?

1092
01:05:31,884 --> 01:05:33,930
Ho, ho, ho.

1093
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,019
Merry Christmas, ladies.

1094
01:05:36,149 --> 01:05:38,456
Bruce come,
sit next to me.

1095
01:05:40,545 --> 01:05:41,763
Ruby asked me a question,

1096
01:05:41,894 --> 01:05:45,028
and I thought we could
answer together.

1097
01:05:45,158 --> 01:05:46,507
Girls.

1098
01:05:46,638 --> 01:05:51,469
I have been very joyful
these last few days.

1099
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,471
Bruce and I have decided
to marry.

1100
01:05:55,777 --> 01:05:57,170
Since your father's passing,

1101
01:05:57,301 --> 01:05:59,433
Bruce has been a pillar of
strength and support to me,

1102
01:05:59,564 --> 01:06:01,827
and when I didn't think
I'd find any comfort,

1103
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,222
he's been especially caring and
I've come to love him very much.

1104
01:06:05,352 --> 01:06:07,572
Mm, and me you,
my sweet daffodil.

1105
01:06:07,702 --> 01:06:08,747
Gee, Daphne.

1106
01:06:08,877 --> 01:06:10,357
I don't know what to say.

1107
01:06:10,488 --> 01:06:12,838
What has it been, two months
since Daddy died?

1108
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,448
This isn't a rash decision.

1109
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:17,016
As much as I will always
mourn your father,

1110
01:06:17,147 --> 01:06:19,758
life is for the living.

1111
01:06:19,888 --> 01:06:21,978
And I'm hoping you can both
be happy for us.

1112
01:06:22,108 --> 01:06:23,762
I'm actually hoping that
we can all come together

1113
01:06:23,892 --> 01:06:25,416
as one big happy family

1114
01:06:25,546 --> 01:06:29,507
and I'm hoping that it can be
apparent to everyone.

1115
01:06:29,637 --> 01:06:30,943
Don't worry, Mother.

1116
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:34,338
We'll all show up smiling big
in the society pages.

1117
01:06:34,468 --> 01:06:35,992
I'd appreciate that too.

1118
01:06:36,122 --> 01:06:39,473
Well, I have a little bit of
an announcement myself,

1119
01:06:39,604 --> 01:06:43,129
but I don't want to reveal it
sitting down.

1120
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:56,708
Oh, my god, Gisselle!

1121
01:06:58,884 --> 01:07:00,059
Merry Christmas.

1122
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:20,036
Look out, boys.
Gisselle's back in town.

1123
01:07:30,568 --> 01:07:33,005
I have something for you.

1124
01:07:37,923 --> 01:07:41,883
Beau, you realize this is
a very big deal.

1125
01:07:49,978 --> 01:07:51,415
What are you talking about?

1126
01:07:51,545 --> 01:07:54,766
Me giving you my school ring
only means I'm yours forever.

1127
01:07:54,896 --> 01:07:57,508
Or, until you no longer want me.

1128
01:07:57,638 --> 01:08:00,598
I guess if that's a big deal.

1129
01:08:06,473 --> 01:08:09,215
I love you, Ruby.

1130
01:08:09,346 --> 01:08:11,739
If that's okay.

1131
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:14,264
What do you think, lunkhead?

1132
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,659
You better say it back.

1133
01:08:22,228 --> 01:08:24,752
I love you too, Beau.

1134
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:36,112
I know, I know.
They tell me I'm a miracle.

1135
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:43,597
Can you believe it?
I'm back.

1136
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,775
Happy New Year,
Miss Stevens.

1137
01:08:47,906 --> 01:08:50,691
I think you'll be impressed
with what I got...

1138
01:08:50,822 --> 01:08:53,129
Ruby, I'm sorry.

1139
01:08:53,259 --> 01:08:55,566
Miss Stevens is no longer here.

1140
01:08:55,696 --> 01:08:58,046
No longer?
What do you mean?

1141
01:08:58,177 --> 01:09:01,615
She resigned just before
the break.

1142
01:09:05,358 --> 01:09:07,969
Ruby, how dare you barge
in here like that?

1143
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,754
Why did you fire Miss Stevens?

1144
01:09:09,884 --> 01:09:11,495
Miss Stevens resigned.

1145
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:12,583
I don't believe you.

1146
01:09:12,713 --> 01:09:14,759
As ever, that does not matter.

1147
01:09:14,889 --> 01:09:18,415
Miss Stevens loved it here.
She would never resign.

1148
01:09:18,545 --> 01:09:21,505
Loved it a little too much,
I think.

1149
01:09:21,635 --> 01:09:24,334
I won't go into details
with you,

1150
01:09:24,464 --> 01:09:26,814
but there was a credible
accusation levelled at her

1151
01:09:26,945 --> 01:09:28,381
by a student.

1152
01:09:28,512 --> 01:09:31,819
She resigned, rather than face
the blemish of a hearing.

1153
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:33,778
Miss Stevens turned out
to be a person

1154
01:09:33,908 --> 01:09:35,867
of questionable moral character.

1155
01:09:35,997 --> 01:09:39,392
This whole school is of
questionable moral character.

1156
01:09:39,523 --> 01:09:41,351
You have just earned yourself
10 demerits

1157
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:43,440
for insubordination.

1158
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:47,835
And if these outbursts continue,
the end result will be exactly

1159
01:09:47,966 --> 01:09:52,579
what you narrowly avoided
at your hearing.

1160
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:56,757
The fact of the matter is,
Ruby Dumas,

1161
01:09:56,888 --> 01:10:00,457
you are simply not
Greenwood material.

1162
01:10:04,025 --> 01:10:08,987
You have no idea what a relief
it is to hear that.

1163
01:10:10,336 --> 01:10:11,294
Gisselle!

1164
01:10:12,382 --> 01:10:13,339
Gisselle!

1165
01:10:16,037 --> 01:10:18,649
It was you!
I know it was!

1166
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:19,563
Probably.

1167
01:10:19,693 --> 01:10:20,694
What are we talking about?

1168
01:10:20,825 --> 01:10:23,001
You told Ironwood
about Miss Stevens.

1169
01:10:24,437 --> 01:10:26,352
Jeez, you think I'm the only one
in this school

1170
01:10:26,483 --> 01:10:27,527
who was onto her?

1171
01:10:47,678 --> 01:10:49,070
Unfortunately,
the morning sickness

1172
01:10:49,201 --> 01:10:50,855
is likely to continue
for a while.

1173
01:10:50,985 --> 01:10:53,510
That's just your body reacting
to the pregnancy.

1174
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,295
Of course, we will need
to inform your parents.

1175
01:10:56,426 --> 01:10:57,557
If you'd like to call
them first

1176
01:10:57,688 --> 01:10:59,951
to tell them the situation
yourself, you may.

1177
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:01,996
But there will also have to be
an official notification

1178
01:11:02,127 --> 01:11:03,955
from the school.

1179
01:11:07,654 --> 01:11:09,003
I understand.

1180
01:11:09,134 --> 01:11:10,570
Good.

1181
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:19,623
So.

1182
01:11:19,753 --> 01:11:22,103
It was morning sickness.

1183
01:11:22,234 --> 01:11:26,673
Well, this is definitely one way
to get us sent back home.

1184
01:11:26,804 --> 01:11:29,415
I'm glad this works out for you,
Gisselle.

1185
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:39,120
It's not for sure they'll kick
you out for this.

1186
01:11:39,251 --> 01:11:42,080
That's where I put my money.

1187
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:44,430
Well, my money would've gone
on me getting pregnant

1188
01:11:44,561 --> 01:11:47,128
way before you ever would.

1189
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:52,786
Jeez, Ruby.

1190
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:56,486
Didn't you and Beau ever think
about using protection?

1191
01:12:00,664 --> 01:12:04,015
Not everyone is as wise as you,
Gisselle.

1192
01:12:12,632 --> 01:12:14,634
I could've guessed
this was coming.

1193
01:12:14,765 --> 01:12:16,549
How you ever made it to 17
in the Bayou

1194
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,465
without any children
is miracle enough.

1195
01:12:19,596 --> 01:12:21,946
And how I ever thought
that decent society

1196
01:12:22,076 --> 01:12:25,950
would have any influence
on you is beyond my capacity.

1197
01:12:27,473 --> 01:12:30,215
Nevertheless, we must have
this taken care of

1198
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,391
before word gets out.

1199
01:12:32,522 --> 01:12:36,743
Do I have any say
in this matter?

1200
01:12:36,874 --> 01:12:40,878
You absolutely do not.

1201
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:43,010
It's bad enough that I have to
deal with you and your sister.

1202
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:45,273
If you think I'm going to let
some bastard child

1203
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:49,495
in this house, you are
out of your mind.

1204
01:12:49,626 --> 01:12:51,192
Anyways, it's all arranged.

1205
01:12:51,323 --> 01:12:58,286
Tomorrow, you will be taken to a
special doctor outside of town.

1206
01:12:58,417 --> 01:12:59,940
I'll also have you know

1207
01:13:00,071 --> 01:13:01,377
that I'm going to do
everything I can

1208
01:13:01,507 --> 01:13:05,076
to make sure you are removed
from your father's will.

1209
01:13:06,904 --> 01:13:09,210
And speaking of that,

1210
01:13:09,341 --> 01:13:11,561
if you have any plans of ever
seeing Beau again,

1211
01:13:11,691 --> 01:13:13,563
you might as well put those
thoughts out of your head.

1212
01:13:13,693 --> 01:13:16,130
His parents informed me
that they would disinherit him

1213
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:20,570
if he ever so much as mentions
your name.

1214
01:14:05,136 --> 01:14:09,749
Ruby, I want us
to run off together.

1215
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,448
With what?

1216
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:13,927
You're not being practical.

1217
01:14:14,058 --> 01:14:16,887
What's practical, Ruby?

1218
01:14:17,017 --> 01:14:19,411
My parents want me to go
to school in France,

1219
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:21,761
and, and you...

1220
01:14:33,817 --> 01:14:36,254
I'm not taking that back.

1221
01:14:36,384 --> 01:14:39,170
Not unless it means you really
don't want me anymore.

1222
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:42,869
Of course I want you.

1223
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,088
I love you.

1224
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:46,177
I love you too.

1225
01:14:48,919 --> 01:14:52,488
But they will never let us
be together.

1226
01:14:52,618 --> 01:14:54,490
I don't accept that.

1227
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:20,516
Beau, you have to leave.

1228
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:22,518
You can't be here.

1229
01:15:57,161 --> 01:15:59,119
The procedure
shouldn't take long.

1230
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:01,078
If there's any profuse bleeding,

1231
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:03,559
we'll suture it and make sure
it's completely stopped

1232
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:05,125
before we send you
on your way.

1233
01:16:16,963 --> 01:16:18,704
This isn't right.

1234
01:16:22,795 --> 01:16:24,101
I'm sorry?

1235
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:26,973
I'm not doing this.

1236
01:16:27,104 --> 01:16:28,235
Miss Dumas.

1237
01:16:28,366 --> 01:16:30,586
I promised your mother,
you would not leave here

1238
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:33,545
until it was completely done.

1239
01:16:33,676 --> 01:16:36,635
Well, you're going to break
that promise.

1240
01:16:36,766 --> 01:16:39,595
Miss Dumas, you come right
back here.

1241
01:16:41,988 --> 01:16:45,078
Stop, I'm not going back
to New Orleans.

1242
01:16:45,209 --> 01:16:49,474
When you see Daphne, tell her
she's finally rid of me.

1243
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,722
Thanks for coming to get me.

1244
01:17:19,852 --> 01:17:22,420
I didn't know who to turn to.

1245
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:25,075
I'm always here for you, Ruby.

1246
01:17:25,205 --> 01:17:28,165
Especially now with
the baby coming.

1247
01:17:32,169 --> 01:17:34,780
If you know anything,
you know that.

1248
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:05,376
Your grandpère Jack died
right out there.

1249
01:18:06,899 --> 01:18:09,467
He didn't ever stop looking
for some secret stash of money

1250
01:18:09,597 --> 01:18:12,644
he was sure your grandmère
hid from him.

1251
01:18:12,775 --> 01:18:15,647
Everybody told him he was
chasing a fantasy,

1252
01:18:15,778 --> 01:18:17,780
but he didn't listen.

1253
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:20,347
Mule-headed, right to the end.

1254
01:18:20,478 --> 01:18:24,134
Yeah, he was digging by
the water's edge, stumbled in,

1255
01:18:24,264 --> 01:18:27,441
I guess he was too drunk
to get himself out.

1256
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,663
Yeah, I tried to get in contact
with you

1257
01:18:31,794 --> 01:18:33,056
to let you know
what had happened,

1258
01:18:33,186 --> 01:18:37,321
but no one let me
through to you.

1259
01:18:37,451 --> 01:18:40,672
Thanks for bringing me home,
Paul.

1260
01:18:40,803 --> 01:18:42,282
You should get going.

1261
01:18:42,413 --> 01:18:44,197
I've got a lot of cleaning up
to do.

1262
01:18:44,328 --> 01:18:46,330
Ruby. Ruby.

1263
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:49,202
Stop for a second.

1264
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:50,943
There's no reason for you
to stay here

1265
01:18:51,074 --> 01:18:54,860
in this dirty old shack.

1266
01:18:54,991 --> 01:18:57,123
Come home with me.

1267
01:18:57,254 --> 01:19:00,083
Let me take care of you.

1268
01:19:00,213 --> 01:19:03,739
That's all I ever
wanted to do.

1269
01:19:08,352 --> 01:19:10,267
My place is here, Paul.

1270
01:20:30,303 --> 01:20:31,696
It's open.

1271
01:20:34,481 --> 01:20:36,135
It's cats and dogs out there.

1272
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:37,310
On the radio they're saying

1273
01:20:37,441 --> 01:20:38,964
it's going to be a hurricane
coming on.

1274
01:20:39,095 --> 01:20:40,531
What's that you have there?

1275
01:20:40,661 --> 01:20:41,924
A letter from Gisselle.

1276
01:20:42,054 --> 01:20:43,751
I picked it up from
the post office for you.

1277
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:48,321
It's getting real bad
out there.

1278
01:20:48,452 --> 01:20:49,453
It's time for you to come.

1279
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:51,411
I've ridden out worse storms
in this house.

1280
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:52,848
Why would you put the baby
at risk?

1281
01:20:52,978 --> 01:20:55,633
The baby's in the safest place
it's ever going to be.

1282
01:20:58,114 --> 01:21:00,246
The sirens are on!

1283
01:21:00,377 --> 01:21:02,422
"Dear Ruby,
bet you never dreamed

1284
01:21:02,553 --> 01:21:04,424
"you'd receive a letter from me.

1285
01:21:04,555 --> 01:21:05,817
"Well, here it is."

1286
01:21:05,948 --> 01:21:07,732
Ruby, it's stuck!

1287
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:10,082
"Guess what?

1288
01:21:10,213 --> 01:21:12,128
"Mother gave in and let me
come home.

1289
01:21:12,258 --> 01:21:13,912
"Someone spread the word
all over Greenwood

1290
01:21:14,043 --> 01:21:16,132
"that you had a bun
in your oven.

1291
01:21:16,262 --> 01:21:18,134
"I wonder who?

1292
01:21:18,264 --> 01:21:20,701
"Boy, you really stuck it
to her good.

1293
01:21:20,832 --> 01:21:23,356
"I guess I really should also
tell what's going on with Beau."

1294
01:21:32,017 --> 01:21:33,889
That's it, we're getting
out of here now.

1295
01:21:34,019 --> 01:21:35,412
I can't leave, Paul.

1296
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:36,935
No, come on, we're both
getting out of here now.

1297
01:21:37,066 --> 01:21:39,590
Paul! The baby's coming!

1298
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,983
Now?

1299
01:21:41,113 --> 01:21:42,810
I'm sorry, I didn't plan
it this way!

1300
01:21:42,941 --> 01:21:44,377
Hold on.

1301
01:21:46,379 --> 01:21:47,554
Please, just hang tight.

1302
01:21:47,685 --> 01:21:49,121
I'm going to try and seal
this place up, okay?

1303
01:21:59,436 --> 01:22:00,916
Hang on!

1304
01:22:02,352 --> 01:22:04,049
Paul, it's coming!

1305
01:22:58,234 --> 01:23:00,714
How you holding up?

1306
01:23:02,194 --> 01:23:03,979
I'm doing great.

1307
01:23:14,076 --> 01:23:16,426
Oh, she's a beauty.

1308
01:23:16,556 --> 01:23:18,558
She's perfect.

1309
01:23:18,689 --> 01:23:20,865
Have you settled on
a name yet?

1310
01:23:22,736 --> 01:23:26,305
Her name is Pearl.

1311
01:23:26,436 --> 01:23:28,003
Hi, Pearl.

1312
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,578
I'll never stop loving you,
Ruby.

1313
01:23:38,709 --> 01:23:42,582
I'll never stop asking you
to marry me.

1314
01:23:42,713 --> 01:23:44,149
I know, Paul.

1315
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:49,154
No one has to know the truth
about us.

1316
01:23:49,285 --> 01:23:52,549
I don't expect anything
but a no right now.

1317
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:56,553
But just do me a favour.

1318
01:23:56,683 --> 01:23:59,208
Tell me you'll think about it.

1319
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:08,173
I'll think about it.

1320
01:24:14,919 --> 01:24:16,312
I'll go check on the roof.

1321
01:24:16,442 --> 01:24:18,357
Okay.

1322
01:24:54,437 --> 01:24:56,265
Shh.

1323
01:25:03,663 --> 01:25:06,579
"I guess I really should also
tell what's going on with
Beau.

1324
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:07,972
"He's still in France,

1325
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:10,235
"and he'll probably even go
to some French college.

1326
01:25:10,366 --> 01:25:11,932
"And get this,

1327
01:25:12,063 --> 01:25:14,283
"he's super serious with some
rich French girl.

1328
01:25:14,413 --> 01:25:17,373
"If he marries her, he'll become
a Duke or something.

1329
01:25:17,503 --> 01:25:19,244
"I don't know why you didn't
just do what mother wanted

1330
01:25:19,375 --> 01:25:21,116
"and get rid of the baby.

1331
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:23,770
"Think about all the things
you gave up.

1332
01:25:23,901 --> 01:25:28,297
"On the other hand, I do enjoy
having a notorious sister.

1333
01:25:28,427 --> 01:25:31,952
"I even miss you sometimes,
if you can believe it.

1334
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:34,172
"And I just love reminding
old Daphne

1335
01:25:34,303 --> 01:25:36,043
"that she's going to be
a grandmother.

1336
01:25:36,174 --> 01:25:40,570
"She gets sick to her stomach
every time she hears it.

1337
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:43,877
"I wonder if we'll ever see
each other again.

1338
01:25:44,008 --> 01:25:47,751
"Your darling twin sister,
Gisselle."

1339
01:26:02,026 --> 01:26:04,637
Welcome to the Bayou,
Pearl Landry.

1340
01:26:07,988 --> 01:26:09,512
Dumas?

1341
01:26:12,602 --> 01:26:13,516
Tate?
