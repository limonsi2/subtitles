3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:11,302
(lively music begins)

4
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,380
- My name is Maddy and I
have three moms and no dad.

5
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,631
That sounds pretty wild,

6
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,424
and I totally wanna
explain everything,

7
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,719
but first we should
meet Lynette Price.

8
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,221
Not too many years ago,

9
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,807
Lynette was a grad student and
lived in the academic wilds

10
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,725
of Southern California.

11
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,727
School didn't allow
Lynette too many breaks

12
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,104
but one thing she
looked forward to

13
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,231
was the monthly dinner
party she took turns hosting

14
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,234
with her best friends,
Jessica and Candy.

15
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,735
(knocking)

16
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,154
- Just a second.

17
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,240
(knocking continues)

18
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,580
- I was robbed.

19
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,332
- My God, I'm
calling the police.

20
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,126
- [Candy] Hello-hello.

21
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,335
- [Lynette] We've
got an emergency.

22
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,295
- What happened?

23
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,588
- Jess got robbed last night.

24
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,298
I'm trying to call the police.

25
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,799
- Couldn't you call
them last night?

26
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,260
- They wouldn't let me use my
cell phone in the ambulance.

27
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,761
- What were you doing
in an ambulance?

28
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,846
- They had to take
me to the hospital

29
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,805
to get out the shrapnel.

30
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,015
- Shrapnel?

31
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,184
- It's okay, honey, the
staples are holding.

32
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,768
- Why did they staple you?

33
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,312
- Well, there's this little
girl and she needed a kidney

34
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,605
and we were a match.

35
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,273
- You donated one
of your kidneys?

36
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,774
That's so, so-

37
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,318
- Out of character.

38
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,280
- Well everything changed
when I saw the angel.

39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,282
- Oh, a real angel?

40
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,452
- She was wearing this
amazing dress, Dior, I think.

41
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,369
- Angel.

42
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,955
- She was super cute. All glowy.

43
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,499
- Jess, what do you need?

44
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,795
- Your apartment.

45
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,174
(slow music begins)

46
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,176
- When did Jessica
as a young girl

47
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,803
realize that people were
treating her specially

48
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,014
because of the way she looked?

49
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,141
And when did she figure
out how to use that

50
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,184
to her advantage?

51
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,478
(sighs)

52
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,979
- Aren't you going
to kick me out?

53
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,690
- You must keep your hands
to yourself, Jessica.

54
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,816
- Why aren't you
going to kick me out?

55
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,026
I pushed over Melanie.

56
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,403
- Yes. And you cannot do that.

57
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,656
- Kick me out, make
her play Clara.

58
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,241
She's so much better than me.

59
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,492
- I know, but-

60
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,327
- See, you agree she's better.

61
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,997
- Our donors expect
grace and beauty.

62
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,500
You project that
better than Melanie.

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,669
- How? I'm a total slob.

64
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,838
Have my sister Carolyn do it.

65
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,383
She's beautiful
and full of grace.

66
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,009
- We don't have time for this.

67
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,011
You will play the part of Clara.

68
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,680
You will let Melanie coach you,

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,391
and you will keep your
hands to yourself.

70
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,850
- Or what?

71
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,520
- Or I will let your mother
know that you hit another child.

72
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,355
- Did you hear what
Melanie said to me?

73
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,024
When you told her to help
me she said, "Why bother?"

74
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,909
- Take this.

75
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,370
Go to the bakery and
get yourself something.

76
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,123
Cool down. And then come back.

77
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,374
- Is this a bribe?

78
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,709
- It's a deal.

79
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,754
(background soft
music continues)

80
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,801
- [Lynette] Why do
you need my apartment?

81
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,636
- I have a date, silly.

82
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,263
- You also have
your own apartment.

83
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,556
- You have a date?

84
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,558
Oh, so you're okay.

85
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,809
- Oh, careful. My face hurts.

86
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,727
- Oh.

87
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,562
From where the robbers beat you?

88
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,772
- It's been hurting
worse every day.

89
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:18,901
I bought this makeup Iman and
I think I'm allergic to it.

90
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:23,323
- Iman? The model? But you
don't want anything like her.

91
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,741
- I'm doing a tanned thing.

92
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,910
Damn Iman!

93
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,786
It's been hurting all week.

94
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,747
- Have you seen a doctor?

95
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,791
- Yeah. He gave me some goop,
but I'm not going to touch it.

96
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,751
- Why not?

97
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,960
- Goop dries out your skin.

98
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,171
If I dry my skin, I'll look old.

99
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,422
- But-

100
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,631
- Well, I'm not going to
walk around looking old.

101
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,592
- People do it every day.

102
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,636
- Lynnie, this is
how you can help me.

103
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,639
Let me use your apartment so
this guy thinks I'm smart.

104
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,266
- Jess, you are smart.

105
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,810
- No, I have taste.
Big difference.

106
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,188
- Does my apartment look smart?

107
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,775
(soft music continues)

108
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,611
- What moron convinced
young Lynette

109
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,446
that being the smartest
one in the room

110
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,281
wasn't a good thing?

111
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,284
(soft music begins)

112
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,455
- Hi, Enzo.

113
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,625
- Hey, Lynette.

114
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,668
- Mr. Marsh said that you
were looking for someone

115
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,295
to help you with geometry.

116
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,505
I'm a pretty good tutor.

117
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,508
- Look, I know you're smart

118
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,301
but that doesn't mean I
want to hang out with you.

119
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,677
- But-
- No.

120
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,304
Are you going to buy anything?

121
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,473
Because I gotta
get back to work.

122
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,849
- Enzo, clean toilet.

123
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,145
Good afternoon.

124
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,647
Special today is spinach
and (mumbles) croissant.

125
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,650
- I guess I'll have a
piece of Devil's Food cake.

126
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,988
- You have smart things.

127
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,157
Your smart pictures,

128
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,909
smart furniture.

129
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,994
Look at this flute thing.

130
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,247
No normal person can
play a thing like this.

131
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,165
- It was an heirloom.

132
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,375
- Say that again.

133
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,334
- Heirloom.

134
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,670
- Heirloom.

135
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,712
Heirloom.

136
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,256
Oh, look, honey.

137
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,174
This precious little flute
thing here is a heirloom.

138
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,342
- [Lynette] An heirloom.

139
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,010
- Oh, of course I don't
know how to play it.

140
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,555
That's a lost art form
from the underclass.

141
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,225
- Actually you can
learn how down at the Y.

142
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,852
- What's a "Y"?

143
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,856
- The YMCA. Where I teach
knitting and take scrapbooking.

144
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,859
- Is this a first date?

145
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,193
- No. Third.

146
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,695
- Third date with the same guy?

147
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,030
Congratulations!

148
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,449
- Ow.

149
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,576
- No, it's just that
getting to a third date

150
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,910
seems hard for you.

151
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,370
- Ow.

152
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,372
- No, it's not that men don't
want to go out with you.

153
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,206
It's just-

154
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,207
- You get bored.

155
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,125
(chuckles)

156
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,543
- Like men never bore you two.

157
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,044
- I never meet any.

158
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,547
At her job, Candy must have
to beat them off with a stick.

159
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,758
(slow music continues)

160
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,220
- Young candy
seemed to know right

161
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,139
from the start that her
sunny smile could light up

162
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,265
even the darkest day.

163
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,435
- Hi.

164
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,769
- I'm Candy's mother.

165
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,231
There's been a
loss in the family.

166
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,065
- I know.

167
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,901
I was told. I'm sorry.

168
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:06,903
Candy.

169
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,491
Did you grab your
reader, Sunshine?

170
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,327
- You call her Sunshine?

171
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,079
- Oh, we all do. It's her smile.

172
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,581
Oh, I could put a
stop to it if you-

173
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,499
- No. Please don't.

174
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,417
It's beautiful.

175
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,419
- Bye, Ms. Jenkins.

176
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,253
- Bye.

177
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,769
- Mommy, why are you so sad?

178
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,647
- I miss my mommy.

179
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,945
- When you're sad, something
sweet can make you feel better.

180
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,947
That's what Ms. Jenkins says.

181
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,658
- Maybe we'll stop on the
way and get your favorite.

182
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,785
- Hugs can help too.

183
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,956
- They help so much, Sunshine.

184
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,793
- Our first two dates
were out on the town

185
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,128
so now I'm going to show
him my domestic side.

186
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,172
- You don't have
a domestic side.

187
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,173
- Well, exactly.

188
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,716
So I'm going to use yours.

189
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,302
- Ooh, is this with that guy
who works on the 21st floor?

190
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,804
- No, I'm so over him.

191
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,972
- 18th floor?

192
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,307
- He kisses like Scooby-Doo.

193
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,226
- The hunk from the mail room?

194
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,478
(chuckles)

195
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,897
- Like I would ever
do the mail room.

196
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,148
- But-

197
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,149
- Hey, we agreed
that never happened.

198
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,528
- Is this that guy we met
at that party last weekend?

199
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,654
- Which?

200
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,488
- The tall one.

201
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,489
Dark hair?

202
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,574
- No, no no. Which party?

203
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,075
- You and I met a photographer.

204
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,326
- Oh yeah!

205
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,704
He stared at me
with bridal lust.

206
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,913
I almost slapped him.

207
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,331
- I talked to him a little.

208
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,709
- Little? More like 45 minutes.

209
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,503
But yeah, he and I went out
for drinks later that night.

210
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,505
- Oh.

211
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,425
He seemed nice.

212
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,178
- He is going to take one
look around this apartment

213
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,432
and think that I don't
need him, which is perfect.

214
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,226
- My apartment says
I don't need men?

215
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,270
- Everything about you
says you don't need men.

216
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,188
- She's working on her PhD.

217
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,106
- Exactly.

218
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,191
- Educated women don't need men?

219
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,193
- Maybe for experiments
or something.

220
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,905
But, look, you
talk so much about

221
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,200
whatever it is that you study

222
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,536
that I could write a
desecration of my own.

223
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,579
- Well, don't worry.

224
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,789
I'm through talking about it.

225
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,374
- See, she's sick of it too.

226
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,376
- You've finished
your dissertation?

227
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,378
Oh, congratulations.

228
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,130
- Are we celebrating?

229
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,632
Should I get a stripper?

230
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,050
I know a really good one
with a pizza boy routine.

231
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,926
- Let's celebrate with
what I got from work.

232
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,138
There's salads and for
dressing we have honey-mustard,

233
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,474
light Italian and
strawberry pistachio

234
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,225
- Strawberry pistachio?

235
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,560
Is that a new recipe?

236
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,562
- New accident, but
it's not that bad.

237
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,732
- Dude, your disaster
dressing can be poisonous.

238
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,236
Like the strawberries
and the nuts

239
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,114
could have some crazy
chemical reaction

240
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,741
like when you mixed
drink cleaners.

241
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,910
- When did you ever
touch drain cleaner?

242
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,913
- I saw it on "News
of the Weird".

243
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,581
Some lady died.

244
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,084
- Oh, shut up and
taste it, Jess.

245
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,341
- Damn it!

246
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,300
- You hate it?

247
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,094
- Well, it's delicious.

248
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,428
- Then what?

249
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,472
- Why does Candy have
to be so creative?

250
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,432
I mean, it's bad
enough that she looks

251
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,435
how she looks.

252
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,271
- Why don't you borrow
Candy's place for your date?

253
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,189
- Uh.

254
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,774
- Guys love creative women.

255
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,319
And in her bedroom Candy has
scratch-and-sniff wallpaper.

256
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,779
- Oh I wore that out.

257
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,824
- And books from
all over the world.

258
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,118
I never knew there was more
than one version of Cinderella.

259
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,285
- Yeah, the Brothers
Grimm's version

260
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,787
is called "Aschenputtel".

261
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,330
- Amazing.

262
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,290
Jess, this guy would
fall in love with you

263
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,042
if you were Candy.

264
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,128
- "Ashpuddle". It sounds dirty.

265
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,547
Ow.

266
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,339
Face. Ow.

267
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,176
- Hey, why don't we
take our monthly picture

268
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,679
so you can take
off Iman's makeup.

269
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,389
- No, no, I can wait.

270
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,474
You guys finish
your little salads

271
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,143
with your scary dressing.

272
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,312
(gentle music begins)

273
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,319
Oh. It feels kind of
like sunburn your face.

274
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,821
- Your face?

275
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,239
- Yeah.

276
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,574
Like warm and prickly.

277
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,326
But if I just stare at the wall

278
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,495
and don't move, it's fine.

279
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,833
But then my neck gets tired.

280
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,587
- I'm so sorry you're
not feeling good, Jess.

281
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,507
- Lynnie, do you have any acids
so I can burn my skin off?

282
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,342
- Go get some ice
out of the freezer.

283
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,344
- Okay.

284
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,105
Lynnie, I don't think
your ice is cold enough.

285
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,190
- Blow on it.

286
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,024
That cools it off.

287
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,280
- Ow! My face hurts when I blow.

288
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,700
- I'm not gonna touch that.

289
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,412
- Why don't you wanna
stick your whole head in?

290
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,210
- Ow.

291
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,544
Oh my God I'm stuck.

292
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,213
I'm stuck, you guys.

293
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,632
I'm stuck, guys!

294
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,466
I'm stuck.

295
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,304
- Hold still.

296
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,889
- [Jessica] Owie, ow!

297
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,558
(water gushing)

298
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,727
- Lynnie, what happens next?

299
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,562
- I have to defend
my dissertation.

300
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,064
- Defend it?

301
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,316
- This panel of professors
rakes me over the coals.

302
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,652
- Speaking of burning
coals, my face is burning.

303
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,737
- The process helps me
scrape away the b.s.

304
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,114
- I wish I could scrape
this freezer off my face.

305
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,075
Ow.

306
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,995
- I'm counting on
them approving it.

307
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,956
If not, my face
is going to be so-

308
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,249
- Oh, don't say it.

309
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,501
- If anyone's face
is red, it's mine.

310
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,418
It burns.

311
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,420
And it's like the sun.

312
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,672
- Let's take our picture.

313
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,762
(slow music begins)

314
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,266
- How long is the timer?

315
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,767
- About two seconds.

316
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,814
(camera beeping)

317
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,940
(camera shutters)

318
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,149
Ow.

319
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,150
- Try again.

320
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,447
(camera beeping)

321
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,448
(camera shutters)

322
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,284
- Oh, nice picture of my butt.

323
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:33,873
(camera beeping)

324
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,165
(camera shutters)

325
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,125
- I need ice.

326
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:36,959
- Hold on, hun.

327
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,630
(camera beeping)

328
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,514
(camera whines)

329
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,810
Oh, the camera died.

330
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,644
- [Both] Aw.

331
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,478
- I'm sorry.

332
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,482
Now, Jess, you and Iman's
curse can part company.

333
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,984
- Thank you.

334
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,986
(sighs)

335
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,990
- [Candy] Lynnie,
are you in therapy?

336
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,325
- A therapist does
have to go through

337
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,076
a certain amount of
therapy to get a degree,

338
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,079
but I am resisting.

339
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,417
- [Candy] So are you in therapy?

340
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,337
- [Lynette] Yes, but
that's not helping.

341
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,172
Are you in therapy?

342
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,673
- I was, but she dropped me.

343
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,428
- Candy had actually been in
therapy for about six months

344
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,763
at that point.

345
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,349
A string of disappointing
relationships

346
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,558
had left her feeling

347
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,518
like she was doing
something very wrong.

348
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,395
But was she?

349
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,107
- He hates that I make
more money than him.

350
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,901
- Well, why shouldn't
you make more?

351
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,861
You have a very demanding job:

352
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,073
heavy trays,
rambunctious customers.

353
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,200
- Also he doesn't
think I'm funny.

354
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,868
He thinks that I'm a loner,

355
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,203
that my hobbies are weird.

356
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,038
- Uh, which hobbies?

357
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,539
- Well, my cat outreach,

358
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,374
my knitting.

359
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,126
- Well, alright.

360
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,131
It sounds to me
like Larry is um-

361
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,257
- Lowry.

362
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,217
- Lowry?

363
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,051
Really?

364
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,552
Lowry?

365
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,889
Well, it sounds to me like
Lowry cares about image.

366
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,724
- Well, when we were
out to dinner last week,

367
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,310
he seemed to be flirting
with other women constantly.

368
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,561
- [Celeste] Mm.

369
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,771
- He said he was
just being friendly.

370
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,232
- Uhuh. Made you kinda
uncomfortable, right?

371
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,566
- Yes.

372
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,112
He said the time we
had sex was a mistake.

373
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,740
- You had sex only once?

374
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,992
Did you enjoy it?

375
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,411
- I was glad he wanted
to have sex with me.

376
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:40,416
- All those things that he
said about you are not true.

377
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,418
Okay?

378
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,919
You are funny.

379
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,754
And you're not a loner.

380
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,091
- I once invited
Lowry to come with me

381
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:49,967
to cat socialization.

382
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,844
- Wait, wait, wait.

383
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,803
Cat what?

384
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,304
- A cat socialization.

385
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,682
It's where I go to the shelter
to play with the feral kitty

386
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,600
so they get used to humans.

387
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,435
(chuckles)

388
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,186
- Aren't you priceless?

389
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,980
- And you know
what he said to me?

390
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,273
He said, "What makes you think

391
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,650
I would ever want to do that?"

392
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,194
- Where does this
relationship stand now?

393
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,114
- Well, last night I told him

394
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,283
I don't think he's good for me.

395
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,035
And then I took back
the wall tapestry

396
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,204
that I knitted for
him. That mean?

397
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,706
- No.

398
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,791
- Imagine how a guy like
that might treat a child.

399
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,127
- I shudder to think.

400
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,962
- What do I do now?

401
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,797
I need so much therapy.

402
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:29,631
- Okay.

403
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:36,221
Candy, you got yourself out of
a very unhealthy relationship

404
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,683
all by yourself.

405
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,642
My hats off.

406
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,813
I don't think you have to
come back here anymore.

407
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:46,982
Time's up.

408
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,488
- When was this?

409
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,698
- About six months ago.

410
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:58,035
Ever since my dating
life has been nothing.

411
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,161
- Nothing?

412
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,205
Guys hit on you constantly.

413
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,831
- No, we all get hit on.

414
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,084
Guys just want to say they
went out with a Curvees girl.

415
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,169
- Guys hit on girls that
they think are pretty.

416
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,004
- For me it's just the uniform.

417
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,839
It's just like when
I was a cheerleader.

418
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,175
- Didn't you go to four
senior proms that year?

419
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,344
- Yeah, because guys just
want to take a cheerleader

420
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,553
to the prom.

421
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,097
It's the uniform.

422
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,517
- If you were ugly, why did
they make you a cheerleader?

423
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,185
- My brother was on
the football team.

424
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,520
- Oh, making you a cheerleader

425
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,854
helped your brother
play football?

426
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,899
- And my mom was vice
president of the PTA.

427
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,526
Nothing to do with me.

428
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,693
(calm music begins)

429
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,195
- The stuff hurts.

430
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,238
- What is it?

431
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,031
- It's your skin goop.

432
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,741
I found it under the sink.

433
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,743
(sighs)

434
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,042
(yelps)

435
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,921
Dog shampoo?

436
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,755
- Jess.

437
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:55,717
Come here.

438
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,096
(groans)

439
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,558
- Does she need to
go to the hospital?

440
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,392
- Yes!

441
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,226
- No.

442
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,730
- I better go soon.

443
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,274
I have to get up tomorrow.

444
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,817
- Early shift?

445
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,237
- No, I have this
special class just.

446
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,742
Jess, seriously, how did you
not know this was dog shampoo?

447
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,411
- It smelled nice.

448
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,165
- The words, dog shampoo
don't mean anything?

449
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,000
- Or the picture of the dog?

450
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,920
- Look, I just thought it was
a cheapie brand or something.

451
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,797
And besides why do
you have dogs shampoo?

452
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,798
You don't have a dog.

453
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,300
- I sometimes dog-sit.

454
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,428
- I can't remember
annoying details like that.

455
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,348
- So I'm smart, I'm annoying,
I'm Miss Cheapie Brands?

456
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,685
- Hey, you called
yourself the coupon queen.

457
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,521
- At least I do my own shopping.

458
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,440
You are always trying
to get some poor idiot

459
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,608
to buy you dinner.

460
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,776
- Okay. Well, let's
call it a night.

461
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,612
- Oh, but it was
just getting good.

462
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,114
- No, it was just getting bad.

463
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,782
I'll call you tomorrow, Lynnie.

464
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,783
- Ow. Alright.

465
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,538
Bye bye, Cheapie.

466
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,456
- Bye, Jessica.

467
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:15,547
- Sometimes you need therapy
to help sort things out.

468
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,966
And sometimes you
just need a good chat

469
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,468
with a ghost from the past.

470
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,637
A cute ghost.

471
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,390
(phone beeping)

472
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,357
(phone dialing)

473
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,235
- [Keith] Hello.

474
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,653
- Keith.

475
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,321
Hi. It's Lynette.

476
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,366
A voice from the past.

477
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,825
- [Keith] Wow. How are you?

478
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,370
- I just started my doctorate.

479
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,873
So I'm excited. But I'm a mess.

480
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,000
- [Keith] That's great.

481
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,168
I'm so proud of you.

482
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,672
- Bobby and I broke up.

483
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,008
- [Keith] How long
were you two together?

484
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,551
- Just over four years.

485
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,679
- [Keith] That's
how long it's been

486
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,596
since you and I saw each other?

487
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,014
- Since you and I last talked.

488
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,767
How's Stella?

489
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,060
- [Keith] Ha, Darla.

490
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,521
- How's Darla?

491
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,064
- [Keith] Darla is now my wife.

492
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,858
- Oh, she's so lucky.

493
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,360
I'll let you get back to that.

494
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,279
- [Keith] She's not here.

495
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,281
- Yeah, but I'm sure your
wife wouldn't want you

496
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,199
to be talking to an ex.

497
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,742
- [Keith] I'm not up to no good.

498
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,868
Uh, are you?

499
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,287
- No.

500
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,872
But you and I-

501
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,874
- [Keith] Why did you
and Bobby break up?

502
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,544
- He cheated.

503
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,715
But I think he was
just sick of me.

504
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,716
- [Keith] That's terrible.

505
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,384
Either way that's terrible.

506
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,219
I'm so sorry, Lynnie.

507
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,930
- He said he just
couldn't talk to me

508
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,598
and he was sick of trying.

509
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,062
Am I really that
hard to talk to?

510
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,981
- [Keith] You were
never hard to talk to.

511
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,069
- Was I a good lover?

512
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,576
I know I have no right to
ask a married man that but-

513
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,577
- [Keith] Good lover?

514
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,413
- Good kisser.

515
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,124
Good at other stuff.

516
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,083
- [Keith] Yes.

517
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,918
Yes, absolutely.

518
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,503
- Really?

519
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,005
- [Keith] If you weren't

520
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,799
then we wouldn't have been
together more than once.

521
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,675
Don't you agree?

522
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,972
- I guess I would give
you a second chance

523
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,182
with that great smile.

524
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,188
It's just, when
you get cheated on,

525
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,649
you lose all your confidence.

526
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,986
Just feel like you've
lost everything.

527
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:46,156
- [Keith] You are a
great lover, Lynette.

528
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,325
- Thank you.

529
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,952
- [Keith] I mean,
yeah, I'm married, but-

530
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,788
- No. Don't spoil it.

531
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,123
- [Keith] Okay.

532
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,501
You know, you and Darla
would adore each other.

533
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,129
- That's nice to hear.

534
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,714
- [Keith] Talk to
you later. Bye.

535
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,305
- Jessica's obsession
with looking good

536
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,016
worked in her most of the time.

537
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,476
But a few years earlier,

538
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,396
she applied for a job at a
company with a very silly name

539
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,648
and she spent three
days picking out

540
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,483
the perfect outfit
for the interview.

541
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,152
Oops.

542
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,322
(lively music begins)

543
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,575
- [James] Right through
there. Take a seat.

544
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,660
- Alright. Thank you.

545
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,747
- Uh, my name is Bill Whitmore,

546
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,332
and I'm here for the
interview, please.

547
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,417
- [James] Sign in.

548
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,668
- How long will it be?

549
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,836
- Just go in way.

550
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,337
Take a seat.
They'll call you in.

551
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,339
- Thank you.

552
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,344
(jazz music continues)

553
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,679
- How can I help you?

554
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,180
- Hi, my name is
Jessica Marshall.

555
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,515
I'm here for the interview.

556
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,516
- Sign in please.

557
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,856
You're next.

558
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:04,276
(lively music continues)

559
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,073
(knocks)

560
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,702
- Thank you, James.

561
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,539
It's a pleasure, Miss Marshall.

562
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:22,544
- Hello. Um, am I waiting
here for Mr. Reynolds.

563
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,588
- I'm Taylor Reynold.

564
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,422
- Oh.

565
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,548
- Is that a problem?

566
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,924
- No, of course not.

567
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,594
- It looks like you
dressed for a man.

568
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,553
(sighs)

569
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,554
- Um. I-

570
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,889
- You look really good.

571
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,475
- Thank you.

572
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,477
- Do you like working
for men more than women?

573
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,395
- Oh, I like working
more than not working.

574
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,564
- Your cover letter was honest.

575
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,732
That's why I brought you in it.

576
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,734
It certainly wasn't your resume.

577
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,153
- Oh, I see.

578
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,572
I'll show myself out.

579
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,490
- No sit.

580
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,782
You're still in the running.

581
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,911
Do you have siblings?

582
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,080
- Yes. One sister.

583
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,415
Her name is Carolyn.

584
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:04,294
She's a dancer, singer,
actress, choreographer.

585
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,922
I guess I don't have
to do those, huh?

586
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,924
- Do these things interest you?

587
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,091
- I used to dance.

588
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,762
I fell off the stage
during The Nutcracker.

589
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,805
- Your sister doesn't
fall off stages?

590
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,265
- God no!

591
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:21,436
She's beautiful and
graceful and funny, smart.

592
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,107
- Can you look this
good every day?

593
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,442
- Of course.

594
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,195
- Can you be cordial
to people you dislike?

595
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,280
- Oh gosh. I've been doing
that since I was like eleven.

596
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,826
- Are you planning to get
married or have a baby soon?

597
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,661
- Ew.

598
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,705
- Are you looking to
rise up through the ranks

599
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,458
or would you be happy
staying in the same position?

600
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,543
- Would I get paid the same?

601
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,961
- Your salary would accrue.

602
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,296
It would get bigger.

603
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,800
- Oh, well then
that would be fine.

604
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,134
- Where's your sister now?

605
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,136
- Oh she lives in New
York with her family.

606
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,350
Is it bad that I don't care
about rising through the ranks?

607
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,811
- The receptionist is
the most important person

608
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,020
at this company.

609
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,814
- I have a really
great phone voice.

610
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,816
- He or she is the first person

611
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,651
our clients come
in contact with.

612
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,652
- I can dress down.

613
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,196
- No, your look is perfect.

614
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,909
Congratulations.

615
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,995
- Really?

616
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,665
Wow. Women never give me jobs.

617
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:30,422
- Have you had some
wonderful news to share

618
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,842
but one of your pals
ruined your moment?

619
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,346
- [Candy] Hey you
guys, try this quiz.

620
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,348
- [Lynette] It looks
like Femme magazine.

621
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,017
- What's wrong with Femme mag?

622
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,935
- It's devoted to urging women

623
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:48,523
to make the most of their
assets while there's still time.

624
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,734
Nothing lobotomy wouldn't fix.

625
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,864
You try everything
to make him stay

626
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,907
yet still his eyes wander.

627
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:01,036
Take this simple quiz to find
out what you're doing wrong.

628
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,913
Because he's obviously
doing nothing wrong.

629
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,541
- I don't think
Femme is that bad.

630
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,918
They have really
great dieting tips.

631
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,880
So what's the first question?

632
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,216
- Your man says he prefers
women with larger breasts.

633
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,801
- Oh, oh.

634
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:21,056
- Do you, A, remind him
of his own shortcomings?

635
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,224
- B, assume he's not interested.

636
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,392
- That's not a choice.

637
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,894
- B, have the operation.

638
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,729
Or C, switch his glasses

639
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,398
for ones that make things
appear larger than they are.

640
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,733
- What operation?

641
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,109
- Give me.

642
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,070
I can't tell if you're
making this stuff up or not.

643
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,907
Your man complains that
you're the wrong sex.

644
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,825
Do you, A, get him into therapy

645
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,244
to cure his homosexuality?

646
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,664
B, get therapy yourself?

647
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,833
Or, C, have the operation?

648
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,293
- A breast enlargement?

649
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,420
But that would make you
even more the wrong sex.

650
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,923
- Maybe sex is just wrong.

651
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,966
- I dated a gay man
for seven months.

652
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,134
(gasps)

653
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,095
- My God, you didn't
figure it out?

654
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,346
- There were signs.

655
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,598
But he knew all these
cute little restaurants.

656
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,933
- So what happened?

657
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,267
- I gained 10 pounds.

658
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,103
- Did the cute
restaurants give it away?

659
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,771
- It was the fact that
I gained 10 pounds

660
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,940
and he didn't really mind.

661
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,943
- Your man complains that
you're not smart enough.

662
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,820
Do you, A, eat fish,

663
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,447
take night classes and
stand on your head?

664
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,658
B, hire a tutor?

665
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,202
Or, C, secretly
give him a lobotomy?

666
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,497
- How is standing on your
head gonna make you smarter?

667
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,290
- Does it really say
the lobotomy thing?

668
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,959
- I kid you not.

669
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,461
- You talk about
lobotomies a lot.

670
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,296
Did you have one?

671
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,383
- I tried, but they
only got my tonsils.

672
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,135
- Are the tonsils
near the lobotom?

673
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,805
Kidding, sweetie.

674
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,307
(sighs)

675
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:49,060
- Well, I for one have
to applaud dear Jesse

676
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,979
for such a fabulouso dinner.

677
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,147
- Hear hear.

678
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,314
- Thank you.

679
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,566
Thank you.

680
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,151
- Did you really whip
all this up by herself?

681
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,153
- Me and Marsha Stewart.

682
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,321
- Martha Stewart.
Isn't she great?

683
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,157
- Oh, you used a cookbook?

684
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,659
- No, there's this tape
where she cooks stuff.

685
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,327
- These chicken
wings were to die.

686
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,496
What kind were they?

687
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,998
- Uh.

688
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,750
Muhkayzian Style.

689
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,168
- Curvees is supposed
to have a great wings

690
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,170
but they can't hold
a candle to yours.

691
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,173
- Muhkayzhian style?

692
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,551
- Yeah. It's some
country somewhere.

693
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,845
- Kind of like Malaysia?

694
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,721
- Yes.

695
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,514
Malaysia. They love chicken.

696
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,600
- And what was that
green leafy stuff?

697
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,768
- Uh.

698
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,895
Mold.

699
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:32,937
- Mold?

700
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,855
Really?

701
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,023
- Kind of tasted like basil.

702
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:40,695
- You know, Spago uses basil
in their Malaysian wings too.

703
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,363
- Hm.

704
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,032
- Is Spago a
Malaysian restaurant?

705
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,744
- You know exactly
what Spago is.

706
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,454
You didn't cook
all this, did you?

707
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,456
- I wanted to.

708
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,250
- That's something.

709
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,543
- What about dessert?

710
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,878
- Oh, dessert might happen.

711
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,129
We'll see.

712
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,215
- Okay. Well I brought
some Devil's Food cake.

713
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,550
You know, just in case.

714
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,551
- Just in case what?

715
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,386
- In case Jess forgot.

716
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,806
- But Devil's Food is
the most important part.

717
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,723
- Can we get back to the quiz?

718
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,599
I think I'm winning.

719
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,600
- We're not keeping score.

720
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,893
How could you be winning?

721
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,895
- The stuff you guys are saying.

722
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,064
- Your man wonders how
you look as a blonde.

723
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,900
Do you, A, wonder how
he'd look as a pot roast?

724
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,235
B, dye hair blonde?

725
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,737
C, dye all your hair blonde?

726
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,823
- Oh no, no burns.

727
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,241
- Pot roast takes too long.

728
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,617
Just shoot him.

729
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,744
- See, this is why I'm winning.

730
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,120
- You're not winning.

731
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,163
- You guys aren't even trying.

732
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,790
I always pick the best answers.

733
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,584
- I'm already a blonde
and it's not helping.

734
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,419
- You need a blonde
attitude, honey.

735
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,588
- I don't even know what that is

736
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,674
and already hate it.

737
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:46,010
- A blonde attitude is when
you don't care as much.

738
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,513
Like, what would you do

739
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,807
if somebody called
you by the wrong name?

740
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,100
- During sex?

741
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,268
- Well, duh.

742
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,811
When else would you
bother with names?

743
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,437
This one time, this clown
completely forgot my name.

744
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,522
And I just laughed at him.

745
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,815
- Do you remember his name?

746
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,649
- Of course not.

747
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,817
That's the point.

748
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,026
- You may not care about names,

749
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,529
but you do care about
men an awful lot.

750
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,989
- And so do you.

751
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,116
- I'm trying to get
my life started.

752
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,618
- Yeah. So some handsome
prince will come sweep you

753
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,121
off your feet and say, "How
bad are you, brainy wench?

754
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,123
You want to come and
help me rule my kingdom?"

755
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,374
- Guys, it doesn't matter

756
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,543
which one of you gets
hit on more or whatever.

757
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,628
You're both beautiful.

758
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,630
- Hang on, Candy.

759
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,883
You're the prettiest of all.

760
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,134
- No, I'm not.

761
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,302
- No, she's not.

762
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,806
- I mean, no thank you. I'm not.

763
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,224
Ow.

764
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,809
- No, I'm not...

765
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,145
I didn't mean that
you're not pretty.

766
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,188
- Then what did you mean?

767
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:42,066
- I just mean she's
not the prettiest.

768
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,651
- And you are?

769
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,653
- I go out way
more than you two.

770
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,488
- Ever work at Curvees.

771
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,240
- Is that an accomplishment?

772
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,658
- It kind of was for me.

773
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,411
- Jess, how good do
you look in tiny shorts

774
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,829
and clingy T-shirts?

775
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,331
- Pretty damn good.

776
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,665
It's just not my style.

777
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,585
- You guys, we're arguing about
which one of us is prettier.

778
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,003
How silly is that?

779
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,421
- Well, beauty is important.

780
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,881
Pretty people make more money.

781
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,425
And my salary
continues to accrue.

782
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,760
- Where do you work?

783
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,886
Grouchy Bird?

784
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,387
- Barking Parrot.

785
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,348
- And what does
Barking Parrot do?

786
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,892
- Development.

787
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,518
- Of what?

788
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,228
- Properties.

789
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,688
- Real estate?

790
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,690
- Some. I think.

791
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,900
- Real estate?

792
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,526
You never mentioned that before.

793
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,279
- I thought your company
did stuff for the movies.

794
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,530
- I know.

795
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,034
We develop literary
properties. I think.

796
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,370
- You write TV shows and stuff?

797
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,205
- No. No we don't write them.

798
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,540
We develop them. I think.

799
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,043
- What exactly do you do?

800
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,628
- Oh, I'm the receptionist.

801
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,879
I send emails.

802
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:45,880
I make phone calls.

803
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,714
I print stuff.

804
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,715
I'm very busy.

805
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,217
- And what do the emails say?

806
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,718
And the phone calls?

807
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:51,552
- Development.

808
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,056
Oh no. I know.

809
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,392
I know. We develop film.

810
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,226
- Right.

811
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,143
Movies.

812
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,645
- No, no, no, no.

813
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,939
We actually develop actual
film for the actual movies.

814
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,400
Like, like with
chemicals and stuff.

815
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,276
Oh this is going to help
me do my job better.

816
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,111
- Oh no.

817
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,745
(coughs)

818
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,083
(coughing)

819
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,087
All better.

820
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,591
(vomiting)

821
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,843
- Was it something you ate?

822
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,677
- Ew.

823
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,356
- I'll be fine in a second.

824
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:50,945
- Okay. Now back to me. I'm
a really good receptionist.

825
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,613
I'm, I'm really good at my job.

826
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,115
I make a lot of money.

827
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,367
And I'm so sick and tired
of people telling me

828
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,536
that I'm too stupid to
move up in the company.

829
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,872
I just don't want to move up.

830
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,291
- Can we focus on
Candy for a bit?

831
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,792
- Oh, yeah.

832
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,626
I can do that.

833
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,130
So, Candy,

834
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,300
your weight-

835
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,301
- Jessica!

836
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,136
- What? It's not about me.

837
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,804
I know this really great diet.

838
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,848
- There is nothing
wrong with her weight.

839
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,975
- There will be.

840
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,645
- Oh my God.

841
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,563
You're pregnant?

842
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,316
- She's not pregnant, silly.

843
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,026
She just has an eating disorder.

844
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,486
I know this really
great therapist.

845
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,987
- No, you guys.

846
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,322
I am pregnant.

847
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,242
- Who's the father?

848
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,160
- The father?

849
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,037
- I mean, usually there is one.

850
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:41,829
- Give her a break.

851
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,331
She obviously forgot.

852
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,665
- I didn't forget.

853
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,417
- Well have you at
least narrowed it down?

854
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,668
- Ew.

855
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,045
- Is it someone we
know? Is he cute?

856
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,421
- No, you guys.

857
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,339
(gasps)

858
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,381
- Oh my God. He's married.

859
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,216
- No.

860
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,009
- Oh.

861
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:58,179
Was it R-A-P-E?

862
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,680
- No, I wasn't raped.

863
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,682
You guys, I'm just pregnant.

864
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,017
- Honey, I'm so sorry.

865
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,102
- Sorry?

866
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,686
This cost me a bunch of money.

867
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,438
- And you're still pregnant?

868
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,858
I know this really
great abortionist.

869
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,860
- It's a test tube baby.

870
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,363
- Wait, you got insinuated?

871
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,864
- Inseminated.

872
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,199
- You went to one of
those sperm banks?

873
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,576
Do you know what kind
of perverts go to those?

874
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,538
- Healthy, educated perverts.

875
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,748
I hear some are homo sapiens

876
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,918
and a few practicing
heterosexuals.

877
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,211
- Yuck.

878
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,380
You let one of those
father your baby?

879
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,884
- Picking out the
father of your child

880
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,720
from just a photo
probably sounds crazy.

881
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,307
But nowadays women use phone
apps to find a boyfriend.

882
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,434
Have things really
changed that much?

883
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:52,400
- Ah yup. Yup. 1000 on
Jim Dandy and the fifth.

884
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,943
Thanks, Tony.

885
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,070
Hi. Welcome, Candy.

886
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,572
- Hi.

887
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,447
- Please sit.

888
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:02,076
So here is the catalog.

889
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,661
- [Candy] Oh, okay.

890
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,121
- Take a look.

891
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,455
See anything you like?

892
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,166
- It's kind of overwhelming.

893
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,500
- Ooh.

894
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,835
Have fun with it.

895
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,253
Like it's Christmas morning.

896
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,423
- Are any of these
guys serial killers?

897
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,674
- No.

898
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,758
No. We keep those
in another binder.

899
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,136
No I'm kidding.

900
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,807
We screen all our clients,
most of our clients.

901
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,350
But you got that in
the, in the pamphlet

902
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,019
that came in the mail.

903
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:28,936
- I'm just-

904
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,689
- A little nervous?

905
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,523
I understand.

906
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,443
Tell you what? Try this.

907
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,278
I want you to close your eyes.

908
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:42,283
Okay. Now you're you're in a
dark room and you hear a voice.

909
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,037
- Sweetheart, can we
get another pitcher

910
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,788
and an order of wings.

911
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,666
- No, not a, not a work voice.

912
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,710
This is the voice of your child.

913
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,962
Okay? Try to hear that voice.

914
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,882
Now. Try to see your child.

915
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,468
Can you see your child?

916
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:02,678
- Mm-hm.

917
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,512
- Okay.

918
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,972
Boy or girl?

919
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:05,848
- A little girl.

920
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,058
Hi, Beanie.

921
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,851
God, she's beautiful.

922
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,186
- Um, Beanie?

923
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,146
- Oh, that's what I'm
calling her right now.

924
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,397
Beanie Baby.

925
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,482
- Okay.

926
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,192
Well, now open your eyes.

927
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,820
Take a look at the
men in that book

928
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,490
and just choose the one
that reminds you of Beanie.

929
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,329
- Uh. Imagine picking a life
partner out of a catalog.

930
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,830
(laughs)

931
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,166
- Well, that's the good
thing about this process.

932
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,584
You don't have a life partner.

933
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,169
Just their sperm.

934
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,754
They won't break a date

935
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,507
or break your heart or
spend all your money.

936
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,008
(laughs)

937
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,844
It's just going to be you, and
their sperm, and Beanie Bag.

938
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,179
Erm, Beanie.

939
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,850
- Hey, can I get two donors
and mix them up in a test tube?

940
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,603
Kind of like a little sperm
competition for my eggs.

941
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,022
- Erm, why would
you want to do that?

942
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,108
- Hmm, they're just all so cute.

943
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,734
I can't pick.

944
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,236
- Hey.

945
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,070
Sure.

946
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,196
Why not?

947
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,030
I'll tell you what.

948
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,865
This week, for you,

949
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,535
all specimens are
Buy-One-Get-One-Half-Off.

950
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,538
Even throw you a little test
tube baby party if you want.

951
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,540
- Is your work guaranteed?

952
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,041
- If the process doesn't
work the first time,

953
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,710
we just keep trying.

954
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,878
In fact, we can try it today.

955
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,922
- Get pregnant today?

956
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,051
But I'm not dressed for it.

957
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,554
(lively music begins)

958
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,388
(phone rings)

959
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,597
- Uh, excuse me.

960
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,559
Hello? Bundles of Joy Labs.

961
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,811
We deliver so you can too.

962
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,812
Oh, Margaret.

963
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:35,646
How are you?

964
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,481
How are the twins?

965
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,316
Really?

966
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,234
Barking?

967
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,237
Hold on one second.

968
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,740
Just let me know when you
want to make your baby.

969
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,326
Both of them are barking?

970
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:55,082
- Okay. Just promise
me one thing.

971
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,584
If you ever find yourself

972
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,086
in a conversation like the
one you're about to hear,

973
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,254
shut it down,

974
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,007
call the police, order a pizza,

975
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,759
or just get the
hell out of there.

976
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,930
- I think having a child
on your own is wonderful.

977
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,806
- You do.

978
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,640
- You do?

979
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,850
- Don't you?

980
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,102
- Just buy a dog.

981
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,354
- When are you due?

982
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,605
- Six months.

983
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,482
- Okay. Well, we;ll have
to throw you a shower.

984
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,775
- No.

985
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,026
No, people will think
I've been abandoned

986
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,319
and feel sorry for me.

987
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,695
- I feel sorry for.

988
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,697
- No, we can put
on the invitation,

989
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,700
"This baby is actually wanted."

990
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,119
- You know, you deserve a party.

991
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,621
- Thank you, Jess.

992
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,955
- I mean your life
is about to be over.

993
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,999
So might as well laugh
it up while you can.

994
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,627
Forget about having a
penny to spend on yourself.

995
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,128
No free time.

996
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,671
And the only kind of guys
that are going to be into you

997
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,465
are the creepo fetish types.

998
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,509
- You think I haven't
thought of all that stuff?

999
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,552
- Well, are you ready for it?

1000
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,553
- No.

1001
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,388
- Will you be?

1002
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,306
- In six months?

1003
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,557
- Probably not.

1004
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,643
- Then what business
do you have doing it?

1005
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,812
- A baby is not a business.

1006
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,147
- Why don't you just
poke a hole in a condom?

1007
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,565
- Why don't you
just get married?

1008
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,984
- No, no. You two are
not going to make me

1009
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,403
feel bad about this.

1010
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,823
It's a good decision, and I'm
going to have a good baby.

1011
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,242
Did I say that right?

1012
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,414
- I'm going to
squeeze you to pieces.

1013
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:21,168
(gentle music continues)

1014
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,380
(giggles)

1015
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,589
- I could babysit.

1016
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,093
What?

1017
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,678
- Okay. You keep
her walking around

1018
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,096
while I call 911.

1019
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,348
- Obviously Friday
Saturday and Sunday nights

1020
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,766
are out of the question.

1021
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,352
- Okay, she's coming out of it.

1022
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,604
- I don't hear you
offering to babysit.

1023
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,024
- I could.

1024
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,526
- You two would do that for me?

1025
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:50,030
- The three of us could raise
a baby better than any couple.

1026
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,201
- I only offered to babysit.

1027
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,536
- No. Think about it.

1028
00:40:56,704 --> 00:41:00,040
Together we make
up the ideal woman.

1029
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,712
Beauty, brains and personality.

1030
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:08,215
- An ideal woman is only
made up of three things?

1031
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,467
- I get it.

1032
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,135
Each of our strengths
fills in the weakness

1033
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,263
of the other two. Like the
three witches and Macbeth.

1034
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,390
- I don't see foreign films.

1035
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,600
Anyway, what's so
good about a witch?

1036
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,268
They have bad skin
and facial hair.

1037
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:22,563
- They're strong, smart, in
control their own destiny.

1038
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,900
- Yeah, yeah. Look,
Lynette is the brains,

1039
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,985
you're the personality,

1040
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,278
and I'm the beauty.

1041
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,410
- I'm going to start
cleaning up the dishes now.

1042
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,829
- Don't leave me alone with her.

1043
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,625
- What? It's not like
I'm saying something bad.

1044
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,792
Candy has personality.

1045
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,294
Everybody loves her.

1046
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:48,255
And you, your school
thing. You're all smart me.

1047
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:53,260
- Me, I get complimented
a lot, and noticed a lot,

1048
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,180
hit on a lot.

1049
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,432
- Doesn't mean anything.

1050
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,434
- I get laid, okay?

1051
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,602
A lot.

1052
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,021
Whenever I want.
By whoever I want.

1053
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:07,775
And meanwhile, you study
and Candy knits, I guess.

1054
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,193
- That doesn't mean that you're-

1055
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,861
- Let's change the subject.

1056
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,780
- I'm sorry.

1057
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,614
I don't know what to say.

1058
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,282
I'm so upset right now.

1059
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,202
- You don't really mean
all this, do you, Jess?

1060
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,119
- Sure I do.

1061
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,329
- [Lynette] Oh my God.

1062
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,497
It's like a monkey
playing with dynamite.

1063
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,790
- It's a compliment!

1064
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,458
- What? Saying that
you're prettier than us.

1065
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,668
That's a compliment?

1066
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,796
- No, I'm saying that
you're smarter than us

1067
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:32,299
and that Candy has more
personality than us.

1068
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,302
- But you don't care about
brains or personality.

1069
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,804
- Oh, obviously I
don't need them.

1070
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,138
But where would you two be?

1071
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:46,981
Candy, you told us that
you teach stuff at the "Y".

1072
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,192
And there's things on your
wall that you knitted.

1073
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,152
That's insane.

1074
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,697
And now with your
whole baby thing,

1075
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,157
if you want a guy
that wants children,

1076
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,701
you just show him yours.

1077
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:03,581
And Lynette, you
want a smart guy.

1078
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,583
Where else are you
going to find one

1079
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:09,003
than at a college
for smart people?

1080
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,171
- Brains aren't everything.

1081
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,673
- If you really thought that

1082
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,508
then why didn't you marry
Billy from the hardware store?

1083
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,426
- Bobby.

1084
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,511
Because I didn't want to.

1085
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,514
- No, because he worked
at a dumb hardware store.

1086
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,683
- No, because he
called himself Bobby.

1087
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,019
- Oh, you thought
it was a cute name.

1088
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,687
(sighs)

1089
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,856
- What kind of man
do you want, Jess?

1090
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,357
- Rich. What else?

1091
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:33,902
- Then why do you only
date gorgeous men?

1092
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,779
- Oh, the gorgeous are much
more likely to be rich.

1093
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,031
Ask Darwin.

1094
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,199
- I actually heard
that on the news.

1095
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,577
- Also, more of us are famous.

1096
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,245
- Us?

1097
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,372
Us gorgeous people?

1098
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,540
- Okay.

1099
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,708
We.

1100
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,959
We gorgeous people.

1101
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,210
Are you satisfied?

1102
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,962
- Not until you apologize.

1103
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,380
- For what?

1104
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,548
- Saying we're ugly.

1105
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,716
(beeping)

1106
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,925
- Oh my God. What's that?

1107
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,889
- Don't you know?
It's your kitchen.

1108
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,102
- [Lynette] Something
in your oven is on fire!

1109
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,396
- Oh. That? Don't
worry about that.

1110
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,569
(coughing)

1111
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:17,905
What are you doing?

1112
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:20,824
- I'm going to go.

1113
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,576
- What's this?

1114
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,244
- Nothing.

1115
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,079
- Jess,

1116
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:27,831
did you us a-

1117
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,666
- No!

1118
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,917
Are you kidding?

1119
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,418
I don't even know
where that came from.

1120
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:34,421
- Okay. Well tell Lynnie
I'm sorry but I gotta go.

1121
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,507
Tell her to call me later.

1122
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,676
(beeping)

1123
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,521
(coughing)

1124
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,855
- What did you burn?

1125
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,942
- Nothing. It's nothing.

1126
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,944
Leave it alone.

1127
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,320
Candy left.

1128
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,279
- What did she say?

1129
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,950
- She said that she wanted
to leave before you got back.

1130
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,202
- Oh God.

1131
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,287
Should I call her?

1132
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:10,791
- No. You should
probably leave too.

1133
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,877
(soft music continues)

1134
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,045
- Okay. Fine.

1135
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,464
Good night.

1136
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:20,718
(soft music continues)

1137
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,140
- Thank you for
ruining everything!

1138
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,647
- Lynette and Candy
stayed busy, of course.

1139
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,149
They lived in an exciting city,

1140
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,484
and they found lots of
new ways to explore it.

1141
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,321
But sometimes is it just
more fun with three?

1142
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,699
I don't know.

1143
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,869
(lively music begins)

1144
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,253
- [Stroman] That's
a terrific title

1145
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,629
for your dissertation, Lynette.

1146
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,463
- [Lynette] Yay.

1147
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,299
- But you were finished.

1148
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,926
What made you
suddenly change it?

1149
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,177
- You said yourself

1150
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,263
that the original title
lacked a point of view.

1151
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,932
- Yeah. You, you went from a

1152
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,435
"Classical Versus Modern
Perceptions of Femininity"

1153
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,688
to "Why Beauty Kills".

1154
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,774
Definitely have a
point of view now.

1155
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,651
- Somethings that
have happened recently

1156
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,445
gave me a new passion
for the topic.

1157
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:46,780
- Oh, I know.

1158
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,533
- You know what?

1159
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,618
- Oh, I figured something
must have happened.

1160
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:54,329
You missed your last
three therapy sessions.

1161
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,706
- I know, Dr.
Stroman. I'm so sorry.

1162
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,792
I've just been working
so hard on this.

1163
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,128
- No. It's okay. It paid off.

1164
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,462
It's a good read.

1165
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,297
It's riveting.

1166
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,131
- Really?

1167
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,299
- Mm-hm.

1168
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,675
I didn't think
you had it in you.

1169
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,176
- You didn't?

1170
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,637
- Oh, well maybe that wasn't
the best choice of words. But-

1171
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,390
- No one's ever called my
writing riveting before.

1172
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,183
- You're still
missing one thing.

1173
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,519
- I followed all the
guidelines to the letter-

1174
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,896
- You are missing, Lynette.

1175
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,899
True.

1176
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,901
There's more of you in this
draft in another drafts,

1177
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,986
but you don't have a
lot of skin in the game.

1178
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,238
- What do you mean?

1179
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,658
- "Why Beauty Kills"? Right?

1180
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:37,205
"Perceptions of beauty have
varied widely throughout history

1181
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:39,750
and have served to maintain
a lowered social status

1182
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,836
among certain groups of women
who were blah blah blah blah."

1183
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:43,879
- But it's all true.

1184
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,005
- Blah blah blah.

1185
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:45,839
- That's all true!

1186
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,007
- I know that.

1187
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,550
I'm quite certain
that every fact,

1188
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,928
and every figure, and every
graph, and chart, and quote,

1189
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,347
and cross-reference
is beyond reproach.

1190
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,848
- Yes. Thank you.

1191
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,934
- But you need to
do one more thing.

1192
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:57,768
- Okay.

1193
00:48:58,685 --> 00:48:59,519
What?

1194
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,522
- I haven't the slightest.

1195
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,027
This topic isn't about me.

1196
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,529
Beauty doesn't kill men.

1197
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:15,369
As a whole, this is not what
resonates in a man's gut.

1198
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,872
- I know. I just wish
you guys understood.

1199
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,958
It's so hard to
make men understand

1200
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,084
what it's like to actually be-

1201
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,293
- [Stroman] Make us understand!

1202
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,753
Show us.

1203
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:28,048
Do something that scares
you and then write about it.

1204
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,716
- Something that scares me?

1205
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,718
- I don't mean
anything dangerous.

1206
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,220
- So what?

1207
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,806
Like, enter a tacky beauty
pageant or something?

1208
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:37,766
- Sure. Why not?

1209
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,393
I think that might take too long

1210
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,061
but you're on the right road.

1211
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,729
- A wet T-shirt contest?

1212
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:45,148
No, I wouldn't win. Nevermind.

1213
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,944
- I'm not going to advise
you to do that, okay?

1214
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,737
- Get my picture taken?

1215
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,322
- Exactly.

1216
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,573
Pose for a photographer.

1217
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,743
You don't have to
spend a lot of money.

1218
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,829
- Actually I know a guy.

1219
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:03,083
(gentle music begins)

1220
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,673
- You must be Lynette.

1221
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:13,010
- And you must be stunning.

1222
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:13,927
- I'm Gianna,

1223
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,178
Ron's assistant.

1224
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,471
I'll be helping you today.

1225
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:19,599
- Um. I tried to
take a crack at it

1226
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,851
as you can see.

1227
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,439
- Oh, aren't you adventurous?

1228
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,358
- If anyone should be in
front of the camera, it's you.

1229
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,610
- Lindsey!

1230
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,989
(gentle music continues)

1231
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,044
- Lynette!

1232
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,045
So glad you made it.

1233
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,630
What made you change your mind?

1234
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,803
- I still might change it.

1235
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,806
- Whatever you're
most comfortable with.

1236
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:01,975
- These.

1237
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,019
I'm comfortable with these.

1238
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,729
- Outfits!

1239
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:06,521
Great.

1240
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,317
Show me what you got.

1241
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,860
- Okay. So I've got brown.

1242
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,154
I've got reddish
brown, brownish red,

1243
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,655
beige, I have brown.

1244
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:16,990
I have reddish browns. I have-

1245
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,493
- Nah, nah. I don't see
those colors in you.

1246
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,702
- I could be gray.

1247
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,329
You never answered my question.

1248
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,163
- Oh.

1249
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:23,997
No tattoos.

1250
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,499
I never had the guts.

1251
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,666
- Not that.

1252
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,668
What made you change your mind?

1253
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,171
- About coming here?

1254
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,673
- I asked you, I don't
know how many times.

1255
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,050
And you've always told me no.

1256
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,677
And suddenly here you are.

1257
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,678
- There I am.

1258
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,514
Here I are. Am.

1259
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,348
Yes.

1260
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,100
So blue.

1261
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,392
I like blue.

1262
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,853
- Blue would look
very nice on you.

1263
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,772
- Or off of me.

1264
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,524
- When I first saw you,

1265
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,527
I thought, "I gotta
get this girl on film."

1266
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,277
- Oh.

1267
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,696
- But there's no rush.

1268
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,698
We don't even have to do this.

1269
00:51:58,698 --> 00:51:59,699
- Do what?

1270
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:00,700
- Go all the way.

1271
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,872
- If you want it, you
can keep your clothes on.

1272
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,418
- What if I don't want?

1273
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,295
- Gi.

1274
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,634
I'm going to load up my gear.

1275
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:24,724
- So Lynette, let's start
with shades of blue.

1276
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,145
- Load up his gear?

1277
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,564
- Put film in his camera.

1278
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,734
- Or?

1279
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:37,279
- Put batteries in
his flash units.

1280
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,113
- Or?

1281
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,240
- That's all I got.

1282
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:42,784
Don't worry.

1283
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,661
He already has a girlfriend.

1284
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,746
- Of course. Of course
he does. Naturally.

1285
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,500
What's her name?

1286
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,336
- Um, Jocelyn, I think.

1287
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:55,964
- Jessica?

1288
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,174
- Jessica, that's it.

1289
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:03,847
You know, people usually
pay him for a session.

1290
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:05,765
- They do?

1291
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:08,268
- And his fees are insane.

1292
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,520
So if he's paying you-

1293
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,439
- He's out of his mind.

1294
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,025
- It means he thinks
you're spectacular.

1295
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,779
- I was always afraid of blue.

1296
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,114
- Really?

1297
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,616
I think it looks great on you.

1298
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:27,662
- Do you love her cheekbones?

1299
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:28,496
- Yes.

1300
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,210
(camera shutters)

1301
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,295
(gentle music continues)

1302
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,463
(camera shutters)

1303
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,798
- So (clears throat)
how's Jessica?

1304
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,384
(camera shutters)

1305
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,469
- She makes me laugh.

1306
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,638
- That's one of her talents.

1307
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,057
(camera shutters)

1308
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,475
- Is it true that one time

1309
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,810
you let her use your
apartment for a date with me?

1310
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,313
- Oh my God.

1311
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,857
You saw my hideous apartment?
And you were still with her?

1312
00:53:55,857 --> 00:54:00,320
- I loved the apartment, but
I knew she didn't live there.

1313
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:02,822
(camera shutters)

1314
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,324
- What gave it away?

1315
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,326
- She picked up a recorder
and held it like this.

1316
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,248
And she didn't even
know what it was called.

1317
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:15,418
And then she couldn't identify
anything in her apartment.

1318
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,420
- She's got
different priorities.

1319
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:23,343
- I heard about the breakup.
You three. I'm sorry.

1320
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,928
- Oh, I hope you don't think

1321
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,513
this is some sort
of revenge thing

1322
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,098
because that's not.
That's not why-

1323
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:28,932
- [Ron] No.

1324
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:29,766
- [Lynette] Because-

1325
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,600
- I know.

1326
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,353
I don't even have to tell
her about the session

1327
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,521
if you don't want me to.

1328
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,858
(gentle music continues)

1329
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,569
Oh.

1330
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:42,404
Stunning.

1331
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,408
(camera shutters)

1332
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,451
(camera shutters)

1333
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,370
- You look phenomenal, Lynette.

1334
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,540
- I call this look
"Noble Regret".

1335
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,796
Let's get down to
business, shall we?

1336
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,221
(camera shutters)

1337
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,645
(phone ringing)

1338
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,480
- Barking Parrot Development,

1339
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,398
this is Jessica speaking.

1340
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,566
How may I direct your call?

1341
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,613
Mr. Carlyle? I have
Mr. Ashton for you.

1342
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:35,081
(tense music begins)

1343
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:38,251
(keyboard clicking)

1344
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,853
(phone beeping)

1345
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,938
(phone dialing)

1346
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,648
- [Voicemail] Hi.

1347
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,610

(sighs)

1352
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,502
(soft music begins)

1353
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,796
- Oh my God, she'll love that.

1354
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:23,713
- Really?

1355
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,131
- No, that's really great.

1356
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,132
- I don't know. I don't think
it's, like, symmetrical.

1357
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,634
- I love what you're doing here.

1358
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:28,468
- Are you sure?

1359
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:29,302
- That's beautiful.

1360
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,136
- I feel like.

1361
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:30,970
- Aw.

1362
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:34,474
(gentle music continues)

1363
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,647

1364
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,235
(phone dialing)

1365
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,488
(answering machine
speaks indistinctly)

1366
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,031
- [Ron] Hey Jess,
just a quick message

1367
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:52,826
to tell you how happy
you made me last night.

1368
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,161
I can't wait to see you.

1369
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:55,995
I love you.

1370
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:59,207
(slow music continues)

1371
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:21,354
(phone beeping)

1372
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:22,939
(phone dialing)

1373
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,441
- [Voicemail] Hi.

00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,193
- [Answering Machine]
No new messages.

1375
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,528
No new messages.

1376
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:30,947
No new mess-

1377
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,581
- In spite of all
the new traditions

1378
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,041
that Lynette and Candy
were inventing together,

1379
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,710
they still missed an old one.

1380
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,211
So about six months later

1381
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,797
they revived their
monthly dinner party.

1382
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,383
But with seating only for two.

1383
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:53,803
(gentle music continues)

1384
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,224
(doorbell rings)

1385
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,603
- Look at you.

1386
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,896
My God.

1387
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:05,482
- Oh.

1388
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,733
- Oh.

1389
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,443
I'm offering wine
to a pregnant woman.

1390
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,903
I'm so sorry.

1391
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,739
- Oh my gosh. I
love your outfit.

1392
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,074
You PhDs are smart dressers.

1393
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,910
- Oh, dinner smells great.

1394
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:21,915
- Well cooking for three, uh,
two is much more fun than one.

1395
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,335
- And it's not like you're
cooking a bunch of food to eat

1396
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,004
for lunch all week out of
those Tupperware thingies.

1397
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:28,922
- I hate that.

1398
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:30,632
- Do you miss her?

1399
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,633
- Who, Jess?

1400
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,092
Of course not.

1401
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:36,012
I mean, sure I wonder how she's
doing, but I don't miss her.

1402
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,639
- Yeah.

1403
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,598
- Do you miss her?

1404
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:39,599
- Me? No.

1405
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,644
Except sometimes.

1406
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,478
- Yeah.

1407
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,812
Sometimes.

1408
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:45,939
Excuse me a second, hon.

1409
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:46,773
- Yeah.

1410
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,660
(phone beeping)

1411
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,203
(phone dialing)

1412
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,704
- [Answering Machine]
You have no messages.

1413
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,039
Thank you for your call.

1414
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,873
Goodbye.

1415
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,212
(sighs)

1416
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,172
- So you have
another month still?

1417
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,632
- Two weeks.

1418
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,342
So you guys won't have to
rush me to the hospital guys.

1419
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,718
- Us guys?

1420
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:18,304
- You. You won't
have to rush me.

1421
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,306
(phone ringing)

1422
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,140
- Oh, I'll get it.

1423
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:21,975
Something in the oven?

1424
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,059
- Just the chicken.

1425
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:23,893
- Okay.

1426
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:26,854
(gentle music begins)

1427
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:29,649

1428
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,318
(phone dialing)

1429
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,697
- [Jessica] Hi. If you're
male and you're cute,

1430
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,991
and you're looking for
Jess, you may be in luck.

1431
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,536
- Oh, were you calling somebody?

1432
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,662
- No.

1433
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,496
Maybe.

1434
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,330
No.

1435
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,670
- Why is there all
this extra food?

1436
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,048
- Don't you sometimes wish

1437
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:56,009
she would just call
up and apologize?

1438
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,178
(laughs)

1439
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,182
- It's been six months.

1440
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,852
Do you think she misses us?

1441
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,022
- I thought I was the naive one.

1442
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,193
- Did you like
all our sex talks?

1443
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,695
- Jess sure did.

1444
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:19,073
- Mm. But did we ever talk
about, like, love and marriage?

1445
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:22,535
- We tried. But it always
turned back to sex.

1446
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,370
- Should we go to a nightclub?

1447
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,539
- I don't actually
enjoy nightclubs.

1448
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,875
And I don't think
Beanie would either.

1449
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:30,960
(siren wailing)

1450
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,878
- Ooh.

1451
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:32,712
I think that's mine.

1452
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:33,796
I'll be right back.

1453
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,551
(siren wailing)

1454
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:41,721
(gentle music begins)

1455
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,228
(phone beeping)

1456
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,898
(phone dialing)

1457
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,275
- [Jessica] You've reached
the desk of Jessica Marshall

1458
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,818
at Barking Parrot Development.

1459
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:56,611
I'm either on-

1460
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,950
- You called Jess, didn't you?

1461
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:05,912
- So did you.

1462
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:07,580
- No, I didn't.

1463
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,635
- I kind of miss her.

1464
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,929
- After what she said to us?

1465
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,931
- Damn it, Lynnie.
She was right.

1466
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,141
- That she's Miss
Beauty, I'm Miss Brains,

1467
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:28,935
and you are Miss Personality?

1468
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,353
- She is a beauty.

1469
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,270
- So are you.

1470
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,271
- And so are you.

1471
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,106
- No I'm not.

1472
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,357
- And no I'm not.

1473
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,650
So we agree with
Jess on that point.

1474
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,027
- What?

1475
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,196
- I think that she's
beautiful and I'm not.

1476
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,365
You think that she's
beautiful and you're not.

1477
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,991
And she thinks that
she's beautiful-

1478
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,660
- And we're not.

1479
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,453
- She's not allowed
to think that?

1480
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,288
- She can't just say it.

1481
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:50,707
- Anyway, three
votes for Jessica,

1482
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,958
one for you and one for me.

1483
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,126
So she's right on that one.

1484
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,127
- [Lynnie] But-

1485
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,795
- Item number two: your brains.

1486
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,296
- We all have brains.

1487
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,132
- But only one of us has a PhD.

1488
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,216
So she's right again.

1489
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,801
- Candy, come on.

1490
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,970
- Sometimes people tell me
I have a nice personality.

1491
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,638
- You have a
wonderful personality.

1492
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,140
- So Jess got all three right.

1493
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,809
And if she didn't, we share
are acting like she did.

1494
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,644
- God, we are.

1495
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,146
- Another thing.

1496
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,647
Did you see what she burned
in her oven that night?

1497
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:16,357
- No, but it sure stank.

1498
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:17,900
Like, sickly sweet.

1499
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,902
- Like burned Devil's Food cake.

1500
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:24,323
She baked us a cake.
Tried to. And failed.

1501
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:25,491
- That was stupid.

1502
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:26,743
She doesn't know how to bake.

1503
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,411
- Trying something
new is stupid?

1504
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,662
Really, Lynette?

1505
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:31,164
- She lied to us
about all that food

1506
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,166
she cooked that night. Remember?

1507
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,709
All the food from
the restaurant.

1508
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,210
She shouldn't have
lied to us like that.

1509
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,503
That really hurts,

1510
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:38,671
being lied to.

1511
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:41,007
- Failing can hurt too.

1512
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,842
I want to send her a fax.

1513
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:43,843
- Wait, are you sure?

1514
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:48,014
- Dear Jessica.

1515
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,767
- Should we say "Dear Jessica"?

1516
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,851
- Jessica dearest.

1517
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:54,937
O Jessica.

1518
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,105
- Like a prayer?

1519
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,440
- Like a poem.

1520
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,233
- She'll think we're
praying to her.

1521
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:00,860
Say Jessica. No "Dear".

1522
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:05,782
Okay. What do we have so far?

1523
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,743
- Jessica.

1524
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:12,872
- Jessica, we wish to
speak with you. Comply.

1525
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,085
- How about "We need
to speak with you."?

1526
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:19,712
- I don't need
anything from her.

1527
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,215
- I'm going to go see her.

1528
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,716
- Are you crazy?

1529
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:26,219
- This note is inviting her
to come see us, I think.

1530
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,386
- Yes.

1531
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,764
Someday. In a
controlled environment.

1532
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:30,932
- I'll bring her back here.

1533
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,141
All the control you want.

1534
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,310
- Okay. Just try this.

1535
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,979
"Jessica, please meet with us

1536
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,440
before our lives
continue too far

1537
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,068
down separate and
disparate paths."

1538
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,570
- Don't separate and
disparate mean the same thing?

1539
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,239
- Disparate means dissimilar.

1540
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,825
And separate means not touching.

1541
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:49,909
- Does Jess know that?

1542
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,328
- She went to college.

1543
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,329
Occasionally.

1544
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,331
(giggling)

1545
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,916
- Should we send it to her work?

1546
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,251
- She has a car fax.

1547
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,839
(sighs)

1548
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:07,927
- This is good.

1549
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,303
Maybe in a few months
we'll be back together

1550
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,596
having our monthly dinner.

1551
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,181
- Taking our monthly picture.

1552
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,433
- Eating our monthly
Devil's Food cake.

1553
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,603
Jess will make some
thoughtless comment.

1554
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,522
- And we'll be
ready to kill her.

1555
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:21,274
- Oh my God.

1556
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,108
- Did we get it?

1557
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:22,984
- A piece is missing.

1558
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:23,776
- Was there anything on it?

1559
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:25,152
- Just one word.

1560
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:25,987
- Which word?

1561
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,698
- Disparate.

1562
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,532
- Uh-oh.

1563
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,492
- Hey, you two!

1564
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:34,620
I was just in the neighborhood
and I got your fax.

1565
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,122
Isn't that wild?

1566
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,123
What fax?

1567
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,291
- You're so cute.

1568
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,959
The one where you
said you're desperate.

1569
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:40,793
- Disparate.

1570
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:41,836
- Exactly.

1571
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,796
- Disparate means different.

1572
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,298
- Oh, I sure hope
you feel different.

1573
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,174
You were so weird
last time I saw you.

1574
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,009
- No.

1575
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,135
Unrelated.

1576
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,511
- But we're friends,

1577
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:52,388
so we are related like family.

1578
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,806
- Distinct.

1579
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:54,682
- Oh, our love is so strong

1580
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:55,892
it will never go distinct.

1581
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,351
- No, it means that-

1582
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:58,728
- Anyway, none of that matters

1583
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,397
because I totally forgive you.

1584
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,648
- For what?

1585
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:03,858
- For all the mean
things you said.

1586
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,151
- What?

1587
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:08,905
- All I remember is we
were having a nice talk

1588
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,865
and suddenly you were furious.

1589
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,075
- You insulted us.

1590
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,577
- Oh, you mean my little comment

1591
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,662
about beauty, brains
and personality?

1592
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:17,496
- See, Lynette.

1593
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:18,706
She didn't even mean it.

1594
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,541
- Oh, I meant it, but-

1595
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:21,834
- We didn't send anything.

1596
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,503
That was a mistake.

1597
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,341
- Desperate.

1598
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,509
So dramatic. Who knows what
you two are capable of?

1599
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:33,054
- So what were you doing
in the neighborhood, Jess?

1600
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:36,515
- I was going to
the post office.

1601
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:38,559
- It closes at 5:00.

1602
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,353
- Well, there's this really
cute little dress shop.

1603
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,104
You know, it's just
around the corner.

1604
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,022
- [Candy] I know the shop.

1605
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:43,856
- It's closed.

1606
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,193
What were you doing in
Candy's neighborhood?

1607
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:51,364
- I was headed to...

1608
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,368
(sighs)

1609
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,202
Okay.

1610
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,703
I'm really sorry

1611
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:00,373
that I said you have a
fabulous personality.

1612
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,962
And I'm really sorry that
I said you're a genius.

1613
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:09,215
- How about sorry for saying,
"You two aren't beautiful."?

1614
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,883
- I never said that.

1615
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:12,093
- You said-

1616
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,762
- I said that out
of the three of us,

1617
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:17,098
I am the most beautiful.

1618
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,766
- And you agree, Lynnie.

1619
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,893
- I agree that Jess is
more beautiful than me

1620
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:24,271
but I do not agree that she
is more beautiful than Candy.

1621
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:27,066
- Lynette, if I agree
with you, Jess hates me.

1622
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:29,235
And Jess, if I agree with
you, Lynette hates me.

1623
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,820
So I'm not gonna say anything.

1624
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,780
- She hurt you just
as bad as she hurt me.

1625
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,741
- Oh. I don't even remember.

1626
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,493
- But you guys, I have proof.

1627
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,786
- Proof that you're beautiful?

1628
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:39,662
- Yes!

1629
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:41,831
- I remember now.

1630
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:42,665
- Mm-hm.

1631
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,417
Okay. I have proof too.

1632
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,085
What does proof prove?

1633
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,254
- What's your proof?

1634
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,296
- Well, look at her.

1635
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:52,341
- She looks like always.

1636
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,300
Who are you wearing anyway?

1637
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,343
Laura Ashley?

1638
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:59,265
I, on the other hand, have this.

1639
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,101
- Oh my God, Jess.

1640
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:03,853
It's a boulder.

1641
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:04,770
- Is that from Ron?

1642
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,273
- Wait, you know Ron?

1643
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,941
- You and I met
him the same night.

1644
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:11,110
- He lets you call him Ron?

1645
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,695
Did you sleep with him?

1646
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,821
- No.

1647
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,031
No.

1648
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,616
- Then why does he
let you call him Ron?

1649
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:21,787
- We talk sometimes
about photography.

1650
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:24,957
- Wait, who's Ron?

1651
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:25,958
- Oh, he's my dude.

1652
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,168
My man.

1653
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,045
He's like this rich
and famous photog.

1654
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:29,879
- Well what did he take?

1655
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,630
Like nature pictures?

1656
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,299
- They're natural all right.

1657
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,633
Very beautiful.

1658
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:38,971
- Wait, did he take
pictures of you?

1659
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,139
- A couple.

1660
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,849
- How could you afford him?

1661
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:44,560
- What did you mean by natural?

1662
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,145
- I think you know what I mean.

1663
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:49,482
- You posed naked?

1664
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,486
- What did he do when
you started tearing
off your clothes?

1665
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,154
- He brought it up at the party

1666
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:57,490
and I was curious.

1667
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,824
- Curious?

1668
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,327
Like sexy French
coming-of-age movie curious?

1669
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,330
- I thought you don't
watch foreign films.

1670
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,332
- Oh, French isn't
foreign. It's trendy.

1671
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,249
- Why didn't you tell me

1672
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,709
somebody asked you to pose nude?

1673
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:10,169
- I thought maybe he was drunk.

1674
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:11,879
And no sex was involved.

1675
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,715
I just wanted to feel sexy.

1676
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:18,177
I've been celibate
for three years.

1677
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:21,013
- You told us you
were abstaining.

1678
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:23,849
- Don't you two ever
wanna feel sexy?

1679
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:25,684
- Oh, I am sexy.

1680
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:27,561
- I always feel cutesy.

1681
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:29,688
Anyways, Lynette, I'm shocked.

1682
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:31,232
- They're beautiful pictures.

1683
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,859
- You were so critical
of my job at Curvees

1684
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:36,695
and then you just go and
bare it all for the camera.

1685
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:37,780
- Yeah!

1686
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,573
- I didn't criticize you.

1687
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:41,075
- You said I look
good in tiny shorts

1688
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,535
and a clingy a T-shirt.

1689
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,036
- That's criticism?

1690
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:45,246
- Of course it is.

1691
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:48,374
Candy, she's hard on me too.

1692
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:49,375
- Sure it was critical

1693
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,209
coming from.

1694
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:52,753
- Wanna see them?

1695
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:53,963
- The pictures?

1696
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,257
- He gave me a whole
set. Wanna see?

1697
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:57,716
- Absolutely not!

1698
01:08:57,716 --> 01:08:58,884
That's disgusting.

1699
01:08:58,884 --> 01:08:59,718
- Sure.

1700
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,646
- Lynette, I can't believe
you sold out like that.

1701
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,983
- Oh, I love this one
with the red scarf.

1702
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,651
- I went a little wild there.

1703
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,113
- Lynnie, these are gorgeous.

1704
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:21,824
And the lighting, it's like
straight out of a magazine.

1705
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,617
- Can I have some copies so
I can send them to your mom?

1706
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:24,910
- She already has a set.

1707
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:27,580
Look at these stuffed animals.

1708
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,789
- Oh my God.

1709
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,749
- Your dad is going to
have a heart attack.

1710
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:34,253
- I got asked to pose for the
"Girls of Curvees" calendar.

1711
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:36,422
But I said no.

1712
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,174
- No, you should have done it.

1713
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,925
- Six months ago you
wouldn't have said that.

1714
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:41,427
- Yeah!

1715
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:42,595
- Probably not.

1716
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,597
- What? Now that
you're all Miss Nude

1717
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,849
you're like everyone
take it off.

1718
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,267
- When did you try out?

1719
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,685
- About a month ago.

1720
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:52,146
I sent them some
pre-pregnancy swimsuit photos

1721
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:55,649
and they made me an offer
but I turned them down.

1722
01:09:55,649 --> 01:09:56,817
I thought you'd be proud.

1723
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:59,612
- Wait, you got an offer to pose

1724
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,614
for the "Girls of
Curvees" calendar?

1725
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:02,948
- Of course she did.

1726
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:04,283
- But you're pregnant!

1727
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,784
- I won't always be.

1728
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:06,869
- You look too young.

1729
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:07,953
- That's a bad thing?

1730
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:11,040
I am proud of you, honey.

1731
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,292
- I can't believe you
both got asked to pose.

1732
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,339
- What girl doesn't like
to have her picture taken?

1733
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:21,008
It's natural to want
to feel beautiful.

1734
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:22,301
But Candy was too smart

1735
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,470
to let anyone take
advantage of her.

1736
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,143
(knocking)

1737
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:34,647
- Miss Waterman?

1738
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,857
- How do you do, Mr. Weems?

1739
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:38,901
(laughs)

1740
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,987
Oh, I was told the company
was okay with my pregnancy.

1741
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:43,364
- Uh.

1742
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:45,157
Yeah. As long as you get
back to that nice trim figure

1743
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:46,992
we saw in your test photos.

1744
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:47,826
- Of course.

1745
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,416
- So, have you
signed the agreement?

1746
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,877
- I'm curious about
the word repurposing.

1747
01:10:56,877 --> 01:10:58,837
- Oh, that's just
a technical term.

1748
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:00,756
Nothing to worry about.

1749
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:03,592
- This agreement would allow
the company to reuse my photos?

1750
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:07,012
- Well, yes, but we
almost never do that.

1751
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:10,224
Our customers prefer
fresh girls each year.

1752
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,685
- I understand you also put out

1753
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,353
Wild Animals magazine, right?

1754
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,521
- Yes.

1755
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:18,440
- So my photos could
end up in Wild Animals?

1756
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,277
(laughs)

1757
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:24,530
- Wild Animals fans
prefer nude models.

1758
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,365
- Do you ever retouch photos?

1759
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:27,574
- Yes, of course.

1760
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:30,619
If perfection is within
reach, why not read it?

1761
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,747
- So my face could end up
on the body of a naked girl?

1762
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:37,876
- Yes, but Miss Waterman,
it would be much cheaper

1763
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:41,547
to hire a nude model than
to retouch it on a computer.

1764
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:44,049
- Unless the girl the
fans like got popular

1765
01:11:44,049 --> 01:11:46,218
and more expensive than
when she first posts.

1766
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:47,886
- Mm Hmm.

1767
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:50,055
That's a little presumptuous.

1768
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:51,724
- Now, on page two,

1769
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:54,310
there were a couple of terms
that were a little vague.

1770
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,316
Well, I didn't actually
go through with it.

1771
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,567
- Why didn't you?

1772
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,611
- I read the contract.
Way too exploitive.

1773
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:08,157
- Yes. You'd be exploited
as a sex object.

1774
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,409
- No, I'd be
exploited as a fool.

1775
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,494
For starters, they'd be
able to use my picture

1776
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:14,830
over and over again
for a one-time fee.

1777
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,248
- What more do you want?

1778
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:17,666
- Residuals.

1779
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:20,336
Additional payments for
repurposing in other media.

1780
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,755
Restrictions on
alterations and retouching.

1781
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,631
Throughout the
universe in perpetuity.

1782
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:26,008
And 10 free copies.

1783
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:28,927
- You know all those big words?

1784
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,430
- With that contract
they'd be able to use me

1785
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:34,183
in a video, on the
internet, even slap my face

1786
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,602
on some other girl's
body for one low fee.

1787
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:39,980
- Wow. I hardly
read my contract.

1788
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:42,858
- You're both such hypocrites.

1789
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,027
All your talk about feminism

1790
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,029
and all your crap
you heaped on me

1791
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,531
because I'm supposedly
promiscuous.

1792
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:52,201
- [Both] You are promiscuous.

1793
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,286
- Both of you would sell
your looks for money.

1794
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:55,621
- I said no to the calendar.

1795
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,623
- That's because it
didn't pay you enough,

1796
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:00,000
not because you
thought it was wrong.

1797
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,794
- Not paying enough is wrong.

1798
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:05,506
But they were so impressed

1799
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:07,633
with my reasons for
not doing the calendar.

1800
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:10,344
And they offered me a
job in Curvees corporate

1801
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,638
as a legal secretary.

1802
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:14,640
- That's fantastic.

1803
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,808
When do you start?

1804
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,476
- A month after this one's born.

1805
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,729
- I used to look up to you guys.

1806
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:24,316
- Last time we saw
you, you insulted us.

1807
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:26,235
- It was a compliment.

1808
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,986
- Shouldn't
complements feel good?

1809
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:30,489
- Don't worry.

1810
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:33,492
Both of you have been terribly
busy proving me wrong.

1811
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:36,370
- So now I'm not even
one-third of the perfect woman?

1812
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,996
- No, I didn't mean that-

1813
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:41,500
- First of all, disparate
means dissimilar.

1814
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,836
If we were desperate, we would
have used the word desperate,

1815
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,879
but we used the word disparate.

1816
01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:47,339
- Candy, she's showing off.

1817
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:49,842
- Second of all, if we
wanted to invite you tonight,

1818
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:50,676
we would have.

1819
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:53,178
We tried to un-invite.

1820
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:54,888
- You you're making
her feel awful.

1821
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,182
- You were right.

1822
01:13:57,182 --> 01:13:58,517
You're Miss Beauty.

1823
01:13:58,517 --> 01:13:59,852
I'm Miss Brains.

1824
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:02,354
And she's Miss Personality.

1825
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:03,772
We spent the last six months

1826
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,858
trying to prove you wrong,
Jess, but we couldn't.

1827
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:08,694
- I wasn't trying
to prove anything.

1828
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:09,862
- Oh, come on.

1829
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,072
Being in a calendar? You?

1830
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:14,867
And posing nude. Me?

1831
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,535
- I thought you enjoyed it.

1832
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:19,246
- I did, but it's not me.

1833
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:21,123
You see how I dress.

1834
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:24,126
I mean, you're
bouncy-perky-creative,

1835
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,211
and you have
scratch-and-sniff wallpaper.

1836
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:29,965
And now you're
trying to say that

1837
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,259
we don't have brains
or personality either.

1838
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:33,760
- No, that's-

1839
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,431
- I admitted, Jessica, that
you have more personality

1840
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:39,057
than the two of us put together

1841
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:41,894
because only a strong
personality could
upset me this much.

1842
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:46,565
So you're two-thirds
the perfect woman.

1843
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:47,941
Satisfied?

1844
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:49,610
- I was trying to
say that both of you

1845
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,653
are perfect women
all on your own.

1846
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:56,283
Either of you has all the
beauty, brains and personality

1847
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:58,076
that anyone could ever want.

1848
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,245
- But what about-

1849
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:01,413
- Let her finish.

1850
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:06,585
- Candy, look at you
with, with your contract

1851
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:08,587
and your fancy smart new job.

1852
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:12,925
If anyone deserves a
PhD in brains, it's you.

1853
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:15,135
And they wanted you
in their calendar.

1854
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:19,264
Lynnie,

1855
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:24,269
you've got to have an
amazing personality

1856
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:26,188
to be as interesting as you are.

1857
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,107
It's not just brains either.

1858
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:30,943
I know because I've
dated some brainy guys

1859
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,444
and they've been really boring.

1860
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:36,949
And your little camera
tryst with my fiance,

1861
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,536
he obviously thought
you were a beauty.

1862
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:43,205
- He's crazy about you.

1863
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:48,001
- Look, I'm a good fuck.

1864
01:15:48,001 --> 01:15:49,628
I know that.

1865
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,547
But when the sex
with me is over,

1866
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:52,631
what do you have left?

1867
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:53,507
My personality?

1868
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,633
That's a laugh.

1869
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,635
- You have a
wonderful personality.

1870
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,971
- I have no personality.

1871
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,138
I never say the right thing.

1872
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:01,848
I never knew the
right thing to say.

1873
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:04,351
If I walk into a room
and there's no men in it,

1874
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:05,644
I don't know what to do.

1875
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:08,146
I have no brains either.

1876
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:13,151
I work for a company and I
don't even know what we do

1877
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:15,821
or make or sell or whatever.

1878
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,406
- They hired you
because you're classy

1879
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,991
and you make the
company look good.

1880
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,701
And I agree.

1881
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:24,329
- Both of you beat
me at looking good.

1882
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:28,542
The one thing where I
thought I had the advantage.

1883
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:31,503
- You do have the advantage.

1884
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:33,005
You're absolutely stunning.

1885
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:37,009
- Okay. So I'm
one-third a woman.

1886
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:39,344
- Jess, nobody's
trying to beat you.

1887
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:41,179
- At least not consciously.

1888
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:42,598
- You want to be smart.

1889
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:46,018
You go get a PhD
or read a contract.

1890
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:47,853
You want to be pretty.

1891
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:49,688
You get in front of a camera.

1892
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:54,359
Either of you can be
whatever you choose to be.

1893
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:55,277
- Then why haven't I-

1894
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:57,571
- Because you don't want to.

1895
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,531
You don't choose to.

1896
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:01,742
You could walk into a
party and snap your fingers

1897
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:04,202
and five guys would
instantly lineup.

1898
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:06,580
Three years of celibacy
was your choice

1899
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,124
no matter how much you
bitched and moaned about it.

1900
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:13,795
And you, you could have
snapped your fingers

1901
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:17,090
and 10 guys would have lined
up to be that baby's father

1902
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:21,887
but you're doing it on your
own because you're incredible.

1903
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:26,058
- How come she got 10
guys and I only got five?

1904
01:17:27,392 --> 01:17:28,894
- Do you even like
hanging out with me?

1905
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:31,229
Like, do you like
going clubbing?

1906
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:32,648
- Sure.

1907
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,609
- I love squeezing into a
throbbing mass of sweaty bodies.

1908
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,320
Obscenely bright lights
drilling into my skull.

1909
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,072
Music so loud I can smell it.

1910
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:42,157
Filthy predators
armed with roofies

1911
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:43,283
trying to get in my pants.

1912
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:44,242
- See.

1913
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:45,077
We love it.

1914
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,124
- I sat in my car for an hour

1915
01:17:51,124 --> 01:17:53,001
hoping that one
of you would call.

1916
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:56,421
I knew tonight was
our monthly thing.

1917
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:57,255
- We did call.

1918
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:58,590
Why didn't you answer?

1919
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,259
- I was afraid I
would get emotional

1920
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:03,095
and make a fool of myself.

1921
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,097
Too late.

1922
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:06,431
- Why didn't you call us?

1923
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:09,351
- I was embarrassed.

1924
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:12,437
(slow music begins)

1925
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:13,689
- Should we eat?

1926
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,192
- You guys go ahead.

1927
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:19,444
I can't imagine
there's enough for me.

1928
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:20,654
- Oh yes there is.

1929
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:25,158
- Jess, do you I
really want to become

1930
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:27,452
Miss Brains or Miss Personality?

1931
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:29,788
- Of course not.

1932
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:32,624
But you two make me
feel like I should.

1933
01:18:32,624 --> 01:18:33,959
You're always growing.

1934
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:38,880
I said what I said
about the three of us

1935
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,967
because it gave me a
place alongside you two.

1936
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:43,135
Something to be good at.

1937
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:45,637
Being pretty.

1938
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,057
- You do get this cool
effect with your eyeshadow

1939
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,684
that I'm dying to
have you teach me.

1940
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:51,977
- You see, that's the problem.

1941
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:54,146
Soon you're going to be
the eye shadow expert.

1942
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,481
It's six months later

1943
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:59,025
and both of you are better
at being pretty than me.

1944
01:18:59,025 --> 01:19:02,988
But I'm no smarter and
probably even less likable.

1945
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:07,492
I'm about to marry a good
man who I don't even deserve.

1946
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:10,537
He's, like, honest and
keeps his promises.

1947
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:12,038
Who does it?

1948
01:19:12,038 --> 01:19:15,208
- Lynnie and I couldn't stop
thinking about you all evening.

1949
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:17,085
- We really missed you, Jess.

1950
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:20,213
- No, you two deserve
better than me.

1951
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:23,008
So does Ron.

1952
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:25,177
- You don't have to grow

1953
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:26,261
if you don't want to.

1954
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,014
- Really?

1955
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,348
- Of course not.

1956
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:33,018
- I'm no good at it.

1957
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,521
- Then don't grow, sweetie.
Stay this way forever.

1958
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,108
- I have no bridesmaids.

1959
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:44,279
- Actually, you've got two.

1960
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:47,699
(lively music continues)

1961
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:53,705
- Candy, this place
looks very safe.

1962
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:55,540
- Yep. Totally baby-proof.

1963
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:58,960
- I was really rooting for
you to find a dude, you know.

1964
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,545
To help.

1965
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:01,797
- I was too.

1966
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,715
It seems just like
a really big thing

1967
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:04,800
to take on by yourself.

1968
01:20:05,717 --> 01:20:06,927
- Are you kidding?

1969
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:08,762
Beanie and I are going
to have so much fun.

1970
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:11,389
- What if your kid
doesn't like you?

1971
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:14,059
- Then she's just going
to have to withstand

1972
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:16,311
my relentless torrent of love.

1973
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:17,145
Poor thing.

1974
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:21,233
- I wish you were my mother.

1975
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,067
Oh!

1976
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:26,321
I vote for dessert
before dinner.

1977
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:27,948
Dessert before anything.

1978
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:33,245
We're out of control.

1979
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,831
- That's the best idea
I've heard all night.

1980
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,415
- Oh, should we take
our monthly photo

1981
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:38,792
before or after dinner?

1982
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:41,002
- We'll skinnier before we eat.

1983
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:42,420
- Actually,

1984
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:45,507
you guys, I think I'm about
to get a lot skinnier.

1985
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,509
- You invented a new diet?

1986
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:48,343
Oh my God.

1987
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:50,262
She invents diets now.

1988
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:52,430
- Can someone drive
me to the hospital?

1989
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:53,265
- Now?

1990
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:54,474
But we're about to eat.

1991
01:20:55,308 --> 01:20:56,351
- Oh my God!

1992
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:57,811
You're in labor!

1993
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:58,937
- She's not in labor, silly.

1994
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:00,605
She's just going to have a baby.

1995
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:04,442
Oh my God.

1996
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:05,819
You're going to have a baby.

1997
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:08,363
- Call St. Joe's Hospital

1998
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:09,447
and let them know I'm on my way.

1999
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:10,615
Dr. Julia Ditman.

2000
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:11,700
- Okay. Okay.

2001
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:14,286
(laughs)

2002
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:15,704
- Oh.

2003
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:16,955
- Hello?

2004
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:18,707
I need the number for
the, for the hospital.

2005
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,334
I, I don't know.

2006
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:22,836
The St. One!

2007
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:24,462
Candy, which city is this?

2008
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:27,632
- St. Joseph hospital
in Santa Monica.

2009
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:28,633
- Did you hear that?

2010
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:31,469
Hello, hospital?

2011
01:21:31,469 --> 01:21:32,971
Hi.

2012
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:34,890
Okay. My friend is like having
a baby literally right now

2013
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,892
and she's totally freaking out.

2014
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,060
She's afraid she's going
to be a bad mother.

2015
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,315
What kind of a question is that?

2016
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:45,150
Candy, what's your name?

2017
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,902
- Candace Waterman.

2018
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,153
- Candice Watery.

2019
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,071
I think she's with Dr. Ditz.

2020
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:51,907
- Are you sure you
don't want an epidural?

2021
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,491
- No, no anesthetics.

2022
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:56,244
- She doesn't want an
epidermis. Or an appendix

2023
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,163
- Okay. I maybe
should take this call.

2024
01:21:58,163 --> 01:21:59,372
- No, no no.

2025
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:00,582
Please just let me use
my charm and niceness

2026
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,334
to make this go
good. Just for once.

2027
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:05,879
- Okay. But just let
her do it, but hurry.

2028
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:09,507
- Okay. We're going to
be there in 10 minutes.

2029
01:22:09,507 --> 01:22:11,843
And if Candy doesn't
have a fancy room

2030
01:22:11,843 --> 01:22:13,219
I'm kicking asses.

2031
01:22:14,387 --> 01:22:16,556
No, no father. She
was ingratiated.

2032
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:18,516
- I'm going to get
the hospital bag.

2033
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:20,435
- I'll get the keys
and start the car.

2034
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:21,686
But hurry.

2035
01:22:21,686 --> 01:22:23,229
Or I'm going to have
Beanie in the backseat.

2036
01:22:24,856 --> 01:22:27,025
- No, no. I want a room upgrade

2037
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,693
to the nicest one you have.

2038
01:22:28,693 --> 01:22:30,779
Just charge it to
my credit card.

2039
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,781
And fill the room with flowers.

2040
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,032
Fill it.

2041
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:36,242
And charge that to my card too.

2042
01:22:36,242 --> 01:22:38,536
This is our first and I
want it to be perfect.

2043
01:22:40,705 --> 01:22:44,709
Okay. You guys let's
go make a baby.

2044
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:47,420
You know what I meant.

2045
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:50,215
(sighs)

2046
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,383
Aw!

2047
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,217
- Oh, oh.

2048
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:54,302
- Right.

2049
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,812
- Do you remember when
the three were younger?

2050
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,563
Did you ever wonder what
brought them together

2051
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:07,065
in the first place?

2052
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:08,066
I'll give you a hint.

2053
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:09,818
It tastes really good.

2054
01:23:14,614 --> 01:23:17,075
(bell chimes)

2055
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:20,286
(slow music continues)

2056
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:23,581
- Can I have cake?

2057
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,583
- Sure. What kind?

2058
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:26,418
- Devil Food.

2059
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:30,338
- Welcome to LA Province
Bakery. What can I get you?

2060
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:32,090
- Devil Food.

2061
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:34,426
- We have country veggie puree,

2062
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:35,802
vegetarian French onion soup,

2063
01:23:35,802 --> 01:23:37,303
Turkey chili Fergil,

2064
01:23:37,303 --> 01:23:38,346
we have stretched (mumbles).

2065
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:39,472
Just Devil's Food cake?

2066
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:44,019
- Is Devil Food
your favorite too?

2067
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:49,357
You don't look like
you like it very much.

2068
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:51,943
- I love the cake.

2069
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:54,320
It's just everything
else about today.

2070
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:57,657
(bell chimes)

2071
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:05,457
- Welcome to LA Province
Bakery. What can I get you?

2072
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:07,333
- A slice of Devil's Food. Cake.

2073
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,796
- Is that your favorite too?

2074
01:24:13,798 --> 01:24:14,799
- It's the best.

2075
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,135
- It's her favorite too.

2076
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:22,515
- [Jessica] Then you
must be very smart.

2077
01:24:22,515 --> 01:24:24,684
- I'm too smart to
be fun, I guess.

2078
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:26,811
- I'm Lynette.

2079
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:28,354
- I'm Jessica.

2080
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:30,690
I'm too pretty to
quit The Nutcracker.

2081
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:31,900
- I'm Candy.

2082
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,651
But everyone calls me Sunshine.

2083
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:35,820
I'm too sweet.

2084
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:37,822
(giggling)

2085
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:39,824
- Here is Devil
Food cake for you.

2086
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:42,327
And surprise, more
Devil Food cake.

2087
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:45,163
Napkin. Please don't make mess.

2088
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:47,540
This is not school cafeteria.

2089
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:54,172
- I'm cheering my mom up
because Grammy just died.

2090
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:56,508
- We don't tell
strangers our business.

2091
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,009
- They aren't strangers, mommy.

2092
01:24:58,843 --> 01:24:59,844
They're my friends.

2093
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,101
- Of course they are, Sunshine.

2094
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:09,354
(soft music continues)

2095
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,858
- And now, enter me.

2096
01:25:13,858 --> 01:25:16,861
Yes, I'm Maddy. Or Beanie.

2097
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:18,905
Or the test tube baby.

2098
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:19,739
Whatever.

2099
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:25,870
I was born that night,

2100
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:28,706
thus ending one of the most
painful arguments in history:

2101
01:25:28,706 --> 01:25:30,542
Who is the most beautiful?

2102
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,627
Because once I came along,

2103
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:35,296
all three of my moms;
well, my mom, Candy,

2104
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:37,132
and my two aunts,
Jessica and Lynette,

2105
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:39,092
could suddenly
agree on the answer.

2106
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:40,635
I am the most beautiful of all.

2107
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:43,221
I think they're silly.

2108
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:46,558
And they've been squeezing
me to pieces ever since then.

2109
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:49,435
The thing is, all four
of us have beauty,

2110
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:52,897
brains, personality,
and much, much more

2111
01:25:52,897 --> 01:25:56,109
because every person can be
whatever she chooses to be.

2112
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:56,943
(doorbell rings)

2113
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:57,902
(knocking)

2114
01:25:57,902 --> 01:25:58,903
- [Woman 1] Hello.

2115
01:25:58,903 --> 01:26:00,905
- [Woman 2] Hey, we're starving.

2116
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:02,949
- And now if you'll, excuse me.

2117
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:05,577
I have a dinner party
of my own to host,

2118
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:06,786
for my two best friends

2119
01:26:06,786 --> 01:26:09,289
- [Woman 1] Open up. I'm
about to drop this cake.

2120
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:11,583
- Hey, why let a great
tradition go to waste?

2121
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:19,674
(gentle music begins)

2122
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:18,209
(lively music begins)
