3
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,205
You coming?

4
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,978
-Hi, Evelyn.
-Hey.

5
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,022
Alex, college selection seminar
at00

6
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:05,898
in the guidance office.

7
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,350
-Don't forget.
-I'll be there.

8
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,188
I didn't see your name
on the list for the seminar.

9
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:14,689
You got a special in
with the guidance counselor

10
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:16,358
-or something?
-Mom...

11
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,202
Besides, I already know
where I'm applying.

12
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,862
Really?
What's the lucky school?

13
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,365
Harvard, Princeton, Oxford?

14
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:25,167
Uh, CalArts.

15
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,668
-CalArts.
-Yeah, is something wrong

16
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:30,047
-with that?
-Nothing's wrong with CalArts.

17
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,874
You mean, nothing's wrong
with CalArts for Breanna.

18
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,709
I didn't say that,
I just think you should try

19
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:36,378
for the best school you can.

20
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:37,879
And with your grades
and achievements,

21
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,765
that could be
almost anywhere.

22
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,384
I wanna be with Breanna in LA.

23
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,604
Sweetie, I know it's been
hard for you, making friends,

24
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,389
and I am so glad
you met someone

25
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:49,942
you get along with so well
like Breanna, but...

26
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,694
You don't understand.

27
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,072
I'll see you later!

28
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,571
So yesterday,
we talked about

29
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:05,332
the two authors
that I have listed here.

30
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:09,744
Would it be surprising to learn
that both of these authors

31
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,079
are one person?

32
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:14,007
They're the exact same person.

33
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:17,553
Why would an author do
something like this? Yes.

34
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,087
Hello.

35
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:38,106
Evelyn, you're needed
in the front office.

36
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,372
Okay, okay.

37
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,000
But--but yes,
they are the exact same...

38
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,020
Breanna McMillen!

39
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,650
Hello, Ms. Walsh.

40
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,569
Why aren't you in class?

41
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,479
Uh, I was actually
just about to go,

42
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,782
-but I really have to--
-She's helping me!

43
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,201
College week,
my mom needed help

44
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,702
posting more flyers,

45
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,704
and Breanna was nice enough
to volunteer.

46
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,206
Well, keep it quiet.

47
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,999
Class is in session.

48
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,084
-Yeah, sorry, Ms. Walsh.
-Sorry.

49
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,170
And drop a few by my class.

50
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:36,006
-I'm all out.
-Yeah, yeah, of course.

51
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,680
Come on!

52
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:57,277
What--what's this?

53
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:58,570
A bike.

54
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,355
If my mom finds out about...

55
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,866
...you lying about
putting up flyers, you mean?

56
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,911
Let's go.

57
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,202
Let's go!

58
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,418
Where are you going?

59
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,683
Bree, we can't!

60
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,092
Come on!

61
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,729
You can write about it
in your diary.

62
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,688
It's not a diary,

63
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,598
it's a memoir.

64
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,576
Let's go!

65
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,459
So what's your memoir about?

66
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,920
It's about you and me
and the things we love.

67
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,290
Red roses and lipstick,
movies, Hollywood.

68
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,217
-Norma Jean?
-Of course!

69
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,552
There you go.

70
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,058
It's cool, right?

71
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,163
-What's wrong?
-I don't like heights.

72
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,332
Okay, that settles it,
you're jumping.

73
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,051
Um, no.

74
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,136
Fear is an ugly emotion.

75
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,504
I'm not jumping.

76
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,430
We can do it together,

77
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:34,017
-take my hand.
-No, I'm not jumping!

78
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,186
All right.

79
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,854
What are you doing?

80
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,181
Imperfection is beauty,
madness is genius,

81
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,067
and it's better
to be absolutely ridiculous

82
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,069
than absolutely boring.

83
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,200
Breanna!

84
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,585
Bree?

85
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,206
Breanna?

86
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,044
Breanna!

87
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,599
Bree?

88
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,391
Bree...oh my God.

89
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,395
Bree!

90
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,065
Bree.

91
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,414
Bree, Bree!

92
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,542
Oh my God, Bree!

93
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,794
Bree, Bree...

94
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,380
Bree?

95
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,219
-You shoulda seen your face!
-I thought you were dead!

96
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:02,430
-I was kidding!
-Why did you do that?

97
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:06,601
I--I guess I just wanted to see
how far you'd go for me.

98
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,820
To see if you're
really my best friend.

99
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,327
I'm sorry I scared you,
okay?

100
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,955
I got you something.

101
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,087
Here, you get the black.

102
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,672
Look at the back.

103
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,802
-Help me put it on?
-Mm-hm.

104
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,952
Let's never go back.

105
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,328
-Bree...
-I'm serious.

106
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,955
We should go to LA now, today.

107
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,542
-We don't have to wait.
-What are you talking about?

108
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,550
Do you ever...

109
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:15,003
close your eyes and...

110
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,472
wish that everything
were different?

111
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,033
Hey.

112
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,466
I thought I could help
get you started on your packing.

113
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,306
Look, I know it's hard
moving to a new city

114
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,215
for everybody.

115
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,218
Yeah. Thanks.

116
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,605
I remember from just
two years ago.

117
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,440
But you got through it.

118
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,608
And you're doing
better than ever.

119
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,193
Your grades are up
and you're making new friends.

120
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,227
What's the point
of making friends

121
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,864
when you'll just
make us move again?

122
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,199
This is a really great
opportunity for us.

123
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,734
No.

124
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:24,623
This is a really great
opportunity for you.

125
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,436
I thought we were gonna
try to work things out.

126
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,595
This isn't up for debate, Greg.

127
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,731
North Carolina Park Services
are offering me

128
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,524
30 percent over
what I make now

129
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,276
and I'll be a supervisor.

130
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,195
And how about moving
three states away?

131
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,780
How's your daughter
gonna feel about that?

132
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,240
You do not get to act
like you care about Breanna,

133
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,776
-not after what you did.
-I never did anything!

134
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,036
I told you!

135
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,621
-Whatever Breanna told you--
-She wasn't the one who told me.

136
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,498
She even tried
to cover for you.

137
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,458
Don't you think
I know my own daughter

138
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,618
-better than that?
-I think Breanna is very good

139
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,630
at convincing people
to think and do what she wants,

140
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,590
and if she got someone
to lie for her--

141
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,050
I said this wasn't
up for debate.

142
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,553
It is over, Greg.

143
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,631
-But--
-Goodbye.

144
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,489
What are you doing?

145
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,984
I bought unbleached cake flour.

146
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,402
Thought we could make
those scones we saw

147
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:21,189
-on Battle of the Bakers.
-Okay, great.

148
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,357
-That's pretty.
-Oh, thanks.

149
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,161
Bree gave it to me.

150
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,746
Breanna?

151
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,034
Breanna, what's wrong?
Tell me what happened.

152
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:36,796
It's my mom
she's--she's dead!

153
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,380
Stay here, Evelyn.

154
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,686
-Here you go, Breanna.
-Thank you.

155
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,400
This is Detective Kent.

156
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,559
Okay, Breanna.

157
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,487
I'm gonna need you
to go over your story with me

158
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,530
just one more time, okay?

159
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:03,865
Okay.

160
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,901
Um...

161
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,872
I got up about
the usual time

162
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,209
and got ready for school,

163
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:18,963
and I went into the kitchen
for breakfast,

164
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,007
and my mom wasn't there.

165
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:21,916
And at this time,

166
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,751
had you seen
anything unusual?

167
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:28,923
No, just that it was quiet.

168
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,850
Mom always has
the coffee going

169
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:35,146
before I come down, but...

170
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,315
this morning,
there wasn't any,

171
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,153
-because...
-I understand.

172
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:45,773
Then what happened?

173
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:51,079
I thought she overslept
or something, so...

174
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:57,952
I went into her room,
and that's when I found her.

175
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,454
I saw her on the floor

176
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:06,594
and I thought
I could help her, but...

177
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,299
as soon as I touched her,
I knew.

178
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,634
I know this isn't easy to hear,

179
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,145
but we know your mom was killed
with tranquilizer darts,

180
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:19,274
and apparently, they were
taken from her own work bag.

181
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:23,403
Were you home last night
all night?

182
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,612
Yes.

183
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,574
And when was the last time
you actually saw your mom?

184
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,318
Um...about00?

185
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,828
Did you hear anything

186
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,454
after you saw your mom
at00?

187
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,956
No.

188
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,959
I had my headphones on
and my music was up, I--

189
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,711
I didn't hear anything.

190
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,496
Okay.

191
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,498
Can you think of anyone,
anyone at all,

192
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,593
that would want to hurt
your mom?

193
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:50,555
Um...no.

194
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,393
Well...there's Greg,
Greg Olson.

195
00:14:55,478 --> 00:15:01,349
That's Mom's boyfriend--
or ex-boyfriend.

196
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:05,904
He was really mad
when they broke up.

197
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,855
I heard them fighting.

198
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,033
Well, thank you, Breanna,
you've been a really big help.

199
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,036
I'm sure you can use your rest.

200
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:16,372
Can you let my office know
where she'll be staying?

201
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,000
I--I'm afraid not.

202
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,203
Your mom didn't fill out
the emergency contact person

203
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,537
on your paperwork.

204
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,206
It's easy to miss,

205
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,134
especially when
there's so much to fill out.

206
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,970
Who's your nearest relative?

207
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,014
You mean I can't stay here?

208
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,974
At the school?

209
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:40,554
No, I mean...
I don't have any relatives.

210
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,774
-None at all?
-My mom has a cousin,

211
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,726
Sarah-Louise, but...

212
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,362
I-I can't go to her.

213
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,323
She lives hours away
and I hardly know her.

214
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,660
Do you have her number?

215
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:54,786
No.

216
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,079
Okay.

217
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,914
I'll contact Family Services.

218
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,241
They'll be able to set you up
with a foster family

219
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,919
-or a group home--
-No! I can't go to foster care.

220
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,712
Ms. Hayden, please.

221
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,256
I-I can't go
to a bunch of strangers, okay?

222
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,176
-Not now, please.
-I'm sorry.

223
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,804
I'm afraid that foster care
or a group home

224
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,347
is your only options.

225
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,589
No they're not!

226
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,183
You can stay with us.

227
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,605
I'm sure we can get you
a temporary custody order

228
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,432
under the circumstances.

229
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,984
Mom?

230
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,655
Okay.

231
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,441
Um, at least until
we find this cousin,

232
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,119
and then we will
reassess things.

233
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,945
It'll be okay.

234
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,448
It'll be just like
you talked about.

235
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,709
Best friends forever.

236
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,669
Forever and ever.

237
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,268
You know where everything is,
right?

238
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,478
I'm sure Evelyn can
lend you some clothes.

239
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:03,721
Thank you, Ms. Hayden.

240
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,222
I don't wanna be any trouble.

241
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,058
Oh, Breanna, you're not.

242
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,401
Please never think that.

243
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,209
Hey, thank you
for letting Bree stay here.

244
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,578
-You're the best.
-I'm proud of you

245
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,340
for caring so much
and being such a good friend.

246
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,092
Thanks.

247
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,721
I'll do everything I can
for her.

248
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,522
Detective Kent!

249
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,182
Is everything all right?

250
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:12,817
Yeah, yeah, I just thought
Breanna might need

251
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,018
a few things from home.

252
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,987
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

253
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,447
Thank you,
that's so thoughtful.

254
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,741
I had one of the female officers
do the packing.

255
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:24,120
I don't have much of an idea
what a teenage girl would need.

256
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,122
I'm surprised Breanna has
anything left at home.

257
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,707
She spends so much time here

258
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:31,294
and the girls are always
trading clothes.

259
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,838
-Well, here we go.
-Thank you.

260
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,675
-Would you like to come in?
-All right.

261
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,056
They seem close.

262
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,382
Ever since they met
in summer school

263
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,352
a couple years ago.

264
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,222
Evelyn's always been shy
and had trouble making friends,

265
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:55,559
but her issues got worse
after her father passed away.

266
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,486
She missed
quite a bit of school.

267
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,531
I'll bet they didn't have a lot
of other college-track kids in

268
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:04,235
with the summer slackers,
did they?

269
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,903
Just the two of them.

270
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,749
It's been that way ever since.

271
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,126
You didn't happen to find
Breanna's mom's cell phone

272
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,744
at her house, did you?

273
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,579
Nah, it was smashed pretty bad.

274
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,467
I was hoping it would have
her cousin's contact info.

275
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,552
Maybe Mindy's boyfriend
might know?

276
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,921
I'd be happy to ask,
if we can find him.

277
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,589
He seems to have taken off.

278
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,392
-Is that suspicious?
-Mm-hm.

279
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,594
You don't think he'll
come for Breanna?

280
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,596
We don't even know
if he's our guy.

281
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,931
Look, whoever the killer is,

282
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:38,486
if he wanted Breanna, he could
have done it last night.

283
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,696
I guess you're right.

284
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,115
I don't wanna take
any more of your time.

285
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,700
Thank you again.

286
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,702
-I'll show you out?
-Of course.

287
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,782
...get an apartment,

288
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,451
and it'll be right by
the Hollywood sign, right?

289
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,296
It'll be just like
you talked about.

290
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,674
It's perfect!

291
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,468
Hi, girls.

292
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:15,314
Breanna, Detective Kent had
some of your things sent over.

293
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,399
He though you might need these.

294
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:20,111
Oh, thanks!

295
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,072
Breanna, do you know if
your mom had an address book

296
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,817
or a planner,
anything like that?

297
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,652
Uh, I don't know.

298
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,455
Maybe. Why?

299
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,624
I'm hoping it would have
her cousin's number.

300
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,793
Do you know where
she might have kept it?

301
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:40,006
Probably in her room,
but I'm not sure.

302
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:47,671
Hey, Mom, we kinda need
to be alone.

303
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:48,681
Okay.

304
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,141
Let me know if there's
anything you girls need.

305
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,843
Yeah. Thanks.

306
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,020
-Anyways...yes, red walls.
-Yes.

307
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,022
-Flowers, maybe.
-Roses everywhere.

308
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,580
Yeah, thank you.

309
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,885
Hi, Breanna.

310
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,845
I thought you might like these.

311
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,382
I'm sorry about your--
I mean...

312
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:34,310
I know what it's like.

313
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:38,555
Both of my parents
are dead, too.

314
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,557
I didn't know.

315
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,361
Um...

316
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,154
Would you like
to sit with us?

317
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,064
You sure?

318
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,449
Yeah.

319
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,239
Thanks.

320
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,962
They're really pretty,
thank you.

321
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,964
It was a long time ago.

322
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:07,431
"S" for Sarah-Louise.

323
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,195
Hello?

324
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,075
Hello?

325
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:02,152
Is someone there?

326
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,345
I mean, she just called me

327
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,523
and she, like,
sprained her ankle falling.

328
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,742
-Mom.
-Ms. Hayden.

329
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,360
Evie, take her bags.

330
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:44,861
You girls are sweet.

331
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,697
I'm fine.

332
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:51,126
The doctor said I can walk,
as long as I don't overdo it.

333
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:54,037
God.

334
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:57,633
Oh. The tea.

335
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,376
I just put it on.

336
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,803
Lemon and one sugar?

337
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,638
-Yes.
-Okay.

338
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,642
I should probably
go help her.

339
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,552
Hold on.

340
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,220
-Mom--
-I'm sure Breanna can make tea

341
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,147
on her own just fine.

342
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:19,571
What did you mean
when you said,

343
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,408
"It will be just like
you talked about" to Breanna?

344
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,567
You said it in my office

345
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,577
and I overheard you
say it again yesterday.

346
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:31,074
So I'm not
the only eavesdropper?

347
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,418
-It's no big deal.
-Then you won't mind

348
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,910
telling me about it.

349
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,131
I just meant
it'll be like

350
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,842
when Bree talks about us
rooming together at college.

351
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,251
Honey, we don't
even know how long

352
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,419
she's gonna be staying with us.

353
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,471
Her cousin may want her
to come stay with her.

354
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,807
-She lives hours away.
-She's also her family.

355
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,559
I'm sure that's what
her mom would have wanted.

356
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:49,685
Who cares what her mom
would have wanted?

357
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,428
It's not like she was
such a great mom anyways.

358
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,430
-Evelyn!
-She was making Bree move away!

359
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:59,436
You knew about that?

360
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,572
Why didn't you say anything?

361
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,740
What's the point?

362
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,742
It's not like talking
would have changed anything.

363
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,702
That's really mature of you
I'm really--

364
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:07,786
Okay, that's not
the only thing she did.

365
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,447
She was always dating
these gross, creepy guys,

366
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:12,282
like that Greg.

367
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,785
What was gross and creepy
about Greg Olson?

368
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:17,120
Uh, he was always
hanging around Bree,

369
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,006
trying to talk to her,
wanting to touch her.

370
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,091
Like, totally hitting on her.

371
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,459
And when Mrs. McMillen
found out,

372
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,428
that's when
she broke up with him.

373
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,471
Look.

374
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:28,140
All I'm saying is
let's not borrow trouble.

375
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:31,185
Breanna has suffered
a big loss, and...

376
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,228
you have to expect
big changes to come from that

377
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:34,605
sooner or later.

378
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,690
Here we are.

379
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:40,694
And I just baked
some cookies.

380
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,279
Do you need a blanket?

381
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,739
-No, I'm--
-Evie, get the red afghan

382
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,241
-in the room.
-It's really not necessary.

383
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,164
This is all very sweet,

384
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,324
but you don't have to do this.

385
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:57,327
But you've been so good

386
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,830
letting me stay here.

387
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:05,636
Well, I wanna think
about something else,

388
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,672
even if just
for a little while?

389
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:09,973
Is that all it is?

390
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,978
You can tell me.

391
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:17,681
My mom and I,

392
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:22,861
we had a fight
the night she...

393
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,739
It was stupid, but...

394
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:27,950
I was so mad at her.

395
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:31,495
But now she's...

396
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,163
I feel so bad about it,

397
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,365
but there's nothing
I can do,

398
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,960
because I--
I can't see her

399
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,871
or talk to her or anything.

400
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,423
Not ever again.

401
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:47,511
Breanna, your mom knows
you love her,

402
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,930
no matter where she is.

403
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:54,050
And she knows you didn't mean
anything you said in anger.

404
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,562
Your mom never stopped
loving you.

405
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,722
Not even for a second.

406
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,446
How do you know?

407
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:10,567
Because even if they
don't like their actions,

408
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,620
moms always love their kids.

409
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:20,752
You know I'm always here
for you, okay?

410
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,423
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

411
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,249
You know...

412
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:31,054
Breanna, hey.

413
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,431
How are you holding up?

414
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,765
She's okay.

415
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,517
Thanks for asking.

416
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:36,852
Okay.

417
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:54,912
What's up?

418
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:56,288
-Not much, how are you?
-Good.

419
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,753
-What are you reading?
-Oh, it's Huckleberry Finn.

420
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,421
Ooh!

421
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,122
I had a friend in college,

422
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,926
and every time
she got a new boyfriend,

423
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:11,845
I wouldn't see her
for two weeks.

424
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,631
But she always
came back around,

425
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:17,801
and it always gave me a chance
to meet some new people.

426
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:19,978
And Jenna Ryder
is really friendly

427
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,805
and there's room
at her table.

428
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:25,976
I'm not mad about that,
it's just...

429
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,528
-Are you sure?
-It's Alex Tyler.

430
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,031
He doesn't actually like her,

431
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,824
he's just using her
to get attention,

432
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:35,243
to be popular.

433
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,654
-Sweetie, I don't think--
-I gotta go.

434
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,323
I'm gonna be late for class.

435
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:52,168
Lucy?

436
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,670
This came for you
to the office.

437
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:54,838
Thank you.

438
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,673
I asked Breanna McMillen's
last school to send over

439
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,225
her file.

440
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,518
I'm still looking
for the contact info

441
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,561
for her mom's cousin.

442
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,567
Still nothing.

443
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:08,944
I guess it's hard to imagine
that the worst

444
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,654
will ever actually happen.

445
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,524
-That's a pretty thick file.
-You're right.

446
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,364
-What is it?
-It looks like Breanna

447
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,500
didn't change schools
because they moved.

448
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,035
She was expelled.

449
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:27,337
She broke
another student's nose.

450
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:28,422
I can't even...

451
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:29,715
Breanna McMillen's been
in and out of my house

452
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:32,801
almost every day
for the last year and a half.

453
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,377
I've never seen anything
like this from her,

454
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,930
especially not
anything violent.

455
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,048
Well, just goes to show,

456
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:39,891
you can never really know
another person.

457
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,886
It says that her problem started
after her dad died.

458
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,313
Maybe she just needed
a fresh start.

459
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,390
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

460
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,726
I-I didn't just come here
to play Pony Express.

461
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,562
There's something serious
I need to talk to you about.

462
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:56,900
Breanna McMillen handed this in
to Mr. Drew for English.

463
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,827
He showed it to me because
he thought it was very good,

464
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,037
very insightful.

465
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,496
"Joseph Conrad's
Heart of Darkness

466
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:03,081
has at its center
Commander Kurtz,

467
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,791
a man driven by his
environment and circumstances

468
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,576
to commit evil deeds."

469
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,920
He's right. I didn't realize
she could write this well.

470
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:10,580
That's the problem.
She can't.

471
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:14,509
"Joseph Conrad's
Heart of Darkness

472
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:15,677
has at its center
Commander Kurtz,

473
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:19,222
a man driven by his environment
and circumstances..."

474
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:20,423
I see.

475
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,642
I assigned that same book
to my AP English class

476
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:23,760
last year.

477
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,812
I kept a copy of this
because it was so good.

478
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,597
This was Evelyn's essay.

479
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:28,732
I haven't shown it
to Mr. Drew yet.

480
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:31,318
I wanted to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

481
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,771
And Evelyn's worked so hard
after her little bit of trouble.

482
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:35,697
Thank you.

483
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:36,940
I appreciate you
coming to me first.

484
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,441
Will you just let me
talk to the girls

485
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,110
and get their side
of the story?

486
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:41,945
Yes, go ahead, I...

487
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,279
I know it hasn't been
easy for you

488
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,615
raising Evelyn by yourself.

489
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,502
Especially when
she struggled so much.

490
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,619
Thank you.

491
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,963
But I would get that Breanna
out of your house.

492
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,623
It would be a shame
if her bad influence

493
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,008
rubbed off on Evelyn.

494
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:10,690
Who are you?
What do you want?

495
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:13,860
I'm Greg Olson.

496
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:15,562
Hey!

497
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:16,896
Hey, stop!

498
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,948
I need to talk to you.

499
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,566
I need to--

500
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,703
Hey, I just wanna
talk to you, that's it.

501
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:24,904
I'm not gonna hurt you.

502
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:28,125
Well, you're not really
giving me much of a choice.

503
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,043
I didn't kill Mindy.

504
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:32,796
You're not doing a very good job
of acting like an innocent man.

505
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:36,633
I was home
the night she was murdered.

506
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,586
I wanted to be with her,
I loved her.

507
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,805
I would never hurt her,
not ever.

508
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,923
Tell it to the police.

509
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:47,060
You think the boyfriend--
ex-boyfriend--

510
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:48,728
isn't always
the prime suspect?

511
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:52,274
Especially one who has
a couple DUIs on his record?

512
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:54,434
What's to stop them
from pinning it all on me,

513
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:57,437
go for an easy conviction,
get the case off the books?

514
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,614
Make everyone look
like a rock star...

515
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,274
except me.

516
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,276
How 'bout the truth?

517
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,778
That's what I'm hoping for.

518
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:06,955
I'm a victim here too.

519
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,541
I know what it looks like,
but I'm a good guy.

520
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:10,709
Not a bad guy,

521
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,752
but you hit on your
girlfriend's teenage daughter?

522
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:13,753
That little brat!

523
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,881
Is that what she told you?

524
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:18,842
I never did that.

525
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,136
The only time
I ever touched her

526
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:24,631
was the day that I shook her
hand when Mindy introduced us.

527
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,633
That's clearly not
what Mindy thought.

528
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:28,968
Because Breanna lied.

529
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:33,023
She saw we were getting close
and didn't want a stepdad.

530
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,108
Why wouldn't Breanna
want a stepdad?

531
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:38,144
I wasn't falling for
her little lost girl act.

532
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:41,648
I wasn't gonna, you know,
tolerate her manipulation

533
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:42,991
and lies.

534
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,534
Why are you telling me all this?

535
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,653
Mindy was killed
with a hypodermic needle

536
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,821
filled with animal tranquilizer.

537
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,157
And her dart gun is missing.

538
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,126
And who had
the most access to it?

539
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:56,162
So you think Breanna
killed her own mother.

540
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,664
Tell that to the boys in blue.

541
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,007
Okay, you know what?

542
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,166
I just wanna make sure
I get all this.

543
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,177
I wanna write this down, so.

544
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,057
You little...

545
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,574
Lay down and close your eyes.

546
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:16,710
Just do it.

547
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,295
Okay.

548
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,176
Okay. On three, we'll open.

549
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:27,512
-Okay?
-Okay.

550
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:30,640
One, two, three.

551
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,521
Wow.

552
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,097
It's perfect.

553
00:38:55,917 --> 00:39:00,286
Evelyn? Breanna?

554
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,955
-Do you like it?
-Remember I told you our plan?

555
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,624
-It's the midnight sky.
-Remember I told you

556
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:06,593
to hold off on redecorating?

557
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,461
-Evelyn, I was clear--
-Mom, it's my room.

558
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,430
Okay, we will
address this later.

559
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,600
Breanna, something very serious
has been brought to my attention

560
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,635
and we need to discuss it.

561
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:19,606
It's very serious, it's about
your essay for Mr. Drew.

562
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,857
-What about it?
-We know that

563
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,308
you didn't write it.

564
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,736
Not really.

565
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:25,862
-What?
-Don't you realize

566
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,314
you could've gotten Evelyn
into a lot of trouble?

567
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:31,984
Evelyn...what's she got to do
with my essay?

568
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,661
Mr. Drew showed it
to Mrs. Walsh

569
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,497
and she recognized it
as one too similar

570
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,457
to one that she had
received last year.

571
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,000
I don't understand
what you're saying.

572
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:42,495
I haven't even
turned in my essay yet.

573
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:45,799
-What?
-I'm still working on it.

574
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,167
He gave me an extension
until Monday, I...

575
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:51,137
I have my notes and my outline
on my laptop.

576
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:54,432
Mr. Drew received this essay
with your name on it.

577
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:02,857
I've never seen this
before in my life.

578
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,017
Breanna, please don't try
to lie and cover this up.

579
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:06,519
You're only going
to make it worse.

580
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:09,280
I'm not lying.

581
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:10,490
Why don't you believe me?

582
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,693
I saw a copy of the records
from your last school.

583
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:17,697
We know all about the fight
and you getting expelled.

584
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,533
I didn't want anyone
to know about that.

585
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:24,462
I knew they'd judge me for it.

586
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:26,205
It does make it very hard
to believe you now,

587
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,508
especially when I have
the proof in my own hands.

588
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,468
Okay, I got into some trouble.

589
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:33,096
But even at my old school,
I never cheated,

590
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:36,808
-I would never do that.
-It was me.

591
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,935
What?

592
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,721
I turned in the essay
with Breanna's name on it.

593
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:44,649
I-I put it in his mailbox
this morning,

594
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:45,692
but she didn't have
anything to do with it,

595
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,319
-I swear.
-Evie, what were you thinking?

596
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:49,737
I coulda got
into so much trouble.

597
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:52,064
But I didn't know Mr. Drew
would show it to Ms. Walsh.

598
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,741
I was just trying to help.

599
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,735
You're my best friend.

600
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:58,738
Right? Best friends would do
anything for each other.

601
00:40:58,832 --> 00:41:01,207
I have a very hard time
believing that you did this

602
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:04,502
entirely without
prompting from Breanna.

603
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:05,912
See what you did?

604
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:08,247
Now everybody thinks
I'm a liar and a cheat.

605
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,092
-But I did it for you--
-No.

606
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,084
I don't wanna hear it.

607
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:16,055
I can't believe
you'd do this to me.

608
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,478
-Evie...
-Let her go.

609
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:25,064
She'll come back
when she calms down.

610
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,858
You hate me now?

611
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,693
I don't hate you.

612
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:32,605
Even if Evelyn gets in trouble
for trying to help me?

613
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,285
It's okay.

614
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,037
You're not my mom.

615
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,246
You don't have to love me

616
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:42,582
even when you don't love
my actions.

617
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,617
Breanna, I just--

618
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:47,453
Can I get back to work now,
please?

619
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,345
Finally.

620
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:50,516
Hello?

621
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,486
Hi, uh, you don't know me,

622
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:55,530
but my name's Lucy Hayden.

623
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:58,324
I-I'm looking for
Mindy McMillen's cousin.

624
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,692
That's me. Why?

625
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:00,860
Is anything wrong?

626
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:03,204
Um, I'm afraid so.

627
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:05,206
Mindy's dead.

628
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:08,293
-She was murdered.
-Oh, I can't believe this.

629
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:09,877
Breanna.
Is Breanna okay?

630
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:12,005
She's fine. In fact,

631
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,040
she's staying with me
and my daughter, Evelyn,

632
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:17,710
the girls are best friends,
while we tried to reach you.

633
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,211
Tried to?

634
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:20,346
I don't understand.

635
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:22,640
Well, I'll text you
the number of the detective

636
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:23,725
in charge of Mindy's case.

637
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:26,052
He'll be able to explain
more to you than I can.

638
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:28,220
Thank you, and thank you
for letting me know.

639
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:30,773
I'm sorry, I don't even know
where it is that you live.

640
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:32,650
-Fort Pierce.
-Oh.

641
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:33,943
That's only 90 minutes away.

642
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:37,822
I'd be happy to come to you
to discuss everything with her.

643
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:41,734
-Would Sunday be too soon?
-No, the sooner the better.

644
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,870
Thank you for taking care
of Breanna.

645
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,080
-Poor child.
-Again, I'm so sorry

646
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,707
for your loss.

647
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:48,741
Goodbye.

648
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:05,391
Ow.

649
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:36,122
Who's out there?

650
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,627
I'm gonna call the police.

651
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,974
Oh, seriously?

652
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:49,894
Show yourself.

653
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,397
I'm calling the police.

654
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:55,808
-Hey, is everything okay?
-Someone's out there.

655
00:44:57,779 --> 00:44:59,696
Get inside.

656
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,818
It's probably just
the neighbor's cat.

657
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,987
He cuts through
the yard sometimes.

658
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:09,455
Ms. Hayden.

659
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,208
Did you get locked out?

660
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:14,660
I thought I heard knocking.

661
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,662
I'm sorry.

662
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:17,755
I'm really tired.

663
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:19,999
Um, it's been a long day,

664
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:21,676
we could all use some rest.

665
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,170
Hey.

666
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:26,055
Talk to you in the morning.

667
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,484
Bree?

668
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,193
Can you forgive me?

669
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:55,752
Yes. Of course.

670
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,755
It's been a terrible week.

671
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,173
A terrible, terrible week, okay?

672
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,008
-I'm so sorry.
-No, of course.

673
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:05,044
I--I'm sorry too.

674
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,640
You know you mean
everything to me, right?

675
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:13,186
Best friends forever.

676
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,554
Forever and ever.

677
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:46,385
Oh, good, there's coffee.

678
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,257
Hold on.

679
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:52,424
You owe me a talk.

680
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:53,768
Mom, Bree's coffee
is gonna get cold,

681
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:56,187
-and she hates cold coffee.
-Bree can make herself

682
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:57,763
some more coffee.

683
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:58,898
Do you realize
how much trouble

684
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,734
you could have gotten into
for that essay stunt?

685
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:05,363
What made you think
of doing such a thing?

686
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:07,281
Bree was really worried

687
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:09,617
about getting kicked off
the college track.

688
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:10,618
She said she might
not even be able

689
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:11,944
to get into state then.

690
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:14,330
So she asked you
to help her.

691
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:15,998
No, it wasn't like that.

692
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:17,291
She didn't have to.

693
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,451
She knows how much going to
college together means to you.

694
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:21,128
She just had to make you
think there was a chance

695
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:24,957
she couldn't go and let you
draw your own conclusions.

696
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,926
Mom, she didn't
make me do anything.

697
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,460
Look, I know you think
she's your friend,

698
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:30,296
but she is manipulating you.

699
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,298
You have to ask yourself
if her words and actions

700
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:34,517
-are those of a true friend.
-She didn't make me

701
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,477
do anything, I swear.

702
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,898
Fine.
I believe you.

703
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:44,777
I'll--I'll tell Mr. Drew
it was just a misunderstanding.

704
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,529
Breanna can turn in
her essay on Monday.

705
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:47,947
And no more helping.

706
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,315
From here on out,
Breanna has to do

707
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:50,783
all her work on her own.

708
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:52,818
Your future
depends on this, Evelyn.

709
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:53,911
Okay, fine.

710
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:55,487
Can I go now?

711
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:57,874
Hey, can I have a hug first?

712
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:01,419
-Hey, what's up?
-Oh, God!

713
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:03,129
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

714
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:06,665
It is okay. I will
just change my shirt.

715
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:09,668
Uh, I'll pick up some pizza
for dinner tonight.

716
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,804
-See you girls tonight.
-Thanks, Mom.

717
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,639
Oh, Bree doesn't
like mushrooms.

718
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:00,853
-Hey, Ms. Hayden.
-Jenna.

719
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:03,522
What brings you into school
on a Saturday?

720
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:06,317
Band practice
for the spring musical.

721
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:09,654
I was hoping maybe
Evelyn would reconsider

722
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:10,905
coming back
this year.

723
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:13,366
We could really use
an oboe player.

724
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:16,285
Our reed section
is a little thin.

725
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:17,912
I think the girls
decided against

726
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:19,071
the school musical
this year,

727
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,791
but I'll be sure
to bring up your invitation

728
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:24,576
-to Evelyn and Breanna.
-Not Breanna.

729
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:27,672
I mean, we have
a pianist already.

730
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:30,633
Okay, well,
I will just tell Evelyn,

731
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,260
but if I were you
I'd keep up the oboe search.

732
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:36,347
Do you know why Evelyn
doesn't like us?

733
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:39,258
The other band kids, I mean.

734
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:41,560
Did we do something
to offend her or something?

735
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:43,771
What? No.
I'm sure that's not true.

736
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,481
What would make you
ask that?

737
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,932
Last year, we kept asking her

738
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,101
to hang out and do stuff
after rehearsals.

739
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:51,487
We invited Breanna,
too, of course,

740
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:54,949
but they just wanted
to be together.

741
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:59,996
Even if Breanna had something
to do with her mom or whatever,

742
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,780
Evelyn wouldn't hang out
with us.

743
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:05,459
-Did she say why not?
-She said something like,

744
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:06,794
"Breanna wouldn't like it."

745
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,787
Well, I will bring
this up to Evelyn,

746
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,589
and we'll just have to see
if she'll reconsider

747
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,291
when things
settle down a bit.

748
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:13,592
Thanks, Ms. Hayden.

749
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:37,700
Hello.

750
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,828
I come bearing pizza,
mushroom-free.

751
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,791
What are you doing out here?

752
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,995
Come on, don't tell me
that Breanna changed her mind

753
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,465
-about mushrooms.
-No.

754
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:57,094
-What's up?
-Nothing.

755
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,721
Would that nothing
be named Breanna?

756
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,097
No.

757
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,008
Where is she?

758
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:06,011
She's finishing her essay.

759
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:07,438
Good.

760
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:09,815
I'm glad
she's taking it seriously.

761
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:11,442
Yeah, well,
she would have been done by now

762
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:12,851
if she hadn't
been gone all day.

763
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,529
Gone? Where'd she go?

764
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,531
I don't know.

765
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,033
She wouldn't tell me.

766
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,409
She wouldn't let me
go with her either.

767
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:25,998
You know, even best friends
need some time apart.

768
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:28,501
Jenna stopped by
my office today

769
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,002
to see if maybe you wanted
to join the band

770
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:31,870
for the school musical
after all?

771
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:34,039
No, they just need
an oboe player.

772
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,217
She said that,
but she's also afraid

773
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:40,045
that you don't like her
and the other band kids.

774
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,515
I think she really wants
to be your friend.

775
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,558
Why don't you give her
a chance?

776
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:47,219
I know that
you still struggle

777
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:48,646
with your shyness
and anxiety,

778
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,223
but you can talk to me.

779
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:52,817
And if you want, I can make you
another appointment.

780
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:55,111
God, Mom, I don't want
to talk to anybody, okay?

781
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:58,030
I don't need other friends,
I have--I have Bree.

782
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:30,229
Nobody understands.

783
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,356
I couldn't tell
anybody this.

784
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:33,599
-Ever.
-Breanna?

785
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:35,109
Sh, I have to go.

786
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:36,777
Breanna, what are you doing up?

787
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,321
It's the middle
of the night.

788
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:43,909
-I couldn't sleep.
-Who are you talking to?

789
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:47,830
-No one.
-Breanna.

790
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:49,114
-It's private.
-That's not

791
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,041
an acceptable answer.

792
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:52,042
Evelyn said
you were gone all day

793
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:54,211
without letting me know
where you were.

794
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:55,671
I just went to the mall.

795
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:58,174
You still should have told me.

796
00:52:58,259 --> 00:52:59,216
Let me see your phone.

797
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:00,926
No.

798
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:02,461
I don't have to show you.

799
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:04,129
You're not my mom.

800
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,306
I know.

801
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:08,726
But you're under my roof
and I'm responsible for you.

802
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,936
That means that I get
to set rules and boundaries,

803
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:14,640
including knowing
who you're speaking to.

804
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:16,859
But I would never
try to replace your mom.

805
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,144
Well, that's good.

806
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:22,448
What are moms
good for anyway?

807
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,825
They jerk you around
from place to place.

808
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:27,369
They date whoever
they want.

809
00:53:27,455 --> 00:53:28,996
Even if you hate them.

810
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:33,209
They don't care
about how you feel

811
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:34,710
or what you need.

812
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:38,130
I never want a mom again.

813
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:40,332
I know that you're going
through a hard time, but--

814
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:42,843
You don't know
anything about me.

815
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,472
I'm glad you're not my mom.

816
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,840
-I wish I never had one.
-Breanna!

817
00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:50,351
Breanna.

818
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:43,061
Sarah-Louise?

819
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,823
It's Lucy Hayden.

820
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:40,169
Sarah-Louise?

821
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:45,791
This was a wasted trip.

822
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:33,514
Lucy?

823
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:35,307
Detective Kent,
what are you doing here?

824
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:36,350
Well, they called me in

825
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:38,602
since the victim's connected
to one of mine.

826
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:40,813
I just don't understand

827
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,315
why someone would do
something like this.

828
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:46,852
Yeah, it's a hard thing to wrap
your head around, but...

829
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:47,903
At least we know one thing.

830
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:50,188
Sarah-Louise wasn't killed
by Greg Olson.

831
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:51,990
-How do you know that?
-Well, 'cause he was in

832
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:54,693
my station when she died.

833
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:56,695
So you finally ran him down?

834
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,205
It's more like
he came to his senses.

835
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:00,532
Walked in on his own.

836
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,033
And he doesn't
look too good

837
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:04,545
for Mindy McMillen's
death either.

838
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:05,704
Neighbor swears
she saw him sleeping

839
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:08,874
in his living room
with all the lights still on.

840
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:10,709
She was out
walking her dog

841
00:57:10,803 --> 00:57:12,761
right around
the same time she died.

842
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:15,305
So we have no idea
who killed Mindy either?

843
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:18,884
I--it's gotta be someone
who knew about the dart gun,

844
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:21,186
someone who had access to it.

845
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:22,053
Unfortunately,
a lot of people

846
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:24,022
knew about her work as a vet.

847
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:26,057
But did they know
where she kept the gun?

848
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:28,652
What are you saying?

849
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,362
Excuse me, I'm gonna
go see what they want.

850
00:57:30,448 --> 00:57:32,281
I'll be back.

851
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,908
Hey, Mom, where are you?

852
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:45,243
It's a long story,
I'll tell you when I get home.

853
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:46,420
Are you okay?

854
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:47,713
Maybe you should tell me now.

855
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:49,798
Was that a police siren?

856
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:51,008
I'll tell you
when I get back.

857
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:52,843
Is Breanna there?

858
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:54,178
Um, yeah, she's here.

859
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:56,221
She's working on her essay.

860
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:57,890
She would have
had it done by now

861
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,591
if I could have just
helped her a little bit.

862
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:00,592
Not now, Evelyn.

863
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:02,352
Put me on speaker.

864
00:58:02,438 --> 00:58:05,105
Okay.

865
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:06,398
Can you girls hear me?

866
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:07,566
This is very important.

867
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:10,903
I need you to lock the doors
and stay in the house.

868
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,696
No going out,
no guests over.

869
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:15,449
Don't even open the door,
even if you know the person.

870
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:17,609
Especially you, Breanna,
do you understand?

871
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:20,111
-Yes, Mom.
-Yes, Ms. Hayden.

872
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:21,580
Good, I--

873
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:22,539
I don't mean
to scare you girls,

874
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,416
but I need you
to take this seriously.

875
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:27,085
I'll be home in about
an hour and a half.

876
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:28,787
I love you girls.

877
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:31,122
-Love you. Bye.
-Bye.

878
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:39,097
Your mom said
she loved me.

879
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:41,767
Yeah, why wouldn't she?

880
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,603
She was so mad about
the phone call last night.

881
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:46,137
Well, she gets mad
all the time.

882
00:58:46,232 --> 00:58:47,231
It never lasts.

883
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:51,235
Yeah, my mom
was like that too.

884
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,528
Do you miss her?

885
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:57,816
Maybe that's why this essay
is taking forever.

886
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,910
Maybe you need
a study break.

887
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:02,579
We could make some popcorn
and watch a movie.

888
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:04,748
Niagara or
Don't Bother to Knock.

889
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,583
I--I really shouldn't.

890
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:08,159
It's due tomorrow
and it has to be

891
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:10,128
at least as good
as the one you turned in.

892
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:12,005
I could help you.

893
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:14,591
-I don't know.
-Just with, like,

894
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:15,834
grammar and spellcheck.

895
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:16,718
That's not cheating.

896
00:59:16,804 --> 00:59:20,171
That's something
you can do online.

897
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:21,723
I guess that'd be okay.

898
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:27,062
Actually, I need you to do
something for me first.

899
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:28,513
Anything.

900
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,607
Tell me where
you were yesterday.

901
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:34,352
Why do you want
to know that?

902
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:35,904
Because...

903
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:36,855
if we're best friends,

904
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:39,449
we should tell
each other everything.

905
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:41,952
We can't keep secrets
between us.

906
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:46,197
Okay, but you can't tell anyone.

907
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:47,708
-Ever.
-Yeah, okay.

908
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:48,867
I mean it.

909
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:51,369
Especially not your mom.

910
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,755
Cross my heart.

911
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:04,057
Detective Kent?

912
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,938
Detective?

913
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:48,727
Are you girls okay?

914
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:49,895
Yeah, Mom, we're fine.

915
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,596
We'll be down in a second.

916
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,274
I'll wait down here for you.

917
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:22,961
What now?

918
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:41,613
I swear, Evelyn,

919
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:44,533
if I find
one more red lipstick

920
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:47,318
melted in this dryer.

921
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:04,511
Hello?

922
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:08,390
Detective Kent, I just
found a tranquilizer dart

923
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,767
in Breanna's clothes.

924
01:02:10,853 --> 01:02:13,011
Evelyn said she went off
by herself yesterday

925
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:14,512
and--and wouldn't say
where she went,

926
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:17,348
but we know she knows
where Sarah-Louise lives.

927
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:19,234
-That's not all.
-What?

928
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,319
The neighbors reported seeing
a strange car in the area

929
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:24,573
right around the same time
Sarah-Louise was killed.

930
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,408
It matches Mindy's car.

931
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,368
Lucy, would--would
Breanna have a key?

932
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,746
No, I--I borrowed
Mindy's keys

933
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:32,530
when I went to grab
her address book.

934
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:34,082
I have 'em right here.

935
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:36,501
They're not in my purse.

936
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:38,870
I just had them.

937
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:43,049
I caught Breanna making a phone
call to someone last night,

938
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:45,886
and we got in an argument
and she said--

939
01:02:46,013 --> 01:02:48,213
she said she wished
she never had a mom.

940
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:49,681
Here's what you're gonna do.

941
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:52,309
Call Child Protection Services
and tell 'em

942
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:55,645
you're surrendering custody
of Breanna immediately.

943
01:02:55,731 --> 01:02:57,055
They'll send
somebody to get her.

944
01:02:57,149 --> 01:02:58,982
Evelyn's gonna be heartbroken.

945
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:00,942
Well, she'll have you
to get her through it, okay?

946
01:03:01,028 --> 01:03:02,060
Call me if you need anything.

947
01:03:02,154 --> 01:03:04,821
Okay, thank you.

948
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:10,035
Hi, I am looking for
Child Protection Services.

949
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,736
I need to surrender
my temporary custody

950
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,571
of a minor.

951
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:15,073
Her name's Breanna McMillen.

952
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:17,125
Do you have her file?

953
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:18,919
Okay, good.

954
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:22,130
How soon can you send
someone to pick her up?

955
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:23,924
Okay, great.

956
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:25,083
Thank you so much.
Yes, I--

957
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:28,386
-Mom, what are you doing?
-Evelyn, I'm sorry.

958
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:30,088
But she cannot stay here.

959
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:31,089
I know how much
you care about her,

960
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:33,016
but it is not safe.

961
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:38,563
Evelyn, you have
to trust me here.

962
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:40,023
I have your best interest
in heart.

963
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:42,267
-Sweetie, it's not safe.
-Not safe, not safe.

964
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:43,235
Mom, what are you
talking about?

965
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,529
Why did you make us
stay inside?

966
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,573
Hi.

967
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:50,242
Breanna.

968
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:51,618
Hi.

969
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:53,954
Your tea's ready.

970
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:55,247
Thank you.

971
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,282
We were just talking
about you, actually.

972
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,837
All good things?

973
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:03,454
Yes, of course.

974
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:22,190
Care to share?

975
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:46,631
-Ow!
-Bree!

976
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:49,667
Are you okay?

977
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,838
Mm-hm.

978
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:56,674
It's not that deep.

979
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:57,675
Looks like you need a Band-Aid.

980
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,644
-Here, I'll help.
-Nope. Breanna's got it.

981
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:01,730
The Band-Aids are in the
bathroom medicine cabinet,

982
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:03,732
top shelf.

983
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,616
Breanna.

984
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:15,702
The knife.

985
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:20,248
Right, here you go.

986
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:52,739
Mindy's cousin is dead.

987
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:55,909
That's why you made us
stay inside?

988
01:05:56,036 --> 01:05:58,119
That doesn't mean
someone wants to kill Breanna.

989
01:05:58,205 --> 01:05:59,537
Who would want
to kill Breanna?

990
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:00,956
That's not what I mean.

991
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,874
There are signs,
evidence even,

992
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,543
that Breanna
might be involved.

993
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:06,911
No.

994
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:08,413
No, Bree wouldn't
kill anybody.

995
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:10,081
I don't know that.

996
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:12,250
She might be sick,
she might need help,

997
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:15,586
but if she's dangerous,
she can't stay here.

998
01:06:15,681 --> 01:06:17,681
We can't send her away,
not now.

999
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:19,090
Not after everything
we've been through.

1000
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:22,093
I'm sorry, I know this is hard,
but I need to keep you safe.

1001
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:25,438
You are the most important thing
in the world to me.

1002
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,432
You can't do this!
You know what she means to me!

1003
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:29,109
We're best friends.

1004
01:06:29,236 --> 01:06:30,435
I'm--I'm nothing without her.

1005
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:33,655
She's made you feel that way
so she can use you.

1006
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,658
No.

1007
01:06:38,245 --> 01:06:39,703
No.

1008
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:42,947
If she's going,
I'm going too.

1009
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:46,584
Evelyn, she is not your friend.

1010
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,128
You're wrong.

1011
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:50,088
She's my best friend forever.

1012
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:51,089
Forever and ever.

1013
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:52,123
Bree!

1014
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:55,960
It's gonna be okay, okay?

1015
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,095
Evelyn.

1016
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:57,781
Hey.

1017
01:07:57,866 --> 01:08:00,158
CPS is gonna be here soon,
so I'm gonna go help Breanna

1018
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:01,159
-gather up her things.
-No, I should be the one

1019
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,327
-to tell her.
-Nope.

1020
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:04,871
-You're gonna stay here.
-No, she's my friend.

1021
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:07,540
Stay here.

1022
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,780
Breanna, are you okay?

1023
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:41,282
I need to talk to you.

1024
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:20,738
Where is she?
Where'd she go?

1025
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:22,407
"Dear Ms. Hayden,
I didn't tell you

1026
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:23,408
how to contact
my mom's cousin

1027
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,443
because I wanted to stay
with you and Evelyn

1028
01:09:25,537 --> 01:09:28,037
and not have to move away
and start over again.

1029
01:09:28,123 --> 01:09:30,114
You said you loved me,
but now you're sending me away.

1030
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:32,500
I was right about
never wanting a mom again.

1031
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:34,285
I'm leaving.
You'll never see me again.

1032
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,587
Breanna."

1033
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:39,507
Sh--she's gone?

1034
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:42,343
I'll have to call
CPS and the police.

1035
01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:44,762
They're gonna go
have to look for her.

1036
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:48,975
She--she left me?

1037
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:51,269
No, I don't believe it.

1038
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:53,304
We're best friends,
she said so.

1039
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:54,397
Evelyn.

1040
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:56,774
This is all your fault.

1041
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,026
What? No.

1042
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:00,737
I'm never gonna see my best
friend again because of you!

1043
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:02,647
I need her!
I'm nothing without her.

1044
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:04,482
-Evelyn, it's gonna be--
-No!

1045
01:10:07,996 --> 01:10:09,820
-Evelyn.
-I'm sorry.

1046
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:11,822
Evelyn. Evelyn,
we need to talk about this.

1047
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:13,157
-It won't happen again.
-No, I don't care about that.

1048
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:14,992
-I need to be alone right now.
-I don't think that's a good--

1049
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:17,328
I need to be alone!

1050
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:23,834
Okay, well, I have
some calls to make.

1051
01:10:23,929 --> 01:10:25,511
You promise me
you're gonna be okay?

1052
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:29,015
And do you promise you're
gonna stay in this room?

1053
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:31,008
I'll be fine.

1054
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,843
Give me your phone.

1055
01:10:32,938 --> 01:10:35,396
Give me your phone.

1056
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:04,342
Hey, there's gonna be
a little change of plans.

1057
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:05,677
Is that okay?

1058
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:06,844
Yeah.

1059
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:09,097
Sure, sure,
whatever you need.

1060
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,183
Hey.

1061
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:18,856
Yesterday was really amazing.

1062
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:23,227
I, um, I've never
done that before.

1063
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:25,863
It--yeah, it was--
it was amazing.

1064
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,284
And I haven't either.

1065
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:30,234
Ever.

1066
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:31,286
So...

1067
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:32,662
I love you.

1068
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,576
Don't say that.

1069
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,244
Please.

1070
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:44,382
-But what I--
-Just...don't.

1071
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:45,300
Okay?

1072
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:51,764
Everyone that says
they love me leaves me.

1073
01:11:53,685 --> 01:11:55,643
Or they die.

1074
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,064
Okay.

1075
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,316
Yeah, yeah,
whatever you want.

1076
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,111
We need to get
to Long Leaf Drive.

1077
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:09,106
No problem.

1078
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,647
She needs time.

1079
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:44,108
Just give her time.

1080
01:13:28,655 --> 01:13:31,114
What's going on
in that head of yours?

1081
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:58,683
Hello?

1082
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,386
Who's out there?

1083
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:11,729
Lucy, it's Detective Kent,
let me in.

1084
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:14,231
Lucy?

1085
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,928
Detective Kent, what is it?
Did you find Breanna?

1086
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:38,806
No, but we found a boy
from her high school.

1087
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:39,932
His name is Alex.

1088
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,425
Alex Tyler?

1089
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:42,760
Yeah, he's dead.

1090
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:44,604
And we found this
in his hand.

1091
01:14:44,731 --> 01:14:45,897
I didn't want
to believe it, but...

1092
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,607
It's worse than that.
Turn it over.

1093
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,735
Th--this is Evelyn's pendant.

1094
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:51,652
Evelyn never takes it off.

1095
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:53,437
-Yeah. Where is she now?
-She's upstairs.

1096
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:55,272
We had a fight and--
oh God.

1097
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:58,993
Evelyn?

1098
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:17,929
Evelyn? Evelyn?

1099
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,797
Are you in there?
Open this door!

1100
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:21,632
Here, let me.

1101
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:32,643
I would have seen her
if she left.

1102
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:35,029
I've--I've had her phone
the whole time.

1103
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:38,983
Been downstairs
the whole time and--

1104
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:49,493
She could have used
the email app on the computer.

1105
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:50,795
She must have gone over
the railing.

1106
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:51,829
Yeah.

1107
01:15:51,923 --> 01:15:52,663
It's a straight drop.

1108
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:55,299
Evelyn's terrified
of heights.

1109
01:15:55,385 --> 01:15:58,386
Well, she must have really
wanted to go to Breanna.

1110
01:16:05,103 --> 01:16:08,178
So, Breanna enticed Evelyn
out to kidnap her?

1111
01:16:08,273 --> 01:16:10,347
But why?
I don't understand.

1112
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:12,016
I don't know either.

1113
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:14,685
All I know is,
Alex's car is missing,

1114
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:15,778
presume Breanna took it.

1115
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:18,188
Lucy, do you have any idea
where they could be?

1116
01:16:18,283 --> 01:16:20,283
I don't know.
I mean...

1117
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:23,027
Breanna could have
tried to go home.

1118
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:24,912
I already sent people
over there.

1119
01:16:24,998 --> 01:16:26,530
Said the place was dark.

1120
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:28,207
There's no sign of anybody.

1121
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:31,502
Look, we'll keep
everybody updated

1122
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:33,203
and we'll keep looking,
okay?

1123
01:16:33,298 --> 01:16:34,371
-I'm going out, too.
-No, you're not.

1124
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:37,041
Breanna is disturbed,
a very dangerous girl.

1125
01:16:37,135 --> 01:16:40,052
I can't just sit here
and wait.

1126
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:41,879
I'm sorry, it's too dangerous.

1127
01:16:41,973 --> 01:16:44,432
You need to stay here
and let us handle this.

1128
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,226
You'll call me
as soon as you hear anything.

1129
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:49,103
Yeah, I will.

1130
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:51,564
Thank you, Detective.

1131
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:48,663
Breanna!

1132
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:57,171
Detective Kent, leave a message.

1133
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:59,340
Detective Kent,
I'm at the McMillens'.

1134
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:00,624
I drove by
and the lights are on.

1135
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:01,884
I think that Breanna is here.

1136
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:02,927
Please.

1137
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:04,628
Please hurry.

1138
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:13,804
Breanna?

1139
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:21,645
Breanna?

1140
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:40,998
Evelyn, Evelyn, Evelyn.

1141
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:43,050
Evelyn, I'm gonna get you
out of here, sweetie,

1142
01:18:43,136 --> 01:18:44,093
don't worry.

1143
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:45,502
Don't worry,
don't worry!

1144
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:46,470
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

1145
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:47,346
Breanna!

1146
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:50,182
Breanna, you don't
have to do this!

1147
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:51,842
What? What?

1148
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:53,510
-What happened?
-I'm covered in gasoline.

1149
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:55,521
We have to get out of here.

1150
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:56,847
I don't under--what happened?

1151
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:58,515
I don't understand.

1152
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:00,184
I don't know.

1153
01:19:00,278 --> 01:19:02,153
Evie messaged me
on the app and said

1154
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:03,696
she figured out a way
I didn't have to go

1155
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:04,855
and needed to see me,

1156
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:08,358
so I had Alex take me
to where she said to meet.

1157
01:19:08,453 --> 01:19:10,861
She was so mad I was with him,
she shot him.

1158
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:13,330
What? I--I don't know.

1159
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:16,125
How could--how could
she do this?

1160
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:17,868
I don't know.

1161
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:20,871
It takes a smart brunette
to play a dumb blonde.

1162
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:22,873
Evelyn!

1163
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:24,708
You can't be here.

1164
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,210
You shouldn't be here.

1165
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:31,974
I know that
you're scared, sweetie.

1166
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:32,975
I just--I want to help you.

1167
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,551
Put that down.

1168
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:37,146
You don't want to help me.

1169
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:38,147
You want to keep us apart.

1170
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:40,557
You and everyone
wants to keep us apart.

1171
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:43,068
Ms. McMillen
and then Sarah-Louise

1172
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:45,780
and then Alex
and now you.

1173
01:19:45,865 --> 01:19:48,282
I just want you
to be happy, sweetie.

1174
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:49,283
If you wanted me to be happy,

1175
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:51,535
you wouldn't try
to take Bree from me.

1176
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,204
I need her.
I'm nothing without her.

1177
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,331
Nothing!

1178
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:56,406
Bree.

1179
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:02,087
I'll make sure that we'll
never be apart ever again.

1180
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:05,415
It'll be like
you always talked about.

1181
01:20:07,512 --> 01:20:11,639
Evie, please don't do this.

1182
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:19,563
With the clouds
all around and...

1183
01:20:19,649 --> 01:20:22,099
and the stars up above.

1184
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:28,939
First you and then me.

1185
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:30,407
And then we'll always
be together.

1186
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:32,442
What--what are you saying?

1187
01:20:32,537 --> 01:20:35,746
It's just like
you always said, Bree.

1188
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:38,499
We are all of us stars.

1189
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:40,784
We deserve to twinkle.

1190
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:45,381
Best friends.

1191
01:20:45,466 --> 01:20:47,624
Forever and ever.

1192
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:53,055
Evelyn, no!

1193
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:04,984
Evelyn.

1194
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:07,644
Evelyn.

1195
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:09,405
I never wanted any of this.

1196
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:11,982
I know, I'm sorry
I thought it was you.

1197
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:13,784
I have been so blind.

1198
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:16,153
I should have known,
I should have seen.

1199
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:17,997
-I didn't see it either.
-Lucy!

1200
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:19,665
Lucy, are you okay?

1201
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,326
It was Evelyn--
she confessed.

1202
01:21:25,423 --> 01:21:26,922
She's alive.

1203
01:21:27,008 --> 01:21:28,999
Call for an ambulance
right now.

1204
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:31,343
It's gonna be okay, Evie.

1205
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,012
It's gonna be okay, Evie.

1206
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:37,674
We're gonna get you
all the help you need.

1207
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:39,018
I promise.

1208
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:44,023
It's okay.

1209
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:46,191
It's gonna be okay.

1210
01:22:16,933 --> 01:22:20,217
Excuse me, do you know
where I can find Evelyn Hayden?

1211
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:22,770
I believe she's over there.

1212
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:09,608
The doctors say
you're doing really well.

1213
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:16,824
Seems like you've made
a lot of friends.

1214
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:19,326
Oh, but I'm not--I mean, I--

1215
01:23:19,412 --> 01:23:21,453
I like them all the same.

1216
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,080
Except maybe Tyler.

1217
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:26,783
-You like Tyler more?
-No, less.

1218
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:31,422
He--he can be annoying,
but only sometimes.

1219
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:34,291
I think that's
more than fair.

1220
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:40,055
I'm sorry.

1221
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:43,133
I'm sorry I--

1222
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:45,811
I did such terrible things.

1223
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:48,897
And I don't even--
I didn't even want to, really,

1224
01:23:48,983 --> 01:23:52,609
I just--I don't--
I don't know why I did.

1225
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:54,069
I'm sorry too.

1226
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:57,948
I should have known.

1227
01:23:58,034 --> 01:24:01,485
I should have seen it.
I don't know how I missed it.

1228
01:24:01,579 --> 01:24:04,079
I guess I just wanted
to think that...

1229
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:08,992
But I should have
made you get help.

1230
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:13,163
And I know now
I'm gonna do everything

1231
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:15,832
I can to help you.

1232
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:20,504
I'm still here for you

1233
01:24:20,598 --> 01:24:24,341
and I still love you
just the same.

1234
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:25,342
How?

1235
01:24:28,522 --> 01:24:30,272
After everything I did.

1236
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:34,902
Moms always love their kids.

1237
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:37,854
Always.

1238
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:38,947
Always.

1239
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:44,745
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, sweetie.

1240
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:47,372
I'm sorry.

1241
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,166
I'm sorry too.

1242
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:53,036
-I love you.
-I love you.

1243
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:58,542
-It's gonna be okay.
-I'm sorry.

1244
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:02,212
I love you.

1245
01:25:06,644 --> 01:25:08,393
So what do you want to do?

1246
01:25:08,521 --> 01:25:09,520
Um, let's go ride bikes.

1247
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,054
-Yes.
-Yeah?

1248
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:13,273
Oh, I'll be right back.

1249
01:25:15,236 --> 01:25:16,276
Hi.

1250
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:20,564
Uh, how's Evelyn doing?

1251
01:25:20,658 --> 01:25:22,783
She's doing better, much better.

1252
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:25,577
The doctors are really pleased
with her progress.

1253
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,038
That's good.

1254
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:29,164
Um...

1255
01:25:31,127 --> 01:25:33,585
I can't help but feel like
part of this was my fault.

1256
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:35,462
You can't blame yourself.

1257
01:25:35,548 --> 01:25:38,257
Evelyn's disorder progressed
incredibly quickly,

1258
01:25:38,384 --> 01:25:40,134
turning a normal friendship
into an obsession

1259
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:42,970
in a matter of weeks,
maybe even days.

1260
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:45,389
They--they said
we couldn't have expected

1261
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:48,809
or predicted any of this.

1262
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,727
Thank you.

1263
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:53,438
I--I think I really
needed to hear that.

1264
01:25:57,027 --> 01:26:01,655
I better go, but I'll see you
later, okay?

1265
01:26:03,284 --> 01:26:05,450
Thank you for everything.

1266
01:26:13,544 --> 01:26:14,918
I got you something.

1267
01:26:15,004 --> 01:26:16,295
What is it?

1268
01:26:16,422 --> 01:26:17,621
You're gonna really like it.

1269
01:26:17,715 --> 01:26:19,006
-Show me!
-Okay.

1270
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:22,968
Oh my gosh, Breanna.

1271
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:24,678
It's perfect.

1272
01:26:25,723 --> 01:26:27,181
-I love it so much.
-You like it?

1273
01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:28,390
It's my favorite colors.

1274
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:30,300
I know, I know you.

1275
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:31,560
Thank you.

1276
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:32,636
This is so sweet.

1277
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:34,438
Of course.
