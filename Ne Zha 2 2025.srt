00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:01,444
Blessed be the heavens and the earth,

2
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:04,468
The Chaos Pearl is born.

3
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,492
The Great God split it in two.

4
00:02:08,516 --> 00:02:10,516
The heavenly energy within it
becomes the Spirit Pearl,

5
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,540
while evil energy forms a Devil Ball.

6
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:17,464
The curse of heavenly wrath
was cast upon the Devil Ball,

7
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:21,488
ready to be destroyed by lightning in 3 years.

8
00:02:22,412 --> 00:02:25,412
Later, due to Shen Gongbao's intervention,

9
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:30,436
The Demon Ball reincarnated into Nezha,
the third son of Li Jing in Chentang Pass.

10
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,460
The Spirit Pearl became Ao Bing,
who was also the third son of the Dragon King.

11
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:37,484
Because of destiny,

12
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:40,408
the two became friends.

13
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:44,432
Nezha, influenced by his parents,

14
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,456
letting go of his demonic nature,

15
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,480
and save the Chentang Line.

16
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:51,404
Together with Ao Bing,

17
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:53,428
they face the Wrath of Heaven,

18
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:55,452
and finally

19
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:59,476
change their destiny.

<font color="#ff8040">NE ZHA 2</font>

22
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:17,424
Although saved from wrath,

23
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,448
your bodies are destroyed...

24
00:03:19,472 --> 00:03:21,472
without that

25
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:24,496
The soul will disappear into nothingness.

26
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,420
The Sacred Lotus protects and guards the spirit.

27
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:29,444
Now I will use it
to recreate

28
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:32,468
your physical form.

29
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,492
Wow.

30
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:03,516
Amazing.

31
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,540
Start!

32
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:41,464
Something is wrong.
/ Is there?

33
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:43,488
This lotus root must be made into a dough
to make your body.

34
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:46,412
Have you been scratching your feet with your hands?

35
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:48,436
Oh, don't worry.

36
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,460
It's okay if my feet are sticky,
a little rinse will clean them.

37
00:04:50,484 --> 00:04:53,484
It's not your feet I'm thinking about.

38
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:56,408
Do you blow your nose with your hand?

39
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:58,432
No, nothing.

40
00:04:58,456 --> 00:05:00,456
Just lotus dough.
See?

41
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Lotus dough.

42
00:05:02,504 --> 00:05:04,504
Ready to pour.

43
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:06,428
Come on, come on.

44
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:09,452
One snot for each of you.
I mean, one serving.

45
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,476
Hurry! To save your souls.

46
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
I don't think so.
/ Annoying kid!

47
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:23,424
It worked!

48
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,448
Just a moment.

49
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:27,472
What is this?
/ Thanks,

50
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:30,496
I've been looking for this for a while.

51
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,420
It's time for formation.

52
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:39,444
The Flying Pig's memory is truly unmatched,

53
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:43,468
this is his carving skill.

54
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:46,492
Perfect renovation, right?

55
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,416
Thank you, Pig.

56
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Don't move, it's not fixed yet.

57
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:59,464
Guru Dewa,
I have deployed the entire Chentang army

58
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:01,488
to protect against Shen Gongbao and
the East Sea dragons.

59
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:02,512
Take it easy.

60
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,536
The dragon is watching over the monsters of Hell,

61
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
none of them could escape.

62
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:08,584
Shen Gongbao himself was not a threat.

63
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:10,408
You have to see this.

64
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:12,432
Isn't this perfect?

65
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,456
Whoa!

66
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
I learned from the expert.

67
00:06:16,504 --> 00:06:18,504
But, does it have to be exactly the same?

68
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:20,528
Can't you make me look prettier?
/ Huh?

69
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:24,452
Yes, that's right.

70
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:26,476
Parents always wish
the best for their children, huh?

71
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Correct.

72
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:29,524
Make me tall and strong.

73
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:31,548
Also very handsome.

74
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:33,572
A man must be strong and fierce.

75
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:36,496
Also polite and attentive.

76
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,520
But also cute and adorable.

77
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:41,444
Can you stand up for yourself?

78
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,468
Tall and muscular.

79
00:06:43,492 --> 00:06:46,492
With a touch of handsomeness.
/ Strong and fierce.

80
00:06:46,516 --> 00:06:48,516
But very adorable.

81
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
What's this?

82
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:55,464
Then start showing your skills.
/ Come on!

83
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:57,488
I should have done it a long time ago.

84
00:06:57,512 --> 00:07:00,412
Fixing it yourself is always best.
/ This must take a long time.

85
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:03,436
Let's do your work first.

86
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,460
You were born from the water element,
so you must be tempered with pure water.

87
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:26,484
The lotus is open!

88
00:07:33,408 --> 00:07:35,408
Here he is.

89
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:37,432
Are you done?

90
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:40,456
Almost.

91
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
This version is definitely the most fascinating,

92
00:07:46,504 --> 00:07:50,404
but it takes a long time to perfect it.

93
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,428
How about we
use the first one for now?

94
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:54,452
Yeah, the first version is okay too.

95
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:56,476
I agree.

96
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Good.

97
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:02,424
You were born of the fire element,

98
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,448
then you must be polished in pure fire.

99
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:14,472
Sir!

100
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:17,496
Enemies were seen in the sea.
It seemed to be Shen Gongbao.

101
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
How many?
/ Just him.

102
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:21,444
How come?

103
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,468
Continue your spell.
We will overcome the intruder.

104
00:08:23,492 --> 00:08:25,492
Guru Dewa,
let me ask my teacher.

105
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:27,516
Don't move!
Before the incense stick burns out,

106
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,540
your body is not getting better.

Shen Gongbao, what is required
for us to receive this honor?

109
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:05,412
Now that you know my plans with the dragon.

110
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:09,436
I can't deny that I'm... a little nervous.

111
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,460
The Chentang Line is tightly guarded,

112
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,484
and Master Taiyi in the city.

113
00:09:13,508 --> 00:09:16,408
You're alone, you can't do much.

114
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:21,432
Who says... I'm alone?

{\an6}[2 HOURS AGO,

but the entire Eastern Dragon Clan

surrounded by all your old "friends".

126
00:09:42,524 --> 00:09:44,524
Just wait and see how we welcome you.

127
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:48,448
Trapped in the Dragon Palace...
how can you avenge your son?

128
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:51,472
I'm worried too.

129
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:04,496
You stupid dragons
don't deserve to be arrogant.

130
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
I'm just trying to help.

131
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:09,444
But it seems like you

132
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:11,468
I don't appreciate it.
/ Hmm?

133
00:10:20,492 --> 00:10:22,492
You must have forgotten my abilities.

134
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,416
Ah!

135
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
I know this one.

136

Thank You.

139
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:41,436
Master Shen can
bring this claw to the Chentang path,

140
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,460
and used it to
tear open a rift that led back to me.

141
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:52,484
Then the Hell Monster can
help destroy your enemies.

142

SKY-SPLITTING THUNDER WHIP

143
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:42,432
Hell Monster?

144
00:11:43,456 --> 00:11:44,456
How could it be?

145
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
They were trapped by
the Restraining Seal for thousands of years.

146
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:48,504
How could they possibly escape?

147
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:50,528
Dragon... have they been released by the Dragon?

148
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:52,552
With the Sea-Stabilizing Chain that binds us,

149
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:55,476
impossible to escape.

150
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,400
This is a tactic that benefits everyone.

151
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:01,424
What do you think, my brother?

152
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:04,448
You won't be that good.

153
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:06,472
Straight to the point.

154
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:08,496
What is your request?

155
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,420
In this purgatory,

156
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:13,444
where fire burns our bodies,

157
00:12:13,468 --> 00:12:15,468
A day feels like a year.

158
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:17,492
If you could turn down the heat of this lava a little,

159
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:20,416
ease our suffering,

160
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,440
We are ready to serve you
with all our strength.

161
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:27,464
What happened?

162
00:12:27,488 --> 00:12:29,488
What is Shen Gongbao planning now?

163
00:12:37,412 --> 00:12:39,412
Finally we're out! Hooray!

164
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:42,436
Wow!

165
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,460
Like that.

166
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:51,484
We're done.
How do I explain this to General Li now?

167
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,508
Luckily no one saw us.

168
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:54,732
Here.
/ What for?

169
00:12:54,756 --> 00:12:56,756
I'll break your arm
and then you'll break my leg.

170
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,780
We'll say Yaksha did it.
/ Oh.

171
00:12:58,804 --> 00:13:00,504
When the general saw
how badly injured we were,

172
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:02,428
He won't blame us anymore.

173
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:04,452
Try hard.
/ Hit it hard!

174
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:09,476
Hey!

175
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Hey!

176
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,424
Hey, you two!

177
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:18,448
Guru Dewa, you're here!

178
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:19,472
Hee hee hee!

179
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:20,496
Hahahaha!

180
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,520
He let Yaksha escape!
/ Huh?

181
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:25,444
It's your fault.

182
00:13:25,468 --> 00:13:27,468
Who are you pointing at?
/ Who are you to pretend to be innocent?

183
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:33,492
Oh my,
the idiot and the moron!

184
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:34,516
Hey!

185
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,540
You guys are stupid!

186
00:13:36,564 --> 00:13:38,564
Get out of here and protect me!

187
00:13:38,588 --> 00:13:40,588
Yes sir, right away!

188
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:52,412
Don't forgive.

189
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:48,436
Shen Gongbao!
Ao Bing belum mati.

190
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,460
Chentang and the dragon paths
have no reason to fight.

191
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,484
Taiyi was reshaping Ao Bing's body.

192
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:58,408
Lie!

193
00:15:59,432 --> 00:16:00,432
Hmm?

194
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:02,456
The dome shield...

195
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
Oh no!

196
00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:21,404
Teacher!

197
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:23,428
Teacher!

198
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:24,452
Ao Bing!

199
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:26,476
Master Taiyi shaped a new body for me.

200
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
/ Shen GongBao
,

201
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:30,524
I saved your student.
Don't you thank me?

202
00:16:30,548 --> 00:16:31,548
So,

203
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:34,472
Who is that in there?

204
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,496
Why? You're so ungrateful!

205
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Teacher!

206
00:16:39,544 --> 00:16:41,544
They must die!

207
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:48,468
Hahahaha!

208
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:50,492
Do you think you can break this protective shield?

209
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:52,516
Come on, hit me!

210
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
No!

211
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:55,464
That aura...

212
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:06,488
Ao Bing!
/ Father!

213
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:18,412
AO GUANG

214
00:18:18,436 --> 00:18:20,436
Dad!

215
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,460
My mission failed to save our people.

216
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:23,884
No.
It doesn't matter.

217
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:25,408
Dad just wants you to be safe.

218
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:28,432
As long as you are here,
that is enough for father.

219
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:38,456
The lotus is open!

220
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,480
Your body, what is this...
/ Understand, it is indeed "newborn".

221
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:50,404
How can he take a beating like that?

222
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:51,428
Ao Bing!

223
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:53,452
Hey! It's not ready yet!
Don't move! Don't move!

224
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:55,476
Ao Bing, why?

225
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Do not move before repair.

226
00:18:57,524 --> 00:18:59,524
If the body exceeds its limits,

227
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:01,548
will be destroyed!
By the gods...

228
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:03,472
Fat!

229
00:19:03,496 --> 00:19:05,496
Make another body...
make Ao Bing now!

230
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Huh?

231
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:08,544
Create two bodies in sequence

232
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:11,468
clearly draining the energy of the Sacred Lotus.
/ Without a body, won't the soul scatter?

233
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:13,492
Teacher, do something!
/ Without the Sacred Lotus,

234
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:15,516
I can't do anything.

235
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,440
No problem.

236
00:19:17,464 --> 00:19:19,464
I replaced you as the Spirit Pearl,
I deserve this.

237
00:19:20,488 --> 00:19:22,488
If my sacrifice

238
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:25,412
can bring you back to life,
then it's worth it.

239
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:28,436
Who told you to do that?
I'm happy being the Devil Ball.

240
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,460
Don't try to die!

241
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:32,484
Dad,

242
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:35,408
Please save the Chentang Line.

243
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:38,432
We must stop making mistakes.

244
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:42,456
This is my last request.

245
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,480
There must be another way.
There must be!

246
00:19:50,504 --> 00:19:52,504
You, try again!

247
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:55,428
Let Ao Bing share your body for now.
Share your body.

248
00:19:55,452 --> 00:19:58,452
2 souls share 1 body,

249
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:00,476
rejection is inevitable.

250
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Spirit Pearls and Devil Balls come from the same source.

251
00:20:02,524 --> 00:20:05,424
Sharing one body
for 7 days would be no problem.

252
00:20:05,448 --> 00:20:07,448
Yes, that's it!
Ao Bing, come in!

253
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,472
Fast!

254
00:20:09,496 --> 00:20:11,496
Good.

255
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,420
This feels... weird...

256
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:21,444
Ao Bing, are you here?
/ Yes.

257
00:20:21,468 --> 00:20:23,468
I can hear your voice in my head.

258
00:20:23,492 --> 00:20:24,492
This is exciting!

259
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:27,416
But this is only a temporary fix.

260
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
What will happen after 7 days?

261
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:31,464
There is medicine in the safe of Yu Xu Palace.

262
00:20:31,488 --> 00:20:33,488
Reparo Miracle Medicine.

263
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:35,512
It can restore the power of magical objects.

264
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:36,936
With that,

265
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,460
The Holy Lotus will bloom again.

266
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:42,484
But how do you get it?

267
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,508
I myself will go to the Great God
and beg.

268
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:47,432
Or are you planning
to report me and the dragons?

269
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:52,456
The Great God would not want to...
save a dragon child.

270
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
If my request is unsuccessful,
then we'll just take it.

271
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:57,404
The Yu Xu Palace is in the center of the Chan Sect,

272
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:59,428
protected by a great power.
/ For the sake of my son,

273
00:20:59,452 --> 00:21:02,452
I am willing to break through the Heavenly Palace if necessary.

274
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:05,476
Your Majesty, please calm down.
Maybe I have a plan.

275
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Chan's disciples were expelled from training

276
00:21:07,524 --> 00:21:10,424
can take part in the Promotion Exam.

277
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:13,448
Passing the test not only receives immortality,

278
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,472
but also have the right to choose

279
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:19,496
one magical item from Yu Xu's Vault as a reward.

280
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Do you suggest
Nezha take the exam?

281
00:21:21,544 --> 00:21:23,544
to get the magic medicine?
/ No, no, no!

282
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:26,468
He's emitting demonic energy!
Once he uses his power, he'll be exposed!

283
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:28,492
Isn't Ao Bing one body with Nezha?

284
00:21:28,516 --> 00:21:30,516
His divine aura could perfectly cover the Demon energy.

285
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,440
As long as he passes the test in 7 days,

286
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:37,464
we don't just get that magic... medicine...

287
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:39,488
But he can also...
/ Gain immortality!

288
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:42,412
So I'm not a Devil anymore?

289
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:45,436
This will save Ao Bing as well as Nezha.

290
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,460
Everyone... is satisfied.

291
00:21:48,484 --> 00:21:50,484
This is not the right action.

292
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,508
So what is your suggestion?

293
00:21:52,532 --> 00:21:54,532
Follow the rules.

294
00:21:54,556 --> 00:21:56,556
Be honest with the Supreme God.

295
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,580
and trust his decision.

296
00:21:58,604 --> 00:22:00,604
My wife and I will also ask for forgiveness,

297
00:22:00,628 --> 00:22:04,428
so that the sins of the parents do not affect their children.

298
00:22:04,452 --> 00:22:06,452
Ordinary people,

299
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:08,476
you only experience life for tens of years,

300
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,400
How dare you lecture me on morals?

301
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:20,424
Longer than I can remember,

302
00:22:20,448 --> 00:22:23,448
I have lived for thousands of years.

303
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:26,472
Let me just tell you one fact.

304
00:22:26,496 --> 00:22:29,496
If my son dies,

305
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,420
I will sink the Chentang Line with him.

306
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:41,444
Stop!

307
00:22:41,468 --> 00:22:43,468
Ao Bing is my friend.

308
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:45,492
I will definitely save him.

309
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:47,516
But if you try to harm the Chentang Line,

310
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,540
I will destroy your Dragon Palace

311
00:22:49,564 --> 00:22:52,464
to pieces!

312
00:22:56,488 --> 00:22:58,488
Selain Nezha and Taiyi,

313
00:22:58,512 --> 00:23:01,412
From now on, no one can
leave the Chentang Line.

314
00:23:01,436 --> 00:23:04,436
If in 7 days I don't see the Reparo Miracle Medicine

315
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,460
or news about my clan spreads,

316
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:09,484
I will leave the Chentang Line

317
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:11,508
sink forever.

318
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,432
I don't trust all my relatives,

319
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:17,456
and I can't stay out of my body for long .

320
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
The Fate of the Chentang Line

321
00:23:19,504 --> 00:23:21,504
is in your hands.

322
00:23:25,428 --> 00:23:27,428
Yes,
that is true.

323
00:23:27,452 --> 00:23:29,452
No message delivered

324
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,476
just by nodding.

325
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Tuan Li,

326
00:23:39,424 --> 00:23:42,424
We are all here to say goodbye
to Young Master Nezha.

327
00:23:42,448 --> 00:23:46,448
We want to thank him
for saving the entire city.

328
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:48,472
You are very kind.
My son has caused a lot of trouble.

329
00:23:48,496 --> 00:23:50,496
for years.

330
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,420
I knew from the beginning that Young Master
was destined for greatness.

331
00:23:54,444 --> 00:23:57,444
Look at him, his forehead is wide,

332
00:23:57,468 --> 00:24:00,468
His face is wide,
his nose is prominent,

333
00:24:00,492 --> 00:24:02,492
chubby cheeks and thick lips.

334
00:24:02,516 --> 00:24:05,416
All signs of a true hero!

335
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,440
I never judge a face wrongly.

336
00:24:11,464 --> 00:24:15,464
Young Master, don't forget to brush your teeth after eating!

337
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,488
Bos,

338
00:24:17,512 --> 00:24:20,412
Demon Hunters has now changed its name
to Nezha Gang.

339
00:24:20,436 --> 00:24:23,436
All members will obey your orders.

340
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,460
Young Master, do you want to learn calligraphy?

341
00:24:25,484 --> 00:24:27,484
I'm here for you!
/ Young Master, you're already 3 years old.

342
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,508
It's time to find a girlfriend.
/ Interested in musical instruments?

343
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:31,532
We are skilled in all tools.

344
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:34,456
I want to

345
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
play badminton.

346
00:24:37,404 --> 00:24:38,404
What?

347
00:24:38,428 --> 00:24:40,428
This is exciting.

348
00:24:40,452 --> 00:24:42,452
Anyone want it?

349
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:46,476
Dad will play with you.

350
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,400
Haven't you always wanted to play badminton with dad?

351
00:24:49,424 --> 00:24:50,424
Who...

352
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,448
the kick was a bit hard.

353
00:24:52,472 --> 00:24:53,472
Hahahaha!

354
00:24:53,496 --> 00:24:55,496
I am a war general!

355
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
Dad.

356
00:24:58,444 --> 00:25:00,444
That's just my son!

357
00:25:01,468 --> 00:25:02,968
How about...
we play another day?

358
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:04,492
Impossible!

359
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:06,516
Why stop when you're having fun?

360
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,540
It's okay, it's okay.

361
00:25:08,564 --> 00:25:09,564
I'm coming too!

362
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:11,588
My wife, you don't have to do this.
/ Are you looking down on me?

363
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:13,412
I'm a war general too!

364
00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:15,436
Nezha, catch this!

365
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,460
Son, why didn't you catch him?

366
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:22,484
If only I wasn't the Devil Ball...

367
00:25:22,508 --> 00:25:24,508
What?
/ It's nothing.

368
00:25:24,532 --> 00:25:26,532
Time to go.

369
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:29,456
Before you go,
would you mind

370
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,480
Hugging mom?

371
00:25:34,404 --> 00:25:36,404
Don't worry, many people have seen it.

372
00:25:38,428 --> 00:25:40,428
Wait.

373
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:42,452
This is a snack made by mom.

374
00:25:42,476 --> 00:25:44,476
For you and your teacher on the go.

375
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Yes, yes.
We'll go first.

376
00:25:45,524 --> 00:25:47,524
Hey!
I haven't gotten on yet!

377
00:25:53,448 --> 00:25:55,448
Your body is not fully repaired yet.

378
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,472
Don't push yourself too hard.
/ Okay, okay.

379
00:25:57,496 --> 00:25:59,496
And watch your temper.

380
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,520
Stay calm out there.

381
00:26:01,544 --> 00:26:04,444
Without mother and father near you,

382
00:26:04,468 --> 00:26:07,468
Learn to take care of yourself.

383
00:26:07,492 --> 00:26:09,492
You are a silly boy.

384
00:26:09,516 --> 00:26:11,516
What's the problem with just hugging?

385
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,540
That's too much.
This isn't a goodbye anyway.

386
00:26:13,564 --> 00:26:15,564
Let's go.

387
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:24,488
<font color="#80ffff">VISITORBET</font>
►WE WILL PAY YOU NO MATTER WHATEVER YOU WIN◄
<font color="#80ffff">►search for us on Google: VISITORBET◄</font>

388
00:26:32,412 --> 00:26:33,812
Why are you sighing?
Does it feel bad?

389
00:26:33,836 --> 00:26:35,836
Eat, eat, eat.
You know, just eat.

390
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,860
Look at me.

391
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:39,484
I'm worried about eating!
Do you think how can I pass the exam?

392
00:26:41,408 --> 00:26:43,408
What's the test about?

393
00:26:43,432 --> 00:26:45,432
It will test your forging progress.

394
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:47,456
In front of the judges,

395
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
You must defeat, with your bare hands,
3 earth-monster level demon kings.

396
00:26:49,504 --> 00:26:50,504
Fight...

397
00:26:50,528 --> 00:26:53,428
that's my specialty.
/ But once you release demonic energy,

398
00:26:53,452 --> 00:26:55,452
your identity will be exposed.
/ Let Ao Bing control my body.

399
00:26:55,476 --> 00:26:57,476
He is the energy of the gods,
which is equally powerful.

400
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
It looks easy.

401
00:26:59,524 --> 00:27:01,524
Here, try it.

402
00:27:01,548 --> 00:27:03,548
Nezha, relax your whole body.

403
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:06,472
Let Ao Bing control
and fight me.

404
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,496
Ao Bing, what are you doing?
Stay straight!

405
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,520
That's how it is when one soul
resides in another person's body.

406
00:27:14,544 --> 00:27:16,544
Unless your determination is stronger than the body's owner,

407
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,468
you won't be able to have full control.

408
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:23,492
Nezha, defeated.

409
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,416
The harder you force,
the weaker Ao Bing's control becomes.

410
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
Use your feet!

411
00:27:28,464 --> 00:27:30,464
He's so complete, he's so complete!

412
00:27:38,488 --> 00:27:39,488
Do not panic!

413
00:27:39,512 --> 00:27:41,512
I'm coming...

414
00:27:43,436 --> 00:27:45,436
approaching you.

415
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,460
You're happy, huh?

416
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:54,484
We are almost at Yu Xu Palace,

417
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:56,508
and you're still playing around.
Look at you,

418
00:27:56,532 --> 00:27:58,532
What kind of mentor are you?
Stand here and reflect on your mistakes.

419
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:00,556
Don't eat until you know your mistake!

420
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,480
You adults,
don't be like reckless teenagers.

421
00:28:05,404 --> 00:28:06,404
I get it!

422
00:28:06,428 --> 00:28:09,428
Sleeping pills.

423
00:28:09,452 --> 00:28:10,452
What's that?

424
00:28:10,476 --> 00:28:12,476
Eat this, and you'll fall asleep soon.

425
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,400
Once you sleep,
Ao Bing can take full control of your body.

426
00:28:16,424 --> 00:28:18,424
Intelligent!

427
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,448
One is enough!

428
00:28:20,472 --> 00:28:22,472
You should have said... earlier.

429
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,496
Good.

430
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,420
Guru Taiyi?

431
00:28:35,444 --> 00:28:37,444
Now this feels right.

432
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:40,468
Why?

433
00:28:40,492 --> 00:28:41,492
Stay cool.

434
00:28:41,516 --> 00:28:45,416
I see you took over
Nezha's body completely.

435
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,440
Let's start again.

436
00:28:47,464 --> 00:28:50,464
This time, I won't hold back.

437
00:28:50,488 --> 00:28:53,488
You should also try your best.

438
00:29:04,412 --> 00:29:07,412
I beg for your guidance.
/ Not bad.

439
00:29:07,436 --> 00:29:09,436
Can barely match my abilities.

440
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,460
Master Taiyi, your nose is bleeding.

441
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,484
It's been hot lately.
Need some more drinking water.

442
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:16,508
No problem.

443
00:29:22,432 --> 00:29:25,432
Kunlun Mountain! Here we come.

444
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:28,456
I heard that one day here
is equal to a year in the human world.

445
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
Don't worry,
we're not in the heavenly realm yet.

446
00:29:30,504 --> 00:29:33,404
But these are many people.
/ They come to seek immortality.

447
00:29:33,428 --> 00:29:35,428
The Chan sect is famous throughout the world,
and everyone wants to join it.

448
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:39,452
Look at this, jasper.

449
00:29:39,476 --> 00:29:41,476
This is a sign of the eternal mandate of the Chan Sect.

450
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,400
With this,
you will be respected wherever you go.

451
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:46,424
Look,
being immortal is awesome.

452
00:29:46,448 --> 00:29:48,448
Both of your brothers have been promoted.

453
00:29:48,472 --> 00:29:50,472
You won't have any problems either.
I mean Nezha's brother.

454
00:29:50,496 --> 00:29:52,496
His two brothers

455
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,520
among the best third generation disciples.

456
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:55,544
Do you know

457
00:29:55,568 --> 00:29:57,568
How is Nezha always being naughty, huh?

458
00:29:57,592 --> 00:30:00,492
So, I often tell stories about his brother.

459
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:02,516
to be a good example for him.

460
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,440
Let me tell you something.
Nezha idolizes his brother.

462
00:30:28,488 --> 00:30:31,488
Oh wow, you're lucky
to meet the famous Demon Hunter.

463
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:34,412
Demon Hunters?
/ They roam the land, hunting

464
00:30:34,436 --> 00:30:36,436
a ghost that brings disaster to humans,

465
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,460
maintain world peace.

466
00:30:38,484 --> 00:30:40,484
Current Demon Hunter Leader

467
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:43,407
{\an6}DEER

468
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:42,508
top disciple of Wuliang God.

469
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:45,432
Wasn't his predecessor Shen Gongbao?

470
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:00,456
ISTANA YU XU

471
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Master Taiyi,
what is that smoke over there?

472
00:31:02,504 --> 00:31:03,504
Oh,

473
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,528
it was Yu Xu Palace's most prized possession.

474
00:31:05,552 --> 00:31:07,552
Tianyuan Crater.

475
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:19,376
DEWA WULIANG

476
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:18,476
Kak Taiyi, it's been a long time.

477
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Brother Wuliang, I heard that during Master's exile

478
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,424
You take care of Yu Xu Palace.

479
00:31:24,448 --> 00:31:26,448
I invite my students to take the Promotion Exam.

480
00:31:26,472 --> 00:31:29,472
Nezha, beri salam Guru Wuliang.

481
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:31,496
Guru Wuliang.

482
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
So, you're Nezha?
The reincarnation of the Spirit Pearl?

483
00:31:33,544 --> 00:31:35,444
Oh my!

484
00:31:35,468 --> 00:31:37,468
How amazing!

485
00:31:37,492 --> 00:31:41,492
The Great God has high hopes for you.

486
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:43,516
And you definitely won't be disappointed.

487
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,440
Look at him, his vitality is completely strong,

488
00:31:46,464 --> 00:31:48,464
emitting good vibrations.

489
00:31:57,488 --> 00:32:00,488
Lately, this boy has been practicing a lot.
His condition is not stable.

490
00:32:03,412 --> 00:32:04,712
What do you want to do?

491
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:06,436
This is Yu Xu Palace.

492
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,460
I need to pee.

493
00:32:08,484 --> 00:32:09,784
Crana.
/ Yeah.

494
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:12,408
{\an6}CRANA

495
00:32:09,785 --> 00:32:12,485
Take this child to the toilet (restroom).

496
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:14,509
Restroom?
I didn't say I wanted to rest.

497
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,533
You idiot!

498
00:32:16,557 --> 00:32:19,457
Toilet, that's where you pee.

499
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,481
This kid is a bit naughty.

500
00:32:22,505 --> 00:32:24,505
Please forgive him.

501
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:32,429
Wow!

502
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:34,453
Very white.

503
00:32:34,477 --> 00:32:36,477
So white!

504
00:32:37,401 --> 00:32:39,401
Wow!

505
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:40,425
So white!

506
00:32:40,449 --> 00:32:42,449
Is this entire palace made of jade?

507
00:32:42,473 --> 00:32:44,473
Where did they
get that much money to buy jade?

508
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:46,497
The word "Yu" in Xu Yu Palace means jade, right?

509
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:48,521
So what does "Xu" mean?

510
00:32:48,545 --> 00:32:49,545
Simple?

511
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:50,569
Feel guilty?

512
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,593
Or emptiness?

513
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:54,617
Is the toilet made of jade?

514
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,641
Do gods also need to pee?

515
00:32:56,665 --> 00:32:58,665
Did Teacher Wuliang also... poop?

516
00:32:59,489 --> 00:33:01,489
This is a place of exile.
Keep your voice down.

517
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,413
How far is this toilet?

518
00:33:04,437 --> 00:33:06,437
I can't take it anymore!
Hey, miss, wait!

519
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:10,461
You...

520
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:12,485
I didn't mean to.
/ I have to change my dress.

521
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:15,409
Go there by yourself.
/ But I don't know where the toilet is.

522
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:17,433
Go through this hallway, turn right, then left.

523
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:20,457
Oh.

524
00:33:33,481 --> 00:33:34,481
Wow.

525
00:33:34,505 --> 00:33:36,505
How luxurious!

526
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:39,429
Radical!

527
00:34:02,453 --> 00:34:03,453
Emm...

528
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:05,477
Am I... lost?

529
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:08,401
Where are you going?
/ Oh.

530
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:10,425
I got lost.

531
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,449
Follow me.

532
00:34:12,473 --> 00:34:15,473
Brother, it's great to raise the Spirit Pearl.

533
00:34:15,497 --> 00:34:19,497
Another great achievement for the Sect.

534
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:20,521
Not really.

535
00:34:20,545 --> 00:34:22,545
This is all thanks to the guidance of the Guru.

536
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:25,469
This Kunlun Dew is a rare miracle medicine.

537
00:34:25,493 --> 00:34:28,493
Normally, it takes 6 months to fill one pool.

538
00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:30,517
But today, when I asked someone to check it,

539
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:32,541
now it's full!

540
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:35,465
Your timing couldn't be better.

541
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:39,489
Bro, luck must be on your side, right?

542
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:45,413
What's wrong with you?
You can't even drink water properly.

543
00:34:45,437 --> 00:34:47,437
This student of mine is a bit lacking in manners.

544
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,461
Please forgive him.

545
00:34:49,485 --> 00:34:51,485
My pee is in the water.

546
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:57,409
My teacher is also a bit lacking in manners.

547
00:34:57,433 --> 00:34:59,433
Please forgive him.

548
00:34:59,457 --> 00:35:00,757
Brother, that time is important.

549
00:35:00,781 --> 00:35:02,781
I think Nezha should take the exam soon.

550
00:35:02,805 --> 00:35:04,405
Why the rush?

551
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:06,429
Let's have a drink first.

552
00:35:06,453 --> 00:35:08,453
No more, please.

553
00:35:08,477 --> 00:35:10,477
In that case, okay.

554
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,401
My student Deero will be the Judge.

555
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:15,425
The Demon Hunter's next target

556
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,449
can be handed over to Nezha.

557
00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:19,473
Sis, we'll excuse ourselves first.

558
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:25,497
Taiyi, my brother,
is always impatient.

559
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:32,421
This year's Dew Taste

560
00:35:35,445 --> 00:35:37,445
rich in a certain flavor.

561
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,469
Continue using this method in the future.

562
00:35:40,493 --> 00:35:42,493
Yes, Teacher.

563
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:52,417
<font color="#80ffff">VISITORBET</font>
►WE WILL PAY YOU NO MATTER WHATEVER YOU WIN◄
<font color="#80ffff">►search for us on Google: VISITORBET◄</font>

564
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:25,441
Why stop?

565
00:36:25,465 --> 00:36:27,465
It's been 6 hours, Teacher Shen.

566
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:28,889
Tired of continuing.
/ Useless!

567
00:36:28,913 --> 00:36:31,413
Forging does not tolerate laziness.

568
00:36:31,437 --> 00:36:33,437
Don't stop without my permission .

569
00:36:40,461 --> 00:36:42,461
General Li Jing of Chentang Pass
comes to see you.

570
00:36:42,485 --> 00:36:44,485
Guru Shen,

571
00:36:44,509 --> 00:36:47,409
Yesterday's battle resulted in
many soldiers and civilians being injured.

572
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:49,433
We ran out of medicine.

573
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,457
I beg you to open a path

574
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:54,481
so that some healers could go to town
to buy supplies.

575
00:36:59,405 --> 00:37:00,405
How bold!

576
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,429
No wonder you...

577
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,453
Whose doing is this?
You bastard...

578
00:37:05,477 --> 00:37:07,477
I...

579
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:09,501
Stop... stop, stop, stop!

580
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:17,425
Bring me

581
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:19,449
who was caught earlier.

582
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:21,473
He left the city during the battle.

583
00:37:21,497 --> 00:37:23,497
General Li, please,

584
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:25,521
Bring it again... this one.

585
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:27,545
This is a misunderstanding, Teacher Shen!

586
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:29,569
I'm a ghost too!

587
00:37:29,593 --> 00:37:31,293
I caught this Yaksha

588
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:33,417
to clear my son's name.

589
00:37:33,441 --> 00:37:35,441
Now that it's done,

590
00:37:35,465 --> 00:37:37,465
and because he didn't do anything serious,

591
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,489
Just let him go.
/ Yes, that's right.

592
00:37:39,513 --> 00:37:42,413
My role is small.
It's not important.

593
00:37:43,437 --> 00:37:45,437
I don't think you understand me.

594
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:48,461
No one can leave here,
not even demons.

595
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:50,485
Especially humans.

596
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:55,409
Master Shen, please forgive me.
I am also a demon.

597
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:57,433
We're both the bad guys!

598
00:37:57,457 --> 00:37:58,457
Pfft!

599
00:37:58,481 --> 00:37:59,481
I... am not a criminal.

600
00:37:59,505 --> 00:38:01,505
Everyone who knows the secret of the Spirit Pearl

601
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,529
must stay here.
/ Without medicine,

602
00:38:03,553 --> 00:38:06,453
The wounded will not survive.

603
00:38:08,477 --> 00:38:11,477
Teacher Shen, please,

604
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:13,501
I just ask you to save my life.

605
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,425
Sir!

606
00:38:15,449 --> 00:38:16,749
We caught a spy.

607
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:18,773
This guy is from out of town

608
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,797
and he injured some of our soldiers.
/ Lock him up...lock him up too.

609
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:22,421
Bang.

610
00:38:22,445 --> 00:38:24,445
Dude, is that you?

611
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,469
You...

612
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:27,493
Bro, it's me!

613
00:38:27,517 --> 00:38:30,417
SHEN XIAOBAO

614
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,441
Xiaobao?

615
00:38:33,465 --> 00:38:35,465
You haven't been home for ages.

616
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:37,489
I really miss you.

617
00:38:37,513 --> 00:38:39,513
What are you doing here?

618
00:38:39,537 --> 00:38:41,537
Father sent me to look for you.
Look,

619
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:43,561
The compass you gave me.
It tells me where you are.

620
00:38:45,485 --> 00:38:48,485
Dad... how is he?

621
00:38:48,509 --> 00:38:49,509
He is healthy.

622
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:52,433
Since you entered Yu Xu Palace,
father's energy is full,

623
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:54,457
as if he was taking a magic vitamin.

624
00:38:54,481 --> 00:38:57,481
You are the only one from our village
who has succeeded in becoming a Chan Sect immortal.

625
00:38:57,505 --> 00:39:00,405
Now, fellow ghosts from miles
away are riding the train with father.

626
00:39:02,429 --> 00:39:04,429
By the way,

627
00:39:04,453 --> 00:39:06,453
why are you here?

628
00:39:07,477 --> 00:39:09,477
Didn't you promise me,
once I reach human form,

629
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:11,501
You will take me to Yu Xu Palace?

630
00:39:11,525 --> 00:39:13,525
Look! I can transform into a human now!

631
00:39:19,449 --> 00:39:21,449
All these years, I have been practicing diligently,

632
00:39:21,473 --> 00:39:23,473
without a single day's rest.

633
00:39:23,497 --> 00:39:25,497
You are my role model, bro.

634
00:39:25,521 --> 00:39:27,521
Glory to Yu Xu, answering the heavenly call.

635
00:39:27,545 --> 00:39:31,445
Traveling the world, bringing justice to all.

636
00:39:33,469 --> 00:39:35,469
Tell me, bro,

637
00:39:35,493 --> 00:39:37,493
what are you doing here?
/ I... I...

638
00:39:37,517 --> 00:39:39,517
Are these your sea monsters subordinates?

639
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:41,541
Why are you besieging the Chentang Line?

640
00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:42,565
Well, about that...

641
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,489
This...

642
00:39:44,513 --> 00:39:47,413
Master Shen is defending the Chentang Line.

643
00:39:47,437 --> 00:39:49,437
Huh?

644
00:39:49,461 --> 00:39:51,461
Evil forces are attacking this city.

645
00:39:51,485 --> 00:39:53,485
Master Shen and the sea clan came to our aid.

646
00:39:53,509 --> 00:39:57,409
On behalf of my people,
I thank you for your noble actions.

647
00:39:59,433 --> 00:40:01,433
No need for that.

648
00:40:01,457 --> 00:40:03,457
Wow!

649
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:05,481
Dude, you are amazing!

650
00:40:05,505 --> 00:40:08,405
Is this the demon that attacked Chentang Pass?

651
00:40:08,429 --> 00:40:10,429
Ah!

652
00:40:10,453 --> 00:40:12,453
You bring shame to the good name of the demons!

653
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,477
Shameless!

654
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:16,501
Hey, Xiaobao,

655
00:40:16,525 --> 00:40:17,525
Can you

656
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:20,449
wait a few more years

657
00:40:20,473 --> 00:40:22,473
before going to Yu Xu Palace?

658
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:24,497
Huh? Why?

659
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,521
I can transform into a human now!

660
00:40:26,545 --> 00:40:28,545
Because...

661
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:30,569
I'm preparing for my promotion
to the 12 Golden Immortals.

662
00:40:30,593 --> 00:40:33,493
so I can focus.
/ 12 Golden Immortals?

663
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:35,417
Once finished,

664
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:37,441
I'll take you there, how about that?

665
00:40:41,465 --> 00:40:43,465
No problem, bro!
Your promotion is more important.

666
00:40:43,489 --> 00:40:45,489
I can go to Yu Xu Palace anytime.

667
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:48,413
Besides that,

668
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:50,437
I'm not yet proficient enough in mastering the art of shapeshifting.

669
00:40:50,461 --> 00:40:52,461
I'll go home and practice again.

670
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:54,485
Even more active.

671
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:58,409
Xiaobao,

672
00:40:58,433 --> 00:41:00,433
This is what I've kept since I entered the palace.
/ What is this?

673
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:04,457
Yu Xu Palace gave all the disciples this immortality pill.

674
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:06,481
Try eating it, and you will...
gain 10 years of forging knowledge.

675
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,405
But...

676
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:11,429
This is too precious.
Bro, you are training for a promotion.

677
00:41:11,453 --> 00:41:14,453
You should keep it.
/ I don't like the taste.

678
00:41:14,477 --> 00:41:16,477
I prefer to forge myself.

679
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:18,501
You... have to take it back.
Share it with your family.

680
00:41:19,425 --> 00:41:21,425
No, I can't.
Dad will blame me.

681
00:41:21,449 --> 00:41:23,449
Xiaobao, you don't obey your brother?

682
00:41:23,473 --> 00:41:25,473
Take the pill and leave now.

683
00:41:25,497 --> 00:41:27,497
This is the front line.
If... you stay here,

684
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:29,521
I will be unfocused.

685
00:41:29,545 --> 00:41:31,445
In that case...

686
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:33,469
I...

687
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:35,493
will go.

688
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:39,417
Bro, you have to

689
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:41,441
managed to reach 12 Golden Immortals.

690
00:41:43,465 --> 00:41:45,465
I will continue to practice on my own.

691
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:52,489
I appreciate your help,

692
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,513
but the risks were too great
for me to let anyone through.

693
00:41:54,537 --> 00:41:57,437
This Yaksha...
you also bring it back.

694
00:41:57,461 --> 00:41:59,461
I didn't help you earlier.

695
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:01,485
But I helped the young master.

696
00:42:01,509 --> 00:42:03,509
A good role model

697
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:05,533
can change his life.

698
00:42:07,457 --> 00:42:09,457
Wait.

699
00:42:10,481 --> 00:42:12,481
Give... give me a list of the medicines you need.

700
00:42:17,405 --> 00:42:21,405
LEVEL 1: BANDIT HILL

701
00:42:54,429 --> 00:42:57,429
I am Nezha, the valiant Third Prince.

702
00:42:57,453 --> 00:43:01,453
I finish off the ghost,
I write in a poem that has not been told.

703
00:43:01,477 --> 00:43:03,477
Today I come to remove the devil's breath.

704
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:07,401
Evil demons, prepare to die!

705
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:13,425
Still eating?
Woe to you.

706
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:18,449
Ahhh!

707
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:22,473
Who do you think you are?

708
00:43:22,497 --> 00:43:25,497
Roaring on our Bandit Hill?

709
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:28,421
So you're the leader?
Go ahead.

710
00:43:28,445 --> 00:43:30,445
and feel my power.

711
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:32,469
You're so arrogant, you brat.

712
00:43:32,493 --> 00:43:34,493
Boss, teach him a lesson.

713
00:43:53,417 --> 00:43:55,417
Show your skills.

714
00:43:56,441 --> 00:43:58,441
You go first.

715
00:43:58,465 --> 00:43:59,465
No, but, boss...

716
00:43:59,489 --> 00:44:02,489
How dare I take your thunder?

717
00:44:02,513 --> 00:44:04,513
Fighting that little kid is embarrassing.

718
00:44:04,537 --> 00:44:06,537
If I say go ahead, go ahead!

719
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,561
Hey, kid.
Too young,

720
00:44:08,585 --> 00:44:10,585
very naive.
So I'm willing to let this go.

721
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:12,409
You...

722
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:14,433
It's not too late to run home to your mother.

723
00:44:15,457 --> 00:44:16,757
Why is this?
/ Why did you wake up again?

724
00:44:16,781 --> 00:44:18,781
I don't know.
I'm an easy sleeper.

725
00:44:18,805 --> 00:44:20,405
The shaking had woken me up.

726
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:22,429
Damn it.

727
00:44:22,453 --> 00:44:24,453
He mostly took his pills
and now he is immune to sleeping pills.

728
00:44:24,477 --> 00:44:26,477
Then increase the dose.

729
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:29,401
If you insist on staying here, you'll get hurt.

730
00:44:33,425 --> 00:44:36,425
I was going to dodge to the right.
/ Sorry, I thought it was to the left.

731
00:44:38,449 --> 00:44:40,449
Very weak.

732
00:44:40,473 --> 00:44:42,473
Master Taiyi.
Maybe I should just stop.

733
00:44:42,497 --> 00:44:44,497
He can practice for a few more years.
/ Not so fast.

734
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:47,421
He was just testing the demon.

735
00:44:47,445 --> 00:44:49,445
The kid likes to...
pretend to be stupid.

736
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:51,469
Pil.

737
00:44:51,493 --> 00:44:54,493
I need pills.
/ I'll give you a warning.

738
00:44:54,517 --> 00:44:57,417
Now you know who you're messing with.

739
00:44:57,441 --> 00:44:58,441
Oh no.

740
00:44:58,465 --> 00:45:00,465
The pills are mixed in the soup!

741
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,489
Then I'll drink the soup.

742
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:06,413
And you tried to steal our soup?

743
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,437
That's asking to be beaten.

744
00:45:09,461 --> 00:45:11,461
Let me do it.

745
00:45:13,485 --> 00:45:14,485
Disgusting.

746
00:45:14,509 --> 00:45:18,409
Super Powerful Mace Attack!

747
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:24,433
See?
I told you he was just pretending.

748
00:45:24,457 --> 00:45:26,457
I wasn't paying attention earlier.

749
00:45:26,481 --> 00:45:28,481
That doesn't count.

750
00:45:44,405 --> 00:45:47,405
No way!

751
00:45:53,429 --> 00:45:55,429
You suck!

752
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:56,453
Move!

753
00:45:56,477 --> 00:45:59,477
Watch me beat him up.
/ Why did you throw up everything?

754
00:45:59,501 --> 00:46:00,701
The taste is too strong.
I can't take it anymore.

755
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:02,725
Check this out!

756
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:07,449
Funny!

757
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,473
It doesn't work.
We can't win without it.

758
00:46:18,497 --> 00:46:20,497
Deero is watching.
I can't give him the pills.

759
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:22,521
What should we do now?

760
00:46:22,545 --> 00:46:23,545
I understand.

761
00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:26,469
There is another way.

762
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:27,693
You don't suggest...

763
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:29,417
We can eat the vomit.

764
00:46:29,441 --> 00:46:31,441
But, it's disgusting.

765
00:46:32,465 --> 00:46:33,465
What is the problem?

766
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:35,489
Wait for me to drink Yaksha snot?

767
00:46:36,413 --> 00:46:37,813
This should explain it.

768
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:41,437
"Suffer first, then see the results."

769
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:44,461
That's how Nezha defeated fate.

770
00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:48,485
The lives of my parents and my friends are at stake,

771
00:46:48,509 --> 00:46:51,409
and the people of Jalur Chentang.

772
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:55,433
It's EASY!

773
00:47:03,457 --> 00:47:05,457
By ignoring prejudice

774
00:47:05,481 --> 00:47:08,481
and overcome inner fears

775
00:47:08,505 --> 00:47:10,505
I will change my destiny.

776
00:47:30,429 --> 00:47:32,429
I remain humble

777
00:47:32,453 --> 00:47:34,453
until today's show.

778
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,477
Guru Taiyi,

779
00:47:36,501 --> 00:47:39,401
Save Nezha first.
We'll think about the Reparo Miracle Medicine later.

780
00:47:39,425 --> 00:47:40,425
Impossible.

781
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:41,449
I can't believe this.

782
00:47:41,473 --> 00:47:43,473
Son, let's compete again.

783
00:47:45,497 --> 00:47:46,497
Pretend to be dead?

784
00:47:46,521 --> 00:47:48,521
I'll hit you!

785
00:47:56,445 --> 00:47:58,445
Luckily Nezha passed out.

786
00:47:58,469 --> 00:48:01,469
You are so bad!

787
00:48:02,493 --> 00:48:04,493
Let me avenge your defeat!

788
00:48:04,517 --> 00:48:07,417
Unbeatable Whirlwind Punch!

789
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,441
Ahhh!

790
00:48:41,465 --> 00:48:43,465
Should we arrest them all?

791
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:46,489
Even leaving one behind
could harm the people here.

792
00:48:46,513 --> 00:48:49,413
Bring them all back to Yu Xu Palace.
The sect will guide them to the right path,

793
00:48:49,437 --> 00:48:51,437
change evil into good.

794
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,461
Why is her face like that?

795
00:48:53,485 --> 00:48:55,485
Nothing.
His appearance changes all the time.

796
00:48:55,509 --> 00:48:58,409
Pearl of the Spirit, you know,
is not like ordinary people.

797
00:48:59,433 --> 00:49:01,433
Next time be more careful,

798
00:49:01,457 --> 00:49:03,457
you just scare me.

799
00:49:14,481 --> 00:49:15,481
Who is this child?

800
00:49:15,505 --> 00:49:16,505
Nezha maybe.

801
00:49:16,529 --> 00:49:17,729
His younger siblings are Jinzha and Muzha.

802
00:49:17,753 --> 00:49:20,453
She is the reincarnation of the Spirit Pearl
appointed by the Great God.

803
00:49:23,477 --> 00:49:25,477
No way, huh?

804
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:28,401
Hunched over, staggering.

805
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:30,425
His eyebrows are drooping, his eyes are drooping.
His face is disgusting.

806
00:49:30,449 --> 00:49:32,449
Not to mention the dark circles under her eyes.

807
00:49:32,473 --> 00:49:34,473
More like a ghost.

808
00:49:41,497 --> 00:49:43,497
Not now.

809
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:52,421
Brother,

810
00:49:52,445 --> 00:49:54,445
what is the star sign tonight?

811
00:49:54,469 --> 00:49:56,469
6 stars aligned,

812
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,493
once in 10 years.

813
00:49:58,517 --> 00:50:00,517
Whenever 6 stars align,

814
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:04,441
This Jade Pulpit can transmit sound
and images thousands of kilometers away.

815
00:50:04,465 --> 00:50:06,465
Our brothers and sisters are spread all over the world.

816
00:50:06,489 --> 00:50:08,489
and finally reunited.

817
00:50:08,513 --> 00:50:11,413
Tonight is the night.

818
00:50:11,437 --> 00:50:14,437
The Golden Gods will meet.

819
00:50:15,461 --> 00:50:17,461
I haven't gone up to the Twelve yet.

820
00:50:17,485 --> 00:50:19,485
Maybe I'm not included.

821
00:50:19,509 --> 00:50:21,509
It's just a matter of time.
/ No, it's not.

822
00:50:21,533 --> 00:50:23,533
This is completely inappropriate.

823
00:50:23,557 --> 00:50:25,557
I can't do it, really.

824
00:50:25,581 --> 00:50:27,581
Then why are you sitting there?
/ Shut up!

825
00:50:27,605 --> 00:50:29,605
What harm will it do you to see your teacher succeed?

826
00:50:38,429 --> 00:50:40,429
Sauna!

827
00:50:40,453 --> 00:50:42,453
Shh!

828
00:50:48,477 --> 00:50:51,477
Brothers and sisters, I hereby welcome you
to your place.

829
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:53,501
Salam. Kak Wuliang!

830
00:50:53,525 --> 00:50:56,425
Let me introduce a new member.

831
00:50:56,449 --> 00:50:58,449
Kak Taiyi.

832
00:50:58,473 --> 00:51:00,473
He has met the teacher's expectations.

833
00:51:00,497 --> 00:51:02,497
and successfully maintain

834
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:04,521
reincarnation of the Spirit Pearl.

835
00:51:06,445 --> 00:51:08,445
Have a little respect.

836
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:13,469
The war of the gods is just around the corner.

837
00:51:13,493 --> 00:51:17,493
We are here to discuss preparations.

838
00:51:17,517 --> 00:51:22,439
DEWA GHUANGCHENG

839
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,440
DEWA CHIJING

840
00:51:26,441 --> 00:51:29,441
DEWA JU LIU SUN

841
00:51:34,442 --> 00:51:37,442
DEWA HUANGLONG

842
00:51:17,517 --> 00:51:20,417
The Chan sect was orthodox Taoist,

843
00:51:20,441 --> 00:51:22,441
then we are destined to win.

844
00:51:22,465 --> 00:51:24,465
But because the Jie Sect has risen rapidly
in recent years,

845
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:26,489
we must remain vigilant.

846
00:51:26,513 --> 00:51:27,513
Sect Jie,

847
00:51:27,537 --> 00:51:29,437
a place where furry animals and lust gather

848
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:32,461
as well as creatures born from mucus and eggs.

849
00:51:32,485 --> 00:51:34,485
This war concerns the survival of our sect.

850
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:37,409
We must be careful.
Strengthen our strength.

851
00:51:37,433 --> 00:51:40,433
That's the key.
/ Exactly.

852
00:51:40,457 --> 00:51:44,457
That's why I started preparing early.

853
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:46,481
Immortality Pill,

854
00:51:46,505 --> 00:51:48,505
the number is 9,000,

855
00:51:48,529 --> 00:51:51,429
can be allocated based on levels.

856
00:51:51,453 --> 00:51:55,353
DEWA DAORENG

857
00:51:51,477 --> 00:51:54,477
This will definitely increase our strength.

858
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:56,501
How can there be that many?
/ For 100 years

859
00:51:56,525 --> 00:51:59,425
Our teacher tirelessly refined the pills
with the Tianyuan Crater.

860
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,449
Working day and night,
sacrificing his own forging.

861
00:52:02,473 --> 00:52:06,495
DEWA LENGBAO

862
00:52:02,473 --> 00:52:06,473
Brother Wuliang has dedicated himself
to building our sect,

863
00:52:06,497 --> 00:52:08,497
his contribution is commendable.

864
00:52:08,521 --> 00:52:11,421
It is commendable.

865
00:52:11,422 --> 00:52:14,444
{\an6}THE GOD OF CIHANG

866
00:52:11,445 --> 00:52:12,445
Long live the seventeenth century,

867
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:15,469
Are there other evil forces
plotting against us?

868
00:52:15,493 --> 00:52:17,493
Teacher Cihang,
once the threat of the ghost was discovered,

869
00:52:17,517 --> 00:52:19,517
The Demon Hunters will be dispatched soon.

870
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:22,441
So generally
roaming ghosts are not a threat.

871
00:52:22,465 --> 00:52:23,465
But,

872
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:25,489
there is one exception.
/ Oh?

873
00:52:25,513 --> 00:52:27,413
Who's that?

874
00:52:27,437 --> 00:52:29,437
The dragons of the Eastern Sea.

875
00:52:29,461 --> 00:52:31,461
Naga?

876
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:34,485
DEWA QINGXU

877
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:34,485
Didn't they give up
on the Sky Palace a long time ago?

878
00:52:34,509 --> 00:52:37,409
No one can be trusted
except our own people.

879
00:52:37,433 --> 00:52:40,433
To me, it seems like they just gave up,

880
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:42,457
hibernate temporarily.

881
00:52:42,481 --> 00:52:44,481
Dragons have helped conquer
the monsters of hell for thousands of years.

882
00:52:44,505 --> 00:52:46,405
What is their crime?

883
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,429
But they have their own strengths,

884
00:52:48,453 --> 00:52:50,453
if they betray us in war,

885
00:52:50,477 --> 00:52:52,477
the situation will turn around.

886
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:56,401
But we still can't do that.

887
00:52:57,402 --> 00:53:01,424
DEWA WENSHU

888
00:52:56,425 --> 00:52:59,425
Our reputation as being true and just
is known to all mankind.

889
00:52:59,449 --> 00:53:02,449
If we selflessly
attack the surrendered,

890
00:53:02,473 --> 00:53:05,473
How can everyone trust us?

891
00:53:05,497 --> 00:53:07,497
Yes.

892
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:09,421
We must not act rashly.

893
00:53:09,445 --> 00:53:11,445
Further consideration is required.

894
00:53:11,469 --> 00:53:13,469
But...
/ Enough.

895
00:53:13,493 --> 00:53:15,493
They are right too.

896
00:53:15,517 --> 00:53:17,517
And you don't have to be so short-sighted.

897
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:18,541
Good.

898
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:21,465
The time of the 6 stars aligned is almost over.

899
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:24,489
Since there is no further discussion,

900
00:53:24,513 --> 00:53:26,513
Let's end this meeting now.

901
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:27,537
Brother,

902
00:53:27,561 --> 00:53:31,461
Jinzha and Muzha are
my own and Brother Puxian's students.

903
00:53:31,485 --> 00:53:34,485
They have been forging here
for many years away from home,

904
00:53:34,509 --> 00:53:36,509
never met Nezha,

905
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:41,432
DEWA PUXIAN

906
00:53:36,533 --> 00:53:40,433
their younger brother.
/ Because there is still time left for the 6 stars to align,

907
00:53:40,457 --> 00:53:42,457
Why don't you let them?

908
00:53:42,481 --> 00:53:44,481
meet for a moment?

909
00:53:45,405 --> 00:53:47,405
Great idea.

910
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:54,429
Oh my!

911
00:53:54,453 --> 00:53:56,453
What should I do?

912
00:53:56,477 --> 00:53:58,477
What?

913
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,501
Considering how I look like...

914
00:54:00,525 --> 00:54:02,525
What is my first impression of...

915
00:54:02,549 --> 00:54:04,549
ugly?
/ Of course not!

916
00:54:04,573 --> 00:54:06,573
Really?
/ Despite being careless,

917
00:54:06,597 --> 00:54:08,597
you have a strong will.
Although short,

918
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:10,621
you have a big heart.
Even though you are ugly,

919
00:54:10,645 --> 00:54:12,645
your heart is kind.
Even though you have dark circles under your eyes,

920
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:14,669
pig life
and one tooth fell out

921
00:54:14,693 --> 00:54:16,693
I still think
you're absolutely great.

922
00:54:17,417 --> 00:54:19,417
And I'm sure your brothers agree with that.

923
00:54:21,441 --> 00:54:23,441
Thank you for the compliment.

924
00:54:24,465 --> 00:54:25,465
What are you doing?

925
00:54:25,489 --> 00:54:27,489
Please meet my brothers.
/ Seriously?

926
00:54:27,513 --> 00:54:29,513
How can I do this for you?
No, Nezha.

927
00:54:29,537 --> 00:54:31,537
Nezha!

928
00:54:37,461 --> 00:54:39,461
The boy was a bit shy.

929
00:54:44,485 --> 00:54:45,485
Nezha!

930
00:54:45,509 --> 00:54:47,509
Brother!

931
00:55:13,433 --> 00:55:15,433
Ao Bing, are you crying?

932
00:55:17,457 --> 00:55:19,457
This reminds me of my two brothers.

933
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:21,481
You have siblings too?

934
00:55:21,505 --> 00:55:22,505
Mm.

935
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:24,429
Before.

936
00:55:24,453 --> 00:55:26,453
Having two such nice brothers.

937
00:55:26,477 --> 00:55:28,477
You are very lucky.

938
00:55:28,501 --> 00:55:31,401
What were you guys talking about?

939
00:55:31,425 --> 00:55:33,425
They said

940
00:55:33,449 --> 00:55:35,449
they regret not visiting you
all these years.

941
00:55:36,473 --> 00:55:38,473
They asked

942
00:55:38,497 --> 00:55:40,497
news about the situation at home,

943
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:42,521
Are your parents healthy,
what are your hobbies,

944
00:55:42,545 --> 00:55:44,545
and who your friends are.

945
00:55:44,569 --> 00:55:45,569
They also said

946
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:47,593
whatever problems you will face in the future,

947
00:55:47,617 --> 00:55:49,417
Look for them.

948
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:51,441
And remember, you have two older brothers.

949
00:55:51,465 --> 00:55:53,465
who will always help and protect you.

950
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:56,489
Why are you...
/ Nothing.

951
00:55:56,513 --> 00:55:58,513
Something in my eye.

952
00:55:59,437 --> 00:56:01,437
Are you sure it's not the other way around?

953
00:56:01,461 --> 00:56:03,461
Shut up!
I said it's nothing!

954
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,485
Okay.
You're the boss here.

955
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:11,409
I'm not talking to you.

956
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:13,433
Okay, I'll stop.

957
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:18,457
Are you still angry?
Nezha?

958
00:56:18,481 --> 00:56:20,481
Nezha!

959
00:56:20,505 --> 00:56:22,505
Ao Bing,

960
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:24,529
Since childhood I was rude and didn't know the rules,

961
00:56:24,553 --> 00:56:27,453
making my parents worry all day.

962
00:56:27,477 --> 00:56:28,477
Your father,

963
00:56:28,501 --> 00:56:30,501
thinking he was the one who attacked the Chentang Line,

964
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:33,425
I know he just sacrificed everything

965
00:56:33,449 --> 00:56:35,449
for your sake.

966
00:56:35,473 --> 00:56:36,473
And today,

967
00:56:36,497 --> 00:56:39,497
My brothers are so kind to me.

968
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:42,421
Our family sacrifices a lot for us.

969
00:56:42,445 --> 00:56:44,445
You are a monster,

970
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:47,469
and I am the devil.
We are both a burden to the family.

971
00:56:50,493 --> 00:56:52,493
So what if we were both born as demons?

972
00:56:52,517 --> 00:56:54,517
God or devil, I decide.

973
00:56:55,441 --> 00:56:57,441
Once you are safe,
we must have a place among the gods.

974
00:56:57,465 --> 00:56:59,465
so that our family doesn't have to worry anymore.
/ Yes!

975
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:02,489
Only by becoming gods
can we be respected by all humans.

976
00:57:02,513 --> 00:57:03,513
Agreed!

977
00:57:03,537 --> 00:57:06,437
I will become a god!

978
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:17,461
{\an6}LEVEL 2:
WATERFALL ASCENSION

979
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:16,461
Only with courage and perseverance
can rapid progress be achieved.

980
00:57:16,485 --> 00:57:20,485
At this rate,
hundreds of years will be wasted.

981
00:57:21,409 --> 00:57:22,409
Regarding forging,

982
00:57:22,433 --> 00:57:25,433
the priorities are fitness, energy and enthusiasm.

983
00:57:25,457 --> 00:57:27,457
If you find it difficult, or feel tired,

984
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:31,481
that's because you were born a devil.

985
00:57:31,505 --> 00:57:33,505
Just by exerting your abilities

986
00:57:33,529 --> 00:57:35,529
you have the opportunity to change your destiny

987
00:57:35,553 --> 00:57:37,553
and attain immortality.

988
00:57:38,477 --> 00:57:41,477
It's not life and death that I fear,

989
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:44,401
opposing the authorities
is something I respect.

990
00:57:44,425 --> 00:57:47,425
Fate is in my hands, not heaven's plan.

991
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:51,449
This naughty boy will become a pious man!

992
00:57:52,473 --> 00:57:54,473
Good!

993
00:57:55,497 --> 00:57:57,497
Just a few sentences, but so powerful,

994
00:57:57,521 --> 00:57:59,521
so inspiring.

995
00:57:59,545 --> 00:58:01,445
It's a great poem indeed.

996
00:58:01,469 --> 00:58:04,469
This is something you all need to learn.

997
00:58:06,493 --> 00:58:08,493
Really?
Is it that good?

998
00:58:08,517 --> 00:58:11,417
I just made it up.
/ It's good.

999
00:58:11,441 --> 00:58:13,441
Word for word, and encouraging.

1000
00:58:13,465 --> 00:58:15,465
One poem like this

1001
00:58:15,489 --> 00:58:17,489
show your ambition, young man.

1002
00:58:17,513 --> 00:58:20,413
A true young hero
with a bright future!

1003
00:58:20,437 --> 00:58:23,437
Oh, seriously. Never mind.
Actually, there are still a few shortcomings.

1004
00:58:23,461 --> 00:58:25,461
More like
it has a lot of shortcomings.

1005
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:27,485
I asked, what are the dark circles under the eyes for?

1006
00:58:27,509 --> 00:58:29,509
It's clear that you often stay up late.

1007
00:58:29,533 --> 00:58:31,533
Your life is not disciplined,
your diet is unhealthy,

1008
00:58:31,557 --> 00:58:33,557
you can't even manage
basic self-control.

1009
00:58:33,581 --> 00:58:35,581
How dare you dream of becoming a god?

1010
00:58:35,605 --> 00:58:37,605
I was born with dark circles under my eyes.

1011
00:58:37,629 --> 00:58:39,629
Appearance is a reflection of the heart, you know?
Try looking in the mirror.

1012
00:58:39,653 --> 00:58:41,653
It's ridiculous, reckless and careless.

1013
00:58:41,677 --> 00:58:44,477
If you become my disciple,
I want you to reform your human form.

1014
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:47,401
Can be reshaped?
Then there is hope for my appearance, right?

1015
00:58:47,425 --> 00:58:50,425
Please teach me.
/ I've guessed your intention to find a teacher.

1016
00:58:50,449 --> 00:58:51,449
Listen, son,

1017
00:58:51,473 --> 00:58:53,473
I see you have great ambitions,

1018
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:55,497
then I take you as my student.
/ Cool!

1019
00:58:55,521 --> 00:58:57,521
Teacher!

1020
00:58:58,445 --> 00:59:00,445
Come on, practice with your friends.

1021
00:59:00,469 --> 00:59:01,769
Practice what?
/ Of course immortality.

1022
00:59:01,793 --> 00:59:03,793
I don't need to be taught that.
Show me how to be more handsome.

1023
00:59:03,817 --> 00:59:05,417
You're ridiculous!

1024
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:08,441
More concerned with looks
than forging? Set your priorities straight.

1025
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:11,465
Will you teach me or not?
/ We are no longer teacher and student.

1026
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:13,489
You deserve to have dark circles under your eyes for the rest of your life.

1027
00:59:13,513 --> 00:59:16,413
That's too much.
I won't go easy on you!

1028
00:59:16,437 --> 00:59:18,437
What is this?
Want to challenge me?

1029
00:59:18,461 --> 00:59:20,461
3 pills are definitely enough.
/ Son,

1030
00:59:20,485 --> 00:59:23,485
go back to where you came from.
If you continue to disturb our lessons,

1031
00:59:23,509 --> 00:59:26,409
will have a bad impact on you.

1032
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:29,433
Sorry.

1033
01:00:07,457 --> 01:00:09,457
You are no match for me.

1034
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:12,481
Impressive, son.

1035
01:00:12,505 --> 01:00:14,505
Apparently I underestimated you.

1036
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:30,429
Feel this!

1037
01:00:32,453 --> 01:00:34,453
Yeah, teach this rancid kid a lesson.

1038
01:00:34,477 --> 01:00:36,477
Teachers will definitely win!

1039
01:00:36,501 --> 01:00:38,501
So fast!
Did you see it?

1040
01:00:40,425 --> 01:00:42,425
There is no grudge between us.

1041
01:00:42,449 --> 01:00:44,449
You better go.

1042
01:00:44,473 --> 01:00:46,473
I can't lose.

1043
01:00:57,497 --> 01:00:59,497
You won't be able to touch me.
Let alone fight me.

1044
01:01:12,421 --> 01:01:14,421
Smart move!
Choke him tight.

1045
01:01:14,445 --> 01:01:16,445
Fast movement sucks.

1046
01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:18,469
Give up?

1047
01:01:30,493 --> 01:01:32,493
Wait, you...

1048
01:01:32,517 --> 01:01:34,517
Finally you know.

1049
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:35,641
I'm not fast.

1050
01:01:35,665 --> 01:01:37,665
I just turned into an electric current,

1051
01:01:37,689 --> 01:01:39,689
move quickly to any location.

1052
01:01:39,713 --> 01:01:41,413
In the water,

1053
01:01:41,437 --> 01:01:43,437
I am invincible!

1054
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:00,461
Impressive freezing science.

1055
01:02:03,485 --> 01:02:06,485
Keep calm,
push yourself and your body will be destroyed!

1056
01:02:06,509 --> 01:02:09,409
Ice doesn't conduct electricity.
Let's see what else you're capable of.

1057
01:02:10,433 --> 01:02:12,433
Lakes and seas...
Clouds and skies...

1058
01:02:12,457 --> 01:02:15,457
With the divine spell in my hand.
Rise and Go!

1059
01:02:27,481 --> 01:02:29,481
Dad!

1060
01:02:35,405 --> 01:02:36,405
Seriously.

1061
01:02:36,429 --> 01:02:38,429
Rain Summoning Spell.
End this now!

1062
01:02:52,453 --> 01:02:54,453
Late.

1063
01:03:09,477 --> 01:03:11,477
You're done.

1064
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:32,401
Teacher!

1065
01:03:32,425 --> 01:03:33,425
Teacher, are you okay?

1066
01:03:33,449 --> 01:03:36,449
I have no intention of taking your life.
You don't have to sacrifice your hand.

1067
01:03:36,473 --> 01:03:40,473
Students, listen,
bring the demon back to the palace.

1068
01:03:40,497 --> 01:03:42,497
Ready!

1069
01:03:42,521 --> 01:03:43,521
Stop!

1070
01:03:43,545 --> 01:03:45,545
Put down your weapons.
All of you, put down your weapons!

1071
01:03:45,569 --> 01:03:48,469
May I ask if you are a member of the Chan Sect?

1072
01:03:48,493 --> 01:03:51,493
That's right.
/ Ah.

1073
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:59,417
They are the gods of Yu Xu Palace.

1074
01:03:59,441 --> 01:04:01,441
You have to be respectful.

1075
01:04:01,465 --> 01:04:04,465
Entering Yu Xu Palace and receiving
teachings of the true path

1076
01:04:04,489 --> 01:04:06,489
maybe there's nothing wrong with it.

1077
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:09,413
Everyone, put down your weapons!

1078
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:19,437
Dad!

1079
01:04:19,461 --> 01:04:21,461
Xiaobao?
Why are you back?

1080
01:04:27,485 --> 01:04:29,485
Xiaobao, calm down!

1081
01:04:37,409 --> 01:04:39,409
Little one!

1082
01:04:44,433 --> 01:04:46,433
Demon! You're so rude!

1083
01:04:47,457 --> 01:04:49,457
No!

1084
01:05:04,481 --> 01:05:06,481
Dad!

1085
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,405
Nezha, freeze this river now!

1086
01:05:23,429 --> 01:05:25,429
You won't be able to escape!

1087
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:47,443
Dad!
/ Go away!

1088
01:05:47,467 --> 01:05:49,467
Go now!

1089
01:05:49,491 --> 01:05:51,491
Run!

1090
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:53,515
Dad...

1091
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:02,439
There is nowhere to run.

1092
01:06:03,463 --> 01:06:04,463
Move aside.

1093
01:06:04,487 --> 01:06:06,487
He just wanted to save his father.

1094
01:06:06,511 --> 01:06:08,511
You don't have to be that cruel.

1095
01:06:11,435 --> 01:06:13,435
Hmph.

1096
01:06:17,459 --> 01:06:19,459
Ginseng bergamot,

1097
01:06:19,483 --> 01:06:21,483
cat's tail plant pollen,

1098
01:06:21,507 --> 01:06:24,407
munjeet, borneol,

1099
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:25,631
dragon blood.

1100
01:06:25,655 --> 01:06:27,655
Another basket of
hibiscus flowers,

1101
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:29,679
angelica,

1102
01:06:29,703 --> 01:06:31,403
pseudo ginseng powder,

1103
01:06:31,427 --> 01:06:33,427
sappanwood,

1104
01:06:33,451 --> 01:06:35,451
poisonous beans.
My lord,

1105
01:06:35,475 --> 01:06:37,475
Everything is complete according to the list,

1106
01:06:37,499 --> 01:06:40,499
along with 100 baskets of seafood.

1107
01:06:40,523 --> 01:06:43,423
It just so happens that our food supply is running low.

1108
01:06:45,447 --> 01:06:47,447
Teacher Shen, wait a minute.

1109
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:50,471
We have prepared the food.

1110
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,495
Would you kindly attend?

1111
01:06:57,419 --> 01:06:59,419
You...

1112
01:06:59,443 --> 01:07:01,443
Thanks to the kindness of Lord Li,

1113
01:07:01,467 --> 01:07:03,467
I was promoted to servant.

1114
01:07:03,491 --> 01:07:06,491
He may be a ghost,
but he has a good heart.

1115
01:07:06,515 --> 01:07:08,415
As long as you behave well,

1116
01:07:08,439 --> 01:07:10,439
there is no reason he should not have a future.

1117
01:07:11,463 --> 01:07:13,463
I wonder if
this dish suits your taste or not.

1118
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:14,487
Front...

1119
01:07:14,511 --> 01:07:15,811
reasonable.

1120
01:07:15,835 --> 01:07:17,435
Then add more.

1121
01:07:17,459 --> 01:07:20,459
Try this liquor too.
/ I stopped drinking liquor a long time ago.

1122
01:07:20,483 --> 01:07:23,483
In forging one must... suppress one's desires.

1123
01:07:23,507 --> 01:07:25,507
As the saying goes,

1124
01:07:25,531 --> 01:07:27,531
people must stop the urge
to perfect the soul.

1125
01:07:27,555 --> 01:07:28,655
Another expression says,

1126
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:31,479
one must practice well to polish virtue.

1127
01:07:32,403 --> 01:07:34,403
Talk won't help.

1128
01:07:34,427 --> 01:07:36,427
I've reached... the point of no return.

1129
01:07:36,451 --> 01:07:39,451
You can't hide forever.

1130
01:07:39,475 --> 01:07:42,475
Soon the truth will be revealed.

1131
01:07:42,499 --> 01:07:44,499
If you continue to harm lives

1132
01:07:44,523 --> 01:07:47,423
make more mistakes,
even though you can fool everyone,

1133
01:07:47,447 --> 01:07:49,447
you can't fool yourself.

1134
01:07:49,471 --> 01:07:52,471
And your further forging will not be better,

1135
01:07:52,495 --> 01:07:54,495
the point is that

1136
01:07:54,519 --> 01:07:56,519
Do good
and walk on the right path.

1137
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,543
Enough!
What nonsense!

1138
01:07:58,567 --> 01:08:01,467
You don't know anything about forging.

1139
01:08:09,491 --> 01:08:11,491
Sir!

1140
01:08:11,515 --> 01:08:13,515
Some came here to meet Master Shen.

1141
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:23,439
Brother.

1142
01:08:23,463 --> 01:08:26,463
Who did this to you?
/ Taoist.

1143
01:08:26,487 --> 01:08:29,487
They attacked.

1144
01:08:31,411 --> 01:08:32,411
Dad...

1145
01:08:32,435 --> 01:08:35,435
one hand

1146
01:08:35,459 --> 01:08:37,459
disconnected.

1147
01:08:37,483 --> 01:08:39,483
Who did this?

1148
01:08:39,507 --> 01:08:42,407
Her name is...

1149
01:08:42,431 --> 01:08:44,431
No...

1150
01:08:44,455 --> 01:08:47,455
Zha.

1151
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:05,479
Congratulations on passing Level 2.

1152
01:09:05,503 --> 01:09:09,403
Please tell Kak Wuliang.
/ The teacher in isolation is purifying the pill

1153
01:09:09,427 --> 01:09:12,427
and has not appeared yet.
/ Before Level 3,

1154
01:09:12,451 --> 01:09:14,451
why don't you just rest for a few days?

1155
01:09:14,475 --> 01:09:16,475
We only have 2 days left.

1156
01:09:16,499 --> 01:09:18,499
No need. I'm still fit.

1157
01:09:18,523 --> 01:09:21,423
Let's continue with the exam.
/ Well, if that's what you want.

1158
01:09:21,447 --> 01:09:23,447
Final test

1159
01:09:23,471 --> 01:09:25,471
is the Demon Queen of Skull Mountain,

1160
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:27,495
Shi Ji.

1161
01:09:29,419 --> 01:09:31,419
There are those who insist on seeing Master Taiyi.

1162
01:09:31,443 --> 01:09:33,443
Huh?
/ Help us!

1163
01:09:33,467 --> 01:09:35,467
Chentang Line...

1164
01:09:35,491 --> 01:09:37,491
Something happens!

1165
01:10:00,415 --> 01:10:02,415
Dad.

1166
01:10:02,439 --> 01:10:04,439
Mother.

1167
01:10:06,463 --> 01:10:08,463
Dad.

1168
01:10:09,487 --> 01:10:11,487
Mother.

1169
01:10:12,411 --> 01:10:14,411
Dad?

1170
01:10:15,435 --> 01:10:17,435
Mother?

1171
01:10:26,459 --> 01:10:28,459
Dad!

1172
01:10:28,483 --> 01:10:30,483
Mother!

1173
01:10:52,407 --> 01:10:54,407
Calm down.
Let's keep looking.

1174
01:10:54,431 --> 01:10:56,431
Keep looking.

1175
01:10:58,455 --> 01:11:00,455
I received an important report as soon as
I finished my exile.

1176
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:04,479
Who could commit such a terrible crime?

1177
01:11:04,503 --> 01:11:06,503
Teachers, according to Shieldos,

1178
01:11:06,527 --> 01:11:08,527
they were hit by a tremendous force

1179
01:11:08,551 --> 01:11:10,551
and lost consciousness.
When they woke up,

1180
01:11:10,575 --> 01:11:12,575
The people of Jalur Chentang have been massacred.

1181
01:11:12,599 --> 01:11:14,599
We haven't got that magic pill yet.

1182
01:11:14,623 --> 01:11:16,423
Why did they do that?

1183
01:11:16,447 --> 01:11:19,447
Brother, do you know something?

1184
01:11:19,471 --> 01:11:20,471
No, no.

1185
01:11:20,495 --> 01:11:23,495
I just wondered,
where does all this lava come from?

1186
01:11:24,419 --> 01:11:25,419
Correct.

1187
01:11:25,443 --> 01:11:27,443
There are no volcanoes for hundreds of kilometers.

1188
01:11:27,467 --> 01:11:29,467
This is very strange.

1189
01:11:30,491 --> 01:11:32,491
Everyone, come here quickly!

1190
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:35,415
What kind of ghost is this?

1191
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:37,439
This...

1192
01:11:38,463 --> 01:11:40,463
dragon claw marks.

1193
01:11:40,487 --> 01:11:42,487
Impossible!

1194
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:45,411
All the dragons are in the East Sea,

1195
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:47,435
protected by a Retaining Seal.

1196
01:11:47,459 --> 01:11:50,459
No one can leave.

1197
01:11:50,483 --> 01:11:52,483
Teacher, if I remember correctly,

1198
01:11:52,507 --> 01:11:54,507
Queen Ao Run of the West Sea

1199
01:11:54,531 --> 01:11:56,531
have special abilities

1200
01:11:56,555 --> 01:11:58,555
called Heaven...

1201
01:11:58,579 --> 01:12:01,479
Sky Splitting Claw.
You think he's using the Sky Splitting Claw

1202
01:12:01,503 --> 01:12:03,503
to cross to Chentang Pass?

1203
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:06,427
That explains the origin of this lava.
It must have been transported from a sacred fire from a distance.

1204
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:09,451
But he was watched by the Dragon King of the East Sea.

1205
01:12:09,475 --> 01:12:11,475
It was impossible for him to cross.

1206
01:12:11,499 --> 01:12:14,499
So there is only one more possibility left.

1207
01:12:14,523 --> 01:12:16,523
Something that worries me the most

1208
01:12:16,547 --> 01:12:18,547
happen.

1209
01:12:18,571 --> 01:12:21,471
The King of the Eastern Sea betrayed us?

1210
01:12:21,495 --> 01:12:23,495
This is a very serious accusation.

1211
01:12:23,519 --> 01:12:26,419
Maybe we are wrong?

1212
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:28,443
No.

1213
01:12:28,467 --> 01:12:30,467
They are the ones who did it!

1214
01:12:32,491 --> 01:12:34,491
What are you doing

1215
01:12:42,415 --> 01:12:43,415
Don't be reckless.

1216
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:45,439
Are you going to the Dragon Palace?

1217
01:12:45,463 --> 01:12:47,463
That's the way to Skull Mountain.

1218
01:12:47,487 --> 01:12:50,487
Dragons slaughter innocent people,

1219
01:12:50,511 --> 01:12:53,411
commit this unforgivable abomination.

1220
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:56,435
There is no need to consult with fellow Golden Gods.

1221
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:58,459
I'll attack first, explain later.

1222
01:12:58,483 --> 01:13:00,483
Crana, come back to the palace with me.

1223
01:13:00,507 --> 01:13:03,407
Call all Demon Hunters.

1224
01:13:03,431 --> 01:13:05,431
Okay.
/ Sis,

1225
01:13:05,455 --> 01:13:08,455
her parents Nezha were killed by the stealth.

1226
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:11,479
Don't let anything happen to that child.

1227
01:13:11,503 --> 01:13:13,503
Go with Deero to find him now.

1228
01:13:13,527 --> 01:13:15,527
Yes.

1229
01:13:18,451 --> 01:13:20,451
I know you are sad now,

1230
01:13:20,475 --> 01:13:22,475
but please can you
calm down for a moment?

1231
01:13:26,499 --> 01:13:28,499
Can you take me to the Dragon Palace first?

1232
01:13:28,523 --> 01:13:30,523
I will face my father and teacher

1233
01:13:30,547 --> 01:13:32,347
to get an explanation for all this.

1234
01:13:32,371 --> 01:13:34,471
Can it bring my parents back?

1235
01:13:42,495 --> 01:13:46,495
LEVEL 3:
SKULL MOUNTAIN

1236
01:13:47,419 --> 01:13:49,419
Mirror mirror on the wall,

1237
01:13:49,443 --> 01:13:52,443
Who is the most beautiful within 10 kilometers?

1238
01:13:52,467 --> 01:13:54,467
You, Your Highness.

1239
01:13:54,491 --> 01:13:56,491
RATU SHI JI

1240
01:13:54,491 --> 01:13:57,491
And who is the most beautiful for 100 kilometers?

1241
01:13:57,515 --> 01:13:59,515
You, Your Highness.

1242
01:13:59,539 --> 01:14:01,439
How about 1000 kilometers?
/ You, Mr. Queen.

1243
01:14:01,463 --> 01:14:02,763
And 10 thousand kilometers?
/ You, Mr. Queen.

1244
01:14:02,787 --> 01:14:04,787
And all over the world?
/ Still you, Lord Queen.

1245
01:14:05,411 --> 01:14:07,411
Do you think I'm stupid?
At the very least, lie smarter.

1246
01:14:07,435 --> 01:14:08,435
No, no.

1247
01:14:08,459 --> 01:14:11,459
I'm just trying to keep you from getting upset.

1248
01:14:11,483 --> 01:14:12,483
Do you know?

1249
01:14:12,507 --> 01:14:14,507
Telling the truth won't make me angry.

1250
01:14:14,531 --> 01:14:16,431
Seriously?

1251
01:14:16,455 --> 01:14:19,455
I, Queen Shi Ji, my beauty is indeed charming,

1252
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:21,479
but I know there is always someone more beautiful.

1253
01:14:21,503 --> 01:14:23,503
Please ask then.

1254
01:14:23,527 --> 01:14:25,527
Am I the most beautiful of them all?
/ No.

1255
01:14:25,551 --> 01:14:27,451
Fair enough.

1256
01:14:27,475 --> 01:14:30,475
Am I the most beautiful for 10 thousand kilometers?
/ No.

1257
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:31,799
How about 1000 kilometers?
/ No.

1258
01:14:31,823 --> 01:14:33,423
How about 100 kilometers?
/ No.

1259
01:14:33,447 --> 01:14:35,447
10 kilometers?
/ No.

1260
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,471
Am I the most beautiful on this mountain?

1261
01:14:38,495 --> 01:14:40,495
No.

1262
01:14:40,519 --> 01:14:43,419
You bastard!
There are no other women on this mountain.

1263
01:14:43,443 --> 01:14:45,443
I am a woman too.

1264
01:14:46,467 --> 01:14:48,467
You promised you wouldn't be angry.

1265
01:14:49,491 --> 01:14:51,491
You are prettier than me?

1266
01:14:51,515 --> 01:14:53,515
Please!
/ It's so annoying!

1267
01:14:56,439 --> 01:14:59,439
Demon, show yourself!

1268
01:14:59,463 --> 01:15:01,463
Who are you calling a demon?
The real one is Queen Shi Ji.

1269
01:15:14,487 --> 01:15:16,487
Damn brat.
Have we met?

1270
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:18,511
What do you want?

1271
01:15:20,435 --> 01:15:22,435
Your demonic energy could be discovered.
Leave it to me.

1272
01:15:22,459 --> 01:15:24,459
Don't interfere.

1273
01:15:46,483 --> 01:15:50,483
You think you can beat me?

1274
01:16:11,407 --> 01:16:16,407
This whole mountain is my body.

1275
01:16:16,431 --> 01:16:18,431
Just see how you destroy me.

1276
01:16:28,455 --> 01:16:31,455
If you force your strength any more,
your body will be destroyed!

1277
01:16:31,479 --> 01:16:32,479
I said,

1278
01:16:32,503 --> 01:16:36,403
don't interfere!

1279
01:16:46,427 --> 01:16:48,427
It's started!

1280
01:16:48,451 --> 01:16:50,451
Wow!

1281
01:16:56,475 --> 01:16:58,475
I'm finished.

1282
01:17:00,499 --> 01:17:02,499
Luckily there was still some left.

1283
01:17:02,523 --> 01:17:04,523
I will live to fight again.

1284
01:17:04,547 --> 01:17:06,547
Damn brat.
Just you wait.

1285
01:17:08,471 --> 01:17:10,471
Nine-Dragon Fire Trap!

1286
01:17:19,495 --> 01:17:21,495
Can't escape!

1287
01:17:22,419 --> 01:17:23,419
Oh my!

1288
01:17:23,443 --> 01:17:25,443
Reckless boy.

1289
01:17:25,467 --> 01:17:27,467
Your body is almost gone.

1290
01:17:27,491 --> 01:17:29,491
Do you want to commit suicide?

1291
01:17:29,515 --> 01:17:31,515
What was that fire?

1292
01:17:31,539 --> 01:17:34,439
Isn't Nezha
an ice wizard?

1293
01:17:34,463 --> 01:17:35,763
Who... said that?

1294
01:17:35,787 --> 01:17:37,487
Ice, fire, I taught him everything.

1295
01:17:37,511 --> 01:17:38,811
Its power is

1296
01:17:38,835 --> 01:17:41,435
combination of ice and fire.
/ Is that possible?

1297
01:17:41,459 --> 01:17:43,459
Mutiara Roh is blessed with unparalleled talent.
Don't judge her by normal standards.

1298
01:17:43,483 --> 01:17:45,483
Who among us is a teacher?

1299
01:17:45,507 --> 01:17:47,507
Do you think you know better than me?
/ I wouldn't dare.

1300
01:17:47,531 --> 01:17:48,531
However,

1301
01:17:48,555 --> 01:17:50,555
I do feel the presence

1302
01:17:50,579 --> 01:17:52,579
that powerful demonic energy earlier.

1303
01:17:52,603 --> 01:17:54,403
About that...

1304
01:17:54,427 --> 01:17:57,427
Shi Ji must be the one who released the demonic energy.
/ What did you say, fatty?

1305
01:17:57,451 --> 01:17:58,451
I don't...

1306
01:17:58,475 --> 01:18:00,475
Are you the one who released that energy?
Tell me, is that true?

1307
01:18:00,499 --> 01:18:02,499
Say it!
/ Yes, it is me.

1308
01:18:02,523 --> 01:18:04,523
Don't shake me.
I'm going to throw up!

1309
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:07,447
See? I told you.

1310
01:18:10,471 --> 01:18:13,471
Nezha, you have passed three levels.

1311
01:18:13,495 --> 01:18:16,495
Today, I personally recite

1312
01:18:16,519 --> 01:18:19,419
Ascension Mantra to you.

1313
01:18:26,443 --> 01:18:29,443
I've experienced all of this before.

1314
01:18:29,467 --> 01:18:32,467
Maybe I was too nervous.
The Ascension Mantra took longer than I remembered.

1315
01:18:43,491 --> 01:18:44,491
From now on,

1316
01:18:44,515 --> 01:18:48,415
you are the god of the Chan Sect.

1317
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:12,439
This is Yu Xu's Treasure Vault

1318
01:19:12,463 --> 01:19:15,463
home to all kinds of rare magical items.

1319
01:19:15,487 --> 01:19:17,487
Reparo miracle drug.

1320
01:19:17,511 --> 01:19:19,511
You can only choose one.

1321
01:19:19,535 --> 01:19:21,535
Don't you need to think about it first?
/ Reparo miracle drug.

1323
01:20:24,483 --> 01:20:26,483
Yu Xu Palace has sent an envoy

1324
01:20:26,507 --> 01:20:29,407
to tell the 12 Gods
about what the dragon did.

1325
01:20:29,431 --> 01:20:31,431
However, due to the great distance,

1326
01:20:31,455 --> 01:20:34,455
My brothers and sisters couldn't get here any faster.

1327
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:37,479
This time, I'm leading the hunt myself.

1328
01:20:37,503 --> 01:20:40,403
against the dragons.

1329
01:20:40,427 --> 01:20:41,927
Nezha,

1330
01:20:41,951 --> 01:20:44,451
Are you willing to fight with me?

1331
01:20:44,475 --> 01:20:46,475
Let me go back to Jalur Chentang first.

1332
01:20:46,499 --> 01:20:49,499
Then we will avenge the actions of the Dragon King.

1333
01:20:49,523 --> 01:20:51,423
Okay.

1334
01:20:51,447 --> 01:20:53,447
With your extraordinary combat abilities,

1335
01:20:53,471 --> 01:20:57,471
you will be of great help
in destroying the Dragon Palace.

1336
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:18,495
I have paid off

1337
01:21:18,519 --> 01:21:20,519
all my debts to you.

1338
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:21,543
Wait.

1339
01:21:21,567 --> 01:21:24,467
When I get my body back,
I'll go to the Dragon Palace with you, how about that?

1340
01:21:24,491 --> 01:21:26,491
You know exactly what I'm going to do.

1341
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:29,415
Your presence there will only make things difficult.

1342
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:34,439
Next time we meet,

1343
01:21:34,463 --> 01:21:37,463
we are enemies not friends.

1344
01:21:38,487 --> 01:21:39,487
Ugh...

1345
01:21:39,511 --> 01:21:41,511
This is Karma.

1346
01:21:44,435 --> 01:21:46,435
No, you don't go!

1347
01:21:46,459 --> 01:21:48,459
Your soul will be shattered
before you reach the Dragon Palace.

1348
01:21:53,483 --> 01:21:55,483
Nine-Dragon Fire Trap!

1349
01:22:02,407 --> 01:22:04,407
Can you calm down?

1350
01:22:04,431 --> 01:22:06,431
Leaving now
won't change anything.

1351
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:09,455
Don't bother me.
Let me out!

1352
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:11,479
No.
I promised Nezha.

1353
01:22:11,503 --> 01:22:13,503
I will save you no matter what.

1354
01:22:23,427 --> 01:22:26,427
Dad! Dad!

1355
01:22:26,451 --> 01:22:28,451
Suffocating!

DRAGON PALACE REMAINS

1358
01:23:21,423 --> 01:23:23,423
Who's that?

1359
01:23:23,447 --> 01:23:26,447
I'm so tired.

1360
01:23:26,471 --> 01:23:28,471
Ao Guang, do you admit guilt?

1361
01:23:30,495 --> 01:23:31,495
So,

1362
01:23:31,519 --> 01:23:33,419
did you know?

1363
01:23:33,443 --> 01:23:35,443
Is Ao Bing still alive?

1364
01:23:35,467 --> 01:23:37,467
I will accept whatever punishment you give,

1365
01:23:37,491 --> 01:23:39,491
but please forgive my son.

1366
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:40,515
Nonsense!

1367
01:23:40,539 --> 01:23:44,439
The Heavenly Palace ordered
your clan to hold back the monsters.

1368
01:23:44,463 --> 01:23:46,463
Not even colluding with them

1369
01:23:46,487 --> 01:23:48,487
and massacred the Chentang Line.

1370
01:23:48,511 --> 01:23:50,411
What?

1371
01:23:50,435 --> 01:23:52,435
The dragons have committed unforgivable crimes.

1372
01:23:52,459 --> 01:23:53,859
Today,

1373
01:23:53,883 --> 01:23:56,483
justice will be upheld.

1374
01:24:13,407 --> 01:24:15,407
Covering the earth and the sky.

1375
01:24:15,431 --> 01:24:18,431
Release the boundless power.
Let Tianyuan rise and stand tall.

1376
01:24:18,455 --> 01:24:21,455
Have full power over them all.

1377
01:24:21,479 --> 01:24:23,479
Open the Crater!

1378
01:24:52,403 --> 01:24:54,403
Show yourselves!

1379
01:24:57,427 --> 01:25:00,427
What have you done
to the Chentang Line?

1380
01:25:00,451 --> 01:25:02,451
Didn't you tell us?

1381
01:25:02,475 --> 01:25:04,475
to obey Master Shen's orders?

1382
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:06,499
Shen Gongbao?!

1383
01:25:16,423 --> 01:25:18,423
Speaking of emergencies,

1384
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:21,447
you have to focus on the present.

1385
01:25:23,471 --> 01:25:25,471
My king, we can't just sit here
waiting to die!

1386
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:28,495
If I join the fight,
the Restraining Seal will...

1387
01:25:28,519 --> 01:25:30,519
Just leave it to us.
Combine all our strengths,

1388
01:25:30,543 --> 01:25:32,543
we can hold it long enough.

1389
01:25:32,567 --> 01:25:34,567
Good.

1390
01:25:48,491 --> 01:25:50,491
I'm fed up!

1391
01:26:01,415 --> 01:26:03,415
You pathetic ghost!

1392
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:16,439
This is a once-in-a-thousand-years chance
for revenge.

1393
01:26:16,463 --> 01:26:19,463
Get out of this purgatory!

1394
01:26:19,487 --> 01:26:21,487
Destroy the Dragon Palace!

1395
01:27:53,411 --> 01:27:55,411
Soul Sword!

1396
01:28:15,435 --> 01:28:17,435
Old fool!
Taste my sword!

1397
01:28:32,459 --> 01:28:34,459
Releasing demonic energy like this...

1398
01:28:34,483 --> 01:28:36,483
Aren't you afraid of exposing your own identity?

1399
01:28:36,507 --> 01:28:38,507
I told you,

1400
01:28:38,531 --> 01:28:41,431
if you dare to harm the Chentang Pass,

1401
01:28:41,455 --> 01:28:45,455
I will destroy your palace to pieces!

1402
01:28:49,479 --> 01:28:50,479
Say it!

1403
01:28:50,503 --> 01:28:52,503
Is Ao Bing dead?

1404
01:29:56,427 --> 01:29:59,427
Hurry! Move!

1405
01:30:34,451 --> 01:30:36,451
Rise!

1406
01:31:46,475 --> 01:31:48,475
Any last message before you die?

1407
01:31:48,499 --> 01:31:51,499
Just see how long your body can take it.

1408
01:31:51,523 --> 01:31:53,523
I don't care whether I live or die.

1409
01:31:53,547 --> 01:31:55,547
As long as you die!

1410
01:32:13,471 --> 01:32:15,471
Now is the time!

1411
01:32:34,495 --> 01:32:36,495
Look at the consequences of your actions!

1412
01:32:36,519 --> 01:32:39,419
What mass extermination do you want?

1413
01:32:42,443 --> 01:32:44,443
The chain.

1414
01:32:50,467 --> 01:32:53,467
Even the Dragon King of the East Sea
is no match for your strength.

1415
01:32:53,491 --> 01:32:55,491
I was right all this time.

1416
01:32:55,515 --> 01:32:59,415
You are exactly what the Chan Sect needs.

1417
01:32:59,439 --> 01:33:03,439
Your parents spent their entire lives fighting crime.

1418
01:33:03,463 --> 01:33:06,463
From now on,
you must carry on their legacy.

1419
01:33:06,487 --> 01:33:10,487
and destroy all demons.

1420
01:33:11,411 --> 01:33:14,411
Let me avenge your loss

1421
01:33:14,435 --> 01:33:16,435
by turning all these bastards into pills.

1422
01:33:16,459 --> 01:33:18,459
Control me!
/ Yes, teacher!

1423
01:34:06,483 --> 01:34:08,483
Nezha!
/ Nezha!

1424
01:34:08,507 --> 01:34:10,507
Nezha!
/ Nezha!

1425
01:34:11,431 --> 01:34:13,431
Nezha!
/ Nezha!

1426
01:34:14,455 --> 01:34:15,455
Dad!

1427
01:34:15,479 --> 01:34:17,479
Nezha!
/ Ibu!

1428
01:34:17,503 --> 01:34:18,503
Nezha!

1429
01:34:18,527 --> 01:34:20,527
Nezha!

1430
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:26,451
Son, are you okay?

1431
01:34:26,475 --> 01:34:28,475
Your body...

1432
01:34:28,499 --> 01:34:31,499
I I...

1433
01:34:31,523 --> 01:34:34,423
They already know
about you and Ao Bing.

1434
01:34:35,447 --> 01:34:37,447
I I...

1435
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:39,471
I think...

1436
01:34:40,495 --> 01:34:45,495
will never meet you again.

1437
01:34:52,419 --> 01:34:54,419
The teacher was still chanting the mantra.

1438
01:34:54,443 --> 01:34:56,443
We have to buy as much time as possible.

1439
01:34:57,467 --> 01:35:00,467
Nezha, it wasn't my father who slaughtered the Chentyang Pass.

1440
01:35:01,491 --> 01:35:03,491
The real culprit

1441
01:35:03,515 --> 01:35:05,515
it is him, God Wuliang!

1442
01:35:24,439 --> 01:35:26,439
Shieldos!

1443
01:36:13,463 --> 01:36:15,463
For naga.

1444
01:36:15,487 --> 01:36:17,487
Brother,

1445
01:36:17,511 --> 01:36:19,511
Long time no see.

1446
01:36:19,535 --> 01:36:21,535
Why are you here?

1447
01:36:21,559 --> 01:36:23,559
Shen Gongbao,

1448
01:36:23,583 --> 01:36:25,583
You are in cahoots with the dragons.
What are you planning?

1449
01:36:25,607 --> 01:36:28,407
I should be the one asking... you.

1450
01:36:28,431 --> 01:36:31,431
You're the one who caught my father.
What are you planning?

1451
01:36:31,455 --> 01:36:34,455
Who said I caught your father?

1452
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:36,479
Only you know the condition of my family.

1453
01:36:36,503 --> 01:36:38,503
If you don't give that order,

1454
01:36:38,527 --> 01:36:42,427
why are Nezha and the Demon Hunters
hunting my father?

1455
01:36:42,451 --> 01:36:44,451
And my brother was injured by an arrow...

1456
01:36:44,475 --> 01:36:46,475
That's clear

1457
01:36:46,499 --> 01:36:49,499
caused by your disciple, Deero!

1458
01:36:54,423 --> 01:36:58,423
There are candidates that I recruited myself.

1459
01:36:58,447 --> 01:37:01,447
Nothing can escape you.

1460
01:37:02,471 --> 01:37:05,471
After all, I've been doing all
your dirty work for years.

1461
01:37:05,495 --> 01:37:07,495
I can also guess your purpose here

1462
01:37:07,519 --> 01:37:09,519
acting up on Chentang Trail.

1463
01:37:09,543 --> 01:37:13,443
You want to trap... trap the dragons,
don't you?

1464
01:37:13,467 --> 01:37:17,467
Is this how you repay me,
your brother and mentor?

1465
01:37:17,491 --> 01:37:21,491
You always use me...
for your own gain.

1466
01:37:21,515 --> 01:37:24,415
Between you and me,
there is only hatred, not gratitude.

1467
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:28,439
Can I make a deal with you?

1468
01:37:28,463 --> 01:37:30,463
God Teacher.

1469
01:37:30,487 --> 01:37:33,487
As the overseer of Yu Xu Palace,

1470
01:37:33,511 --> 01:37:37,411
You must know the spell to
release the Sea-Stabilizer Chain.

1471
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:39,435
I do know,

1472
01:37:39,459 --> 01:37:41,459
then why?

1473
01:37:41,483 --> 01:37:42,683
You... you want to rebel?

1474
01:37:42,707 --> 01:37:45,407
A thousand years ago, the four of us
fought against the heavenly realm together.

1475
01:37:45,431 --> 01:37:47,431
So who betrayed us and

1476
01:37:47,455 --> 01:37:48,755
throw us into purgatory?

1477
01:37:48,779 --> 01:37:50,479
Now Wuliang is targeting Ao Guang,

1478
01:37:50,503 --> 01:37:52,503
that's clearly what we want.

1479
01:37:52,527 --> 01:37:57,427
I have long heard that God Wuliang
recruits candidates without favoritism.

1480
01:37:57,451 --> 01:38:00,451
I believe you know very well what we can do.

1481
01:38:00,475 --> 01:38:03,475
If you can free us from purgatory

1482
01:38:03,499 --> 01:38:05,499
and help us achieve eternity,

1483
01:38:05,523 --> 01:38:07,523
We are ready to provide service.

1484
01:38:07,547 --> 01:38:11,447
Plus the secret of the Spirit Pearl and the Demon Orb.

1485
01:38:11,471 --> 01:38:13,471
Spirit Pearls and Devil Balls?
/ How sad!

1486
01:38:13,495 --> 01:38:17,495
Where... where is your enthusiasm to reply?

1487
01:38:17,519 --> 01:38:19,519
We were young and knew nothing!

1488
01:38:21,443 --> 01:38:23,443
A thousand years of imprisonment

1489
01:38:24,467 --> 01:38:26,467
has taught us about the rules

1490
01:38:26,491 --> 01:38:29,491
and its rulers.

1491
01:38:30,415 --> 01:38:32,415
Very clever.

1492
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:34,439
But you guys are so unpredictable.

1493
01:38:34,463 --> 01:38:38,463
How can I trust you guys?
Unless you let me give you...

1494
01:38:38,487 --> 01:38:40,487
We are ready.

1495
01:38:50,411 --> 01:38:52,411
The three dragons were willing to agree

1496
01:38:52,435 --> 01:38:54,435
to let Wuliang curse them.

1497
01:38:54,459 --> 01:38:56,459
If they try to disobey in the future,

1498
01:38:56,483 --> 01:38:59,483
Wuliang could take their lives at any time.

1499
01:38:59,507 --> 01:39:02,407
Wuliang then fulfilled his promise,

1500
01:39:02,431 --> 01:39:04,431
freeing them from the Ocean Stabilizer Chains.

1501
01:39:06,455 --> 01:39:08,455
Whenever a power is found,

1502
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:10,479
he orchestrated the massacre,
framed others,

1503
01:39:10,503 --> 01:39:12,503
and sent troops to capture them.

1504
01:39:12,527 --> 01:39:14,427
Menu Shen Gongbao,

1505
01:39:14,451 --> 01:39:17,451
He often did such tasks for Wuliang.

1506
01:39:17,475 --> 01:39:19,475
The reward was the opportunity
to join the Chan Sect.

1507
01:39:20,499 --> 01:39:23,499
This time, Wuliang came to destroy the Chentang Pass.

1508
01:39:23,523 --> 01:39:26,423
and trap the East Sea dragon.

1509
01:39:26,447 --> 01:39:27,547
One thing leads to another,

1510
01:39:27,571 --> 01:39:29,471
he eventually recruited tifa the dragon king.

1511
01:39:29,495 --> 01:39:30,495
and from them,

1512
01:39:30,519 --> 01:39:33,419
he knows the secret of the Demon Orb and the Spirit Pearl.

1513
01:39:35,443 --> 01:39:36,443
After that,

1514
01:39:36,467 --> 01:39:39,467
they intentionally left
2 survivors clueless

1515
01:39:39,491 --> 01:39:42,491
to tell the story of the events
that befell Yu Xu Palace.

1516
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:06,415
Seeing no hope of breaking through,

1517
01:40:06,439 --> 01:40:08,439
Shen Gongbao had one plan.

1518
01:40:08,463 --> 01:40:10,463
He told the Yaksha to scare us,

1519
01:40:10,487 --> 01:40:13,487
then hid us in the drain.

1520
01:40:13,511 --> 01:40:16,411
Then, he waited for
the right moment to pick us up.

1521
01:40:16,435 --> 01:40:18,435
And you?

1522
01:40:18,459 --> 01:40:20,459
My family is gone.

1523
01:40:20,483 --> 01:40:22,483
There's nothing left for me to hold on to.

1524
01:40:26,407 --> 01:40:28,407
There!

1525
01:40:43,431 --> 01:40:45,431
The demons captured by the Demon Hunters

1526
01:40:45,455 --> 01:40:47,455
not what outsiders think,

1527
01:40:47,479 --> 01:40:50,479
changed his nature in Yu Xu Palace.

1528
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:54,403
Instead, they were thrown
into the Tianyuan Crater by Wuliang.

1529
01:40:54,427 --> 01:40:58,427
refined into an immortality pill
to strengthen the power of the Chan Sect.

1530
01:40:58,451 --> 01:40:59,451
Brother,

1531
01:40:59,475 --> 01:41:02,475
How could you do such a cruel thing?

1532
01:41:02,499 --> 01:41:04,499
How...
how can you explain to our teacher?

1533
01:41:04,523 --> 01:41:06,523
and the teachings we have received?

1534
01:41:06,547 --> 01:41:09,447
Now that you know what Wuliang did,

1535
01:41:09,471 --> 01:41:11,471
You have to stop before it's too late.

1536
01:41:11,495 --> 01:41:14,495
Take him back to the palace
to receive the Great God's punishment.

1537
01:41:21,419 --> 01:41:25,419
The Demon Hunters were personally
trained by Master Wuliang.

1538
01:41:25,443 --> 01:41:28,443
You think a few words can turn us
against him?

1539
01:41:29,467 --> 01:41:30,467
It turns out,

1540
01:41:30,491 --> 01:41:32,491
My suspicions about the dragons were wrong all this time.

1541
01:41:36,415 --> 01:41:38,415
Release them!

1542
01:41:56,439 --> 01:41:58,439
Let me help you.

1543
01:42:21,463 --> 01:42:23,463
You betrayed us?

1544
01:42:23,487 --> 01:42:25,487
We learned that from you, sis.

1545
01:42:25,511 --> 01:42:27,511
In the past, in order to protect our people,

1546
01:42:27,535 --> 01:42:29,535
I have no other choice!

1547
01:42:29,559 --> 01:42:31,559
Well, in order to protect myself now,

1548
01:42:32,483 --> 01:42:34,483
I have no choice.

1549
01:42:35,407 --> 01:42:36,607
My king, wait for us!

1550
01:42:36,631 --> 01:42:39,431
Don't leave us!
/ My king, take us!

1551
01:42:39,455 --> 01:42:41,455
King! King!

1552
01:42:45,479 --> 01:42:47,479
You have all been betrayed!

1553
01:42:56,403 --> 01:42:58,403
Dragon King of the South Sea.

1554
01:43:02,427 --> 01:43:04,427
Dragon King of the North Sea.

1555
01:43:08,451 --> 01:43:11,451
Dragon Queen of the West Sea.
[AO QIN - AO RUN - AO SHUN]

1556
01:43:19,475 --> 01:43:21,475
Nephew,

1557
01:43:21,499 --> 01:43:23,499
now it's time to play with your uncle.

1558
01:43:34,423 --> 01:43:36,423
Feel my spear!

1559
01:43:42,447 --> 01:43:44,447
Feel my axe!

1560
01:43:46,471 --> 01:43:48,471
Feel my wheels!

1561
01:44:21,495 --> 01:44:23,495
Feel my wheel 100 times!
200 times!

1562
01:44:23,519 --> 01:44:25,519
300 times!

1563
01:44:30,443 --> 01:44:32,443
That's enough, huh?

1564
01:44:32,467 --> 01:44:34,467
Nonsense!
Not that much.

1565
01:44:34,491 --> 01:44:36,491
Your body is still unstable.
Don't push yourself.

1566
01:44:36,515 --> 01:44:41,415
Because of my mistake,
I am willing to give up my life to free the dragon.

1567
01:44:41,439 --> 01:44:44,439
Young and brave.

1568
01:44:45,463 --> 01:44:47,463
Let me play with you, kid.

1569
01:45:19,487 --> 01:45:21,487
Harassing a small child,
despicable and shameless!

1570
01:45:31,411 --> 01:45:32,411
Hey!

1571
01:45:32,435 --> 01:45:34,435
How dare you attack your teacher's brother!
Bullying an uncle,

1572
01:45:34,459 --> 01:45:36,459
eat pig's feet!

1573
01:46:14,483 --> 01:46:16,483
This isn't going to work.
This is messed up.

1574
01:46:16,507 --> 01:46:18,507
So let's make it even more chaotic.
How about steam?

1575
01:46:19,431 --> 01:46:21,431
Of course.

1576
01:46:24,455 --> 01:46:26,455
Finish them off!

1577
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:34,479
Beware of sneak attacks!

1578
01:46:41,403 --> 01:46:43,403
There you are.

1579
01:46:45,427 --> 01:46:47,427
Be careful, it's me!
/ Sis?

1580
01:46:47,451 --> 01:46:49,451
Sorry.

1581
01:46:49,475 --> 01:46:51,475
Nezha!

1582
01:46:52,499 --> 01:46:54,499
Ah!

1583
01:46:55,423 --> 01:46:57,423
Surprise!

1584
01:46:57,447 --> 01:46:58,447
Hahaha!

1585
01:46:58,471 --> 01:47:00,471
Shapeshifting Spell?

1586
01:47:05,495 --> 01:47:08,495
Are you crazy?
/ You can't fool me.

1587
01:47:10,419 --> 01:47:11,419
Hmm.

1588
01:47:11,443 --> 01:47:13,443
What are you...
/ Code.

1589
01:47:13,467 --> 01:47:15,467
My older siblings' toenails are like my grandfather's toenails.

1590
01:47:15,491 --> 01:47:17,491
What?
/ You don't know the code.

1591
01:47:17,515 --> 01:47:19,515
Imposter! (Impostor).

1592
01:47:19,539 --> 01:47:21,539
So you're an Imposter!

1593
01:47:26,463 --> 01:47:28,463
Hard to believe!

1594
01:47:34,487 --> 01:47:36,487
You deserve that.

1595
01:47:36,511 --> 01:47:37,511
Hmm.

1596
01:47:37,535 --> 01:47:38,535
Code.

1597
01:47:38,559 --> 01:47:44,359
Eh... Grated coconut, scratched head?

1598
01:47:44,383 --> 01:47:45,383
Wrong!

1599
01:47:45,407 --> 01:47:47,407
The correct one is "My older siblings' toenails
are like my grandfather's toenails"

1600
01:47:47,431 --> 01:47:49,431
and my grandfather's nails are stiff".

1601
01:47:49,455 --> 01:47:51,455
I'm the real one!

1602
01:47:51,479 --> 01:47:53,479
How come I don't know this code?

1603
01:47:53,503 --> 01:47:55,503
We just made it up!

1604
01:47:56,427 --> 01:47:58,427
Can't you make it easier?

1605
01:47:58,451 --> 01:48:01,451
It's so hard!

1606
01:48:02,475 --> 01:48:04,475
You idiot!

1607
01:48:04,499 --> 01:48:05,899
Don't come near me!
Imposter!

1608
01:48:05,923 --> 01:48:08,423
I'm the real Ao Shun!
/ Lie! You don't know the code!

1609
01:48:08,447 --> 01:48:10,447
You don't know either!

1610
01:48:10,471 --> 01:48:11,471
That's right.

1611
01:48:11,495 --> 01:48:13,495
Does that mean I'm an Imposter too?

1612
01:48:14,419 --> 01:48:16,419
Oh my god.

1613
01:48:16,443 --> 01:48:18,443
Tai Chi flows in divine harmony.
The five elements are perfectly aligned.

1614
01:48:18,467 --> 01:48:20,467
The true fire of Samadhi ignites gold.

1615
01:48:20,491 --> 01:48:22,491
One perfect pill, its power revealed.

1616
01:48:22,515 --> 01:48:24,515
Go and Rise!

1617
01:48:51,439 --> 01:48:53,439
What are you afraid of?

1618
01:48:53,463 --> 01:48:56,463
We're used to soaking in lava
as if we don't feel anything.

1619
01:48:56,487 --> 01:48:58,487
Hot! Hot!

1620
01:49:01,411 --> 01:49:02,411
Oh no!

1621
01:49:02,435 --> 01:49:04,435
This is the true fire of Samadhi.

1622
01:49:06,459 --> 01:49:07,459
What do you see?

1623
01:49:07,483 --> 01:49:10,483
If anyone has to eat this,
it's me!

1624
01:49:13,407 --> 01:49:15,407
It's also delicious.

1625
01:49:19,431 --> 01:49:21,431
Let go of my father!

1626
01:49:21,455 --> 01:49:23,455
Hey!
/ Freeze!

1627
01:49:34,479 --> 01:49:36,479
What a great Spirit Pearl!

1628
01:49:36,503 --> 01:49:39,403
A perfect match for the Devil's Ball.

1629
01:49:41,427 --> 01:49:43,427
Ao Bing!

1630
01:49:43,451 --> 01:49:45,451
Hyah!

1631
01:49:45,475 --> 01:49:47,475
Frozen!

1632
01:49:57,449 --> 01:49:59,449
Ah!
The Heart-Piercing Curse.

1633
01:49:59,473 --> 01:50:03,473
Since I already know your identities,

1634
01:50:03,497 --> 01:50:06,497
How could I not have a backup plan?

1635
01:50:09,421 --> 01:50:10,421
This is impossible!

1636
01:50:10,445 --> 01:50:11,745
The curse is quite complicated.

1637
01:50:11,769 --> 01:50:13,769
When can you cast it?

1638
01:50:14,493 --> 01:50:15,493
Oh...

1639
01:50:15,517 --> 01:50:17,517
That's why the Ascension Mantra is so long.

1640
01:50:17,541 --> 01:50:19,541
You inserted something.

1641
01:50:50,465 --> 01:50:52,465
You old fart!

1642
01:50:56,489 --> 01:50:58,489
Even the Devil's Ball

1643
01:50:58,513 --> 01:51:03,413
won't be able to escape
the Heart-Piercing Curse that quickly.

1644
01:51:03,437 --> 01:51:07,437
A thousand thorns have pierced your veins.

1645
01:51:07,461 --> 01:51:09,461
Struggling at any time

1646
01:51:09,485 --> 01:51:11,485
will only result in your body

1647
01:51:11,509 --> 01:51:13,509
torn.

1648
01:51:14,433 --> 01:51:18,433
No wonder I can't feel the aura of life.

1649
01:51:18,457 --> 01:51:22,457
You guys are petrified.

1650
01:51:22,481 --> 01:51:25,481
But still alive.
Just hurt Nezha.

1651
01:51:27,405 --> 01:51:29,405
Pearl of the Spirit

1652
01:51:30,429 --> 01:51:32,429
and the Devil's Ball

1653
01:51:32,453 --> 01:51:34,453
is a valuable asset.

1654
01:51:34,477 --> 01:51:38,477
I can treat you well

1655
01:51:41,401 --> 01:51:44,401
but now it is only made into pills.

1656
01:51:59,425 --> 01:52:01,425
Ao Bing!

1657
01:52:01,449 --> 01:52:02,649
Dad!
/ You...

1658
01:52:02,673 --> 01:52:03,973
you are still alive!

1659
01:52:03,997 --> 01:52:05,497
Uh!

1660
01:52:05,521 --> 01:52:07,521
The Heart-Piercing Curse was cast by Wuliang.

1661
01:52:07,545 --> 01:52:09,545
And it was he who massacred the Chentang Pass
, trapping it as if it was the work of the dragons.

1662
01:52:12,469 --> 01:52:14,469
Father, Nezha has been deceived.

1663
01:52:14,493 --> 01:52:17,493
Don't blame him.
/ Whatever you want to do, do it to me.

1664
01:52:17,517 --> 01:52:19,517
Don't bother my parents.

1665
01:52:24,441 --> 01:52:26,441
Killing you won't change anything.

1666
01:52:41,465 --> 01:52:43,465
We are all condemned to die here.

1667
01:52:43,489 --> 01:52:46,489
If anyone still holds a grudge,

1668
01:52:47,413 --> 01:52:49,413
please go ahead.

1669
01:52:57,437 --> 01:53:00,437
Brother, the Chan Sect has a noble reputation,

1670
01:53:00,461 --> 01:53:04,461
How could you do something so cruel?

1671
01:53:04,485 --> 01:53:06,485
Don't make the same mistake again!

1672
01:53:06,509 --> 01:53:08,509
Why don't you just go back
and confess to Master?

1673
01:53:08,533 --> 01:53:10,533
I will ask for forgiveness on your behalf.

1674
01:53:10,557 --> 01:53:11,557
You...

1675
01:53:11,581 --> 01:53:14,481
you idiot who's talking nonsense!

1676
01:53:14,505 --> 01:53:17,405
Should the place of the gods in this world be secured?

1677
01:53:17,429 --> 01:53:19,429
or you lazy ungrateful people

1678
01:53:19,453 --> 01:53:22,453
who are half-hearted like the demons,

1679
01:53:22,477 --> 01:53:25,477
I will not waste
my time and effort all this time!

1680
01:53:25,501 --> 01:53:27,501
Even though this will result
in my destruction

1681
01:53:27,525 --> 01:53:29,025
and my own humiliation,

1682
01:53:29,049 --> 01:53:32,449
I do this
for the eternal power of the Chan Sect.

1683
01:53:32,473 --> 01:53:34,473
Conscience...

1684
01:53:34,497 --> 01:53:35,497
Conscience...

1685
01:53:35,521 --> 01:53:37,521
Conscience...

1686
01:53:40,445 --> 01:53:42,745
My conscience is clear.

1687
01:53:45,469 --> 01:53:47,469
Another one is ripe.

1688
01:53:47,493 --> 01:53:49,493
I can't eat it anymore.
You should try it.

1689
01:53:49,517 --> 01:53:50,517
Thank You.

1690
01:53:50,541 --> 01:53:53,441
When my fins are cooked,
you should try them too.

1691
01:53:53,465 --> 01:53:56,465
The chicken feet are also cooked.
We can exchange and share.

1692
01:53:56,489 --> 01:53:58,489
What is this?

1693
01:53:58,513 --> 01:54:01,413
My body...

1694
01:54:03,437 --> 01:54:04,737
He became a pill!

1695
01:54:04,761 --> 01:54:06,461
I'm still very young.

1696
01:54:06,485 --> 01:54:09,485
I don't want to die.
No, let me out.

1697
01:54:09,509 --> 01:54:10,509
Please!

1698
01:54:10,533 --> 01:54:12,533
Stay calm!

1699
01:54:12,557 --> 01:54:14,557
Focus on your energy!

1700
01:54:14,581 --> 01:54:17,481
Hang on as long as you can.

1701
01:54:24,405 --> 01:54:25,405
Son!

1702
01:54:25,429 --> 01:54:27,429
Your power is greater than father's.

1703
01:54:27,453 --> 01:54:28,553
You can get through this.

1704
01:54:28,577 --> 01:54:30,577
If you can hold out
until this heart-piercing curse disappears,

1705
01:54:30,601 --> 01:54:32,401
you may have a chance to escape.

1706
01:54:32,425 --> 01:54:35,425
The heart-piercing curse
takes at least 6 hours to cast.

1707
01:54:35,449 --> 01:54:36,449
I'm scared,

1708
01:54:36,473 --> 01:54:38,473
I won't be able to last that long.

1709
01:54:44,497 --> 01:54:45,597
My wife.
/ Mother!

1710
01:54:45,621 --> 01:54:47,621
Wake up, mom.

1711
01:54:47,645 --> 01:54:49,645
Nezha, Nezha?

1712
01:54:50,469 --> 01:54:52,469
Nezha.
/ I'm here, ma'am.

1713
01:54:52,493 --> 01:54:54,493
You guys don't give up.

1714
01:54:54,517 --> 01:54:56,517
Don't worry about us.

1715
01:54:56,541 --> 01:54:57,541
Try to

1716
01:54:57,565 --> 01:55:00,465
Stay focused.
/ I'm fine, ma'am.

1717
01:55:00,489 --> 01:55:02,489
I don't feel the fire.

1718
01:55:02,513 --> 01:55:04,513
Nobody can kill you, son.

1719
01:55:04,537 --> 01:55:06,437
If I'm right,

1720
01:55:06,461 --> 01:55:09,461
the fire of the Devil's Ball and the true fire of Samadhi

1721
01:55:09,485 --> 01:55:11,485
originally the same.

1722
01:55:11,509 --> 01:55:14,409
Then this Tianyuan Cauldron cannot harm you.

1723
01:55:14,433 --> 01:55:15,433
That's right.

1724
01:55:15,457 --> 01:55:17,457
I am wrong.

1725
01:55:20,481 --> 01:55:22,481
Don't bother.

1726
01:55:22,505 --> 01:55:24,505
This is just my avatar.

1727
01:55:25,429 --> 01:55:27,429
As I suspected, the Devil's Ball

1728
01:55:27,453 --> 01:55:29,453
indestructible.

1729
01:55:29,477 --> 01:55:34,477
No wonder the Great God had to
destroy you with the Wrath of Heaven.

1730
01:55:38,401 --> 01:55:40,401
Nezha,

1731
01:55:40,425 --> 01:55:43,425
I see you are a good boy.

1732
01:55:43,449 --> 01:55:46,449
How about I give you a chance
to prove it?

1733
01:55:46,473 --> 01:55:48,473
Forgetful Pill.

1734
01:55:48,497 --> 01:55:50,497
Eat this.

1735
01:55:50,521 --> 01:55:52,521
and I will release your parents.

1736
01:55:52,545 --> 01:55:54,545
What do you think?

1737
01:55:54,569 --> 01:55:56,569
Maybe I'm cruel,

1738
01:55:56,593 --> 01:55:59,493
but I always keep my promises.

1739
01:55:59,517 --> 01:56:02,417
Otherwise, those ghostly bigwigs

1740
01:56:02,441 --> 01:56:05,441
will not swear allegiance to me.

1741
01:56:05,465 --> 01:56:07,465
As long as you eat this,

1742
01:56:07,489 --> 01:56:09,489
I swear to the Heavens,

1743
01:56:09,513 --> 01:56:11,513
I will not harm your parents.

1744
01:56:26,437 --> 01:56:28,437
What are you doing?

1745
01:56:28,461 --> 01:56:31,461
Using the lives of parents
to threaten a child?

1746
01:56:31,485 --> 01:56:34,485
And you call yourself a god?
You don't even deserve to be human.

1747
01:56:36,409 --> 01:56:39,409
Nezha, just leave us alone.

1748
01:56:39,433 --> 01:56:41,433
You have to stay alive.

1749
01:56:41,457 --> 01:56:43,457
Hang in there until the heart-piercing curse is gone

1750
01:56:43,481 --> 01:56:45,481
or your two brothers are looking for you.

1751
01:56:45,505 --> 01:56:48,405
You think I can't kill the Demon Ball?

1752
01:56:48,429 --> 01:56:51,429
It's just a matter of time.

1753
01:56:51,453 --> 01:56:53,453
Once you die,

1754
01:56:53,477 --> 01:56:56,477
I have hundreds of ways to destroy him.

1755
01:57:00,401 --> 01:57:05,401
I just don't want to die in vain.

1756
01:57:05,425 --> 01:57:08,425
Why don't you just let me eat it?

1757
01:57:08,449 --> 01:57:11,449
Why did mom forbid it?

1758
01:57:11,473 --> 01:57:15,473
If you sacrifice your life for our lives,

1759
01:57:15,497 --> 01:57:19,497
Do you think we will be able to live in peace?

1760
01:57:20,421 --> 01:57:22,421
Nezha.

1761
01:57:22,445 --> 01:57:25,445
No, ma'am.

1762
01:57:25,469 --> 01:57:27,469
It will hurt you.
/ It's okay.

1763
01:57:27,493 --> 01:57:30,493
This is the end.

1764
01:57:30,517 --> 01:57:34,417
Mom just wants to hug you one last time.

1765
01:57:34,441 --> 01:57:36,441
This.

1766
01:57:36,465 --> 01:57:40,465
I don't think I'll be able to see you grow up.

1767
01:57:40,489 --> 01:57:43,489
From now on,

1768
01:57:43,513 --> 01:57:46,413
You have to determine your own path.

1769
01:58:54,437 --> 01:58:57,437
I... I'm useless.

1770
01:58:57,461 --> 01:59:00,461
Useless.

1771
01:59:00,485 --> 01:59:03,485
I was born as a devil,

1772
01:59:03,509 --> 01:59:06,409
and always make you suffer.

1773
01:59:06,433 --> 01:59:08,433
I really want to,

1774
01:59:08,457 --> 01:59:10,457
make you proud.

1775
01:59:16,481 --> 01:59:20,481
This is all my fault.

1776
01:59:20,505 --> 01:59:24,405
I'm sorry, Mom.

1777
01:59:24,429 --> 01:59:27,429
Forgive me.

1778
01:59:27,453 --> 01:59:31,453
Every day I'm with you,

1779
01:59:31,477 --> 01:59:34,477
I am so happy.

1780
01:59:34,501 --> 01:59:38,401
I never cared

1781
01:59:38,425 --> 01:59:40,425
are you a god

1782
01:59:40,449 --> 01:59:42,449
or the devil.

1783
01:59:42,473 --> 01:59:45,473
What I know

1784
01:59:45,497 --> 01:59:49,497
you are my son.

1785
01:59:50,421 --> 01:59:52,421
Mother

1786
01:59:52,445 --> 01:59:54,445
will always

1787
01:59:54,469 --> 01:59:56,469
loving...

1788
02:00:35,493 --> 02:00:37,493
Nezha, stay calm!

1789
02:00:37,517 --> 02:00:38,517
Stop!

1790
02:00:38,541 --> 02:00:40,541
Your body could be torn apart!

1791
02:01:22,465 --> 02:01:26,465
What True Samadhi has given in return

1792
02:01:26,489 --> 02:01:28,489
the need for fire to re-form the body.

1793
02:01:28,513 --> 02:01:30,513
Nezha's physical form

1794
02:01:31,437 --> 02:01:34,437
it's whole now!

1795
02:01:49,461 --> 02:01:50,461
Dad,

1796
02:01:50,485 --> 02:01:52,485
Take care of your mother.

1797
02:02:04,409 --> 02:02:07,409
Help me get through this crater!

1798
02:02:39,433 --> 02:02:40,433
Oh no!

1799
02:02:40,457 --> 02:02:42,457
They absorbed the energy of Tianyuan Crater!

1800
02:02:44,481 --> 02:02:46,481
Maximum Roots!

1801
02:03:11,405 --> 02:03:13,405
Demon Hunter, by my command,

1802
02:03:13,429 --> 02:03:15,429
proceed!

1803
02:04:10,453 --> 02:04:12,453
Dad, you have to save your energy
for self-protection.

1804
02:04:12,477 --> 02:04:15,477
We've been backwards for too long.

1805
02:04:15,501 --> 02:04:19,401
We thought if we gave up everything,
Wuliang would let us live.

1806
02:04:19,425 --> 02:04:22,425
But in the end, they still want us dead.

1807
02:04:22,449 --> 02:04:24,449
If that's what they want,

1808
02:04:24,473 --> 02:04:27,473
then we will fight them to the death!

1809
02:04:27,497 --> 02:04:30,497
Yes, let's fight!

1810
02:04:30,521 --> 02:04:33,421
Fight! Fight! Fight!

1811
02:04:43,445 --> 02:04:46,445
Don't let them out!

1812
02:05:32,469 --> 02:05:34,469
Don't give up!

1813
02:05:34,493 --> 02:05:36,493
Hang in there!

1814
02:06:00,417 --> 02:06:02,417
han...curious...

1815
02:06:02,441 --> 02:06:05,441
right!

1816
02:06:55,465 --> 02:06:57,465
The crater!

1817
02:06:57,489 --> 02:06:58,489
My pit!

1818
02:06:58,513 --> 02:07:01,413
That is the foundation of the Chan Sect!

1819
02:07:56,437 --> 02:08:00,437
Kill all these bastards!

1820
02:08:05,461 --> 02:08:07,461
Attack!

1821
02:08:41,485 --> 02:08:44,485
You ungrateful traitor.

1822
02:08:44,509 --> 02:08:46,509
Can't tell right from wrong!

1823
02:08:59,433 --> 02:09:01,433
Dragon Wave Roars!

1824
02:09:11,457 --> 02:09:14,457
So his two henchmen are monsters too.

1825
02:09:14,481 --> 02:09:16,481
Demon, god...

1826
02:09:16,505 --> 02:09:19,405
it's all part of your trick!

1827
02:09:19,429 --> 02:09:21,429
You lowly, despicable person.

1828
02:09:21,453 --> 02:09:23,453
How dare you defy me!

1829
02:09:47,477 --> 02:09:50,477
Witness my true power!

1830
02:11:44,401 --> 02:11:46,401
I will give you both

1831
02:11:46,425 --> 02:11:48,425
one last chance because
I am a valuable candidate.

1832
02:11:48,449 --> 02:11:52,449
Surrender now
and I will grant you immortality.

1833
02:11:52,473 --> 02:11:54,473
To hell with eternity!

1834
02:11:54,497 --> 02:11:56,497
I am all demons.

1835
02:11:56,521 --> 02:11:58,521
So why?

1836
02:12:01,445 --> 02:12:04,445
You claim to be a guiding light,

1837
02:12:04,469 --> 02:12:06,469
but all you do is bully the weak,

1838
02:12:06,493 --> 02:12:07,793
and bring chaos to the world.

1839
02:12:07,794 --> 02:12:09,794
You are the real evil!

1840
02:12:17,418 --> 02:12:19,418
You idiot, you don't know anything,

1841
02:12:19,442 --> 02:12:21,442
the god who rules the world.

1842
02:12:21,466 --> 02:12:24,466
Sideing with those in power
is the only way out.

1843
02:12:24,490 --> 02:12:28,490
Whether you accept it or not,
there is nowhere for you to run.

1844
02:12:28,514 --> 02:12:30,514
If there is no purpose to go,

1845
02:12:30,538 --> 02:12:32,538
I will pave my own way!

1846
02:12:36,462 --> 02:12:38,462
If not accepted,

1847
02:12:38,486 --> 02:12:42,486
I will return it!

1848
02:12:52,410 --> 02:12:54,410
Teacher!

1849
02:12:55,434 --> 02:12:57,434
My face...

1850
02:12:57,458 --> 02:12:58,458
You guys...

1851
02:12:58,482 --> 02:13:01,482
stupid brats have
broken my Eternal Youth Spell!

1852
02:13:01,506 --> 02:13:04,406
Old fart.

1853
02:13:16,430 --> 02:13:19,430
Camp... back to the palace.

1854
02:13:31,454 --> 02:13:33,454
Wait for me!

1855
02:14:15,478 --> 02:14:17,478
My father plans to lead the dragons

1856
02:14:17,502 --> 02:14:19,502
deep into the ocean to hide.

1857
02:14:19,526 --> 02:14:21,526
Now that your identity has been revealed,
why don't you come with us?

1858
02:14:22,450 --> 02:14:24,450
No.

1859
02:14:24,474 --> 02:14:26,474
All my life I have been hiding,

1860
02:14:26,498 --> 02:14:27,698
hide oneself

1861
02:14:27,722 --> 02:14:29,422
until there is nowhere to run.

1862
02:14:29,446 --> 02:14:32,446
Now I finally know
how to face this world.

1863
02:14:32,470 --> 02:14:34,470
Wuliang is one of the most powerful gods

1864
02:14:34,494 --> 02:14:37,494
and trusted by the Great God.

1865
02:14:37,518 --> 02:14:39,518
Maybe he didn't fall that easily.

1866
02:14:39,542 --> 02:14:41,542
Besides, gods and demons
walk on different paths.

1867
02:14:41,566 --> 02:14:43,566
like fire and water.

1868
02:14:43,590 --> 02:14:45,590
God, ghost...

1869
02:14:45,614 --> 02:14:48,414
All just an excuse to control
those who are different.

1870
02:14:49,438 --> 02:14:51,438
So what?

1871
02:14:51,462 --> 02:14:53,462
Do you think you can change that?

1872
02:14:57,486 --> 02:14:59,486
I want to try.

1873
02:15:02,410 --> 02:15:04,410
Maybe I'm too old

1874
02:15:04,434 --> 02:15:07,434
to fight against the world.

1875
02:15:07,458 --> 02:15:09,458
Ao Bing.

1876
02:15:44,482 --> 02:15:47,482
Dad knows
after you decide,

1877
02:15:47,506 --> 02:15:49,506
you will always continue.

1878
02:15:50,430 --> 02:15:53,430
My son, in the past,

1879
02:15:53,454 --> 02:15:55,454
father put a heavy burden on you,

1880
02:15:55,478 --> 02:15:58,478
never care what you think.

1881
02:15:58,502 --> 02:16:00,502
Dad apologizes.

1882
02:16:00,526 --> 02:16:05,426
Dad just wants to use my experience
to give you a good life.

1883
02:16:05,450 --> 02:16:07,450
But now dad knows,

1884
02:16:07,474 --> 02:16:09,474
The experiences of the older generation
are just the past,

1885
02:16:09,498 --> 02:16:12,498
and may not be right for you.

1886
02:16:13,422 --> 02:16:16,422
You have to walk your own path.

1887
02:16:17,446 --> 02:16:19,446
From now on,

1888
02:16:19,470 --> 02:16:21,470
follow your heart.

1889
02:16:53,494 --> 02:16:55,494
I knew you would come back.
/ Why?

1890
02:16:56,418 --> 02:16:58,418
Because we are both too young.

1891
02:17:01,442 --> 02:17:04,442
Too young to be afraid.
