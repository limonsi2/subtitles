3
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,560
In every corner of the world
people are protesting.

4
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,680
They've attacked US democracy,
they've battled on the streets

5
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,840
of Britain, they're fighting back.

6
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,320
But what exactly are they fighting?

7
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,760
Or what?

8
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,360
You're inciting violence.

9
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,840
Is that good enough?

10
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm about to enter a world
where I as the mainstream media am

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,800
the enemy and where the people
I meet believe I'm an agent

12
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,200
of dark forces who run
the world and abuse children.

13
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,280
You're liars, you're liars,
you're liars, you are.

14
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,440
My mission is to unmask the figures
taking conspiracy to the heart

15
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,640
of our political systems and to meet
the digital soldiers

16
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,640
fighting for a supposed
government insider called Q.

17
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,800
I'm in Elyria, Ohio,
on my way to meet two of Q's most

18
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,240
ardent followers who plan
to take their country back.

19
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:09,160
Welcome to the digital
soldier's house.

20
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,880
Dave Roberts and Amanda Quimper.

21
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,560
You're filming us for
your documentary too?

22
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,200
I'm filming you because
you're mainstream media.

23
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
I'm going to make sure I get you.

24
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,080
I do understand to
a degree, you know.

25
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,480
I think people don't really trust
the media these days.

26
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,120
And that's why we're reluctant
to talk to you guys sometimes.

27
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,000
How important is Q
to what you're doing?

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,480
I think he laid the groundwork.

29
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
He made the exposures.

30
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,640
He opened the eyes of the people.

31
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,800
Whoever Q is believes in God
and trying to fight so that God

32
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,320
does win in the end.

33
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,640
And all these paedophilias
and all these trafficking rings

34
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,120
and all this structure
in the government of all this

35
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,560
evilness, that's something that
the Cabal has worked for centuries

36
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,960
to keep us all asleep.

37
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,040
And they've done a very
successful job of it.

38
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,520
What is the Cabal?

39
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,600
How would you describe it?

40
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,800
The Cabal in my opinion
is the organised elitist,

41
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:18,640
the 1% of the 1%, which includes
the Vatican and the monarchies.

42
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,480
People today are just now
beginning to wake up.

43
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,440
I mean they're just now beginning
to realise something's wrong

44
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,640
and Q instigated that.

45
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,000
We would never be anywhere
near where we are today

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,080
if it wasn't for Q.

47
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,440
So, some of what I'm about to tell
you may be hard to believe,

48
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,600
but it's changed the course
of politics around the world.

49
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,880
In October 2017 a figure called
Q Clearance Patriot appeared

50
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,720
on the website 4chan.

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,840
They claimed to be
a government insider.

52
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,600
Q started spreading wild
conspiracies, satanic

53
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,120
paedophiles ruled the world,
Trump was the saviour

54
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,360
against an evil Cabal
and people believed it.

55
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,720
With every share it
became more mainstream.

56
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,360
It soon became the
conspiracy of everything.

57
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,040
Over the next four years it spread
to millions across the globe.

58
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,200
Followers shared, kidnapped,
killed, shared some more

59
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,800
and attacked the US capital,
all in the name of Q.

60
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,960
But then, none of it came true.

61
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,160
The Cabal was never exposed,
Trump lost the 2020 election and Q

62
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,240
stopped posting forever
on December 8th 2020.

63
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,640
Millions of manipulated
and radicalised people

64
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,480
around the world were left
without a leader.

65
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:46,760
So, who's filling that void now?

66
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,920
Hello?

67
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,320
Hey, is that Pastor Mark?

68
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,440
Who's speaking?

69
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,280
It's Benjamin Zand.

70
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,920
Oh, yeah, yes, how are you doing?

71
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,280
I'm good, how are you?

72
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,880
Q's followers are still meeting up
at events across the US,

73
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:06,400
with or without Trump in the White
House.

74
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,320
Mainstream journalists are usually
banned and even forcibly

75
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,720
removed from these events,
but I've managed to get in.

76
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,080
I'll text you the 17th and 18th
and I'll make sure you get some

77
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,480
credentials so you got to come out
for that, OK?

78
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,120
Pastor Mark Burns was a speaker
at an event in California

79
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,480
and he was keen for me
to cover his upcoming

80
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,840
political campaign.

81
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,160
Hello.

82
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,280
Right, so we've actually
made it in officially.

83
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,760
How are y'all doing?

84
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,000
Good sir, how are you?

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,200
Good, thank y'all so much.

86
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,400
Hey, sir, how are you?

87
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,000
God bless you.

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,040
Blesses to you ma'am.

89
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,320
Thank you so much.

90
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,360
I love that.

91
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,480
God bless y'all.

92
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,680
Hello, how are you doing?

93
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,440
Hello, how are y'all doing?

94
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,200
Don't rely on the FBI.

95
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,600
Don't rely on the FBI, they're
the ones involved in January 6th.

96
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,440
God bless y'all.

97
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,360
This was a real who's who in
the world of alternate truths.

98
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,000
Figures like discredited
anti-vaccine doctor Andrew Wakefield

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,040
were in attendance.

100
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,000
You're never going to have another
fair election if we don't expose

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,320
and fight what happened in 2020.

102
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,160
Roger Stone.

103
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,480
I got to figure out
what I'm going to say.

104
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,200
I'm about to walk around here, man.

105
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
All right.

106
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,240
Love you, man.

107
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,360
All right, thanks.

108
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,000
You must fight.

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,640
Thousands of people had made
the trip to see their heroes

110
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,760
and to uncover the next secret
the mainstream media

111
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,960
didn't want them to know.

112
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,040
And how did you find
yourself in the world of Q,

113
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,800
selling Q tops, you know that is...

114
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,120
Well, I got into Q
through my family, my dad

115
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,560
and my brother followed Q.

116
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,880
But my brother is into a lot
of spirituality stuff,

117
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,680
you know, and so is Q.

118
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,520
There was a real sense
of community here.

119
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,880
Amidst the claims of a Cabal,
a planned pandemic and Trump

120
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,720
being the true president,
there was a home for people to be

121
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,360
heard and to be their real selves.

122
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,880
There was also a real
feeling of anger.

123
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,040
This is full blown world war
that we are in right this very

124
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,960
moment, ladies and gentlemen.

125
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,040
This is America.

126
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,240
This is an American thing.

127
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,600
So, fight with me.

128
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,240
We're in a time of warfare.

129
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,800
This is no longer a conspiracy
theory, it's a conspiracy.

130
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,600
One of the biggest names at these
events is this guy, Michael Flynn.

131
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,200
He's a former three star general
and was a national security

132
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,760
advisor for Donald Trump.

133
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,120
Q itself regularly defended Flynn,
so many followers see him

134
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,200
as a potential leader.

135
00:08:41,200 --> 00:09:00,000
We are going to take
this country back.

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,640
I'm driving to meet a man
called Dustin Nemos.

137
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,480
Dustin is like one of the earliest
adopters of Q, he's quite

138
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,240
a big name in the Qverse.

139
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:16,520
He even literally
wrote the book on Q.

140
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Hello.

141
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,440
Are we thinking here?

142
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,800
I was just looking around,
I don't know what works

143
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,240
for you guys, this is beautiful.

144
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,680
Oh, yeah, that's
interesting, isn't it?

145
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,600
Disciples like Dustin
made their money and fame

146
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,880
interpreting the religion of Q.

147
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,440
But Q's disappearance
created a power vacuum.

148
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,600
So, what happens now?

149
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,680
Are you still a follower of Q?

150
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,200
You know, half the world
is following it, so.

151
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,640
Forbes had it quoted,
and this is an old number,

152
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,240
that over 56% of the Republican
party had in some level

153
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,640
agreement with Q.

154
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,280
Do you believe in the idea
that there is a satanic

155
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,320
cabal raping kids?

156
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,480
I think that there are
powerful people who openly

157
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,560
identify with satanism.

158
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,400
I don't think that they get together
in the White House every

159
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:08,320
Tuesday and like order,
you know, $20,000 worth of pizza

160
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,200
to -be flown in at 2
- AM,

161
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,040
wait Obama did that.

162
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,560
But, you know, most of the time
they don't do that.

163
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
When Dustin mentions pizza here,
he actually means children.

164
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,360
It's a well known code word
from the debunked pizza gate

165
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,480
conspiracy of 2016 that alleged top
democrats were paedophiles.

166
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,120
I believe Obama is a child molester.

167
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,360
You think he abuses kids?

168
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,600
I believe that he does.

169
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,480
I don't believe those
are even his kids.

170
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,360
I mean his wife is not a woman.

171
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,840
You think his wife's a man?

172
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,760
Anybody got any shots
of Michelle Obama pregnant?

173
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,040
I'd love to see it.

174
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,600
You also believe that she's
a man and that his kids.

175
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,280
It's not about belief, I do fact.

176
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,680
The reality of the world is much
different than you've

177
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,880
been told on fake news.

178
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,080
You think the reality
of the world is that

179
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,680
Michelle Obama has a penis and,
and Barack Obama is abusing

180
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,880
kids in the White House?

181
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,960
That is more believable than
Joe Biden won the 2020 election.

182
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,240
You find it not odd that we don't
have shots of the First Family?

183
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,160
I do believe that based
on multiple videos.

184
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,280
But you need like evidence
that's kind of substantive

185
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,320
beyond the video.

186
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,760
I believe that we can
make a very good case,

187
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,360
including people who are biological
experts who can weigh the Adam's

188
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,960
apple, measure the shoulders
and all of that, that Michelle Obama

189
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
is a man.

190
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,080
A transgender woman.

191
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,920
His wife is better hung
than I am and I've seen it

192
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,960
on YouTube, multiple videos.

193
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,800
Because that's definitely
on the wilder side.

194
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,640
I'll ask one final question -
the future of Q is now

195
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,680
the influencers like yourself?

196
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,360
We're going to take
the country back.

197
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,920
We're getting people
elected into office.

198
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,480
The fake news, or forgive me,
the media are, you know,

199
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
they're already writing a lot
of articles about that,

200
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,520
nervous about the QAnon
people running for office.

201
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,240
Many of them are barely connected.

202
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,440
I can't wait till I run
for Congress, because they're

203
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,360
really going to lambast me.

204
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,800
Are you going to run?
Probably.

205
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Yeah, probably.

206
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,520
When do you think that will be?

207
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,760
Next couple of months maybe.

208
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,360
Oh, right, for the
mid-terms next year?

209
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,440
Yeah, 2022.

210
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,760
Dustin's views about Michelle Obama
are completely ridiculous

211
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,360
and untrue, but it's a clear example
of how in the world of Q, it's

212
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
more important to pick
a side than to see truth.

213
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,360
The question I had, though,
was whether Dustin could really make

214
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,840
it in the world of politics.

215
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,720
Another alleged Q supporter,
Marjorie Taylor-Greene, had done

216
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,840
exactly that in 2020.

217
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,360
America's the greatest
country in the world.

218
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,760
She was elected to Congress
in Georgia and is one

219
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,600
of conservative America's
most prominent figures.

220
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,560
Q is a patriot, we know that for
sure, but we do not know who Q is.

221
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,400
She's since distanced herself
from the Q movement.

222
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,000
But all this made me think
of someone I had seen

223
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,960
in California with Pastor Mark.

224
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,480
I saw your parents out there.

225
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,560
I knew that you were close.

226
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,440
That right there is Roger Stone,
one of the most important political

227
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,440
figures in the US over
the last 30 years.

228
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,040
This is a guy who helped get
presidents from Richard Nixon

229
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,840
to Donald Trump in office.

230
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,360
He's often called the Kingmaker
of Republican presidents.

231
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,560
Here he is with Donald Trump,
who pardoned him in 2020 after Stone

232
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,600
was convicted of obstructing
an investigation that would have

233
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,520
harmed the president.

234
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,840
And now, here he was at
a conference attended

235
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,800
by thousands of Q supporters.

236
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,040
Was this a clear sign of the next
stage of the Q movement,

237
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,280
cementing itself at the top
of global politics?

238
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,560
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am living proof that

239
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:22,760
God can do anything.

240
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Yes, ma'am?

241
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,240
We need a leader right now.

242
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,640
It should be Michael Flynn.

243
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,240
Some of you will have an opportunity
to see General Flynn

244
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,440
when he comes to speak.

245
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,720
You should tell him exactly
what Caroline said.

246
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,560
I think he is a man of destiny,
I think he is a man of courage.

247
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,920
So, I do think that he is
potentially the leader

248
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,560
for this movement.

249
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,720
Pastor Mark.

250
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,280
How are you doing?

251
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,160
To try and find out just
what Roger's plan is, I asked

252
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,560
Pastor Mark to arrange an interview.

253
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,720
It is the one and only Roger Stone.

254
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,800
Oh, man.

255
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,360
Hey, you're losing weight.

256
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,600
Listen, it's the dream
team right here, right?

257
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,880
Good to see you, Roger,
good to see you brother.

258
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
You're looking good.

259
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,400
Wow, to God be to glory.

260
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,280
We're just going to go and do
an interview with Roger Stone

261
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,120
and right next door to us,
where we've parked, there are two

262
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,680
cars with QAnon memorabilia.

263
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,360
This is the unconditional pardon
given to me by President Trump

264
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,840
when he concluded that I did not get
a fair trial and I was indicted

265
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,320
on politically motivated charges.

266
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,400
Look at this.

267
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,760
Is this the Avengers you're trying
to fight for America?

268
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
You've sorted out...

269
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,880
Captain America.

270
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,200
This is where I rip open my shirt.

271
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,560
I'd like to see your initial
reaction to the question

272
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,240
of what are your feelings on QAnon?

273
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,400
I guess what I would say
is I don't know if it's real,

274
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,760
but I sure hope it is.

275
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,680
If that person wakes up and starts
watching alternative media and isn't

276
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,320
getting all their news from CNN,
if that person gets registered

277
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,240
and votes, then I think we've
accomplished something.

278
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,120
I'm pretty sure that there's some
truth to some of those things.

279
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:12,400
Donald Trump should
have won the election.

280
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,280
I believe wihout question,
there was some form

281
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,560
of tampering that took place.

282
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,120
You could argue that the Q
movement is actually

283
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,440
so beneficial to people
like yourself, you know,

284
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,720
it's a movement that says
Donald Trump is the saviour,

285
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,080
it's a movement that says
Michael Flynn is a messiah.

286
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,840
Here's what I know.

287
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,080
I love the First Amendment.

288
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,720
I love people's right to say
whatever they think is true

289
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,120
and try to defend their position.

290
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,200
Yeah.

291
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,440
We do have a historical record here.

292
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,840
We were told Saddam Hussein had
weapons of mass destruction,

293
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,040
but that was a lie.

294
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,960
So, let's not pretend that
everything the government

295
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,200
tells us is true.

296
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Frankly, we've got to clean house
in the Republican party.

297
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,840
Trump has taken us from being
the party of the country

298
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,760
club to being the party
of working people.

299
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,400
If Trump doesn't run again,
I noticed that Michael Flynn attends

300
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,240
a lot of these events,
do you think he is a potential

301
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,280
candidate for president?

302
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,960
I want to make it very clear,
I'm for Donald Trump.

303
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,160
So, in the event that he does not
run, I would certainly look

304
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,200
to General Flynn as one
who might be drafted.

305
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,240
That's all.

306
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,160
All right, gentlemen,
good to see you all.

307
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,360
Can we just get some
verbal consent from you?

308
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,240
Yes, you can use all that stuff,
even though you're obsessed with Q.

309
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,120
LAUGHTER.

310
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,240
These guys are kind of the who's
who events like this that

311
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,560
are attended by a huge amount
of QAnon supporters.

312
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,600
Roger Stone is a bit
of a hero in these circles.

313
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,520
They're all very good
friends with Michael Flynn.

314
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
The FBI has labelled
Q and its supporters

315
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,920
a domestic terror threat,
but here was Roger Stone seemingly

316
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,040
embracing the movement
and using it for political gain.

317
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,640
The more I looked, the more I found
political candidates were making

318
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,520
the assessment that if they wanted
to win a seat, Q's conspiracy

319
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,680
and misinformation
were the way to do it.

320
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,560
I stand with President Trump,
I stand with Q and the team.

321
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:11,360
Everything that I've heard of Q,
I hope that this is real.

322
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,040
Reporting suggests almost 50
Congressional candidates have

323
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,240
embraced Q in their bids
for election in 2022.

324
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,800
And that doesn't include
those running for Senate.

325
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,440
One thing these candidates have
in common is that the vast

326
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,600
majority are Republicans,
they're deeply religious

327
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:30,880
and deeply conservative.

328
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,640
Most are scared of
the mainstream media,

329
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,800
but I've found one who was eager
for me to join their campaign.

330
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,960
My name is Kimberley Lowe.

331
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,080
I'm running for Congress
in the Fifth Congressional District,

332
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,160
which is right here.

333
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,600
We are at war right now.

334
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,280
We have had a planned pandemic
to destroy this country,

335
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,480
to destroy our businesses,
to pull us out of church,

336
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,200
to depopulate and to steal
an American election.

337
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,320
Please support me.

338
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Thank you, guys.

339
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,880
APPLAUSE.

340
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,080
Kimberley's kids don't go
to mainstream school, as she's

341
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,960
worried they'll be indoctrinated.

342
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,680
She also questions whether Covid's
real and inevitably, the topic

343
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,560
of the coronavirus vaccine
came up between us.

344
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,520
I've had two vaccines.

345
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,600
Oh, really?

346
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,240
I'm so sorry!

347
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,640
Do things stick to you
like you see on TV?

348
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
What, like magnets?

349
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,720
Have you tried that?

350
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,080
Shall we try it?

351
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,880
It has to go to your forehead.

352
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,960
Is it sticking?

353
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,080
I don't think so.

354
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,920
I think you're good.

355
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,960
I think you're OK.

356
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,360
So, what does that change
your opinion in any way?

357
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
No, not at all.

358
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,440
Why?

359
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,920
I would never get that vaccine.

360
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,080
It all comes down
to trust, doesn't it?

361
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,960
It comes down to trust in higher
bodies and I think ultimately,

362
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,080
the issue is that you don't
trust the government.

363
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,000
Correct.

364
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,160
In her run for Congress,
Kimberley believes she has

365
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:13,120
a helping hand from Q itself.

366
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,520
One day, I got a phone call from a Q
follower types of individuals,

367
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,360
and they told me that I needed
to stay on the path I'm on and that

368
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,760
I was being protected
and I just had to continue

369
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,640
on because I was going to be part
of whatever, you know,

370
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,040
future was to come here in America
regarding politics, etc.

371
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Trump wanted to stop
this trafficking.

372
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,640
He had an entire anti-trafficking
team that he put in the White House.

373
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,200
They're pulling people
and children out of tunnels.

374
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,640
I know one woman who was trafficked
who grew up in a tunnel system

375
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,200
somewhere in the Midwest.

376
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,520
She says that there's tunnels.

377
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,320
Has she provided proof?

378
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,480
I haven't asked for it.

379
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,280
Yeah, so I mean, how do I know?

380
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,400
How do I know?

381
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,080
Is there anything that
could disprove that for you?

382
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,320
Probably not!

383
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,120
Believing in these,
what some people would call,

384
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,240
conspiracies or alternative truths,
you know, it does have

385
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,160
actual consequences.

386
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,320
If you are saying those things
without adequate evidence,

387
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,480
there is a responsibility on you.

388
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,280
What is dangerous is media
dividing a country.

389
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
The election was stolen.

390
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,560
I fully believe that.

391
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,480
I just can't roll stuff
off my mouth and...

392
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,840
But just because you believe it,
doesn't make it true.

393
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,480
But it doesn't make me dangerous.

394
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,840
But the truth is, no matter how hard
it was for Kimberley to accept

395
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,680
the conspiracies of Q are pushing
people further and further

396
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,480
to the edge, some far enough
they're willing to kill.

397
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,600
Sheriff's deputies say 33-year-old
Neely Petrie Blanchard shot and

398
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:57,320
killed Christopher Hallet on Sunday.

399
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,120
Q's followers are told
that an elitist cabal

400
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,040
are raping children,
rigging elections and

401
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,440
depopulating the earth.

402
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,280
And when you believe all that,
just how far are you willing

403
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,440
to go to save the world?

404
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,280
Sheriff's deputies say 33-year-old
Neely Petrie Blanchard shot

405
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,560
and killed Christopher Hallett
on Sunday.

406
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,880
Since the rise of Q,
around 100 people have

407
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,760
committed crimes in its name,
ranging from kidnapping

408
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,800
to weapon offences to murder.

409
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,520
Are you in a pretty
nice neighbourhood?

410
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,400
Yeah.

411
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,640
Well, then, maybe you're here.

412
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
Hi.

413
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,120
Hello, is this the right house?

414
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,840
Yes.

415
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,000
This is the right house.

416
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,160
Amazing.

417
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,520
Get back, Rosie, and you're
dirty on top of it.

418
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
You need a bath.

419
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,680
She is a cute dog.

420
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,520
Straight up, hold.

421
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,400
Neely Petrie Blanchard was a normal
mother from Kentucky until she lost

422
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,560
custody of her daughter Mackenzie.

423
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,000
From that moment on,
she fell down the rabbit hole.

424
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,720
Ever since she lost Mackenzie,
she has struggled.

425
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,800
She was on the computer all day long
looking at this stuff.

426
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,600
It was every day she thought QAnon
was President Trump.

427
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,200
She spent hours a day trying
to figure out who Q actually was.

428
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,920
Was Q then this way
to get her kid back?

429
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,800
Was that was it was?

430
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,160
Was that like her main focus
and how she fell into this.

431
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,520
Main focus.

432
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,560
They were all involved
in Satanic worshipping.

433
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,520
Yeah, she believed there
was this city under

434
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,480
New York City that kept kids.

435
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,680
Through the community of Q, Neely
discovered Christopher Hallett.

436
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,480
He claimed to be a legal
expert who knew Trump

437
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,160
personally and promised
to reunite her with her child.

438
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:56,200
For a time, Neely thought Hallett
may even have been Q.

439
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,800
People have been persecuted
in family courts all over this

440
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:07,120
nation for a very long time.

441
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,080
Sleepers everywhere.

442
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,280
Think coats.

443
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,200
Wheels in Motion.

444
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,240
Q.

445
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,160
I mean, does that make sense to you?

446
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,320
Like, it doesn't make sense to me.

447
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,760
It looks like they haven't posted
on here since December 8th of 2020.

448
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,240
So, I guess, I don't
know if they've changed

449
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,840
the website or where they're,
you know, posting their stuff now.

450
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,680
Q has not posted since December 8th.

451
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,440
Really?

452
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,800
He just disappeared?

453
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,280
It's just disappeared.

454
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,640
It...?

455
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,680
Yeah.

456
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,720
Wow.

457
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,960
That's a shock to me.

458
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,600
That's kind of, I don't know
how I feel about that.

459
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,960
Kind of like it was all
for nothing I guess.

460
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,320
Wow.

461
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,520
Sorry.

462
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,440
She put so much and dedicated
so much of her time

463
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,520
to this for so long.

464
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,200
Would it have been easier
if the whole conspiracy was real,

465
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,720
because then at least Neely
would have done it for something?

466
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,800
Yeah... Yeah.

467
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,080
Absolutely.

468
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,480
You know, she fully believed
that she was doing it

469
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,280
to protect all these children and...

470
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,280
But there wasn't really
anything that we could do.

471
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,000
How do you help someone
that is so far in it?

472
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,920
I mean, I think that's our biggest
regret, was feeling like we kind

473
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,360
of pushed her away and did that
push her more into Q and these

474
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,480
conspiracies, because she didn't
have anybody else?

475
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,440
Double dap.

476
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,760
Double, double, dis.

477
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,400
The story ended when the onslaught
of conspiracies made Neely paranoid.

478
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,840
She stopped trusting
Christopher Hallett.

479
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,040
She became convinced
he was plotting against her,

480
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,520
so she shot him dead.

481
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,480
33-year-old Neely Petrie
Blanchard shot and killed

482
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,040
Christopher Hallett on Sunday.

483
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,680
Blanchard is awaiting extradition
back to Marion County.

484
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,280
Neely's now awaiting trial and can
only talk to her family

485
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,880
from Marion County Jail in Florida.

486
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,120
Hey...

487
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,200
Hey, let me turn the volume up.

488
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,800
I love you girls.

489
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,480
Mommy misses you.

490
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,800
Miss you too.

491
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,040
Guess what, Mom?

492
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,160
We fed the bunnies,
we gave them a salad

493
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,680
and they loved them.

494
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,760
Oh, I love your bunnies.

495
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,080
Oh, yeah, y'all sing that.

496
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,040
# We are the fireflies,
we like to fly around, blink, blink.

497
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,400
# With our yellow bandanas
we blink, blink on by.

498
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,720
Isn't that so cute?

499
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,480
I love you.

500
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,840
Bye.

501
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,040
Can you do the other half?

502
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,760
Huggies.

503
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,200
So, how do you feel
after talking to your mama?

504
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,600
What do you feel like?

505
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,680
Weird.

506
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,920
Why do you feel weird?

507
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,280
Because it's like we're
talking to her on a phone,

508
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,320
not like in person.

509
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,920
What do you know
about why she's there?

510
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,000
Because, I know...

511
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,880
Oh, you know why.

512
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,640
She made a bad choice didn't she?

513
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,840
We can't let our emotions
get out of hand.

514
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,200
Did you ever think it could get
to this point that she would be

515
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,960
in prison off the back
of shooting a man?

516
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,240
Never in a million years would
we have imagined that we would be

517
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,280
in a situation, you know.

518
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,400
Don't cry.

519
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,840
Yeah, then it all hits.

520
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,720
The girls, you know, I wonder how
it's going to affect their lives.

521
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:47,800
It worries me now they all could
possibly lose a mother forever.

522
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:53,400
To this day Neely still believes Q
and Donald Trump will save her.

523
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,720
Her story makes me wonder just how
much trauma plays a part in people's

524
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,320
descent down the rabbit hole.

525
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,480
After losing her children
and struggling with her life,

526
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,880
Q and conspiracy offered
Neely comfort.

527
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,600
It gave her a way out.

528
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,120
All right, we're convening this
meeting, it's July 1st 2021.

529
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,640
I feared for Amanda and Dave,
the two hardened Q

530
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,920
followers I'd met earlier.

531
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,640
They seem like good people.

532
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,960
They were convinced that they had
to defeat the evil of the world.

533
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,040
Photo before the storm.

534
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,400
But at what cost?

535
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,640
How have your family
reacted to the Q?

536
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,960
My kids don't want to, you know,
they don't want to talk to me,

537
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,080
they don't call me.

538
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,680
We're not close because of their
feelings and what their beliefs

539
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,000
are and they don't
want to hear this.

540
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,960
When I started speaking out
about all this stuff my,

541
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:50,520
you know, my family all just
were like what the heck.

542
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,880
Because I just was like I wasn't
going to hold anything back and, so.

543
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,400
It just came out of nowhere for them
and I just, you know,

544
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,520
threw up all over them pretty much.

545
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,440
That's normal.

546
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,920
What's it like to not be believed?

547
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,760
It is what it is and, you know,
after God comes to you in a dream

548
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,400
and tells you all this crap
is going on and then

549
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,120
you're kind of like oh,
this crap is going on, so.

550
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,200
So, there's nothing that could kind
of prove it wrong in your mind?

551
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,920
No, no.

552
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,240
Because I've seen the evil.

553
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,600
There's a coming, OK,
there's a reckoning and this reign

554
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:36,200
of evil is over with and we're
moving into a new era of time.

555
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,000
No one I had met was willing
to consider they could be wrong.

556
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,800
It was all just too important.

557
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:50,440
For Amanda, this was
a calling from God.

558
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,040
To show me what made her first
venture down the rabbit hole, Amanda

559
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,640
asked me to meet her at the place
it all began.

560
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:06,600
Her work.

561
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,560
Can I see the shot real quick?

562
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,120
Of course you can, hold on.

563
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:21,400
You seem to be very sensitive
about your appearance.

564
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,760
Probably because society programmes
you to believe that you need

565
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:32,520
to be pretty to be loved.

566
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,000
Where are we and what do you do?

567
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,320
We are at an exotic dance club.

568
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,080
This is not what you want your
kid to grow up and do.

569
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,920
A lot of girls come here lost
and broken and they need help

570
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:57,360
and they're hurting and then
they're not here any more.

571
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,640
How did you find yourself here?

572
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,480
When I was 18 in high school,
what I wanted to do

573
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:13,880
was become an actress.

574
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,200
So, I put myself through two years
of college, I come home I live

575
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,880
in the heart of the heroin epidemic.

576
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,760
All my friends were on heroin,
my best friend is no longer

577
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,920
with us because she died.

578
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,920
She used to work here.

579
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:32,680
Sorry to hear that.

580
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,200
I've only known you for a matter
of days, but it feels like,

581
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,480
you know, you genuinely really
want to do some good in the world,

582
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,920
but you're not sure how
is best to do that.

583
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,280
I just, I want to help
the lost and broken.

584
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,960
How do you do that?

585
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,000
I've been guided to be in this club.

586
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,160
I had a girl that
worked with me here.

587
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,480
I remember crying out to God, like,
I'm so tired of this.

588
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,000
I just want out.

589
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,280
I'm done.

590
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,480
I'm done, God, I'm done.

591
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:25,680
But everything inside of me
was like, you still need to be here.

592
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:32,120
It sounds kind of lonely.

593
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,000
Yeah, it can be a very lonely walk
and no-one understands it

594
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,760
because they're not
walking in your shoes.

595
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,200
Amanda's story just makes me feel
a bit sad, to be honest.

596
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:54,200
It's clear why Q is so important
and why it's so hard to let go.

597
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,520
It makes her life worthwhile
and I think it also shows why

598
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,960
she's never going to not
drink the Kool-Aid.

599
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,760
But it's also scary
because when you believe something

600
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,800
so ardently and you're willing
to literally die for that cause,

601
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:16,720
what is the end goal?

602
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,960
We want Trump! We want Trump!

603
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,880
I wonder what I will be
proved right about next.

604
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,760
Perhaps it will be the election?

605
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,280
We will never, ever surrender.

606
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,440
All over the world, an online
conspiracy movement that started

607
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,480
in the US was finding its way
to the top of politics.

608
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,640
Lies of a cabal and fake claims
of rigged elections were being used

609
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,760
in order to win votes.

610
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,600
In the weird world of Q,
Donald Trump was the saviour.

611
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,000
But as Q disappeared
from public view and Trump

612
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,880
failed to win reelection,
new leaders had stepped

613
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,240
into the frame.

614
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,760
They're feeding these murderers.

615
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,080
Michael Flynn, along
with Mike Lindell, was at the top

616
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,680
of the conspiracy tree.

617
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,800
We will get through this and get
back to a place that's stronger

618
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
and safer than ever.

619
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,080
Flynn is a powerful figure.

620
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,720
He's a close confidant of Trump
and reached the very top of the US

621
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,080
military as a three-star general.

622
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,400
He made headlines after he filmed
himself doing a pledge

623
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,080
associated with QAnon.

624
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,600
I, Michael Flynn.

625
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,520
Do solemnly swear. Do solemnly swear.

626
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,840
Where we go one, we go all. Where we go one, we go all.

627
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,040
God bless America.

628
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,600
Flynn and his family say this has
nothing to do with Q and that it's

629
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,760
simply a family statement of support
to one another.

630
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,840
But he's a superstar
amongst Q supporters.

631
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,760
Where does Michael Flynn
kind of fit into it all?

632
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,800
Michael Flynn, yeah.

633
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,160
I think he's definitely one
of the biggest names.

634
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,600
I mean, I think that he has
something to do with it.

635
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,320
I definitely think it's a military
operation, a positive one.

636
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,520
It's just about spreading truth
and exposing the corruption.

637
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,120
When they find out a crime
was committed, ie election fraud,

638
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,480
you put the winner back in.

639
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,760
Mike Lindell is the owner
of a billion-dollar pillow

640
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,560
brand called My Pillow.

641
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,960
Mike Lindell and My Pillow,
boy, do you sell those

642
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,760
pillows, it's unbelievable.

643
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,960
He also denies any connection to Q.

644
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,520
But he's become a hero to Q
supporters for peddling conspiracies

645
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,000
that the US election
was rigged against Trump.

646
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,640
Michael Flynn's name had continually
popped up as a potential leader

647
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,720
of this movement and even
a future president.

648
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,880
But how did he feel about his
alleged associations to Q and would

649
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,280
he defend the conspiracies?

650
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,840
Both of the Mikes hate
the mainstream media and pretty much

651
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,000
never do interviews.

652
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But once again, through the help of
Pastor Mark Burns, I'd made it in.

653
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,680
Today is quite a big day.

654
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,280
I've finally got an interview
with Michael Flynn.

655
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,200
I've been trying
to do this for weeks.

656
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,520
There have been a lot
of false starts.

657
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,720
I didn't think it was going
to happen, to be honest, and then

658
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,680
all of a sudden, I was told that
if I come to Los Angeles, I would be

659
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,920
able to have some time with him.

660
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,480
It's going to be quite a challenge,
but it's an important

661
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,240
day in the world of Q.

662
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,360
For me, at least.

663
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,320
All right.

664
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,960
Do you want me to sit here?

665
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,240
Yeah, so the general's here now.

666
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,320
I'm looking at him.

667
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,360
That's right.

668
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,520
I was finally in the room with two
of the most powerful men

669
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,960
in the world of alternate truth.

670
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,280
And what's the bit about,
I suppose around the 8th

671
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,400
of January and then.

672
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,040
Yeah.
I was thrown off of Twitter.

673
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,080
Yeah, yeah.

674
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,480
About around the 8th, 9th, yeah.

675
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,440
Are you guys ready to rock and roll?

676
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,480
Yeah, let's do it.

677
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,840
Do you think realistically
in the next few months Trump

678
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,960
might be reinstated?

679
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,280
There's no more conspiracy theory
about election fraud, 3rd November

680
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,560
2020 and the presidential election.

681
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,640
It's no more a theory.
It is a conspiracy.

682
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,400
Would I like to see a reinstatement?

683
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,240
You're damn right I'd like to see
a reinstatement of President Trump.

684
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,600
Mike, am I right in thinking
that by August, Trump

685
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,880
might be back in office?

686
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,480
Yeah, we're off by a little bit,
it could be September.

687
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,080
It's worth remembering that there's
zero evidence to support the theory

688
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,760
the election was stolen.

689
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,000
America's Attorney-General threw out
60 cases and in September 2021

690
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,040
the audit in Arizona that they're
referencing confirmed that

691
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,360
Joe Biden won the election.

692
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,800
Why do you think there's such
a disparity, I suppose,

693
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,880
in thinking in the States
at the moment?

694
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,040
You know, some people
would say there hasn't been

695
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,640
evidence of election fraud,
a lot of these cases are thrown out.

696
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,520
Donald Trump won 80
million to 68 million.

697
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,600
This was massive.

698
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,760
Every state it happened in.

699
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,760
The evidence is clear.

700
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,640
I mean, there's been
a ton of evidence.

701
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,240
All you've got to do is read it
and hopefully the media one of these

702
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,360
days will figure it out,
honest journalists will figure

703
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,640
it out and report it.

704
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,560
It's a crime that happened
against every citizen

705
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,960
of the United States of America.

706
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,000
Yep.

707
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,160
One thing that is kind of hard
to escape is the movement around

708
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,320
the kind of perimeters here.

709
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,400
QAnon, what's your opinion on Q?

710
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,680
What is it?

711
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,040
You know what it is at this point.

712
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,240
A group of people that
don't like paedophilia?

713
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,760
What's your, like, opinion on it?

714
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,200
Is it good?
Is it bad?

715
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,560
I think that paedophilia
is disgusting.

716
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,240
Is Q a domestic terror threat?

717
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,360
Is that your...?

718
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,560
Is that what it is?

719
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,840
I don't know. I don't know.

720
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,120
You've become quite a central figure
of it, a kind of messiah of that...

721
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,320
Really?
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

722
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
If you look outside,
some of the T-shirts.

723
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,080
What are you asking me about?
I mean get to the point.

724
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,200
That is the point.

725
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,320
Are you happy that you're
being associated with Q?

726
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,800
If there's somebody
against paedophilia, I'm with them.

727
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,480
If they're against
paedophilia, I mean, right?

728
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,880
So, is paedophilia good
or bad to you, right?

729
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,280
Now you, I know you won't
even, you won't even...

730
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,160
Yeah, I definitely don't think
paedophilia is good.

731
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,880
Yeah, see, you won't even play that.

732
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,320
Why would I not play that?

733
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,520
Because I know your organisation.

734
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,480
See, but this is thing,
it's like I...

735
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,760
You're asking a stupid question.

736
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,240
You wouldn't even ask that
if you were doing an interview.

737
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,480
You're here to interview us.

738
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,680
This is the big lie.

739
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,320
It doesn't matter who stands behind
us or who doesn't stand.

740
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,240
The evidence, the truth
shall set you free.

741
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,400
This will once again be
one nation under God.

742
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,240
I have no idea what QAnon
is and I really don't know.

743
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,720
You don't know what QAnon is?

744
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,760
Are you serious?

745
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,480
I have no idea.
I really don't.

746
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,600
Are you serious, you
don't know what it is?

747
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,480
You've both been asked
about it multiple times.

748
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,800
Why is it so offensive?

749
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,760
I'm just asking.

750
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,440
You get the privilege
of interviewing General

751
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,480
Flynn and Mike Lindell.

752
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,520
Wasted my time.

753
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,440
Well, why does it
need to be offensive?

754
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,880
Because that's what you all are.

755
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,560
It means a lot to them outside.

756
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,040
That's a joke, what you did.

757
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,080
OK.
Shame on you.

758
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,400
Shame on people like you that
have hurt our country.

759
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,880
I'm not sure that's the truth.

760
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,080
But thanks a lot for your time.

761
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,400
Hey, a quick question,
what company are you guys with?

762
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,480
Channel 4.

763
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
Channel 4, local?

764
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,920
No, no, it's in the UK.

765
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,120
Oh, UK, OK, got you.

766
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,160
All right.

767
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,600
Do you work with Michael Flynn?

768
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,640
No... No.

769
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,960
All right, OK.

770
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,160
I think Mark's in trouble now.

771
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,360
He's led us into the world of Q
and we asked the questions

772
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,880
we weren't meant to and now
everyone's freaking the hell out.

773
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
Hey, Mark.

774
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,960
Dude, it's bad.

775
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,040
I thought...

776
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,600
I want to put y'all in front of
people but you can't do that, man.

777
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
What, ask about Q?

778
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,720
Brother...

779
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,080
We asked you about Q
though and you were fine.

780
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
Yes, but you...

781
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,160
Really?

782
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,400
You can't do that, guys.

783
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,760
We asked you about it,
we asked Roger about it

784
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,200
and no one had an issue.

785
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,160
I didn't realise there
would be such a...

786
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,560
If there's anything that's
controversial, you may want to just

787
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,120
ask us about it and so that maybe it
would help to understand why some

788
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,560
people would be upset about that.

789
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,480
Because I can't bring
nobody else like I...

790
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
We're not filming.

791
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,560
He's got our microphone.

792
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,600
He's wearing our microphone.

793
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,640
This from Channel 4?

794
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,120
We are the Channel 4 dudes.

795
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,240
We need you to go out
that way, please.

796
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,280
Thank you.

797
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,200
We just need to get
our microphone back.

798
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,360
Do me a favour, guys,
who are you with?

799
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,400
Channel 4.

800
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,560
I'll go find it.
Give me just a second.

801
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,560
Yeah, yeah.

802
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,640
Bloody hell.

803
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,320
All right, we just got kicked out.

804
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,000
What an ungraceful ending, hey?

805
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,160
This is politics today, not just
in the States, but in the UK.

806
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,720
You know, you ask certain questions,
conversations just get shut down

807
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,920
and there's no meeting
in the middle.

808
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,960
They're probably surrounded
by so many yes men that they've lost

809
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,200
all semblance of the truth,
and that's what makes them

810
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,400
so dangerous, because ultimately
they're willing to undermine US

811
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,240
democracy, they're willing
to call on people to fight.

812
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,120
I've been having conversations this
whole time with people who feel

813
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,520
like Q is their life,
they're literally willing to die

814
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,120
for it and they're also willing
to die for the likes

815
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,600
of Michael Flynn and Mike Lindell.

816
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:51,400
Very sad.

817
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,640
Freedom, freedom, freedom!

818
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,000
Freedom, freedom, freedom!

819
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,800
The Q movement has spread around
the world and its digital soldiers

820
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,080
can be found right on our doorstep.

821
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,400
This is Satanic.

822
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,040
According to our own exclusive
polling in partnership with YouGov,

823
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,120
58% of Brits think that Satanic
ritual abuse of children probably

824
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,960
happens and 10% of the British
public believe the UK government

825
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,600
need to be overthrown by force.

826
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,920
Both of these beliefs have direct
links to the QAnon movement.

827
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,440
The worst-case scenario
is they're being sacrificed

828
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,120
to the Devil in Satanic rituals.

829
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,040
I think Trump's going to be
able to save us all.

830
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,680
I think because there's so much
corruption that's going to come

831
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,800
across to this country that's
come across from America

832
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,560
because we're part of it.

833
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,080
This is no conspiracy.

834
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,400
Most of them in there are evil
and underpinning it all has been

835
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,840
a trade for centuries
that is going on and it's

836
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,280
the trade of children.

837
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,000
Eight million children
go missing every year.

838
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,880
Where do they go?

839
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,120
In Nazi Germany,
it wasn't overnight.

840
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,440
They changed the Mental Health Act.

841
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,040
They passed all the same laws that
are being passed now.

842
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,520
At the Nuremberg trials,
the doctors and nurses stood

843
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,800
trial and they hung.

844
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,160
This is Kate Shemirani,
the pre-eminent figure in the world

845
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,400
of British conspiracy at the moment.

846
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,960
That was her suggesting NHS doctors
and nurses could be tried

847
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,640
and even hung for their part
in the UK's vaccination program.

848
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,440
Kate's a former nurse
who was struck off.

849
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,800
She uses the NHS and her
anti-vaccine beliefs as her rallying

850
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,640
cry and has given the conspiracies
of satanic abusers and the deep

851
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,720
state a uniquely British edge.

852
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,800
Hi, how are you?

853
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,680
Hey, Kate, how are you doing?

854
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,240
nice to meet you.

855
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,680
You too.

856
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,520
It's always good to get
the initial reactions.

857
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,000
Nice to meet you.

858
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,400
I hear you're a Scouser.

859
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,800
I am, yeah, I'm a Scouser indeed.

860
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,960
I'm just locking you in,
fellas, so you can't...

861
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,000
No, no, no.

862
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,480
Come into my garage,
food store, my bikes, my gym.

863
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,880
Right now, I'm looking
at what the government is doing,

864
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,240
and I don't want to be governed
by what I see are people that

865
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,360
are completely overstepping
the powers that have been bestowed

866
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,960
upon them by us, the people.

867
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:35,440
So, the right channels need to be
used to cease their power.

868
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,800
In real life, Kate was
friendly and hospitable,

869
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,920
a world away from the preacher
screaming about Satan

870
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:46,000
in Trafalgar Square.

871
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,640
But by alluding to NHS workers
being hung, she had taken

872
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,440
British conspiracy down
a dark, terrifying path.

873
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,320
At that rally in July
in Trafalgar Square, you seemed

874
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,480
to make a link that the NHS workers
of today should be hung

875
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,760
for their participation.

876
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,920
It's not for me to decide the law.

877
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,040
It's their own statute, I believe.

878
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,040
I didn't...

879
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,160
But you...

880
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,160
Hang on.

881
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,840
You can have an opinion on it.

882
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,480
No, you're not going to make me.

883
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,400
But it got a lot of media coverage.

884
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,520
Excellent.

885
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,640
It was pretty scary, you know,
even standing there.

886
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,680
Excellent.

887
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,320
It seemed to be, you said
at the Nuremberg trials those

888
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,360
doctors and nurses hung.

889
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,800
You don't like me
mentioning Nuremberg.

890
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,720
Why don't you want me
to mention Nuremberg?

891
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,000
Does it make you uncomfortable?

892
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,920
Because it's
unbelievably incendiary.

893
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,000
Yes, it is.

894
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,640
Oh, shit, does it make
you uncomfortable?

895
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,720
It's extremely incendiary.

896
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,920
Like to say that publicly in front
of tens of thousands of people.

897
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,840
OK, oh, it's incendiary?

898
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,960
It's incendiary.

899
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,360
The workers in the NHS
could potentially meet that fate.

900
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,360
It's incendiary. It's incendiary.

901
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,760
OK, well, let's talk about it.

902
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,840
It's incendiary.

903
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,560
This was in the last hundred years.

904
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,720
They facilitated the deaths
of disabled children and adults.

905
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,880
And you're saying that that's
happened today with Covid?

906
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,800
And they believed,
they believed at that time

907
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,960
that they were doing
the right thing.

908
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,600
And these kids are going
to tell the story...

909
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,240
Over the last 18 months,
Kate's been speaking up and down

910
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,600
the country in front of crowds
of thousands of people.

911
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,760
And it appears to be working.

912
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,480
From our research with YouGov,
65% of Brits believe the people

913
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,640
who have the most influence
and power in the UK are not our

914
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,840
elected politicians.

915
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,160
But has this support
and encouragement led her

916
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,400
to consider a move into politics?

917
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,680
Could you see yourself running
for a political party?

918
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,600
I have considered and
now opened that door.

919
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:30,200
It's not something that I've thought
about and dismissed.

920
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,720
This is my camerawoman as well.

921
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,680
She does all my filming
when we're out.

922
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,800
You've encouraged me to go
into politics, haven't you?

923
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,840
Yeah.

924
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,320
We were chatting with Kate
about whether she might run

925
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,960
for Prime Minister
one day, would you?

926
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,040
Fantastic idea.

927
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,200
Would you vote for her?

928
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,360
I would.

929
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,200
It's hard because everything
they say has like a pearl

930
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:59,360
of something that could be reality,
and they hook you on that point

931
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:06,160
and say "See, see, you know,
that is, do you get what I'm saying"

932
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,040
because of that tiny bit and that's
the wider argument I'm making.

933
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,680
It's like no, no, just
because that tiny bit is true,

934
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,840
they just extrapolate everything
and then they manipulate people

935
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,560
and they ask for money and they make
them go out and vote on the back

936
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,080
of these things that are lies.

937
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,280
The dark forces of conspiracy have
deeply embedded themselves

938
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,680
in our political systems,
and after going behind the veil,

939
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,360
it's clear that none of us are safe
from their lies and misinformation.

940
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,640
Conspiracies like Q give
people hope and purpose.

941
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,440
But the road from obscure conspiracy
to undermining democracy is one

942
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,600
paved with good intentions.

943
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:42,560
Conspiracy led to the biggest
assault ever on US democracy.

944
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,080
If left unchecked, where will it
lead the rest of us?
