178
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,916
Imo, Imo!

179
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,041
You must go alone now, Hano.

180
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,083
Never let them find you.

181
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,916
Go, go.

182
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
(dramatic music)

183
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:39,666
(dramatic music)

184
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:39,750
(singing in foreign language)

185
00:22:53,250 --> 00:23:04,250
(dramatic music)

186
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,625
(dramatic music)

187
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:24,750
(dramatic music)

188
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:39,416
(dramatic music)

189
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:50,041
(crowd chanting)

190
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:51,875
In Brigata.

191
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,666
(crowd chanting)

192
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:55,625
Emperor Caracol.

193
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:58,791
General Acasis.

194
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,750
I have taken Numidia in your names,

195
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,416
but your dominion may
eclipse that of every emperor

196
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,541
that came before you.

197
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,458
Crown him with laurels, brother.

198
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:17,333
(crowd cheering)

199
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,708
(crowd cheering)

200
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,333
In honor of your conquest,

201
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,375
there will be games in the Colosseum.

202
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:34,916
I require no games in my honor.

203
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,916
Serving the Senate and the people of Rome

204
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:40,916
is honor enough for me.

205
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,208
You are too modest, Acasis.

206
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,416
Does not suit a general
as accomplished as yourself.

207
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,125
Your glory is yours, not mine.

208
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,708
I only ask for some respite from war

209
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,041
to spend time with my wife.

210
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,666
Your wife, yes.

211
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,875
Remember the
privileges we have granted her?

212
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,958
Where is she now to
ignore such an occasion?

213
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,250
There are victories yet still to come.

214
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:10,458
Persia.

215
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:13,208
India.

216
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:17,666
Both must be conquered.

217
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,958
Rome has so many subjects.

218
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:24,166
She must feed them.

219
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:27,208
They can eat war.

220
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,583
(horn blaring)

221
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:33,708
Your triumphs will be celebrated

222
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:36,708
as a tribute to the
greatness of the Roman people.

223
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:50,458
(crowd cheering)

224
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:23,166
(intense music)

225
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:27,750
Macrinus of
Fisters, master of gladiators.

226
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,416
(crowd cheering)

227
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:50,250
(intense music)

228
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,500
No mistake votes.

229
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:57,750
(intense music)

230
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:06,458
(crowd cheering)

231
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:12,291
You go out of the town councilors.

232
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,750
Distinguished guests.

233
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:18,458
You gotta write a
pack, citizens of Antia.

234
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:28,208
Behold the fate of
the conquered enemies of Rome.

235
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:33,666
The barbarian, you
idiots, and their chief,

236
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:37,916
their new god, Lord.

237
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,875
(intense music)

238
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:53,583
(crowd cheering)

239
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:55,541

247
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:50,208
[screaming]

248
00:28:50,291 --> 00:29:00,000
Which one is interesting?

249
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:17,416
[screaming] [screaming]

250
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:27,791
I'll fire.

251
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:48,666
[screaming]

252
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,541
Hold.

253
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:51,833
Here goes there.

254
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:54,208
General.

255
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:30,125
[music playing]

256
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:31,333
My lady.

257
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:42,333
I thank the gods that
brought you back home safe.

258
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,500
Thank the army they protected me.

259
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:51,208
Let me feed you.

260
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:17,083
[screaming]

261
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:19,541
Go.

262
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:21,625
To the wall.

263
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,583
The arena is a sacred temple.

264
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:39,208
For the bravest of you, the
road to glory runs through the arena.

265
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:44,458
The arena turns slaves into
gladiators and gladiators into free men.

266
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,250
You have worms.

267
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,250
I know this one.

268
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:00,208
He eats monkeys.

269
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:12,791
[thunder]

270
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:16,208
Go. Sit. Eat.

271
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:45,666
[thunder]

272
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:56,791
[whimpering]

00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,750
[screaming]

274
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:13,750
[screaming]

275
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:17,833
You.

276
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,250
I know. Get up.

277
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:31,791
What is your native
language? I speak them all.

278
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:38,666
You don't answer because
you can't or because you won't.

279
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:42,416
All right.

280
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:46,250
Violence is the universal language.

281
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:49,041
Vigo, put him through his paces.

282
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,208
He can fight an ape.
Let's see if he can fight a man.

283
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,208
[sighing]

284
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:43,125
[laughing]

285
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:47,875
[laughing]

286
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:59,583
[grunting]

287
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:03,000
The arena!

288
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:09,291
Very good.

289
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:11,958
Very good.

290
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,916
Close him down.

291
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:22,875
Bring him to me.

292
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:28,708
Ah!

293
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,416
Strong jaw.

294
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:36,791
Good arms.

295
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:39,208
Better smell.

296
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,208
Ah, you would do well.

297
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,583
It is an art.

298
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:48,708
Choosing gladiators.

299
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,250
Some choose entertainers.

300
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:54,875
Some choose brute force.

301
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:56,291
I choose rage.

302
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:04,833
Crowd loves blood and they love
those who love blood as much as they do.

303
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:06,541
And you, my friend, rage,

304
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,625
pours out of you like...

305
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:12,208
like milk.

306
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,791
From a horse tit.

307
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,291
You will be quite the fighter.

308
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:19,666
Not for you.

309
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,541
You're right. You do not fight for me.

310
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:26,208
I put you in the ring. You
fight or you die. The choice is yours.

311
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:32,333
But whose head could I give
you that would satisfy this fury?

312
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:34,458
The entire Roman armies.

313
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,916
[laughing]

314
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:39,125
Too much.

315
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:42,708
The general will do.

316
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:44,375
General?

317
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,000
General Acacis?

318
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:56,500
Use your rage in my service, then
you will have his head ready for your sword.

319
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:00,666
Serve me and host serve you. Deny me.

320
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,916
And you will die.

321
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:08,208
At times I will wish you the best.

322
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,375
You should abandon me
rather than fight their wars.

323
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:12,791
I've made my choice.

324
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,041
I can live with it.

325
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:24,041
But my patience
with those two is at an end.

326
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:27,916
Letter.

327
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,958
You may go to your quarters now.

328
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,791
We need nothing more.

329
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:43,291
To hear wives and mothers
mourning their dead on that beach at Numidia.

330
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:47,041
Silla.

331
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:53,750
No more.

332
00:37:55,708 --> 00:38:02,000
I will not waste another
generation of young men for their vanity.

333
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:07,958
If I fight another
campaign, it must be to depose them.

334
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:11,750
When will your troops arrive?

335
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,916
We landed Austrian ten days.

336
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:18,666
How many of them
will be loyal to you alone?

337
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,250
All of them.

338
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,416
The empress do not
have the support of the people.

339
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:32,125
The people are weary of
the madness, of the tyranny.

340
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:37,333
What is the dream of Rome?

341
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,208
That people are not free.

342
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,083
Enjoy yourselves, everyone.

343
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,291
To excess.

344
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:08,166
Thank you.

345
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:18,250
Thank you.

346
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:21,041
Wow.

347
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:25,750
Please.

348
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:27,166

You won't be disappointed.

Rome has all the games
that men like you like to play.

We'll find out. It's only now.

about you being interested

362
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:17,791
in standing for
election to the Senate, Macalus?

363
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,541
Me? No. No, I'm not.

364
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:24,166
I don't even know how to use an abacus.

But I do understand that it's
customary for your guests to make wages.

A thousand gold denarii?

for your
entertainment, the art of combat.

Three rounds, hand to hand. Swords!

We want swords to fight to the death.

A captioned Roman officer.

I was posted guard over him, and
he used to tell us tales to pass the time.

And what became of this prison?

A gladiator can buy his own freedom.

His liberty.

The Roman dream.

443

The slave dreams not of
freedom, but of a slave to call his own.

Is that what you
were raised on, Maccrelas?

Five thousand soldiers loyal to me.

the Senate and their people.

Rome will be yours
to administer and to...

466

Marcus Aurelius talked of
restoring power to the Senate.

But that was a
generation ago. Much has changed.

to put up with me as I am.

484
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:58,250
The twins there, they were outcasts.

485
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:00,916
Left in the hills to die.

486
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,833
That wolf found them.
She suckled them on her milk.

Raised by an
animal that's in their blood.

I know the chaos they brought.

490
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:19,500
This city infects everything it touches.

491
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:22,083
I never dreamt it would be so big.

492

And honor Rome's legionary commander,

517
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:57,541
General Eustace Acacius.

518
00:53:57,916 --> 00:54:00,333
(cheering)

519
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:02,875
And with him, Lucilla,

520
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:06,541
the daughter of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

521
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:11,250
(cheering)

522
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:13,541
Acacius.

523
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:15,291
General.

524
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:24,750
(cheering)

525
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:33,750
Speak to them.

526
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:36,416
(cheering)

527
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:48,583
I am not an orator or a politician.

528
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:51,416
I am a soldier.

529
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:59,083
I've seen bravery in
men and women during war,

530
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:01,916
and even once in this arena.

531
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,625
So if you ask anything of the gods,

532
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,083
ask for that same bravery.

533
00:55:09,458 --> 00:55:11,750
(dramatic music)

534
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,625
Because Rome needs it now.

535
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:17,458
(cheering)

536
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:37,541
(cheering)

537
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,750
From the South Gate,

538
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:43,875
bakers from the
stable of Matronos of Vistrus.

539
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:56,583
(cheering)

540
00:55:57,208 --> 00:56:02,458
From the stables of
Emperors Calicalla and Gator themselves,

541
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:07,666
the undefeated
champion, Glissero the Destroyer.

542
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,458
(explosions)

543
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:16,791
(dramatic music)

544
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:17,041
Oh!

545
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:28,166
(cheering)

546
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:28,708
(explosions)

547
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:40,083
(cheering) (explosions)

548
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:40,958
Oh!

549
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:44,375
Help, Jesus!

550
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:47,125
(explosions)

551
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:51,958
(cheering)

552
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:03,750
Hold together and when
the charges break for the wall.

553
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:05,416
Why should I?

554
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:12,208
(explosions) Hold, hold!

555
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:15,625
Cows!

556
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:26,833
(explosions)

557
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:26,916
(cheering)

558
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:33,125
(explosions)

559
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:33,250
(yelling)

560
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:34,583
(explosions)

561
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:34,958
(groaning)

562
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:50,541
(explosions)

563
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:54,750
(yelling)

564
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:58,416
(yelling)

565
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:58,791
(explosions)

566
00:57:58,875 --> 00:57:59,541
(laughing)

567
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:04,750
(growling)

568
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,208
(cheering)

569
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:14,291
(explosion)

570
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:17,583
(growling)

571
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:57,916
(explosions)

572
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,208
(yelling)

573
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:02,166
(explosions)

574
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:15,291
(yelling) (yelling)

575
00:59:15,375 --> 00:59:18,000
(explosions)

576
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:27,500
(yelling)

577
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:30,750
Brother, is that poet, is it not?

578
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:33,166
I can't remember.

579
00:59:34,416 --> 00:59:35,291
That night was a blur.

580
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:40,000
The gates of hell are open night and day.

581
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,666
Smooth as I forget.

582
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:44,750
Smooth as the scent.

583
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,208
Smooth as the scent.

584
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:49,500
Easy as the way.

585
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:58,208
Kill!

586
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:00,625
(explosions)

587
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:16,708
(yelling)

588
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:19,333
(explosions)

589
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:23,583
(yelling)

590
01:00:23,666 --> 01:00:27,625
(yelling)

591
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,291
(yelling)

592
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:32,250
(explosions)

593
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:34,250
(yelling)

594
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,791
(yelling)

595
01:00:40,541 --> 01:00:40,750
Brother.

596
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:44,541
(yelling)

597
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,000
You sit.

598
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:47,416
Shall we show mercy?

599
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:48,750
Mercy.

600
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:53,583
(yelling)

601
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:57,750
(explosion)

602
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:05,583
No mercy!

603
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:08,875
Your life has been spared by the gods.

604
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:10,666
I will sooner face your blade

605
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:12,666
than accept Roman mercy.

606
01:01:18,416 --> 01:01:20,583
(yelling)

607
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:23,708
(explosion) (yelling)

608
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,250
Kill!

609
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:30,125
Kill!

610
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:31,083
Kill!

611
01:01:31,666 --> 01:01:31,875
Kill!

612
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:32,708
Kill!

613
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:33,583
Kill!

614
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:34,500
Kill!

615
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:35,291
Kill!

616
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:36,000
Kill!

617
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:43,375
(yelling)

618
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:47,583
(yelling)

619
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:53,041
(explosion)

620
01:02:04,083 --> 01:02:10,583
(yelling)

621
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:22,083
The road to freedom
doesn't run through the arena.

622
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:24,583
Leads to this.

623
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:30,583
Go to yourself.

624
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:38,500
(yelling)

625
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:46,791
(panting)

626
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:56,750
Now let's go.

627
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:10,708
(panting)

628
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:13,375
Gates of hell are open night and day.

629
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,916
Smooth as the descent.

630
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:18,083
Easiest away.

631
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,208
Dad, Dad.

632
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:28,583
And I bought you an
maximus, the single road.

633
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:47,958
(somber music)

634
01:03:48,666 --> 01:03:49,958
It's got to end our gentle.

635
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:53,916
(explosion)

636
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:04,000
(somber music)

637
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:05,333
Lucius is safe.

638
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:19,916
(somber music)

639
01:04:23,666 --> 01:04:23,708
Lucius.

640
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:27,083
(somber music)

641
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,250
(somber music)

642
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:36,833
(screaming)

643
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:37,708
Lucius.

644
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:41,666
You're the sole heir to the throne now.

645
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,541
There are men who want to
kill you so they can take power.

646
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:51,500
I promise I'll bring
you back as soon as I'm safe.

647
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:54,291
Mother, why can't you come with me?

648
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:57,916
I have to stay here for your sake.

649
01:04:58,916 --> 01:05:00,000
I'm here for the sake of room.

650
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:03,958
Remember who you are and that I love you.

651
01:05:05,291 --> 01:05:06,791
I love you.

652
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:08,375
Come.

653
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:12,625
Give me your leg.

654
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,541
Go, go.

655
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,208
(screaming)

656
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:24,250
So.

657
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:26,208
(somber music)

658
01:05:28,416 --> 01:05:29,000
What's your name?

659
01:05:32,791 --> 01:05:33,250
I'm Ravi.

660
01:05:34,208 --> 01:05:34,708
I'm Doctor.

661
01:05:36,708 --> 01:05:39,958
Because more men die of infected wounds

662
01:05:40,041 --> 01:05:42,166
than out there in the arena.

663
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,083
This needs to be
cleaned, needs to be stitched,

664
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:49,000
and it is going to hurt.

665
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:53,166
This is devil's breath and opium.

666
01:05:54,333 --> 01:06:00,458
It's for the pain you should breathe in.

667
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:06,458
I've been here so long now.

668
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,083
They don't even notice anymore.

669
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:11,250
I've done more
amputations than I can count.

670
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,125
Where do you learn your trade?

671
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:15,250
Why do you ask?

672
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:16,750
You've got a heavy hand.

673
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:20,041
I used to be a gladiator myself.

674
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:20,541
Yeah.

675
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,916
What would you have
bested me in your prime course?

676
01:06:26,541 --> 01:06:29,500
In your current
state, I could best you now.

677
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:33,708
Luckily for you, I have put down my sword

678
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:37,375
so now I spend my days saving lives

679
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:39,291
instead of taking them.

680
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,625
Why such a change so late in life?

681
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:48,125
What we do in life echoes in eternity.

682
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,750
I feel like I know those words.

683
01:06:56,041 --> 01:06:56,875
I can't take credit.

684
01:06:56,958 --> 01:06:58,666
It's written on one of the tombs.

685
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:00,958
With the bones of a gladiator.

686
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:05,333
My champion, I smell devil's breath.

687
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:08,583
My.

688
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:13,458
Champion, did you hear that crowd?

689
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:18,125
Did you hear that crowd?

690
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:21,750
You have something.

691
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:23,875
I knew it from the start.

692
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:24,833
Did you now?

693
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:32,791
Yes, the Greeks
call it thymos, smoke, rage.

694
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:35,750
That rage is your gift.

695
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:41,291
Like the great Achilles, never let it go.

696
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:46,125
It will carry you
to greatness, my champion.

697
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:55,375
(fire crackling)

698
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:57,166
(screaming)

699
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:02,333
(growling)

700
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,875
Thank you for inviting me.

701
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,750
This is truly an honor.

702
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:16,291
(water splashing)

703
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:19,833
I hear you are the talk of the court.

704
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:22,375
Yes.

705
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:24,750
We met before.

706
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:26,916
Have we?

707
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:27,458
Long ago.

708
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:30,000
Where?

709
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:33,250
I was in the
service of your father's army

710
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:34,541
on this African campaign.

711
01:08:36,791 --> 01:08:37,875
You served with my father.

712
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:39,750
(groaning)

713
01:08:42,416 --> 01:08:42,708
Hmm.

714
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:48,583
I had the privilege
of reading his meditations.

715
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:49,583
Hmm.

716
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:57,250
The best revenge is to be unlike him

717
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:58,666
who performed the injury.

718
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:04,291
I hear you've been
arming half the legions

719
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:09,083
in the entire
empire, and here, now, in Rome,

720
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:13,375
you're gaining
influence by sponsoring gladiators.

721
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:15,458
I do it for the love of the sport.

722
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:18,500
And where did you find these gladiators?

723
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:24,625
They're usually
prisoners of war or vagrants.

724
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:25,958
Why do you ask?

725
01:09:27,416 --> 01:09:32,875
A man can choose to fight and stay alive.

726
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:35,125
It's the same in life as
it is in the arena, is it not?

727
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:40,083
Who is this?

728
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:42,541
That is my father as a youth.

729
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:47,666
She had a child.

730
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:48,041
Hmm.

731
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,291
It's common
knowledge when comatose was killed,

732
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:53,291
the boy disappeared.

733
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:53,791
Hmm.

734
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:54,791
Well, he would care.

735
01:09:55,416 --> 01:09:56,125
Silla would care.

736
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,083
More wine!

737
01:09:57,583 --> 01:09:58,041
More wine.

738
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:02,958
He was of the royal bloodline, after all.

739
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:06,208
And his father?

740
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,125
Ostensibly.

741
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:10,625
Lucius Verus.

742
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:13,375
You see, it was an arranged marriage.

743
01:10:13,666 --> 01:10:14,583
She was 14.

744
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:17,916
Females were not his taste.

745
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:19,375
Not mine, some days.

746
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:19,833
Not yours.

747
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:20,958
(laughing)

748
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:21,833
No, no, no.

749
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:24,875
By rumor, you see, she took lovers,

750
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:29,291
and by rumor, the
real father was comatose.

751
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:32,166
Brotherly love, you see.

752
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:36,666
If he died, there has to be remains.

753
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:41,000
And if he lived,
that would make him about...

754
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:43,666
Well, let's work it out.

755
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:46,666
He was about 12 when he died.

756
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:47,208
Yes.

757
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:50,125
So that would make him...

758
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:26,000
(dramatic music)

759
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:28,000
My lady.

760
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:29,500
Crackers.

761
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:31,458
Here's the cold.

762
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:32,125
Thank you.

763
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:48,500
(dramatic music)

764
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:51,916
Gladiator.

765
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:55,166
Do you know me?

766
01:11:58,666 --> 01:11:58,875
Hmm.

767
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:04,625
Do you have a family?

768
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:08,291
A wife?

769
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:10,458
Arishat?

770
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:13,166
Arishat?

771
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:16,208
She was killed
under your husband's commands.

772
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,125
For all drowns in its own blood.

773
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:24,125
And yet you enjoy the
pleasures of the Colosseum.

774
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:27,375
There's much you do not understand.

775
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:35,500
(dramatic music)

776
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:36,291
Duchess.

777
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:38,958
I do not know who you think I am.

778
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,791
My name is Hano, and I have no mother

779
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:44,958
or none that I can remember.

780
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:49,291
(dramatic music)

781
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:53,041
I'm so sorry.

782
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:55,333
If you're somewhere here,

783
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,666
I would tell you not to grieve him,

784
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:00,333
for he would not be
the boy that you sent away.

785
01:13:00,416 --> 01:13:01,958
That boy is dead.

786
01:13:04,708 --> 01:13:06,083
You may think I have little worth.

787
01:13:08,541 --> 01:13:10,166
You may think I betrayed you.

788
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:13,791
But I need you to know,

789
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,750
if you will not have your mother's love

790
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:21,000
and take your father's strength,

791
01:13:22,916 --> 01:13:23,125
you need it.

792
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:30,416
His name was Maximus Decimus Mervidius.

793
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:33,250
And I see him in you.

794
01:13:33,791 --> 01:13:34,166
Get out.

795
01:13:36,916 --> 01:13:39,000
My lady, we must go at once.

796
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:44,250
It's just you were loved.

797
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:47,625
By myself and by your father.

798
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:51,583
Your name was on his lips.

799
01:13:51,958 --> 01:13:52,625
Get out!

800
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:54,625
(dramatic music)

801
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:18,625
(dramatic music)

802
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,208
Lucius is alive.

803
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:24,083
Are you certain?

804
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:25,708
Yes.

805
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,541
I know my son.

806
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:33,208
I spoke to him tonight.

807
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:39,875
He may be lost to me for what I did.

808
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,416
But he lives.

809
01:14:44,375 --> 01:14:46,250
The third day of the games is tomorrow.

810
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:48,583
Most fighters won't survive.

811
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:49,333
The cases.

812
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:52,083
You must help him.

813
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:54,750
Help him? Yes.

814
01:14:58,166 --> 01:15:00,083
I failed him then.

815
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,166
I know I did.

816
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,083
I cannot fail him now.

817
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,666
The army is in Ostia.

818
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:13,416
If we wait a few days.

819
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:15,750
He could be dead by then.

820
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,500
The cases.

821
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:20,041
I would willingly give my life forever.

822
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:22,291
Willingly give my life from...

823
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:25,875
But I will not give my sons.

824
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:31,333
One!

825
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:36,333
And two!

826
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:38,833
And one!

827
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:41,458
And one!

828
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:43,333
And one!

829
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:45,250
And two!

830
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:47,291
And two!

831
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:49,125
And one!

832
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:55,041
And one!

833
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:56,375
You won't get far like this.

834
01:15:58,125 --> 01:15:59,041
Just him.

835
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:00,041
You go.

836
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:01,041
Go.

837
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:05,125
Let's see how far you can
go on your own without your team.

838
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:07,916
Ready?

839
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:09,708
One!

840
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:12,625
And two!

841
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:13,791
Diamond, diamond!

842
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,250
Come on, more!

843
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,208
More!

844
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:41,125
Leave it.

845
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:05,375
Just vinegar, my friend. Ah.

846
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:07,750
There will be no more opium for you.

847
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:13,458
There is plenty of pain
waiting for you in the next life.

848
01:17:21,458 --> 01:17:22,750
Are you a free man, Ravi?

849
01:17:23,875 --> 01:17:24,083
Free.

850
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:27,041
I am.

851
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:32,583
I laid down my sword and I
swore never to pick it up again.

852
01:17:32,833 --> 01:17:34,041
And yet you choose this home.

853
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:35,250
Mm-hmm.

854
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:37,166
What was your home before?

855
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:39,333
But I'm Asi.

856
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:41,291
And why don't you go back?

857
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:43,208
I wish I could.

858
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:45,125
Asi.

859
01:17:48,375 --> 01:17:49,125
I met a woman.

860
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:52,750
It's always a woman. Afterwards.

861
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,083
She's from Lomdinium, Britannia.

He used to talk the dream that was Rome.

It was so fragile,
you could only whisper it.

A Rome where all could live
under fair law and be protected.

A Rome with the Senate.

A Rome with hope.

his, but many still talked of him in with Faz.

1032
01:32:23,541 --> 01:32:24,958
Spoke of him.

1033
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:27,166
What he did.

1034
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:29,500
I met him once.

1035
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:32,125
He was kind.

1036
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:37,791
He bowed to no one.

1037
01:32:41,125 --> 01:32:41,750
Come with me.

1038
01:32:43,458 --> 01:32:45,125
Come with me.

1039
01:33:05,125 --> 01:33:08,125
When a rebel
gladiator dies, we bury them.

1040
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:08,791
Here.

1041
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:12,750
What we do in life echoes an eternity.

1042
01:33:20,541 --> 01:33:30,416
(SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

1043
01:33:31,125 --> 01:33:34,125
This is Argento, Mrs. Scato.

1044
01:34:14,125 --> 01:34:15,666
There.

1045
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:18,250
And stop.

1046
01:34:20,375 --> 01:34:25,583
For his treason against the lives of the

1047
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:32,166
emperors and the Roman
state, General Eustace Acacia,

1048
01:34:33,125 --> 01:34:36,291
an enemy of the people.

1049
01:34:38,791 --> 01:34:40,041
We are your ancestors!

1052
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:19,000
Ray Victus. General.

1053
01:35:20,291 --> 01:35:21,000
Get in!

(CHANTING)

1056
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:59,333
From the vanquished city of Numidia,

1057
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:05,791
the victor of two
conquests in the Colosseum...

1058
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:07,750
Go now. Vay Victus.

(CHANTING)

1060
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:16,625
Hello!

1061
01:36:18,333 --> 01:36:22,291
Oh, Lord, any honour I
have, I will give it to you.

1062
01:36:22,375 --> 01:36:22,875
It's too late.

1063
01:36:23,166 --> 01:36:28,291
The Roman traitor or the barbarian hero?

1064
01:36:29,125 --> 01:36:31,000
Let the gods decide.

1065
01:36:31,291 --> 01:36:32,583
Vay Victus, wait.

1066
01:36:34,333 --> 01:36:35,375
Wait! Wait!

I am a vessel.

1070
01:36:49,833 --> 01:36:51,041
Fill me with vengeance.

1071
01:36:53,291 --> 01:36:54,750
Invite with the betrayal.

Pick it up!

1076
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:23,125
No, no, no, no!

1077
01:37:23,333 --> 01:37:24,750
We love you, Acacia!

1078
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:27,083

I know who you are.

Lucius Varys Aurelius.

(CHANTING)

1084
01:38:16,125 --> 01:38:18,291
Acacia has raised his hand!

1085
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:20,833
He has surrendered!

1086
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:31,125
Let the gods decide!

The gods have rented their judgement.

1089
01:38:55,125 --> 01:38:55,708
Do what you must.

1090
01:38:58,416 --> 01:38:59,916
But on my death you have to know...

1091
01:39:01,583 --> 01:39:03,125
I love your mother, Lucilla.

1092
01:39:05,375 --> 01:39:05,875
And your father.

(CHANTING)

1094

Maximus...

1095
01:39:11,958 --> 01:39:13,500
I would have died for him.

1096
01:39:14,375 --> 01:39:15,500
Kill him!

1097
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:17,291
That's it, babe!

1098
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:24,000
(CHANTING)

1099
01:39:30,125 --> 01:39:31,500
Kill him!

1100
01:39:33,416 --> 01:39:34,416
Don't kill him!

1101
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:36,208
I can't!

1102
01:39:36,291 --> 01:39:36,458
No!

1103
01:39:37,041 --> 01:39:37,500
Kill him!

1104
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:40,875
Kill him!

1105
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:42,416
Kill him!

1106
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:44,000
Kill him!

1107
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:44,375
Kill him!

1108
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:45,416
Acacia!

1109
01:39:46,208 --> 01:39:46,666
Acacia!

1110
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:47,625
Acacia!

(CHANTING)

1112
01:39:51,875 --> 01:39:54,166
No!

1113
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:00,750
No!

1114
01:40:02,125 --> 01:40:02,500
Acacia!

1115
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:07,541
I'll damn you!

1116
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,708
Death will be too good for you!

1117
01:40:17,625 --> 01:40:19,250
Is this how Rome treats its hero?

1118
01:40:24,125 --> 01:40:25,750
Tell me!

1119
01:40:28,291 --> 01:40:32,083
If his life has no
value, what do yours want?

1120
01:40:33,125 --> 01:40:36,708
The gods have spoken!

1121
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:48,083
(CHANTING)

01:41:02,125 --> 01:41:05,000
(CHANTING)

1123
01:41:11,125 --> 01:41:13,708
For our own safety, we
should return to the palace.

1124
01:41:32,458 --> 01:41:36,125
Stay back! Stay back!

1125
01:42:02,125 --> 01:42:04,125
(CHANTING)

1126
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:41,208
(CHANTING)

1127
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:48,500
We had a bargain.

1128
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:54,083
I gave him to you.

1129
01:42:55,125 --> 01:42:55,958
You let him live.

1130
01:42:56,416 --> 01:42:57,541
And you got what you wanted.

1131
01:42:57,791 --> 01:42:59,041
I always get what I want.

1132
01:42:59,125 --> 01:43:00,083
Why did you let him live?

1133
01:43:01,125 --> 01:43:02,875
You bought a gladiator, not a slave.

1134
01:43:05,416 --> 01:43:06,875
My will is my own.

1135
01:43:09,125 --> 01:43:09,875
Ah.

1136
01:43:11,125 --> 01:43:12,291
How blue is your blood?

1137
01:43:13,625 --> 01:43:17,166
Perhaps the heart of
a Roman beats in that chest.

1138
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:28,083
The greatest temple
Rome ever built, the Colosseum,

1139
01:43:28,833 --> 01:43:31,583
because this is
what they believe in, power.

1140
01:43:32,375 --> 01:43:35,750
They gather here to watch
the strong strike down of the...

1141
01:43:35,833 --> 01:43:36,833
There has to be something else.

1142
01:43:36,916 --> 01:43:37,666
There is nothing else.

1143
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:39,083
There has to be another Rome.

1144
01:43:39,166 --> 01:43:40,250
There is no other Rome.

1145
01:43:42,083 --> 01:43:42,375
The dream?

1146
01:43:43,708 --> 01:43:44,333
The dream of Rome?

1147
01:43:45,666 --> 01:43:46,916
It's an old man's fantasy.

1148
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,041
Who are you?

1149
01:43:52,291 --> 01:43:55,875
What was your name before
you traded it for a Roman one?

1150
01:43:57,375 --> 01:43:58,416
You'll never know.

1151
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:02,500
I have a destiny.

1152
01:44:06,916 --> 01:44:08,500
The gods delivered you to me.

1153
01:44:11,125 --> 01:44:13,208
You will be my instrument.

1154
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,125
I will never be your
instrument in this life for the next.

1155
01:44:26,125 --> 01:44:27,750
That will not be my destiny.

1156
01:44:30,833 --> 01:44:32,250
But I will see your end.

1157
01:44:36,791 --> 01:44:53,416
What else could I do?

1158
01:44:54,125 --> 01:44:57,250
He and his pigs were plotting to kill us.

1159
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:59,416
Don't you hear them?
They're calling for our heads.

1160
01:45:00,291 --> 01:45:03,000
The Platorians will put down
this crowd like they have every other.

1161
01:45:03,083 --> 01:45:03,916
You brought this on us.

1162
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,166
Shoo!

1163
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:17,125
Perhaps you should take
Dondys elsewhere to comfort him.

1164
01:45:26,916 --> 01:45:28,333
Forgive my brother's outburst.

1165
01:45:30,958 --> 01:45:33,625
The disease that infects
his loins has spread to his brain.

1166
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:35,750
Every day gets worse.

1167
01:45:35,958 --> 01:45:37,125
I will reason with him.

1168
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:55,541
I see you.

1169
01:45:57,708 --> 01:45:59,250
I see you.

1170
01:46:00,708 --> 01:46:02,250
Gotta get on, gotta get on.

1171
01:46:02,833 --> 01:46:03,750
Come on, stand up.

1172
01:46:04,541 --> 01:46:05,833
Get up, get up, not you.

1173
01:46:06,583 --> 01:46:07,666
All right, here you go.

1174
01:46:10,125 --> 01:46:11,666
Now, listen to me.

1175
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:13,500
What's the matter?

1176
01:46:14,833 --> 01:46:15,875
Nothing's ever mine.

1177
01:46:17,041 --> 01:46:18,791
Everything is ours always.

1178
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:22,083
Even in the womb, you try it.

1179
01:46:23,125 --> 01:46:28,750
Do I get my umbilicus so
that I couldn't have any more hair?

1180
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:30,250
You remember that, do you?

1181
01:46:30,541 --> 01:46:30,916
Certainly.

1182
01:46:31,541 --> 01:46:31,916
Sit.

1183
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
One cannot forget.

1184
01:46:33,583 --> 01:46:34,916
My conscience compels me.

1185
01:46:36,041 --> 01:46:36,291
What?

1186
01:46:37,833 --> 01:46:37,958
Sit.

1187
01:46:38,791 --> 01:46:45,291
Your brother means to blame
you in front of the entire Senate.

1188
01:46:46,125 --> 01:46:47,458
But I did not do it.

1189
01:46:47,541 --> 01:46:49,750
Well, what's
happening in the streets? The chaos.

1190
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:51,041
He's lying.

1191
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:56,666
No testimony can be more
damning than one brother against another.

1192
01:46:57,458 --> 01:46:59,583
That's a lie. He always lies.

1193
01:46:59,791 --> 01:47:01,375
He can be very persuasive.

1194
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:04,708
So, what will they do to me?

1195
01:47:05,208 --> 01:47:07,083
I don't dare imagine, but imagine this.

1196
01:47:07,916 --> 01:47:09,250
What will they do to Dondys?

1197
01:47:13,125 --> 01:47:16,041
What will they do to Dondys?

1198
01:47:16,125 --> 01:47:16,833
To Dondys?

1199
01:47:20,458 --> 01:47:21,125
It's your decision.

1200
01:47:46,125 --> 01:47:49,750
(Crowd cheers)

1201
01:47:50,125 --> 01:47:52,458
Help me, young man!

1202
01:47:59,291 --> 01:47:59,333
Brother.

1203
01:48:03,125 --> 01:48:04,291
Put down the blade.

1204
01:48:05,125 --> 01:48:06,083
You lie.

1205
01:48:06,541 --> 01:48:07,166
Give it to me.

1206
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:08,416
You always lie.

1207
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:11,333
Give it to me.

1208
01:48:11,416 --> 01:48:13,708
Look at me.

1209
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:14,750
Look at me.

1210
01:48:15,125 --> 01:48:15,833
Lie!

1211
01:48:16,291 --> 01:48:18,041
Let me break this spell.

1212
01:48:18,458 --> 01:48:18,666
Lie!

1213
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:19,625
Break this spell.

1214
01:48:20,166 --> 01:48:21,833
I've always protected you.

1215
01:48:21,916 --> 01:48:22,791
Because I love you.

1216
01:48:24,166 --> 01:48:24,625
Come back.

1217
01:48:25,125 --> 01:48:26,041
Help me.

1218
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:27,125
Help me.

1219
01:48:47,250 --> 01:49:10,083
(Door opens)

1220
01:49:10,166 --> 01:49:10,291
Doucheous.

1221
01:49:11,166 --> 01:49:14,125
Never could have
imagined the fates would lead us here.

1222
01:49:16,708 --> 01:49:18,250
And yet here we are.

1223
01:49:20,375 --> 01:49:21,833
Everything has brought us full circle.

1224
01:49:21,916 --> 01:49:23,708
You sent me away and you had fate.

1225
01:49:25,083 --> 01:49:27,125
Brought me back to
the very ground where he died.

1226
01:49:30,625 --> 01:49:34,291
This ring belonged to my father.

1227
01:49:39,125 --> 01:49:43,125
He gave it to your
father, Maximus, as a token of trust.

1228
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:48,291
I gave it to Cacius for his valor.

1229
01:49:53,125 --> 01:49:54,500
This ring belonged to my wife.

1230
01:49:58,291 --> 01:49:59,500
I shall wear it next to yours.

1231
01:50:00,125 --> 01:50:05,000
(Chuckles)

1232
01:50:13,125 --> 01:50:15,541
I'm truly sorry for Cacius.

1233
01:50:17,208 --> 01:50:19,750
I could not see the man.

1234
01:50:22,125 --> 01:50:23,791
He was a soldier from...

1235
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:27,041
There was a plan.

1236
01:50:27,125 --> 01:50:32,666
He was readying troops at
Ostia under the command of Darius Cixtus.

1237
01:50:34,166 --> 01:50:36,000
Troops he was to
lead against the emperors.

1238
01:50:39,041 --> 01:50:42,625
Cacius, Maximus, Marcus Aurelius.

1239
01:50:44,416 --> 01:50:45,791
They lived and died for Rome.

1240
01:50:47,333 --> 01:50:48,208
We all do.

1241
01:50:50,125 --> 01:50:52,083
Is it true they intend to kill you?

1242
01:50:53,125 --> 01:50:59,958
One man or another has had a sword
against my neck since the day my father died.

1243
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:07,750
But now that I've
found you, it doesn't matter.

1244
01:51:10,208 --> 01:51:10,958
I am not afraid.

1245
01:51:11,583 --> 01:51:14,000
I've become well versed
in losing the things that I love.

1246
01:51:16,166 --> 01:51:18,041
But now that I've found you,
I have no desire to lose you again.

1247
01:51:18,125 --> 01:51:25,083
You stand like him.

1248
01:51:27,041 --> 01:51:27,208
Alert.

1249
01:51:29,208 --> 01:51:29,375
Proud.

1250
01:51:32,458 --> 01:51:33,750
I do not have his strength.

1251
01:51:34,666 --> 01:51:37,291
I wish that were true.

1252
01:51:39,458 --> 01:51:41,583
I wish I were
telling you to free this place.

1253
01:51:45,041 --> 01:51:45,083
(Door creaks)

1254
01:51:45,125 --> 01:51:49,333
(Door creaks) (Door creaks)

1255
01:51:50,125 --> 01:51:51,750
Go now.

1256
01:52:00,875 --> 01:52:01,458
Strength and honor.

1257
01:52:04,458 --> 01:52:05,166
Strength and honor.

1258
01:52:07,416 --> 01:52:07,916
(Door creaks)

1259
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:08,791
(Door creaks)

1260
01:52:15,125 --> 01:52:18,416
(Door creaks)

1261
01:52:18,916 --> 01:52:25,750
As emperor, I have convened
the Senate to appoint my first consul

1262
01:52:25,833 --> 01:52:29,458
and bestow upon
him the power to administer

1263
01:52:29,541 --> 01:52:32,916
the military and
civic functions of the empire.

1264
01:52:37,125 --> 01:52:41,625
I name Citizen Dardas!

1265
01:52:42,125 --> 01:52:48,833
(Dardas creaks)

1266
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:50,250
Hail Dardas!

1267
01:52:54,375 --> 01:52:55,666
Hail Dardas!

1268
01:52:58,125 --> 01:52:59,541
Hail Dardas.

1269
01:52:59,625 --> 01:53:00,416
Hail Dardas!

1270
01:53:01,125 --> 01:53:01,708
Hail Dardas!

1271
01:53:07,125 --> 01:53:08,750
As second consul,

1272
01:53:11,333 --> 01:53:12,541
I name

1273
01:53:15,125 --> 01:53:15,541
Citizen

1274
01:53:18,125 --> 01:53:19,166
Macronus.

1275
01:53:22,125 --> 01:53:24,083
Hail Macronus!

1276
01:53:24,583 --> 01:53:25,708
Hail Macronus!

1277
01:53:26,125 --> 01:53:27,250
Hail Macronus!

1278
01:53:29,125 --> 01:53:31,291
There will be a
triumphal parade to celebrate.

1279
01:53:32,166 --> 01:53:32,958
There will be games

1280
01:53:35,125 --> 01:53:36,125
and mass executions.

1281
01:53:39,791 --> 01:53:41,583
Long live the empire.

1282
01:53:44,125 --> 01:53:44,916
Long live the empire.

1283
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:54,125
Sit down.

1284
01:53:58,375 --> 01:54:00,750
I happen to have,

1285
01:54:04,125 --> 01:54:07,583
with good fortune and not a little skill,

1286
01:54:10,041 --> 01:54:12,333
the remaining emperors here.

1287
01:54:19,125 --> 01:54:21,125
I can speak logic to it.

1288
01:54:27,125 --> 01:54:29,250
And tame the madness in the street.

1289
01:54:29,541 --> 01:54:29,750
But,

1290
01:54:32,875 --> 01:54:33,750
do we still order?

1291
01:54:36,666 --> 01:54:37,541
I must have power

1292
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:46,250
and command over the Platorian army.

1293
01:54:53,125 --> 01:54:53,625
Ballot?

1294
01:54:56,666 --> 01:54:57,333
Or hand?

1295
01:54:58,041 --> 01:55:01,041
(screams)

1296
01:55:05,125 --> 01:55:06,791
Your humble servant.

1297
01:55:10,125 --> 01:55:13,000
Put your hands down.

1298
01:55:15,375 --> 01:55:16,125
You can sit down.

1299
01:55:26,125 --> 01:55:27,125
So,

1300
01:55:27,541 --> 01:55:28,708
I'm fine.

1301
01:55:31,041 --> 01:55:31,958
Rome must fall.

1302
01:55:35,125 --> 01:55:36,583
I need to only give it a push.

1303
01:55:40,125 --> 01:55:41,791
And after Rome falls,

1304
01:55:44,125 --> 01:55:45,166
what then?

1305
01:55:48,125 --> 01:55:49,333
You are your father's child.

1306
01:55:52,250 --> 01:55:54,041
His dream of Rome was never a dream.

1307
01:55:54,125 --> 01:55:56,458
It was a fiction.

1308
01:55:57,958 --> 01:56:03,791
The best revenge is to become
unlike the one who did the injury.

1309
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:08,666
I have made myself unlike your father.

1310
01:56:09,541 --> 01:56:10,416
He spoke of dreams,

1311
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:12,041
I speak of truth,

1312
01:56:12,583 --> 01:56:14,458
and the only truth in my Rome

1313
01:56:16,125 --> 01:56:17,833
is the law of the strongest.

1314
01:56:20,125 --> 01:56:21,083
I was owned

1315
01:56:21,166 --> 01:56:24,666
by an emperor.

1316
01:56:28,291 --> 01:56:29,791
Now I control an empire.

1317
01:56:31,583 --> 01:56:34,166
Where else but in Rome can a man do that?

1318
01:56:40,375 --> 01:56:44,041
Do you recognize
your father's mark on me?

1319
01:56:47,125 --> 01:56:48,083
If there is anything,

1320
01:56:49,625 --> 01:56:52,166
if there is anything you need,

1321
01:56:54,416 --> 01:56:55,666
in these last hours,

1322
01:56:57,125 --> 01:56:58,000
we will provide.

1323
01:57:04,666 --> 01:57:07,208
Your death will
clear my path to the throne.

1324
01:57:09,291 --> 01:57:11,625
Tomorrow, there will be games,

1325
01:57:12,458 --> 01:57:13,333
and at them,

1326
01:57:14,916 --> 01:57:15,125
I will prevail.

1327
01:57:18,125 --> 01:57:30,583
Robbie!

1328
01:57:32,666 --> 01:57:40,166
Can you get me a
message to Ostia by morning?

1329
01:57:40,958 --> 01:57:41,625
What is it, Ostia?

1330
01:57:42,291 --> 01:57:43,000
There is an army.

1331
01:57:45,125 --> 01:57:47,916
I'm asking you to
risk yourself, my friend,

1332
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,541
on the surface of something greater.

1333
01:57:53,083 --> 01:57:53,791
Ride to Ostia.

1334
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:58,250
Take this ring to General
Darius Sextus, are you listening?

1335
01:57:59,958 --> 01:58:01,291
Darius Sextus?

1336
01:58:02,125 --> 01:58:03,958
You will know it as a caseus's ring.

1337
01:58:08,125 --> 01:58:09,208
And, uh,

1338
01:58:10,125 --> 01:58:11,416
who shall I say is

1339
01:58:12,125 --> 01:58:13,125
sent me with this ring?

1340
01:58:15,125 --> 01:58:19,333
I am Lucius Verus Eradius,

1341
01:58:20,208 --> 01:58:22,166
the Prince of Rome.

1342
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,041
Tell him I am summoning the
army to the defense of a new republic.

1343
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:37,791
Should I trust you?

1344
01:58:37,875 --> 01:58:38,041
Yes.

1345
01:58:38,333 --> 01:58:38,625
Should I?

1346
01:58:39,125 --> 01:58:39,166
Yes.

1347
01:58:46,791 --> 01:58:48,708
Robbie, I need your keys.

1348
01:58:55,125 --> 01:58:56,125
Thank you.

1349
01:59:32,125 --> 01:59:32,291
No!

1350
01:59:36,125 --> 01:59:36,833
Come back!

1351
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:09,041
Who gave you this?

1352
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:11,041
Lucius Verus Eradius?

1353
02:00:11,125 --> 02:00:12,125
The Prince of Rome?

1354
02:01:08,333 --> 02:01:09,875
A street kill, Lucerne.

1355
02:01:13,041 --> 02:01:16,000
Until she dies,
you will never know peace.

1356
02:01:18,333 --> 02:01:18,750
Ever.

1357
02:01:29,125 --> 02:01:32,791
If the people love her,
her death will incite the mob.

1358
02:01:33,041 --> 02:01:35,500
If she dies and the
streets rise up in anger,

1359
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:37,333
I shall deliver them Caracalla's head,

1360
02:01:37,416 --> 02:01:40,125
and the people shall
acclaim me that my friend is...

1361
02:01:42,291 --> 02:01:45,583
Shall we?

1362
02:01:45,833 --> 02:01:46,083
Yes.

1363
02:01:49,208 --> 02:02:03,875
Today will be your last fight, Champion.

1364
02:02:05,166 --> 02:02:07,083
And our master has bestowed on you.

1365
02:02:09,541 --> 02:02:11,458
The wooden sword of freedom.

1366
02:02:15,125 --> 02:02:16,833
But you have to earn it first.

1367
02:02:18,041 --> 02:02:20,125
Today, you're
going to defend your mother.

1368
02:02:38,458 --> 02:02:46,125
Would all steal a
point? There's still a point!

1369
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:14,083
Wait for me.

1370
02:03:29,916 --> 02:03:39,500
In honor of the
acclimation of Emperor Caracalla,

1371
02:03:40,125 --> 02:03:44,958
the first council, dondus
and second council, macronuts,

1372
02:03:45,416 --> 02:03:50,083
and as punishment for her
conspiracy against the empire,

1373
02:03:50,583 --> 02:03:54,750
for her calamities, against
the emperor's imperial bloodline,

1374
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,666
and for fermenting military mutiny.

1375
02:03:57,750 --> 02:04:02,291
Along with her husband,
the queen will face divine justice

1376
02:04:02,375 --> 02:04:05,791
at the hands of the praetorian guard.

1377
02:04:31,625 --> 02:04:37,458
I'm not a general,
but we are all soldiers.

1378
02:04:40,250 --> 02:04:45,375
And up until now, we have fought for
nothing more than another day's survival.]

1379
02:04:46,791 --> 02:04:47,708
What will you have us do?

1380
02:04:49,541 --> 02:04:52,458
Well, you can return to yourselves
if you do not wish to fight this battle.

1381
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:54,375
Or,

1382
02:04:57,041 --> 02:04:57,958
you can join me

1383
02:04:58,125 --> 02:05:01,958
and fight for a
freedom far beyond these walls.

1384
02:05:02,583 --> 02:05:07,125
That once was a time when
honor meant something and road.

1385
02:05:09,708 --> 02:05:13,916
In this road, I no
longer believe that exists.

1386
02:05:14,291 --> 02:05:16,583
We must find it.

1387
02:05:17,041 --> 02:05:24,541
And know this,
where death is, we are not.

1388
02:05:27,833 --> 02:05:31,458
Where we are, death is not.

1389
02:05:33,125 --> 02:05:35,541
By my sword.

1390
02:05:38,958 --> 02:05:39,416
Strength another!

1391
02:05:40,208 --> 02:05:40,916
Strength another!

1392
02:05:42,125 --> 02:05:42,750
Strength another!

1393
02:05:43,666 --> 02:05:44,583
Strength another!

1394
02:06:02,125 --> 02:06:03,166
Get up, guys!

1395
02:06:03,333 --> 02:06:15,041
Let it not be said that
the Emperor is not merciful.

1396
02:06:16,208 --> 02:06:20,416
The Queen will be
granted a single gladiator

1397
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:24,416
to defend her
against the Praetorian Guard.

1398
02:06:32,125 --> 02:06:36,958
The champion, Hano!

1399
02:07:37,708 --> 02:07:57,041
The Queen will be
granted a single gladiator

1400
02:07:57,125 --> 02:07:57,208
to defend her
against the Praetorian Guard.

1401
02:07:57,291 --> 02:07:59,500
Summon the
cavalry. Put this down at once.

1402
02:08:00,125 --> 02:08:02,916
This is war! Real war!

1403
02:08:06,625 --> 02:08:12,083
The army of Arces is
advancing just outside of Rome, sir.

1404
02:08:14,125 --> 02:08:17,875
We can still out-flank them.
They have only 5,000 troops. No more.

1405
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:20,416
How many are we?

1406
02:08:21,291 --> 02:08:22,750
6,000, perhaps more.

1407
02:08:23,291 --> 02:08:24,333
Ride to the gate and hold them.

1408
02:08:31,125 --> 02:08:41,750
They are barfing fire at their

1409
02:09:12,458 --> 02:09:15,916
(yelling)

1410
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:17,166
Go, please, go!

1411
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:31,583
Delicious.

1412
02:09:34,416 --> 02:09:34,833
Gimme the bowl.

1413
02:09:48,625 --> 02:09:59,708
(yelling)

1414
02:09:59,791 --> 02:10:00,333
Go, my son.

1415
02:10:01,125 --> 02:10:01,375
Losers.

1416
02:10:03,291 --> 02:10:03,541
Pause.

1417
02:10:05,458 --> 02:10:06,500
(yelling)

1418
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:17,625
(yelling)

1419
02:10:17,708 --> 02:10:21,916
(yelling)

1420
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,375
(yelling)

1421
02:10:42,500 --> 02:11:07,208
(yelling)

1422
02:11:07,291 --> 02:11:09,166
(yelling)

1423
02:11:19,083 --> 02:11:26,791
(yelling)

1424
02:11:37,083 --> 02:11:39,000
Will nothing kill this barbarian?

1425
02:11:39,541 --> 02:11:41,375
Name is Lucius Ferris Aurelius.

1426
02:11:42,250 --> 02:11:44,333
The man does not
become emperor by bloodline alone.

1427
02:11:44,416 --> 02:11:47,541
He must be taken by
force and kept by force.

1428
02:11:47,625 --> 02:11:48,750
Are you such a man as this?

1429
02:11:48,958 --> 02:11:50,250
I don't fight for power.

1430
02:11:51,291 --> 02:11:53,541
I fight to free Rome from men like you

1431
02:11:53,625 --> 02:11:54,791
and to return it to them.

1432
02:11:55,208 --> 02:11:57,875
The gods themselves want Rome reborn.

1433
02:11:58,125 --> 02:12:00,666
They sent me to fulfill that task.

1434
02:12:01,083 --> 02:12:04,541
And what if your
gods sent me here to kill you?

1435
02:12:05,083 --> 02:12:05,791
(yelling)

1436
02:12:05,875 --> 02:12:08,583
It's time to end this, Maconess.

1437
02:12:09,291 --> 02:12:10,250
(yelling)

1438
02:12:12,291 --> 02:12:25,583
(yelling)

1439
02:12:25,666 --> 02:12:28,000
(yelling)

1440
02:12:28,083 --> 02:12:46,625
(yelling) (yelling)

1441
02:12:46,708 --> 02:12:55,166
(dramatic music)

1442
02:13:12,250 --> 02:13:15,458
[screaming]

1443
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:19,666
Strengthen on her, myself.

1444
02:13:23,166 --> 02:13:27,750
[grunting]

1445
02:13:27,833 --> 02:13:31,000
[grunting]

1446
02:13:31,083 --> 02:13:33,875
[screaming]

1447
02:13:33,958 --> 02:14:07,416
[screaming] [gasping]

1448
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:08,208
[grunting]

1449
02:14:12,250 --> 02:14:13,250
[grunting]

1450
02:14:42,250 --> 02:14:49,250
[grunting]

1451
02:14:53,958 --> 02:14:55,375
You look to me to speak.

1452
02:14:58,208 --> 02:15:01,500
I know not what to say other
than we have all known too much death.

1453
02:15:03,166 --> 02:15:05,916
Let no more blood be
spilled in the name of tyranny.

1454
02:15:06,333 --> 02:15:06,958
[screaming]

1455
02:15:10,541 --> 02:15:16,333
My grandfather Marcus Aurelius
talked of the dream that would be roamed.

1456
02:15:17,083 --> 02:15:23,833
A dream that my father,
Maximus Decimus Meridius, died for.

1457
02:15:26,041 --> 02:15:26,708
An ideal.

1458
02:15:30,208 --> 02:15:33,750
A city for the many
and a refuge for those in need.

1459
02:15:34,541 --> 02:15:36,416
A home worth fighting for.

1460
02:15:38,125 --> 02:15:42,000
A home that Maximus
spent his life defending.

1461
02:15:44,708 --> 02:15:45,916
That dream is lost.

1462
02:15:50,083 --> 02:15:52,250
But dare we...

1463
02:15:52,333 --> 02:15:53,416
...dare we...

1464
02:15:55,458 --> 02:15:57,791
...rebuild that dream together?

1465
02:16:10,083 --> 02:16:11,041
What say you?

1466
02:16:18,333 --> 02:16:19,041
Hey!

1467
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:21,958
Hey!

1468
02:16:23,083 --> 02:16:23,666
Hey!

1469
02:16:25,791 --> 02:16:28,291
[screaming]

1470
02:16:28,375 --> 02:16:28,541
Hey!

1471
02:16:29,041 --> 02:16:29,458
Hey!

1472
02:16:35,375 --> 02:17:33,750
[screaming] Mother.

1473
02:18:22,833 --> 02:18:24,541
[Breathing heavily]

1474
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:28,541
Speak to me, Father.
