4
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,660
- [Linda] Do you mind if
I ask about your father?

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,660
- Oh, yeah, he lives on the
north end of town by himself.

6
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,121
I haven't seen him in over a year though.

7
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:35,954
(background chatter)

8
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:36,787
- I know it must be hard.

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,610
- Why would I want to
see the devil himself?

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,705
- He's not the devil. He's your dad?

11
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:44,530
- Well he sure seems a lot like the devil.

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,250
I didn't ask for him to
push me around as a kid.

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,670
I didn't ask for him to hit my mom

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,063
and scream and cuss at me.

15
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:54,913
I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled.

16
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,283
- It's okay.

17
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,910
I never told you about my father, have I?

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,323
- No, you haven't.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,290
- Daniel, tHere's a reason

20
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,440
why I've never said a
word about my father.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,850
- You never told me how you got that.

22
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,623
- My father was abusive, also.

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,940
He would cuss at me and push me down.

24
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,550
When I was about 10 years old

25
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,100
I came home from school one day

26
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:35,040
to see my dad screaming at my mom.

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,090
He's dropping every cuss word imaginable.

28
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:42,533
He had her pinned up
against the wall in tears.

29
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:45,368
He was choking her.

30
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:49,490
I was so angry.

31
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,623
I threw my bag on the
ground and I ran to my dad.

32
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,990
I jumped on his back to
try to get him off my mom.

33
00:01:57,685 --> 00:01:58,823
I was so angry.

34
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,260
I just wanted to protect my mom

35
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:05,133
but it was clearly no use.

36
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,603
He grabbed me and threw me down.

37
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,350
My face caught the corner of the table

38
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,013
and it cut it clean open.

39
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,180
I was so angry though.

40
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,053
I stood up right there
with blood everywhere.

41
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:29,835
I just wanted to protect her.

42
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,583
My dad started walking towards me again.

43
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,133
My mom stepped between us.

44
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:41,230
He struck her right in the face,

45
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,603
turned, walked right out the door.

46
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,053
I never saw him again.

47
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,443
- Melinda, I am so sorry.

48
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,590
- I know as much as I hate
my father for what he did,

49
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,883
I can't but wonder where he is today.

50
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,533
Even if he's okay.

51
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,423
I honestly don't even know if he's alive.

52
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,980
I gotta get to work.

53
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,900
- With all this work

54
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,230
are you going to be able to keep up

55
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,890
during the fall semester?

56
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,990
- I'm not sure I'm going to be taking any.

57
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,210
- What do you mean?

58
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,583
- It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

59
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,353
- It's okay.

60
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,093
Will you at least be
at Bible study tonight?

61
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:48,093
- I don't think so. I have
somewhere I need to be.

62
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:49,963
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,043
- It's okay.

64
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,170
Thanks for meeting me again.

65
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,720
Same time next week?

66
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,134
- I wouldn't miss it.

67
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:59,634
(both laugh quietly)

68
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:02,199
(Daniel sighs)

69
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:05,218
- I'll beat you to the
tip one of these days.

70
00:04:05,218 --> 00:04:08,135
(knocking on door)

71
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,340
- Daniel.

72
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,290
- Hi dad.

73
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,123
- Hey.

74
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,593
I'm sorry, come on in.

75
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,753
Can I get you something to drink?

76
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:28,010
- Err, no, thank you but
thanks for the offer.

77
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,210
- [Daniel's Dad] Okay, all right.

78
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,900
Um, do you want a chair?

79
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,733
- Thank you.

80
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,280
- [Daniel's Dad] So,
er, how have you been?

81
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,833
- Um, I've been fine.

82
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,923
How have you been?

83
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,520
(sad music)

84
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,353
- I'm doing all right.

85
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,650
- How come I don't hear from you anymore?

86
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,560
- What do you mean?

87
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,410
- I don't hear from you anymore, dad.

88
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,530
- You don't come around to see me.

89
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,623
- Well, I shouldn't have to.

90
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,123
- Look, it's not the best situation.

91
00:05:03,123 --> 00:05:05,000
- When is it ever?

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,760
You know, you know what's really sad, dad?

93
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,660
I'm having a hard time remembering
the good times we have.

94
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,573
- Son, listen, there was
something I was wanting,

95
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:15,406
wanting to talk you about.

96
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:17,053
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't.

97
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:21,750
(door slams)

98
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,650
- Sweetheart. You need to
take some time to rest.

99
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,870
- Unfortunately, taking
time off of work to rest

100
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,443
is not the best idea for me.

101
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,973
There's nowhere else for me to go.

102
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:34,659
You raised me half my life,

103
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:36,720
the least I can do has
help support you now.

104
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,600
- I don't want you worrying about me.

105
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,823
- Grandma, my worry for you
is what's keeping you alive.

106
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,010
My worry for you causes me to work

107
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,683
as much as I can to help you.

108
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,190
- You're worrying is not
what's keeping me alive.

109
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,363
You know what is.

110
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:55,070
- I'm thankful that God
is keeping you alive,

111
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,090
but the hospitals still
need to be paid for.

112
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,600
- Of course, but paid or
unpaid, God has a plan.

113
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,830
And if it's for me to go
home soon, well then...

114
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:08,413
- Grandma.

115
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:12,300
- You need to be willing
to follow God's plan,

116
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,523
whatever it is.

117
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,913
You've heard the doctors.

118
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,970
You know, they said I haven't long.

119
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,030
- Grandma, you can't...

120
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,090
- It's, since your grandfather died

121
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,823
God showed his love and mercy
for me by giving me you.

122
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:37,601
I don't, I don't want to
take away from your life.

123
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,733
I just, I want you to promise one thing.

124
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,270
I want you to be here when I pass.

125
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,750
I know the Lord will be with me,

126
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,943
but I want you here too.

127
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,440
- Does anyone know if Melinda
is going to make it tonight?

128
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,333
- As far as I know she isn't coming.

129
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,200
- She hasn't been able to
come for almost a month now.

130
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,030
Any news on her grandma?

131
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:05,863
- I haven't heard anything.

132
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:07,693
- From what I heard, not well.

133
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:10,780
- [Pastor[ I think we should Pray.

134
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,730
- [Daniel] I agree.

135
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,200
- Heavenly father, we all
pray for Melinda right now.

136
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,253
She's facing a lot with her grandmother.

137
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,210
Father, we want to help her out.

138
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,596
We just ask that you would show us

139
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:26,429
what you'd have us to do.

140
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,230
Lord, we just pray for
your will to be done.

141
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,994
We ask that you would show
Melinda what you'd have her,

142
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:39,994
whatever you ask of her,
show it, show her your will.

143
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,133
Guide her Lord.

144
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,163
Pray, Lord, your peace and
comfort and rest on her.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,693
We ask your healing hand
on her grandmother, Becky.

146
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:54,880
Guide them, guide us all in
your mighty name, we pray. Amen.

147
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,563
- Oh please, Lord, not like this.

148
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,730
Lord, if it is your will
that I go home to you soon,

149
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,267
let it be so, but please don't take her.

150
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:13,267
- [Doctor] Hi Becky, it's
going to be all right

151
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:15,820
but we need to get you
back to your rook, okay?

152
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,413
- There's someone I need you to call.

153
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,273
- Hello.

154
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,380
I'll be right there.

155
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,290
- Guys. I need to go.

156
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,250
Melinda's in the hospital.

157
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,400
- Visiting her grandma?

158
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,080
- No. Well, she was, she got hit by a car

159
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,030
in the parking lot.

160
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,433
Sorry Daniel, I need to go.

161
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:48,956
- Are you Pastor David?

162
00:08:48,956 --> 00:08:51,168
- Yes, is she okay?

163
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:55,390
- She'll live. A couple of
bruises and a concussion.

164
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,941
- Is she okay?

165
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:57,774
(sad music)

166
00:08:57,774 --> 00:09:00,300
- Yes, she is lucky to be alive.

167
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,920
Her injuries could have
been much more severe

168
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,383
given the circumstances,

169
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,583
but she will never be able to walk again.

170
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,503
- Does she know?

171
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,513
- [Doctor] Yes.

172
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,130
- May we see her?

173
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:21,264
- I'll give you some time.

174
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,123
- Is she okay?

175
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,033
- Thank you.

176
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,433
- She's lucky to be alive.

177
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,530
- I heard what happened. I'm so sorry.

178
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,443
- Thank you guys for coming to see me.

179
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,910
- Look Melinda.

180
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,483
I know this must be difficult.

181
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,783
- You wanna know what's
going to be difficult?

182
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,390
I haven't been to study in a while

183
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,903
because I've been working.

184
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,290
I'm the only one paying for
my grandma's medical bills

185
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,463
and Medicare can't cover all of it.

186
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,210
- Why didn't you tell us we,
we could have helped you.

187
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,380
The church could have a fundraiser.

188
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,130
- I didn't want to have to do that.

189
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,290
- There's nothing wrong
with asking for help.

190
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,123
You need help.

191
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:18,830
- Now I have to go through
some physical therapy

192
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,093
to help me get used my
legs not functioning.

193
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,930
- Did they say how long
the therapy would last?

194
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,120
- Believe it or not only a few weeks.

195
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,470
That's including all
of the boring paperwork

196
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,476
and figuring out the housing situation.

197
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:38,393
(knocking on door)

198
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,430
- Daniel, come in.

199
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,477
What brings you the most here?

200
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:50,525
I was worried I might not
see for a while there.

201
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,713
- Um, I wanted to apologize.

202
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:59,293
I'm very angry with you,
but I realized something.

203
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,033
Last night God showed
me the value of life.

204
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,573
I almost lost my best friend.

205
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,053
- I heard what happened. I'm really sorry.

206
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:17,100
Here, why don't you have a chair.

207
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,360
- Thank you.

208
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,360
I wanted to come and talk and at least try

209
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,220
and if I'm being honest,
I don't want to try.

210
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,913
I want to walk out that door,

211
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:30,916
(sad music)

212
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:31,866
but I know if I do,

213
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:37,685
I won't be ever, be
able to forgive myself.

214
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,840
- Therefore do not be
anxious about tomorrow

215
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,173
for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.

216
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,483
Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.

217
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,123
Matthew 6:34.

218
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,900
- How did you know that?

219
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,400
(Dad sighs)

220
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,063
You just expect me to
believe that you changed.

221
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:11,690
- I know I can't expect you
to just believe my words.

222
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,963
I have to show you that I'm different.

223
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,810
I'm a new creation.

224
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,623
- How did this happen?

225
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:22,917
(sad music continues)

226
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:24,617
- Now that my son is a long story.

227
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,950
I met very sweet lady and
she helped point me to him.

228
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,930
- So you went on a date with a lady?

229
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,913
- No. Oh no.

230
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,600
Not a date.

231
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,690
- What was it then?

232
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
- you could say we're good friends, now.

233
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,290
- Dad, I'm, I'm speechless

234
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,803
and quite frankly, I find
this hard to believe.

235
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,040
- I know son that this is

236
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,790
completely out of the blue for you,

237
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,360
but I've been reading this

238
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,090
and it's absolutely incredible.

239
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,430
It's like every type of hardship,

240
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,563
every difficult situation in life.

241
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,360
It's like, there's an
answer for it in here.

242
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,703
- I, I just, I.

243
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,300
I'm sorry I have to think

244
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,490
and, and pray about this.

245
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,803
I hope you understand.

246
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:38,487
(door closes)

247
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:39,320
(background chatter)

248
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,923
Hey, it's good to see you.

249
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:41,864
- It's good to be back.

250
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,780
I figured you'd be here at our usual time.

251
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,310
- Really? How?

252
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,410
- What if I don't say.

253
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,513
(both laugh)

254
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:51,593
- Um, can I get you anything?
Coffee or something?

255
00:13:51,593 --> 00:13:53,816
- Yeah. That'd be great if
you could get me my usual.

256
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:55,649
- Perfect.
- Thank you.

257
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:58,870
(phone vibrates)

258
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,916
Hey uncle Tom.

259
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,621
- Hi Melinda, how are you?

260
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:04,660
- Doing my best. Considering
the circumstances.

261
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,780
- I understand.

262
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,460
Your aunt and I have been praying for you.

263
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,440
- Thank you.

264
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,418
I really appreciate that.

265
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,953
- So, er, you're
messaging me about Daniel?

266
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,750
- Yeah. I just wanted your advice.

267
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,637
I have a few minutes before he
comes back with the coffees.

268
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:25,808
- Let me tell you something, Melinda.

269
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:27,033
There's nothing wrong with having

270
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,633
a good Christ centered
friendship with Daniel,

271
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:32,990
but if you want to take it a step further

272
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,163
then you need to let
the Lord lead the way.

273
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:42,560
- But what if he doesn't like
me, because of, you know...

274
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,347
- Remember what Isaiah
chapter 40 verse one says,

275
00:14:46,347 --> 00:14:49,713
"But they who wait for the Lord
shall renew their strength.

276
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:52,733
They shall mount up wings like eagles.

277
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,920
They shall run and not be weary.

278
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,070
They shall walk and not faint."

279
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,523
Wait for the Lord, Melinda.

280
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:02,280
- Thank you Uncle Tom.

281
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,113
I got to go.

282
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,580
- Take care Melinda.

283
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,530
- They'll bring it up.

284
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,450
- It's nice to be back here.

285
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,470
- Well, it's nice having you back.

286
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,390
I've been getting really
lonely sitting here every week.

287
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,010
- Daniel, why?

288
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,843
(Daniel laughs)

289
00:15:23,843 --> 00:15:26,083
- I can't, I can't explain it.

290
00:15:27,596 --> 00:15:28,429
- Okay.

291
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,140
- Hey, so actually some of us

292
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,950
are meeting up at the church here

293
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,783
in a little bit.

294
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,980
I was about to head out there
myself when you showed up.

295
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,390
- Wait, why?

296
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,300
- Oh. To discuss ideas.

297
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,133
- Ideas?

298
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:47,101
- Yeah, ideas on how to pay
for your grandma Becky's bills.

299
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:48,490
- Ah, I don't even know what to say.

300
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,280
- Well, if you have any
ideas, we'd love to hear them.

301
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,620
- Okay. Let's go.

302
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,963
- Perfect.

303
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:54,796
- Can you give me a ride to the church?

304
00:15:54,796 --> 00:15:56,695
- If your wheelchair can fit my car.

305
00:15:56,695 --> 00:15:58,528
- Of course it'll fit.

306
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:02,223
- Ah, one of these days.

307
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:07,010
(calm music)

308
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,227
- Hey, glad to see you out and about.

309
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:14,180
- Ow, still a little sore.

310
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,280
- Oh, I'm, I'm so sorry.

311
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,113
- It's okay.

312
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:21,606
I'm glad to be out.

313
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,682
I could only take so much
of that hospital food.

314
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:25,985
(all laugh)

315
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,673
- That's fair. I can safely
say we're all glad you're here.

316
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,633
Okay guys. I have a
visitor to join us today.

317
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,230
- Hello there.

318
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,690
- Hi grandma.
(grandma laughs)

319
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,800
- Hello, sweetheart.

320
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,240
Did your uncle Tom get hold of you?

321
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,073
- He did.

322
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,410
- That's great. It's good.

323
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,947
So I have some news for you.
It's hopefully good news.

324
00:16:56,868 --> 00:16:59,400
- I could use some good news.

325
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,892
- Well, your hospital bills
and your physical therapy pills

326
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:06,510
have all been paid for.

327
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,530
- What?
Who paid?

328
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,993
- I haven't a clue,

329
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:16,840
but apparently the Lord
decided to help out.

330
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,783
- So now all we need to
do is focus on your bills?

331
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,980
- Exactly. Which is where the,

332
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,753
I hope it's good news, comes in.

333
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,980
- All right, I'm listening.

334
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,640
- Well, there's a, a
technique and a strategy.

335
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,880
Actually, it's a kind of
surgery that they can do

336
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,890
and if I go through with it,

337
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,260
it will put me on the road to recovery,

338
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,723
but it's a long shot.

339
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,446
- That's amazing.

340
00:17:46,446 --> 00:17:48,040
(grandmother sigh heavily)

341
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,000
- Yes, but, well, it's
sort of experimental

342
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,520
and so Medicare won't pay for it.

343
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,903
Can't pay for it and it's very expensive.

344
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,630
I, er, I don't know.

345
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:09,630
I think perhaps it's just
time for me to go home.

346
00:18:09,765 --> 00:18:11,165
- No, please don't say that.

347
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:15,840
- It's, what am I supposed to say?

348
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,173
I am, I am an old woman.

349
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,047
The point being that...

350
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,966
Well Pastor Dave has said the team,

351
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:28,249
that you need to work
together to raise the funds.

352
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:33,249
And well, I'm not going to go
through with this procedure

353
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,490
if it's going to put you in debt.

354
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,820
- So what you're saying is

355
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,350
in order for you to go
through with the procedure,

356
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,110
we have to come up with at least
a fair amount of the funds?

357
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,123
- Exactly.

358
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,970
- Please go through with the procedure.

359
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,020
- Sweetheart, I'm more than grateful

360
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,703
that Pastor David is going
to help raise the funds.

361
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,003
What I need you to do is trust the Lord.

362
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,940
- I love you Grandma.

363
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,390
- I love you too, sweetheart.

364
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,903
- So, now it's just
race against the clock.

365
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,920
- That's one way to put it.

366
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,403
- I forgot to ask her how
much we need to raise.

367
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,713
- Holy cow. That's a lot.

368
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:39,743
- Yes, it is.

369
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,450
Your grandma didn't
want to put you in debt.

370
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,590
If she were to go through
with the procedure,

371
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,830
you would be the one legally
responsible to carry the debt.

372
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,830
Which is why we need to raise the funds.

373
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,480
- How much time do we have?

374
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,763
- Not much. A few weeks at the most.

375
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,260
- Thank you guys for doing this.

376
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,463
I really appreciate it.

377
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,800
- You're our sister in Christ.

378
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,550
We need to be there for each other.

379
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:12,990
Let's get to work.

380
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,880
- So it's basically a
race against the clock

381
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,990
because she will not get the treatment

382
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,023
unless she knows she has all the money.

383
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,710
- She doesn't want to put Melinda in debt.

384
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,820
- Well, how come she can't
just get the treatment

385
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,180
and then you guys paid off and work at it

386
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,330
like you've been doing?

387
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:36,410
- Well, honestly, it's looking like

388
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,353
we're not even going to get
close to the amount we need.

389
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,543
Also, she's not even guaranteed
to survive the operation.

390
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,283
- How much money do you need?

391
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,943
- The operation itself
costs over 50 grand.

392
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,643
- Oh, my.

393
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,563
- Yeah.

394
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,290
We've started a GoFundMe in
hopes that people will donate.

395
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,520
Hopefully whoever paid off
Melinda's hospital bills

396
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,683
will help out again.

397
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,793
- Who paid off her bills?

398
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,340
- That's the thing. We don't know.

399
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,633
- Prayer.

400
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,203
- It's hard sometimes.

401
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,430
- But it's the answer, isn't it?

402
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:30,403
- Yeah.

403
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,430
We're doing a couple of
freewill donation events

404
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:36,250
at the church next week.

405
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,253
Hopefully that will at least
get some of the money we need.

406
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,543
- So what's a GoFundMe?

407
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:52,070
- Oh, it's a website where
people can go and donate money.

408
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,810
It's nice because we can
put it up on Facebook

409
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,900
and other social media sites.

410
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,649
- So you can share a website to Facebook?

411
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:05,316
(Daniel laughs)

412
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,713
- Nevermind dad.

413
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,980
- No, really.

414
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,460
I mean, I mean, I want to know,

415
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,871
is it like a miniature
version of the website

416
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:19,310
on Facebook inside there or...

417
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,369
(Daniel laughs)

418
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:24,420
- It's nice to be out.

419
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,680
Thank you for this.

420
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,048
- No problem.

421
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:29,180
Ho has it been trying to adjust?

422
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,253
If you don't mind me asking.

423
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,330
- It's been difficult.

424
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,613
I have a sudden urge to stand.

425
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,073
Legs won't move.

426
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,790
I can never be a famous athlete.

427
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,550
- Is that something you wanted to be?

428
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,263
- No, thankfully,

429
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,090
- Thankfully our lives here are temporary

430
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,194
and we shall one day be walking
in Heaven with the Lord.

431
00:22:56,194 --> 00:22:58,219
(background chatter)

432
00:22:58,219 --> 00:23:00,893
- I can't wait to walk again.

433
00:23:01,742 --> 00:23:04,643
- Not only walk, but run.

434
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,623
- That's true.

435
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,467
- But as of right now, you
must trust in the Lord.

436
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:16,319
So, what do you think of Daniel?

437
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,069
(Melinda laughs)

438
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,359
(piano music)

439
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,359
♪ I want to know that You're near me ♪

440
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,980

♪ Here with me ♪

445
00:23:50,392 --> 00:23:52,070
- Hello Daniel.

446
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,330
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.

447
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,970
- Oh, well yes, but nevermind.

448
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,923
Come sit down.

449
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:02,840
Daniel, have I told you the story

450
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,453
about how Melinda helped a stranger?

451
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,820
- I don't believe so.

452
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,200
Since this is the first
time we've ever talked,

453
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,920
I've only seen you before.

454
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,533
- Of course, of course my
memory isn't what it used to be.

455
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:16,430
(both laugh)

456
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,440
Well, but, well,

457
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,370
the story is that we were in a store

458
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,290
and the clerk was trying to get something

459
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,710
off the top shelf for a customer

460
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,990
and he couldn't quite reach it.

461
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,020
So he went off to get
a ladder or something

462
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:34,500
and I turned my back for just a moment

463
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,143
to pick something off a shelf,

464
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,550
turned back and Melinda
was climbing the shelves

465
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:44,368
to the top shelf to get
the package for the clerk.

466
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:45,201
- [Daniel] How old was she?

467
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:47,372
- Oh, I don't know. Seven or eight.

468
00:24:47,372 --> 00:24:48,205
(Daniel laughs)

469
00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:49,740
But the point being Daniel

470
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,843
is that she's always had her
heart in the right place.

471
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,420
- Yes, she has.

472
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,900
- And she has a very tender heart, Daniel.

473
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,340
Don't break it.

474
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,563
- What do you mean?

475
00:25:05,189 --> 00:25:07,700
- Well I see the way you look at her

476
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,283
and if you do end up together, I just,

477
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,013
I just want to make sure that
she'll be safe and protected.

478
00:25:18,461 --> 00:25:19,893
- Is it that obvious?

479
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:20,726
- Oh, yes.

480
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,270
Now I'll tell you a secret.

481
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:28,010
I think she feels the same
way and I see it in her too

482
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,540
when she looks at you or talks about you,

483
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,863
the two of you together.

484
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,530
I mean, when you look at each other

485
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,030
and you talk about each other.

486
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,723
- [Daniel] You're going
to have to make a choice.

487
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,530
- Daniel, what are you talking about?

488
00:25:57,626 --> 00:25:59,303
- Are you going to choose the cross?

489
00:26:14,584 --> 00:26:16,133
(running footsteps)

490
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:17,141
- Get off her.

491
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:18,724
- Get off me child.

492
00:26:20,102 --> 00:26:21,658
(sounds of struggle)

493
00:26:21,658 --> 00:26:25,930
Fucking kill you.

494
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,289
(running footsteps)

495
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:30,872
(dramatic music continues)

496
00:26:50,702 --> 00:26:53,702
(music intensifies)

497
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,640
- You've ruined everything.

498
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,160
I never wanted you.

499
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,777
I had hopes, I had dreams
and you ruined it all.

500
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:29,380
- No.
- You were a mistake.

501
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,197
- No.
- You are a mistake

502
00:27:31,197 --> 00:27:32,259
- No.

503
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:35,016
- You ruined my life. You ruined it.

504
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:37,623
(distorted) You ruined my life.

505
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,214
(Melinda cries)

506
00:27:39,214 --> 00:27:41,881
(Melinda pants)

507
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,120
(background chatter)

508
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,430
- Hey, are you okay?

509
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,278
- Yeah. I'm okay. Sorry I'm late.

510
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:04,200
I was trying to get out
of bed and I fell out

511
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,070
and needed to get help.

512
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,533
- Oh, oh I'm sorry.

513
00:28:07,617 --> 00:28:09,597
- I should have been more careful.

514
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:12,347
(phone vibrates)

515
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,973
Hello?

516
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
I'll be right there.

517
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,577
- Is everything okay?

518
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:23,410
- Can you please take mt to the hospital?

519
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,243
- Yeah, let's go.

520
00:28:31,738 --> 00:28:33,988
- [Becky] Hello sweetheart.

521
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:37,823
- Doctor, what's going on?

522
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:43,320
- Melinda, her condition
is dropping rapidly.

523
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,238
She may only have a few more days to live.

524
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:48,315
- I'm sorry it's come to this.

525
00:28:48,315 --> 00:28:50,700
- Grandma, please take the treatment.

526
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,533
- Oh sweetheart,

527
00:29:00,229 --> 00:29:03,780
I've been in such pain for so long

528
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,290
and now it's at such a point

529
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,343
the treatment probably
wouldn't help at all.

530
00:29:10,725 --> 00:29:12,225
- Grandma, please.

531
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:18,053
- Sweetheart, sweetheart,
let God wipe away your tears.

532
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,713
- You're the only family
I have left, please.

533
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,555
- I'm not the only family you have left.

534
00:29:30,555 --> 00:29:32,333
You have the greatest Father of all.

535
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,970
- Grandma, I haven't
seen my father in years.

536
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,960
My father is, he's gone.

537
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,227
- Not that father. Your heavenly father.

538
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,920
- Jesus came to Earth to save us from sin.

539
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,400
God sent his son Jesus to Earth

540
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,330
to be the ultimate sacrifice

541
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,130
to save us from his sin

542
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:08,773
so that we could someday
sit by God in Heaven.

543
00:30:11,254 --> 00:30:12,563
- Grandma, please.

544
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:16,733
- It is well with my soul.

545
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,703
- [Daniel's Dad] How much
longer does she have?

546
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,983
- Maybe a couple of days at most.

547
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,280
- Well, I will definitely keep praying.

548
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,650
- Have you been praying?

549
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,173
- What?

550
00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:34,671
- I just, I just, I'm just trying

551
00:30:34,671 --> 00:30:35,620
to wrap my head around it Dad.

552
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,210
I've seen you following Christ
these past couple of weeks

553
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,960
and it's been amazing.

554
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,220
I just, I just don't understand.

555
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,520
- [Daniel's Dad] Son.

556
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,710
- For years, dad. For years you abused me.

557
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,230
You even hit mom a number of times.

558
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,697
If I'm being honest,
how can I forgive you?

559
00:30:55,697 --> 00:30:57,891
(Daniel cries)

560
00:30:57,891 --> 00:30:59,580
(Daniel's Dad sighs heavily)

561
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,859
- I abused you and your mom for years.

562
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:07,458
(Daniel's Dad cries)

563
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:09,375
I treated you horribly.

564
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,470
I Know that there is nothing I can say

565
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,090
or do can even show how much I'm sorry

566
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,977
but, I want you to know

567
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,223
I am so, so sorry.

568
00:31:31,618 --> 00:31:34,077
I am sorry for everything I've done.

569
00:31:34,077 --> 00:31:36,660
(music swells)

570
00:31:38,723 --> 00:31:40,700
- I've seen Christ working through you

571
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,033
these past couple of
weeks and it's amazing.

572
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:46,641
(Daniel cries)

573
00:31:48,017 --> 00:31:48,850
Thank you.

574
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:54,766
(sad music)

575
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,053
- Why God?

576
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:05,211
Why is this happening to me?

577
00:32:08,012 --> 00:32:10,595
(Melinda sobs)

578
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:28,098
- [Daniel] Melinda.

579
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:31,116
Are you okay?

580
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,303
- Thanks.

581
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,240
- [Daniel] Melinda, what's going on here?

582
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,350
- I'll tell you what's going on.

583
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,720
God decides that he wants
to take my grandma away

584
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,590
and my ability to use my legs.

585
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,883
That's what He's doing.

586
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,460
- Melinda, I know it's hard.

587
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,433
- You have no idea.

588
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,723
- You're right, but I
know one thing for sure.

589
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,843
God has a plan.

590
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,210
- Are you guys okay? What's going on?

591
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,460
- I know what's for sure.

592
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,203
God is going to take my grandma away

593
00:33:36,203 --> 00:33:38,690
and there is nothing, absolutely nothing

594
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,023
that I can do about it.

595
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,113
- You're right.

596
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,986
God is the only one that can do this

597
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,286
and you know this Melinda.

598
00:33:55,308 --> 00:33:56,758
- He put me in this position.

599
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,903
- And why do you think he did that?

600
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,893
Until we submit to God.

601
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,570
Until we do things His way

602
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,507
we will forever be wandering.

603
00:34:30,222 --> 00:34:32,889
(Melinda cries)

604
00:34:56,402 --> 00:34:57,985
- I surrender Lord.

605
00:35:01,464 --> 00:35:03,966
(Melinda cries)

606
00:35:03,966 --> 00:35:06,549
(moving music)

607
00:35:20,045 --> 00:35:22,795
(Melinda laughs)

608
00:35:30,523 --> 00:35:33,106
(music swells)

609
00:35:37,745 --> 00:35:38,745
Oh my, what?

610
00:35:42,877 --> 00:35:44,960
- Melinda you're walking.

611
00:35:47,364 --> 00:35:48,364
- Thank you.

612
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:56,219
Thank you.

613
00:35:57,784 --> 00:35:58,701
Oh my gosh.

614
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:04,173
Oh my gosh, I have to tell Jamie.

615
00:36:06,805 --> 00:36:09,505
Oh my gosh, I have to tell my Grandma.

616
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:10,422
Oh my gosh.

617
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:14,367
(running footsteps)

618
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,473
- Err, I was her ride.

619
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,720
- I don't think she wants a ride.

620
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:37,387
(uplifting music)

621
00:36:37,387 --> 00:36:38,220
- Praise Jesus.

622
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:44,380
(indistinct)

623
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,280
- Okay, Becky we need to...

624
00:36:48,194 --> 00:36:49,027
- Hi, Dr. Walter.

625
00:36:49,935 --> 00:36:52,710
(chart and pen clatter)

626
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,720
- Uh, you're standing.

627
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,553
- I am.

628
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:00,383
- Yes. That's, that's not possible.

629
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,950
- Anything's possible through Christ.

630
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:08,950
- Oh my gosh.

631
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,750
- I know. Caught me off guard, also.

632
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,470
- This can't be happening.

633
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,303
- God is good.

634
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,590
- All the time.

635
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,933
- All the time.

636
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:19,413
- God is good.

637
00:37:19,413 --> 00:37:21,610
(background chatter)
(phone vibrates)

638
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:25,620
- Oh, sorry, one sec. I got to take this.

639
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,453
- Hello?

640
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,655
- [Doctor] Ready for another miracle.

641
00:37:28,655 --> 00:37:29,488
- I'm getting another one?

642
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:30,730
- [Doctor] You're never
going to believe this,

643
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,090
but your grandma's surgery has
received the remaining funds

644
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,033
from an anonymous donor.

645
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:38,280
- What? Who paid?

646
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,400
- [Doctor] I have no clue. It
was from an anonymous donor.

647
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,452
Someone that paid your bills,

648
00:37:43,452 --> 00:37:47,011
apparently he or she just goes by J.

649
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:48,120
- J?

650
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,130
- [Doctor] J. Anyway we can
begin as early as tonight.

651
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,611
Your grandma has even
said yes to the procedure.

652
00:37:53,611 --> 00:37:56,520
She says, "God has provided the money."

653
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,353
- [Becky] Yeah.

654
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,910
- Okay. Let me come see her real quick.

655
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,100
Then I'm going to get a group of friends

656
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,360
to go to the church and pray.

657
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,080
- Hey guys, this is my father.

658
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,640
Is it okay if he joins us today?

659
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,060
- Absolutely. The more the merrier.

660
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,809
- Yeah, sent out an email
blast to the entire church.

661
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:15,410
We have a lot of people praying right now.

662
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,860
Right now is the most crucial moment.

663
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,630
- Just so it's out, I'm going
to be leaving in a minute.

664
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,850
I made a promise to my grandmother

665
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,150
that I'd be there for her.

666
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,293
- Let's pray.

667
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,130
- Let your will be done Lord.

668
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,250
- Amen.

669
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,502
- Amen.

670
00:38:31,502 --> 00:38:32,713
- Amen.

671
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,823
- Hello.

672
00:38:46,101 --> 00:38:48,851
(phone clatters)

673
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,023
- Melinda.

674
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,190
(dramatic music)

675
00:39:00,683 --> 00:39:01,650
- [Voice] But they who wait upon the Lord

676
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,560
shall renew their strength.

677
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,342
They shall mount up
with wings like eagles.

678
00:39:07,342 --> 00:39:08,700
They shall run and not be weary.

679
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,359
They shall walk and not faint.

680
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,942
(music builds)

681
00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:29,499
- You ruined my life.

682
00:39:29,499 --> 00:39:32,166
(Melinda cries)

683
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:39,013
- I'm not a mistake.

684
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,967
I'm a child of God.

685
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,567
Lord I submit to you.

686
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,693
I'm yours.

687
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:22,718
(Melinda cries)

688
00:40:22,718 --> 00:40:27,718
(rain patters)
(thunder crashes)

689
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:33,842
(music swells)

690
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,162
I told you I would be there
for you when it was time,

691
00:40:52,162 --> 00:40:56,473
but I failed.
(birds twitter)

692
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,900
I shouldn't have gone
to the church to pray.

693
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,950
I should have just come to see you first.

694
00:41:05,302 --> 00:41:06,135
I'm sorry.

695
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,760
Daniel.

696
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,593
- Melinda.

697
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,610
- Daniel, I know.

698
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,443
- What?

699
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,620
- I know how you feel about me.

700
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:30,620
- Oh, oh, I, uh. I wasn't
actually gonna bring that up.

701
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,730
- Oh, sorry, that's...

702
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,253
- You're, you're, you're fine.

703
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,243
So how'd you know?

704
00:41:44,082 --> 00:41:45,132
- My grandma told me.

705
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,132
- Your grandma told me that you liked me.

706
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:50,856
(both laugh)

707
00:41:50,856 --> 00:41:51,906
- That little snitch.

708
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:08,080
- So, who paid for the
rest of the hospital bills?

709
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,293
- We don't know.

710
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,460
I thought it was my dad
cause he has the money,

711
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,087
but it wasn't.
