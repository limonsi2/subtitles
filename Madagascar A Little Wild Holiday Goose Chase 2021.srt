00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,592
{\an8}

4
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:13,763
Huh?

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,560
{\an8}Happy Holidays,
my wild friends!

6
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,271
I hope you've been more
nice than naughty this year!

7
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,856
{\an8}
Aw, these lil' buds?

8
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:26,192
{\an8}This is the best-behaved
foursome in all of Central Park.

9
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,318
Ah!

10
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,237
Oops.

11
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,657
{\an8}C'mon, let's go. We've
got more luminaries to hang

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,701
{\an8}before the Zoo Lights
ceremony tonight.

13
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,871
Aw, that moment
when all the lights turn on
at once...

14
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,457
makes me feel like
a kid again, every time!

15
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,167
{\an8}
Me too, Carlos.

16
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,378
{\an8}Did ya hear Kate talk
about us being naughty or nice?!

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,130
Nobody panic!

18
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,965
We're not panicking, Melman.

19
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,886
Well... good!
Because I've been keeping
track of our Nice

20
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,596
and Naughty deeds all year!

21
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,389
Oh, like a chore chart?!

22
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,434
An organizational
tracking system with stickers?

23
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,811
Simple, yet efficient.
I'm impressed, Melman!

24
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,606
Thanks! And good news:
"Nice" is in the lead!

25
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,233
Hey, has anyone
seen Alex this morning?

26
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:11,196
Yeah! Woah! Wee! Woohoo!

27
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,448
Ah!

28
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,620
Ow! Oops...

29
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,374
There's another
one for the naughty column.

30
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,709
But the good deeds
are still in the lead...

31
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,169
just barely.

32
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,458
Beautiful work, Marty!

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,419
Merry Cave-mas to us!

34
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,962
Just wait for tonight!

35
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,881
That magical moment when
lights fill up the whole zoo?

36
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,759
Ah... Gotta be my favorite
holiday tradition!

37
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,846
My favorite tradition
is going to Dumpling Dan's

38
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,097
pop-up restaurant!

39
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,724
Ooh, and after dumplings?!

40
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,226
When we go to Cupcake Bea's
for Candy Cane Cupcakes!

41
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,230
The holidays
wouldn't be the same
without our annual traditions!

42
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,940
This will be the best year yet!

43
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,651
Not best enough!
Or should I say
not nice enough.

44
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,653
It wasn't
a strong year for niceness!

45
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,780
I thought
"Nice" was in the lead?

46
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,451
So did I!
But after Alex's train
fiasco this morning...

47
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,288
I double checked my work and
discovered a calculation error.

48
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,873
Nice and Naughty are tied!

49
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,002
How can I enjoy the most
wonderful time of the year now?

50
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,671
What does a sticker
chart have to do
with enjoying our traditions?

51
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:56,134
Isn't it obvious?
I can't have a good holiday
'til it's been a good year!

52
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,053
There's plenty
of time today to earn
stickers for the Nice column!

53
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:43,723
Looks like you only
need one more sticker
to put nice in the lead!

54
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,225
That's true...

55
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,143
and one more good
deed should be easy.

56
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,353
And quick!

57
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,896
Where are you going?!

58
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,148
To earn one
last sticker so I can enjoy

59
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,651
my dumpling, cupcake,
and zoo light tradition

60
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,861
in the nicest,
goodest way.

61
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,531
Ah!

62
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,244
<i>Hola,</i>Lucia! Looks like
you're in need of a good deed!

63
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,620
Here, let me help.

64
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,963
All done!
Guess I've earned this.

65
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,425
Hm... Guess I didn't
realize I was supposed to use

66
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,968
that much tape.

67
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,803
<i>Oh, Odee!</i>

68
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,306
- This is for you!
- Oh, for me?!

69
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,309
Uh... tape's a little sticky.

70
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,437
Woah!

71
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,314
So much for
earning that sticker.

72
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,317
It's okay, Melman.
It was the thought that counts.

73
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,654
C'mon, Melman,
we gotta go if we're gonna hit
all our holiday favorites!

74
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,699
Yeah, those dumplings
and cupcakes sell out fast!

75
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,784
But I haven't
done my good deed!

76
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,830
You can do one
on the way! We're heading
to the tunnels. Bye, Lucia!

77
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,041
<i>Â¡Adios!</i>

78
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,337
Maybe the chimps
need help with something.

79
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,921
Happy Holidays!

80
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,008
A special day calls
for a special toll!

81
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,719
Had a feeling
you might say that.

82
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,554
That's a beautiful tree.

83
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,849
But it seems like it might
be missing something!

84
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,853
Yeah, our tree is perfect!

85
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,856
But it could
be even more perfect!

86
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,526
This is going
straight to the top!

87
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,365
Bye!

88
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,789
Uh... That looks like
a good deed waiting to happen!

89
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,333
Need a tall friend
to lend a helping hoof?

90
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,503
- Thanks, Melman!
- No problemo!

91
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,592
Good deed done!

92
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:45,845
Ah!

93
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,889
There you go!

94
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,978
Well I gotta go!

95
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,152
I'm sorry, uh...
Happy Holidays!

96
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,591
Will ya look at that...

97
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,845
It's even more
beautiful than last year!

98
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,055
And smells even better!

99
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,808
How can anyone
smell at a time like this?

100
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,519
I know you wanted
to complete your sticker chart,

101
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:38,606
but is anything nicer than
a warm dumpling on a cold day?

102
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,734
Look! We beat the holiday lines!

103
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,194
Gotta love
a punctual celebration!

104
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,241
Huh! Looks like
I should've taken a left
at the dumpling.

105
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,785
Let's grab
our dumplings and cupcakes,

106
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,829
then we can kick
back at zoo lights.

107
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,664
Excuse me?

108
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,250
Gosh, I really don't
mean to bug ya, but...

109
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,419
can I bother ya for directions?

110
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,837
This map's confusing.

111
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,922
That's 'cause
your map's a menu.

112
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,424
Oh! How about that?

113
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,926
But! If you need
a good deed, I'm your guy.

114
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,553
Oh! Well, okay!

115
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,264
I-I-I'm lookin'
for a store, a big store

116
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:15,602
with a shmancy name and an even
shmancier holiday parade.

117
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,228
Whoa!

118
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,938
Fancy Fifth's?

119
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,940
That's the one!

120
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:25,111
Back in Canada,
the Fancy Fifth's parade
is world renowned!

121
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,240
Yeah! C'mon! Okay!

122
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,618
Well, Canada-renowned...

123
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,952
Whoa!

124
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,621
You came
all the way from Canada?

125
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,664
Are you here
with your family?

126
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,625
I'm afraid it's just me.

127
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,752
You're alone?
On the holidays?!

128
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,088
Well, yeah.
It's kind of a long story.

129
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,884
It's a good deed to
listen to long stories, right?
Consider these ears wide open!

130
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,220
Oh. Well, we were
passing over New York

131
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,972
on our way to Florida
when we got separated.

132
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,184
It was pretty cloudy
and the next thing I knew,

133
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,727
I was lost!

134
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,771
You're lost
and alone on the holidays?!

135
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,523
Yeah, I guess I am...

136
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,526
but I'd be a lot less
lost with those directions.

137
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,529
Well, then we can
do better than directions!

138
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,280
We're gonna help
find your family!

139
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,783
It'll be a little
harder than you think.

140
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,576
But if you could just
point me on my way.

141
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,830
Uh, is it an east/west kinda
thing or more of a north/south?

142
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,790
Will you excuse us a moment?

143
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:23,003
Reuniting a lost goose with
his family during the holidays?!

144
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,462
What's good-er than that?!

145
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,840
That's gotta be worth
a whole pack of stickers!

146
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,510
I guess we do
still have time before
Dan runs out of dumplings...

147
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,680
Yeah, and everyone
knows the last batch
of Candy Cane cupcakes

148
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,348
is the best batch, anyway.

149
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,100
And the Zoo Lights don't
come on until it gets dark,

150
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,352
so a little
detour should be okay.

151
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,896
That's the spirit!
We'll have plenty of
time for our traditions

152
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,691
once we help, uh,
did you catch his name?

153
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,943
Henry Herbert,
the Forty-ninth.

154
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,611
But you can call me Hank!

155
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,613
Okay, Hank.

156
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,158
What do you say we search
the city up and down
until we find your family!

157
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,744
You mean now?
Uh, ya wanna spend the day...

158
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,328
lookin for my family...
with me?

159
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,539
Yeah!
We can start at the park,

160
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,166
geese love
the Central Park pond.

161
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,376
I'm gonna
find your family, Hank.

162
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,046
'Cause nobody should
be alone on the holidays!

163
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,968
If I was
a tourist from Canada,

164
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,470
this is where I'd go, eh?

165
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,972
You betcha!

166
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,433
Open air, plenty of water, and--

167
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,476
Oh, people!

168
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,144
I love people watching!

169
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,771
New Yorkers at the holidays

170
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,148
are even more adorable
than I imagined!

171
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,778
I don't see it...

172
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,446
Did ya hear that?

173
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,741
That must be your family!
- They came back?!

174
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,534
Ugh!

175
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,495
What? It's allergies, Gina!

176
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,413
You said you couldn't hear it!

177
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,415
I never said
I couldn't hear it.

178
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,001
I said it didn't bother me.
Turns out it does.

179
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,754
Guess it's not my family.
Thanks for trying.

180
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,506
You sure are a nice bunch.

181
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,758
We are nice!
Which is why
we're not givin' up!

182
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,136
What about all
your holiday plans?
You oughta be out enjoying them.

183
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,681
Let's focus on
where those geese oughta be.

184
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:02,185
Hmm, if I were a goose,
where would I go...

185
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,897
I am a goose, and I wanna
go to the Fancy Fifth's Parade!

186
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:10,360
Then maybe your
family's at Fancy Fifth's
right now, looking for you!

187
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,736
Let's go!

188
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,493
Wow!

189
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,787
Whoops, sorry.

190
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,832
Fancy Fifth's...

191
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,959
Wow!

192
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,378
Would ya look at that!

193
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,926
- Wow!
- Wow, they're
setting up the parade!

194
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,262
<i>Wow!</i>

195
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:41,224
Oh, this window alone
is worth the trip to New York!

196
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,226
If you think
this is exciting,

197
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,020
you should see the Zoo Lights...

198
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,396
- Ooh!
- Ugh!

199
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,357
- Hey!
- Snowball fight!

200
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,401
This is so much fun!

201
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,737
Wanna know
what's even more fun?

202
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,281
Finding Hank's family!
C'mon!

203
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,041
Any luck?

204
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,167
Nothin' here!

205
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,086
This wild goose
chase is goose-less!

206
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,755
Places, everyone!

207
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,590
The parade's about to begin!

208
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,842
We roll out in five!

209
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:20,305
Nothin' better
than witnessing an efficient
and well-planned holiday event!

210
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,848
Except...

211
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,352
being in one!

212
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,773
Ho ho ho!

213
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,941
Merry Christmas!

214
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,194
Santa! Santa!

215
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,945
I was born to play Santa.

216
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,783
I went from lookin' for
the fancy parade to bein' in it?

217
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,576
Ah, I could pinch myself!

218
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,953
Please don't,
I wouldn't want you
to hurt yourself.

219
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:47,207
But if you do, let me know!
I'd be happy
to patch it up for you!

220
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,667
Any sign of your family?

221
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,127
Nope, but there's
a giant candy cane!

222
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,504
I'll get some for us!

223
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,881
Mmm-mmm-mmm,
not so fast, Hank.

224
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,467
We all want a Candy Cane,
cupcake, that is!

225
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,344
And the sooner
we find your family,

226
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,262
the sooner we'll get
a taste of ours.

227
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,306
Sorry.
I get easily distracted,

228
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,433
just ask my dad,
Hank the forty eight--

229
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,144
- Ooh, there! Look!
- What?!
Is it your dad?!

230
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,438
No,
but there's a giant dreidel!

231
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,607
And... one, two, three,
four, five elves!

232
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,985
I know you're excited,
Hank, but we're here for geese,

233
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,404
not for Santa's workshop.

234
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,406
Santa's
workshop's here too?!

235
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,658
Thank you! Ho ho ho!

236
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:22,992
Hear that?!

237
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,369
That must be--

238
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,956
Hey, Santa!
Love the new coat.

239
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,625
Ho ho ho!

240
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,002
Alex, focus...

241
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,047
I didn't know
you kids were in the parade!

242
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,008
Neither did we,
'til today!

243
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,843
How'd you spot us, Ant'ney?

244
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,219
Birds' eye view!

245
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,014
Second best holiday view
in all of New York.

246
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,516
First one's on top
of the Park Avenue Hotel.

247
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,436
Yep, you see
everything up on that roof.

248
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,524
Hm, you can see
more from the sky...

249
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,819
Oh, yeah!
Like that big ol' line
at Dumpling Dan's.

250
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,196
Bet ya see that one from space.

251
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,324
- I have a feeling we're
gonna miss our dumplings...
- Not if I can help it!

252
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,910
New plan: Alex and Marty,
go get in line for dumplings.

253
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,039
- Got it!
- Hank, Gloria,
you're with me.

254
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,498
Are we getting
the cupcakes?

255
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,375
Gloria and
I will get those after.

256
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,586
After... we try that
Santa-shaped bounce house?!

257
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,588
Nope,
we gotta do a good deed.

258
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,798
And we're gonna do it
like Santa would.

259
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,425
From the sky.

260
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,595
<i>Mike to Mary Sue.</i>

261
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,888
I'm in position.

262
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,556
This sure beats wingin' it!

263
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,767
Even my cousin Zeb
can't fly this fast!

264
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,312
Hank, look
on the horizon and see
if you can spot your family.

265
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,564
Oh, right, right!

266
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,192
Hank, look! Over there!

267
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,194
Those are definitely geese!

268
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,487
Wait, really?

269
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,697
Yeah-heh-heh!

270
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,158
Now you can spend
the holidays with your family

271
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,452
and we'll get back
to spending them with ours!

272
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,412
No, they're definitely not--

273
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,207
Here's to another
banner year of being nice!

274
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,375
Woohoo!

275
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,212
Guess I'll get
going then, to see these geese.

276
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,089
Who I'm definitely related to!

277
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,924
Thanks for everything.

278
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,468
What? This good deed?
It was a breeze!
Enjoy Florida!

279
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,096
See ya next migration!
Is that a thing that's said?

280
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,764
It is now.

281
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,892
It sure was nice to have someone
to spend the holidays with.

282
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,227
Take care!

283
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,813
Now let's get
our tails to Chinatown

284
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,191
and get this holiday
train back on track!

285
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,610
Hello, fellow do-gooders!

286
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,779
- Did we do it?
- We did it!

287
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,989
Told ya,
it always pays to be nice!

288
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,243
And patient. We're next!
It's almost dumpling time!

289
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,495
Do you think
twelve dozen dumplings

290
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,414
is enough for the holiday bash?

291
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,125
I sure hope so,
Millie, you bought every

292
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,627
last one in the restaurant.

293
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,046
Every last one?

294
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,926
There's always
next year...

295
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,971
I know stomach, I know.

296
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,932
I'm sorry, Alex.
I really thought
we could make it.

297
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:54,144
It's okay, at least
Hank found his family.
It was worth it.

298
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,439
And if we hurry, we can
still get our annual cupcakes!

299
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,983
Candy Cane
goodness here we... ugh!

300
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,151
Hank?

301
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:02,694
Oh, hi!

302
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,281
- Hey, there.
- Hank?
What's going on?!

303
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,491
I thought you'd be
halfway to Florida by now!

304
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,952
Is that a candy cane cupcake?!

305
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,370
Sure is.

306
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,831
The way you were talkin'
'em up, I had to try 'em!

307
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,168
Got there just in time too.
This was the last one!

308
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,879
Oh, you want some?

309
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,882
Huh.

310
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:27,802
Hank, where's
the family we reunited you
with in epicly nice fashion?

311
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,890
The truth is...
the birds we saw in the sky?

312
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,308
They weren't my family.

313
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,102
Oh, no,
so you're still lost?!

314
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,979
Oh, yeah,
I-I did lose my family.

315
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:42,942
But what I didn't tell ya is:
I kinda sorta flew away

316
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,027
from them first.

317
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,947
I always wanted to see
New York at the holidays.

318
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,534
But my dad always says,
"Florida's where we belong."

319
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,120
So, I don't know,
I wanted to get closer

320
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,791
to the magic, but turns out
I flew a little too close.

321
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,418
When I looked back,
all I saw was clouds.

322
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,837
Guess they didn't notice me
fall behind...

323
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,926
Your family's
not even in New York?

324
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,929
They gotta be
halfway to Boca by now.

325
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,265
Thank you
for letting us know...

326
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,310
that I didn't do the good
deed I thought I did.

327
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,729
If you'll all excuse me
for a moment...

328
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,607
So much for being good!

329
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:27,737
This very bad day's the perfect
end to a very bad year!

330
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,157
Ah, boy,
I sure messed this up...

331
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,575
I feel terrible.

332
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,577
And I made you feel terrible?

333
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,830
I guess I deserve
a naughty sticker for that.

334
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,957
I don't think
that's necessary.

335
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,584
C'mon, gang,
if we hurry, we
can still catch Zoo Lights!

336
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,295
What do you say, Hank?
Wanna join us?

337
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,384
Ah, I've overstayed my welcome.

338
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,636
But you enjoy
your holiday together.

339
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,598
- Bye!
- Nice Meeting you!

340
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,642
Happy holidays, Hank...

341
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,646
Ah!

342
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,870
Wow!

343
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,374
Just in time,
Kate hasn't turned on
the light display yet!

344
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,668
This'll brighten our holiday.

345
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,589
Uh... It's too bad
Hank couldn't join us.

346
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:31,051
Didn't we give
that goose enough
of our day already?

347
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,595
I kinda liked
having him around.

348
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,264
He reminded me how magical
New York is this time of year.

349
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:39,351
Yeah, the only thing
I like better
than the Zoo Lights

350
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,395
is watching someone watch
the Zoo Lights
for the first time!

351
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:46,107
Happy Holidays
and welcome
to the Tenth Anniversary

352
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,234
of the Central Park Zoo Lights!

353
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,279
May today be merry
and... bright!

354
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,619
Ooh.

355
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,871
<i>Wow!</i>

356
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,998
Wow!

357
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,376
The lights are brilliant!

358
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,711
I can't stop smiling.
Even when I try.

359
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,963
Look at my face,
am I still smiling?

360
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,258
You're right,
Hank would've loved this.

361
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,136
Remember how his face lit
up when he saw the parade?

362
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,886
Nobody should
be alone for the holidays.

363
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,680
This sure was glorious!

364
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,765
But were there fewer
lights than usual?

365
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,977
Hm.
Sixteen luminaries are missing!
I count 'em, bit of a habit.

366
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,896
Oh, yeah, that's cause
of those geese who came by.

367
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,857
Geese?! What did they want?

368
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,026
They asked
about some luminaries.

369
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,737
Something about needing
extra lights to look for a honk?

370
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:17,282
You'd think they have
enough honks already!
'Cause they're geese?

371
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,159
Did they say a 'honk'?
Or a 'Hank'?

372
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,370
Hard to say. They had
very thick Canadian accents!

373
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,289
That must be Hank's family!

374
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,250
They were looking for him!
Did they say
where they were headed?

375
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,670
I think they were headed
for the Central Park Pond!
Geese love that pond.

376
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,672
We gotta
head back to the city

377
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,716
and reunite Hank
with his family...

378
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,217
for real this time!

379
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,844
You think that'll
earn you a sticker?

380
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,346
Sticker, shmicker!

381
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,014
We gotta do good
for goodness' sake!

382
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:43,141
But even
if we find Hank's family,

383
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,935
- we don't know where Hank went!
- Happy holidays, kids!

384
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,937
Wish you could see the birds'
eye view of the lights!

385
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:51,024
Second best view in the city,
and it was all ours!

386
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:53,151
But the first
best view is... Ah!

387
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,653
Grab your holiday hats,
we're goin' to the top

388
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,697
of the Park Avenue Hotel!

389
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:04,537
We made it.

390
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:07,290
My holiday crew?
What are you doing?!

391
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,752
You're here!
It's a holiday miracle!

392
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:13,213
I'm sorry, Hank.
We shouldn't have left you.

393
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,381
Especially not today.

394
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,299
Aw, Melman, it's okay.

395
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:19,177
You and your friends were
the best part of my holiday!

396
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:22,305
- Really?
- It was my dream
to see New York,

397
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,932
and thanks to you,

398
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,059
I didn't have to do it alone.
'Cause like you said...

399
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,561
Nobody should be
alone on the holidays.

400
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,897
Hey, shouldn't you be
at zoo lights?

401
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:35,777
Actually, I've gotta
feeling there'll be a pretty
great light show, right here.

402
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,492
I'd recognize
that honk anywhere!

403
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,416
Mom!
Dad! Debbie! Steve!

404
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,710
I thought
you left without me!

405
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,796
Oh, I told 'em
we should keep going,
but mom and dad refused!

406
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:59,050
I told ya, Hankie,
New York's too cloudy for
geese this time of year.

407
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,428
But that wasn't gonna
stop us from findin' ya, eh?

408
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:04,889
Ooh, thank goodness
a chatty pigeon tracked us
down at Central Park!

409
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,891
Nice one, Ant'ney...

410
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:10,103
Great pond by the way.
There were people
caroling there: so cute!

411
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,440
Whether
it's Florida,
New York or Winnipeg,

412
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,942
it doesn't matter where
we spend the holidays,

413
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,653
all that matters is
we spend it together, eh?

414
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:24,242
This is so nice...
Even nicer than a cupcake.

415
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,952
Or a dumpling.

416
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,580
Or a well-organized
and perfectly timed light show.

417
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,248
It sure is...

418
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,581
The holidays really
are better together.

419
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:14,793
Yep! Together-est
is even better than Nice-est!

420
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,295
And this one's been
the best holiday yet!

421
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,882
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

422
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:22,926
I think I am...

423
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,683
Melman! You know you're
not supposed to ride that train!

424
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,893
- It's naughty!
- It's okay, Marty!

425
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,688
We've got a whole year
to make up for it!
