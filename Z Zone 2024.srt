75

Iza the flag ...


77
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
I didn't sign this shit.


78
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
I will raise it.


79
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,040

80
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,320

disciplinary measures.

00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,680
Take it, three days of cell.


87
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,280

Serve the dinner and put them to work.

Above.


96
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,040
I wanted you to eat,
Not that you will play music.


97
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
It seems that you are not hungry, right?


98
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,280
Guards, sit down.


99
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,720
The others were and put yourself in a row.


100
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,200
If you can't eat as humans,


101
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,200
You will do it as dogs.


102
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,800
What stupidity.


103
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,040
Return to your position 1030,


104
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,480
Or do you want ...


105
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,600
Life here?


106
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,400
A warning.


107
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,040
Who violates the rules twice,


108
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,560
You will receive two warnings.


109
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,160

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
With each warning,


112
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,000
The disciplinary arrests
They will be at the same time.


113
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,080
Is it clear?


114
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Well...


115
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,640
You can eat.


116
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,440
Good puppy.

The men on the left,


120
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,720
The women to the right.


121
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,760
Good. Under way.


122
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,280
It's cold.


123
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,920
Have enough firewood.


124
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,080
Understood.


125
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,040
Watch those who have been challenging
this afternoon.


126
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,400
Do not let them cause problems.


127
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,680
The authorities
They are mired in chaos.


128
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,120
This girl can be the cause.


129
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,080
Retire yourself.


130
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
Good.


131
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
Wake up!


132
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Wake up!


133
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,080
Wake up!


134
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,360
Fuck!


135
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,800
Where is?


136
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,360
Where is?


137
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,240
High!


138
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,840
Attention. In row.


139
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Enjoying the outdoors?


140
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Standing.


141
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
Come on.


142
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Standing.


143
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,120
Damn Imbécil.


144
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,160
You have ruined my bet.


145
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,240
We have three fugitives the first day.


146
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,600
It is a good start.


147
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,800
Take it to the outer cell.


148
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,320
I think you've already seen
That there are no fences.


149
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,760
If you think you can escape,
Try it.


150
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,280
The inmate Z103


151
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,880
has broken internal policy
for the failed attempt to escape.


152
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,080
Therefore,
You will all be punished.


153
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,320
For their actions you will all assume
responsibility.


154
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,840
There will be no dinner tonight.


155
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,040
Do you agree?


156
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,440
Do you agree?


157
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,160
Attentive.


158
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,960
To the right.


159
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,400
And underway.


160
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,400
One...


161
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
One...


162
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Two...


163
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,120
One...


164
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
Two...


165
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,720
Why do you tremble?


166
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,280
Triangle...


167
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
Sun...


168
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,760

169
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,680
12.


170
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,880
Good job.


171
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,040
I'm sick?


172
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,440
Am I going to die?


173
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,440
By no means.


174
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,280
You are here to save many lives.


175
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
Take.


176
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,080
We will do some tests,
that's all.


177
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Are you OK?


178
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,040
Our tortolites have returned
of your honeymoon.


179
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,560
You look good.


180
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Discipline feels good to you.


181
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,480
Inmate 1025,


182
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,040
Iza the flag.


183
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,560
Good puppy.


184
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Ibra?


185
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,120
- That?
- What is Tsengel doing?


186
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,080
I guess you have decided
get along with tairdas.


187
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,040
- Good...
- OK.


188
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,560
Liars,

thieves, frauds,


190
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,440
drug addicts, suicides,


191
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,320
prostitutes,


192
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,800
mafia.


193
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,560
Congratulations to all young people
with talent


194
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,320
that were skilled in their trades


195
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,240
And I wish you much success
In his brilliant future.


196
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,600
Have you finished?


197
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
Yeah.


198
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,680
You no longer have anything to hide
to each other.


199
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,480
So,
I give you 30 minutes of rest.


200
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,160
You can relax,


201
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,960
Go to the bathroom,


202
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,880
Smoking a cigarette.


203
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
Foolishness.


204
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,680
Who tries to hide anything?


205
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,640
Everyone has a dark past.


206
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,880
You can't escape him.


207
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,000
Let's smoke while we have
The opportunity.


208
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Hey...


209
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,280
Everything will go well.


210
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,800
Inga Look.


211
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Listen.


212
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,800
Whatever happens,
We must remain alive.


213
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,360
If we do it well ...


214
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,640
It's not that.


215
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,600
Whatever happens,
We have to face it.


216
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,800
- Do you remember?
- Yes of course.


217
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
What do we do?


218
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,360
Whenever
They can catch us.


219
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,120
We will leave everyone behind.


220
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,920
It doesn't matter, whoever is.


221
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,320
Well, be strong.


222
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,840
Hey.


223
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,960
Do you want to get out of here?


224
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,440
We go inside.


225
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,280
Wouldn't it be better to observe
For a few days?


226
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
Hey,


227
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,720
I don't want to stay here for more days,


228
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,640
Even hours are unbearable.


229
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,280
If we are brave
We can get out of here.


230
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,640
We have to do it now.


231
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,160
The longer we stay here


232
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,440
more we will be under your control,
physically and emotionally.


233
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
That's how it is.


234
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,560
We have to escape as soon as possible.


235
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,360
We will be weaker over time.


236
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,280
If you don't join us,


237
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,320
Do not set in trouble.


238
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,160
It will be better to leave tomorrow.


239
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,680
Inga will not last long here.


240
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,160
Have you not won yourself yet?


241
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,040
Do you know what happens ...


242
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,120
At the end of the game?


243
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,920
It doesn't matter...


244
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,280
If he is king


245
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,840
or pawn,


246
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,120
If you have won or lost,


247
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,560
All the pieces go to the same box.


248
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,080
A pawn ...


249
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,480
can become queen,


250
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,240
But never in king.


251
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,760
Compare yourself.


252
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,440
Open.


253
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
Open.


254
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Seems...


255
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,840
that you have forgotten who you have been


256
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,800
And thanks to who you are here.


257
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,880
Compare yourself!


258
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,960
Son of a bitch.


259
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
Go away.


260
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,200
The prisoners are not them.


261
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,840
Eh, what are you doing?


262
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,880
There are two men in a car,


263
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,480
They have entered the basement
With the supervisor.


264
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,400
Who cares?
Duémete.


265
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,840
It separates that.


266
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,240
Who are they?


267
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,800
I don't know, Lord.


268
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,600
They have passed with identifications
of the Secret Service.


269
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,200
Tairdas comes.


270
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,280
Tairdas, tairdas.


271
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,080
Get up and dress.


272
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,040
Hurry up.


273
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
Ibra.


274
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,040
What will you do with him?


275
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,080
I'm not sure.


276
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,040
Is the mammon selling us?


277
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,160
Let's escape now.


278
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,120
Leave. Fuck.


279
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,320
I already have enough torture.


280
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,880
We should not have explained
Our plans


281
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
To that son of a bitch.


282
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,680
Come on, come on, come on!


283
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,920
Fast brings together
and continue fire immediately.


284
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
Come on.


285
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,360
Come, come!


286
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Fast!


287
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,480
Shit, shit!


288
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,320
In the truck.


289
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,280
The key is in the truck.


290
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,720
Come on, come on, come on!


291
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,200
Come, here. Come on.


292
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
Runs!


293
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
Fuck.


294
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
No!


295
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,920
What pussy is happening?


296
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,000
No idea.


297
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,720
- What is all this?
- Silence!


298
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
- Alright?
- I think so.


299
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,280
Eh, guys, look!


300
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
Is it a truck?


301
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
I think so.


302
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Come on.


303
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,480
Okay, well, wait here.


304
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,480
We will check it.


305
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Well, come on.


306
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,120
Wait.


307
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
Hurry up!


308
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
Run, run ...


309
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,400
To the camp.


310
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,720
Hurry up. Enter.


311
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Callad.


312
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
Are you OK?


313
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
I'm fine.


314
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,440
Go ahead.


315
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
For.


316
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,960
Good puppy.


317
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Get up.


318
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,720
What have you done?


319
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,720
I have broken the key of the truck.


320
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,560
Hey.


321
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,240
Go for strings.


322
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,360
What pussy is happening here?


323
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,040
What are those things?


324
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,200
I don't know much either.


325
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,920
He will know.


326
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Bastard!


327
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,840
It was an emergency level 5.


328
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,800
What is a level 5 emergency?


329
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,040
I don't know very well either.


330
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,200
In that basement, they do experiments.


331
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,160
But something has changed,


332
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,040
Now all those people ...


333
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,480
It appears frequently.


334
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,040
They brought a girl,


335
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,040
And this has happened.


336
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,120
Zombies ...


337
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,720
That...?


338
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,480
Zombies, were zombies,
Don't you understand?


339
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,800
I understand,


340
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,720
But it is difficult to process.


341
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,840
You have seen it.


342
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,880
Yes, that's why I tell you they were zombies.


343
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,160
Very good, listen,


344
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,320
Now we have to rest.


345
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
Where?


346
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,880
Enter there.


347
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
Bastard.


348
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,040
You took Tsengel to the basement.


349
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,560
Let's make shifts to monitor.


350
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,960
I will start.


351
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,120
Rest.
You are the next.


352
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,880
Hey, don't lose sight of him.


353
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,280
Tomorrow we will go to the arms warehouse.


354
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,200
You know how to use them, right?


355
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,920
It will be better that you
Forget your weapons.


356
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,760
The supervisor kept the bullets
In its safe.


357
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,560
We should check the basement.


358
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,840
Something happens there.


359
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,040
I don't know anymore.


360
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,200
I'm going to bed.


361
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,640
Well, be careful.


362
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,360
It is the worst day of my life.


363
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,280
Shouldn't you sleep?


364
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,840
I'm not well.


365
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,840
I can't believe ...


366
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,160
What is happening.


367
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,440
Me neither.


368
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,400
It's just a virus, right?


369
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,760
That means
That there should be an antidote.


370
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,880
Don't you think?


371
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,560
Don't know.


372
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,640
But we have to stay alive.


373
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,040
Can I ask you something?


374
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,080
Clear.


375
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,160
Are you kind to me
To be able to escape from here?


376
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,000
Have we escaped?


377
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,920
Don't take everything so seriously.


378
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,040
Well, if you're not tired, I'm leaving.


379
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,240
Hurry up.


380
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,280
Silence, silence, silence.


381
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,800
- Namule, are you okay?
- I'm fine.


382
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,240
We thought you had died.


383
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,720
Are you OK?


384
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,000
Are you injured?


385
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,080
We finally leave the forest.


386
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,960
Are you OK?


387
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,440
Are you okay?


388
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,160
Those ... things ...


389
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,720
- were...
- Zombies.


390
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,280
Well, let's see.


391
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,040
We don't know how long
We can stay here.


392
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,240
So we have to go
immediately.


393
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,360
Yeah.


394
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,840
Those cars may work.


395
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,800
Hey!


396
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,960
Huh, wake up.


397
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,680
Do they work?


398
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,320
It seems not.


399
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,120
But there is a car elsewhere.


400
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,680
Is there another camp?


401
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,360
How far?
Where?


402
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,720
First give me water.


403
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,480
There are several camps.


404
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,280
There is one close.


405
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,560
Now it's your turn.


406
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,360
Bold,


407
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,720
The other truck is on the road,
TRUE?


408
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,120
The key has been broken.


409
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,640
Oh Shit...


410
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,680
Will it start manually?


411
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,960
Ought.


412
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,840
Should, right?


413
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,480
Hey. Do you know where to go?


414
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,320
I also had blindfolds
When I arrived.


415
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,560
I am not sure of the way.


416
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,040
Oh...


417
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,480
Only you know the exit,


418
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,360
You will have to come with us, right?


419
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,240
Do you have more options?


420
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,480
Or you can stay here and die.


421
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,000
I will not go with him.


422
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,880
It is better to die.


423
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,120
Whatever you want...


424
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,280
Fuck,


425
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,120
He has not bitten me.


426
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,800
Let me see.


427
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,880
It has scratched you.


428
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,360
Fuck!


429
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,920
Shit...


430
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,280
And now what do we do?


431
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,280
- Bad luck.
- Eh, h.


432
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,400
- For, uncle.
- Get out!


433
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,800
Undone of him.
There is no other way.


434
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,720
Or get rid of you.


435
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,600
Hey, this time he is right.


436
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,800
- You have to do it.
- No, for, uncle. Let's wait a little.


437
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,000
What do you want to do?


438
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,040
Hey! What do you want to do?


439
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,520
The more time I stay,
More dangerous will be for us.


440
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,760
Fuck.


441
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,040
I don't know. Come on.


442
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,800
Let them and sit down.


443
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,240
If we don't go,
We will all die here.


444
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,960
- Where to?
- To the truck.


445
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,600
Listen to me.


446
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,160
Do not stop, if they catch one,
Do not try to save it.


447
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,000
Understood? Come, come on.


448
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,040
Fuck,


449
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,600
I had to go to piss.


450
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,080
Where are we going?


451
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,600
Fast. Over there.


452
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,320
Come on.


453
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,720
- Forget about him. Let him leave.
- Come on!


454
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,920
Come on, hurry up.


455
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,600
Come on.


456
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,720
Look at me.


457
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,880
You? What are you doing?


458
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,800
You have no right,


459
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,040
The girl is the only vaccine that
exists. Don't you understand?


460
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,800
What a shit.


461
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,200
- Namuun! No!
- Leave it. Come on.


462
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,400
Careful.


463
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,600
Inga, take the steering wheel.


464
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,640
Ibra!


465
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,040
Do what we have said.


466
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,840
Don't be silly, I can help you.
Over it, Ibra!


467
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,320
Ibra!


468
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Hey!


469
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,680
- Brother...!
- Go back and look for me.


470
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,240
Ibra!


471
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,280
I have done it.


472
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,360
Fumas?


473
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,840
No, thanks.
I don't feel like smoking.


474
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,400
What happened to you?


475
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,480
There was zombies in the truck ...


476
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,240
And we separate.


477
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,800
We have lost Namuun ...


478
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,720
also.


479
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,440
And now ... where are we going?


480
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,360
Don't know.


481
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,800
We do not know the way.


482
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,920
It is already obscuring.


483
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,720
What if we go to the camp?


484
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,320
Inga took the car.


485
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,080
That?


486
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,640
Because?


487
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,040
Need to save
Your own ass, right?


488
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,440
Do you realize?


489
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,840
It was obvious,


490
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,040
The brothers planned something.


491
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,120
A woman can become
In pure evil.


492
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,800
I am cold and hungry.


493
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,320
Well ... come on.


494
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,320
Yeah.


495
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,400
Depart.


496
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,160
Field calls


497
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,960
- Who is it?
- Open the door.


498
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,760
Open.


499
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,720
Do you have water?


500
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,160
Sit.


501
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,600
Have you found it?


502
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,400
That...?


503
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,560
The map,


504
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,400
You have found it.


505
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,600
There are several places like this.


506
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,320
What are you talking about?
What places?


507
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,200
Follow me.


508
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,680
I want to show you something.


509
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,000
This experiment
It started two years ago.


510
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,520
At first nobody knew
The purpose of the experiment,


511
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,840
It was just a deadly disease.


512
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,360
Some time ago,


513
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,480
Several scientists discovered


514
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,560
The virus when they were investigating


515
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,120
a certain parasite in
The human body,


516
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,760
And how those parasites
are capable of affecting


517
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,840
The behavior
human and the brain.


518
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,840
Then they performed
A broad experiment


519
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,480
To create an antidote
Against the virus.


520
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,640
Finally achieved it,


521
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,600
They created the first vaccine.


522
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,280
They keep the experiment
In our facilities.


523
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,120
The first vaccine trial
It was a success in Enkhjin.


524
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,960
They planned to experiment
The vaccine in you,


525
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,000
But they lost control of the virus.


526
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,560
It is a disease.


527
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,400
What kind?


528
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,120
It is not, they are zombies.


529
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,440
Be a zombie or not,
We lost control.


530
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,280
Enkhjin is the first
and only vaccine we had.


531
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,720
But that tairdas bastard
He has taken it.


532
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,120
Does it know everything
From the beginning?


533
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,360
I didn't tell you that I knew it, right?


534
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,480
He was even one of
The key people


535
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,640
in charge of all this,


536
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,040
He and the supervisor.


537
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,480
I have nothing to do with this.
Believe me.


538
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,240
We can't let ...


539
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,840
Have the girl.


540
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,760
Well, come on.


541
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,200
Where to?


542
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,200
To field number 2.
Tairdas must be there.


543
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,880
I stay here.


544
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,840
I will not go.


545
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,200
There is no guarantee
to stay alive if we leave.


546
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,120
But please
Call someone and bring help.


547
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,480
I beg you.


548
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,960
Be careful.


549
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,920
Field number 2.


550
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,800
Oh...


551
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,760
What change.


552
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,720
Inga is one of those women
They are pure evil.


553
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,240
At least I am not
evil like her.


554
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:33,880
Well,


555
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,960
How are you, guys?


556
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,720
I hope you are so generous


557
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,720
As to feed him
To an old friend.


558
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,080
Eat ...


559
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,680
We will follow our path.


560
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,480
And the girl?


561
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,640
He stays with me.


562
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,080
She take her.


563
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,880
Because?


564
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,160
Do you want to stay like a hero?


565
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,760
It will come with me.


566
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,280
Or none will leave here.


567
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,280
What field?


568
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,240
To field number 1?


569
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,360
Or to field number 7?


570
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,280
Oh.


571
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:00,840
That?


572
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,640
Do you want to go without me?


573
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,040
Bastor!


574
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,840
Brother...


575
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,440
Wasn't you who left us behind?


576
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,400
Sit.


577
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:39,040
It seems that you have some grudge
Towards me, little brother.


578
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,960
What's happening?


579
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,720
You are alive, right?


580
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,840
Me too.


581
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,200
It is good that you brought it.


582
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,800
Okay. Alright.


583
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,600
I let you go this time.


584
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:46,400
If you don't want, you can rot here.


585
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,080
Enter. Fast.


586
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,800
Where is Tsegts?
Tsegts?


587
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,680
Leave it. Think of you.


588
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,200
- Be still.
- What are you saying?


589
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,840
Am I human or not?


590
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,920
When I came for the first time,
Aunt yours said she would save lives.


591
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,160
So why do we leave them behind?


592
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,280
I want to save people.


593
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,400
If I'm not human,


594
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,960
Please let me out here.


595
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,600
I'm tired.


596
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,680
Inga!


597
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,600
We can save at least
A person please.


598
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,960
If we survive this,


599
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,080
What do we differentiate
of our past?


600
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,760
Are you sure?


601
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,640
I am.


602
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,760
Damn zombies.


603
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,760
Take the steering wheel.


604
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,080
I let the zombies out


605
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,920
And I gave your friend.


606
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,760
And now what?


607
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,480
What are you going to do about it?


608
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,880
Have you ever killed someone?


609
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,240
Can you do it?


610
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Shoot!


611
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,200
They are your zombies, take care of yourself.


612
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,800
Tsegts,


613
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,120
You should not trust anyone.


614
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,360
Trust yourself.


615
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,800
Idiot.


616
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,600
To the car, come on, climb to the car.


617
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,440
Come on, go up.


618
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,440
Run, come on.


619
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,680
Leave it, leave it.


620
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,800
Look for us again.


621
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,400
Namulan! Namulen, no!
Namulen, no!


622
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:16,840
Namulen, no!


623
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,640
What a shit day!


624
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:45,840
Comes back...


625
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,880
and find us!


626
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,960
- Who are you?
- It's me, it's me.


627
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,440
Relax.


628
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,600
You are alive.


629
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,840
Yes, I try to survive.


630
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,640
Well, let's try to survive together.
