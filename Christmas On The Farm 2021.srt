she doesn't trust me.

I turn out a disappointment.

Do you want me to
get you out of it?

699
00:30:15,996 --> 00:30:19,816
-What do you mean?
-I could show up in Australia.

Read the book. It's amazing.

she's really fascinating.

707

A gingerbread latte.
It's festive.

who likes festive lattes?

about Christmas

861
00:36:43,608 --> 00:36:45,708
I've met him.

-Like you...you...
-..met him.

865
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:53,028
-What?!
-Oh, it was a one-night stand.

866
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,508
-It was nothing tawdry.
-Oh, God.

867
00:36:54,608 --> 00:36:56,068
Just two people looking
for some companionship

after drinking their body weight
in Boulevardiers.

869
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:00,388
That's why he was looking at you
like the world had stopped!

870
00:37:00,488 --> 00:37:02,668
No! He was looking at me
like we'd never even met.

871
00:37:02,768 --> 00:37:04,828
Told you we did
a fabulous job on her hair.

-Oh, my stars.
-DAVID: Maybe...maybe...

873
00:37:06,328 --> 00:37:07,669
-This is really, really bad.
-Maybe it's...

874

-(BOTTLE POPS)
-..fate.

Christmas miracle.

EMMY: Hey, are you two
out of your heads?

877
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:15,349
It's a goddamn
Christmas disaster!

878
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:17,389
He can never know who I am.

879
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:20,389
Was. Am.
We are living in a web of lies.

-I'm not frazzled!
-Ow!

883
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:28,109
I have got a book to sell
and a farm to save,

884
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:30,509
and if I don't sell the book,
we don't save the farm.

885
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:32,629

-Lovely.

-Love it.
-Yes.

the rest of the fabulous farm?

Wait a second.

1031
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:01,519
Could we borrow her
for a couple of days?

1032

-VIOLET: Borrow me?
-MILES: Um...

1033
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1034
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,240
Would your parents mind if you
weren't with them for Christmas,

1035
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,400
if you were with us,
would they miss you?

1036
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,560
Lady, I'm number four
of nine kids.

1037
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,400
No-one would even notice
I'm gone.

1038
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,840
-Yes!
-I'll give her parents a call.

1039
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,440
EMMY: Great. It's settled then.
Listen.

1040
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:23,200
Sweetie, all you're gonna have
to do is play make-believe.

1041
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,480
Pretend that
I'm your Australian mummy

1042
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,480
and Miles here
is your step-dada!

1043
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,880
-Do you think you can do that?
-Yeah, I can do that.

1044
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,920
-Great!
-For $1,000.

1045
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,040
You're kidding?

1046
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,841
You said you could give me
anything I want.

1047
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:38,561
I can get a lot of things
I want for $1,000.

1048
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:40,561
EMMY: You are a child, right?

1049
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:42,601
Not a lawyer
with a growth deficiency?

1050
00:43:42,701 --> 00:43:44,081
I can just go home, you know.

1051
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:46,181
That's fine. You're a little...

1052
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:47,961

-550.

1055
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:53,241
Deal. How old are you, anyway?

1056
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:55,921
-I'm 10 and three quarters.
-Actually, you just turned 12.

1057
00:43:56,021 --> 00:43:58,281
Happy birthday. You're getting a
wildly inappropriate cash gift.

1058
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:00,981

You look like Oliver Twist.

a special occasion?

all our authors

1086

before we...we publish them.

1087
00:45:18,704 --> 00:45:21,884
Oh, I had to see the
Clementine magic for myself.

1088

Uh, launching a brand is, uh...

1089
00:45:24,664 --> 00:45:26,484
..it's a big commitment.

1090

goes the way we hope it does,

Wow! All from...one book.

1095
00:45:42,904 --> 00:45:44,645

in all things...you... (LAUGHS)

..that's what has me
truly intrigued.

something interesting?

1103
00:46:07,545 --> 00:46:11,145

or carbon footprints.

ELLISON: I finally finished your
'Clementine' book last night.

1880
01:19:45,768 --> 01:19:47,228
Wait. What do you mean?

1881
01:19:47,328 --> 01:19:48,748
You came all the way
to Australia

1882
01:19:48,848 --> 01:19:50,588
and you just finished the book
last night?

1883
01:19:50,688 --> 01:19:52,228
Did it ever occur to you,
Jackson,

1884
01:19:52,328 --> 01:19:55,308
that maybe I didn't come all the
way down here just for the book?

1885
01:19:55,408 --> 01:19:59,908
Maybe I also wanted to spend
some time with my son.

1886
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:03,668
The book is good.
You were right.

1887
01:20:03,768 --> 01:20:07,108

get your head out of your ass,

1888

I can only imagine
the hold she'll have

1889
01:20:09,169 --> 01:20:10,869
on the rest of the world.

1890
01:20:10,969 --> 01:20:14,229
Wait. So does that mean
you still want to buy the book?

1891
01:20:14,329 --> 01:20:16,429
Yes.

1892
01:20:16,529 --> 01:20:18,189
As for you two...

1893
01:20:18,289 --> 01:20:20,349
Uh-oh.

1894
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:22,569
You were a couple
this whole time?

1895
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:25,949
Why, yes, ma'am.

1896
01:20:26,049 --> 01:20:30,689
And you don't really talk
like Crocodile Dundee?

1897
01:20:31,689 --> 01:20:33,389
No. (LAUGHS)

Was that actually her
finding something hilarious?

1902
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:51,350
(LAUGHS) I think so.

1903
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:53,150
I want to be her friend.

1904
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:55,710

-Let's go.
