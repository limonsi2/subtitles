00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:57,815
Christmas is for nude beaches
and umbrella drinks.

691
00:29:57,915 --> 00:29:59,535
Yeah, well,
Ellison wants me to take

692
00:29:59,635 --> 00:30:01,055
more interest in the business.

693
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:03,215
And then when I do,
she doesn't trust me.

694
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:07,055
So, either way,
I turn out a disappointment.

-Hmm.
-Ah!

698
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:15,896
Do you want me to
get you out of it?

699
00:30:15,996 --> 00:30:19,816
-What do you mean?
-I could show up in Australia.

700
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:24,216

to Bora Bora, hmm?

701

as that sounds...

-Hmm.
-..I have to work.

704
00:30:33,236 --> 00:30:34,896
-Oh.
-Mmm.

705
00:30:34,996 --> 00:30:36,976
Read the book. It's amazing.

706
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:40,637
The author, Clementine,
she's really fascinating.

707
00:30:41,637 --> 00:30:46,037
Well, you know how much
I love to read books.

708
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,617

709
00:30:49,717 --> 00:30:51,697
Really?

710
00:30:51,797 --> 00:30:54,657
-I'm so sorry, Ms London.
-Don't apologise.

711

What is this?

715
00:31:00,397 --> 00:31:02,697
A gingerbread latte.
It's festive.

716
00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:06,337
Do I look like a person
who likes festive lattes?

Who doesn't love Christmas?

718
00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:09,457
The only good thing
about Christmas

719
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:11,097
is the uptick in book sales.

00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:42,348
What?

860
00:36:42,448 --> 00:36:43,508
-In New York.
-DAVID: What?

861
00:36:43,608 --> 00:36:45,708
I've met him.

862
00:36:45,808 --> 00:36:48,108
You 'met him' met him?

863
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,668
-Like 'met him'...
-(MILES GASPS)

864
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:51,028
-Like you...you...
-..met him.

865
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:53,028
-What?!
-Oh, it was a one-night stand.

866
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,508
-It was nothing tawdry.
-Oh, God.

867
00:36:54,608 --> 00:36:56,068
Just two people looking
for some companionship

868
00:36:56,168 --> 00:36:57,948
after drinking their body weight
in Boulevardiers.

869
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:00,388
That's why he was looking at you
like the world had stopped!

870
00:37:00,488 --> 00:37:02,668
No! He was looking at me
like we'd never even met.

871
00:37:02,768 --> 00:37:04,828
Told you we did
a fabulous job on her hair.

872
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:06,228
-Oh, my stars.
-DAVID: Maybe...maybe...

873
00:37:06,328 --> 00:37:07,669
-This is really, really bad.
-Maybe it's...

874
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:08,829
-(BOTTLE POPS)
-..fate.

875
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:10,629
MILES: It's a goddamn
Christmas miracle.

876
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,749
EMMY: Hey, are you two
out of your heads?

877
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:15,349
It's a goddamn
Christmas disaster!

878
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:17,389
He can never know who I am.

879
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:20,389
Was. Am.
We are living in a web of lies.

880
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:21,829
Guys, this is not...

881
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:23,869
He has got her frazzled.

882
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:25,709
-I'm not frazzled!
-Ow!

883
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:28,109
I have got a book to sell
and a farm to save,

884
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:30,509
and if I don't sell the book,
we don't save the farm.

885
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:32,629
So get serious about this,
fellas. Get off me!

889
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,650
Can you pass me that knife?

890
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,150
That's not a knife.

(METALLIC BLADE SINGS

-Fig Tree Fizz!
-Oh, great.

894
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,150
OK. Right. Here we go.

895
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,230
Very special concoction
right here.

896
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,710
Won't get it anywhere else
in the world. Here you go.

897
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:05,910
-Thank you.
-Lovely.

898
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,010
-Love it.
-Yes.

899
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,110
So when do we get to see
the rest of the fabulous farm?

Oh, um...

901
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,071

-Oh.
-DAVID: Dolly.

903
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:17,431
She's due any minute.

904
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:19,151
You will adore it!

905
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:23,671

witnessing the circle of life

-Quite heartbreaking, actually.

Alright, darling, if you want us
to call you Violet,

993
00:41:32,337 --> 00:41:33,517
we'll call you Violet.

-One more step...
-You're acting crazy, darling.

-Yes.

to my face a few years back.

will be so glad

with us after all!

Well, your little farmhand

1014
00:42:23,298 --> 00:42:24,998
almost blew
our entire operation.

-Operation?
-Yeah.

There some kind of spy thing
going down?

1017
00:42:29,058 --> 00:42:31,239

00:42:34,299 --> 00:42:36,439
-Remember lovely Clementine?
-Yeah.

1021
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:37,559
That's her offspring.

1022
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:40,159
Oh, sad sack New Yorker.

1023

Who called me that?
Who called me that?

1024
00:42:41,899 --> 00:42:44,199
Well, whoever it is,
she owes me cash.

1025
00:42:44,299 --> 00:42:45,439
EMMY: Yeah!

1026
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:48,519
Because country bumpkin
Wednesday Addams here

1027

now has London & London thinking
she's me...her...my daughter,

1028
00:42:52,379 --> 00:42:55,439
who should be called Emmy
and is now named Violet.

1029
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,539
You're the one who said it.

1030
00:42:58,299 --> 00:42:59,439
Wait a second.

1031
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:01,519
Could we borrow her
for a couple of days?

1032
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:03,640
-VIOLET: Borrow me?
-MILES: Um...

1033
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1034
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,240
Would your parents mind if you
weren't with them for Christmas,

1035
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,400
if you were with us,
would they miss you?

1036
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,560
Lady, I'm number four
of nine kids.

1037
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,400
No-one would even notice
I'm gone.

1038
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,840
-Yes!
-I'll give her parents a call.

1039
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,440
EMMY: Great. It's settled then.
Listen.

1040
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:23,200
Sweetie, all you're gonna have
to do is play make-believe.

1041
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,480
Pretend that
I'm your Australian mummy

1042
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,480
and Miles here
is your step-dada!

1043
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,880
-Do you think you can do that?
-Yeah, I can do that.

1044
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,920
-Great!
-For $1,000.

1045
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,040
You're kidding?

1046
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,841
You said you could give me
anything I want.

1047
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:38,561
I can get a lot of things
I want for $1,000.

1048
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:40,561
EMMY: You are a child, right?

1049
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:42,601
Not a lawyer
with a growth deficiency?

1050
00:43:42,701 --> 00:43:44,081
I can just go home, you know.

1051
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:46,181
That's fine. You're a little...

1052
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:47,961

-550.

1054

1055
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:53,241
Deal. How old are you, anyway?

1056
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:55,921
-I'm 10 and three quarters.
-Actually, you just turned 12.

1057
00:43:56,021 --> 00:43:58,281
Happy birthday. You're getting a
wildly inappropriate cash gift.

1058
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:00,981
Put the hat back on!
You look like Oliver Twist.

a special occasion?

all our authors

1086

before we...we publish them.

1087
00:45:18,704 --> 00:45:21,884
Oh, I had to see the
Clementine magic for myself.

1088

Uh, launching a brand is, uh...

1089
00:45:24,664 --> 00:45:26,484
..it's a big commitment.

Oh, uh, I'm a...brand now.

goes the way we hope it does,

1094

Wow! All from...one book.

1095
00:45:42,904 --> 00:45:44,645

in all things...you... (LAUGHS)

..that's what has me
truly intrigued.

something interesting?

1103
00:46:07,545 --> 00:46:11,145

or carbon footprints.

Wait. What do you mean?

1881
01:19:47,328 --> 01:19:48,748
You came all the way
to Australia

1882
01:19:48,848 --> 01:19:50,588
and you just finished the book
last night?

1883
01:19:50,688 --> 01:19:52,228
Did it ever occur to you,
Jackson,

1884
01:19:52,328 --> 01:19:55,308
that maybe I didn't come all the
way down here just for the book?

1885
01:19:55,408 --> 01:19:59,908
Maybe I also wanted to spend
some time with my son.

1886
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:03,668
The book is good.
You were right.

get your head out of your ass,

the hold she'll have

on the rest of the world.

1890
01:20:10,969 --> 01:20:14,229
Wait. So does that mean
you still want to buy the book?

1891
01:20:14,329 --> 01:20:16,429
Yes.

1892
01:20:16,529 --> 01:20:18,189
As for you two...

1893
01:20:18,289 --> 01:20:20,349
Uh-oh.

1894
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:22,569
You were a couple
this whole time?

1895
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:25,949
Why, yes, ma'am.

1896
01:20:26,049 --> 01:20:30,689

Was that actually her
finding something hilarious?

1902
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:51,350
(LAUGHS) I think so.

1903
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:53,150
