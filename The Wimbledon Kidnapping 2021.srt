3
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:40,448
-Nine, four, six,
two, six, five, six.

4
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:28,413
-It was a unique case.

5
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:29,965
The end of 1969.

6
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:32,896
We'd never had a kidnapping
in Britain.

7
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,206
They just didn't know
what was happening.

8
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,724
We didn't have the scientific
progress we've had today.

9
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,827
I mean, it's horrifying.

10
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:44,758
-Since she disappeared early
yesterday evening,

11
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:46,758
there have been a number
of telephone calls

12
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,413
demanding ransom money.

13
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:50,103
-I opened the door only to find

14
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:51,758
things scattered on the floor,

15
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:55,413
which had come from her handbag.

16
00:02:55,517 --> 00:02:59,310
Telephone was lying
on the floor.

17
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:04,620
The, uh, chair was...
some disarray.

18
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:08,620
And then I noticed
this machete.

19
00:03:08,724 --> 00:03:11,482
-Mr. McKay came home last night
expecting to meet his wife,

20
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:13,413
who should have been indoors.

21
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:16,034
The doors were open,
wife wasn't there.

22
00:03:16,137 --> 00:03:18,310
We're treating this
as an abduction.

23
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:21,275
-The police did not know
what to do.

24
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:23,965
No police force had ever dealt
with a kidnapping case.

25
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:27,344
Not only was that,
but there was no Mrs. McKay.

26
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:30,724
There was no evidence
that she was dead or alive.

27
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:35,103
-This woman is this is
Mrs. McKay.

28
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:38,103
She was wearing a medium green
knitted suit,

29
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:40,413
just below the knee.

30
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:42,551
Probably wearing
low-heeled shoes.

31
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:46,000
-To us, a million pounds ransom
is just incredible anyway.

32
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:48,758
My mother hasn't any enemies.

33
00:03:52,655 --> 00:03:55,482
-And I would say this to whoever
has got my mother-in-law:

34
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:57,310
he's not going
to crack this family.

35
00:03:57,413 --> 00:04:02,827
We've got plenty of...
reserves yet.

36
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:04,517
-My heart went out to them.

37
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,068
How can you suddenly lose

38
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:09,310
a mother and a wife
just like that?

39
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:25,172
-We're looking back
to a different time.

40
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:34,310
-My mother, she met my father

41
00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:37,724
when she was still
probably a schoolgirl.

42
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:41,137
They were engaged at 18
and married at 21,

43
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:44,103
which is what you did
in those days, I think.

44
00:04:44,206 --> 00:04:48,620
Then I was born when she was 23.

45
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:51,758
And my mother won
an art scholarship

46
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:54,206
and somebody must have
dissuaded her from that.

47
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,655
You know, "Oh, you don't want to
do that.

48
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:57,344
You're not going
to be an artist.

49
00:04:57,448 --> 00:04:58,724
You're going to be a mother,
you know,

50
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:00,206
and have lots of babies."

51
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:07,551
The Murdochs were from Adelaide,

52
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:10,344
my father --
first job in newspapers,

53
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:14,862
was working for
Rupert Murdoch's father

54
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:16,137
with South Australian people,

55
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:18,172
which tend to think
of themselves

56
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:21,689
as a bit sort of special.

57
00:05:21,793 --> 00:05:25,862
Not the same
as the other ones.

58
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:28,689
Nice memories.
We had some lovely times.

59
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:35,241
-"The Daily Mirror" from London
offered my father a big job,

60
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:38,724
a directorship,
and it really uprooted us.

61
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:41,689
I mean, to take away 16 year old

62
00:05:41,793 --> 00:05:44,931
from all their friends.

63
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:48,172
But my father just took us
all away, that was it.

64
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:52,068
We were scooped up
and dumped in London.

65
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:53,482
I would have had
a very different life

66
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,344
had we stayed there.

67
00:05:56,448 --> 00:06:00,448
My father then moved on
to be with Rupert.

68
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,103
-We moved into that house
in 1958.

69
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:10,206
It was a happy place to be.

70
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,448
It was absolute heaven in the
summer when the tennis was on.

71
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:15,724
-The first day of Wimbledon
fortnight.

72
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:17,517
The favorite spot
for the fashion parade

73
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,137
is just outside
the center court.

74
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:22,206
-Everybody came and parked,
you know, tried.

75
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,689
-...celebrities too --
there's Mrs. Chris Madden,

76
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:26,275
the wife
of the number-four seed.

77
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:32,275
-They were very
Victorian parents.

78
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:34,034
And they all got married
too young

79
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:37,379
because it was one acceptable
way of leaving home.

80
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:41,379
And that's what happened to me.

81
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:45,620
We had a nice life, but somebody
came along and jumped on that.

82
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,137
-It's 1969.

83
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:57,793
My parents have been
staying with us

84
00:06:57,896 --> 00:07:01,034
for two nights over Christmas.

85
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,000
-Then they'd gone back
to London.

86
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:10,275
My father had work to do.

87
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:18,068
-...with the market
report for farmers.

88
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,517
So until then,

89
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,758
ladies and gentlemen,
goodnight to you all.

90
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:25,275
Good night.

91
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:29,827
-The phone rang.

92
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:33,482
That was my father, and he said,
"Your mother's gone."

93
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:38,068
And we froze, and he said,
"I don't know,

94
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:39,827
maybe there's been
another burglary."

95
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:41,655
There had been a burglary
a few months earlier

96
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:44,310
and she was pretty
freaked out by that.

97
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:48,482
-I was the night duty CO
of the area.

98
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:55,724
And when I got there, I saw
damage to the inside porch door.

99
00:07:55,827 --> 00:07:59,172
There were also senior members
of the Fleet Street press

100
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:01,103
who were friendly
with Mr McKay,

101
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:03,172
influential men --

102
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,862
fortunately, some of them who
had access to

103
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:08,310
Number 10 Downing Street.

104
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:15,000
-The drama of the entrance hall
with the phone on the floor...

105
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,827
You know, the desk in the hall
with the knife,

106
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,275
the big bell hook,

107
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,275
the string, the twine --
all that was all there.

108
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,172
-The uniform
chief superintendent

109
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:28,551
was a little bit skeptical.

110
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:33,000
He thought that this was
a Fleet Street stunt.

111
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:37,448
Either that or Mrs. McKay
had gone of her own free will.

112
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:41,206
-It was horror!
It was a horror scene.

113
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,172
I mean, it was so obvious that
something terrible had happened,

114
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,758
it was just obvious.

115
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:47,448
And then when the police came
and they started saying,

116
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:49,413
"Oh, no, your mother,
she's run away with her lover,

117
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:51,586
she's gone to Aus--"
You don't know my mother!

118
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:53,206
I'm telling you
my mother is not --

119
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,896
this is -- something violent
has happened!

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,448
And the door was broken --
come on, you know?

121
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:02,206
They were -- I'm sorry,
I don't have a lot of respect

122
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,413
for the police.

123
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:07,931
We expected
some sort of telephone call

124
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:11,793
because telephone disk,
with the number on it,

125
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:15,620
had been removed and was gone.

126
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:18,103
I sat by that phone all night.

127
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:29,931
'Course, we didn't have
anything to record with.

128
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:34,551
-We were somewhat
unprofessional in those days.

129
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:36,068
I managed to get the extension

130
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:39,137
and overheard
the initial contact.

131
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:41,965
This is a transcript
of the notes I made.

132
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:47,206
"This is Mafia Group 3.

133
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,172
We are from America.
Mafia M3."

134
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:52,758
"We tried to get
Rupert Murdoch's wife.

135
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:56,655
We couldn't get her
so we took yours instead."

136
00:09:56,758 --> 00:10:00,586
"You will need a million pounds
by Wednesday."

137
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:02,827
-And it was pretty horrific.

138
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:06,137
And I said, "That man has
the accent of a foreigner.

139
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:09,068
He has an accent
of the Caribbean, I think."

140
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:25,172
-It was really
a very extraordinary case.

141
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:30,965
Which became
a major issue publicly.

142
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:36,344
And it was a case
which had an impact

143
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:39,896
on the relationship
of West Indians in London

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,034
to other people as well.

145
00:10:42,137 --> 00:10:44,689
Some people saw it
as a deliberate attempt

146
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:46,517
to frame West Indians

147
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,758
for the kidnapping
of an Australian white woman.

148
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,206
-Already their coming has
caused a national controversy.

149
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,620
But one point must always
be borne in mind:

150
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,103
Whatever our feelings,
we cannot deny them entry,

151
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:35,620
for all our British citizens

152
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:37,724
are entitled to
the identical rights

153
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:39,758
of any member of the Empire.

154
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:44,034
-We will fight you back
with every bone, every nerve,

155
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:47,000
every feeling, every ounce of
blood we've got!

156
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:50,724
We will have our country back!

157
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,310
-I don't think
any Black person

158
00:12:03,413 --> 00:12:06,827
who was prepared
for what they found in Britain.

159
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:11,586
Many of us had been invited,

160
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,965
actively recruited,
to come to work here.

161
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,896
-They're nothing but a scourge,

162
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,310
I would deport them tomorrow
if I had my way.

163
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:27,034
-I didn't expect us to be seen
as an alien force

164
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:29,413
that was unwanted in Britain.

165
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:12,586
-I was amazed
they were brothers,

166
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:14,655
they were so different.

167
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:17,896
Arthur did what Arthur
wanted to do,

168
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,586
and he felt that things
revolved round him.

169
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:23,034
And I had that instinct

170
00:14:23,137 --> 00:14:26,586
that there was something
peculiar going on here.

171
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:32,310
Was a most unusual man --
black mustache, glaring eyes.

172
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:36,344
Arthur, to my mind, was like
a panther ready to pounce.

173
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:44,517
Nizamodeen was a very retiring
young man --

174
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,517
pale, not very strong.

175
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,137
He'd only been in Britain
for a few months.

176
00:14:50,241 --> 00:14:53,724
He was totally dependent
on his brother, Arthur.

177
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:19,827
-It was -- it was lovely
on the farm.

178
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:25,758
We had cows,
things like that; chickens.

179
00:15:25,862 --> 00:15:27,137
It was nice.

180
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:29,000
It was big.

181
00:15:29,103 --> 00:15:30,862
It's really nice.

182
00:15:34,344 --> 00:15:38,620
Nizam -- he's my Uncle Nizam --
I love him.

183
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:44,103
I just love him, and brings back
so good memories again,

184
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:46,275
just hearing his name.

185
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,482
He was lovely.

186
00:15:48,586 --> 00:15:52,206
He played with us,
made me laugh.

187
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:18,034
Nizam, he was lovely.

188
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:23,137
He's a normal 21 year old guy.

189
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:27,655
How can he do
anything like that?

190
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:31,413
There are questions
all over this case.

191
00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:03,206
-By 1968, his newspaper empire
was flourishing

192
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,965
and Rupert Murdoch had emerged
as a powerful press baron

193
00:18:07,068 --> 00:18:10,241
now keen to seek new titles
in the old world.

194
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,517
After a ferocious
takeover battle,

195
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,448
the News of the World
was his,

196
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:23,413
and before long, London began to
notice Rupert Murdoch.

197
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:29,482
-Rupert Murdoch on his way
to his office by Rolls-Royce.

198
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:31,379
He's chubby cheeked
and open face,

199
00:18:31,482 --> 00:18:33,896
but underneath,
say those who know him,

200
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,758
he's a man of steel.

201
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:39,448
If he succeeds in gathering
the News of the Worldreins

202
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,655
into his hands,
it's likely they'll be in

203
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:44,275
for some pretty
aggressive management.

204
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,379
-Was buying into
the News of the World

205
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:51,827
your own idea, or was it
suggested from someone else?

206
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,241
-Entirely my own idea.
-And what is your motive?

207
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:56,172
-To expand
my own newspaper chain.

208
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:18,344
-Of course one enjoys
the feeling of power,

209
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,965
although...

210
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:52,793
-Rooks Farm,
it was frightening for me

211
00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:56,172
because Arthur was so vicious.

212
00:19:56,275 --> 00:20:00,172
We are to go under the table

213
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:01,862
and, um,

214
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:05,275
watch him -- him
beat up my mother.

215
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:09,655
Very lovable,
and then,

216
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:13,896
all of a sudden,
he would change into a monster,

217
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,862
and she would get beaten up.

218
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:22,344
When I was nine years old...

219
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:25,103
Yeah, that was life at home.

220
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:50,482
-My mum was in a hairdresser
shop in Hackney,

221
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:53,413
and they met because he was
working in the basement

222
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:55,103
as a tailor.

223
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:58,103
So consequently,
they got together

224
00:20:58,206 --> 00:21:00,344
and she left my dad,

225
00:21:00,448 --> 00:21:03,551
and went with this guy

226
00:21:03,655 --> 00:21:06,448
who we knew nothing about.

227
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:10,241
And that was it -- didn't see
mum for a long time.

228
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:14,620
-...get your blindfolds on
immediately, if you will,

229
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:16,689
panel, because this will give
you some idea...

230
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,896
-As soon as we heard
a car come up,

231
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,758
we knew he's coming back again,
and we were all scared.

232
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:29,344
Nizam, he was scared.

233
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:31,413
He was really scared.

234
00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:33,172
-I got a phone call at 5:30
in the morning,

235
00:22:33,275 --> 00:22:34,586
and tell me to get out of bed

236
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:37,310
and get down to Arthur Road
in Wimbledon.

237
00:22:37,413 --> 00:22:41,793
And very quickly they built up
a sort of Fleet Street

238
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:43,517
sort of siege of people.

239
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,827
-Should have seen the press --
we had vans,

240
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,275
we had television
from all over the world.

241
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:50,586
-The first thing you do when you
get involved in this is

242
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:52,758
find out
where the police drink.

243
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:56,310
Because journalists
and police lives

244
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:58,758
revolved around the pub,
largely.

245
00:22:58,862 --> 00:23:00,551
Over the months there.
I mean, I really got to know

246
00:23:00,655 --> 00:23:03,000
some of them really quite well.

247
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:07,241
And every evening I'd be in
there talking to police.

248
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,206
It emerged quite early on that

249
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,793
when Murdoch had gone off
to Australia,

250
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:14,551
he'd left his car
and his chauffeur

251
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:17,586
for Alick McKay to use.

252
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:23,034
So we put two and two together
and got four quite quickly.

253
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:24,586
-Well, he was using
Rupert's car

254
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:26,000
because Rupert said to him,

255
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:28,448
"I'm going to Australia,
look after the shop" --

256
00:23:28,551 --> 00:23:30,586
that's how it was,
it was that casual.

257
00:23:32,448 --> 00:23:33,758
-The police are the first
to admit

258
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:35,344
it's one of the most
baffling mysteries

259
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:36,655
they've ever experienced...

260
00:23:36,758 --> 00:23:37,931
-...disappeared early
yesterday evening

261
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:39,724
there have been a number
of telephone calls

262
00:23:39,827 --> 00:23:41,482
demanding ransom money.

263
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,344
-...more than 150 police are
involved in the investigation.

264
00:23:44,448 --> 00:23:48,137
But their night and day
efforts have produced nothing.

265
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:49,620
-They'd never heard
anything like that.

266
00:23:49,724 --> 00:23:52,068
They kept saying,
"This is not an English crime."

267
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:53,724
I mean,
they suspected my father.

268
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:55,310
It was so ridiculous.

269
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:03,482
-There was some amazing
competition in Fleet Street

270
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:04,931
in the '60s,

271
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:06,793
and news stories --

272
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:11,310
especially stories about crime,
stories about sex --

273
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:15,551
were the great currency
of the time.

274
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:18,551
You know, you had
a rampant Daily Express,

275
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:20,862
a rampant Daily Mirror,

276
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:24,758
the Daily Sketch --
long forgotten now;

277
00:24:24,862 --> 00:24:27,000
these popular tabloids

278
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:28,689
were being taken on

279
00:24:28,793 --> 00:24:35,034
by the Sun --itself
an aggressive news gatherer.

280
00:24:35,137 --> 00:24:41,482
So the British press galvanized
by the idea that it involved

281
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:43,551
Rupert Murdoch's deputy,

282
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:45,413
that it was that close to home.

283
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,965
-You were the intended
target for the kidnapers.

284
00:24:48,068 --> 00:24:49,862
-Yes.

285
00:24:49,965 --> 00:24:51,793
-That must be a nightmare.

286
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:55,827
-It wasn't so bad for us
as it was for Alick McKay.

287
00:24:55,931 --> 00:24:57,655
But certainly one
has to think about it.

288
00:24:57,758 --> 00:25:03,827
And it colored my time there
in Britain after that happened.

289
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:06,275
-At the time, the Sun
was literally

290
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,655
in its second month
of being under Rupert Murdoch.

291
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:13,172
So this was an amazing
turn of events to happen

292
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:15,689
within two months
of the newspaper starting.

293
00:25:15,793 --> 00:25:18,344
-Mr. Murdoch, sir?

294
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:21,517
-My father was in constant touch
with Rupert.

295
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,793
Rupert had evidently said,
"I'll be on the next plane,"

296
00:25:24,896 --> 00:25:26,275
and and my father said,

297
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:29,241
"No, you will not, you will not,
you will not."

298
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,862
Obviously, Rupert Murdoch
was terrified that,

299
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:34,827
because we thought it was
maybe the IRA or the Mafia,

300
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:37,448
or that they realizing
they had got the wrong person

301
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:39,827
would start reaching out to him
where he was,

302
00:25:39,931 --> 00:25:41,827
which is a long way away.

303
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:44,689
And so he did not come back.

304
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,551
-What about the ransom,
the million pounds?

305
00:25:52,655 --> 00:25:55,103
-Somebody doesn't know anything
about money, that's all,

306
00:25:55,206 --> 00:25:56,379
it's just -- it's just a sum,

307
00:25:56,482 --> 00:25:58,586
I would think someone
had their eye on.

308
00:25:58,689 --> 00:26:00,344
-What about the thought
that they might want

309
00:26:00,448 --> 00:26:02,586
to extort it from
from the company,

310
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:04,034
from the News of the World?

311
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:05,758
-I don't know that
the News of the World

312
00:26:05,862 --> 00:26:08,413
even got a million pounds --
it's a lot of money, isn't it?

313
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:10,068
It was always a million.
It was always a million.

314
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:12,034
"We want a million pounds."

315
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:17,310
£15-20 million in today's money.

316
00:26:17,413 --> 00:26:20,689
That's a lot of money.

317
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:22,586
-Hello?
-Hello?

318
00:26:22,689 --> 00:26:24,068
-Yeah.
-Hello, I don't know
who I'm speaking to.

319
00:26:24,172 --> 00:26:26,896
I don't recognize her voice.
-I'm M3.

320
00:26:30,413 --> 00:26:31,689
Huh?

321
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:07,896
-Electric, it was horrific,
the stress,

322
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,034
and I think it actually --

323
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:12,689
it destroyed my emotions,
I couldn't feel emotion.

324
00:27:12,793 --> 00:27:15,517
I could never cry.
I never cried.

325
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,724
It just was so awful.

326
00:27:17,827 --> 00:27:20,793
It was beyond awful.

327
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:24,275
-Nine, four, six,
two, six, five six.

328
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:25,586
Who's calling?
-Since she disappeared?

329
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:27,413
There have been a number
of telephone calls

330
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:30,275
demanding ransom money,
both to her home

331
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:31,965
and to
the News of the Worldoffices,

332
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:33,586
where her husband,
Mr, Alick McKay,

333
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:36,000
is on the board of directors.

334
00:27:36,103 --> 00:27:40,586
-We had a whole van load,
probably thousands of papers --

335
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:42,551
this is all
News of the Worldpapers --

336
00:27:42,655 --> 00:27:44,586
to try and find out
if the press had been

337
00:27:44,689 --> 00:27:47,310
particularly hard on somebody

338
00:27:47,413 --> 00:27:49,517
who was -- who ended up
being a crook

339
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,896
and who might have done
this to us.

340
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,931
You know, who has been offended
by the press?

341
00:27:57,034 --> 00:27:58,724
-I think everybody's trying
to find out from nobody else

342
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:00,551
what really was going on.

343
00:28:00,655 --> 00:28:02,241
It's a hard world to imagine,

344
00:28:02,344 --> 00:28:05,068
but you have to realize
that the police had no idea,

345
00:28:05,172 --> 00:28:06,586
I think,
how to deal with this crime.

346
00:28:06,689 --> 00:28:08,034
It was such
an extraordinary thing.

347
00:28:08,137 --> 00:28:09,827
-We're treating this
as an abduction.

348
00:28:09,931 --> 00:28:12,206
-What's the difference between
that and kidnapping, in fact?

349
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,413
-Well, abduction is
the correct term to use.

350
00:28:14,517 --> 00:28:16,689
Kidnapping is a slang for it.

351
00:28:16,793 --> 00:28:21,413
-It remained very much
a Wimbledon cop is looking into

352
00:28:21,517 --> 00:28:24,689
what was a huge story.

353
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:28,655
At times, there was element
of amateur about anything.

354
00:28:28,758 --> 00:28:31,379
The police, they decided
for some reason

355
00:28:31,482 --> 00:28:34,310
that they should have
an observation van in the road,

356
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:39,344
full of policemen looking at us,
looking at the house,

357
00:28:39,448 --> 00:28:41,034
which was pretty farcical,
I can't imagine.

358
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,344
I do remember going out
and sort of banging on the door

359
00:28:43,448 --> 00:28:44,793
and laughing
and thinking --

360
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:46,689
I mean, they didn't know
who they were looking for

361
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:49,689
and there were
no hostage negotiators.

362
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:53,965
They didn't know whether she was
alive or dead for certainly.

363
00:28:55,793 --> 00:28:57,724
-I just cannot understand

364
00:28:57,827 --> 00:29:02,206
why those holding Muriel have
not contacted me recently.

365
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,241
I appeal to you to contact me

366
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:08,931
by telephone, letter,
or telegram.

367
00:29:09,034 --> 00:29:11,344
-Should never have gone
to the press,

368
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:12,758
is all I thought by.

369
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:15,448
Getting the press
involved and the publicity,

370
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:17,862
it would make her
too hot to handle

371
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,586
to let her go.

372
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:23,482
-Bill Smith, who was a good cop
that was going places,

373
00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:25,931
but they were out
of their depth.

374
00:29:26,034 --> 00:29:29,620
This is still a time of
the Wild West in Fleet Street,

375
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:34,103
and reporters trespassed,
they bugged, they...

376
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,310
they did all sorts of things

377
00:29:36,413 --> 00:29:38,758
that would later
become to be outlawed.

378
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,793
-We had the house phone,
which was the original number

379
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:45,034
which we had to keep open
for the criminals,

380
00:29:45,137 --> 00:29:47,586
'cause they had that number.

381
00:29:47,689 --> 00:29:49,586
But unfortunately,
everyone else in the world

382
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:54,068
had that number, too,
after about 24 hours.

383
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:56,827
-It would not have been
a strange thing to have done

384
00:29:56,931 --> 00:29:59,965
at the time,
and I'm sure that the Sun

385
00:30:00,068 --> 00:30:02,241
were outraged that
the Daily Mirrordid it

386
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:05,517
for two reasons -- one, because
it was an intrusion into privacy

387
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,344
of their man, but secondly,

388
00:30:07,448 --> 00:30:08,931
because they hadn't
done it themselves.

389
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:11,275
That they had been beaten,
as it were.

390
00:30:13,482 --> 00:30:14,896
-Nine, four,
six, two, six, five six.

391
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:35,965
-We've got one day to contact,
another telephone call,

392
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,793
then nothing at all
for almost a fortnight --

393
00:30:38,896 --> 00:30:41,275
no doubt due to the publicity

394
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:44,068
that was given to the case
in every paper

395
00:30:44,172 --> 00:30:46,931
and every television
news broadcast.

396
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:49,862
And I think this delayed the
kidnapers from coming forward

397
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:53,137
on probably delayed
this case up to 14 days.

398
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:58,482
-Information was coming out,
it was coming from the police.

399
00:30:58,586 --> 00:31:00,103
The police leaked
like a sieve.

400
00:31:00,206 --> 00:31:02,241
-Some some people would drink

401
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:04,965
quite a lot
of my father's whiskey.

402
00:31:05,068 --> 00:31:08,827
The police were
very good at that.

403
00:31:08,931 --> 00:31:14,551
I can remember my father
going to fetch another crate

404
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:17,517
of Black Label -- not a bottle,
but another crate,

405
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,103
from where he kept them all.

406
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:24,034
-Nine four six two six five six.

407
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:40,068
-Yes.

408
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:45,724
-And the family trying to trace
the missing woman

409
00:31:45,827 --> 00:31:49,275
have been turning to other
methods, including spiritualism.

410
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:52,827
Mrs. McKay's son-in-law,
Mr. David Dyer, explained.

411
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:56,275
-We have a very open mind --
if we get something

412
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:58,689
that says that it's just
something that you say,

413
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,310
well, maybe.

414
00:32:00,413 --> 00:32:03,793
-We were not a family
of spiritualist at all,

415
00:32:03,896 --> 00:32:05,172
but suddenly we thought,

416
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:06,758
"Well, maybe there's
something in that.

417
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:08,034
Maybe someone can help us,

418
00:32:08,137 --> 00:32:09,758
because they're not
helping us --

419
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:12,241
the police aren't
doing anything."

420
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:14,896
I mean, I remember one man
and he came

421
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,241
and he actually said,
"I keep getting this name,

422
00:32:18,344 --> 00:32:23,344
this name,"
and he'd say, "Elsa, Elsa."

423
00:32:23,448 --> 00:32:25,758
This is really spine
chilling stuff.

424
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:45,620
-He first wants to see
if the woman was alive or dead.

425
00:32:48,482 --> 00:32:53,103
-Uh, "through my opinion,
she is still alive."

426
00:32:54,896 --> 00:32:56,413
-You'll try anything.

427
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:59,241
And he was fascinating.

428
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:06,103
He described the farmhouse
and the pond.

429
00:33:06,206 --> 00:33:10,482
So what do you make of that?

430
00:33:45,517 --> 00:33:47,206
-Nine, four,
six, two, six, five, six.

431
00:33:49,448 --> 00:33:50,689
Good morning.

432
00:33:52,724 --> 00:33:54,275
-You know who's speaking,
don't ya?

433
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,862
-M3, M3

434
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,137
-Nine, four, six --

435
00:34:07,241 --> 00:34:10,965
Nine, four, six, two, six,
five, six.

436
00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:13,448
-Uh...

437
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:16,482
-Just one sec.
-Hello?

438
00:34:16,586 --> 00:34:19,241
-Hello?

439
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,068
-My father, you know,
was a complete mess.

440
00:35:05,172 --> 00:35:07,517
Um...

441
00:35:12,448 --> 00:35:15,310
-One morning,
he was rather depressed,

442
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,965
so low, so low,

443
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:20,965
just very depressing,
had to get this over to him.

444
00:35:21,068 --> 00:35:25,965
I said, "Now, one must expect it
to be published,

445
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:28,758
and assume it will again.

446
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:31,241
Can you sort of accept this?"

447
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:33,827
And he -- he cried.
He did.

448
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,551
Eventually cried, so,
to see a man cry,

449
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:37,034
it's a terrible thing...

450
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:38,724
A man of his stature.

451
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:42,000
And in order to --

452
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:43,517
pretty sure he said, now,

453
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,310
he didn't think so,
but he couldn't accept this.

454
00:35:46,413 --> 00:35:49,241
He had to keep hoping,
keep his hopes raised,

455
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:50,931
and I said, well,
hope for the best,

456
00:35:51,034 --> 00:35:54,413
but one must expect the worst.

457
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:36,241
-Okay, I will --

458
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,310
-For me, as a child,
Arthur was a monster,

459
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,344
and I don't like calling him dad

460
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:01,241
because he never was a dad
to me in my eyes.

461
00:37:02,827 --> 00:37:05,137
I can imagine he's -- he's, uh,

462
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:09,862
capable of doing bad things.

463
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:14,310
Yeah. I mean, seeing the way
he was treating my mum...

464
00:37:22,827 --> 00:37:25,448
-Is that the M3?
-Yeah, yes.

465
00:37:25,551 --> 00:37:29,275
Well, I'm -- I'm now
on my way to a meeting.

466
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:30,551
This is being handled by --

467
00:37:30,655 --> 00:37:34,379
-That does sound like him.

468
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:36,931
It does sound like him,
like Arthur.

469
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:40,172
-You know
this morning.

470
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:44,206
And, uh...
-Just don't know what to say.

471
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,793
-My part, the instructions
I gave you,

472
00:37:46,896 --> 00:37:49,034
they were all
carried out fully.

473
00:37:49,137 --> 00:37:51,310
-That's Arthur.

474
00:37:51,413 --> 00:37:53,241
That's Arthur.

475
00:37:53,344 --> 00:37:56,068
'Cause he always used to --

476
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:59,448
to talk and catch breath --

477
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:04,965
Yeah.
As a kid, I still remember this.

478
00:38:07,517 --> 00:38:09,413
-I went to Arthur's home,

479
00:38:09,517 --> 00:38:13,482
met his wife
and met the children.

480
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:16,931
He had done fairly well
as a tailor.

481
00:38:17,034 --> 00:38:19,551
He got a decent house
near Bishop's Stortford

482
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:22,517
in south Hertfordshire,
had a wife and children.

483
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,827
He seemed to be managing
as a tailor,

484
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:28,517
and he felt he could now
be a kind of English squire.

485
00:38:46,172 --> 00:38:48,758
-It's a very rare ambition,
right?

486
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:53,758
We don't have many Black --
Black farmers in Britain.

487
00:38:55,689 --> 00:39:00,172
The ambition that Arthur had
to join the local hunt

488
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:04,344
showed that he had the very
poor understanding of Britain.

489
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,448
He -- he was, you know,
massively naive to think

490
00:39:08,551 --> 00:39:12,517
that he had a place
amongst those people.

491
00:39:16,517 --> 00:39:20,275
-In the past six days, police
have had only one positive lead:

492
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:21,620
the letter posted from
North London

493
00:39:21,724 --> 00:39:23,862
at 6:45 last Tuesday evening,

494
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:28,862
which arrived here at the family
house on Wednesday morning.

495
00:39:28,965 --> 00:39:32,827
-I remember being taken to give
a television interview.

496
00:39:32,931 --> 00:39:36,137
Please just let my mother
come back.

497
00:39:38,379 --> 00:39:41,310
And she heard that,
because she wrote that letter

498
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:44,482
and she said,
"I heard you on the television."

499
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:48,344
Sick, isn't it?
Really sick.

500
00:39:48,448 --> 00:39:50,034
"Darling, Alick,

501
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,379
I'm deteriorating in health
and spirit.

502
00:39:52,482 --> 00:39:55,379
Please cooperate.

503
00:39:55,482 --> 00:39:58,034
I'm blindfolded and cold."

504
00:39:58,137 --> 00:40:02,827
The earlier you get the money,
the quicker I may come home."

505
00:40:02,931 --> 00:40:05,103
It was so horrible to receive
those letters,

506
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:07,620
where your mother's saying,
"It's so cold,

507
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:09,344
please tell Daddy to cooperate,
the M--"

508
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:12,551
Oh, it's so horrible.
It was so painful.

509
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:20,310
-All the letters, I think,
were written at one stage,

510
00:40:20,413 --> 00:40:21,896
and they're all written
about the same time

511
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,517
because one letter came
telling us

512
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,862
to keep the police out of this.

513
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,965
And you'll know
who these people are

514
00:40:27,068 --> 00:40:29,793
because they'll use
the term "M3."

515
00:40:29,896 --> 00:40:33,000
Now, we'd been using the bloody
term M3 for weeks!

516
00:40:33,103 --> 00:40:34,965
She wouldn't have sent that.

517
00:40:35,068 --> 00:40:37,896
I mean, that was obviously
one of the first ones

518
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,862
we should have said,
"Well, they sent them

519
00:40:39,965 --> 00:40:42,241
out of order."

520
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,551
-There is the point
when something occurred,

521
00:40:52,655 --> 00:40:58,103
which seemed to be
very much a milestone.

522
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:01,206
My memory says it was around
the middle of the day,

523
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,965
at lunchtime,

524
00:41:04,068 --> 00:41:07,172
and a call came through,

525
00:41:07,275 --> 00:41:12,689
and it was a woman's
shrieking hysterically,

526
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:15,448
saying,
"She's dead, she's dead!

527
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:17,827
Mrs. McKay is dead."

528
00:41:17,931 --> 00:41:21,241
And there was noise
in the background.

529
00:41:21,344 --> 00:41:23,551
It was as though
it was Sunday lunchtime

530
00:41:23,655 --> 00:41:25,448
and there were people
in the pub, you know?

531
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:27,137
And there was a telephone
on the wall,

532
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:29,793
which is what happened
in those days.

533
00:41:29,896 --> 00:41:32,551
It sounded as though somebody
really had to

534
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:34,448
say something
to get it off their chest,

535
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:36,379
and it was just terrible.

536
00:41:36,482 --> 00:41:38,241
I don't know who it was,

537
00:41:38,344 --> 00:41:42,172
but we fancied that
it was perhaps the girlfriend

538
00:41:42,275 --> 00:41:45,793
and perhaps somebody
who was associated.

539
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:49,482
And we really believed
that she had died at that time.

540
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,379
Sorry, it's hard to talk about.

541
00:42:03,862 --> 00:42:06,379
-This M3,
did you receive the letter?

542
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,758
-Yes, we have.
Yesterday morning, first thing,

543
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,172
but there's no proof
in the letter

544
00:42:10,275 --> 00:42:11,931
that she is alive and well.

545
00:42:12,034 --> 00:42:13,551
There's noth--

546
00:42:17,724 --> 00:42:19,655
-Well, look, quite frankly,
this letter could have been

547
00:42:19,758 --> 00:42:21,275
written weeks ago --
we want to know she's alive.

548
00:42:21,379 --> 00:42:22,620
We've got the money --

549
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:23,827
Well, why the hell
should we give you money

550
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:25,620
unless we know she's alive?

551
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,137
-Yes, of course we recognized
her writing, but --

552
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:31,379
but we don't know, she might
have written that

553
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,310
three weeks ago;
she might be dead now.

554
00:42:33,413 --> 00:42:35,172
We don't know --
where was nothing to say that --

555
00:42:35,275 --> 00:42:38,586
that gave us any indication
that she's still alive.

556
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,172
That could have been
written weeks ago,

557
00:42:40,275 --> 00:42:42,448
and you may have killed her,
we don't know.

558
00:42:42,551 --> 00:42:44,379
We can't part with
a lot of money --

559
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:03,931
-There was a lot of play
acting on these telephone calls,

560
00:43:04,034 --> 00:43:06,310
but this was very necessary,
we were out to --

561
00:43:06,413 --> 00:43:09,103
to catch these --
these people.

562
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:33,931
-They're slightly weird,
those calls, aren't they?

563
00:43:34,034 --> 00:43:36,655
He had been coached,
if you like,

564
00:43:36,758 --> 00:43:39,103
by the police
to do it in a certain way.

565
00:43:39,206 --> 00:43:42,413
And it --
and that was what he was...

566
00:43:42,517 --> 00:43:44,482
He was supposed to get angry
with them, I think,

567
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:48,448
and it -- I don't think it
necessarily worked very well.

568
00:43:48,551 --> 00:43:50,827
-Well, the reason for repeating
myself was that we believe

569
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:54,551
that M3 was using a script,
and we were using a script,

570
00:43:54,655 --> 00:43:57,620
and both of us were trying
to keep to our script.

571
00:43:57,724 --> 00:44:01,275
And therefore, I was trying
to get some points over,

572
00:44:01,379 --> 00:44:03,103
and this point
I was trying to get over,

573
00:44:03,206 --> 00:44:06,586
was always this point
of proof -- we wanted proof.

574
00:44:06,689 --> 00:44:08,172
Obviously, if you're going
to leave a large amount

575
00:44:08,275 --> 00:44:10,413
of ransom money,
you must have proof.

576
00:44:10,517 --> 00:44:12,931
And it was important
that we kept up this...

577
00:44:13,034 --> 00:44:15,379
this willingness to pay,
and that we shouldn't be

578
00:44:15,482 --> 00:44:19,000
too willing to pay
or we might possibly lose them.

579
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:04,344
-The kidnapers asked that
Ian McKay delivered the ransom.

580
00:45:04,448 --> 00:45:06,793
But rather than put him
in danger,

581
00:45:06,896 --> 00:45:08,551
senior investigating officer
told me

582
00:45:08,655 --> 00:45:11,275
that I was to be Ian McKay

583
00:45:11,379 --> 00:45:14,172
and to go off in the Rolls-Royce

584
00:45:14,275 --> 00:45:17,172
with a suitcase
purporting to contain

585
00:45:17,275 --> 00:45:19,896
£1 million
in used £5 notes.

586
00:45:22,655 --> 00:45:26,586
-They asked for
£5 and 10 notes.

587
00:45:26,689 --> 00:45:28,689
What they didn't realize was

588
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:31,206
you couldn't have
a million pounds

589
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:34,689
in two suitcases, for instance.

590
00:45:34,793 --> 00:45:39,310
The weight was enormous.

591
00:45:39,413 --> 00:45:43,724
-They told us that we were to go
to particular telephone boxes

592
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:45,724
and wait for the phone to ring,

593
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:48,965
and then tell us to go
to another telephone box

594
00:45:49,068 --> 00:45:53,344
where there would be a message.

595
00:45:53,448 --> 00:45:56,551
A government laboratory
specifically made

596
00:45:56,655 --> 00:46:00,793
a tracking device to put on
the case with the money

597
00:46:00,896 --> 00:46:02,758
and on the car.

598
00:46:02,862 --> 00:46:05,275
Never worked.

599
00:46:05,379 --> 00:46:09,275
It never worked -- the thing
was absolutely useless.

600
00:46:09,379 --> 00:46:12,862
-The contact I had told me that
it's one of the biggest farces

601
00:46:12,965 --> 00:46:15,758
that he'd heard of --
they were being followed

602
00:46:15,862 --> 00:46:19,586
by something like
63 different cars.

603
00:46:19,689 --> 00:46:23,620
They're also being pursued by
three Hells Angels on motorbikes

604
00:46:23,724 --> 00:46:26,620
who are actually policemen
pretending to be Hells Angels.

605
00:46:26,724 --> 00:46:30,517
-The note that we found
in one of the telephone kiosks

606
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:33,586
told us to go
to a very rural location

607
00:46:33,689 --> 00:46:36,689
where there would be some
white flowers on a bank

608
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:40,137
where we were to put
the money and go.

609
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:45,793
Which we did.

610
00:46:54,206 --> 00:46:58,275
But it wasn't sophisticated.

611
00:47:07,482 --> 00:47:12,172
The money was dropped
and, um...

612
00:47:12,275 --> 00:47:13,724
nobody approached,

613
00:47:13,827 --> 00:47:18,827
nobody came across land,
nobody went past in a vehicle.

614
00:47:21,034 --> 00:47:25,379
The money was there for hours.

615
00:47:25,482 --> 00:47:28,413
Well, we were all
very disappointed.

616
00:47:30,689 --> 00:47:37,034
-And I can remember standing
in the windows upstairs,

617
00:47:37,137 --> 00:47:41,068
waiting to see, um...

618
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:43,620
Rupert Murdoch's car
come back

619
00:47:43,724 --> 00:47:46,482
with Bill Smith in it,

620
00:47:46,586 --> 00:47:49,724
and wondering
who else was in it.

621
00:47:49,827 --> 00:47:53,103
-And we'd all be hopeful,
and we'd be at home thinking,

622
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:55,206
"Oh, my God, this is the one,
this is the one," you know?

623
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:57,206
You can imagine pinning
all your --

624
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:03,137
pin all your emotional hopes
on that one evening,

625
00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:05,034
and came to nothing --
nothing.

626
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:21,137
-Nine, four, six,
two, six, five six.

627
00:49:49,896 --> 00:49:53,586
-Nine, four, six, two,
six, five, six.

628
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:55,344
-Hello.
-Hello.

629
00:49:58,965 --> 00:50:00,896
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

630
00:50:35,034 --> 00:50:38,551
-she wasn't allowed to go.

631
00:50:38,655 --> 00:50:42,310
And so I said, well, if you
won't let her go, I'll go.

632
00:50:42,413 --> 00:50:46,827
"No, no, no, you can't go,
and it's got to be a policeman."

633
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,965
-The apparel included
a pair of ladies boots,

634
00:50:56,068 --> 00:50:59,482
high length,
knee length boots.

635
00:50:59,586 --> 00:51:03,586
I won -- won the job,

636
00:51:03,689 --> 00:51:05,586
because I was the only one who
could get my feet

637
00:51:05,689 --> 00:51:07,275
into the boots.

638
00:51:12,827 --> 00:51:18,413
-And I can clearly remember
my sister and I in the kitchen,

639
00:51:18,517 --> 00:51:21,310
sitting perched on stools
with makeup

640
00:51:21,413 --> 00:51:24,310
and a towel around his neck
trying to make him --

641
00:51:24,413 --> 00:51:26,931
and I'm, you know,
regardless of how tragic

642
00:51:27,034 --> 00:51:30,000
and how terrible
the whole thing is,

643
00:51:30,103 --> 00:51:32,517
we were laughing --
it was --it was -- it was --

644
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:36,206
it was a moment
of clowning, you know?

645
00:51:43,862 --> 00:51:45,758
-It was hilarious,
I have to say.

646
00:51:45,862 --> 00:51:47,655
I mean, I feel guilty
about the laughter,

647
00:51:47,758 --> 00:51:49,586
but it was hilarious.

648
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,068
And of course, he didn't,
in the end --

649
00:51:52,172 --> 00:51:55,896
they sent a police woman.

650
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,448
-I had a coat, because my mother
would recognize that coat.

651
00:51:59,551 --> 00:52:01,758
And it was a sort of pink
mohair coat.

652
00:52:01,862 --> 00:52:03,344
And I mean, I thought,

653
00:52:03,448 --> 00:52:06,206
well, she'll realize
that we're trying to help her.

654
00:53:24,551 --> 00:53:26,413
-This only happens in England.

655
00:53:26,517 --> 00:53:28,448
They put the suitcases there,

656
00:53:28,551 --> 00:53:31,517
and the police all hidden round,

657
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:36,034
and then a local well-wisher
saw the two suitcases --

658
00:53:36,137 --> 00:53:38,586
a local resident --
said, "Oh, gosh,

659
00:53:38,689 --> 00:53:41,344
this is a time when bombs go off
and so forth --

660
00:53:41,448 --> 00:53:43,517
I better get
the local police in,"

661
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,620
and our police force
hiding all round the place

662
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,758
threw up their hands in despair

663
00:53:48,862 --> 00:53:51,551
that their best laid plans
went awry.

664
00:53:51,655 --> 00:53:57,344
But they did capture
the registration of the Volvo

665
00:53:57,448 --> 00:54:00,620
because it was going
round and round,

666
00:54:00,724 --> 00:54:03,758
and that led them
to Arthur and his farm.

667
00:54:03,862 --> 00:54:06,827
That's the only thing that led
them to Arthur and his farm,

668
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:11,620
despite four weeks of efforts
of trying to find the truth.

669
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:38,448
-There's now little doubt that
the police,

670
00:54:38,551 --> 00:54:41,379
after weeks of frustration in
their search for Mrs. McKay,

671
00:54:41,482 --> 00:54:43,724
are searching
in the right place.

672
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:48,655
Rooks End farm
at .

673
00:54:48,758 --> 00:54:50,137
-Sleepy hollow
was woken up

674
00:54:50,241 --> 00:54:51,965
early on this
bitterly cold morning

675
00:54:52,068 --> 00:54:54,586
by a full scale police invasion.

676
00:55:37,137 --> 00:55:41,793
-I had a phone call to say,
"Is that your mum's farm?"

677
00:55:44,413 --> 00:55:48,103
And, um, sure enough,
I rang her and it was.

678
00:55:53,482 --> 00:55:54,931
-At first light this morning,

679
00:55:55,034 --> 00:55:57,793
120 policemen
from this special mobile unit

680
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:02,034
begin an inch by inch search of
the property.

681
00:56:02,137 --> 00:56:04,586
-First of all, she thought it
was all a big mistake,

682
00:56:04,689 --> 00:56:06,965
absolutely massive mistake.

683
00:56:07,068 --> 00:56:11,103
-Then firemen began draining
three ponds and a well.

684
00:56:11,206 --> 00:56:13,482
-And obviously,
mum was just beside herself.

685
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:16,862
She didn't really know
what was going on.

686
00:56:16,965 --> 00:56:21,517
Mum went to Germany
for Christmas with the children.

687
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:24,793
She came back in January,

688
00:56:24,896 --> 00:56:28,827
and that's when
everything happened.

689
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:31,241
-More than 100 men from the
Metropolitan Police

690
00:56:31,344 --> 00:56:33,448
special squads
and the Essex Constabulary

691
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:36,379
were soon at work searching the
3.5-acre...

692
00:56:36,482 --> 00:56:40,448
-...and tomorrow, more than
100 policemen will be drafted in

693
00:56:40,551 --> 00:56:44,000
to begin an even more intense
search of the farm buildings

694
00:56:44,103 --> 00:56:46,758
and surrounding fields.

695
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:48,965
-We've had reports
there are fingerprints found

696
00:56:49,068 --> 00:56:51,413
in the farmhouse, which you've
connected to Mrs. McKay.

697
00:56:51,517 --> 00:56:53,206
Is there anything in this,
detective?

698
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,724
-No, I'm not able
to comment on this.

699
00:56:55,827 --> 00:56:58,310
-There was a report too that
a shallow grave had been found.

700
00:56:58,413 --> 00:56:59,655
Can you comment on that?

701
00:56:59,758 --> 00:57:01,379
-No shallow grave
has been found.

702
00:57:01,482 --> 00:57:04,758
-Do the police still feel that
Mrs. McKay is still alive?

703
00:57:04,862 --> 00:57:06,586
-Well, we're hoping so, yeah.

704
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,172
-Have you any evidence that
suggests she --

705
00:57:08,275 --> 00:57:11,827
-We have no evidence otherwise,
no evidence at all.

706
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:18,862
-I was in my room
and I stayed upstairs

707
00:57:18,965 --> 00:57:20,655
because I was a bit frightened.

708
00:57:20,758 --> 00:57:22,241
There were so many.

709
00:57:22,344 --> 00:57:25,413
Taking fingerprints everywhere.

710
00:57:30,896 --> 00:57:33,517
All I remember is mum
running around,

711
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,620
hosting all the people.

712
00:57:36,724 --> 00:57:40,482
But I cannot remember
seeing Arthur or Nizam.

713
00:57:44,724 --> 00:57:48,241
-They arrived here about
a quarter to seven this evening.

714
00:57:48,344 --> 00:57:51,482
In the first car,
the elder brother was

715
00:57:51,586 --> 00:57:55,758
crouched on the floor
of the back seat.

716
00:57:55,862 --> 00:57:59,103
And in the second car,
the younger Hosein was sitting

717
00:57:59,206 --> 00:58:01,206
between two detectives
in the back seat

718
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,172
with a coat over his head.

719
00:58:06,655 --> 00:58:08,620
-I think what surprised us

720
00:58:08,724 --> 00:58:12,000
when we saw the brothers
and spoke to them,

721
00:58:12,103 --> 00:58:14,344
they were unusual.

722
00:58:16,206 --> 00:58:19,275
It became evident
that they were not --

723
00:58:19,379 --> 00:58:23,448
certainly not --
professional criminals.

724
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:25,241
-The two men have stayed here

725
00:58:25,344 --> 00:58:28,379
at Kingston police headquarters
since 6:30 yesterday evening,

726
00:58:28,482 --> 00:58:30,241
according to the police,

727
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:31,586
and their questioning
has been surrounded

728
00:58:31,689 --> 00:58:34,068
by an aura of unusual secrecy.

729
00:58:34,172 --> 00:58:36,551
So far, I understand those
inquiries have not been

730
00:58:36,655 --> 00:58:38,724
very productive, and apart from
giving their names

731
00:58:38,827 --> 00:58:41,172
and some personal
background details,

732
00:58:41,275 --> 00:58:44,689
the two men have not been
able to help very much.

733
00:59:00,793 --> 00:59:03,517
-Well, Bill Smith did
the interrogation himself

734
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,344
with Joe Minus.

735
00:59:06,448 --> 00:59:12,000
It's totally...

736
00:59:12,103 --> 00:59:14,551
Unimaginable.

737
00:59:15,379 --> 00:59:18,310
I wouldn't give it
any credence whatsoever.

738
00:59:20,931 --> 00:59:24,241
-I used to say, "Let me get
to them," when they had them.

739
00:59:24,344 --> 00:59:26,206
"I'll make them tell
where my mother is."

740
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:28,206
"Oh, we do everything,"
they'd say, "we do everything,

741
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:33,034
but nothing that shows."

742
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:35,931
That's what the police
would say, Smith and Minus.

743
00:59:36,034 --> 00:59:38,724
-What did they say?

744
00:59:38,827 --> 00:59:41,931
-"We do," otherwise they were
saying, "Yes, we torture them,

745
00:59:42,034 --> 00:59:45,793
but mustn't show."

746
00:59:45,896 --> 00:59:47,482
"Get them by the balls,"
I said,

747
00:59:47,586 --> 00:59:49,137
"You let -- I'll do it."

748
00:59:49,241 --> 00:59:50,965
I mean, I really said that
to them!

749
00:59:51,068 --> 00:59:54,655
And they would say, "We do;
we we've done everything,

750
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:56,758
but they won't speak."

751
01:00:33,586 --> 01:00:35,965
-I spent a lot of time
with the brothers.

752
01:00:36,068 --> 01:00:40,413
I took them back and forth
to court from Brixton Prison,

753
01:00:40,517 --> 01:00:42,896
more than probably anybody else.

754
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,275
The van stopped in --
in the yard

755
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:50,724
at Brixton Prison.

756
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:58,586
The only time I'd seen
any of them snap.

757
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:02,862
And Nizam went for
me and Arthur.

758
01:01:05,931 --> 01:01:11,758
I think Nizamodeen was against
Arthur as much as anything else.

759
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:45,068
-The two men were charged
after being in company

760
01:01:45,172 --> 01:01:46,827
with the police
and Kingston police headquarters

761
01:01:46,931 --> 01:01:48,724
for about 72 hours.

762
01:01:48,827 --> 01:01:51,862
Charge was that,
between the 29th of December

763
01:01:51,965 --> 01:01:53,310
and the 6th of January,

764
01:01:53,413 --> 01:01:55,689
they murdered Mrs. Muriel McKay,

765
01:01:55,793 --> 01:01:57,551
and further charged

766
01:01:57,655 --> 01:02:02,758
that they demanded by menaces
£1 million from Mr. Alick McKay

767
01:02:02,862 --> 01:02:06,586
for the return of his wife.

768
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:08,172
-The common view
in the community,

769
01:02:08,275 --> 01:02:10,241
as I knew it, was,

770
01:02:10,344 --> 01:02:13,206
people thought it was --
it was utterly incredible,

771
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:17,482
and that it was more than likely
that other people,

772
01:02:17,586 --> 01:02:20,862
white seasoned criminals,
might have been involved,

773
01:02:20,965 --> 01:02:23,862
and those two were
taking the rap for that.

774
01:02:23,965 --> 01:02:27,655
So it seemed to me
such a kamikaze thing.

775
01:02:27,758 --> 01:02:30,758
And the idea that you could
pull off something --

776
01:02:30,862 --> 01:02:33,724
a heist as massive as that --

777
01:02:33,827 --> 01:02:37,275
seemed to us to be
totally airy-fairy, really.

778
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:39,689
-When the brothers
were arrested,

779
01:02:39,793 --> 01:02:42,310
a lot of thinking was,

780
01:02:42,413 --> 01:02:44,620
"Well, they must be
more than them."

781
01:02:44,724 --> 01:02:48,517
And they were members of the
family living in London --

782
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,862
of the Hosein brothers.

783
01:02:50,965 --> 01:02:52,827
One of them was a brother

784
01:02:52,931 --> 01:02:56,655
who was really investigated

785
01:02:56,758 --> 01:02:59,448
for some time.

786
01:02:59,551 --> 01:03:03,000
Adam Hosein.

787
01:03:03,103 --> 01:03:06,724
But, um,
his alibi stood up.

788
01:03:10,931 --> 01:03:13,551
-I went down there,

789
01:03:13,655 --> 01:03:16,413
it was really
a very extraordinary meeting,

790
01:03:16,517 --> 01:03:18,551
extraordinary situation,

791
01:03:18,655 --> 01:03:22,689
because the police could get
nothing out of the two men,

792
01:03:22,793 --> 01:03:24,379
and Smith said to me,

793
01:03:24,482 --> 01:03:28,862
it's as if they pulled shutters
down on their mind.

794
01:03:28,965 --> 01:03:33,103
And I decided to act for
the younger brother, Nizamodeen.

795
01:03:37,586 --> 01:03:43,344
-Mum said that she looked even
where police hadn't looked.

796
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:45,551
She was looking.

797
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,758
Hollow tree
underneath the dog's bed,

798
01:03:48,862 --> 01:03:52,758
but there was nothing, nothing
at all that gave her any inkling

799
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:55,655
that they had
actually killed her.

800
01:03:58,172 --> 01:04:03,034
-100 police officers searched
and searched and found nothing.

801
01:04:03,137 --> 01:04:06,137
Mrs. McKay could not be found.

802
01:04:08,586 --> 01:04:13,413
-I had just read
a trashy American whodunit

803
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:20,310
in which the murder victim
was fed to the pigs.

804
01:04:20,413 --> 01:04:22,551
So I said to one
of the policemen there

805
01:04:22,655 --> 01:04:24,655
about this story, et cetera.

806
01:04:24,758 --> 01:04:28,482
So the next day and there were
people sifting with sticks,

807
01:04:28,586 --> 01:04:31,586
whatever, through the pile
of slurry.

808
01:04:31,689 --> 01:04:34,275
And, "Had she been fed
to the pigs?" started.

809
01:04:34,379 --> 01:04:37,689
And just a throwaway remark
for me

810
01:04:37,793 --> 01:04:40,137
has sort of
went down in history.

811
01:04:46,068 --> 01:04:49,275
-What happened with the body,
we don't know.

812
01:04:51,379 --> 01:04:54,103
-M3...
M3.

813
01:04:54,206 --> 01:04:55,931
-This is M3 speaking again.

814
01:04:56,034 --> 01:04:59,896
-This is the M3, we've contacted
you last week.

815
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,689
-Hey, who am I talking to?

816
01:05:01,793 --> 01:05:05,620
-I wanted to get to the truth;
I wanted to hear the tapes,

817
01:05:05,724 --> 01:05:09,586
and they were happy
to play the tapes to me.

818
01:05:09,689 --> 01:05:12,103
I'm just trying
to find the truth.

819
01:05:12,206 --> 01:05:13,931
-Nine, four, six, two, six,
five, six?

820
01:05:46,793 --> 01:05:51,448
-You are aware, as a popular
newspaper editor and journalist,

821
01:05:51,551 --> 01:05:56,793
of what the audience thinks
and wants, and its prejudices.

822
01:05:56,896 --> 01:06:00,379
You play to them,
but not always consciously,

823
01:06:00,482 --> 01:06:02,965
very often unconsciously.

824
01:06:03,068 --> 01:06:07,172
Their views are your views.

825
01:06:10,793 --> 01:06:14,896
You would know that the fact
that two Caribbean men

826
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,172
have been responsible for
kidnapping and murdering

827
01:06:17,275 --> 01:06:18,758
a white woman --

828
01:06:18,862 --> 01:06:21,310
you'd know exactly

829
01:06:21,413 --> 01:06:26,068
the likely response
from your audience.

830
01:06:26,172 --> 01:06:29,379
-It was so un-British.

831
01:06:29,482 --> 01:06:32,310
Did they come into the country
to do this?

832
01:06:34,482 --> 01:06:36,172
-The judiciary also thought
it was

833
01:06:36,275 --> 01:06:37,862
an un-British kind of crime,

834
01:06:37,965 --> 01:06:41,793
and certainly the prosecution
made a lot of that too.

835
01:06:41,896 --> 01:06:46,206
The great deal was going
to depend really on

836
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:49,517
the extent to which matters
were put to the jury

837
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:52,137
that it was an unusual crime,

838
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:56,310
as foreign as the people
who committed the crime.

839
01:07:10,034 --> 01:07:14,068
-I've never been in a court
before in my life.

840
01:07:14,172 --> 01:07:18,344
Nobody said, "This is what it's
going to be like."

841
01:07:18,448 --> 01:07:23,827
So you're suddenly standing
in this daunting place.

842
01:07:27,068 --> 01:07:28,206
You feel quite overwhelmed.

843
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:29,931
I just burst into tears.

844
01:07:30,034 --> 01:07:35,137
And I could see
the two Hosein brothers there.

845
01:07:35,241 --> 01:07:36,206
They were there.

846
01:07:40,655 --> 01:07:44,724
And that is really horrific
moment, really horrific.

847
01:07:47,068 --> 01:07:49,310
The elder brother,
Arthur Hosein,

848
01:07:49,413 --> 01:07:52,965
he had specially tailored
a suit to wear

849
01:07:53,068 --> 01:07:55,413
to conduct his own defense,

850
01:07:55,517 --> 01:07:57,137
and the young one,

851
01:07:57,241 --> 01:07:58,758
all I could do was look
at the young one,

852
01:07:58,862 --> 01:08:01,034
and just think,
"You are the evil."

853
01:08:01,137 --> 01:08:02,620
He, to me, he was the evil.

854
01:08:02,724 --> 01:08:05,310
The other one was mad,

855
01:08:05,413 --> 01:08:08,068
but he was evil.

856
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:10,620
And I'd always felt that he was
the one that killed my mother

857
01:08:10,724 --> 01:08:14,620
and dispose of her body,
however -- however, he did that.

858
01:08:19,689 --> 01:08:22,000
-They plead not guilty.

859
01:08:22,103 --> 01:08:25,000
And so you have to respect that.

860
01:08:25,103 --> 01:08:27,551
Let the prosecution
prove they're guilty.

861
01:08:27,655 --> 01:08:31,310
That's the pattern of our law:
it's the prosecution's job.

862
01:08:33,655 --> 01:08:37,379
But he was very, very difficult
to see,

863
01:08:37,482 --> 01:08:41,103
100 percent evidence
as to guilt or not guilt.

864
01:08:46,275 --> 01:08:50,275
-Arthur's fingerprints
was found at the House.

865
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:56,241
The bill hook, his neighbor
found it missing from his farm

866
01:08:56,344 --> 01:08:59,448
and then identified it.

867
01:08:59,551 --> 01:09:03,103
The twine
that every farmer uses --

868
01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:06,827
there it was at the farm.

869
01:09:06,931 --> 01:09:12,620
But of course, search went on
for weeks at the farm.

870
01:09:12,724 --> 01:09:16,034
We didn't have the benefit
of what we've got now.

871
01:09:16,137 --> 01:09:19,827
No DNA;
purely on fingerprints.

872
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:26,103
There was no sign of her
at the farm, never has been.

873
01:09:26,206 --> 01:09:29,931
It was a case of,
"prove your case."

874
01:09:30,034 --> 01:09:33,896
There was nothing other
than the forensic

875
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,172
to prove it.

876
01:09:36,275 --> 01:09:39,310
-The body of evidence
that went to the court

877
01:09:39,413 --> 01:09:42,413
and that the prosecution
put to the jury

878
01:09:42,517 --> 01:09:46,379
was substantial
but inconclusive.

879
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:50,379
My recollection
within the Black community

880
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:56,379
was that they were
unable to say categorically

881
01:09:56,482 --> 01:09:58,068
that those two men

882
01:09:58,172 --> 01:10:02,206
had actually murdered
Muriel McKay,

883
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:04,068
because they had no evidence.

884
01:10:07,344 --> 01:10:12,620
-And then...

885
01:10:12,724 --> 01:10:17,068
Nizamodeen, at the Old Bailey,

886
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:19,241
made certain admissions.

887
01:10:21,655 --> 01:10:27,310
Nizamodeen admitted getting
the details of the Rolls-Royce

888
01:10:27,413 --> 01:10:31,172
that belonged to Rupert Murdoch.

889
01:10:31,275 --> 01:10:33,758
By admitting that,

890
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:38,620
he'd then involved Arthur.

891
01:10:58,413 --> 01:11:00,517
-He then admitted

892
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:05,758
his fingerprints
were on the paper flowers

893
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:09,586
put down for the drop;

894
01:11:09,689 --> 01:11:13,758
said that he'd done that because
Arthur had told him to do that.

895
01:11:13,862 --> 01:11:16,344
So Nizam turned on Arthur.

896
01:11:18,896 --> 01:11:21,758
It was devastating
for both of them.

897
01:11:24,862 --> 01:11:27,586
-Nizam was probably
so frightened,

898
01:11:27,689 --> 01:11:30,793
he was so frightened
that he probably admitted,

899
01:11:30,896 --> 01:11:33,586
when we spoke to him,
and we all spoke to him,

900
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:37,586
that he was prepared
to admit certain things.

901
01:11:37,689 --> 01:11:40,172
He was aware
of what he was doing.

902
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,931
We wanted to show that he was
pushed into something,

903
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:47,206
dominated
by somebody else.

904
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:49,413
And so Nizam made
some admissions --

905
01:11:49,517 --> 01:11:52,724
when his brother couldn't reach
him or get in touch with him.

906
01:11:55,137 --> 01:11:57,482
-It's a good defense, isn't it?

907
01:11:57,586 --> 01:11:59,206
He was a weak character,

908
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:01,379
you could see that
by looking at him.

909
01:12:01,482 --> 01:12:03,551
He was a weak character
who would do anything

910
01:12:03,655 --> 01:12:06,275
the elder brother said --
that's what I felt.

911
01:12:35,586 --> 01:12:40,275
-I don't think even mum believed
what was going on at the time.

912
01:12:40,379 --> 01:12:43,344
I don't think she believed
that it was possible

913
01:12:43,448 --> 01:12:45,137
that he would do such a thing;

914
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:47,344
if he'd done it,
she didn't know,

915
01:12:47,448 --> 01:12:49,344
and she was
backwards and forwards

916
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:51,689
to London going into court.

917
01:12:51,793 --> 01:12:56,793
And she came back one day
and she said to me,

918
01:12:56,896 --> 01:13:00,793
"What would you do
if you found something?"

919
01:13:00,896 --> 01:13:03,586
And I said,
"I don't know, Mum, what --

920
01:13:03,689 --> 01:13:05,137
what have you found," you know,

921
01:13:05,241 --> 01:13:07,206
"Have you found something
of any importance?"

922
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:09,724
Said, "No, I just wondered
what you would do?"

923
01:13:15,862 --> 01:13:18,965
There was a place where Arthur
used to hide his money

924
01:13:19,068 --> 01:13:22,275
behind the bar,

925
01:13:22,379 --> 01:13:24,793
and there was an inset
in the wall.

926
01:13:24,896 --> 01:13:29,137
-There must have been a box
or something like that.

927
01:13:30,862 --> 01:13:33,551
And she looked in --
she looked in there...

928
01:13:33,655 --> 01:13:37,241
-And she thought,
"Mm, has he left me any money?"

929
01:13:37,344 --> 01:13:40,896
And she had a look,
and she pulled out some jewelry.

930
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,172
-The police want anyone who's
been offered for sale jewelry

931
01:13:44,275 --> 01:13:47,310
by men of Indian descent
to come forward immediately

932
01:13:47,413 --> 01:13:50,379
and help them with the further
inquiries in this case.

933
01:13:52,517 --> 01:13:57,137
-She said, "And I took her
in to visit Arthur,

934
01:13:57,241 --> 01:14:00,620
and I said to him,
'You are guilty,

935
01:14:00,724 --> 01:14:04,000
because I've got something
in my bag,

936
01:14:04,103 --> 01:14:07,689
and you know what it is,
I found it behind the bar',"

937
01:14:07,793 --> 01:14:09,689
and she said to me,

938
01:14:09,793 --> 01:14:13,689
"That's the first time I've ever
seen a Black person go white."

939
01:14:13,793 --> 01:14:18,551
And she said,
"Arthur, you did do it.

940
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:20,586
You were involved."

941
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:24,448
-When mum found the jewels,

942
01:14:24,551 --> 01:14:26,379
she was scared
because I did ask her,

943
01:14:26,482 --> 01:14:28,413
why didn't you give it
to the police?

944
01:14:28,517 --> 01:14:30,241
'Cause she was scared.

945
01:14:30,344 --> 01:14:33,034
I don't know why.

946
01:14:33,137 --> 01:14:36,724
She phoned then Adam,
my other uncle,

947
01:14:36,827 --> 01:14:40,068
and Adam said,

948
01:14:40,172 --> 01:14:43,724
"Right, we're going to the
Thames and throw in the Thames."

949
01:14:43,827 --> 01:14:45,655
That's what mum told me.

950
01:14:51,689 --> 01:14:53,793
-Right, so your dad
is terribly ill.

951
01:14:53,896 --> 01:14:56,517
He would not be able to comply
with the instructions

952
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:58,655
as so you'll do it in stride.

953
01:14:58,758 --> 01:15:01,241
-Instruction is for one person
to be alone,

954
01:15:01,344 --> 01:15:02,793
one person to be alone now.

955
01:15:02,896 --> 01:15:04,862
All right?
Now, uh...

956
01:15:04,965 --> 01:15:07,275
Your mum wrote a letter
last night,

957
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:09,103
posted it a few minutes ago.

958
01:15:09,206 --> 01:15:11,620
One is to your dad.

959
01:15:11,724 --> 01:15:13,482
Well, it's one of both.

960
01:15:13,586 --> 01:15:16,482
Other is to...

961
01:15:26,275 --> 01:15:29,379
-It was very sad that the judge

962
01:15:29,482 --> 01:15:33,000
wouldn't allow voice prints
to be heard.

963
01:15:33,103 --> 01:15:35,655
I think that was a mistake.

964
01:15:35,758 --> 01:15:37,931
It may be law,
but it's not justice.

965
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:40,482
It's not getting to the bottom
of what has happened

966
01:15:40,586 --> 01:15:42,137
and why it's happened.

967
01:15:42,241 --> 01:15:45,586
All of the evidence,
all the relevant evidence,

968
01:15:45,689 --> 01:15:47,310
should be given,

969
01:15:47,413 --> 01:15:51,965
and the relevant evidence
was not given here.

970
01:15:52,068 --> 01:15:54,137
-So we're having
all the evidence --

971
01:15:54,241 --> 01:15:55,724
handwriting, fingerprints --

972
01:15:55,827 --> 01:15:57,931
reassessed by modern
forensic experts.

973
01:15:58,034 --> 01:15:59,724
If we get you to repeat
these recordings --

974
01:15:59,827 --> 01:16:01,655
-Yeah.
-Do you think that

975
01:16:01,758 --> 01:16:04,172
might help to clear your name?

976
01:16:34,758 --> 01:16:36,827
-"I am on my way to a meeting."

977
01:16:36,931 --> 01:16:40,068
-I am now on my way
to a meeting.

978
01:16:45,344 --> 01:16:50,793
-Our business handled
by intellectuals, the heads.

979
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:59,103
Now is a meeting
of the semi-intellectuals.

980
01:16:59,206 --> 01:17:02,172
-To be passed on to the third
party, the ru--

981
01:17:02,275 --> 01:17:05,551
the ruffians, we call them.

982
01:17:05,655 --> 01:17:08,413
-To be passed on to ruffians,
we call them.

983
01:17:08,517 --> 01:17:10,586
-The mark
on the cigarette packet

984
01:17:10,689 --> 01:17:12,137
is the same as a left thumb.

985
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:19,068
The mark on the newspaper
is the same as the left palm.

986
01:17:19,172 --> 01:17:23,689
-Whether she should be executed
or at what time?

987
01:17:23,793 --> 01:17:27,896
-And the mark on the letter
is the same as the left palm.

988
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,517
The ridge detail on both
the mark and the prints

989
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,931
have been made
by the same donor,

990
01:17:33,034 --> 01:17:36,965
namely Mr. Arthur Hosein,
and by nobody else.

991
01:17:37,068 --> 01:17:40,551
-I'm reasonably sure that
the GLC application,

992
01:17:40,655 --> 01:17:42,758
that Nizam wrote this.

993
01:17:42,862 --> 01:17:45,793
And he admitted writing it.

994
01:17:45,896 --> 01:17:47,413
But in general terms,

995
01:17:47,517 --> 01:17:50,586
the handwriting wasn't
conclusive in either way.

996
01:17:50,689 --> 01:17:55,862
So this is
the cigarette packet note.

997
01:17:55,965 --> 01:17:59,344
And I -- I've said that
it's inconclusive,

998
01:17:59,448 --> 01:18:01,517
I can't tell one way
or the other

999
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:04,103
whether it was written
by Arthur or not.

1000
01:18:04,206 --> 01:18:07,793
Equally, it could have been
written by another person.

1001
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:10,620
With the examples
that I've seen,

1002
01:18:10,724 --> 01:18:13,896
I'm more inclined to agree
with the defense's case.

1003
01:18:16,827 --> 01:18:20,000
-The data that we have indicate
that we're dealing

1004
01:18:20,103 --> 01:18:22,103
with an older individual,

1005
01:18:22,206 --> 01:18:23,724
older than Nizam would have been

1006
01:18:23,827 --> 01:18:26,827
at the time that the ransom
calls were made.

1007
01:18:26,931 --> 01:18:31,137
My strong feeling is that
where we're dealing with

1008
01:18:31,241 --> 01:18:34,000
more than one speaker
in the calls.

1009
01:18:34,103 --> 01:18:36,482
That means there are
three individuals involved.

1010
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:41,586
So there is, uh, one or more
unknown individuals in the mix,

1011
01:18:41,689 --> 01:18:44,517
and therefore it's quite
possible the outcome

1012
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,965
of the trial of Nizam Hosein
would have been different

1013
01:18:47,068 --> 01:18:50,448
if the jury had been able
to listen to those recordings.

1014
01:18:50,551 --> 01:18:55,413
We'll never know.

1015
01:18:55,517 --> 01:18:58,172
-Found guilty on all charges,

1016
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:00,620
Arthur was sentenced
to life imprisonment

1017
01:19:00,724 --> 01:19:05,206
plus 25 years, plus 14 years
for blackmail,

1018
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:08,448
plus 10 years
for sending threatening letters.

1019
01:19:08,551 --> 01:19:10,965
Nizam got the same,
except for 10 years less

1020
01:19:11,068 --> 01:19:12,758
on the kidnapping charge.

1021
01:19:12,862 --> 01:19:14,586
Inspector Smith and his team

1022
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:18,068
were delighted at their success
in this extraordinary case.

1023
01:19:29,793 --> 01:19:33,310
-It's not a triumph,
it's a relief.

1024
01:19:33,413 --> 01:19:35,896
But it's not...

1025
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,517
It's not success,

1026
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:41,620
because you haven't brought
my mother back alive.

1027
01:19:44,482 --> 01:19:50,551
-Alick made a comment at
the Old Bailey after the trial

1028
01:19:50,655 --> 01:19:52,620
that, "I just want to know
where she is

1029
01:19:52,724 --> 01:19:55,344
so I can put flowers
where she is."

1030
01:19:58,172 --> 01:20:00,379
If they did kill her,

1031
01:20:00,482 --> 01:20:03,551
then of course, they were --
they were evil.

1032
01:20:03,655 --> 01:20:06,758
But...

1033
01:20:06,862 --> 01:20:08,517
I don't know.

1034
01:20:12,448 --> 01:20:16,310
I don't know if Nizamodeen knows
where the body is.

1035
01:20:19,724 --> 01:20:21,931
Did Arthur do it on his own?

1036
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:24,379
Nobody knows.

1037
01:20:32,655 --> 01:20:36,827
-I've never bought the theory
that it was the two of them.

1038
01:20:36,931 --> 01:20:42,482
They were probably involved
in the plot.

1039
01:20:42,586 --> 01:20:45,275
Were the real killers
ever caught?

1040
01:20:45,379 --> 01:20:47,448
I don't think so.

1041
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:49,206
I think they were
either commissioned to do it

1042
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:50,517
or they were the middlemen

1043
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:53,275
who then commissioned
someone to do it.

1044
01:20:53,379 --> 01:20:54,931
They could have come clean,

1045
01:20:55,034 --> 01:20:56,689
they could have told
what they knew.

1046
01:20:56,793 --> 01:20:59,379
Why didn't they try and do that?

1047
01:20:59,482 --> 01:21:01,724
And the answer for me
has to be that

1048
01:21:01,827 --> 01:21:03,827
there were
other people involved.

1049
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:07,000
Far as Bill Smith
and John Minus cared,

1050
01:21:07,103 --> 01:21:08,379
that was
the end of the case,

1051
01:21:08,482 --> 01:21:10,310
they'd successfully
got arrests

1052
01:21:10,413 --> 01:21:14,379
that led to successful
convictions.

1053
01:21:14,482 --> 01:21:17,068
But a lot of the younger police
were very unconvinced

1054
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:19,000
by the whole thing.

1055
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:26,241
-The man with the loneliest job
in the world

1056
01:21:26,344 --> 01:21:28,379
works only a step
off the streets of London.

1057
01:21:28,482 --> 01:21:31,689
He's the night watchman
at Madame Tussaud's Waxwork.

1058
01:21:31,793 --> 01:21:34,275
Night plays tricks
on the eyes,

1059
01:21:34,379 --> 01:21:39,758
concerning this gallery of the
world's greatest criminals.

1060
01:21:39,862 --> 01:21:43,758
-We went to Madame Tussaud's
afterwards.

1061
01:21:43,862 --> 01:21:47,551
Arthur and Nizam were there
in Madame Tussaud's,

1062
01:21:47,655 --> 01:21:53,206
standing in front
of the pretend prison cells.

1063
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:56,896
That was
quite a shock, actually.

1064
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,482
-Looking back on it,

1065
01:21:58,586 --> 01:22:01,827
I suppose there was
a certain demonization.

1066
01:22:01,931 --> 01:22:07,655
I mean, there was unquestioned
sort of prejudice in Britain,

1067
01:22:07,758 --> 01:22:10,241
and we lived in
a very different world.

1068
01:22:10,344 --> 01:22:12,344
And the fact that they had --

1069
01:22:12,448 --> 01:22:16,103
that the people who've been
accused of this crime

1070
01:22:16,206 --> 01:22:20,655
were not white

1071
01:22:20,758 --> 01:22:23,827
probably played an element
in the public's view

1072
01:22:23,931 --> 01:22:26,448
that they got the right people,

1073
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:30,482
and probably the police view
they got the right people.

1074
01:22:30,586 --> 01:22:34,103
But it never occurred to me
that they got the right people.

1075
01:22:40,448 --> 01:22:43,448
-I had to go down to Trinidad
for a double murder

1076
01:22:43,551 --> 01:22:46,551
that I was investigating
for a British man on death row,

1077
01:22:46,655 --> 01:22:50,344
and I wanted to investigate
Adam Hosein,

1078
01:22:50,448 --> 01:22:53,793
because he was obviously
deeply involved in

1079
01:22:53,896 --> 01:22:58,482
the cartel money laundering that
was behind that double murder.

1080
01:22:58,586 --> 01:23:02,620
I wanted to talk to Adam,
and I went to his house

1081
01:23:02,724 --> 01:23:05,896
and I met this older woman
at the door

1082
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,034
who I took to be his mother,

1083
01:23:08,137 --> 01:23:11,551
and she said Adam wasn't around,
but we got into conversation

1084
01:23:11,655 --> 01:23:17,551
and somehow we got to talk
about the Muriel McKay murder.

1085
01:23:17,655 --> 01:23:20,793
She said that he was
the smart one,

1086
01:23:20,896 --> 01:23:25,103
and he was the one who got
his brothers into trouble,

1087
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:27,689
that it was Adam
who was the one behind that

1088
01:23:27,793 --> 01:23:30,000
and not the other two boys.

1089
01:23:30,103 --> 01:23:31,827
She said Adam did it.

1090
01:23:35,655 --> 01:23:37,724
I've been involved in
representing people

1091
01:23:37,827 --> 01:23:39,931
in over 400 murder cases
over the years,

1092
01:23:40,034 --> 01:23:42,344
so I've got to know people's MO
fairly well,

1093
01:23:42,448 --> 01:23:46,137
and one of the things
that clever people do

1094
01:23:46,241 --> 01:23:48,344
when they're involved
in a murder

1095
01:23:48,448 --> 01:23:51,034
is they set themselves up
with an alibi,

1096
01:23:51,137 --> 01:23:53,206
a free-willed alibi,
if you will.

1097
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:56,896
And then the other person
goes down for it.

1098
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,241
It then becomes way more
difficult for the police to say,

1099
01:24:01,344 --> 01:24:03,172
"Oh, but you were still
the mastermind behind it,"

1100
01:24:03,275 --> 01:24:05,517
because then they've got to get
someone to snitch on you,

1101
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:08,137
and that's always harder.

1102
01:24:08,241 --> 01:24:12,068
I got the impression that there
were a number of people

1103
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:14,379
involved in
the Muriel McKay case,

1104
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:18,000
and that there were
some really bad guys involved

1105
01:24:18,103 --> 01:24:21,206
who could have been
involved in London gangs,

1106
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:23,034
who you wouldn't want to cross.

1107
01:24:30,862 --> 01:24:33,758
-My father, he did deserve it.

1108
01:24:33,862 --> 01:24:35,724
Definitely.

1109
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:39,896
Not Nizam.

1110
01:24:43,275 --> 01:24:47,620
He didn't do anything,
he had to do these things

1111
01:24:47,724 --> 01:24:51,551
for Arthur,

1112
01:24:51,655 --> 01:24:55,551
because I know how he treated
him at home.

1113
01:24:55,655 --> 01:24:59,000
I know exactly how, so I can
imagine how that went.

1114
01:25:00,689 --> 01:25:03,413
We all cried...

1115
01:25:03,517 --> 01:25:07,137
Because of Nizam
going in prison for so long --

1116
01:25:07,241 --> 01:25:09,137
20 years, I think.

1117
01:25:09,241 --> 01:25:11,034
That's -- no.

1118
01:27:09,413 --> 01:27:11,517
-I do wake up
and think about her.

1119
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:15,413
You know, she is always there.

1120
01:27:18,137 --> 01:27:20,620
-Such a lovely mother
to us all.

1121
01:27:27,103 --> 01:27:32,586
-And one of the kindest people
that I've ever known.

1122
01:27:32,689 --> 01:27:35,620
And she was just delightful.

1123
01:27:40,241 --> 01:27:43,034
-I looked for my mother.

1124
01:27:43,137 --> 01:27:45,379
You know, you sort of catch
sight of someone flashing by,

1125
01:27:45,482 --> 01:27:46,931
and say, "Oh, my God, it's her!"

1126
01:27:47,034 --> 01:27:49,310
You know,
you just could not have that --

1127
01:27:49,413 --> 01:27:50,724
you could not close the door,

1128
01:27:50,827 --> 01:27:53,103
you just could not
close up on it.

1129
01:27:53,206 --> 01:27:57,137
Whatever you knew or suspected,
you never knew.

1130
01:27:57,241 --> 01:27:59,655
And it's always
that element of hope.

1131
01:28:05,517 --> 01:28:07,413
-I drove with my sister.

1132
01:28:10,862 --> 01:28:13,137
I said, "My mother could be on
the Thames,

1133
01:28:13,241 --> 01:28:14,586
she could be quite close."

1134
01:28:19,172 --> 01:28:21,586
And we drove
all along the river.

1135
01:28:21,689 --> 01:28:23,103
And I said,

1136
01:28:23,206 --> 01:28:25,482
"This is so hopeless."

1137
01:28:25,586 --> 01:28:28,862
That -- the feeling
of hopelessness.

1138
01:28:28,965 --> 01:28:30,724
Someone taken from you.

1139
01:28:33,034 --> 01:28:34,862
Well, I suppose
you always hope

1140
01:28:34,965 --> 01:28:38,379
that somebody might have
some information somewhere.

1141
01:28:38,482 --> 01:28:42,620
Maybe something comes out
of somebody's watching this.

1142
01:28:45,965 --> 01:28:48,758
And maybe they -- they do know
what happened.

1143
01:28:48,862 --> 01:28:52,172
Maybe.

1144
01:28:52,275 --> 01:28:53,965
You know, where is she?
