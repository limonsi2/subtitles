5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,266
- Hello, party people.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,233
Oh. Ernie, watch the drape.
- All right.

7
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:28,100
- I'll take those lab sponges
in five, Dr. Navarro.

8
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,233
- I'm on it.
- How's the patient, Ernie?

9
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:32,033
- Visions of sugarplums.

10
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,200
- All right, well,
a week till Christmas,

11
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,767
that seems appropriate.

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,133
Who's playing DJ today?

13
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:38,600
- 'Tis the season,
Dr. Reynolds.

14
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:40,567
I thought I was get us all
in the Christmas spirit.

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,467
- Well, it is the season
for miracles.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,867
- Good to go.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,467
- Okay. Calling all elves.
It's showtime.

18
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:57,633
- Great work in there, Doc.
Never seen it done better.

19
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,767
- Thanks, Ernie.

20
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,133
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah, you too. Good work.

21
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:02,567
- Thanks.

22
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:26,767
- There you are.

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,367
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,000
We've had quite an afternoon,
your nephew and I.

25
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,800
It was gingerbread house day.
- Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:35,934
- Whoa, cutting it close
this year, huh?

27
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:39,367
- Henrik? Come show her.
- Hey, Aunt Angie. Take a look.

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,533
- Hey, buddy.
Whoa, sweet!

29
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,667
You know what that would go
for in today's market?

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,467
- I think he should
be an architect.

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,100
- We all flew in yesterday.

32
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:50,533
So are you coming home,
or is it work again this year?

33
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:53,033
- Um, hey, how's
the adoption going?

34
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,500
- We still don't know yet.

35
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:56,667
Without a good attorney,
it's been a nightmare

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,200
these past months.

37
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,667
- Kristen,
why didn't you tell me

38
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,233
that you were
going through that?

39
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:02,567
- Maybe if you called
once in a while.

40
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,233
- That is not fair.

41
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:06,066
You know how much I'm working
at the hospital right now.

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,700
Look, there was--
I wish there was a way

43
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:08,633
that I could help you,
and I wish

44
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:10,333
I could be there
with you guys this year.

45
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:12,333
- Honey, this is
the second year in a row

46
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,367
that you haven't come home
for Christmas.

47
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,200
- Hey, Mom, I--I know.

48
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,200
but you know how complicated
things are

49
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,600
to get away from work.
- No, I don't.

50
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:22,834
But family is very important.

51
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:25,567
- I know that, Mom.
- Do you? Do you really, honey?

52
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,033
Please.

53
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,100
There is plenty of room,
there's plenty of food.

54
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:32,000
Aunt Myrt is having
her annual holiday party.

55
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:34,233
Bigger than even this time.

56
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:35,834
- I'm sorry.
I'm on call this year.

57
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:37,266
I can only get as far
as my apartment.

58
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,834
- Please,
even just for one day.

59
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:42,667
- Yes, if anything changes,
you will be the first to know.

60
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay?
Give my love to everyone.

61
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:45,400
- Love you, bye. Bye-bye!
- Bye.

62
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,667
- Bye.
- See you.

63
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,934
- Hey.

64
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:50,667
- Hey.
- No hometown Christmas?

65
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,166
I thought you cleared
your calendar.

66
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,367
- No, Richardson
has me on call,

67
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,700
which is great, you know?

68
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:58,100
I just want a quiet week
in Yonkers alone.

69
00:02:58,233 --> 00:02:59,834
- Alone?
When you could be home.

70
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,300
- Yeah, but it's not the same.

71
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:03,100
Mom's still dealing
with the divorce,

72
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:05,100
and it's so heartbreaking
watching her go through it.

73
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:07,133
- It's been a while, hasn't it?
- It has.

74
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:10,967
Dad's in Arizona, you know,
starting a new life.

75
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,500
My sister and I, we're not on
the same wavelength.

76
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:16,900
- It's hard. I get it.
Families are complicated.

77
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:19,000
Do you at least have time for
a drink before you head home?

78
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,467
A toast to the holidays?

79
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,166
- Don't have to ask me twice.

80
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,166
- Oh, my gosh,
that surgery today was...

81
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,900
Thank you.

82
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:33,300
- Well, here's
to a quiet Christmas,

83
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:34,734
if that's what you really want.

84
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:38,500
- Please, Santa,
it's all I've asked for.

85
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:39,734
Did he get your list this year?

86
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:40,967
- Mm.

87
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,133
Who's had time
to think about it?

88
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,500
I'll take my chances.

89
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:47,667
Although, I wouldn't mind
finding him under my tree.

90
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,433
- Tyler?
- Tyler Grant.

91
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:51,734
Sports commentator on TV.

92
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:53,233
- Since when do you
like sports?

93
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,467
- Since never.
But I love hearing him talk.

94
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,066
- Tyler loves his fans.
- Wait, do you know him?

95
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,467
- Yeah, no, years ago.

96
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,066
You know that
catchphrase of his?

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,800
- "When you can't get
enough sports, I've got more."

98
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:06,967
- I gave that to him.

99
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,567
- This, I gotta hear.

100
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,700
- Well, it was when
I was interning at Mt. Sinai.

101
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,000
- Mm-hmm.

102
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:13,000
- And I guess
he'd playing hockey.

103
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:14,667
Came in with a concussion,
needed a doctor.

104
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,967
- I've seen that movie.
Sandra Bullock and somebody.

105
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,233
- Right?

106
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:20,066
Yeah, we dated
for a few months.

107
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,567
And then he asked to meet
my parents one Christmas.

108
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,233
- And?
- And I didn't realize it.

109
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,500
But it was so he could get
their blessing and propose.

110
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:32,567
- Tell me you said yes.
- Nope, don't think so.

111
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,133
- So what?
He never popped the question?

112
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:38,567
- Oh, no, he did.
I turned him down.

113
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,066
- You what?
- I know.

114
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,233
- You're the one
who needed the doctor.

115
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,567
I mean, look at the guy.

116
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,967
- Gosh, you know,

117
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,233
that was, like, the last
really good Christmas.

118
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:49,667
Before everything changed.

119
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,567
My mom and dad were
still together,

120
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,033
and my sister and I were
inseparable.

121
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,500
It was great.

122
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:57,166
We were like a real,
bonded family.

123
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,567
- Mm. That's so sweet.

124
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,367
Okay, but back to Mr. Sports.
Why did you say no?

125
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,367
- I don't know,
the timing wasn't right.

126
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,633
I was in med school, and he
was breaking into network news.

127
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,266
We took a break for a while,

128
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,100
and then we just decided
the moment had passed.

129
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:15,467
- Huh. We'll see about that.
- What are you doing?

130
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,767
- I'm checking his status.

131
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,567
Maybe there's still time
for you to find him

132
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,033
and plead temporary insanity.

133
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,433
Okay, you're in luck.
He's not married.

134
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:25,734
But he's in
a "serious relationship."

135
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,200
Look.

136
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,767
- Oh, they're still together.
That's nice.

137
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,700
- You knew about this?

138
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:33,033
Well, whoever she is, she's not
nearly good enough for him.

139
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,433
Sabrina.

140
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,734
She speaks five languages,

141
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:36,900
has two master's degrees,

142
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,767
and a book
in the top ten last year.

143
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,400
I think she's doing just fine.

144
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:45,100
I mean, I'm--I'm just guessing.
- Hmm.

145
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:47,033
So you have been keeping tabs.
- I don't have to!

146
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,900
He's everywhere.
He's hosting the World Series,

147
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:51,600
the Bowl games,
cohosting the next Olympics.

148
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,367
He's stalking me.

149
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,900
- What if he's still
in love with you?

150
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:59,934
- That was a long time ago,
in a galaxy far, far away.

151
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:01,533
I can't turn back time.

152
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,166
- He even got a new puppy.

153
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,667
Look at this guy.
- What?

154
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,033
Okay, Tyler did not even
like dogs before he met mine.

155
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,433
Oh, Boomer.
I miss that dog.

156
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,867
- Angie?

157
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,033
- Ben!
- Hey!

158
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,934
- Hi! What are you doing here?

159
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:18,266
- Oh, my firm's
just up the street.

160
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,767
- What?
I thought you were in Boston.

161
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,200
- No, my company moved me
to Manhattan.

162
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,934
Yeah, last summer.

163
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:26,767
- Wait, last summer?
You've been here all this time?

164
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,467
- Yes. You know, I've been
meaning to give you a call.

165
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,600
- Hi. I'm Sabrina.

166
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:35,767
I'm introducing myself because
as soon as you showed up,

167
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,367
she forgot I existed.

168
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,934
- Sorry, I'm just surprised
to see you is all.

169
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,266
- Yeah. Ben Lee.

170
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,867
Angie and I grew up together.
- Yeah.

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,433
both:
We were practically family.

172
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:46,433
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

173
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,433
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

174
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,033
I heard that your sister

175
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,800
is having
some trouble adopting.

176
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:55,300
Something about
the bio dad's parents or...

177
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:58,600
- Oh, yeah. I don't know.
You know more than I do.

178
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:01,266
Wait, I--corporate law?
I thought--

179
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,767
I thought family law is what
you always wanted to do.

180
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,200
- Yeah, that's true.
I wish I had.

181
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,166
But, you know, I mean,
the money's good, so...

182
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,367
- Well--

183
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
- So you're a corporate
attorney.

184
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:12,033
I work with Angie
at the hospital.

185
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,767
Neurosurgery.

186
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,200
- Oh. I'm impressed.

187
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,066
- That's why I said it.

188
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,667
Um, well, hey,

189
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,900
I'm here with some friends
from work,

190
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:24,333
and it's very casual,

191
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:26,400
so can I buy you ladies
a drink?

192
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,233
- Oh, I wish.

193
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:30,233
I have to go
if I'm gonna make the 10:15.

194
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,700
- But I'd love to,
if that's okay.

195
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:35,834
- Sure. Yeah, please.

196
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,333
- Well...
- It was good to see you. Yeah.

197
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:38,734
- Yeah, good to see you.

198
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,934
- Uh, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Ben.

199
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:42,433
- See you.
- Bye, sweetie.

200
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:56,266
- Hey, you! You!
- Me?

201
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,667
- Yeah, you.

202
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,734
- Oh, thank you.
I need a ticket to Yonkers.

203
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:04,333
The machine line is so long,

204
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:07,000
and my phone app
isn't working, so...

205
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:09,000
- Phones these days.
Tricky things.

206
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:13,233
I like the old days
when phones just made calls.

207
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,900
- Uh-huh. So I'm trying
to make the 10:15.

208
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:18,433
- Ah, the last express
to Yonkers.

209
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:19,633
- Yeah. Right.

210
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:21,300
So if--if you could
just help me out.

211
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:22,567
Here you go. Thank you.

212
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,500
- That's what I'm here for.

213
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:25,667
To help you out.

214
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,400
- Oh.

215
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,233
- Headed home for the holidays?

216
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:33,633
- Uh, no,
just a quiet one by myself.

217
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:35,266
It's what I want.

218
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,667
- Funny thing.

219
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,300
Sometimes what we want
is not what we need.

220
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:43,934
But they say the magic
of Christmas will find you

221
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:47,166
wherever you are.

222
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,300
- They say that? Okay.
- The 10:15.

223
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:54,266
- Yep. Oh, gosh.
I don't--can I make that?

224
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,734
- You still have
plenty of time.

225
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:57,800
- Well, I--

226
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,533
Huh, that's so weird.
I could swear--

227
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:08,200
- Please, don't.
Not this close to Christmas.

228
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,066
People are
in such a hurry lately.

229
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,567
Running here, rushing there.

230
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,633
Don't they know that this
is a time to slow things down,

231
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,834
appreciate the world
around you?

232
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:27,867
Here you go.
- Oh, wow, that's very fancy.

233
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,500
Oh, this is a round-trip.
I just needed the one-way.

234
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:34,333
- No charge. Merry Christmas.

235
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:35,900
- Okay.

236
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,667
- Enjoy your trip.

237
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,500
- He really is everywhere.

238
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,633
- Hi.
- Ticket, please.

239
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,900
- Yeah. Here you go.
- What's this?

240
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:49,633
- Some sort of holiday
promotion, I think.

241
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:53,400
- You'd think the main office
would tell us these things.

242
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,533
Here you go. Merry Christmas.

243
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,166
- What the...

244
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,200
- Did you miss me?
- Ahh!

245
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,834
- Oh! Ow! Okay!

246
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,667
Remind me
to never do that again.

247
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,233
- Tyler Grant?

248
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,166
- The donuts you asked for
from the breakfast car?

249
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,233
Santa's Specials?

250
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:38,200
Didn't expect me
back so soon, I guess?

251
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,500
- Tyler?

252
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:40,867
- Come on, I wasn't gone
that long.

253
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,633
- I'm so sorry. What is this?

254
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,333
- Well, this is breakfast,
although I imagine

255
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:45,900
your parents have
a more elaborate plan for that,

256
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:47,367
given all you've told me
about them.

257
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,567
Something about
your dad's French toast?

258
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,133
- My dad's in Arizona.
- Mm, I don't think so.

259
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:55,200
We called him this morning
when we were leaving Manhattan.

260
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,033
- Like, you and me, "we"?
- Like, you and me, "we."

261
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
- What was that for?
- Wow.

262
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,433
That kiss felt incredibly real.

263
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:08,633
- Yeah, well, I should hope so.
- Wait, wait, wait.

264
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,266
Sorry, um...

265
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,133
Just give a minute--a second.
Oh, gosh.

266
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:15,467
Don't move.
Just stay right there.

267
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,066
I will be right back, I think.
I don't know.

268
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,433
- All right,
but I can't promise that both

269
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:21,767
of these donuts will be here
when you get back.

270
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,100
- Oh, my God, I'm losing it.

271
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,800
You. You!
What are you doing here?

272
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:34,400
- Having a cup of cocoa.

273
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,600
- But you're the one
who sold me the ticket.

274
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:40,100
- Oh, I think
I'd remember that.

275
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:43,033
No, it's the uniforms.
We all look the same in these.

276
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,300
- Well, then you have a twin.

277
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:47,300
- Must be a handsome fella.

278
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:51,467
- Okay, well, whoever you are,
I'm not where I was.

279
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,100
I'm not-I'm not where
I'm supposed to be, I mean.

280
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:55,734
I mean, this isn't the train
that I got on.

281
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:57,367
This one is old.

282
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,367
I didn't even know these things
were running still.

283
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,700
Besides, and there's a guy
in the next car

284
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,934
that I haven't seen
in ten years.

285
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:08,834
- Is he bothering you?
- Well, no. Yes, uh--no.

286
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,767
But he's supposed to be on TV.
And he has donuts.

287
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,000
- That's not a crime.

288
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,266
Santa's Specials.

289
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,200
Psst! It's Christmas.

290
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:23,867
- I haven't had
one of those in like--

291
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,133
- Ten years?
- Yes. Exactly.

292
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,600
When Tyler bought them for me
on a train ride home in 2011!

293
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:34,300
Wait a second,
how did you know that?

294
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,700
This isn't my phone.

295
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:45,300
- No?
- No, but it has a signal.

296
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh, gosh.

297
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,934
Hi, it's Dr. Reynolds.

298
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:51,433
- Who?
- Angie Reynolds, neurology.

299
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:52,500
- Sure you have
the right number?

300
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:53,800
- Yes, I have the right number.

301
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:55,600
Can I speak with Dr. Navarro,
please?

302
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,667
- Can you spell that
for me, please?

303
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,700
- N-A-V-A--
- I've never heard of her.

304
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:02,400
- Yes--what do you mean
you've heard of her?

305
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,500
- Is she from this hospital?
- Yes, from this hospital.

306
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:06,200
Hello?

307
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,667
- Oh.

308
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,000
Whoa, would you look
at the time?

309
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:16,533
Next stop, Shepard's Ferry.

310
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:19,300
- My--my hometown?

311
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,400
We're in Connecticut?

312
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,900
- You might want to gather
your things and find a seat.

313
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:26,400
- No, no, no, no.

314
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:27,266
I don't want to find a seat.
I want to go home.

315
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,066
I want to go back
to New York City.

316
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,567
- Oh, well, you need
a return ticket for that.

317
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,934
- Oh, well, as it happens,
you sold me one.

318
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,567
Well, I guess it wasn't you.
It was some--your twin.

319
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,033
Anyway.

320
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,667
- Well, something seems
to be missing.

321
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,867
- Missing?
- No return.

322
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,367
Can't get home without it.

323
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,400
- I can't?
- Mm-mm.

324
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:58,066
- Sorry about the donuts.

325
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,900
Can't say I didn't
warn you, though.

326
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:02,433
- Wait, we're slowing down.

327
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,333
- Yeah, it's easier to get off
the train that way.

328
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:07,734
- Shepard's Ferry, next stop.

329
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:10,934
Shepard's Ferry, next stop.

330
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,767
You'll never get home
if you miss this stop.

331
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:19,066
Shepard's Ferry.

332
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,834
- Oh, cute town,
just like you said.

333
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,567
Love that Christmas tree.

334
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,467
- Yeah, we used to spend
every Christmas Eve there

335
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,567
for the lighting of the star.

336
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,133
It was a family tradition.

337
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:31,667
But they built a mini-mall
there years ago.

338
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,734
- Apparently not.
- Yes, they did.

339
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:37,500
There hasn't been a tree
there since 2011.

340
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:40,500
- So this year?

341
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:46,734
Are you okay?
- I'm not sure. Of anything.

342
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:47,900
- Okay, well, I'm gonna
get our coats.

343
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:48,900
- Oh.

344
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,600
- Be right back.

345
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:53,800
- What in the world
is happening?

346
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,367
- Christmas, of course.
Enjoy it while it lasts.

347
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:08,233
- Angie.
- Dad?

348
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,967
- Angie. Hey, sweetheart.

349
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,300
So good to see you, sweetheart.
- Oh, my.

350
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:16,033
- What'd I do to deserve
such a big hug?

351
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,700
- You're home!
- Of course I'm home.

352
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,233
You saw me here three weeks ago
for my birthday.

353
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,166
Where else would I go?
- Arizona?

354
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,066
- All that heat?
No, thank you.

355
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,633
You okay, babe?

356
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:27,700
- Oh, I just missed you
so much.

357
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:28,867
- Hey. Tyler Grant, sir.

358
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,567
- The famous TV sports reporter

359
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,233
we've heard so much about.

360
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:33,500
- Only local so far,

361
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,567
but I'm doing my best,
Mr. Reynolds.

362
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,667
- It's nice to meet you, son.
Please, call me George.

363
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,333
- You got it.
- You sure you're okay?

364
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:41,233
- It's the holidays.
This one's a softie.

365
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:43,000
- Don't I know it?

366
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:44,467
Think we should call ahead
and warn her mom or what?

367
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,033
- Dad.

368
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,233
- All right, guys, well,
car's right over here.

369
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,033
You ready?
- Yeah.

370
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,333
- Hey, did I hear you were
at the World Series this year?

371
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,033
- Oh, yeah,
for the St. Louis win.

372
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,266
Locker room celebration
and everything.

373
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,967
You know, if they send me next
year, you should join me.

374
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,300
- This one's a keeper, Angie.

375
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:01,633
- I couldn't dream up
anyone better.

376
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:06,400
- Get your stuff upstairs.

377
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,433
You guys, just
make yourselves at home.

378
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,734
- Wow. Angie told me you had
the perfect Christmas house.

379
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:13,467
- Everything but the tree.
Saving that for you two.

380
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,400
Do have some broken lights
on these strings, though.

381
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:16,767
Maybe you can help me
fix them later,

382
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,567
we can talk some football?
- Yeah.

383
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,834
You happy to be home?
- You have no idea.

384
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,100
- Henrik!
No running in the house!

385
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,433
Peter!
- It's Christmas. Let them go.

386
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:32,600
- Oh, wait.

387
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:34,967
- Honey!

388
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,033
- Hi, sis.
- Hi.

389
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,600
- Welcome home.
- Oh.

390
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:39,133
- He found the dog
before I could wrap it.

391
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,700
- You must be the boyfriend.

392
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,467
- If I'm not, this is gonna be
a very awkward visit.

393
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,600
- Tyler, this is my sister,
Kristen,

394
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:47,033
and her husband, Peter.

395
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,567
And that blur was Henrik
back when he was four.

396
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,300
- Back when he was four?

397
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:55,033
- Mom. Look at you!

398
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,767
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, my God.

399
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,266
- Don't. I have been baking
gingerbread for tomorrow.

400
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,100
- Gingerbread house day.

401
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,600
Oh, made the whole house
smell like Christmas.

402
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,300
We did it every year.

403
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:07,433
- Uh, you make it sound
like ancient history.

404
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:10,133
- Mom, this is Tyler.
Tyler, this is my mom.

405
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:11,133
- Mrs. Reynolds.

406
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:12,533
- Call me Evelyn

407
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,433
or there's a good chance
I will not answer you.

408
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,467
- All right, then, Evelyn.

409
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,967
- Boomer!

410
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,200
Oh, Boomer. You're alive.

411
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,867
- These two were inseparable
till she went to med school.

412
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,200
But now he's all mine.
- What--what is he, a bulldog?

413
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,467
- A rescue, the best kind.

414
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,533
- Hey, fella.

415
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:38,333
You know, I'm not
much of a dog person.

416
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:41,100
But this guy's terrific.

417
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:43,000
- Maybe you'll get your own
one day.

418
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,667
- Now we just gotta get
you two settled in,

419
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,333
and your mom's come up
with a little list for us.

420
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,166
We've got tree shopping,
Santa, of course,

421
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,967
and then the big town
Christmas Eve sing-along.

422
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,100
- A town tradition,
where they light

423
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:57,166
the Christmas star on the tree
in front of the train station.

424
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,767
- Oh, I've heard.

425
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,600
- Never a dull moment
come December.

426
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:03,033
- And Aunt Myrt's party.
Bigger than ever, she says.

427
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,867
But then...
all: She always says that!

428
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,533
- Myrtle Conway, no relation,

429
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:09,734
but everyone in town calls
her Aunt Myrt.

430
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:11,667
You'll love her.

431
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,834
- We still have
your room upstairs.

432
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,900
So hururry up and get ready.
We've got lots to do.

433
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,066
- Your family's great.
- Say that in a few days.

434
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,800
- I bet I will.
- Yeah. I bet you will too.

435
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:33,934
- Hey, if we're going tree
shopping, I need to change.

436
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:35,934
- Right.
Second door on the left.

437
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:37,100
And I'll meet you downstairs.

438
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,433
- Yeah.

439
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:40,967
- 'Cause--cool.
- Tyler Grant.

440
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,133
- Yeah.

441
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:45,333
Whoa.

442
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:47,166
- Everything okay?

443
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,300
- I thought she changed this to
a crafts room for her pottery.

444
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:53,467
- Since when has mom
been into pottery?

445
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,500
- I just meant
I thought she maybe found

446
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,400
another use for it, that's all.

447
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:58,400
- Never.

448
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,967
She has this idea that you'll
become a successful doctor

449
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,333
and still find a way
to move back in.

450
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:04,967
- How? All my patients
are in Manhattan--

451
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,300
Will. Will.
Will be in Manhattan.

452
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:09,567
I imagine.

453
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,166
How's Peter? He looks great.
And Henrik? Oh, my gosh.

454
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,633
- Growing like a weed
since you last saw him.

455
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:18,133
Of course that's been a while.

456
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,633
So tell me about Tyler.

457
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:21,834
- Oh, well, he's all
about sports, 24-7.

458
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:24,967
I mean, he's cohosting
the next Olympics.

459
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,367
Sometime in the future,
I would imagine.

460
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,400
- Is it love?
- I mean, he's very handsome.

461
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:33,967
Kind, funny,
on the brink of a major career.

462
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,500
What the heck was I thinking?

463
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,066
- You have doubts?

464
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,500
- Yeah, but for the life of me,
I cannot think why.

465
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:42,200
When he proposes this time...

466
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,867
Ignore me.
I don't know what I'm saying.

467
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,700
- Clearly.

468
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:51,533
- Kristen, this is going to be
the best Christmas.

469
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:52,800
If I could pick one
from all the holidays

470
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:54,834
we've spent, I pick this one.

471
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,367
- You just got here.
- Yeah, but I can feel it.

472
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,133
Can't you?

473
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:02,133
Everything's perfect.
Everyone's happy.

474
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:04,800
- Sure.

475
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:06,567
- Just the way that
it was supposed to be.

476
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,500
- Anyway, first thing
on Mom's list is that tree.

477
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:14,367
"Not till Angie gets here."
Henrik's so excited.

478
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,367
- Yeah. Let me just change real
quick, and I'll be right down.

479
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,200
Okay, keep it together, Angie.

480
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,467
Oh, my God, you could wake up
at any minute now.

481
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,867
So enjoy it.

482
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,200
Where have I seen this before?

483
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,700
- Smile, everybody. Look like
you're having a good time.

484
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:49,300
- We are having a good
time, Peter.

485
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:50,967
- Hey, is that a new tablet?

486
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,734
- Early Christmas gift
from Kristen.

487
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:54,300
So we can capture every moment.

488
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,633
- And he means every moment!

489
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:58,467
- It's okay to put that down
every now and then, honey.

490
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,734
- All right, everyone,

491
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,567
I want us to find
the perfect tree,

492
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,033
so I think we should split up
and cover more territory.

493
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,233
I'll head over this way.

494
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,400
- Honey, you want me
to go with you?

495
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,533
I mean, we're supposed
to do this together, right?

496
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,700
- Yeah.

497
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:12,233
- No, no, I think it's best
if we make this a solo mission.

498
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:14,233
- Your father is so stubborn.

499
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,934
He has to find
the perfect tree.

500
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,467
They all look the same

501
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,934
once they have
the ornaments on them, right?

502
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,934
- I agree.
- I better go with him,

503
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:22,900
otherwise we'll be here
till New Year's Eve.

504
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,300
- Look! Look!

505
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:26,066
it's Santa's Workshop!
Can you take me?

506
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,533
- Yeah. Is that okay, you guys?

507
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,400
- Of course.
- Feel free.

508
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:30,900
We've already seen three of
Santa's other helpers

509
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:35,367
this season.
- Lovely for you.

510
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,100
- If it isn't my
old friend, Henrik!

511
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:38,633
- Santa!

512
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:41,266
- You come to tell Santa
what you want for Christmas?

513
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,567
- I want a baby brother.

514
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,567
Or a sister,
if that's all you got.

515
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,233
- That is a--a tall order
on short notice.

516
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:52,400
How about a race car?
How about--how about that?

517
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,433
- I'd rather have
a baby brother.

518
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:58,200
- Oh, well, um, Santa will see
what he can do.

519
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:03,967
But in the meantime,
how about a candy cane?

520
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,300
- Thank you!
- Yes, of course.

521
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:08,100
- Awesome. Thank you.

522
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:11,166
- Aww, not so fast, you two.
Who's next?

523
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,700
- Oh, we're just here
for Henrik.

524
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:14,266
- Oh, no, no, no.
I think someone else might need

525
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,667
some of your attention here,
Santa.

526
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,100
- Tyler, would you stop? Tyler!
- Oh, yes.

527
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:21,467
Well, young lady, what
would you like for Christmas?

528
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,000
- Ben?

529
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:29,600
- Oh, did you say you want Ben
for Christmas?

530
00:22:29,734 --> 00:22:31,934
- That's right, you were Santa
that year--this year.

531
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:33,300
- Don't blow my cover.

532
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:34,333
You're gonna make
the kids cry again!

533
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:35,800
- Sorry.

534
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:38,467
- Anyway, what would you like
in your stocking?

535
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,166
- Well, I already got
a Christmas gift this year,

536
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,367
and it's a real doozy,
let me tell you.

537
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,433
- Could you maybe put in
a good word for me, Santa?

538
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:49,000
- Tyler, this is Ben.
Ben, this is Tyler.

539
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:52,000
- Oh, um, you know,
I'll have to check.

540
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:54,800
He might be
on Santa's naughty list.

541
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:58,367
But you, you get a candy cane.

542
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,333
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

543
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:02,233
- Here. Come see! Come see!

544
00:23:02,367 --> 00:23:04,200
- Excuse me, sir.
- Beg your pardon.

545
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,100
- Hey.
- There we go. Ah.

546
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:09,066
- What do you think?
- All right.

547
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,867
See this, Tyler?
This is what I'm talking about.

548
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,900
- Looks great.

549
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:15,233
- Pretty good.
- Hey.

550
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:17,734
What's the deal with Angie
and, uh, Santa back there?

551
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:19,667
- Ben? Friend of the family.

552
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,200
They grew up together.
- Oh.

553
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,533
- And was Angie's
first kiss, I hear?

554
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,433
He's coming over later
to help decorate.

555
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:27,367
- Great.
- So this is the one

556
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,033
that I was thinking about.
I don't know

557
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,033
if you have thoughts
that you want to share.

558
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:34,600
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh! Angie!

559
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:35,934
- Chloe!
- Oh, hi!

560
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:38,033
- Hi.
- Merry Christmas, everyone!

561
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,533
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

562
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:40,767
- Oh, this is Chloe.

563
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,000
This is Aunt Myrt's
granddaughter.

564
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:45,700
- Hi! I'm so surprised
to see you here.

565
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:48,734
I--yeah,
with such handsome company.

566
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:52,066
- This is Tyler Grant.
And you know everyone else.

567
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,333
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too!

568
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh, were you guys looking
at this tree too?

569
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:57,433
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, no.

570
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,000
I mean, if you want
to take it, you can take it.

571
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,567
- No. No, no, no. It's fine.

572
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,233
Honestly,
it's for Aunt Myrt's party,

573
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:03,567
and it might not be big enough.

574
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,767
You know how she is.
Anyway, but Ben is here.

575
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,233
And he's keeping an eye out
for the best tree,

576
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:09,333
so I'm just gonna
let him handle it

577
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:11,100
when he's done playing Santa.
You guys can have this tree.

578
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:12,900
Just have it.
It's really a beautiful one.

579
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:18,133
And blah! I'll see you later.
Merry Christmas! Bye!

580
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:20,800
- All right, Tyler, my boy,
let's wrap this up.

581
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:22,100
Bring her home.

582
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,967
- Hey.

583
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,433
- What do you think?
Should this be an earring?

584
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:33,066
Earring?

585
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,233
- It's so nice and shiny.
- Look, it's a necklace.

586
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:48,066
- Word is you and Santa over
there had a thing back when.

587
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,133
- What? Oh, Ben?

588
00:24:50,266 --> 00:24:52,300
No. No thing.

589
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:56,100
- Something about a first kiss?
- Oh. Yeah, we were 11.

590
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:59,166
It was a lot more tooth
than lip.

591
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,800
- Guy seems like
he's part of the family.

592
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,333
- Yeah.
Well, his--his grandmother

593
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:05,867
raised him, so my parents
were like his parents.

594
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:13,233
Tyler, you're not jealous,
are you?

595
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,600
- Me? Come on! No. No way.

596
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:20,633
- All right, everybody,
let's see what we got.

597
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:25,166
Let's count down.
all: Three...two...one!

598
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:29,667
- Now all it needs
is the ornaments.

599
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,667
Henrik, you get
to hang the first one.

600
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,867
- Good job, boys.
- Okay, where's this guy going?

601
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,033
Right--yeah. Yeah.

602
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:41,400
Perfect.

603
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:43,567
Yep. Nice work.

604
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:46,233
- I see you're
a very good boy,

605
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:48,200
so you'll get
your fire engine.

606
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,033
- You see?
I told you he'd get me one.

607
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:51,500
- Mm-hmm. Yes, dear.

608
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,867
Well, look, you wait
right over there.

609
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,734
Mommy wants
to thank Santa too.

610
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,333
What do you mean by saying
a thing like that?

611
00:25:58,467 --> 00:25:59,967
- Hey, Dad.

612
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,200
There's plenty of room
on the couch

613
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,233
over here next to Mom.

614
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:03,300
- Oh, it's okay.

615
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:06,066
I'm comfortable right here.

616
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,100
- Are you sure, you know?

617
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,433
You two always liked to...

618
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,967
- Leave him be, Angie.

619
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,934
I've got Boomer
to keep me warm, don't I, boy?

620
00:26:17,066 --> 00:26:18,967
- I'm good too.
I've got my magazine.

621
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,467
- What? Was that it?

622
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:47,567
- Having a good holiday?

623
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,734
- I'm so sorry.

624
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:50,400
I don't understand
what's happening.

625
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:52,767
- You don't need
to understand it.

626
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,133
You need to appreciate it.

627
00:26:55,266 --> 00:26:56,867
- Oh, I do.
I appreciate it so much.

628
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,700
But this ends now, right?

629
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:01,166
I mean, we both know this
Christmas can't last forever.

630
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,433
Am I right?

631
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,133
- You want to go back
to New York.

632
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:07,100
- Yes, I do.
- What's the hurry?

633
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:09,934
- Uh, well, for one thing,
it's 2011 here,

634
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:11,967
and there's no way I'm going
back to medical school.

635
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,266
So if we could just turn
this train around,

636
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,934
that would be great.

637
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,633
- Whatever you say!

638
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:17,767
- Oh.

639
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,500
- Ticket, please.
- Yeah!

640
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:26,166
- It's still blank.

641
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,300
- Nothing I can do
without that ticket.

642
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,333
Rules of the rails.

643
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:36,934
- So what do I do?
- You need to put things right.

644
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:40,033
Before Christmas Eve,
I'd imagine.

645
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:44,700
That's the way these things
usually work out.

646
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:47,533
Ticking clock and all.

647
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,200
- Or what? Or what?
I'm stuck here forever?

648
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:53,200
Okay, I have to put
something right.

649
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,033
Tyler's proposal!

650
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,200
Wait, am I supposed
to say yes this time?

651
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,700
'Cause, you know,
last time I said no,

652
00:27:57,834 --> 00:27:58,633
which just felt right,
given where we were

653
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:01,867
in our lives,
but now I don't know.

654
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,233
Is that it? That's it.

655
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:06,934
- Shepard's Ferry!

656
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:10,767
Next stop.

657
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,266
Shepard's...

658
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,066
- Okay, so I'm gonna do that.

659
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,367
- Ferry.

660
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:43,367
- Wait a sec--

661
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:51,567
- There you go, buddy.

662
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:55,533
Oh! My...

663
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,867
Where did you come from?

664
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,800
The sun's barely up.
What are you doing here?

665
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:02,567
- If I knew,
I would tell you, honestly.

666
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,934
Friend of yours?

667
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:06,467
- Oh, yeah,
back from the repair shop.

668
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,834
Freak walnut-cracking accident.

669
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:10,000
You do not want to know.

670
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:11,567
- I'll take your word for it.

671
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,400
- And I'm here
because I promised Aunt Myrt

672
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:14,734
a tree impressive enough
for a party.

673
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:15,900
- Uh-huh.
- Nothing yet.

674
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:17,100
But there's
another shipment coming,

675
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:18,500
so we'll see.

676
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:19,600
Is there something
on your mind?

677
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:21,333
- Oh, so much.

678
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:24,433
- Okay, well, if you need
a friendly ear, we got time.

679
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:27,333
- It's gonna sound
absolutely crazy.

680
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,800
Totally insane.

681
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,433
Maybe that's what's happening.
I've lost my mind.

682
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:34,967
- Okay, now you have
my attention.

683
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,567
- You know what?
We're not even close anymore,

684
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,967
because you moved
from Boston to Manhattan,

685
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,233
and you didn't even call me.
- What?

686
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:42,400
- Ugh, but I have to tell
somebody.

687
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:45,300
I have to tell somebody,
because--wait a second.

688
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:46,967
The train dropped me off here.

689
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,834
Maybe that's a sign.

690
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:50,400
I'm supposed to tell you!

691
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:51,533
- Angie, you can
tell me anything!

692
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,100
Remember when you parked
the principal's motorcycle

693
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:54,467
in his office?

694
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,767
How did you do that anyway?

695
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,266
- The car club did it.

696
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,500
It was just my idea
to take the handlebars off

697
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,600
and then roll it in and put it
back together in there.

698
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:03,967
- That is genius.
- I know. So great.

699
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,300
- My point is, who didn't
turn you into school police?

700
00:30:06,433 --> 00:30:08,100
Huh? This guy.

701
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:09,633
Also, who didn't rat you out
when you skipped class

702
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:10,834
to go see "Spider-Man"?

703
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,400
- That's because you
came with me.

704
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:13,967
- Right. That's true.

705
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,767
Well, 'cause we had
the same taste in movies.

706
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,333
- Yeah. And music.
And ice cream.

707
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:19,500
- Yep. Oh, well, except for
your weird sprinkle obsession.

708
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:20,734
I will never understand that--
- What's your point?

709
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:21,900
Don't talk about sprinkles.

710
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:25,133
- My--my point is
you can trust me.

711
00:30:25,266 --> 00:30:29,100
So whatever you want to say,
just blurt it out.

712
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:30,567
- I'm from the future!

713
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,433
- And you're here
to terminate me?

714
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:34,300
- Ben, be serious.
- What? You started it!

715
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,000
- Listen to the words that are
coming out of my mouth.

716
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:38,467
It's totally true!

717
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,266
I am from the future!

718
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,667
- And that's, like,
a metaphor for...

719
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,233
- No, Ben, stay with me!

720
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,266
Okay, I got on a train
to Yonkers last night,

721
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,000
and the year was 2021.

722
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:54,633
Instead of Yonkers,
it dropped me off here and now.

723
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,600
- Okay, I don't--
I mean--

724
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:58,567
- This was a mistake.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

725
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,333
Wait, wait, hold on.

726
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:03,467
Tell me again.
Slowly. And over food.

727
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,600
- You always think about food!
- Well, are you not hungry?

728
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,300
- Morning.
- Hey, Tyler. How'd you sleep?

729
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:15,433
- Oh, just fine.

730
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,734
Boomer keeps
following me around everywhere.

731
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:25,333
- He likes you. French toast?
- I hear it's world-famous.

732
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,033
Sure, yeah, hook me up.
Haven't seen Angie yet.

733
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,967
- She's up and out
already this morning.

734
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,533
Always the early bird.

735
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:33,333
- Actually, that gives me
a chance to ask you something.

736
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:34,533
- Oh, yeah?

737
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,000
- About me and your daughter.

738
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:38,967
- And what might that be?

739
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,467
- Okay. Wait. Hold on.

740
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,033
Can we go back to the part

741
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,633
where I'm the incredibly
successful corporate lawyer

742
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:46,066
in New York?

743
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,133
I thought I was gonna
go into family law.

744
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:51,000
- I know, but somewhere along
the way, that changes,

745
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:52,233
and I don't know how.

746
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:54,233
- That's all I ever
wanted to do!

747
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:55,567
You know how important
family is to me.

748
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,000
I can't imagine
changing my mind about that.

749
00:31:58,133 --> 00:31:59,567
- Ben, I know how this sounds.

750
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,734
God, I wish--I wish there
was a way I could prove it.

751
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:04,033
I mean...

752
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:06,467
- Show me
your driver's license.

753
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,066
Is it a holograph?

754
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,467
Are you about to pop up in 3D,
like Princess Leia?

755
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,367
Come on, say,
"Help me, Ben Lee."

756
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,967
- You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

757
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,767
It's ten years, Ben,
not ten-hundred.

758
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,800
And no, I don't have it,
because when I woke up here,

759
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:22,300
everything was as it was.

760
00:32:22,433 --> 00:32:23,533
Like, look at this phone.

761
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:24,800
I mean,
it's practically an antique.

762
00:32:24,934 --> 00:32:26,700
- An antique?
That's the latest model.

763
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:28,567
That's newer than mine.

764
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,734
Oh, wait. Yeah.

765
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,467
Okay, there probably
are a couple upgrades.

766
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,767
- Yeah. They get bigger.
- That doesn't--

767
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,533
oh, thank you.

768
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:38,300
- Thanks.
- Well, let's get some food.

769
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:40,867
Ooh, tell me
what I'm gonna order.

770
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,600
- Ben, I don't remember
everything.

771
00:32:42,734 --> 00:32:44,367
Do you remember what you had
for breakfast ten years ago?

772
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,934
- Pancakes, bacon,
orange juice.

773
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:48,400
- Okay.

774
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,967
- It's 'cause I have that
every morning.

775
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,433
- Oh, geez.

776
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:53,100
- The old you used to love
that about me.

777
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:58,367
- Ooh, the New York Giants
win the Super Bowl.

778
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,633
- No!
- Yep.

779
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,767
- No!
Against Brady and the Pats?

780
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,133
No! They're undefeated.

781
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:04,600
- No. But it's not pretty.
Trust me.

782
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:05,767
- Oh, so I'm supposed
to wait around

783
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,500
until then to see
if you're right?

784
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:09,633
- Okay. We make gingerbread
houses tonight.

785
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:11,033
- Yep.
Your mom invited me over.

786
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:12,967
- But I knew that.

787
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,867
- Well, she always
invites me over.

788
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,033
That's no mystery.

789
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:16,700
- Wait a second.

790
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:18,834
You choke on a gumdrop today,
and I save your life.

791
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:20,200
- Well, I would hope so.
You're in med school.

792
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:21,667
That's, like, the job.

793
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,300
- Ben, it's not that
I save your life,

794
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:25,934
it's that I know
that you choke.

795
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:27,467
- Oh, okay!

796
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,834
Wait, well, what if I don't now
that you told me?

797
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:30,333
- You will.
- Or will I?

798
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,633
- Yeah.
- You sure?

799
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:32,967
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

800
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,533
I think I have the power
to change the future.

801
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,200
- Use it wisely.

802
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,000
- I put a lot of work into it,
but, you know,

803
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:43,867
I finally sent in my audition
tape, and now I wait.

804
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,266
It's national news, so even
an interview would be amazing.

805
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,033
- I don't understand
any of that,

806
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:52,033
but I would certainly hire you
if I had a network.

807
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,633
- Maybe you'll get one
for Christmas, Mom.

808
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:55,667
It's never too late.
- Perhaps.

809
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,367
- Eventually I'm gonna need
a catchphrase, you know,

810
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,367
something memorable, like...

811
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,100
- "When you can't get
enough sports, I've got more."

812
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:04,033
- Hey, that's good.

813
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:07,033
- No. It's close. But...

814
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:09,066
- Why don't you think about it?
It might grow on you.

815
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,700
Hey, where's Dad?

816
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:12,166
- I don't know.
He's around here somewhere.

817
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,333
He's probably
shoveling the sidewalk

818
00:34:14,467 --> 00:34:15,867
or cleaning the attic
of something.

819
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,867
He needs his alone time
right now.

820
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,934
- And missing this?
That's not like him.

821
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:25,200
- Your father's his own man.
Don't ask me to explain him.

822
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:28,166
- Hey.
Does anyone want gumdrops?

823
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,867
Gumdrop, anyone?
They are delicious.

824
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,100
- No, we're good.
Why don't you have one?

825
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:36,433
- Oh, maybe I will.
No.

826
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:40,200
- No?
- Or yes. No. Maybe later.

827
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:43,000
- What is up with you two?
- That's just Ben being Ben.

828
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:44,166
He thinks he's funny.

829
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,600
- You always thought
I was funny.

830
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:47,934
The senior play?
I can still hear you laughing.

831
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:48,900
- That's because your pants
fell down

832
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:50,367
during your big speech.

833
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,934
Who knew George Washington
had SpongeBob boxers?

834
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:56,200
- Okay. Okay.
It was laundry day.

835
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:59,767
- Honestly, you guys,
they've been like this forever.

836
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,400
- Yeah, please ignore him.

837
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:02,400
- Yes.
- Hey, how's it going, Henrik?

838
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,567
- Good.
- Yeah?

839
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,600
- He's a one-kid
construction crew.

840
00:35:05,734 --> 00:35:06,800
- Imagine what
he could accomplish

841
00:35:06,934 --> 00:35:08,066
with a brother or sister.

842
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,834
We all heard him ask Santa.

843
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:12,967
- Hey, bud, how about
a candy cane fence?

844
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:15,767
- Ben, are you okay?

845
00:35:17,633 --> 00:35:20,333
- I think he's choking.
- What are you choking on, Ben?

846
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:22,300
- What do we do?
Hit him on the back?

847
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:23,433
- He's definitely choking.
- What do we do?

848
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:24,734
- The gumdrops.
It's the gumdrops.

849
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:26,233
- Oh, is it the gumdrops?

850
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:27,734
- What do--we hit him
on the back.

851
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:28,734
- He can't breathe.
- Hit him on the back?

852
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:30,900
No. I think you have to--
- Angie, Angie.

853
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:32,467
- He can't breathe.
- Are you choking?

854
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:42,934
Thank you.

855
00:35:43,066 --> 00:35:44,266
- That's a relief.

856
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,934
- Who could have seen
that coming?

857
00:35:46,066 --> 00:35:48,166
- Right? It's like you'd have
to be from the future.

858
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:51,800
- Gross.

859
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:54,400
- I told you!
- Okay.

860
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:56,567
So you have until
Christmas day,

861
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,600
or what, you're stuck here?

862
00:35:57,734 --> 00:35:58,900
- Well, he said Christmas Eve,

863
00:35:59,033 --> 00:35:59,967
but I think all
I have to do to fix it

864
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:01,033
is say yes tonight.

865
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,066
- Say yes to what?

866
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,133
- To Tyler's proposal.

867
00:36:03,266 --> 00:36:05,233
Last time I said no.

868
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:07,300
- Wait, wait, you're saying...
- Oh, you don't know that yet.

869
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:08,734
- You're gonna marry Tyler?

870
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,333
I mean, are you sure
that's what you want?

871
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:12,166
- What, is that
such a wild idea?

872
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,734
- Well, I
kind of thought that--

873
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:15,734
- What? What'd you think?

874
00:36:15,867 --> 00:36:19,066
- I thought that--
- Oh, oh, you and me. Oh, Ben.

875
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,800
If everyone who loved
Coldplay and lasagna

876
00:36:20,934 --> 00:36:21,800
wound up together...

877
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:23,867
Besides, we tried dating.

878
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,166
- Well, you didn't really
take it seriously.

879
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,400
- Are you joking me?
You didn't take it seriously!

880
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:31,467
Plus, we're friends now, Ben,
and that feels right.

881
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,667
Right?

882
00:36:36,266 --> 00:36:38,367
Now that works for us,
right, Ben?

883
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,200
- If you're worried, don't be.
- Oh. I--oh. Not worried.

884
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:49,667
- Okay. But if you are.

885
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,500
- Sorry.

886
00:36:51,633 --> 00:36:53,300
Tyler Grant.

887
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:54,867
Hey! Yeah, I've been hoping
to hear from you.

888
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,467
- So you think the entire
Christmas universe

889
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,467
arranged all of this...
- Mm-hmm.

890
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,600
- So you can come back
and marry Tyler?

891
00:37:01,734 --> 00:37:03,066
- Well, nothing else
makes sense!

892
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,533
- And you think
that makes sense?

893
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,600
- Yes!
Tonight, he took me to Donovan.

894
00:37:06,734 --> 00:37:09,233
Well, no, sorry,
he takes me to Donovan--

895
00:37:09,367 --> 00:37:11,066
you know what I mean.
- Yeah. Expensive.

896
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,433
I'm impressed.
Or, like, I will be impressed.

897
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,800
Or I have--bugh. Bugh!
Now you have me doing it.

898
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,233
- So he's gonna take me there,

899
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:18,767
and he puts a ring
in my champagne glass.

900
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,600
- Cliché. But--sorry.

901
00:37:21,734 --> 00:37:23,800
- I think it's sweet.
So I'm gonna say yes,

902
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:26,400
and then I think everything
should just go back to normal.

903
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:29,300
- Sure. As if anything with you
is ever normal.

904
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:31,300
- You see, this is why
we never worked out.

905
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:38,333
Whew.

906
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:42,100
- So how was your meal?

907
00:37:42,233 --> 00:37:44,033
- I mean, amazing.
All seven courses.

908
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:46,533
Gosh, I forgot how good
the food was here.

909
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:48,033
- Have you been here before?

910
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,133
- No,
I just mean from the reviews.

911
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:51,967
You know what,
I can honestly say

912
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,567
I've only ever been here
with you.

913
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,734
- Good. Because I want
tonight to be special.

914
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:57,767
- Oh?

915
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,367
- I told you there was a reason
for this dinner tonight.

916
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,700
A surprise.

917
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:04,200
- Oh?
I wonder what it could be.

918
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:06,600
- Thank you.

919
00:38:06,734 --> 00:38:08,266
- No, but seriously,
what is it,

920
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,333
'cause this is just champagne.

921
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:13,266
- Yeah. To celebrate...

922
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,033
My new job!

923
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:16,433
- Your what?

924
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:17,834
- Angie, they called me
this afternoon,

925
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:19,200
while you were out
in the snow with Santa.

926
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,667
They loved my audition tapes.
My interviews.

927
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,600
My catchphrase.
Well, your catchphrase.

928
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:26,000
- Yeah, no, I'm sure they did.

929
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:27,767
You'll develop a whole show

930
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,367
around it someday
in the future.

931
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,266
- I'm going from local
to national.

932
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,867
I mean, can you believe that?
- I cannot.

933
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,800
I'm very happy for you, Tyler.
That's wonderful.

934
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:40,500
- There's only one catch.
I do have to go to the city

935
00:38:40,633 --> 00:38:42,767
first thing tomorrow
to seal the deal.

936
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,900
- Wait, you're leaving?
- Just for the day.

937
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:48,333
But what a reason
to celebrate, right?

938
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:50,166
I mean, bet you didn't see
that one coming tonight, huh?

939
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,667
- I did not. At all.

940
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,867
- Ooh, that's good.

941
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:12,800
- Hey, honey.

942
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,700
Tyler's packing upstairs.
Is everything okay?

943
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:17,166
- Yeah, he got that job.
The promotion that he wanted?

944
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,867
He's gotta go sign contracts.

945
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,667
But he'll be back
for Aunt Myrt's party.

946
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,333
- He wouldn't want
to miss that!

947
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:24,734
And the sing-along.
And the lighting of the star.

948
00:39:27,266 --> 00:39:30,700
Did you two have
a nice time tonight?

949
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:32,633
- It wasn't exactly
what I expected,

950
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:35,333
but yeah, it was nice.
I need your finger.

951
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:37,033
- Oh. Good.

952
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,900
Your sister
just put Henrik to bed.

953
00:39:39,033 --> 00:39:41,700
That boy has so much energy.

954
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:43,834
If there were two of them...

955
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:47,233
- She's not--she can't be--
- No.

956
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:50,700
- Right. Yeah.

957
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:53,166
- They've been trying
for a long time.

958
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,000
In vitro.
She didn't tell you?

959
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:57,633
- No.

960
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:00,467
- Well, between you and me,
it's not going so well.

961
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,834
I'm sure
she's just trying to find

962
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:05,166
the right time to tell you.
- Yeah.

963
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:08,967
How about you, Mom?

964
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,200
Everything okay
with you and Dad?

965
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,700
- Why do you ask?

966
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:13,333
- I don't know,
he's very distant this year.

967
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:15,133
He's always off
doing something.

968
00:40:15,266 --> 00:40:18,834
- Yeah.
That's just him right now.

969
00:40:18,967 --> 00:40:21,200
You know, we'll be fine.

970
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:24,567
The season brings up
a lot of things in people.

971
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:35,834
Look at that.

972
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:39,166
Dreams we have when we're young
just sometimes don't turn out

973
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,567
the way we'd hoped.

974
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,066
- That's the dress
in my closet.

975
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,700
- Yeah, I put some of
my old things in there.

976
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:46,867
I hope you don't mind.

977
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,934
- You look the same, Mom.

978
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:52,367
- Wouldn't it be nice

979
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,233
if something things stayed
the same?

980
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:56,867
- I love you, Mom.

981
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,400
- Love you.

982
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:08,934
- Where's Henrik?
- He's out like a light.

983
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,467
- Oh.

984
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,700
I spoke to the doctor.

985
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:16,967
- You're only telling me
this now?

986
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,967
- He called right
before dinner.

987
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,567
This is the first chance
we've had to talk.

988
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,333
- Okay, and?

989
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,467
- The two remaining embryos
didn't make it to day five.

990
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,734
- And those were all we had.
So that's it?

991
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:34,200
- He wants us to come in
after the holidays

992
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:37,300
to discuss next steps.

993
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:41,066
- Peter, it feels like
the end of the road.

994
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,633
- It's not the end.
Not necessarily.

995
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:48,400
- It was so easy with Henrik.
Why is it so hard now?

996
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,533
- You heard.

997
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:06,600
- Did not mean to eavesdrop.
Kristen, I'm so sorry.

998
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:09,100
- So are we.
- I could have helped!

999
00:42:09,233 --> 00:42:11,133
I'm a doctor
at a major Manhattan hospital

1000
00:42:11,266 --> 00:42:12,767
with connections
and relationships.

1001
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,033
- You're only a med student.

1002
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:18,166
- Right, my point is,

1003
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,100
why didn't you tell me
what you were going through?

1004
00:42:22,233 --> 00:42:24,133
- We've never had
that kind of relationship.

1005
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:27,300
The sister thing.
Where we do each other's hair,

1006
00:42:27,433 --> 00:42:31,033
talk about boys,
heartaches, all that.

1007
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:33,166
- But that's not us?

1008
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,467
- Come on, Angie,
you've never taken the time

1009
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,967
to ask about my life.

1010
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,300
It's always been about yours,
which, I admit,

1011
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,600
is more interesting.

1012
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:46,033
- Wow.
That's really how you see me?

1013
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:48,767
I mean, if I was busy during
med school and interning--

1014
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,834
- There's a disconnect.
Like with Tyler.

1015
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:53,700
If it hadn't been for Mom,

1016
00:42:53,834 --> 00:42:57,100
I wouldn't have known
till you showed up with him.

1017
00:42:57,233 --> 00:42:58,467
- Right.

1018
00:43:00,467 --> 00:43:03,900
- Is he the one, you think?

1019
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:06,500
- He was gonna propose tonight.
At least I thought he was.

1020
00:43:06,633 --> 00:43:10,000
- But he didn't?
- No, he didn't.

1021
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:13,667
Anyway, no,
we're talking about you.

1022
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,433
I am gonna try really hard,
promise, to be a better sister.

1023
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:27,000
- Maybe it's because of Ben,
why he didn't propose.

1024
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:29,934
He sees how you two are
with each other.

1025
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:33,400
- You think Tyler's jealous?
- It's pretty obvious.

1026
00:43:33,533 --> 00:43:36,700
Ben's good-looking,
funny, single.

1027
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:40,567
- Eh, he's fine.
- You've been friends forever.

1028
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,033
It wouldn't be a problem
if he had a girlfriend.

1029
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:44,300
But he doesn't.

1030
00:43:46,734 --> 00:43:49,033
- But he could.

1031
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:52,000
- Okay, hopefully this tree
will do.

1032
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:54,934
- Ooh, it's absolutely perfect!
- Ben, you remember Chloe

1033
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:56,934
- Of course! Hi.

1034
00:43:57,066 --> 00:43:59,834
- Hey. So I hear we're dating.

1035
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:03,100
- That is what Angie tells me.

1036
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:05,233
If that's okay with you.
- Oh, absolutely.

1037
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:07,333
Now I have a cute date
for the Christmas party,

1038
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:09,266
plus Angie said I could stay
in her at the moment for a week

1039
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,800
while she's away
for the summer.

1040
00:44:10,934 --> 00:44:12,967
So honestly,
a couple of days pretending

1041
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,600
is totally worth it for me.
- Okay.

1042
00:44:15,734 --> 00:44:16,900
- Sorry, I know this
is really strange, you guys,

1043
00:44:17,033 --> 00:44:18,133
but it's really
gonna help me out a lot.

1044
00:44:18,266 --> 00:44:20,066
- Yeah.
Are you sure that the reason

1045
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,066
Tyler didn't propose
the other night is me?

1046
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,567
- Yeah. It's crazy, right?

1047
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,667
I mean,
I think he's just--you know,

1048
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,300
we've always been friends.

1049
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:27,767
We'll always be friends.
Till you move to Manhattan

1050
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,233
and you don't call me
for six months.

1051
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,100
- I would never do that!
- But you do.

1052
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:32,900
Anyway, I think that
if you had a girlfriend

1053
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:34,567
he'd be less threatened.
Enter...

1054
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,100
- Chloe!

1055
00:44:36,233 --> 00:44:37,967
Okay, so I'm feeling like,
for the Christmas party,

1056
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,133
we could do a little
matchy-matchy cute

1057
00:44:40,266 --> 00:44:42,433
little color coordination,
and then for New Year's Eve...

1058
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:44,000
- Okay.
- Maybe we could go metallic.

1059
00:44:44,133 --> 00:44:46,000
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.
No, sorry.

1060
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:48,500
I kind of thought this
was, like, only for the week?

1061
00:44:48,633 --> 00:44:50,967
- Oh, we'll see about that.

1062
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,233
- Uh...
- Oh.

1063
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:54,500
- What?
Show me where this goes.

1064
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:57,333
- Okay.
Right this way, boyfriend.

1065
00:44:57,467 --> 00:44:58,633
Can I call you that?

1066
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:00,066
Should I just stick with Ben?
Benny?

1067
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,734
- Ben's fine.
Benji!

1068
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,333
Ah, good thing I took that
improv class last semester!

1069
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:05,700
Right?

1070
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:07,066
- You are getting a kick
out of this, aren't you?

1071
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,533
- So very much.

1072
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:11,967
I can't carry this by myself!

1073
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:12,967
- Ooh.
- All right.

1074
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,667
- Okay, I'm gonna let you...

1075
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,600
- Oh, this looks like
an important one.

1076
00:45:15,734 --> 00:45:17,667
- Front and center.
- Up, like, here?

1077
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,900
- Yeah.

1078
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:20,133
- I didn't even know
they were dating.

1079
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:21,533
- Oh, it's a--it's a new thing.

1080
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:23,533
I don't think it's serious,
Aunt Myrt.

1081
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:25,633
- Oh. Funny.

1082
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:28,200
I always thought you and Ben
would wind up together.

1083
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:29,867
- You too.

1084
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,900
Maybe I need to get us T-shirts
that say "just friends."

1085
00:45:33,533 --> 00:45:36,533
The very best relationships
start out that way.

1086
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:40,567
My late husband was my best
friend before we were married.

1087
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,000
- What's in this guy?

1088
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:45,133
- Oh, be careful with that box.

1089
00:45:45,266 --> 00:45:47,633
Those ornaments are from
my honeymoon in Austria.

1090
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:50,200
Absolutely irreplaceable.

1091
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:53,633
- Okay. I didn't--kid gloves,
Aunt Myrt.

1092
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:58,033
- Oh, you're kidding, right?

1093
00:45:58,166 --> 00:45:59,066
She's kidding, right?

1094
00:46:04,867 --> 00:46:05,934
- Gosh, Mom really needs
all this stuff?

1095
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:08,033
- I know.

1096
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,300
We could probably gift-wrap
the whole town, couldn't we?

1097
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,934
- Yeah, seriously.

1098
00:46:11,066 --> 00:46:12,066
- You know your mom.
She loves this stuff.

1099
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,900
Better too much
than not enough.

1100
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:14,834
- But I thought she was gonna
come with us

1101
00:46:14,967 --> 00:46:18,100
so that we could go
to lunch after.

1102
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,734
- We tend to split up
the errands these days.

1103
00:46:19,867 --> 00:46:21,967
- Well, yeah, I noticed.
What's up with that?

1104
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,734
You two were connected
at the hip all the time.

1105
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:25,700
- You know, Ang,
when you been together

1106
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:27,400
as long as
your mother and I have,

1107
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:28,700
things change.

1108
00:46:28,834 --> 00:46:30,600
Small stuff starts to matter.

1109
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:33,533
She likes romantic comedies,
I like mysteries.

1110
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:35,400
I like going out,
she likes staying in.

1111
00:46:35,533 --> 00:46:36,934
It's to be expected.

1112
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:40,066
So you bend, bargain,
you adjust.

1113
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,967
Did think things would be
a little different, though,

1114
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,467
once you two kids
left the house.

1115
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,467
Get back to being
just us again.

1116
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:49,533
Nothing for you
to worry about, though.

1117
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:50,667
Boop!

1118
00:46:53,033 --> 00:46:53,900
- Are you sure, Dad?

1119
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,633
- You know what, I think
I left my wallet at the store.

1120
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:00,400
I'll be right back, honey.

1121
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:04,467
- How did I not see
this before?

1122
00:47:08,967 --> 00:47:10,834
- Hey, there.

1123
00:47:10,967 --> 00:47:13,934
- God, you have got
to stop doing that.

1124
00:47:14,066 --> 00:47:16,166
- What's going on
with your ticket?

1125
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:20,200
- Ugh.
- Still no?

1126
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:22,033
- Please, you have to help me.

1127
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:26,500
Look, I admit, it was wonderful
at first, a Christmas miracle.

1128
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:28,433
But nothing's what I remember.

1129
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:30,967
I mean,
Kristen and I aren't close,

1130
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,500
and Mom and Dad,
they're drifting apart,

1131
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:36,500
and Tyler hasn't proposed,
Ben is being Ben.

1132
00:47:36,633 --> 00:47:38,367
Please, you have to help me!

1133
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,600
- Well, I'm so sorry,
but it's not up to me.

1134
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,800
Well, will you look at that?

1135
00:47:45,934 --> 00:47:48,266
Shepard's Ferry.

1136
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,333
- Again?

1137
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:52,166
- This is Christmastime.

1138
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,300
Give it a go.

1139
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:02,100
- Tyler, I'm so glad
you made it back

1140
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:03,400
in time for the White Elephant.

1141
00:48:03,533 --> 00:48:04,900
- I'm so happy to be
back for it.

1142
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:05,967
Can someone explain
how this works?

1143
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,300
- Yeah, it's
a White Elephant gift exchange.

1144
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:11,934
- A Reynolds family tradition.
- Yeah, we all bought gifts.

1145
00:48:12,066 --> 00:48:13,667
Silly things, or something
someone's given us,

1146
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,000
and we all open them in turn,

1147
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:16,800
and then--so, we can either
keep what we got,

1148
00:48:16,934 --> 00:48:18,266
or we can trade it
with someone else.

1149
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,066
- Right, until
absolutely no one is happy

1150
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,066
with what they have.

1151
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,667
- You'll get the hang of it.

1152
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,600
But until then, you guys have
to eat some cookies,

1153
00:48:25,734 --> 00:48:26,900
because I've been baking
all day.

1154
00:48:27,033 --> 00:48:28,600
- Nobody bakes like you,
Evelyn.

1155
00:48:28,734 --> 00:48:31,233
- Thank you.

1156
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:35,934
- Here you go.
- Oh, such a provider.

1157
00:48:36,066 --> 00:48:37,934
Oh, isn't my boyfriend
just the sweetest?

1158
00:48:38,066 --> 00:48:39,266
Any day now he's probably

1159
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,266
gonna pop the question,
right, sweetie?

1160
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,266
- I'm learning that pretty much
anything is possible.

1161
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,233
- How about that?

1162
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:49,133
- This is my contribution.
Angie.

1163
00:48:49,266 --> 00:48:51,066
- Thank you, sis.

1164
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:51,867
Mm.

1165
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,100
- Isn't it funny?
- Oh, my gosh.

1166
00:48:57,233 --> 00:48:59,800
Ben, it's the Frosty
the Snowman jewelry box.

1167
00:48:59,934 --> 00:49:01,133
- I thought it was
from Kristen.

1168
00:49:01,266 --> 00:49:03,166
- Oh, I found it in the attic

1169
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,533
when I was pulling down
the ornaments.

1170
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:07,567
Sorry if--
- Oh, no, no, it's--I mean,

1171
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,367
I gave that to Angie,
like, way back when.

1172
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,967
- How long ago?

1173
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:16,533
- Well, here's a hint.
Used to hold my candy jewelry.

1174
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:19,533
- Is that all that's in there?
- Yeah, just the bracelet. Why?

1175
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:22,200
- Okay, who's next?

1176
00:49:24,934 --> 00:49:26,633
- We win.
- We won.

1177
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:29,467
- You know what?
- All right.

1178
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,367
- Almost beat you.

1179
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,367
- Oh! You ladies picked
a bad day for a snowball fight.

1180
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,033
The old flamethrower's
feeling pretty good today.

1181
00:49:37,166 --> 00:49:38,367
- All right, well,
we'll see about that.

1182
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,000
- We will.

1183
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:44,467
- This is your last chance
to back out, ladies.

1184
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,133
- Feel like there should be
some penalty for trash-talking.

1185
00:49:47,266 --> 00:49:48,500
- Yeah.

1186
00:49:48,633 --> 00:49:50,066
- Hey, if it's all right
with you guys,

1187
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,633
I'd like to throw
the first pitch.

1188
00:49:51,767 --> 00:49:53,033
- Ooh, a sports reference.
I love it.

1189
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:58,734
- Here we go. Angie.

1190
00:49:58,867 --> 00:50:00,533
- What is this?

1191
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,333
- Playing that hockey game
was the best thing I ever did.

1192
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:04,367
- You got a concussion.
- Yeah, I did.

1193
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,967
And it brought me right to you.
- Uh-huh.

1194
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:11,667
- Ang, we make a great team.
- Yeah?

1195
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,967
- We're like the Miami Dolphins
in '72.

1196
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,867
- That great, huh?
- That great!

1197
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,166
And I want us to go on forever,
like the Patriots in '07.

1198
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,367
- No, I get it. Me too!
- So?

1199
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,400
- Oh. So--so I think you're
supposed to ask a question.

1200
00:50:24,533 --> 00:50:27,533
- Oh, yeah, right, of course.
- It's happening!

1201
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:28,734
- I spoke to your dad
the other day.

1202
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:31,734
- Aww.
- He's cool with it.

1203
00:50:31,867 --> 00:50:34,133
- And?
- And...

1204
00:50:34,266 --> 00:50:36,333
Angie, will you marry me?

1205
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:38,700
- Yes! Yes, I will!
I thought you'd never ask!

1206
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:43,667
- We're getting married!
- Married!

1207
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,834
- Oh, my God!

1208
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:47,533
All right, hey,
drinks on me, you guys!

1209
00:50:52,433 --> 00:50:54,834
- Hey.

1210
00:50:54,967 --> 00:50:57,367
Um, I just want to say

1211
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,533
all I want
is for you to be happy.

1212
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:03,800
And if that's with Tyler
or whoever, I am there for you.

1213
00:51:03,934 --> 00:51:06,300
I mean, I'll always
be there for you.

1214
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:09,433
- Thanks, Ben.

1215
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,300
- How's your ticket?
No return date?

1216
00:51:12,433 --> 00:51:13,567
- I don't understand.

1217
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,567
Tyler proposed,
but it's still blank.

1218
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,433
- Maybe--
- You guys, it's cold out here!

1219
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:20,734
Come on, let's go celebrate!

1220
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,066
- These newfangled lights.

1221
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,400
Keep burning out faster
than I can keep up with them.

1222
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:30,900
- You sure you don't want me
to do that for you?

1223
00:51:31,033 --> 00:51:32,734
- Yeah, I'm good.
I'm an old hand at this.

1224
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:38,633
- Hey, Mom.
Should Dad be doing that?

1225
00:51:38,767 --> 00:51:42,200
- Have you tried talking
to your father lately?

1226
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:43,333
- I'm worried about you two.

1227
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,800
- Angie, leave it alone.
We're fine, or we will be.

1228
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:48,600
Let's talk about you.
You just got engaged!

1229
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:49,767
- No, don't change the subject!

1230
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,633
I'm serious.
When did this start?

1231
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:54,100
- I don't know.

1232
00:51:54,233 --> 00:51:55,467
With you girls grown and gone,

1233
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,133
we--we had to talk
to each other.

1234
00:51:58,266 --> 00:52:01,700
And I guess,
after all this time,

1235
00:52:01,834 --> 00:52:04,300
we're discovering there isn't
really that much more to say.

1236
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:07,033
- Well, you'd never know it
from this picture.

1237
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:12,667
You guys are so happy here.
Where was this?

1238
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,800
- Aunt Myrt's first
Christmas party.

1239
00:52:14,934 --> 00:52:16,333
It's where I met your father.

1240
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,166
- How did I not know that?
That's where you guys met?

1241
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,433
- Was such a romantic evening.

1242
00:52:20,567 --> 00:52:22,867
Myrt had hired
these Victorian carolers,

1243
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,266
and your father
was so handsome.

1244
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,200
It wasn't just that,
it was the way he looked at me.

1245
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:32,133
- That's cute.
- Yeah.

1246
00:52:32,266 --> 00:52:34,967
We danced by the light
of the Christmas tree,

1247
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,200
all those colors.

1248
00:52:38,934 --> 00:52:41,867
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could turn back the clock

1249
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,667
and do it all over again?

1250
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,300
- Yes. It would.

1251
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,533
Hey.

1252
00:52:53,667 --> 00:52:55,133
Where's my father?
- Oh, he's up there somewhere.

1253
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:56,767
Said he needed
to check something

1254
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,266
on the other side of the house.

1255
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,066
- Well, he's gonna break
his neck one Christmas!

1256
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,533
Oh, wait, no, he's not.
Thank goodness.

1257
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:05,600
- Hey, you know
who needs a break? We do.

1258
00:53:05,734 --> 00:53:06,867
You know, this is all fun,

1259
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,433
but we need some alone time,
you know?

1260
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:13,033
Just the two of us?
Away from everything?

1261
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:14,900
- Oh.

1262
00:53:15,033 --> 00:53:16,767
- I didn't want to bring this
up in front of everyone, but...

1263
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:22,667
- What's that?
- Two tickets to Barcelona.

1264
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,233
- Like, Spain, Barcelona?

1265
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,000
- Say yes and we leave
in the morning.

1266
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:27,600
- But Aunt Myrt's party
is tomorrow,

1267
00:53:27,734 --> 00:53:29,367
and I have been
traveling a lot.

1268
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,934
- That's an annual thing,
you said, right?

1269
00:53:31,066 --> 00:53:32,867
So, you know, does it really
matter if you miss one year?

1270
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,367
- Let me explain.

1271
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,667
So this is, like,
an important family thing.

1272
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,934
- Okay.

1273
00:53:39,066 --> 00:53:40,266
Let me see if I can change
the tickets for the next day,

1274
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,567
if that works?

1275
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,100
We just have to be there
on Christmas.

1276
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:45,767
There's this big soccer match.
- In December?

1277
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,166
- It's a charity thing,
indoors.

1278
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,333
Teams from all over the world.

1279
00:53:49,467 --> 00:53:50,867
The network asked me
to cover it.

1280
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,900
And I said yes,
if they would let me take you.

1281
00:53:54,033 --> 00:53:56,333
- Okay, so this is about work?

1282
00:53:56,467 --> 00:53:58,600
- No. No, no.
This is about us.

1283
00:53:58,734 --> 00:54:00,300
Yes, with some work tossed in,

1284
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:03,500
but this is a chance for us
to celebrate our engagement.

1285
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:07,467
And for me to prove
what I can do.

1286
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,467
Look, Angie,
when we're married,

1287
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,467
this is something
we're gonna have to do a lot.

1288
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,600
You know, I'm gonna
have to cover the stories

1289
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:15,166
wherever they take me.

1290
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,500
- Right.
- And I want you with me.

1291
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:19,300
- What about my career?

1292
00:54:19,433 --> 00:54:20,633
- Yeah, yeah, of course,
there's your career,

1293
00:54:20,767 --> 00:54:22,100
but, you know,
we'll make it work.

1294
00:54:22,233 --> 00:54:24,667
Compromise is both ways.

1295
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,934
So? Huh? What do you say?

1296
00:54:28,066 --> 00:54:29,934
- Um...

1297
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:32,300
- Hey, guys! Somebody grab
that ladder for me?

1298
00:54:32,433 --> 00:54:33,800
- Yep!

1299
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,500
- Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Yep.

1300
00:54:42,633 --> 00:54:44,600
Yes, sir, we are flying out
tomorrow, on Christmas Eve,

1301
00:54:44,734 --> 00:54:46,066
and I've got
the whole crew standing by

1302
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,266
in Barcelona right now.

1303
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,633
- He's very good-looking,
your fiancé.

1304
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:55,467
But is he always so busy?

1305
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,066
- Yeah, work is his passion.

1306
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,200
- Ah. And where do you fit in?

1307
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:01,633
- I know how it looks,
Aunt Myrt,

1308
00:55:01,767 --> 00:55:03,033
but you know I'm gonna be
just as busy

1309
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,967
at the hosp--I mean,
in medical--medical school.

1310
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,533
So, you know,
we'll both be busy.

1311
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:09,633
- And yet, knowing you,

1312
00:55:09,767 --> 00:55:13,867
you will always find the time
for personal life, yes?

1313
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,200
Life is more than work.

1314
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:20,500
- Yeah, it should be.
- But does he feel that way?

1315
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:26,333
- I am so sorry about that.
- No problem.

1316
00:55:26,467 --> 00:55:28,633
Angie's been telling me
all that you've been up to.

1317
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,567
- Oh, yeah.
Well, there's this--

1318
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,300
there's a showcase for the top
European soccer leagues.

1319
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:35,033
Premier League in England,
of course,

1320
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,367
Germany's Bundesliga,
La Liga in Spain.

1321
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,800
- Oh.

1322
00:55:38,934 --> 00:55:41,400
- We've got teams from Italy
and from France.

1323
00:55:41,533 --> 00:55:42,667
And there I go again.

1324
00:55:44,934 --> 00:55:46,200
- So where were we?

1325
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:48,166
- You were about to tell me
why we're meeting.

1326
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,633
- Yes.

1327
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:50,767
- I still have
so many gifts to wrap

1328
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,066
and so much to get done
before the party tonight.

1329
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,633
Or, rather, my staff does.

1330
00:55:56,767 --> 00:55:58,700
- Well, from what I understand,

1331
00:55:58,834 --> 00:56:01,467
my parents actually met at your
very first Christmas party.

1332
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,100
- Yes.
Oh, what a story that was.

1333
00:56:05,233 --> 00:56:08,100
I think it was fate.
You know how some people

1334
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:10,900
just naturally belong together,

1335
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:12,767
and some people--

1336
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,467
- No, I'm just
gonna ignore this. Sorry.

1337
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,367
- Some people, you have to kind
of make it work,

1338
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,734
you know?

1339
00:56:21,867 --> 00:56:23,734
- Yeah. Yeah.
Okay, there it goes again.

1340
00:56:23,867 --> 00:56:25,700
- You know what,
I just--I'm just gonna

1341
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:27,734
very quickly--
I'm so--I'm so sorry.

1342
00:56:27,867 --> 00:56:31,066
Tyler Grant. Yes.

1343
00:56:31,834 --> 00:56:34,600
- Um, I wanted to give them
that night again

1344
00:56:34,734 --> 00:56:36,033
as a Christmas present,

1345
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:38,066
just, like, recreate it
as closely as I can.

1346
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,600
- Oh, what a lovely idea!
How can I help?

1347
00:56:41,734 --> 00:56:43,600
- Well, I made a list of all
the songs that Mom remembers.

1348
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,400
By the way, Mom and Dad have
no idea that I'm doing this.

1349
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:49,200
And I was hoping you could get
those Victorian carolers

1350
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:50,467
that Mom loved so much?

1351
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,700
- After 30 years?

1352
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:56,433
I'll see what I can do.

1353
00:56:56,567 --> 00:56:59,367
But they were not young
when your parents met.

1354
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,667
They're filing
for Medicare now.

1355
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,467
- Oh, gosh.

1356
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,700
- Is there a reason for this?

1357
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:09,800
- I think they could use
a reminder.

1358
00:57:09,934 --> 00:57:12,033
- Of what's special
about Christmas?

1359
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:14,700
- What's special about
their relationship.

1360
00:57:14,834 --> 00:57:17,100
- Angie, you are
a wonderful girl.

1361
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:19,200
- Thanks, Aunt Myrt.

1362
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:22,667
- Older than your years.

1363
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,300
- What do you mean?

1364
00:57:24,433 --> 00:57:26,367
- There's something different
about you this holiday.

1365
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,867
- Oh, yeah?

1366
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,133
- I can't quite
put my finger on it, but...

1367
00:57:31,266 --> 00:57:33,133
it's a confidence.

1368
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,166
- It's probably the cake.

1369
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,433
Tyler, you're such a dear

1370
00:57:41,567 --> 00:57:43,467
for carrying those
to the car for me.

1371
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,300
- It's no problem at all.
- Good. Good. Here's the keys.

1372
00:57:47,433 --> 00:57:48,533
- Oh, thank you.

1373
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:49,467
- It's the white one
right down there.

1374
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,467
- Got it.
- And if you wouldn't mind?

1375
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,934
Thank you so much.
- Oh, not at all.

1376
00:57:54,066 --> 00:57:55,967
It's no problem. Okay.

1377
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,133
- Thank you so much
for doing this, Aunt Myrt.

1378
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:59,200
- Oh, Aunt Myrt.

1379
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:02,433
Oh, my God, I love that so
much. I always have.

1380
00:58:02,567 --> 00:58:05,333
You know,
family means everything.

1381
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:07,000
Even if it's this town.

1382
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:09,734
The family you choose, right?
- Yeah.

1383
00:58:09,867 --> 00:58:11,867
- See you tonight.
- Yeah, okay, tonight.

1384
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,033
Hey.

1385
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:17,600
- Hey.
- You going to lunch?

1386
00:58:17,734 --> 00:58:19,266
- I'm getting sandwiches
for the elves.

1387
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,000
Apparently, they can't live
on candy canes alone.

1388
00:58:22,133 --> 00:58:23,367
- No, I don't
suppose they could.

1389
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,333
- Are you alone?
The boyfriend desert you?

1390
00:58:25,467 --> 00:58:26,333
- No.
- No?

1391
00:58:26,467 --> 00:58:28,533
Don't tell me you broke up.

1392
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:30,734
- He's helping Aunt Myrt
with some packages, okay?

1393
00:58:30,867 --> 00:58:33,533
- What a regular Boy Scout.

1394
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:35,333
Do you have any plans
to go back?

1395
00:58:35,467 --> 00:58:38,266
And by "go back," I mean,
like, you know...

1396
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,367
really go back?

1397
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,533
- I'm working on it.
- Okay.

1398
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:44,000
Well, hey,
if you happen to remember

1399
00:58:44,133 --> 00:58:46,166
any winning lottery numbers
before you go...

1400
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,867
- That's a great idea.

1401
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,333
Hey, Ben,
if you could go back in time,

1402
00:58:51,467 --> 00:58:53,133
is there anything
that you would change?

1403
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:59,000
- Yeah, maybe one thing.
- Really? What is it?

1404
00:58:59,133 --> 00:59:00,934
- It's personal.
- Oh.

1405
00:59:01,066 --> 00:59:03,900
- Yeah. Between me and Frosty.
So...

1406
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:04,700
I'll see you around.

1407
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,100
- Frosty?
No wonder he's single.

1408
00:59:14,367 --> 00:59:15,900
- You really think
your plan will work?

1409
00:59:16,033 --> 00:59:17,133
Will they even remember?

1410
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:18,633
- It has to,
or in eight years...

1411
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:20,467
- What's gonna happen
in eight years?

1412
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,800
That's freakily specific.

1413
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:25,133
- It's statistics,
because once you see the cracks

1414
00:59:25,266 --> 00:59:28,400
in a marriage,
bad things happen.

1415
00:59:28,533 --> 00:59:30,500
- You've been acting very odd
this whole trip.

1416
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:33,166
- Oh, have I?

1417
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,633
- Oh, I see what's happening.

1418
00:59:34,767 --> 00:59:36,333
- You do?

1419
00:59:36,467 --> 00:59:39,166
- You're working too hard.
It's the stress of med school.

1420
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,433
- Yep. Yep. You figured it out.
You're so good.

1421
00:59:42,567 --> 00:59:46,333
- Okay, sport. You're ready.
My turn.

1422
00:59:46,467 --> 00:59:49,133
- Oh!
- Oh.

1423
00:59:49,266 --> 00:59:51,133
- Who's ready for somewhere
holiday cheer?

1424
00:59:51,266 --> 00:59:54,600
- Looking like that, I'd guess
every woman in Shepard's Ferry.

1425
00:59:54,734 --> 00:59:56,433
- I've never felt
more underdressed in my life.

1426
00:59:56,567 --> 00:59:57,934
- Oh, no rush.

1427
00:59:58,066 --> 01:00:00,433
I always like to be
camera-ready just in case.

1428
01:00:00,567 --> 01:00:02,100
So what's the plan?

1429
01:00:02,233 --> 01:00:03,400
- I'm gonna finish
getting ready.

1430
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:04,433
You're gonna go ahead
with everyone else,

1431
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:06,467
and I'll come later with Mom.

1432
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,734
- She won't be suspicious
we're going separately?

1433
01:00:07,867 --> 01:00:10,333
- Nope.
Not the way I have it planned.

1434
01:00:10,467 --> 01:00:13,100
- Oh!
- How you doing, Mom?

1435
01:00:13,233 --> 01:00:15,633
- I cannot find the dress
I was supposed to wear tonight.

1436
01:00:15,767 --> 01:00:18,400
- Oh, maybe you sent it
to the cleaners.

1437
01:00:18,533 --> 01:00:20,266
- I did, but I am sure
I got it back,

1438
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,834
and I have no idea
what happened to it!

1439
01:00:23,967 --> 01:00:26,900
- Yeah. That is very odd.

1440
01:00:27,033 --> 01:00:28,834
Why don't you wear
something else?

1441
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:31,767
- I have nothing that's
appropriate or fancy enough.

1442
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,633
- I have an idea.

1443
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,100
Huh?
- Angie, that's 35 years old.

1444
01:00:38,233 --> 01:00:39,266
- It's perfect.

1445
01:00:42,934 --> 01:00:44,033
You're gonna
look stunning in it.

1446
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:47,200
You wear that tonight, you will
be the hit of the party.

1447
01:00:52,266 --> 01:00:53,433
all:

1448
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,734
- Thank you.

1449
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,934
Isn't this incredible?
She always outdoes herself.

1450
01:01:05,066 --> 01:01:07,500
- Merry Christmas, one and all!

1451
01:01:07,633 --> 01:01:09,934
Oh, I'm so happy to see you!

1452
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:11,867
- Hi, Myrt.
- Oh.

1453
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,567
George, you look as young
and as handsome

1454
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,567
as the first time we met.

1455
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,934
- You are too kind.

1456
01:01:19,066 --> 01:01:20,700
Wait a minute, are these the
carolers, the same ones from...

1457
01:01:20,834 --> 01:01:24,266
- Some of them, yes!
From the very first party.

1458
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,533
And you remembered?
Oh, they're just wonderful.

1459
01:01:29,667 --> 01:01:31,934
Tyler, it's so good
to see you again.

1460
01:01:32,066 --> 01:01:33,900
- Oh, it's good to see you too.
Thank you for including me.

1461
01:01:34,033 --> 01:01:35,367
- And without your phone.

1462
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:39,500
- I got dressed!

1463
01:01:39,633 --> 01:01:41,800
- You most certainly did!

1464
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:46,834
And I have a surprise
for you, young man.

1465
01:01:46,967 --> 01:01:48,533
Why don't you go
and have a look

1466
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:53,500
at the very special centerpiece
in the dining room?

1467
01:01:53,633 --> 01:01:57,000
- We don't run in
the house, Henrik.

1468
01:01:57,133 --> 01:01:58,700
- Where are Evelyn and Angie?

1469
01:01:58,834 --> 01:02:00,300
- Oh, they'll--
they'll be along.

1470
01:02:00,433 --> 01:02:02,333
- Yeah, something about
a dress mix-up or something.

1471
01:02:02,467 --> 01:02:03,967
- Well, in that case,

1472
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:07,033
you two will be my arm candy
till they get here.

1473
01:02:10,233 --> 01:02:12,734
- Wow!
That is quite the spread.

1474
01:02:12,867 --> 01:02:14,066
- Wow.
- That's my house! Look!

1475
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,500
- We see! How about that?

1476
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:19,266
- You know, I thought
that looked familiar.

1477
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,667
Kid's a natural.

1478
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,333
- Quite the honor.

1479
01:02:22,467 --> 01:02:25,100
No wonder we all love
that woman.

1480
01:02:25,233 --> 01:02:26,734
- Another winner, Myrt.
Just like always.

1481
01:02:26,867 --> 01:02:28,266
- Thank you.

1482
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,433
I look forward to this party
every single year.

1483
01:02:32,567 --> 01:02:35,500
Tyler, do you know
George actually met Evelyn

1484
01:02:35,633 --> 01:02:37,600
here, didn't you, George?

1485
01:02:37,734 --> 01:02:39,100
- As a matter of fact,
I did, yeah.

1486
01:02:39,233 --> 01:02:40,667
You know what,

1487
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,000
I think I was standing
right here at the time too.

1488
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,233
- Good memories?

1489
01:02:43,367 --> 01:02:44,834
- Now that I think about it,
the best.

1490
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:46,900
It was a lonely holiday for me,
if you remember,

1491
01:02:47,033 --> 01:02:49,000
and I--about to spend
another Christmas alone.

1492
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:50,800
I was saying goodbye
to everybody.

1493
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:55,600
Clock struck 9:00,
and I remember turning.

1494
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,333
And there she was.

1495
01:03:11,133 --> 01:03:16,000
- George Reynolds,
have you met Evelyn Marshall?

1496
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:18,633
- I don't believe I've had
the pleasure. Evelyn is it?

1497
01:03:18,767 --> 01:03:20,400
- Yes, Mr. Reynolds.

1498
01:03:20,533 --> 01:03:23,133
- Please call me George,
or I'm afraid I won't answer.

1499
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,300
- You look gorgeous.

1500
01:03:25,433 --> 01:03:26,266
- Can you believe that this
is the dress

1501
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,533
I wore the day that I met you?
- I know!

1502
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:33,133
You're still the prettiest girl
in the room.

1503
01:03:33,266 --> 01:03:34,333
In any room.

1504
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:36,200
- You're not so bad yourself.

1505
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:41,300
- Hey.

1506
01:03:41,433 --> 01:03:42,900
- You look beautiful.

1507
01:03:43,033 --> 01:03:45,700
- Aw. Thanks, Ben.

1508
01:03:45,834 --> 01:03:48,066
- Looks like the spark
is alive and well.

1509
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,467
Good work.

1510
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,000
- Thanks.

1511
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:58,900
- Tyler Grant.

1512
01:03:59,033 --> 01:04:04,767
- Attention, everybody.
Thank you.

1513
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:08,567
I would like to welcome you all
to my annual Christmas party.

1514
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,467
Now, I'm not one for speeches,
and you all know that.

1515
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:16,133
But tonight, I would like
to propose a toast.

1516
01:04:16,266 --> 01:04:19,100
Our dear, dear friend
Angie Reynolds--

1517
01:04:19,233 --> 01:04:22,934
come here, Angie.

1518
01:04:23,066 --> 01:04:25,467
Angie has come back to us
tonight from medical school,

1519
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,800
and she brought with her
her fiancé, Mr. Tyler Grant.

1520
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,800
Where is he?

1521
01:04:43,033 --> 01:04:44,900
- Absolutely. Sure.
All right.

1522
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:46,967
All right. Bye-bye.

1523
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:48,734
Hey.
- Hey.

1524
01:04:48,867 --> 01:04:50,900
You missed
Aunt Myrt's speech to us.

1525
01:04:51,033 --> 01:04:53,633
- Oh, shoot!
Let me make it up to you.

1526
01:04:53,767 --> 01:04:56,100
I'm gonna grab us some wine,
and we can have our own toast.

1527
01:04:56,233 --> 01:04:59,467
- Tyler, this is a really
important night for us.

1528
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,600
- It's just family, you know?
They understand.

1529
01:05:01,734 --> 01:05:03,934
- Just family?
- Don't move.

1530
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:07,367
I will be right back.
- Ugh.

1531
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,667
Hey.
- Hey. You okay?

1532
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,533
- Honestly, I don't know.

1533
01:05:26,967 --> 01:05:29,500
Thanks.

1534
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:32,867
Where's Chloe?

1535
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
- Oh, that is a tragic
Hollywood story.

1536
01:05:35,133 --> 01:05:37,300
Boy meets girl.
Boy fake dates girl.

1537
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:38,934
Bought and girl fake break up.

1538
01:05:39,066 --> 01:05:41,633
- Aww. I'm so fake sorry
to hear that.

1539
01:05:41,767 --> 01:05:43,967
- I appreciate it.

1540
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,500
But her father
has a law firm in Boston.

1541
01:05:47,633 --> 01:05:50,200
Mergers and acquisitions.
It's big time.

1542
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:53,000
And I get my degree in a year,

1543
01:05:53,133 --> 01:05:55,633
and she said she's gonna put
in a good word for me. So...

1544
01:05:55,767 --> 01:05:58,533
- No, Ben, family law is where
your heart's always been.

1545
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:01,900
- I kind of feel like my
heart's always been...

1546
01:06:02,033 --> 01:06:05,000
somewhere else.

1547
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:07,166
- Angie, come on in!
You have to see this!

1548
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,300
- Oh.

1549
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,700
- That was beautiful.

1550
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:45,200
- Look! This is a cow.

1551
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:47,400
This is a hen.
This is a horse.

1552
01:06:47,533 --> 01:06:48,934
This is a pig...

1553
01:06:51,467 --> 01:06:53,734
- We're gonna be okay.

1554
01:06:53,867 --> 01:06:55,433
- I hope so.

1555
01:07:05,734 --> 01:07:07,333
- Let's go.

1556
01:07:08,767 --> 01:07:11,200
- We haven't danced like this
in years.

1557
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:19,433
- No time has passed at all.

1558
01:07:19,567 --> 01:07:23,000
- I'm afraid we've forgotten
how to connect.

1559
01:07:23,133 --> 01:07:24,834
- Just didn't know how to talk
to you about it.

1560
01:07:24,967 --> 01:07:29,300
And you know how hard it is
for me to open up. I'm sorry.

1561
01:07:29,433 --> 01:07:32,734
- Don't be sorry.
It's no one's fault.

1562
01:07:32,867 --> 01:07:34,934
Just, relationships
need tending,

1563
01:07:35,066 --> 01:07:38,333
and we haven't been
paying attention.

1564
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:41,300
- We can still fix that,
though, right?

1565
01:07:41,433 --> 01:07:43,800
- If we want to. I do.

1566
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:45,600
- I do too.

1567
01:07:48,867 --> 01:07:50,934
- I've missed you so much.

1568
01:07:51,066 --> 01:07:53,600
- You give me another chance,

1569
01:07:53,734 --> 01:07:55,834
and you'll never have
to miss me again.

1570
01:08:03,133 --> 01:08:05,734
- I want a relationship
like that.

1571
01:08:05,867 --> 01:08:08,967
- You have it all, Kristen.
I hope you know that.

1572
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:13,333
- And I'm so grateful
for Peter, for Henrik.

1573
01:08:16,667 --> 01:08:21,166
We've decided not to pursue
the IVF anymore.

1574
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:24,367
After a year of disappointment,

1575
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,000
we can't go through it again.

1576
01:08:27,133 --> 01:08:30,066
- Oh, Kristen.

1577
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,400
Is it the money?
- We're just tired.

1578
01:08:32,533 --> 01:08:36,967
The whole process
is so stressful.

1579
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:41,633
If it's meant to be,
it'll happen.

1580
01:08:41,767 --> 01:08:44,467
- Can I offer you some advice,
sister to sister?

1581
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,133
There are other options.

1582
01:08:47,266 --> 01:08:49,233
We never know
what the future holds.

1583
01:08:49,367 --> 01:08:52,400
Well, as it happens, I do,
and I happen to know

1584
01:08:52,533 --> 01:08:55,233
that there is a very special
little girl out there

1585
01:08:55,367 --> 01:08:56,834
waiting for you and Peter.

1586
01:08:56,967 --> 01:09:02,600
May take a few years,
but she will be worth the wait.

1587
01:09:02,734 --> 01:09:06,700
- I actually believe you.
Thanks for that.

1588
01:09:06,834 --> 01:09:09,033
- I'm really sorry, Kristen.

1589
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:11,567
I'm sorry I didn't know--
that I didn't ask.

1590
01:09:15,266 --> 01:09:17,500
- Hanging with you this week
has actually been fun.

1591
01:09:20,367 --> 01:09:23,533
Maybe because things
have been so hard.

1592
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:26,200
- Yeah.
I'm gonna visit more, okay?

1593
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:28,600
Henrik's growing way too fast.

1594
01:09:28,734 --> 01:09:31,200
- Please, just a phone call
once in a while, or...

1595
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,533
- I get it.
- Email.

1596
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:33,700
- I get it.
- Text.

1597
01:09:33,834 --> 01:09:34,767
- I'm gonna text you.

1598
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:35,967
- Or carrier pigeon.

1599
01:09:39,533 --> 01:09:40,900
- You know what the best part
of this Christmas is?

1600
01:09:41,033 --> 01:09:42,467
- Tyler's proposal?

1601
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:46,767
- You and me, here, right now.

1602
01:09:49,867 --> 01:09:51,500
- Me too.

1603
01:09:56,667 --> 01:10:00,100
- Between me and Frosty?

1604
01:10:00,233 --> 01:10:03,700
Do you know
what that means, Boomer?

1605
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:04,934
Hmm.

1606
01:10:09,367 --> 01:10:11,734
Hey. What did he mean by that?

1607
01:10:11,867 --> 01:10:15,467
- Why are you asking me?
I don't know the man.

1608
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,800
- So Ben,
always talking in riddles,

1609
01:10:17,934 --> 01:10:20,266
it's very frustrating.

1610
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,066
- Friends a long time,
I take it.

1611
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,867
- Oh, yeah, since grade school.

1612
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,033
I mean, until I moved
to Manhattan,

1613
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:26,133
we did everything together.

1614
01:10:26,266 --> 01:10:27,700
We took family
vacations together,

1615
01:10:27,834 --> 01:10:29,233
shared our plans
for our future,

1616
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:30,700
we finished
each other's sentences.

1617
01:10:30,834 --> 01:10:32,934
I mean, it was--
- Ah.

1618
01:10:33,066 --> 01:10:36,600
- Actually, it was
kind of wonderful.

1619
01:10:36,734 --> 01:10:40,800
- But now there's Tyler.

1620
01:10:40,934 --> 01:10:44,800
- Right. Tyler.
- Yeah.

1621
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,967
- If it wasn't Tyler,
if it wasn't Mom and Dad,

1622
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,800
and it wasn't Kristen,
what is it, Boomer?

1623
01:11:12,934 --> 01:11:14,200
If I don't figure
this out soon,

1624
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:16,700
I'm gonna be stuck here
forever.

1625
01:11:16,834 --> 01:11:18,433
Yes?
- Hey, sleepyhead.

1626
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:19,867
Get up.
Get dressed.

1627
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,800
We got a taxi on the way.

1628
01:11:21,934 --> 01:11:22,934
Barcelona?

1629
01:11:23,066 --> 01:11:25,633
- Right. Okay. Right. Okay.

1630
01:11:25,767 --> 01:11:26,900
- Nice PJs.

1631
01:11:29,233 --> 01:11:30,734
Hey, is everything okay?

1632
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,834
- I don't know.
I don't think so.

1633
01:11:37,767 --> 01:11:40,367
- You're not going.

1634
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,100
- You're an amazing man.
- Oh, no.

1635
01:11:42,233 --> 01:11:44,867
Nothing good ever
followed a sentence like that.

1636
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,467
Look, if the timing's
not right,

1637
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,367
we could take a break.
- Oh.

1638
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,500
- You have your school.
I can focus on the career.

1639
01:11:51,633 --> 01:11:53,000
You know, we'll put this
on hold a while.

1640
01:11:53,133 --> 01:11:54,367
- Yeah, we could do that.

1641
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,867
We could, but it wouldn't work.

1642
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,800
- How do you know?
- I know.

1643
01:11:57,934 --> 01:12:02,900
And knowing what I know,
I can't marry you.

1644
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,700
- You can't marry me.
- I'm so sorry.

1645
01:12:07,834 --> 01:12:09,500
For the longest time,
I thought you were the one.

1646
01:12:09,633 --> 01:12:12,900
I thought--I thought
if I just said yes,

1647
01:12:13,033 --> 01:12:14,333
then my life would be perfect.

1648
01:12:14,467 --> 01:12:17,200
- It would be! Angie!
- No, I was wrong.

1649
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,700
Aunt Myrt said it.

1650
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,767
You know, some people,
they just belong together.

1651
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:24,834
That isn't us.
We're not a match.

1652
01:12:24,967 --> 01:12:27,166
I guess we never were.

1653
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:29,700
- I really thought we were it.

1654
01:12:29,834 --> 01:12:32,600
- That's what makes this
so hard.

1655
01:12:32,734 --> 01:12:35,867
You deserve a woman
who loves you just as much.

1656
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,533
You have such
an incredible life ahead,

1657
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:39,000
and an incredible woman
to meet.

1658
01:12:39,133 --> 01:12:40,600
- I don't want to meet
an incredible woman.

1659
01:12:40,734 --> 01:12:42,700
I want you!

1660
01:12:42,834 --> 01:12:44,700
Okay, that didn't
come out right.

1661
01:12:44,834 --> 01:12:47,500
- It's fine.
Really, it's gonna be okay.

1662
01:12:47,633 --> 01:12:49,000
Now go.

1663
01:12:49,133 --> 01:12:50,734
Don't miss your plane,
or your taxi.

1664
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:58,233
- Bye.

1665
01:13:08,934 --> 01:13:13,600
all:

1666
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,467
- Do you girls remember coming
here when you were little?

1667
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,333
Every Christmas Eve,
how excited you get,

1668
01:13:32,467 --> 01:13:33,934
waiting for them to light
the star on top of the tree?

1669
01:13:34,066 --> 01:13:35,300
- We loved it.

1670
01:13:35,433 --> 01:13:36,934
- But we were so nervous
that we would miss Santa

1671
01:13:37,066 --> 01:13:38,734
and he wouldn't be able
to find us. Remember?

1672
01:13:38,867 --> 01:13:41,500
- We always did.
- Yeah.

1673
01:13:41,633 --> 01:13:44,233
- I love you guys so much.

1674
01:13:44,367 --> 01:13:46,600
I hope all your Christmas
wishes come true.

1675
01:13:46,734 --> 01:13:48,433
I know mine has.

1676
01:13:57,367 --> 01:14:00,066
- Can you feel it?
- Feel what, Grandpa?

1677
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,500
- It's coming. You'll see.

1678
01:14:02,633 --> 01:14:05,100
- It's getting close.
- Yeah, it's about time.

1679
01:14:10,934 --> 01:14:12,900
- Gets me every time.
Every time!

1680
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,800
- I always knew this
was my favorite Christmas.

1681
01:14:19,934 --> 01:14:22,066
Just...

1682
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,333
never knew why
until this moment.

1683
01:14:24,467 --> 01:14:25,834
- Honey, what are
you talking about?

1684
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:27,033
- Just, you know,

1685
01:14:27,166 --> 01:14:28,734
I've been focusing too much
on things

1686
01:14:28,867 --> 01:14:30,533
that don't matter
in the long run,

1687
01:14:30,667 --> 01:14:32,967
when this whole time,
everything I needed

1688
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,200
was just a short
train ride away.

1689
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:36,633
My family.

1690
01:14:36,767 --> 01:14:39,400
- Well, you got us, sweetheart.
You always will.

1691
01:14:39,533 --> 01:14:42,033
- What more could I ask for?
- Hot chocolate, maybe?

1692
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:43,800
- Mmm.
- Who's up for it?

1693
01:14:43,934 --> 01:14:45,800
- On me. Let's see hands.

1694
01:14:45,934 --> 01:14:49,033
- Me!
- Come on with me, sport.

1695
01:14:49,166 --> 01:14:50,900
You can pay for it.
You got a 20 on you?

1696
01:14:54,867 --> 01:14:57,400
- So I wish it had worked out
for you this trip.

1697
01:14:57,533 --> 01:14:58,567
Tyler and all.

1698
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:01,467
- Thanks.
We weren't meant to be.

1699
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,300
Took me a while to realize
that, but so clear now.

1700
01:15:06,433 --> 01:15:10,367
There's nothing more
I could ask for this Christmas.

1701
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,633
- Really?

1702
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,600
Well, how about this?

1703
01:15:14,734 --> 01:15:17,900
I found this at the bottom
of that jewelry box.

1704
01:15:18,033 --> 01:15:18,800
I thought it would only
complicate things

1705
01:15:18,934 --> 01:15:19,867
with you and Tyler,

1706
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,133
but now you need to see this.

1707
01:15:22,266 --> 01:15:23,433
- "Between me and Frosty."

1708
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:26,567
Is that what
he was talking about?

1709
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:29,467
"You have my whole heart,
Angie. You always have.

1710
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,900
And no matter where life takes
us, that will never change."

1711
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:36,133
- My turn for some
sisterly advice?

1712
01:15:36,266 --> 01:15:38,567
Tyler wasn't your forever.

1713
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,767
Ben is, and you love Ben.

1714
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,600
- Ben.

1715
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,233
I love Ben.

1716
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:51,033
I love Ben!

1717
01:15:51,166 --> 01:15:52,266
- The rest of us
have known for years.

1718
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,934
I'm surprised it took you
this long to figure that out.

1719
01:15:59,266 --> 01:16:03,967
- All aboard!
- That's it!

1720
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:05,533
- What?
- Oh, my gosh! It wasn't you.

1721
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:07,333
It wasn't Mom and Dad.
It wasn't even Ben.

1722
01:16:07,467 --> 01:16:08,266
It was everyone!
It was the whole package!

1723
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,867
It was the entire Christmas!

1724
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,767
I have to go.
- Go where? Angie, wait!

1725
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,200
- I have to find Ben!

1726
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:15,467
- Well, he's probably still
at Santa's Village!

1727
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,533
- Santa's Village!

1728
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,100
- North Pole! Merry Christmas!

1729
01:16:26,233 --> 01:16:28,367
- Hey, Ben, it's Angie.

1730
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,600
Listen, the return ticket
is back!

1731
01:16:29,734 --> 01:16:31,633
I'm leaving tonight.
I mean, right now!

1732
01:16:31,767 --> 01:16:33,333
- Tonight? Why?
- Look, listen to me.

1733
01:16:33,467 --> 01:16:34,633
I got the note, you know,

1734
01:16:34,767 --> 01:16:36,433
the one Frosty
was keeping from me.

1735
01:16:36,567 --> 01:16:37,700
- I thought you read that
years ago.

1736
01:16:37,834 --> 01:16:39,467
- No, I never did.

1737
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,433
That's why I didn't know
how you felt--how you feel.

1738
01:16:41,567 --> 01:16:43,600
Oh, gosh. I really hope
you still feel that way.

1739
01:16:43,734 --> 01:16:46,166
Wait a second,
I'm just gonna say it.

1740
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:49,133
I love you, Ben. I always have.
I guess it just took me

1741
01:16:49,266 --> 01:16:51,867
a little Christmas magic
to realize it.

1742
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,834
- Where are you?
- The train is back.

1743
01:16:54,967 --> 01:16:57,767
- No, I'll be right there.

1744
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:00,433
- We'll be pulling out soon.

1745
01:17:00,567 --> 01:17:02,834
- Oh, no, no, no.
We can't--we can't leave yet.

1746
01:17:02,967 --> 01:17:05,133
- I'm afraid I'm not in charge
of the schedule.

1747
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,000
- Angie, I'm on my way
right now.

1748
01:17:09,133 --> 01:17:10,600
- The train is leaving!

1749
01:17:10,734 --> 01:17:12,000
- I haven't had a chance
to tell you--

1750
01:17:12,133 --> 01:17:14,000
- Wait, Ben, please.

1751
01:17:14,133 --> 01:17:17,166
Don't take Chloe's offer, okay?
It won't make you happy.

1752
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,700
Your heart is too big
for that job.

1753
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:21,033
- Well, when am I gonna
see you again?

1754
01:17:21,166 --> 01:17:23,033
- I don't know.

1755
01:17:23,166 --> 01:17:25,066
Wait, tonight.

1756
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,266
Christmas Eve,
ten years from now,

1757
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,200
I'll meet you
at the Hamilton Inn at 10:00.

1758
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:31,300
I'll be there waiting.
Merry Christmas.

1759
01:17:31,433 --> 01:17:34,467
- Angie.

1760
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,033
- Chop chop. Ticket, please.

1761
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:38,433
- Oh.

1762
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:45,066
- Well, there you are.

1763
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,734
Worth the wait, I hope.

1764
01:17:49,533 --> 01:17:51,266
- Do we have to leave now?

1765
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,233
- Better find a seat.

1766
01:17:58,767 --> 01:17:59,800
- Come on. Come on.

1767
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,266
- Have I been sitting here
this whole time?

1768
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,100
- Yeah.

1769
01:19:07,233 --> 01:19:08,767
- Oh. Okay.

1770
01:19:18,233 --> 01:19:19,500
Mom?

1771
01:19:19,633 --> 01:19:21,467
- Oh, honey, I'm so glad
we caught you.

1772
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,934
It's Christmas Eve, you know,
and we wanted to wish you

1773
01:19:23,066 --> 01:19:23,934
a Merry Christmas.

1774
01:19:24,066 --> 01:19:24,967
The whole family's here.

1775
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,967
Come on, you guys. Say hello.

1776
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,133
all: Merry Christmas!

1777
01:19:29,266 --> 01:19:32,233
- Hi. Hey, where's Dad? Daddy?

1778
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:33,834
- Right here.
I'm on hot cider duty.

1779
01:19:33,967 --> 01:19:35,567
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1780
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:38,300
- You're there.
You're--you're home.

1781
01:19:38,433 --> 01:19:41,166
- At Christmas? You bet I am.

1782
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,667
- And you haven't met
this one yet.

1783
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,900
Not officially.
This is our Vanessa.

1784
01:19:45,033 --> 01:19:47,100
- Oh, my gosh, Kristen,
is she yours?

1785
01:19:47,233 --> 01:19:48,300
- Thanks to Ben.

1786
01:19:48,433 --> 01:19:50,600
- Wait. Ben Lee?

1787
01:19:50,734 --> 01:19:52,066
- Yeah, of course,
who else would it be?

1788
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,066
- Cut through all the red tape.

1789
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,500
- Ben.

1790
01:19:55,633 --> 01:19:57,600
- And the question is,
when are you coming home

1791
01:19:57,734 --> 01:20:00,266
to meet your new niece?
- Yeah!

1792
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,567
- Hey, Christmas is tomorrow,
Aunt Angie. Just saying.

1793
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,800
- Hi, Henrik.
You know what, I don't know.

1794
01:20:04,934 --> 01:20:06,734
I have to check
with the hospital.

1795
01:20:06,867 --> 01:20:09,133
- Okay, well, your room's
always open.

1796
01:20:09,266 --> 01:20:10,734
- Of course I have
all my pottery things in there,

1797
01:20:10,867 --> 01:20:12,400
but I can clear them out
in a snap!

1798
01:20:12,533 --> 01:20:14,567
- Oh, hey, Mom,
this is the hospital calling.

1799
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,667
I have to go, but I'll see
what I can do, okay?

1800
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,100
Merry Christmas!
I love you all!

1801
01:20:18,233 --> 01:20:19,800
- Love you! Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

1802
01:20:19,934 --> 01:20:21,967
- Hurry home!

1803
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:23,800
- Hey, Sabrina.
- About time.

1804
01:20:23,934 --> 01:20:26,133
We've been trying to reach you.
I hope you're on your way.

1805
01:20:26,266 --> 01:20:27,500
- Oh, no, is something wrong?

1806
01:20:27,633 --> 01:20:29,000
- Haven't you checked
your messages?

1807
01:20:29,133 --> 01:20:30,500
The whole team is waiting.

1808
01:20:30,633 --> 01:20:32,133
You're on call tonight,
remember?

1809
01:20:32,266 --> 01:20:35,300
Okay, look, we can do the prep,
but the rest is up to you.

1810
01:20:35,433 --> 01:20:38,100
- Right. Right. Of course.
Yeah, I'll be right there.

1811
01:20:48,133 --> 01:20:51,266
Oh, my gosh, I'm exhausted.

1812
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,767
- At least you have all day
to catch up tomorrow.

1813
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:55,166
No surgeries scheduled
for Christmas.

1814
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:57,433
- Yeah.
- Any plans?

1815
01:20:57,567 --> 01:20:59,767
- Yeah, actually.
I think I'm gonna go home.

1816
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:03,066
- To your family? What changed?

1817
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,367
- So much.

1818
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,834
Wait a second.

1819
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:09,734
Tomorrow's Christmas.
This is Christmas Eve!

1820
01:21:09,867 --> 01:21:12,633
- Whoa, okay, sharp as ever.
You have some place to be?

1821
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:14,000
- What time is it?

1822
01:21:14,133 --> 01:21:15,367
- It's late,
a little past 11:00.

1823
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,000
- Shoot, I'm late!

1824
01:21:17,133 --> 01:21:18,533
- Okay, you have plans.

1825
01:21:18,667 --> 01:21:21,133
- Plans I made ten years ago.
Help me with this dress.

1826
01:21:21,266 --> 01:21:23,000
- Oh, my God.

1827
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,066
- Hi. Oh, are you closing?

1828
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,600
- Christmas Eve.
Not a big night for business.

1829
01:21:36,133 --> 01:21:38,934
- Oh, my gosh. I'm too late.

1830
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,867
After all this time,
I'm too late.

1831
01:21:50,867 --> 01:21:53,834
Hello? Hi.

1832
01:21:53,967 --> 01:21:56,734
Hey, Ben, oh, my God,
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1833
01:21:56,867 --> 01:21:59,066
Wait a second,
how did you get my new number?

1834
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,400
- The salads are getting cold,
but at least you're here now.

1835
01:22:02,533 --> 01:22:04,633
- I'm here?

1836
01:22:10,333 --> 01:22:12,266
- You waited.

1837
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,734
- What's an hour or two?

1838
01:22:13,867 --> 01:22:16,100
- Compared to ten years?
- Okay, now you lost me.

1839
01:22:16,233 --> 01:22:18,934
- No, I found you.

1840
01:22:25,867 --> 01:22:27,900
- Wow. That was some kiss.

1841
01:22:28,033 --> 01:22:30,266
You'd think I haven't
seen you in weeks.

1842
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:33,000
- When was the last time
I saw you?

1843
01:22:35,433 --> 01:22:39,467
- Um, Tuesday dinner.
With David and his wife.

1844
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,734
- David.
- Yes, David.

1845
01:22:41,867 --> 01:22:43,433
- That's right.
- Yeah.

1846
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:44,633
My partner at the law firm,
David.

1847
01:22:44,767 --> 01:22:47,033
- Yes, family law.
- Yes.

1848
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:49,200
You love taking credit
for that, don't you?

1849
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:51,200
- Oh, my gosh,
it's all coming back to me.

1850
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:52,633
- Okay.
You know what I think you need?

1851
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:55,867
Aside from some serious
time off work?

1852
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,200
Some champagne.

1853
01:22:58,333 --> 01:23:00,600
Here's to another year
of friendship,

1854
01:23:00,734 --> 01:23:04,800
another year of romance,
another year with you.

1855
01:23:04,934 --> 01:23:07,867
I love you. Merry Christmas.

1856
01:23:10,266 --> 01:23:13,633
- The best Christmas gift ever.

1857
01:23:13,767 --> 01:23:16,967
- Well, that might make this
a little anticlimactic.

1858
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,033
- Oh, is it
my favorite spaghetti?

1859
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:20,767
- Thank you.

1860
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,800
Voila!

1861
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,367
- The Frosty box?
- Mm-hmm.

1862
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,200
- Oh, Ben.

1863
01:23:39,166 --> 01:23:43,567
- Angie Reynolds,
will you finally marry me?

1864
01:23:46,567 --> 01:23:48,000
- Yes!

1865
01:23:51,133 --> 01:23:53,066
- No taking it back.

1866
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:01,767
- Well, one thing this proves.

1867
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:03,166
- Good things are worth
waiting for?

1868
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,100
- My family's gonna be
so surprised.

1869
01:24:05,233 --> 01:24:06,667
- Well, they've been hinting
for ten years,

1870
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,767
so relieved might be
a little more like it.

1871
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:10,533
- Hey, do me a favor
on this trip.

1872
01:24:10,667 --> 01:24:14,033
Don't let me fall asleep.
