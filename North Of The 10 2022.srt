00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:48,620
You're a Tyrannosaurus, yes.

188
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:50,103
Looking forward to
seeing some more from you.

189
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:51,206
Yes, sir.

190
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:52,448
Thank you, sir.

191
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:53,206
I appreciate it.

192
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:54,689
Fellas.

193
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:55,655
- My man.
- Come on, man.

194
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:56,758
Rip him open.

195
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:57,758
Hey, man.

196
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,689
This shirt was 60 bucks.

197
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:02,206
Yo, how's the air up here?

198
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:03,931
I'm just saying, if you
went to Yahoo reviews,

199
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,034
I wouldn't be mad if
you gave the manager

200
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:07,827
Paul fucking one star.

201
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:08,724
You know what?

202
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:09,724
Fuck this.

203
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:11,034
Give me this damn hot dog.

204
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:12,517
Go ahead and get out
your little Jergens.

205
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:14,655
It smells like hot
rhinoceros ass in here.

206
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:16,689
Give me-- yes.

207
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:17,724
He's your everything.

208
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:19,137
That's camtastic, baby.

209
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:25,896
Potentially huge
rumors coming from the al

210
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:27,689
Demerdah family in Abu Dhabi.

211
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:31,206
We're talking, of course,
about socialite Nefertari al

212
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:32,379
Demerdah.

213
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:35,034
Her father and company
president, Farouk al Demerdah,

214
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:37,172
recently promoted
her brother Ahmed.

215
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,034
And it seems Nefertari
may be next in line.

216
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:42,758
A profile in this
month's inside magazine

217
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:45,551
only adds fuel to the rumor.

[music playing]

219
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:51,862
Hello, we're this close
to closing the biggest

220
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:52,724
deal of the century.

221
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:54,034
Mashala.

222
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:56,551
I thought we did that already.

223
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:58,517
It's a new century, sis.

224
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:00,206
New deals.

225
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:03,586
Anyways, baba, I
instructed my entire team

226
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,862
to pull all the stops.

227
00:08:04,896 --> 00:08:08,310
Because in 2018, Abu Dhabi is
going to host the World Cup,

228
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:10,758
and all our family hotels
are going to host thousands

229
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:11,241
and thousands of guests.

230
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:12,103
Wow.

231
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:16,931
Proud of you, Omar.

232
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:18,620
Thank you for your
leadership on this.

233
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:22,068
Perhaps there might be a place
for her in this endeavor.

234
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:24,896
And if you are an
heiress to a great legacy,

235
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:26,931
you need to be ready.

236
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,068
And your 25th birthday
party presents

237
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:30,965
a perfect opportunity to you.

238
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,275
I am ready.

239
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,275
I've watched you do this
every day my whole life.

240
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,827
But there's more to life
than going to meetings

241
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:39,206
and organizing parties, and--

242
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,655
We will celebrate
your birthday

243
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:42,137
here at the house, Nef.

244
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:44,724
But, mama, don't I at least
have the right to celebrate

245
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:45,896
my birthday how I want?

246
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:47,275
At least that.

247
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,586
Karim Harbess will be
attending with his family.

248
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,068
They are highly
respected, a smart match.

249
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:54,758
Yes, if I'm 45
years old and boring,

250
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:57,206
and I want to clip his nose
hairs for the rest of my life.

251
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,931
Then, yes, maybe, a good match.

252
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:02,655
That's enough
with this attitude.

253
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:06,827
Nef, opportunity looks you
in the face and you turn away?

254
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:11,862
Well, perhaps I don't like
the way it stares at me.

255
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:13,655
Where are you going?

256
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:16,793
It appears you two have my
whole life figured out for me.

257
00:09:16,827 --> 00:09:18,689
So excuse me.

Oh, don't be ridiculous.

Those movies are for everybody.

What about James Cameron?

even know who made that.

and destroy their land.

colored people, man.

was dope, though.

studio, and the stellar cast

295
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:36,965
we have in place, we are
ensuring that this movie raises

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,793
the bar on this franchise.

one, we gave them action

You're more of a TV guy anyway.

369
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:31,000
That's more your lane.

370
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:31,931
I'm hungry.

371
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:33,413
Bro.

372
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:35,827
Did I just fuck up my
shot with Lyle Silvers?

373
00:12:35,862 --> 00:12:37,482
Hey, but it's OK.

374
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:38,344
You're a sitcom guy.

375
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:41,241
Besides, we already
got Nina Buxton

376
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:43,034
in the feature department.

377
00:12:43,068 --> 00:12:44,965
With you killing TV, hey, we're
going to run this town, right?

378
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,793
Come on.

379
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:46,965
You hear that?

380
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,965
It's what I'm telling you.

381
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,068
You're my number one guy.

382
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,413
That's amazing.

383
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:51,310
Fuck yeah.

384
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:52,827
Le'Veon.

385
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:54,517
Richard Assad.

386
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:56,068
Oh, hey, Veon, Richard is
actually going to be helping

387
00:12:56,103 --> 00:12:57,275
me assist your career as well.

388
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,862
So if you get a
call from him, it's

389
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:00,413
like getting a call from me.

390
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:02,310
Please, LeBron, from what
the guy's been telling me,

391
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:04,413
you're killing it
back in Chicago.

392
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:05,620
So you keep doing
what you're doing,

393
00:13:05,655 --> 00:13:08,206
and we'll be over here fighting
every other major player

394
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:09,620
to keep you on the roster.

395
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,896
Oh, no.

396
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:11,758
I'm not going anywhere.

397
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:13,896
Please, look, you
better be getting

398
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:15,206
offers from every other house
trying to scoop you up, Lutron.

399
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:18,931
We want you to be so large that
no one is able to resist you.

400
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,482
Le'Veon, Le'Veon.

401
00:13:20,517 --> 00:13:21,724
You hear me?

402
00:13:21,758 --> 00:13:24,482
If my foot isn't constantly
covered in shit from having

403
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:26,517
to shove it up
every single agent's

404
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:29,862
ass that comes near you,
then we're not doing our job.

405
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,517
And guess what?

406
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:34,413
We're all ready to be covered
in human shit for you.

407
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:36,344
So you keep doing what
you're doing over there,

408
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:38,931
and we'll be over
here buying baby wipes

409
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,931
and whatever else you
use to clean up shit.

410
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:42,517
We clean this shit
tonight, motherfucker.

411
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:44,344
Yeah.

412
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:46,034
Remember, you're nothing
without your agents.

413
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:47,137
All right?

414
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:48,896
Bring it home, Veon.

415
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:49,517
Bring it home.

416
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:50,896
OK.

417
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:51,620
OK, OK.
Thanks.

418
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:52,482
Thanks, y'all.

419
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:58,172
Yo.

420
00:13:58,206 --> 00:13:59,931
I got the sitcom.

421
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,103
I got the show.
- What?

422
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:02,103
Are you serious?

423
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:03,620
[interposing voices]

424
00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:04,448
Come on.

425
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:05,103
Let's go.

426
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,241
Yo.

427
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:09,448
When those checks
come rolling in,

428
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,000
I am finally going to
get that big house up

429
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:15,275
in Hollywood, up in the hills,
North of the 10 freeway.

430
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,103
And, hey, y'all
are coming with me.

431
00:14:17,137 --> 00:14:17,965
OK?

432
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,965
Of course, bro.

433
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,379
Ain't no thing going to change
between us, except for the

434
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:24,241
address and that bank account.

435
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:28,310
So you're still
going to that party?

436
00:14:28,344 --> 00:14:31,103
[inaudible] Kyle
Shaw in America?

437
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,103
Yes.

438
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm still going.

439
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:36,379
I won't tell anyone.

440
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:39,551
Chicago just seems
so down to Earth.

441
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:43,241
You know, how
you do this down-to-Earth woman

442
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:44,448
role you're trying to play?

443
00:14:44,482 --> 00:14:45,965
You really struggle with it.

444
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,241
Omar.

445
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:49,310
[speaking foreign language]

446
00:14:51,965 --> 00:14:54,034
I think one day they're going
to have all vegan restaurants.

447
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:55,034
Do you think that?

448
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,482
Yes, sir.

449
00:14:56,517 --> 00:14:58,000
I know that actors
do, like, crazy diets.

450
00:14:58,034 --> 00:14:59,413
Stuff like series regular, dude.

451
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:03,034
You know, guys, I slaved
in the kitchen for hours

452
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,034
making you this food.

453
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:05,689
The least you could
do, put down your game

454
00:15:05,724 --> 00:15:07,448
and put down the
phone, and just enjoy

455
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:08,758
the food for a little bit.

456
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:10,310
My bad.

457
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,034
We should go
out, do something.

458
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:13,172
We always go out.

459
00:15:13,206 --> 00:15:14,275
No, I'm with it, man.

460
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,275
We need to do something.

461
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,000
Not this mellow, low key shit.

462
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:19,275
I mean, how often do
we get to celebrate

463
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,103
a career move like this?

464
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:21,000
Right?

465
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:22,344
Let's go out.

466
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,103
Kyle Shaw's having
a party tonight.

467
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:25,551
What?

468
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:28,689
Associated with the
Chicago fashion expo.

469
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:30,482
That's the only
reason you want to go.

470
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:32,379
It's not the only
reason, but I'll take it.

471
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:34,172
Do you you even know
where this guy lives?

472
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:36,034
Look in the background.

473
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,000
That's Hyde Park behind
the Pancake House.

474
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:41,034
So I guess we sip it on
syrup till we find that view.

475
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:44,344
Speaking of views, I see some
hot just walked in just now.

476
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:46,000
And I think they're
looking at me.

477
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:47,000
Quick, check my breath.

478
00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:49,103
God, your breath isn't
the problem, Gumby.

479
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:50,034
[laughter]

480
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:51,620
Excuse me.

481
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:52,827
I'm sorry.

482
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:56,034
You are Sergeant Teague on
that show Mercenary, right?

483
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:56,620
That was you.

484
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:57,517
Yeah.

485
00:15:57,551 --> 00:16:01,103
That might have been me.

486
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:02,206
Wait, what are you doing?

487
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:03,206
I'm chronicling
our lives, bro.

488
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:04,034
Do something cool.

489
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:05,379
Act clever.

490
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:07,275
Don't act like
you normally act.

491
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,517
OK, so you just
butthurt because you

492
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,379
burned your own eggs
this morning, chef?

493
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:11,689
I will burn your
whole house down.

494
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:12,689
My gosh.

495
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:13,551
Guys, yo.

496
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:15,034
OK.

497
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:17,517
All right, we are
here in these Chicago

498
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:19,206
streets, live and direct.

499
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:22,206
I am your man, the actor,
the legend, Le'Veon Rooker.

500
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:23,172
And this is--

501
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:24,758
- I'm Tyyana.
- OK.

502
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:25,344
Jimena.

503
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:26,689
You're an amazing actor.

504
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:28,827
I'm amazing at some
other things too.

505
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,724
OK.

506
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:32,034
But while we're here, let
me introduce you to the boys.

507
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:35,724
We got Cam Weston right here,
fashion model extraordinaire.

508
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:37,344
And yeah, you're going to
want to get that autograph,

509
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:39,241
because he is about to blow up.

510
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:42,206
[music playing]

511
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:43,413
Man, what the fuck?

512
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:45,034
I don't even go to house partie.

513
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:47,379
Why the fuck would you
buy a house made of rocks?

514
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:49,068
Shit look like an
aquarium model.

515
00:16:49,103 --> 00:16:49,655
Hi, peasants.

516
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:50,586
And they got unicorns.

517
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,413
You just call them peasants.

518
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:52,586
They're not models.

519
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,172
Shoulders, chest,
pants, shoes.

520
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:58,103
Pat me down.

521
00:16:58,137 --> 00:16:59,103
Hey, brother.

522
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:00,827
They're all with me.

523
00:17:00,862 --> 00:17:01,448
Oh.

524
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:02,275
Back up.

525
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,793
You funny.

526
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:04,620
OK.

527
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:05,655
You're not playing.

528
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:06,758
Name.

529
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:09,620
He don't know who you are.

530
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,586
It's refreshing when
folks don't recognize me.

531
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,413
Who do I look like?

532
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,413
I don't know.

533
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:15,344
Taye Diggs if you had hair.

534
00:17:15,379 --> 00:17:16,793
You're another
pretty motherfucker.

535
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,793
Hit him.

536
00:17:17,827 --> 00:17:20,172
Bam.

537
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,344
Check it out.

538
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:22,275
You're on Mercenary?

539
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,103
Yeah, two seasons.

540
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:25,103
I was just on last week.

541
00:17:25,137 --> 00:17:25,827
What happened?

542
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:26,620
I missed it.

543
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:28,793
The governor
was taken hostage.

544
00:17:28,827 --> 00:17:29,827
Yeah.

545
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:31,137
Act it out.

546
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:32,172
What?

547
00:17:32,206 --> 00:17:33,241
Act it out.

548
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:33,896
Y'all go in.

549
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:35,137
What the fuck?

550
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:36,275
Action.

551
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,586
- You got it.
- Damn.

552
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,103
Yo.

553
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:39,689
This is what's up.

554
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,103
Wait, is this really
happening right now?

555
00:17:41,137 --> 00:17:42,172
Small as fuck.

556
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:43,275
Nigga, you got snacks?

557
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,758
I ain't got all day.

558
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:47,310
Goddamn.

559
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:48,137
Crazy.

560
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:49,310
Wow.

561
00:17:49,344 --> 00:17:50,620
Cool stuff.

562
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:53,137
Yo, they even brought
the outside inside.

563
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,586
Exterior.

564
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,758
Governor's mansion.

565
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:56,620
Nice.

566
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:01,413
A bunch of crazy shit happens.

567
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,965
And then I get up to the door
and I'm with the captain,

568
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,758
right?

569
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,896
And I got him, and I'm
like, get out of the way.

570
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:08,586
And I start fighting
motherfuckers.

571
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,482
Then I got to save the governor.

572
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:11,241
Right?

573
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:12,482
So I come up to the captain, and
I'm like, I'm going in there.

574
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:14,517
And he goes, no.

575
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,896
Stand down, mercenary.

576
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:17,344
Stand down, soldier.

577
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:18,379
I said, oh, yeah?

578
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:20,172
Who's going to stop me?

579
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:21,310
Play me on my heavy.

580
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:23,172
It's a party, you're
invited, because your friends

581
00:18:23,206 --> 00:18:25,206
think I'm sexy.

582
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:27,655
Yo, why the fuck are
you tucking in your shirt?

583
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,241
Bitches love the bulge.

584
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,241
That is gross.

585
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:30,896
That's genius.

586
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:33,379
We meet again.

587
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:34,310
See?

588
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:35,551
That shit worked.

589
00:18:35,586 --> 00:18:37,241
[interposing voices]

590
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:38,724
Yo, yo, yo.

591
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:41,586
I know we out here
enjoying that good life.

592
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,724
Matter fact, bartenders,
keep your tequila

593
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:45,689
and dark liquor flowing.

594
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,655
It is time to show
love to my brother,

595
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:51,862
the one, the only Kyle Shaw.

596
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:54,724
Hey.

597
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,241
She's getting me in trouble.

598
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:57,206
These are my girls right here.

599
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:58,241
All right, ladies.

600
00:18:58,275 --> 00:18:59,344
Stay in the back.

601
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:00,620
Bro, he's here?

602
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:02,275
Of course he's here.

603
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,655
This is his house.

604
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:05,310
Why the hell
wouldn't he be here?

605
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,655
I don't know.

606
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:07,655
I thought people like
him just put their name

607
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:08,103
on shit to bring out a crowd.

608
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:09,758
OK, everyone.

609
00:19:09,793 --> 00:19:11,034
There's 44 minutes
till the bomb goes off.

610
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,965
One terrified governor being
held hostage in that building,

611
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,793
and the people of
this entire state

612
00:19:15,827 --> 00:19:17,586
depending on our next move.

613
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:21,793
I vote for action.

614
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,413
I see a lot of friends,
almost immediate family.

615
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:25,413
It's good to see y'all.

616
00:19:25,448 --> 00:19:26,379
Please, let's raise a toast.

617
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:27,482
Shit.

618
00:19:27,517 --> 00:19:30,413
To the future of fashion.

619
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:31,413
Man, y'all beat it up.

620
00:19:31,448 --> 00:19:33,275
Let's keep making history.

621
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,827
[gunshot noises]

622
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:36,793
I'm taking out
soldiers left and right.

623
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:41,275
I take out-- bodies are
dropping left and right.

624
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,310
[gunshot noises]

625
00:19:43,344 --> 00:19:44,965
They're falling everywhere.

626
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,896
We're going to do everything
at the fashion expo this year.

627
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:48,586
I can't wait to see
you all later, man.

628
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,827
Y'all having a good time?

629
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:53,931
You heard the man,
keep the party going.

630
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:54,965
Wait.

631
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,413
He's leaving?

632
00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:57,379
Oh, fuck, man.

633
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:58,275
Listen, man.

634
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,379
Chase him down.

635
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:00,931
Oh, shit.

636
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,241
I'm not going to chase
him down like a groupie.

637
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:03,068
Grab my gun again.

638
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:05,482
I go, everybody
get the fuck back.

639
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:07,551
Governor, come on, goddamn it.

640
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:08,620
Let's bring the governor out.

641
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:09,586
Come on, shoot.

642
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,896
I jump in the way.

643
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:12,655
You're coming out of here alive.

644
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:13,793
And then the
governor is like, no.

645
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:14,344
Fuck no.

646
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,586
And I'm like, fine.

647
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,413
I kill like four people,
then they hit me.

648
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:20,931
I take a shot in the chest.

649
00:20:20,965 --> 00:20:21,965
I'm hit.

650
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,827
I'm hit.

651
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,586
I'm dying.

652
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,448
I'm dying.

653
00:20:26,482 --> 00:20:27,793
You're embarrassing me.

654
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,758
You ain't doing shit.

655
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:30,724
Stop.

656
00:20:30,758 --> 00:20:32,275
Last night, DJ saved my life.

657
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,620
I got took up.

658
00:20:33,655 --> 00:20:35,034
Shane, this shit
won't do this.

659
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,931
I'm asthmatic.

660
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:38,655
And there's blood in my throat.

661
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:44,724
But just before I die,
Maggie comes over.

662
00:20:44,758 --> 00:20:46,724
Oh no, mercenary.

663
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:47,896
What's going on with you?

664
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:51,034
And I go, I'm dying, bitch.

665
00:20:51,068 --> 00:20:53,379
I'm dying.

666
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:56,034
Oh, no.

667
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:58,310
Yes!

668
00:20:58,344 --> 00:20:59,758
Is that Victor Stanton?

669
00:21:02,551 --> 00:21:04,620
Hollywood super agent.

670
00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:05,620
What the?

671
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:07,448
You have to lock down that deal.

672
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:08,655
Now.

673
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:10,827
[gagging noises]

674
00:21:11,724 --> 00:21:14,965
And then I die.

675
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,310
[applause]

676
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:23,034
Thanks.

677
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:23,655
Thanks, everybody.

678
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:24,517
Thank you.

679
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,034
Thank you.

680
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:26,862
Can I go in now?

681
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:27,517
You good.

682
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:28,448
All right.

683
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:30,379
Cool.

684
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:32,310
That boy good.

685
00:21:32,344 --> 00:21:35,034
Motherfucker still
look like Tre Diggs.

686
00:21:35,068 --> 00:21:37,862
How come Black dudes never
get in the pool at the party?

687
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,655
Because we don't want
to get our hair wet.

688
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:40,965
This Beijing is expensive.

689
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,310
I thought that's
how y'all got waves.

690
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,344
Come on, bro.

691
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:46,310
You know what?

692
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:47,793
I'm going to fuck
shorty on that unicorn.

693
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:48,793
Oh, I'm going to go check--

694
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:50,034
Your hair.
Your hair.

695
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:50,482
Oh, shit.

696
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,482
You're right.

697
00:21:51,517 --> 00:21:52,448
She'll come to us.

698
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:53,655
Show the bulge.

699
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:56,310
Say you love me,
but I don't see.

700
00:21:56,344 --> 00:21:57,241
And I told him.

701
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,965
I said, Leo, I know
the water is cold.

702
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,034
But we can't finish the
movie unless you get in it.

703
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:04,931
And that's how we ended
Titanic, had to make it work.

704
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:06,620
I had to look him
in the eye and say,

705
00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:09,551
Leo, if you don't get on that
log, it's not going to work.

706
00:22:09,586 --> 00:22:11,068
We're not going to be able
to finish the project.

707
00:22:11,103 --> 00:22:13,896
All of us are trying to
go home, not just you.

708
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:15,586
Sometimes you got to look
these people in the face

709
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,413
and let them know who's boss.

710
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:17,379
Victor Stanton.

711
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:19,034
Hey, Cam Weston.

712
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:21,448
Sorry to interrupt, but
fortune favors the bold, right?

713
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:22,551
Fortune favors the bold.

714
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:23,448
Where did you get that from?

715
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:24,758
A Cracker Jack box?

716
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:26,000
How can I help you, Cam Weston?

717
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:34,448
Hey there, beautiful.

718
00:22:34,482 --> 00:22:35,931
I'm Le'Veon Rooker.

719
00:22:35,965 --> 00:22:37,724
OK.

720
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:41,068
I'm Le'Veon Rooker
from Mercenary.

721
00:22:41,103 --> 00:22:43,379
I'm sorry?

722
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:44,448
It's a TV show.

723
00:22:44,482 --> 00:22:45,931
You see, that's not
how you start things off.

724
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:46,517
All right?

725
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:47,586
How can I help you, man?

726
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,551
Oh, I'm a fashion model.

727
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:50,517
Yeah.

728
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:51,689
I was wondering, like--

729
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:53,448
Oh, he's a fashion model.

730
00:22:53,482 --> 00:22:55,758
He was wondering like-- light
skinned motherfuckers always

731
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:57,586
think they a model, don't they?

732
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,758

♪ Let's all have a good time.

917
00:28:28,275 --> 00:28:30,448
And you got
mints already, huh?

918
00:28:30,482 --> 00:28:31,137
Oh.

919
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:32,965
It's not candy.

920
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,068
It's just something I
have to do every day.

921
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:36,448
It's no big deal.

922
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:39,000
We can head back
if you need to.

923
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:42,000
So you're a model.

924
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:44,827
I always wondered what that
would be like as a career.

925
00:28:44,862 --> 00:28:48,448
I mean, my family owns
several stakes and companies,

926
00:28:48,482 --> 00:28:50,241
among other things.

927
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:52,068
Nothing too crazy.

928
00:28:52,103 --> 00:28:54,482
Several companies.

929
00:28:54,517 --> 00:28:57,448
I've never met anyone
from the UAE before.

930
00:28:57,482 --> 00:29:00,000
I mean, like,
business associates,

931
00:29:00,034 --> 00:29:02,172
work-related things.

932
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:04,344
Nothing like this, though.

933
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:07,931
Well, I hate to break it to
you, but you still haven't.

934
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:09,551
Not really, anyway.

935
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:12,034
My family is
originally from Syria.

936
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:14,517
And growing up, moving
around most of my life.

937
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:19,482
And we've been living in
the UAE since I was 12.

938
00:29:19,517 --> 00:29:22,620
But not 12 anymore.

939
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:25,034
No, I am not.

940
00:29:25,068 --> 00:29:29,931
So, Miss UAE from Syria.

941
00:29:29,965 --> 00:29:32,551
What brought you
out here tonight?

942
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:39,517
I just needed a long walk
by the lake, under the stars.

943
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:45,517
You came to the right place.

944
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:46,551
Yes.

945
00:29:46,586 --> 00:29:49,517
It really is beautiful here.

946
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:53,862
Hang with me today,
let me show you around.

947
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:57,620
I should head
back to the hotel.

948
00:29:57,655 --> 00:29:59,034
You're right.

949
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:00,137
We were out all night, huh?

950
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:03,310
You should get some rest.

951
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:07,137
Actually, I have
to fly back home.

952
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,344
When did you get in?

953
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:09,551
Yesterday.

954
00:30:09,586 --> 00:30:12,517
You just flew
here for the day.

955
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:14,896
I already texted for a car.

956
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:15,931
Who are you?

957
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:17,241
Like, really?

958
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:19,482
This was just
a birthday thing.

959
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:22,206
And it's your birthday.

960
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:23,344
Wow.

961
00:30:26,068 --> 00:30:27,862
Well, happy birthday.

962
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:30,068
Thank you.

963
00:30:30,103 --> 00:30:31,931
And thank you for
spending it with me, Cam.

964
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,896
This was the best birthday
I could have asked for.

965
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:39,862
I mean it.

966
00:30:39,896 --> 00:30:40,379
You're welcome.

967
00:30:44,206 --> 00:30:45,206
Oh.

968
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:46,413
That's for you.

969
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:51,000
You've got like a
Myspace or something?

970
00:30:51,034 --> 00:30:52,068
Stay in touch.

971
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:54,206
Do you have a phone?

972
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:56,137
I do.

973
00:30:56,172 --> 00:30:59,241
[laughter]

974
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:13,448
What's that?

975
00:31:13,482 --> 00:31:18,275
Here, in case you
want to stay in touch.

976
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,000
I think you know I do.

977
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:29,931
Happy birthday, Nefertari.

978
00:31:53,586 --> 00:31:54,965
She has returned.

979
00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:03,275
What's wrong with you?

980
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,448
What if you had an episode?

981
00:32:04,482 --> 00:32:07,137
I saw Dr. Birha
before I left.

982
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:09,344
And I had my
prescriptions with me.

983
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:11,482
I just wanted to
do my own thing.

984
00:32:11,517 --> 00:32:13,275
And I was with
Candela and Nadai.

985
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,034
Yes.

986
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:18,379
Your brother showed us
the Myspace pictures.

987
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:23,344
The Senegali's tabloid queen,
and a Spanish party girl.

988
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:25,137
Hardly the best influences.

989
00:32:25,172 --> 00:32:27,172
They are my oldest
friends, and they

990
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:29,310
traveled across the world to
spend my birthday with me.

991
00:32:29,344 --> 00:32:32,448
Your mother and I had
people out searching for you

992
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:34,310
before we saw those pictures.

993
00:32:34,344 --> 00:32:35,517
It was only a couple of days.

994
00:32:35,551 --> 00:32:39,034
Long enough for people
to do what they do,

995
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:43,344
for a young, wealthy, beautiful
woman such as yourself.

996
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:44,655
What if you have been kidnapped?

997
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:46,620
Well than, thank
goodness we're wealthy.

998
00:32:46,655 --> 00:32:48,172
Because you can
afford to save me.

999
00:32:48,206 --> 00:32:49,344
I'm making a point.

1000
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:52,034
Well, consider it made.

1001
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:54,517
Nefertari.

1002
00:32:54,551 --> 00:32:56,620
Father, I'm sorry.

1003
00:32:56,655 --> 00:32:57,275
OK?

1004
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,241
What else is there to say?

1005
00:33:00,275 --> 00:33:02,206
No one there knew who I was.

1006
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:04,034
I was anonymous.

1007
00:33:04,068 --> 00:33:06,724
And honestly, it
felt so wonderful.

1008
00:33:06,758 --> 00:33:09,172
I wasn't just the daughter
of Farouk and Hayat.

1009
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:11,241
Or the sister of Omar.

1010
00:33:11,275 --> 00:33:12,068
I was Nefertari.

1011
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:13,172
I could be me.

1012
00:33:13,206 --> 00:33:14,586
I could just be myself.

1013
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:20,206
So your family, we
mean nothing to you?

1014
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:22,517
That's not what I said.

1015
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:23,517
It's not what I meant.

1016
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:24,413
You know what?

1017
00:33:24,448 --> 00:33:25,724
I'm going to bed, father.

1018
00:33:25,758 --> 00:33:29,344
[speaking foreign language]

1019
00:33:29,379 --> 00:33:31,344
I can't wait.

1020
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:32,448
I'll arrange the catering.

1021
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:39,896
OK.

1022
00:33:39,931 --> 00:33:44,103
Try something else, a little
more Vogue, less whore

1023
00:33:44,137 --> 00:33:44,793
if you could.

1024
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:47,034
I don't want to go to hell.

1025
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,517
Hey, what's up?

1026
00:33:48,551 --> 00:33:49,689
Hey, Cam.

1027
00:33:49,724 --> 00:33:51,206
Oh, sorry about the wait.

1028
00:33:51,241 --> 00:33:53,103
Just trying to kill two
birds with one stone.

1029
00:33:53,137 --> 00:33:53,620
It's cool.

1030
00:33:53,655 --> 00:33:55,068
You got the pics?

1031
00:33:55,103 --> 00:33:56,000
Obviously.

1032
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,517
Hey, Gisselle, why
don't you take five?

1033
00:33:57,551 --> 00:34:00,172
I'll be in there in a second.

1034
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:03,793
My Photoshop trial expired, but
I found this sweet free program

1035
00:34:03,827 --> 00:34:05,344
called Photo Buddy.

1036
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:06,482
I think it's going to be,
like, the new Photoshop

1037
00:34:06,517 --> 00:34:08,275
or whatever, for sure.

1038
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,275
Check these out.

1039
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,137
Take a look.

1040
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:13,241
Big moment.

1041
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:16,655
Yes, baby.

1042
00:34:16,689 --> 00:34:18,137
You love?
- Angela.

1043
00:34:18,172 --> 00:34:19,275
Yeah.

1044
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,482
What the hell is this?

1045
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,620
Yo, these are terrible.

1046
00:34:21,655 --> 00:34:23,310
I mean, damn, is
it even in focus?

1047
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:24,655
Vaseline on the lens.

1048
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:25,793
Artistic as fuck.

1049
00:34:25,827 --> 00:34:27,482
I'm a human smudge.

1050
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:29,517
OK, well, these
photos really make

1051
00:34:29,551 --> 00:34:30,620
my editing skills look great.

1052
00:34:30,655 --> 00:34:32,482
OK, hold on a second
before getting

1053
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:34,448
your panties all in a bunch.

1054
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:37,793
You're going to love these.

1055
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:38,793
Look.

1056
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:43,103
It's you lying naked on
the counter of Arby's.

1057
00:34:43,137 --> 00:34:44,793
The fuck is going on here?

1058
00:34:44,827 --> 00:34:48,137
It's your face on Burt
Reynolds's naked body,

1059
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,137
lying on the counter of an
Arby's, with a strategically

1060
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:50,965
placed bun.

1061
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,620
I entered this
into an ad contest.

1062
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:53,827
Fingers crossed, bitch.

1063
00:34:53,862 --> 00:34:56,310
This is for my
portfolio, not yours.

1064
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,482
OK.

1065
00:34:57,517 --> 00:34:59,137
I really don't like
the tone you're

1066
00:34:59,172 --> 00:35:01,206
taking with me, because this
was for both of us, Cam.

1067
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:06,206
You got your poses,
and I got my edits.

1068
00:35:06,241 --> 00:35:07,241
You know what?

1069
00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:08,655
I'm going to make sure
everybody in the city

1070
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,344
knows not to fuck
with you, Angela.

1071
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:11,862
Is that a threat, Cam?

1072
00:35:11,896 --> 00:35:12,862
Yeah.

1073
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:14,551
You're really going
to regret doing that.

1074
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:16,310
I already regret everything.

1075
00:35:16,344 --> 00:35:17,724
Take your stupid photos.

1076
00:35:17,758 --> 00:35:19,896
Hey, where are you going?

1077
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:20,586
Home.

1078
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,551
You're doing a photo shoot.

1079
00:35:22,586 --> 00:35:23,896
She's a fat fuck anyway.

1080
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:26,241
And you're a skinny bitch
with shitty tattoos.

1081
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:26,724
Fuck you.

1082

[music playing]

1083
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:35,862
Hey, man.

1084
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:36,965
I thought you said you knew
how to fix these things.

1085
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,344
Excuse me?

1086
00:35:38,379 --> 00:35:39,689
I thought you said
you knew what you

1087
00:35:39,724 --> 00:35:41,172
were doing with these things.

1088
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,724
You do realize these
are original gaming

1089
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:44,379
cabinets, right?
- So what does that mean?

1090
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:45,310
You can't fix them?

1091
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,275
No, Paul.

1092
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,172
It means since you purchased a
dozen original gaming cabinets

1093
00:35:49,206 --> 00:35:51,551
that haven't been serviced
since Jordan played for the Sox,

1094
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:52,586
they're going to break down.

1095
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,896
OK, well, first
thing, I believe

1096
00:35:53,931 --> 00:35:54,965
Jordan played for the Wizards.

1097

Second of all--

1098

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1099
00:35:57,206 --> 00:35:59,172
First of all, you
can disrespect me.

1100
00:35:59,206 --> 00:36:00,586
But you're not going
to disrespect Jordan.

1101
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,793
To be fair, I believe
he disrespected me when

1102
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,586
he played in the South Side.

1103
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,931
Anyways, I just hired you to
be able to fix these things.

1109

Take that, and you
sell it on eBay.

1110

You sure?

1111
00:36:16,482 --> 00:36:17,482

00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:11,931
OK.

1276
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:13,172
Credit card from our sponsor.

1277
00:42:13,206 --> 00:42:14,206
Oh.

1278
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:15,620
Only for the principal cast.

1279
00:42:15,655 --> 00:42:16,724
OK.

1280
00:42:16,758 --> 00:42:18,931
Yo, that's what's up.

1281
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:20,965
Indeed it is, you deserve it.

1282
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,965
Enjoy it.

1283
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,896
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1284
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:25,103
I got to take this.

1285
00:42:25,137 --> 00:42:26,620
Mingle, get to know the cast.
Yeah?

1286
00:42:26,655 --> 00:42:27,931
Sure thing.

1287
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:28,586
And thanks again, David.
- Yes.

1288
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,241
Yes.

1289
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,793
Definitely can't tell
the boys about this.

1290
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:35,758
That's going to be funny.

1291
00:42:35,793 --> 00:42:37,586
Oh, hey, good morning.

1292
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,655
Oh.

1293
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:39,241
Good to see you.

1294
00:42:39,275 --> 00:42:40,586
I'm Gabrielle St. John.

1295
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,241
Playing Stacey.

1296
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:42,068
Yeah.

1297
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:42,965
I remember.

1298
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,068
We auditioned together.

1299
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,241
I was your husband.

1300
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:46,034
Oh.

1301
00:42:46,068 --> 00:42:47,827
Oh, I'm sorry.

1302
00:42:47,862 --> 00:42:49,931
They had me audition with
like 50 different Jedediah's.

1303
00:42:49,965 --> 00:42:51,034
Oh.

1304
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,275
Who'd they cast you as?

1305
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,793
Jedediah.

1306
00:42:54,827 --> 00:42:56,034
Oh.

1307
00:42:56,068 --> 00:42:58,103
Oh, honey.

1308
00:42:58,137 --> 00:43:00,965
I think you need
to talk to David.

1309
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
[laughter]

1310
00:43:04,034 --> 00:43:05,275
You should talk to David.

1311
00:43:08,896 --> 00:43:10,793
OK.

1312
00:43:10,827 --> 00:43:12,000
Just come on in, OK?

1313
00:43:12,034 --> 00:43:12,827
All right.

1314
00:43:12,862 --> 00:43:14,137
See you in a minute.

1315
00:43:14,172 --> 00:43:15,448
Hey, sorry to
bother you, David.

1316
00:43:15,482 --> 00:43:20,275
But why doesn't my wife think
that I'm playing her husband?

1317
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,827
I was just going to
tell you about that.

1318
00:43:22,862 --> 00:43:23,793
We got great news.

1319
00:43:23,827 --> 00:43:25,724
Casting and I were
reviewing your tapes,

1320
00:43:25,758 --> 00:43:29,103
and we think we found where your
talent can best lend itself.

1321
00:43:29,137 --> 00:43:31,896
So I'm not playing the lead?

1322
00:43:31,931 --> 00:43:33,000
The lead, the schmeed.

1323
00:43:33,034 --> 00:43:34,413
You know who the real lead is?

1324
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:36,000
The show.

1325
00:43:36,034 --> 00:43:37,793
And we're all just playing
our part to support it.

1326
00:43:37,827 --> 00:43:40,034
Your part, the neighbor.

1327
00:43:40,068 --> 00:43:41,344
Yeah, he's a real bright spot.

1328
00:43:41,379 --> 00:43:43,965
Always coming in for the zinger,
a memorable fan-favorite type

1329
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,793
of character.

1330
00:43:44,827 --> 00:43:46,965
You'll kill it.

1331
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,689
No small parts, Le'Veon.

1332
00:43:48,724 --> 00:43:50,793
No small parts.

1333
00:43:50,827 --> 00:43:51,413
What's up?

1334
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:52,689
What's up?

1335
00:43:52,724 --> 00:43:53,758
What's up?

1336
00:43:53,793 --> 00:43:57,965
Everyone, welcome to
the show Mr. Cole Pruitt.

1337
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,862
My brother.

1338
00:43:59,896 --> 00:44:01,413
What's up, G?

1339
00:44:01,448 --> 00:44:02,172
Hey.

1340
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:03,034
I'm great.

1341
00:44:03,068 --> 00:44:04,344
Good to see you.

1342
00:44:04,379 --> 00:44:06,206
Good old Pruitt got
one question for you.

1343
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:08,068
Can a brother get a, uh?

1344
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,034
Uh.

1345
00:44:09,068 --> 00:44:11,344
There it is.

1346
00:44:11,379 --> 00:44:12,896
Nice to see you, man.

1347
00:44:12,931 --> 00:44:14,034
What's happening, girl?

1348
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,034
How you doing?

1349
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:16,068
Come here, child.

1350
00:44:16,103 --> 00:44:16,896
Look at you, Lord have mercy.

1351
00:44:16,931 --> 00:44:17,724
Jesus.

1352
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:18,724
Stop it, Cole.

1353
00:44:18,758 --> 00:44:19,793
Wow.

1354
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:21,034
So good to see you.

1355
00:44:21,068 --> 00:44:22,068
This brother Kid.

1356
00:44:22,103 --> 00:44:23,034
How you doing, Kid?

1357
00:44:23,068 --> 00:44:24,379
This brother AC.

1358
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:25,172
AC.

1359
00:44:25,206 --> 00:44:27,206
[interposing voices]

1360
00:44:27,241 --> 00:44:28,172
We got some stuff.

1361
00:44:28,206 --> 00:44:29,034
Hey.

1362
00:44:29,068 --> 00:44:29,931
Hey, here's your seat.

1363
00:44:29,965 --> 00:44:30,862
Let's go.

1364
00:44:30,896 --> 00:44:31,896
What's up, everybody?

1365
00:44:31,931 --> 00:44:32,862
What's happening?

1366
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:33,931
Y'all ready to kick
some booty with me?

1367
00:44:33,965 --> 00:44:35,034
Whoa.

1368
00:44:35,068 --> 00:44:36,206
Yeah.

1369
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:38,034
I'm sorry about
Apollo 13 going rogue

1370
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:39,344
through your bathroom window.

1371
00:44:39,379 --> 00:44:42,724
Looks like my son is
going to be MIA, and MIT.

1372
00:44:42,758 --> 00:44:44,896
[laughter]

1373
00:44:51,413 --> 00:44:53,241
What is the meaning of this?

1374
00:44:56,758 --> 00:44:58,724
See, this all
happened because my kids

1375
00:44:58,758 --> 00:45:00,344
are on a journey of discovery.

1376
00:45:00,379 --> 00:45:03,000
See, they about to discover my
foot up in they Black asses.

1377
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,965
[laughter]

1378
00:45:09,517 --> 00:45:11,137
Oh, man.

1379
00:45:11,172 --> 00:45:13,137
Mommy, how come he no funny?

1380
00:45:13,172 --> 00:45:15,793
Oh.

1381
00:45:15,827 --> 00:45:17,310
He no funny.

1382
00:45:17,344 --> 00:45:19,241
We got to put
that in the script.

1383
00:45:19,275 --> 00:45:22,310
What you crying for, man?

1384
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:26,137
You crying like a
baby, why, you know?

1385
00:45:26,172 --> 00:45:27,000
My bad.

1386
00:45:27,034 --> 00:45:28,793
My bad.

1387
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:30,793
Classic.

1388
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:34,793
Come on, man.

1389
00:45:34,827 --> 00:45:36,448
Shit.

1390
00:45:36,482 --> 00:45:40,000
Dumbass charger.

1391
00:45:40,034 --> 00:45:43,241
Socking that grind up.

1392
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:46,000
Cam Weston.

1393
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,551
Yes, sir.

1394
00:45:48,586 --> 00:45:49,793
You're a legend.

1395
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:51,827
I'm a huge fan.

1396
00:45:51,862 --> 00:45:53,448
Yes?

1397
00:45:53,482 --> 00:45:54,862
Yeah.

1398
00:45:54,896 --> 00:45:55,310
Lock eyes.

1399
00:45:58,034 --> 00:45:59,068
Like my favorite short story.

1400
00:45:59,103 --> 00:46:00,310
Thank you, man.

1401
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:02,034
Thank you.

1402
00:46:02,068 --> 00:46:04,344
Yeah.

1403
00:46:04,379 --> 00:46:07,310
I think we're all in one accord.

1404
00:46:07,344 --> 00:46:08,379
One more thing, though.

1405
00:46:15,068 --> 00:46:15,931
Uh-huh.

1406
00:46:18,655 --> 00:46:19,862
Yeah.

1407
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:22,034
That's just my latest creation.

1408
00:46:22,068 --> 00:46:23,517
Gave birth to that
baby this morning,

1409
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:26,931
five hours worth of hard labor.

1410
00:46:26,965 --> 00:46:27,793
I like it.

1411
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:30,896
One of a kind,
and it's one on one.

1412
00:46:30,931 --> 00:46:33,620
Walk forward.

1413
00:46:33,655 --> 00:46:35,241
OK.

1414
00:46:35,275 --> 00:46:36,620
All right, now turn it up 10%.

1415
00:46:36,655 --> 00:46:39,206
Leave me at 12.

1416
00:46:39,241 --> 00:46:40,034
Right there.

1417
00:46:40,068 --> 00:46:42,379
Stop.

1418
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:45,034
Imagine this.

1419
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:48,034
Main stage, big hall.

1420
00:46:48,068 --> 00:46:50,379
Powerful lights at
the fashion expo.

1421
00:46:50,413 --> 00:46:56,517
999 people looking at
you, but they see KS.

1422
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:58,448
KS.

1423
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,448
KS.

1424
00:46:59,482 --> 00:47:00,379
KS.

1425
00:47:04,068 --> 00:47:05,206
I won't let you down.

1426
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:06,379
I know you won't.

1427
00:47:06,413 --> 00:47:09,379
You got the gig, Cam West.

1428
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:10,448
You got this gig.

1429
00:47:10,482 --> 00:47:11,965
I got this gig?

1430
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,586
Yes, Cam West.

1431
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,206
Let me see something strong.

1432
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:16,620
Right.

1433
00:47:16,655 --> 00:47:19,034
Right now, it looks like
your foot fell asleep.

1434
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:21,586
Strong, not harsh.

1435
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,620
OK.

1436
00:47:22,655 --> 00:47:23,448
Right.

1437
00:47:23,482 --> 00:47:24,551
Because I could
kind of come in--

1438
00:47:24,586 --> 00:47:25,586
like Cam.
- Yeah.

1439
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,275
OK.

1440
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,103
OK.

1441
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:29,000
Like that.

1442
00:47:29,034 --> 00:47:29,689
Fast eyes.

1443
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:31,034
Yeah, just like that.

1444
00:47:31,068 --> 00:47:32,103
Getting kind of dizzy.

1445
00:47:32,137 --> 00:47:34,413
Now, give me all you've got.

1446
00:47:34,448 --> 00:47:35,931
I want to see the
nature of the shit.

1447
00:47:35,965 --> 00:47:36,586
Yes.

1448
00:47:40,068 --> 00:47:41,310
Like the doo rag.

1449
00:47:41,344 --> 00:47:43,379
Less doo rag,
more stocking cap.

1450
00:47:43,413 --> 00:47:45,551
Oh, shit.

1451
00:47:45,586 --> 00:47:47,379
Be careful with the button.

1452
00:47:47,413 --> 00:47:48,448
Do you see what he see?

1453
00:47:48,482 --> 00:47:50,103
I don't see what you see.

1454
00:47:50,137 --> 00:47:51,241
Let's find a perfect storm.

1455
00:47:51,275 --> 00:47:52,241
All right?
- OK.

1456
00:47:52,275 --> 00:47:53,241
Give me something--

1457
00:47:53,275 --> 00:47:54,965
Like, what if I start back?

1458
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,482
Pure thunder.

1459
00:47:55,517 --> 00:47:56,413

No, no.

2188
01:14:08,689 --> 01:14:10,172
Wait.

2189
01:14:10,206 --> 01:14:11,137
Everyone stop.
- Do I got something on my face?

2190
01:14:11,172 --> 01:14:12,551
No.
This just isn't working.

2191
01:14:12,586 --> 01:14:13,655
I need-- wait, hold on.
I got it.

2192
01:14:13,689 --> 01:14:15,172
OK.

2193
01:14:15,206 --> 01:14:16,517
Just stay there, don't move, OK?
Don't move.

2194
01:14:16,551 --> 01:14:17,241
That's OK.

2195
01:14:17,275 --> 01:14:18,172
I'm just going to change this.

2196
01:14:18,206 --> 01:14:19,137
Oh.

OK.

OK?

2200
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:23,551
This isn't Macy's.
Just this.

2201
01:14:23,586 --> 01:14:24,586
I got this.

2202
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:26,275
OK, and perfect.

2203
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:27,275

01:14:29,689 --> 01:14:30,655
Perfect.
OK.

2206
01:14:30,689 --> 01:14:32,551
See?

2207
01:14:32,586 --> 01:14:33,551
And just don't let them catch
so much shadow next time.

2208
01:14:33,586 --> 01:14:34,517
That's it.

2209
01:14:43,172 --> 01:14:44,275
See, the jingle ball's over.

Good.

01:14:46,206 --> 01:14:47,551
Great.

2213
01:14:47,586 --> 01:14:49,655
Yes.

2214
01:14:49,689 --> 01:14:51,586
Hey.

2215
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:52,275
How are you?

2216
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:53,724
Great.

2217
01:14:53,758 --> 01:14:56,000
What are you doing right now?

2218
01:14:56,034 --> 01:14:58,000
You want to get some food?

2219
01:14:58,034 --> 01:14:59,517
All right.

2220
01:14:59,551 --> 01:15:01,586
Here we go.

2221
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:05,931
Roasted duck breast with a
pomegranate citrus glaze,

2222
01:15:05,965 --> 01:15:10,620
and a side of buttery garlic
green beans with a palm puree

2223
01:15:10,655 --> 01:15:11,344
mashed potato.

2224
01:15:11,379 --> 01:15:12,931
Wow.

2225
01:15:12,965 --> 01:15:18,758
Oh, and of course, some
sparkling cider to drink.

2226
01:15:18,793 --> 01:15:21,620
Nefertari, this is
one of my boys, Mike.

2227
01:15:21,655 --> 01:15:24,896
He's also an amazing
chef, as you can see.

2228
01:15:24,931 --> 01:15:26,103
Well, Mike.

2229
01:15:26,137 --> 01:15:28,034
This does look amazing.

2230
01:15:28,068 --> 01:15:29,931
Congratulations to you two.

2231
01:15:29,965 --> 01:15:31,586
For what?

2232
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,586
For finally making an
honest man out of this guy.

2233
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:34,137
All right.

2234
01:15:34,172 --> 01:15:34,896
Thanks, Mike.

2235
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:36,034
I appreciate it.

2236
01:15:36,068 --> 01:15:36,965
- Before you, he was--
- All right.

2237
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:37,896
Thanks, Mike.

2238
01:15:37,931 --> 01:15:38,896
Mike, thank you.

2239
01:15:38,931 --> 01:15:40,586
Appreciate you, man.

2240
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:43,758
Enjoy your meal.

2241
01:15:43,793 --> 01:15:46,103
Anyways, to us.

2242
01:15:46,137 --> 01:15:48,931
For shutting down
the whole place.

2243
01:15:48,965 --> 01:15:52,034
To having friends
in high places.

2244
01:15:52,068 --> 01:15:54,000
Plus, only the best for us.

2245
01:15:56,689 --> 01:15:57,275
Shall we eat?

2246
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:58,034
Yes.

2247
01:16:03,896 --> 01:16:04,793
They got snacks?

2248
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:05,655
Watch out.

2249
01:16:09,034 --> 01:16:10,655
What's wrong with you?

2250
01:16:10,689 --> 01:16:12,965
So what if we didn't
get the nomination?

2251
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,103
Guess what?

2252
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:15,310
We're not in the
art house business.

2253
01:16:15,344 --> 01:16:16,379
No.

2254
01:16:16,413 --> 01:16:18,655
We are in the business
of making money business.

2255
01:16:18,689 --> 01:16:21,689
Their script.

2256
01:16:21,724 --> 01:16:22,344
Motherfuckers.

2257
01:16:22,379 --> 01:16:23,862
We're not a business, man.

2258
01:16:23,896 --> 01:16:25,413
We're businessmen.

2259
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:27,689
And some ladies.

2260
01:16:27,724 --> 01:16:28,655
Oh, one second.

2261
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,103
Le'Veon.

2262
01:16:34,137 --> 01:16:36,689
What the hell, Reuben?

2263
01:16:36,724 --> 01:16:37,689
You got Richard here.

2264
01:16:37,724 --> 01:16:39,275
Hey, did they tell you
about the new story

2265
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:41,034
arc for your character?

2266
01:16:41,068 --> 01:16:43,655
Oh, you mean the part where I
just stand there like a mutant,

2267
01:16:43,689 --> 01:16:44,517
I don't do shit.

2268
01:16:44,551 --> 01:16:45,724
That character
you're talking about?

2269
01:16:45,758 --> 01:16:46,689
Hey, look.

2270
01:16:46,724 --> 01:16:48,034
They change these
scripts all the time.

2271
01:16:48,068 --> 01:16:48,827
It's just part of the game.

2272
01:16:48,862 --> 01:16:50,827
Angela Bassett,
Angela Bassett,

2273
01:16:50,862 --> 01:16:53,275
she had a whole role removed
from Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

2274
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:54,862
What about Judy Winslow?

2275
01:16:54,896 --> 01:16:56,793
She went up the stairs
and never came back down.

2276
01:16:56,827 --> 01:16:57,793
Fucking Urkel.

2277
01:16:57,827 --> 01:16:58,827
He took all the lines.

2278
01:16:58,862 --> 01:17:00,379
Exactly.
Look.

2279
01:17:00,413 --> 01:17:01,758
Hey, at least you're still
part of the project, right?

2280
01:17:01,793 --> 01:17:04,034
Wait, so you knew
about these cuts?

2281
01:17:04,068 --> 01:17:06,965
They're setting you up to
be a major part of this show.

2282
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,482
That is some bullshit, OK?

2283
01:17:08,517 --> 01:17:09,862
I was the star.

2284
01:17:09,896 --> 01:17:10,896
And that's great, right?

2285
01:17:10,931 --> 01:17:12,034
We got you now.

2286
01:17:12,068 --> 01:17:13,344
Now we also have Cole.

2287
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:14,758
Right?

2288
01:17:14,793 --> 01:17:15,482
The whole pack.

2289
01:17:15,517 --> 01:17:19,344
Wait, you represent Cole, too?

2290
01:17:19,379 --> 01:17:20,482
Yo.

2291
01:17:20,517 --> 01:17:21,758
Everybody out.

2292
01:17:21,793 --> 01:17:23,034
My mistake.

2293
01:17:23,068 --> 01:17:24,034
Thank you for coming out.

2294
01:17:24,068 --> 01:17:25,068
Hope you enjoyed the party.

2295
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:27,034
Look, Veon, you
got to trust me.

2296
01:17:27,068 --> 01:17:28,344
You trust me, right?

2297
01:17:28,379 --> 01:17:30,034
You wouldn't be there
if they didn't need you.

2298
01:17:30,068 --> 01:17:32,206
You just have to
trust the process.

2299
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:33,931
But that also means
that it's going

2300
01:17:33,965 --> 01:17:34,931
to take some time to get there.

2301
01:17:34,965 --> 01:17:36,034
This isn't acceptable.

2302
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:36,896
OK?

2303
01:17:36,931 --> 01:17:38,862
You can't just do this.

2304
01:17:38,896 --> 01:17:40,758
They can't do this.

2305
01:17:40,793 --> 01:17:42,931
Look, give me a call after
the rehearsal and we'll--

2306
01:17:42,965 --> 01:17:43,862
Hey, yo.

2307
01:17:43,896 --> 01:17:46,724
David.

2308
01:17:46,758 --> 01:17:47,172
We need to talk.

2309
01:17:51,896 --> 01:17:53,862
What the fuck?

2310
01:17:53,896 --> 01:17:55,482
It was a mistake.

2311
01:17:55,517 --> 01:17:56,724
I'm sorry.

2312
01:17:56,758 --> 01:17:57,344
Le'Veon.

2313
01:17:57,379 --> 01:17:58,068
My man.

2314
01:17:58,103 --> 01:18:00,034
Who's your friend?

2315
01:18:00,068 --> 01:18:01,241
What is this?

2316
01:18:01,275 --> 01:18:02,931
You're not happy
with the changes.

2317
01:18:02,965 --> 01:18:04,241
I had 12 lines.

2318
01:18:04,275 --> 01:18:05,413
Now I have three.

2319
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:06,068
Three.

2320
01:18:06,103 --> 01:18:08,827
Good things come in three.

2321
01:18:08,862 --> 01:18:10,241
Come on, man.

2322
01:18:10,275 --> 01:18:12,413
It's just the pilot episode.

2323
01:18:12,448 --> 01:18:14,965
See, the show runner felt
that we needed to make

2324
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,103
more space for the lead.

2325
01:18:16,137 --> 01:18:17,827
I'm a series regular, man.

2326
01:18:17,862 --> 01:18:19,827
Right you are.

2327
01:18:19,862 --> 01:18:21,103
And don't make a big deal of
it, because we just shifted most

2328
01:18:21,137 --> 01:18:23,793
of your lines to the second
episode, which now you're going

2329
01:18:23,827 --> 01:18:26,241
to have a meaty B story in 102.

2330
01:18:26,275 --> 01:18:27,793
Which is better
than one oh none.

2331
01:18:27,827 --> 01:18:28,310
What?

2333
01:18:30,827 --> 01:18:31,379
You feel that?

01:18:31,413 --> 01:18:32,413
No.

2335
01:18:32,448 --> 01:18:33,068

What?

2339
01:18:40,448 --> 01:18:43,793
Keeping it light
for the family.

Hey, everybody.
Let's go.

2343

Let's get this show on the road.

What?
Ha ha.

You feel it?

You feel it?

2347

What the fuck?

2348
01:18:58,172 --> 01:19:01,896
I'm so sorry
about Apollo 13 just

2349
01:19:01,931 --> 01:19:03,482
going rogue right through
your window there, Banks.

2350
01:19:10,517 --> 01:19:13,413
Now, my son, little rocket man.

Don't tell his mama,
but that boy missing

01:26:05,758 --> 01:26:06,896
There's a lot of
sausage in here.

2537
01:26:06,931 --> 01:26:08,379
Hey.
Appreciate you.

2538
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:09,827
Appreciate you, brother.

2539
01:26:09,862 --> 01:26:13,586
You beautiful chocolate
goddess, come here.

2540
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:14,931
Vic.

2541
01:26:14,965 --> 01:26:17,551
Look at all these power
players here for you.

2542
01:26:17,586 --> 01:26:18,586
How exciting.

2543
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:19,931
I'm only excited to see you.

2544
01:26:19,965 --> 01:26:20,965
I want you to meet my client.

2545
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,551
This is Cam Weston.
- Hi.

2546
01:26:22,586 --> 01:26:23,551
This is a beautiful lady.

2547
01:26:23,586 --> 01:26:24,758
Nice to meet you.

2548
01:26:24,793 --> 01:26:26,448
These are the after
school special boys.

2549

[laughter]

2550
01:26:31,413 --> 01:26:33,413
So you work for RCA, huh?

2551
01:26:33,448 --> 01:26:35,931
So long as you don't
start singing for me, I do.

2552
01:26:35,965 --> 01:26:37,448
Let's see if we got
some more food inside.

2553
01:26:37,482 --> 01:26:38,379
Come on.
- I just got here.

2554
01:26:38,413 --> 01:26:39,034
Come on.

2555
01:26:39,068 --> 01:26:40,586
I will.

2556
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:41,724
All right.

2557
01:26:41,758 --> 01:26:42,896
Well, we'll leave
you guys to it.

2558
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:44,413
- All right, man.
- All right.

2559
01:26:44,448 --> 01:26:45,241
All right.
All right.

2560
01:26:45,275 --> 01:26:45,620
See you in a few.

2561
01:26:45,655 --> 01:26:47,241
Come here.

2562
01:26:47,275 --> 01:26:49,931
Ugh, I don't trust anything
that looks like this.

2563
01:26:49,965 --> 01:26:51,793
Because you have
no class, bro.

2564
01:26:51,827 --> 01:26:53,586
I have no class?

2565
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:56,620
First of all, niggas from the
Chi don't eat things like this.

2566
01:26:56,655 --> 01:26:57,896
You're from Japan.

2567
01:26:57,931 --> 01:26:59,620
What does that have
to do with anything?

2568
01:26:59,655 --> 01:27:01,482
You don't even
know what this is.

2569
01:27:01,517 --> 01:27:02,068
- Yeah I do.
- Ugh.

2570
01:27:02,103 --> 01:27:03,310
God.

2571
01:27:03,344 --> 01:27:03,896
You're disgusting.

2572
01:27:03,931 --> 01:27:06,000
That's amazing.

2573
01:27:06,034 --> 01:27:07,034
Hey.

2574
01:27:07,068 --> 01:27:10,310
Taste this.

2575
01:27:10,344 --> 01:27:11,689
Oh my God.

2576
01:27:11,724 --> 01:27:12,965
It's amazing.

2577
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:13,965
You think they'll
give me the recipe?

2578
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,827
What are you doing out here?

2579
01:27:15,862 --> 01:27:17,068
Well, right now, I'm trying to
figure out what citrus flavor--

2580
01:27:17,103 --> 01:27:18,827
OK.

2581
01:27:18,862 --> 01:27:19,689
Well, you do not eat out
here with the guests.

2582
01:27:19,724 --> 01:27:20,965
Get back in the kitchen.

2583
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,620
Go.

2584
01:27:21,655 --> 01:27:23,827
What?

2585
01:27:23,862 --> 01:27:25,931
Go back to the kitchen?

2586
01:27:25,965 --> 01:27:26,862
Oh.

2587
01:27:29,655 --> 01:27:30,448
I'm on it, chef.

2588
01:27:30,482 --> 01:27:31,931
See you, Val Kilmer.

2589
01:27:31,965 --> 01:27:33,482
Oh.

2590
01:27:33,517 --> 01:27:35,620
[laughter]

2591
01:27:35,655 --> 01:27:36,517
Right?

2592
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:37,344
Right?

2593
01:27:37,379 --> 01:27:38,068
What a sensation.

2594
01:27:38,103 --> 01:27:38,965
That's great.

2595
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:39,827
That is tomago on it.

2596
01:27:39,862 --> 01:27:40,965
That's fish eggs.

2597
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:41,517
Yeah.

2598
01:27:41,551 --> 01:27:42,448
You keep it inside.

2599
01:27:42,482 --> 01:27:43,068
Just hold it.

2600
01:27:43,103 --> 01:27:44,482
Don't chew yet.

2601
01:27:44,517 --> 01:27:45,655
Don't chew.
Savor it.

2602
01:27:45,689 --> 01:27:47,000
Can you mush it
around a little bit?

2603
01:27:47,034 --> 01:27:49,655
Almost like a like a cow
in a field chewing cud.

2604
01:27:49,689 --> 01:27:53,620
So the longer you keep it
in your warm, sweet mouth,

2605
01:27:53,655 --> 01:27:54,620
the more hatching.

2606
01:27:54,655 --> 01:27:55,517
Because those are fish eggs.

2607
01:27:55,551 --> 01:27:56,793
They hatch in your mouth.

2608
01:27:56,827 --> 01:27:58,482
It opens your sinuses.

2609
01:27:58,517 --> 01:27:59,620
It's a delicacy in Japan.

2610
01:27:59,655 --> 01:28:01,034
He's from Japan.

2611
01:28:01,068 --> 01:28:02,034
Oh.

2612
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:03,689
I wouldn't have guessed.

2613
01:28:03,724 --> 01:28:05,931
Breathe.

2614
01:28:05,965 --> 01:28:07,551
Now, breathe out through
your mouth if you can.

2615
01:28:07,586 --> 01:28:09,034
Just a little bit.

2616
01:28:09,068 --> 01:28:10,551
Yeah, let those lips quiver.

2617
01:28:10,586 --> 01:28:11,413
Oh.

2618
01:28:11,448 --> 01:28:12,448
Yeah.

2619
01:28:12,482 --> 01:28:14,896
It's good, right?

2620
01:28:14,931 --> 01:28:16,931
A happy guest is a happy chef.

2621
01:28:16,965 --> 01:28:18,689
Thank you guys so
much for being here.

2622
01:28:18,724 --> 01:28:19,517
Enjoy.

2623
01:28:19,551 --> 01:28:20,724
OK.

2624
01:28:20,758 --> 01:28:21,965
Mike, pass the Adam's apple.

2625
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,724
You tried to make Jimmy
Fallon feed me food.

2626
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:26,034
Why would you do that to me?

2627
01:28:26,068 --> 01:28:27,551
It's good, bro.
I'm telling you, it's amazing.

2628
01:28:27,586 --> 01:28:28,275
It's good food, bro.

2629
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:29,793
It's fucking disgusting, bro.

2630
01:28:29,827 --> 01:28:31,724
So you're saying
you won't be hitting

2631
01:28:31,758 --> 01:28:32,724
on any other woman all day?

2632
01:28:32,758 --> 01:28:33,689
Oh, yeah.

2633
01:28:33,724 --> 01:28:34,586
That's what I'm saying.

2634
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:36,551
Vic Stanton don't do that.

2635
01:28:36,586 --> 01:28:39,724
Vic Stanton just grabs the most
beautiful woman at the party,

2636
01:28:39,758 --> 01:28:41,586
and he keeps it
nice and low key.

2637
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:43,034
Let's the party come to him.

2638
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:46,586
The biggest power play is
coming to your own party

2639
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:48,517
and remaining virtually unseen.

2640
01:28:48,551 --> 01:28:49,517
Ooh.

2641
01:28:49,551 --> 01:28:50,758
I like that.

2642
01:28:57,896 --> 01:28:59,517
Is that lobster almost done?

2643
01:28:59,551 --> 01:29:01,793
Plating now, chef.

2644
01:29:01,827 --> 01:29:03,448
Have you seasoned
with authority?

2645
01:29:03,482 --> 01:29:04,137
Yes, chef.

2646
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:05,206
Did you garnish beautifully?

2647
01:29:05,241 --> 01:29:06,965
Yes, chef.

2648
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,137
Are those red
onions diced nicely?

2649
01:29:09,172 --> 01:29:10,103
Yes, sir.

2650
01:29:10,137 --> 01:29:11,482
Yes, what?

2651
01:29:11,517 --> 01:29:13,000
It's yes, chef.

2652
01:29:13,034 --> 01:29:14,689
Act like you people
want to be here.

2653
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:16,000
I appreciate the enthusiasm.

2654
01:29:16,034 --> 01:29:17,758
I yell in my own kitchen.

2655
01:29:17,793 --> 01:29:18,758
That's beautiful.

2656
01:29:18,793 --> 01:29:19,758
That's what I'm talking about.

2657
01:29:19,793 --> 01:29:20,758
Keep it going.

2658
01:29:20,793 --> 01:29:21,758
That lobster's got to go.

2659
01:29:21,793 --> 01:29:22,620
The lobster's got to go.

2662
01:29:25,137 --> 01:29:26,586
Let's get it out here.
Come on.

2663
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:27,448
Come on.

2664
01:29:27,482 --> 01:29:28,482
Go, go, go.

2665
01:29:28,517 --> 01:29:29,137
Side, come on.

2666
01:29:29,172 --> 01:29:29,586
Hey, kid.

2667
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:30,620
Stick with me.

2668
01:29:30,655 --> 01:29:31,482
You'll be OK.

2669
01:29:31,517 --> 01:29:32,137
You got it.

2670
01:29:35,793 --> 01:29:37,448
Lovely, beautiful people.

2671
01:29:37,482 --> 01:29:38,275
How are you doing?

2672

Where the fuck is
Victor Stanton?

2673

Where's Victor's Stanton?

2674
01:29:40,793 --> 01:29:42,068
Excuse me, Stant.

2675
01:29:42,103 --> 01:29:43,758
One day, we'll be able
to a press a button,

2676
01:29:43,793 --> 01:29:44,793
and a car will--

2677

the Chicago Bears.

the fuck you are.

bank information?

I'm going to be
real with you, man.

You got all the contacts,
and you're great with people.

We should work together, man.

describing is an agent.

2896
01:38:39,517 --> 01:38:40,137
It's got to be
right through here.

2897
01:38:40,172 --> 01:38:41,620
Every goal that you have--

2898
01:38:41,655 --> 01:38:43,448
I'm trying to tell
you, this is messed up.

2899
01:38:43,482 --> 01:38:44,448
And give me my phone back.

2900
01:38:44,482 --> 01:38:45,275
Excuse me.

2901
01:38:45,310 --> 01:38:46,689
You ask me like a lady.

2902
01:38:46,724 --> 01:38:49,000
Can I have my
phone back please?

2903
01:38:49,034 --> 01:38:49,655
Yes.

2904
01:38:49,689 --> 01:38:50,689
Fine.

2905
01:38:50,724 --> 01:38:51,620
Thank you.

2906
01:38:51,655 --> 01:38:52,172
Shoot.

2907
01:38:52,206 --> 01:38:53,310
I'm a grown-ass man.

2908
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,000
Then act like one.

2909
01:38:55,034 --> 01:38:55,689
You act like one.

2910
01:38:55,724 --> 01:38:57,275
I have the big boy pants on.

2911
01:38:57,310 --> 01:38:59,000
I wear briefs.

2912
01:38:59,034 --> 01:39:00,000
Oh, my God.

2913
01:39:00,034 --> 01:39:00,827
You're ridiculous.

2914
01:39:00,862 --> 01:39:02,103
No, you don't walk
in front of me.

2915
01:39:02,137 --> 01:39:02,965
I need to find him.

2916
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,689
But you've got to
master the skills

2917
01:39:04,724 --> 01:39:06,517
in order to become successful.

2918
01:39:06,551 --> 01:39:08,689
But then you've got
to times it by fate.

2919
01:39:08,724 --> 01:39:09,689
Everybody say fate.

2920
01:39:09,724 --> 01:39:12,034
Hey, what's the plan?

2921
01:39:12,068 --> 01:39:19,103
Steal a fit, do the
thing, and blow up the spot.

2922
01:39:19,137 --> 01:39:21,379
Blow up the spot?

2923
01:39:21,413 --> 01:39:23,034
Right here.
Face the stage.

2924
01:39:23,068 --> 01:39:23,724
You, in the back.

2925
01:39:23,758 --> 01:39:24,310
You.

2926
01:39:24,344 --> 01:39:25,344
In the back.
Back.

2927
01:39:25,379 --> 01:39:26,379
Here we go.

2928
01:39:29,137 --> 01:39:30,172
You.
Helmet on.

2929
01:39:30,206 --> 01:39:31,379
Let's go.

2930
01:39:31,413 --> 01:39:32,413
Time to make some sexy donuts.

2931
01:39:36,068 --> 01:39:38,206
Actually, I was
second-guessing the helmet.

2932
01:39:38,241 --> 01:39:40,241
We need you at the
stage now, please.

2933
01:39:40,275 --> 01:39:43,068
Leave the friend.

2934
01:39:43,103 --> 01:39:44,758
Showtime.

2935
01:39:44,793 --> 01:39:45,620
Boom.

2936
01:39:48,379 --> 01:39:50,241
Oh, shit.

2937
01:39:50,275 --> 01:39:52,068
It's Nef, not Brandon.

2938
01:39:52,103 --> 01:39:53,793
Fuck.

2939
01:39:53,827 --> 01:39:56,206
The KS experience is going
to be absolutely amazing.

2940
01:39:56,241 --> 01:39:57,241
Enjoy the rest of the show.

2941
01:39:57,275 --> 01:39:58,344
Take care, guys.

2942
01:39:58,379 --> 01:40:00,586
[cheering]

2943
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:03,344
Places, everybody, places.

2944
01:40:03,379 --> 01:40:05,034
Here we go, places.

2945
01:40:05,068 --> 01:40:06,206
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle.

2946
01:40:06,241 --> 01:40:07,068
You, you in the back.

2947
01:40:07,103 --> 01:40:08,068
Come on.
Helmet on.

2948
01:40:08,103 --> 01:40:08,931
Helmet on.
Come on.

2949
01:40:08,965 --> 01:40:10,344
I'm trying to
tell you my secret.

2950
01:40:10,379 --> 01:40:11,689
- Helmet
- I invest my time.

2951
01:40:11,724 --> 01:40:13,689
I invest my energy.

2952
01:40:13,724 --> 01:40:14,275
OK.

2953
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:15,517
Everybody feeling good?

2954
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:16,758
Kyle, how are we looking?
Yeah?

2955
01:40:16,793 --> 01:40:17,620
Good?

2956
01:40:17,655 --> 01:40:19,551
Everybody feeling good?
Doing great?

2957
01:40:19,586 --> 01:40:20,413
You're going to go out there,
and you're going to wow them?

2958
01:40:20,448 --> 01:40:21,413
All right, everybody.

2959
01:40:21,448 --> 01:40:22,344
Remember what we rehearsed.

2960
01:40:22,379 --> 01:40:23,517
Let's practice this.

2961
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:25,413
5, 6, 7, and.

2962
01:40:25,448 --> 01:40:29,172
1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

2963
01:40:29,206 --> 01:40:33,034
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

2964
01:40:33,068 --> 01:40:34,172
Walk, walk, walk.

2965
01:40:34,206 --> 01:40:35,517
walk, walk, walk.

2966
01:40:40,551 --> 01:40:42,103
2, 1.
Stay.

2967
01:40:42,137 --> 01:40:42,827
All right.

2968
01:40:42,862 --> 01:40:44,517
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

2969
01:40:44,551 --> 01:40:46,758
Revolutions don't
start until someone

2970
01:40:46,793 --> 01:40:49,551
puts on clothes in the
morning and feels powerful.

2971
01:40:49,586 --> 01:40:51,103
Your revolution
starts here and now.

2972
01:40:51,137 --> 01:40:53,551
And we present to you
the future of fashion,

2973
01:40:53,586 --> 01:40:55,517
from a man selling
power to the people,

2974
01:40:55,551 --> 01:40:57,241
with a needle and thread.

2975
01:40:57,275 --> 01:41:00,758
From the heart of Chicago to
the world, Kyle Shaw experience.

2976
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:05,689
Okay Okay.

2977
01:41:05,724 --> 01:41:07,448
Can't see what she's wearing.
I can't see her face.

2978
01:41:07,482 --> 01:41:08,827
Oh there we go.

2979
01:41:08,862 --> 01:41:10,896
Oh, white chocolate.
That's what I'm talking about.

2980
01:41:10,931 --> 01:41:11,896
Come on now.

2981
01:41:11,931 --> 01:41:15,172
Ladies give it up.
Fellas, I see y'all looking.

2982
01:41:16,137 --> 01:41:18,310
Oh okay. with the shoulders out.

2983
01:41:18,344 --> 01:41:20,103
Alright, we're still going.

2984
01:41:20,137 --> 01:41:22,793
Here we go, walking down.
Okay.

2985
01:41:24,206 --> 01:41:25,586
[whispering]

2986
01:41:28,206 --> 01:41:31,241
Keep it going for them.
[imitating a siren]

2987
01:41:31,275 --> 01:41:32,758
OK.

2988
01:41:32,793 --> 01:41:34,103
I don't know what old boy's
doing in the back, bro.

2989
01:41:34,137 --> 01:41:36,137
But all right, we
can work with that.

2990
01:41:36,172 --> 01:41:38,448
OK, msut be a new thing.

2991
01:41:39,275 --> 01:41:40,241
Ugh, damn.

2992
01:41:40,275 --> 01:41:41,620
Fucking Bohemian.

2993
01:41:43,482 --> 01:41:44,758
He's comign down the row,
OK I see you now.

2994
01:41:46,137 --> 01:41:47,586
Ok, hot or not?

2995
01:41:49,172 --> 01:41:51,103
What they doing next?

2996
01:41:51,448 --> 01:41:54,241
Take the helmet off.

2997
01:41:54,275 --> 01:41:56,482
Off.

2998
01:41:56,517 --> 01:41:59,620
Helmet off now.

2999
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:04,758
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
our guest with a special dance

3000
01:42:04,793 --> 01:42:07,344
performance from his
world phenomenon show,

3001
01:42:07,379 --> 01:42:12,310
[non-english speech]
Eight-time Tony Award winner.

3002
01:42:12,344 --> 01:42:13,689
Give it up.

3003
01:42:13,724 --> 01:42:14,793
Give a round of
applause right now.

3004
01:42:14,827 --> 01:42:16,724
Let me hear you make some
noise for Joel Leon..

3005
01:42:22,896 --> 01:42:24,379
Oh.

3006
01:42:24,413 --> 01:42:25,517
OK.

3007
01:42:28,862 --> 01:42:30,655
Oh, damn.

3008
01:42:49,517 --> 01:42:51,482
What the hell?

3009
01:42:51,517 --> 01:42:52,482
Oh.

3010
01:42:52,517 --> 01:42:53,758
That's shit I taught him.

3011
01:43:01,896 --> 01:43:03,931
Ta-da.

3012
01:43:03,965 --> 01:43:06,931
Ta-da.

3013
01:43:06,965 --> 01:43:10,586
Ta-da my ass, Cam Weston.

3014
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:13,586
What the hell are
you doing, man?

3015
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:15,379
Are you actively
trying to destroy

3016
01:43:15,413 --> 01:43:16,379
me and my demonstration?

3017
01:43:16,413 --> 01:43:17,931
Not actively.

3018
01:43:17,965 --> 01:43:19,965
No, he's disrespecting
the fuck out of me.

3019
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,586
You got some fucking toes out?

3020
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:24,931
My mama and my real daddy
all the way in the back.

3021
01:43:24,965 --> 01:43:27,310
They brought half the church.

3022
01:43:27,344 --> 01:43:31,379
And you're going to come over
here doing the toe tap?

3023
01:43:31,413 --> 01:43:33,275
On my big night?

3024
01:43:33,310 --> 01:43:35,724
I can't help the fact that
you ain't got no talent.

3025
01:43:35,758 --> 01:43:37,586
But on everything
I like, you ain't

3026
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:38,724
about to have a fucking thing

3027
01:43:38,758 --> 01:43:40,620
by the time I'm done with you!
[interposing voices]

3028
01:43:40,655 --> 01:43:41,551
Hold me back!

3029
01:43:41,586 --> 01:43:42,724
OK.

3030
01:43:42,758 --> 01:43:43,724
Get out of my
fucking show, man!

3031
01:43:43,758 --> 01:43:45,827
Kyle, relax, man!

3032
01:43:45,862 --> 01:43:46,931
You in front of all
these people, man.

3033
01:43:46,965 --> 01:43:48,034
- I know it!
- It's OK.

3034
01:43:48,068 --> 01:43:49,482
No, it's not!

3035
01:43:49,517 --> 01:43:50,931
Excuse me, everyone.

3036
01:43:50,965 --> 01:43:52,724
I'm sorry to interrupt
your fantastic show.

3037
01:43:52,758 --> 01:43:54,241
Who's shorty?

3038
01:43:54,275 --> 01:43:55,758
Oh, no.

3039
01:43:55,793 --> 01:43:57,413
But that man right
there is a fraud.

3040
01:43:57,448 --> 01:44:00,482
He's a fake, pretending
to be something he's not.

3041
01:44:00,517 --> 01:44:01,793
That's Cameron Weston.

3042
01:44:01,827 --> 01:44:03,965
He's no award-winning anything.

3043
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,379
He's just a boy who
convinced me that he

3044
01:44:06,413 --> 01:44:11,034
loved me, only to break my heart
with lie after lie after lie.

3045
01:44:11,068 --> 01:44:13,620
Nef, I know this looks
bad, but I can explain.

3046
01:44:13,655 --> 01:44:14,793
Explain?

3047
01:44:14,827 --> 01:44:17,310
What do you want to explain?

3048
01:44:17,344 --> 01:44:19,862
Maybe about how you lied to
me for months, telling me what

3049
01:44:19,896 --> 01:44:21,655
a big shot you are,
only to turn out

3050
01:44:21,689 --> 01:44:24,482
to be a fool trying to dance
in someone else's shoes?

3051
01:44:24,517 --> 01:44:25,482
Nef.

3052
01:44:25,517 --> 01:44:26,793
Please.

3053
01:44:26,827 --> 01:44:28,344
Maybe it's about
how you convinced me

3054
01:44:28,379 --> 01:44:31,517
what a big shot you are,
how accomplished you are.

3055
01:44:31,551 --> 01:44:32,482
And you know what?

3056
01:44:32,517 --> 01:44:33,862
No, it's OK.

3057
01:44:33,896 --> 01:44:35,689
Because I blame
myself for that one.

3058
01:44:35,724 --> 01:44:36,965
No, I'm sorry, Cameron.

3059
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,827
But I am not as shallow
as you think I am.

3060
01:44:39,862 --> 01:44:42,724
I fell in love with you.

3061
01:44:42,758 --> 01:44:46,000
And I would have
loved you in a shack.

3062
01:44:46,034 --> 01:44:47,655
I would have loved you
anywhere, and I would

3063
01:44:47,689 --> 01:44:50,000
have been yours completely.

3064
01:44:50,034 --> 01:44:52,655
What you have or don't
have, I don't care.

3065
01:44:52,689 --> 01:44:56,827
I could have looked past all of
it, had you just talked to me.

3066
01:44:56,862 --> 01:45:00,551
And the other
women, the cheating?

3067
01:45:00,586 --> 01:45:02,862
You cheating on me,
that I cannot forgive.

3068
01:45:02,896 --> 01:45:04,379
And that I won't forgive.

3069
01:45:04,413 --> 01:45:06,724
Wait, what are you
talking about cheating?

3070
01:45:06,758 --> 01:45:08,620
I was never with
any other women.

3071
01:45:08,655 --> 01:45:10,379
I've only been with you, Nef.

3072
01:45:10,413 --> 01:45:12,379
Look at that,
with other women?

3073
01:45:12,413 --> 01:45:14,896
Nef, that was a photo shoot.

3074
01:45:14,931 --> 01:45:16,517
And that was before
I was with you.

3075
01:45:16,551 --> 01:45:17,862
You are all such a joke.

3076
01:45:17,896 --> 01:45:19,034
You're a joke.

3077
01:45:19,068 --> 01:45:21,517
[speaking foreign language]

3078
01:45:21,551 --> 01:45:24,724
Nefertari.

3079
01:45:24,758 --> 01:45:26,724
I wasn't fucking
cheating on you.

3080
01:45:26,758 --> 01:45:28,137
Yo, I tried to text you, bro.

3081
01:45:28,172 --> 01:45:29,379
But--

3082
01:45:29,413 --> 01:45:30,551
What the fuck, man?

3083
01:45:30,586 --> 01:45:31,517
You didn't pick up, bro.

3084
01:45:31,551 --> 01:45:32,862
Real homies pick up.

3085
01:45:32,896 --> 01:45:34,034
Why the fuck did you
bring her here, man?

3086
01:45:34,068 --> 01:45:35,448
I didn't bring her, bro.

3087
01:45:35,482 --> 01:45:36,137
She dragged me.

3088
01:45:36,172 --> 01:45:37,379
Come on, bro.

3089
01:45:37,413 --> 01:45:37,965
I got--

3090
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,379
Just go, man.

3091
01:45:39,413 --> 01:45:39,965
Just go.

3092
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,379
I tried to work it out.

3093
01:45:41,413 --> 01:45:41,827
Come on, man.

3094
01:45:41,862 --> 01:45:43,931
Come on, man.

3095
01:45:43,965 --> 01:45:44,586
Oh.

3096
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:45,586
Wow.

3097
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:46,724
Wow.

3098
01:45:46,758 --> 01:45:48,551
I see what you did there.

3099
01:45:48,586 --> 01:45:51,862
The fashion is so good,
it'll break your heart.

3100
01:45:51,896 --> 01:45:53,689
Kyle Shaw, ladies and gentlemen.

3101
01:45:53,724 --> 01:45:54,689
Kyle Shaw.

3102
01:45:54,724 --> 01:45:55,551
Take photos of him.
Yeah.

3103
01:45:55,586 --> 01:45:56,379
Yeah.

3104
01:45:56,413 --> 01:45:57,724
Yeah.

3105
01:45:57,758 --> 01:45:59,862
And introducing
Cameron Weston.

3106
01:45:59,896 --> 01:46:01,793
Give it up, ladies.

3107
01:46:01,827 --> 01:46:03,586
And I'm the agent,
Morrison Colvin.

3108
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:06,068
All right, take a bow.

3109
01:46:06,103 --> 01:46:10,137
Follow him on Black
planet right now.

3110
01:46:10,172 --> 01:46:11,586
We did that.

3111
01:46:11,620 --> 01:46:13,068
We did that.

3112
01:46:13,103 --> 01:46:16,586
Available soon in Neiman
Marcus, or at least Macy's.

3113
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:17,758
- For real.
- Yeah.

3114
01:46:17,793 --> 01:46:18,586
We worked it out.

3115
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:20,689
Thank you for that.

3116
01:46:20,724 --> 01:46:21,620
Yeah.
All right.

3117
01:46:21,655 --> 01:46:22,482
OK.

3118
01:46:24,068 --> 01:46:25,068
Yeah.

3119
01:46:25,103 --> 01:46:27,137
Whoo!

3120
01:46:27,172 --> 01:46:30,620
Look, what happened at the
expo, that was a lightning

3121
01:46:30,655 --> 01:46:32,172
in the bottle situation.

3122
01:46:32,206 --> 01:46:34,655
And as tasty as that bottle
was, that bottle has run dry.

3123
01:46:34,689 --> 01:46:37,068
Look, that casting agent
I was telling you about

3124
01:46:37,103 --> 01:46:39,000
is shooting a show
in Los Angeles.

3125
01:46:39,034 --> 01:46:39,689
LA?

3126
01:46:39,724 --> 01:46:40,931
What are you talking about?

3127
01:46:40,965 --> 01:46:41,793
They're filming.

3128
01:46:41,827 --> 01:46:42,931
It starts this Friday.

3129
01:46:42,965 --> 01:46:44,482
So pack your bags, Playboy.

3130
01:46:44,517 --> 01:46:45,586
Cali, huh?

3131
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:47,034
For how long?

3132
01:46:47,068 --> 01:46:48,068
I mean, it could be
a couple of months.

3133
01:46:48,103 --> 01:46:49,931
It depends on how long
you make it on the show.

3134
01:46:49,965 --> 01:46:51,482
It's a modeling competition.

3135
01:46:51,517 --> 01:46:52,068
That's it?

3136
01:46:52,103 --> 01:46:52,793
That's the whole show?

3137
01:46:52,827 --> 01:46:53,758
That's it?

3138
01:46:53,793 --> 01:46:54,620
That's the whole show?

3139
01:46:54,655 --> 01:46:55,862
Yes.

3140
01:46:55,896 --> 01:46:56,793
All these shows are the same.

3141
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:58,931
But it's fine, you
can win this thing.

3142
01:46:58,965 --> 01:47:00,862
And I'm working
for you every day.

3143
01:47:00,896 --> 01:47:02,137
I wake up, I'm thinking of you.

3144
01:47:02,172 --> 01:47:04,034
I go to bed, I'm
thinking of you.

3145
01:47:04,068 --> 01:47:05,689
When I wake my
ass on the toilet,

3146
01:47:05,724 --> 01:47:07,586
I am thinking of you, Cam.

3147
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:10,137
And whether you know so or
not, agents have dreams too.

3148
01:47:10,172 --> 01:47:13,724
And my dream is to help
you accomplish your dreams.

3149
01:47:13,758 --> 01:47:15,586
So can you do me a favor?

3150
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:20,275
Pack a bag and get
ready to go to Cali.

3151
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:22,000
Yeah, all right.

3152
01:47:22,034 --> 01:47:24,000
That's what I'm talking about.

3153
01:47:33,551 --> 01:47:36,000
[music playing]

3154
01:47:39,689 --> 01:47:41,000
I'm Rafael Costa.

3155
01:47:41,034 --> 01:47:42,517
And I'm Tomiko Lee.

3156
01:47:42,551 --> 01:47:45,172
Starting tonight, the
handsome hunks behind us,

3157
01:47:45,206 --> 01:47:48,689
and the lovely ladies,
will make TV history.

3158
01:47:48,724 --> 01:47:51,896
These models will compete
on the runway, in the home

3159
01:47:51,931 --> 01:47:54,896
and in the yard,
all for $1 million.

3160
01:47:54,931 --> 01:47:58,689
And not just that, all while
living under the same roof,

3161
01:47:58,724 --> 01:48:02,620
eating the same food, and
sharing the same bathroom.

3162
01:48:02,655 --> 01:48:03,551
And, oh, yeah.

3163
01:48:03,586 --> 01:48:05,758
Giving up all sense
of personal space.

3164
01:48:05,793 --> 01:48:07,655
Tonight on model house.

3165
01:48:11,068 --> 01:48:12,896
Where's my milkshake?

3166
01:48:12,931 --> 01:48:13,793
I'm Leilani Moore.

3167
01:48:13,827 --> 01:48:15,103
[speaking spanish]

3168
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,586
Nick Black.

3169
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:19,034
Like the coffee,
as it should be.

3170
01:48:19,068 --> 01:48:20,586
Hey, I'm Cam Weston.

3171
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:22,586
I was born and raised,
South Side Chicago.

3172
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:25,137
It's time for your
first challenge.

3173
01:48:28,275 --> 01:48:30,931
Jonas and I are killing
this domestic game.

3174
01:48:30,965 --> 01:48:31,793
I'm sweeping with my a-game.

3175
01:48:31,827 --> 01:48:33,758
And he's right
behind, like poetry.

3176
01:48:33,793 --> 01:48:37,655
Hey, I wasn't aware of the
domestic part of this show.

3177
01:48:37,689 --> 01:48:38,655
I'm just a model.

3178
01:48:38,689 --> 01:48:39,620
Oh, we're filming now?

3179
01:48:39,655 --> 01:48:41,034
And he don't listen,
that's the problem.

3180
01:48:41,068 --> 01:48:43,068
This guy with his
light skinned face.

3181
01:48:43,103 --> 01:48:45,034
Cam, the weird guy
with the fake eyes,

3182
01:48:45,068 --> 01:48:46,793
they got to be fake, right?

3183
01:48:46,827 --> 01:48:49,586
Look, I can tell people are
on edge with me around here.

3184
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:50,620
You know?

3185
01:48:50,655 --> 01:48:52,068
They feel like I'm not
working as hard as them.

3186
01:48:52,103 --> 01:48:53,034
So I'm going to
cook for everybody.

3187
01:48:53,068 --> 01:48:57,344
So I set the mood music, right?

3188
01:48:57,379 --> 01:48:59,103
I slide in.

3189
01:48:59,137 --> 01:49:02,275
Chef Boyardee, Chef Boy
Cam in the building.

3190
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:05,103
Got the pasta ready,
it's looking real nice.

3191
01:49:05,137 --> 01:49:07,655
He's very into himself.

3192
01:49:07,689 --> 01:49:10,965
This is the same guy that
was toe bottin' on the runway.

3193
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
I got the pasta, the cookies.

3194
01:49:13,034 --> 01:49:14,172
I'm doing a little
bit of dancing.

3195
01:49:14,206 --> 01:49:15,965
He's sitting here
doing runway walking,

3196
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,689
I'm cleaning the bathroom.

3197
01:49:17,724 --> 01:49:19,655
[speaking spanish]

3198
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,103
Do you smell that?

3199
01:49:29,896 --> 01:49:32,793
Smells like cookies.

3200
01:49:32,827 --> 01:49:34,413
Cam.

3201
01:49:34,448 --> 01:49:35,827
Cameron.

3202
01:49:35,862 --> 01:49:37,206
How he got on the
show, I don't know.

3203
01:49:37,241 --> 01:49:38,344
How he looks that
good, I don't know.

3204
01:49:38,379 --> 01:49:42,000
I came out the womb like
this, with a fresh beard.

3205
01:49:42,034 --> 01:49:42,793
Like, what do you want from me?

3206
01:49:42,827 --> 01:49:45,137
[speaking spanish]

3207
01:49:48,068 --> 01:49:49,655
He's got us looking
real bad out here.

3208
01:49:49,689 --> 01:49:50,965
But it's the thought
that counts, right?

3209
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,655
Everybody's working hard.

3210
01:49:52,689 --> 01:49:54,862
Cam over there making
lasagna shirtless.

3211
01:49:54,896 --> 01:49:56,310
Nobody wants to see that.

3212
01:49:56,344 --> 01:49:57,655
I don't want to see that.

3213
01:49:57,689 --> 01:49:58,827
Gimme that.

3214
01:49:58,862 --> 01:49:59,689
Hey, Cam!

3215
01:50:08,862 --> 01:50:11,965
Cam I knew your ass was
in here baking cookies.

3216
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:12,827
Are you serious?

3217
01:50:12,862 --> 01:50:14,827
[speaking spanish]

3218
01:50:14,862 --> 01:50:16,103
What the [bleep] he said.

3219
01:50:16,137 --> 01:50:17,000
Toll House cookies?

3220
01:50:17,034 --> 01:50:18,655
Really?

3221
01:50:18,689 --> 01:50:20,310
He laid his Toll's free
all over the [bleep] floor.

3222
01:50:20,344 --> 01:50:22,896
America, who don't like
to dance when they cook?

3223
01:50:22,931 --> 01:50:26,103
Wait, are those
raisin cookies?

3224
01:50:26,137 --> 01:50:27,827
[speaking spanish]

3225
01:50:27,862 --> 01:50:29,034
Why are you shirtless?

3226
01:50:29,068 --> 01:50:30,793
I was doing the right thing.

3227
01:50:30,827 --> 01:50:32,310
The mindset was there.

3228
01:50:32,344 --> 01:50:33,862
I'm not licensed to do
any of this, all right?

3229
01:50:33,896 --> 01:50:35,103
I'm a model.

3230
01:50:35,137 --> 01:50:36,827
Light-skinned people,
we don't clean.

3231
01:50:36,862 --> 01:50:38,103
This isn't Top Chef.

3232
01:50:38,137 --> 01:50:40,965
And I know, because
I got kicked off

3233
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,172
the first episode of Top Chef.

3234
01:50:43,206 --> 01:50:44,793
I might have messed
it up just a little bit.

3235
01:50:44,827 --> 01:50:46,827
I'm not going to lie.

3236
01:50:46,862 --> 01:50:47,413
Just a little bit.
OK.

3237
01:50:47,448 --> 01:50:48,655
It was a lot.

3238
01:50:48,689 --> 01:50:49,655
It was a lot.

3239
01:50:49,689 --> 01:50:50,310
I'm sorry.

3240
01:50:50,344 --> 01:50:51,689
I'm trying, America.

3241
01:50:51,724 --> 01:50:52,827
Cut me some slack.

3242
01:50:52,862 --> 01:50:53,724
Vote for Cam Weston.

3243
01:50:53,758 --> 01:50:55,137
I'm a good guy.

3244
01:50:55,172 --> 01:50:59,000
And the domestic voted out
of model house is Cam Weston.

3245
01:51:05,206 --> 01:51:07,034
NEFERTARI [BY PHONE]: Hi, Cam.

3246
01:51:07,068 --> 01:51:10,413
As I'm sure you've already
guessed, I've returned home.

01:56:34,689 --> 01:56:36,034
OK.

3428
01:56:36,068 --> 01:56:38,068
All right.

01:56:56,206 --> 01:56:57,724
Oh.

3435
01:56:57,758 --> 01:56:59,517
Hello, welcome to the palace.

3436
01:56:59,551 --> 01:57:01,620
Do you have a reservation
number, please?

3437
01:57:01,655 --> 01:57:05,103
We're here for the
al Demerdah family.

3438
01:57:05,137 --> 01:57:06,103
I'm sorry.

3439
01:57:06,137 --> 01:57:07,000
And who are you?

3440
01:57:07,034 --> 01:57:09,413
We're close, personal
friends of Nef.

3441
01:57:09,448 --> 01:57:11,241
I mean, we go way back.

3442
01:57:11,275 --> 01:57:13,103
Nef, the daughter.

3443
01:57:13,137 --> 01:57:15,482
Yes, I know who Nefartari is.

3444
01:57:15,517 --> 01:57:17,241
But I don't know who you are.

3445
01:57:17,275 --> 01:57:18,310
Shane Books.

3446
01:57:18,344 --> 01:57:20,275
Could we get your name.

3447
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:21,827
Fatima.

3448
01:57:21,862 --> 01:57:23,586
Fatima.

3449
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:25,448
I'm sure there's
not a lot of people,

3450
01:57:25,482 --> 01:57:29,586
especially Americans, who would
even know where she lives.

3451
01:57:29,620 --> 01:57:30,413
Am I right?

3452
01:57:30,448 --> 01:57:32,103
I suppose you're right.

3453
01:57:32,137 --> 01:57:33,206
Oh, then.

3454
01:57:33,241 --> 01:57:35,758
Wouldn't it make sense
that they're expecting us,

3455
01:57:35,793 --> 01:57:38,413
and you're kind of
holding us up right now.

3456
01:57:38,448 --> 01:57:39,517
Kind of.

3457
01:57:42,931 --> 01:57:45,586
You know what?

3458
01:57:45,620 --> 01:57:46,413
I gave her the eyes.

3459
01:57:46,448 --> 01:57:47,586
You saw that?

3460
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:48,172
I don't think
your eyes did it.

3461
01:57:48,379 --> 01:57:51,172
I was like "What your name?".

3462
01:57:51,206 --> 01:57:54,413
Thank you.

3463
01:57:54,448 --> 01:57:55,758
State your business.

3464
01:57:55,793 --> 01:57:57,310
Hello.

3465
01:57:57,344 --> 01:57:58,413
This is Cam Weston.

3466
01:57:58,448 --> 01:58:00,172
I'm here to see Nefertari.

3467
01:58:00,206 --> 01:58:01,344
Is she home?

3468
01:58:01,379 --> 01:58:03,482
Nefertari is
expecting no visitors.

3469
01:58:03,517 --> 01:58:04,482
Please
leave.

3470
01:58:04,517 --> 01:58:05,827
Hey, look.

3471
01:58:05,862 --> 01:58:07,551
I came all the way here
from America to see her.

3472
01:58:07,586 --> 01:58:09,344
Can you at least
tell her I'm here?

3473
01:58:09,379 --> 01:58:11,689
Look, I got 11 grand left.

3474
01:58:11,724 --> 01:58:13,517
And I will spend it
until it runs out.

3475
01:58:13,551 --> 01:58:17,172
And I will sleep in the street
just to get one more chance

3476
01:58:17,206 --> 01:58:17,620
to talk to her.

3477
01:58:17,655 --> 01:58:20,862
Hello, Cameron.

3478
01:58:20,896 --> 01:58:23,586
This is Nefertari's
father speaking to you.

3479
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:25,862
You seem to keep
making wrong choices.

3480
01:58:25,896 --> 01:58:28,517
Show up here again, and
they will have you arrested.

3481
01:58:28,551 --> 01:58:30,172
- Mr--
- Goodbye.

3482
01:58:30,206 --> 01:58:31,172
Safe journey.

3483
01:58:31,206 --> 01:58:31,655
Farewell.

3484
01:58:36,896 --> 01:58:38,862
Americans.

3485
01:58:38,896 --> 01:58:42,206
And please don't come back.

3486
01:58:42,241 --> 01:58:44,482
Yo, back in Vision Central,
you said that's our money.

3487
01:58:44,517 --> 01:58:45,517
That's our 11 grand.

3488
01:58:45,551 --> 01:58:46,551
That's why we came over here.

3489
01:58:46,586 --> 01:58:47,827
Say, my name is Shane Brooks.

3490
01:58:47,862 --> 01:58:49,310
We've just got to
regroup, all right?

3491
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:50,482
No, we ain't regrouping.

3492
01:58:50,517 --> 01:58:53,482
We've got more than $11,000.

3493
01:58:53,517 --> 01:58:55,896
He was talking about on hand.

3494
01:58:55,931 --> 01:58:59,206
Speaking of on hand,
I don't see a ring.

3495
01:58:59,241 --> 01:59:00,586
That's crazy.

3496
01:59:00,620 --> 01:59:01,379
I gave her my number already.

3497
01:59:01,413 --> 01:59:02,551
Oh, 911.

3498
01:59:02,586 --> 01:59:03,379
I'm popping.

3499
01:59:03,413 --> 01:59:04,379
You're not popping.

3500
01:59:04,413 --> 01:59:05,448
I'm popping.

3501
01:59:05,482 --> 01:59:06,758
You're Mary Poppins.

3502
01:59:06,793 --> 01:59:09,448
I'm pretty sure she
saw my YouTube channel.

3503
01:59:09,482 --> 01:59:12,034
Damn.

3504
01:59:12,068 --> 01:59:13,931
That's it.

3505
01:59:13,965 --> 01:59:14,724
Oh.

3506
01:59:14,758 --> 01:59:15,620
That look painful.

3507
01:59:15,655 --> 01:59:16,620
I mean, that's 11 feet.

3508
01:59:16,655 --> 01:59:17,586
That's not regulation.

3509
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:19,965
Yeah, definitely 11 feet.

3510
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:20,793
Yo.

3511
01:59:20,827 --> 01:59:22,379
OK.

3512
01:59:22,413 --> 01:59:23,586
Yeah.

3513
01:59:23,620 --> 01:59:25,275
That's what I'm talking about.

3514
01:59:25,310 --> 01:59:28,586
You know, physical exercise
gets your brain thinking.

3515
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:29,965
You get your body moving,
you're going to come

3516
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
up with some way to see her.

3517
01:59:32,034 --> 01:59:34,758
Honestly, if you want to
stay here, spend down to zero.

3518
01:59:34,793 --> 01:59:38,551
Shit, even sleep in the street,
I have nothing holding me back.

3519
01:59:38,586 --> 01:59:39,724
Look, man.

3520
01:59:39,758 --> 01:59:42,413
I love her, all right?

3521
01:59:42,448 --> 01:59:43,413
Her dad was right.

3522
01:59:43,448 --> 01:59:46,793
I made so many mistakes.

3523
01:59:46,827 --> 01:59:47,758
Ew.

3524
01:59:50,586 --> 01:59:51,896
We'll fix them.

3525
01:59:51,931 --> 01:59:52,931
But we're going to start
with fixing that shot.

3526
01:59:52,965 --> 01:59:55,413
Do you have a white dad?

3527
01:59:55,448 --> 01:59:56,793
I mean, it could be his mom.

3528
01:59:56,827 --> 01:59:58,275
It's not his mom.

3529
01:59:58,310 --> 02:00:01,379
Damn, I would love
to get views like this.

3530
02:00:01,413 --> 02:00:02,413
Sheesh.

3531
02:00:02,448 --> 02:00:03,724
Hey, you know what?

3532
02:00:03,758 --> 02:00:04,620
We're already out here.

3533
02:00:04,655 --> 02:00:06,413
We got these video phones.

3534
02:00:06,448 --> 02:00:09,551
Let's go out and shoot something
new and perk this guy up.

3535
02:00:09,586 --> 02:00:11,241
I got an idea.

3536
02:00:11,275 --> 02:00:13,965
What's up guys, it's
your boy, Shane Brooks.

3537
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,241
You sure this is a good idea?

3538
02:00:16,275 --> 02:00:16,896
I don't know.

3539
02:00:16,931 --> 02:00:17,793
Maybe.

3540
02:00:24,482 --> 02:00:25,379
Good idea.

3541
02:00:25,413 --> 02:00:26,034
Bad idea.

3542
02:00:26,068 --> 02:00:27,931
We need this.

3543
02:00:27,965 --> 02:00:33,793
Meet the creator of Hip-Hopper
on his YouTube channel.

3544
02:00:36,517 --> 02:00:40,586
Between hashtag family,
actual family, and all the stuff

3545
02:00:40,620 --> 02:00:42,896
you've been going
through, I think

3546
02:00:42,931 --> 02:00:44,620
the boys need a little fun.

3547
02:00:44,655 --> 02:00:45,965
We're going all
the way up there.

3548
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,724
I need to get on
Shane's Twitter.

3549
02:00:48,758 --> 02:00:50,724
I need to get all
the brands and stuff.

3550
02:00:50,758 --> 02:00:53,724
I need to make them
all come together.

3551
02:00:53,758 --> 02:00:55,034
We live, baby!

3552
02:00:55,068 --> 02:00:57,241
OK, Blade.

3553
02:00:57,275 --> 02:00:58,275
Let's do this.

3554
02:00:58,310 --> 02:01:00,034
[laughter]

3555
02:01:00,068 --> 02:01:01,827
Let's go.

3556
02:01:01,862 --> 02:01:04,000
And then I'm going
to combine them.

3557
02:01:04,034 --> 02:01:08,482
And throw them into
Vision Central.

3558
02:01:08,517 --> 02:01:10,655
Cam, models for runway.

3559
02:01:10,689 --> 02:01:11,965
Boom.

3560
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,482
Cam does the robot like
an idiot on runway.

3561
02:01:14,517 --> 02:01:15,827
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

3562
02:01:23,068 --> 02:01:25,655
I hate that I'm calling him
hot, but I'm going to do it.

3563
02:01:25,689 --> 02:01:31,344
Hot chef cooks for the homies.

3564
02:01:31,379 --> 02:01:32,172
What's up, guys?

3565
02:01:32,206 --> 02:01:34,000
It's your boy,
Shane Brooks here.

3566
02:01:34,034 --> 02:01:35,965
I just want to say thank you
so much for the 36 views.

3567
02:01:40,827 --> 02:01:41,620
You know what?

3568
02:01:41,655 --> 02:01:42,689
We're having fun.

3569
02:01:45,655 --> 02:01:46,620
And we're living it up.

3570
02:01:46,655 --> 02:01:47,965
Like this.

3571
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,655
It's all going to be
extreme, right on this page.

3572
02:01:49,689 --> 02:01:51,827
That'll lead to Vision
Central too, OK?

3573
02:01:51,862 --> 02:01:53,517
Take this video
of Mike, throw it

3574
02:01:53,551 --> 02:01:56,620
on the page, so they'll be
able to see model house,

3575
02:01:56,655 --> 02:02:00,862
runway, clothes matching.

3576
02:02:00,896 --> 02:02:02,379
We're doing it.

3577
02:02:02,413 --> 02:02:03,586
I want to teach you
guys a few dance moves

3578
02:02:03,620 --> 02:02:04,896
in case you want to learn.

3579
02:02:04,931 --> 02:02:07,551
And I got to dedicate
this to KatieQ45.

3580
02:02:07,586 --> 02:02:10,931
Thank you so much
for all your support.

3581
02:02:10,965 --> 02:02:13,034
Hey, yo, they done
gave Shade a go-kart.

3582
02:02:13,068 --> 02:02:14,137
[laughs]

3583
02:02:14,172 --> 02:02:16,448
Yo, let's go.

3584
02:02:16,482 --> 02:02:17,068
Let's go.

3585
02:02:20,448 --> 02:02:22,965
Now, this may not be perfect,
because I'm a little banged up.

3586
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,517
No, leave all those
excuses out of it.

3587
02:02:24,551 --> 02:02:25,137
All right?

3588
02:02:25,172 --> 02:02:28,413
Seize the day.

3589
02:02:28,448 --> 02:02:29,689
Hey, this is
Le'Veon Rooker here.

3590
02:02:29,724 --> 02:02:31,551
And this is my guy Shane Brooks.

3591
02:02:31,586 --> 02:02:32,551
And we're going to be here.

3592
02:02:32,586 --> 02:02:33,724
We're going to back him up.

3593
02:02:33,758 --> 02:02:36,034
Because we Vision
Central, right?

3594
02:02:36,068 --> 02:02:36,896
Yeah.

3595
02:02:36,931 --> 02:02:38,379
It goes where we go.

3596
02:02:38,413 --> 02:02:39,862
Anywhere the five
of us are together,

3597
02:02:39,896 --> 02:02:41,413
that's Vision Central.

3598
02:02:41,448 --> 02:02:42,517
So how about you show
them the vision, brother?

3599
02:02:42,551 --> 02:02:43,689
All right.

3600
02:02:43,724 --> 02:02:44,586
Did you say humph?

3601
02:02:44,620 --> 02:02:45,689
I say humph.

3602
02:02:45,724 --> 02:02:47,448
Oh, you got it down.

3603
02:02:47,482 --> 02:02:48,689
I got it now, brother.

3604
02:02:48,724 --> 02:02:51,586
Now show them what you do.

3605
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:52,551
I'm with you, bro, though.

3606
02:02:52,586 --> 02:02:54,034
Look, it's crazy.

3607
02:02:54,068 --> 02:02:56,068
Hip hop is all
about being loose.

3608
02:02:56,103 --> 02:02:58,137
So let's loosen our arms first.

3609
02:02:58,172 --> 02:02:59,758
OK.

3610
02:02:59,793 --> 02:03:02,655
And wip, wipe, wipe.

3611
02:03:02,689 --> 02:03:04,517
Now we're going to put
the butter on the bread.

3612
02:03:04,551 --> 02:03:05,758
And wham.

3613
02:03:05,793 --> 02:03:06,827
Boom, boom, boom.

3614
02:03:06,862 --> 02:03:08,448
And slide that foot up.

3615
02:03:08,482 --> 02:03:10,103
We're going to drive the
whip, and come back, right?

3616
02:03:10,137 --> 02:03:12,620
And then flip that bottom lip.

3617
02:03:12,655 --> 02:03:13,862
Stop playing.

3618
02:03:13,896 --> 02:03:17,655
Stop playing with my boy, man.

3619
02:03:17,689 --> 02:03:18,758
[interposing voices]

3620
02:03:18,793 --> 02:03:21,758
Vision Central.

3621
02:03:21,793 --> 02:03:22,827
Right here.

3622
02:03:28,103 --> 02:03:30,068
We got all the Cam
stuff, that's going to go

3623
02:03:30,103 --> 02:03:32,448
organized like this, like this.

3624
02:03:32,482 --> 02:03:34,068
So it won't be extreme
right on this page.

3625
02:03:34,103 --> 02:03:35,206
I won in the slides.

3626
02:03:35,241 --> 02:03:36,448
I won.

3627
02:03:36,482 --> 02:03:37,482
I won that shit.

3628
02:03:37,517 --> 02:03:38,551
All right.

3629
02:03:38,586 --> 02:03:41,103
Ladies in our booth,
so I can give them that--

3630
02:03:41,137 --> 02:03:42,965
My God.

3631
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,448
Yo, you need to chill
out with all that.

3632
02:03:45,482 --> 02:03:48,068
The only one that's going to
be doing that bang is your boy.

3633
02:03:48,103 --> 02:03:49,137
Now, who are you talking?

3634
02:03:49,172 --> 02:03:49,931
Yo.

3635
02:03:49,965 --> 02:03:51,068
This shit my work.

3636
02:03:51,103 --> 02:03:54,482
This shit my work, yo.

3637
02:03:54,517 --> 02:03:55,517
Ain't nobody here.

3638
02:03:55,551 --> 02:03:56,137
It's all good.

3639
02:03:56,172 --> 02:03:57,000
It's all good.

3640
02:04:08,206 --> 02:04:10,724
That wouldn't even make
the fridge in my house.

3641
02:04:10,758 --> 02:04:11,655
You don't have a fridge.

3642
02:04:11,689 --> 02:04:14,551
Everything's so abstract.

3643
02:04:14,586 --> 02:04:16,137
Cam Weston.

3644
02:04:16,172 --> 02:04:17,896
Why are you looking
so mopey, bro?

3645
02:04:17,931 --> 02:04:19,034
Why don't you tell
the people back home

3646
02:04:19,068 --> 02:04:20,758
what brought you here?

3647
02:04:20,793 --> 02:04:22,655
What we doing all the way on
the other side of the world?

3648
02:04:22,689 --> 02:04:24,137
Not right now, man.

3649
02:04:24,172 --> 02:04:24,862
Please.

3650
02:04:24,896 --> 02:04:26,862
Not in the mood.

3651
02:04:26,896 --> 02:04:28,896
But you could talk to me.

3652
02:04:28,931 --> 02:04:30,827
That's what brothers
are for, man.

3653
02:04:30,862 --> 02:04:33,586
I don't have anything to say.

3654
02:04:33,620 --> 02:04:38,586
I failed, I lost again.

3655
02:04:38,620 --> 02:04:41,827
I don't want to be like
this on camera, man.

3656
02:04:41,862 --> 02:04:42,655
My bad, bro.

3657
02:04:42,689 --> 02:04:43,517
My bad.

3658
02:04:49,172 --> 02:04:52,655
Let me try something.

3659
02:04:52,689 --> 02:04:53,862
Hey, y'all.

3660
02:04:53,896 --> 02:04:55,172
It's Le'Veon Rooker here.

3661
02:04:55,206 --> 02:04:57,517
And I'm sure you're
wondering what we're doing

3662
02:04:57,551 --> 02:04:59,689
on the other side of the world.

3663
02:04:59,724 --> 02:05:05,896
Look, I come from a pretty rough
family that doesn't support you

3664
02:05:05,931 --> 02:05:07,758
or your dreams.

3665
02:05:07,793 --> 02:05:11,034
We're, like, the definition
of dysfunctional.

3666
02:05:11,068 --> 02:05:13,586
And and that's why this--

3667
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:16,931
us, is so important.

3668
02:05:16,965 --> 02:05:19,620
Because we brothers, and
we got to be there for you,

3669
02:05:19,655 --> 02:05:20,724
for each other.

3670
02:05:20,758 --> 02:05:24,275
You know, we didn't come
out here just to vacation.

3671
02:05:24,310 --> 02:05:28,586
We came out here because
we got your back, bro.

3672
02:05:28,620 --> 02:05:32,724
And we're going to
do this together.

3673
02:05:32,758 --> 02:05:35,034
Hashtag family?

3674
02:05:35,068 --> 02:05:37,586
Man, don't be a smart-ass.

3675
02:05:42,758 --> 02:05:44,758
All right.

3676
02:05:44,793 --> 02:05:45,931
What was that?

3677
02:05:48,275 --> 02:05:51,068
OK.

3678
02:05:51,103 --> 02:05:56,241
So, Cam Weston, what
brought you here?

3679
02:05:56,275 --> 02:06:01,103
The fact that I fucked
up so bad that I had to.

3680
02:06:01,137 --> 02:06:04,275
I came for my family.

3681
02:06:04,310 --> 02:06:08,344
The thought of being
without the one that I love,

3682
02:06:08,379 --> 02:06:13,310
it's like having a
vision without a purpose.

3683
02:06:13,344 --> 02:06:16,827
Like I walk down the runway,
just trying to look good.

3684
02:06:16,862 --> 02:06:21,689
But with Nef, she inspired
me to be purposeful.

3685
02:06:21,724 --> 02:06:23,689
And I fucked up.

3686
02:06:27,068 --> 02:06:30,000
So I'm here.

3687
02:06:32,689 --> 02:06:35,724
Now, can we please
turn this camera off?

3688
02:06:38,689 --> 02:06:41,827
Hey, bro.

3689
02:06:41,862 --> 02:06:43,862
I love you, man.

3690
02:06:43,896 --> 02:06:45,000
I love you too, man.

3691
02:06:51,862 --> 02:06:53,413
You love them phones too.

3692
02:06:53,448 --> 02:06:55,655
[laughter]

3693
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:58,965
Yeah, I don't know.

3694
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,172
I think it might catch on.

3695
02:07:06,931 --> 02:07:07,862
Thank you, man.

3696
02:07:07,896 --> 02:07:08,793
Yeah.

3697
02:07:15,827 --> 02:07:17,931
I can do my own thing.

3698
02:07:17,965 --> 02:07:21,724
I can get a job on my own.

3699
02:07:21,758 --> 02:07:23,862
And Cam?

3700
02:07:23,896 --> 02:07:26,344
Do you still love him?

3701
02:07:26,379 --> 02:07:29,172
He had big dreams, you know.

3702
02:07:29,206 --> 02:07:31,034
And he wanted to make
me a part of them.

3703
02:07:31,068 --> 02:07:33,896
But we might be together.

3704
02:07:33,931 --> 02:07:36,862
I don't really know if
he knows what that means,

3705
02:07:36,896 --> 02:07:38,724
or what it would take.

3706
02:07:38,758 --> 02:07:40,724
And I don't want to be
responsible for changing

3707
02:07:40,758 --> 02:07:42,034
his whole life.

3708
02:07:42,068 --> 02:07:43,241
I can't even figure out my own.

3709
02:07:52,068 --> 02:07:54,793
Hey, are you OK?

3710
02:07:54,827 --> 02:07:55,482
Yeah.
Yeah.

3711
02:07:55,517 --> 02:07:56,724
Are you sure?

3712
02:07:56,758 --> 02:07:57,448
Yeah.

3713
02:07:57,482 --> 02:07:59,896
I'm just really tired, you know.

3714
02:07:59,931 --> 02:08:00,413
And I haven't slept.

3715
02:08:05,517 --> 02:08:09,103
Um, Nef, would
it change your mind

3716
02:08:09,137 --> 02:08:10,965
if he were here in the UAE?

3717
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,965
Would you still say no.

3718
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,965
Wait, is he here?

3719
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:16,413
Take a look at this.

3720
02:08:20,344 --> 02:08:21,965
There is no way he
would have came here

3721
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:22,862
and not tried to see you.

3722
02:08:22,896 --> 02:08:23,551
I fucked up.

3723
02:08:23,586 --> 02:08:27,068
You should talk to your dad.

3724
02:08:27,103 --> 02:08:28,172
My dad?

3725
02:08:31,448 --> 02:08:32,275
My dad.

3726
02:08:37,103 --> 02:08:40,137
I came for my family.

3727
02:08:40,172 --> 02:08:44,103
I never really thought about
having one, but now I do.

3728
02:08:44,137 --> 02:08:49,241
And the thought of being
without the one that I love--

3729
02:08:49,275 --> 02:08:54,137
So this is the
guy you left behind?

3730
02:08:54,172 --> 02:08:55,862
Maybe you left him for a reason.

3731
02:08:55,896 --> 02:08:58,482
And maybe my only
reason was a mistake.

3732
02:08:58,517 --> 02:09:01,862
His bleeding heart can't
pay your medical bills.

3733
02:09:01,896 --> 02:09:03,103
He's a pauper.

3734
02:09:03,137 --> 02:09:07,068
And I said nothing of a paupers'
potential to ascend class

3735
02:09:07,103 --> 02:09:09,172
through hard work and study.

3736
02:09:09,206 --> 02:09:13,551
But he's either incapable of
rising, or unwilling to try.

3737
02:09:13,586 --> 02:09:15,862
Unwilling?

3738
02:09:15,896 --> 02:09:19,034
It looks very much
like he's trying, Farouk.

3739
02:09:19,068 --> 02:09:21,034
Yes, he is trying.

3740
02:09:21,068 --> 02:09:22,206
He's here, isn't he?

3741
02:09:22,241 --> 02:09:23,344
And I'm going to see him.

3742
02:09:23,379 --> 02:09:25,206
He has nothing for you.

3743
02:09:25,241 --> 02:09:26,620
Passion.

3744
02:09:26,655 --> 02:09:27,620
Talent.

3745
02:09:27,655 --> 02:09:28,862
Intelligence.

3746
02:09:31,551 --> 02:09:32,517
Farouk.

3747
02:09:32,551 --> 02:09:34,000
[speaking foreign language]

3748
02:09:34,034 --> 02:09:36,137
Darling, calm yourself.

3749
02:09:36,172 --> 02:09:37,896
I trust him.

3750
02:09:37,931 --> 02:09:39,137
Then I raised the fool.

3751
02:09:39,172 --> 02:09:40,482
Then trust me.

3752
02:09:44,896 --> 02:09:47,034
Nefertari.

[speaking foreign language]

3754
02:09:49,896 --> 02:09:50,517
Look at me.

3755
02:09:50,551 --> 02:09:51,206
Look at me.

3756

[speaking foreign language]

3757
02:10:37,068 --> 02:10:38,000
Yo, you see that shit?

3758
02:10:38,034 --> 02:10:40,862
That's wild.

3759
02:10:40,896 --> 02:10:42,068
Wow.

3760
02:10:42,103 --> 02:10:43,034
Yo, this place is beautiful.

3761
02:10:43,068 --> 02:10:45,000
I hope we don't go back.

3762
02:10:45,034 --> 02:10:48,137
Hey.

3763
02:10:48,172 --> 02:10:49,482
Oh, shit.

3764
02:10:49,517 --> 02:10:50,137
What?

3765
02:10:50,172 --> 02:10:51,137
Oh, shit.

3766
02:10:51,172 --> 02:10:52,310
I got 26,000 subscribers?

3767
02:10:52,344 --> 02:10:54,862
Looks like the
cat's out the bag.

3768
02:10:54,896 --> 02:10:56,137
Yeah, nigga.

3769
02:10:56,172 --> 02:10:57,310
Check the group page.

3770
02:10:57,344 --> 02:10:58,310
I'm on it.

3771
02:10:58,344 --> 02:10:59,172
Yo, bro.

3772
02:10:59,206 --> 02:11:00,551
That's nuts.

3773
02:11:00,586 --> 02:11:06,965
Yo, we have
630,000 subscribers.

3774
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,620
Yo, fuck around.

3775
02:11:08,655 --> 02:11:09,448
Fuck around.

3776
02:11:09,482 --> 02:11:11,689
Yo, and that's
just in three days.

3777
02:11:11,724 --> 02:11:12,517
Yo.

3778
02:11:12,551 --> 02:11:13,586
Ow.

3779
02:11:13,620 --> 02:11:15,206
Guys, this is
going to be huge.

3780
02:11:15,241 --> 02:11:17,000
Man, fuck hashtag family.

3781
02:11:17,034 --> 02:11:18,206
It's us, brothers.

3782
02:11:18,241 --> 02:11:19,379
