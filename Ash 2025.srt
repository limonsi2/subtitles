Said that Clarke had

Turned on the crew.

Is she the one that did
this to you?

- Clarke.

Any idea where she might be?

No. When I woke up,
there was no one left.

[Brion] That's how it works.
For the first year, at least.

One of us has to stay up there.

To establish comms with

Uh, yeah. Actually,
just right before you got here.

Nothing major.

288
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:50,334
There's some swelling in
the brain.

289
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:52,785
Most likely caused by
blunt force trauma.

290

But fever, memory loss.

291

It says here they're all side
effects of the swelling.

00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:04,348
But I'll remember everything
eventually, right?

293
00:23:04,452 --> 00:23:05,970
You should still have
your technical memory

and all the skills that you've
learned.

No.

00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:55,364
You and I. We were talking about
why we joined the program?

306
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:58,678
There's something about the way
you spoke.

307
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:01,612
Like, it wasn't about making
a sacrifice.

308
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:04,719
It was about needing answers.

309
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:07,376
Like what was out there.

310
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,378
Wasn't enough for you.

311
00:24:10,103 --> 00:24:13,037
See, you don't remember
who you are.

312
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:16,869
But somehow you're still exactly
the same.

313

Get some rest.

[Riya] I can't imagine her
still being out there.

324
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:27,965
If she is, she's got to be
running low on oxygen by now.

325
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:31,141
She may have tried to find
shelter.

Sandstorms out here are

Maybe we can find her.

Shit.

00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:49,711
What if she needs our help?

333
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:53,439
Maybe she got infected
by something out there.

334
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:56,407
Lost her mind. Killed everyone.

335
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:59,065
[Brion] We need to forget
about Clarke.

336
00:27:00,135 --> 00:27:02,482
Listen,
the station is on standby.

337
00:27:02,828 --> 00:27:05,382
Running basic life support
systems only.

338
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:08,109
We're running out of oxygen.

339
00:27:09,524 --> 00:27:11,250
So what's the plan after this?

340
00:27:11,353 --> 00:27:13,183
[Brion] We need to get off this
planet as soon as possible.

341
00:27:13,286 --> 00:27:14,771
That is our priority.

342
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:16,842
Everything else, including...

343
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:18,982
trying to figure out
what the fuck happened here,

344
00:27:19,258 --> 00:27:20,604

00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:23,952
[Brion] Big picture.

347
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:25,989
First, we got to get back up to
the Orbital.

348
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:28,060
Which ain't easy.

349
00:27:28,163 --> 00:27:30,545
Our rotation and satellite's
orbit have to line-up exactly.

350
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,031
- Next line-up is in 12 hours.

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm cool.

You don't seem cool.

Hey, I'm fine. I'm just...

I'm tired. That's all.
I haven't slept that well.

364
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:28,741
It's your patch. It's out of
juice. If you want, I can go--

365
00:28:28,845 --> 00:28:30,881
I just need you to give me
fucking space.

366

I'm sorry.

Where is it?

00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:33,917
[Brion] Every minute we don't
fix this,

409
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:35,608
we lose ten hours of
breathable air.

Someone's been in here?

416
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:05,776
[Brion] Yeah, probably tried
some sort of manual fix

417

Alright.

441
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:09,141
So, we are going off the theory,
and correct me if I'm wrong,

442
00:35:09,624 --> 00:35:11,488
that Clarke came into contact

443
00:35:11,592 --> 00:35:13,352
- with some sort of--
- A pathogen, yes.

444
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:14,733
Somewhere out there.

445
00:35:14,836 --> 00:35:16,769
And it triggered
some sort of psychotic break.

449
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:27,194
Alright,
so maybe this infection...

450
00:35:28,298 --> 00:35:29,679
is changing her.

451
00:35:30,611 --> 00:35:33,614

I mean, I don't know. Yes.

00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:34,925
Yeah, maybe, but...

453
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:39,033
It's just something is not
adding up.

454
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,621
Yeah, well,
it's not gonna add up.

455
00:35:41,035 --> 00:35:42,519
I mean, not for a while.

456
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:44,383
You know, we're still missing
most of the picture here.

457
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:45,867
Well, we fill it in.

What? Say it.

00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:59,226
We just lost 30% of our oxygen.

463
00:35:59,812 --> 00:36:02,815
We don't have time to fill
anything in.

Okay, we have to take
the next line-up in five hours.

Riya! You are not listening to
me, okay?

It is tonight, or we die.

All right? We suffocate.

And all of this,
all of this was for nothing.

470
00:36:25,321 --> 00:36:26,908
We're just gonna leave
her behind.

We're gonna leave Clarke
behind?

We don't have a choice, Ri.

Not with the time frame
that we are working with. Okay?

474
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:35,123
We still have to make it back to
my lander,

475
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:36,987
and that's 25 minutes easy.

476
00:36:37,885 --> 00:36:39,749
Okay? And we still don't even
know what the fuck

477
00:36:39,852 --> 00:36:41,544
is going on with Clarke.

478
00:36:41,647 --> 00:36:44,305
Okay? She is not worth the risk.

479
00:36:49,034 --> 00:36:49,966
Okay.

480
00:36:50,932 --> 00:36:51,761
Okay.

of this. I promise.

something.

we've done.

there's not a lot out there,

513
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:07,465
but I'm not really missing
Earth much.

514
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:09,363
This place is amazing.

515
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,779
[Clarke] You'd leave
in a heartbeat for a pizza.

516
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:14,230
- [crowd chuckling]
- [Kevin] Okay.

517
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:17,198
[Riya] I don't think I'll ever
get used to these views.

518
00:41:17,302 --> 00:41:18,683
[Clarke] Mm, mm.

519
00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:20,132
[Kevin] I like the view of you
in that space suit.

- [Clarke chuckles]
- Shut up.

523
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:25,655
[Davis] My room
is right next to both of theirs.

- [Clarke] Oh, I know!
- [Davis laughing]

525
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:29,694
- [Riya] Stop, guys. -[Davis]
Just imagine the sounds.

526
00:41:29,797 --> 00:41:31,489
- [Riya] Guys, focus, come on.
- [Clarke] I can hear it too.

527
00:41:31,592 --> 00:41:33,698
- They can't help themselves.

- [Davis] My man is terrible.

529
00:41:35,803 --> 00:41:37,184
[Kevin] Guys, I think we're
getting closer.

530
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:38,530
It's got to be here.

531
00:41:38,634 --> 00:41:39,738
[Riya] Are you sure?
Because if you're not...

532
00:41:39,842 --> 00:41:40,774
You're going to cook dinner
tonight.

533
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:42,016
[Clarke] That's a fucking no.

534
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,570
[Davis] Yeah, no. Yeah,
please no.

535
00:41:43,673 --> 00:41:44,778
- [Davis] Please no.
- [Kevin] Oh, you're what?

536
00:41:44,881 --> 00:41:46,504
[Riya] What are you guys talking
about?

537
00:41:46,607 --> 00:41:48,126
All we have is beans and rice.

538
00:41:48,229 --> 00:41:49,679
- [Davis] I need no more of
that shit. -[crowd chuckling]

539
00:41:49,783 --> 00:41:51,336
[Kevin] Hey, guys,
I think we're here.

540
00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:53,234
This is the exact spot
that Brion

541
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:54,581
pinpointed the emissions to.

542
00:41:54,684 --> 00:41:55,927
[Riya] Really?

543
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,445
[Kevin] It's just past
these rocks.

544
00:41:58,032 --> 00:42:00,069
- [Clarke] Are you sure?
- [Kevin] Yeah.

545
00:42:00,828 --> 00:42:02,209
[Kevin] Can you believe it?

546
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:04,142
- [Riya] Holy shit. Look at this.
- [Kevin] This is insane.

547
00:42:04,867 --> 00:42:06,006
[Clarke] Oh my God.

548
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:07,663
[Kevin] Kevin. Home.

549
00:42:07,973 --> 00:42:10,562
- [Davis] Dude, I knew it.
- [Kevin] They were right.

550
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:12,495
- [Davis] It's fucking
manufactured.

551
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,083
- [Kevin] This is amazing.

552
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:17,569
The whole atmosphere is
manufactured. They made it.

553
00:42:17,673 --> 00:42:19,744
[Clarke chuckles]
How many of these are there?

554
00:42:19,847 --> 00:42:21,090
[Kevin] Across the whole planet?

555
00:42:21,193 --> 00:42:22,816
Dozens, maybe hundreds,
maybe more.

556
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:24,852
At least to the extent
that Brion could observe it.

557
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:26,820
Emission signatures,
they get a little diffused

558
00:42:26,923 --> 00:42:28,891
by the time they reach orbit.
I mean, this is it.

559
00:42:28,994 --> 00:42:31,376
- We did it, guys. We did it.
- [Clarke] Holy shit!

560
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:33,930
[Kevin exclaiming] Let's go.

561
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:36,001
- [Riya] How deep is it?
- [Clarke] Whoa!

562
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,589
[Davis] Hang on,
let me find out.

563
00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:42,560
[Clarke] Just-- just be careful,
all right?

564
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:44,838
[Davis] Oh, you guys, come on.
I can handle it.

565
00:42:50,188 --> 00:42:52,293
One. Two.

566
00:42:52,846 --> 00:42:56,746
Three. Four. Five.

567
00:42:58,955 --> 00:42:59,991
Whoa.

568
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:04,582
[Davis] Hang on, guys.
I think I see--

569
00:43:05,893 --> 00:43:08,102
- [eerie music playing]
- [gasps]

570
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:09,207
[Kevin] Davis!

571
00:43:10,726 --> 00:43:12,417
[Kevin] No!

572
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,660
[Clarke] Oh my God!

573
00:43:13,763 --> 00:43:15,385
[Riya] Careful! Careful!

574
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:16,904
[Kevin] Guys! Guys!

575
00:43:22,254 --> 00:43:23,255
[Kevin] What's happening?

576
00:43:24,532 --> 00:43:26,120
[Kevin] We gotta get out
of here.

577
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,398
[Kevin] What are we doing here.
Let's go!

578
00:43:41,688 --> 00:43:43,310
- [Brion] What's this?
- [gasps]

579
00:43:46,313 --> 00:43:47,694
You knew.

580
00:43:48,764 --> 00:43:49,868
What are you talking about?

581
00:43:56,116 --> 00:43:57,117
[sighs]

582
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,327
[sniffles]

583
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:03,917
You can explain, right?

584
00:44:04,814 --> 00:44:06,195
Listen to me.

585
00:44:06,782 --> 00:44:08,335
I didn't know.

586
00:44:08,784 --> 00:44:09,923
[Brion] Not for sure.

587
00:44:10,613 --> 00:44:14,099
[Brion] I knew that you went on
a mission, but you went dark.

588
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:16,343
The entire station went
dark, okay?

589
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:18,897
I didn't know that this was
how-- how Dav--

590
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:21,141
You knew why we were out there.

591
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:23,626
You knew.

592
00:44:24,316 --> 00:44:26,733
Kevin talks about it in
the fucking video.

593
00:44:30,253 --> 00:44:32,877
[Riya] This entire time you saw
me go around in fucking circles

594
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,673
over and over trying to decipher
what the fuck had happened

595
00:44:35,776 --> 00:44:38,917
to Kevin, to Clarke, to Audie,
to Davis.

596
00:44:39,021 --> 00:44:42,507
I was going fucking crazy
when the entire time you knew

597
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,612
this planet was being
terraformed.

598
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:45,924
There was a window.

599
00:44:46,028 --> 00:44:48,202
Okay, I had a mission
and a window,

600
00:44:48,306 --> 00:44:50,515
and the only way to
fulfill the mission

601
00:44:50,618 --> 00:44:51,965
was to keep things under
control during--

602
00:44:52,068 --> 00:44:54,070
To keep me
under control! Me!

603
00:44:54,174 --> 00:44:56,970
Because I know you, okay?
I know how you are.

604
00:44:58,385 --> 00:45:01,871
You may have lost your memory,
but you haven't changed at all.

605
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:05,599
Okay, why can't you just let
it go? For once.

606
00:45:06,082 --> 00:45:09,707
For once, until we are up there.
Until we are safe.

607
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,195
Because I killed them.

608
00:45:16,265 --> 00:45:17,438
What?

609
00:45:18,854 --> 00:45:19,924
What'd you--

610
00:45:21,477 --> 00:45:22,789
I killed Kev.

611
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:27,069
I killed Audie, and I...

612
00:45:28,449 --> 00:45:29,830
I just don't know...

613
00:45:36,457 --> 00:45:37,838
I don't know why I did it.

614
00:45:39,564 --> 00:45:40,738
I don't.

615
00:45:41,877 --> 00:45:43,085
I just...

616
00:45:47,986 --> 00:45:50,057
If we leave this station,
I'm never gonna know.

617
00:45:51,403 --> 00:45:53,474
I-- I-- I need to know.

618
00:45:53,578 --> 00:45:56,857
- Brion, I need to know.
I can't leave. -Hey, hey, hey.

619
00:45:57,824 --> 00:45:59,273
What are you saying to me?

620
00:46:01,172 --> 00:46:02,138
I don't...

621
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:04,796
I don't know why I did it.

622
00:46:08,524 --> 00:46:09,870
These patches...

623
00:46:13,046 --> 00:46:14,564
When they're fading, I've...

624
00:46:15,013 --> 00:46:16,394
I start having more memories.

625
00:46:16,497 --> 00:46:18,327
I can remember everything,
and it comes back faster.

626
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,363
Maybe-- maybe we can...

627
00:46:20,847 --> 00:46:22,020
we can wait for two more hours.

628
00:46:22,124 --> 00:46:23,297
They've been coming quicker and
quicker.

629
00:46:23,401 --> 00:46:24,782
[Brion] Not a chance.
Not a chance.

630
00:46:24,885 --> 00:46:27,094
- Why not?!
- Because I don't trust you!

631
00:46:27,543 --> 00:46:28,509
Okay?!

632
00:46:35,137 --> 00:46:37,380
[scoffs] All right,
listen to me.

633
00:46:37,484 --> 00:46:38,623
I...

634
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,076
I trust you. I just don't know
the person that did this.

635
00:46:44,422 --> 00:46:47,149
Okay? And I don't know
who you would become

636
00:46:47,252 --> 00:46:49,289
if you stopped using these
things.

637
00:46:54,466 --> 00:46:55,985
We were gonna go up there.

638
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,885
What if I...

639
00:47:00,334 --> 00:47:03,544
- if I don't remember?
- Then you don't remember.

640
00:47:04,442 --> 00:47:06,582
And you live with it.

641
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:10,897
[Brion] Riya.

642
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:13,278
Listen to me.

643
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:15,211
You and I...

644
00:47:15,971 --> 00:47:17,524
we have a purpose.

645
00:47:19,146 --> 00:47:20,251
Okay?

646
00:47:20,665 --> 00:47:24,876
We sacrificed our lives on Earth
to come out here for a reason.

647
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:26,567
This.

648
00:47:27,534 --> 00:47:29,467
This is about our species.

649
00:47:31,434 --> 00:47:32,815
The big picture.

650
00:47:33,367 --> 00:47:35,438
Okay? What we have
uncovered here,

651
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:39,615
proof of alien intelligence
somewhere out there.

652
00:47:39,718 --> 00:47:42,929

Please respond.

Ground station, do you copy?

822
01:03:55,038 --> 01:03:56,384
This is the Orbital.

823
01:03:57,730 --> 01:04:00,008
Ground station, please respond.

- [Audie] It's everywhere.

827
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:45,467
[Riya] Take a sample.
Bring it to the lab.

[thundering]

836
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:15,256
It seems like it attached itself
to our mainframe.

837
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:16,740
Yeah, it spread from there.

838
01:05:16,843 --> 01:05:18,121
I dug a hole in the wall to see
how far.

839
01:05:18,224 --> 01:05:20,123
And it's-- it's mostly isolated

840
01:05:20,226 --> 01:05:22,332
- to the airlock and the control
room. -For now.

841
01:05:22,435 --> 01:05:24,644
What if it's been studying us
ever since we landed?

842
01:05:24,748 --> 01:05:27,268
Exactly. Waiting for the right
moment to shut us down.

843
01:05:27,371 --> 01:05:28,821
[Audie] When's the next line-up?

[soft music playing]

The next line-up. When is it?

[stutters]

848
01:05:38,762 --> 01:05:40,384
- Thirteen hours.
- [Kevin] Got it.

849
01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:42,421
- I'll pack up the lab and I'll
meet you... -No, no, wait.

850
01:05:42,524 --> 01:05:45,872
- We're leaving.
- Riya, we're following protocol.

851
01:05:46,218 --> 01:05:47,322
Fuck the protocol.

852
01:05:47,426 --> 01:05:48,737
- This is what we've been
waiting-- -No!

853
01:05:48,841 --> 01:05:50,463
Protocol exists for a reason.

854
01:05:50,877 --> 01:05:53,294
We need to get out of here
before that thing spreads.

855
01:05:56,228 --> 01:06:00,611
- Protect the mission. -The
mission? This is the mission.

856
01:06:01,302 --> 01:06:03,373
Do you guys remember why
we signed up?

857
01:06:04,408 --> 01:06:05,340
All of us.

858
01:06:06,859 --> 01:06:08,826
Everything we sacrificed.

859
01:06:09,517 --> 01:06:12,796
That the best case scenario, we
would grow old light years away

860
01:06:12,899 --> 01:06:14,384
from everything we've
ever known.

861
01:06:19,941 --> 01:06:21,115
It's out there.

862
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:23,220
Right now.

863
01:06:23,807 --> 01:06:27,569
An actual solution. The
technology to create a new world

864
01:06:27,673 --> 01:06:30,572
where we don't get poisoned
by the air we're breathing.
