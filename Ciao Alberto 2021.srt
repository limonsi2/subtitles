Dear Alberto, guess what?

00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,637
We got to use the big telescope
at school today!

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:16,599
It can see really far
but not Portorosso far.

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,395
Tell me how everything's going.
Miss you. Ciao, Luca.

7
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:24,190
Dear Luca,
life in Portorosso is awesome.

8
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,734
-Everything's perfect.

9
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:26,985
Oh.

10
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,862
Whoa.

11
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,155
Sono libero!

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,452
Woo-hoo!

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,329
Especially my new job.

14
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,874
I'm kinda the greatest fisherman
in the entire world.

15
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,876
Besides Massimo, of course.

16
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,882
Me and him, we're like pasta and pesto.

17
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,426
Massimo tells me everything.

18
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,775
Well, he would...

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,654
if he talked, which he doesn't. Ever.

20
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,115
Unless I'm breaking a rule.

21
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,242
-And even then, it's not much.

22
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,869
But I think he'll come around.

23
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,663
I'm gonna be the perfect employee,

24
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,876
and I'll make Massimo proud.

25
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,045
-- Ciao.
-- Alberto!

26
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,884
I know, I know,
I shouldn't use the boat on my own.

27
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,968
Am I fired?

28
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,971
-You're late.

29
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,974
-No problem. I got this! Be right back!
-Oh! I...

30
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,354
-Delivery!

31
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,612
Yes!

32
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,991
Dude, I don't mean to brag,
but Giulia's got some serious competition.

33
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,287
Am I fired?

34
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,381
-Lunch is on me!
-Huh?

35
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,590
Scusi, big guy.

36
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,384
Uh...

37
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,970
Hey, come on. I got this.

38
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,682
Okay, step one, sauce.

39
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,518
-Step two, fire.

40
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,066
Mangia?

41
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,655
Buongiorno, Massimo.

42
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,658
Just wait.

43
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,885
-Uh...

44
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,530
-Machiavelli, how did you get here?

45
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:21,159
He won't mind. Once he sees
the big catch we bring in, right?

46
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,368
I'll make him proud.

47
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,830
"Meow" yourself.

48
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,500
The fire's leaking.
The fire's leaking!

49
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,968
-Massimo, I didn't mean to--

50
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,102
-Massimo.

51
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,665
What are you doing?

52
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,628
I quit.

53
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,589
I can't do it. I'm not good at this.

54
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,009
I'm not good at being your... employee.

55
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,178
No.

56
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,222
Why do you even care?
You don't even like me.

57
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,057
You don't even talk to me.

58
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,394
Alberto!

59
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,441
-Ma, Alberto--
-Just let me go, Dad!

60
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,498
I once made my father so angry,

61
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,918
he punched a hole in a brick wall.

62
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,088
Really?

63
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,591
And then what happened?

64
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,720
Well, we fixed it.

65
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,943
I feel like we're gonna need
a lot more paint.

66
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,154
Ah! She's seen worse, you know.

67
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,614
-Worse than fire?
-Oh, sure!

68
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,951
Storms. Waves taller than the pescheria.

69
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,411
Whoa.

70
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,371
Um, try that.

71
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,041
-Oh!

72
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,625
Wait! Back to the waves thing,

73
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,128
what's the craziest storm
you've ever sailed through?

74
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,965
Oh-ho. Once I was caught
in a hurricane with two eyes.

75
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,259
No! Tell me everything.
