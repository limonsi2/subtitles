3
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,003
Father, are you ever afraid?

4
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,778
I've done too many
exorcisms over the years

5
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,443
to be truly afraid anymore.

6
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,108
But I've seen too much outside
of the norm not to be wary.

7
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,510
Tell us about Amy.

8
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,828
Amy kinderman is a young woman

9
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,668
who has struggling with
possession since she was 14.

10
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,648
Her mother came to me about six months ago

11
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,800
to see if I could help.

12
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,818
I've had a few interviews with Amy

13
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,958
and I've seen all the signs.

14
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,573
The destructive behavior,

15
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,638
the abuse of her mother and others.

16
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,983
So now you try an exorcism?

17
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,643
I have to do more than try.

18
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,353
Father benna, is god enough?

19
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,953
He or she has to be.

20
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,103
That's Amy and her mother.

21
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,100
Please come in.

22
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,003
Father, do you want me to stay?

23
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,700
I think it's best if
you come back later.

24
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,923
But what about the cameras?

25
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,478
I've done five exorcisms
since we've started the show.

26
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,418
And the cameras haven't made a difference.

27
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,373
And they will be an important
document once the show airs.

28
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,753
Amy, please have a seat
and we can begin our work.

29
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,540
Okay, father.

30
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,023
She's in good hands.

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,753
The hands are the easy part.

32
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,528
It's when he makes me
touch the other things.

33
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,938
He says they're holy.

34
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,298
He says it's different than the other boys

35
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,253
because he's a man of god.

36
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,468
That's the devil talking.

37
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,397
That's right, spank the devil out of me!

38
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:24,078
The demon deceives.

39
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,038
I've been very bad, daddy.

40
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,433
Show me again what bad girls get.

41
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,938
These are a demon's oldest tricks.

42
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,838
You're just as bad as any other priest.

43
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
We're leaving.

44
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,193
And you're not even on basic cable.

45
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,033
I think your show just got canceled.

46
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,633
Better luck next time, priest.

47
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,698
Did you get that?

48
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,700
Get what?

49
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,553
I'm finished.

50
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,318
What could be worse?

51
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,568
It has been that written that Noah,

52
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,698
son of lamech, was the 10th patriarch,

53
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,548
and at the age of 500 years,

54
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,485
fathered shem, japheth, and ham.

55
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:59,223
And shem fathered arpachshad,

56
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,708
and arpachshad down through
his descendants begat Abraham.

57
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,708
Japheth begat magog and gomer

58
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,618
and many children who became kin to man.

59
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,708
It was ham who begat canaan

60
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,958
and called upon him a curse.

61
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,928
It was not the first curse of Noah,

62
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,258
but the only to be known today.

63
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,055
The other curse of Noah
landed upon his son zadkiel,

64
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:23,118
and thus, is his name lost today.

65
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,382
His name exists only in the
book of the witch of endor,

66
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:28,158
which was struck from the Bible.

67
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,888
The witch herself was nearly
struck from the book of Samuel

68
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,828
for necromancy and wizardry,

69
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,828
and thus was her writing
lost for centuries.

70
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,368
But we find in the book of the witch

71
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,938
that zadkiel believed
in the covenant of Noah

72
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,178
and worked alongside
his fathers and brothers

73
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,528
in the building of the ark,

74
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,903
which the animals would go in two by two.

75
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,645
But zadkiel rested when the others did not

76
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:52,099
and found himself by a lake.

77
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,608
And that is where he found the devil.

78
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,858
In those days, a demon could
come in the form of a snake,

79
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,998
as one did to Adam and Eve,

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,358
or in the form of other
creatures of an evil nature.

81
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,135
So it was on that day that zadkiel,

82
00:07:06,137 --> 00:07:09,275
son of Noah, first met the shark.

83
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:12,328
The shark spoke to zadkiel
of the coming flood

84
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,528
and asked to be taken upon the ark,

85
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,408
but zadkiel said unto the shark

86
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,608
that his father Noah had
already picked the two

87
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,548
that would go together.

88
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,462
It was then that the demon shark
made a bargain with zadkiel

89
00:07:24,464 --> 00:07:27,048
and that bargain was that the
shark would protect zadkiel

90
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,725
from all the creatures of god

91
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:31,238
and would be the master of the coyote,

92
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,968
the hawk, the lion, the grizzly,

93
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,818
and all creatures who walk or fly

94
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,728
and might want to have mastery over man.

95
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,188
And so it was that zadkiel snuck the shark

96
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,148
upon his father's vessel.

97
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,748
And when Noah found out
what zadkiel had done,

98
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,608
he struck his son in his drunkenness.

99
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,865
Zadkiel came too close to the shark,

100
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:54,579
and the demon betrayed
him as all devils do.

101
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:00,758
And thus did Noah gather his other sons

102
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,838
and push the shark overboard,

103
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,238
and then did Noah pledge shem,
japheth, and ham to silence,

104
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,008
as the ark was to have
been a place of Harmony

105
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,608
and the discord of the
brother and his shark

106
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,598
which made three instead of two

107
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,248
and then three instead of four

108
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,868
must not be spoken of again.

109
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,068
And thus by this did another curse fall

110
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,261
on the family of Noah,

111
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:24,578
that the flood lasted for
40 days instead of four

112
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,668
and the stories that were

113
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,659
hidden about those days were woeful.

114
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:39,240
I can't believe I'm reading this.

115
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:41,678
What, you got a tennis
shoe endorsement waiting?

116
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,888
What exactly is this?

117
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,338
It's a documentary I'm working on.

118
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,058
I'm gonna use it to raise
money to go look for the ark.

119
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,080
Who's going to watch this?

120
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:50,728
I don't know, old people
who want to give me money?

121
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,339
It's kind of my thing.

122
00:08:53,174 --> 00:08:54,005
It's legit, benna.

123
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:55,758
I know this witch of
endor thing sounds like

124
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,788
some sort of star wars thing.

125
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:01,088
Look, I know the
witch of endor was real.

126
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,658
Saul asked her to summon
the spirit of Samuel,

127
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,258
which she did.

128
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,498
Behold, there is a woman who hath

129
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,388
a familiar spirit at endor.

130
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,908
Okay, okay, so this old lady.

131
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,878
She had a grandpa or something.

132
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,018
He went searching for her,
found this ancient Tome,

133
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,568
contained all the writings,
the prophecies of this witch.

134
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,318
They kept it out of the
Bible back in the day.

135
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,878
I've never heard of this.

136
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,078
Well, if you weren't so
busy doing zipper exorcisms,

137
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,948
maybe you'd heard of it.

138
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,368
- I didn't...
- Yeah, yeah.

139
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,858
And I didn't skim off the
top of a mega church either.

140
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,958
I mean, how 1980s can you be?

141
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,618
It's not like I had a bunch of wives

142
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,238
with a bunch of machine guns or

143
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,328
started some ufo sex cult or

144
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,048
asked them all to drink
some cyanide kombucha.

145
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,648
I mean, I'm not even sure it's illegal

146
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,398
to skim off the top of the church anymore.

147
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,798
Look, about this book of the witch.

148
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,631
Yeah, so this book.

149
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:48,468
The old lady died and left it to me.

150
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,208
And in it, in the prophecies,

151
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,083
it contained where the ark landed.

152
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,988
And the fourth son of Noah
who got eaten by a shark?

153
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,190
That guy too.

154
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,788
So there's enough there, you
think you can find the ark.

155
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,278
Yeah, baby.

156
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,698
Why is that?

157
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,218
Well, another dude, an
explorer guy back in the day,

158
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,878
he read the book of the witch too,

159
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,803
followed all the clues and
brought back a piece of wood.

160
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,818
I got it out back.

161
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,038
A board from what?

162
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,243
From the ark.

163
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,931
Boards from the ark
were just lying around?

164
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:21,168
I don't know, maybe he
had a crowbar or something.

165
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,558
I wasn't there.

166
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,508
Mm-hmm.

167
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,068
Oh, ye of little faith.

168
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,378
And see, I do know how
to use ye in a sentence.

169
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,130
They say I'm not a man of religion.

170
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,908
So that's the board.

171
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,668
The old lady willed me all
the papers and everything,

172
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,048
plus a couple grand

173
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,728
which the government
took in the settlement,

174
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,958
which was a real screw 'cause I didn't

175
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,848
ask for that money, man.

176
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,598
She loved my TV show.

177
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,328
She was hoping I'd finish
what her grandpa started.

178
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,138
She gave me all the official
papers and everything,

179
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,404
plus a transcript of the
book of the witch of endor.

180
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:18,788
We've got everything we need
to rock this thing, man.

181
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,428
Looks like someone peeled
that off an amish barn.

182
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,758
Don't do me like that, father.

183
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,418
This lady was a true believer.

184
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,018
How come the old lady's family member

185
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,688
didn't bring back the rest?

186
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,638
Ah, I guess he came back
with one arm or something.

187
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,340
Makes it kinda hard to lug things.

188
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,620
Only one arm?

189
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,288
Well, mount ararat ain't
exactly a trip to Disneyland.

190
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,758
No.

191
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,003
I'm sure that's true.

192
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:44,573
Okay, so what do you think?

193
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:46,867
What do I think?

194
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:07,456
It sounds funny.

195
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:10,943
I don't know what this is.

196
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:17,183
But there's something.

197
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:32,738
There's something there.

198
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,768
Yeah, it's a little splintery.

199
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,423
Had it in the garage with
a bunch of other junk but

200
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:38,703
I think that's the right one.

201
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,543
Oh, it's the right one.

202
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,588
And the road to endor is the oldest road

203
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,298
and the craziest road of all.

204
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,358
Straight it runs to the witch's abode

205
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,113
as it did in the days of Saul.

206
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,688
And nothing has changed
of the sorrow in store,

207
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,253
for such as go down the road to endor.

208
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:04,613
Huh, yeah, what you just said.

209
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,183
The prophecy of the witch is real.

210
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,113
I know because this wood is possessed.

211
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,318
Tell me again.

212
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,708
What happened to the old
woman who left you this?

213
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,778
I don't know, I think her
house burned down or something.

214
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,348
Then how did the book of
the witch of endor survive?

215
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,038
How did that board make it?

216
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
I don't know.

217
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,378
The grandfather was gravely ill.

218
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,888
The granddaughter died in the fire.

219
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:39,888
And the father?

220
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,225
That one I know.

221
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:44,058
The old lady had me praying for his soul.

222
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,208
I would do that for four
easy installments of 29.95.

223
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,118
Well, he went crazy.

224
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,068
Killed himself when she
was young or something.

225
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,538
She thought he was burning
in hell this whole time.

226
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,438
Prepare for the sons
a place of slaughter

227
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,918
because of the iniquity of their fathers.

228
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,635
You got one for every
occasion, don't you?

229
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:03,438
Right off the top of your head too.

230
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,940
That's good, that's real good.

231
00:14:05,947 --> 00:14:08,903
So possessed wood, huh?

232
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,636
You had any luck with possessed wood,

233
00:14:11,638 --> 00:14:13,398
you wouldn't have gotten
in all that trouble.

234
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:15,748
What? Come on.

235
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,708
It was just right there.

236
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,428
Don't you ever shut up?

237
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,988
Now you know the difference
between you and me.

238
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,808
You were paid to be religious.

239
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,368
I was paid to talk.

240
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,370
Nevermind that.

241
00:14:27,377 --> 00:14:30,213
I saw the evil is soaked into that board.

242
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:31,808
The blood.

243
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,788
If you really want to know
the secret of the ark,

244
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,308
the lost fourth son of
Noah and of the demon,

245
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,493
I have to go to work.

246
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:41,424
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

247
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:43,186
Exactly what demon are
we talking about here?

248
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,320
Be sober and be vigilant

249
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,498
because your adversary, the devil,

250
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,568
as a roaring lion walketh about,

251
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,978
seeking whom he may devour.

252
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,483
Or maybe swimmeth about?

253
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,413
Pretorius, please!

254
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,778
Okay, okay.

255
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,188
Almighty god, source
of irresistible might

256
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,378
and king of an invincible
realm that I cannot perceive,

257
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,628
the ever glorious conqueror of evil,

258
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,158
he who restrains the
force of the adversary,

259
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,298
silencing the uproar of his rage

260
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,514
and valiantly subduing his wickedness.

261
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,978
It is in awe and humility
that I beg you, lord,

262
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,580
to regard with favor this thing.

263
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,038
Take hold of the dragon.

264
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,888
Behold serpent, no matter which storm,

265
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,335
which is the devil and Satan

266
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:03,558
and all the demons of the
underworld, large and small,

267
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,790
and bind them.

268
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,092
Hey, what's going on, man?

269
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:09,444
Hey man, is this even safe?

270
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:13,295
I didn't know this was real, is this real?

271
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:14,591
Benna!

272
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:15,991
Bind them.

273
00:16:15,993 --> 00:16:18,668
Cast him into the bottomless pit

274
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,773
so he may no longer seduce the nations.

275
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,498
As smoke is driven away,
so are they driven.

276
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,468
As wax melts before the flame,

277
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,637
so the wicked perish
at the presence of god.

278
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:39,657
Benna?

279
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,450
Oh, dude!

280
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,490
What about all creatures great and small?

281
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,953
Then Jesus asked him, what is your name?

282
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:07,060
And the man answered, my name
is legion, for we are many.

283
00:17:09,953 --> 00:17:11,418
In the book of Mark,

284
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,228
Jesus drove an impure
spirit from a possessed man

285
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,478
and into a herd of pigs

286
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,203
which ran into a lake and drowned.

287
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,438
It wasn't going to leave that wood

288
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,493
until it found a willing receptacle.

289
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,151
Where is the book of the witch of endor?

290
00:17:27,153 --> 00:17:29,773
It's back at my place
with the grandpa's journal.

291
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,721
You shouldn't leave
that just lying around.

292
00:17:32,723 --> 00:17:35,503
Yeah, I kinda see that now.

293
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,400
I need to read that
journal before we go.

294
00:17:40,455 --> 00:17:41,455
Go?

295
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,490
Go find the ark.

296
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:46,123
We didn't even raise any money yet.

297
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,213
We can't wait just for money.

298
00:17:52,535 --> 00:17:54,448
What, wait, wait, you have money?

299
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,110
Why didn't you tell me you had money?

300
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,118
My search for Noah's
ark enters a new phase

301
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,198
since I found the book
of the witch of endor.

302
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,718
To scale mount nebo was a trial,

303
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,593
but something kept pushing me on.

304
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:05,734
Something.

305
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,688
And now it is that I feel
I know the witch of endor.

306
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,148
Now that I have read
all of her prophecies,

307
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,548
which would get me
banished from the church

308
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,143
were it known I had read them.

309
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,600
And since I read them, she seems...

310
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:28,592
A part of me.

311
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:30,976
Somewhere.

312
00:19:32,072 --> 00:19:33,072
Always near.

313
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,648
And thus as my adventure's taken me from

314
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,438
one hellish peak to the next and

315
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,608
I set foot on mount ararat now

316
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,360
to seek the most sacred of things.

317
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:44,084
Oh, my siren.

318
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
My muse.

319
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:09,543
The witch was, in her way, an angel.

320
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,713
Carrying me to my destination.

321
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,558
For what purpose, a mere
mortal cannot fathom,

322
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,098
except perhaps that I would carry

323
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,538
the good word of truth
forward to my fellow man.

324
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,328
But I have learned that a
good word is not enough.

325
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,453
That evidence must be shown
to a doubting man's eyes.

326
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,157
I knew that the road ahead
would be fraught with peril

327
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,242
and that I would have to be on guard.

328
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,093
But I did not know
danger would be so close.

329
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:38,432
That death would be so close.

330
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:35,753
That death would be so close.

331
00:25:01,853 --> 00:25:04,383
That god would ask so much.

332
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,718
It is as it has been said.

333
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,163
God giveth, god taketh away.

334
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,268
I have found the ark

335
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:18,153
but also a powerful evil waiting for me.

336
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,233
I must survive so that the
world knows about the ark.

337
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,123
But I am in a weakened state
from which I may never recover.

338
00:25:28,305 --> 00:25:30,448
So it shall be upon those after me

339
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,259
to bring the ark finally into the light

340
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:35,073
and banish the darkness.

341
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:38,459
For we must know light from darkness.

342
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
Come in.

343
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,438
Allen? Really?

344
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,318
Hey, people gotta work, father.

345
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,868
Al, baby, over here.

346
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,358
Show's about me, not this guy.

347
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,428
Now you have a show?

348
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,768
Oh, it's more like a three episode arc

349
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,268
on this whole reality show thing.

350
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,018
It's called road to redemption.

351
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,068
No, river of redemption.

352
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,168
Rock it to redemption.

353
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,438
I don't know, something with
redemption in the title.

354
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,108
Me, I get three episodes
on this reality show.

355
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,428
That guy from the '80s hair
metal band had one hit.

356
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,698
He gets five.

357
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,728
For doing drugs? Like that's anything.

358
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,663
Try skimming money, that takes brains.

359
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,328
Nevermind that.

360
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,568
Why is he here?

361
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,978
Oh, he's going with us to Israel.

362
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,818
Why are we going to Israel?

363
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,188
Mount ararat,
the whole Noah's ark thing?

364
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,698
Mount ararat is not in Israel.

365
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,838
It's between Turkey, Iran,
Armenia, and Azerbaijan.

366
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,928
Wait, Turkey?

367
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:56,408
Yes, it's under
Turkish military control.

368
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,733
So they shoot onsite.

369
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,603
We need to find a less guarded route.

370
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,548
Our best bet might be Iran.

371
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:06,328
It's the closest side to
where the notes take us.

372
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,663
Wait, wait, Iran?

373
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,493
There's no easy way.

374
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,073
And it is as it has been said.

375
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,708
We have to know the
darkness from the light.

376
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,138
But Iran, dude.

377
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,568
Remind me, they don't
like us there, right?

378
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,098
You better think about packing.

379
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,378
Wait, they don't
like us anywhere, do they?

380
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,380
Go home and pack.

381
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,428
Located at 3830 McMahon road

382
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,308
on a desolate hilltop near the village

383
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,068
of hinsdale, New York,

384
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,948
the dandy house is over 100 years old

385
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,373
and inhabited by age old spirits.

386
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,778
Built near an Indian burial ground

387
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,348
just 200 feet from the home,

388
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,808
blood has been seen gushing
from the earth there.

389
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:42,810
This cemetery reputedly
incurs 1,100 senecas

390
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,610
who were killed by their own
tribe for committing evil.

391
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,342
Often, the dandys heard a course

392
00:28:49,344 --> 00:28:52,178
of disembodied voices
echoing from the nearby woods

393
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,278
as if performing a cleansing ritual.

394
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,018
Equally disturbing, the
family watched smoky air

395
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,878
in the kitchen transform
into a huge gray wolf.

396
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,678
The beast leaped straight
through a wooden door.

397
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,073
The iroquois word for
bleed was plainly heard.

398
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,118
Then, shadow people were
seen leering in the window.

399
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,228
After the dandys went
outside to investigate,

400
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:22,518
the same faces were looking out
at them from the living room

401
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,378
as lights flashed on and off.

402
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,578
Other ghosts were present as well.

403
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,558
A young dark-haired lady was
seen walking by the pond.

404
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,128
Could she have been the woman
hung from a tree out front?

405
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,588
Then, apparitions in long
gowns began appearing

406
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,178
with startling frequency,

407
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,718
both in and out of the house.

408
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,508
They well could have been the victims

409
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,548
of a deranged innkeeper
who murdered travelers

410
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:51,097
while the dwelling served as a
way station for stagecoaches.

411
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,618
From the time Phil dandy, his wife, Clara,

412
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,698
and their three children
moved into the house

413
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,128
in July of 1973,

414
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,938
they were beset by dark forces.

415
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,898
Lights turned on and off by themselves.

416
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,758
The kitchen stove went
haywire while cooking dinner.

417
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,158
Rooms got icy cold in August,

418
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,078
and pounding and dragging
noises echoed from the attic.

419
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,488
One day, they heard the
slamming of a window

420
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,218
and smashing glass.

421
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,498
When they scrambled to look in the bedroom

422
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,328
from which the noise issued,

423
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,188
all the windows were in place.

424
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,028
Then, the haunting grew violent.

425
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,398
After a lamp flew across the
room at one of the daughters,

426
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,278
the death card, the ace of spaces,

427
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,008
was found on the floor in her room.

428
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:41,038
A few days later, two
of the children awoke

429
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,858
with burn marks covering their bodies.

430
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,578
This prompted the family to enlist.

431
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,168
Father alphonsus trabold
of St. bonaventure

432
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:52,363
to perform an exorcism
on April 13th, 1975.

433
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,658
As he conducted his ceremony,

434
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,578
moans and wails echoed through the house

435
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,803
until all grew deathly still.

436
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,478
Three months later though...

437
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,573
- I'm finished.
- The evil forces

438
00:31:05,575 --> 00:31:06,916
renewed their attacks.

439
00:31:06,918 --> 00:31:08,574
- What could be worse?
- The dandys were eventually

440
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,233
forced to move.

441
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,098
Dude, I'll get you the money.

442
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,698
You said you
were raising the money.

443
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,698
Same difference.

444
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,668
Not to me it ain't.

445
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,838
Raising money is money
that you don't have.

446
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,508
Listen man, I gotta go
outta town for a few days.

447
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,658
I'll have the money when I get back.

448
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,818
I don't like the
sounds of that, buster.

449
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,848
Listen, I know people say this,

450
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,908
but this time, I got it.

451
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,741
I'm gonna come back.

452
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:46,058
I'm gonna be making bank, dude.

453
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,160
You better be.

454
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:16,478
When I saw your
name on the dating app,

455
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,208
I thought it sounded familiar.

456
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,858
Yeah, yeah, I was in the
entertainment industry.

457
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,698
Right now, I'm a producer, so.

458
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,608
Wow.

459
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,658
Yeah, so doing a whole
history thing right now.

460
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,778
That's crazy
'cause I'm an actress.

461
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,528
I know, I saw it on your profile.

462
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:36,078
So how would you like to play Noah's wife?

463
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,468
Noah's wife?

464
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,568
Yeah, I mean, he had
100 wives or whatever,

465
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,948
but after the first few,

466
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,208
you know he's only picking hotties.

467
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,811
I guess.

468
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:46,617
Yeah, so.

469
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:47,788
Hold on, sounds like
a bunch of fire trucks

470
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,257
are going by or something.

471
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,288
What?

472
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,418
Never mind, how would you like to do

473
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,673
a cold reading at my studio?

474
00:32:53,675 --> 00:32:54,791
A what?

475
00:32:54,793 --> 00:32:57,248
A cold reading.

476
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,838
In my studio.

477
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,318
Are you there?

478
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,573
My studio!

479
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,023
Buster, are you there?

480
00:33:22,037 --> 00:33:24,195
Better luck next time, priest.

481
00:33:24,197 --> 00:33:25,497
- Better luck next time.
- For we must know

482
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:30,499
- light from darkness.
- Better luck next time.

483
00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:52,138
For we must
know light from darkness.

484
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,298
Better luck next time, priest.

485
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,793
For we must
know light from darkness.

486
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:47,049
I am a visitation.

487
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:49,508
What do you want?

488
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,098
Stay away from buster pretorius.

489
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,948
We know of him and his foolish quest.

490
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,438
You might be too late for that.

491
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,868
Who is we?

492
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,933
You may call us z.

493
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,763
And we protect the cursed
ark from ever being found.

494
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,143
The cursed ark?

495
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,980
But most believe the ark to be sacred.

496
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,498
Why do you call the ark cursed?

497
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,618
Noah begat a cursed son

498
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,328
whose name is lost to history,

499
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,430
but we know as zadkiel.

500
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,888
I know of him.

501
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,198
He was the fourth son

502
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,328
after shem, ham, and japheth.

503
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,408
Zadkiel was also a drunk
like his father, Noah,

504
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:32,338
and was led into sin many times.

505
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,218
Before the flood, zadkiel
laid with a harlot

506
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,668
and she became with child,

507
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,358
but zadkiel was ashamed
and left her on land

508
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,423
when the flood came.

509
00:35:42,427 --> 00:35:45,898
But the fallen angel
abraxis came on black wings

510
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,998
and lifted the harlot to a mountaintop

511
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,408
where she labored for
40 days and 40 nights.

512
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:55,248
And on the day the waters
receded, a child was born,

513
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,973
and thus was born the
only child of zadkiel,

514
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,448
as he died on the ark and was thrown over

515
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,148
by his three brothers and his father.

516
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,348
And thus as well was born the first

517
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,668
of the lost tribe of zadkiel.

518
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,968
And we call ourselves z.

519
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,508
Pledged through the many ages

520
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,998
to keep our father's
grave hidden from sight.

521
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,248
But if the world were to see
the evidence of god's plan,

522
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,600
we might change everything.

523
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:23,128
But the true story of the ark

524
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,542
shows the plan of the devil,

525
00:36:25,544 --> 00:36:28,298
and that knowledge would be far worse.

526
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,478
Knowledge of the devil is
well known in this world.

527
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,743
And so I cannot accept
that interpretation.

528
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,803
Then you will die.

529
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,018
Who's this dude,
ghost of Christmas past?

530
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,291
What are you doing here?

531
00:36:46,293 --> 00:36:48,798
That dude torched the studio.

532
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,631
What?

533
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:52,130
Yeah, I saw him sneaking
away, followed him here.

534
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,240
Dude, did you cook bacon in this?

535
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,643
Oh, I could smash some bacon right now.

536
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,968
What about the book of the
witch of endor and the journal?

537
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,208
No worries, I don't leave
that stuff lying around anymore.

538
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,188
I carry it with me.

539
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,728
Plus the studio, I got insurance
and an alibi this time.

540
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,263
Let's see who this guy is.

541
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,073
Oh, that's not good.

542
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,603
Ew, is this his face?

543
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,623
The more important question is,

544
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,470
is he dead?

545
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,230
Just grab his feet.

546
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,830
Let's ghost.

547
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,920
Still don't know what you're doing.

548
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,873
That guy burned down my
studio and tried to kill you.

549
00:38:23,746 --> 00:38:24,788
You don't know that.

550
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,428
Yeah.

551
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,080
This fell out of his robe
while we were dragging him.

552
00:38:29,964 --> 00:38:31,753
Well, yes.

553
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,770
That doesn't look good.

554
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,638
Thou shalt not kill.

555
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
Happy now?

556
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,130
Let's get outta here.

557
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,530
Look out!

558
00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:10,080
We warned
you about the cursed place.

559
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:12,473
Oh, I just had this car detailed.

560
00:39:14,926 --> 00:39:15,757
Now you are cursed.

561
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:17,143
No, screw this.

562
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,998
He said he was part of
the lost tribe of zadkiel.

563
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,608
Noah's son who died after bringing

564
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,278
the third shark on the ark.

565
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,648
Wonder why there's so many
lost books of the Bible.

566
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,428
Imagine if those were
lost Harry Potter books.

567
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,688
People would be freaking out.

568
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,928
Because church elders...

569
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,057
Okay, I really don't care.

570
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:50,018
I don't need a history lesson.

571
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,970
If I did, I'd still be going
to kirk Cameron Bible college.

572
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,258
Oh my god, it tastes like
there's coffee in this.

573
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,026
There's only coffee in this.

574
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:04,908
That's what I get for hanging out

575
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,360
with you old testament dudes.

576
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,423
He kept saying we.

577
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,988
Maybe he meant the royal we.

578
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,313
Those culty types love to talk like that.

579
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,160
But what if there's more of them?

580
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,758
You saying we might need protection?

581
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,060
We might need something.

582
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:26,903
In that case, I know
a guy who knows a guy.

583
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,965
All our answers are right
here at this shooting range.

584
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:40,384
Shooting range?

585
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,453
We're on a mission from god.

586
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,788
Yo, jed, how's it hanging?

587
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,978
Back from that big sandbox, I see.

588
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,578
What do you want, pretorius?

589
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,268
Hey listen, I know that
security gig didn't go

590
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,558
the way you wanted.

591
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,148
War crimes are a bitch.

592
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,100
Even Terry Taliban has a cell
phone these days, am I right?

593
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:10,738
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

594
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,588
Didn't your daddy teach you

595
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,388
not to point those things at people?

596
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,453
No, my mama did.

597
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:18,248
Father benna, this is
an old friend of mine,

598
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,793
Gina jedlicher, but
everyone calls her jed.

599
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,908
Old friends? Is that what we are?

600
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,583
I mean, we're not gonna
dwell on all that, are we?

601
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,982
Again, what do you want?

602
00:41:29,984 --> 00:41:32,368
Me and my friends here,
we might have a little,

603
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,420
a little gig for you.

604
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,918
Keep talking.

605
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,028
Security gig.

606
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:40,198
For you? Easy peasy.

607
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,388
I don't do video.

608
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, understandable.

609
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,403
But also nonnegotiable.

610
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,273
It'll be easy, like a trip
to the ice cream store.

611
00:42:02,332 --> 00:42:03,415
Go, go, go!

612
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:05,851
Don't stop running!

613
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:25,298
Jed, we don't need to
be killing any soldiers.

614
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,426
They already chased us pretty
far towards the mountain.

615
00:42:28,428 --> 00:42:29,308
I'm shooting at a snake.

616
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,928
Snakes?

617
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:31,930
Snakes.

618
00:42:47,687 --> 00:42:49,898
Oh hey, you're not
gonna eat that, are you?

619
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,378
What'd you think we
were gonna eat tonight?

620
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,778
The beef jerky I brought, for one thing.

621
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,128
Yeah, you dropped that with
a whole bunch of other crap

622
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,081
when you were running
like your ass was on fire.

623
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:01,468
I did that on purpose.

624
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,920
I was trying to distract
them, I saved your life.

625
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,645
No, no, no, no, hey, you're
not gonna touch that, are you?

626
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:11,647
Hey.

627
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:24,477
Nah, I'm good.

628
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,600
Do you see something moving?

629
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:39,363
No, not moving.

630
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,750
I'll just watch the fire.

631
00:43:54,908 --> 00:43:56,633
Don't want it to go out.

632
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,660
Guys?

633
00:44:04,668 --> 00:44:05,668
Guys?

634
00:44:27,496 --> 00:44:30,618
Thought I saw it gleaming.

635
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,773
I've seen plenty of them, so
I know what they look like.

636
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:37,398
We aren't the first to
go looking for the ark.

637
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,600
We'll be some of the
only to ever come back.

638
00:44:40,926 --> 00:44:42,868
Is that so?

639
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,538
If god wills.

640
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,653
If god wills.

641
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:50,718
I saw myself dying in plenty of hell holes

642
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,858
over the last years for many reasons,

643
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,963
but I never saw myself
dying in service of god.

644
00:44:58,990 --> 00:44:59,990
Then don't.

645
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,103
Make it sound so easy.

646
00:45:03,376 --> 00:45:05,126
I wish I saw things the way you do.

647
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,575
I doubt it.

648
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,488
Yo, let's take a break.

649
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:03,468
Good idea.

650
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:06,409
In fact, it might be a
good idea if we take a nap.

651
00:46:06,411 --> 00:46:07,788
A nap?

652
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,448
Yeah, if we power down now,

653
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,068
we can walk more through the night.

654
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,268
We don't have to worry about
coming across any patrols.

655
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,208
If they patrolled up here,

656
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,238
they would've found the ark already.

657
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,438
They didn't have the journal.

658
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,118
Does that journal have coordinates?

659
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,198
More like directions.

660
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,893
So it's a pre-GPS kinda thing.

661
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:30,078
Yes, that's correct.

662
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,280
I'll take first watch.

663
00:46:45,353 --> 00:46:47,520
- What the?
- Come with me.

664
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,743
Where are we going?

665
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,548
Wait, where are we going?

666
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,888
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

667
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,388
What, don't you want to do this?

668
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:06,418
Of course I want to
do this but it's just,

669
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,995
last time you wanted to do this,

670
00:47:07,997 --> 00:47:10,297
you thought you were
gonna die in Afghanistan.

671
00:47:11,514 --> 00:47:13,088
I almost did.

672
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,748
Is it true?

673
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,550
Think you're gonna die out here now?

674
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,778
I mean, you know what they say.

675
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,348
I'll try anything once but...

676
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:25,388
You idiot!

677
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,438
I didn't make that, I found it.

678
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,388
Okay, okay, cool.

679
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,337
We're gonna need a safe word though.

680
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,653
What? So this is a no go now?

681
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,980
Jed.

682
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,038
I thought we were going to
try to walk through the night.

683
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,123
Change in plans.

684
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,748
Told you we'd show you
the sharp end of the stick.

685
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:09,758
You know, back in nam,

686
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,918
the cong used to pee on
the ends of those sticks

687
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,870
to cause infection to the
soldiers who got stuck with them.

688
00:48:16,136 --> 00:48:17,858
Who told you that, your
grandma in the green berets?

689
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,198
Will you go make yourself useful

690
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,763
and get us some more sticks?

691
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,823
Not the pointy ones.

692
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,548
Should you have given him a gun?

693
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:30,771
Do you want to carry
him down the mountain

694
00:48:30,773 --> 00:48:32,553
when he shoots himself in the foot?

695
00:48:58,339 --> 00:49:00,088
Picking up sticks.

696
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:02,778
You brought these people
into this project.

697
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,130
We're all gonna make money.

698
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,183
I'm picking up sticks.

699
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,400
What the?

700
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,618
Dude, the last one I couldn't
pry from a guy's face.

701
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:44,188
This one I find hanging just on a peg.

702
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,388
What is this?

703
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:49,428
A mask for a cult
based on a son of Noah.

704
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:50,698
One of the cultists came to visit

705
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,050
before we left on the trip.

706
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:54,638
This would've been good intel to have

707
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,878
before we had left.

708
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,788
Ah, I hit him on the
head with a frying pan.

709
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:58,790
They ain't nothing.

710
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,270
I'll be the judge of that.

711
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,660
A warning?

712
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,368
To us?

713
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:07,370
Or to them?

714
00:51:16,442 --> 00:51:20,184
You know, the mask could've
been put there 50 years ago.

715
00:51:20,186 --> 00:51:21,186
Yep.

716
00:51:24,506 --> 00:51:26,558
Relax, nobody knew
which way we were walking,

717
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,773
least of all benna.

718
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:31,348
Shut up and eat your pika.

719
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:32,708
What is this pika anyway?

720
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:33,860
It tastes like chicken.

721
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:38,038
Pika's an animal, it's not an entree.

722
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,290
It's kinda like a rabbit.

723
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,330
It's kinda like a rat.

724
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,478
What?

725
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,633
Did you see us pass a drive-thru?

726
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,198
We should try and get some sleep.

727
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,500
It looks like we might
reach the ark tomorrow.

728
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:00,993
Move over, Allen, let
me share this with you.

729
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:23,563
Hey, I'm gonna go get
some b-roll footage.

730
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:01,350
Dude, really?

731
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:06,530
We're really
going to find the ark today?

732
00:53:06,532 --> 00:53:08,208
That's what the big priest man says.

733
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,808
Well, it's gotta
be better than what we got.

734
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,348
What do you mean?

735
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:14,548
I'm filming this
so we both have a record

736
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:15,958
of what I'm telling you.

737
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,808
We've been out here for days.

738
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:20,108
You gotta do better than a
pointy stick in the ground

739
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,828
and a mask you hung on a tree.

740
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:23,548
Dude, I did not do that.

741
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:24,668
Uh-huh.

742
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:28,348
I thought you wanted more than
a three episode story arc.

743
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,498
Dude, this is real, I swear to god.

744
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,778
Well, there's real

745
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,178
and then there's reality television.

746
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,213
Do you get me?

747
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,528
Yep.

748
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:41,018
We paid you, buster.

749
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,318
Yeah.

750
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,343
Okay then.

751
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:06,716
Getting kinda late, benna.

752
00:55:06,718 --> 00:55:07,578
Yeah, I don't even know

753
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,658
if we're going uphill anymore, dude.

754
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,003
My feet hurt all the time.

755
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,248
Laban said to Jacob,

756
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:21,153
behold this heap and behold the pillars,

757
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,183
which I have set betwixt you and me.

758
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:29,860
This heap is a witness and
the pillar is a witness

759
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,873
that I will not pass by
this heap to you for harm.

760
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:38,038
And you will not pass by
this heap or this pillar

761
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,143
to me for harm.

762
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,480
The man said what he said, baby.

763
00:55:49,981 --> 00:55:52,378
Benna, your explorer guy, Blake,

764
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,048
he was starving, man.

765
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,238
He was tired, he lost his arm.

766
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,605
He could've bled out on the way back.

767
00:55:58,607 --> 00:56:01,340
That stuff he wrote,
he was out of it, man.

768
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:16,624
Dude, that could just be an old board.

769
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,643
They don't fall off the tree planed.

770
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:24,850
The energy.

771
00:56:26,644 --> 00:56:27,844
There's a presence here.

772
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,708
Yeah, that's a nice board.

773
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:06,828
Get a couple of cinder blocks,

774
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,123
you could set your stereo up on it.

775
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,300
Don't you feel it?

776
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,920
Did you see that?

777
00:57:32,043 --> 00:57:34,468
I see you losing it, bro.

778
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:36,160
There's a long walk outta here.

779
00:57:47,443 --> 00:57:50,943
The end of all flesh has come before me.

780
00:57:55,006 --> 00:57:56,923
Are you getting this?

781
00:58:02,963 --> 00:58:04,130
Benna, what...

782
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:50,297
Hello, old girl.

783
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:26,896
We warned you.

784
01:01:26,898 --> 01:01:31,018
We are not your enemy,
we are the protectors.

785
01:01:36,279 --> 01:01:39,433
He is trapped here.

786
01:01:39,435 --> 01:01:42,234
His soul pinned to the floor of the ark.

787
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:45,498
Now your soul is trapped here too.

788
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:54,698
Let me get him some water.

789
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,383
Take it easy there, buddy.

790
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,618
Listen, I ain't gonna
stroke your forehead,

791
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:00,783
but I am here for you.

792
01:02:01,881 --> 01:02:03,338
No, not water.

793
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:04,873
What are you saying?

794
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,080
What?

795
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:18,898
Hang in there, father benna.

796
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,748
They went to get you
some water by the lake.

797
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:21,850
It's gonna be okay.

798
01:02:34,043 --> 01:02:35,333
Hey, hey, it's me.

799
01:02:36,663 --> 01:02:37,698
I didn't know it was you.

800
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,748
If I had, I would've shot.

801
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:42,118
Don't say I didn't try to
make the world a better place.

802
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:42,951
I just wanted you to know,

803
01:02:42,953 --> 01:02:44,408
benna looks a little better now.

804
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:46,013
He's calmed down a bit.

805
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,538
So this lake, this
pond, this little pond.

806
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:57,838
Looks like it could
only hold Noah's pontoon

807
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,781
and that's about it.

808
01:02:59,783 --> 01:03:02,960
Normally I'd find
blasphemy extremely hot but

809
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,030
right now, this all seems kinda sacred.

810
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:07,721
I mean, back in the day,

811
01:03:07,723 --> 01:03:10,048
this must've all been covered in water

812
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:12,513
and that's how the ark floated up here.

813
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,223
Is that what you think happened?

814
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:19,018
I mean, Blake's journal was right.

815
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,713
The book of the witch was right.

816
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,913
For the first time in a long time,

817
01:03:28,402 --> 01:03:30,558
I see the spirit all around us.

818
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,113
I see what benna sees.

819
01:03:35,657 --> 01:03:38,580
I see the beauty in the
unseen and the unknown.

820
01:03:39,543 --> 01:03:40,693
I feel it inside of me.

821
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,658
Jed, I want you to know...

822
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,660
Don't say it.

823
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:49,166
I want you to know I...

824
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:57,619
Oh my god!

825
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,168
There's blood in the water.

826
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:09,200
It might not all be,
it might not all be...

827
01:04:11,141 --> 01:04:12,600
Thanks.

828
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:16,838
It's the first time I can
say a priest saved me.

829
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,696
That's what we're here for.

830
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:32,270
Father!

831
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,978
Dead, all dead.

832
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,288
There's no way that shark

833
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,818
could've taken all those bullets.

834
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:39,651
Maybe they're...

835
01:04:39,653 --> 01:04:40,653
No, no.

836
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:46,318
Well, we can get a piece
of the wood from the ark.

837
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,388
Take it down the mountain.

838
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:50,156
Prove to people that we
were here, we found it.

839
01:04:50,158 --> 01:04:51,458
No.

840
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:52,813
You've got the footage.

841
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:58,408
Find the highway, the e-99.

842
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:00,168
Turn yourself over to the first

843
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:02,343
military squad you come across.

844
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,997
- It's the only way.
- I'm not leaving you!

845
01:05:05,999 --> 01:05:07,379
Go!

846
01:05:07,381 --> 01:05:08,381
Go.

847
01:05:09,516 --> 01:05:10,516
Go.

848
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,973
Be sober and be vigilant

849
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:45,418
because your adversary, the devil,

850
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:48,063
as a roaring lion, walketh about.

851
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:52,168
Seeking whom he may devour.

852
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:55,470
Almighty god, source of irresistible might

853
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:00,528
and king of an invincible
realm that I cannot perceive,

854
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:03,808
the ever glorious conqueror of evil,

855
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:07,308
he who restrains the
force of the adversary,

856
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:10,468
silencing the uproar of his rage

857
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:13,660
and valiantly subduing his wickedness.

858
01:06:20,622 --> 01:06:23,820
It is in awe and humility
that I beg you, lord,

859
01:06:23,822 --> 01:06:26,190
to regard with favor this thing.

860
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:29,725
Take hold of the dragon.

861
01:06:29,727 --> 01:06:32,043
Behold serpent, no matter which storm,

862
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,505
which is the devil and Satan

863
01:06:35,507 --> 01:06:39,728
and all the demons of the
underworld, large and small,

864
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:41,110
and bind them.

865
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:44,152
Hey, what's going on, man?

866
01:06:44,154 --> 01:06:45,504
Hey man, is this even safe?

867
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:49,217
I didn't know this was real, is this real?

868
01:06:49,219 --> 01:06:50,456
Benna!

869
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:51,458
Bind them.

870
01:06:52,622 --> 01:06:54,838
Cast him into the bottomless pit

871
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,963
so he may no longer seduce the nations.

872
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:02,658
As smoke is driven away,
so are they driven.

873
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:05,728
As wax melts before the flame,

874
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:08,293
so the wicked perish
at the presence of god.

875
01:07:14,837 --> 01:07:16,857
Benna?

876
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:27,272
You're not really the
witch of endor, are you?

877
01:07:27,274 --> 01:07:28,567
We are legion.

878
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,753
I am legion.

879
01:07:32,222 --> 01:07:33,555
We are legion.

880
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:38,237
That's what I thought.

881
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:41,118
The mirror is cracked.

882
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,898
There are many facets.

883
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,613
Without a sun, there could be no shadow.

884
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,768
You cannot know the cold of the night

885
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:51,073
without first feeling the heat of the day.

886
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,698
I would've thrown myself into the void

887
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,368
to have defeated you.

888
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:58,248
The willingness to sacrifice

889
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:02,498
therein lies the difference
between you and me.

890
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,113
And yet, you must live.

891
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:22,080
I don't want to be in
a found footage movie.

892
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,820
I don't want to be in
a found footage movie.

893
01:08:32,163 --> 01:08:33,553
What's that?

894
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:37,710
Oh man.

895
01:08:42,526 --> 01:08:44,609
What did you do that for?

896
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,513
The coin has two sides.

897
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:49,983
It needs us.

898
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:52,463
For more people to come here.

899
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:54,793
For it to survive.

900
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:58,808
Maybe in a way, we need it too.

901
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:01,160
But that's going to be
someone else's decision.

902
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:04,298
No one should know how we found the ark.

903
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,828
There's too much at stake to know.

904
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:08,988
We're leaving the camera here.

905
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:10,798
And I'm going to destroy all that remains

906
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,488
when we get back.

907
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,893
If we get back.

908
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:15,830
We will.

909
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:18,336
But we have to start now.
