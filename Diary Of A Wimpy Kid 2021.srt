3
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,288
First of all,
let me get something straight.

4
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,415
This is a journal, not a diary.

5
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,544
When Mom went out to buy this thing,

6
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,922
I specifically told her not to get a book
that said "Diary" on it.

7
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,549
But, of course, she didn't listen.

8
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,012
It's been hard enough getting through
the first week of middle school

9
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,306
without carrying this thing
around with me.

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,768
Hey, this kid's got a diary.

11
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,396
A-Actually, it's a jour--

12
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,738
If Mom's expecting me to write down
my feelings or whatever,

13
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,490
she's gonna be disappointed.

14
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,744
The only reason I agreed
to write in this thing at all

15
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,038
is because one day
I'm gonna be rich and famous.

16
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,083
And people'll wanna read about my
early years. So I'm doing this for them.

17
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,959
-Greg is so smart.
-So handsome.

18
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,712
-So brave.
-And he smells terrific.

19
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,299
But for now, I'm stuck in middle school…

20
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,677
…surrounded by morons.

21
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,015
But luckily, I'm not alone
in this middle school thing.

22
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,102
My best friend, Rowley,
is in the same grade as me.

23
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,813
I doubt he's ever gonna be
rich and famous,

24
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,815
but it's good to have him around
for laughs.

25
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,943
Did you know
if your hand is bigger than your face,

26
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,945
it's a sign that your brain is shrinking?

27
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,029
It is?

28
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,990
Gotcha.

29
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,244
But does this mean my brain is shrinking?

30
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,371
Not sure.

31
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,872
Let's check the other hand.

32
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,792
I'm glad Rowley's along for the ride,

33
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,128
because everything else
about middle school stinks.

34
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,380
And I can't believe it was just a week ago

35
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,716
that me and Rowley were actually
looking forward to this.

36
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,300
Heads up!

37
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:25,228
That was a good one.
You almost hit the front tire that time.

38
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,732
You just need to slow down a little
so I can get locked in.

39
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,235
-Let me get this straight.
-Come on, Rowley.

40
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,154
So in middle school,

41
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,489
do you just go to a different room
for each class?

42
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,782
Come on. You got it.

43
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,535
And you just carry all your stuff
around with you all day?

44
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,495
No, no. No, no, no.

45
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,872
They give you a locker

46
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,250
so you can just ditch the books you
don't need in between periods.

47
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,877
W-w-what about recess?

48
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,172
There's still recess, right?

49
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,549
I told you, like, a million times, Rowley.

50
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,718
Recess is an elementary school thing.

51
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,471
Aw. But I like recess.

52
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,599
Are you gonna go,
or are you just gonna sit there?

53
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,560
Don't you want a turn riding?
I've gone three times in a row.

54
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,815
But you're way better at riding than me.
I can never do it as good as you.

55
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,362
Woo-hoo!

56
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,658
-

57
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,709
Oh, come on, Rodrick! You made me miss!

58
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,252
I'm okay.

59
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,845
One of the reasons
I'm friends with Rowley is

60
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,640
there aren't a whole lot of boys my age
in the neighborhood.

61
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,685
In fact, aside from Rowley,
there's only really--

62
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,228
Fregley!

63
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,563
Why, hello, Greg Heffley.

64
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,943
Hi, Fregley. I was just, um,
getting-- getting my football.

65
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,570
Wanna come inside my house for a playdate?

66
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,615
I can show you my room.

67
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,327
You know, I'll definitely take you up
on that offer sometime.

68
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,913
Wanna see my…

69
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,874
secret freckle?

70
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,130
-

71
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,928
Should we do that one over?

72
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,349
Who's hungry?

73
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,030
So, did everyone have a good day?

74
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,824
Frank, don't do that with your food.
It's weird.

75
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,452
-It tastes better this way.
-

76
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,038
Hey! Oh!

77
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,497
I'm still gonna eat it.

78
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,293
Greg, is that dirt
on your back-to-school clothes?

79
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,961
Please don't call them that.

80
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,339
What on earth were you doing
to get so filthy?

81
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,591
I was throwing a football in the street
with Rowley.

82
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:06,139
You were playing a sport with
your feet and hands and not a device.

83
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,265
Wo-- Wow.

84
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,017
I guess.

85
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,103
Mark the calendar, Susan.
Greg here played a sport.

86
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,231
You weren't playing that game
with Rowley, were you?

87
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,359
You know you're banned from playing that.

88
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,652
Somebody is going to get hurt.

89
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,737
What?

90
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,364
Oh! Oh, that game?

91
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,782
No. No way.

92
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,658
You said we couldn't play that anymore.

93
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,703
Right. And Rowley's parents
are in full agreement.

94
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:29,871
Mm-hmm.

95
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,040
Okay, there. All clean.

96
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,130
Speaking of Rowley,
how's he feeling about Monday?

97
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,633
Is he looking forward
to his first day of middle school?

98
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,926
Hmm. I'm not sure.

99
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,470
I think he might be
a little nervous, actually.

100
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:49,557
Well, he's lucky to have you
as a best friend.

101
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,727
You know, that's all you need to get by
in this world.

102
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,562
One good friend.

103
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,314
Yeah.

104
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,734
And you're lucky to have a big brother

105
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,113
who's already gone through
the middle school experience.

106
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,197
Right, Rodrick?

107
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,118
-Rodrick!
-Huh?

108
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,413
Take off your headphones.
You know the rule.

109
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:15,125
Why don't you give Greg a pep talk
about middle school?

110
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,419
Greg's going to middle school?

111
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,837
Yes, Rodrick.

112
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,341
Why don't you tell him
what he can expect on his first day?

113
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,679
Here's what you need to know.

114
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,892
First of all, watch where you sit
on the first day of school,

115
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,520
because your teacher might make that
your permanent seat.

116
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,275
Next, don't use the bathroom
on the second floor,

117
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,444
no matter how bad you have to go.

118
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,488
-There aren't any doors on those stalls.
-

119
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,117
And finally, whatever you do,

120
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,287
don't get the Cheese Touch.

121
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,457
'Cause if you do,
you might as well be dead.

122
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,002
Thank you, Rodrick,

123
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,171
-for that wonderful pep talk.
-

124
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,257
Greg, please forget
everything that you just heard.

125
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,551
Especially the nonsense about the cheese.

126
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,346
But wha-- what's the Cheese Touch?

127
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,974
It all started
in my first year of middle school.

128
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,893
No one knows where it came from

129
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,561
-or who put it there.
- Don't do it!

130
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,937
One day…
- Stay away!

131
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,523
…a slice of Swiss cheese
appeared on the blacktop.

132
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,608
Ew!

133
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,692
At first,

134
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,235
-no one would go near it.
-Ugh!

135
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,904
And then one day…
-Hmm.

136
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,531
…a kid named Darren Walsh got curious.

137
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,824
No way!
-

138
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,786
And that's what started
the Cheese Touch.

139
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:38,291
The only way to get rid of the Cheese
Touch is to give it to someone else.

140
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,878
Then one day…
-

141
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,172
…a kid named Abe Hall moved to California.

142
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,424
He took the Cheese Touch with him.

143
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,635
But the cheese remained.

144
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,471
And to this day, it sits on the blacktop,

145
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,516
waiting to strike again!

146
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,393
Well, that's terrifying.

147
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,853
Don't let Rodrick scare you, Greg.

148
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,939
Middle school's gonna be fun.

149
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:05,402
Oh, and please don't mention
the-- the cheese thing to Rowley.

150
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,363
Honestly,
it-- it'll scare him half to death.

151
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,323
Who's Rowley?

152
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,408
Greg's best friend.

153
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,494
You know, the kid who's over here
almost every single day.

154
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,829
Oh, him.

155
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,039
I thought you were babysitting that kid.

156
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,874
We're the same age.

157
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,793
He's the same age as y--

158
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:27,674
Oh, man. I thought he was, like,
in kindergarten or something.

159
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,052
Middle school's gonna eat him alive.

160
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,137
Rodrick.

161
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,057
Let me give you
one last piece of advice, Greg.

162
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,768
Middle school is every man for himself.

163
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,688
You don't need some overgrown baby
weighing you down.

164
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,856
Rodrick!

165
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,274
That's enough.

166
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,739
Greg, come on, man. Trust me.

167
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,616
Cut him loose now or you both drown.

168
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,443
-You lose!
- Woo-hoo!

169
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,654
In your face, Greg! That's three in a row.

170
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,406
Wanna go again?

171
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,283
No, that's okay. We can shut it off.

172
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,576
What's the matter?

173
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,371
Afraid to lose?

174
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,706
No, I'm just not in the mood.

175
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,175
Rowley, cut it out!

176
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,636
I mean--

177
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,514
Don't you think
it's time to start acting our age?

178
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,350
But you always do the chicken thing to me.

179
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,811
It's not just that, Rowley.

180
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,062
Look around this room.

181
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:08,775
All these stuffed animals, that bedspread,
and what's with this Joshie guy anyway?

182
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,610
Joshie's from Europe.

183
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:14,364
And you're just jealous
because I discovered him first.

184
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,701
Yeah, I'm jealous that you discovered
some stupid pop star

185
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,786
whose fans are only six-year-old girls.

186
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,079
Joshie says,

187
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,832
"Follow your dreams
and respect your parents."

188
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,751
Don't you think
it's time to grow up, Rowley?

189
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,211
You're in middle school now.

190
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,671
Well, not yet.

191
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,465
"Be friendly to one another, yes?"

192
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,967
Come on, Rowley.

193
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,635
Middle school's no joke.

194
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:40,140
There's bullies, and bathrooms with
no stall doors, and permanent seats,

195
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,183
-and-- and--
-And what?

196
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,436
And the cheese!

197
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,937
What's the cheese?

198
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,361
Please don't mention the cheese thing.

199
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,863
It'll scare him half to death.

200
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,282
You know what?

201
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,825
Forget I said anything.

202
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,871
Middle school's gonna be just fine.
In fact, it'll be great.

203
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,709
Yeah, 'cause we're in it together.
Right, Greg? Friends till the end.

204
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,503
Yeah, friends till the end.

205
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:23,141
Hi, how was your summer?
- My summer was awesome.

206
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,852
No, I hate camp.

207
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,688
Oh, my gosh, I love your backpack.

208
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,648
Did your mom
dress you this morning?

209
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,275
Look at those high waters.

210
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,862
I heard that Peter Mud and Alicia
Tango got their braces stuck together

211
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,114
-over the summer.
-Move to the side, shrimp.

212
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,786
-Come on. Let's go. I don't wanna be late.
-But what about the-- the cheese?

213
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,038
That's just some stupid fairy tale
Rodrick made up.

214
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,083
Stop trying to copy my style, please.

215
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,629
Nice mom jeans, Kelsey.

216
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,547
Hair color…

217
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,258
You know,
maybe this isn't such a good idea.

218
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,219
Maybe my mom can homeschool me.

219
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,512
-Come on, Rowley.
-

220
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,180
You can do this.

221
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:06,393
We can do this. We just need
to find our lockers and we'll be fine.

222
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,727
Heads up.

223
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,145
- Whoa!

224
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:11,773
Ugh!

225
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,776
But I gotta go to the bathroom!
-

226
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,653
Ugh!

227
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,704
-

228
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:29,082
…sanitary.

229
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,792
Yep. Homeschool for sure.

230
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,876
One step at a time.

231
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,546
Don't make eye contact,
and they won't even notice you're here.

232
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,673
You better not be looking
at my boyfriend, Kelsey.

233
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,883
-

234
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,219
Come on. I was eating that.

235
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:44,973
-

236
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,474
Help me.

237
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,979
Mm-mmm.

238
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,356
That was close.

239
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,569
Kindergarten's
down the street.

240
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,196
Not so bad.

241
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,365
And look.
Our lockers are right next to each other.

242
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,242
Yes!

243
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,412
Look. They keep our schedules in here.

244
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,830
Cool. Let me see yours.

245
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,791
But they don't match.

246
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,669
Well, we've got lunch together.
We'll see each other then.

247
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,672
Oh, hey!
- See ya!

248
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:18,965
What do we do now?

249
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,759
We go to homeroom.

250
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,719
Mine's right here.

251
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,305
Yours is upstairs, I think.

252
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,557
-There's an upstairs?
-

253
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,560
-Out of the way, runt.
-Move to the side, shrimp.

254
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,604
-Step aside, little man.
-Yes, not for long, little man.

255
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:36,649
Greg! What do I do? What do I do?

256
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,860
There was no time
to worry about Rowley,

257
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,321
because I needed to focus
on my own situation.

258
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,800
I was glad Rodrick gave me
a few pointers, so I knew what not to do.

259
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,765
Oh, hey.
- Yeah. Awesome.

260
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:12,811
Uh…

261
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,273
-

262
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,320
Exactly!

263
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,073
But it turns out…
- Shh.

264
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,325
…having an older brother
who went to the same school

265
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,577
isn't such a good thing after all.

266
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,538
-Greg Heffley?
-Huh?

267
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,040
-As in Rodrick Heffley's brother?
-

268
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,460
You'll be sitting
in the chair in front of my desk.

269
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,505
-

270
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,801
Oh!

271
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,761
Bro, dude's with the weirdo.
-

272
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,806
Just about everything's different
from elementary school.

273
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,227
Wouldn't want to be him.

274
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,979
Mm-hmm.

275
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,691
And the biggest change
is who's popular and who's not.

276
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,735
-Back in elementary school, it was simple.
-

277
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,279
If you were the fastest runner,
you were the most popular.

278
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,405
-In fifth grade…
-

279
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,282
…the fastest runner was Ronnie McCoy.

280
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,200
But now, all the rules have changed.

281
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,662
Now it's all about whether or not
you have cool hair

282
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,914
and how many followers
you have on social media.

283
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,750
In middle school,

284
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,586
a kid like George Deveney
is at the top of the food chain,

285
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:23,298
and Ronnie McCoy is scratching his head
wondering what the heck happened.

286
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,634
So what I'm trying to figure out
is where I fit into all this.

287
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:30,680
I'm sure I'm not at the top of the ladder,
but at least I'm not at the bottom.

288
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,516
Does this scab smell funny to you?

289
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,436
But there's one way for sure
to get to the bottom.

290
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,520
Come on!

291
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,023
Run! Yeah!
-Yo, get in there for the rebound, dude.

292
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,776
And nobody's risking that.

293
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,071
-

294
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,699
What are you standing around for?

295
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,117
Get the ball!

296
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,119
Ew. It's so gross.
-

297
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:00,669
Hey, what did you get for lunch?
- Today I have a jacket.

298
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,837
Looks pretty full up.

299
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,881
Oh, hey.

300
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,927
Try your luck with someone else.
Maybe try the table next door.

301
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,012
-Eighth-graders only, newbies.

302
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,639
Should we sit with the girls?

303
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,516
We're out of our league here.

304
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,600
Hey! Over there.

305
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,395
-Take a hike.
-Hey.

306
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,814
Band members only.
- Not today, guys.

307
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,816
Over there. Let's go!

308
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,984
Yeah?
Check back when we're not so busy.

309
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,323
Uh…

310
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,451
There's two!

311
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,621
-

312
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,164
And another thing.

313
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:41,042
Don't use the bathroom
on the second floor.

314
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,670
That was a big mistake.

315
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,506
Yeah, I probably
should have warned you about that.

316
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:52,429
I can't deal with this.
I need to be sitting at a table.

317
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,348
But you said only popular kids
get seats at the table.

318
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:58,476
Well, I heard Charlie Davies
is getting braces next week,

319
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,395
so he'll definitely
drop a few spots for sure.

320
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,981
But that's only one spot. We need two.

321
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:09,654
That's all the time we get?
I didn't even get to finish my juice box.

322
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,906
We gotta go to fifth period, Rowley.

323
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,325
I'll meet you back here
at the door after school.

324
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,703
But I don't want to go back out there.

325
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,122
Keep a low profile and you'll be fine.

326
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,876
Think good thoughts, Rowley.

327
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,755
Good thoughts, Rowley. Good thoughts.

328
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,882
Hey, Greg!

329
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:32,260
After school, wanna come over and play?

330
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:35,513
Play, play, play, play, play…

331
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,106
Play.

332
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,608
Play.

333
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,943
-Play.
- Play.

334
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,784
-

335
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,295
-Hey, kid. Wanna come over and play?
-Huh?

336
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,255
Um, no, thank you.

337
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,507
Psst! Rowley!

338
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,135
There you are! You said we were gonna
meet at the back door.

339
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,845
"Hang out," Rowley.

340
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,765
You say "hang out" in middle school,
not "play."

341
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,642
I've told you that a million times.

342
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,561
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

343
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,855
Seriously,
you gotta start listening to me, Rowley.

344
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,524
You're gonna get us both killed.

345
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:32,779
So, do you wanna hang out
and "do" video games?

346
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:33,863
Better.

347
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,993
Thankfully,
Rowley did start listening to me.

348
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,246
We made it through
the next few weeks alive.

349
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,834
But by the time Halloween rolled around,
Rowley started to slip again.

350
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,921
Do you think our teachers will let us
wear our costumes to school tomorrow?

351
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:53,800
No, Rowley. No!
Have I not taught you anything?

352
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,302
They had a costume parade
in elementary school.

353
00:18:56,386 --> 00:19:00,056
Right, elementary school.
We're in middle school now, remember?

354
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,600
Yeah, you keep reminding me.

355
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,145
Listen. The only reason
I'm trick-or-treating this year

356
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,271
is for the candy.

357
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,232
And I really don't want anyone
knowing we're doing this, okay?

358
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,444
-I guess.
-Listen, things are hard enough at school.

359
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,988
I just don't wanna put a target
on our backs, you know?

360
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:16,740
Fine.

361
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,325
So wear something
that doesn't attract too much attention.

362
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,953
-Seriously, we have to be invisible.
-Got it.

363
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,425
Ooh!
Is that our first trick-or-treater?

364
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,594
-Can someone get the door?
-I'm on it.

365
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,188
What? Huh?

366
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:55,487
Rowley, what are you doing?
I thought we said we were being invisible?

367
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,531
-My mom made me add safety stuff.
-We can deal with costume stuff later.

368
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:59,616
Bubby.
- Greg?

369
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,909
Let's get out of here before--

370
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,078
You weren't gonna leave without Manny,
were you?

371
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,331
-Rowley, you look adorable.
-Come on.

372
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,917
-Mom, can't someone else take Manny?

373
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,129
Well, Rodrick's at the high school party,
I'm going to be handing out the candy,

374
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:17,676
and Dad is doing that thing
that he does on Halloween.

375
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,887
Okay. Man your stations.
Well, I'll man mine.

376
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,140
Just making sure we're not getting
toilet-papered this year.

377
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,185
It takes too long to get that off.
No, no. It's not happening.

378
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,604
Good thoughts. All positivity.

379
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,564
But Manny will just slow us down.

380
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,900
We're trying to double our territory
this year, Mom.

381
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,569
Well, there are only so many houses
in our neighborhood.

382
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:37,821
Wait a minute.

383
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:41,324
You're not planning to take the shortcut
through Snake Road, are you?

384
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,951
-What? No.
-

385
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,746
That-- That would be crazy.

386
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:51,084
Good. Because you would be in big trouble
if you did.

387
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,962
-Right, Manny?
-

388
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,091
Keep to the sidewalks,
and I want you back at 8:00.

389
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,259
It's a school night.

390
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,219
8:00? 8:00 a.m.?

391
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,638
All right. I-- I mean, I'm fine with that.

392
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,140
-

393
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:08,143
Fine. 8:30 and not a second later.

394
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:11,104
Oh, Rowley, you know what?
Those glow sticks are a great idea.

395
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,940
Let me see if I have any in the pantry.

396
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,275
Okay, time to go.

397
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,444
-Come on, Manny. You wanna get some candy?
-

398
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:18,820
Arr!

399
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,865
Thank you.
- Isn't he in your class?

400
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,076
That's a kiddy costume!
-All right! Let's go!

401
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,828
It's the Prince of Preschool.

402
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,581
What a dork.

403
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:32,375
Trick or treat.

404
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,003
Trick or treat.

405
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,715
-Candy.
-Aw. Here, take five.

406
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,176
-Yay!
-

407
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,011
Thanks.

408
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,846
Aren't you too old for trick or treat?

409
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,562
What the heck?

410
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,609
Aw.

411
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,570
Bye.

412
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,076
Unbelievable.

413
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:13,416
Come on, guys.
We need to pick up the pace a little.

414
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,709
You guys are killing me.

415
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,966
-

416
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:27,806
Hi.

417
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,934
Is that a cute little pirate I see?

418
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,018
Mm-hmm.

419
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,063
Aw.

420
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,232
Here's some extra booty for your bucket.

421
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,733
-Biggie!
-Seriously?

422
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:41,903
King-size?
It'll take you a week to get through that.

423
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,029
Bubby!

424
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:48,493
Hmm…

425
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,913
-Do you see what's happening here, Rowley?
-Hmm? Aw.

426
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,707
This kid's our golden ticket!
-

427
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,422
-Hmm?
-

428
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,132
Aw.

429
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:03,967
There you go.
-

430
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,218
Oh, yes!

431
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,178
Yay!

432
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,348
Bubby! Candy!

433
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,563
I can't believe we never thought
of bringing Manny.

434
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:18,857
-This kid's a gold mine.
-Yeah.

435
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,526
So we'll stop by my house,
empty these bags in my room,

436
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,445
then head back out for another round,
okay?

437
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:27,490
I don't know. I mean, Manny looks tired.

438
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,367
He's fine. Aren't you, Manny?

439
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,621
See? That was a nod.

440
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:36,541
-Actually, I'm kind of tired too.
-

441
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:40,170
Come on, Rowley.
We can stock up on candy for the year!

442
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,255
We can't let this opportunity go to waste.

443
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:44,132
But we don't need that much candy.

444
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:47,093
Seriously?
You can never have too much candy, Rowley.

445
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:50,430
Candy's like money in middle school.
We can buy someone's lunch seats off them.

446
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,975
How about just like
a couple more houses, okay?

447
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,728
It's the end of the night.

448
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,646
Everyone's looking
to get rid of their candy.

449
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,940
-We can make a killing.
-I don't know.

450
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,902
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna hit Whirley Street.

451
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:06,821
Whirley Street?
But that's like a mile from here.

452
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:09,324
-Not if we take a shortcut.
-Snake Road?

453
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:12,827
-Don't you remember what your mom said?
-She'll never even know.

454
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:16,414
Twenty more minutes and we'll be back
at my house eating our candy. I promise.

455
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,751
We're not little kids anymore.

456
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,721
All right. That's my boy.

457
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,207
I-- I think we made a mistake.

458
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,085
It's gonna be worth it, Rowley.
Just think about all the candy.

459
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,004
I don't even like candy all that much.

460
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:07,090
Rowley, do not say that.
Don't even joke about it.

461
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:10,802
Do you think the Goat Man is gonna get us?

462
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:13,763
Are you kidding me, Rowley?
That's obviously a made-up story.

463
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:17,517
-Rodrick was just trying to scare us.
-That's what you said about the cheese.

464
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,352
And that was real.

465
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:22,063
Yeah, well, a half-man, half-goat?

466
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,274
It's not even physically possible, Rowley.

467
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:28,445
-

468
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:33,950
But--

469
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,494
But if the Goat Man was real,

470
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:39,622
do you think he's a goat on the top
and a person on the bottom?

471
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,791
Or the other way around?

472
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,502
Or do you think
he's got a split down the middle

473
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:47,047
with a goat on the left side
and a person on the right?

474
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,967
Can we stop talking about this?
I think I hear some--

475
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:54,304
-

476
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,308
-

477
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,476
Teenagers!

478
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,978
♪ Breaking the law, breaking the law ♪

479
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,230
Whoa! That was close!

480
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,776
Yeah. Um, let's just keep moving before--

481
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,364
-

482
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:19,412
♪ Breaking the law, breaking the law ♪

483
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:21,539
♪ Breaking the law, breaking the law ♪

484
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:23,958

485
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,627
-

486
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:29,547
Look at these little nerds,
out past their bedtimes.

487
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:33,760
Yeah. Shouldn't you be getting
a good night's sleep?

488
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:42,185
Actually, we're in middle school.
My bedtime's not until 9:00.

489
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,604
Mom let me stay up extra tonight.

490
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:47,565
Yeah, we-- we better head home.
Have a good night, fellas.

491
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,528
Ooh! Look at those bags.
Is that all candy?

492
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,740
Mostly. But my parents handed out
miniature toothbrushes this year,

493
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,409
so we've got those too.

494
00:26:57,492 --> 00:27:00,954
We-- We'd really better get going now.

495
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:05,083
It would be a real pity
if that candy got wet.

496
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:15,135
-

497
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,139
-What?
-Huh?

498
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:23,643
-

499
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,895
Greg, run!

500
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,277
Let's go!

501
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,369
Hang on to Manny!

502
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:51,796
Whoa!

503
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:56,843
-Yeah!
-

504
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,647
Yeah, baby!

505
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,151
Not so fast!

506
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,236
Whoo!

507
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:20,867
-

508
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,994
Whoa!
-

509
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,256
Oh, yes!

510
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,802
You'll pay for this!

511
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,766
We know where you go to school!

512
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,021
-Whoa!
-

513
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:00,740
Is this…

514
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:03,868
My yard! We made it, Rowley.

515
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:05,453
We're alive!

516
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,622
I told you, Rowley.

517
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:10,000
If you just stick with me,
everything will be fine.

518
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,544
Now let's get inside
and enjoy some of this candy.

519
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,715
Ha ha! Oh!

520
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,634
Sorry. I-I thought you were teenagers.

521
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:20,844
Are you all right?

522
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:22,554
You're all right.

523
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,432
We were worried sick about you two.

524
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:26,766
-Mama.
-Where were you boys?

525
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:29,519
Snake Road.

526
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:31,813
Busted.

527
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:34,691
Mom grounded me
from playing video games for a week,

528
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:36,151
which is her go-to punishment.

529
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:39,904
That meant I had to figure out something
else to do with my time after school.

530
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:41,031
Woo-hoo!

531
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:43,616
Woo-hoo!

532
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:53,084
I'm thinking I might either
run for student council

533
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:56,671
or maybe sign up for the dance committee.
Or maybe I'll try out for the play.

534
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:59,132
-They're doing Wizard of Oz this year.
-Uh-huh.

535
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,925
Chirag Gupta wants to be Toto,

536
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:04,596
and Patty Farrell says
Mrs. Norton already promised her Dorothy.

537
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,683
I'm trying to decide if I wanna try out
for the Scarecrow or the Cowardly Lion.

538
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:11,478
Sounds great, Rowley.
Can you go now?

539
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:13,605
Well,
aren't you gonna sign up for anything?

540
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:17,692
My mom says, "It's important to belong to
something when you're in middle school."

541
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:18,985
Belong to something?

542
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:22,113
Rowley, I can't even get a seat at lunch,
and I'm sick and tired of it.

543
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:23,406
But if we were in the play,

544
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,576
we could make friends who could invite us
to sit at their lunch table.

545
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,704
That's a lot of work, Rowley.
And it'll take too much of my time.

546
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,373
I need to change my situation now!

547
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,050
Oh, yeah!

548
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,970
Whoa!

549
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,305
Hey, oh!

550
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:49,057
Rowley!

551
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:53,978
You okay? I feel so bad!
I really didn't mean to flip you.

552
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:57,399
I think I hurt my arm.

553
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:59,984
Yeah, I think I might have pulled
something myself.

554
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:02,821
Can you believe that throw though?
I mean--

555
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:05,448
Ow.

556
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,158
Oh, man. You're really hurt.

557
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:10,870
I think I'd better go home.

558
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:14,374
Okay. But you can't tell your parents
how this happened.

559
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:17,335
If my mom found out
we were playing this game, she'd go nuts.

560
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:20,046
-I'm already grounded.
-What am I supposed to tell them then?

561
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,174
Just say you were playing tag
and that you tripped on the curb.

562
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,802
But whatever you do,
don't mention the Rumble Trike.

563
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:30,098
Got it?

564
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:31,683
Got it.

565
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:41,192
So what happened at the hospital?
- They took a bunch of X-rays.

566
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:43,236
The doctor says my arm is broken.

567
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,404
Broken?

568
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:47,032
Oh, man. I thought it was just
bruised or something.

569
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,909
Nope. I've got a cast and everything.

570
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:52,120
A cast? That's serious!

571
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,580
Yeah, I know.

572
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:55,874
I mean,
that's really awful and everything.

573
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,626
-But do you know what this means?
-Yeah.

574
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:02,339
I have to put a plastic bag over my arm
in the shower for a whole month.

575
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:05,342
No! What this means for school.

576
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:10,096
I guess I can't do
the wrestling unit in Phys Ed?

577
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,183
Rowley! A cast is the greatest
thing that can happen to a kid.

578
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:15,060
-It is?
-Yes, Rowley.

579
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:18,229
-Everyone's gonna wanna sign it.
-What? They will?

580
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:21,191
Yes. Kids will be begging you
to sit at their lunch table.

581
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:22,275
Yeah.

582
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,861
And I hope you'll remember
who your real friends are, Rowley.

583
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,030
The people who helped you get
to where you are.

584
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,823
-Yeah.
-What about your parents?

585
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:29,991
Are they suspicious?

586
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:33,328
I told them I tripped on a rock
playing Duck, Duck, Goose, like you said.

587
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:34,746
Like I said?

588
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:37,957
We were playing tag, Rowley!
And you tripped over the curb.

589
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:41,586
It doesn't even make sense for two people
to play Duck, Duck, Goose. Come on!

590
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:45,382
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.
-We gotta get our story straight,

591
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,384
or they're gonna find out
about the Rumble Trike.

592
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,594
Did you say, "Rumble Trike"?

593
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,936
I don't know
what to do with you, Greg.

594
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,689
First you disobey me and go to Snake Road.

595
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,774
Then you play that-- that game.

596
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:05,819
I told you someone
was going to get hurt playing that.

597
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:07,737
I'm sorry, Mom. I just…

598
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,992
Lying to me is bad enough,

599
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:17,539
but telling Rowley to lie to his parents
is just-- just--

600
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:21,543
Mom, I know I messed up.

601
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,921
You can take away my video games
for the month.

602
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:26,631
The year if it makes you feel better.

603
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:29,884
Punishing you doesn't make me feel better,
Greg.

604
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:31,761
I'm trying to raise a good kid.

605
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:33,513
I do wanna be good, Mom.

606
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:36,224
Well, then here's what you need to do.

607
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:40,061
You need to figure out a way
to make things right by Rowley.

608
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:42,522
You owe that to him.

609
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:45,608
That boy is such a good friend to you.

610
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:47,485
Yeah, Mom.

611
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:50,488
I can't tell you how to make things right.

612
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:52,699
That part is up to you.

613
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:59,914
-But Mom…
-Listen to that inner voice, Greg.

614
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,375
I know it's in there.

615
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:04,377
Do the right thing.

616
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:12,844
Okay,
I know what my mom wanted me to do.

617
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:15,930
She wanted me to tell Rowley's parents
the truth about what happened.

618
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:20,643
But here's the thing.
Rowley's dad has never really liked me.

619
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:23,063
I knew if I told him what really happened,

620
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,607
it was just gonna make him
like me even less.

621
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,317
That wouldn't make things any better.

622
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:29,903
I don't wanna get Rowley in trouble
for lying,

623
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:31,780
'cause then he'd be in trouble too.

624
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:36,618
So, I decided the right thing to do
was to just let things be.

625
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:43,750
Because telling the truth
would make things worse for everybody.

626
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:56,971
-Ooh.
-Oh, my gosh. What happened?

627
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:59,265
-It looks so cool.
-Oh, you're so great.

628
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:01,184
Can I sign it?

629
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:03,812
And I'll tell you another thing
that I was right about.

630
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:08,775
That cast. In fact, it worked even better
than I thought it would.

631
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,320
It's so cool.

632
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:17,909
Just like I predicted, getting
a seat at lunch was no problem at all.

633
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,835
Well,
at least for Rowley it wasn't a problem.

634
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:29,379
Here comes the airplane.

635
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:32,882
-

636
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:35,677
-Nom!
-Here comes the train!

637
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,556
Chugga chugga chugga, choo choo!

638
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,643
He can feed himself just fine, okay?

639
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:45,228
Mmm.

640
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,022
You know Rowley's left-handed?

641
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,356
Who are you?

642
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,234
I'm Greg Heffley, Rowley's best friend.

643
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:52,819
I'm the one who broke his arm.

644
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:55,030
You jerk!

645
00:35:55,113 --> 00:35:56,364
Get out of here.
- Heads up!

646
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,328
I couldn't have Rowley
hog all the attention,

647
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:04,581
so I decided to whip up
an injury of my own.

648
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:19,054
It's just an infection caused by
a splinter that was left untreated.

649
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:24,434
-Hey.
-

650
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:26,770
Can I peek at your infection?

651
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:27,979
Ew.

652
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,858
I realized I couldn't compete
with Rowley's stupid injury.

653
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:36,196
So that meant I needed
to find something of my own.

654
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:38,323
And just like that, I did.

655
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:54,255
Hey, Greg.
I couldn't find you after school.

656
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:55,340
Huh?

657
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:57,842
Sorry. I wanted to go home
and start working on my comics.

658
00:36:57,926 --> 00:37:00,136
Your comics? For what?

659
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,388
The school paper.

660
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:04,099
One of the cartoonists quit,
so now there's a spot open.

661
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:08,895
Can I help?

662
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:11,106
Sorry, Rowley. There's only one spot open.

663
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:18,071
Zoo-Wee Mama!

664
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:21,074
This is funny!

665
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,744
"Oops. I've stepped in a puddle!

666
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:28,248
Well, at least it's not an acid puddle!

667
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:33,086
Ah! It is an acid puddle!

668
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:35,005
Zoo-Wee Mama!"

669
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:38,717
Zoo-Wee Mama!
Do you have any more like this one?

670
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,427
I'm working on something better.

671
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,179
Check this one out.
It's called "Creighton the Cretin."

672
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:47,642
"Hiya, doc! Can I get a new butt?
My old one has a crack in it."

673
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:50,437
"Everyone's butt has a crack in it,
you idiot!"

674
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,521
"Oops."

675
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,399
But when does he say, "Zoo-Wee Mama"?

676
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:55,692
He doesn't.

677
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:59,738
I think it'd be funnier if he said,
"Zoo-Wee Mama!"

678
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:06,036
You know what? If you wanna draw
your own comic, be my guest.

679
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,371
But we always do everything together.

680
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,416
Yeah, well, not this time. Sorry.

681
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,753
But can we be partners?

682
00:38:14,836 --> 00:38:16,838
You can write the comic,
and I can draw it.

683
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:20,175
No offense, Rowley,
but you don't even draw noses on people.

684
00:38:20,258 --> 00:38:24,304
Sorry. This is kinda my thing,
like the way Joshie's your thing.

685
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:28,308
Okay. Well, I guess I'll go work
on my comic at my house.

686
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:30,185
Sounds good.

687
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:39,736
See ya.

688
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:47,077
-

689
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,497
After I turned in my comic,
all I could do was wait.

690
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:53,583
But after a whole week went by,

691
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:56,628
Mr. Humphreys made an announcement.

692
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:59,422
Attention, students.
After careful consideration,

693
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:02,634
we've made a decision
on the cartoonist for the school paper.

694
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:04,469
And the new cartoonist is…

695
00:39:05,178 --> 00:39:08,014
-Greg Heffley.
-Yes! Yes!

696
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:13,478
This is possibly the biggest thing
that has ever happened to me.

697
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:17,148
-That's the dude?
-He wrote that?

698
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,818
Is that cartoon kid?

699
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,948
For the first time since I stepped
through those double doors,

700
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:26,700
I wasn't invisible.

701
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:28,284
-Teacher's pet!

702
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:30,286
Aren't comics supposed
to make you laugh?

703
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,579
"Creighton the Curious Student."

704
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:33,248
Did you think that was funny?
-What the--

705
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:38,336
"Teacher, if x plus 43 is 89,
what would x be?"

706
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,046
"Why, it would be 46!"

707
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,299
"Thanks! Kids,
if you'd like to learn more about math,

708
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:45,677
have Mr. Humphreys show you around

709
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,139
the newly expanded
math and science section of the library."

710
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:53,309
"And thanks to the Parent-Teacher
Organization for funding the new section.

711
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:55,729
Our old books were badly outdated."

712
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,230
They changed it?

713
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:59,899
-Teacher's pet!
-Thanks for ruining my day.

714
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:01,735
-What a waste of ink.
-Nerd!

715
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:06,865
Boo!

716
00:40:06,948 --> 00:40:07,949
Teacher's pet!

717
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:09,409
See? That's what happens

718
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:11,953
when the school librarian
is in charge of the newspaper.

719
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:14,080
They've always gotta get pushy
with their books.

720
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,542
One week after I quit,

721
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:21,171
Mr. Humphreys chose someone to replace me,
and you'll never believe who he picked.

722
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:23,131
Zoo-Wee Mama!
-

723
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:27,886
Zoo-Wee Mama!

724
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,977
Zoo-Wee Mama!
-Zoo-Wee Mama!

725
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:39,356
Zoo-Wee Mama!

726
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:43,568
Zoo-Wee Mama!

727
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:50,200
"Hey, pretty lady.
Do you wanna go on a date?"

728
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:53,411
"I'm actually not a lady.
I'm one of those dogs with long hair.

729
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:55,330
So, no thanks to that date."

730
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:57,207
"Zoo-Wee Mama!"

731
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:01,878
So a kid who can barely draw
got his comic in the school paper?

732
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:05,298
It's totally unfair.
Why didn't they censor Rowley's work?

733
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,183
You stole my comic.

734
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:17,310
You said you didn't wanna do it anymore.

735
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:20,146
Well, couldn't you come up
with something original for once, Rowley?

736
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,732
Well, I can't help it
if I'm just naturally funny.

737
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:24,359
Zoo-Wee Mama!

738
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:25,777
Zoo-Wee Mama!

739
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,114
-Zoo-Wee Mama!
- Zoo-Wee Mama!

740
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:35,745
You know what? I hope you enjoy all this,
because I'm tired of carrying you.

741
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,747
Maybe it's the other way around.

742
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:40,917
This comic, this lunch table, that cast.

743
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:43,378
You wouldn't have any of it
if it wasn't for me!

744
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:45,547
Yeah, because you broke my arm.

745
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,840
Yeah. You're welcome.

746
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,100
Rowley deserves your respect.
-

747
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,895
-Zoo-Wee Mama!
- Oh!

748
00:42:02,063 --> 00:42:03,815
Okay, I'll admit.

749
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:06,609
Maybe I could have handled
the situation at lunch a little better.

750
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:08,028
But I figured, after a while,

751
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:10,447
me and Rowley would cool down,
things would go back to normal.

752
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,574
So do you like DinoBlasters?

753
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:13,658
No.

754
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,618
I love it.

755
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:22,167
Thing is, that hasn't happened yet.

756
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:31,968
Rowley's been hanging out
with this kid Chirag every day.

757
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:34,721
You know the only reason he's doing it
is to make me jealous.

758
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,933
But two can play at that game.

759
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:45,190
-You wanna see my room?
-Yeah.

760
00:43:06,795 --> 00:43:07,796
Yes! Come on!

761
00:43:24,187 --> 00:43:28,817
The one and only Greg Heffley
is on my front step.

762
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,987
Yeah, I guess I am.

763
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:36,825
So I was thinking,
me and you are neighbors.

764
00:43:36,908 --> 00:43:37,909
Yeah. Uh-huh.

765
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:40,745
But we barely even know each other.

766
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:42,330
How'd you feel about a sleepover?

767
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:43,415
Tonight?

768
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:46,835
Yeah. Right now.
You and me. Just a couple of pals.

769
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:48,753
Woo-hoo! Come on in.

770
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:06,354
-

771
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:12,152
You know, maybe we should take this
one step at a time.

772
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:15,947
How about if we just play
a quick game of cards and call it a night?

773
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:20,577
-

774
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,163
Hey, Greg.

775
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:29,794
-

776
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:32,881
Oh, Fregley.
Do you have a playmate over?

777
00:44:32,964 --> 00:44:35,675
Would you like for me
to knit him some socks?

778
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:38,303
Yep. I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna be in therapy over this.

779
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:41,598
Whoo!

780
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:43,725
Greg Heffley's in my room.

781
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:45,685
Woo-hoo!

782
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:48,396
Yeah, but just for a short visit.

783
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,023
In fact, I really need to be--

784
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:51,608
You wanna play make-believe?

785
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,862
You can be the church organist,
and I'll be the school hygienist.

786
00:44:58,114 --> 00:45:00,950
You know, that's tempting.
But I'm not really into--

787
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:03,411
How about a tickle fight?

788
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:06,081
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

789
00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:08,208
I'm gonna tickle, tickle.

790
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,293
I got you. I'm tickling you. Ha ha!

791
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:14,047
Hey! What are you doing?

792
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,465
Give me some space here.

793
00:45:15,548 --> 00:45:17,092
Can't you just stay over there?

794
00:45:17,175 --> 00:45:20,178
Well, what do you wanna do then?

795
00:45:22,722 --> 00:45:24,432
I don't know. I thought if we…

796
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:29,020
Mmm.

797
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:32,565
Fregley! That's the only candy bar
I had that wasn't wet.

798
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:34,859
Mom never lets me have chocolate.

799
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:39,447
Says it makes me hyperactive and unstable.

800
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:46,204
-Fregley, are you okay? Fregley!
-

801
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:48,331
I've blocked out big parts
of that night.

802
00:45:48,915 --> 00:45:51,376
Hey, Greg.

803
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,796
I'm so glad I can't remember
every little thing that happened.

804
00:45:58,883 --> 00:45:59,926
-Hey!

805
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,595
But what I do remember

806
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:05,306
is that I ended up
locked up in Fregley's bathroom

807
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,684
while I waited
for his sugar high to wear off.

808
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:18,361
Dear Gregory,

809
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:21,906
I'm sorry I ate your candy
and chased you with a booger.

810
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:25,535
Here, I put it on this piece of paper
so you can get me back.

811
00:46:25,618 --> 00:46:27,579
Signed, Fregley.

812
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,165
What the--

813
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:34,210
But if I could, I would forget everything.

814
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:11,498
-

815
00:47:16,461 --> 00:47:18,505
Hey, Greg. Hey!

816
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:20,215
Oh, hey. Hey, Rowley. What's up?

817
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:22,217
I was wondering
if I could stop by your house today

818
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,094
and pick up my copy of Twisted Wizard.

819
00:47:24,177 --> 00:47:25,762
Me and Chirag want to play it.

820
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:30,266
Yeah, well, I've had it for a while,
so it's kind of mine now.

821
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,894
I guess you and your new friend
will have to find something else to do.

822
00:47:32,977 --> 00:47:36,189
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm not the only one
with a new friend.

823
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:37,399
You mean Fregley?

824
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:39,484
I'm permanently scarred from that night.

825
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:41,611
And it's all your fault for ditching me.

826
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:44,155
I ditched you?
More like the other way around.

827
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:47,450
You haven't been the same ever since
you got that stupid cast.

828
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:48,702
-You've changed.
-Fight!

829
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:50,495
-Oh, yeah?
- They're gonna fight.

830
00:47:50,578 --> 00:47:52,706
Well, you're the one who broke my arm.

831
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:54,624
You can take him. Knock him down!

832
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:57,627
Guys, come over. Come check out the fight.

833
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:01,881
Why don't you make a move?
- Unless you're chicken.

834
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:04,509
Fight, fight, fight!

835
00:48:04,592 --> 00:48:08,054
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

836
00:48:08,638 --> 00:48:10,807
Where'd you learn to fight?
Ballerina school?

837
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,351
If you don't do something,
I'm gonna fall asleep.

838
00:48:13,435 --> 00:48:15,937
Who taught you how to fight? Your granny?

839
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:18,857
Are you two gonna fight
or keep dancing with each other?

840
00:48:19,649 --> 00:48:21,568
Do they even know how to do this?

841
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:24,946
-

842
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:27,365
-Let's get out of here!
-Come on. Let's go!

843
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:34,581
Well, look who it is.

844
00:48:34,664 --> 00:48:36,958
Our little friends from Halloween.

845
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:39,878
We told you we'd find you.

846
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:42,922
And now you're gonna pay
for busting my tire.

847
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:47,927
But, like, how are they gonna pay?

848
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:50,347
Yeah. Do you mean, like, with money?

849
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,390
'Cause not everybody
carries cash these days.

850
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:53,892
No, you morons.

851
00:48:53,975 --> 00:48:57,228
Pay, as in, like, revenge.

852
00:48:58,563 --> 00:49:02,359
Okay. Now we're all on the same page.

853
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:08,031
Okay. Now what?

854
00:49:08,114 --> 00:49:09,991
I am thinking.

855
00:49:10,075 --> 00:49:11,076
Ooh! Ooh!

856
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:13,370
-You still got that fire extinguisher?
-

857
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:20,001
Nah. My mom made me
put it back in the house for "fires."

858
00:49:24,964 --> 00:49:26,841
What's this one looking at?

859
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:29,177
Uh, it looks like…

860
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:31,638
Cheese!

861
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:35,475
-

862
00:49:35,558 --> 00:49:37,519
Now, I really can't say
what happened next.

863
00:49:37,602 --> 00:49:40,313
Because if Rowley ever tries to run
for president when he grows up

864
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:42,607
and people find out
what those teenagers made him do,

865
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:44,234
he won't have a chance.

866
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:47,821
So all I'm gonna say

867
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:50,031
is that the teenagers made Rowley

868
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:53,660
-blank, blank, blank the cheese.
-

869
00:49:58,331 --> 00:50:00,625
Okay. You're next.

870
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:04,754
No. But I just had lunch.
I'm not even really that hungry.

871
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:06,423
You're not getting out of this.

872
00:50:06,506 --> 00:50:09,050
But, um, I'm lactose intolerant.

873
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:12,137
It'll make me gassy.

874
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:33,033
-Huh?

875
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:34,659
Get out of here, you punks!

876
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,751
You boys okay?

877
00:50:46,921 --> 00:50:48,882
What happened?
-They're gone.

878
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:51,259
-What's going on?
-What's going on over here?

879
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:52,844
The cheese!

880
00:50:52,927 --> 00:50:54,804
Look! There's--

881
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:56,723
There's a piece missing!

882
00:50:56,806 --> 00:50:58,475
What?
- What?

883
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:03,521
-Disgusting!
- Ew!

884
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:07,484
Trust me, I was tempted to tell
everyone the truth about what happened,

885
00:51:07,567 --> 00:51:10,028
but then
I heard that annoying inner voice.

886
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:12,697
Do the right thing, Greg.

887
00:51:12,781 --> 00:51:15,492
That's all you need to get by
in this world, you know?

888
00:51:15,575 --> 00:51:17,035
One good friend.

889
00:51:17,118 --> 00:51:18,661
Somebody has the Cheese Touch.

890
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:20,997
Rowley Jefferson ate the--

891
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:22,207
No!

892
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:26,211
It was me! Those teenagers
dared me to do it, and I did it!

893
00:51:26,294 --> 00:51:28,046
So what? No big deal.

894
00:51:28,129 --> 00:51:32,884
-Greg Heffley has the Cheese Touch!
-

895
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:35,804
He has the Cheese Touch.
- Oh, ew!

896
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:38,723
The Cheese Touch!

897
00:51:41,434 --> 00:51:44,354
Okay, so I might have
bent the truth a little,

898
00:51:44,437 --> 00:51:47,982
but sometimes you have to do
that sort of thing to help a friend.

899
00:51:48,733 --> 00:51:49,734
So, uh…

900
00:51:50,276 --> 00:51:52,529
you, uh, wanna go to my place

901
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:55,907
and, I don't know,
play some Twisted Wizard?

902
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:58,243
Yeah. That'd be good.

903
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:07,961
Oh, man. I totally would've had you.

904
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:11,297
Are you kidding?
You were totally about to start crying.

905
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:13,299
I had something in my eye.

906
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:16,094
I could've taken you
with my eyes closed.

907
00:52:16,177 --> 00:52:18,471
I could've beaten you
with my little pinkie.

908
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:22,976
Having the Cheese Touch
hasn't been as bad as I thought.

909
00:52:23,059 --> 00:52:24,060
Cheese Touch!

910
00:52:26,771 --> 00:52:29,065
The kids at school
give me plenty of space.

911
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,901
And it's not just in the hallways.

912
00:52:32,902 --> 00:52:35,155
I've pretty much got the run of the place.

913
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:39,534
And the best part is,

914
00:52:39,617 --> 00:52:42,871
getting a seat at lunch
is not a problem anymore.

915
00:52:44,622 --> 00:52:45,623
-Run!
-

916
00:52:45,707 --> 00:52:48,710
In fact,
I've got a whole table to myself.

917
00:52:55,258 --> 00:52:58,386
Well, maybe not entirely to myself,
but I'm fine with it.

918
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:02,349
And things are good with me and Rowley.

919
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:04,184
In fact, they're better than good.

920
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:10,357
But if Rowley ever steps out of line,

921
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,401
I'll let everyone know
who really ate the you-know-what.

922
00:53:16,154 --> 00:53:18,239
Come on. Almost there.

923
00:53:18,323 --> 00:53:19,741
-

924
00:53:19,824 --> 00:53:21,326
-I got you.
-

925
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:25,080
-Eat my dust! Get out of my way!
-Oh, you got lucky that time.

926
00:53:25,163 --> 00:53:26,539
How are you this bad?

927
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:28,333
-Oh!
-Best of three!
