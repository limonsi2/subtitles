3
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:16,535
We knew that they would come for us.

4
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:22,416
Like they always had before.

5
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:29,673
We tried to warn the others
that they would come for them too.

6
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:36,430
Because we knew how far they would go.

7
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:45,480
Four years ago, I was fasting in the bush.

8
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:54,656
I saw that a swarm of giant mosquitos
would be coming for us.

9
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,621
I also saw that a person, a guardian,

10
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:07,211
would come from the north to help us.

11
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:16,595
We heard stories about
this place called Bigstone.

12
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:22,559
We thought this person
could lead us there.

13
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,242
This is Cree land.

14
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:18,390
You're Cree?

15
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:25,397
Do you speak Cree?

16
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:11,026
Were you tracking her?

17
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:17,574
I think she might beÂ okanaweyihcikew.

18
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:28,460
Find out everything you can on her. Hurry.

19
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:33,131
I need to talk to the
Elders and the leaders.

20
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:34,091
Wait.

21
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:35,008
No.

22
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:36,510
No.

23
00:44:37,803 --> 00:44:39,721
Our search may be over.

24
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:07,791
You were so busy playing around while
there was a battle going on,

25
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:09,835
you didn't notice her coming.

26
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:17,926
Just like your farts.

27
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:28,937
Welcome Niska.

28
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,235
Get her some food.

29
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:54,796
I was woken up

30
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:57,341
to come and meet this woman.

31
00:45:58,217 --> 00:45:59,051
Where is she?

32
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:01,303
There she is.

33
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:02,596
From Kiskachewanohk.

34
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:05,057
Niska come.

35
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:27,371
I am glad to meet you.

36
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:44,721
Long ago, we were told that someone
would be arriving from the north.

37
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:49,726
We have been waiting
for you for a long time.

38
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:54,147
You are the guardian.

39
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:05,951
And now we will dance.

40
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:14,751
Two more children have been brought back
along with one of our own. Welcome.

41
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:06,149
You are welcome here
in Kitsaki, Niska.

42
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:09,862
Come. Get some rest.

43
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:25,437
Welcome Niska.

44
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:33,946
Waseese is in an evil place.

45
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:44,665
The kids are trained to become
Jingo puppets.

46
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:47,960
They are subjected to unspeakable things.

47
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:56,134
Wouldn't you rather talk to Waseese?

48
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,472
We can get her from the Academy.

49
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:08,605
But there is one thing
we ask of you in return.

50
00:53:09,898 --> 00:53:14,069
We need you to take the children
to a safe zone up north.

51
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:21,326
No, it's real.

52
00:53:21,827 --> 00:53:24,663
And we need someone
to take the children there.

53
00:54:31,647 --> 00:54:35,526
We look at these rocks as
life forms, similar to the trees.

54
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:38,654
This reflects how we see and think.

55
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:42,824
This is a balsam tree.

56
00:54:45,244 --> 00:54:47,037
We use them in many different ways.

57
00:55:21,363 --> 00:55:22,489
What are you doing here?

58
00:55:36,837 --> 00:55:38,797
You better go convince her then.

59
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:28,195
Come in.

60
01:15:33,408 --> 01:15:38,580
All of our relations are meeting here.

61
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:44,211
We need to do this in a good way
and think in a good way.

62
01:15:45,128 --> 01:15:47,172
Thank you grandmother.

63
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:53,512
We must evacuate the camp
children by tonight.

64
01:15:58,392 --> 01:16:00,853
The Jingoes have built a new mining road

65
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:03,981
overnight that is heading
straight for our camp.

66
01:16:04,356 --> 01:16:13,323
We're concerned that we've run
out of time for the raid.

67
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:21,331
We want to help but they've advanced much
faster than what we thought.

68
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:38,265
Long ago, our grandfathers were here.
They all lived here.

69
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:47,316
But then this government
forced us to leave.

70
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:55,240
They even tried to kill us.

71
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:58,702
They even tried to kill us.

72
01:16:58,827 --> 01:17:00,162
But they could not do it.

73
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:05,083
We are still here.

74
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:12,174
The goose is never alone on a journey.

75
01:17:12,424 --> 01:17:20,098
In order to succeed,
she always travels with a partner.

76
01:17:20,474 --> 01:17:23,393
This is what we also have to do as people.

77
01:17:25,062 --> 01:17:27,189
Thank you grandmother.

78
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:37,241
Niska, do we agree or not?

79
01:17:42,454 --> 01:17:45,916
Somonis, prepare the
camp. Leo and Charlie,

80
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:49,086
you'll raid tonight for the last time.

81
01:26:51,128 --> 01:26:53,839
Run!

82
01:26:58,677 --> 01:27:00,220
Any sign of them?

83
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:04,600
How many?

84
01:27:05,017 --> 01:27:05,851
Twenty...

85
01:27:16,403 --> 01:27:18,197
I'll get the kids out.

86
01:27:18,488 --> 01:27:20,032
You lead the line.

87
01:27:22,534 --> 01:27:23,368
No.

88
01:27:23,535 --> 01:27:26,788
The kids need protection.

89
01:27:27,581 --> 01:27:29,249
You can do this.

90
01:27:35,923 --> 01:27:40,969
Nothing makes me more proud
than to stand with you all.

91
01:27:42,221 --> 01:27:47,226
If we take our last breaths fighting
against our colonizers,

92
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,772
then it will be a good way to die.

93
01:27:57,069 --> 01:27:59,112
Somonis will lead the line.

94
01:28:46,785 --> 01:28:49,288
Give me enough time to get them out.

95
01:34:48,772 --> 01:34:54,319
It was her mother that brought her to us.

96
01:34:55,445 --> 01:34:58,198
All the way down from the north.

97
01:34:59,324 --> 01:35:06,331
She came back to her people
to protect us on that day.

98
01:35:09,251 --> 01:35:13,255
We call her the guardian.
