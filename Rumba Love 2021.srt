01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:21,505
I'm leaving.

881
01:09:27,946 --> 01:09:30,166
[sighs]

882
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:35,171
I'm leaving. Just leave me
right now. I'm leaving.

883
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:38,174
Leaving. Easy.

884
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:40,785
We're cool. Right?

885
01:09:40,827 --> 01:09:43,221
-Are we?
-We're not cool.

886
01:09:43,265 --> 01:09:45,005
We're cool.
I mean, I'm leaving right now.

887
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:47,051
It's your park. The bench.

888
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,532
That's fine.

889
01:09:52,797 --> 01:09:55,495
[man] Did you tell her what I
told you to tell her last week?

890
01:09:55,582 --> 01:09:58,368
Yes, but she's incapable
of straightening out things

891
01:09:58,411 --> 01:10:00,282
on her calendar.

892
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:05,070
We have been planning
this trip to Portugal forever.

893
01:10:05,112 --> 01:10:06,680
Last time we talked about it

894
01:10:06,811 --> 01:10:09,727
we both agreed on staying
at Lisboa just for three days.

895
01:10:09,857 --> 01:10:12,469
And then the plan was driving.

896
01:10:12,512 --> 01:10:14,688
Now she's afraid to drive
because she's afraid

897
01:10:14,818 --> 01:10:17,213
of her insurance
working in Europe.

898
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:18,388
Who cares?

899
01:10:21,434 --> 01:10:24,611
What's up with this guy?

900
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:26,526
Well, do something!
Tell someone.

901
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:28,398
Yeah.

902
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:37,842
Sorry, but you gotta leave.

903
01:10:37,885 --> 01:10:39,583
Yeah, man. Sorry about that.

904
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:43,021
[soft piano music playing]

905
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:53,570
Hold on.

906
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,919
-How's your coffee?
-Good.

907
01:11:54,962 --> 01:11:56,573
-Okay. Milk?
-Yes.

908
01:11:56,702 --> 01:11:57,922
You got a call.

909
01:12:00,098 --> 01:12:01,186
[sighs]

910
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:06,234
Hello?

911
01:12:06,278 --> 01:12:10,848
[Nico] I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm hungry and I'm homeless.

912
01:12:10,978 --> 01:12:14,504
Meet me at the same place
in 15 minutes.

913
01:12:14,547 --> 01:12:16,201
I gotta go.

914
01:12:19,552 --> 01:12:20,945
Where is Lewis?

915
01:12:22,163 --> 01:12:25,732
-He's in the kitchen.
-Tell him that I have to go.

916
01:12:25,776 --> 01:12:27,734
-It's an emergency.
-Again?

917
01:12:27,778 --> 01:12:30,084
I have to do this.

918
01:12:30,128 --> 01:12:32,826
He won't let you come back this
time. You know that, don't you?

919
01:12:32,957 --> 01:12:37,570
I know, but I really
have to do this.

920
01:12:43,576 --> 01:12:44,708
Go.

921
01:12:46,536 --> 01:12:47,537
Thanks.

922
01:12:52,193 --> 01:12:56,937
[jazz saxophone playing]

923
01:13:01,028 --> 01:13:03,074
Hey, what'd you think?

924
01:13:03,204 --> 01:13:07,121
Are you trying to connect
spiritually with rum?

925
01:13:07,252 --> 01:13:11,474
You don't have anyone
else to connect to,

926
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:13,476
rum becomes the best company.

927
01:13:13,606 --> 01:13:15,695
Can I sit and talk to you,

928
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:19,482
so you have someone else to
connect with besides the bottle?

929
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:30,493
I wanted to...

930
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:34,192
I wanted to thank you
for what you did for me.

931
01:13:34,235 --> 01:13:37,108
-What did I do?
-Well...

932
01:13:37,237 --> 01:13:41,068
-You know, my tuition.
-Tuition? What tuition?

933
01:13:41,504 --> 01:13:44,157
You covered my semester's
tuition at the university.

934
01:13:44,245 --> 01:13:47,987
They called me from the office,
Jim. They said you covered it.

935
01:13:50,643 --> 01:13:52,558
Well...

936
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:55,996
-Somebody made a mistake.
-Why?

937
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:58,912
Why do you do that?

938
01:13:58,956 --> 01:14:04,264
I mean, I am so thankful
for what you did for me.

939
01:14:07,355 --> 01:14:10,271
But why did you help me?

940
01:14:10,315 --> 01:14:13,187
Why do you help everybody?

941
01:14:13,318 --> 01:14:16,930
You know, everybody tells
stories about you

942
01:14:17,061 --> 01:14:19,933
helping them out
with something,

943
01:14:19,977 --> 01:14:23,894
paying for something
without them asking or...

944
01:14:23,937 --> 01:14:28,550
just giving, giving without
being even asked for it.

945
01:14:28,594 --> 01:14:31,902
Why did you help me?
Why do you help everybody?

946
01:14:31,945 --> 01:14:34,644
I should help.

947
01:14:34,773 --> 01:14:36,341
I need to help.
It's an obligation.

948
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:39,083
-But why?
-Because I can.

949
01:14:40,737 --> 01:14:43,870
And because
I got nothing else to do.

950
01:14:44,001 --> 01:14:46,699
And probably because
you have no one else to help.

951
01:14:48,919 --> 01:14:50,050
I'm sorry.

952
01:14:52,662 --> 01:14:57,188
Can I ask you something?
Who was the guy from yesterday?

953
01:14:57,318 --> 01:15:00,147
You've been acting weird
ever since.

954
01:15:00,191 --> 01:15:03,716
Stop. Just a kid
looking for a job.

955
01:15:03,803 --> 01:15:05,588
And you didn't help him?

956
01:15:07,067 --> 01:15:08,678
It's complicated.

957
01:15:12,638 --> 01:15:14,727
He brought back memories
that, uh...

958
01:15:14,771 --> 01:15:17,948
Bad memories?

959
01:15:17,991 --> 01:15:19,602
No.

960
01:15:21,995 --> 01:15:24,258
Matter of fact, they were...

961
01:15:24,302 --> 01:15:26,304
[sighs]

962
01:15:28,175 --> 01:15:30,700
They were good memories.

963
01:15:30,743 --> 01:15:33,790
Probably the best memories
I've ever had,

964
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,270
and that's why
I reacted the way I did.

965
01:15:36,314 --> 01:15:40,187
Yeah. I had lost something,
and I didn't notice it, and...

966
01:15:43,059 --> 01:15:46,585
I'm trying to bury the past,
and he just brought it back.

967
01:15:51,068 --> 01:15:52,416
That's... buried now.

968
01:15:52,504 --> 01:15:54,505
And you don't want
to see those memories

969
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,554
-you enjoyed so much, again?
-No.

970
01:15:58,597 --> 01:16:00,164
No.

971
01:16:00,294 --> 01:16:01,513
Why?

972
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,862
It's too late.

973
01:16:05,996 --> 01:16:08,215
No, Jim.

974
01:16:08,259 --> 01:16:11,218
It's never too late. Trust me.

975
01:16:11,262 --> 01:16:13,830
As long as we're here,

976
01:16:13,873 --> 01:16:17,268
it's never too late to reconnect
with your happiest memories.

977
01:16:17,398 --> 01:16:20,663
It's okay to make yourself
happy, too,

978
01:16:20,706 --> 01:16:24,231
to give to yourself
the way you give to others.

[solemn piano music playing]

980
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:34,737
Why didn't you call me before?

981
01:17:34,867 --> 01:17:36,695
I didn't want to bother.

982
01:17:36,826 --> 01:17:38,697
You don't bother me.

983
01:17:39,871 --> 01:17:41,439
Thanks for the food.

984
01:17:41,482 --> 01:17:43,049
Seriously?

-[coughs]
-Can I take your plate?

987
01:17:48,925 --> 01:17:51,449
Yes. Yes.

[exhales deeply]

990
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:59,718
I want to talk to you
about, you know, us.

991
01:17:59,849 --> 01:18:01,546
Nico, don't.

992
01:18:03,416 --> 01:18:05,202
Just forget everything.

993
01:18:07,334 --> 01:18:09,859
You can't do anything
to bring him back, right?

994
01:18:11,556 --> 01:18:13,340
You can do
something for yourself

995
01:18:13,384 --> 01:18:15,907
and make him feel proud of you.

996
01:18:19,956 --> 01:18:24,047
After that night with you
in Cuba, I felt guilty.

997
01:18:26,614 --> 01:18:33,099
But then I thought about him,
and I remember how he was.

998
01:18:33,143 --> 01:18:36,233
And I know that if he would
have been watching us

999
01:18:36,362 --> 01:18:39,323
from some faraway place,

1000
01:18:39,366 --> 01:18:42,543
he would have felt happy
that I was with you.

1001
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:52,815
-Let me take you home.
-No. No. [clears throat]

You're homeless.

You gotta take a shower.
You gotta eat.

1005
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:04,348
You gotta sleep in a warm place.

1006
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:07,568
You have to move on.

1007
01:19:07,612 --> 01:19:10,528
-You have to change, Nico.
-I gotta finish first.

1008
01:19:12,965 --> 01:19:15,620
Then I'll change.

-Twenty five? That's bad.

-How about white?
-Uh, 30.

1012

Thirty? Cases of beer?

1013
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:56,748
Fifteen, but I think
we started out with 20.

-Shh. Hold on a second.

-Just gimme that!

who two days ago

after he invaded my park!

01:20:57,330 --> 01:20:59,115
-What'd you do to my lady?
-I didn't do anything to her.

1028
01:20:59,245 --> 01:21:00,638
-Hold it.
-No, no, no.

1029
01:21:00,681 --> 01:21:02,814
Hey! Shut up.

1030
01:21:02,945 --> 01:21:05,469
-You don't belong here.
-He's a monster, a number 12.

1031
01:21:05,512 --> 01:21:06,905
You have to pay the price

1032
01:21:06,949 --> 01:21:08,776
if you don't respect
our community.

1033
01:21:08,907 --> 01:21:10,474
We have rules to follow here.

1034
01:21:10,517 --> 01:21:13,303
-Can't just invade our space.
-I'm not invading your space.

1035
01:21:13,346 --> 01:21:14,870
We gave you
a few chances already.

1036
01:21:14,957 --> 01:21:17,002
You just ignored us,
blew us off.

1037
01:21:17,133 --> 01:21:19,135
-I wonder what this crazy--
-No!

-Stop that now!
-Who the fuck are you?

-Hey, Jim.
-Charles, don't do that.

1042

Hey, Jim. He--

1043
01:21:36,065 --> 01:21:37,936
We're just teaching
this guy a lesson. He--

1044
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:39,677
He doesn't follow the rules.

1045
01:21:39,764 --> 01:21:42,853
Rules?

1046
01:21:42,985 --> 01:21:44,073
What the hell you talking about,
Prince?

1047
01:21:44,116 --> 01:21:49,165
Um, our rules. He's an intruder.

1048
01:21:49,295 --> 01:21:52,081
-He is enemy.
-No, he's not.

1049
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,693
He's my son.

1050
01:21:58,174 --> 01:21:59,218
Your son?

1051
01:22:00,654 --> 01:22:02,004
I didn't know you had a son.

1052
01:22:02,134 --> 01:22:04,005
But he doesn't look
anything like you.

1053

-Do you resemble your mama?
