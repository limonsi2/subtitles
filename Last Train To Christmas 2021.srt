'Good afternoon everybody.

00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,040
Welcome aboard the 15:05

5
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,320
I would like to take this
opportunity to welcome you onboard

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,000
and wish you all a very merry
Christmas.'

♪Merry Christmas
- Everyone ♪

8
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,320
No, no, no, no. Not that way, love.

9
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,440
Not that way. Down here.

10
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,960
Good morning, good morning.

11
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
Ooh.
Hey, d'you want some bubbly?

12
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Sue! Come on.

13
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,280
We're gonna have some bubbly.

14
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,720
They don't do champagne, do they?

15
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,240
They do for Tony Towers.

16
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
Here y'are, love.

17
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,800
Can you give us a hand
with those there?

18
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,000
Hey, d'you like clubbing?

19
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,920
What?
Any weeknight, week night.

20
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,840
Bring this card, tell 'em
Tony Towers sent you.

21
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,400
Right, now, everyone...

22
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,400
..who wants to join us for champers?
You're all welcome.

23
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,000
Ooh, yes!
How many? Yes?

24
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,240
One, three, four, five, six, seven...
Tony.

25
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,360
What? What?
Tony.

26
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,280
We're gonna have champagne,
we're gonna have, er...

27
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,600
What's it...
Now That's What I Call Music 5!

28
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,960
Tony, stop it. Stop it!
What?! We're celebrating!

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,480
Sorry about this.
He's just a little over excited.

30
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,400
Don't worry, we'll keep it down.

31
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,880
Oi, you!

32
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Sue!
Get off!

33
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,560
Right, let's get this
party started, eh?!

34
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,840
Oh, Tony, where you going?
They're getting on any minute.

35
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,520
I'll be back before Luton.

36
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,840
But I feel nervous, Tone.

37
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,440
Sue.

38
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,920
Darling.

39
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,360
What you gotta be nervous about?

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,120
After what Roger did to me,

41
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,800
he's the one who should be nervous.

42
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,280
Listen,

43
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,920
don't you worry your
pretty little head about it.

44
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,960
OK.

45
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,280
Tell you what.

46
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,600
What?

47
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,720
You and me...
Hmm.

48
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,600
..can have a little look around
Tiffany's when

49
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,920
we're back.
It's too much, Tone.

50
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,360
OK, Ratners.
I don't need any more presents!

51
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,480
What, you don't like 'em?

52
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,240
It's just sometimes,

53
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,920
it feels like you're showing me off.

54
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,080
Well, what's wrong with that?

55
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,360
You're beautiful. Mmm.

56
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,920
And you're gonna be the new
Mrs Tony Towers.

57
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,280
People are interested in what I do.

58
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,000
But we're gonna have a family.

59
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,880
We... we're gonna what?

60
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,280
Well, not right now.

61
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,680
Oh, Jesus Christ.

62
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,040
Well, at least I thought we were.

63
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,000
No, right now's probably not
the perfect... what?

64
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,640
You know I wanna have ten kids.

65
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,960
Christ! Are we having a family
or playing five-a-side?

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,680
And I wanna live in Norfolk.

67
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,160
Oooh, that's a commute.

68
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,960
And I want us to wear chunky
jumpers and drink soup.

69
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,240
Now that we can do.

70
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,920
I'll be two minutes.

71
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,680
Honestly, I'm not going anywhere.

72
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,080
I'll be here.

73
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,840
Oh, Sue, sorry.
D'you- d'you mind sitting here?

74
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,000
I just-

75
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,680
don't like going backwards.

76
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,480
Yeah.

77
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,760
Only for you.

78
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,160
Mwah.

79
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,280
Right, champagne for everyone!

80
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,040
Merry Christmas.

81
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,240
Tickets?

82
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,800
I'm just nipping to the buffet.

83
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,040
Oh, good for you,
where's your ticket?

84
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,440
Really?

85
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,200
I'm only gonna be two...

86
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,720
..what?

87
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,760
There was-I had...

88
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,240
My fiancée must have them.

89
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,440
Oh, your fiancée.

90
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,160
Yeah, we're tying the knot in June.

91
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,400
Congratulations.
Look, I'm...

92
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,680
..I'm Tony Towers.

93
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,800
Good for you.
Now where's your ticket?

94
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,120
I'm famous.

95
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,320
Are you now?

96
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Tell him who I am.

97
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,880
You what?
She'll tell you who I am.

98
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,120
I recognise ya.

99
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,240
See?

100
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,600
Are you a carpet fitter?

101
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,520
What?

102
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,840
No, you sell shammies on
Bulwell market!

103
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
No! I'm... No!

104
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,160
I'm- I'm Tony Towers!

105
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,120
The Astoria in Nottingham!

106
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,080
The what?
What's that phrase,

107
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,800
'you're only famous
if someone knows who you are'.

108
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Well, we don't know who you are.

109
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,080
It's the biggest club in
the midlands.

110
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,320
Where is it again?

111
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,160
Listen, you like music, er...

112
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,960
..Morris. What-
what music d'you like?

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,600
I like metal.

114
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,800
You play metal at this club?
Not so much.

115
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,120
'Luton is your next stop.

116
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,400
Next stop, Luton.'
Look, she's waiting for me,

117
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,880
I- I just gotta get...

118
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,280
Look, my fiancée has never met
my brother or his wife.

119
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,080
She's nervous,
I just need two minutes

120
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,320
to get to the buffet.

121
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,320
Now, come on, Morris,
you're a reasonable man.

122
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,160
You've got tinsel on your head.

123
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,720
The full adult fare is
eighteen pounds ninety.

124
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,440
Really?
You're really gonna do thi-

125
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,520
Merry Christmas.

126
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,640
Sue, have you seen my tickets?

127
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,440
They were in my wallet...
Is that them?

128
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,040
Is that Roger?
No, he's ginger.

129
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,920
I can't find...
Ginger? How'd that happen?

130
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,960
That's them.

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
How did they know to
stand right there?

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,520
Yeah, well, that's Roger for you.

133
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,920
I can't get to the buffet
without the tickets.

134
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,040
Oh, Tony, I'm shaking.

135
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,560
It's fine, where are they?

136
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,680
Er, in your wallet?

137
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,080
No, I've looked there!

138
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,400
Are they in your bag?

139
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,840
You won't believe this, Sue.
There's a girl,

140
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,400
in the next carriage,

141
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,240
never heard of m- this is crazy!

142
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,680
I need them to get the bubbly!

143
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,560
Oh, Tony. Forget about
your silly champagne!

144
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,960
I'm freaking out here!

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,720
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,

146
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,800
I'm sorry. It's alright.

147
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,080
Shhh.

148
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,600
Everything alright?

149
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,880
What d'you mean?
I assume this is Sue.

150
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,680
Oh, I was just about to introduce...
Well, bit slow aren't you Tony?

151
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,520
I'm Paula.
Hello.

152
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,960
Roger's somewhere behind this.
Sorry.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,680
I wonder who bought you this?

154
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,960
Don't start. Lovely to meet you.
Shouldn't I put it next to

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,880
my present from Auntie Vi?
Oh, here we go.

156
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,360
Hang on a minute, I can't do that
because I've already packed it

157
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,920
right at the bottom of my suitcase.

158
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,520
You know about this?
No.

159
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,840
Tone seems to think that our Auntie
Vi always bought me better presents.

160
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,920
There hasn't been a single...
'Seems to think'?!

161
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,120
One year he gets a guitar.

162
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,960
I get a pineapple.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,560
It's hard to get back then.

164
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,160
Are you two going to sit down?
A pineapple.

165
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,560
Thirty years ago,

166
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,800
and he's still
going on about it.

167
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,400
Oh, sorry, Paula. I was-
d'you mind-

168
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,800
I was gonna be sitting there.
Tone, don't.

169
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,080
I don't like going backwards.
Just sit down.

170
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,880
Wow.

171
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,040
I like her already.

172
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,360
It's lovely jewellery.

173
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,880
Oh, thank you.

174
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,120
Been splashing out, Tone?

175
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,200
Well, things are certainly busy.

176
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,400
Got six new clubs opening.

177
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,400
Six?

178
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,920
He's got six new clubs opening.
Gotta be ambitious, Roger.

179
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,040
I've always told you that.

180
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,440
Six, though?
And we're upgrading Nottingham.

181
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,920
Ten thousand square feet,

182
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,080
five minutes from Market Square.

183
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,160
What about Gary De Courcey's place?

184
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,360
Gone.

185
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
What?
Fire.

186
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,400
Oh.
You're kidding.

187
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,480
I'm not.

188
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,640
Why's that so funny?

189
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,120
Well, nightclubs never 'burn down'.

190
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,360
It's always an insurance job.
Always.

191
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,040
Well, even with Gary gone,

192
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,680
I still think it's a bit much, Tone.

193
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,360
Well, if you beg me...

194
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,000
..I might just let you come back.

195
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,520
Aw.

196
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,800
Oh, no, no. That-
that's really not gonna happen Tony.

197
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,960
I'm very happy.

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,680
He's gonna try and convince you now
that he's still in show business.

199
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,760
I'm in the music business.

200
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Oh yeah?
Hardly.

201
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,920
What do you do, Roger?
Those headphones that broke

202
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,240
ten minutes after you bought 'em?
I work for Saisho.

203
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,800
Ask him what part of
Japan that's from.

204
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,880
It's Dixon's own brand-
Stevenage.

205
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,000
That well known suburb of Tokyo.
Listen, Tony.

206
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,160
When he stops selling five million
personal stereos a year,

207
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,520
he'll give you a call, alright?

208
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,760
Oh, oh, cheers, Sue!

209
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,200
Oh, what? It's funny.

210
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,760
I really like her.

211
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,600
Huh. Right, I'm getting that bubbly.
What?

212
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,240
He wants to celebrate
our engagement.

213
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,200
If only I could find the-

214
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,280
tickets.

215
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
You a bit strapped for cash, Tony?

216
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,120
Fine, thank you, Paula.
You're not gonna bail him out again,

217
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,720
are you?
It's OK, I'm good.

218
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,360
I don't quite know how
to put this, Sue.

219
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,160
But, er, you do know Tony
likes to tap people-

220
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,360
Paula, will you just...!

221
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,560
What?

222
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,320
You in a bit of trouble, Tone?
No, why?

223
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,200
You asked him to come back.
I didn't ask him.

224
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,920
Six clubs is a bit crazy.
I said if you begged me.

225
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,120
How much you borrowing?
It was gonna be eight clubs.

226
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,440
Rubbish.

227
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,240
I know this is hard for you
to accept, Roger.

228
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,400
But I'm doing perfectly
well without you.

229
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,640
I'm just concer-
Well, I don't need your concern.

230
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,160
I've managed to keep that club
going perfectly well

231
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,160
despite the fact
that you left me in the shit.

232
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,960
OK. Champagne.

233
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,520
Oh my God, it's Tony Towers.

234
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,680
It's not, is it?

235
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,960
He looks like a tramp!

236
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,800
Alright, girls?

237
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,440
Bye-bye.

238
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,920
What's going on?

239
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,160
You talk to him.
I'm not talking him.

240
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,160
I ain't talking to him!
You talk to him!

241
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,240
The buffet car- the bar.
Is it- is it this way?

242
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,720
I think he's had enough already.

243
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,680
Don't be shy, I don't bite!

244
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,240
Tony's a pervert!
Hey!

245
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,200
Come on, now! Let's all be nice.

246
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,280
Right, I'm- I'm Tony.

247
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,440
We know.

248
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,200
This happens to me all the time.
I get it.

249
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,840
I get it, it's exciting.

250
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,800
What?

251
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,160
She recognised ya,

252
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,520
I don't recognise ya.

253
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,160
She's quite a bit older than me.

254
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,280
Piss off.

255
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,440
There's only three years diff-

256
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,360
Now look what you made me do,
you silly cow.

257
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,800
Are we at thirty-two already?

258
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,280
Alright, alright.

259
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,880
Alright, listen, you two.

260
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,960
You have a good night, OK?

261
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,160
'Bedford.
Your next station stop is Bedford.'

262
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,320
'Hello?'

263
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,400
'Yeah, OK.'

264
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,760
'Nottingham.'

265
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,400
'Yeah, OK.'

266
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,920
'Five. Five o'clock.'

267
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,080
Yeah, OK.

268
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,720
Five, alright. Thank you.

269
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
'Bye.'

270
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

271
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,840
Oh, God!
Are you alright?

272
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,080
Mate, mate, are you alright?!

273
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,760
God, he looks like death warmed up.

274
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,920
It, it's OK Tony,
we're only having a bit of fun.

275
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,880
Yeah, we weren't taking
the piss, honest.

276
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,720
He was right.

277
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,280
Who- who was right?

278
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,640
Roger.

279
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,600
They all failed.

280
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,840
Alright, look.
I'll tell you what...

281
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,920
..um, everyone just back up, yeah?

282
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,640
Let's just give him some space.

283
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,960
You gonna be alright?

284
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,920
OK, OK. OK.

285
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,760
Slow it down, Tony. Slow it...

286
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,080
Alright.

287
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Think this through a minute.

288
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,120
Mate, come have a sit down.

289
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,000
This some sort of joke, is it?

290
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,360
Having a good laugh, are we?

291
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,400
Turn Tony Towers into a failure?

292
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,560
Oh, hilarious.

293
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,600
Well, you know what?

294
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,240
That ain't gonna happen.

295
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,880
Tony Towers don't fail.

296
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,480
Tony! You did it!

297
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,240
What did I tell ya!
Champagne all round!

298
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,920
Here y'are, have that.

299
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,840
Enjoy. Merry Christmas.

300
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,240
Am I not a man of my word?

301
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,000
Here y'are, have a box.

302
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,720
Listen, Tony.

303
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,880
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

304
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,480
It came out all wrong...
Come back.

305
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,560
What?
You're right. Six clubs is stupid.

306
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,920
I walked out, Tony.
You're what I need.

307
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,360
You're my- you're my Phil Spector.
You're my Tony Visconti.

308
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,880
That's very nice of you to say bu-
It'd be different this time.

309
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,120
Tell me what I did wrong.

310
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,240
You really want to know?
Yes.

311
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,000
You never gave me credit, for one.

312
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,960
You called it Tony Towers Astoria,

313
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,720
even though we agreed to call
it the Mighty Towers.

314
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,960
And you said we were
gonna go fifty-fifty.

315
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,400
I'll make it sixty-forty.

316
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,040
It's a different business now, Tony.

317
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,600
Foam parties, wet t-shirts,
it's- it's- it's not me.

318
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,480
If the clubs don't work,

319
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
that's it.

320
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,320
The house,

321
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,120
everything.

322
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,320
Look, let- let's not kid ourselves.

323
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,520
This was always your thing-

324
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,200
I'm serious, Rodge.

325
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,760
When you're there,

326
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,400
it works.

327
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,360
Just look at the business plan.

328
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
Sure.

329
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,600
But I can tell you right now
what I'm gonna say.

330
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,960
What?

331
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,480
Just open one new club.

332
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,720
Where you going?

333
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,040
I'll be back in a sec.

334
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,360
Anthony?

335
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,320
Auntie Vi!

336
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,600
Oh!

337
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,280
Come here, my dear.

338
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,600
How lovely to see you!
Oh!

339
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,920
Your mum said you might be
home for Christmas.

340
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,240
How you holding up?

341
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,560
Fine.

342
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,240
I was sorry to hear your news.

343
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
You were?

344
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
You must be devastated.

345
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
Sure.

346
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,400
Which parts...

347
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,720
..do you know?

348
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,400
Your mum told me everything.

349
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,920
She did?
Yes.

350
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,320
And what did- what did she say?

351
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,240
She said you were doing as well
as could be expected.

352
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,760
Well,

353
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,960
it's been...

354
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,520
..difficult.

355
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,600
Yes.

356
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,560
Have you spoken to...

357
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,440
To?

358
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,600
Anyone?

359
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,800
Like who?

360
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,760
Someone who could listen.

361
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,720
Not really.

362
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,160
Oh, you should.

363
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,680
I will.

364
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,560
I passed it, last week.

365
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,000
You did?
In a taxi.

366
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,720
Right, how is it?

367
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,680
It's horrible, Anthony.

368
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,640
I know.

369
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,360
All that work you put into it.
Yes.

370
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,080
And what with the recession
and that.

371
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,680
Right.
And now just gone.

372
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,080
Gone.

373
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,080
Did they ever find the cause?

374
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,240
The cause?

375
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,960
Electrics or...?

376
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Or?

377
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,680
Oh, I do hope someone didn't
start it on purpose.

378
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,800
Ah.

379
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,800
The fire.

380
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,040
Such a waste.

381
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,920
I mean, what are the chances of
both clubs going up like that?

382
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,200
Slim, yeah.

383
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,040
Oh,

384
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,000
your thing's going.

385
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
You don't deserve it, Anthony.

386
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,720
On top of everything else.

387
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,320
Everything else?

388
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,400
You know,

389
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,120
with Sue.

390
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,520
Sue?

391
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,840
That was very unfair.

392
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
She seemed so nice.

393
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,880
But that girl,
I think she had a plan all along.

394
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,000
Really?

395
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,600
I think some people see
an opportunity and take it.

396
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,120
You probably don't want to
hear this, Anthony.

397
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,880
But I've always thought you were a
little too trusting of people.

398
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,440
People take what they want

399
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,360
and then they disappear.

400
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,560
Just like that.

401
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,040
You need to think of yourself,
Tony.

402
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,760
About what you want.

403
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,880
Because nobody else is going to.

404
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,040
OK, I will.

405
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,520
I always said that to your brother.

406
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,880
Now I'm telling you.

407
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,960
Wait, is Roger on the train?

408
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,440
I doubt it.

409
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,040
Why?

410
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,200
He doesn't take the train anymore.

411
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
No?

412
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,600
Doesn't have the time.

413
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,200
Course.

414
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
'Cause he travels by...

415
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,760
Helicopter.

416
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,000
Mostly.

417
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,160
Course he does.

418
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,920
Sony keep him very busy.

419
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,600
Oh, I'm sure they do. Yeah, yeah.

420
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,280
Let me take a wild guess,

421
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,560
that one's for him?

422
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,440
What do you mean?

423
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,520
No, no, it's-

424
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,680
it's just a stupid joke
me and Roger used to make.

425
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,760
I was always convinced that
you got him better presents than me.

426
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,040
I'm sure
there's nothing in it.

427
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,360
I don't know if you
remember, but, er,

428
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,840
You got me a pineapple...

429
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,320
Auntie, wh-what's wrong?

430
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,240
I was never very good at
all that, Anthony.

431
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,680
I wasn't your mother.

432
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,080
It was only a present.

433
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,480
Just wasn't me.

434
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
It's fine!

435
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,600
I love pineapple.

436
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,920
Look, have a- have a tissue.

437
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,280
I'm sorry.

438
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,360
I was too scared.

439
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,880
Auntie!

440
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,040
Auntie Vi!

441
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,120
Scared of what-

442
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,800
♪Stop The Cavalry ♪

443
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,480
..limited range so
the songs had to be simple.

444
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,920
Tone Deaf Tony, I used to call him.

445
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,480
Tony, you never told me
you two had a band together.

446
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,080
Well, it was a very long time ago.

447
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,800
Sue, can I have wor-
Look what else I found.

448
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,640
Our first and only recording.

449
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,360
You had a single?!
Well, sort of.

450
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,840
It was this booth.

451
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,920
They had one at Waterloo station.

452
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,680
You had sixty-five seconds to
record anything you liked.

453
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,920
I suppose you could say this
is a limited edition.

454
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,040
Limited to one.

455
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,000
We thought we were a skiffle band!

456
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,240
I have no idea what that is.
Well, we weren't brilliant.

457
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,880
We had enthusiasm
and that's about it.

458
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,200
Speak for yourself.
And only four songs.

459
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,520
Four good songs.
Hmm.

460
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,360
Those the ones you tried to sing?

461
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,920
What d'you mean 'tried' to sing?

462
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,480
What, are you not into his music?

463
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,680
I like some of it.
Oh,

464
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,280
that's a ringing endorsement.
I like music from my own gen...

465
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,360
Oh, no, don't say it. Don't say it!
I like chart music.

466
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,480
This is what I'm dealing with.

467
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,480
That's not what I call music!

468
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,400
Sue, could I have a word?

469
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
Oh, yeah.

470
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,880
What is it? What's wrong?

471
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,000
Sue, what...

472
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,360
..why d'you like me?

473
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,720
Tony, what d'you mean?

474
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,320
Well, what, what are the things
that you like about me.

475
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,440
Everything.
Yeah, I'm, I'm serious.

476
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,880
What is it?

477
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,120
I'm fun, I'm- I'm successful.

478
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,000
Are you fishing for compliments?
No, no, no, no.

479
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,640
I just mean, you know, if,
if things were different, if,

480
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,720
if things...

481
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,480
..changed. If I changed...

482
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,320
Why? What's happened?
I lost all this.

483
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,840
Lets say I had nothing.

484
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,840
Are you trying to make out
like I'm shallow?

485
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,480
Not really.
Like all I care about is

486
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,600
jewellery and coats.
I just wanna know what you want.

487
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,120
Is that what you think of me?
To tell the truth, I hardly know ya.

488
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,760
Tony.

489
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,840
How can you say that?
We're getting married.

490
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,240
Do you know what that means?

491
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,360
Yeah, I've done it before.

492
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,040
And did you ask Linda
these questions?

493
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,200
No, because Linda and I should
never have got married.

494
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,960
We did it because we had to.

495
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,320
She thinks I ruined her life,
she's turned my son against me.

496
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,920
I haven't seen him for five years.

497
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,920
You haven't seen him for five years?
I know why he's angry.

498
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,920
I- I- I don't know what
Linda's told him.

499
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,400
What, she's lying to him?

500
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,920
Well...

501
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,320
..she, she, you know, she's-

502
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,160
she's probably embellishing it a bit.

503
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,200
Embellishing what?

504
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,280
Uh, when...

505
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,440
..you know what I'm like.

506
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,640
What the hell does that mean?
Was like. Was like.

507
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,360
I worked in nightclubs, Sue.
Things were...

508
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,480
What?

509
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,280
Exciting.

510
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,720
Hm.

511
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,040
You still work in nightclubs.

512
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm just telling you how it was,
I'm being honest.

513
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,320
You think I want that to happen
- again?
- I don't know Tony.

514
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,440
You tell me.
You've got six new clubs opening.

515
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,120
How 'exciting' is that gonna be?
They're all gonna fail, Sue.

516
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,520
What?
All of them.

517
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,160
And you're gonna end up married

518
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,160
to a loser, who's old, and broke.

519
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,360
So let me ask you again,

520
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,040
why d'you like me?
Tony, Tony, Tony.

521
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,480
I wouldn't blame you, Sue.
Tone.

522
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,320
You know what, if I fail-
Tony, I love you.

523
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,040
(And I want to marry you.

524
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,840
All this crap,
I don't want any of it.

525
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,120
Sell it, I don't care.

526
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,000
And you are not a loser.

527
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,640
And I'm here for you whatever,

528
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,560
whether it's a success or not.

529
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,880
But you have to promise me
one thing.

530
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,880
What?

531
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,880
All the excitement you need
is right here.

532
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,120
Get a room.

533
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,880
Now,

534
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,560
you make those clubs work.

535
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,600
But I need Roger.

536
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Well then persuade him.
Nah, it's too late for that.

537
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,160
I've tried.
Try harder.

538
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,400
There's gotta be a way.

539
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,960
I don't like going backwards.

540
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,040
You what?

541
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,400
Tony, where you going?

542
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,080
Girls?

543
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,360
♪ Carols singing

544
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,000
♪ Bells are ringing

545
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
♪ Santa Claus... ♪

546
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,720
Dad, it's your go.

547
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,240
Ugh, this game, it's taking
longer than the real War.

548
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Where've you been?

549
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,960
Even a Nazi has to take a leak,
Linda.

550
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,480
Dad, are you playing?!

551
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,760
Roger, can I have a word?

552
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,920
I'm in the middle of game.

553
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,680
For goodness sake, Tony. Can't you
see he's upset. Just roll the dice.

554
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,520
Seven.
Um.

555
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,920
Tony, that's my piece.
Can you not touch that?

556
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,560
Girls, d'you wanna take over?

557
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,640
Roger, have you got a sec?
No. Move!

558
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,720
No, Dad! Don't ruin it!

559
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,200
We don't want to play.

560
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,160
Dad, please.
Tony, you're gonna make him cry.

561
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,360
Can you please move.
OK, OK, OK. Um...

562
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,840
Dad, you're doing it wrong!

563
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,480
Jesus Christ, Tony.
What is the matter with you?

564
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,240
Tony!
Dad, no!

565
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,480
What?

566
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,040
Put him in solitary confinement.

567
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,360
Have I?
He's only ten.

568
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,480
You could've come after me.

569
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,040
Why d'you have to win at everything?

570
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,760
This game's stupid!

571
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,880
Oh, Sean!
Hey, hey, hey! I was just...

572
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,160
What, following orders?

573
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,480
We can play again!
Sorry,

574
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,040
I don't know why
he's acting like this.

575
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,240
Come on. Let's just
put everything back where it was.

576
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,720
No, Tony. You can't just put it back
and fix it, Tony. It's done.

577
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,400
I'm sorry, love.

578
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,640
I didn't realise. I-

579
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,400
honestly, I ma- I made a mistake.

580
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,720
Can we get that in writing?

581
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,560
What d'you want?
D'you want some sweets?

582
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,080
Some chocolate.

583
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,400
Yeah? Alr... er, fruit and nut?

584
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,520
Er, Marathon?

585
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,360
Er, a Wispa bar?

586
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,840
What the hell is a Wispa bar?

587
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,040
OK, what d'you like?

588
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,480
He likes Aztec bars, Tony.

589
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,280
But you wouldn't know
about that, would you?

590
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,200
Can you help me pick up the rest of
the German security guards

591
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,960
off the floor, Tone?

592
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,040
Here.

593
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,720
We could use a few of
these in the club.

594
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,840
Weekends, a lot of money in there.

595
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,880
Well, let's do it.

596
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,640
Really?
Just do it.

597
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,200
This is not like you.

598
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,080
I want you to take more control,
Rodge.

599
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,520
You what?
What?

600
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,640
What's brought this on?

601
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
Nothing.

602
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,920
Club's doing well,
that's down to Roger as much as me.

603
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,640
We're gonna be the new Tramps

604
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,120
before you know it.

605
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,840
So, it's time we, er,
we clarified a few things.

606
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,400
I want people to know Roger's name
as much as mine.

607
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,560
Hey, girls. You want your dad
to be famous, don't you?

608
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,320
Tony, what are you doing?

609
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,120
It's the Mighty Towers, Rodge.

610
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,160
What d'you reckon?

611
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,760
You serious?

612
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,040
Fifty fifty. I mean it.

613
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,520
We can shake on it now.

614
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,360
In front of everyone.

615
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,240
Yeah, go on then,
do it before he changes his mind.

616
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,400
OK.

617
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,600
Fifty fifty.

618
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,120
Bob on.

619
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,920
What are you up to, Tony?

620
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,600
Right, let's get that
Aztec bar then, shall we?

621
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,760
Does you do cobs?

622
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,440
Oh, you are kidding me.

623
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,960
You did do cobs, didn't you?
They do 'em on Southwest.

624
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,760
What about scotch eggs?

625
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,920
Eh?
I'll take whatever you've got, mate.

626
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,600
See I don't have no snap, see.

627
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,320
Oh, some change f' t' phone!

628
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,120
I'm dying to try it.
Please tell me I'm the first one.

629
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,920
It was originally designed
for the APT, but,

630
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,200
ha, we all know
what happened to that, don't we?

631
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,440
Even if we had had the advanced
passenger train,

632
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,480
it wouldn'ta made any difference
to me.

633
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,680
As it if was ever
gonna come to Nottingham!

634
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,160
Nottingham?

635
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,480
You're from Nottingham?

636
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,880
Take the lad out of Sneinton,

637
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,720
but you can't take the Sneinton...
What nightclub's are in Nottingham?

638
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,560
You what?
You know, big nightclubs?

639
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,640
It's not really my thing,
pal.

640
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,760
Er,

641
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
there's Gary De Courcey's place...
No.

642
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,160
The Astoria?

643
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,000
Roger Towers.

644
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,960
You mean Roger Towers Astoria?

645
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,720
The Mighty Ta-ta-ta-ta.

646
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,920
Funny ads, them.

647
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,960
I've never been, myself.
It's a massive place, apparently.

648
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,720
Actually, it's an old loco shed...

649
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,000
What about Tony?

650
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,200
Who?
Tony Towers.

651
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,680
His brother.

652
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,840
Has he got a brother?

653
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,720
'Your next station is
Wellingborough.

654
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Wellingborough is your next stop.'

655
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,000
I'll just have them
Mini Cheddars, and, er...

656
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,480
Can I have the rest of this in 10ps?

657
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Hello?

658
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,880
What?
I need to phone my wife.

659
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,240
Your wife?

660
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,320
Well, I don't really
want to ring my wife.

661
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,080
I just want to try the new phone.

662
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,120
The what?
That.

663
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,320
That's it, that's it.
I'll take as many as you've got.

664
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,160
Right, hold these.
Oh, hang on, I thought I was-

665
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,160
Right you have to keep
pumping them in, you ready?

666
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,880
Could I go next?
Sure. You ready?

667
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,040
Ready.
Oh,

668
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,040
one, eight, double one, eight, oh,

669
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,440
five, five.

670
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,680
Go!

671
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,080
Hello!
'Hello?'

672
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
Hello?

673
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,720
'Hello?'
Can you hear me?

674
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,000
'Hello?!'
Is that Mrs Taylor? One sec.

675
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,280
Keep putting them in!
'Hello?'

676
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,440
Mrs Taylor!

677
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,360
'Hello?'
Er, it's Tony.

678
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,840
'Who?'
Tony Towers.

679
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,000
Um, is Sue there?
'Who?'

680
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,600
Sue. Sue Taylor. My fiancée.

681
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,400
Come on, hurry up!
That's three quid already!

682
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,920
'Oh, Sue!'
Sue Taylor!

683
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,040
'Yeah, she's not called
Sue Taylor anymore, love.'

684
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,720
'She's Sue Pryce now.'

685
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,480
'Who is this?'

686
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,560
Hello?''

687
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,520
'Hello?'

688
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,200
'Who is this?'

689
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,400
Are you done?

690
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,040
Shall I stop?

691
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,240
She's not there, is she?

692
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,200
I've lost her.

693
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,760
We never meet.

694
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,760
You're mad! Don't do that!

695
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,120
You've gone mad!

696
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,160
I'll just have these Hula Hoops.

697
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,760
That's a Rumba bar.

698
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,440
He can't eat that, Tony.
It's got rum in it.

699
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,560
Is that true?

700
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,880
But I wanted an Aztec Bar.

701
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,760
He asks you for one thing.

702
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,360
Let me have a look what
I've got in my bag.

703
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,760
I'll have it if no one wants it.

704
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,880
Anyone?

705
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Get your own.

706
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,360
Tony!

707
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,520
I'm sorry, I didn't
know you wanted it.

708
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,880
Whoa.

709
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,240
Tony, what is the matter with you?

710
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,440
Dad!
Tony, stop it.

711
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,880
And this is mine, too!
Tony!

712
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Roger, I'm so sorry...

713
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,600
Anything else of mine you want?

714
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,440
Come on, pal. Y-you're tired.

715
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,480
You've had a big day.
I'm not tired!

716
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,400
And I don't need any help from you.

717
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,960
I thought we were gonna be partners?
You're nothing, Roger.

718
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,840
You're nothing without me.

719
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,520
You're a parasite. You just-

720
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,280
you just suck out all my good ideas.

721
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,160
Oh, I'm Tony Towers!

722
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,680
Not you! I'm Tony Towers!
Shhhh.

723
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,360
Tony, look at what you're doing.

724
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,800
Go and sell your crappy headphones.

725
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,280
What headphones? What you on about?

726
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,840
What have I done?
Oh, nothing. But you will.

727
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,360
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

728
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,640
Come on, girls. I think we should
go sit somewhere else.

729
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,080
No, no, Paula, Tony should go.

730
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,480
Oh yeah, that's what you'd like.
You what?

731
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,600
You're never gonna give me
another chance, are ya?

732
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,320
No, not when you're acting
like this. No.

733
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,360
Right, come on.

734
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,960
Doesn't matter how I act.

735
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,400
Doesn't matter what I say.

736
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,600
You've already
made your mind up about me!

737
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,960
And who's fault is that?
Sean.

738
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,400
You complicated this, Tony.

739
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,240
You did everything to ruin it.

740
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,320
Do you think I wanted this?

741
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,440
I never wanted any of this, Tony!

742
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,560
But the fact is, this is how it is.

743
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,400
And there is nothing we can do
to change that.

744
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,720
You want a bet?!

745
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,080
There you are.

746
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,960
Where did you go?

747
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,920
What?

748
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,360
What is it?

749
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,360
You deserve a happier life, Linda.

750
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,760
Tony?

751
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,760
Tony?

752
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
Tony, what are you doing?

753
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,600
Ugh, I might've known
you'd take that with out.

754
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,800
He never lets go of it.

755
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,080
You can't play it in the toilet.

756
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,600
That's the only place for it.

757
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,000
You know, don't think for a second
that granddad will play it.

758
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,240
Best put it away, son.
I mean, heaven forbid they find out

759
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,920
you spent your first wage packet
on a record you can't even play.

760
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,800
That was a solid
apprenticeship, Anthony.

761
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,200
You're not going to get
anything like that again.

762
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,560
Two pound a week before tax?

763
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,640
He wants to be a singer.

764
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,640
He what? You want to be a what?

765
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,160
Trust me, son. You've got many
talents. But you're no Mario Lanza.

766
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,400
Music's not a job.

767
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,440
You need a trade.

768
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,240
Well then why's he got a guitar?

769
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,080
Who? Who's got a what?

770
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,440
Why's Roger got a guitar
from Auntie Vi?

771
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,520
Don't spoil it for him.

772
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,720
It's not much of a mystery.

773
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,800
He's only ten!

774
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,160
He's ruined it, Mum!

775
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,800
You're upsetting him, Anthony.
Fine, I'll leave it then.

776
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,440
Next to... whatever that could be.

777
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,640
You know, I know for a fact that
present was very hard to come by.

778
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,640
Yeah. Brought her to tears.

779
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,720
What's that?

780
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,840
What's he talking about?

781
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,880
She cried when I asked her about it.

782
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,280
Said she was scared or something.

783
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,000
Sh-she did what?
When did you see Auntie Vi?

784
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,320
What did you ask her?

785
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,320
Why she gave Roger better presents.

786
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,120
You never asked her that?

787
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,520
When was this?

788
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,200
Why did she cry?

789
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,480
What?

790
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,320
Arthur, don't.

791
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,800
What's going on?

792
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,120
He is ten?
He's too young, Arthur.

793
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,440
What is it?
You just be quiet, mind.

794
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,160
There's something funny here.
You won't half catch it in a minute!

795
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,480
Mum, what is it?

796
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,520
Roger, darling.

797
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,080
There are things,

798
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,480
adult things,
things that we'll talk about

799
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,320
when you're a bit more grown up.

800
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,800
OK?

801
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,760
When?
When you're older.

802
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,400
Fifteen, sixteen.

803
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,160
About Auntie Vi?

804
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,280
Perhaps, but we'll talk
about it then.

805
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,320
About why she buys me nice presents?

806
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,640
Well, that's part of it.

807
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,280
But as I- as I say,
you'll just have to wait.

808
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,680
I can't wait.
Well you'll have to.

809
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,120
We're not talking about this
anymore.

810
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,440
But Mum-
Roger, we're not talking

811
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,920
about this now and that's final!

812
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,000
I think it's time, Celia.

813
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,920
Anthony,

814
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,520
wait in the corridor
a minute please.

815
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,320
Kettering!

816
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,880
Next stop is Kettering!

817
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,120
Kettering!

818
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,680
That's great!

819
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,360
Hang on.

820
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,680

Who wrote that?

852
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,360
He did. Er, no, we did.

853
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,200
It's beautiful.
Amazing.

Absolutely not.

I'm Ray Davies.

859
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,520
Yeah, and I'm Marc Bolan.
Who?

860
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,840
Yeah, come and have a seat.

Thank you.
Here you go. No worries.

Look at that. Look at that.

00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,480
Better than a Soho trattoria.

00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,880
Yeah, we're gonna need more plonk,
hang on a minute.

865

Oh, hey!

870
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,080

Oi, you, you'll get us chucked off.

00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,680
Here we go, girls.

875
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,960
Roger, you can't do that.

876
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,520
I do what I bloody well like.

877
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,440
Would Madame care for an aperitif?

878
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,000
Don't mind if I do.
Wah-hey!

879
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,520
Tony, are you done yet?
I could do with a hand.

880
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,200
Sorry, Valerie, do you wanna join us?

881
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,560
No, thank you, Roger.

882
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,960
Er, we got a bit carried away.

883
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,080
I can see that.

884
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,640
It's frightfully good here.
Yeah, I know it's terribly Chelsea.

885
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,080
Tony, I'm on my own here.

886
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,440
I need the loo
and Jenny's lost Perky.

887
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,320
Yeah, so you enjoy music,
I take it, yeah?

888
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,480
Who are those ladies?

889
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,400
That's a very good question, Jenny.

890
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,360
I think we'd all like to know.

891
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,000
Well, they're friends of Rogers.
You know what he's like.

892
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,520
I know what you're like.

893
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,320
Here you go,
have a little bit of this.

894
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,680
Mum!

895
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,520
Are you going to find her toy,
or what?

896
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,480
Look, I'm just, er- I'm gonna...

897
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,320
I'll be back.
Oh, what a dreadful shame.

898
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,680
How am I possibly going to
entertain these two on my own?

899
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,040
I'm sure you'll manage.

900
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,600
Listen to this, so-

901
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,160
This is what you were just singing?
Is Uncle Roger coming?

902
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,320
Yeah, er, but we were just
doing, let's sing-along.

903
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,920
No, your Uncle's busy.

904
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,240
♪ Out on the street

905
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,160
♪ Moving your feet

906
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,800
♪ Got the desire,

907
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,000
♪ Don't put out- ♪

908
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,000
Darling.

909
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,320
This guy,

910
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,280
I don't like this wimpy guy.

911
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,120
This interview is not good for you.

912
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,760
Don't talk to him, darling.

913
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,680
I get rid of him.

914
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,360
You, go now.

915
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,840
You change this train.

916
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,960
We hardly started.

917
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,480
No interview for you.

918
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,800
You don't like the single.
It's- it's not about what I like.

919
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,120
You think it's shit.
I like parts of it.

920
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,920
Why you compare us
to the bloody Vumbers?!

921
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,360
Vumbers?
Vumbers?

922
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,680
Vumbers.
What are Vumbers?

923
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,360
Vumbers? Vumbers.

924
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,680
V-v-vumbers?
Vumbers.

925
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,360
I'm sorry, I don't...
Vumbers. Vumbers!

926
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,600
Remember you a vumber!

927
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,120
Oh! Er, Wombles?

928
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,440
Ja! Vumbers!

929
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,560
You think I'm a Womble?!

930
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,680
I- I never said that!

931
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,800
He wrote it, I can check it.

932
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,360
Well, I- I don't write
the whole paper.

933
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,080
I'm not a Womble, mate!
Look, I know!

934
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,760
I know you wanna be
taken seriously, yeah.

935
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,600
But you've only had
novelty success so far.

936
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,160
We sold twice as many as
the Vumbers!

937
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,680
So, if- if you want credibility,

938
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,760
you're gonna have to talk
to the music press.

939
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,320
Ja, but you twist it!

940
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,640
I will not twist it! I just...

941
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,240
..I just want some answers that
make some sort of sense.

942
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,560
I can't use a word of this so far.

943
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,800
Tony is a genius.

944
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,400
Fine.

945
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,840
Then show me.

946
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,760
Tony.

947
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,800
Yeah.

948
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,840
We'll give you twenty minutes.

949
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,920
Good.

950
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,720
So, why don't you start

951
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,800
by helping me decipher
some of these song lyrics.

952
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,240
Let's start with the hit.

953
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,120
The hit?

954
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,600
Mmm. Eagles of Love.

955
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,600
Right.

956
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,840
Well, um,

957
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,320
originally it was called Sea-

958
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,400
Ow!

959
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,920
Ha! Bulls eye!

960
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,480
Bloody hell.

961
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,920
Roger! What the hell?!

962
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,480
What bollocks has he
been telling ya?

963
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,920
Nearly had me bleedin' head off.

964
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,160
Roger, you really lucky
not to kill him!

965
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,320
Ahh, pull your knickers out
your crack, Astrid. He's fine-

966
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,080
Hey, don't talk to her like that.

967
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,520
Roger, you sit next door.
Tony's doing his interview.

968
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,880
No, no.
He's got enough credit already.

969
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,160
What does that mean?
Like you don't know.

970
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,240
You feel Tony doesn't
speak for the band?

971
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,600
Course I don't!

972
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,440
This thing running?
Yeah.

973
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,680
Whoa, careful.

974
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,600
Roger...
Come on, Rodge. Come on now.

975
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,160
No, what, why? You getting
nervous, are we, Tony?

976
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,920
Worried your secret might come out?

977
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,280
Whoops! Oooh, ooh, naughty Roger!

978
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,400
Slap on the wrist!

979
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,200
Go and sit on the naughty step!
Maybe we should do this later.

980
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,120
That's what you'd like, isn't it?
Roger, mate.

981
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,120
Honestly, I don't know what
you're talking about.

982
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,840
Oohh, playing it like that, are we?

983
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,840
Roger, I'm not doing anything!
Yeah!

984
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,480
That's exactly the
problem right there!

985
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,320
I don't understand.
Too right!

986
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,760
So you're saying Tony's not involved
much in terms of creativity?

987
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,720
This twat couldn't play
the wobble board.

988
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,560
You stop this interview now.
No, no, no, no.

989
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,000
It's, it's alright, it's alright.
I wanna hear it.

990
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,000
Whatever's wrong, Roger,

991
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,520
we can sort it out.

992
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,160
Yeah, not with a tape recorder!

993
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,240
You my shrink now?

994
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,080
You're upset. I can see that.

995
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,240
What is it?

996
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,320
You really want to open that
can of worms, Tone?

997
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,200
Cos you know what's inside.

998
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,800
What?

999
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,960
Another can,

1000
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,320
'brother'.

1001
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,920
I just...

1002
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,240
..I just wanna make this work,
Rodge.

1003
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,080
That's all I want.

1004
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,800
OK, fine.

1005
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,280
Let's do it!

1006
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,520
Let's get into it.
First, we need champagne.

1007
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,400
No, Roger. No more with the booze.

1008
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,440
Hey, you. Mr Pastry.

1009
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,760
Champagne for the whole carriage!
Come on, that's too much, Rodge.

1010
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,640
See how nervous he gets at
the sight of money.

1011
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,400
Ask him why he
lives in Guernsey.

1012
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,240
I live in Guernsey?
Ninety percent, I pay!

1013
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,240
I'd be surprised if he pays two bob!

1014
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,080
We find another day,
we do this after Christmas.

1015
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,280
No, Astrid!

1016
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,800
We do this now!

1017
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,520
That's just rude, Rodge.
Come on, you're not like this!

1018
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,920
This isn't you!

1019
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,560
You don't know the first thing
about what I'm like.

1020
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,520
Have a question, chief?

1021
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,080
Um, well, there's, er,
there's been some, er- er,

1022
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,000
uncertainty, rumours, actually...
Oh?!

1023
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,280
..here, about the band.
Ooh!

1024
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,200
Regarding your performances, um...
Yeah!

1025
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,800
..you- you've had many
TV appearances.

1026
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,240
Top of the Pops, Crackerjack,

1027
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,920
and so forth.
Crackerjack, yeah.

1028
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,160
Um, but there wasn't any
mention of the band ever

1029
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,400
singing live.

1030
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,680
Ohhh!

1031
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,240
Wonder why that is?!

1032
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,680
Why do you think that is, Tone?

1033
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,080
Tony's voice is very delicate.

1034
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,560
Oh, that's right. That's right.

1035
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,160
Tony's voice is so delicate-

1036
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,200
write it down.

1037
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,720
It's so unique to have Tony's style,

1038
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,560
Tony's charisma,

1039
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,640
and Tony's singing voice
all in one amazing package.

1040
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,760
I mean, imagine if
I could sing, for example.

1041
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,280
That just wouldn't work, would it?

1042
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,000
Who'd want to listen to
a boring twat like me?!

1043
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,120
OK, that's enough now.
But Tony,

1044
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,680
Tony has it all.

1045
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,800
Go on Tony...

1046
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,520
..give us a little tune.

1047
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,320
I'm sure we'd all like to hear it.

1048
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,080
Wait, you can't do that.

1049
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,400
Oh, it's alright, Astrid.
He won't use the tape.

1050
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,720
Of course I'm gonna use the tape.
Trust me, he won't.

1051
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,800
How do you know?

1052
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,040
Where's he going?

1053
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,720
Is he saying what I think
he's saying?

1054
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,200
Definitely not.

1055
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,520
Well, what-
what d'you think he's saying?

1056
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,400
I suppose,

1057
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,840
he's suggesting...

1058
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,320
..that it's not
actually you that's singing.

1059
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,640
What the-

1060
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,120
Oh my God!

1061
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,520
Champagne for everyone!

1062
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,720
And?

1063
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,120
Tony, are you with us?

1064
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,120
Eh?

1065
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,840
Is there something wrong?

1066
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,520
I, um...

1067
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,200
Well, just start from the top.

1068
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,240
From what?

1069
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,880
You say,

1070
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,040
"Well, I've had an
absolutely delightful trip..."

1071
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,800
Well, I've had an absolutely
delightful trip.

1072
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,240
Lovely!

1073
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,800
Walking forward.

1074
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,680
Carry on!

1075
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,640
And thanks to the advanced
passenger train's unique design...

1076
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,720
Wiggling the model...

1077
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,920
You what?

1078
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,480
Oh! Um...

1079
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,600
Er, we've been travelling at
an average speed of 100mph.

1080
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,960
Then to the breakfast table.

1081
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,880
And sit.

1082
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:42,600
Er, but my coffee cup

1083
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,360
hasn't spilt a drop.

1084
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,760
And you go to take a drink.

1085
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,240
Er, but don't take a drink.

1086
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,400
What?
Yeah.

1087
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,120
And that's the basic shape of it.

1088
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,360
Tristan, I'm just, er, wondering if
Tony's shorts are bit short.

1089
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,320
Er, Tony. Er, we've got to
make a little change.

1090
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,120
Bernard!

1091
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,000
I don't know whose idea it was to
sit you opposite Bella Emberg.

1092
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,560
You come with me, my dear.

1093
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,200
I think I've found a
perfect spot for you.

1094
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,160
I don't suppose you have this
problem with radio!

1095
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,160
Anyway, I think you're going to be
very pleased with the replacement.

1096
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,200
I'm so excited!

1097
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,200
Yeah, so am I.
I was only planning to watch,

1098
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,760
I promise you.
It's OK.

1099
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,200
Look, I'm shaking.

1100
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,520
Hold my hand, please.

1101
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,880
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

1102
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,640
So, what we doing after this?

1103
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,800
What d'you mean?

1104
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,840
Well, everyone's talking
about going to your club.

1105
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,160
Sure.

1106
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,880
So that's me going home then?

1107
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,080
Why?

1108
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,920
Well, you're not gonna
let me in, are ya?

1109
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,000
Course I will!

1110
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,840
Really?
Yeah!

1111
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,080
Really?!
Yeah!

1112
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,960
Thank you so much!

1113
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,280
Sorry, Tony. Just wondering if
the shorts are a bit short?

1114
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,440
Um... I don't know,

1115
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,760
d'you think they look alright?

1116
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,480
Well, they just look a bit... short.

1117
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,040
I think they look great.

1118
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,320
Yeah, OK.
D'you think?

1119
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,320
They're better than the ones
you had in the other ad.

1120
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,640
Listen, Tony.

1121
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,480
Er, we need to make an incy
wincey change to the script.

1122
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,000
That bit about the APT
travelling faster

1123
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,520
than twice the legal limit of a car
on a motorway...

1124
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,920
..well, sandy pointed out, might not
be appropriate given recent events?

1125
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,480
Recent events?
And with a date set

1126
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,840
for the court case,

1127
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,040
it's probably best to avoid
any potential overlap.

1128
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,120
How d'you mean?

1129
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,240
Obviously we all wish your
brother the very best...

1130
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,360
Roger?
..we can't in any way

1131
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,160
associate this campaign
with what happened.

1132
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,920
I'm sure you'll understand.

1133
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,720
We'll just snip that bit out,
shall we?

1134
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,960
OK. OK.

1135
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,600
What- what... what happened?

1136
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,080
'Your next station
is Market Harborough.

1137
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,240
Market Harborough your next stop.'

1138
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,200
Are you OK?

1139
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,880
What, er, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1140
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,440
You're taking it all very well.

1141
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,840
I don't know what's going on.

1142
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,880
None of us do.

1143
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,200
I love you.

1144
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,560
What?

1145
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,320
I love you, Dad.

1146
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,600
Whoa. Whoa.

1147
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1148
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,760
Whoa.
Er, To-To-To-Tony.

1149
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,560
Is there something wrong?!

1150
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,720
I heard he was difficult.

1151
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,200
Widow Twankie?
What?

1152
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,280
You do realise this is bullshit?

1153
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,520
They better be paying you a shitload
cos you look like a knobhead, Tone.

1154
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,080
Sorry to say it, but it's true.

1155
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,000
You're a serious artist, mate.

1156
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,840
Not Danny La bloody Rue.

1157
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,000
What we need to do is
get back out there.

1158
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,720
Get some of the old
material released.

1159
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,360
We recorded some gems back then.

1160
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,920
There's this guy I knew, right.

1161
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,120
Alan, his name is.

1162
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,400
Mainly does plumbing at the moment,
but he's proper loaded.

1163
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,480
I told him about the music
we did together

1164
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,080
and he said he might wanna
release some of it.

1165
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,800
Just gotta get all of the
shitting master tapes.

1166
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,320
Anyway, point is,

1167
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,280
Alan's not gonna take us seriously

1168
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,600
if you're twanking off
in crap like this.

1169
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,040
What's that on your leg?

1170
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,640
Oh. Ha. That.

1171
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,160
That's a pain in the arse,
that's what that is.

1172
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,800
Why do they have to make
these things so ugly?

1173
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,040
Pattie made an amazing cover
that said,

1174
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,560
"An hard act to follow"...

1175
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:44,200
but, the probation officer said it
interfered with the signal.

1176
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,640
Mum's installed a base
station over Christmas.

1177
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,880
Just another thing that's
freaking her out.

1178
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,760
I mean, she's an old woman, Tone.

1179
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,040
She doesn't need all this.

1180
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,480
Is she OK?

1181
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,000
Course not, and all this
bollocks they've been saying.

1182
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,040
It's the last thing she needs.

1183
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,080
Like what?

1184
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,000
That I went to rehab.

1185
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,200
So what?

1186
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,120
It's boring, everyone goes
to rehab these days.

1187
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,280
So I sacked it off
and did it myself.

1188
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,440
So did Pattie.
Piece of piss eighteen months.

1189
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,280
Cheers. Done. Move on. What's next?

1190
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,920
Anyway, you heard about
the festival?

1191
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,120
Er, what?

1192
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,720
We're doing a festival this
summer. Well, maybe next summer.

1193
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,360
Anyway, we got a line-up planned.
You wouldn't believe.

1194
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,400
So...

1195
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,560
..how old was Hendrix when he died?

1196
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,560
Er, twenty-seven.

1197
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,600
Exactly. Joplin.

1198
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,000
Brian Jones.

1199
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,200
Jim Morrison.

1200
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,320
Buddy Holly.

1201
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,880
I don't think Buddy Holly was...

1202
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,240
Kurt Cobain.

1203
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,840
Who?
We get bands.

1204
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,520
Good bands. You know, bands we like.

1205
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,400
To pretend
they're twenty-seven again,

1206
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,640
and do a set, exactly as they
woulda done back then.

1207
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,440
Rick Wakeman in a gold cape.

1208
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,440
Peter Gabriel as a daffodil.

1209
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,400
Well, it was a sunflower.
Exactly.

1210
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,840
I'd pay to see that. Wouldn't you?

1211
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,960
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about, Tone.

1212
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,720
You move in these circles.

1213
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,760
I do?

1214
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,240
You're the one in here.

1215
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,120
They're all at these do's.

1216
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,880
So you want me to ask Peter Gabriel

1217
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,840
to dress up as a sunflower?

1218
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,240
Listen, if he hadn't done it before
it'd be weird, I grant ya.

1219
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,200
But it's probably
still in his wardrobe.

1220
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,720
Do I go to these sorts of parties?

1221
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,520
Course you do. Look.

1222
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,120
That's me with Christopher Biggins,
Roger.

1223
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,720
He's hardly Dylan.

1224
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,440
Biggins might even know
Dylan. Who knows.

1225
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,200
Point is, we get to these people,

1226
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,920
they hear the idea, they'll love it.

1227
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,800
But, well...

1228
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,960
What?

1229
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,720
You're not sort of suggesting...

1230
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,640
What?
Well...

1231
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,640
..you're not saying that
they shoulda died

1232
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,600
when they were twenty-seven?

1233
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,240
OK.

1234
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,000
Don't help me then, Tone.
Roger.

1235
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,720
Don't do it then,
Tone. Don't help me.

1236
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,680
You sit there, top of the world.

1237
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,640
Calm down, look-
Just need to get the ball rolling.

1238
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,920
I've had a few rough years, Tone.

1239
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,640
Dunno if you've noticed.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1240
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,920
Can't rely on your family.
OK, OK!

1241
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,280
Truth is Tone,
I'm not doing this for me.

1242
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,000
I'm doing it for our mum.
Well, your mum.

1243
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,080
Don't say that.
Well, it's true, in't it?!

1244
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,400
OK, OK! I'll do it! I'll do it.

1245
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,360
I'll do whatever you need.

1246
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,560
See.

1247
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,880
There you go.

1248
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,480
You just wait, Tone.

1249
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,920
This is just the beginning.

1250
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:36,440
Tell you what, we'll come see this
pile of twank after Christmas.

1251
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,640
Deal?
Mm.

1252
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,840
Deal.

1253
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,720
You know, you can get a
drink if you like.

1254
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,240
Don't bother us.

1255
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,480
Yeah, I might do that actually.

1256
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,200
Yeah.

1257
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,600
Knock yourself out.

1258
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,840
Cuz.

1259
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,080
Dad?

1260
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,480
Dad?

1261
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,920
You OK?

1262
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,520
I need to remember to
check the car insurance.

1263
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,360
Yeah, that's-

1264
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,960
probably a good idea.

1265
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,520
Take it easy. Eh, mate?

1266
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,640
That the actual hat?

1267
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,240
What?

1268
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,600
Well, the actual real hat.

1269
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,440
We watched every episode.

1270
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,800
You woulda won it.
Yeah, definitely.

1271
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,160
Will they let you go back?

1272
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,240
Of course they won't let
him go back.

1273
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,240
But, what about all that
work he's had done?

1274
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:55,320
It's taken twenty years
off ya, honestly.

1275
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,000
But no one will see it.

1276
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,560
You know, you surprised me, Dad.

1277
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,040
I did?
Yeah.

1278
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,000
It was quite a sacrifice.

1279
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,840
And a hell of a long way to come.

1280
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,240
We wouldn't have minded if
you stayed in Australia.

1281
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,240
What's Abi Titmuss really like?

1282
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,280
Who?

1283
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,320
Oh, yeah, like you didn't notice.

1284
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,360
Are we allowed to laugh, Mum?

1285
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,160
Yeah, of course you are, darling.

1286
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,840
This is a time for
happy memories too.

1287
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,640
Y-you put them on your page.

1288
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:32,240
David's doing a myspace page...

1289
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,320
..what d'you think?
Hmm?

1290
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,920
It's not loading properly.
Eh?

1291
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,000
Yeah, it's lovely, isn't it?

1292
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,080
Oh, it's marvellous.

1293
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,600
I wonder what she
woulda thought of it.

1294
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,880
She?

1295
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,200
Mum.

1296
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,360
Grandma.

1297
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,920
Well, you can ask her yourself.

1298
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,240
Huh?

1299
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,440
Grandma, what d'you think
of David's webpage?

1300
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,840
His what?

1301
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,000
He's, he's done a special page
on the internet for Roger.

1302
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,880
Well, it's no good to him now.

1303
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,000
Oh, no, it's about Roger.

1304
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,200
Oh, those things make my eyes hurt.

1305
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,640
Y-you can type a message, here.

1306
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,760
Why would I wanna do that?

1307
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,240
He's worked so hard on it.

1308
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,800
We worked as hard as we could
for Roger.

1309
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,320
Did everything we could.

1310
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,040
Maybe we could've done more.

1311
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,320
No, I mean the page on
the worldwide web.

1312
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,320
Maybe we did the wrong thing.

1313
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,120
I don't know.

1314
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,880
Come on, Celia. Let's get you
settled down here with Arthur.

1315
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,280
I'll always have to live with that.

1316
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,600
You have a little rest.

1317
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,440
And we'll be right over here
if you need anything.

1318
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,720
We shoulda kept it to ourselves.

1319
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,400
But Arthur said no.

1320
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,880
Thank you, love.

1321
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,920
I don't see why she blames herself

1322
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,320
Her mind's set. She still thinks
Roger didn't drink.

1323
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,960
Oh.
You what?

1324
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,280
Told her it was all lies.

1325
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,120
Yeah, then swigs vodka from a water
bottle right in front of her.

1326
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,200
Bold as brass.

1327
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,240
No.

1328
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,760
Was Pattie that fooled me.

1329
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,560
You know, I was sure she
was good news.

1330
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,240
She was as bad as him.

1331
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,880
You know she turned up
at my work once.

1332
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,000
Some sob story about
Roger beating her up.

1333
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,080
Complete nonsense.
I gave her sixty quid, didn't I?

1334
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:33,080
Turns out Roger's waiting
downstairs. Straight to the offy.

1335
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,400
And you were way too kind.

1336
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,440
Bad as she was though, when
those two split...

1337
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,560
Oh, that was a mistake.
Beginning of the end, that was.

1338
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,760
He never really got over it.

1339
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,240
Pattie this, Pattie that.

1340
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,760
He got it in his head that she was
in Portsmouth or something.

1341
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,360
That's where he was walking to?

1342
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,920
Yeah, right down the
middle of the M27.

1343
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,640
Oh, sorry.
Cleo!

1344
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,840
It was just horrible.

1345
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,840
I shoulda done something.

1346
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,360
No one coulda stopped him.

1347
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,400
He only listens to me.

1348
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,440
We were the Mighty Towers.

1349
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,320
It's not such a great name any more.

1350
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,160
Auntie Vi.

1351
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,560
They run in the street.

1352
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,080
Who can keep an eye on them
twenty-four hours a day?

1353
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,640
I'm not Celia.

1354
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,840
That's not me.

1355
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,840
I was too scared.

1356
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,280
Auntie.

1357
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,960
No. No.

1358
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,640
Come on, Tony, ya bellend.

1359
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,760
Listen, this fella from Gladiators.

1360
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,480
He must know people,

1361
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,960
that show's massive.

1362
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,240
You get me ten minutes with Wolf,

1363
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,440
just let me talk to him.

1364
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,240
Let me explain the concept
and you know-

1365
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,720
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1366
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,600
Enough of this, Roger!
Give that back!

1367
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,600
If you want water,
I'll get you water.

1368
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,200
'Leicester, your next stop.
Next stop, Leicester.'

1369
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,000
OK, you got me.

1370
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,040
What do you want, a medal?
No, I just want you

1371
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:38,440
to tell me something that's not a
steaming pile of horse shit, Roger.

1372
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,120
Eighteen months.
Eighteen minutes, more like!

1373
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,560
So I like a drink!

1374
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,200
So does Pattie, so do you!

1375
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,840
We all like a sip on a warm day.

1376
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:46,960
Social drinkers now!

1377
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,720
So what you hiding it
in that for then?!

1378
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,000
Cos I don't wanna drink the piss
this place sells.

1379
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,520
Oh, please, Roger.
Just stop! Stop it!

1380
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,680
This is me! This is Tony!
Don't pretend like you give a shit!

1381
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,720
Of course I do,

1382
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,880
I'm your brother, mate!
Not strictly true, that. Is it?

1383
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,120
It is to me.

1384
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,320
Come on, Pattie. Let's go.

1385
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,840
Where you going?

1386
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,080
Well, looks like Leicester.

1387
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,560
What about Mum and Dad?
It's Christmas tomorrow.

1388
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,400
For you maybe.

1389
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,120
It was never really Christmas
for me!

1390
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,400
Roger, come on. Come on, please.

1391
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,040
Please... I know where this goes!

1392
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,960
This doesn't end well!

1393
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,440
What does that mean?

1394
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,680
Roger, please.
Just, just let me help you.

1395
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,880
Oh, right.

1396
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,440
That's what you want, innit?
What?

1397
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,640
Make it all about you.

1398
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:35,200
Just like always.

1399
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,960
No, no, no, Rodge...
You never gave a shit about me.

1400
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,560
You don't understand.
You're thinking

1401
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,720
how well this makes you look!

1402
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,160
I can see you doing it now.

1403
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:45,000
"Tony saves Roger,"
"Tony the hero."

1404
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,680
Well guess what, Tony?

1405
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:51,160
I don't need saving.

1406
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,880
Rodge, please. Please, mate.
Get your hands off me!

1407
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,360
You don't understand!
Get off me!

1408
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,800
You don't understand, mate!

1409
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,080
What are you doing?!

1410
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,680
What are you doing?
Come on!

1411
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,560
Get off of me!
Rodge, no!

1412
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,640
Get off!

1413
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,800
Pattie, please! Talk to him!

1414
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,440
Fuck you, Tony.

1415
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:23,880
What?

1416
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,920
Roger!

1417
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,000
Rodge!

1418
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,200
Rodge!

1419
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,400
Roger!

1420
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,760
Tony! Tony.

1421
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,000
Listen, we're rather
up against it, old chap.

1422
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,320
We really need to get a move on.

1423
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,480
Where's Jenny? I need Jenny.

1424
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:21,080
Oh, but Tony, the train will be in
Nottingham in half an hour!

1425
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,200
Jenny!

1426
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,960
OK. Two minutes!

1427
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,160
Are you OK, Dad?

1428
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,360
Jenny, I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

1429
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,800
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

1430
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,560
I want you to answer like

1431
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,960
I don't know anything.

1432
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,600
What's this for?
Alright, just, please.

1433
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,160
Just, just pretend.

1434
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,600
Understand?

1435
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,800
I suppose.
OK.

1436
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,600
Where is Roger?

1437
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,880
He's on remand.

1438
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,040
Why?

1439
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:48,960
For speeding,

1440
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,240
you already know this.
What did I just say? Come on.

1441
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,480
So, is that it?

1442
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,520
Is anyone hurt?
No, no.

1443
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,720
That's not much of a crime, then.
Well, it wasn't his car.

1444
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,280
Oh.
It was his accountants.

1445
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,960
OK.
Who he'd just hit with a breadbin.

1446
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,320
Right, and why did he do that?

1447
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,640
Well, he thinks he conned him
out of eighty grand,

1448
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,720
but then you told me he spent all
his tax on a pig farm

1449
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,240
but he's not looking after them
properly and one ate his jacket-

1450
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,880
the silver one that
Mick Ronson lent him?

1451
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,000
And so he pushed the pig off a cliff
and now the RSPCA want him as well.

1452
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,400
Jesus Christ.

1453
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,160
Which is why you set up
that account for me.

1454
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,240
Yeah, I always put a third aside
and I never touch it.

1455
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,440
Very good, well done.
We've really got to get a move on,

1456
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,640
I'm terribly sorry.
Now, we've had a little conflab

1457
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,240
and we've come up with this and
we think it's much, much better.

1458
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,000
The APT is so smooth,

1459
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:36,120
the only rocking and rolling
I'll be doing is with these.

1460
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,440
Then you hold these up.

1461
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:43,760
Shall we do an availability
check on Bobby Davro?

1462
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,320
Roger, please.
There are children on this train.

1463
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,440
Mr Towers! Please put
your trousers back on!

1464
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,840
Tony, where the hell have you been?

1465
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,960
Roger...
..bloody crazy insane!

1466
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,040
Oh, Roger.

1467
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,720
Roger?

1468
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,080
Put your trousers on, mate.

1469
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,360
Mr Towers.

1470
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,160
Looks like you got an
actual story for once.

1471
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,920
This is all I could find.

1472
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,240
I'll call the transport police!
Maybe I should go.

1473
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,760
What? No, no, no. Give it here.

1474
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,920
I've got an idea, can you open this?

1475
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,280
But it stinks in there.
Yeah, just for a sec.

1476
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,800
You ready?

1477
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,320

The band's clearly a mess, right.

Whatever the record company
suggested we obviously...

I know, mate.

1498
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,360
So you wanna try again? Eh?

1499
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,360
Do it our way this time.

1500
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,680
We're too old.

1501
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,360
You know what Jim Morrison was
when he died-

1502
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,440
Yeah, he was twenty-seven. I know.
And Hendrix.

1503
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,720
So there's less competition!

1504
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,520
Who cares how old we are?

1505
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,000
Hey. Leonard Cohen.

1506
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,040
Yeah?

1507
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,840
He was ancient before anyone
started giving a toss.

1508
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,000
It's about what you do

1509
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,440
right now, Rodge.

1510
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,880
The decisions you make today.

1511
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,560
That's what matters.

1512
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,160
You serious?

1513
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,360
Course I am.

1514
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,680
You front it. You're the singer.

1515
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,440
I'll be on...

1516
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:24,520
.. maracas or whatever.

1517
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,200
But you gotta promise me one thing.

1518
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,320
What?

1519
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,880
You come and live in Guernsey.

1520
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:32,960
You what?

1521
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,640
You're giving away 90
pence of every pound.

1522
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,240
You choose now to give me

1523
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,600
financial advice?
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

1524
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,480
But we're gonna do this.

1525
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,880
Right?

1526
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,320
Sure.
Good!

1527
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,200
Right now,

1528
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,080
let me try and go
and sort out this mess.

1529
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,880
What the bloody hell is going on?
Just hang on.

1530
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,480
Well, will he do an interview?
Can I go?

1531
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:07,800
Everybody just hold your
horses for two minutes.

1532
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,040
Come here.

1533
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,480
Now look, er...

1534
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,040
..Morris, isn't it?

1535
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,120
Yeah.

1536
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,640
How long you been doing this?
Two weeks.

1537
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,880
OK. Listen.

1538
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,520
You know who I am?
You know who that is?

1539
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,920
I guess.

1540
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,600
D'you like our music?
Not really.

1541
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:27,560
No, you like metal. Don't you?

1542
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,040
Heavy rock.
How d'you know?

1543
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,960
I bet you like Sabbath.
Yeah, course.

1544
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,960
Perfect. D'you have any idea

1545
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,160
how hard they had to work to write
those songs?

1546
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,520
What's that got to do with..?
D'you know the artistic agony

1547
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:40,760
that Ozzy Osbourne went through to
make Sabbath bloody Sabbath?

1548
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,240
He ended up writing in a dungeon to
get inspiration, it half killed him.

1549
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,640
Ooh, the struggle.

1550
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:48,000
The pain.

1551
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,040
Some people don't make it.

1552
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,040
Nick Drake.

1553
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,400
Ian Curtis.

1554
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:56,600
Who?

1555
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,320
That's what that is, my friend.
That's the struggle.

1556
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,920
Right there.

1557
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:09,320
Now, you've handled this well.
I mean, brilliantly, actually.

1558
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,080
Now, play your cards right.

1559
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,160
You could be destined for big
things on the back of this.

1560
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,040
But just remember,

1561
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,400
you don't get
Children of the Grave...

1562
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,000
..without that.

1563
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,200
I love that song.

1564
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,840
Course you do. Now,

1565
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,840
you wanna support new music.

1566
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,440
You want another Sabbath album,

1567
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,880
that's Ozzy. Right there.

1568
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,400
So,

1569
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,000
how about you just let him
slip off at the next station.

1570
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,600
You know what I'm saying.

1571
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,880
No need to get the police involved.

1572
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,320
That way you're doing it
for the arts.

1573
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:47,200
You're doing it for the music.
You're doing it... for Ozzy.

1574
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,280
Paranoid. Wheels of
Confusion. Hand of Doom.

1575
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,080
Electric Funeral.

1576
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,400
Rat Salad.

1577
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:03,800
OK, folks. I want everyone
to move to the back.

1578
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,720
What the hell was that?

1579
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,160
It worked, didn't it?

1580
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,480
Keep it moving.

1581
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,520
'Loughborough is your next station.
Your next station is Loughborough.'

1582
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,640
Why aren't you in first class?

1583
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,360
You're Tony Towers.

1584
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,640
You shouldn't be
down here.

1585
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,160
Oh, can I ask you a question?

1586
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,200
OK.

1587
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,840

You know, holding the teas
made or whatever.

1589
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,200
How did they get that job?

1590
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:23,640
Cos it doesn't look that hard to me.

1591
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,520
I don't know. Um,

1592
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:28,880
I'm sure I could find out.

1593
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,040
Really? You could really do that?
Yeah.

1594
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,080
Oh, that's amazing.
I mean, Dolcis is alright.

1595
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,560
The people are nice and everything,

1596
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,000
but I don't wanna be there forever.

1597
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,080
Oh! I'm sorry, I'm Sue, by the way.

1598
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,840
So, we haven't met before.

1599
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,160
Not actually met.

1600
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,680
You made a joke about me once
in the audience though.

1601
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,400
Although, it could've
been about Elaine.

1602
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,080
The lights are very bright,
it was hard to tell.

1603
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,560
When was this?

1604
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,600
We came on a work do
to watch the show.

1605
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,800
God, there's a lot of waiting
around, isn't there?

1606
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,960
I mean, I'm not saying
it's boring or anything.

1607
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,440
It's just not like on telly.

1608
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,120
You must've shouted
"come on down!" about

1609
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,400
two hundred times.

1610
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,440
So, is that what I'm known for, then?

1611
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,560
You what?

1612
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,680
I'm not known for music?

1613
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,520
Music? What sort of music?

1614
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,480
Eagles of Love?

1615
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:23,760
What's that then?

1616
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,600
It's a song. In the charts.

1617
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,160
What? Recently?

1618
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,680
No, it's not on here.

1619
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,280
It was a hit. I think.

1620

Oh.

1658
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,600
I don't recognise him anymore.

1659
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,280
He, he used to sell those.

1660
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,960
You know, he- he had a wife.

1661
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,200
Two lovely kids, twins.

1662
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,440
I guess they don't exist anymore.

1663
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,840
Oh, I'm sorry. That's terrible.

1664
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,360

but...

..but not in the same way.

1666
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,440
It's all very confusing.

1667
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,640
Yeah, well,
families are complicated.

1668
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,440
Don't even get me
started on mine.

1669
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,280
I bloody dread this trip every year.

1670
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:31,120
We get to about, I don't know,
eleven o'clock on Christmas day

1671
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,320
and it all kicks off.

1672
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,120
I just stay quiet now.
Don't say anything.

1673
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,600
My new rule is,

1674
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,840
let people live their own lives.

1675
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,680

1676
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,640
Does that sound cruel?

1677
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,480
I suppose not.

1678
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,920
I mean, I'm there for 'em.

1679
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,720
Of course, if they want my help,
I'm there like that.

1680
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,400
It's family, but,

1681
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,680
they've gotta ask.

1682
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,640
I'm only there if they ask.

1683
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,720
Meanwhile, I get on with my life.

01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:17,800
Aaah.

1686
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,560
Good enough for an audition?

1687
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:25,200
Oh, that's very good. Very good.

1688
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,000
I...

1689
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:38,240
..am gonna write my number down.

1690
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,320
I'm still at my mum's till
I can get my own place.

1691
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,600
But if I'm not in
she'll take a message.

1692

Just, just give me five minutes.

01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:49,880
Too many of them is making
themselves cheap with them yanks.

1763
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,440
Well, they've got to give us
the place now, pre-fab or not.

1764
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,680
They said we'd need another
sixty points, see?

1765
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,000
I mean, it's just not right.

1766
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,560
It was a diabolical
liberty if you ask me.

1767
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,000
Why the deuce didn't they
check the ground before the match?

1768
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,680
And you're not one to
kick up a stink.

1769
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:11,640
Well, I was half inclined to think
it was some sort of practical joke.

1770
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:13,760
There's nothing funny about
stopping a test match.

1771
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,320
You only have one bottle?

1772
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,760
Er, just the one, yes.

1773
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,520
So I said to the chap from the Royal
Engineers, "Be a sport, old chap.

1774
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,120
At least let us see the innings out."
And d'you know what he did?

1775
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:26,640
He had the confounded impudence
to laugh in my face.

1776
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:30,120
You quite sure you won't stay up,
Vi?

1777
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,440
Just stay for Christmas?

1778
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,880
No, I'd rather get straight back.

1779
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:39,160
Closing up the dining car now,
chaps.

1780
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,720
Oh, here you are my dear.

1781
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,480
Oh, thank you.

1782
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:56,760
So I said, "I fail to see what's
so frightfully funny?"

1783
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,800
But he just gives me the brush off
and says,

1784
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:01,480
"hop it, before this thing blows."
I mean, really.

1785
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,680
Are you really trying to tell me
there's an unexploded bomb

1786
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:05,800
under the crease?!

1787
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,240
You can see the pitch?

1788
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,960
Of course, the wicket's right there.

1789
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:18,200
I- I just know I'll drop him or
lose him or do something wrong.

1790
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:19,840
I just can't.
Of course you won't.

1791
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:22,720
Look, it's for the best.

1792
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,880
So I- I stepped over
the boundary.

1793
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,400
Good show, old boy.

1794
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:30,360
Well, I said, "I didn't do my bit
in that lot to be treated like this."

1795
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,440
So what happened?

1796
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:33,280
Oh, it was a right old dust up.

1797
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:35,480
If it hadn't been for
'Dizzy' Henderson,

1798
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,440
heaven knows where I'd be.

1799
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:39,480
Cooling your heels in a
police cell, no doubt.

1800
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,400
That's Trent station.

1801
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:42,920
We'll be there in ten minutes.

1802
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:48,800
Perhaps I should take him now
and get ready and that.

1803
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,560
That's lovely, dear.

1804
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,640
Anthony, don't bother your Auntie.

1805
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,960
Surely Dick Pollard
would have hit the bomb by now.

1806
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,240
Exactly.

1807
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,200
If anything's going to blow it up
it's...

1808
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:08,200
Anthony! What on earth are you
doing? Get off!

1809
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:09,600
Don't be so silly.

1810
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,680
Hey, little Roger.

1811
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,760
Final destination,
Nottingham Victoria.

1812
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,240
Anthony!

1813
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,000
Oi! What are you doing?!
Get out of here!

1814
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,440
Come back here!

1815
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,440
Oi! Stop!

1816
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,840
Stop!

1817
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:36,480
Anthony!

1818
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:39,920
Is he alive?!

1819
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,320
He's just coming round.

1820
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,920
Why did you do that? You silly boy.

1821
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:51,840
Why did you do that?

1822
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:55,160
Don't ever do anything
like that again.

1823
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,440
I'm so- I'm sorry.

1824
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:59,880
Mummy's so sorry.

1825
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,320
You're safe now.

1826
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,040
You're safe now. Mummy's got ya.

1827
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,960
Mummy's got ya.

1828
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,640
We'll need to have a
look at that leg.

1829
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:39,600
There's room to lie him down
in the front carriage.

1830
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:40,840
Come on, son.

1831
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,440
Use your good leg.

1832
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,560
'This is your final stop.

1833
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:55,160
Nottingham Station where this
service will terminate.'

1834
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,160
