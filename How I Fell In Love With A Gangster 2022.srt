I love you.

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,920
If it weren't for the fact
I hide cash in three different places,

14
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,280
I couldn't even afford vodka.

-Fuck.

Thank you.

23
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,040
Change money?

24
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,800
You must have made a mistake.
I should have gotten more.

25
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,400
I'm not stupid, okay?

26
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,200

29
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,400
I had a deal with Inkblot
on currency and contraband.

30
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,680
Only under those terms
could you have this turf.

31
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,520
But you started selling cars
and beating up the locals.

32
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,200
The police came sniffing around,
and yesterday they took two of my men.

33
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,200
You either knock it off…

34
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,040
Or?

35
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,080

37
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,480
Did you understand what he said?

38
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,400
Not a word.

00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,120
Good day.

46
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,520
It's so nice to have a boss.

47
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,600
I'm proud of you.

48
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:49,160
Nikoś specialized
in the so-called "requested theft."

49
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:54,920
The idea is that an average German,
an ordinary German like me,

50
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,880
simply gives Nikoś his car.

51
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,600
<i>Nikoś legally transfers the car</i>
<i>to Poland, makes the key duplicates,</i>

52
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,880
<i>and acquires proper papers.</i>

53
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,960
<i>The keys then return to Germany,</i>

54
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,480
the German reports the car stolen

55
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,880
and receives his insurance money.

56
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,840
As well as a cut from Nikoś.

57
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,640
Everyone makes money.
Only the insurer loses.

58
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,040
Your cassette.

59
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,600
Thank you.

60
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,680
-It's a pleasure doing business with you.
-Yeah. Thanks.

61
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,120
Good day.

62
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,080
Can we talk?

63
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,440
Do you remember
our meeting eight years ago?

64
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,280
Hello.

65
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,720
Hello.

66
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,560
My dad doesn't speak German.
I'll translate.

67
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,000
It's astonishing
that you run a prospering business

68
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,720
without knowing the language.

69
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:36,080
You mean the incident in Budapest?
Let's forget it. I was there privately.

70
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,520
The institution I represent and I
are interested in what you're doing now.

71
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,720
-How old are you?
-Eight.

72
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,440
Tell your dad that after I lock him up,

73
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,560
you'll be 23 years old
when he gets out of prison.

74
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,520
We know the scope of your operation.

75
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,120
Thank you very much.

76
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,000
I see two options.

77
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,280
Either you cooperate with us

78
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,680
or we'll do everything
to put you behind bars.

79
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,480
Thank you very much.

80
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,320
Wouldn't you want
to see your children grow up?

81
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,920
Thank you very much.

82
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,560
Until we meet again.

83
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,640
FOR DEAR DAD

84
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:26,480
{\an8}Good evening.

{\an8}BORDER CROSSING

86
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,640
Anything in the trunk?

87
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:38,920
Get out.

88
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,160
Get out.

89
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,000
Hands on the roof of the car.

90
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,120
Nikoś didn't go to jail.

91
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,120
They just fined him.

92
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,680
And took away his passport.

93
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:19,840
How can you validate your stay in Germany?

94
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:26,680
By marrying a German.

95
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,920
-Hi, Nikoś.
-Hi.

96
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,320
What's wrong?

97
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:57,880
What?

98
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,040
I love you!

99
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,800
My gangster.

100
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,520
Aren't you eating too much?

101
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:42,480
Very good.

102
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,760
It's an honor to welcome you all here…

103
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,840
I do.

104
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,760

109
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,320
I love you--

110
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:48,040
-Good day.
-Name!

111
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,920
I spoke to the judge.

112
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:04,040
Car theft, driving under the influence,
and causing an accident.

113
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,920
That's 18 months to two years.

114
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:23,720
The prosecution also noticed
your alleged German roots.

115
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:55,800
At the border,
we seized two other stolen vehicles.

116
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,720
If your boys,
Michał Dolszewski or Paweł Kozłowski,

117
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,320
spill that it was you
who ordered the smuggling,

118
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,040
it will be worse.

119
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:10,240
I think we could rack up
a double-digit sentence.

120
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:16,640
Silvio is doing two years in Italy.

121
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:18,080
Nikoś!

122
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,680
It's over.

123
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,560
Accept my offer.

124
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,320
You might not get another one.

125
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,480
What are you… offering?

126
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,120
Get back.

Enough.

132
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,040
That's it.

133
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:07,080
Because of the suicides in your family
and your general condition,

134
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:12,600
you will spend the remainder
of your sentence in the psychiatric ward.

135
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:16,600
You'll get better there.

Good day.

01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:22,280
It can't go on like this.

141
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:32,720
This has to end.

142
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:20,520
What Nikoś has done
is inexcusable in my country.

143
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:24,520
My superiors are demanding his head,

144
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:27,360
and I'm going to bring it to them.

145
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,920
His face behind bars
must be on the front pages

146
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,680
of all the papers
that reported his escape from Tegel.

147
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,760
Any ideas, my colleague?
