confident in my role.

66
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:08,250
I had a web series,
and, you know,

67
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:10,375
to have a mentor
who's so selfless,

68
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:13,209

78
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:47,626

This is crazy.

79
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:50,459
<i>Nobody gets to do this.

done this before,</i>

80
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:51,667
<i>and they let us shoot here.</i>

81
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:53,667

<i>the characters

83
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:58,334
<i>Because of a props
mistake in season one,</i>

84
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:00,209
we just ended up
establishing them as that,

85
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:01,417
so, I was like, "Fuck!"

86
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,959
<i>But then,
we just went with it,</i>

87
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,667
so, no, I did not imagine
we'd be back here shooting,

88
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:07,834
<i>but when we came out
with the idea for a reunion,</i>

89
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:09,209
<i>it just made so much sense,</i>

90
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,834

for this season.

92

00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:20,834

<i>It's sort of picking up</i>
<i>from last season,</i>

<i>post Issa-Molly fight</i>

97
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:27,834

98
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,209
<i>Things are still
a little bit awkward,</i>

99
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:33,125
but you can tell they both want
to be back in that good place.

100
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,167
When I was at Stanford,

101
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,125
I was into theater because

102
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:39,959
I had been in plays
all of high school.

103
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:41,500
And then,
I was super into film

104
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:44,125
because of
"Love & Basketball,"
specifically.

105
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:46,042
I wasn't really
thinking about TV

106
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,834
because TV wasn't
really that poppin' then.

107
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:51,083
There just wasn't enough
representation then,

108
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:54,083
and there was nothing
on television that
made me feel like,

109
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:56,542
"Oh, I wanna make
what they're making."

110
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:58,667
I mean, I love "The Office,"
I love those kind of shows,

111
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,334
and, obviously, "Curb"
and, and "Seinfeld,"

112
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:02,083
and that's what
influenced me to try to write

113
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,834
television later on,

114
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:05,500
<i>but I never thought about</i>

115
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:09,042
<i>starring in my own TV show.</i>

116
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,209
(on computer):
<i>Stupid bitch nigga,</i>
<i>I hope you drown.</i>

117
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:16,125
<i>That'll turn my frown
upside down.</i>

118
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,167
Amy Gravitt:
<i>I first heard about Issa Rae,</i>

119
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,667
<i>the way a lot of people did,</i>

120
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:20,876
<i>seeing her web series.</i>

121
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,167
I think what she showed

122
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,751
in "Awkward Black Girl"

123
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:27,584
is something that we look
for in all of our shows,
which is...

124
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:31,959
we want the audience
to be able to recognize
themselves,

125
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,500
and on the comedy side,
specifically,

126
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,417
<i>we want them to be able
to laugh in recognition.</i>

127
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,417
<i>What Issa showed
was that she was willing
to put herself out there,</i>

128
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,667
<i>and mine her own
humanity for laughs.</i>

The development process with HBO

138
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,375
was long, but it was necessary.

139
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:05,626
<i>Issa had an initial
idea for the show,</i>

140
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:07,042
<i>we went into HBO,</i>

141
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,083
we pitched it
to Amy Gravitt
and Casey Bloys.

142
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,167
It was set
in the nonprofit world,

143
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,250
<i>and it was just
about my experiences,</i>

144
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:15,542
<i>and it still was,
kind of, similar</i>

145
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,709
<i>to "Awkward Black Girl,"
but I didn't wanna do</i>

146
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,626
<i>"Awkward Black Girl"
all over again.</i>

147
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,584
<i>And in doing that pitch,
I was nervous as fuck.</i>

148
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,500
I was reading off
of the paper in the meeting

149
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,542
because I'm not the type to be
able to just engage people,

150
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:28,000
and, "Oh, look at my show."

151
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,542
I was just like,
this is what it's 'bout to be.
This is it.

152
00:06:30,626 --> 00:06:31,709
They bought it in the room.

153
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,292
They said,
"Exciting. Let's do it."

154
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,626
And then,
we were in development,
probably, about

155
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:35,959
a year and a half, two years.

156
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:38,083
When I tell you,
comin' from the internet world,

157
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:39,834
I was like, "I can
make this shit right now.

158
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:41,000
Like, what is the problem?"

159
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,834
She had this notion
that she wanted to

160
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:45,125
do a workplace comedy.

161
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:47,375
<i>The idea was centered
much more around</i>

162
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:49,500
<i>what, ultimately,
became We Got Y'all.</i>

163
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:51,709
<i>We would meet
from time to time</i>

164
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:54,042
<i>as she was
developing the outline,</i>

165
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,250
and talk about the script,

166
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:56,667
but also, she would have

167
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:59,209
<i>these stories about
a friend of hers,</i>

168
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,751
<i>and I think, at one point,
she even showed us a text,</i>

169
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:04,751
<i>and it was in that moment
that Casey was like,</i>

170
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,000
<i>"That's the show.</i>

171
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,584
"It's you and your friend,

172
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,751
and the world around
both of you."

173
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:13,167
He did not sad face you.
I will slap you right--

174
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,792
Bish, what?

175
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:16,834
That's my life.

176
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:18,417
Issa:
<i>I got to rewriting,</i>

177
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,167
and then, I was also like,
"Ooh, fuck it."

178
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,459
Like, I'm puttin' all
elements of my life in here.

179
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:24,500
You hungry?

180
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:26,000
-Just--
-Take it!

181
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,959
Pop, pop, pop.
Pot pie.

182
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,709
So, I can say this
is rooted in authenticity,

183
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,042
<i>this is a real story.</i>

184
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,959
And that's when they were
like, "Okay, green light."

185
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:38,918
TT The Artist:
<i>♪ Welcome to the life</i>
<i>of the rich and the fly ♪</i>

186
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,500
Issa:
<i>I had to find a showrunner.</i>

187
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:42,375
<i>HBO sent a couple
people my way.</i>

188
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:43,918
Ashley Holland,
who is an agent,

189
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,834
was like, "You should
think about Prentice Penny."

190
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:47,292
First time we met in person

191
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,167
was when you came
to my book signing

192
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,876
-in Eso Won.
-Yes, Eso Won, yep.

193
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,626
Issa:
<i>And then, we ended up usin'</i>
<i>Eso Won so much for the show--</i>

194
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:55,250
-Yes, I wrote you a letter--
-Yeah.

195
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:57,834
to see like,
"Hey, this is what I thought
I would bring to it."

196
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:00,167
But I'm curious,
what was it like
to get the letter?

197
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,500
'Cause people don't
send each other, like,

198
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:03,209
-letters anymore for anything.
-Issa: No.

199
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:05,042
It went such a long way.

200
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,042
Obviously, I hadn't gotten
a letter from anybody,

201
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,542
and to see, like,
what you identify with

202
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:11,500
knowin' that, you know,
we were in the same area,

203
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:13,417
-knowin' that you had worked
in the nonprofit world.
-Right.

204
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,792
I was like,
"Oh, this guy seems to get it."

205
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:18,334
So, that letter,
by the time you came
to the book signing,

206
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,751
I was already like,
"Oh, this dude seems cool."

207
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:27,751
And I hadn't read shit
that you did until...
I had already said yes.

208
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:30,125
-'Cause I was just like,
"Oh yeah, he--"
-"He seems cool."

209
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,042
Which is almost how
we made every decision.

210
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,959
(laughing)

211
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:36,417
Director:
And camera, action!

212
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,709
The director process,
to find one, was soul-crushing.

213
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:42,626
HBO wanted someone,
uh, established,

214
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:45,083
and I think for them,
they wanted someone

215
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:46,250
who had a name.

216
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:48,250
And so, we found someone,

217
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:51,751
and they flew me to New York
to meet this director,

218
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:54,459
and after that meeting,
I was like,

219
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:56,042
"I don't think
he gets the show."

220
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,042
We had several other
directors who I was fans of,

221
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,918
but still didn't quite
get the show to me.

222
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,542
Casey was like,
"If you had to take a risk,
who would you want?"

223
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,500
And I was like,
"There's this director
I've been following,

224
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:09,250
<i>Melina Matsoukas,
who could be dope."</i>

225
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:12,667
People really didn't
give opportunities
to directors like me.

226
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,751
<i>I had done, primarily,
music videos and commercials,</i>

227
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:17,042
<i>and I had really
broken in that space,</i>

228
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,918
<i>but it didn't translate
to film and TV.</i>

229
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,584
<i>And so, I was offered
a lot of series that
I didn't relate to.</i>

230
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,792
When I read this,
I saw myself in the words,

231
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:26,709
<i>fell in love
with her on the page,</i>

232
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:29,125
<i>and then, I met her,
and I was like,
"She ain't so bad.</i>

233
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:30,292
Maybe we can collaborate."

234
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,667
We did a Skype meeting,
and it was terrible.

235
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:35,250
(chuckles)
It was like, "Girl",

236
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:37,792
"you knew that we've
been going and seeing
these other directors.

237
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,042
You ain't come prepared."

238
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:39,959
I was on the East Coast.

239
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:41,709
I was visiting my family,

240
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:44,459
and, you know,
the WiFi wasn't working.

241
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,751
It was just really
hard to connect.

242
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:49,459
I knew I liked them.
They weren't sure
if they liked me yet.

243
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:51,459
Her rep was like,
"What happened?
How did it go?"

244
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:53,167
And I was like,
"Bitch, what the fuck?
What happened?

245
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,667
Like, tell her to come correct."

246
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:56,792
And she was like,
"Let me get her another meeting.

247
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:57,918
I will prep her."

248
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,500
I watched every
comedy pilot possible,

249
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:03,667
<i>and I put together a real
treatment and pitch deck,</i>

250
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:04,959
<i>and I brought it with me,</i>

251
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,834
<i>and that meeting
was phenomenal.</i>

252
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:08,959
It was everything.
She blew us all away,

253
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,876
and we knew that
she was the one.

254
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,375
Melina Matsoukas:
<i>When we were</i>
<i>creating the pilot,</i>

255
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:13,626
<i>I didn't really
think about it</i>

256
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,334
<i>as something that hadn't
been done before.</i>

257
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:17,417
<i>I just thought about it as</i>

258
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,792
<i>how I approach any project.</i>

259
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:20,000
I wanted to

260
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,000
really get inside
of who Issa Dee was,

261
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,542
<i>what influenced her,
and who she spoke to and for,</i>

262
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,834
<i>and I wanted everything
to feel really authentic
to that character.</i>

263
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:32,709
So, do y'all have any questions?

264
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,626
Don't be shy, guys.
Fire away.

265
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:35,959
When she was editing,

266
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,000
she called me up, and said,
"Hey, would you come down,

267
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,125
"and watch my cut
before I show them?

268
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:41,834
I just want to get
someone else's feedback."

269
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:43,667
<i>And she played it back for me,</i>

270
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:46,167
<i>and I'll never forget this,
but I watched that cut,</i>

271
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,959
I got... really emotional,

272
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,417
and it was almost--
I was silent.

273
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,792
And she was like, "Ya hate it."
And I was like...

274
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:53,626
"No, I think they're
gonna love it."

275
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:55,667
It was the first time I realized

276
00:10:55,751 --> 00:10:57,542
how important a show
like this could be,

277
00:10:57,626 --> 00:11:02,334
<i>and how... I hadn't seen
a Black woman represented
in that way.</i>

278
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:03,834
<i>The show was
gonna be a success.</i>

279
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:06,000
Like, I knew--
I was like, there is no way

280
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,834
people can see this
beautifully crafted pilot,

281
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:12,250
beautifully shot,
beautifully acted,

282
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:15,500
and the humanity in the comedy,
and the relatability,

283
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:18,292
and how could you not give
a show like this a chance?

284
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,792
<i>And, um, you know,
legend has it that, uh,</i>

285
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:23,083
<i>when they turned in the edit,
and we got a series pickup,</i>

286
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,209
it was, supposedly,
like one of the fastest

287
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:28,417
pickups in HBO's history,
and I think that shows just

288
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,209
how much work and love
and, and energy

289
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:32,834
was really put into
getting that pilot right.

290
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:34,375
It's my fault,
okay.

291
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:35,292
I'm sorry, guys.

Look at us...

lookin' like

301
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:55,792
(all laughing)

302
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:57,584
Amanda Seales:
I just remember,
the first audition,

303
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,292
I had went in
for jalapeño poppers.

304
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,459
-Tasha.
-Amanda: For Tasha.

305
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:04,542
<i>The description said
"hood hot."</i>

306
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:07,500
And I was like,
"I am not hood hot,"

307
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:08,834
'cause you have
to know your strengths,

308
00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:10,626
and I'm shaped
like an iPhone,

309
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:12,083
sleek lines and rounded edges,

310
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:15,792
so I knew that
I wasn't going to...
get cast in that role.

311
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,417
So, I went in,
and I was like,
"Vickie,

312
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,042
I'm never gonna book this.
Is there anything else?"

313
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,459
And she was like,
"What else we
got back there?"

314
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,292
And she's like,
"Oh, they got early 30s.

315
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,626
Ivy League graduate."
And I was like,
"That's my life!"

316
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,209
Speaker:
Sophomore year,
you hooked up with that chick

317
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:27,417
that looked like Lisa Turtle.

318
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,375
That's different.
See, with women,

319
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,667
we can hook up with each other,
and we're not considered gay.

320
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,834
It's different for men.

321
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,167
So, my very first audition
with Vickie was like,

322
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,125
"How come I don't know you?"
I was like, "'Cause it's L.A.,

323
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:39,334
"and nobody knows
a little Black girl like me

324
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,667
who don't have
no agent, no nothing."

325
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:43,000
After it was done,
she was like,

326
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,626
"You're good... You're good."

327
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,334
And she really
kind of stepped up

328
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,667
every time she came
back to audition.

329
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,500
You'd give her a note,
she'd take it.

330
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:53,500
<i>She was like a diamond that
you just needed to, kind of,</i>

331
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:54,459
<i>shine a little bit.</i>

332
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,000
"Sorry, but I'm not looking

333
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,584
for a relationship..."

334
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:58,626
Sad face.

335
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:00,250
The fourth one,
that was like,

336
00:13:00,334 --> 00:13:03,959
"Oh, if y'all don't want me."
(laughs)

337
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,792
That's how I felt
walkin' down...

338
00:13:05,876 --> 00:13:08,876
Rodeo Drive and Beverly.
I think I skipped--

339
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:12,876
It was the scene
where we had...

340
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,292
the fight in the car,

341
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,209
and I added the like,
okay, the slam lock is on,

342
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:19,083
and, like, I just--
I couldn't get out.

343
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,000
I was like,
I'mma, I'mma do it.
I'mma go for it,

344
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,667
and I was like,
"Open this damn door!"

345
00:13:23,751 --> 00:13:24,834
Muthafucka, open the door!

346
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:26,584
-The child lock's on.
-Shut the fuck up!

347
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:27,876
Yvonne Orji:
<i>They were like,</i>
<i>"Ah, that's funny."</i>

348
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,292
<i>I was like,
"Oh, that was a choice."</i>

349
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,792
Didn't know how
this was gonna go,
so I felt

350
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,042
really good after that.

351
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,834
Between audition
three and four,

352
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:36,209
it was between paying
my cell phone bill,

353
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:38,250
and getting
a private coach.

354
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:41,083
And I was like...
"I'mma have to get
this private coach."

355
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:44,375
If I get the job,
I hope they can
contact me another way

356
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,459
'cause Sprint is dead, okay?

357
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm the only one on the show

358
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:51,459
that's been a director,
cast member, and writer,

359
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:52,709
<i>and it's been incredible.</i>

360
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:55,000
Natasha went from

361
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,250
being a writer
in the room
to being Kelli

362
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,417
<i>in a very specific way.</i>

363
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,209
A lot of times,
we'll read it as a room

364
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:02,584
to kind of see,
like, how does it feel.

365
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:05,626
She just read Kelli so great,

366
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:08,918
that we couldn't imagine
anybody else being as funny

367
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,918
<i>as Natasha was being Kelli.</i>

368
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,083
You ever see
"Lock Up Abroad"?

369
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,876
-The gon' lock a broad up.
-(laughing)

370
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,042
Oh god, a favorite Kelli line.

371
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,375
<i>That is so hard.</i>

372
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,000
<i>I improvise so much,
so sometimes</i>

373
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,709
<i>I don't remember
what's an actual line,</i>

374
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:23,876
<i>or something I've said,</i>

375
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,918
<i>or something I've said
never made the air.</i>

376
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,125
I do like,
"Remember me different."

377
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:33,125
Only because I say that
in my, my real life

378
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:34,292
all the time.

379
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,959
Fuck it!
You said Beyoncé.

380
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,459
(electricity zapping)

381
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:41,959
Remember me different.

382
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:43,459
Just like, don't look
at me doing this.

383
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,000
And I also love,

384
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,834
"You know what that is?"

385
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:47,959
Growth.

386
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:48,918
You a big girl.

387
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,083
Issa:
<i>You know, we wanted to make</i>

388
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,209
-a good--
-Prentice: Yeah.

389
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:52,792
-show at the end of the day.
-Prentice: Yeah.

390
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:54,500
And I remember,
I was talkin' to Jonathan,

391
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:55,751
we were wrapping,
and he was like,

392
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,500
"You know this never works."

393
00:14:57,584 --> 00:14:59,125
He was like,
"You know, like a creator,

394
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,959
"and a showrunner
who come together,

395
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:03,209
there's always,
like, a power play."

396
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:04,918
I, I feel like
the first time that you

397
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,709
bucked up, and then,
bucked up is the wrong word

398
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:08,667
was just in the depiction
of, of Lawrence.

399
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:10,250
-Mm-hm.
-That, that made
such a difference.

400
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:12,209
-He could've been written
in such a different way--
-Right.

401
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:15,500
-if we didn't have, like,
your perspective, your as a man.
-Yeah.

402
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:18,876
-(laughing)
-As a man, what he not gon' do.

403
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,959
I actually
heard about "Insecure"--

404
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:24,209
I'mma give
this brother a shout-out.

405
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:25,834
Clarence Hammond
calls me one day,

406
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:27,876
and he was like,
"Yo, have you
heard of 'Insecure'?"

407
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,334
And I was like,
"No, what's that?"
And he was like,

408
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,459
"It's Issa Rae's
new pilot at HBO,

409
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:33,083
"and it just got greenlit.
You should read it.

410
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,000
There's a character
in there you're perfect for."

411
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,500
And now mind you,
I read the script,
and I'm,

412
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:40,959
<i>literally, thinking
he's talkin' about
Daniel, not Lawrence.</i>

413
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,626
<i>Lawrence is sittin'
on the couch,</i>

414
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,167
<i>he's eatin' cereal,
he forgot his girl's birthday.</i>

415
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,834
You know, I'm just
gettin' my shit together.

416
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:49,417
You've been gettin'
your shit together for
four years, Lawrence.

417
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,375
In no way in my mind
did I think that this dude

418
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:55,459
was talkin' about Lawrence bein'
the perfect character for me.

419
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:59,292
And I remember walkin' in,
and I did Lawrence first.

420
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,542
<i>My shoulders were,
kind of like hunched over,</i>

421
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,000
<i>very didn't want to be there,</i>

422
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,209
<i>but I felt like that's where
Lawrence was in his head,</i>

423
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:06,959
and then, I remember I,
like, put my sides down,

424
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:09,626
turned around,
and I was like, "Bam!"
Like, "Let's do this."

425
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:12,459
And, like, all of a sudden,
was like a whole new person

426
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:13,500
<i>to do Daniel.</i>

427
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:14,876
I was like,
"Oh, I booked that."

428
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,334
<i>Three weeks later,
I get a phone call,</i>

429
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,000
<i>and they're like,
"Hey, they wanna test you</i>

430
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,000
<i>-on 'Insecure.'"</i>
-All right, cool.

431
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,584
But I never asked my rep
what character they wanted
to test me on,

432
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:27,209
so I actually thought
I was going to read
for Daniel again.

433
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:29,751
And then, found out that
I was going to do Lawrence.

434
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:33,584
-So, what're you sayin'?
-Issa:<i> I didn't think that</i>
<i>Lawrence would make it past</i>

435
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:37,417
the first season,
let alone the first episode.

436
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,250
<i>Jay Ellis is so great.
Like I think about
"Breaking Bad."</i>

437
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,959
Jesse wasn't supposed
to be a main character.

438
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:44,334
<i>It was supposed
to just follow Walt,</i>

439
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:45,959
<i>and Jesse is,
obviously, the show,</i>

440
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,584
<i>and I think about
that with Jay Ellis.</i>

441
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:49,083
<i>Like he was just so phenomenal</i>

442
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:50,375
<i>that every single time
we'd break stories,</i>

443
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,334
<i>we'd wanna see what
Lawrence was doing.</i>

444
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:55,876
The hands-down moment
I knew the show was a success

445
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:57,876
was after our season finale.

446
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,918
I remember Prentice bein' like,

447
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,792
"Yo, the finale.
People gonna go crazy
when they see the finale."

448
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:04,792
And I read it,
and I was like,
"I don't think so.

449
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:06,792
"Like, it's, it's, it's
not that crazy of a ending.

450
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:08,918
Like what are
you talkin' about?"
But I read the ending,

451
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,334
<i>and realized I was
gonna be butt naked.</i>

452
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:14,417
(moaning)

453
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,292
Issa:
<i>When I logged onto Twitter,</i>
<i>just independent of anything,</i>

454
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,959
<i>saw people tweeting
about Issa and Lawrence.</i>

455
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,667
And I was like,
I'm not on the hashtag.

456
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,250
It was just--
My entire timeline was

457
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:28,083
people I followed
or people retweeting

458
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:29,709
arguing about these
two characters.

459
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:31,834
And I was like,
"This is incredible."
I'm getting chills now.

460
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,375
Like, they're just talkin'
about these characters,

461
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:35,626
<i>and they're invested
in these characters.</i>

462
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:36,751
<i>That was amazing.</i>

463
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:38,125
I didn't see it comin', man,

464
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:39,792
but it hit people in a way that,

465
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:42,042
still to this day,
I just don't know if I've seen

466
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,959
a sex scene hit people
like that before.

467
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:47,667
Issa:
<i>We wanted to celebrate</i>
<i>the bodies of men on this show</i>

468
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:50,584
in the way that they weren't
celebrated on other shows,

469
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:54,083
as opposed to the female body
'cause we've seen that before.

470
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:56,918
(indistinct chatter)

471
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,209
Prentice:
I like that wording.

472
00:17:58,292 --> 00:17:59,918
I did a interview
with a magazine, and--

473
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,042
Did I ever tell you this?

474
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,125
A woman asked me,
"Why...

475
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:05,250
"is the sex so
graphic on the show?

476
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,042
Is that the way
Black people do it?"

477
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,125
-(laughing)
-What?

478
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:11,834
Jay Ellis:
On God.

479
00:18:11,918 --> 00:18:13,751
-On--
-Amanda: A white woman?

480
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,709
Like, but what
kind of white?
Like, Euro white?

481
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:18,000
-Like, American white?
-Wade Allain-Marcus: Yeah,
you talkin' like Karen white?

482
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,626
-A Karen.
-Kendrick Sampson:
I, literally, just

483
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:20,834
told my family not to watch.

484
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:22,500
I tried to tell my family,
they said--

485
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:25,167
But you naked
half the time
on Instagram anyway.

486
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,876
-What's the issue?
-But it's my titties,
not my dick.

487
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,792
-Okay.
-Or like my ass.

488
00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:35,959
-Cue marker.
-Issa: Ahh!

489
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:39,083
-Hey.
-Hey, sorry, I, I wasn't
tryin' to scare you.

490
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:42,250
You know,
when you ended things,
I, I understood.

491
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:43,626
You know, I had
a son on the way,

492
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:44,959
and I was movin',
but...

493
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,375
things are different now.
I'm different now.

494
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,042
And... I would hate
to leave here tonight

495
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,626
knowin' that,
I don't know,

496
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:53,542
I could've said somethin'
and I didn't.

497
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:56,542
Or like I didn't...
fight hard enough for you.

498
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:58,542
(indistinct chatter)

499
00:18:58,626 --> 00:18:59,709
Issa:
That was passion!

500
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:02,042
I loved how you were,
were makin' that point.

501
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,125
I want to try a take where
time is of the essence,

502
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:06,709
-the whole conversation for you.
-Run it?

503
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:08,792
-Yeah, just, just run it
'cause you don't know--
-Okay.

504
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:10,667
-how much of a window
you, actually, have.
-Yeah.

505
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:13,167
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay? Cool.

506
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,584
Kendrick:
<i>Prentice is mad at me</i>
<i>'cause he's team Lawrence.</i>

507
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,334
It's very thinly veiled.
(chuckles)

508
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:21,000
<i>He be actin' like
he's unbiased,
but he's not.</i>

509
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,959
I'mma get it out of him.
I'm figurin' out what's
gonna go on in the finale.

510
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,292
I always rooted
for Issa and Lawrence.

511
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,375
<i>And then,
I honestly believe,
in season four,</i>

512
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:31,709
<i>I got to a point
where I was like,</i>

513
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:33,042
<i>"Yo, some things
just don't work out.</i>

514
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,334
<i>They tried and it didn't work."</i>

515
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:35,584
Going into season five,

516
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,500
I don't know if
I was team Lawrence.

517
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:41,209
<i>Early on in our conversations,
just breaking the stories,</i>

518
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:43,167
<i>Issa, the person, was like,</i>

519
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,709
"Issa, the character,
would be a dumb bitch
to stay with Lawrence."

520
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,959
But, throughout
breaking the season,

521
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:51,292
I think she started
to come around to,

522
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,667
"Well, does that
have to be the way?"

523
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:54,083
And as we started
breaking the season,

524
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:57,209
<i>Issa, the person,
also got on board</i>

525
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:59,542
<i>with that ending, too.</i>

526
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:02,250
Laura:<i> Last year,</i>
<i>once we did the episode</i>

527
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,459
where Lawrence and Issa have
the whole night together,

528
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:07,959
<i>we basically wrote an episode
about how they're soulmates,</i>

529
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,167
<i>and so, by the time we got
to this season, it's like,</i>

530
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,667
<i>we've told the world
that they're soulmates,</i>

531
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:13,667
<i>so they have
to end up together,
or we're</i>

532
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:15,834
<i>basically saying that
the protagonist of our show</i>

533
00:20:15,918 --> 00:20:17,459
doesn't deserve to be
with her soulmate.

534
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:18,876
<i>So, I think there, ultimately,</i>

535
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,292
<i>was no other way
to end the show.</i>

536
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,334
Tonight made me happy.

537
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:25,584
You make me happy.

538
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:27,792
When we first started as a room,

539
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:31,292
and we were talking about
Issa's arc as a character,

540
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:36,417
we actually talked a lot
about what it meant for her
to stay at We Got Y'all.

541
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,751
<i>There was something
really limiting about that,</i>

542
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:41,375
<i>and we we're just like,
"Why is she still here</i>

543
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:43,250
<i>"if she, herself,
has established</i>

544
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:44,918
that she don't wanna be here?"

545
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,792
And it makes me think
even her romantic arc.

546
00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:48,250
In the beginning,
we were like,

547
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:49,709
<i>"Oh, by the end of season one,</i>

548
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,375
<i>she's gonna kiss Daniel."</i>

549
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:55,000
And if our goal is to show
a Black woman who is flawed,

550
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,167
and a Black woman who isn't all,
like, you know, white suits,

551
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,709
red wine, no spills,

552
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:02,876
then we have to show her
make flawed decisions.

553
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,667
<i>And that means
quitting your job
without knowing</i>

554
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:06,000
<i>exactly what you're doing next.</i>

555
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,375
<i>That means fuckin' the dude,</i>

556
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:08,626
<i>not just kissin' the dude.</i>

557
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:10,000
<i>That means lying
to your partner,</i>

558
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,500
<i>and saying,
"I'm in this," and then,</i>

559
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:12,709
<i>turning around,
and, like,</i>

560
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,250
<i>talkin' to this guy
at your event.</i>

561
00:21:14,334 --> 00:21:15,709
<i>We were like,
"What are the bad things</i>

562
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:18,000
<i>"she can do that
she can correct from</i>

563
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,542
that make her more dynamic
and more believable
as a character?"

564
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:23,125
(downtempo music playing)

565
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:26,417
(indistinct chatter)

566
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,000
Prentice:
<i>One of the things</i>
<i>that I was looking for</i>

567
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:38,375
when I was assembling the room
was learning from the...

568
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:41,959
<i>certain way of things
I had been seeing
for the last seven years.</i>

569
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:46,083
I knew that I didn't
want repetitive voices.

570
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:48,042
<i>The thing is if--
"Oh, if I have a Black woman,</i>

571
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,584
<i>I don't need any
other Black women."</i>

572
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:52,459
<i>And no Black woman can speak
for all Black women, right?</i>

573
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:54,667
While the agents
were sending us

574
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:56,500
voices that felt like,

575
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:58,334
"Oh, I'm gonna send
you eight Issas."

576
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,834
<i>But I was like,
"I have Issa.</i>

577
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,125
<i>"I don't need eight Issas.</i>

578
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:03,417
I need something that's
gonna be contrary to Issa."

579
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Writing on "Insecure" has been
one of the most fulfilling
experiences of my life.

580
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:09,959
<i>It's the safest
I've ever felt in a room.</i>

581
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:11,417
<i>I never felt like...</i>

582
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,500
anything I pitched was
too stupid or, like, too bad.

583
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,250
I felt like
I could say anything.

584
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,667
<i>Every season of the show,</i>

585
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:19,459
<i>we just wanted to make
each other laugh,</i>

586
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:20,584
<i>and make Issa laugh,</i>

587
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,417
and it just, honestly, felt like

588
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,667
a conversation with friends

589
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:26,334
<i>where you happen to be
breaking plot at the same time.</i>

590
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:28,584
I always feel like you have
to let writers have lives.

591
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:31,167
<i>That's the tithe you have
to give to make a show.</i>

592
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,167
Otherwise, they're just
in a writers' room all the time.

593
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,751
Prentice did a lot to be like,
"Okay, on Fridays, we're
gonna have a happy hour.

594
00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:40,042
<i>We're going to have social
events on the weekends."
Like we went to Disneyland.</i>

595
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,542
We did things that made
us feel like friends,

596
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:44,125
and it just made us
better at our jobs

597
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:45,876
because we were
open and sharing,

598
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:48,167
<i>and, like, giving ourselves
to the content.</i>

599
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,000
I was very proud
of the rooms
that we assembled,

600
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,584
and I think it spoke
to the fact that

601
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,292
we didn't have a lot
of turnover in our room.

602
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:57,000
From the first three seasons
were all the same writers,

603
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,959
and then,
obviously as a blessing,

604
00:22:59,042 --> 00:23:00,459
those writers got
opportunities, right,

605
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:01,792
as a part of being on the show,

606
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:03,167
and then, we replenished with

607
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,918
four more amazing writers,
and those writers

608
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,125
stuck with us till the end.

609
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,667
Issa:
Good morning.

610
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:43,959
When Issa comes to me,
she goes on a vacation.

611
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:47,709
She's on some island right now.

612
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:50,500
I like early calls.

613
00:23:50,584 --> 00:23:54,542
Early calls mean
you get out earlier...
sometimes.

614
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:56,876
It's always great
to be able to work,

615
00:23:56,959 --> 00:24:00,292
and my thing is...
this always starts at the top,

616
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:04,083
and however the lead is,
is kinda what you get,

617
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:09,459
and, I have to say,
we doin' really good
over here with our lead.

618
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:10,959
I'm old-school.

619
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:14,792
I can go back
to working on "Martin."
(chuckles)

620
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:17,125
And I did
"The Bernie Mac Show."

621
00:24:17,209 --> 00:24:19,083
Been doin' this
for a minute,

622
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:22,000
but this is such
an amazing talent

623
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:25,542
because you're working
with younger, amazing

624
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:30,375
group of people that's taken
this industry to another level.

625
00:24:32,626 --> 00:24:34,626
With their creativeness,
you know?

626
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,709
I love that.

627
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:45,834
This is my time
to make love to the hair.

628
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,667
(laughing)

629
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:54,292
I always say that...
her hair and my hands
have a love affair, so.

630
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:58,292
(Issa speaking)

631
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,751
(Felicia laughs)
I love you, too.

632
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,167
You not gonna deny it? Wow.

633
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,792
I love you, too.

634
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:09,459
But this hair is everything.
It's my favorite.

635
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:12,542
Now, I found out about,
uh, "Awkward Black Girl"

636
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:16,083
because...
natural hair was emerging,

637
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:19,417
and, uh... at that time,
I was runnin' around

638
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,417
with Jill Scott who
really did help a lot of

639
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,500
people to look at natural
hair very differently.

640
00:25:26,584 --> 00:25:29,209
I remember people sayin',
"Have you seen
'Awkward Black Girl'?

641
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:31,209
You need to see it.
Her hair is natural."

642
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:33,918
I just remember a time
in history where

643
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,751
you would see a woman
with short hair or short afro,

644
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,500
and not really
think much about it,

645
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:41,209
but they made it
a really big deal...

646
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:44,500
that Issa had natural hair

647
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,083
and, um, and had cut it off.

648
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:49,834
You know, and talked
about that on her show.

649
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:53,125
So, I started watchin' it,
and I was like,
"Oh, this is good."

650
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:55,292
You know... I get it,

651
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,042
and then, every now and then,

652
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,334
I'll get these messages...

653
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:00,751
from women sayin'...

654
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:03,167
"I can't wait
for the next season

655
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,042
to see what you're
gonna do with the hair."

656
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:07,709
'Cause then I get
ideas for work

657
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:09,209
and goin' out,
and I'm like,

658
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:11,500
"Well, that's great
that you really are

659
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,834
"anticipating the next season,

660
00:26:13,918 --> 00:26:16,042
or the next episode
for the hair."

661
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:18,334
<i>When I look back
at all the photos...</i>

662
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:19,542
<i>that I've taken</i>

663
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:22,334
<i>of the hairstyles we've done,
it's like,</i>

664
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:24,918
<i>it's like
a thousand hairstyles.
It's crazy.</i>

665
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,334
<i>I do not plan
these styles, you guys.</i>

666
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:28,542
(Felicia laughs)

667
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:30,167
<i>They, literally, are</i>

668
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,083
<i>kinda like a creation between
Issa and I in the morning.</i>

669
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:35,334
<i>Sometimes, I have
an idea of what I want,</i>

670
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:37,876
<i>but once I see the wardrobe,
it could change.</i>

671
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:40,042
<i>Yeah, it's off the cuff.</i>

672
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,334
There's our superstar!

673
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:43,500
-Hey, I'm so glad
we're doing this.
-Issa: Me too.

674
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:48,000
Well... let me show you
what our brand partnership
looks like.

675
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,626
Brand perception and awareness
are both up significantly

676
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:55,375
coming off of the last
handful of events--

677
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:57,292
Melina:
<i>I didn't really</i>
<i>wanna make a comedy</i>

678
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,751
<i>that looked like
any other comedy.</i>

679
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:00,167
<i>Cinematically, I was like,</i>

680
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,542
<i>"I think we can push this,
and we can allow it to live</i>

681
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:05,709
<i>"in a different space
'cause it's a very
specific show,</i>

682
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,334
<i>and so, it should
have its own look."</i>

683
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,626
<i>Everything was kinda
based in authenticity,</i>

684
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:11,542
<i>and having it feel
as real as possible,</i>

685
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:15,334
<i>and lighting Black people
in a way that I was used to,</i>

686
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:17,209
<i>where we're like
celebrating their bodies,</i>

687
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:19,083
<i>and their skin,
and their joy.</i>

688
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:21,209
We were pretty
successful the first year.

689
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:23,083
<i>Second year,
Ava came on board,</i>

690
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:24,834
<i>and she came from indie film,</i>

691
00:27:24,918 --> 00:27:27,083
<i>and I really loved
her work and aesthetic.</i>

692
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:29,167
I already had strong ideas

693
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,459
on what I would do differently.

694
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:34,751
<i>I felt like there were
some missed opportunities,</i>

695
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:36,792
<i>visually, in terms
of how to incorporate</i>

696
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:39,500
<i>cinematography into
the DNA of the show.</i>

697
00:27:39,584 --> 00:27:42,417
<i>One of the things that I said
when I kinda went in there was,</i>

698
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,792
<i>"You're missing how
cool this show is.</i>

699
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:48,709
<i>"You're missing literal
color in people's skin,</i>

700
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,876
<i>in Los Angeles, the warmth,
the architecture."</i>

701
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:54,709
<i>I just wanted to feel
the environment more</i>

702
00:27:54,792 --> 00:27:56,792
in this visual storytelling.

703
00:27:56,876 --> 00:28:00,042
<i>I just think that "Insecure"
is more than just a comedy.</i>

704
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,584
<i>It's part of
a cultural movement.</i>

705
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:03,834
It's part of visual culture,

706
00:28:03,918 --> 00:28:05,709
and I just wanted it to be that,

707
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,167
to show up for that.

708
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,792
♪ ♪

709
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,292
(indistinct chatter)

710
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,584
Okay, so I want
everybody to look at me.

711
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:14,500

-Kendrick: Uh, yeah.

00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,709
Sorry, would you look at me?

716
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,042
(Prentice speaking)

717
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,209
-She looks good, right?
-(Prentice speaking)

718
00:28:26,292 --> 00:28:27,459
Did you tell her that?

719
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:29,375
I told her soon
as she got here.
I said, "You look--"

720
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:30,918
I said,
"You look beautiful."

721
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,626
-I'm gonna tell her again.
-Go for it.

722
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:34,792
I mean, I mean,
I love this floral.

723
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:36,375
Yvonne looks great.
Yvonne looks great,

724
00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:38,918
Issa looks great,
I think Issa's shoes
really set that outfit.

725
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,834
-I think... Huh?
-(Shiona speaking)

726
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:42,125
(Prentice speaking)

727
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:44,792
(laughing)

728
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:46,792
I guess costumes,
to me, is-is just like

729
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:48,959
cinematography which is
like production design, right?

730
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:50,459
There's a story in all of it.

731
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:53,125
<i>And I really believe in
how we tell a story visually.</i>

732
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:56,292
<i>The show is also about,
like, the diversity
of Black people and women.</i>

733
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:58,709
<i>Each person has to have
their own style,</i>

734
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:00,083
<i>and their own
sense of expression.</i>

735
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:01,459
You know your neck's
not long enough

736
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:02,584
for these turtlenecks?

737
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,667
Well, girl,
I'm exchangin' all these.

738
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:06,709
Condola got me meetin'
in all these fancy spots,

739
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,751
and I gotta rotate
my wardrobe to keep up.

740
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:10,751
Melina:
<i>I remember first</i>
<i>and second season,</i>

741
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:13,459
<i>we would have clothes,
but, you know, we had
limited budgets,</i>

742
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:14,709
and I remember
in the pilot, like,

743
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:16,500
Issa on stage,
that's my outfit.

744
00:29:16,584 --> 00:29:18,500
Wore that for New Year's
one year, and I was like,

745
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:19,459
"This is perfect."

746
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:21,209
-You love this.
-I love that.

747
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,417
Shiona Turini:
I think it's cute.

748
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,167
Woman:
And I think it
looks good on her.

749
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,709
Shiona: But then,
are we wasting it here?

750
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:27,167
-Well, it's never a waste.
-Yeah.

751
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,918
I loved this...
but with a different shirt.

752
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,500
Shiona:
<i>When I started at "Insecure,"</i>

753
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:34,626
<i>the aesthetics
of the main characters</i>

754
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:36,709
<i>were pretty much
already carved out,</i>

755
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:38,459
<i>which was a unique challenge</i>

756
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:40,792
<i>because I continued
that narrative,</i>

757
00:29:40,876 --> 00:29:44,375
<i>but added my own twist,
my own personal touch.</i>

758
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:46,626
<i>For Issa,
we elevated her
a little bit,</i>

759
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:49,083
<i>and that was
really exciting to see.</i>

760
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:51,250
<i>Diversity's always top of mind.</i>

761
00:29:51,334 --> 00:29:54,500
<i>In addition to just
the team that we hire,</i>

762
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:59,459
<i>we really try and focus
on using, and shooting,
and purchasing</i>

763
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:02,042
<i>designers of color,
Black women,</i>

764
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:05,250
<i>um, young
up-and-comers in L.A.,</i>

765
00:30:05,334 --> 00:30:07,959
<i>and that's a way
that we can support,</i>

766
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:12,375
<i>and support financially
just designers of color
within our community.</i>

767
00:30:12,459 --> 00:30:16,125
When it came to work
on episode 507 with Amy,

768
00:30:16,209 --> 00:30:19,000
<i>I pitched her the idea
of only featuring</i>

769
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:23,125
<i>Black female designers
on our principles.</i>

770
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:25,834
<i>I wanted to try and feature
Black female designers</i>

771
00:30:25,918 --> 00:30:28,083
<i>for, like, every aspect from</i>

772
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:29,792
<i>the earrings to the shoes</i>

773
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:31,834
<i>to, of course,
all of the clothing.</i>

774
00:30:31,918 --> 00:30:34,250
<i>She was really,
really up for it.</i>

775
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,542
It presented a lot
of different challenges,

776
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,751
but at the same time,
it really gave us an opportunity

777
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:42,209
to champion and support
Black female designers

778
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:44,667
in a way that we haven't
really done on the show.

779
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:47,417
We've, obviously, incorporated
them in different costumes,

780
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,042
but never a true focal point.

781
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,751
And I think it really played
into the story of these women

782
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:53,626
coming together,
one of the last times,

783
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:55,792
and supporting each other
as they are moving through

784
00:30:55,876 --> 00:31:01,083
the world and now moving
on to different experiences.

785
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,792
Amy Aniobi:
<i>I'm directing episode 507,</i>

786
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:04,042
which is called,
"Chillin', Okay?"

787
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:05,959
It's a really special episode

788
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:07,876
'cause it's all
the girls together

789
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,542
<i>almost the entire episode.</i>

790
00:31:09,626 --> 00:31:11,167
It's basically
one of these times,

791
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,876
like you're plannin'
to go out with your friends,

792
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,542
and then, you just
never make it out.

793
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:15,918
So, it's playback,
action, camera.

794
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,250
You start smoking,
and then, on action, Issa,

795
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,334
that's when you
deliver your line.

796
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:22,459
<i>I've been working
on "Insecure" since
the very beginning.</i>

797
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,209
I feel like I worked
on pre-"Insecure"

798
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:27,042
because I wrote for
"Misadventures of
Awkward Black Girl."

799
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:30,375
<i>"Insecure" is a show that
has really different</i>

800
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:32,751
<i>levels of directors,
and a lot of new talent.</i>

801
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:34,751
<i>And I had so many
friends ask me</i>

802
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:36,250
from season one, like,
"Are you gonna direct?"

803
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:38,626
And I was always like,
"Ooh, no. The show?
It's so hard."

804
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:41,209
<i>Really it was growing
as a producer on set,</i>

805
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:45,125
and supporting so many
different types of directors,
and seeing how they work.

806
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:48,083
I felt like, for four seasons,
I was shadowing directors.

807
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,667
Issa:
I'm not about to argue
with someone who went to

808
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:51,250
Scared Straight for high school.

809
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:52,792
(laughing)

810
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:56,209
-Kelli: I went there, too, so.
-All right, let's cut.

811
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:57,334
When I came to "Insecure,"

812
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:58,792
it was the first time
I'd been on a set

813
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:01,167
<i>where people of color
were at the top,</i>

814
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,667
<i>and the vibe on set,
and the people,</i>

815
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:05,000
it was diverse for real.

816
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,334
<i>It wasn't "PA diverse,"</i>

817
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:08,542
<i>it wasn't "one person
over here diverse."</i>

818
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,584
<i>It was diverse in all aspects.</i>

819
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:13,250
This is the first show
that I've ever been on where

820
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:16,334
when I get into a scout van,
which includes director,

821
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:18,876
<i>cinematographer,
assistant director,</i>

822
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,709
that I'm the only
white guy in the van.

823
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:22,792
<i>And that is the first
time in 30 years</i>

824
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:24,125
<i>that that's ever happened,</i>

825
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:25,959
and I'm not straight,

826
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:27,792
so there were no straight
white guys in the van.

827
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:30,626
Ava Berkofsky:
<i>I see a lot of women</i>
<i>in the camera department</i>

828
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:32,876
'cause I make it that way.

829
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:35,876
<i>This show has been all
about giving people that shot,</i>

830
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:39,459
<i>and I was given that shot,
and I want to give that shot
to other people.</i>

831
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,584
When it comes
to giving people chances,

832
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,459
people will show you
that they're ready,

833
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:45,292
and I just love
passionate people.

834
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:49,209
I love to be around people
who love to do the work,
who are about it.

835
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:52,042
That kind of tells you
all you need to know.

836
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,876
First time I met Issa was 2009,

837
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:56,125
Issa did this workshop.

838
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:57,918
I won the "Insecure"
On Set Contest

839
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,167
<i>that HBO put on.</i>

840
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,626
<i>At the end of 2016,</i>

841
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:02,709
the winners of the contest
got to move to LA,

842
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:05,000
and work on the show as set PAs.

843
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,167
Afterwards, I,
like, stood in line
to talk to her.

844
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,584
I'm like,
"Hey, you know,
I'm writing now."

845
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,250
I really hadn't had any
real eyes on my work yet.

846
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:12,542
I was so bold.

847
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:14,500
Even though I was PA-ing,
I tried to let people know,

848
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:16,626
"I'm a writer, and that's
what I'm trying to do,"

849
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:19,042
<i>talkin' to Issa whenever
I got an opportunity to do so.</i>

850
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:22,083
She read my pilot script,
and...

851
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,709
Kindsey Young:
<i>Issa personally emails me,</i>

852
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:26,417
<i>"and she was like,
"Hey Kindsey, not sure
what you're up to,</i>

853
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,751
<i>"but we, potentially,
have a spot opening up</i>

854
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:31,542
for writer's assistant
in the writers' room
if you're interested."

855
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:33,500
And I'm like,
"Duh, of course,
I'm interested."

856
00:33:33,584 --> 00:33:37,042
I dropped everything,
and I came to become
a showrunner's assistant,

857
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:39,918
and a writer's PA for
season one of "Insecure."

858
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,667
Now I'm a showrunner
of "Rap Shit" for HBO Max,

859
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:45,334
so, I mean, I don't know.
(laughs) It's crazy.

860
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:47,000
Prentice:
<i>Six years ago,</i>
<i>none of those people</i>

861
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,375
<i>had professional writing jobs,</i>

862
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:49,626
<i>and now they're showrunners</i>

863
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:51,000
<i>and writers on other shows.</i>

864
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,542
You know, I see how,
in five seasons,

865
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:56,459
we've given, uh, eight
first-time directors,

866
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:59,125
their, their opportunity
to direct their first
episode of TV.

867
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:03,584
I think seven...
I think seven writers
over the last five seasons,

868
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,459
go on to get
their own overall deals.

869
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:08,542
We've seen six of our writers
from these five seasons,

870
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:11,167
go on to become showrunners,
post-"Insecure."

871
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,959
You know,
we've hired and broken in

872
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:15,834
two costume designers,
a new DP to television,

873
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,209
and across the board,
you really do see growth.

874
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:21,042
That is a true testament
to their legacy,

875
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,626
and to the legacy of the show,
is that we always, always,

876
00:34:23,709 --> 00:34:28,459
always tried to open many doors
for as many people as possible.

877
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:31,626
Anthony Sims:
<i>So, I met Issa Rae</i>
<i>at a 7-Eleven, randomly,</i>

878
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:33,542
<i>years ago, before "Insecure."</i>

879
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:36,417
<i>We talked about Hollywood,
and what we each do.</i>

880
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,375
So, fast forward years later.
She's very successful.

881
00:34:39,459 --> 00:34:42,000
I have a wife and kids,
and I'm tryin' to figure out

882
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,042
the best way
to support my family.

883
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,709
I thought getting into a union

884
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,792
is probably one of
my best opportunities.

885
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:49,292
When COVID hit,
I was pretty discouraged,

886
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:50,709
didn't think it
was gonna happen.

887
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:52,292
So, I happened to work on a show

888
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,125
with one of the producers
from "Insecure."

889
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:57,500
I was wearing, I think,
an "Insecure" hoodie or a hat.

890
00:34:57,584 --> 00:34:59,626
And he asked and said,
"Oh, do you know Issa?"

891
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:02,667
Like, "Do you work on the show?"
And I said, you know, "I do."

892
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:05,000
Was tellin' her about how
hard it is to get into a union,

893
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:07,834
and she said to me,
"There's always a way."

894
00:35:07,918 --> 00:35:09,459
Let me see what I can do.
If I can get you on the show,

895
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:12,125
and help count towards
your days, like,
that's a win, right?

896
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:14,375
And it's also
a win for inclusion,

897
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:17,918
and making sure that, again,
this show is continuing to

898
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,125
create opportunities.

899
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:22,459
Uh, fast forward a few months
and I got a call.

900
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:25,876
<i>It worked out.
This show means
so much to me.</i>

901
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,459
<i>It's helpin' me
take care of my family.</i>

902
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,626
<i>I can go home,
and look at my wife,
and she's proud of me.</i>

903
00:35:31,876 --> 00:35:36,042
(smooth R&B playing)

904
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:46,667
Amber Haley:
<i>We were told at the beginning</i>
<i>of this season</i>

905
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:49,083
that we were going to have
an art walk in this area,

906
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:52,667
and so, that we
should look for artists
in Crenshaw and Inglewood,

907
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,334
Black artists in particular.

908
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:56,000
Kay Lee:<i> Creatively,</i>
<i>to put this all together,</i>

909
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:58,000
<i>took a good three weeks,</i>

910
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:00,334
but to really, physically,
put it together,

911
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:01,459
we did it in two days.

912
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:04,125
Issa is very specific
in embracing

913
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:06,375
all the locations
that we've seen

914
00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:09,000
<i>in all five seasons
of "Insecure."</i>

915
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,584
If it wasn't gonna be
Leimert Park Plaza,
it wasn't gonna be--

916
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:13,792
There wasn't really an option.

917
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:17,250
(laughs) There wasn't
really an option.

918
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:20,209
Hey, look who's
over here shoppin'--

919
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:21,918
Kevin Bray:
<i>The Black Art Walk is</i>

920
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,292
<i>an event where Los Angelian
African-American artists</i>

921
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:26,626
<i>are able to show
off their work.</i>

922
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:28,459
And as with everything
Issa does,

923
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:30,876
there's a verisimilitude
that has to do with

924
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,626
what the real world is doing,

925
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:34,125
and what she's
doing in the show.

926
00:36:34,209 --> 00:36:37,042
<i>Her master plan was she
was gonna come down here,</i>

927
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,834
<i>and she was gonna
spend the money</i>

928
00:36:38,918 --> 00:36:40,959
<i>for us to be workin'
in this community.</i>

929
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:43,667
It ain't "Insecure" if we
don't have a block party,

930
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:47,125
if we don't have--
In the neighborhood
where the Blacks are.

931
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:49,292
(loud beeping)
Ooh... ooh. Hello?

932
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:50,876
I'm tryna shoot over here.

933
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,834
Oh, it's a black Yukon...
Suge Knight is comin' through.

934
00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:55,792
I don't know who's there,
but here we are.

935
00:36:55,876 --> 00:36:59,709
-I said, it's not "Insecure"
if we don't have a big--
-(speaker feedback)

936
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:03,334
Y'all didn't disrespect
other actresses like this.

937
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:05,959
-(rap music plays)
-Oh, oh, now it's a party.

938
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:08,834
You know what?
This is, this is why
we do what we do.

939
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:12,083
They said,
"Oh, the cameras is rolling?
We havin' a party."

940
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:15,500
(laughs)
I love it!

941
00:37:15,584 --> 00:37:19,083
So, you were saying,
how does it feel to be shooting
in a Black neighborhood?

942
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,334
(laughs)
This is, this is how it feels.

943
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:23,584
They're like,
"It's a cookout.
It's a party.

944
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:25,042
Well, we gon' get
in on it, too."

945
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:26,584
<i>I think that's
not only Issa Dee,</i>

946
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:28,417
<i>but Issa Rae's
desire and mission</i>

947
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,876
is to promote
the Black community,

948
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:32,417
especially, you know, one
where there's so much culture,

949
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,000
<i>and there's so much art,
and there's so much</i>

950
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,292
feeling here,
and that's what
"Insecure" does best.

951
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:38,125
<i>Like, we bring people
into this neighborhood,</i>

952
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:39,626
and we show how live it is.

953
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:42,083
It's not just
the Hollywood Hills
or Sunset Boulevard.

954
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:44,542
It's like,
"Yo, Inglewood, Leimert Park.

955
00:37:44,626 --> 00:37:46,125
We got stuff here, too."

956
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,500
Alex Burns:
<i>Three weeks ago,</i>

957
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:51,000
<i>we were shootin' down
in Manhattan Beach,</i>

958
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,542
and I happened to go down
this street called Hyde Park,

959
00:37:53,626 --> 00:37:56,417
<i>where The Dunes
apartment is located,</i>

960
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,626
and, literally, there was
three families takin' photos,

961
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:03,000
and we shot The Dunes
like season two or three,

962
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,584
<i>and people are still</i>

963
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:08,292
<i>goin' to The Dunes,
takin' photos of "Insecure."</i>

964
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:13,167
So, it has proven to be
a lot of positivity,

965
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,709
acceptance from this show.

966
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:18,834
<i>I'm extremely proud of Issa,
extremely proud.</i>

967
00:38:18,918 --> 00:38:21,334
It's wild to me
that The Dunes is
a cultural landmark,

968
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:24,709
<i>just 'cause you don't
think about those things
when you're filming.</i>

969
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:27,167
<i>We moved out of those
apartments by season two.</i>

970
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,500
I get tagged at least
three or four times a day,
and people in pictures,

971
00:38:30,584 --> 00:38:32,042
and I think it's
the dopest thing ever.

972
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:34,292
They treat it like
the Hollywood Sign.

973
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:37,626
You know,
when "Insecure" started,

974
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:39,334
I would say it was
like pulling teeth

975
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,834
because we were
really dead set on

976
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:43,959
creating a certain
authentic look to the show

977
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:46,959
that we realized,
workin' with older people
in this industry

978
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:50,834
who had been very
seasoned vets in their jobs,
weren't really used to.

979
00:38:50,918 --> 00:38:52,584
<i>We were askin' them
to go to neighborhoods</i>

980
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,334
<i>that other shows
didn't film in.</i>

981
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,417
<i>We were askin'
them to show us</i>

982
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,417
<i>locations that they
never even thought
about being filmed at.</i>

983
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,751
<i>We fought really hard for that.</i>

984
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:04,667
It's really refreshing
being able to show new places,

985
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:08,709
whether it's neighborhoods,

It's a little different
in South LA than other places.

the only reason why they
know my neighborhood is

1001
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:44,167

the riots started in the '90s.

1002
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,626

You know what I mean?
It's really dope.

1013
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,751

1020
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:28,000

off of someone

00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:30,000

1022
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:32,918

tryna drop my mail off.

1023
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,876
Super, super hood post office.

1024
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:36,834
And it was this dude
on the phone in a wifebeater

1025
00:40:36,918 --> 00:40:39,500
with his daughter in his arm
just cussin', like...

1026
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:42,459
like, "Yeah, nigga.
Don't, don't, don't
fuckin' play me, my guy."

1027
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:44,292
And he would be like,
"You good, baby girl?
You good?"

1028
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,542
"All right, yeah, so..."
and I was like,
"This is a character."

but if maybe you wanna
stay in another neighborhood,

1037
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:10,918
that's also fine.

1038

it out in the morning."

1092
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:41,459

and I was like, "Oh fuck,
I want change something."

1093
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:42,959
I was like,
"Kira, did you send it?"
She was like,

1094
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:45,292
"I sent it,
but I can recall it."

1095
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:48,751

I read something else--

this is the cast

1102
00:43:58,459 --> 00:44:02,334
and I, I want the first
impression to at least be--

1103
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:04,709
Like, we know that we're
gonna continue to work on this,

1104
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:06,709
but, like, I still
feel confident in it.

1105
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:08,667

1108
00:44:13,459 --> 00:44:16,667
if it just ends with a,
"Aw, man, that's it?"

1109
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:18,500
Like, I don't want
that feeling of,

1110
00:44:18,584 --> 00:44:21,042
"I dedicated my life
for five years. This is it?"

1111
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,709

that it was all represented,

00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:43,334
Like, I love that
I got to play Tiffany.

1144
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:45,167
I think
in the beginning,
it was more

1145
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,500
a trope of like
the bougie, light skin, AKA.

1146
00:45:47,584 --> 00:45:49,083
Where's Tiffany?
Is she mad at me?!

1147
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:51,167
-I don't know.
She hide in the closet.
-Tiffany: Yes, I know

1148
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,125
he's our little weed baby.

1149
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,542
(Tiffany cries)

1150
00:45:55,626 --> 00:45:58,500
But I just wanna
be home with you.

1151
00:45:58,584 --> 00:46:01,292
And we really got to see her

1152
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:03,792
develop into a mom,

1153
00:46:03,876 --> 00:46:06,334
<i>into a more
compassionate friend,</i>

1154
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:08,167
into, like,
the truth-teller
of the gang.

1155
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,751
We're all doing great things.
Look at you getting fit.
Look at Kelli.

1156
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:14,834
Look at Molly,
taking interviews,
taking names.

1157
00:46:14,918 --> 00:46:17,417
Look at Issa... hmm.

1158
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,042
I feel like people
have come to see Tiffany

1159
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:23,125
as part of this legacy of

1160
00:46:23,209 --> 00:46:25,250
bougie Black women in television

1161
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:28,792
from Hilary Banks
to Whitley Gilbert,

1162
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:31,209
and so, like, to be
in the company of that

1163
00:46:31,292 --> 00:46:34,584
within the African-American
cultural canon is just like

1164
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:35,751
a dream.

1165
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:38,542
Melina: All right.
Let's do it, everybody.

1166
00:46:38,626 --> 00:46:39,709
Picture's up.

1167
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:46,375
(indistinct chatter)

1168
00:46:50,876 --> 00:46:53,334
-Prentice: Good, cut.
-Speaker: It is time to say...

1169
00:46:53,417 --> 00:46:58,125
series wrap on...
Natasha Rothwell.

1170
00:46:58,209 --> 00:47:01,334
(cheering and applause)

1171
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:07,000
Natasha Rothwell:
<i>I remember when</i>
<i>I first got the show,</i>

1172
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:08,459
<i>and I was just like,
"I don't know if</i>

1173
00:47:08,542 --> 00:47:10,667
<i>Issa's made a huge mistake,
or if I can do this."</i>

1174
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:12,626
<i>It's very vulnerable
for me to say,</i>

1175
00:47:12,709 --> 00:47:14,042
<i>but it's just true.</i>

1176
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,000
<i>What the show has taught
me over six years</i>

1177
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,083
is that you can grow
into those positions,

1178
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:21,542
and into those--
You know, to meet
those expectations,

1179
00:47:21,626 --> 00:47:23,250
and that we're only
limiting ourselves

1180
00:47:23,334 --> 00:47:25,626
when we don't, sort of,
take those risks and chances,

1181
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:28,000
and have the courage
to just try.

1182
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:31,125
And I think that, again,
it's about visibility, right,

1183
00:47:31,209 --> 00:47:35,709
and not one singular
Black female voice.

1184
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:37,459
And yet,
Issa's voice is singular,

1185
00:47:37,542 --> 00:47:40,542
and I think I'm excited
for... disruption,

1186
00:47:40,626 --> 00:47:43,292
shaking the table,
and infusing the culture

1187
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:46,334
of Hollywood with more
Black female voices.

1188
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:49,042
Amy Aniobi:
"Now we are inside
of an international hotel.

1189
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,375
"We're at a poppin' ass party.
Everyone's dressed to the nines,

1190
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:53,542
<i>drinking and mingling as
the DJ hypes the crowd."</i>

1191
00:47:53,626 --> 00:47:55,876
(indistinct chatter)

1192
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,000
(laughs)

1193
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:04,834
At a certain point,
I'll crane back out,
but we're craning in.

1194
00:48:04,918 --> 00:48:06,959
-So, it'll just be super loose,
and then--
-Yvonne: Okay.

1195
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:09,334
That's just what the scene is.
It'll be like getting
in on steadicam.

1196
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:11,125
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Like, coming behind you guys.

1197
00:48:11,209 --> 00:48:12,334
All right, let's make a wedding.

1198
00:48:12,417 --> 00:48:14,417
(cheering and applause)

1199
00:48:17,709 --> 00:48:19,083
Smile, Leonard, yeah.

1200
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:23,709
Just listen to me-- Don't--
Just smile. Smile at her.

1201
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:28,125
Molly has really been
a delicious character
to embody.

1202
00:48:28,209 --> 00:48:31,250
<i>She has taught me things.
I think I've taught
her some things,</i>

1203
00:48:31,334 --> 00:48:33,083
<i>though these
are writers' words,</i>

1204
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:35,542
<i>but I would like
to think that I brought</i>

1205
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:37,584
<i>my growth
and my healing to her,</i>

1206
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:40,125
<i>but she also brought her growth
and her healing to me.</i>

1207
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:43,792
<i>By the time we get
to the end of season five,</i>

1208
00:48:43,876 --> 00:48:46,918
it's just like...
she found herself.

1209
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,500
Prentice:
And... cue Jay.

1210
00:48:49,584 --> 00:48:51,375
Jay:
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I've ever thought about</i>

1211
00:48:51,459 --> 00:48:53,167
<i>where Lawrence's
story should go</i>

1212
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,167
<i>as we've gone
from season to season.</i>

1213
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,584
In my mind, it was always like,
"Yo, I'm here for Issa's story."

1214
00:48:57,667 --> 00:49:01,500
<i>So, whatever Issa wants
at the end of the day
is, like, what I wanna do.</i>

1215
00:49:01,584 --> 00:49:03,459
<i>And being able to bring...</i>

1216
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:07,792
Lawrence's journey
full circle from who he was
in the beginning,

1217
00:49:07,876 --> 00:49:11,000
<i>from a dude sittin'
on the couch,
crippled in fear,</i>

1218
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:12,542
<i>who couldn't take
care of himself,</i>

1219
00:49:12,626 --> 00:49:14,792
<i>much less take care
of anyone else.</i>

1220
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:18,209
To see him come full circle,
to being a father,

1221
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:20,042
<i>going after what he wants,</i>

1222
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:22,500
being okay with just who he is,

1223
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,959
and, like, knowin' that
I have figured myself out,

1224
00:49:25,042 --> 00:49:28,918
<i>and this is the type
of relationship that
I want in my life.</i>

1225
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,834
And it's crazy 'cause
it just feels so real.

1226
00:49:31,918 --> 00:49:34,751
Speaker:
<i>We have to wrap</i>
<i>up this day with</i>

1227
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:38,709
the very multifaceted,
emotional news

1228
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:45,167
that this is an "Insecure"
series wrap on Jay Ellis.

1229
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,292
(cheering and applause)

1230
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:53,918
Jay:<i> You know,</i>
<i>now that we're done...</i>

1231
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:57,167
it's the people, man.

1232
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:01,292
(indistinct chatter)

1233
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:04,167
Nigga, we did it.

1234
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,334
Nigga, that shit.

1235
00:50:05,417 --> 00:50:08,083
(all laughing)

1236
00:50:08,167 --> 00:50:09,417
He did it.

1237
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,667
You still got--
Y'all still got somethin' to do.

1238
00:50:12,751 --> 00:50:15,417
<i>It's really rare to go
to work every day...</i>

1239
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:17,667
and love...

1240
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,667
not only the work...

1241
00:50:21,709 --> 00:50:23,292
but, like...

1242
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:24,667
the people that you're with,

1243
00:50:24,751 --> 00:50:26,834
and for all of us...

1244
00:50:26,918 --> 00:50:28,626
to walk out of this show
six years later,

1245
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:30,334
and still love each other?

1246
00:50:32,959 --> 00:50:35,500
It's all you could dream for.
Like, it's all you could--

1247
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:37,417
Thank you.

1248
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,334
It's all, uh...

1249
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:43,542
It's all you could
dream for in a show.

1250
00:50:43,626 --> 00:50:44,876
...more wrap gifts, man.

1251
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,542
It's the Black Santa.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Boom.

1252
00:50:47,626 --> 00:50:51,417
<i>I'mma miss every single person
we've had on our production,</i>

1253
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,042
from sound to camera and Issa.

1254
00:50:55,626 --> 00:50:56,709
Um...

1255
00:50:58,834 --> 00:51:00,500
and Issa.

1256
00:51:00,584 --> 00:51:02,918
<i>It is very rare to have...</i>

1257
00:51:05,209 --> 00:51:08,250
the creator of your show
also be your co-star,

1258
00:51:08,334 --> 00:51:09,792
<i>also be your biggest champion,</i>

1259
00:51:09,876 --> 00:51:11,918
<i>and I'mma miss
the shit out of that.</i>

1260
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,667
Amy Aniobi:
"We're in the hotel room.
The party's over.

1261
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:15,626
"Issa helps Molly take
her wedding dress off.

1262
00:51:15,709 --> 00:51:18,417
"As Issa unzips and unclips
the complicated dress,

1263
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,042
<i>and Molly sways, still tipsy."</i>

1264
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:23,417
Okay, just one more row.
How you feelin', girl?

1265
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:29,292
Happy.
Like really, really,
really happy.

1266
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:33,667
(sighs)
As long as you're around,
I'mma be okay.

1267
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:35,375
Yeah.

1268
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:39,375
Me too.

1269
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:44,375
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

1270
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:48,125
And, uh, cut.

1271
00:51:48,209 --> 00:51:50,083
Speaker:
All right, let's cut.
Let's keep it quiet, yeah?

1272
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:51,792
-And that's it.
-(bells rings)

1273
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:53,209
Speaker:
All right, everybody.

1274
00:51:53,292 --> 00:51:55,292
Bring up the house lights,
and come on out here.

1275
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:59,292
I'm gonna stay lyin'
or I'm gonna start cryin'.
Let's go. Come out here.

1276
00:52:02,334 --> 00:52:04,918
Oh no.

1277
00:52:06,709 --> 00:52:09,542
This is a series wrap--
Damnit.

1278
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,834
This is series wrap
on Yvonne Orji.

1279
00:52:12,918 --> 00:52:15,375
(applause)

1280
00:52:21,459 --> 00:52:23,500
Man, thank you all so mu--

1281
00:52:23,584 --> 00:52:27,542
Come on, man... um, for real,
thank you guys so much.

1282
00:52:27,626 --> 00:52:32,125
Issa, I owe
so much to you.
We all do.

1283
00:52:32,209 --> 00:52:35,751
I'm so grateful that I got
to rock with you by your side

1284
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:38,667
as your number two
for six years.

1285
00:52:38,751 --> 00:52:41,626
You changed the heck
outta my life.

1286
00:52:41,709 --> 00:52:45,792
Everybody, cast, crew,
writers, Prentice...

1287
00:52:45,876 --> 00:52:47,167
I love the heck outta y'all.

1288
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:50,042
Like, we did it.
We made a show.

1289
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:54,500
The role that I'm most proud of
is not even really being Molly,

1290
00:52:54,584 --> 00:52:57,125
it's just being
able to serve you.

1291
00:52:57,209 --> 00:52:59,667
That's what I take
so much pride in.

1292
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:01,959
I wanted to protect you

1293
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:04,876
'cause you, literally,
were the head,

1294
00:53:04,959 --> 00:53:08,918
and I know that
heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

1295
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,876
We did it.
We did it, yo!
We did it!

1296
00:53:12,959 --> 00:53:14,417
We always discussed in the room

1297
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,876
that the true love story
of "Insecure" is Issa and Molly,

1298
00:53:16,959 --> 00:53:20,083
<i>and we wanted to show that
you can get to a place, like,</i>

1299
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:23,375
<i>not with every friend,
but in this friendship
at least,</i>

1300
00:53:23,459 --> 00:53:26,209
<i>that they were growing
at different paces,</i>

1301
00:53:26,292 --> 00:53:29,626
<i>and, eventually, lined up
and grew in sync again
by the end of the show,</i>

1302
00:53:29,709 --> 00:53:32,375
<i>that they really realized that,
"No, you're my person.</i>

1303
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,209
<i>You're my friend...
for life."</i>

1304
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:38,000
<i>This wasn't a friendship
for a reason or a season.</i>

1305
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:39,876
<i>This is a friendship
for a lifetime.</i>

1306
00:53:39,959 --> 00:53:43,292
We ain't shit
but some tricks.
Hello, what?

1307
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:45,834
-Pick up the phone. Hello?
-Oh, you so stupid.

1308
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:49,292
-(both laughing)
-Bottoms up.

1309
00:53:50,334 --> 00:53:51,959
This spiked?

1310
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:53,000
I love you.

1311
00:53:55,584 --> 00:53:58,125
Speaker:
<i>We are saying</i>
<i>goodbye and goodnight</i>

1312
00:53:58,209 --> 00:54:00,125
and a series finale
to Prentice Penny.

1313
00:54:00,209 --> 00:54:03,334
(cheering and applause)

1314
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:10,334
I don't know why
I still have this on.
I'm COVID tested.

1315
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:12,125
Um...

1316
00:54:12,209 --> 00:54:16,334
When we met, I always felt
like if I was a young Issa,

1317
00:54:16,417 --> 00:54:19,417
how would I want my person,
a showrunner to be?

1318
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,876
And, uh, I--
It was very important
for me that...

1319
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:26,542
I walk away from this,
that you could always say,

1320
00:54:26,626 --> 00:54:29,542
"He helped me make the show
I wanted to make...

1321
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:31,250
and he never got
in the way once."

1322
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:34,083
And that was always
like my North Star.

1323
00:54:34,167 --> 00:54:38,292
And, you know, you realize,
sometimes, you're just a brick
in somebody else's story,

1324
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:40,500
and you have a bigger
function to serve.

1325
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:43,834
I would think about all
the times I was the only
Black writer in rooms,

1326
00:54:43,918 --> 00:54:48,542
and goin' through the things
I went through for 17 years,
good and bad,

1327
00:54:48,626 --> 00:54:50,959
I tried to pour...

1328
00:54:51,042 --> 00:54:55,459
all of what I knew,
everything I learned,
every skill set I had

1329
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,375
was just to pour it into you,

1330
00:54:57,459 --> 00:55:02,375
and you have exceeded,
and have gone farther than
I could've dreamed for you.

1331
00:55:02,459 --> 00:55:05,626
And the beauty is
that you'll never know
those things that I saw,

1332
00:55:05,709 --> 00:55:10,334
you only create a new path,
and I will miss you...

1333
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,709
so much.
I love you.
And, um...

1334
00:55:14,792 --> 00:55:17,167
yeah, I don't know.
I love you.

1335
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,667
I love you so much.
Thank you.

1336
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:22,834
(applause)

1337
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:27,250
-What I'mma do without you now?
-You fine. You got 18 shows.

1338
00:55:27,334 --> 00:55:29,792
-You good.
-(all laughing)

1339
00:55:32,751 --> 00:55:37,042
(indistinct chatter)

1340
00:55:38,876 --> 00:55:41,918
Melina:
And... action.

1341
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,500
Poor thing.
She went to bed at 4:00.

1342
00:55:44,584 --> 00:55:48,834
Had a 8:42 call time,
I just looked at it.

1343
00:55:48,918 --> 00:55:52,167
That's what happens when
you have your own show.

1344
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,334
(laughter)

1345
00:55:55,417 --> 00:55:56,918
Speaker:
Go lie down, baby.

1346
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,292
Anthony:
Y'all got her talent ready.

1347
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:04,751
Melina:
<i>I hope, in the future, that</i>

1348
00:56:04,834 --> 00:56:08,042
<i>people can take away from this,
that it was a classic.</i>

1349
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:13,250
<i>I really feel like it
was a beautiful picture
of how we live now.</i>

1350
00:56:13,334 --> 00:56:16,500
When you think back to our era,
you'll think back to "Insecure."

1351
00:56:16,584 --> 00:56:20,042
But I also hope that there's
so many other shows that

1352
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:25,375
<i>follow in our footsteps,
and really diversify
that landscape.</i>

1353
00:56:27,542 --> 00:56:29,375
And that's a cut...

1354
00:56:29,459 --> 00:56:34,459
of the last shot of "Insecure,"
the HBO series.

1355
00:56:34,542 --> 00:56:37,959
Speaker:
That is... a series wrap

1356
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:41,292
-on our queen, Issa Rae.
-Let's go!

1357
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:47,250
You guys, I am just
incredibly humbled, blessed.

1358
00:56:47,334 --> 00:56:48,250
Uh...

1359
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,292
but I'm just honored
to know a lot of you.

1360
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:04,125
When I, when I
set out to do this--
Y'all know me.

1361
00:57:04,209 --> 00:57:06,167
I'm not, I'm not
the topmost talented person,

1362
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,792
I'm not the funniest person.

1363
00:57:07,876 --> 00:57:10,542
I'm not... I'm not

1364
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:13,834
-the, the best person--
-You're Issa Rae!

1365
00:57:13,918 --> 00:57:18,751
But, you know, you aspire
and you dream and you imagine,

1366
00:57:18,834 --> 00:57:22,083
<i>and, and I never imagined
that I would get to work</i>

1367
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:25,876
<i>with all of you...
in support of this,</i>

1368
00:57:25,959 --> 00:57:28,626
<i>and to meet so many
amazing, talented people.</i>

1369
00:57:28,709 --> 00:57:31,709
I think about my loved ones,

1370
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:34,918
uh, my brothers
and sisters in cast,

1371
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,918
and how you guys
have elevated me,

1372
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,542
how I've learned so much
from you along the way.

1373
00:57:40,626 --> 00:57:43,500
I've learned so much
about myself through you,

1374
00:57:43,584 --> 00:57:46,792
and am just so blessed

1375
00:57:46,876 --> 00:57:48,042
to, to be in your presence,

1376
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:50,083
and to know that
I have family for life.

1377
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:53,250
-That's a wrap!
-(cheering)

1378
00:57:53,334 --> 00:57:56,375
("Kinda Love" by
TeaMarrr playing)

1379
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:05,709
Prentice:
<i>When I look at other</i>
<i>shows growing up,</i>

1380
00:58:05,792 --> 00:58:07,459
<i>I had not seen a family
that looked like mine</i>

1381
00:58:07,542 --> 00:58:10,000
<i>in Black television till
I saw "Cosby," right?</i>

1382
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:11,626
<i>So, when I look
at that show, I'm like,</i>

1383
00:58:11,709 --> 00:58:13,334
<i>that show inspired me
to think that, like,</i>

1384
00:58:13,417 --> 00:58:16,292
<i>my representation of life
can be on screen,</i>

1385
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:18,375
<i>and it just made me
believe it was possible.</i>

1386
00:58:18,459 --> 00:58:20,292
So, if I had
to distill it down,

1387
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:23,083
I would hope that people
would watch "Insecure" and go,

1388
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:25,000
"Oh, like, achieving

1389
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:29,751
<i>at a high level, creatively,
opportunity-wise is possible."</i>

1390
00:58:29,834 --> 00:58:31,626
And, sometimes,
in this country,

1391
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:35,209
you don't always get
to think that things that
look like you are possible.

1392
00:58:35,292 --> 00:58:37,751
So, that's what I would hope
the legacy behind it is,

1393
00:58:37,834 --> 00:58:41,918
whatever people need it to be,
to know that it's possible.

1394
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,250
(cheering)

1395
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:51,209
(laughing)

1396
00:58:51,292 --> 00:58:55,083
-How you feel to be done, baby?
-Baby, I'm tired, aight.

1397
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:56,417
You too pretty, baby,
you too pretty.

1398
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,042
I started this shit,
I poured out into this shit.

1399
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:01,667
-We done, baby.
"Insecure," bitch!
-We done!

1400
00:59:01,751 --> 00:59:03,834
Yay!

1401
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:11,375
-I love you.
-I love you. I love you.

1402
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:14,000

All: Hey!

-I love you more.

1407
00:59:29,334 --> 00:59:32,167
I just wanna go down
as people's favorite show.
It's super simple.

1408
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:36,584
<i>Like, in the way that
I talk nostalgically about
the shows that shaped me,</i>

1409
00:59:36,667 --> 00:59:38,876
<i>that make me smile
when I think about them,</i>

1410
00:59:38,959 --> 00:59:43,000
<i>that I reflect on a specific
time in my life, happily.</i>

1411
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:45,250
<i>Like, I want our show
to do the same for people.</i>

1412
00:59:45,334 --> 00:59:49,459
<i>I want them to think about
scenes and the first time
they watched something,</i>

1413
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:52,792
<i>and imagine where
they were at the time
that they watched it,</i>

1414
00:59:52,876 --> 00:59:54,083
<i>where they were
in their lives.</i>

1415
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:57,000
<i>I want it to be
a part of who they are.</i>

1416
00:59:57,083 --> 00:59:58,334
