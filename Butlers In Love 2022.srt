5
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,266
Emma...

6
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,533
You didn't even
close the door!

7
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:15,000
The carpool was late,

8
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,133
and I don't want to miss

9
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:17,667
the beginning
of Plumshire Manor.

10
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,400
It would be so cool
to have a life like that.

11
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,000
Work for royalty,
travel to exotic places,

12
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,333
eat gourmet food,

13
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:27,900
be in charge
of an entire estate.

14
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:31,367
Well, you can start
by cleaning your room.

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,533
Mom!

16
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,567
All right, all right,
after the show, hmm?

17
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:46,767
Being a Butler
here at Plumshire Manor

18
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,567
is the greatest honor
of my life.

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,133
All right, everybody,

20
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:04,166
your penne, ma'am,

21
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,166
and your penne,

22
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,266
and this one's gluten-free.

23
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,433
Is everything
looking good, guys?

24
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:10,567
You're good?

25
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,233
Okay, I'll be back
with those two drinks.

26
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:13,734
Okay, that's got to be
a new record.

27
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,433
What was that like 19 dishes?

28
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:17,200
I've been practicing non-stop.

29
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,734
Why?

30
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:20,533
You know it's okay
to take more than one trip.

31
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:21,567
Mm-mm.

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,800
At the butler academy,

33
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,066
they expect you to carry
multiple dishes at once

34
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,066
with no tray.

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,433
Of course they do.

36
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:28,533
Butling is a lot harder
than people think.

37
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:31,667
I'm sorry, what?

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,700
"Butling"?

39
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:33,700
That can't be a real word.

40
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,233
It must be called
something else.

41
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:37,333
Mm-mm. The official term
is "butling."

42
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:38,333
Huh.

43
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:40,500
Speaking of,
have you heard anything?

44
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:41,767
No.

45
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,800
I'm hoping for an acceptance
letter from the Academy

46
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:44,000
any day now.

47
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,233
Well, I'd cross
my fingers and toes for you,

48
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,333
but that would make me
a very dangerous waitress.

49
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,333
Emma, you home?

50
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,500
I got takeout!

51
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:40,500
Yeah, I'm in the kitchen!

52
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:43,767
Another rejection?

53
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,066
Yeah.

54
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,934
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

55
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:51,333
You look tired.

56
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:53,033
You're working too hard.

57
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,433
What time did you get home
last night?

58
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,333
I learned about hard work
from you.

59
00:03:57,467 --> 00:04:01,166
Yes, but I was a single parent
trying to raise you.

60
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,533
You're doing it--

61
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,266
Because the guy
from the Butler Academy

62
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,667
said I needed more
service industry experience.

63
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Well, you put yourself
through college,

64
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:11,467
got a degree in communications,

65
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,133
took three different
language courses,

66
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:16,700
moved back home to save money.

67
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:18,166
I mean, you'd think
that would be enough

68
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,166
to get you in.

69
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,333
Does this go with Chinese?

70
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:23,233
Yeah, I don't know, it's red.

71
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:25,700
Mom, these schools are
hard to get into for a reason.

72
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,800
Graduates from these programs

73
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,000
end up working for some of
the most important dignitaries,

74
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:31,834
monarchs, and politicians
in the world.

75
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,467
They make, like, six,
or seven figure incomes.

76
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,667
I know,

77
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,367
I just wish you didn't
have to break your back

78
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,166
just to be considered.

79
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,533
You know, this one person
in that chat forum I'm in

80
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,000
made the point
that butler school

81
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,934
can be harder to get into
than law school.

82
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:45,500
Well then...

83
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:46,600
try law school?

84
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:49,700
Kidding.

85
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:51,967
Look, I'm just--

86
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,333
I'm just worried

87
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,233
you're putting all your eggs
in this butler basket,

88
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:57,867
and I know you'll get in,

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,066
and you'll go,

90
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,467
and you'll be great,

91
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,233
but I just don't want you
to miss out on life

92
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:04,367
while you're at it.

93
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,600
I'm not.

94
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:07,100
I'm not missing out on life,
I have a life.

95
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:08,300
Really?

96
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,433
Yeah.

97
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,500
Today, I hung out with Marie.

98
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:14,500
At work?

99
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:16,600
Doesn't count.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,200
Chow mein?

101
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,734
Hello?

102
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:31,834
Am I speaking with
Ms. Emma Conroy?

103
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:32,934
You are.

104
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,266
Ah, good afternoon, Ms. Conroy.

105
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,266
This is Charles Wiloughby

106
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,800
from the American
Butler Academy.

107
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:40,867
Hi!

108
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,734
I am calling with regard
to your most recent application.

109
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:46,934
Yes,

110
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:48,667
I received your letter
of rejection yesterday.

111
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,700
Ah, well, there's been
a slight change of plans.

112
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,433
At the last minute,
we had a student drop out,

113
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:56,066
and if you're
still interested,

114
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,900
we'd like to offer you
the open spot.

115
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:02,100
Hello?

116
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,100
Ms. Conroy?

117
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:04,500
Are you still there?

118
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:05,533
Yes, I am here,

119
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:07,767
and yes,
I definitely want that spot.

120
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,300
Wonderful.

121
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:10,767
Thank you so much.

122
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,300
My pleasure.

123
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:13,433
We shall be in touch,

124
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,100
and, uh, good day to you.

125
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:17,600
Okay, thank you so much.

126
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:18,700
Okay, bye.

127
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:21,934
Yes!

128
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,700
Yes!

129
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:43,867
- Oh! Sorry!
- I'm so sorry.

130
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,000
How gorgeous is this place?

131
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:49,767
I know, I just can't believe
I'm actually here.

132
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,767
Same.

133
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,000
Applied multiple times?

134
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:53,700
Yes, and to so many
different programs.

135
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:54,900
Me too!

136
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,734
I hear this one
is one of the best, though.

137
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:58,100
Oh, definitely.
Congrats.

138
00:07:58,233 --> 00:07:59,100
You too.

139
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:00,900
Hey, I'm Lisa Bolster.

140
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,133
Emma Conroy. Hi.

141
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:03,433
Nice to meet you.

142
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,867
Do you know what type of butling
you're hoping to do

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,066
after you graduate?

144
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,900
Yeah, my dream
is to be a butler

145
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:09,300
at one of those grand estates
in Europe.

146
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:10,333
Amazing.

147
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:11,367
What about you?

148
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Yachting.

149
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:13,633
I've been trying
to get into it for years.

150
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:15,400
The most successful
yacht butlers

151
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,100
all graduated from here.

152
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,867
So cool.

153
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,400
All students,

154
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:22,967
please gather
in the entrance hall.

155
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,033
Here we go!

156
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,033
Okay.

157
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,433
Did you do the tour online?

158
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:28,800
Of course.
Five times.

159
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:30,867
So, I've been working
in a restaurant.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,934
I wouldn't say it's fine dining,
but it's sort of fancy...

161
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,500
Welcome. incoming students

162
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:46,066
of the American Butler Academy.

163
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,433
My name is Charles Wiloughby.

164
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:53,300
I have dedicated my life
to the craft of butling,

165
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,200
and opened up this school

166
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,400
to pass on my knowledge

167
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:59,967
to the next generation
of great butlers.

168
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:04,734
These next few weeks
will be hard and grueling.

169
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:08,600
You will be bombarded
with information and skills

170
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:11,000
that you will need to retain
immediately,

171
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,500
but I promise you

172
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:16,333
it will all pay off in the end.

173
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:17,600
- It better.
- I hope so.

174
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,133
Now, the hardest part
about being a butler

175
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:23,667
is balance,

176
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,834
both figuratively
and literally.

177
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,633
The cart behind you

178
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:33,667
symbolizes the skills
that you will have to master.

179
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,100
By the end of this course,

180
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:37,233
you should be able
to carry one full service

181
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:38,367
in one trip.

182
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,233
I assure you,

183
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:43,500
I am not kidding.

184
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:47,400
Is there anyone amongst you now
who cares to try it out?

185
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:49,767
See if there are
any early standouts among you?

186
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,333
Ah...

187
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,867
initiative and confidence,

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,767
two excellent attributes
in a future butler.

189
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,700
Thank you.

190
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:00,333
Thanks.

191
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,066
Okay...

192
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,266
One full service?

193
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,266
Four plates?

194
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,467
I believe that's what I said.

195
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Okay.

196
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:16,133
I've got this.

197
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,667
Two...

198
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,467
three...

199
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:24,233
Whoo!

200
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,700
I was a server for a while--

201
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,333
Oh!

202
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:32,300
Yeah, I'll call you back.

203
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,934
I am so sorry,

204
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:37,867
I was-- I was on the phone,
and I-- Are you okay?

205
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:41,467
A prime example

206
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,433
of why butlers
need to be prepared

207
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:46,066
for anything and everything.

208
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,300
Proximity to doors

209
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:49,700
is always something to note,
Ms. Conroy...

210
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:50,700
Mm-hmm.

211
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:52,800
...and Mr. Walker...

212
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:57,800
...nice of you
to finally join us.

213
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,600
Hey, guys.

214
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,000
I am so sorry.

215
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:06,000
In your hands,
you have a crisp, white shirt,

216
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,266
Windsor-cut collar,

217
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,166
along with a black or gray tie,

218
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,533
which should be
in a Windsor knot,

219
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:13,800
always.

220
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:15,400
Also, a vest, or waistcoat,

221
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,934
with the bottom button undone,

222
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:19,166
as per tradition,

223
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,734
dating back to Edward VII.

224
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:24,033
Smooth top, no wrinkles.

225
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,400
Cufflinks are a must,

226
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:29,433
and the shirt sleeve
is the transition

227
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,600
from the jacket to the hands,

228
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,367
and should be visible

229
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,834
two centimeters
outside of the jacket,

230
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,567
and we measure...

231
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,567
Are you really taking notes?

232
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,934
Yeah, this is important...

233
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:49,600
When wearing a jacket,

234
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:50,700
again,

235
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:53,033
you should leave
the bottom button open.

236
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,433
Trousers should always be

237
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:57,233
as long as two centimeters

238
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:59,433
above the heel of the shoe.

239
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,934
Shoe shine is available
in all of your rooms,

240
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:02,934
and should be used daily.

241
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:04,000
You spelled "trousers" wrong.

242
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,100
Do you mind?

243
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:09,567
Sorry.

244
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,000
There will be uniform checks.

245
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:12,567
The first will be
tomorrow morning.

246
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,567
When you hear the bell,

247
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,767
you will have precisely
10 minutes

248
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,467
to come downstairs
fully dressed,

249
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,033
in pristine condition.

250
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,734
Yes.

251
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,400
What happens
if we miss a button

252
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:24,500
or we tie our tie wrong?

253
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:27,800
Hmm, well,
like everything we do here

254
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:29,433
at the Academy,

255
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,767
you'll be graded and tested.

256
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,700
The better you do,
the higher your class ranking.

257
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:33,800
The higher your rankings,

258
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:36,100
the more likely you are

259
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,233
to receive a letter
of recommendation.

260
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:41,667
Fully one-third
of the students at the Academy

261
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,734
fail,

262
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:45,834
so please act accordingly.

263
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:50,100
Now, join the lovely Ms. Martin
as she assigns you your rooms.

264
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:52,633
Please follow her.

265
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,767
Oh, Ms. Conroy,

266
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,867
would you mind
holding back a moment?

267
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:11,333
It was chance
that gave you your spot here.

268
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:12,867
I hope you keep that in mind.

269
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,233
Yes, I will,

270
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,734
and I want you to know
I'm so grateful to be here.

271
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:17,033
Mm-hmm.

272
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,400
Then please don't speak
when I am speaking.

273
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,567
In fact, chitchat
is a slippery slope,

274
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,000
and something
butlers should avoid.

275
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:25,500
100%.

276
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:26,900
I don't even know that guy.

277
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:29,600
He's just some rude person.

278
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
It won't happen again.

279
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:34,600
I'm sure it won't.

280
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:35,600
Off you go.

281
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:36,633
Yes.

282
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:38,133
Sorry.

283
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,867
- Hi!
- Hi!

284
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,333
So glad we got assigned
as roommates.

285
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,333
Same.

286
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:52,500
I feel like

287
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:53,567
you're one of the few
friendly faces I've seen

288
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,834
since I got here.

289
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,400
I think the instructors
are just really serious people.

290
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,200
You know that Mr. Wiloughby

291
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,433
worked for the Swedish
royal family

292
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:02,767
for, like, 30 years.

293
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,767
Really?

294
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,200
That's impressive.

295
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,200
I hope I get
on his good side.

296
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,967
You will.

297
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,700
Hardest part was getting in.

298
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:12,700
Now we're here, we got this.

299
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:13,800
You're right.

300
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:14,834
Thank you.

301
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,166
I'm not gonna let some latecomer

302
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,600
ruin the fact that I'm here,

303
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:18,600
and I'm ready to learn.

304
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:19,867
Exactly!

305
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:30,100
Here we go!

306
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,667
Lisa!

307
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,066
Five more minutes.

308
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,767
No, I don't think
it works like that.

309
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,266
The bell means
we have 10 minutes to get ready

310
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,800
and lined up
in uniform downstairs.

311
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:41,200
Is the sun even up?

312
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,400
Yes!

313
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:47,900
Shoot, I'm missing a cufflink.

314
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:49,567
What? Already?

315
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,133
Oh... it's so tiny.

316
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,867
I'll help you look for it,

317
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,400
but you have to help me
tie a Windsor knot.

318
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,633
Hands out of pockets.

319
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,367
Your trousers are creased.

320
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,033
Ah...

321
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,200
good knot.

322
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,467
Wrong button...

323
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,734
Ah, hardly a Windsor.

324
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,700
That is a Charlie knot,
Mr. Archer,

325
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,834
and you must shine
the spots off your shoes.

326
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:15,834
Spots?

327
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,834
I don't even see any spots.

328
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:17,867
Hmm!

329
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,767
Therein lies
your first problem.

330
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:26,200
Hmm, Ms. Bolster,

331
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,867
good knot.

332
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,800
Do up your jacket.

333
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:33,867
Uh, overall, too much space
between jacket and wrist.

334
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,767
Ms. Conroy,
where is your cufflink?

335
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,133
I couldn't find it
anywhere, sir.

336
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:38,467
I'm so sorry.

337
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,700
Butlers don't make excuses,
they find solutions.

338
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:41,967
Of course.

339
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,300
Retrieve your cufflink.

340
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:44,633
In any household,

341
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:47,300
a mishap like that
could cost you your position.

342
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,967
Ah, Mr. Walker,

343
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,333
you're late.

344
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:54,500
I'm sorry.

345
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:56,667
Yeah, my alarm did not go off.

346
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,600
It is early.

347
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,533
Despite his tardiness,

348
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:08,033
Mr. Walker is wearing
his uniform

349
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,266
close to perfection.

350
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,767
Please all take note,

351
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,900
this is how
you should all look

352
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:13,200
going forward,

353
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,233
but that is the second time
you've been late.

354
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:16,367
Don't let it happen again.

355
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,700
Yes, sir.

356
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:18,934
Please follow me for breakfast.

357
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:22,000
I shall be going over
class schedules.

358
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:28,900
So...

359
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:29,900
can anyone tell me

360
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:32,667
where the word "butler"
comes from?

361
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,667
Yes.

362
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,867
The word "butler"

363
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,333
comes from the old french word,

364
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:37,367
"bouteiller"

365
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
which means "cup bearer".

366
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:40,000
In Ancient Greece and Rome,

367
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,734
butlers were in charge
of the household's refreshments.

368
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,600
Yes,

369
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:45,100
and do you know why this was?

370
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:46,433
Yes, I do.

371
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:47,533
Alcoholic beverages

372
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:49,266
were stored
in earthenware containers,

373
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,800
which were considered
very valuable to the household,

374
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:53,367
so only the most trusted
of servants

375
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,367
were allowed to handle them.

376
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,467
Okay, yeah,

377
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,667
so they technically
were not butlers.

378
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,767
What do you mean?

379
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,834
They were just servants
who poured wine.

380
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,600
Mm, no,

381
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,834
it was more meaningful
than that.

382
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:05,834
Mm, no.

383
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:07,433
What we now know as butling

384
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:09,967
didn't exist until
the 17th and 18th Century.

385
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,266
No, butlers have existed
since the dawn of hospitality,

386
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,300
which can be traced
as far back as 15,000 B.C.E.

387
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:16,300
Oh, come on.

388
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:17,333
It's true.

389
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:18,967
The Lascaux caves in France

390
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,600
were the first documented
shelters in history

391
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:24,133
where people accommodated
others from a different tribe,

392
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:26,166
so, really, butling
is older than the wheel.

393
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,800
That's a bit of a stretch.

394
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:30,166
Actually,
the young lady is correct.

395
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,767
The role we presently play
in high society

396
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,066
dates back
to when civilization began.

397
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,767
Okay, right,
the history is important,

398
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,900
but the actual act
of being a butler

399
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:45,300
requires much more
than that, right?

400
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:47,100
Much, much more.

401
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,834
Which side is the water glass
supposed to be again?

402
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,433
Water glasses are the left.

403
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:00,633
Uh, no, the right.

404
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,166
I don't know why
I keep blanking on this.

405
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,700
I've studied this.

406
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,200
Salad fork
comes after the fish fork.

407
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,767
The menu you're setting
has it as an appetizer.

408
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
Yeah, the fish fork...

409
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:14,066
It's the smaller one
with the incurve.

410
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,367
Precisely.

411
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,600
I know that.

412
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:20,567
No, Mr. Archer.

413
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,166
Always make sure to measure.

414
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,867
The distance between
the water glass

415
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,233
and the top of the knives

416
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:29,000
needs to be exactly one inch.

417
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:32,533
The bread plate
goes to the left,

418
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:33,734
above the other plate.

419
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:35,333
Yeah, I know.
I worked at a restaurant.

420
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:37,000
All right,
I'm just trying to help.

421
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:39,233
No need, I've got this.

422
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:42,033
I just haven't had to set tables
under this pressure before.

423
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,400
You think this is pressure?

424
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:44,700
Just wait
till we have to do this

425
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,400
for actual royalty.

426
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:48,734
Wait, what?

427
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:49,734
Oh, yeah.

428
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,667
Our final dinner
we set and serve

429
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,467
is for real nobility.

430
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,567
Friends of Wiloughby's.

431
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:59,400
Excellent work, Mr. Walker,

432
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:00,900
though no surprise there.

433
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:02,233
Oh, thank you, Ms. Martin.

434
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:04,400
No, Ms. Conroy.

435
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,867
The knife blades
always need to face the plate.

436
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,367
Look to Mr. Walker's
as an example.

437
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,233
Mr. Wiloughby
will expect you all

438
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:15,567
to set a full table for eight

439
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,200
in under ten minutes

440
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,300
by this Friday.

441
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:22,734
A well-made floral bouquet

442
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:24,433
can transform any room

443
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:27,033
from the mundane to the elegant.

444
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,333
Do butlers have to create
flower arrangements often?

445
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:32,133
My old boss,

446
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:33,700
the Prince of Sweden,

447
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:37,033
he used to insist on waking up
every morning

448
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,567
to the fragrance
of the freshest flowers.

449
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,300
It is a necessity.

450
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:44,066
Fragrant flower.

451
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,600
He's not even
making a bouquet.

452
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:47,533
He's looking at tomatoes.

453
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:49,166
Maybe he's allergic
to flowers?

454
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,600
I don't get it.

455
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:52,200
He doesn't want to be here,
and he doesn't participate,

456
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,600
but he knows everything
about being a butler.

457
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,433
Right?

458
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:56,633
That Henry Walker guy?

459
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:57,967
Yeah, what's his deal?

460
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,967
He's a legacy butler.

461
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,967
A what?

462
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
A legacy butler.

463
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,133
He comes from
a long line of butlers.

464
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:05,433
I looked it up
last night before bed.

465
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,633
His family has been butling
for a duke's estate

466
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:08,633
for over 200 years.

467
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:10,734
Over 200 years?

468
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:12,066
Wow.

469
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,033
I think he's friends
with Henry's whole family.

470
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,800
That makes sense.

471
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:17,900
That's why he's getting away
with everything.

472
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:18,900
Nepotism at its finest.

473
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:20,767
Ugh, I hate that.

474
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,367
Well, that doesn't seem fair.

475
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,233
Although

476
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:32,934
you'll rarely have to do
the cooking yourself,

477
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,200
it is important for most butlers

478
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,166
to have a basic understanding
of the culinary arts,

479
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,266
and how to properly plate.

480
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,166
I think your bread is burning.

481
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,767
Oh, no.

482
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,400
You used way too much butter.

483
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:49,133
Thank you for the input.

484
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:51,834
Mm, that looks wonderful,
Mr. Walker.

485
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:52,867
Oh, thank you, sir.

486
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,066
- I'm using a peach glaze.
- Mm-hmm.

487
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,000
I can smell it caramelizing.

488
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,000
And Ms. Conroy,

489
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,867
what is it that you're making?

490
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,300
I'm making a grilled cheese.

491
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,400
With a Dijon vinaigrette
perhaps?

492
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,734
Or herb chèvre?

493
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:13,266
Uh, no, I was just going
for the basic sandwich.

494
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,100
I eat out a lot,
or I eat at work,

495
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,166
so I don't have
a lot of time to cook.

496
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,033
Mm-hmm.

497
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,467
Well, in order to excel
at butler duties

498
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,467
such as food preparation,

499
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
table management,

500
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:25,500
and stocking the household
for the chef,

501
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:28,433
knowing the bare bones
is a must.

502
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:32,967
Hey, add some apple and Gruyère
to the sandwich,

503
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,233
it will balance
the burnt flavor.

504
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,100
Is it true
that you're a legacy butler?

505
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:48,400
Glad to know
my reputation precedes me.

506
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:53,033
May I ask what, then,
are you doing here?

507
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,233
Same thing as you.

508
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:56,767
I'm getting my butler education.

509
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,800
Yeah, but it seems like

510
00:21:57,934 --> 00:21:59,166
you know most of this stuff
already.

511
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,567
You do realize

512
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,033
this is one of the most
prestigious butler academies

513
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,233
in the world, right?

514
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:05,133
Do you even want to be here?

515
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:06,233
No, not really.

516
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,800
Um, you're doing this
all wrong.

517
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:10,066
If you slice it
a little thinner,

518
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,767
it's much better for a sandwich.

519
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,500
Did you apply?

520
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,033
Oh, and if you add
some mustard,

521
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,533
this will bring out
the flavor of the Gruyère.

522
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:20,800
You didn't answer my question.

523
00:22:20,934 --> 00:22:22,500
Try this.

524
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:29,500
Not bad.

525
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:31,033
And yes,
to answer your question,

526
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,633
I did apply.

527
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,200
Ms. Conroy...

528
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,700
you're not supposed to eat
the dish yet.

529
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:41,867
Sorry.

530
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:02,667
Jared, that cotton
has a sheen.

531
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,500
You need to iron
the other side of the fabric,

532
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:08,033
and change to medium heat.

533
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,400
I never knew this job
required so much ironing.

534
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:13,400
It's important.

535
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:14,734
Is it?

536
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:16,600
If an estate has a butler,
surely, it has a maid.

537
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:18,600
Mm-mm, depends on the estate.

538
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:21,500
Usually, the butler is expected
to prepare the tablecloths,

539
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,734
but most butlers
help their clients

540
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:24,734
pick out and prepare
their wardrobe every day.

541
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:26,533
It's part of the glitz
and glamour of it all.

542
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:27,767
I'm sorry,

543
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,667
I think there is
something very glamour-ful

544
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,000
about taking care of some of
the most magnificent homes

545
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:33,066
in the world,

546
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,367
and managing those households

547
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,533
so that those who live there

548
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,033
can reach
their fullest potential.

549
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,767
Okay, I don't think
"glamour-ful" is a word.

550
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,600
and your tablecloth
is on fire.

551
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:44,934
Oh, no!

552
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:48,033
This needs to be
on a lower setting!

553
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,700
Perhaps concentrating
on your work,

554
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:54,834
instead of debating
other students

555
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,700
will help you
not burn down the manor.

556
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,633
Today,
I want you to understand

557
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:13,033
how to pair wine with meals,

558
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,600
and, most importantly,

559
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:16,133
how to properly serve that wine.

560
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:17,667
I swear

561
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,133
I've been to a million
wine-tasting bridal showers,

562
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:21,133
and I still
can't tell the difference

563
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:22,166
between most reds.

564
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,333
Tell me about it.

565
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:25,133
My go-to
is whatever's on sale,

566
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,133
and sometimes,

567
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:27,133
that's Franzia.

568
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,467
I'm sorry, you--

569
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,767
you drink wine from a--
from a box?

570
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,633
I mean, sometimes,

571
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,834
when the occasion calls for it.

572
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:37,066
What, uh,

573
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,000
what occasion could possibly
call for that?

574
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:40,333
You got home late from work,

575
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:41,467
you made some popcorn,

576
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,200
you poured yourself
a glass of wine.

577
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,834
Why? What's your go-to,

578
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:47,133
some rare bottle from 1912?

579
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:51,233
I mean, while the 1912
Rebello Valente Port

580
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:53,133
is really good,

581
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:55,033
I'm sure you'd agree,
Ms. Martin, right?

582
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:56,333
But, you know,

583
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:57,767
I usually don't have
three grand lying around.

584
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,367
Do you?

585
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,900
Now, Henry,

586
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:01,900
do you know the difference

587
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,033
between contrasting pairing

588
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,200
and congruent pairing?

589
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,800
Oh, sure, of course, yeah.

590
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:07,934
So, contrasting pair,

591
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:09,200
they create balance

592
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:12,200
by putting differing flavors
and tastes together,

593
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,133
and congruent pairing
creates balance

594
00:25:14,266 --> 00:25:16,133
by, um, how do you say it...

595
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:18,767
amplifying shared flavor compounds.

596
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,567
I can see why Mr. Wiloughby
spoke so highly of you.

597
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,233
Now take up the bottle
in front of you.

598
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:28,967
Eventually, we will work up
to synchronized pouring,

599
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,600
but we will start
with mastering the basics.

600
00:25:31,734 --> 00:25:32,633
We got this.

601
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:33,967
Getting wine into a cup

602
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,000
has never been
a problem for me.

603
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,900
A butler must pour
with confidence.

604
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:41,967
Hesitation will result in a mess.

605
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,533
Always have a napkin or cloth
to catch any drips.

606
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:47,367
Always have the label
facing the guest.

607
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,700
Always hold from
the bottom of the bottle.

608
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:51,233
Only pour to one third
of the glass

609
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:53,333
to allow the wine to aerate,

610
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:55,734
and end with one swift twist

611
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:57,066
to cut the pour,

612
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,467
and always return
to ready position

613
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,734
with one arm behind your back
when you finish.

614
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:05,166
I want to see
your perfect pours,

615
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,433
and remember,

616
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,233
always approach your guest
and their wine glass

617
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,900
from the right-hand side.

618
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,400
You just stained
a client's cuff.

619
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,567
Sorry.

620
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,700
Hold the bottle up higher,
Ms. Conroy.

621
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:22,000
Yeah.

622
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,266
It's like this.

623
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
No, I--

624
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:26,700
Oh!

625
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:33,367
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

626
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,800
I don't know what happened.

627
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:39,467
A butler moves quickly
to clean up any mess,

628
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,967
especially one they made.

629
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,266
Sorry, I just...

630
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,300
I'll use your--

631
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:44,900
Club soda, stat!

632
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:45,934
Right.

633
00:26:46,066 --> 00:26:48,400
Take him to the kitchen.

634
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:50,400
I can't believe
I just did that.

635
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:52,100
It's okay,
it was just a mistake.

636
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:54,133
No, every little thing counts.

637
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:55,767
I've seen her making marks
on her grading sheet--

638
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,266
Just calm down.

639
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,934
It's just a couple marks,
it's not a big deal.

640
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:00,867
I've made so many
avoidable mistakes already,

641
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,500
I could easily fail,

642
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:05,667
and unlike you,
I actually want to graduate.

643
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Okay, well,

644
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:09,066
I want to graduate, too.

645
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,667
No, you don't.

646
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,166
You've already told me
you don't want to be here.

647
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,033
Yeah, I don't want
to be a butler.

648
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,166
Every member of my family

649
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,567
has gone to an academy
like this,

650
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,266
so I...

651
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,734
I feel like I have to go,

652
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:23,500
follow tradition.

653
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:26,867
What would you rather do?

654
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,667
Cook.

655
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,500
Be a chef.

656
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:35,900
Open my own restaurant.

657
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:36,967
Cool.

658
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,433
Yeah.

659
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:43,500
You're starting to make
a little more sense.

660
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:44,767
What do you mean?

661
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,133
Well, my first
impression of you

662
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,700
was that you thought
you were too cool

663
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,767
for butler school.

664
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,166
Yeah, that part's true.

665
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,133
It's very true.

666
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:56,867
You're just like
the rest of us.

667
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,667
How?

668
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,567
You're trying to find
your path

669
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,600
without hurting anyone

670
00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:08,433
or letting anyone down
in the process.

671
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:10,600
You missed a spot.

672
00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:12,400
Actually, you missed,
like, 20 spots.

673
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:15,967
Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you.

674
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:22,433
Ms. Conroy,
you're one of a few students

675
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,000
I wanted to talk to

676
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:26,700
regarding your rankings
thus far.

677
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:29,533
If you continue
at this present level,

678
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:32,367
I simply can't pass you.

679
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,033
I don't know
why I'm not nailing it.

680
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,233
It's like I get nervous,

681
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:37,233
and I have stage fright
or something

682
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,700
when it comes to the tasks
I thought I had a handle on.

683
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:40,900
Hmm.

684
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:42,834
Well, you must devise
a way to overcome this,

685
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:43,867
and quickly.

686
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,934
A butler has to be alert, sharp,

687
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:49,767
and ready to focus
on the moment at hand.

688
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,533
I will do my best.

689
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:55,000
Good.

690
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,233
That's all, then.

691
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,767
You wanted to see me?

692
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,166
Yes, please, take a seat.

693
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,934
Yes, of course, I will.

694
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:18,400
Fine.

695
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:19,400
Okay.

696
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:20,433
I will.

697
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:22,066
Bye.

698
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,900
Everything okay?

699
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,433
Yeah.

700
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,800
I didn't realize
anyone else was down here.

701
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:32,934
I was just practicing
the table settings

702
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:34,834
for the quiz tomorrow.

703
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:36,133
Who were you talking to?

704
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:38,834
My dad.

705
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:41,000
He's just checking in on me,

706
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:43,300
making sure everything
is going smoothly...

707
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:44,333
Mm.

708
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:46,500
...and that I'm excelling.

709
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:50,233
Have you ever told your parents

710
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:51,934
that you don't actually
want to be a butler

711
00:29:52,066 --> 00:29:53,433
and that you'd rather be a chef?

712
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:58,266
Oh, yes.

713
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,266
Many times.

714
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,300
It has not gone well.

715
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,467
It's much easier said than done.

716
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,500
My parents and my grandfather
simply won't hear of it,

717
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:08,266
at all.

718
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,300
They've been in this
line of work for generations.

719
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,967
My mom's American,

720
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,500
I went to school here,

721
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:17,834
but she has bought into
this whole thing as well.

722
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:20,166
It's some family business.

723
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,266
Yeah.

724
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:23,300
I don't know what I would do

725
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:24,433
if someone told me

726
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:25,967
I couldn't pursue
the career I wanted.

727
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,800
What, being a butler?

728
00:30:27,934 --> 00:30:29,667
Yeah.

729
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,000
And this is all
because of that TV show

730
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:34,400
you were telling Lisa about?

731
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,967
Plum...
Plum hire M-mountain?

732
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,100
Plumshire Manor.

733
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:40,100
Right.

734
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:41,133
Yes.

735
00:30:41,266 --> 00:30:43,500
I mean, the show
planted the seed,

736
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,300
but once I researched
everything a butler does,

737
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:48,667
and everything
a butler gets to experience,

738
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,967
I knew I wanted that life.

739
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,333
Hmm.

740
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:53,433
What?

741
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:57,567
I just, I've never
looked at being a butler

742
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,734
as something you can aspire to.

743
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:01,500
It's always felt
like an obligation to me.

744
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:02,567
Oh, yeah,

745
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,867
no, there are very few jobs

746
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,867
that let you be in a room
with some of

747
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,500
the most important people
on the planet,

748
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,300
and help make their day better.

749
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:11,867
Okay, so the way
that you feel about butling,

750
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,900
that's how I feel about cooking.

751
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:15,300
Though I'm a really good cook,

752
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:16,367
and your butling is...

753
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,367
it needs some work.

754
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:23,667
And just when I thought
we were finding common ground.

755
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:27,867
Goodnight.

756
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,333
Goodnight.

757
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:42,166
When Mr. Wiloughby says,

758
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,600
you will have five minutes

759
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:45,567
to set one setting
in front of you

760
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,433
based on this menu,

761
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:49,266
you must also choose

762
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,867
which wine to pair
with the first course.

763
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,433
We will only be here
to observe and grade,

764
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,600
we cannot offer any help.

765
00:31:56,734 --> 00:31:57,900
- We got this.
- Yeah.

766
00:31:58,033 --> 00:31:59,233
Five minutes.

767
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:01,433
And...

768
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:02,667
commence.

769
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,266
Okay.

770
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,600
Whoa, okay, um,

771
00:32:06,734 --> 00:32:07,834
we have the tablecloth.

772
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,300
You do plates,
I'll do linens.

773
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:10,300
On it.

774
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:12,633
Yup.

775
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:15,066
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

776
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,133
The salad plate
is the one on the right.

777
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:18,600
- This one?
- No. No, no, no,.

778
00:32:18,734 --> 00:32:21,066
- The bigger one, the left one.
- I'll go with it.

779
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,400
And I'm gonna make sure
it's one inch.

780
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:24,266
Okay...

781
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,467
We have soup.

782
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,467
We need soup bowls,

783
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,500
You're right.

784
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:32,967
Those are dessert bowls.

785
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,500
Half the allotted time.

786
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:36,600
Shrimp is... before salad.

787
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:37,934
We need wine.

788
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:41,166
Two of these...

789
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,500
No.

790
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:43,600
25 seconds.

791
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,033
What order are these spoons?

792
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:51,033
I feel like
we're forgetting something.

793
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,100
What are we missing?

794
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:53,500
Time.

795
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:55,166
The centerpiece.

796
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,333
Yes.

797
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:03,533
Not only have you
forgotten the centerpiece,

798
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:06,300
but the choice of wine

799
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:10,066
would make the shrimp cocktail
taste metallic,

800
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,533
and you completely disregarded
the mousse selection on the menu

801
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,734
with regard to spoons.

802
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:19,967
I won't even address
the state of the tablecloth.

803
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:29,033
End of another week,
Ms. Conroy.

804
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:30,166
Mm-hmm.

805
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,967
Did you eventually find
the cufflink?

806
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:35,333
Yeah, it's, uh...

807
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:37,900
not looking so good.

808
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:39,834
Would it be possible
to get a new pair?

809
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:43,834
I shall add it
to your tuition.

810
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:51,500
Where is Jared?

811
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,800
I don't know.

812
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:56,767
The latest class rankings
have been posted.

813
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,734
Please use it as a, uh, guide,

814
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:01,934
and a motivational tool.

815
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,200
Oh, not bad.

816
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:14,700
The rankings are up.

817
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:16,200
Can I see?

818
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,433
Good morning, everyone,

819
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:31,767
just wanted to say goodbye,

820
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,767
I'm leaving today.

821
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,633
What?

822
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:37,467
You know, only like
60% of students make it

823
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,900
all the way to the end.

824
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:40,433
It's bound to happen
to some of us.

825
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:43,066
Hey, it's all right.

826
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,467
What happened?

827
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,133
Mr. Wiloughby made it clear

828
00:34:46,266 --> 00:34:48,867
that I do not have what it takes
to be a butler.

829
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,400
I'm so sorry.

830
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:51,800
Maybe you could reapply,

831
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:53,433
or, I don't know,
try another school?

832
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:54,700
Yeah.

833
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:57,233
Nah, sometimes, you just
have to know when to quit.

834
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:00,133
Good luck.

835
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:01,834
You too.

836
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:03,734
Thanks.

837
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:06,467
Goodbye.

838
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:09,133
I'll miss you, Jared.

839
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:11,433
- Bye, Jared.
- Goodbye.

840
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,433
Let me guess,

841
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,867
another late night studying?

842
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,133
You saw
what happened to Jared.

843
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:24,467
You're like the hardest worker
here, though,

844
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,467
I don't get it.

845
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,533
I know, right?

846
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,000
In the classroom, I'm great.

847
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:30,500
Subjects like language,
and manners,

848
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:32,333
and house management,
I've got down.

849
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:34,367
When it comes to food, or wine,

850
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,133
or table settings,

851
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:37,333
I'm terrible.

852
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:38,934
I can't help you there.

853
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:41,800
I got a 4
on my wine-pairing quiz today.

854
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:42,934
I got a 2.

855
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:48,367
You know who does
seem to thrive in that arena?

856
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,367
Henry.

857
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,700
Yeah,

858
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:52,266
that's because he has
the advantage of being a chef,

859
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,266
and he was raised by butlers.

860
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,100
Maybe he's a good resource.

861
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:57,400
Have you thought about
asking him for help?

862
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:58,867
No. No thanks.

863
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,433
- Why not?
- Because he's Henry.

864
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:04,166
He's been driving me nuts
since day one.

865
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,834
All right,

866
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:07,000
if you say so.

867
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,767
Besides, he doesn't even
like this stuff,

868
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,567
he's just doing it
to make his parents happy.

869
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,700
Yes, but he's still doing it,

870
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:14,433
and doing it well.

871
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:17,967
I'm just saying

872
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,967
it's something to think about.

873
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,867
You could have your own tutor,

874
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,767
and I bet you

875
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,100
he wouldn't even ask for a fee.

876
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:30,867
Think of it as a dance.

877
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,066
One, two, three, four.

878
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:38,166
The best way to do it together

879
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,433
is to form
your own silent tempo.

880
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,900
Now place the dish.

881
00:36:50,533 --> 00:36:52,000
And turn.

882
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:54,767
Your other left, Ms. Conroy.

883
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,734
Select your wine,

884
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:01,166
complete the circle...

885
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:03,934
...and pour

886
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:05,867
in unison.

887
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,200
Wrong wine, Ms. Conroy.

888
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:27,934
All right.

889
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:29,233
Once more.

890
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,967
Uh, Ms. Conroy.

891
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,667
a word, please?

892
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,767
I know the passion is there,

893
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,300
but you're making far too many
little mistakes.

894
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:48,300
I know.

895
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,633
I'm trying so hard.

896
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,767
I want to do better.

897
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,767
You're trying too hard,
that's the problem.

898
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,600
You're getting in your own way.

899
00:37:55,734 --> 00:38:00,233
Perhaps you need a guide
of some sort.

900
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:03,934
Someone who sees these tasks
differently.

901
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:05,066
Like...?

902
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,300
Well, I'm thinking,
very possibly,

903
00:38:07,433 --> 00:38:08,500
of Mr. Walker.

904
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,500
Oh.

905
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,900
Don't be too proud
to ask for help.

906
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,934
Thanks.

907
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:29,500
Is Henry really
the best person to help her?

908
00:38:29,633 --> 00:38:32,967
Well, she has the drive
and adoration for this work,

909
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,667
he has the know-how,

910
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,867
and the sense
to connect to the moment.

911
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,400
I think
they rather need each other.

912
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,667
Hmm.

913
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,033
- Hi.
- Hi.

914
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:53,133
There you are.

915
00:38:53,266 --> 00:38:54,133
Hey.

916
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:55,600
What are you doing in here?

917
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,767
I thought the chef could use

918
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,400
a few more herbs
in his cooking.

919
00:38:59,533 --> 00:39:01,667
I was just checking it out
to see what they had in here.

920
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,700
That makes sense.

921
00:39:03,834 --> 00:39:04,934
What are you doing?

922
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:06,567
Usually, you're in the library
during lunch.

923
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,166
Yeah, uh...

924
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,667
Well,

925
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,333
I just wanted to say that...

926
00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:15,100
I know you're really good at

927
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:18,467
all things to do with
food and wine.

928
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,767
Thank you?

929
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,433
Yeah, uh...

930
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:24,700
the second part is...

931
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:28,367
I was wondering if maybe,

932
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,000
if you happen to have
some free time after class,

933
00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:32,133
and you were willing,

934
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:35,500
if-- if you would consider...

935
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:37,967
...giving me some pointers.

936
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:40,834
You asking for my help?

937
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:44,700
Yeah.

938
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:47,834
You know, I don't know
if that's the best idea.

939
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:49,467
Why?

940
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,467
Well, uh...

941
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,667
you're really
into the whole butler thing,

942
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,100
you know,
and I'm not that into it,

943
00:39:56,233 --> 00:39:57,700
so I don't know.

944
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:00,500
I don't know if
I'm the best teacher for you.

945
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:02,834
Fair enough...

946
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,767
but what if I could
show you something

947
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,667
that would inspire you
to see how I see?

948
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,166
We'll always be here
for you to rely on, Lady Jane.

949
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,600
Advising you
means the world to me.

950
00:40:15,734 --> 00:40:18,667
This is unbelievable.

951
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,700
Yeah, it's so good.

952
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,700
No, it's not--

953
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:21,700
Oh, shh, shh, shh!

954
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:23,667
This is the good part.

955
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,133
You are more than
just a butler, Stevenson,

956
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:29,667
you are my greatest confidant,

957
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,033
...and my guiding light.

958
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:36,266
Thank you, M'lady.

959
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,100
Are you crying?

960
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,200
It's just so sweet,
the bond that they have.

961
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,633
He would-- he would get fired

962
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:50,600
for being
all up in her business

963
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:51,600
in reality.

964
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:52,633
We learned about this.

965
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:53,633
Client discretion?

966
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:55,033
- Yeah, but...
- It's important.

967
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,133
...he earned her trust.

968
00:40:57,433 --> 00:40:58,367
Okay, you wanna know

969
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,633
the most unrealistic
part of it?

970
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:00,700
Not really.

971
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:01,734
Well, it's when Mr...

972
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:02,767
What's he called? Clump--

973
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,867
Crumpet.

974
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,567
Nobody's named that.

975
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,567
When he falls in love
with the town baker?

976
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,667
Oh...

977
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,333
That would not happen.

978
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:12,867
Butlers don't have time for that.

979
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,066
They don't...
They don't have a life.

980
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,066
I mean, your parents
must have found time,

981
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,233
they had you.

982
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:23,900
My mother was willing
to give up her entire career

983
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:25,367
to move to the Duke's grounds,

984
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,734
but I have plenty of uncles
and cousins

985
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:31,066
who never had time
for marriage or for kids.

986
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,934
It's easy to get swept up
in the job

987
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:38,700
when it's all about
other people.

988
00:41:38,834 --> 00:41:42,166
I guess I never thought
about it that way.

989
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,867
Butlers make a great living.

990
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,300
It's a great trade, right?

991
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:46,433
Mm-hmm.

992
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:50,233
If you are willing
to devote yourself,

993
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:51,834
your life,

994
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,767
to the job, and to other people.

995
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,500
I'm not going to do that.

996
00:41:55,633 --> 00:41:56,500
No way.

997
00:41:56,633 --> 00:41:57,533
I don't want that.

998
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:59,600
I want a family,

999
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:01,600
and I want kids,

1000
00:42:01,734 --> 00:42:04,033
and I want the time to enjoy it.

1001
00:42:10,133 --> 00:42:11,467
I have to plug in the computer,

1002
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,767
um, and the charger's
right there.

1003
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,133
Oh.

1004
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:15,767
Well, let me retrieve it

1005
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,500
for you, Ms. Conroy.

1006
00:42:20,633 --> 00:42:21,500
Very good.

1007
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:23,567
Let me plug it in for you...

1008
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,934
Uncanny.

1009
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:25,934
Here we go.

1010
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:27,633
Let me find the outlet.

1011
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:29,834
Hey, look.

1012
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:32,567
My cufflink!

1013
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,867
Oh, but I already
bought new ones.

1014
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,633
Well, now you have a backup
for when you lose those.

1015
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:39,800
Ow!

1016
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:40,900
Jeez.

1017
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,500
Well, it's past my bedtime.

1018
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:50,533
I should get going.

1019
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:51,567
Mm-hmm.

1020
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,700
Wait,

1021
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:53,767
before you go,

1022
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,767
you didn't really
give me an answer

1023
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,667
about helping me.

1024
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:01,533
Okay,

1025
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:03,166
meet me tomorrow after class?

1026
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,500
Really?

1027
00:43:04,633 --> 00:43:06,500
Yeah, say, what,
6:00 in the kitchen?

1028
00:43:06,633 --> 00:43:07,500
Yeah?

1029
00:43:07,633 --> 00:43:09,367
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1030
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,800
Really?

1031
00:43:10,934 --> 00:43:12,367
- Really.
- Thank you!

1032
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,567
Thank you, I'll be there.

1033
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,667
Good evening, Ms. Conroy!

1034
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,967
So when anyone is cooking,

1035
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,200
the five basic elements
of flavor

1036
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:32,200
are very important
for pairing and balance,

1037
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,467
and they are sweet, sour,

1038
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,533
salty, bitter,

1039
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:38,066
and umami.

1040
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,400
Okay.

1041
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,533
No, do not take notes.

1042
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:41,700
- No, no, no, it helps me--
- Put this down.

1043
00:43:41,834 --> 00:43:43,133
No, I don't care,
put this down.

1044
00:43:43,266 --> 00:43:44,800
It's not... I don't think
it helps you, actually,

1045
00:43:44,934 --> 00:43:45,800
because what it does,

1046
00:43:45,934 --> 00:43:47,967
it gets you in your head,

1047
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,166
and you're not
enjoying the moment.

1048
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,800
It becomes work,
it becomes a chore,

1049
00:43:50,934 --> 00:43:52,033
am I right?
I'm definitely right.

1050
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:53,867
- Okay.
- It's no longer enjoyable.

1051
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,667
You need to get out of your head
and in your body.

1052
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,834
- Enjoy the moment.
- Okay.

1053
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:57,834
- We're in the moment.
- I'm in the moment.

1054
00:43:57,967 --> 00:43:58,867
In the kitchen,

1055
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,967
we're living life, okay?
Okay...

1056
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:01,066
You good?

1057
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,300
I'm good.

1058
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:04,000
Okay, can you pour
the rest of those for me?

1059
00:44:04,133 --> 00:44:05,133
Yeah.

1060
00:44:05,266 --> 00:44:07,367
How did you get
so good at this stuff?

1061
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,767
Oh, you know,

1062
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,133
I, uh...

1063
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:12,867
I just lived in the kitchen.

1064
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,200
Always.
I loved the kitchen,

1065
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,633
and the chef was...

1066
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,800
the chef was
really important to me.

1067
00:44:17,934 --> 00:44:20,033
I cared more about
what the chef was doing

1068
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:21,200
than what my parents were doing.

1069
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:24,467
Oh, man, it just always
smelled so good.

1070
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,900
It brought me
a lot of comfort and solace.

1071
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:29,300
It was like
a stress relief, you know?

1072
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,567
So your real life passion.

1073
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,033
Yeah, I guess so.

1074
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:34,033
Yeah.

1075
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:35,100
What about you?

1076
00:44:35,233 --> 00:44:36,133
Passion?

1077
00:44:36,266 --> 00:44:37,400
Yeah, you have
anything like that?

1078
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:38,734
Mm-hmm.

1079
00:44:38,867 --> 00:44:41,233
I would say my life passion

1080
00:44:41,367 --> 00:44:43,000
is setting goals.

1081
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,100
You're a very determined person.

1082
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:47,166
- I am.
- You're diligent, right?

1083
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,266
Yup.

1084
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,967
You have a really strong
work ethic.

1085
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,533
That's, like,
not what I meant by passion.

1086
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:55,533
Passion is...

1087
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:57,300
It's-it's-it's this.

1088
00:44:57,433 --> 00:44:59,300
It's this.
It's something you do for fun.

1089
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:00,734
It's something you do
outside of work.

1090
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:02,200
It's something
you don't strive for,

1091
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:03,333
you just love to do it.

1092
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:04,834
I guess
I never really had time

1093
00:45:04,967 --> 00:45:06,000
for anything like that.

1094
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:07,667
I think that's the thing,

1095
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,500
I think people
don't make time for it,

1096
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:10,934
but everybody needs to.

1097
00:45:11,066 --> 00:45:14,166
Everybody needs to make time
for balance.

1098
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,266
Where-- Okay, so, like,
let me ask you this,

1099
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,667
if you were gonna have
a weekend off,

1100
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,033
and you were gonna have fun,

1101
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:21,000
and were gonna go out
and do something,

1102
00:45:21,133 --> 00:45:22,000
whatever it is,

1103
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:23,033
what would that be?

1104
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:24,300
I...

1105
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:26,100
Emma Conroy, having fun,
what is it?

1106
00:45:26,233 --> 00:45:28,934
I'm Emma Conroy,
I'm having fun, and I'm...

1107
00:45:29,066 --> 00:45:31,033
watching Plumshire Manor.

1108
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:32,834
You've gotta be kidding me.

1109
00:45:34,433 --> 00:45:36,066
I don't know.

1110
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,100
I'm--

1111
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:38,367
Plumshire?
An old...

1112
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,367
It's a sad life.

1113
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,367
So, that's...

1114
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,667
No, it's not, it's just...

1115
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,333
If you wanna be good at this,

1116
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:45,667
truly good,

1117
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,200
and I know you want to, right?
You wanna be great.

1118
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,467
You need balance.

1119
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,467
It cannot be all work.

1120
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,467
You, as Emma, need balance.

1121
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,367
Food needs balance.

1122
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,934
It makes everything better.

1123
00:45:55,066 --> 00:45:56,467
And you, do you
practice what you preach?

1124
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,867
All the time.

1125
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,433
But wouldn't you rather
have a job that you love

1126
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:01,834
so that you can be
doing what you love

1127
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,033
all the time?

1128
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:05,200
Like being a chef?

1129
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:07,934
Yeah, I...

1130
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,066
I just, I just can't.

1131
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,200
I can't.

1132
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,033
It's complicated.

1133
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:15,533
No, there must be a way
for you to show your family

1134
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:18,133
that you're meant to be a chef
and not a butler.

1135
00:46:18,266 --> 00:46:19,600
Tell me how.

1136
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:21,533
I don't know how.

1137
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:24,100
I'm just...
gonna think on it.

1138
00:46:24,233 --> 00:46:26,000
Well, good luck.

1139
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:30,567
Mm...

1140
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,934
a delicious Cabernet.

1141
00:46:33,066 --> 00:46:34,300
Merlot.

1142
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:38,300
Right.

1143
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:54,233
Lisa told me
you wanted to see me.

1144
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:55,400
What's all this?

1145
00:46:55,533 --> 00:46:58,567
Yeah, I had a, uh,
I had a fun idea

1146
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,667
for a way to get you
out of your head.

1147
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,500
So, flavor and pairing
takes practice, right?

1148
00:47:04,633 --> 00:47:05,633
Table settings,

1149
00:47:05,767 --> 00:47:06,700
I've seen you do it,

1150
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:07,867
I know you can do it.

1151
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,133
You do it well,

1152
00:47:09,266 --> 00:47:10,500
it's just when there's pressure,
that's when you mess up.

1153
00:47:10,633 --> 00:47:12,333
Yeah, you're not wrong there.

1154
00:47:12,467 --> 00:47:14,100
So I came up with a game.

1155
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:15,266
A game?

1156
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,834
Yeah. We're gonna race.

1157
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,767
Randomly pick
a dining scenario.

1158
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,433
The first
to correctly set it wins.

1159
00:47:22,567 --> 00:47:24,266
Well, what does
the person win?

1160
00:47:25,567 --> 00:47:26,667
N-- A point.

1161
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,233
And what happens
if you get the most points?

1162
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:31,667
You just have to wait and see.

1163
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,667
Okay?

1164
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,033
Ooh. Okay.

1165
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:36,467
Let's go.

1166
00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:41,467
I'm nervous.

1167
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,867
Don't be nervous.

1168
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,834
Just read it off.

1169
00:47:44,967 --> 00:47:46,166
High tea.

1170
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,166
- High tea!
- Yeah.

1171
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,633
You ready?

1172
00:47:48,767 --> 00:47:49,767
- On your marks.
- Yeah.

1173
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,834
Get set, go!

1174
00:47:52,233 --> 00:47:54,700
All right, here we go.

1175
00:47:54,834 --> 00:47:57,300
Make sure you don't forget this.

1176
00:47:57,433 --> 00:47:58,500
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1177
00:47:58,633 --> 00:48:00,066
Uh...

1178
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,367
Cream and sugar...

1179
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,400
I've got it.

1180
00:48:02,533 --> 00:48:03,400
Don't touch mine

1181
00:48:03,533 --> 00:48:04,433
Oh, sorry, that was--

1182
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:07,100
That's my side,
that's my side.

1183
00:48:07,233 --> 00:48:08,734
I'm in control of this.

1184
00:48:08,867 --> 00:48:11,266
No, I don't think so.

1185
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,266
Out of my way.

1186
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,867
- And... done!
- Done!

1187
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,166
All right, all right, Conroy.

1188
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,166
You want to check mine,
I'll check yours.

1189
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,033
Okay.

1190
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:30,033
Let me measure this.

1191
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:31,066
Oh...

1192
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,066
well done.

1193
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,066
Mm-hmm.

1194
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,100
Actually this is...

1195
00:48:35,233 --> 00:48:36,867
this is perfect.

1196
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,200
Huh.

1197
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,233
Shall we go again?

1198
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:42,333
Okay.

1199
00:48:45,367 --> 00:48:46,700
Five-course dinner,

1200
00:48:46,834 --> 00:48:49,600
plus soup, cheese plate,
and dessert.

1201
00:48:50,734 --> 00:48:51,633
Okay, ready?

1202
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:53,533
On your marks, get set, go!

1203
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:55,934
Hey, that was cheating!

1204
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,400
And for the winner

1205
00:48:57,533 --> 00:49:01,400
of today's table-setting race,

1206
00:49:01,533 --> 00:49:05,500
we have my famous
peanut-butter cookies.

1207
00:49:05,633 --> 00:49:07,633
Ooh...

1208
00:49:07,767 --> 00:49:10,166
Mm, yum.

1209
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,500
Seriously, you did great.

1210
00:49:11,633 --> 00:49:13,200
Thanks.

1211
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:14,200
Yeah.

1212
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:15,400
That time,

1213
00:49:15,533 --> 00:49:16,567
there was something
about the competition

1214
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,567
that made me more relaxed.

1215
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,600
Is that weird?

1216
00:49:18,734 --> 00:49:19,767
No.

1217
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,934
No, you were having fun.

1218
00:49:22,066 --> 00:49:25,133
So your brain couldn't trick you
into freaking out.

1219
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:27,567
You just existed
in the moment,

1220
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,834
instead of
worrying about the next one.

1221
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,633
Yeah.

1222
00:49:31,767 --> 00:49:33,800
Now I just have to harness
that power in class,

1223
00:49:33,934 --> 00:49:34,834
on quizzes,

1224
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:36,800
and in the real world.

1225
00:49:36,934 --> 00:49:37,800
You can do it.

1226
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:38,900
I know you--

1227
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,934
What?

1228
00:49:44,934 --> 00:49:46,066
What is it?

1229
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,433
Mom, Dad, hey,

1230
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,667
what are you doing here?

1231
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,066
We thought we'd drop in
for a surprise visit.

1232
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,600
See how you're getting on
this time around.

1233
00:49:57,734 --> 00:49:58,600
Okay.

1234
00:49:58,734 --> 00:50:00,266
Yeah, everything is going well.

1235
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,934
Why aren't you in class?

1236
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:03,967
We're on a break.

1237
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,133
I see.

1238
00:50:06,266 --> 00:50:10,367
Mr. Wiloughby
has invited us for dinner.

1239
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,734
Okay.

1240
00:50:11,867 --> 00:50:13,834
Great.

1241
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:16,133
The Earl rang

1242
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:19,767
to ask if anyone could
read him a bedtime story.

1243
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,500
I assumed that he must have
brought his children, but--

1244
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:24,900
When Phillip asked him
what kind of book he'd like,

1245
00:50:25,033 --> 00:50:26,000
he said--

1246
00:50:26,133 --> 00:50:29,600
"Something boring
to put me to sleep."

1247
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:39,300
We're all hanging out
with your parents.

1248
00:50:39,433 --> 00:50:40,900
Why don't you join us?

1249
00:50:41,033 --> 00:50:44,467
Um, because
the sooner I finish,

1250
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,767
the sooner
I have to go in there.

1251
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,667
So I'm going to take my time.

1252
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,800
Oh, come on,
they're not that bad.

1253
00:50:52,934 --> 00:50:54,233
Okay, which story
did he tell?

1254
00:50:54,367 --> 00:50:56,900
It was the Earl story,
wasn't it?

1255
00:50:57,033 --> 00:50:57,900
Yeah.

1256
00:50:58,033 --> 00:50:59,133
Yeah, yeah.

1257
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:00,734
It was good.

1258
00:51:00,867 --> 00:51:03,166
I love them,

1259
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,467
but they do not stop talking
about being a butler,

1260
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,066
ever.

1261
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,667
Nothin' wrong with that.

1262
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,934
Come on.

1263
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:13,033
Come on.

1264
00:51:16,867 --> 00:51:19,166
"Something
boring to put me to sleep."

1265
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,967
Hey.

1266
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:27,166
Henry, come sit here.

1267
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,967
All right.

1268
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:32,066
I've missed you, darling.

1269
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,900
I've missed you, too, Mom.

1270
00:51:34,033 --> 00:51:36,233
So, this is Emma Conroy.

1271
00:51:36,367 --> 00:51:37,500
Yeah, we met. Hi.

1272
00:51:37,633 --> 00:51:38,533
Hello.

1273
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:39,633
She's, uh,
wanted to be a butler

1274
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:41,667
since she was, what, 10?

1275
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,667
Mm-hmm.

1276
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,066
Well...

1277
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,633
isn't that refreshing to hear.

1278
00:51:45,767 --> 00:51:48,166
So where are you looking
to butler after you graduate?

1279
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,667
Resorts, hotel?

1280
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,166
Private homes?

1281
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,066
Honestly, I would love
to work in a household

1282
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,633
similar to yours.

1283
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:56,066
There's something
that really appeals to me

1284
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,700
about working for nobility.

1285
00:51:57,834 --> 00:51:58,967
Hear, hear.

1286
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,100
Did you hear that, Henry,

1287
00:52:00,233 --> 00:52:01,600
very appealing?

1288
00:52:01,734 --> 00:52:03,033
Uh-huh.

1289
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:04,233
Yeah.

1290
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:06,800
Henry has been helping me a lot

1291
00:52:06,934 --> 00:52:10,433
with all things culinary.

1292
00:52:10,567 --> 00:52:11,700
He's quite the chef.

1293
00:52:11,834 --> 00:52:13,567
That he is.

1294
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,533
He's so good that, uh...

1295
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,734
I almost think
he should pursue that full-time.

1296
00:52:21,367 --> 00:52:23,600
Uh, yeah, yeah,

1297
00:52:23,734 --> 00:52:25,033
I was thinking
maybe there's a world--

1298
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:26,734
I was thinking, um...

1299
00:52:26,867 --> 00:52:30,200
maybe I could cook full-time,

1300
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:32,433
you know, see where that goes.

1301
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:34,533
Nonsense,

1302
00:52:34,667 --> 00:52:38,233
butling is in your blood.

1303
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:39,967
We've been through this.

1304
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,233
Your hobby can be food,

1305
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,333
but your trade is a butler.

1306
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,200
Right, yeah.

1307
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,367
Phillip, I just had an idea.

1308
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,934
You know,
the Count of Kensington

1309
00:52:54,066 --> 00:52:56,300
is looking to hire
a new underbutler.

1310
00:52:56,433 --> 00:52:57,567
Well, Emma?

1311
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,066
If you like,
we could inquire about it.

1312
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,433
I would love that.

1313
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,767
Of course,

1314
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,300
you would have to get
a letter of recommendation

1315
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:05,300
from Mr. Wiloughby.

1316
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:06,600
Which shouldn't be a problem.

1317
00:53:06,734 --> 00:53:09,500
He usually writes one
for all the top students.

1318
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:11,800
Oh, good.

1319
00:53:11,934 --> 00:53:13,533
I'll get one of those.

1320
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:16,800
So, Henry,

1321
00:53:16,934 --> 00:53:19,100
tell us everything
you've been up to.

1322
00:53:25,934 --> 00:53:26,834
Hey...

1323
00:53:26,967 --> 00:53:28,834
saved you a cookie.

1324
00:53:28,967 --> 00:53:30,300
Thank you.

1325
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:31,633
You're welcome.

1326
00:53:31,767 --> 00:53:35,533
That was so nice of them
to suggest a job for me.

1327
00:53:35,667 --> 00:53:37,533
Yeah.

1328
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:38,633
Yeah, they're, um...

1329
00:53:38,767 --> 00:53:41,200
They're great people.

1330
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:43,200
Have you ever
thought of just going off

1331
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:45,834
and becoming a chef
without their blessing?

1332
00:53:45,967 --> 00:53:47,133
Every day.

1333
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:48,934
What's stopping you?

1334
00:53:49,066 --> 00:53:50,767
Oh, I don't know,

1335
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,467
ending six generations
of my family's legacy.

1336
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,033
Don't let your parents

1337
00:53:56,166 --> 00:54:01,100
or the generations
before them stop you.

1338
00:54:01,233 --> 00:54:03,233
How am I supposed to do that?

1339
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:04,266
You heard them.

1340
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,200
I don't know.

1341
00:54:07,333 --> 00:54:08,600
Show them.

1342
00:54:08,734 --> 00:54:11,700
Just don't give up, okay?

1343
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,433
Conroy, you know what,

1344
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:19,300
if this whole butler thing
doesn't work out,

1345
00:54:19,433 --> 00:54:22,033
you could be
a motivational speaker.

1346
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:23,266
A backup plan?

1347
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,834
Yeah.

1348
00:54:24,967 --> 00:54:26,200
Henry!

1349
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:29,567
Time for your mother and I
to be going!

1350
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:35,834
Thanks for the advice.

1351
00:54:35,967 --> 00:54:37,867
Anytime.

1352
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,233
Hey.

1353
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,233
There you are.

1354
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:49,233
Hi.

1355
00:54:49,367 --> 00:54:50,700
What's going on?
What are you doing?

1356
00:54:50,834 --> 00:54:52,700
I thought I would practice
my place settings.

1357
00:54:52,834 --> 00:54:54,066
I just made record time.

1358
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,066
Wow, nice.

1359
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,266
So, this is what you're doing
on your day off?

1360
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,533
Yeah.

1361
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:01,066
You're forgetting,
I'm on thin ice.

1362
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,667
Yeah, but come on,
you're doing so much better.

1363
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,467
I'm glad you guys
feel confident enough

1364
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,734
to go to town
and take a break.

1365
00:55:06,867 --> 00:55:09,333
I can't afford that luxury.

1366
00:55:09,467 --> 00:55:11,433
Okay, what...

1367
00:55:11,567 --> 00:55:12,600
Let me ask you something.

1368
00:55:12,734 --> 00:55:14,667
What if I told you

1369
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,000
that there was a place
that exists

1370
00:55:17,133 --> 00:55:18,233
where we could go

1371
00:55:18,367 --> 00:55:21,400
you could one,
have fun on your day off,

1372
00:55:21,533 --> 00:55:23,500
and two, learn some new skills,

1373
00:55:23,633 --> 00:55:25,500
further your education,

1374
00:55:25,633 --> 00:55:27,934
would you believe
such a place exists?

1375
00:55:28,066 --> 00:55:29,800
No.

1376
00:55:29,934 --> 00:55:32,400
All right, grab your jacket,
meet me in 20.

1377
00:55:32,533 --> 00:55:34,400
I'm gonna show you!

1378
00:55:46,834 --> 00:55:50,800
So this place
has five different cheeses,

1379
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:51,934
all imported,

1380
00:55:52,066 --> 00:55:53,266
and all properly aged.

1381
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,967
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1382
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,200
And I see each one
pairs with a different wine.

1383
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:58,800
Yeah, see?

1384
00:55:58,934 --> 00:56:01,667
You see? It's enjoyable,

1385
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,667
it's also educational.

1386
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,667
Imagine that.

1387
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,767
The perfect combo.

1388
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,066
Right.

1389
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,066
Uh, how about a toast?

1390
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,867
To pairing!

1391
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,133
To the perfect pairing.

1392
00:56:14,266 --> 00:56:15,834
Ah-hah.

1393
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:18,100
I can fondue to that.

1394
00:56:18,233 --> 00:56:19,700
Oof.

1395
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:20,700
Bad, right?

1396
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:22,000
- Bad joke.
- Mm, not great.

1397
00:56:22,133 --> 00:56:23,200
Little tip,

1398
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:25,667
the wine should always
have more acidity

1399
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,834
than the food.

1400
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,767
So for example,
the more bitter the cheese,

1401
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,000
the drier the wine.

1402
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:31,400
Mm, good tip.

1403
00:56:31,533 --> 00:56:32,500
Mm-hmm.

1404
00:56:33,734 --> 00:56:36,233
You cannot beat
real-world experience.

1405
00:56:37,734 --> 00:56:38,600
That's it.

1406
00:56:38,734 --> 00:56:40,166
What?

1407
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,266
That's how you should
convince your parents.

1408
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,266
Have you ever cooked for them?

1409
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,333
Here and there
over the years.

1410
00:56:47,467 --> 00:56:50,734
What about one big meal
that showcases your talents?

1411
00:56:50,867 --> 00:56:52,834
A real knockout punch.

1412
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:57,033
Yeah, maybe.

1413
00:56:57,166 --> 00:56:59,033
Something to consider.

1414
00:57:02,934 --> 00:57:04,166
Amazing,

1415
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,133
just this little store
in the middle of the country.

1416
00:57:06,266 --> 00:57:08,133
It's the best vanilla ice cream
I've ever had.

1417
00:57:08,266 --> 00:57:09,233
Mm...

1418
00:57:09,367 --> 00:57:12,800
Also, take note,
pairs well after any meal.

1419
00:57:12,934 --> 00:57:14,433
Bien sûr.

1420
00:57:14,567 --> 00:57:15,600
Oh!

1421
00:57:15,734 --> 00:57:17,500
Wow...

1422
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:20,066
Beautiful accent.

1423
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,967
Somebody studied French.

1424
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,734
Yeah, it was
my fourth rejection letter

1425
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:26,767
that inspired me
to take French classes.

1426
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,900
Ah.

1427
00:57:28,033 --> 00:57:29,834
The fifth inspired
an art-history course

1428
00:57:29,967 --> 00:57:31,133
because the Finnish
school of butling

1429
00:57:31,266 --> 00:57:35,400
said I didn't have
enough culture on my resume.

1430
00:57:35,533 --> 00:57:36,633
It's so crazy

1431
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,333
how hard some of these schools
are to get into.

1432
00:57:39,467 --> 00:57:41,100
Feels like
it's harder to get into

1433
00:57:41,233 --> 00:57:42,300
than Harvard sometimes.

1434
00:57:42,433 --> 00:57:44,467
You know,
I've dropped out of a few.

1435
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,233
Really?

1436
00:57:46,367 --> 00:57:47,433
Yeah.

1437
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:48,800
This is my...

1438
00:57:48,934 --> 00:57:51,800
fourth butler academy.

1439
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:52,800
Wow.

1440
00:57:52,934 --> 00:57:54,033
You're so good at everything.

1441
00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:56,900
I thought I could
convince my parents

1442
00:57:57,033 --> 00:57:59,433
that I wasn't good at anything,

1443
00:57:59,567 --> 00:58:00,867
so they'd get off my back

1444
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,800
about following
in their footsteps.

1445
00:58:02,934 --> 00:58:04,700
On purpose?

1446
00:58:04,834 --> 00:58:05,767
And it didn't work?

1447
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,633
No, they saw right through it.

1448
00:58:07,767 --> 00:58:09,600
Hmm.

1449
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,133
Henry, I just want
to thank you for today,

1450
00:58:15,266 --> 00:58:16,967
and for helping me in general.

1451
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,066
It means a lot.

1452
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,166
Yeah, of course.

1453
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,333
I really enjoyed today.

1454
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:29,133
I don't know, I, uh...

1455
00:58:29,266 --> 00:58:32,633
I like spending time with you.

1456
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:46,066
We should probably get back.

1457
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,367
We have a lot of work to do.

1458
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,367
Yeah... yeah.

1459
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,400
Right.

1460
00:58:50,533 --> 00:58:51,667
Sorry.

1461
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,633
No, no, no, no.
No, no, that...

1462
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:55,233
I can't have
any distractions.

1463
00:58:55,367 --> 00:58:56,667
With my ranking not being great,

1464
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,066
- I have to...
- Right.

1465
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,066
I have to focus, and...

1466
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,100
Right.

1467
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:03,033
Keep my eye on the prize,
you know?

1468
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:04,867
I totally get it.
Don't worry about it.

1469
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,133
We're good, right?

1470
00:59:06,266 --> 00:59:08,967
Yeah. Yeah, we're good,
we're good.

1471
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,867
You wanna...

1472
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,066
You wanna walk up?

1473
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,066
- Yeah
- Yeah.

1474
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,066
Yeah, yeah.

1475
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,834
Okay.

1476
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:25,333
Ms. Conroy.

1477
00:59:25,467 --> 00:59:26,433
Come in.

1478
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,066
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

1479
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,367
Well, somewhat,

1480
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,867
but nothing that can't be
put aside momentarily.

1481
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,800
To what do I owe this visit?

1482
00:59:37,433 --> 00:59:39,867
I wanted to inquire

1483
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,033
as to what I could do,

1484
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:43,066
potentially,

1485
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,967
to make you feel as though I...

1486
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:47,967
Out with it.

1487
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,100
What do I have to do

1488
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:53,100
to get a letter
of recommendation from you?

1489
00:59:53,233 --> 00:59:55,433
The Walkers mentioned
a position opening up

1490
00:59:55,567 --> 00:59:56,433
at the Kensington estate,

1491
00:59:56,567 --> 00:59:58,433
and it sounds like my dream job.

1492
00:59:58,567 --> 00:59:59,767
A very esteemed position.

1493
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,867
Yes, very.

1494
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,367
Well, as of now,

1495
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,467
I can't in good faith

1496
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,800
give you a letter
of recommendation.

1497
01:00:08,934 --> 01:00:10,300
However,

1498
01:00:10,433 --> 01:00:13,934
if you continue
to apply yourself

1499
01:00:14,066 --> 01:00:16,367
and successfully
complete the final,

1500
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,200
I can reconsider.

1501
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:22,967
I would so appreciate that.

1502
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:26,467
I think collaborating
with young Mr. Walker

1503
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,066
is helping a great deal.

1504
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,400
It is.

1505
01:00:29,533 --> 01:00:31,633
Yeah, his passion
for everything in the kitchen

1506
01:00:31,767 --> 01:00:33,233
is really inspiring.

1507
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:36,600
Indeed.

1508
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:38,600
You know,
as a young underbutler,

1509
01:00:38,734 --> 01:00:40,100
I, too, struggled a lot

1510
01:00:40,233 --> 01:00:44,367
with the showmanship aspects
of the job.

1511
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,233
Got a bit of, as you say,
stage fright,

1512
01:00:47,367 --> 01:00:48,567
myself.

1513
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,300
How did you get past it?

1514
01:00:50,433 --> 01:00:52,533
By remembering

1515
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:55,100
there was a greater purpose

1516
01:00:55,233 --> 01:00:56,867
to everything
that I was tasked with.

1517
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,900
A butler doesn't exist
to dazzle.

1518
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,633
A butler exists
to be of service.

1519
01:01:03,767 --> 01:01:05,133
Hmm.

1520
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,600
I promise you

1521
01:01:08,734 --> 01:01:10,967
I will show you
I have what it takes.

1522
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,934
Good.

1523
01:01:14,066 --> 01:01:15,300
I look forward to it.

1524
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:18,867
Thank you.

1525
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,400
Good night.

1526
01:02:14,533 --> 01:02:16,100
We have come here today

1527
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,066
so you can witness
the role of a butler

1528
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,100
in a modern hotel.

1529
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:20,333
Later tonight,

1530
01:02:20,467 --> 01:02:21,867
dignitaries from around the world

1531
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,900
will gather at this table

1532
01:02:24,033 --> 01:02:25,567
for a five-course dinner.

1533
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,066
Some have brought staff
from their own countries,

1534
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,266
but for others,

1535
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,400
the hotel butler
must supervise everything,

1536
01:02:31,533 --> 01:02:33,767
fulfilling any guest request.

1537
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,233
Where does the ins--

1538
01:02:39,367 --> 01:02:40,934
Emma, come here.

1539
01:02:41,066 --> 01:02:43,934
This is Chef Shinkai.

1540
01:02:44,066 --> 01:02:45,133
He's the head chef here.

1541
01:02:45,266 --> 01:02:46,266
- Hi.
- Hello.

1542
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,934
And I should get back to it.

1543
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:50,100
Scallops don't sear themselves.

1544
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:51,600
- My regards to Mr. Wiloughby.
- Yes.

1545
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:52,734
Nice meeting you.

1546
01:02:52,867 --> 01:02:54,400
You too. Bye.

1547
01:02:54,533 --> 01:02:56,533
Come here. Come here.

1548
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,700
I cannot believe
I just met him.

1549
01:03:01,834 --> 01:03:02,800
I've...

1550
01:03:02,934 --> 01:03:04,000
I've been following his work
for years.

1551
01:03:04,133 --> 01:03:06,734
You're totally fanboying!

1552
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:08,200
No. No...

1553
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:09,200
Maybe...

1554
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:11,166
Yeah, I am.
I just...

1555
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,700
You should see
what he does with a risotto.

1556
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:14,066
It's unbelievable.

1557
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,066
Did you ask
if there's any openings here?

1558
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,133
I can't do that.

1559
01:03:17,266 --> 01:03:18,300
Why not?

1560
01:03:18,433 --> 01:03:21,500
First of all,
I'm sure he uses a head hunter.

1561
01:03:21,633 --> 01:03:22,533
Second of all,
I have a job already.

1562
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:23,834
Yeah, one that you don't want.

1563
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,467
What's the harm in asking?

1564
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,233
I don't have the skills.

1565
01:03:27,367 --> 01:03:28,400
I've had your food,

1566
01:03:28,533 --> 01:03:30,900
and trust me,
you have the skills.

1567
01:03:31,033 --> 01:03:32,333
How will you know
if you don't ask?

1568
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:38,300
Commence!

1569
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:46,033
I need two wine glasses.

1570
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:47,734
I'm on it.

1571
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:51,200
Teacups...

1572
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:53,867
- Teacup.
- Got it.

1573
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:59,633
Wine. Wine.

1574
01:03:59,767 --> 01:04:00,900
Check this...

1575
01:04:01,033 --> 01:04:02,266
One inch...

1576
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,734
And... time.

1577
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,200
Perfect score.

1578
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,066
Okay...

1579
01:04:41,233 --> 01:04:42,367
I'm third?

1580
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,133
Congratulations!

1581
01:04:44,266 --> 01:04:46,200
I mean it,

1582
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:47,734
you've been
working so hard.

1583
01:04:47,867 --> 01:04:49,266
I'm really impressed.

1584
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,533
Thank you.

1585
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:52,100
You're going to do great
on the final!

1586
01:04:52,233 --> 01:04:53,300
Hey, Conroy.

1587
01:04:53,433 --> 01:04:54,467
What's up?

1588
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,400
We're all heading
into dinner.

1589
01:04:56,533 --> 01:04:57,867
Come here,
I want to show you something?

1590
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,767
What are you doing?

1591
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,200
Where are we going?

1592
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:09,800
I cooked us a special dinner,

1593
01:05:09,934 --> 01:05:11,700
my favorite dish,

1594
01:05:11,834 --> 01:05:14,033
Beef Wellington.

1595
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:15,367
Just for us?

1596
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,700
Yeah.

1597
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:19,500
A surprise celebration
for you rising in the ranks,

1598
01:05:19,633 --> 01:05:21,967
but you have to be the one
to pick the wine.

1599
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:26,667
Okay, um...

1600
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,300
What do we have here?

1601
01:05:28,433 --> 01:05:31,033
Well, it has to
stand up to the meat,

1602
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:32,967
while still complementing
the puff pastry.

1603
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,300
Uh-huh.

1604
01:05:34,433 --> 01:05:37,433
So I would go with
the medium-bodied pinot noir.

1605
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:38,633
Spot on.

1606
01:05:38,767 --> 01:05:39,767
Perfect.

1607
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,800
Well, I had a great teacher.

1608
01:05:44,633 --> 01:05:47,333
Really, though,
you didn't have to do all this.

1609
01:05:47,467 --> 01:05:49,333
I wanted to.

1610
01:05:49,467 --> 01:05:51,500
Friends like to cook
for friends.

1611
01:05:51,633 --> 01:05:54,633
I'm a very lucky friend.

1612
01:06:00,367 --> 01:06:01,533
It's too bad.

1613
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:03,367
We'll probably end up
working on different continents.

1614
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:06,066
Hey,

1615
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,367
don't tempt fate.

1616
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,867
We haven't graduated yet.

1617
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,734
There's always time
to flunk out.

1618
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,433
Yeah.

1619
01:06:13,567 --> 01:06:16,200
So here's to...

1620
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,200
continuing success

1621
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:19,533
and, uh...

1622
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:21,800
and to not flunking out.

1623
01:06:23,133 --> 01:06:24,867
To not flunking out.

1624
01:06:48,834 --> 01:06:49,934
Commence.

1625
01:07:12,266 --> 01:07:13,467
What is it?

1626
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,567
This is the wrong red.

1627
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:16,567
One second.

1628
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,667
[Lisa, whispering] Hurry.

1629
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,867
And pour.

1630
01:07:58,133 --> 01:07:59,533
Thank you.

1631
01:08:21,266 --> 01:08:23,700
I am happy to say,

1632
01:08:23,834 --> 01:08:26,400
for all of you here
still standing,

1633
01:08:26,533 --> 01:08:30,667
you have passed
this evening's graduation exam

1634
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,367
with flying colors.

1635
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,467
You are all going to be
full-fledged butlers.

1636
01:08:43,867 --> 01:08:45,600
Ms. Conroy.

1637
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:49,900
Yes, sir.

1638
01:08:50,033 --> 01:08:51,467
Tonight,

1639
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,133
you impressed me.

1640
01:08:53,266 --> 01:08:55,967
You kept calm
and worked well under pressure.

1641
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,166
As a result,

1642
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,033
my letter of recommendation
will be off to Kensington

1643
01:09:01,166 --> 01:09:02,133
first thing in the morning.

1644
01:09:02,266 --> 01:09:04,867
Thank you so much!

1645
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,800
Earned and deserved.

1646
01:09:07,934 --> 01:09:10,400
You're going to make
a splendid butler.

1647
01:09:10,533 --> 01:09:12,133
Thank you.

1648
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,367
Oh, well done, Emma,
well done.

1649
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,100
Thanks.

1650
01:09:18,233 --> 01:09:19,467
Sleep well.

1651
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,633
Good night, everybody.

1652
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,633
Well done, you all.

1653
01:09:21,767 --> 01:09:22,633
- Good night.
- We did it!

1654
01:09:22,767 --> 01:09:24,000
Good night.

1655
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:29,400
There you are.

1656
01:09:29,533 --> 01:09:33,900
You sorta disappeared
after we all got the good news.

1657
01:09:34,033 --> 01:09:37,567
Yeah, I just needed a second
to take it all in.

1658
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,033
I'm happy for you.

1659
01:09:40,834 --> 01:09:42,767
I am.
You did it.

1660
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,433
Thank you.

1661
01:09:44,567 --> 01:09:46,400
I couldn't have done it
without you.

1662
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,367
You okay?

1663
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,967
Yeah.

1664
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:02,433
Yeah, I'm just grappling
with the idea that I, um...

1665
01:10:02,567 --> 01:10:04,467
that I'm gonna be a butler
for the rest of my life.

1666
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:06,667
Ha ha.

1667
01:10:08,433 --> 01:10:09,867
It's okay, though, it's good.

1668
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,633
It is.

1669
01:10:11,767 --> 01:10:13,900
You've shown me
so many good parts

1670
01:10:14,033 --> 01:10:16,367
about the job.

1671
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,700
But not enough

1672
01:10:17,834 --> 01:10:19,567
to make you want to be
a butler?

1673
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,967
What about trying
one last Hail Mary?

1674
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,066
What do you mean?

1675
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,900
Well, your parents are coming

1676
01:10:29,033 --> 01:10:30,433
to the graduation celebration,
right?

1677
01:10:30,567 --> 01:10:31,800
Yeah.

1678
01:10:31,934 --> 01:10:36,567
What if you ask Mr. Wiloughby
if you could cater it?

1679
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,133
You do not give up, do you?

1680
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:43,200
Never.

1681
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:45,900
You should always go after
what you want.

1682
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,900
Let me think about it.

1683
01:10:58,166 --> 01:10:59,200
And so
I'm personally thrilled

1684
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:02,867
to be graduating
this fine group

1685
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,233
of dedicated young men and women

1686
01:11:05,367 --> 01:11:06,900
who will soon be
joining the ranks

1687
01:11:07,033 --> 01:11:09,533
of one of the most
honorable professions

1688
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:11,400
in existence,

1689
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:13,600
being of great service
to others

1690
01:11:13,734 --> 01:11:18,900
and representing
the very pinnacle of decorum.

1691
01:11:19,033 --> 01:11:20,400
Ms. Martin and I

1692
01:11:20,533 --> 01:11:23,567
offer our heartiest
congratulations to them,

1693
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:26,233
and wish them
the greatest of good luck

1694
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:27,367
with their careers.

1695
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:31,567
So, how about
a big round of applause?

1696
01:11:40,867 --> 01:11:42,834
I'm so proud of you, honey.

1697
01:11:42,967 --> 01:11:44,166
Years in the making,

1698
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,400
and here you are,

1699
01:11:45,533 --> 01:11:47,100
getting everything you wanted.

1700
01:11:47,233 --> 01:11:49,100
Yup, years and years.

1701
01:11:49,233 --> 01:11:51,867
Yeah.
Thank you, Mom.

1702
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:57,266
Who's that?

1703
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,066
Oh, Henry.

1704
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,900
I don't think I've ever seen
your eyes light up like that.

1705
01:12:02,033 --> 01:12:04,467
Shh! Mom,
this is Henry Walker,

1706
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,834
and his parents,
Dana and Phillip.

1707
01:12:06,967 --> 01:12:08,133
Nice to meet you.

1708
01:12:08,266 --> 01:12:09,600
You as well.

1709
01:12:09,734 --> 01:12:11,633
I'm glad your mom
is here for this.

1710
01:12:11,767 --> 01:12:14,266
We were able to secure
a position for you

1711
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,500
as underbutler
to the Count of Kensington.

1712
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:19,166
What?

1713
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:20,400
You... You were?

1714
01:12:20,533 --> 01:12:21,633
Seriously?

1715
01:12:21,767 --> 01:12:23,433
Thank you so much.

1716
01:12:23,567 --> 01:12:25,633
I don't know what to say.

1717
01:12:25,767 --> 01:12:26,633
Thanks.

1718
01:12:26,767 --> 01:12:27,700
We're happy to help.

1719
01:12:27,834 --> 01:12:29,834
Henry speaks so highly of you,

1720
01:12:29,967 --> 01:12:30,900
and we can see why.

1721
01:12:31,033 --> 01:12:32,033
Aw...

1722
01:12:32,166 --> 01:12:33,300
You're going to love Scotland.

1723
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:34,400
It's beautiful.

1724
01:12:34,533 --> 01:12:35,400
Oh, I know I will.

1725
01:12:35,533 --> 01:12:37,066
I can't even imagine.

1726
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,066
Scotland?

1727
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,266
Oh, wow, that's far.

1728
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,934
Are you sure about this?

1729
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,266
Yeah.

1730
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,934
Mom, I've been working
towards this my whole life.

1731
01:12:45,066 --> 01:12:46,233
Yeah.

1732
01:12:46,367 --> 01:12:47,433
Mm, you're right.

1733
01:12:47,567 --> 01:12:48,433
Ever since
you were a little girl.

1734
01:12:48,567 --> 01:12:50,567
Mm-hmm.

1735
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,834
Thank you.

1736
01:12:54,533 --> 01:12:56,800
Have you tried the food?

1737
01:12:56,934 --> 01:12:58,266
Aye.

1738
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,400
The sausage rolls
were to die for.

1739
01:13:00,533 --> 01:13:01,734
And the sauce
on the shrimp?

1740
01:13:01,867 --> 01:13:02,867
Amazing.

1741
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,467
Right? You should try
the crab cakes.

1742
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,166
Here I go.

1743
01:13:08,367 --> 01:13:09,533
Mm, it's delicious.

1744
01:13:09,667 --> 01:13:11,233
- Oh, indeed!
- Mm-hmm.

1745
01:13:11,367 --> 01:13:14,166
Did the school chef
cater this, then?

1746
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,200
Actually, no.

1747
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:17,567
No, I did.

1748
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:21,734
What, as your final, then?

1749
01:13:21,867 --> 01:13:22,900
No.

1750
01:13:23,033 --> 01:13:24,667
No, Dad, I, uh,

1751
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,567
I volunteered
to cook the food for this.

1752
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,367
So well done.

1753
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,700
Really? Thanks, Mom.

1754
01:13:30,834 --> 01:13:32,233
I'm glad to hear you say that.

1755
01:13:39,533 --> 01:13:40,633
I'm, uh...

1756
01:13:40,767 --> 01:13:42,300
I'm very, very glad
to hear you say that.

1757
01:13:42,433 --> 01:13:43,700
Of course.

1758
01:13:43,834 --> 01:13:45,867
And the reason is...

1759
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,066
I was actually hoping

1760
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,633
you would enjoy the food so much

1761
01:13:49,767 --> 01:13:51,333
that you would see

1762
01:13:51,467 --> 01:13:55,367
why I think I'm suited
for a career as a chef

1763
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,533
and not a butler.

1764
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:01,033
Your skill was never in doubt.

1765
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:03,166
That's why as a butler

1766
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,200
you can go further
than anyone could.

1767
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:07,133
It's because
of your many skills

1768
01:14:07,266 --> 01:14:09,300
that you can truly
control a house.

1769
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,133
Hey.

1770
01:14:23,266 --> 01:14:24,133
Can I help you carry those?

1771
01:14:24,266 --> 01:14:25,133
No, no, no, I got it.

1772
01:14:25,266 --> 01:14:26,367
You sure?

1773
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,367
Mm-hmm.

1774
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,133
All right.
So this is it, huh?

1775
01:14:30,266 --> 01:14:31,734
Goodbye?

1776
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:32,800
I guess so.

1777
01:14:32,934 --> 01:14:35,767
Yeah.

1778
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,633
I'm going to miss
seeing you around.

1779
01:14:37,767 --> 01:14:39,033
Ah, I don't know.

1780
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:40,033
I don't know about that.

1781
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:44,633
I will.

1782
01:14:44,767 --> 01:14:47,100
Um... do you remember
when you fell

1783
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:48,467
and smashed all the dishes
on this carpet?

1784
01:14:50,033 --> 01:14:50,900
When I fell.

1785
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:51,900
Nice.

1786
01:14:52,033 --> 01:14:52,900
Yeah, that's
how it happened, right?

1787
01:14:53,033 --> 01:14:53,967
Yeah, yeah.

1788
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,000
I mean,
maybe I nudged you.

1789
01:14:55,133 --> 01:14:56,033
Mm-hmm.

1790
01:14:58,266 --> 01:15:01,667
- Bye.
- See you.

1791
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,500
I wouldn't have
made it through without you.

1792
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:05,533
Yeah, you would have.

1793
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,200
You would've found a way.

1794
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:11,266
Mm... I'm not so sure.

1795
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,767
I hope you know

1796
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,200
that you're a fantastic chef,

1797
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:19,467
you really are,

1798
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,834
and no matter
where you're working,

1799
01:15:20,967 --> 01:15:23,934
or what uniform you're wearing,

1800
01:15:24,066 --> 01:15:25,934
you'll be great.

1801
01:15:26,066 --> 01:15:27,967
You gotta promise me something.

1802
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,767
Okay.

1803
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,200
Take a day off,

1804
01:15:31,333 --> 01:15:32,667
like, once in a while.

1805
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,800
Enjoy your life.

1806
01:15:33,934 --> 01:15:34,800
Okay.

1807
01:15:34,934 --> 01:15:36,967
Outside of work.

1808
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:37,967
Promise?

1809
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,533
I'll do my best.

1810
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,800
Okay.

1811
01:15:47,934 --> 01:15:48,900
Okay.

1812
01:15:54,266 --> 01:15:55,233
All right.

1813
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:58,300
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1814
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,200
See ya.

1815
01:16:14,967 --> 01:16:15,834
The grounds extend

1816
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:17,033
all the way down to the stream,

1817
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:18,767
up past the foothills
on the north side.

1818
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:19,900
In the house,

1819
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:21,500
you'll be responsible
for every room,

1820
01:16:21,633 --> 01:16:24,667
including the master's study
and personal billiards room.

1821
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,700
On your days off,

1822
01:16:25,834 --> 01:16:27,033
feel free to go explore town,

1823
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:28,367
but I must warn you,

1824
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,400
as a new butler

1825
01:16:29,533 --> 01:16:31,033
it's doubtful
you'll get any time off.

1826
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:32,266
My first year,

1827
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,934
I believe I only had
a single day to myself.

1828
01:16:35,066 --> 01:16:36,033
Now, come inside,

1829
01:16:36,166 --> 01:16:37,967
and I'll show you
the kitchens.

1830
01:16:42,333 --> 01:16:44,200
The last one, he said,
"It's haggis.

1831
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:45,567
You eat it!"

1832
01:16:48,834 --> 01:16:50,600
Oh, my...

1833
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:54,433
I just don't know
if I like Nice in the summer.

1834
01:16:54,567 --> 01:16:55,700
Too many tourists.

1835
01:16:55,834 --> 01:16:58,166
That's what you said
about the Amalfi Coast,

1836
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,166
and you loved that.

1837
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:00,633
But that was different.

1838
01:17:00,767 --> 01:17:02,600
We had our own villa.

1839
01:17:02,734 --> 01:17:03,667
I remember that.

1840
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,767
Absolutely fabulous views.

1841
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:06,967
Oh, Positano?

1842
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,233
Beautiful.

1843
01:17:08,367 --> 01:17:09,300
It was our anniversary.

1844
01:17:09,433 --> 01:17:11,433
We had a lovely time,
didn't we, dear?

1845
01:17:11,567 --> 01:17:13,400
I bought her that pendant.

1846
01:17:13,533 --> 01:17:14,433
Aye.

1847
01:17:15,567 --> 01:17:17,166
That smells delicious.

1848
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,667
Beef Wellington.

1849
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,767
It's the Count's favorite.

1850
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,734
- Aye.
- Mine as well.

1851
01:17:22,867 --> 01:17:24,066
- Oh.
- Really?

1852
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,367
I'd like to propose a toast.

1853
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,533
Hey, honey.

1854
01:17:48,667 --> 01:17:50,200
It must be late there.

1855
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:51,767
It is.

1856
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,133
Well, everything okay?

1857
01:17:54,266 --> 01:17:55,400
Yeah.

1858
01:17:55,533 --> 01:17:56,600
How did that big dinner go

1859
01:17:56,734 --> 01:17:58,033
with the guys
from the House of Lords?

1860
01:17:58,166 --> 01:17:59,667
It went well.

1861
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,400
It was, um...

1862
01:18:01,533 --> 01:18:04,934
yeah, exactly what I pictured.

1863
01:18:05,066 --> 01:18:07,467
Okay, so why do you sound
so down in the dumps?

1864
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,400
What if I was wrong?

1865
01:18:15,433 --> 01:18:16,567
About what?

1866
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:21,433
What I thought I wanted.

1867
01:18:21,567 --> 01:18:24,967
Well, then you'd...

1868
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:28,333
you'd be human.

1869
01:18:28,467 --> 01:18:30,800
I love being a butler,

1870
01:18:30,934 --> 01:18:32,133
I really do,

1871
01:18:32,266 --> 01:18:33,467
but I...

1872
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,533
I don't know,

1873
01:18:34,667 --> 01:18:38,567
I want to experience
all of life.

1874
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:42,066
Look, whatever you decide,

1875
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,533
I love you,
and I support you.

1876
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:48,066
I love you, too.

1877
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,667
Bye.

1878
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:01,834
I love America,

1879
01:19:01,967 --> 01:19:04,800
but it's good
to be home in England.

1880
01:19:04,934 --> 01:19:05,800
Henry!

1881
01:19:05,934 --> 01:19:07,033
- Yeah?
- Come here.

1882
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:11,333
I want to make a toast.

1883
01:19:11,467 --> 01:19:12,800
All right.

1884
01:19:12,934 --> 01:19:14,500
Tomorrow is your first day

1885
01:19:14,633 --> 01:19:16,734
carrying on the tradition
of the Walker family,

1886
01:19:16,867 --> 01:19:18,967
and I could not be more proud.

1887
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,500
Smells wonderful, honey.

1888
01:19:29,633 --> 01:19:32,633
Oh, thanks, Mom.

1889
01:19:32,767 --> 01:19:33,834
See?

1890
01:19:33,967 --> 01:19:36,467
Cooking will always be
a great hobby for you.

1891
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,767
I ironed your uniform.

1892
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:38,867
I know it's something
you should do,

1893
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,767
but I couldn't help it.

1894
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,467
And...

1895
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:45,700
I think you should wear
my lucky cufflinks.

1896
01:19:55,066 --> 01:19:57,734
You must give Chef the recipe.

1897
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,266
No.

1898
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,200
Come again?

1899
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:07,633
I said no.

1900
01:20:07,767 --> 01:20:09,667
This is my recipe, all right?

1901
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,533
I created this.

1902
01:20:11,667 --> 01:20:13,166
I perfected it over the years,
and I'm gonna keep it,

1903
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:14,900
and I'm gonna serve it
in my restaurant one day.

1904
01:20:15,033 --> 01:20:16,467
Henry.

1905
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,800
The night before
your first day,

1906
01:20:19,934 --> 01:20:21,834
you really want to go through
all this again?

1907
01:20:21,967 --> 01:20:23,367
Yeah, I do.
I do, Dad,

1908
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,533
and I want you
to listen to me right now.

1909
01:20:25,667 --> 01:20:27,266
I want to be a chef.

1910
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,467
No, I'm going to be a chef,

1911
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,967
and I'd rather deal with your--

1912
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:32,900
your disappointment
and heartbreak

1913
01:20:33,033 --> 01:20:35,200
than live
the rest of my life unhappy.

1914
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:36,367
I love you, all right?

1915
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,300
I love you, I really do,

1916
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:40,266
but whether you give me
your blessing or not,

1917
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,166
I'm doing this.

1918
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,600
Henry...

1919
01:20:54,467 --> 01:20:57,133
You are going to make
a marvelous chef,

1920
01:20:57,266 --> 01:20:58,900
and I want you to be happy.

1921
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,333
Thanks, Mom.

1922
01:21:17,667 --> 01:21:19,066
Hi.

1923
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,533
Thank you.

1924
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,567
Wait!
Stop the car!

1925
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,266
Stop the car,
stop the car.

1926
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,433
Wait.

1927
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,100
Henry?

1928
01:22:04,233 --> 01:22:05,700
Emma, hey!

1929
01:22:06,967 --> 01:22:08,500
What are you doing here?

1930
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:10,266
I, um...

1931
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,834
came up from my parents' place
last night,

1932
01:22:12,967 --> 01:22:14,700
and, uh...

1933
01:22:14,834 --> 01:22:16,600
I did it.

1934
01:22:16,734 --> 01:22:20,734
I did it, I told them
I don't want to be a butler.

1935
01:22:20,867 --> 01:22:22,734
- Wait, what?
- Mm-hmm.

1936
01:22:23,767 --> 01:22:25,734
And, you know, it was, um...

1937
01:22:25,867 --> 01:22:27,066
it was because of you.

1938
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,133
You're amazing, Emma Conroy,

1939
01:22:31,266 --> 01:22:32,500
you know that?

1940
01:22:32,633 --> 01:22:34,133
You are.

1941
01:22:34,266 --> 01:22:36,433
You go after life,

1942
01:22:36,567 --> 01:22:37,734
you set your goals,

1943
01:22:37,867 --> 01:22:41,667
you achieve them,
no matter what anybody says,

1944
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,100
and...

1945
01:22:44,233 --> 01:22:47,266
you made me believe
that I could do that, too.

1946
01:22:48,333 --> 01:22:50,900
I'm so proud of you.

1947
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:53,500
What is this?

1948
01:22:53,633 --> 01:22:54,633
Where are you going?

1949
01:22:54,767 --> 01:22:55,900
Um...

1950
01:22:56,033 --> 01:22:58,367
I decided to quit.

1951
01:22:59,467 --> 01:23:00,700
What?

1952
01:23:00,834 --> 01:23:02,633
Wh-Why?

1953
01:23:02,767 --> 01:23:03,633
This is your dream job!

1954
01:23:03,767 --> 01:23:06,033
Dreams change.

1955
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:08,400
I want to work somewhere
I can build a home

1956
01:23:08,533 --> 01:23:09,433
and enjoy a family.

1957
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:11,467
I don't want to give that up.

1958
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,367
I realize it wouldn't be
a dream come true

1959
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,033
if I only got half of it.

1960
01:23:16,166 --> 01:23:18,033
Hmm.

1961
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:20,967
A family.

1962
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,900
You know, it's funny,

1963
01:23:23,033 --> 01:23:24,000
I mean, I was literally

1964
01:23:24,133 --> 01:23:25,066
going to look for jobs
around here

1965
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,834
so I could...

1966
01:23:26,967 --> 01:23:29,233
maybe take you on a date
on your day off.

1967
01:23:29,367 --> 01:23:31,200
Well, I wouldn't have gotten
any days off anyway, so...

1968
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:32,667
Right.

1969
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,700
Another good reason to quit.

1970
01:23:37,433 --> 01:23:38,667
I don't have a job,

1971
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,066
you don't have a job.

1972
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,200
No.

1973
01:23:42,533 --> 01:23:43,834
What are we gonna do?

1974
01:23:43,967 --> 01:23:45,934
Don't worry,

1975
01:23:46,066 --> 01:23:47,200
I have an idea.

1976
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:48,667
Oh, yeah?

1977
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,333
- Yeah.
- Huh.

1978
01:23:50,467 --> 01:23:51,734
But first...

1979
01:24:08,533 --> 01:24:11,100
I believe the kitchen
is your jurisdiction, sir.

1980
01:24:11,233 --> 01:24:12,100
I know,

1981
01:24:12,233 --> 01:24:13,934
but suite 504 just canceled

1982
01:24:14,066 --> 01:24:15,600
their chocolate-dipped
strawberries

1983
01:24:15,734 --> 01:24:19,533
and I really don't want them
to go to waste.

1984
01:24:19,667 --> 01:24:21,433
You know what pairs well

1985
01:24:21,567 --> 01:24:23,800
with chocolate-dipped
strawberries?

1986
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:24,800
What's that?

1987
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:26,333
Chardonnay, of course.

1988
01:24:26,467 --> 01:24:28,900
Ah, very good.

1989
01:24:29,033 --> 01:24:30,367
Very good.

1990
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,100
Speaking of good pairings...
