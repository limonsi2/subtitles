A FORBIDDEN ORANGE

4
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:47,026
'A Clockwork Orange'
was released at the end of 1971

5
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,895
in New York

6
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:54,400
and in January, 1972, in London.

7
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,506
The film had a big impact on me

8
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,044
but also frustrated me

9
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,947
because I didn't understand
some of the dialogues.

10
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,716
Of course,

11
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:14,887
many years later,
I found out that in the film

12
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,923
they were speaking
in a made-up language.

13
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:24,530
'A Clockwork Orange'
was preceded by the scent of
scandal.

14
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:30,903
Many said it was immoral and
cruel,

15
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,706
that it favoured crime, etc.

16
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,947
At one point it was like an
anathema,

17
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:45,785
a persecution even.

18
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,555
People didn't consider
the values of the film,

19
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:54,394
it was supposedly morally
corrupt

20
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,998
and this made Kubrick

21
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,868
decide to withdraw the film.

22
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:06,773
He removed it from the cinemas

23
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,209
not wanting to feed
into something that he said

24
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,880
was extra-cinematographic.

25
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,793
The film had a big impact

26
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,997
all over the world

27
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:08,468
and, at the same time,
it disappeared.

28
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:14,607
It had the aura of a cursed
film.

29
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,687
Spain is spilling its blood

30
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,990
in the defence of civilisation.

31
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,245
Back then, the majors had no
control.

32
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:30,116
Franco said that the money
made from American films

33
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,452
had to stay Spain.

34
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:38,391
He even made it obligatory
for all profits and royalties

35
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,793
paid for American films

36
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,029
to be invested in Spanish
production.

37
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,768
I've governed this state for 30
years

38
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,038
saving the nation
from the storms of our times

39
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,975
and, despite it all, I'm still
here,
ready for anything.

40
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,349
SPAIN IS WITH FRANCO

41
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,966
WELCOME TO VALLADOLID

42
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:04,810
In the 70s, Valladolid
was an important university city

43
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,746
and a big industrial city.

44
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,916
The Renault factory was here,

45
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,250
FASA-Renault.

46
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:18,491
Back then,
FASA had 15,000 workers

47
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:23,129
so the province of Valladolid
became depopulated

48
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:27,133
and a many people
moved to the capital.

49
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:34,040
Up until then, Valladolid
had been a typically rural city.

50
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,044
The rural landowners
were the ones in charge.

51
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,280
Everything developed with FASA
and blended together more

52
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,116
but the social differences
were still quite obvious.

53
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,253
The neighbourhoods
were very ordinary,

54
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,924
the living conditions
were terrible

55
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,726
and the centre...

56
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,929
The people that lived in the
centre

57
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,199
were bourgeois families
and there weren't many of them.

58
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,469
It's a city where the
bourgeoisie
are very connected

59
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:07,707
with the rural world
so it's rather conservative

60
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,843
and was very devoted
to Catholicism at the time.

61
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,312
It wasn't completely Catholic,

62
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,748
that would be excessive,

63
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:20,086
but it gave the impression
of a Catholic city

64
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,922
with deeply-rooted traditions.

65
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,758
The Procession of the Seven
Words
in Valladolid

66
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,428
covers the city on horseback
to the beat of drums and
trumpets

67
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,930
as is fitting for a town

68
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,999
with a clear lineage
of a noble cavalry.

69
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,034
The city has 20
confraternities...

70
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,772
There was also
a buzzing university scene.

71
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,308
There was a lot of activity,
not only in faculties

72
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,644
but in the colleges too.

73
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,345
There were lots of activities.

74
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:52,284
One thing that wasn't so common
and easy for people to access

75
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,487
was a normal level of culture.

76
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,923
We were at home most of the
time.

77
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,559
We did go to the cinema.

78
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,994
We went a lot.

79
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,331
Sometimes three or four times a
week.

80
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,037
UNCLE TOM'S CABIN

81
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,210
I worked in a bank

82
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:22,148
but in the afternoon
I worked at the family cinema.

83
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,688
The seating area
at the Roxy Cinema was my
playground.

84
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:32,525
I learnt how to run the box
office,
I helped them move the seats,

85
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:36,529
I hid behind the curtains
to see a bit of the adult film.

86
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,601
Back then, cinema
was the best distraction.

87
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:43,769
It was my world.

88
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,808
The first session was at 5 p.m.

89
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,278
and we wouldn't just
get 20 or 30 customers,

90
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,147
we'd get 400 or 500.

91
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,883
It was constantly sold out.

92
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,253
It's some of my best memories.

93
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,521
Your parents took you

94
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,424
and you grew up
with that fondness for the
cinema,

95
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,559
it was so important.

96
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,563
There are few places
I've been happier

97
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,431
than in one of those cinemas.

98
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,734
The lights went down

99
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:19,071
and you waited anxiously
for that beam of light

100
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:22,975
to fill the screen with images.

101
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,010
It was an absolutely magical
moment.

102
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,614
You were waiting
for one of life's wonders.

103
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:35,054
For me, the cinema
was a break from everyday life.

104
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,891
It was a fantasy world
but also closely linked with
reality,

105
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,927
with wanting a different world.

106
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,930
Through motion pictures,

107
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,934
people discovered,
people travelled,

108
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,970
people formed an opinion.

109
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:55,908
I think that cinema changed
the pace of culture in
Valladolid.

110
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:59,078
First, because of
the university scene

111
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:03,883
but Film Week
was also a decisive push.

112
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,785
I loved Film Week

113
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,687
because it changed the city.

114
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:12,892
Suddenly, there were new things
to see in Valladolid.

115
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:19,565
I came to Valladolid in 1964.

116
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,368
I had passed my exams

117
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:26,438
to work for the Superior Body
of State Administration

118
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,608
and I specifically
requested Valladolid

119
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,044
because of International Film
Week.

120
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,714
The festival was founded

121
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,652
by Antolín de Santiago y Juárez,

122
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,921
Manager of Information and
Tourism,

123
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,791
a man with a gift for
organisation.

124
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:51,630
He wanted to set up
a religious film festival.

125
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,036
The festival was an extension
of the Holy Week.

126
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,707
It started with a mass

127
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:06,679
which all of the guests
attended.

128
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,916
The fact that there were nuns
and priests there was a talking
point

129
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,986
and they actually seemed
the most interested in it.

130
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,321
RELIGIOUS CINEMA WEEK

131
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,224
The first session

132
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,359
was for religious films

133
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:25,364
and they showed a controversial
film
that people complained about.

134
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,604
But the festival had to expand

135
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,875
because there weren't
that many good religious films

136
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:40,613
and it started
to include human problems.

137
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,283
That was a big deal for the
festival

138
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,486
because it could now show
all types of films.

139
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,555
And it was called

140
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,625
Religious and Human Values
Film Festival.

141
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:57,229
It's an umbrella term
that covers so many things:

142
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,732
social cinema,
political cinema,

143
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:03,869
cinema from a humanist
point of view...

144
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,072
I said there was room for
everything,

145
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:11,877
even eroticism, because
eroticism
is something profoundly human.

146
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:17,283
It triggered broad discussion.

147
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,251
It was a big change.

148
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,924
They suggested risqué films,

149
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,625
difficult films,

150
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,627
controversial films.

151
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:32,197
You weren't sure
which planet they came from.

152
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,202
You probably couldn't see
what came to Seminci anywhere
else.

153
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,640
We started getting films
from beyond the Iron Curtain

154
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,510
that were hardly shown anywhere
else.

155
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,347
We had Felini's films,
Rossellini's films...

156
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,149
Ingmar Bergman.

157
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,785
We had La Nouvelle Vague too.

158
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,053
François Truffaut.

159
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,156
Finally, we managed to get
Buñuel.

160
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,327
And we showed 'The Milky Way'

161
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,795
and 'Simon of the Desert'.

162
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,832
It was incredible
but it got us into two tight
spots.

163
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,467
First with the archbishop

164
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,437
who almost
got into a fight with Antolín.

165
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:14,807
And then
with the cinematography course

166
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,876
which was run by Father Staehlin
and Father Landáburu

167
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,646
who were also
annoyed about the festival.

168
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,048
There was a kind of tension:

169
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,751
"We're going ahead with it
but it'll cause a scene."

170
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:31,790
They showed 'The Virgin Spring'

171
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,126
which has a rape scene
and all sorts

172
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:38,230
and there was a bit of a panic
because there were nuns there.

173
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,934
It seemed strange
to show Bergman's films

174
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,370
in Religious Film Week

175
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:48,807
and to see disturbing films...

176
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:52,711
you didn't know how to feel
about what you just saw.

177
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,117
It was a cultural effervescence

178
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,887
made possible by Film Week.

179
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,757
They showed films

180
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,493
that really shocked people

181
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,763
but everyone still
wanted to see them.

182
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:16,802
The cinemas were sold out
every single day in Film Week.

183
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:22,641
For me, Film Week
opened my mind up to the world.

184
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:37,256
Intellectual and cultural
curiosity

185
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,559
was rife among young people.

186
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,464
With censorship ever present,

187
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,966
they looked for subterfuges

188
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:52,871
and ways to keep the flame
of culture alive however they
could.

189
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:19,331
On the churches' religious
notice boards

190
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,733
next to the scheduled masses

191
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,105
you'd find the events' moral
ratings.

192
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,906
You could look up the films

193
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,709
and were only supposed
to watch the ones rated one,

194
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,711
suitable for all audiences.

195
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:49,094
Franco's regime was most strict
about cinematic censorship.

196
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,865
It was easy to do across many
levels,

197
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,803
not just in the traditional way
of cutting the footage,

198
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,207
but also by introducing
a verbal censorship

199
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,443
which meant changing the
dialogues.

200
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:08,280
There's the famous case
of the film 'Mogambo'

201
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,116
where censorship was used

202
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:16,255
to make the romantic
relationships clearer

203
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,358
but they actually made it
so that there was incest

204
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,894
instead of adultery,

205
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,431
which is a much bigger sin.

206
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:30,669
Besides those manipulations,

207
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,272
omissions and changes,

208
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:38,944
the worst thing was not getting
films
that were being shown elsewhere.

209
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:42,681
We didn't get the risqué films,

210
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:47,286
neither the erotic ones

211
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,521
nor the political ones.

212
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:53,559
For example,
Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory',

213
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,963
the anti-war film
which was one of his best works,

214
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,665
didn't make it here.

215
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,313
Francoism was terrible.

216
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:52,751
It was so dark and so brutal,

217
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,087
something beyond comparison.

218
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,424
Everything that was
most in touch with the times,

219
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:04,363
that modernity
that you longed to be a part of,

220
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,265
was completely blocked.

221
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,225
The Police claim
she has committed cruel acts.

222
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,493
Yes, an interesting case.

223
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,043
We'll try to make you useful

224
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,913
in accordance with the law.

225
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,559
It's time for
our third film programme

226
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,928
where you can see the film
'A Clockwork Orange',

227
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,632
produced in 1971 by Warner Bros.

228
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,601
and directed by Stanley Kubrick.

229
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,724
MR. HERCULES AGAINST KARATE

230
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,442
You either went to secret
or clandestine screenings

231
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,076
or you had to go abroad.

232
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:11,216
Visiting Paris was more
than just the Eiffel Tower

233
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,717
or the Champs-Élysées,

234
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:16,922
it also meant discovering the
cinemas

235
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:21,993
and Buñuel's films
that hadn't made it to Spain,

236
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,595
along with other directors.

237
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,801
On the weekend in Catalonia,
especially in Barcelona,

238
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:33,772
they organised trips to
Perpignan

239
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,075
to see films like 'Emanuelle'
or 'Last Tango In Paris'.

240
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:40,645
It was like La Rambla over
there,

241
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,914
everyone knew and greeted each
other.

242
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,884
Then they did a marathon
viewing.

243
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:49,654
The screenings started at 3 p.m.

244
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,990
and then they would run
to another cinema

245
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:56,528
because they had tickets
to watch two more films,

246
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,164
erotic ones, and others
that were banned in Spain.

247
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,712
I saw it in Montreal,
in Canada,

248
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:18,483
in 1973,
something like that.

249
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:23,488
I thought it would be difficult
for this to make it to Spain,

250
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,557
the censorship was very strict

251
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:30,529
and the chances of us getting it
were very slim.

252
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,464
I put it to the back of my mind

253
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:36,868
and then in 1975

254
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,803
I directed the festival

255
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,774
and the possibility of showing
'A Clockwork Orange' came up.

256
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,916
Warner Bros. called me

257
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:56,955
and said: "Hey, we're interested
in showing 'A Clockwork Orange'

258
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:57,923
in Valladolid

259
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,627
and the General Bureau
of Cinema has agreed."

260
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:10,468
The simple fact
that the General Bureau of
Cinema

261
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,904
and the distributor,
Warner Bros.,

262
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:18,343
were considering
giving Valladolid a chance

263
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,645
gave us a certain status.

264
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,748
The stars aligned
because, in February,

265
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,585
there was a post
in the State Official Bulletin

266
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:30,288
saying that the censorship
control system had been
suspended.

267
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,328
The regime's leaders also
realised

268
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,763
that this couldn't go on
for much longer

269
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,167
and maybe saw the film
as a way to show people

270
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:46,037
that they could be modern too

271
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,873
by showing things
that were controversial and
risqué.

272
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,976
A propagandistic way

273
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:54,913
of showing that the regimen
was starting to change.

274
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,350
In Spain, it was a milestone

275
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:04,155
to think that 'A Clockwork
Orange'
might be shown in cinemas

276
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,423
relatively soon.

277
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,733
They did an experiment
in Valladolid in 1974

278
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,770
and there was quite a commotion

279
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,372
at the doors of a cinema

280
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,008
that was showing
'Jesus Christ Superstar'.

281
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,346
There was a real outcry,

282
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,815
and it's funny
because the film isn't...

283
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,918
So much so
that 'Jesus Christ Superstar'

284
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:11,990
was authorised on a Friday
to be shown on a Sunday

285
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,194
by the Council of Ministers

286
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,329
headed by Franco himself.

287
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,665
With that in mind,

288
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:25,704
when they suggested
that we screen

289
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,307
'A Clockwork Orange'
we decided to go ahead

290
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,944
thinking we'd be dropping a
bomb,
and we sure were.

291
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,611
CONFLICTIVE CITY

292
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:07,879
PEACEFUL RALLY

293
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,214
THE STRIKE

294
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,682
POLITICAL STRIKE

295
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,050
PROTEST MARCH

296
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:15,353
FASA Renault went on strike,
so did construction...

297
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:19,591
The neighbourhoods were
destroyed,
there was a lot of social
activity.

298
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:23,194
Other industries were also on
strike,
fighting over agreements

299
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,463
and the improvement
of working conditions.

300
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,069
Lock-ins and assemblies
in churches were common

301
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,872
and some working priests

302
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:37,709
said they were sent by the
church
to catechize the workers

303
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,445
and then the workers
ended up unionising them.

304
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,656
MADRID, BARCELONA AND SALAMANCA
UNIVERSITIES ON FULL STRIKE

305
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,592
WARNING NOTES
IN UNIVERSITIES

306
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,928
Valladolid had
a population of 200,000 people

307
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,231
and 30,000 of them were students

308
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:04,502
so the political atmosphere
was quite combative.

309
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,212
In 1975,

310
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:19,083
I was studying English philology
at the University of Valladolid.

311
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,922
A singer songwriter, Elisa
Serna,
came to perform a concert

312
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,157
which was later banned.

313
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,495
However, the concert went ahead

314
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:34,999
because the ministerial order
stated

315
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,268
that the Police
couldn't access the campus

316
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:41,206
so it wasn't a problem.

317
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,877
But that's not what happened,
the Police came in

318
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:49,881
using their batons
to break up the concert.

319
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,583
We all scrambled to get out

320
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:56,287
but some were luckier than
others

321
00:30:56,354 --> 00:31:00,525
and several of us got a good
beating.

322
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:05,864
My father was Republican
and a reprisal victim and he
said:

323
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:10,768
"My girl, this is all very well
but ideas are one thing

324
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,904
and political activism is
another."

325
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:18,209
That concert changed the
University
of Valladolid completely.

326
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:22,480
To set an example

327
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,483
for other universities,

328
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,753
the government
decided to end the academic
year.

329
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,223
THE CLOSURE OF THE UNIVERSITY

330
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,825
The university closed,

331
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:38,196
a decision made by the
then-rector,
José Ramón del Sol.

332
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:40,932
He came out
of the Faculty of Medicine

333
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,369
and there was an assembly
in the street

334
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,037
with people throwing eggs

335
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:49,073
and calling for him to resign.

336
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:53,912
That made
the academic authorities get
together

337
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,881
and put up a note saying that,

338
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:59,183
because of the trouble
at the university,

339
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:03,588
all academic activity
was suspended indefinitely.

340
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:08,426
The regimen
was very much alive in
Valladolid

341
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,894
and other parts of the state

342
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:14,933
and the punishment for belonging
to certain political
organisations

343
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,668
even involved prison.

344
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,772
The Political-Social Brigade
that had been at its peak

345
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:24,742
and seemed to have died down
towards the end of the 60s

346
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:29,614
recovered its bad reputation

347
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,951
with mass arrests at the
university

348
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:36,587
and among FASA-Renault workers.

349
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,556
A group of students
from the university

350
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,525
were sentenced to years in
prison

351
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:44,529
and one of them

352
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:48,800
had what was supposedly an
accident
at the Felipe II Police Station.

353
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,668
They said he tried to flee

354
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,237
via the interior patios
of the station

355
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:58,609
but Cancho has always said
that they threw him

356
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:03,881
from inside the station
onto the interior patio.

357
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:15,193
Imagine all of those
continuous combustions

358
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,930
in a city
with a relatively small
population,

359
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,666
and then overnight

360
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:26,037
the Seminci announced
that, in April,

361
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,039
to celebrate its 20th edition,

362
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:33,077
there would be a special
screening
of 'A Clockwork Orange'.

363
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:36,614
It shook up the cultural scene.

364
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,717
It was a war-like challenge

365
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,587
to show something
that wasn't approved of

366
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,623
and had caused such conflict.

367
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,992
Expectations were really high.

368
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,427
Fifteen or twenty days
before the festival,

369
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,495
Warner Bros. called me and said:

370
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:29,634
"Look, we want to check your
copy

371
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,269
of 'A Clockwork Orange'

372
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:36,007
because we're not sure
it's in perfect condition."

373
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,912
So, the copy of the film
left Valladolid

374
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,046
and headed for Madrid.

375
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:50,121
But two days
after sending the film back

376
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:53,724
Warner Bros. called me again:
"Look, we're really sorry,

377
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:58,663
but Kubrick won't authorise
the screening of this film."

378
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,664
You're kidding?

379
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,033
We couldn't believe it...

380
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:06,671
It was just over a week
before the festival.

381
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:13,077
Kubrick didn't think that
Valladolid
was the right place

382
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:19,050
to release and present
the film in Spain.

383
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,787
He had probably heard
that Valladolid still had

384
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,556
an international reputation

385
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,594
for being strongly linked
to religious cinema.

386
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,330
I also think he heard

387
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:37,034
that at the Valladolid Festival

388
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,571
the 35mm projection equipment

389
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:45,743
wasn't good enough
to guarantee the screening

390
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,614
that he wanted for the film.

391
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,518
He was an obsessive
perfectionist.

392
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,691
I spent a whole week with him,

393
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,194
every day, for many hours,

394
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,931
when I started working
on the translation

395
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,800
and subsequent dubbing
of The Shining.

396
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,969
I'd done A Clockwork Orange
before

397
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:15,873
and I was thrilled to be staying
in a big hotel next to his
house.

398
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,076
One day,
I asked him for something

399
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:23,281
that I knew
he didn't want to give me,

400
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,882
an interview.

401
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,111
I never felt
like I was talking to a star

402
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,048
but that's what he was.

403
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:03,154
He had something
that I really value in people,

404
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:07,792
especially those
of such an artistic level,

405
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,995
which was an interest in others.

406
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:15,066
Instead of talking
about his films or Hollywood,

407
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,601
which didn't interest him,

408
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,503
he asked you questions
about things like Spanish
politics

409
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,872
and the Spanish Civil War.

410
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,933
He wasn't a proud and arrogant
man

411
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,936
or even that sure of himself.

412
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:55,273
He was a friendly person

413
00:37:56,274 --> 00:38:00,811
and one thing
really stood out for me,

414
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:03,614
something more important
than somebody's character,

415
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:06,851
whether they're good or bad,
nasty or nice,

416
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,320
which was his exigency.

417
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,290
The level of exigency

418
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:16,761
that he imposed on himself

419
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:22,633
wasn't just a quirk or a hangup,
as many people have said...

420
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,370
"He was a maniac,
he was crazy, he was a pain",

421
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,239
that's all been said about
Kubrick.

422
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,042
He was a maniac,
he was crazy, he was a pain

423
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,077
when it came to quality.

424
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:39,083
That's one of the things
I admire most in artists.

425
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:25,749
Legend and Kubrick
go hand in hand together.

426
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,151
They used to say...

427
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:31,088
and when I asked him
he just smiled

428
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:34,024
as if to say:
"Believe whatever you want",

429
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:39,763
that he even sent spies
to the big cities

430
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,334
in the countries where his films
were going to be shown

431
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:50,007
to find out whether the cinema
had the right conditions

432
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:53,244
so that the creation
that he had filmed,

433
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,447
shot and translated,

434
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,884
with him guiding the
translators,

435
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,151
for so long

436
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:05,956
was up to the same standards

437
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,359
that he demanded of himself.

438
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,798
In fact, I remember reading

439
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,334
that even for the premier in New
York

440
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:21,672
he demanded a certain size
screen.

441
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:24,475
If Stanley Kubrick thought

442
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:28,612
that instead of showing it
at Madrid's Gran Vía

443
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,114
or Lope de Vega cinemas,

444
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,550
it should be shown
at the Carlos III Cinema,

445
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,718
a much less important one,

446
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,922
it would premier at the Carlos
III
because he said so

447
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:41,225
and he thought his film
was right for that cinema.

448
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:45,629
He was capable of refusing
to screen one of his films

449
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:50,234
because the colour of the room
didn't go well enough

450
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,870
with the colours in the film

451
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,306
so he wouldn't let it go ahead.

452
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:59,810
He had full control
over the exploitation of his
film.

453
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:02,513
He wanted to control everything

454
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:05,182
from production
and management to exhibition,

455
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:06,984
which the big majors do
nowadays.

456
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,188
Warner Bros. were very
interested

457
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:14,959
in showing the film in
Valladolid

458
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:17,928
which would open the doors

459
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:22,933
for the possible normal
commercial distribution of the
film.

460
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:27,571
They called me and said:
"We're going to work on Kubrick

461
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:29,773
and try to get his permission".

462
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:37,448
Warner Bros.
sent one of their managers,

463
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:40,351
Angel Corbi, to London

464
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:45,723
to convince Kubrick to authorise

465
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,926
the screening
of the film in Valladolid.

466
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:54,164
He came to see me
when he got back

467
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,600
and told me to write him a
letter

468
00:43:56,667 --> 00:44:01,171
saying that the film
would be screened

469
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:03,273
at the University of Valladolid.

470
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,343
He thought that telling him

471
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:10,347
that the film
would be shown exclusively

472
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,950
at the University

473
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,353
might convince him
to give his permission.

474
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:20,791
It was our only chance
and we had to give it a go.

475
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,629
I wrote a letter explaining

476
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:31,068
about the festival's
personality,

477
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,270
what our approach was,

478
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,906
that it was progressive

479
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,443
and the film would be screened

480
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,512
for the university.

481
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,884
That's how we got Kubrick
to give us his permission.

482
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:28,492
That the festival management,

483
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,894
Romero with his letter

484
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,164
and the representative
from Warner Bros. Spain,

485
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:39,636
did something all too common
among epic Spanish characters,

486
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,607
who use every trick in the book

487
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,876
to make things happen that,

488
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,080
seen from any other angle,
are absolutely impossible.

489
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,283
Although I'd said that the film

490
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,652
was going to be shown
at the university,

491
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,156
I didn't really trick him

492
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:04,962
because the audience
that watched it in the Carrión

493
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:09,133
was exclusively from the
university.

494
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:12,169
The university world was fired
up,

495
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,972
coming off the back
of an exceptional situation.

496
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,674
The fact that a film was being
shown

497
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,944
that had been banned
and censored for four years

498
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:22,613
since its release

499
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:27,885
made the university students

500
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:31,555
lose control,

501
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:35,125
it was a reward,
a cultural uprising.

502
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,761
You had to go!

503
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:57,114
'A Clockwork Orange'
was such an attraction,

504
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,449
an unhealthy one,
you might say,

505
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,453
and people queued
as far as the eye could see.

506
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:09,193
I remember the cinema
surrounded by people waiting.

507
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,528
I was in that queue

508
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,730
and people even
brought sleeping bags.

509
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:17,067
Some people slept out there
all night.

510
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,469
They were taking it in turns.

511
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,872
Two hours each and then switch.

512
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:25,542
I remember at one point
the Police went by,

513
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,277
maybe somebody said something,

514
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,746
and then charged

515
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,281
scattering the queue

516
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,317
only for it to reform later on.

517
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:37,921
And the next day they rushed in

518
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:42,626
as if they'd been tied down,
everyone running to get there
first.

519
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:49,433
When the tickets
were supposed to go on sale,

520
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:53,370
they called me
and said there was a problem,

521
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:56,473
there were no tickets
left at the Carrión.

522
00:47:57,307 --> 00:48:00,711
"No tickets?
But they're not even on sale
yet."

523
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:05,449
"Yes, but there are no tickets
for 'A Clockwork Orange'."

524
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:10,487
We went straight over.

525
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:15,626
When we saw the queue,
Carmelo and I got a shock.

526
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,095
We thought:
"This is going to get messy."

527
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:22,032
We asked the ticket operator
what was wrong.

528
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:25,869
"Sir, the owner of the cinema,

529
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:30,574
has given all of the tickets
for 'A Clockwork Orange'

530
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:34,311
to their friends, contacts, etc.

531
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,747
and there are none left."

532
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:40,851
None of the people waiting
outside

533
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,887
could get in
because there were no tickets.

534
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,589
"What do you mean?

535
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,991
What am I going to do
with all of these people

536
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,928
who have been queueing
for over 24 hours

537
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:53,997
waiting to see the film?"

538
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:56,133
"I don't know,
there are no tickets."

539
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:00,370
They cancelled the tickets
that had been assigned
beforehand.

540
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,506
They brought out some new
tickets,

541
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,642
gave them
to the ticket operator and said:

542
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,211
"Use these ones".

543
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:14,251
The poor woman
looked like she'd just seen a
ghost.

544
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:18,155
He had given one thousand
tickets

545
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:22,793
to all the people
who wanted to see the film

546
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,294
and hadn't queued.

547
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:28,532
It had a big impact
but it was well organised

548
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:30,033
and sorted out properly.

549
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:34,371
The tickets sold out
immediately.

550
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:38,809
The only inconvenience,
besides spending the night
outside,

551
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,912
was that lots of people in the
queue

552
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:47,050
were planning to buy ten or
twelve
tickets for their friends

553
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:50,887
but were met
with the unpleasant surprise

554
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:55,625
that the organisers were only
selling
two tickets per person.

555
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:59,830
So the friend that got to the
front
was only given two tickets

556
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,365
to share with everyone...

557
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,768
it was a big disappointment.

558
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:09,272
We were such good friends
that we drew straws for the
tickets

559
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,843
and my husband and I
ended up with them

560
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,945
so we went to see it

561
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,347
and our expectations were very
high.

562
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:24,187
There was an organised way
to pick up the tickets

563
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,990
and enter the cinema
in an orderly fashion.

564
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,027
My role at the cinema

565
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:35,065
was to make sure nothing went
wrong
during the screening.

566
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:38,702
The city was divided:
those who were excited

567
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:41,438
and those who sat at the front
saying the rosary,

568
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:42,973
they couldn't believe it.

569
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:45,308
Peace wasn't guaranteed.

570
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:50,113
The previous year a film
by Carlos Saura had been shown,

571
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,615
'Cousin Angelica'.

572
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:55,719
I went to see it in Gijón
and they stopped the film

573
00:50:55,786 --> 00:51:00,757
because Falange,
very right-wing people

574
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:03,727
didn't like how they were
portrayed.

575
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:08,331
The Police had their eye on it.

576
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:14,371
There was a small group
of anti-riot police in the
cinema.

577
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,706
They were keeping an eye
on what was going on.

578
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:24,047
I decided to go up
to the projection booth

579
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:28,752
to make sure that nothing went
wrong

580
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:31,354
and that everything
was running smoothly.

581
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,296
I watched it from up here,
from where we're filming.

582
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,765
It was full to the rafters.

583
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:44,835
Everyone was absolutely silent,
there wasn't a sound.

584
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,903
Silent and excited

585
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:50,240
to see what we'd waited
all night for,

586
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:53,710
what it was like,
we didn't want to miss a thing.

587
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,775
Half way through the film,

588
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,845
the Police rang me

589
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,715
to say there was a bomb
in the cinema.

590
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:34,050
Oh my God...

591
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:37,988
Back then, bomb alerts

592
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:41,558
were relatively common

593
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:47,564
at cultural and problematic
events.

594
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:51,268
Calling up and saying:

595
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:54,471
"Hey, there's a bomb
in such a such place"

596
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:57,874
meant the activity would be
stopped

597
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:02,712
and implied no risk
for the person who called it in.

598
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:06,449
I decided to take a chance
and I told him:

599
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,186
"Look, sir, I'm sorry

600
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:14,024
but I'll be held responsible
for not stopping the screening.

601
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:16,993
We're half way through,

602
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:19,196
and after everything that's
happened,

603
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:23,767
we'll see it through to the
end."

604
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:34,811
I was impressed by the film.

605
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:39,015
It was visually striking.

606
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:43,553
The whole set design is
incredible.
It's brutalist.

607
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,791
The setting is so modern.

608
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:48,925
The colours,

609
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:50,961
the clothes...

610
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:55,966
Pop iconography
was so interesting to us back
then.

611
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,069
I thought
it was absolutely fantastic,

612
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:01,771
very clever, very well done,
very well performed.

613
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:05,709
Malcolm McDowell
with that evil face and that
eye...

614
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:25,755
It's also striking
the way they try to cure him.

615
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:33,596
With his eyes held open

616
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:38,968
to make him watch the scenes
of violence and everything...

617
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,475
I remember that the music...

618
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:58,214
perfectly matched
the scenes of violence.

619
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:17,834
It made me feel quite ill,

620
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,703
I'd never seen violence like it.

621
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:26,876
There were some scenes
that I couldn't even watch

622
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,912
because they were too
disturbing.

623
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:40,290
I started to feel like throwing
up,

624
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:41,925
I didn't know what to do...

625
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:49,265
To be honest,

626
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,304
I was surprised
at how well-thought-out it was,

627
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:59,776
even with that
constant injection of violence.

628
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:15,158
It explains
the whole phenomenon of
domination

629
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:18,228
between people,
castes and classes,

630
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,929
and the State's domination of
people.

631
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,625
It was about a type of violence

632
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:52,295
that we saw in the streets
quite often.

633
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:58,268
In Valladolid,
we had friends in prison...

634
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,439
and a friend who had been thrown

635
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:06,109
from the window
of the Police station.

636
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:12,882
That was what we saw
from 1971 or 1972

637
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:16,085
up until the vote
for the constitution.

638
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,245
It was a very disturbing film,

639
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:45,648
one that doesn't leave you
indifferent.

640
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:48,718
It caused a commotion,

641
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:51,287
it's one of the films
that made the most noise.

642
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:54,223
The film?
What can I say? I didn't like
it.

643
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,292
It was very unpleasant...

644
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,895
but it's a great film.

645
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:02,532
It's astonishing

646
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,568
because of how it's made

647
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:08,037
and the genius behind it.

648
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,472
I absolutely loved it.

649
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,876
I don't know if I should say
this...
but I found it really funny.

650
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:18,114
I really enjoyed myself
and the end is great.

651
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,959
When the screening was over
everyone started clapping

652
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:35,598
but nothing untoward happened.

653
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:39,268
People were amazed by the film,

654
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:43,673
in awe of Kubrick's directing,

655
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:47,677
how powerful the film was,
but that was all.

656
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:51,447
Back then, it was trendy
to have a film forum.

657
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:56,986
When we saw
a Woody Allen or Buñuel film

658
01:00:57,086 --> 01:01:00,623
we always commented
and reflected on it,

659
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:03,593
something that could go on for
days

660
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,762
when you met up with your
friends.

661
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:11,534
This film didn't give rise
to that kind of film forum.

662
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:14,704
This may seem absurd...

663
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,373
Afterwards,
they seemed almost frustrated.

664
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,544
I don't know
what they were expecting to
see...

665
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:23,513
One thing we mustn't forget

666
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:26,549
is the mark
that censorship leaves

667
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,685
on a cultural product.

668
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:32,689
It created certain expectations
and a special interest

669
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:37,794
regardless of whether they ended
up
watching a masterpiece or not.

670
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:40,863
It's like when
you're getting ready for a trip

671
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:45,001
and you enjoy the planning
more than the trip itself.

672
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:48,838
I think I've seen films
that I like more

673
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:52,909
in terms of the plot and content

674
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:55,044
but I'll never forget that film.

675
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:58,448
It's a really important film
that marked a before and after

676
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:01,918
in the behaviour
of viewers and critics

677
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:04,153
and the people
from Valladolid in general.

678
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:08,691
And that's the story of the film
at the Valladolid festival.

679
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:22,472
The festival was elevated

680
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,640
by the screening
of 'A Clockwork Orange'

681
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:28,077
but some films
didn't cause such a hype...

682
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:30,913
For example, the first film
by Steven Spielberg

683
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:32,749
that was shown at the festival.

684
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:43,286
A few months later,
the film was authorised for
screening

685
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:47,590
in art-house cinemas.

686
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:51,694
It was shown
in the Cid Campeador in Madrid.

687
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:58,935
But we had to wait two more
years
for the commercial dubbed
version.

688
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:05,308
Of all the film translation
projects
that I've done,

689
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,910
it was definitely the most
difficult.

690
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,613
The film was shot
in a made-up language.

691
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,654
Burgess, the novelist, said:
"I'm going to do it

692
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:20,756
in a language that's all mixed
up."

693
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:25,962
He blended the Queen's English
with some contemporary English
slang

694
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:29,165
and also some Russian

695
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:32,068
inspired by
what he heard being spoken

696
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:36,906
by a group of dandies
from Saint Petersburg.

697
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:43,446
The head,
in the original novel and film,

698
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:44,847
is called the "Gulliver"...

699
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:49,719
It's taken from that famous
novel,

700
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:51,053
Gulliver's Travels.

701
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,326
I translated it as the
"quijotera".

702
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,732
I did the translation,

703
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:07,503
Saura, with Kubrick's guidelines
that he sent from London,

704
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:09,438
did the dubbing

705
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:11,908
and the film was released,

706
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:16,012
as I like to joke, "openly",

707
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:19,282
not just
for select audiences like
before.

708
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:23,486
'A Clockwork Orange' was one
of the biggest phenomena in
Spain,

709
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:26,088
on a par with Star Wars.

710
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:27,590
It was shown for a year.

711
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:39,335
FRANCO IS DEAD

712
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:03,452
Valladolid is a city
with a certain amount of
conservatism

713
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,920
and a cultural effervescence

714
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:07,123
that was already around in the
70s

715
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:10,493
with Seminci and the screening
of 'A Clockwork Orange'

716
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,562
which people still remember
and talk about.

717
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:18,434
I think it still has
a big impact on the city.

718
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,070
I grew up with that legend.

719
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:27,043
It's always difficult to know
what's true and what's not.

720
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:30,012
I think it's best
to just believe the legend.

721
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:34,917
It's mainly the young people
who don't know

722
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:36,652
about the screening

723
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,322
because they're disconnected
from classical cinema.

724
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:43,125
From my experience as a teacher,

725
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:45,561
I'm pretty sure that the
majority
of new generations

726
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,196
haven't even seen it.

727
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:51,033
No, I haven't seen it.

728
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:54,003
I've never heard
of 'A Clockwork Orange' or
Kubrick.

729
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,873
It rings a bell. I've heard
of the title, but that's it.

730
01:07:57,973 --> 01:07:59,375
I know nothing about it.

731
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:03,879
I know it was revolutionary
in its time, but that's all.

732
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:05,681
I've heard
it's uncomfortable to watch

733
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,250
but I don't know what it's
about.

734
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:09,785
You recognise the iconography.

735
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:13,189
You know it's from the film
even if you haven't seen it.

736
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:16,292
It's still
an aesthetically powerful film.

737
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:17,493
It's become an icon.

738
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,628
At Halloween,
people dress up as droogs...

739
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:21,931
The hats...

740
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:24,633
It's part of pop culture.

741
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:27,837
It means that
they recognise some images

742
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:30,806
like with other films
but it doesn't mean they've seen
it.

743
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:32,441
No, I haven't seen it.

744
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:34,743
The aesthetics,
an episode of 'The Simpsons'...

745
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:37,913
An episode
of 'The Simpsons' or other
series.

746
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:40,916
And they don't know the plot
or what it's about...

747
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:44,787
The only thing I know
about 'A Clockwork Orange' are
memes

748
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:47,223
or jokes I've seen on the
Internet.

749
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:49,625
I'm sure the film
still has the ability

750
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:53,162
to awaken people's consciences
and churn their stomachs.

751
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:56,332
It depends on how sensitive they
are.

752
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:08,277
I think the way it started

753
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:11,514
got you hooked
and you wanted to watch the
rest.

754
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:15,651
At the beginning,
the drunk guy they beat up

755
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:18,254
says he doesn't want
to live in a lawless world.

756
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:22,992
I was shocked when they were
in the tunnel beating him up.

757
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:28,330
When they rape the woman
in the house and the man's
watching.

758
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:32,434
When they hit each other.

759
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:39,275
As well as the scenes
of explicit violence,

760
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,478
it's quite shocking
when they force his eyes open.

761
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,346
Institutional violence

762
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:46,916
and how the system
takes that violence and uses it.

763
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:53,756
The influence of the media
on society stood out for me.

764
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,591
Some of the scenes are shocking

765
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,626
and I'm not sure
what people must've thought

766
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:58,961
when it first came out.

767
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,631
Right from the very first scene,

768
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:05,668
with four men
forcing themselves on a woman...

769
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:08,304
and not just that one,
a couple more...

770
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:13,242
I found them pretty shocking
because they're really explicit

771
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:18,647
for a film
that was screened at a festival

772
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:22,351
and is recognised as a cult
film.

773
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:25,921
I found it difficult to watch
and quite savage,

774
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:28,724
but I liked it overall.

775
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,192
I liked the film.

776
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:31,894
I really liked the film.

777
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,095
I loved it.

778
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:37,032
I liked it but I feel
a little unsettled.

779
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:41,170
It would be impossible for this
to be released nowadays.

780
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:44,773
People would be up in arms.

781
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,875
It would be risky to make it now

782
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:50,446
because I think it's
controversial

783
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:52,081
and very explicit.

784
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,016
It was too much for me.

785
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,051
The sexual stuff...

786
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:59,888
I don't think it would be
received
the same way now as it was then.

787
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:03,626
No, you couldn't make
this film now because...

788
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:08,030
no director could...

789
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:12,134
get enough support to make it,
and even if they did

790
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:17,172
no producer would approve it.

791
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:37,226
Maybe the film
couldn't be made today

792
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:41,630
mainly because the producers

793
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:44,533
wouldn't deem it appropriate.

794
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:49,038
We sometimes automatically apply

795
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:52,708
certain scales of behaviour

796
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:58,213
and, in real life,

797
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:01,250
we have to be very strict

798
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,887
and recognise
there are some things we can't
do

799
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:06,288
and shouldn't do,

800
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:09,124
but it's another thing for me
to envisage a book

801
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:13,195
with a violent scene
that might upset somebody...

802
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:14,930
Just because it upsets somebody

803
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,766
doesn't mean
that work must disappear.

804
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,601
Wrongness isn't erased

805
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:25,040
by removing the reflection
of something that's wrong

806
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:29,645
from a beautiful film or book.

807
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:35,951
Having been through it myself

808
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:40,322
but also having had time
to reflect on it,

809
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:43,425
I despise the existence
of censorship.

810
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:47,930
That censorship was much more
severe,

811
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:50,165
tougher and more aggressive

812
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:54,269
but much less subtle

813
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:59,641
than it would be to today accept
a censorship on traditions,

814
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:00,976
on habits,

815
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,480
on what's politically correct
or incorrect,

816
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:07,049
on what's commercial and what's
not.

817
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:11,653
With any cultural
or artistic activity,

818
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:17,326
the creator's need for freedom
is fundamental.
