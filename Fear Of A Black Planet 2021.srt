00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,750
- I should've never let you in here.

5
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,233
- You shouldn't have gotten
mixed in with those guys.

6
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,283
What are you afraid of?

7
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,379

(Fay grunts)

00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:19,629
(serene country music)

9
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,930
- Why'd you leave so early?

10
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,523
I wanted to make you breakfast.

11
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,763
Yeah, I know, I'll be able to
make you breakfast every day.

12
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,453
Yeah, no, me, I gotta go
pick up my assignment.

13
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,190
I'm not sure yet, but
I'm hoping it's not far.

14
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,513
You know, L.A. traffic
is already a nightmare.

15
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,313
Okay, babe, I'll see you tonight?

16
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,803
Love you too.

17
00:03:37,653 --> 00:03:38,704
Bye.

18
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,244

(radio static buzzes)

20
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:06,882
- [Anchor] The country is in
a complete civil race war.

00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:10,019
(police sirens wail)
(guns fire)

22
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,220
- Is someone shooting?

24
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:17,200
God, move, move!

26
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:25,421
Not again.

Call me back, call me back, I need you!

I'm downtown near 10th!

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,630
Hey, hey.

37
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,200
I hear you, somebody in there?

38
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,033
Somebody?

00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:14,555

43
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,457
Yo, bitch, I know you in there!

44
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,150
I hear you!

45
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,350
I'm coming for your ass!

46
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,700
Yeah, we'll be back!

47
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:34,963
(newscaster chatters)

48
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,933
- What the fuck?

(people shout)
(guns fire)

50
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:49,670
- [Man] Let's go, cover your head!

51
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,893
- They finally did it.

52
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,520
- Who finally did what?

53
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,670
- This has been coming.

54
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,973
For anybody listening, watching.

55
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,420
This has been coming.

56
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:08,611
(helicopter blades whir)
(woman screams)

57
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,944
(gun fires)

58
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,560
- I have to see what's going on.

59
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,790
My car is out there.

60
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,660
- You know what's going on.

61
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,163
You were already out there.

62
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,563
Just getting worse.

63
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:30,548
(dial tone blares)

64
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,323
- [Fay] Do you have a phone I could use?

65
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,863
- Stopped working an hour ago.

66
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,070
- Well is there another way out of here?

67
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,120
What about that door?

68
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,803
- It's just storage.

69
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,460
This is the safest place
in the city right now.

70
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,490
- [Fay] What are you, some kind of artist?

71
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,660
- Bingo, what gave me away?

72
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,600
All my dirty paintbrushes?

73
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,780
Or my high fashion wardrobe?

74
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,930
- What's a white girl
doing living down here?

75
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,280
You slumming?

76
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,030
- Till my splashes of color
can actually make me money,

77
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,940
warehouse in the hood is
all a white girl can afford.

78
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,164
- We just heard a big explosion.

79
00:10:14,164 --> 00:10:16,000
(guns fire)
Not more than a block

80
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,060
away from us.

81
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,740
And a gang of men, a gang of armed men

82
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,970
have been going back and
forth from each other.

83
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,576
There's been looting everywhere.

84
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:26,730
(people shout angrily)

85
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,390
This is Fabia Lopez, back
to you at the studio.

86
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,616
Let's get out of here.

87
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:32,949
(gun fires)

88
00:10:33,944 --> 00:10:35,804
(static buzzes)

89
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:38,721
(foreboding music)

90
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:08,558
(car alarm blares)

91
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,370
- Might as well make
ourselves comfortable.

92
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,040
There's not much we can do.

93
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,183
Just ride it out.

94
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,610
- This is not just some
wave that will come and go.

95
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,990
- No, you're right.

96
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,540
Like all waves, there'll
be another one after this.

97
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,950
And another one after that.

98
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,120
- You don't look like a surfer.

99
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,123
- I'm not.

100
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,260
Just a student of history
and human behavior.

101
00:11:53,594 --> 00:11:56,261
(ominous music)

102
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,333
Called some of my friends.

103
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,930
They should be here by now.

104
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,950
- Thought you said the
phone stopped working.

105
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,783
- It did.

106
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,260
I talked to him this morning.

107
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,103
They're coming in from out of town.

108
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:43,027
(men shout angrily)

109
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,763
(gun fires)
(gasps)

110
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:03,451
(melancholy music)

111
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,291
- We did it, Pops.

112
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,793
I got my badge today.

113
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,263
Yeah.

114
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,510
I know you always wanted a boy

115
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,733
to follow in the family legacy.

116
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,623
But I guess it was me, huh?

117
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,243
And I promise I'm gonna be
the best cop you ever saw.

118
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,080
(sobs)
- We should stay away

119
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,193
from the windows.

120
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,339
We don't want anyone to see us.

121
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,610
- No.

122
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,610
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

123
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,630
We have to do--
- What?

124
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,740
We have to what?

125
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,190
The world is on fire.

126
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,520
If we go out there, we'll burn with it.

127
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,320
- Well you might be okay with just sitting

128
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,573
and watching it burn, but I'm not.

129
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,193
- There's nothing we can do.

130
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,510
Who do you think you are,
some kind of wonder woman?

131
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,870
- No.

132
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,497
I'm a--
(phone rings)

133
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,623
Ric, where are you?

134
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,670
I'm okay, I'm...

135
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,850
I don't even know what happened.

136
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,023
I was leaving downtown from
work when everything happened.

137
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,460
Yes, yes, I'm safe right now, I'm...

138
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,710
I'm in a warehouse building near Central.

139
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,943
What's the address here?

140
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,170
- There's no address outside.

141
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,770
Just middle of the
block on 14th, red door.

142
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,060
- Middle of the block on 14th, red door.

143
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,160
I'll look out for you.

144
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,350
What's going on?

145
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,710
I can't see anything.

146
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,350
This is crazy.

147
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,020
I mean, they always said
something like this would happen,

148
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,760
but I never thought...

149
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,830
Just be safe and get
here as fast as you can.

150
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,270
Okay?

151
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,820
Okay, I love you.

152
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,364
(dial tone blares)

153
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:35,197
Fuck.

154
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,550
- I think there's somebody out there.

155
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:43,000
- What are you talking about?

156
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,563
- I think I see somebody,
but I'm not sure.

157
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:48,646
(police siren wails)

158
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,310
- It's a little girl.

159
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,143
- Is she alive?

160
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,961
- I don't know.

161
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:25,190
(helicopter blades whir)

162
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,190
I'm going out there.

163
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,550
Go to the window and look out for me.

164
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,623
If you see something,
you see anyone, yell out.

165
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,050
Can you open the door for me?

166
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:39,785
I'll be right back.

167
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,283
Hey.

168
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,083
Hey.

169
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,643
You all right?

170
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:06,222
(booming)

171
00:17:06,222 --> 00:17:09,323
(hisses) Are you hurt?

172
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:10,156
Fuck.

173
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:22,475
(gasps)

174
00:17:24,437 --> 00:17:27,336
(man breathes heavily)

175
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:29,707
- I always wanted myself a black--

176
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:32,096
(gun fires)
(yelps)

177
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:33,790
(tense music)

178
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,730
- [Man] Now you're next.

179
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,940
Can't run from me!

180
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,920
I see, no, I'm not there!

181
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,439
Am I there?

182
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:45,439
I'm everywhere!

183
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:51,251
You can't hide from me, I see you!

184
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:54,768
(man screams)

185
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:56,904
You!

186
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,539
(tense music)

187
00:18:59,602 --> 00:19:02,048
(metal clatters)

188
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:06,631
(thudding)
(man yelps)

189
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,447
(helicopter blades whir)

190
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:58,428
(emergency sirens wail)

191
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:08,820
- Nova, it's me!

192
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,274
It's me, let me in!

193
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:11,243
(knocking)
Nova!

194
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,063
Need you to let me in, please!

195
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,090
Now, now!

196
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,040
I know you're afraid, please.

197
00:20:21,124 --> 00:20:21,957
Please.

198
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,463
Please, please.

199
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,180
- You all right, sister?

200
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,600
- Yeah.

201
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,323
Yeah, I'm all right.

202
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,383
- Good.

203
00:20:55,383 --> 00:20:58,033
I saw that motherfucker
trying to go after you.

204
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:00,263
But we ain't having
that today, not no more.

205
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,193
We cleaning house today.

206
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,230
Getting rid of all those white devils.

207
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,143
You alone in here, sister?

208
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:21,963
- Yeah.

209
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,923
This is my studio.

210
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,620
You read a lot, that's good.

211
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,670
We need smart black women
to raise our children.

212
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,120
The white devils have been poisoning them

213
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,113
with lies about us.

214
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:56,045
(guns fire)
(emergency sirens wail)

215
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:57,376
- Yo, Adisa!

216
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,810
Yo, man.

217
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,913
Yo, dog, come on, man.

218
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,590
They coming, man, come on, bro.

219
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,423
They coming!

220
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,310
- Come with us, sister.

221
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,063
We ain't free yet, there's a
lot of fighting to be done.

222
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,913
- No.

223
00:22:22,796 --> 00:22:23,796
I'm gonna stay here.

224
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,120
- Yo, man!

225
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,953
Come on!

226
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,660
- You can breathe now.

227
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,493
They're gone.

228
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,033
- I'm sorry.

229
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,440
I don't know what happened to me.

230
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,860
I froze.

231
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,693
- Forget it.

232
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,890
- What about the little girl?

233
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,993
- It wasn't real, it was a doll.

234
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,313
- A doll?

235
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,980
- Forget it.

236
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,880
We've got other things to worry about.

237
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,510
It's gonna get dark soon.

238
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,200
And things are probably
only gonna get a lot worse.

239
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,973
Come on.

240
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:22,795
(dramatic music)

241
00:23:55,819 --> 00:23:59,078
(people shout)

242
00:23:59,078 --> 00:24:02,161
(electricity buzzes)

243
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,313
Oh great.

244
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,930
Somebody must have cut the lines.

245
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,108
(phone rings)

246
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:14,747
(ominous music)

247
00:24:14,747 --> 00:24:17,230
I thought you said...

248
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,530
- They must have fixed it.

249
00:24:26,438 --> 00:24:29,889
- [Lestor] Nova. (chatters)

250
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:30,972
- Yes, but...

251
00:24:33,445 --> 00:24:35,190
It's not a problem, she's...

252
00:24:38,237 --> 00:24:39,070
Okay.

253
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:41,532
Okay.

254
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,280
I'll do what you say.

255
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,390
Good news, friends are all right.

256
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,940
Just taking longer to get here.

257
00:25:22,598 --> 00:25:24,674
- Pick up, pick up.

258
00:25:24,674 --> 00:25:26,946
(dial tone blares)

259
00:25:26,946 --> 00:25:27,779
Damn.

260
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:34,795
What do we do now?

261
00:25:34,795 --> 00:25:37,462
(ominous music)

262
00:25:49,437 --> 00:25:52,687
(serene country music)

263
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:05,486
- You're kidding.

264
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,543
- Oh my god.

265
00:26:29,313 --> 00:26:31,390
- I don't feel like drinking.

266
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,333
- Oh, come on.

267
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,390
It's the end of everything
we know outside.

268
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
You and I should both be dead right now.

269
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,030
That's at least worth a drink.

270
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,660
- Okay, fine.

271
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,360
Give me it, you talked me into it.

272
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,343
- Cheers.

273
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,243
- Cheers.

274
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:13,970
- [Nova] You got somewhere to be?

275
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:14,803
- Yes.

276
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,970
No, I...

277
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,320
I was going to visit my father.

278
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,450
He gave me this watch.

279
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,673
I was going to visit his
grave to tell him something.

280
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,800
- Your father's dead?

281
00:27:35,964 --> 00:27:37,590
- Yeah.

282
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,423
Three years now.

283
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,133
When he gave me this watch, he said,

284
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:49,487
"There's always time
to do the right thing."

285
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,360
I try to remember that
when times get tough.

286
00:27:56,956 --> 00:27:58,756
- What were you gonna tell your dad?

287
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,013
- What?

288
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,790
- You said that you were
on the way to the cemetery

289
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,290
to tell your father something.

290
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,243
What was it?

291
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,230
- You don't seem worried about all this.

292
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,753
I mean, it's like you said,
it is the end of the world.

293
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,943
Don't you care?

294
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,853
- I care.

295
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,130
There'll be something after all this.

296
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:32,270
- Is that what it says
in "The White Wave"?

297
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,820
- [Nova] What?

298
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,633
- The book on the table.

299
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,690
- It's just a book a friend gave me.

300
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,393
I know a lot of crazy people.

301
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:50,043
Lestor, he's got a lot of
crazy ideas about the world.

302
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,480
- This the same friend that's on the way?

303
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,160
- [Nova] Who, Lestor?

304
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,390
Yeah.

305
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,463
Him and some others.

306
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,713
- Some others with crazy ideas?

307
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,380
- You ask a lot of questions.

308
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,273
You a cop?

309
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,400
- [Fay] What's in the van?

310
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,083
- I don't know, cleaning supplies?

311
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,423
It belongs to Lestor.

312
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,153
That's why he's coming, to pick it up.

313
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,550
- Must be something pretty important

314
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,707
to drive through a war to pick up a van.

315
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:45,375
(heart thumps)

316
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,875
(tense music)

317
00:29:49,404 --> 00:29:52,071
- You should've never came here.

318
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:07,499
- What's in the van, Nova?

319
00:30:11,085 --> 00:30:13,585
You put something in my drink?

320
00:30:18,655 --> 00:30:19,488
Why?

321
00:30:24,773 --> 00:30:25,606
Why?

322
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:29,928
Why?

323
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:33,629
Why, why did you do this?

324
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:55,484
(foreboding music)

325
00:31:20,024 --> 00:31:21,691
- What have we here?

326
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,882
She's still breathing.

327
00:31:30,757 --> 00:31:31,590
Love.

328
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:36,943
Well, shit.

329
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:40,800
- Man, stay out of it--

330
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,480
- Come on, man, this is the time--

331
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,129
- Don't you fucking touch--

332
00:31:44,129 --> 00:31:46,580
- Whoa, what is your problem, man?

333
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,830
Don't fucking touch me, don't touch me.

334
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:55,358
- You find some rope, I
want you to guys tie her up,

335
00:31:55,358 --> 00:31:56,918
set her off to the side,

336
00:31:56,918 --> 00:31:58,870
we'll figure out what
to do with her later.

337
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,700
Right now we gotta get our shit together,

338
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,678
cause we got somewhere to be, don't we?

339
00:32:04,678 --> 00:32:06,340
- Go grab the rope, man.

340
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,944
He told you to get the rope, dumb.

341
00:32:08,944 --> 00:32:12,027
(slow motion speech)

342
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,103
(ominous music)

343
00:32:23,754 --> 00:32:25,754
(gasps)

344
00:32:43,935 --> 00:32:46,980
(sighs)
- Baby?

345
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,430
What's wrong, couldn't sleep?

346
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,943
Must've been thinking about me, huh?

347
00:32:51,943 --> 00:32:53,893
- (giggles) Shut up.

348
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,350
No, I...

349
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,003
I just had the craziest dream.

350
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:04,873
I can't even remember.

351
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,323
I was alone,

352
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,263
and I kept calling you,
but you weren't there.

353
00:33:16,575 --> 00:33:17,575
- Well I'm here now.

354
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,527
What was it that you wanted?

355
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:22,775
- What?

356
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:25,030
- In your dream, you
said you were calling me.

357
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,080
All right, here I am.

358
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,913
What'd you want?

359
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,890
- I...

360
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,113
I can't remember.

361
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,753
- I got an idea.

362
00:33:44,143 --> 00:33:44,976
- What?

363
00:33:44,976 --> 00:33:47,923
- I was kinda planning
this for another time.

364
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,393
This kinda seems like the
right time, right place.

365
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,674
(Fay sighs)

366
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,340
Just a picture, I'm always
here when you need me.

367
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,400
In your dreams or when you're awake.

368
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,915
Fay, will you do me the
honor of being my wife?

369
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:18,498
(gentle music)

370
00:34:20,062 --> 00:34:21,984
- Yes. (laughs)

371
00:34:21,984 --> 00:34:23,303
- Yes?

372
00:34:23,303 --> 00:34:24,303
- [Fay] Yes.

373
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:26,114
Yes.

374
00:34:27,714 --> 00:34:28,797
- Yes?
- Yeah.

375
00:34:30,163 --> 00:34:31,493
Yes.
- You gonna put it on,

376
00:34:31,493 --> 00:34:33,784
or you just gonna look at it?
- I don't know. (laughs)

377
00:34:33,784 --> 00:34:35,284
I don't even know.

378
00:34:36,323 --> 00:34:41,323
Oh.

379
00:34:42,475 --> 00:34:45,281
I love you.
- I love you.

380
00:34:45,281 --> 00:34:47,781
(Fay giggles)

381
00:35:18,591 --> 00:35:19,424
- Oh, god.

382
00:35:26,403 --> 00:35:28,403
(gasps)

383
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:37,343
(whimpers)

384
00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:54,225
(grunts) Fuck.

385
00:35:55,714 --> 00:35:57,797
(groans)

386
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,830
(tense music)

387
00:36:42,471 --> 00:36:43,304
Hello?

388
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,023
Okay.

389
00:36:56,224 --> 00:36:57,141
Fuck, fuck.

390
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:03,720
(phone rings)

391
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,070
Ric, Ric?

392
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:06,903
Where are you?

393
00:37:10,307 --> 00:37:11,557
I'm in trouble.

394
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,213
Please.

395
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:17,691
I'm in trouble.

396
00:37:19,521 --> 00:37:20,354
Ric.

397
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,033
I'm in trouble.

398
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,907
I'm with some bad people.

399
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:31,001
(dial tone blares)

400
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:33,738
(shouts)

401
00:37:33,738 --> 00:37:35,738
(cries)

402
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:38,847
Okay.

403
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:40,538
Come on, girl.

404
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:43,199
Okay, no one can help you but you,

405
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,693
no one can help you but you.

406
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:46,902
Okay.

407
00:37:54,634 --> 00:37:58,603
- Nova, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately,

408
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,883
living in that dark little cave of yours.

409
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,870
Having had everything taken from you,

410
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,940
passed off and given to
people who didn't deserve it,

411
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,950
who didn't earn it, who
haven't worked hard.

412
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,950
I've begun to think that
maybe God has a plan for you.

413
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,713
A good white woman with nothing.

414
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,540
It's my belief that God
wants us to fight back,

415
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,030
to fight for change.

416
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,563
To take it back.

417
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,730
- [Newscaster] All federal
buildings are on high alert,

418
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,160
but law enforcement resources
are spread very thin.

419
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,310
It's safe to say right now
that each man is for himself.

420
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,220
This is the known symbol of their militia.

421
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,887
If you see something, say something.

422
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:49,431
(foreboding music)

423
00:39:22,706 --> 00:39:25,456
(dramatic music)

424
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:31,225
(metal clangs)

425
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:33,808
(chains clink)

426
00:39:35,278 --> 00:39:37,611
(man moans)

427
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,005
- Who are you?

428
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:50,874
Are you hurt?

429
00:39:53,243 --> 00:39:54,764
Okay.

430
00:39:54,764 --> 00:39:55,597
All right.

431
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:58,783
Okay.

432
00:39:58,783 --> 00:40:00,866
(grunts)

433
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,067
Okay, oh my god, okay.

434
00:40:07,111 --> 00:40:10,130
Okay, okay, okay, one second.

435
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,547
(man coughs)

436
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:18,251
(Fay grunts)

437
00:40:19,507 --> 00:40:21,809
Okay, okay, okay.

438
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:22,642
Oh my god.

439
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:26,468
You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.

440
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:28,081
You're all right now, you're all right.

441
00:40:28,081 --> 00:40:29,137
You're all right, you're all right.

442
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:30,720
Okay, okay, oh man.

443
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:34,240
- Where are they?

444
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,623
- There's no one here right
now, they're all gone.

445
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,270
- We can't stay here, we gotta go. (sobs)

446
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,650
- Okay, okay.

447
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,512
Can you stand?

448
00:40:43,512 --> 00:40:44,925
I'll help you, help you.

449
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:47,845
Okay, on three, one, two.

450
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,920
(grunts) Three.

451
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,587
Okay, come on, okay.

452
00:40:54,657 --> 00:40:57,091
(grunts)

453
00:40:57,091 --> 00:40:58,674
Okay, okay.

454
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:07,870
- I can't walk!

455
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,190
- What happened?

456
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,343
- They jumped me, beat me up.

457
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,700
I thought they was gonna kill me.

458
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,880
- Who?

459
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,679
Who did this?

460
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,512
- I don't know who they are.

461
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,943
Skinheads, white boys.

462
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,697
Some guy they call Lestor.

463
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:30,405
- Lestor, what, fuck.

464
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,822
Okay, okay.

465
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,734
Stay with me, stay with me.

466
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:37,603
Hey, hey, hey, come on, stay with me.

467
00:41:37,603 --> 00:41:38,934
Hey, hey.

468
00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:41,690
- I don't wanna be here
when they get back.

469
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,920
- We can't go outside, it's not safe.

470
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,200
- We're not safe here.

471
00:41:49,105 --> 00:41:50,530
Can we lock the door

472
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,130
or something?
- No, no.

473
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,130
No, they have a key.

474
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,324
That won't keep them out.

475
00:41:56,324 --> 00:41:58,241
What is it, what is it?

476
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,530
What's in the van, what's in the van?

477
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,877
- Chemicals, dangerous stuff.

478
00:42:03,877 --> 00:42:04,710
- My god.

479
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:07,973
- I was on my way to the plant
and dump when they jumped me.

480
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,330
- [Fay] Did they say what they
were gonna do with the stuff?

481
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,985
- No. (sobs)

482
00:42:13,985 --> 00:42:16,710
But I'm pretty sure it's some crazy

483
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,797
let's kill a lot of black folk shit.

484
00:42:19,647 --> 00:42:21,000
- Okay, okay, listen to me.

485
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,923
We have to stop them, okay?

486
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,883
- How you think we gonna do that?

487
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,083
I can't even walk.

488
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,613
- I'm a cop.

489
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:36,314
(Issac sobs)

490
00:42:36,314 --> 00:42:37,314
- You a cop.

491
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,040
You don't even look like a cop.

492
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,560
- Well I just graduated from the academy,

493
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,070
and they still haven't
given me my assignment,

494
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,000
but yes, I'm a cop.

495
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,010
- Good for you.

496
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,754
Now what?

497
00:42:50,754 --> 00:42:52,940
- Okay, okay, okay.

498
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,773
I have a gun.

499
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,567
It's in my car, come on.

500
00:42:56,567 --> 00:42:58,113
I have to go and get it.

501
00:42:59,364 --> 00:43:00,197
Hey.

502
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,400
Can you let me in if I come back?

503
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,810
Can you do that, I need yes, yes or no.

504
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:06,710
Yes, yes?

505
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,183
Okay, okay, good, good, good.

506
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,790
Lock the door, listen for me.

507
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:23,323
I'll be right back, I promise.

508
00:43:23,323 --> 00:43:24,156
Okay.

509
00:43:26,094 --> 00:43:28,177
(grunts)

510
00:43:30,045 --> 00:43:32,962
(foreboding music)

511
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:44,328
(dog barks)

512
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,340
(tense music)

513
00:44:36,779 --> 00:44:38,779
(gasps)

514
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:46,432
(gun fires)

515
00:45:04,028 --> 00:45:06,361
(gun fires)

516
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:14,105
(suspenseful music)

517
00:46:19,534 --> 00:46:22,034
(men arguing)

518
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:50,686
(ominous music)

519
00:47:10,256 --> 00:47:12,006
- [Lestor] All right.

520
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,473
- Now it's as if we--
- Guys, bro?

521
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:24,050
- I told you we should've
killed that black girl

522
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:24,933
before we left.

523
00:47:26,863 --> 00:47:28,410
God, why did we bring this kid with us?

524
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,419
This ain't no time to get your nuts--

525
00:47:29,419 --> 00:47:30,903
- The fuck is your problem?
- Stop, enough, all right,

526
00:47:30,903 --> 00:47:32,610
both of you knock it off!

527
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:34,310
We've got bigger fish to fry.

528
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,550
I want you to get the driver

529
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,460
into the truck with the explosives,

530
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,410
and I want this rig ready
to go within the hour,

531
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:41,040
am I understood?

532
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,640
Now where the fuck fuck is my--

533
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,360
- Don't move!

534
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,030
Drop your weapons on the floor.

535
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,053
Do it now, or I'll shoot.

536
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,730
Now kick your weapons towards the walls.

537
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,995
- Now what?

538
00:48:02,995 --> 00:48:04,130
You gonna shoot all of us?

539
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,530
- I'm gonna shoot you if
you don't shut the fuck up.

540
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:08,680
- Do it, you can't stop what's coming.

541
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,076
- Don't make me.
- Hm?

542
00:48:10,076 --> 00:48:15,076
(gun fires)
(Max grunts in pain)

543
00:48:20,185 --> 00:48:21,665
- Fuck.

544
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,020
- [Max] That bitch
almost shot my foot off!

545
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,214
- Yo man, she locked herself
in the van, you idiot!

546
00:48:26,214 --> 00:48:27,650
- Fuck the van, what about my foot?

547
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:29,237
- All right, both of you shut up a second.

548
00:48:29,237 --> 00:48:31,486
Now she's got the detonator,

549
00:48:31,486 --> 00:48:32,713
and we can't arm the
explosives without it.

550
00:48:32,713 --> 00:48:34,040
- Just shoot the lock off.

551
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,633
- Are you fucking stupid?

552
00:48:36,562 --> 00:48:38,700
Do you remember what we
just loaded in there?

553
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,880
You blow the lock off, you
blow the whole building apart

554
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,780
and us with it.

555
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,160
- Told you this kid was a moron.

556
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,700
- Okay, we can't blow the lock off,

557
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,100
she ain't coming out on her own,

558
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,960
so how do we get that
black bitch out of there?

559
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,703
- Just get my tools.

560
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,203
Hey, uh, lady?

561
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,180
Can we talk about this a second?

562
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:13,163
- Ain't nothing to talk about.

563
00:49:13,163 --> 00:49:15,260
I ain't opening that door.

564
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,277
- [Lestor] I think you got me

565
00:49:16,277 --> 00:49:18,783
and my boys out here all wrong.

566
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,836
- Oh yeah, you're just a
bunch of boy scouts, right?

567
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,600
- (chuckles) Well, I mean, you know,

568
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,500
there's some materials in
there that are very dangerous,

569
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,990
and if you're not careful,
you're gonna get yourself hurt.

570
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:34,313
- We all might get hurt
if you don't back off.

571
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,823
- Okay, listen.

572
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:43,570
I'm gonna go ahead and introduce
myself proper-like now.

573
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:48,320
I am the big bad wolf,
and one way or another,

574
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,130
I am coming in there.

575
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,770
Now are you really gonna
make me huff and puff

576
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:56,617
before I blow your fucking house in!

577
00:49:56,617 --> 00:49:59,117
(tense music)

578
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:18,016
(drill whirs)

579
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,190
Time's almost up, Miss!

580
00:50:26,906 --> 00:50:30,823
We gonna do this the easy
way or the messy way?

581
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,733
Okay, messy way it is.

582
00:50:35,405 --> 00:50:37,935
(gun fires)
Oh shit!

583
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:39,210
- It's gonna get a lot messier than that

584
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,493
if you come any closer.

585
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,815
- Are you trying to get yourself blown up,

586
00:50:43,815 --> 00:50:44,750
you stupid bitch?

587
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,060
- If I go, we all go, you
dumb white motherfucker.

588
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,570
- [Nova] Leave her alone.

589
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:51,033
She's a nice person.

590
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:54,223
- Nova?

591
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:58,270
(somber music)

592
00:50:58,270 --> 00:50:59,103
Is that you?

593
00:51:00,805 --> 00:51:03,674
- Why did you come back?

594
00:51:03,674 --> 00:51:05,257
You didn't have to.

595
00:51:07,074 --> 00:51:08,907
Why did you come back?

596
00:51:11,513 --> 00:51:13,200
- I can't explain it.

597
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,313
- You saved me.

598
00:51:16,764 --> 00:51:18,133
I didn't wanna drug you.

599
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:23,743
But I had to, or they
would've killed you on sight.

600
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:25,863
- Then help me.

601
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:27,603
Do something.

602
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,123
- No.

603
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,713
She ain't gonna do shit.

604
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:38,973
She belongs to me.

605
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:47,483
- Nova.

606
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:54,893
Just tell them to back away
from the van, and I'll come out.

607
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,173
- Why?

608
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:00,560
What are you gonna do then?

609
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:06,170
- I'll give you what you want.

610
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,410
Just give me the van driver and I'll leave

611
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:12,053
if you just let me have him.

612
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:17,973
- You want a half dead driver?

613
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,743
You can have him, my gift to you.

614
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:25,793
I mean, he's probably not gonna
make it till morning anyway.

615
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,610
- We've got a deal.

616
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,173
Back away from the van, and I'll come out.

617
00:52:36,684 --> 00:52:39,033
- Back up.

618
00:52:39,033 --> 00:52:42,783
She said that she'll
come out if you back up.

619
00:53:11,471 --> 00:53:13,971
(tense music)

620
00:53:16,246 --> 00:53:17,079
- Nova.

621
00:53:28,943 --> 00:53:31,833
You're not, you're not gonna shoot me.

622
00:53:33,673 --> 00:53:35,423
You're a good person.

623
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,250
You may have gotten into
it with the wrong people,

624
00:53:40,572 --> 00:53:42,655
but you're not like them.

625
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:44,846
No.

626
00:53:46,836 --> 00:53:47,836
Put it down.

627
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:51,093
Yeah.

628
00:53:51,093 --> 00:53:51,926
Okay.

629
00:53:53,493 --> 00:53:54,326
- Nova.

630
00:53:57,163 --> 00:53:59,397
What are you doing?

631
00:53:59,397 --> 00:54:01,853
You know you can't trust them.

632
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,270
- Nova, don't listen to him.

633
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:07,553
- You remember what you told me?

634
00:54:07,553 --> 00:54:10,847
What they did to you when
you were a little girl?

635
00:54:12,767 --> 00:54:13,743
How they hurt you?

636
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:18,652
Never gonna let that
happen again, are you?

637
00:54:18,652 --> 00:54:19,652
Never again.

638
00:54:34,732 --> 00:54:38,065
(emergency sirens wail)

639
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:40,375
(Fay grunts)

640
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:41,964
- Okay, synced up.

641
00:54:41,964 --> 00:54:43,164
- Put that in the truck.

642
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,160
Wrap this shit show up, people.

643
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,450
Wheels up in five minutes.

644
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,780
Dallas, gas up the truck,
I want it topped off.

645
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,680
- [Dallas] Got it.

646
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,602
- Yeah, we're good.

647
00:54:53,602 --> 00:54:56,869
(timer beeps)

648
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:57,702
It's okay.

649
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,113
- Why are you doing this?

650
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,630
- I could tell you the story

651
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,790
about how when I was a little
kid, I got jumped every day

652
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:25,193
by a bunch of big black
kids in my neighborhood.

653
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:29,650
Or I could tell you the story

654
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:33,550
about how my dad lost his job

655
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:36,150
because the company had to
fill some bullshit quota.

656
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:41,148
No, I know the one you wanna hear.

657
00:55:41,148 --> 00:55:44,620
You wanna hear the one
about how some drunk nigger

658
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:49,620
fucking ran his car into my
wife's at 80 miles an hour,

659
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,690
and what I had to say at her funeral.

660
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:55,663
- Is that true?

661
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:58,603
- Does it matter?

662
00:56:00,063 --> 00:56:02,023
It could all be true, or none of it.

663
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:04,570
It still wouldn't change the fact

664
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:07,633
that you will never understand
this white man's burden.

665
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,960
Hour from now, things go boom.

666
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,453
- [Max] What do we do with her?

667
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:20,540
- Fuck it, throw her in the truck,

668
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,640
it's more body parts for the cleanup crew.

669
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,840
- In another life, you and
I would've had some fun

670
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,627
before I did this.

671
00:56:32,627 --> 00:56:33,565
(Fay grunts)

672
00:56:33,565 --> 00:56:34,576
(door opens)

673
00:56:34,576 --> 00:56:36,210
- Whoa, whoa.

674
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:37,043
Hey, friend.

675
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,860
Oh, sorry, I thought you were another one

676
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,510
of them crazy monkeys with a gun.

677
00:56:43,392 --> 00:56:45,720
- Nah, I heard the noise, man.

678
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,293
Needed to get out of the street.

679
00:56:47,293 --> 00:56:48,583
It's crazy out there.

680
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,885
- Yeah.

681
00:56:51,885 --> 00:56:53,285
About to get crazy here too.

682
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:58,650
Say I find myself in need of
another able-bodied individual.

683
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,850
I don't suppose you'd
be willing to join us?

684
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,560
- Looks like you're up to something big.

685
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:10,743
I like big stuff.

686
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,380
- Big stuff, I like that.

687
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,930
Well big stuff, we're
about to go get ourselves

688
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:17,980
a whole lot of money.

689
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,680
- What are you talking about?

690
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,750
- While the world is burning,
we're gonna go rob a bank.

691
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,690
The World Bank, in fact.

692
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:27,830
And they got enough money in there

693
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:30,460
that you can live whatever
kind of life you want.

694
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,870
- So you're robbing a bank
in the middle of a riot.

695
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,010
- Well, best time to steal shit's

696
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:36,140
when no one's looking, right? (chuckles)

697
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,030
We're just gonna drive down
there, blow a hole in the wall

698
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,230
and walk out with everything they got.

699
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:40,700
- [Max] Hey, why are you telling him?

700
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,800
- Because your stupid
ass went and got shot

701
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,183
and we need somebody else
who can drive the van.

702
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,680
So what do you say, big stuff?

703
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:50,703
Are you in?

704
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:52,993
Or are you out?

705
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,624
- I'm in.

706
00:57:58,624 --> 00:58:00,960
(laughs)

707
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,763
- All right, let's get
this show on the road.

708
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,800
- This bitch is a cop.

709
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,633
- What?

710
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,970
- Fucking bitch.

711
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:16,550
He's with her.

712
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:17,383
- God damn it.

713
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,017
All right, I'll tell you what, big stuff.

714
00:58:23,017 --> 00:58:26,040
(tense music)

715
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,687
I'm gonna blow your
girlfriend's pretty face off.

716
00:58:28,687 --> 00:58:30,200
- Do it and you're dead.

717
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,790
- [Lestor] Drop your fucking gun.

718
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:34,770
- You first!
- I will shoot her!

719
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:37,180
You wanna see her brains
all over the fucking floor?

720
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,317
- I can't let you leave here.

721
00:58:38,317 --> 00:58:41,183
- Put the fucking gun down,
you fucking nigger lover.

722
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,513
Put the gun down now!

723
00:58:45,513 --> 00:58:47,759
(guns fire)

724
00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:50,426
(Lestor grunts)

725
00:58:52,608 --> 00:58:54,613
Ah, fuck.

726
00:58:58,911 --> 00:59:01,661
(dramatic music)

727
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,153
- So much for the white wave, huh?

728
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,880
- I should've never let you in here.

729
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,520
- You shouldn't have got
mixed in with those guys.

730
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,770
- I still gotta sacrifice
for what I believe.

731
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:49,843
You see, it's not too
late for the revolution.

732
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:52,520
(dramatic music)

733
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,770
- What are you afraid of?

734
00:59:55,597 --> 00:59:57,883
- If we let the monkeys out of the cage,

735
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,410
they'll remember how we treated them.

736
01:00:13,722 --> 01:00:17,043
(gun fires)
(Fay grunts)

737
01:00:17,043 --> 01:00:19,876
Okay, okay, okay.

738
01:00:54,122 --> 01:00:56,705
(fan clatters)

739
01:01:32,918 --> 01:01:35,001
(groans)

740
01:02:01,899 --> 01:02:03,400
(timer beeps)

741
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,900
(tense music)

742
01:02:08,578 --> 01:02:10,995
(Fay grunts)

743
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,273
(fan clatters)

744
01:03:23,107 --> 01:03:24,809
- Hey, beautiful.

745
01:03:24,809 --> 01:03:27,209
- What took you so long?

746
01:03:27,209 --> 01:03:28,649
- Little bit of traffic, babe.

747
01:03:28,649 --> 01:03:31,066
(Fay laughs)

748
01:03:35,695 --> 01:03:37,447
Ah, fuck.
- Can you stand?

749
01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:38,530
- I think so.

750
01:03:41,645 --> 01:03:42,562
Help me up.

751
01:03:46,204 --> 01:03:50,304
God. (groans)

752
01:03:58,672 --> 01:04:01,589
(foreboding music)

753
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:07,833
(gasps)

754
01:04:39,753 --> 01:04:42,170
(Fay grunts)

755
01:04:48,681 --> 01:04:50,224
God.

756
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:52,641
(Ric groans)

757
01:04:53,513 --> 01:04:54,904
I can't go any further.

758
01:04:54,904 --> 01:04:55,987
- Okay, okay.

759
01:04:57,707 --> 01:04:59,457
I'm staying with you.

760
01:05:30,788 --> 01:05:33,538
(dramatic music)

761
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:08,320
I'm scared.

762
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,153
- I know.

763
01:06:11,004 --> 01:06:11,837
Me too.

764
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:21,558
(thugs shout angrily)

765
01:06:25,963 --> 01:06:30,713
(guns fire)
(Fay shouts)

766
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:22,759
(dramatic music)

767
01:10:22,898 --> 01:10:25,731
(projector whirs)
