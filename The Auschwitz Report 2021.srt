3
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:31,438
This is what happens to those
who try to escape from my camp!

4
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:09,958
HOORAY!
I AM BACK!

5
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:59,558
Get up!
Get up! Get up!

6
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:04,438
Come on, everyone!
Get up quick!

7
00:03:17,638 --> 00:03:20,198
SCRIBE

8
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,198
Judging by your number,
you’ve been here about a week?

9
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:14,718
[in Polish]
Sorry, I don’t understand.

10
00:04:15,118 --> 00:04:19,478
[in Polish] How long have you
been here, a week? Where’s your bowl?

11
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,878
-Stolen.
-How long since you last ate?

12
00:04:22,998 --> 00:04:27,598
Three days. The block inspector
won’t give me food unless I have a bowl.

13
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:31,358
Wash with tea.
You’ll get typhus from the water.

14
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:37,438
And shave daily. Get something sharp.
You’ll look healthier with red cheeks.

15
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:45,278
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name;

16
00:04:45,678 --> 00:04:49,878
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...

17
00:04:56,678 --> 00:05:01,318
-There are two more inside.
-Let me note down their numbers first.

18
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:18,998
Herszek!
Are all the jobs filled?

19
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,598
I have 300 volunteers
and only 150 available spots.

20
00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:00,158
Let’s go!

21
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:26,158
Name.
Name!

22
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:32,718
-Slovak? Name.
-Alfred Wetzler.

23
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:43,758
-Occupation?
-I used to be a woodworker.

24
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:50,678
Shalom, Jews! First order of business:
Forget your names.

25
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:54,558
Names are ballast.

26
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:58,518
Numbers are exact.
Unmistakable.

27
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:03,678
You Jews know a little something
about numbers, don’t you?

28
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:10,438
The German Reich
is built on rules and order.

29
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:13,878
And so it will remain
for the next thousand years.

30
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:17,358
You have come here to serve the Reich...

31
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:49,078
Welcome to Auschwitz!

32
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:23,998
Prisoner 44070, sir!

33
00:09:27,038 --> 00:09:31,878
-Prisoner 20962. Barrack 9.

34
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:36,238
I’m reporting in for work.

35
00:09:36,318 --> 00:09:38,798
Down on the ground!

36
00:09:39,438 --> 00:09:44,678
Up! Down!
Up! Down...

37
00:09:47,398 --> 00:09:51,798
-What was that?
-He was messing with me. Here, grab it.

38
00:10:11,598 --> 00:10:14,398
What took you so long?

39
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:23,878
-Hang in there.
-Don’t worry about us. We’re dead already.

40
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:28,878
You just worry about the living.

41
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:49,398
Good luck!

42
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:48,398
Here goes the usual farce.

43
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:53,758
-Valer, what took you so long?
-I came as soon as I could.

44
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:58,358
Everyone’s got the cold sweats
because of the inspection.

45
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:17,238
Got some gold from the girls at Canada.
I’ll swap it for the watches.

46
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:20,638
-These are the numbers for January.
-Yesterday’s transport is missing.

47
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:24,358
I haven’t got to the Sonderkommando.
They’re still sleeping.

48
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:28,838
They must’ve blown that whole transport
through the chimneys.

49
00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:34,198
This is from the canisters they throw in.

50
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:38,838
It wouldn’t peel off completely,
so I drew the rest of it.

51
00:12:45,758 --> 00:12:48,238
Valer, what number is this?

52
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:51,998
-Where did you leave off?
-Here.

53
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:57,558
January 28: 3000 French,
600 Dutch, 2000 Polish.

54
00:12:58,238 --> 00:13:02,238
Got it?
January so far: 93400.

55
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:05,998
-Got it?
-Yeah.

56
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:13,478
That’s 3012 every day.
125 every hour. 2 every minute.

57
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:24,038
You must get this evidence
to important people back in Slovakia.

58
00:13:30,118 --> 00:13:33,518
The important people will send planes.

59
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:39,718
And those planes will blast this place
into oblivion.

60
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:45,038
So that nothing remains but ash.
Ash and smoke.

61
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:15,998
Good.

62
00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:27,598
What’s up with barrack 9?

63
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,598
Do I have to count you myself?

64
00:14:43,398 --> 00:14:47,398
What’s the hold-up with barrack 9?!

65
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,358
Someone’s missing!

66
00:15:03,438 --> 00:15:07,398
Everything was fine
when we were leaving the barrack.

67
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:34,158
Move it!

68
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:54,798
Herr Lagerführer, a prisoner is missing
from the quarantine block B-II A.

69
00:15:56,318 --> 00:15:59,078
What do you mean, he’s missing?!

70
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:03,438
He’s lying somewhere
face down in the dirt. Keep searching.

71
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:08,718
Keep searching! Quarantine block!
Move it!

72
00:16:09,878 --> 00:16:14,038
Herr Lagerführer,
a prisoner is missing from barrack 9.

73
00:17:07,758 --> 00:17:13,838
Two scribes are missing.
29162 and 44070. Slovaks.

74
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:34,678
Who has seen the barrack scribe today?

75
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:54,798
Who saw him run off?!

76
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:08,878
Block inspector!

77
00:18:14,238 --> 00:18:17,478
-Prisoner number 2043...
-Huh?!

78
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:21,118
Prisoner number 20432!

79
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:25,678
I know nothing.
Please, believe me!

80
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:30,398
I last saw him this morning.
He got up early, as usual.

81
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:36,398
He took his death book
and went to the washroom.

82
00:18:36,478 --> 00:18:39,958
That’s all I know, I swear.
Please, believe me.

83
00:18:41,158 --> 00:18:43,398
I swear...

84
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:51,158
The best way to find truffles
is to starve the pig.

85
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:58,198
Until I see those two Jews sitting here
with the signs around their necks,

86
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:02,038
you’ll be sitting here yourselves.
Do you understand?

87
00:19:03,598 --> 00:19:06,718
Search all the barracks in this block.

88
00:19:07,238 --> 00:19:12,238
If you don’t find them, send back
all the barracks except for 9. Get going!

89
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:17,558
Right!

90
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:21,038
We’ll start with 25 lashes.

91
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:25,718
Then we will see
what else he remembers.

92
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:27,678
No, please...

93
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:30,878
I know nothing.
Please, believe me!

94
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:38,398
I know nothing. Please!
No, please. No...

95
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:07,598
Damn Eastern Front.

96
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,518
‘For the Fatherland!’
What horseshit!

97
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:21,518
He fell yesterday.

98
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:29,878
My only son.

99
00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:35,878
21 years old.

100
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:43,638
This whole affair
is making my stomach turn.

101
00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:48,038
You, the camp,
this whole damn country!

102
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:51,798
Here.
See?

103
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:58,518
How handsome he was!
Look.

104
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:03,838
Look at him!

105
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:16,198
My poor wife...

106
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:14,718
God damn it!

107
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:18,158
Shit!

108
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:23,358
Fucking mess...

109
00:22:23,438 --> 00:22:26,358
How long have the prisoners been here?

110
00:22:27,758 --> 00:22:30,718
Since summer 1942.

111
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:05,958
Shit.

112
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,598
They’ve seen more than you, Kaduk.

113
00:23:14,718 --> 00:23:16,798
Do you understand?

114
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:26,318
They must not pass.

115
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:29,118
Do you understand?!

116
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:32,438
Go!

117
00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:14,278
Swap with me.

118
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,038
Got it from the kitchen
before the roundup.

119
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:13,278
Pass it around.

120
00:28:05,238 --> 00:28:07,318
Come here.

121
00:28:10,078 --> 00:28:12,478
Sit down.

122
00:28:19,158 --> 00:28:21,318
Here.

123
00:28:35,718 --> 00:28:40,998
Ten times I thought
about killing you last night. Ten times.

124
00:28:45,118 --> 00:28:48,118
I was keeping track.

125
00:28:48,718 --> 00:28:50,718
See?

126
00:28:56,598 --> 00:29:00,118
Because you helped someone
back on his feet...

127
00:29:01,598 --> 00:29:04,598
Because you were passing
around the bread of life...

128
00:29:04,838 --> 00:29:07,838
Stuffing your guts...

129
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:11,318
It was my fault alone.

130
00:29:11,998 --> 00:29:16,718
In German we would call it service.Verdienst.

131
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:23,838
You’re a good person, right?

132
00:29:24,478 --> 00:29:28,718
-You used to be a Franciscan.
-I still am.

133
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:39,278
When you were feeding your friends,

134
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:42,558
I had to think of my dead boy.

135
00:29:46,478 --> 00:29:50,718
I felt like sending three bullets
through your stomach.

136
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,758
Do you know why I didn’t?

137
00:29:58,238 --> 00:30:01,718
How did those two escape?

138
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:06,278
You think they’re going to make it,
but you’re wrong.

139
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:09,398
They’re already dead,
they just don’t know it yet.

140
00:30:09,478 --> 00:30:12,998
I’ll have them on the chairs
by this evening.

141
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:17,078
The locals will give them up,
and if they don’t,

142
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:21,998
they’ll just keep running
until they drop face first in shit.

143
00:30:22,998 --> 00:30:29,238
Death comes first
for those who stand in place.

144
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:32,718
Whatever.

145
00:30:37,198 --> 00:30:39,758
I know they had help.

146
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:43,318
And you enjoy helping people.

147
00:30:43,518 --> 00:30:47,278
That’s why two people
are going to die today.

148
00:30:48,718 --> 00:30:53,358
That’s the only bread
you’ll be giving out from now on.

149
00:30:55,318 --> 00:30:58,358
But you can save them.

150
00:32:51,478 --> 00:32:56,238
Give me one thing
and you can go back in the barrack.

151
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:04,998
You’re willing to put yourselves
through all this for two Slovak Jews?

152
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:50,358
Your daughter is
over in the women’s section, right?

153
00:33:56,998 --> 00:33:59,638
What?

154
00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:03,838
You thought I didn’t know?

155
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,478
You think I don’t know
what goes on in your chicken brains?

156
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:27,798
Ester...

157
00:34:29,238 --> 00:34:34,318
Ester!
Let me go. Let me go!

158
00:34:34,798 --> 00:34:38,398
You’re not going to help her like this.

159
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,798
Please, no!

160
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:30,798
She spoke Slovak, not Polish!
Didn’t you hear her scream?

161
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:35,358
It doesn’t matter.

162
00:35:37,518 --> 00:35:41,118
That girl was Slovak!
She couldn’t have been your daughter!

163
00:35:41,158 --> 00:35:45,998
If they brought the other girl here,
his daughter’s already dead.

164
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:48,758
Send barrack 9 back to work!

165
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:03,078
-Go, go! Move it!
-Get in line! Get going!

166
00:38:04,438 --> 00:38:08,678
Move it!
Move it!

167
00:38:57,758 --> 00:39:00,678
Move it, move it!

168
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:40,798
What are we waiting for?

169
00:39:43,198 --> 00:39:47,998
We’ll go out one by one
or all at once, what’s the difference?

170
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:53,878
There’s more of us.

171
00:39:56,518 --> 00:40:00,958
We’ll take out three of those bastards,
if we spare the dogs.

172
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:04,878
Hold on.

173
00:40:09,998 --> 00:40:12,518
When he lights up.

174
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:41,478
Hold on.

175
00:40:54,238 --> 00:40:56,678
Piece of shit!

176
00:41:30,038 --> 00:41:32,038
Move!

177
00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:37,078
Be quick about it!

178
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,198
Los!

179
00:41:50,238 --> 00:41:53,118
You owe me ten cigarettes.

180
00:42:02,558 --> 00:42:04,798
Push!

181
00:42:18,998 --> 00:42:22,278
Withdraw the outer guard belt!

182
00:42:29,198 --> 00:42:31,878
Columns of five!

183
00:42:56,798 --> 00:42:59,518
What are you doing this for?

184
00:42:59,718 --> 00:43:03,438
You think you’re proving
something here?

185
00:43:03,518 --> 00:43:06,518
To whom?
Me?

186
00:43:09,438 --> 00:43:11,678
Yourselves?

187
00:43:13,198 --> 00:43:16,398
Even an ape can stand on its two feet!

188
00:43:22,478 --> 00:43:25,238
Did I say something funny?

189
00:43:25,558 --> 00:43:28,558
Funny?
Absolutely not.

190
00:43:28,598 --> 00:43:30,438
-No?
-No.

191
00:43:30,598 --> 00:43:33,598
-You having a laugh?
-No. No. No...

192
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:38,718
-Do you find me funny?
-He was castrated by Dr Thilo.

193
00:43:38,878 --> 00:43:42,158
Was I talking to you?!

194
00:43:46,518 --> 00:43:50,278
I see that morale
is going down the shitter.

195
00:43:51,718 --> 00:43:56,238
You need to be reminded
where the dog kennels are.

196
00:44:04,998 --> 00:44:07,278
Come here.

197
00:44:13,238 --> 00:44:15,358
Come.

198
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:22,358
Los! Move it!
Round the barrack.

199
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:28,158
Walk!

200
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:42,158
Stop!

201
00:44:51,278 --> 00:44:53,518
Turn around.

202
00:44:57,318 --> 00:44:59,958
I said turn around!

203
00:45:06,518 --> 00:45:09,718
Are you going to beg?

204
00:45:20,558 --> 00:45:28,718
I will mention this in my memoirs,
which I’m going to write after the war

205
00:45:29,278 --> 00:45:34,758
at my farm somewhere
by the Black Sea.

206
00:45:36,478 --> 00:45:42,718
What about you, funny guy?
Where do you think you’re going to be?

207
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:50,278
Where?

208
00:45:51,558 --> 00:45:57,758
Behind every corner,
in every shadow,

209
00:46:01,798 --> 00:46:04,198
always near.

210
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,878
Shit.

211
00:46:44,038 --> 00:46:46,118
Fuck!

212
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:21,718
Go back!

213
00:47:23,558 --> 00:47:26,558
Get in the barrack!

214
00:47:37,638 --> 00:47:42,158
Send for the driver.
I need a lighter!

215
00:48:10,198 --> 00:48:12,878
Push! Push!

216
00:48:14,718 --> 00:48:17,758
Does it look like I’m holding back?

217
00:48:43,238 --> 00:48:48,318
It won’t budge.
It won’t budge...

218
00:48:51,518 --> 00:48:55,718
I’m not going to die here!
I’m not going to fucking die here!

219
00:50:20,558 --> 00:50:23,878
They’ve pulled the guards.
Come.

220
00:51:10,598 --> 00:51:13,718
No more fences.

221
00:52:52,638 --> 00:52:55,158
Potatoes...

222
00:52:56,878 --> 00:53:00,318
Potatoes with sauerkraut.

223
00:53:48,118 --> 00:53:50,998
Must’ve been the berries.

224
00:55:32,358 --> 00:55:34,358
Valer!

225
00:55:37,198 --> 00:55:39,318
Valer!

226
00:55:47,078 --> 00:55:49,398
Valer!

227
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:35,198
We’re about two, three days away
from the border. If we go straight.

228
00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:38,958
If we go around,
it’ll be two or three more.

229
00:56:46,198 --> 00:56:49,078
Thanks for the shoe.

230
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:19,678
-What’s wrong?
-The other tube. I must’ve dropped it.

231
00:58:27,278 --> 00:58:29,518
I lost it.

232
00:59:22,718 --> 00:59:28,678
You’re going to the border, right?
It’s not far.

233
00:59:30,518 --> 00:59:35,038
But it’s quite a hike
even with healthy feet.

234
01:00:58,598 --> 01:01:00,678
That’s them.

235
01:01:22,678 --> 01:01:24,718
Here.

236
01:01:26,518 --> 01:01:31,718
Our guys got them off some Germans.
They had no use for them anymore.

237
01:01:32,678 --> 01:01:35,318
My brother-in-law.

238
01:01:36,598 --> 01:01:38,598
Eat.

239
01:01:42,518 --> 01:01:46,518
He knows his way around these parts.
He can take you across.

240
01:02:05,798 --> 01:02:08,398
That won’t do.

241
01:02:13,158 --> 01:02:18,438
Don’t limp.
Your body needs to get used to the pain.

242
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:21,038
Straighten up.

243
01:02:22,398 --> 01:02:24,398
Good.

244
01:02:25,438 --> 01:02:27,318
Keep up.

245
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:30,798
Do you want to go now
or after sundown?

246
01:04:31,398 --> 01:04:36,118
They’ll have processed three transports
before sundown.

247
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:17,278
Freddy!
Freddy, get up!

248
01:08:55,078 --> 01:08:58,638
-Good morning.
-Easy, boy.

249
01:09:00,878 --> 01:09:03,398
Come get some breakfast.

250
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:11,518
Thank you.

251
01:09:25,278 --> 01:09:27,958
Here, have some.

252
01:09:54,598 --> 01:09:57,358
-Praise the Lord.
-Amen.

253
01:09:58,558 --> 01:10:02,438
He’s one of us.
You couldn’t ask for better cover.

254
01:10:09,478 --> 01:10:11,718
Take care.

255
01:10:13,398 --> 01:10:16,638
And good luck in Žilina.

256
01:12:00,558 --> 01:12:02,798
Come.

257
01:12:40,118 --> 01:12:42,118
Welcome, gentlemen.

258
01:12:42,478 --> 01:12:46,198
Alas, Mr Warren from the Red Cross
couldn’t make it today.

259
01:12:46,358 --> 01:12:51,318
Hopefully tomorrow. In the meantime,
we’ll question you ourselves.

260
01:12:53,158 --> 01:12:57,118
A lot has been said about the camps.

261
01:12:57,278 --> 01:13:01,838
I’m glad you’ll finally be able
to shed some light on all the ‘rumours’.

262
01:13:02,278 --> 01:13:04,478
Thank you.

263
01:13:06,878 --> 01:13:11,278
Well, was it hard
to get out of Auschwitz?

264
01:13:39,078 --> 01:13:41,638
I don’t know...

265
01:13:46,638 --> 01:13:49,878
What do you expect us to do?

266
01:13:51,358 --> 01:13:54,398
I thought you were the resistance.

267
01:13:54,478 --> 01:13:58,238
If you’re asking us what to do,
then we’ve come to the wrong place.

268
01:13:58,318 --> 01:14:02,518
You need to understand,
we don’t have that kind of clout.

269
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:06,358
-We’re just...
-Wait until tomorrow.

270
01:14:07,078 --> 01:14:12,558
If you want to get this to someone
important, you need to convince Warren.

271
01:14:14,878 --> 01:14:20,678
But...
There is one way we can help you.

272
01:16:19,838 --> 01:16:22,038
You’re late!

273
01:16:27,598 --> 01:16:31,718
Do you realise the trouble
we had to go through...

274
01:26:25,718 --> 01:26:31,158
Right, left, right, left...

275
01:26:57,438 --> 01:27:00,438
Well, well!
The man of faith.

276
01:27:00,798 --> 01:27:03,038
I’ve heard a lot about you.

277
01:27:03,478 --> 01:27:07,718
Herr Lausmann sends his cordial
regards from Berlin. Left!

278
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:10,958
Left.

279
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:15,798
-Left, left, left...
-No, please. I’m fine, please...

280
01:27:17,438 --> 01:27:20,678
Los!
Move it, you swine!

281
01:27:21,318 --> 01:27:23,638
Move it, quick!

282
01:29:40,198 --> 01:29:45,558
We are becoming a colony of Zionism,
where we, the local people,

283
01:29:45,718 --> 01:29:48,758
play the role of mere spectators.

284
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:52,558
We won't be fooled
by Jewish and Zionist lies

285
01:29:52,678 --> 01:29:56,638
about the 'evil' wartime Slovak State
and about the 'democracy' we have today.

286
01:29:57,238 --> 01:30:03,158
Your neighbourhood, your village,
your children's school, your life, salary

287
01:30:03,478 --> 01:30:06,758
will be irreversibly impacted
by immigration.

288
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:13,118
As president, I will restore the borders
on my first day in office.

289
01:30:14,038 --> 01:30:20,998
When I take office, the Gypsy question
will be resolved in a year and a day.

290
01:30:22,038 --> 01:30:25,278
The term itself will vanish
from the Prešov region.

291
01:30:25,438 --> 01:30:28,638
The Gypsy question will be no more.

292
01:30:45,558 --> 01:30:49,518
I wish all of you here in Žilina
a pleasant, white day.

293
01:30:51,638 --> 01:30:58,198
Thankfully, the Red Pestilence
no longer treads our lands.

294
01:31:01,318 --> 01:31:06,758
That, however, does not mean
that it was not replaced by a new plague,

295
01:31:07,238 --> 01:31:12,758
which now tries to subdue
our hearts, minds, and souls.

296
01:31:16,558 --> 01:31:19,198
It is not red, but the colour of rainbow.

297
01:31:19,358 --> 01:31:23,358
Who would love homosexuals?
No one, okay? No one.

298
01:31:32,718 --> 01:31:36,638
Once I succeed,
I will stop the financing of NGOs.

299
01:31:36,758 --> 01:31:40,278
These useless people
will have to start working...

300
01:31:41,438 --> 01:31:45,998
The leaders of the European Left
are all talk.

301
01:31:46,118 --> 01:31:50,558
Blah, blah, blah!
Generosity, solidarity, hospitality...

302
01:31:50,758 --> 01:31:56,558
And the Italians are evil, racist,
ignorant, egotistical fascists, Nazis...

303
01:32:36,438 --> 01:32:41,278
We cannot allow that Germans
become the minority in Germany.

304
01:32:42,038 --> 01:32:44,558
That is the essential thing!
