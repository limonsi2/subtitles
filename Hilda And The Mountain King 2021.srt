3
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,916
-Hilda!

4
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,501
Stay away from me!

5
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,544
-I won't hurt you.

6
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,756
-Wait!
-Leave me alone!

7
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,398
Please. I can explain.

8
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,359
You can talk now?

9
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,777
I could always talk.

10
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,321
It's just that you understand me,

11
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,823
now that you're a troll.

12
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,701
I am not a troll.

13
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,745
I didn't mean…

14
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,474
Hilda, wait!

15
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,186
I'm going home!

16
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,564
Please, don't go out there!

17
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,516
Baba, baba, baba!

18
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,434
Huh?

19
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,519
Baba, baba!

20
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,521
Ba!

21
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:51,940
Baba!

22
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,693
Baba!

23
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,946
-Hey! Can you--
-Baba, baba!

24
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,073
It was really quite hard
to stack all that.

25
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,077
She was in Hilda's bed?

26
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,453
-Baba!

27
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,498
Yes. Just like I said.

28
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,585
I made breakfast, went in,
and she was just there, and Hilda wasn't.

29
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:15,838
Unless…

30
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,174
Baba. Ba?

31
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,469
You couldn't be Hilda, could you, somehow?

32
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,055
Baba.

33
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,601
Baba!

34
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,397
In light of your recent
escapades with trolls,

35
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,316
I'd say this is a changeling.

36
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,151
-A what?
-A swap!

37
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:41,072
A troll child in human form
who's taken Hilda's place.

38
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,408
Hang on.

39
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,538
You're the little troll
from inside the mountain.

40
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,873
I do recognize you.

41
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:55,545
But if you're here and you're like this,
then that means Hilda must be…

42
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,560
I don't understand.
This is the place, isn't it, Twig?

43
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,061
Where we escaped.

44
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,648
Then, shouldn't there be a cave somewhere?

45
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,485
We won't find it just by standing here.
Let's look around and keep an eye on…

46
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,820
Baba.

47
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,822
Baba.

48
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,334
Oh, there's so many of them.

49
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,546
Do you think one of these could be--

50
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,423
Right. How many is that now?

51
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,634
-That's 11 or 12.
-Right, so that's a good job.

52
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,095
Oh. Safety Patrol.

53
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,556
I wonder what they're up to.

54
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,519
Good morning! Good morning.

55
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,022
Looking good. Ooh! Good to see you.

56
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,695
We've all seen the fires in the hills.

57
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,490
You've no doubt heard rumors
about sudden increases

58
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,158
in troll numbers and so on.

59
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,576
And I want you to know

60
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,703
I hear your concerns.

61
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,874
That is why I am here to announce a curfew

62
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:19,295
on all beyond-wall activity after sundown.

63
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:26,636
In addition, I pledge today
to once more put a man, or woman,

64
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,806
in every tower along our historic wall.

65
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,684
Applications for volunteer bell ringers
are now open.

66
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,063
Yes, you there.

67
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,564
Are the rumors true?

68
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,566
Is there a danger of an attack?

69
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,527
Well, of course!

70
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,197
But that is why I am here.

71
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,077
My people are out there,
belling troll rocks even as we speak.

72
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,286
And not only that,

73
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,749
we've been preparing for an eventuality
like this for quite some time.

74
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,961
Our technology
is more effective than ever.

75
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:05,508
I present to you our state-of-the-art,
troll-buster mobile light cannon.

76
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,850
Imagine for a moment
a dedicated fleet of these babies

77
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,019
guarding every corner of our fair city.

78
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,400
A fleet, sir?

79
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,278
You are aware we have
just one troll-buster vehicle?

80
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,530
They don't need to know that.

81
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,493
Good citizens, please be reassured.

82
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,830
<i>Your safety is safe with me.</i>

83
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,208
Now, there's a man
who's got the right idea.

84
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,961
I do feel safer
with an Ahlberg protecting us.

85
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,589
I didn't, when I was stuck
on a mountain with him.

86
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:48,050
Of course you didn't.
You were surrounded by trolls!

87
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,470
We were so worried, sweetie!

88
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,972
He did get you back safely,
though, didn't he?

89
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,976
Where are you off to?

90
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,480
We said you don't have to go
to school today, remember?

91
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,650
I'd rather do something
than sit here all day watching trash TV.

92
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,210
Hey! You're here!

93
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,794
No thanks to my parents.

94
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,338
Yours too?

95
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,883
I just want things to get back to normal
as quickly as possible.

96
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,259
How's your leg?

97
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,554
Mmm, it's still a bit sore,
but it feels much better.

98
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,557
No sign of Hilda?

99
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,894
She and her mum went through a lot.

100
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,231
We might not need the time off,
but I'm not surprised that she does.

101
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,609
Come on, let's get to class.

102
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,987
Now, children.

103
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,197
I'm sorry to say

104
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,700
our regularly-scheduled lesson
is canceled today.

105
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,330
Instead, we have a visitor.

106
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:03,209
Officer Selby
from the Trolberg Safety Patrol.

107
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,295
-Hello.
-He's brought a video.

108
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,885
-<i>Trolls.</i>

109
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,054
<i>Fearsome.</i>

110
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:18,724
<i>Blood-thirsty.</i>
<i>With a taste for human flesh.</i>

111
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,144
<i>But are they really so dangerous?</i>

112
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,564
<i>Yes! That's why we must make sure…</i>

113
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,023
Um, Ms. Hallgrim.

114
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,484
-Ms. Hallgrim?
-Huh?

115
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,736
Frida.

116
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,490
This isn't true.
They don't have a taste for human flesh.

117
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,576
They like vegetables as much as anything.

118
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,702
And Jorts.

119
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,706
If you could save your thoughts
until after the video.

120
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,419
<i>Trolls and humans</i>
<i>may be natural enemies</i>…

121
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,796
We are not natural enemies.

122
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,423
Frida, please.

123
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,594
<i>…the heroic endeavors</i>
<i>of Safety Patrol have kept the peace</i>

124
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,305
<i>for the citizens of Trolberg</i>
<i>for generations,</i>

125
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:01,892
<i>by remaining vigilant</i>
<i>and staying one step ahead of the threat</i>

126
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,352
<i>at every turn.</i>

127
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,855
<i>But it wasn't always so easy.</i>

128
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,691
<i>When man first came to this valley,</i>

129
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:12,403
<i>savage attacks by trolls</i>
<i>were tragically common.</i>

130
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:17,825
<i>Our ancestors may not have survived</i>
<i>if it wasn't for one thing.</i>

131
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,620
<i>The symbol of Trolberg,</i>

132
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,622
<i>the humble bell.</i>

133
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:28,002
<i>Now, under the leadership of Erik Ahlberg,</i>

134
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,962
<i>Head Officer of Safety Patr--</i>

135
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,422
Huh? Hey! You can't--

136
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,924
Ms. Hallgrim! With all due respect,

137
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:38,304
I can say with first-hand experience
that none of that is true.

138
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,890
Trolls aren't just mindless people-eaters.

139
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,893
-My grandfather was eaten by a troll!
-No way!

140
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,603
-They're evil.
-They are not!

141
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,814
My great-grandmother raised a troll
that she found in her garden.

142
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,233
Yeah, it probably grew up
to eat my grandfather.

143
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,402
-It didn't!
-Children!

144
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,404
My parents say they steal children.

145
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,614
That's not true!

146
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,616
Are you calling my parents liars?

147
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,201
I'm calling you stupid.

148
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,661
Listen!

149
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,747
Most of you have spent
your whole lives in Trolberg.

150
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,917
Have you ever heard of anyone
actually being eaten by a troll?

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,044
-Uh, no.
-No, not really.

152
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,964
You shouldn't have to sit here
and be taught lies, and I won't.

153
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,843
I can't believe
algebra was canceled for this.

154
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,982
Hilda!

155
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,152
Hilda!

156
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,408
We've been searching all day.
Are we walking in circles?

157
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,284
I don't think so.

158
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,204
How have
we not found a single cave?

159
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,458
She's in there, I know it.
But if we can't get in--

160
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,127
Ow!

161
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,504
Um, excuse me. Excuse me, Miss.

162
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,339
Is everything okay here?

163
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,925
Fine! Everything's fine.

164
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,468
It's not safe for you to be

165
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,887
outside the walls
so late in the day, ma'am.

166
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,973
Much less your, uh…

167
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,057
children.

168
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,852
May I ask what you're doing out here?

169
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,854
You haven't heard about the curfew?

170
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:10,896
Curfew?

171
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,149
Oh! Oh, we're looking for…

172
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,073
Berries. You know? To make jam.

173
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,992
Please! Do no such thing.

174
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,494
Those berries
are intensely poisonous, ma'am.

175
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,914
-Oh, I knew that.

176
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,834
No! I didn't mean
these berries.

177
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,713
Sir?

178
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,215
They're stirring.

179
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,429
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
Please don't make me insist.

180
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:47,141
Right. Well, then, let's go, children.

181
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,267
This way.

182
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,859
Why did you lie to him?

183
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,528
Because they're looking for
the same thing we are, Tontu.

184
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,114
But I'm not sure we're on the same side.

185
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,476
Right. I was going home.

186
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,207
Huh?

187
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,723
The sound of them.

188
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,184
That little one was one thing.

189
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,937
The ones on the wall are going to kill me.

190
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,313
-Hey, in here.

191
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,566
Whoa!

192
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,327
What are you hiding from?

193
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,411
A troll.

194
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,788
Are you not a troll?

195
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,789
No.

196
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,417
Are you sure about that?

197
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,190
I'm sorry.

198
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,777
You're hiding from a troll,
and you found a troll.

199
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,154
That must be quite annoying.

200
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,659
I'm Trundle, by the way,
if you're interested.

201
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,411
Hilda.

202
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:59,041
You're a lot bigger
than the troll I'm hiding from.

203
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,710
Yes, it's a shame.

204
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,801
If I wasn't,
then maybe I could get out of here

205
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,345
as easily as you got in.

206
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,974
The bells. You're trapped in here.

207
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,227
Ah, don't worry yourself about it.

208
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,108
I guess neither of us
are where we want to be.

209
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,861
I didn't know it was like this.

210
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,781
How am I ever going to get home
with these things in the way?

211
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,782
Home?

212
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,910
Yes, home. Trolberg.

213
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,579
What would you do once you were there?

214
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:42,042
You're a troll. They built a big wall
to keep you out, you know.

215
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:53,137
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you want.

216
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,472
I know it's not much.

217
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,392
Is…

218
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,102
Is it permanent?

219
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,687
It depends.

220
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,190
The other trolls won't tell you this,

221
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:10,446
but there is a way to change you back.

222
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,949
There is?

223
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:19,621
It's an old magic, rarely practiced.

224
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,917
In theory, I could do it,

225
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,295
but not in my present state.

226
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,841
I would need you
to do a few things for me.

227
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:31,884
What?

228
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:35,095
Anything. Name it, and I'll do it.

229
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,059
And this would have to remain
between you and me.

230
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,643
No one else can know.

231
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,272
Whatever. Just tell me.

232
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,523
Well,

233
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:51,528
first, I could really use a drink.

234
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,864
Some troll mead would be nice.

235
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,826
Hilda! Hilda!

236
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,913
It's that troll. She won't give up.

237
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,456
You should go to her.

238
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,624
Hilda!

239
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,750
Are you crazy?

240
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,460
She's the one that did this to me.

241
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,213
You may find this hard to understand,

242
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:13,133
but there was a kindness in her magic.

243
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,553
She won't allow any harm to come to you.

244
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:22,434
In fact, she will take care of you
as though you were her own child.

245
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,353
Yeah, well, I'm definitely not.

246
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,814
Nevertheless…

247
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,524
Hilda!

248
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:34,113
…as long as you're out here,
that troll is your mother.

249
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,742
And a mother's love
should not be taken for granted.

250
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,253
I should still be looking for her.
We should never have come home.

251
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,380
No, you need rest.

252
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,633
Besides, it's no good
if you get yourself eaten.

253
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:58,011
She really is quite resourceful,
that daughter of yours.

254
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,056
I'm sure she's made some arrangements.

255
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,143
-She shouldn't have to make-- Ow!
-Baba, baba, baba!

256
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,769
Please, can you just…

257
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,862
Ugh! You stupid, stupid--

258
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,200
Hey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to shout, I--

259
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,455
Hey, hey, it's gonna be okay.
I've got you.

260
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,415
Shh.

261
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,417
-Come on.
-Baba.

262
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,889
I still don't really understand why.
Why you did it.

263
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,183
My daughter is a gentle soul.

264
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,810
You've seen what it can be like out here.

265
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,897
Turning to stone. The bells.

266
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,859
This is no place for her
at the best of times,

267
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,611
and there's trouble brewing.

268
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,908
Even so,
you can't just swap people like that.

269
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,326
It's kidnapping!

270
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,832
What is that?

271
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,795
It's like a sound. But more of a feeling.

272
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,924
I can't hear it, but I know it's there.

273
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,425
We all feel it.

274
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,803
I don't know what it is,
but it's always been there.

275
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,056
Calling us towards the city.

276
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,936
Have you ever wondered why we stay here
among these particular mountains

277
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,813
when we are so clearly unwelcome?

278
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,690
I always thought it was pretty obvious.

279
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,984
You were here long before Trolberg was.

280
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,991
I don't think I ever realized
there were this many of you out here.

281
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,245
The calling has become stronger lately.

282
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,667
It's bringing more and more of us
out of the mountains each night.

283
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,169
The humans have noticed.

284
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,463
I'm sure they imagine

285
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,591
there's some kind of plan
to storm the city.

286
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,052
There isn't, though, right?

287
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,888
Of course not, but that's not the point.

288
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,641
There are some that want to lash out,

289
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,519
to answer the call the only way they can.

290
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,783
But, could they really do anything?
With the wall, and those bells?

291
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,660
Maybe not.

292
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,540
It'll be sunrise soon.
We should rest. Big day tomorrow.

293
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,250
What are we doing?

294
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,585
Showing you how to be a troll.

295
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,388
-Oh!

296
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,021
Huh!

297
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:57,274
Perhaps we could erect
some kind of large net,

298
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,985
to catch anything
thrown over and prevent--

299
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:04,156
No, no, no, no. That doesn't capture
the imagination enough.

300
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:08,327
They need something to look towards,
not practical solutions.

301
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,953
But, sir, given the--

302
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,372
-What's this?
-That is a gun, sir.

303
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,374
It utilizes a compact version

304
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,836
of the technology
from the troll-buster cannon, but--

305
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,380
Yes! This could be just the thing.

306
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,842
But sir, that is a one-of-a-kind,
untested prototype.

307
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,802
I am not sure it even works.

308
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,598
Come, Gerda. The people await!

309
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,645
<i>Boulders are just big stones</i>,

310
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,981
<i>and thrown stones are no match</i>

311
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,776
<i>for the latest</i>
<i>in state-of-the-art troll deterrence.</i>

312
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:45,072
<i>This baby will turn a full-size troll</i>
<i>into a harmless pile of gravel.</i>

313
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:50,077
If Hilda is how we think she is, Tontu,
we need to find her before they do.

314
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,371
-We should be out there looking.
-Baba.

315
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,830
Baba, shoes on.

316
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,249
-Baba. Baba-baba.

317
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,044
Why don't I stay here and look after her?

318
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,714
We'll only slow you down anyway.
You'll cover more ground.

319
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:03,840
If you're sure.

320
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,718
Between Alfur and I,
I think we can handle her.

321
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,096
-Actually, uh…

322
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,057
Cedric here and I
are going to help out with the search.

323
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,476
-Oh, I see.

324
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,894
Beep.

325
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,812
Baba, baba.

326
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,480
-Baba.
-Oh.

327
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:05,235
Don't tell Johanna, but you're actually
a lot less trouble than the regular kid.

328
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,864
Ooh.

329
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,824
Baba, baba!

330
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,078
Hey, Baba.

331
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,790
What's a five-letter word
meaning "hairy thief?"

332
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,125
Baba?

333
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,090
Oh!

334
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,384
No, no, no, no, no!

335
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,385
Baba!

336
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,554
-Baba, baba, baba!

337
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,600
Baba, baba!

338
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,648
-Baba.
-Baba!

339
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,233
Baba.

340
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,110
Excuse me. Sorry!

341
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,820
-Baba!

342
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,133
Sloppy work. Make a note of this, Deputy.

343
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,970
We'll need
another bell team out here sharpish.

344
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,389
Sir, forgive my pointing it out.

345
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,017
But you know the effects these bells have.

346
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,229
Should we not be looking
at ways to calm the situation

347
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,897
rather than stir it up?

348
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,814
You see this?

349
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,235
This is what we're up against!

350
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:32,614
Cowards.
They turn to stone rather than face me.

351
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:36,701
And the rest slink off
and disappear once the sun is up.

352
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,121
It strikes me
that they are keeping to themselves, sir.

353
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,083
It strikes me that
they are denying us victory.

354
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,834
-And if they--

355
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,211
What is that?

356
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,838
It appears to be a pigeon, sir.

357
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,802
Cedric!

358
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,975
We need to get inside the mountain.

359
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,394
-Sir?
-Take them by surprise.

360
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,271
Secure the advantage.

361
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,399
But nobody has ever found a way
into troll country.

362
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,527
Nobody yet.

363
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,029
But if we can do this, Deputy Gerda,

364
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:17,409
my name will go down
in the annals of Trolberg history.

365
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,995
Come, we have plans to make.

366
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,676
Silence the bells! Silence the bells!

367
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,595
Silence the bells!

368
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,471
Silence the bells!

369
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,933
-Ahlberg smells! Silence the bells!

370
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,729
Silence the bells?
Exactly whose side are you on?

371
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,106
We're on the side
of peace and communication.

372
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,859
The enemies of misinformation and fear.

373
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,988
Really? Well, I'd love to hear
what your teachers have to say about that.

374
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:59,367
Their teacher is very proud of them
and would ask you to move along.

375
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,327
Hmm!

376
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,872
Silence the bells! Silence the--

377
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,798
David, what's this about?

378
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,551
It's my mum.
She's only gone and volunteered

379
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,679
to be one of Ahlberg's
emergency bell-ringers.

380
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,891
And I'm guessing
she wouldn't approve of all this.

381
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,061
I can't face the conversation.

382
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,521
Huh. Still got it.

383
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,026
-Tontu!

384
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,111
Oh, you got her.

385
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,446
Thanks, guys.

386
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,031
-Who's this?

387
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,450
You think you can help me
get her back home?

388
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,535
I'll explain on the way.

389
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,205
Hilda's a troll?

390
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,457
Yes, it's not ideal.

391
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,625
Oh, boy!

392
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,960
The question is,
what are we going to do about it?

393
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:54,964
Well, you're a witch. Is there a spell
or something that could turn her back?

394
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,549
There has to be.

395
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,843
Come on, let's ask Kaisa.

396
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,555
-What did I do with my jumper?

397
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,687
Baba!

398
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,938
Ugh!

399
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,902
Body swapping. I think
this is the book you're looking for.

400
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,987
-Thanks.
-Wait.

401
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,198
-Whose bodies are we swapping?
-Hilda's!

402
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,867
She's been swapped
with a troll changeling child,

403
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,828
and we need to change her back.

404
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:28,248
Ah. That's not going to work, I'm afraid.

405
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,166
What? Why?

406
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,837
Troll magic. It's just, uh…
Works differently.

407
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,715
You can't counter
a troll spell with witch magic.

408
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,216
They don't combine.

409
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,259
-At all.
-But--

410
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:43,221
On top of that, witches do not like
to get involved in troll affairs.

411
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,765
It's kind of a protocol thing

412
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,102
that the council
would love to explain to you in detail.

413
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,646
But this is Hilda we're talking about.

414
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,939
You know her.

415
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,235
I do. And so I know
she'll find her own way out of this.

416
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,945
You seriously can't help?

417
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,833
Whoa.

418
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,418
Yes!

419
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,627
Hmm.

420
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,924
Did you sleep well?

421
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,428
As well as can be expected.

422
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,481
Where are we going?

423
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,441
-To have breakfast.
-Huh?

424
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,693
Humans have breakfast, don't they?

425
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,667
Do you think there's anything vegetarian?

426
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,544
Oh! Thank you.

427
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,421
Oh!

428
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,841
It's okay
if you want to nibble on my leaf.

429
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,384
Uh…

430
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,222
A drink for you.

431
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,015
Mmm, thank you.

432
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,935
Mmm. Ah!

433
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,188
Oh, I love this stuff. What is it?

434
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,648
That's troll mead.

435
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,566
Powerful stuff.

436
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,153
Just a sip will keep
a thing like you running for days.

437
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:26,157
You know, I think I'm gonna go
stretch my legs if that's okay.

438
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,992
-I won't be long.
-Okay.

439
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,036
Hmm. Too much troll mead.

440
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,163
Say, who's got it anyway?

441
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,504
Ah! That's the stuff.

442
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:44,217
I feel like I could pull
the horns off a forest giant.

443
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,469
Is that a good thing?

444
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,389
It's something.

445
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,933
So, what's next?

446
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,184
Next?

447
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,561
Yes, next.

448
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,355
What's the next thing I need to do
for you to turn me back?

449
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,314
Oh!

450
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,400
No time to chat?

451
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,818
Uh…

452
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,320
No, no, you're in a hurry.

453
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:09,325
Who'd want to be a troll
longer than they have to be?

454
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,660
I'm sorry, I didn't--

455
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,955
The next thing I would ask of you

456
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:19,043
is that you remove
those dreadful bells from my front door.

457
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,463
What? How am I supposed to do that?

458
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,217
If I knew, I would have done it myself.

459
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,886
Humph.

460
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,931
Tell me. Why are there so many bells here?

461
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,809
Someone obviously
didn't want you to leave.

462
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:39,772
They were worried enough about you
to put a bell on your nose.

463
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,525
What do you think they make of me?

464
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,444
Mmm.

465
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,113
If it's too much trouble…

466
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,531
No.

467
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,700
I'll figure it out.

468
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,626
-What is it, Twig? Do you smell something?

469
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,757
Trolls!

470
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,802
I don't see her with them.
But look, the cave.

471
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:13,431
I knew it was around here.
It looks like they're on the move.

472
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,732
Hey, you! Wait! Don't walk away from me.

473
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,028
Wha… What?

474
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,780
What? No, no!

475
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,033
No! Open up! Give her back to me!

476
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,505
Just give me a minute. Okay, Twig?

477
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,386
-Uh, Johanna?

478
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:52,929
Oh.

479
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,764
-Okay, um…

480
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,599
Don't panic.

481
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,020
There's no reason to believe
they aren't friendly.

482
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:05,108
Hello. I… I don't mean any harm.
I'm looking for my daughter.

483
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,111
You see, I think
she might have been-- Ahh!

484
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,072
-No! Please, I don't--

485
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,490
Ow!

486
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,540
Evasive maneuvers!

487
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,583
Evasive maneuvers!

488
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,254
Cedric!

489
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,631
No!

490
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,152
-Start, start, start!

491
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,886
Sorry for wandering off before.

492
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,805
Why would someone apologize for wandering?

493
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,349
-Well, I--
-You didn't miss anything.

494
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:24,437
We caught the scent of some trolls
looking to steal our food. So we left.

495
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,397
Why would they do that?

496
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:31,027
-Shouldn't you all be friends?
-You mean how all humans are friends?

497
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:37,200
There are all kinds of trolls here,
all with different ideas and priorities.

498
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:41,662
Good, bad, stupid,
it can be hard to find common ground.

499
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,831
It's a shame you can't work together more.

500
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,085
You need, like, some laws
or a leader or something.

501
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,963
Come. I should show you something.

502
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,515
What is that place?

503
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,725
That was once the home of a troll

504
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,020
that called himself the Mountain King.

505
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,730
Mountain King?

506
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,733
He was the only one
that ever managed to unite

507
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:14,237
any real number of us
around a single idea.

508
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,406
That's the sort of thing
I'm talking about. What idea?

509
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,743
To lead an army of trolls
to attack the city.

510
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,206
Oh. Mmm. And what… What happened to him?

511
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,676
Whoa.

512
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,933
The idea proved to be quite popular.

513
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,814
But not everyone agreed with it.

514
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,317
There was a battle.

515
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:01,742
In the end, he was defeated
before his goal could be achieved.

516
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,752
No troll has tried
to crown themselves king or queen since.

517
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,298
Maybe you don't need a leader, then.

518
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,428
-All right.

519
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,972
The spell says we need organic matter.

520
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,391
Luckily, I found some of Hilda's hair

521
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:29,061
tangled in this random stick
she left here for some reason.

522
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,396
But the troll kid--

523
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,523
Oh! I've got just the thing!

524
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,692
Perfect.

525
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,613
Okay, then that should be it.

526
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:39,947
Ew.

527
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,116
I hope this works.

528
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,159
Me too.

529
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:49,123
<i>Gifr syn, gifr syn, gifr syn…</i>

530
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,503
Uh, maybe you should check the footnotes?

531
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,008
This place is really something.

532
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,176
You think so?

533
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,470
Apart from breakfast
and not getting robbed,

534
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,096
what do we do all day?

535
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,098
Well, the same as humans, I suppose.

536
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:09,227
-Whatever we want.
-We don't do whatever we want.

537
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,313
We have to go to school
and have jobs and schedules.

538
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,440
You don't want to do those things?

539
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,775
Not really.

540
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,401
That might just be you.

541
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,947
And the sort of thing
that made me think you'd like it here.

542
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,406
Hmm.

543
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,660
What do we do? Hmm.

544
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,787
We drink. Eat.

545
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,498
Think. Wander.

546
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,541
Throw each other.

547
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,793
Throw each other?

548
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,337
-Yes. You know?
-Wait!

549
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,510
It's like a game!

550
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,935
See? You're getting
the hang of it already.

551
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,778
What are the piles of junk all about?

552
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,779
We gather it.

553
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:05,366
Things the humans have dumped
or don't seem to need anymore.

554
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,369
Hmm? Hmm?

555
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,208
-What does she want with that?
-It's probably for her hoard.

556
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,670
Hoards! I've read
about troll-treasure hoards.

557
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,798
I'm sure that you have. Let me show you.

558
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:28,639
The treasure you're probably thinking of
is quite hard to come by these days.

559
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,935
Modern trolls tend to focus
on a more modest and curated collection.

560
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,812
Like what?

561
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,230
Car parts.

562
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,482
Barrels, buckets, and pine cones.

563
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,608
Bones!

564
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,776
What do you collect?

565
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,571
Soft furnishings.

566
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,864
Whoa-ho!

567
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,080
Mmm, this is more like it.

568
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,920
<i>Gifr syn, gifr syn…</i>

569
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,633
I'm sick of saying, "<i>Gifr syn</i>"!

570
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,098
Look! There's the troll kid.

571
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,019
And there's Hilda!

572
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,858
Is that meant to be happening?

573
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,444
I don't think so. Um…

574
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,222
I guess that's what Kaisa meant
by, "Doesn't combine well."

575
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,099
-Yeah.
-Don't worry.

576
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,976
We'll find some
other non-bucket-related way to help.

577
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,188
You know, when we saw her,
it kind of looked like--

578
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,065
She was enjoying herself.

579
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,067
Whoo-hoo!

580
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,825
You're having fun?

581
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:15,663
Are you kidding? With this troll body,
I feel like I could run a hundred miles.

582
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,207
Whoo-hoo!

583
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:23,295
Or lift up an entire mountain!

584
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,510
There's so much space out here.

585
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,555
No roads, cars,

586
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:35,057
fences and walls.

587
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,518
I'd forgotten.

588
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,356
Race you to the top of the mountain?

589
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,702
What do you think?

590
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,250
It beats the view from my bedroom window.

591
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,504
So, weird question.

592
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,173
Do I have a troll dad anywhere?

593
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,050
No, why?

594
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,885
No reason.

595
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,722
Trolls aren't usually born
in the sense that you are.

596
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,183
You mean you don't have a mum?

597
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,353
There was a troll once,
a mother to all of us.

598
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,981
But she died a long time ago.

599
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,198
My daughter came to me.

600
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:17,576
But we are all the children
of the stones in the Earth.

601
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,248
You miss her already, don't you?

602
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,249
Your daughter.

603
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:42,268
Do you have a hoard?
You must collect something.

604
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,770
I don't need much to feel content.

605
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,564
But I do have this.

606
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,943
-Oh!
-I know it's not much.

607
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,072
I think it's wonderful.

608
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,533
Well, they're yours now.

609
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,952
I've had a nice time today.

610
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,246
But don't you see how wrong this all is?

611
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,873
Maybe this place
isn't perfect for your daughter,

612
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,459
but you've made things
really nice for her.

613
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,628
There's nothing
on the other side of that wall

614
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,630
that's better for her than this.

615
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,674
This is a home.

616
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,719
Her home. And she should be here with you.

617
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:20,264
Hmm. Maybe I have made a mistake.

618
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,765
So make it right!

619
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,686
Change us back. I know you can do it.

620
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,314
I can't. What's done is done.

621
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,523
I don't know a way.

622
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,068
It's been a long day.

623
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,320
We should sleep.

624
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,323
Are you telling me the truth?

625
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,117
You're not just saying that
to keep me here?

626
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,036
I'm sorry.

627
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:01,699
Very good. Very good.

628
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:05,661
I knew your human trickery
would get the job done.

629
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,539
Right, what next?

630
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,174
You sleep?

631
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:23,053
No. Did you hear
the trolls roaring last night?

632
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,680
It's like they were taunting me.

633
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,140
How's your scratch?

634
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,891
It's not too bad.

635
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,602
You could have been eaten.

636
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,730
I know.

637
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,526
Today has got to be the day.
We have got to get her back!

638
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,654
I don't think
we can do it on our own.

639
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,786
We know all about Hilda,
and we want to help.

640
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,084
So what's the plan?

641
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,962
Well, first,
we just have to make a quick stop.

642
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,093
Baba.

643
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,053
Wait. This is my house.

644
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,598
-What are you doing?

645
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,433
I'm so grateful that you want to help.

646
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,394
I really am.
You are the best friends Hilda could have.

647
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,355
But it's not right
to drag you kids into this. I'm sorry.

648
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,440
Hey!

649
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,734
Wait!

650
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,279
Didn't see that coming.

651
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,373
-Captain?

652
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,333
Ah!

653
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,669
Is it good news, officer? A new lead?

654
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,714
It's someone to see you, sir.
They say it's urgent.

655
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,594
Transformed into a troll.

656
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,971
I know it sounds strange.

657
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:52,226
Nothing entirely surprises me anymore.
Now, how do you think we can help you?

658
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,019
You're Safety Patrol, aren't you?

659
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:58,357
It's too dangerous out there,
but not for someone who has one of those.

660
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,485
You want an armed escort?

661
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,861
For my safety.

662
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:07,074
That's quite a request.
You're welcome to file a report.

663
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,367
But unfortunately--

664
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,453
Help me, and I'll show you
how to get inside the mountain.

665
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:17,751
I will escort you personally.

666
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,172
<i>-Y</i>es, sir. Understood, sir.
-<i>Do you understand?</i>

667
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:25,092
<i>-I hope I can count on you.</i>
-You can count on me, sir. Goodbye.

668
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:30,639
Ahlberg has just put me
in temporary command

669
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,933
of all of Safety Patrol.

670
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,852
So you can't help us.

671
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:38,939
I'm sorry, children.
I suddenly have quite a lot to do.

672
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,316
This is ridiculous.

673
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,652
Everyone we've turned to
either can't help,

674
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,071
won't help, or won't let us help.

675
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:47,656
Flipping grown-ups.

676
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,241
Did you hear the news?

677
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,661
Apparently, there were
so many troll rocks outside the town gate,

678
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,371
no cars could get through.

679
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:57,040
I'm telling you,
there's gonna be an attack or something.

680
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,417
Mark my words.

681
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,919
Oh. I don't know who else to turn to.

682
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,089
What would Hilda do?

683
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,216
She'd probably go and ask a troll.

684
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,094
David, that's it.
We should talk to the trolls.

685
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,513
But, Frida, trolls can't talk.

686
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,516
I know, but perhaps they don't need to.

687
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,311
-Do you remember the Kraken?

688
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,188
The giant tentacle monster-island thing?

689
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:23,191
Yep. Never, ever gonna forget that.

690
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:27,237
I was able to tap into its thoughts
and kind of speak to it.

691
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,073
Mind to mind.
If I can do that with a troll--

692
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,242
Then maybe it can help us find Hilda!

693
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,370
It'll be hard getting out there,
though, with the curfew.

694
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:44,755
My mum! She's gonna be
on bell duty at one of the gates tonight.

695
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,340
You could distract her.

696
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:47,758
I could.

697
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,261
But it means
you'll be out there on your own.

698
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,472
I don't think we've got much choice.

699
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:58,352
<i>The final thing I ask of you…</i>

700
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:04,900
<i>is to bring me something very special.</i>

701
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:11,573
<i>It lies in the home of the Mountain King.</i>

702
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,618
<i>His hoard is well hidden.</i>

703
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,746
<i>But I can tell you how to find it.</i>

704
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:01,748
<i>The object I require</i>
<i>is blood red,</i>

705
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,459
<i>and extremely precious.</i>

706
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,171
<i>You will know it when you see it.</i>

707
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,605
This must be it.

708
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,109
<i>Bring it to me</i>,

709
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:32,738
<i>and I will make you human once more.</i>

710
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,423
Hmm.

711
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,761
Huh?

712
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,806
Wait.

713
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,059
I'm me again!

714
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,895
What is this place?

715
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,899
Whoa!

716
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,531
Hilda!

717
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,532
Mum?

718
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,828
Hilda! Hilda!

719
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,705
Mum! I hear you.

720
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,123
I'm coming!

721
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:36,927
-Hilda, where are you?
-Mum! I… I don't…

722
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,098
No! Let me through!

723
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:44,559
Oh.

724
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:49,564
Uh, hello there. I'm Hilda.

725
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,661
Help!

726
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:08,834
Help me!

727
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,680
Hilda.

728
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,515
Mum?

729
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,943
What the heck was that?

730
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,572
Still a troll.

731
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,289
Come on then, orb.

732
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,583
Let's get out of here.

733
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,007
Oh.

734
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,050
I'm glad this place is abandoned.

735
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:06,308
If that Mountain King guy was still here,
this whole thing would have been a lot<i>…</i>

736
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:08,935
harder.

737
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,330
Baba, you ready?

738
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,042
Easy.

739
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,845
It works.

740
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,764
Uh, should it not?

741
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:56,524
He'll wake up in a couple of hours
with a splitting headache.

742
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,610
Ugh. This is the place.

743
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,738
Here? But, where's the cave?

744
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,784
I'll remind you, I've gone
well out of my way to be here personally.

745
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,580
If this turns out to be
a waste of my time…

746
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:16,836
Baba.

747
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:29,766
Ba.

748
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,643
There. That's the way in.

749
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,937
Now help me find my daughter.

750
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,106
"Ba-ba"?

751
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,072
Wait!

752
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,366
Mum.

753
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,451
-Troll!

754
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,915
Stay back, you beast!

755
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,156
Oh, I can't believe I found you!

756
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:11,451
I didn't know what to do. I was losing my…

757
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,453
I am so sorry.

758
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,830
Mum! It's okay.

759
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,291
We found each other.
That's all that matters.

760
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,126
Twig!

761
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,754
Tontu! Alfur! You're all here.

762
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,214
-Yes.
-Yeah.

763
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,050
And you. It's nice to see you again.

764
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,219
You've been looking after
my mum, I take it?

765
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,220
Ba!

766
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,806
Hilda. Look at you.

767
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,015
You're… You're--

768
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,559
Oh! Ah, you're strong!

769
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,813
I know. Hop on, Baba.
There's no time to lose.

770
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,942
Where are we going?

771
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,652
To put everything right.

772
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:58,623
There she is.

773
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,378
Looks
like the other tower is empty.

774
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:10,427
Use your eyes, try not to fall asleep,
and that's all there is to it.

775
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,386
Psst!

776
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:14,305
-Hey! Mum!

777
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,348
Who's that?

778
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,308
It's my son!

779
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,441
I have it! I found the thing!

780
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,901
Now you can change me back!

781
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,696
Trundle!

782
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:32,740
Trundle?

783
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,576
Weird.

784
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,995
He's always been here before.

785
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,037
Hilda.

786
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,625
You! Stay back.

787
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,252
No, Mum. It's okay.

788
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,172
I just found my daughter,

789
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:50,008
and I won't let you
take her from… me… again.

790
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,471
The bells. They're…

791
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,223
Hilda, what have you done?

792
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,183
Baba?

793
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,728
Baba!

794
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,062
Baba!

795
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,359
Ba! Ba! Ba! Ba! Ba!

796
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,277
Got you!

797
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:15,158
Take one more step towards this child,
beast, and I'll turn you to rubble.

798
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,914
Ahlberg? What's he doing here?

799
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,665
Oh! Another one!

800
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,709
-Put that thing away!

801
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,127
That's my daughter.

802
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,378
Is it?

803
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,048
Are you sure? Perhaps she was once.

804
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:33,801
But how can we be certain she's anything
but the blood-thirsty monster

805
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,053
she appears to be.

806
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,557
Ready to turn on us at any moment.

807
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,477
I'm telling you. Put that thing down,
or I'll take it off you.

808
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,103
And render me defenseless?

809
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,982
Good Lord, they've bewitched you
with their troll magic.

810
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,989
-I'll take that.

811
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,158
Baba!

812
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,122
Oh!

813
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,463
I'm warning you--

814
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,049
I'm warning you.

815
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:14,884
Mum!

816
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:17,887
Um, hi!

817
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,723
-Hilda, you're--
-Yep. I'm me again.

818
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:24,102
And I, uh… I don't have any clothes.

819
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,562
Oh.

820
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,897
Well, perhaps Baba
won't need hers anymore, so…

821
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,150
Oh.

822
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,529
Well, isn't it a good job
Tontu came along?

823
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,155
I brought spares.

824
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,074
How has this all happened?

825
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:43,162
Returning them to their true mothers
must have brought the spell full circle.

826
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:47,834
Effectively rendering
the changeling contract null and void.

827
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,711
If this was the way to break the spell,

828
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:52,297
then doing all that stuff
was just a waste of time.

829
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,382
I don't even need this freaky orb.

830
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,843
Hmm. It was right here.

831
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,177
Orb?

832
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,850
Where are the bells
that used to hang here?

833
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,018
I took them down.

834
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,520
Trundle said if I did,
it'd help him change me back.

835
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:11,190
Those bells were put there
a long time ago, for a very good reason.

836
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:14,277
This cave is a prison cell.

837
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,409
The prison cell of the Mountain King.

838
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,703
What? That doesn't make any sense.

839
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,914
Oh, hey. There's my orb.

840
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,003
At last!

841
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,516
Trundle?

842
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,645
Thank you for all your help, Hilda.

843
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:53,232
It looks like we both got what we wanted.

844
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,779
You… You liar! You tricked me!

845
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:58,821
He's…

846
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,740
…enormous!

847
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,245
He's heading straight for Trolberg!

848
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,082
We have to stop him.

849
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,126
Baba!

850
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,270
Okay, here we go.

851
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,565
Hello.

852
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,402
Can I help you with that?

853
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,333
There. That's better, isn't it?

854
01:01:56,713 --> 01:02:00,633
All right. If it's okay with you,
I just want to try something.

855
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,096
Huh! You're just as nervous as me.

856
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:07,724
You know, a lot of people think
there's an army of you

857
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,308
ready to attack Trolberg.

858
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:28,703
Oh, cruddlesticks.

859
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,526
What are they doing?

860
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,445
He's going to attack the city.

861
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:05,364
-Attack the city?
-What?

862
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,534
Ha! I don't know
what you're all so concerned about.

863
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,661
He's a big chap, I'll give him that,

864
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:14,624
but he'll turn around like all the others
once those bells start ringing.

865
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,711
David, what's all this about?

866
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:22,799
I know something's bothering you,
but I can't help or change anything

867
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,509
if you won't talk to me.

868
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,886
I'm doing this for you, you know.

869
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,847
-For me? You're the one who--

870
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,894
What's going on?

871
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:49,075
Okay. We're leaving.

872
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,306
Frida!

873
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:18,396
Oh!

874
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,247
Frida!

875
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,167
Mum?

876
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:01,564
Frida, quick! Inside.

877
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:28,633
Huh?

878
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:37,350
What?

879
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,858
I can't let you do this, brother.

880
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:50,321
And what is it you think
that I'm doing, exactly?

881
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:52,615
We both know what's happening here.

882
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,619
There's a reason I kept that eye from you.

883
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,789
I won't fight you, brother.

884
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:19,016
I'm not here to fight anyone.

885
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,148
Phew.

886
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,159
Are you okay?

887
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,244
I'm fine.

888
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,210
Take positions!

889
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,715
All eyes on that gate.

890
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,572
We're too late.

891
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:15,740
Please.

892
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:20,077
That wall has kept the people
of Trolberg safe for hundreds of years.

893
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:21,662
Eyes on the gate.

894
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,998
And mark my words…

895
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:25,332
Don't say it.

896
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,668
…it will continue to do so.

897
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,345
Oh, my!

898
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,439
Should we fire?

899
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,652
No, don't do anything.

900
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,536
One of them's breaking away.

901
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:11,170
-I can't let this happen.
-Hilda, wait.

902
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:18,010
This is my fault. I can speak to them.

903
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,720
Please, let me try.

904
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:22,807
Go.

905
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:33,567
Stop!

906
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:36,570
Hilda!

907
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,531
David!

908
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,700
Mum, I have to.

909
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:46,330
Don't go any further!

910
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:48,499
I know it looks like
you might win this fight,

911
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:50,251
but there'll be more men coming.

912
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:51,877
You'll be fighting forever.

913
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,712
Everybody loses.

914
01:08:58,467 --> 01:08:59,510
Please!

915
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,276
Listen to me!

916
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:16,777
Frida!

917
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:17,987
Are you okay?

918
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:20,197
Yeah. What are you doing here?

919
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:23,450
Looking for you,
hoping to avert disaster. The usual.

920
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:25,786
I came out and made
a mind connection with a troll

921
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:29,623
to find out what happened to you,
but, well, here you are.

922
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:33,335
Here I am.
And I feel like I've been here before.

923
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,963
Except that was me!

924
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:42,678
Frida, when you did your mind connection,
did you learn anything?

925
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:43,971
It was confusing.

926
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:47,141
But I did get something to do
with their mother.

927
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:49,351
Of course!

928
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:53,522
That's what's been calling them
to the city. A mother's love.

929
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,608
<i>Hilda!</i>

930
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:58,944
Oh, no. This is what he wants.

931
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,335
Come any closer, and we will open fire.

932
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,716
What's that?

933
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:24,220
I don't know. But it doesn't feel good.

934
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,347
Hey, where did Ahlberg go?

935
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,439
Deputy!

936
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:37,274
Sir?

937
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,693
It is very good to see you.

938
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:42,029
Prepare this weapon to fire.

939
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:43,489
Yes, sir.

940
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:02,341
Target acquired. Cannon is charged.

941
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:04,093
-Open fire.
-Stop!

942
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:07,096
Whatever you do, don't fire that thing.

943
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:09,181
Are you blind, child?

944
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,892
That monster
is about to trample the whole city.

945
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,686
This is going to sound crazy,

946
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:17,147
but I think there's
a giant troll underneath Trolberg.

947
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:20,943
Hundreds of times bigger than that one,
and she's worried about her children.

948
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:23,696
That's why he's here, to provoke you.

949
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,281
Because if you react,

950
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:28,200
if you harm them,
she won't just lie there.

951
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,411
She's going to defend them.

952
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:33,414
She's going to sit up,

953
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:36,000
destroying the entire city.

954
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,675
Fire at will, Deputy.

955
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,847
No.

956
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:55,394
You put me in charge, Erik,
and I am not following that order.

957
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:59,940
Then you're relieved. Move over.

958
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:03,569
No!

959
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,996
Please, don't!

960
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,087
Thanks for that.

961
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,424
Ba!

962
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,268
At the ready, people,
prepare to defend your city.

963
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:21,522
Please, let me talk to them.
We can stop this.

964
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:24,233
I don't think talking is going to cut it.

965
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:25,859
This is war!

966
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,569
It doesn't have to be.

967
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,967
Let's get out of here!

968
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:55,848
Listen to me.
Trolberg is about to be destroyed,

969
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:59,351
and if you don't take me seriously,
then it's going to be your fault.

970
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,728
That is enough of your nonsense.

971
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,481
Go back to your mother
and stay out of my way.

972
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:20,456
Hilda!

973
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,294
Throw me!

974
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:26,336
What?

975
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:28,714
Mmm.

976
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:39,933
Get that cannon recharged.

977
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:41,602
Uh, sir.

978
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:46,064
What the…

979
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:48,484
Where am I?

980
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:53,155
Oh, that kid
is really starting to get on my…

981
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,367
Erik.

982
01:14:58,076 --> 01:14:59,203
Mother.

983
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:09,338
What do we do?

984
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,466
We have to get out of here.

985
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:13,467
Agreed.

986
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,220
Baba!

987
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:18,555
Baba.

988
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:20,474
Baba, no!

989
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:25,229
Troll advancing.

990
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:26,855
-Open fire!
-Stand down!

991
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:27,940
Sir?

992
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:30,984
Uh… What do we do?

993
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:33,153
Nothing.

994
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,988
We do nothing.

995
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:40,661
Baba.

996
01:15:58,262 --> 01:15:59,721
Keep a close watch.

997
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,099
But just let them in.

998
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:03,785
They've stopped.
Why have they stopped here?

999
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,621
We're right above her.

1000
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:07,080
I can feel it too.

1001
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:10,667
But I'm not sure
if I can make sense of it on my own.

1002
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:11,877
Help me?

1003
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:22,429
<i>Her name is Amma.</i>

1004
01:17:22,512 --> 01:17:25,557
<i>The mother and grandmother to all trolls.</i>

1005
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:30,520
<i>She built these mountains a long time ago</i>
<i>as a home for her children.</i>

1006
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:36,026
<i>She would lie down to sleep between them,</i>
<i>surrounded by those she loved.</i>

1007
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:38,236
<i>One time, after a long rest,</i>

1008
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,114
<i>she woke up</i>
<i>to find a village had appeared.</i>

1009
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:43,116
<i>But she didn't want to disturb the people,</i>

1010
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,744
<i>so she decided</i>
<i>to remain there until they left.</i>

1011
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,413
<i>But the village grew and grew.</i>

1012
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:51,833
<i>It wasn't so bad at first.</i>
<i>Her children could still be close to her.</i>

1013
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,502
<i>She could speak to them.</i>

1014
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:56,922
<i>But the people drove them further</i>
<i>and further away from her.</i>

1015
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:59,132
<i>Then they built the wall.</i>

1016
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:07,015
Nothing was ever stopping her
from getting up.

1017
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:08,225
But she didn't do it.

1018
01:18:08,308 --> 01:18:11,395
She stayed there,
cut off from her children.

1019
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:14,231
For us. For our sakes.

1020
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,111
Do you feel that?

1021
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,477
What's happening to them?

1022
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:55,605
She's speaking.

1023
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:13,415
<i>It's hard to directly translate</i>
<i>the trolls' language.</i>

1024
01:19:13,498 --> 01:19:15,959
<i>But her words</i>
<i>were along the lines of this.</i>

1025
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:19,254
<i>"My children, I am proud of you."</i>

1026
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:21,339
<i>"You may not remember me,</i>

1027
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:24,342
<i>but I have never,</i>
<i>and will never, forget you."</i>

1028
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,678
<i>"Take care of one another."</i>

1029
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:30,932
<i>"Be strong, be good,</i>
<i>and know that I am never far away."</i>

1030
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:39,775
<i>Erik Ahlberg was presented with a medal</i>

1031
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:43,153
<i>for the "unshakable bravery</i>
<i>and quick diplomatic instincts</i>,<i>"</i>

1032
01:19:43,236 --> 01:19:45,947
<i>which prevented a catastrophic troll war.</i>

1033
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:49,868
<i>At the same event,</i>
<i>he announced his immediate retirement</i>

1034
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,369
<i>from public service.</i>

1035
01:19:52,704 --> 01:19:55,457
<i>Chief Officer Gerda Gustav's first act</i>

1036
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:59,419
<i>was to declare</i>
<i>an annual Night of the Trolls.</i>

1037
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,967
<i>Every year, the gates are to be opened,</i>

1038
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,845
<i>the bells are to be silenced,</i>
<i>and the people of the mountain</i>

1039
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:11,681
<i>allowed to walk peacefully into Trolberg.</i>

1040
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:18,271
<i>It's not perfect.</i>

1041
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:22,192
<i>Many people will still fear the trolls,</i>
<i>and they'll still fear us.</i>

1042
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:24,277
<i>But it's a start.</i>

1043
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:33,161
<i>And perhaps one day,</i>
<i>we'll live truly peacefully, side by side.</i>

1044
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:38,375
<i>There are, however, a few other nights</i>

1045
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:41,211
<i>you might find a troll in Trolberg.</i>

1046
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:42,546
Baba!

1047
01:20:44,464 --> 01:20:45,966
-A-ha!

1048
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:55,976
Baba, baba!

1049
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:09,072
<i>And once in a while,</i>
<i>I go out on the mountainside.</i>

1050
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:11,741
-Baba, ba!

1051
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:14,411
<i>And I get to be a troll.</i>

1052
01:21:14,494 --> 01:21:16,246
Whoo-hoo!

1053
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,209
Baba, ba!
