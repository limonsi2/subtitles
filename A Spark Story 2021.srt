<i>My name is Pete Docter. I'm the CCO,</i>

4
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,023
the Chief Creative Officer,
of Pixar Animation Studios.

5
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:27,527
<i>I've been at Pixar over 30 years now,</i>

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,740
but I've done all sorts of stuff from
storyboarding to animation to directing.

7
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:39,330
<i>Pixar's changed a lot,</i>
<i>but at its core, not at all.</i>

8
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,044
<i>When we started, we were in this,</i>
<i>like, shack of a building.</i>

9
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:48,214
<i>We had 112 people, I think,</i>
<i>making</i> Toy Story,

10
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:52,510
<i>and yet it was a very personal story.</i>

11
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,264
<i>We were, as storytellers,</i>
<i>telling our own experiences</i>

12
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,808
<i>in the world and figuring out,</i>
<i>"What is jealousy?</i>

13
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,019
<i>"What do we do when confronted</i>

14
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,896
<i>"by someone who's better than me?"</i>

15
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,691
<i>And all these things</i>
<i>that were tied up in that film.</i>

16
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:12,572
<i>I mean, I grew up in Minnesota,</i>
<i>in a boring suburban town.</i>

17
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,451
<i>I realized that all the films</i>
<i>that I worked on, about monsters,</i>

18
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,913
<i>about an old man who flies his house</i>
<i>to South America,</i>

19
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,792
<i>a little girl who moves to San Francisco,</i>

20
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,419
these are all very personal stories.

21
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,588
They've come from my own life experience.

22
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,715
<i>And so we thought,</i>

23
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,302
<i>"How can we allow some new ideas into this</i>

24
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:38,181
<i>"and take the chance with people</i>
<i>that we just have an intuition, like,</i>

25
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,974
"'There's something about that person.

26
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,185
'They would have
something interesting to say.'"

27
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,191
LINDSEY COLLINS:
<i>The SparkShorts program is relatively new.</i>

28
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,569
<i>We wanted to give different storytellers</i>

29
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,447
a shot in a very short
amount of time that tells us,

30
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,033
"Who are they? What stories do they tell?"

31
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,619
The history of shorts at Pixar
is a pretty interesting one

32
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,747
because Pixar kind of sprung from shorts

33
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,376
and specifically,
a short called <i>Andre and Wally B,</i>

34
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,380
<i>which is really</i>
<i>the first animated CG piece.</i>

35
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:16,261
<i>Shorts became something</i>
<i>that was in the DNA of the company.</i>

36
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,390
<i>We would make them</i>
<i>to try new technological ideas</i>

37
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,600
<i>as computer graphics was evolving,</i>

38
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,978
<i>all this even before</i> Toy Story <i>was made.</i>

39
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,732
Ha!

40
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:34,112
COLLINS:<i> Part of the initial thinking</i>
<i>behind the short film projects,</i>

41
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,780
<i>it was a lot about risk-taking.</i>

42
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,825
<i>There was a bit of,</i>

43
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,911
<i>"We don't have much to lose,</i>
<i>'cause nobody knows who we are,"</i>

44
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,206
and so we can take some risks
and gamble a lot.

45
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:49,878
<i>So we were like, "What if we did</i>
<i>something that was much lower budget</i>

46
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,671
<i>"than our traditional short films?"</i>

47
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,884
<i>We let the filmmaker tell</i>
<i>whatever story they wanted to tell</i>

48
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,720
<i>and we give the person</i>
<i>six months to do it.</i>

49
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,931
<i>We started the SparkShorts program</i>

50
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:06,269
really because we didn't know
what kind of talents we were skipping over

51
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,688
by not giving people
a chance to tell their story.

52
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:13,359
<i>We want an unfiltered view</i>
<i>of what these storytellers are bringing,</i>

53
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,320
<i>and we don't want to get in the way.</i>

54
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,866
COLLINS:<i> The only way we'll evolve</i>
<i>the types of stories at the feature level</i>

55
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,411
<i>is if we're engaging that next generation.</i>

56
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,331
<i>We can't wait 20 years</i>
<i>to engage that generation.</i>

57
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,208
<i>We have to be engaging them now.</i>

58
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,147
<i>My name is Aphton Corbin.</i>

59
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,401
<i>I'm a story artist here</i>
<i>at Pixar Animation Studios.</i>

60
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:01,115
<i>I just always was really drawn</i>
<i>to writing and sharing stories.</i>

61
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,703
As a kid, I would do little drawing books
and staple them together

62
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,914
and make out a whole little scenario

63
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,500
<i>and give them to people</i>
<i>as a birthday gift.</i>

64
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,796
<i>And when I was younger,</i>
<i>I would direct playtime with my sister.</i>

65
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,966
I'd be like, "The character
wouldn't say it that way.

66
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,801
"We need to do it again this way."

67
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:25,431
<i>Ever since I got hired here at Pixar,</i>
<i>I knew I wanted to be a director.</i>

68
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,143
I guess it's a big statement,
"I wanna be a director."

69
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,313
<i>I didn't know how long it was gonna take,</i>

70
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,983
<i>but I knew I wanted</i>
<i>to eventually direct something.</i>

71
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:40,238
Aphton made such an impression on
the studio from the minute she got here.

72
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,408
<i>She just got this reputation very quickly</i>

73
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:47,996
<i>as somebody who had something</i>
<i>to say that everybody wanted to hear,</i>

74
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,706
<i>no matter what room she was in.</i>

75
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,500
I got to work with Aphton on <i>Soul.</i>

76
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:58,214
<i>She came up with the way we visualize</i>
<i>the counselors in the</i> Soul <i>universe.</i>

77
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:05,179
<i>She's just a very talented story artist</i>
<i>with these quirky ideas that you're like,</i>

78
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,766
<i>"Where did that come from?</i>
<i>That's just brilliantly bizarre."</i>

79
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:23,614
<i>My name's Louis Gonzales and</i>
<i>I've been at Pixar almost 20 years now.</i>

80
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,201
From the moment
I've gotten into animation,

81
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,163
<i>I've always felt like</i>
<i>I've been challenged constantly.</i>

82
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,250
<i>I was always excited to take</i>
<i>on all kinds of work at Pixar</i>

83
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,669
because it was an experience
rather than just a job.

84
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:41,174
<i>Over time, I've been very lucky</i>
<i>to be a part of some very special films</i>

85
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,051
that a lot of people love,

86
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,178
and I had my small little part in it.

87
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:50,475
<i>But now, almost 20 years later,</i>
<i>I was like, "What else do I need?</i>

88
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,519
<i>"Where's my career going?"</i>
<i>Like, "What am I doing?</i>

89
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,607
"Maybe making stuff as a director
isn't what's gonna happen for me."

90
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,571
MORRIS:<i> Louis has been around</i>
<i>for a long, long time.</i>

91
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,533
<i>He's a statured story artist</i>

92
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,079
<i>and fantastic creative mind.</i>

93
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,875
DOCTER:<i> Louis worked on films</i>
<i>with Brad Bird, like</i> The Incredibles.

94
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,796
<i>He's brought</i>
<i>a really unique point of view.</i>

95
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,925
<i>And he's brought these</i>
<i>really amazing characters to life.</i>

96
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,096
COLLINS:<i> I think</i>
<i>he's a great idea generator.</i>

97
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,515
<i>So, you're always curious of,</i>

98
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,352
"What is this guy gonna do
when he's given the opportunity?

99
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,978
"What story is he gonna tell?"

100
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:49,283
CORBIN:<i> A good year or so into working</i>
<i>on my first film,</i> Toy Story 4,

101
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:54,414
my focus was only about, "How do
I do this job of storyboarding well?"

102
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,625
<i>One day, I got an email saying, like,</i>

103
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,043
<i>"We just wanted you to know that</i>

104
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,380
<i>"your name got brought up</i>
<i>for directing a SparkShort."</i>

105
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,720
GONZALES:<i> A little while back,</i>
<i>Lindsey and Jim reached out to me.</i>

106
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,515
<i>I thought they were gonna tell me</i>
<i>I'm fired, really.</i>

107
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,351
<i>But they were like,</i>
<i>"So, what do you wanna do next?"</i>

108
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,229
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"I have the option to even say that?"</i>

109
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,897
Like, it was not even...

110
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,900
It didn't dawn on me that
I had a choice in my future.

111
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,655
<i>Then they floated it out to me, like,</i>
<i>"What do you think about a SparkShort?"</i>

112
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,954
MORRIS:<i> One of the great things</i>
<i>about the SparkShorts is</i>

113
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,457
<i>it puts you in a place</i>
<i>of enormous vulnerability.</i>

114
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,085
You kind of have nowhere to hide,
like, "You're the show,"

115
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,338
and the pressure of that is significant,
weighing on you,

116
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,883
and trying to figure out,
"How do you show up in that?

117
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,386
<i>"And how do you let your guard down enough</i>
<i>to let others contribute?"</i>

118
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,598
COLLINS:<i> When we start</i>
<i>to walk directors through</i>

119
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,475
<i>what the rules are to do a SparkShort,</i>

120
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:59,103
<i>we tell them,</i>
<i>"It needs to be a narrative story...</i>

121
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,439
(BLOWS)

122
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:06,277
<i>"It can be CG, it can be 2D,</i>

123
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,113
<i>"and it needs to be for all audiences."</i>

124
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,451
<i>We try to get it done in about six months.</i>

125
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:19,081
But beyond that,
there really aren't any rules.

126
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:24,420
WOMAN: So, we've selected our 2020
SparkShort directors and they are...

127
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,465
-Louis Gonzales...
-(ALL CHEERING)

128
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,676
GONZALES: <i>When they announced us</i>
<i>in the company meeting,</i>

129
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,138
<i>I didn't expect that kind of</i>
<i>outpouring of love.</i>

130
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,767
<i>It just felt, "Oh, my God,</i>
<i>the people here at this company</i>

131
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,769
<i>"are rooting for us to succeed."</i>

132
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,729
<i>"They want to see us tell stories."</i>

133
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,149
<i>That, to me, was amazing, truly.</i>

134
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,986
And it also added, like, pressure.
(LAUGHS)

135
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,782
<i>When people support you like that,</i>

136
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,076
<i>it's like,</i>
<i>"I don't wanna let anyone down."</i>

137
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,705
<i>Because when I was initially asked,</i>
<i>"What do you think about a SparkShort?"</i>

138
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,500
I said, "You know,
probably not, I'll think about it."

139
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,503
<i>But eventually I realized that</i>

140
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:09,090
<i>I was just genuinely</i>
<i>afraid that I would suck</i>

141
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:12,927
and smash face-first into the wall,
teeth everywhere.

142
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,263
<i>I was afraid of failure.</i>

143
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:19,308
<i>And once I realized that</i>
<i>I was afraid to fail in this regard,</i>

144
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,979
in a creative regard, in the thing that
I pride myself on as a story artist,

145
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,733
I was like, "I need to run head-first
at this wall 'cause I'll break through."

146
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,280
CORBIN:<i> It was kind of crazy</i>
<i>when they announced us on that day.</i>

147
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,742
<i>I was still really insecure</i>
<i>about being chosen.</i>

148
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,788
<i>I knew the fear of it happening too soon,</i>

149
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:45,167
<i>also I was a little uncertain</i>
<i>of how I was gonna lead a team.</i>

150
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,004
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"What are people gonna think?</i>

151
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,966
"Are they gonna be like, 'Aphton?
She hasn't even been here that long.

152
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,509
"'What is she even gonna make?'"

153
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,179
<i>And then Louis is, like,</i>
<i>such an amazing story artist,</i>

154
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,016
<i>and he's worked on a bunch of movies</i>
<i>that I grew up watching,</i>

155
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:05,271
it's like, "We're going at the same time?
That's cool. No pressure there."

156
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,446
DOCTER:<i> Lots of times people are curious,</i>
<i>"How do we make films?"</i>

157
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,033
The answer is, "There's no one way."
Every film is different.

158
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,995
<i>They all, of course, start from an idea,</i>

159
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:24,373
<i>but from there, it might be that</i>
<i>you try to write it up as a script</i>

160
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,499
<i>or an outline.</i>

161
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:30,046
It might be that the artist sits
and draws the idea, as a storyboard,

162
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,091
even just single images
that are enough to convey the concept.

163
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,722
CORBIN:<i> After being surprised</i>
<i>and freaking out,</i>

164
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,225
<i>I was coming up with ideas for my short.</i>

165
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,728
<i>For a minute, I was like,</i>

166
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,315
<i>"Maybe I should do something scary,</i>
<i>a horror-related thing."</i>

167
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,653
<i>And there's very few</i>
<i>animated horror shorts.</i>

168
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,490
<i>So, I was like,</i>
<i>"Now, this will be fun and edgy."</i>

169
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,952
<i>But I was like,</i>
<i>"It's hard enough to make a film.</i>

170
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,788
<i>"I don't think I need to challenge myself</i>

171
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:08,000
<i>"with an entirely different genre</i>
<i>that I haven't dabbled in quite yet."</i>

172
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,088
<i>I always knew it was gonna be</i>

173
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,841
<i>a story about becoming an adult</i>
<i>and how awkward it is.</i>

174
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,012
For me, I guess, as a 20-something,

175
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:24,517
the feeling of, "I'm not doing it right
at all" is so prevalent sometimes.

176
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,145
<i>I had made a comic about it forever ago.</i>

177
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:33,484
<i>Sometimes, when you're 26,</i>
<i>you feel like an adult,</i>

178
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,571
<i>and sometimes you feel like</i>
<i>two kids stacked in a trench coat.</i>

179
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,200
<i>But that's just a one-line comic,</i>

180
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,078
<i>how do I make that</i>
<i>into a full fleshed-out story?</i>

181
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,914
<i>I thought about that feeling of,</i>

182
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:52,086
<i>"Okay, today everyone sees me</i>
<i>as a little kid with thick shoulder pads</i>

183
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,672
<i>"and I'm not living up</i>
<i>to my adult potential."</i>

184
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,801
<i>Or the moment at work</i>
<i>where I snap at someone</i>

185
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,887
<i>and I was like, "I could've said that</i>
<i>so much more eloquently,"</i>

186
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,141
<i>and instead I just went back</i>
<i>to that teenage part of myself.</i>

187
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,018
Those little sparks
kept popping up in my head.

188
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,063
<i>"I think there's a story here."</i>

189
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,864

GONZALES: <i>I love having parameters.</i>

191
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,786
<i>When you have a short window of time,</i>

192
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,247
<i>you have minimal amount of people,</i>

193
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,501
there's a real strategy
to how you approach every Spark.

194
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,255
<i>The safest thing I could've done</i>
<i>is went for a big concept.</i>

195
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,217
<i>Like, the parents drink the potion</i>
<i>and they become stuffed animals,</i>

196
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,763
<i>and in the end, they'd learn how</i>
<i>to be better parents to their kids.</i>

197
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,808
"Wow, animating teddy bears.
Love it. Cute."

198
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,644
<i>But I wanted to go somewhere deeper.</i>

199
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,231
<i>I knew I wanted to do a story</i>
<i>with a grandmother.</i>

200
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,692
<i>Like, grandmothers that I grew up with.</i>

201
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,904
<i>There was a grit and a toughness,</i>
<i>but a lot of love.</i>

202
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,824
<i>They'd give you the shirt off their back,</i>
<i>do anything for you,</i>

203
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,827
<i>but they don't look like they're</i>
<i>completely approachable. </i>(CHUCKLES)

204
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,582
<i>So, I started circling around</i>
<i>this idea of generational divide.</i>

205
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,669
<i>For me, it was really important</i>
<i>to pull from my people.</i>

206
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,590
I want my family and friends
to be representative of the world,

207
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,509
of how the world moves and breathes.

208
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,553
Which is gonna be different than,
you know, you or anybody else, right?

209
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,514
Our worlds are different.

210
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,684
<i>I remember my grandma Pearl,</i>
<i>who passed, had a lot of attitude.</i>

211
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,480
<i>And my daughter wasn't old enough</i>
<i>to really have</i>

212
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,940
<i>a relationship with my grandma.</i>

213
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,984
<i>But my daughter,</i>
<i>when she was young, also had attitude.</i>

214
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,530
<i>Oh, I would've loved to have seen what,</i>
<i>together, they would've been like.</i>

215
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:47,618
<i>I love the juxtaposition of the complete</i>
<i>innocent with the experienced.</i>

216
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,413
<i>But characters that are vulnerable</i>
<i>in a real way</i>

217
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,958
have to come from the artist
in a real way.

218
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,543
The artist has to be vulnerable.

219
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,547
<i>And this is the hard thing for me to do.</i>

220
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,383
<i>There was a hundred questions that come up</i>

221
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:07,513
<i>to try and corral this big,</i>
<i>nebulous idea that seems simple,</i>

222
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,682
<i>so I needed that true north.</i>

223
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,269
<i>I needed something that gave me</i>
<i>a sense of, "It could be done."</i>

224
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,314
<i>And that's when I went to London</i>
<i>to go visit a friend of mine,</i>

225
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,401
<i>and they took me to a play,</i>
Death of a Salesman.

226
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,947
This life and time of this husband,
and his relationship with his family.

227
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,367
<i>It's that simple, but it's that clear.</i>

228
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:33,163
<i>And I thought, "Oh, my God,</i>
<i>if my short could even scratch the surface</i>

229
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:37,042
<i>"of what the actors in that play are doing</i>
<i>and have that kind of impact?</i>

230
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,919
<i>"Man, this is where I wanna go."</i>

231
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,839
The brochure, I have it on my board

232
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,300
<i>to remind me that</i>
<i>this is about characters.</i>

233
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,429
<i>"What can I do with a grandmother</i>
<i>and a granddaughter</i>

234
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,973
<i>"and the grandma's old dog</i>
<i>in an apartment?"</i>

235
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,643
<i>I can just wring every drop of personality</i>
<i>out of these three,</i>

236
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,271
'cause it's basically a stage play.

237
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,321
CORBIN:<i> It's interesting when people say,</i>

238
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,032
<i>"I was never good at drawing,</i>
<i>so I didn't draw."</i>

239
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,744
<i>I don't think I necessarily knew</i>
<i>that I was good or not.</i>

240
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,203
It's something I had to do.

241
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,458
<i>It was like my own way of therapy almost.</i>

242
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,793
<i>If I'm frustrated,</i>
<i>I'm like, "I gotta go draw,"</i>

243
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,087
<i>or "I'm happy,</i>
<i>I'm gonna sit down and draw."</i>

244
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,507
<i>But I remember, growing up,</i>

245
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,761
<i>there wasn't a lot of content</i>
<i>with Black little girls.</i>

246
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,015
<i>The two Disney princesses that</i>
<i>me and my sister would dress up as were</i>

247
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,685
Pocahontas and Jasmine
'cause it was like, "They're brown-ish."

248
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,772
<i>So, when I was really young,</i>

249
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:43,233
<i>I would automatically draw</i>
<i>blonde hair, blue eyes,</i>

250
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:47,071
<i>you know, if you don't specify character,</i>
<i>I guess that's what we're doing.</i>

251
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,701
<i>And I was always challenged</i>
<i>by a family member that's like,</i>

252
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,954
<i>"How come you only draw white characters?"</i>

253
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,503
<i>And the frustration of trying</i>
<i>to explain to your family,</i>

254
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,338
<i>"I don't even know why you're asking me.</i>

255
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,798
<i>"You know the answer to this."</i>

256
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,258
<i>"I'm drawing what I see</i>

257
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,303
"and people don't want anything
other than white people,

258
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,014
"'cause if they did, they'd be on TV."

259
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,228
<i>It was hard, incredibly hard</i>
<i>to break past that</i>

260
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,899
and it took a while, a lot of unlearning.

261
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,861
<i>It just took a leap of faith.</i>

262
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,285
<i>I was like, "Yeah, I'm gonna draw</i>
<i>more characters of different ethnicities."</i>

263
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,832
<i>And it felt right, and it felt truthful</i>
<i>because it's what I know.</i>

264
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,919
<i>Then it turned into,</i>
<i>"Unless anyone says otherwise,</i>

265
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,879
<i>"I'm drawing mainly Black characters,</i>

266
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,090
<i>"and then anything else will be a POC,</i>

267
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,136
<i>"and let's just see how long it takes</i>
<i>before a teacher says something."</i>

268
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,514
They didn't, 'cause that would've been

269
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,142
an extremely interesting conversation
to have had.

270
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,353
<i>And then it just became a norm.</i>

271
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,201
<i>When I got to Pixar,</i>
<i>they had seen my work.</i>

272
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,205
<i>So, in my mind, I'm like,</i>

DOCTER:<i> Working on</i> Soul
<i>was kind of a revelation to me</i>

274
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,504
<i>because as a white kid in America,</i>

275
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,675
I saw thousands of characters
that represented my experience.

00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:37,222
<i>Joe Gardner in</i> Soul <i>is our first</i>
<i>African-American lead.</i>

<i>So, trying to see the world</i>
<i>through his perspective,</i>

278
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,645
<i>it took a lot of learning on my part,</i>

279
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,984
<i>and Aphton was a huge contributor</i>
<i>to the storytelling of that.</i>

CORBIN: <i>Just going here and continuing</i>
<i>to challenge that level of diversity</i>

281
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,076
<i>of voices and characters is important.</i>

282
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,286
<i>Asking questions...</i>

283
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,540
<i>"Why is this character white?</i>
<i>Is there any specific reason?"</i>

284
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,044
<i>'Cause sometimes it's not,</i>
<i>a lot of times it's honestly just</i>

285
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,963
somebody drew two dots and a smiley face,

286
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,051
and then it went downstream
and they autofilled a white character,

287
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:17,805
and just, like, challenging that
and having people be more open to, like,

<i>We all have relatable</i>

<i>I am excited about people</i>

<i>through the lens of a Black character.</i>

292
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,533
So, that's what I hope to do
through my film.

293
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,373
<i>The initial story was of a day in the life</i>
<i>of this character, Gia,</i>

294
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,542
<i>on her 21st birthday.</i>

295
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,877
<i>In my head, the idea is,</i>

296
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,089
<i>instead of getting older</i>
<i>and more mature,</i>

297
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,508
<i>more kids are coming into</i>
<i>this trench coat.</i>

298
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,177
So, it should be 21 of them in there.

299
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,849
<i>But I was like, "That's ridiculous.</i>
<i>I'm gonna be lucky if I get a few."</i>

300
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:05,978
<i>And so I was trying to narrow down</i>
<i>what ages were pivotal.</i>

301
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,275
<i>And so it became the One-Year-Old</i>
<i>that encompassed that baby,</i>

302
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,985
<i>just, like, raw emotion.</i>

303
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,990
<i>And then Ten, who in my mind,</i>
<i>she kind of represents that confidence,</i>

304
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,366
<i>"Things are good,"</i>

305
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,286
<i>and just how you think</i>
<i>you know everything at that age.</i>

306
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,998
<i>And Sixteen is, like, smack in</i>
<i>your teenage years, that felt right.</i>

307
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,668
<i>And for me, being 16 is</i>
<i>about being super-emotional</i>

308
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,753
<i>and insecure about everything.</i>

309
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,466

00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,946
<i>from the types of stories that</i>
<i>they're gonna tell, it's innate.</i>

312
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,074
<i>That's something</i>
<i>we all do as storytellers.</i>

313
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,452
<i>We gravitate towards the things</i>
<i>that we grow up around,</i>

314
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,745
<i>the things that we like.</i>

315
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,496
<i>I almost feel like that doesn't go away.</i>

316
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,711
<i>Growing up,</i>
<i>I had a strong group of friends.</i>

317
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,464
<i>They were my crew, you know,</i>
<i>that was a graffiti crew.</i>

318
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,593
<i>I loved them a lot</i>
<i>because it was all about art.</i>

319
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,513
<i>Those crews were made up</i>
<i>of different nationalities,</i>

320
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,226
<i>you know, just different cultures,</i>
<i>and it was us against the world.</i>

321
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,606
<i>I loved how</i>
<i>art was this beacon for sharing.</i>

322
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,984
<i>And it didn't matter who you were,</i>
<i>it was all about the art.</i>

323
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,404
<i>It was just this fun life</i>
<i>of running around LA,</i>

324
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,282
<i>spray paintin' and runnin' from the cops,</i>
<i>and gettin' up on buses,</i>

325
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,410
and jumpin' out of windows in case
the bus driver stopped or whatever.

326
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,204
It was fun 'cause it was mischievous,

327
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,248
but it was also art-related,
and I loved that.

328
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,417
<i>The thing was, is that this was an outlet</i>

329
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,796
<i>to kind of see yourself</i>
<i>bigger than anyone sees you.</i>

330
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,133
<i>You're talkin' about LA</i>
<i>in the '80s and '90s.</i>

331
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,428
<i>It's rife with gang activity</i>
<i>on every other corner.</i>

332
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,306
No one's looking at a brown kid
back then and going,

333
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,392
"My God, you know,
you're going to Harvard."

334
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,352
They're going,
"Oh, God. You're going to jail.

335
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,646
<i>"'Cause look at you,</i>
<i>you're a graffiti artist."</i>

336
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,607
<i>And we're just going,</i>
<i>"Look, we just wanna be seen."</i>

337
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,116
<i>I tried to apply to art colleges,</i>
<i>but my parents, we couldn't afford it.</i>

338
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,786
And I tried to get
some sort of scholarship or somethin',

339
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,080
but I was a terrible student.
I'll be honest.

340
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:33,292
I wasn't as focused on my studies
as I should have been

341
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,002
because I drew all the time.

342
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,545
<i>My parents were awesome.</i>

343
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,380
<i>They were always supportive of me drawing.</i>

344
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,508
<i>But they drove buses for a living.</i>

345
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,136
My parents would be like,
"Totally. Drawing is great.

346
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,387
"We're gonna support you.

347
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,222
"However, think about driving a bus?"

348
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,392
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"I'm not gonna be a bus driver</i>

349
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,270
"'cause that feels like
I'm settlin', Mom."

350
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,148
<i>But the thing is that it always</i>
<i>kind of pushed me into trying</i>

351
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,317
<i>to hustle up drawing for a living.</i>

352
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,236
My spectrum of what it could've been was

353
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,531
doing designs for T-shirts,
storefronts with graffiti,

354
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,533
like, it was like this,
you know, airbrushing.

355
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,411
It was a small thing
that you could maintain a business.

356
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,414
<i>I don't know if you could</i>
<i>support a family with that.</i>

357
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,958
I was looking for the right fit,

358
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,085
and I figured comic books
was gonna be my fit.

359
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,423
<i>I started getting into comic books</i>
<i>in high school.</i>

360
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:26,053
<i>I loved the Brothers Hernandez.</i>
<i>Jaime, Berto and Mario,</i>

361
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,972
<i>and I loved their work</i>
<i>because it was this great mash-up</i>

362
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,975
<i>of these characters that lived</i>
<i>in an area like I did.</i>

363
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,977
<i>They were Latin, mostly.</i>

364
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,938
<i>It was grounded in a world like mine,</i>
<i>but they'd have adventures.</i>

365
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,648
<i>They would go into outer space.</i>

366
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,568
<i>It was like,</i>
<i>"This is fantastic, different."</i>

367
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,489
Comic books made me double down and go,
"I want to tell stories."

368
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,382
My daughter loved costumes
when she was younger.

369
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,133
She had this Tigger costume.

370
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,053
<i>And she loved dancing around,</i>
<i>being Tigger.</i>

371
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,138
<i>She would wear it for days on end.</i>

372
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,142
<i>When I started to explore ideas</i>
<i>of this little girl,</i>

373
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:19,689
<i>I initially started her as a little girl</i>
<i>that dressed up in a cat costume.</i>

374
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,567
<i>I just wanted her to be</i>
<i>a pure little 4-year-old</i>

375
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,070
<i>with the energy</i>
<i>and excitement and imagination</i>

376
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,406
that kids of that age usually have.

377
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,533
<i>Little kids, their emotions are unbounded,</i>

378
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:33,370
so you can have, "I'm happy, I'm sad,
and I'm angry and I'm playful"

379
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,497
all within five or 10 minutes.

380
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,291
I knew I had this tough grandma

381
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,837
who was gonna be visited by
her granddaughter, who is super energetic.

382
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,382
I wanna engage, engage,
engage with my grandma.

383
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,761
<i>And the grandma's like, "Yes, I love you,</i>
<i>but I'm trying to do something right now."</i>

384
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,389
<i>I had to kind of figure out</i>
<i>why she would go to</i>

385
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,933
<i>the lengths to keep</i>
<i>the little girl away from her.</i>

386
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,937
As I was exploring the grandmother,

387
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,900
not baking cookies and not doing
the '80s TV show version of a grandma,

388
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,277
but someone that I know.

389
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,865
<i>So, like, that grit that</i>
<i>I remember in my grandmas,</i>

390
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,117
it was kind of like
trying to pull off of them,

391
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,785
you know, glean pieces of them.

392
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,747
Thinking about it, I was kind of like,
"What if she loved wrestling?"

393
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,584
But that comes with the trappings of,

394
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,502
"Oh, you're Hispanic. Is she Hispanic?

395
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,589
"Oh, <i>luchadores,</i> am I right?
She was a <i>luchador,</i> am I right?"

396
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:30,510
And I'm like, "No.
She loves wrestling like soap operas."

397
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,472
<i>It's no different.</i>
<i>It's just more athletic.</i>

398
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,683
<i>It's the thing that she loves to watch.</i>

399
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,603
<i>So I was like,</i>
<i>"Okay, this is sitting right."</i>

400
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,982
<i>Because it's not some sort of arbitrary</i>
<i>decision that makes her interesting.</i>

401
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,485
<i>It's something that's rooted</i>
<i>in something real.</i>

402
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,654
<i>So I'm like, "Okay, that's what it is."</i>
<i>That's how it started.</i>

403
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,834
CORBIN: I mostly board digitally,

404
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:07,839
but when I'm brainstorming ideas,
I will draw them on paper first sometimes,

405
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,257
more like thumbnails.

406
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:13,845
Just so I can start to try and figure out
these shots that are in my head

407
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:18,308
and they help me visualize
some of the key scenes

408
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,560
I wanna portray in my short.

409
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:27,108
And I'm working on the intro conversation
with Gia and her sister Nicole.

410
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:32,864
<i>The creation of this sister character</i>
<i>is based off of my sister.</i>

411
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,035
<i>My sister is my best friend,</i>
<i>and we're only two years apart,</i>

412
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:41,414
<i>and so it's nice to have someone who</i>
<i>is not too far away from you in age,</i>

413
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,333
<i>who knows what you're going through.</i>

414
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:49,339
<i>The idea of going out with your sister</i>
<i>for your 21st birthday</i>

415
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,342
<i>felt so gettable and so adorable.</i>

416
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,887
<i>I just got really excited</i>
<i>about their relationship.</i>

417
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,476
<i>Then I started thinking about settings.</i>

418
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,646
<i>I initially thought of an office.</i>

419
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:10,068
<i>And it started with talking to friends</i>
<i>by the water cooler</i>

420
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,071
<i>as three characters stacked up</i>
<i>on top of each other.</i>

421
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,243
<i>And then what if some of her friends</i>
<i>take her out to this club,</i>

422
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,662
<i>and that's when she has this meltdown.</i>

423
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,750
<i>But as a person</i>
<i>who doesn't work in a typical office,</i>

424
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,961
<i>it kind of felt untruthful.</i>

425
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,465
<i>And then I was like, "Okay,</i>
<i>what if I cut the entire office part out</i>

426
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,343
<i>"and just have it happen</i>
<i>entirely in the club?"</i>

427
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,723
<i>Being more of a homebody introvert,</i>

428
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,684
<i>there's something so truthful</i>
<i>about going to a place</i>

429
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,854
<i>where you're supposed to be having</i>
<i>a fun time, but you're really not.</i>

430
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,399
<i>It felt right. It was like</i>
<i>one setting, it was concise,</i>

431
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,277
<i>and it really tightened up</i>
<i>the rest of the story.</i>

432
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:02,329
GONZALES: So, the grandma, she's gonna be
in her early 50s, you know?

433
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:05,040
So, not too old where
she's like, "My hip and my stuff."

434
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,375
Your thoughts around hair?
It's complicated.

435
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,627
Well, we're... (CHUCKLES)

436
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,463
MORRIS:<i> The director</i>
<i>is the key storyteller.</i>

437
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,716
<i>And their wing-person is their producer,</i>

438
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,678
they get a lot of stuff thrown at them
that they aren't expecting,

439
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,472
<i>and they have to be thinking of,</i>

440
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,807
<i>"How can I do this better,</i>
<i>faster, cheaper?"</i>

441
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,728
I needed my partner in the short to be
someone who's gonna check me,

442
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,688
because I don't wanna have blind spots.

443
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,274
<i>But I wanted to know who Courtney was.</i>

444
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,777
You've worked in
a ton of departments, right?

445
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,153
How do you like to work?

446
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,946
I think one of the biggest things for me,

447
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,990
to help pull up the pace,
is collaboration.

448
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,326
<i>My name is Courtney Kent.</i>

449
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:44,162
I've been at Pixar
a little over 13 years now.

450
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,789
How many editors do we have?

451
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:46,873
How does that work?

452
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,209
I've got a list of people
that are open to it,

453
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,336
and I think we can sit and talk
to all of them.

454
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,464
Along the way, I got to help
on the development

455
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:58,218
of the very first SparkShort,
<i>Smash and Grab.</i>

456
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,805
<i>And since then, I have been saying,</i>

457
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:06,309
if there's ever an opportunity for
a Spark producer, I would love to do it.

458
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,772
<i>Louis and I got partnered together,</i>
<i>not knowing each other,</i>

459
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,775
<i>which was intimidating</i>
<i>and exciting at the same time.</i>

460
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,944
<i>It feels a little bit</i>
<i>like a blind marriage.</i>

461
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,696
<i>I was very nervous.</i>

462
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,240
<i>I think I felt like I had a lot to prove.</i>

463
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,118
I think, having never been a producer
before, you go into it, like,

464
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,911
<i>"I don't know what I'm doing."</i>

465
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,289
<i>But as soon as we started</i>
<i>talking about the story</i>

466
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,333
<i>being really focused on family,</i>

467
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,669
<i>and I have a young daughter,</i>

468
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,881
<i>we were able to find some fast connections</i>

469
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,592
<i>that gave us some great momentum</i>
<i>going forward.</i>

470
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,848
COLLINS:<i> The producer is very much</i>
<i>the partner for the director,</i>

471
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,517
but also the kind of leader of the crew.

472
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,729
<i>So, we'd ask that producers on SparkShorts</i>

473
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,314
<i>find people that they trust</i>

474
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:58,153
<i>and use them to get the director's vision</i>
<i>up on the screen.</i>

475
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,867
CORBIN:<i> I think I was told, "You have</i>
<i>a producer now and he is Erik."</i>

476
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:09,789
<i>I didn't really know him,</i>
<i>and my initial reaction was like,</i>

477
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,708
<i>"I can handle it myself."</i>

478
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,711
I just didn't know what
that relationship even meant.

479
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:18,882
<i>And then I started to get</i>
<i>what our dynamic was going to be.</i>

480
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,884
<i>My name is Erik Langley.</i>

481
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:24,220
<i>I've been with Pixar since 2004.</i>

482
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,805
That's about 16 years now.

483
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,684
<i>And it's my first time</i>
<i>producing a SparkShort.</i>

484
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:36,107
<i>From the beginning, Aphton knew what</i>
<i>the story was that she wanted to tell,</i>

485
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,693
and there's nothing better
that a crew can have

486
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,945
than a director that knows
what he or she wants.

487
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:46,826
<i>The biggest crew that we're gonna have</i>
<i>on a film is gonna be the animation crew.</i>

488
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,121
I feel like I could see animators
asking about, like,

489
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,956
"What's going on in that coat?" And like,

490
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,083
"Do you have any vision of how,
you know...

491
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,919
"How often are we gonna cut in..."

492
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,713
<i>We wanted to pitch to animation</i>
<i>so they could have some context,</i>

493
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,217
see what the story was gonna be,
the characters were gonna be, the style...

494
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,260
-That's all you guys.
-Stuff like this. Yeah.

495
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,262
-You can decide. Get 'em all excited.
-Exactly.

496
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:10,183
CORBIN:<i> Sometimes the animators</i>
<i>have an option on what show to go on,</i>

497
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,894
<i>and so you want to convince them</i>
<i>that your idea is</i>

498
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,730
<i>really exciting, and that</i>
<i>they'll have a fun time on it.</i>

499
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,111
GONZALES: <i>All 70 animators were</i>
<i>in this one screening room,</i>

500
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:26,783
<i>and animators have the reputation</i>
<i>of being kind of hard.</i>

501
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,035
Like, "Here we are now,
entertain us" kind of vibe.

502
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:33,915
<i>This was my first big pitch</i>
<i>to a group that size.</i>

503
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,167
<i>It's scary, it's nerve-racking,</i>
<i>it's a big deal.</i>

504
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,336
<i>'Cause how your movie</i>
<i>lives and breathes</i>

505
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:42,006
<i>is gonna be that relationship</i>
<i>between you and the animators.</i>

506
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,843
LANGLEY: <i>Anytime you have to get up</i>
<i>in front of a hundred-plus people</i>

507
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,427
and do a little presentation,

508
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,180
you're always gonna be,
I guess, a little bit anxious.

509
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,310
All right, hello, animation.

510
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:58,857
Thanks for having us, letting us crash
your meeting. So, I'm Erik, I'm producing.

511
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,360
I'm Aphton and I'm directing.
So I hit this to get going?

512
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,444
-Yes.
-Aha!

513
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,447
The working title we're going
with right now is <i>Twenty Something.</i>

514
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:10,493
<i>I was like, "Okay, I hope I just remember</i>
<i>everything I had planned to say."</i>

515
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,579
This is every time I go out, by the way,

516
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,582
and being overwhelmed by all these people
who've got it together.

517
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,375
I mean, just those moments in the office

518
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,669
where you feel like
you didn't say the right thing.

519
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,921
<i>I had some embarrassing pictures</i>
<i>of me as a kid.</i>

520
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,298
<i>I was like, "They'll like that."</i>

521
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,632
(CROWD CLAPPING, LAUGHING)

522
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,467
<i>"I'll hate it, they'll love it."</i>

523
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,054
Note the mesh-fingerless gloves.

524
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,890
-(CROWD LAUGHING)
-We'll just move on.

525
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,310
GONZALES:<i> I think Aphton has</i>
<i>a really interesting concept.</i>

526
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:39,022
She was funny, she had her characters
and stuff like that. It was a good pitch.

527
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,273
Please.

528
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,818
But it was that time in the process
where I knew my characters

529
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,279
and I knew my setting,
but I didn't know my story.

530
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,823
"What would best represent me in a story?"

531
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,076
And I thought,
"About a 50-year-old grandmother

532
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,536
-"with her granddaughter."
-(CHUCKLES)

533
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:57,123
<i>And I'm just going, like, "Man, no one's</i>
<i>gonna wanna work on this short."</i>

534
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,625
<i>Because it doesn't sound exciting.</i>

535
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:04,005
<i>So, I figured I need to go into this</i>
<i>and present myself.</i>

536
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:09,510
-Here it is. Come on! Come on! Yeah.
-Yes, she loves wrestling.

537
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,847
GONZALES: <i>I wanna make sure I emphasize</i>
<i>who I am and how I go about stuff.</i>

538
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,141
Little girl's dropping elbows and leg.

539
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,726
<i>Get someone excited to work on this.</i>

540
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,687
Grandma's pullin' her down,
swinging around, upside down.

541
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,231
Really stuff that we shouldn't
be doing with little kids,

542
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,025
Grandma's probably gonna be doing.

543
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,777
All right. Thank you!

544
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,821
KENT:<i> There was a great reception.</i>
<i>People seemed pretty excited.</i>

545
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,491
We both had animators after come up

546
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,661
<i>and talk about how fun</i>
<i>they thought the story was.</i>

547
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,621
-GONZALES: Daniel.
-Good job.

548
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,665
GONZALES: Hey, right on, bro.

549
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,749
LANGLEY: Nice job, guys.

550
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,334
GONZALES: Hey, same with you guys, man.

551
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,753
LANGLEY: <i>After we pitched,</i>
<i>it got a good response.</i>

552
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,089
People were excited,
they wanted to be a part of it.

553
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,764
GONZALES: <i>My whole career has been gettin'</i>
<i>thrown into the deep end of the ocean</i>

554
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,891
<i>and havin' to make my way back to shore.</i>

555
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,812
I didn't go to art school,
and I don't have

556
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,397
this "get in, fit in" mentality

557
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,857
that you kind of develop
when you go through schools

558
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,651
and you grow up a certain kind of a way.

559
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:12,699
<i>It was very much about trying to see</i>
<i>how I can figure stuff out.</i>

560
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,787
<i>Early on, when I was hanging out</i>
<i>at the back of this comic book store</i>

561
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,666
<i>with a few other friends of mine,</i>
<i>I met this guy, Johan,</i>

562
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,710
<i>and he has mentorship, and he's like,</i>

563
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,421
"Do you ever think about animation?"

564
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,008
And I said, "You mean, like, watch it?"
And he's like, "No, working."

565
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,592
"I don't know if I can do it."

566
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,845
He was like,
"We'll put a portfolio together

567
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,263
and get you a job in animation."

568
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,224
I was like, "I got nothin' to lose
and I wanna draw for a living."

569
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,727
<i>I hunkered down</i>
<i>and woke up at 7:00 in the morning.</i>

570
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,896
<i>I was on my little desk</i>
<i>next to my bed doing these tests</i>

571
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,607
<i>and doing these drawings</i>
<i>every day for about eight months.</i>

572
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,193
<i>You know, puttin' together this portfolio.</i>

573
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,157
<i>Going out into the zoo and drawing.</i>

574
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,286
<i>And going to museums.</i>

575
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,496
<i>Wherever I can figure out</i>
<i>how to scoot my way in</i>

576
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,123
<i>to get some free gesture drawing.</i>

577
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:07,045
When it was all said and done, I had
a portfolio. I was like, "Whoa!"

578
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,800
<i>I applied to several studios.</i>

579
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,969
Some of them were like,
"Thanks, but no, thanks."

580
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,888
But Warner Bros. Feature,
they were like,

581
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,098
<i>"Yes, we want you</i>
<i>to come here as a trainee."</i>

582
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,059
And I was like, "Well, does it pay?"
(LAUGHS)

583
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,481
<i>Warner Bros. Feature Animation</i>
<i>was my art school.</i>

584
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,942
It was where I cut my teeth,
got a lot of opportunity on <i>Iron Giant.</i>

585
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,819
<i>Because there was always learning.</i>

586
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,863
<i>Working on</i> Iron Giant

587
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,699
<i>was one of the best experiences</i>
<i>I ever had in my career.</i>

588
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:41,454
<i>Brad Bird was this geyser of energy,</i>

589
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,123
<i>and he was a force</i>
<i>that was just moving this along.</i>

590
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:48,086
<i>And everyone was just holding on</i>
<i>for dear life to try and stay with him.</i>

591
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:51,547
<i>Brad and the crew</i>
<i>gave me a chance to prove myself.</i>

592
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,926
<i>It wasn't a judgment. It was like,</i>

593
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,844
"Here's the work,
you keep doing good work,

594
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,304
"I'm gonna keep giving you work."

595
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,056
And I'm like, "Please, give me more."

596
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,517
'Cause the last thing I wanna do
is not be in animation

597
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,560
'cause I love it.
If it wasn't for <i>Iron Giant,</i>

598
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:08,147
I wouldn't have worked with Brad, right?
And I wouldn't be up at Pixar.

599
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,444
<i>Pixar was really weird for me</i>
<i>when I first started.</i>

600
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:20,118
<i>Because when I came in, everyone</i>
<i>was so nice that I was kind of like,</i>

601
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,788
"You guys are all fake. And I..."
You know, "And I'm on to you."

602
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:31,337
<i>People here were into making great stuff,</i>
<i>and I loved that.</i>

603
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,799
<i>But, you know, when you walk</i>
<i>into an animation studio,</i>

604
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,385
it's, like, action figures
are all up on their desks,

605
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,471
and all kinds of fun stuff.
And I was like, "Yo, that's so not me.

606
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:44,559
<i>"I'm not that kind of guy."</i>
<i>It just felt like a different world.</i>

607
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:51,315
<i>And so it just started this long process,</i>
<i>for me, of trying to figure out how I fit.</i>

608
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:56,195
<i>On top of that, I would work, like,</i>
<i>14-hour days, six days a week, at least.</i>

609
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,907
<i>And when you have kids,</i>
<i>you have a responsibility.</i>

610
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,618
<i>Family is everything to me.</i>

611
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,793
<i>And trying to find a balance there is,</i>
<i>you know, it was difficult.</i>

612
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,923
<i>Either, do I choose my career,</i>
<i>or do I choose my kids?</i>

613
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,305
<i>That's what makes it hard.</i>

614
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,824
CORBIN:<i> When I had the idea of having</i>

615
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,869
<i>three kids stacked on top of each other</i>
<i>in a trench coat,</i>

616
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,622
<i>I was like, "I'm gonna have to sell this</i>

617
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,457
<i>"as an idea that's not gonna be expensive</i>

618
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,584
<i>"and hard to do,</i>
<i>and the best way to do this,</i>

619
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:55,504
<i>"and have it look appealing and gorgeous,</i>
<i>is going to be 2D."</i>

620
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,385
The difference between 2D and 3D animation

621
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:06,349
is that 3D is computer-generated
and can show depth in three dimensions.

622
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,520
<i>And 2D is flat, hand-drawn.</i>

623
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,274
<i>There were two 2D SparkShorts</i>

624
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,319
<i>that were done before,</i> Kitbull <i>and</i> Burrow.

625
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,949
<i>And so I think there was enough</i>
<i>collective knowledge to be, like,</i>

626
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,618
"Why can't we do it 2D?
Let's give it a shot."

627
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,746
CORBIN: I really like this, Rachel.
This is so fast.

628
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,665
-I gave you what I wanted...
-(RACHEL XIN LAUGHING)

629
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,167
...and then you were like,
"Yeah. Here you go, here you go."

630
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,044
RACHEL: This is my job. (LAUGHS)

631
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,128
CORBIN: I know.

632
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,422
<i>I'm working with Rachel,</i>
<i>my character design artist.</i>

633
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,802
<i>I had thought about doing</i>
<i>the character design myself,</i>

634
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:46,889
<i>but I also really wanted to work</i>
<i>on my new job as a director.</i>

635
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,641
And directing someone in art

636
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,602
felt like another important thing
that I needed to learn.

637
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,854
-I'm really liking this one.
-XIN: Ah!

638
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,567
I think we found something fun
with the hair choice.

639
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,820
I think I'm more drawn
to this face shape as well.

640
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:05,324
<i>Figuring out my own voice</i>
<i>as a director became really important</i>

641
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,119

00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,079
-Should we...
-(CHUCKLES) The sticker?

643
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,999
-CORBIN: The director Post-its.
-Yeah. Do you wanna... Yeah. You do it.

644
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,293
-Do you mind if I have my moment?
-Have your moment.

645
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,004
-XIN: This is a really enjoyable moment.
-It is. I like this one!

646
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:21,257
This one. I'm really liking this.
I love this head.

647
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,426
<i>So, I started to go back</i>
<i>and look at those things</i>

648
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,178
<i>that made me "me" and brought me here.</i>

649
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,850
<i>Growing up, I always loved</i>
<i>animation and cartoons.</i>

650
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,020
<i>Especially Disney cartoons.</i>

651
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,858
<i>When I got to high school,</i>
<i>I took an animation class.</i>

652
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:44,405
<i>And I would just sit in my room and try</i>
<i>to draw stuff and staple paper together.</i>

653
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:50,661
Seeing a drawing come to life
grabbed me, and from there,

654
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,830
I learned about different schools
that taught it.

655
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,458
<i>I really gravitated towards CalArts</i>

656
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,502
<i>because it was a school</i>
<i>founded by Walt Disney.</i>

657
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,214
And so I was like,
"I gotta go to this school."

658
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,177
<i>As soon as I graduated,</i>
<i>I applied to CalArts,</i>

659
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:11,849
but I didn't get in. Instead,
I went to a community college.

660
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:17,021
<i>And I wound up working a lot of hours</i>
<i>at McDonald's to earn income for myself.</i>

661
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:20,649
And I was like, "Oh, my goodness!
Am I ever gonna make it into animation?"

662
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,070
<i>But I was still working on my portfolio.</i>

663
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:28,824
<i>And during that year-and-a-half,</i>
<i>I thought a lot about who I was</i>

664
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,534
<i>as an artist.</i>

665
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,830
<i>I was really inspired by Japanese anime.</i>

666
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,290
<i>And so I tried to draw</i>

667
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:40,294
<i>these very delicate anime line drawings</i>
<i>with a mechanical pencil,</i>

668
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,754
and then on the other side,

669
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:45,341
I was trying to do really beautiful,
rough Disney style.

670
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,802
Every once in a while,

671
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,012
I'd kind of just do little
scribbles or something

672
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,348
<i>for myself, a silly comic,</i>

673
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,684
and people would be like,
"We really like that."

674
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,686
I'd be like, "No,
that's not how I wanna draw.

675
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,146
"That's, like, not good." (CHUCKLES)

676
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,234
<i>But people kept reacting to it</i>
<i>and, like, really loving it.</i>

677
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,613
And that's when I started to get more okay
with where I was at.

678
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:12,076
<i>And I put together a portfolio</i>
<i>and I applied to CalArts again.</i>

679
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,622
They really responded to it
and I got into CalArts.

680
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,964
<i>The plan was to get out</i>
<i>as fast as possible</i>

681
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,883
<i>because the tuition was crazy expensive.</i>

682
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,845
And so I was like, "I'm gonna
be there for, like, a year.

683
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,929
"Maybe two years.

684
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:35,766
<i>"And Pixar's just gonna love my stuff,</i>
<i>I'm gonna get swept up,</i>

685
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,854
<i>"and then that'll be that."</i>
<i>But that's not what happened.</i>

686
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,607
<i>And I was, like, just sweating</i>
<i>that entire whole four years thinking,</i>

687
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,735
"How come I'm not getting noticed?"
Like, "What am I doing wrong?"

688
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,612
And, "What do the studios want?"

689
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,115
<i>I really needed to grow some more.</i>

690
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,495
<i>I needed time to actually learn how</i>
<i>to be more of myself in my artwork.</i>

691
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,582
<i>And I needed to find my own voice.</i>

692
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,962
One of my teachers was like, "Get a Tumblr
and start putting art on there."

693
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,464
So I kind of used Tumblr as, like,

694
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,507
"I'm gonna upload
something on here every week,

695
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,093
"and who cares if it's ugly.
It's going on there."

696
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,101
<i>And that's when I started drawing myself</i>

697
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,936
<i>in comics for the first time.</i>

698
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,106
<i>And my experiences growing up</i>
<i>in the Sacramento area</i>

699
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,692
<i>which is majority white.</i>

700
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,153
<i>Living there as a Black family,</i>

701
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:34,158
<i>there was a lot of weird awkwardness</i>
<i>that comes along with that.</i>

702
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:37,870
<i>These comics were really</i>
<i>rough and scribbly.</i>

703
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,124
<i>And I would post them</i>
<i>at the stroke of midnight.</i>

704
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,838
And then go hide in my dorm room,
like, "Oh, my God, what did I just post?

705
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,466
"That was so, like, revealing."

706
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,138
<i>People who'd message me back</i>

707
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,681
<i>or stop me in the hallway</i>

708
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:02,937
<i>and feel the need to share their story</i>
<i>with me was a lot larger than I expected.</i>

709
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,651
<i>And just being like,</i>
<i>"I felt the same way" and "I agree"</i>

710
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,986
<i>and "Here's something</i>
<i>that happened to me,"</i>

711
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,114
<i>and I thought that was something</i>
<i>that was very powerful and unexpected.</i>

712
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:21,121
<i>It just continued to give me courage</i>
<i>to share my own stories in my own way.</i>

713
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:26,293
<i>I just felt like, "Oh, why have I been</i>
<i>wasting my time trying to be</i>

714
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,254
<i>"anything else but myself?"</i>

715
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:34,051
<i>And that's how I actually</i>
<i>was noticed by Pixar.</i>

716
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,555
<i>They reached out to me.</i>
<i>And I was like,</i>

717
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,683
"Of all things that I thought
Pixar would be interested,

718
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,935
"I didn't think it would be
my Black girl comics."

719
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,482
<i>But I was able to tap</i>
<i>into a truthful story</i>

720
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,110
and help people see my point of view,

721
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,445
and that's what Pixar
is really passionate about,

722
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:56,365

<i>I wanna make something that feels honest.</i>

725
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:25,311
<i>The story was gonna be</i>
<i>the granddaughter comes over</i>

726
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,396
<i>and wants to be around the grandmother.</i>

727
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,690
<i>And the grandmother</i>
<i>is trying to do something</i>

<i>that the granddaughter interrupts.</i>

729
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,778
<i>So, how does that play out?</i>

730
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,740
<i>And I wanted the grandma having</i>
<i>some sense of imagination,</i>

731

<i>because we know little kids do.</i>

732
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,661

Yeah, they're alike.

733
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,247
And how we can do that visually
without them saying, like,

00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,291
"Oh, boy." You know, like,
"You like wrestling?

so many movies that have dialogue,

it's kind of like,

<i>you have to make</i>
<i>between the story and the visuals,</i>

776
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,984
And then you put it up in reels
and look at it and you go, like,

777
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,986
"Huh. Not as great as we thought."

778
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:24,156
Reads to me like Joe knows
exactly where he's going,

779
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,824
and he's done this before. (SMACKS LIPS)

780
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,826
So, I feel like we need to adjust it.

781
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,704
And then you try to tear it down
and see what's not working about it

782
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:31,997
and put it together again.

783
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,596
KENT: <i>Louis came from stories,</i>

784
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,849
<i>so he was comfortable drawing</i>
<i>all of the storyboards himself.</i>

785
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,478
<i>And so that's kind of him sitting</i>
<i>and really thinking</i>

786
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,480
<i>about the story that he wants to tell.</i>

787
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:03,111
And creating kind of key moments that
he feels like would help tell the story.

788
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:10,160
<i>So, you have a grandmother sitting down</i>
<i>to watch her wrestling show,</i>

789
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,832
<i>and then the next key moment,</i>
<i>her granddaughter shows up.</i>

790
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,087
<i>They have some conflict.</i>

791
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,550
<i>The TV falls.</i>

792
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:33,225
<i>They kind of wrestle on the floor</i>
<i>and then they hug.</i>

793
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,437
<i>And once he has some</i>
<i>of those things fleshed out,</i>

794
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,691
<i>those drawings would</i>
<i>get sent over to editorial</i>

795
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,360
and they would cut them together
and kind of time them out.

796
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:49,867
I just wanted to throw some boards up
really fast, to see if we had something.

797
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:54,162
<i>Gave it to my editor,</i>
<i>so I can get a sense for the story.</i>

798
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,624
<i>And then problem-solve, in the cut.</i>

799
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:02,588
<i>I was, like, excited to see</i>
<i>what we had,</i>

800
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:09,553
<i>but we watched the cut</i>
<i>and it was terrible.</i>

801
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,813
(CHUCKLING) <i>And my heart sinks.</i>

802
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,484
<i>I had lot of ideas that were kind of,</i>
<i>you know, jockeying for position.</i>

803
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,571
<i>So, the story wasn't clear.</i>

804
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,826
<i>But I could tell, even as bad as it was,</i>

805
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,494
<i>that there was something here.</i>

806
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:40,918
<i>I just needed to find it,</i>
<i>and that's when I kind of went away.</i>

807
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,590
KENT:<i> Louis went radio silent,</i>

808
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:50,302
and when you don't have your director
having a defined vision,

809
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,304
it's very, very challenging.

810
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:58,685
<i>I was like, "Oh, okay.</i>
<i>Are we gonna make this film?"</i>

811
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:04,399
GONZALES: <i>I set my brain</i>
<i>on findin' the story.</i>

812
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,820
<i>So, my brain's trying to figure it out</i>
<i>and it doesn't stop.</i>

813
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,991
<i>I'm waking up at 3:00 in the morning</i>
<i>and sittin' in the dark.</i>

814
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:16,787
<i>You're just mining</i>
<i>your soul for things that,</i>

815
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,039
<i>on a different level, will resonate.</i>

816
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,294
<i>It's the level that none of us see,</i>
<i>but we all feel.</i>

817
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,879
<i>That human truth.</i>

818
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,307
<i>Write that down,</i>

819
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,685

<i>in the morning it's glorious</i>

820
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:44,898
<i>and, like, this solved everything,</i>
<i>to, like, noon, I'm not so sure,</i>

821
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,610
<i>I'm scratching my head,</i>
<i>to, like, right before you go to bed,</i>

822
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:52,739
<i>put your head on the pillow, and</i>
<i>it's like, "Oh, my God. This is terrible.</i>

823
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,283
"That's not gonna work.
What am I gonna do?"

824
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:06,378
<i>Based on the story and where I was at,</i>
<i>it was seismic in terms of</i>

<i>"I'm gonna make the best short ever,"</i>

<i>the biggest fool in the world."</i>

827
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,474
<i>It blew up more and more</i>
<i>each time I wrote it.</i>

828
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:22,352
<i>I was in a super downward spiral.</i>

829
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:26,690
<i>Writing, creating, felt very isolating,</i>
<i>and you feel alone.</i>

830
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,360
<i>It was the darkest period I had.</i>

831
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,865
<i>I was like, "I don't know what to do.</i>
<i>Just give me some more time, Courtney."</i>

832
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:39,745
KENT: <i>The fear of not knowing what's</i>
<i>going on in his mind was really hard,</i>

833
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:43,206
and I thought,
"Do we have a story to tell?"

834
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:52,132
MORRIS: <i>Story is at the heart</i>
<i>of what we do.</i>

835
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,967
<i>And since I've been at Pixar,</i>

836
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:58,388
I've seen the unfaltering
intestinal fortitude to pursue it

837
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,141
until we get it right.

838
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:07,481
<i>It's not like you sit down</i>
<i>and figure the story out all at once.</i>

839
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,650
<i>It takes a long, long, long, long time.</i>

840
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,737
<i>And when we realize</i>
<i>the thing isn't quite working</i>

841
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,989
<i>and we need to tear things down,</i>
<i>change it,</i>

842
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,283
<i>that's just part of the process.</i>

843
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,745
<i>Because if things are going smoothly,</i>

844
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,582
you're probably not trying hard
to do something great.

845

COLLINS: <i>You're just going back</i>
<i>and through something</i>

846
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,215
<i>and trying to perfect something</i>
<i>again and again and again.</i>

847
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,260
<i>On</i> Finding Nemo, <i>for the longest time,</i>

848
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,679
<i>nobody liked Marlin, who's the dad.</i>

849
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,973
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold on, hold on. Wait to cross.

850
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,975
COLLINS: <i>They're like, "He's annoying."</i>

851
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,894
(GRUNTS) You were about
to swim into open water!

852
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,104
No! I wasn't gonna go out!

853
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,313
-It's just a good thing I was here.
-But, Dad...

854
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:51,358
And so we were like,
"Okay, rewrite, rewrite, rewrite."

855
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:54,111
<i>And the initial conceit of that movie</i>

856
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:59,241
<i>was that the traumatic moment</i>
<i>of the barracuda coming in</i>

857
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,910
<i>wasn't at the front of the movie.</i>

858
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:07,415
It was spelled out in flashbacks
throughout the film.

859
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,709
CORAL: We still have to name them.
MARLIN: I haven't forgotten.

860
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,587
CORAL: You know what name
I've always liked? Nemo.

861
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,257
MARLIN: Great! One down.
Only 99 more to go.

862
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,260
COLLINS: <i>The problem was</i>
<i>you had no sympathy for this dad,</i>

863
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,262
<i>because you're like,</i>
<i>"What is his deal?" </i>(CHUCKLES)

864
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,598
<i>And so it was very late in the game,</i>

865
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,686
before it was like, "You guys,
this flashback thing is not working.

866
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,271
"You have to put that story upfront."

867
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:30,939
(GASPS)

868
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,984

Daddy's got you.

872
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:47,164
When you go to tell a story,
there's a lot of reflection.

873
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,375
<i>'Cause I'm really asking myself,</i>

874
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,961
<i>"Why do these characters</i>
<i>in this idea matter,</i>

875
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:56,631
<i>"why is it always present in the back</i>
<i>of my brain? Why do I like this?"</i>

876
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,968
<i>And you have to ask yourself</i>
<i>the hard questions.</i>

877
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,847
"What does this mean to you?
What is it trying to say?

878
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,891
"What are you going through right now?"

879
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:10,645
<i>One of the things that inherently</i>
<i>was a game changer for me</i>

880
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,231
<i>was a moment in the short</i>
<i>when the TV breaks.</i>

881
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,820
<i>The grandma used to always be</i>
<i>super pissed off at the little girl.</i>

882
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:26,203
<i>And I thought, "What a jerk.</i>
<i>Like, who wants to watch that character?"</i>

883
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,165
<i>I realized with that,</i>
<i>it can't just be a character</i>

884
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:34,085
<i>that wants to watch wrestling over</i>
<i>her grandchild. That just makes no sense.</i>

885
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:40,175
<i>And so we had to dig deeper and find out</i>
<i>what wrestling means to her.</i>

886
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,844
<i>Because we needed to know</i>
<i>on an emotional level</i>

887
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,638
<i>why wrestling was the thing that she</i>

888
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,598
<i>was shutting the world out for,</i>
<i>on this day</i>

889
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,476
<i>and why it's an annoyance</i>
<i>when anybody comes over.</i>

890
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:55,982
And the question, to me, was like,
"What's a scary reaction in that moment?"

891
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:59,319
And for me, her being vulnerable

892
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,738
was the most scary thing
that I could put out there.

893
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,240
(SIGHS)

894
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,699
(CRYING)

895
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:08,203
If she just starts to break down
and bawl, you know, just cry,

896
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:11,957
and just, you know,
be genuinely upset by this

897
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,708
interruption with her routine...

898
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,213
<i>That was a really big moment for me</i>

899
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:21,383
<i>because it was like,</i>
<i>everything in my gut tells me it's right,</i>

900
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:25,095
<i>but I'm hesitant because</i>
<i>I don't want her to seem weak.</i>

901
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,057
I was like, "Okay, we have to do it,"

902
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,851
'cause it's about being vulnerable
with the characters.

903
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,813
<i>And I don't see how you can tell</i>
<i>a story if there isn't an aspect</i>

904
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,524
<i>of vulnerability from yourself as well.</i>

905
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:42,529
Nona needed to have a reason
why this was special

906
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:46,783
and I had flirted with the idea
of a deceased husband.

907
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:52,247
<i>Like, "Maybe wrestling is something</i>
<i>that she celebrated with her husband."</i>

908
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,457
<i>But he's passed away,</i>

909
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,460
<i>and so now we're starting</i>
<i>to lean into, like,</i>

910
00:54:57,585 --> 00:55:01,548
<i>this was her taking a day</i>
<i>to celebrate the love of her life.</i>

911
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:06,303
Now we're digging a little bit further
to find what this meant.

912
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,681
<i>And so once I brought the husband in,</i>

913
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:13,601
<i>we now understand that</i>
<i>this is about him and her.</i>

914
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,521
<i>And now there is an emotional weight to it</i>

915
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:19,274
<i>that it didn't have</i>
<i>when it was just wrestling.</i>

<i>what's different between</i>

1089
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,424
<i>an animation director</i>
<i>and a live-action director,</i>

1090
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,760
I've often thought
that a great live-action director

1091
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,471
has a script and then
they bring their actors on the set,

1092
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,807
just kind of working like a jazz musician.

<i>and making it fit and improvise.</i>

1095
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:08,946
And by contrast, an animation director
is more like a classical composer

1096
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,033
who is going
and painstakingly writing that score

1097

<i>from a 16th note to an eighth note,</i>

1101

1147
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,023
I have a question about Ten's audio.

1148
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:52,068
Like, do you feel... It's definitely
not reading as a 10-year-old.

1149
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,152
Right.

<i>We didn't have any kids</i>
<i>to do a scratch recording,</i>

1151
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:59,533
<i>and so selling the idea</i>
<i>of Ten being 10 was kind of hard.</i>

1152
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,243
I was thinking that too.

1153
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:04,789

be nitpicky about because it is scratch.

1154
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:08,334
But it would be nice
if it sounded a little bit off.

The white stucco walls
so you have that texture,

1185
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:35,087
so we don't have to have flat walls.

1186
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,174

1242
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,149
So, my animation supervisor, Lucas,

1243
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:45,361
would ask me
if I was willing to modify some things,

1244
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,530
<i>like extra earrings and bags,</i>

1245
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,700
<i>things that the animators would</i>
<i>have to account for over and over,</i>

1246
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:55,704
<i>that could end up being very</i>
<i>challenging over a large course of time.</i>

1247
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,374
<i>But one of the things</i>
<i>I really wanted to keep</i>

1248
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:02,044
<i>was the different hair</i>
<i>that the characters had.</i>

1249
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:05,130
<i>It's a huge thing in Black culture.</i>

1250
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:07,591
<i>There's a lot</i>
<i>of different, unique hairstyles.</i>

1251
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:11,220
<i>And I feel like it's a very good</i>
<i>indicator of how old you are.</i>

1252
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:12,846
<i>It's like the difference between</i>

1253
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,182
<i>your mother doing</i>
<i>your hair for you as a child</i>

1254
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:17,726
<i>and then you getting it done at a salon.</i>

1255
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:21,772
<i>I was like, I know that some of these</i>
<i>braids and hairstyles are gonna be a lot,</i>

1256
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:25,692
<i>but I think it's a huge</i>
<i>story point for these characters.</i>

1257
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:26,777
TEN: The plan, remember?

1258
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:31,073
CORBIN: <i>We did some things to modify</i>
<i>the hair so it wasn't as challenging.</i>

1259
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,409
Girl, where are you? Gia?

1260
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:35,327
CORBIN: <i>But these animators are amazing,</i>

1261
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:39,039
<i>and I was so excited</i>
<i>because we were so crunched on time...</i>

1262
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,999
I know you are, but what am I?

1263
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,001
CORBIN: <i>...but it looks so good.</i>

1264
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,503
SIXTEEN: You don't know what you're doing.

1265
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:46,088
(WHIMPERING)

1266
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,932
GONZALES: <i>Now, being</i>
<i>in the industry for 20 years,</i>

1267
01:13:57,558 --> 01:14:00,436
<i>for the first time,</i>
<i>I'm really feeling like the older cat.</i>

1268
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:04,815
<i>And there's a lot of youngsters</i>
<i>coming up underneath me that are,</i>

1269
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:07,693
<i>you know,</i>
<i>got great ideas, lot of great energy,</i>

1270
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:10,362
<i>and I'm realizing</i>
<i>that I don't have as much energy.</i>

1271
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,824
<i>But this short is about</i>
<i>how the generations influence each other.</i>

1272
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,786
I always use the example of my dog,
you know, before she passed.

1273
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,079
I had a dog named Pica.

1274
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:23,584
<i>Pica was a smaller Pitbull</i>
<i>and she was about 12.</i>

1275
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:25,002
<i>She had hip issues.</i>

1276
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:27,796
<i>She was old</i>
<i>and she was not wanting to move.</i>

1277
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:32,926
<i>Around the same time,</i>
<i>we got my daughter a Yorkie for Christmas.</i>

1278
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,345
<i>My daughter was happy,</i>

1279
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:37,973
but I actually think
the old dog was happier.

1280
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,934
Because all of a sudden
she was like, "I'm gonna play."

1281
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:45,856
<i>This little puppy brought her</i>
<i>back to life, it gave her a spark.</i>

1282
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:50,110
<i>And that's how I wanted the relationship</i>
<i>of the little girl and the dog to be.</i>

1283
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,947
<i>When I present it</i>
<i>to the team to have this dog,</i>

1284
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:56,617
<i>they'll be in there, like,</i>
<i>"You probably can't have a dog</i>

1285
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:59,912
<i>"and you can't have a dog</i>
<i>with a hoodie, for sure."</i>

1286
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:02,956
KENT: <i>Quadrupeds, things on four legs,</i>

1287
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,043
<i>are notoriously</i>
<i>difficult to do in animation.</i>

1288
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:10,172
<i>And the grandma had to pick up</i>
<i>the dog and move the dog around,</i>

1289
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,716
<i>which is also a very</i>
<i>complicated thing to animate.</i>

1290
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:18,805
At the same time, seeing the image
that Louis drew was so sweet

1291
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:21,934
<i>and made it just</i>
<i>so much more personal to the story</i>

1292
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:25,229
<i>that we wanted to figure out</i>
<i>how to make it happen.</i>

1293
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,274
GONZALES: <i>My team brought so much.</i>

1294
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:33,237
<i>Sculpting the shapes, simming the dog</i>

1295
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,447
<i>with a real legit</i>
<i>terrycloth hoodie and...</i>

1296
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:39,826
<i>touches of the dog on the couch.</i>

1297
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,539
<i>In the end, we got all of it.</i>

1298
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:49,127
<i>And the exciting thing</i>
<i>is I can't wait to show it.</i>

1299
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:51,505
<i>I don't know what it's gonna yield,</i>

1300
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:54,883
<i>but it's done and I'm proud of it,</i>
<i>so let's see what happens.</i>

1301
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:08,230
DOCTER: <i>The first thing I think that</i>
<i>you're looking for when you go to a movie</i>

1302
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:10,315
<i>is to just be entertained.</i>

1303
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,819
But that's sort of surface level,
it's like the candy coating.

1304
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:17,406
<i>Our job as filmmakers is to figure out,</i>

1305
01:16:17,489 --> 01:16:20,117
<i>"What are you giving the audience</i>
<i>to take home?</i>

1306
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:23,203
<i>"What are you giving them</i>
<i>to continue to think about?"</i>

1307
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:26,290
So that that night when they're eating
dinner, they're like, "Huh."

1308
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,294
<i>And I think the only way you can do that</i>

1309
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:34,715
<i>is by having filmmakers who have something</i>
<i>interesting to say in a unique way,</i>

1310
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:40,554
<i>and hopefully in ways, ideas,</i>
<i>concepts that have never been said before.</i>

1311
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:47,394
CORBIN: <i>Overall, I'm super pleased</i>
<i>with the entire film</i>

1312
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:49,771
<i>and extremely proud of it.</i>

1313
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:54,484
<i>And I was very emotional.</i>
<i>Erik and I both were,</i>

1314
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:59,239
<i>just because it felt like</i>
<i>such a crazy road from beginning to end.</i>

1315
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:01,783
<i>I just wanted to tell a story</i>

1316
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:05,662
<i>that I felt like I was going through</i>
<i>and I know everyone else goes through.</i>

1317
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:08,707
<i>No matter what age, race, gender,</i>

1318
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:12,002
<i>this felt like a story</i>
<i>that touched a lot of people,</i>

1319
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:15,589
<i>and then the specificity of it</i>
<i>being told through a Black character,</i>

1320
01:17:15,672 --> 01:17:18,967
<i>I think makes it special</i>
<i>and new and exciting.</i>

1321
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:23,180
LANGLEY: <i>The story is funny, emotional,</i>

1322
01:17:23,263 --> 01:17:26,850
<i>and it's coming from a voice</i>
<i>that has been underrepresented</i>

1323
01:17:26,933 --> 01:17:31,980
and I'm excited for people to see that,
and to see themselves in that,

1324
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,482
<i>because I think we all can.</i>

1325
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,860
CORBIN:<i> I can't wait</i>
<i>for the African-American community,</i>

1326
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:39,488
<i>specifically Black little girls,</i>
<i>to see it.</i>

1327
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,241
<i>There's a huge want for representation,</i>

1328
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,619
<i>and just to be able to watch this</i>
<i>and see yourself</i>

1329
01:17:45,702 --> 01:17:47,829
<i>means a whole lot to a lot of people.</i>

1330
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:51,875
<i>And so I'm really excited</i>
<i>for people to feel seen</i>

1331
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:54,628
and know that this one is, like,
specifically for them.

1332
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:59,841
<i>I'm very excited</i>
<i>for my family to see this film as well.</i>

1333
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:02,803
<i>Especially my sister.</i>

1334
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,930
<i>And when I told her,</i>

1335
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:08,141
<i>"There's a character in here</i>
<i>that I, like, loosely based after you."</i>

1336
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:09,726
Whoo! Let's party!

1337
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:12,062
She's like, "Oh!"
and she's excited about that.

1338
01:18:12,145 --> 01:18:15,691
Okay, okay, back up, back up.
Nothin' to see here. Go on.

1339
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:18,568
-Oh, Gia.
-Just leave me alone.

1340
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:21,071
CORBIN:<i> It's a film about being an adult</i>

1341
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:25,951
<i>and accepting the messiness</i>
<i>that comes along with it.</i>

1342
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,703
NICOLE: Are you in here
crying on the toilet?

1343
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:28,787
No.

1344
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,372
Yes.

1345
01:18:30,997 --> 01:18:34,126
CORBIN:<i> And I wanted to put in this idea</i>
<i>of Nicole being like,</i>

1346
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:37,754
<i>"Nah, you're being super dramatic,</i>
<i>everything's going to be just fine."</i>

1347
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:39,631
All right. Let's do this.

1348
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:42,092
That's my girl. Let's go.

1349
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,760
CORBIN: <i>I think kind of like the short,</i>

1350
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:47,973
<i>I think I'm just learning</i>
<i>more and more to trust myself,</i>

1351
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:51,226
<i>that I am doing things right.</i>
(CHUCKLES) <i>Or close enough.</i>

1352
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:53,645
<i>And that I'm gonna</i>
<i>keep growing and learning</i>

1353
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,898
<i>and that's not a bad thing,</i>
<i>that's all part of the process.</i>

1354
01:18:58,191 --> 01:19:02,612
<i>And I think that just is attributed</i>
<i>to the fact that I did the short,</i>

1355
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:06,283
<i>I've made it, and I survived.</i>

1356
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:12,247
GONZALES: <i>This is my first time</i>
<i>actually really finishing something.</i>

1357
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:15,792
<i>I've never finished a short film,</i>
<i>and I've tried for a long time.</i>

1358
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:20,213
<i>You know, I've tried to figure out a way</i>
<i>to break it up and have a team,</i>

1359
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:22,883
<i>and it wasn't until now</i>
<i>that I could actually do that.</i>

1360
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:27,053
<i>It's important to finish.</i>

1361
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:29,097
<i>'Cause you can't grow unless you finish.</i>

1362
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:33,435
KENT: <i>We are so excited to finally</i>
<i>get to share</i> Nona <i>with the world.</i>

1363
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:37,230
<i>And I'm very excited</i>
<i>for my family to get to see it.</i>

1364
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:41,735
<i>My daughter is also a 5-year-old</i>
<i>little girl just like Renee.</i>

1365
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:43,320
<i>To actually get to sit</i>

1366
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:45,906
and watch the whole thing
with her in the final state

1367
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:49,618
will be also really exciting.
I hope it doesn't give her any bad ideas.

1368
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:53,789
GONZALES: <i>Making the short</i>
<i>has been a real beautiful experience.</i>

1369
01:19:55,832 --> 01:19:57,918
<i>Stories honor life, right?</i>
<i>They honor people</i>

1370
01:19:58,001 --> 01:20:01,171
<i>and when I tell my stories,</i>
<i>I'm honoring my family and friends.</i>

1371
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:03,381
<i>And that's something that I love.</i>

1372
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:09,429
<i>I love the fact that I'm doing it now.</i>
<i>But I also had to wait 20 years to do it.</i>

1373
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,766
<i>When I could have had the chance</i>

1374
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:15,018
<i>to really try and work</i>
<i>my way towards directing,</i>

1375
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:18,647
<i>I stopped because</i>
<i>I wanted to be with my kids,</i>

1376
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:20,565
<i>'cause I couldn't choose both.</i>

1377
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:24,236
<i>I was working after work</i>
<i>and on the weekends.</i>

1378
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:27,072
<i>And I have a very clear memory</i>
<i>of this one morning,</i>

1379
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:29,783
<i>I remember my kids telling me,</i>
<i>"Why don't you come play with us?</i>

1380
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:32,160
<i>"Play catch."</i>
<i>I'm like, "I'll be right there."</i>

1381
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:36,373
<i>I'm thinking, "Yeah, I'm gonna draw</i>
<i>a few things and be done with it."</i>

1382
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,460
<i>They came in and said good night to me.</i>

1383
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:44,881
<i>I missed them the whole damn day,</i>
<i>and it hit me so hard.</i>

1384
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:47,801
<i>They only have this time once,</i>
<i>so I wanna make sure</i>

1385
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:50,136
<i>that they get as much as possible from me.</i>

1386
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:57,686
<i>As I made the story</i>
<i>and as it gets more and more specific,</i>

1387
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,939
<i>you start to really realize</i>
<i>what it means to you.</i>

1388
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:02,983
<i>And for me, it's like, "Oh, my God.</i>

1389
01:21:03,066 --> 01:21:05,944
<i>"This is my kids</i>
<i>wanting me to play with them,</i>

1390
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:08,154
<i>"while I'm trying</i>
<i>to move my career along."</i>

1391
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:12,492
<i>I was letting them down</i>
<i>because I wasn't paying attention,</i>

1392
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:14,286
<i>which is basically what my short's doing.</i>

1393
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:17,956
<i>I needed that awakening.</i>

1394
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:22,377
And it's funny how the short
completely kind of turned that way.

1395
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:25,505
<i>And that's when it found its honesties,</i>

1396
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:28,008
<i>because I could relate to it</i>
<i>in a very specific way,</i>

1397
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:30,093
<i>in a truthful way.</i>

1398
01:21:30,176 --> 01:21:32,387
COLLINS: <i>There's something about</i>
<i>the more personal you get,</i>

1399
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,347
<i>the more universal the story becomes.</i>

1400
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:38,184
<i>And I think for my kids' generation,</i>
<i>their kids' generation,</i>

1401
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:45,150
<i>those stories are less and less</i>
<i>your typical fantasy fairytale stories</i>

1402
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:47,027
<i>in terms of what makes them feel</i>

1403
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:49,863
like they lean forward and it's...
And it speaks to them.

1404
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:53,450
DOCTER: <i>Audiences are always</i>
<i>looking to be surprised,</i>

1405
01:21:53,533 --> 01:21:55,702
<i>when they sit down, they turn on a movie.</i>

1406
01:21:55,785 --> 01:22:00,415
<i>If we can get filmmakers who come from</i>
<i>different and diverse backgrounds,</i>

1407
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,792
<i>I think we have a better chance</i>

1408
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:05,378
of giving them that surprise
that they're looking for.

1409
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,547
MORRIS: <i>Given the director's newness</i>
<i>to these roles,</i>

1410
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:09,716
<i>given the constraints</i>
<i>they've had in their budgets,</i>

1411
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:13,261
<i>given the time</i>
<i>they've had to make them in,</i>

1412
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:17,349
I'm always blown away
when I see the films that get finished,

1413
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:21,353
<i>and I'm always amazed</i>
<i>how much they pull it off,</i>

1414
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:23,730
<i>and how good they are.</i>

1415
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,484
COLLINS: <i>I see SparkShorts evolving only</i>

1416
01:22:27,567 --> 01:22:31,363
<i>in that I see</i>
<i>the filmmakers themselves evolving.</i>

1417
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,074
<i>And as we look into the future,</i>

1418
01:22:34,157 --> 01:22:37,577
<i>we need to continue</i>
<i>to get new voices out there,</i>

1419
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:40,288
<i>to give them an opportunity,</i>
<i>to give them the platform,</i>

1420
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:46,127
and to challenge ourselves
to be open to hearing them

1421
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:50,548
<i>as a studio, as a world, as an audience.</i>

1422
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:57,097
<i>This program's gonna give us</i>
<i>a preview of our filmmakers to come.</i>

1423
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:04,145
<i>And it's gonna be the best opening act</i>
<i>to ultimately what is hopefully</i>

1424
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:06,773
<i>the next couple decades</i>
<i>of Pixar filmmaking.</i>
