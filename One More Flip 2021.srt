00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,714
That's where I met Meeka.

176
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:48,022
Her dad is some uppity
white politician.

177
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:50,633
And as soon as she got pregnant
by a random black dude,

178
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:52,592
he gave her ass the boot.

179
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:56,900
She'd been on
government assistance
ever since.

180
00:09:56,944 --> 00:10:00,338
Tragic. But she's loyal.

181
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:03,167
And she got a good heart.
And I love her.

182
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:05,735
I met LeLe when I went to go
live with my grandmother

183
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,476
after my parents died.

184
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,086
We both needed each other.

185
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,480
I guess it's like
we're both broken.

186
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:15,484
And she knows how to fix me
and I know how to fix her.

187
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:19,009
Even though she ain't shit,
she got her ugly way.

188
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:22,012
At the end of the day,
she's still a good person.

189
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:25,276
So when it comes to these two,
I ride for them

190
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,017
'cause I know they'll ride
for me.

191
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:29,150
That's that on that.

192
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,895
[Marco]
What's up, dawg? You all right?

193
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,250
-You good?
-Yeah, I'm straight.

194
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,905
You good?

195
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:46,994
I'm gonna have to holler
at you one on one.

196
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,170
Man, you fool.

197
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,261
You ain't had to do doggin' them
like that last night.

198
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:57,004
Hey, can y'all give us a minute?

199
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:04,446
Don't ever tread
on my business like that.

200
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:08,276
Bro, this nigger got a connect
from Facebook.

201
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:10,757
-There's money on there.
-There's a paper trail on there.

202
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,976
I'm trying to raise my kids
from this out of the gate.

203
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,978
I'ma gonna give your half
another night.

204
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:18,112
I'm gonna take my half.
I'm done with this shit.

205
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:20,680
I ain't getting it like you.

206
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:25,685
We eating out of the same bag.
You just fucking it up.

207
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,034
I'm the one that get us pay.

208
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:29,210
Like now I got a buyer
that want it all.

209
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:33,823
Where you meeting him from?

210
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:35,869
It's the same nigger
I've been selling to.

211
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:37,305
He trying to up his weight.

212
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:41,352
-Hell, no, I'm straight.
-Why?

213
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:42,745
Niggers don't up their weight
like that.

214
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:45,705
-So front me.
-Hell, no.

215
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:47,358
Then roll with me.

216
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:50,535
Look, if you don't like the way
it look, we can pull off.

217
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,016
If you want out, you out.

218
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,498
We hit a dog ass lick last night
and we came up.

219
00:11:56,541 --> 00:12:00,720
We flip that, you get
your brick and you go.

220
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:14,516
I think I want to upgrade.

221
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:16,823
But Marco gonna be trippin'.

222
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:20,435
I mean, it's not like you don't
need a new phone anyways.

223
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:23,307
You might as well.

224
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:25,179
[Tajani]
You're right.

225
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:30,053
You got the new iPhone?

226
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:31,794
[man 1]
Are you a new or existing
customer?

227
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,404
Existing customer.

228
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:35,145
-And I'm gonna be paying cash.
-Okay, that's cool.

229
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,234
So if you buy one, you can get
the other one for free.

230
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:39,367
-Hmm.
-[LeLe] Uh...

231
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,980
-T? Let me get the free phone.
-No, I'm gonna give it to Meeka.

232
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:46,896
I don't need no new phone.

233
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,899
I didn't say you did but you can
give your old one to Little D

234
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:51,771
and you can get a new one.

235
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:53,947
Please.

236
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:56,819
Bitch, for me.

237
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,778
Fine.

238
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:02,912
See, T, that's that bullshit.
How come she gets everything?

239
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:06,176
You know what, that's all right.

240
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,656
I'm about to go to the store
next door.

241
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,136
Anybody want anything?

242
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:14,315
Oh, wait, never mind,
y'all don't ever give me shit.

243
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,449
[Tajani]
She be doing the most.

244
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:20,451
[man 1] It's gonna take
a couple of minutes.

245
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,845
-Okay, that's cool.
-All right.

246
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:25,805
[Meeka] You know
you ain't slick neither.

247
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,024
What?

248
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:29,634
You should be giving
that phone to Marco.

249
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:32,202
That's why he hate
our ass now anyway.

250
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,856
Girl, I'm not thinking
about Marco,

251
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,641
especially after that shit
he pulled staying out all night.

252
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:37,599
[scoffs]

253
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,820
-Taj!
-[Tajani] Oh, shit!

254
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:44,258
[suspenseful music playing]

255
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:49,480
[man speaking indistinctly]

256
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:50,917
Bitch.

257
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:59,229
Hey, damn!

258
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,232
Okay?

259
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,409
[man 2] Hell.

260
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:08,108
-Leave that bitch.
-Shut the fuck up.

261
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:16,681
Excuse me, I'm looking for Taji.

262
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,074
I'm Taji.

263
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:19,380
Your friend Loretta
is looking for you.

264
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:21,991
-You can follow me.
-Okay.

265
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:32,567
Here she is.

266
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,573
It's okay, let me see.

267
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:43,447
It don't even really
look that bad though.

268
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:48,235
What am I going to tell Tae, T?

269
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,238
We ain't got to tell Tae shit.

270
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:55,285
He's going to kill me
when he finds out.

271
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:57,897
Well, what was that back there?

272
00:14:59,594 --> 00:15:01,901
[crying]

273
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,556
Rome.

274
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,123
His name is Rome.

275
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:10,910
You fucking
a Dollar Store nigger, LeLe?

276
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:19,396
Did you?

277
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:23,705
We met at a club...

278
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:27,274
and I went back to his crib...

279
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:31,365
and we... You know.

280
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,892
And I stole a few bills from
his wallet while he was sleep.

281
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,678
But that was a few months ago.
He could have just let it go.

282
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:42,767
He couldn't have.

283
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:45,292
Bitch, he work
at a fucking Dollar Store.

284
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:49,339
He probably worked all week for
that money you took from him.

285
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:55,128
I didn't know.
I didn't know he worked there.

286
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:57,217
He looked like he had money.

287
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:00,307
Lower your fucking voice
in here.

288
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,788
So to keep it real,

289
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:06,313
Tae probably already done seen
that video.

290
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,968
So here's what we got
to tell him.

291
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,972
The nigger thought you was
stealing from the store,

292
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,974
he got all handsies with you,

293
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:18,542
and me and Meeka came to rescue
your ass once again.

294
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:24,505
You owe me.

295
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:26,986
You owe me big.

296
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,727
Okay.

297
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:31,642
And Meeka too.

298
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,168
Got you.

299
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,827
[Tajani]
Can you believe that shit, bae?

300
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:46,657
She really tried to steal
from a Dollar Store nigga.

301
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:49,138
[Marco]
Hell, no, that shit's crazy.

302
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:51,532
And embarrassing as fuck.

303
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,275
You should have seen that.
Oh, God, it was crazy.

304
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,061
[Marco] Is that so?

305
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:02,717
[commentator speaking
faintly on TV]

306
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:09,898
This was the nigga
she met today?

307
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:11,291
No, she been, knew him.

308
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,206
It was her first time
seeing him today.

309
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:14,642
But she met him before.

310
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:16,296
That's when she tried
to take the money.

311
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,864
That's why I tell you,
don't hang out with them
dumbass bitches.

312
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:22,128
-Why is that, bae?
-[cellphone vibrates]

313
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:23,390
Hold on.

314
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:27,829
Hello.

315
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:32,399
All right.
I'll be there in a few.

316
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,620
[Tajani]
Mm-hmm.

317
00:17:36,664 --> 00:17:40,537
Mm-hmm, what? Nobody got time
to get that shit.

318
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:43,453
Nothing, Marco.

319
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,890
See? When you got
good chemistry,

320
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:48,328
you don't even have
to say nothin'.

321
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:50,199
Sure, I don't want him to go.

322
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:52,549
But he'll just turn around
and say some slick shit

323
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:56,423
like, "One of us gotta
go get this paper."

324
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:59,861
I don't want to hear that shit.
I ain't stupid neither.

325
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:02,211
Ain't that much drugs
in the whole world.

326
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:05,127
Most nights he's probably out
doing him with some other bitch

327
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:09,566
when I'm up waiting on him,
fighting the urge to text him.

328
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,742
I'm trying to call him
every few seconds,

329
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:15,006
but how the fuck
am I supposed to sleep,

330
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,443
while he in the street?

331
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:20,229
Hey, um, is Marco with you
by any chance.

332
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:22,362
No, but if you, uh...
If you see him,

333
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:24,451
can you tell him
I'm looking for him?

334
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,629
All right, thanks.

335
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,198
What up, dawg?
Is your cousin with you?

336
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:36,289
Yeah, no, we were supposed
to do breakfast in a few hours.

337
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:40,423
So if you see him,
just have him call me.

338
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,687
All right, thanks.

339
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:55,177
[man 3] I'm telling you,
take the fucking deal.

340
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:58,049
It's the only shot
you're gonna get.

341
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:01,879
-Take the fucking deal.
-Okay.

342
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:02,837
Okay.

343
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,493
-Taji.
-[Tajani] Yes.

344
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,930
Good, good, good.
Come on, not much time.

345
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:11,150
I was able to get him
to see a judge today

346
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,629
and I'm not gonna lie to you,

347
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:14,196
the amount
that he was caught with

348
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,416
and the war going on
with opioids,

349
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:18,592
his bail will be set high.

350
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:20,942
But, also assuming
with his line of work,

351
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:22,900
that shouldn't be
that big of an issue.

352
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:24,859
Well, what the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

353
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:26,817
Come on now, lady,
let's not play the games.

354
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:31,213
Your man called me.
Besides, I'm hip to the game.

355
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,519
We should go.

356
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:38,351
[judge]
DeMarco Beasley.

357
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,583
Michael Fieger representing
DeMarco Beasley.

358
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:56,064
Kym Paul representing
the State of Michigan.

359
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:58,762
Your Honor,
my client has no prior arrest.

360
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:01,112
He owns a barber shop,
a carwash,

361
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:04,681
and he has a little league
sports team for children.

362
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:07,684
Also, in the courtroom
is his soon-to-be wife

363
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:10,078
and his godson
whom he dearly loves.

364
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:13,212
My client poses
no threat to the community,

365
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,691
nor is he a flight risk.

366
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,780
Why would he be?
He's an innocent man.

367
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:19,653
And we ask that bail be set
at a reasonable amount.

368
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:21,698
Your Honor,
the amount of opioids

369
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:24,527
that DeMarco
and his associate Eric Harris

370
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:26,703
was in possession of
was enough to stock a hospital--

371
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:30,446
It was not on his person,
nor was it his car.

372
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,884
If you will allow me
to finish my statement

373
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:35,277
on behalf of the people.

374
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,061
We fear that the defendant
will flee

375
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:40,369
once he is aware
of these current charges.

376
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:43,677
Those charges
being felony firearm,

377
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,548
assault with a deadly weapon,

378
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:48,464
assault with intent
to do bodily harm

379
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:50,466
and murder in the first degree.

380
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,120
Your Honor,
why wasn't the defendant

381
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:53,382
made aware of these charges?

382
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:55,123
He wasn't made aware
of these charges

383
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,082
because we were unsure
about the cooperation

384
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:00,433
until just a few minutes ago.

385
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:03,697
Well, until the charges
are official,

386
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,787
and we have that in writing,
we ask that bail be instated.

387
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:09,006
Not only is Miss Kym Paul

388
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,835
withholding vital information
from my client.

389
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:13,794
What are we being
tried here for?

390
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:17,580
Your Honor, those charges
will be added within the hour.

391
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:19,103
They weren't made aware

392
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:21,715
because we were unsure
about the cooperation

393
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:24,370
that we would receive
until just a few minutes ago.

394
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:27,111
But based
on this new information,

395
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:29,592
we request that bail be denied.

396
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:31,812
So, what is this all about?

397
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:33,944
You have us in here
on a false pretense

398
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:36,947
in order to drop a bombshell
to make your career?

399
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:39,602
Your Honor,
my client is a business owner

400
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:40,951
that has a loving family

401
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:43,780
that expects him
to return home tonight.

402
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:49,003
I am wise enough to know
when I'm being used.

403
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:52,528
In fact, I know exactly
when I'm being played.

404
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:55,009
Mr. Beasley.

405
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,360
Yes, Your Honor.

406
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:01,581
Is your uncle's name
Connard Beasley?

407
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:04,410
Yes, Your Honor.

408
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:06,194
Your uncle, Connard,
was sentenced

409
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:09,589
for operating a criminal
enterprise 16 years ago.

410
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:11,112
And if I'm not mistaken,

411
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:15,203
he was also a entrepreneur
with several businesses.

412
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,946
Is that who taught you
how to be a businessman?

413
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:21,601
That is a blatantly
biased remark

414
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:23,951
that paints my client
in the miscreant light.

415
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:26,170
Excuse me, you come
into my courtroom

416
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:28,782
and you question my wisdom,
then my integrity?

417
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:31,132
My apologies, Your Honor.

418
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:37,051
Apology accepted,
but bail is denied.

419
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:38,487
[Marco]
Murder.

420
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:40,010
How the fuck you didn't
know about this?

421
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:42,752
Look, no one is more upset
than me right now.

422
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:45,668
I was clearly blindsided today.
You saw that.

423
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:49,193
Really?
Nobody was more upset than you?

424
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:53,023
-Besides you two, of course.
-Where the fuck was Eric at?

425
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,764
Ain't you supposed to be
representing him too?

426
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:57,376
Unfortunately, they won't let me
represent you both.

427
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,335
But I have a friend of mine
that's handling his case.

428
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:04,339
You better get your friend on my
phone 'cause somebody's talking.

429
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,211
Well, rest assured,
if your friend was talking,

430
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:09,518
my friend would have dropped
his case.

431
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:10,911
[Tajani]
Mm-hmm.

432
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:13,740
-Hey, get us some water.
-Right.

433
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:19,746
-[door closes]
-[Marco sighs]

434
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:23,314
-We good, baby.
-He set you up.

435
00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:24,707
Look, chill with that shit.

436
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:26,709
I've known Eric
since he was a kid.

437
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:29,538
It's obvious as hell.
You can see that shit yourself.

438
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:32,672
-Why weren't he at court today?
-Hey, chill.

439
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:34,978
Look, I got about 60 G's
at the crib.

440
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:37,372
I need you to move that shit
as soon as possible.

441
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,852
Okay, whatever.

442
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:41,202
Look, you need to move that shit

443
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,073
'cause they might hit the crib
and they already hit it.

444
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:45,685
You're still worried
about money right now.

445
00:23:45,728 --> 00:23:49,558
Hell, yeah.
Shit, I got lawyers to pay.

446
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:51,560
Plus, I got to make
sure you straight.

447
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:54,650
I need you to go see
my cousin Lamar.

448
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:57,000
-For what?
-[man 4] Time's up.

449
00:23:57,784 --> 00:24:01,483
Ugh. Look, look, baby,
just go see him.

450
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:07,707
[melancholy music playing]

451
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:20,807
-I love you, Marco.
-I love you too.

452
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:32,993
[doorbell rings]

453
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:36,126
I swear to God,
they be cheating on her, dawg.

454
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:41,610
Damn, nigger.

455
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:43,656
You don't know
the door's going crazy?

456
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,227
[Tajani]
Lamar and Pooh Bear is Marco's
Uncle Connard's sons.

457
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:51,925
After he got locked up,

458
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,623
Lamar took over all his
businesses and properties.

459
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:58,888
But, as you can see, they do
not keep up with this shit.

460
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:02,196
-[Pooh Bear]
Hey, what's up with you, T?
-Hey.

461
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,241
Ain't gonna keep him
long at all.

462
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:18,821
So what's up, cuz?
You good on cheese?

463
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:20,997
Yeah, I'm straight.

464
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,216
[chuckles]

465
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:24,479
What do you want?
A drink or something?

466
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,915
No, Lamar.

467
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:34,402
They finally got Bigfoot's ass,
huh?

468
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:35,882
[Tajani]
Mm-hmm.

469
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,579
You know, that's the only
nigger in our family

470
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:41,714
that ain't never been to prison
before, that I can think of.

471
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:45,456
Heard him and Eric
caught a body too.

472
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,154
I don't know shit about no Eric.

473
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:50,113
I just know what
they did to poor Marco.

474
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:51,854
[Lamar]
Hmm.

475
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:54,204
Just gonna have to sit down
for a while.

476
00:25:54,248 --> 00:25:56,816
-How long you think
they're gonna give him?
-Hmm.

477
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:00,210
Maybe take a deal.
Maybe about ten.

478
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:02,343
Come home
with about four to five.

479
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:06,260
Baby.

480
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:10,003
That was so big, bae.

481
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:12,962
Bitch, you lost your
goddamn mind?

482
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:16,270
Can't you see we got a guest,
huh?

483
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,013
Take your ass back
to the damn room!

484
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:34,288
-[Tajani] What's this?
-[Lamar] Stash house.

485
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:39,467
Write the address down
on this piece of paper.

486
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,425
Don't put this shit in your GPS.

487
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:44,994
You got any extra money,
you take it here.

488
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,693
Marco got some bread and some
work there waiting for you.

489
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:52,045
So, look like you're gonna be
a busy lady while he locked up.

490
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:56,789
I told him I had him
but he wanted you to do it.

491
00:26:58,312 --> 00:26:59,705
There you go.

492
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,578
All right.
I think I'm gonna head out, cuz.

493
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,363
-All right, Taj.
-Thanks, Lamar.

494
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:12,108
You know he wouldn't
give nothing to me

495
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:14,110
that I couldn't handle,
all right?

496

00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,768
And to make matters worse,

514
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:05,727
I've been burning through
this money like crazy.

515
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:08,904
-What up, bae, what you need?
-Shit. Where is Marco, at?

516
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:10,253
I'm his people. What up?

517
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:11,690
No, I ain't fucking
around with you.

518
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:14,997
[Tajani]
I couldn't get this work off
for shit.

519
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:18,305
Whoever said drugs
sold themselves is a liar.

520
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:24,833
Your Honor,
my client wishes to plead

521
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:27,793
not guilty
to the felony firearm charges.

522
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:30,186
Not guilty
to the assault charges.

523
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,972
And not guilty to the murder
in the first-degree charge.

524
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:35,278
[man 5] Hell, yeah.
Free my nephew DeMarco.

525
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:37,541
[judge]
Enough! Be quiet!

526
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:39,630
Another outburst
like that in my courtroom

527
00:28:39,674 --> 00:28:42,721
and I will hold you personally
responsible, Mr. Beasley.

528
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:47,290
Mr. Putnam, I'm assuming your
client wishes to do the same?

529
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:50,511
Your Honor, as of now,
we'd like to stand mute.

530
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:54,123
[judge]
All right, trial will begin
in 20 days,

531
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,864
which I believe is a Monday.

532
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:57,953
Uh, we are adjourned
for the day.

533
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,348
[Michael] Yeah, man.

534
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:03,393
I don't know.

535
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:05,265
I guess, you know.

536
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:13,186
I know what you're thinking
but ain't even like that.

537
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:15,710
I never give
my full discovery yet.

538
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,452
[Marco]
You know what I'm thinking?

539
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:21,542
Shit, I'm thinking how the fuck
I'm in handcuffs and you ain't.

540
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:30,159
DA is willing to drop
the murder charge

541
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:33,206
in exchange
for something old and useless.

542
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:36,383
Can be behind a statute
of limitations as well.

543
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:38,515
You'll be going home
on the possession charges

544
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,387
within a couple of months.

545
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,303
Hey, look, man, I ain't
snitchin' on nobody, dawg.

546
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:45,609
Now if we go to trial
for murder,

547
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:47,046
that could take up to a year.

548
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:49,657
That's a whole year
with you behind bars.

549
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,268
Look, I don't give a fuck
if it's three years.

550
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:54,314
I ain't snitching on nobody.

551
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:58,100
-Can you give us a minute,
please?
-Sure.

552
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:06,021
Look, you may not give
a fuck but I do, Marco.

553
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:07,544
They're trying to give me
with DeRico.

554
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:10,286
Ain't shit I can give.
Everything will be useless.

555
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,288
All my niggers are gonna be
locked up in a minute.

556
00:30:12,332 --> 00:30:14,377
Your niggers. When the fuck
is you gonna realize

557
00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:16,727
your niggers don't give a fuck
about you being in here?

558
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,817
Your niggers get to go home
every night to their women

559
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,297
while you are sitting here
looking dumb as fuck right now.

560
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:25,867
One of your same niggas is about
to snitch on your ass right now.

561
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:29,697
When the fuck am I gonna mean
as much to you as your niggas,
Marco?

562
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,481
Everything I do is for your ass.

563
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:35,616
Wow. You doing a lot right now.
I know that.

564
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:38,532
I need you to put a bail
on my books.

565
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:42,405
Look $1,000 every week
on your books,

566
00:30:42,449 --> 00:30:44,799
what the fuck is you
doing in jail with $1,000?

567
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,323
I'm trying to get set up
the best way I fucking can.

568
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:52,807
Well, it's costing us
a whole lot.

569
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,289
-That's all I'm saying.
-Is that a problem or something?

570
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,379
No, it ain't no problem.

571
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:01,163
No way in hell
I could tell Marco

572
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:02,991
I've been flying through
his money like this,

573
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:06,865
taking care of Little D, Meeka,
myself and all his legal shit.

574
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:09,302
Not to mention I can't get
this work off the same,

575
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:10,956
I don't know why.

576
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:15,743
[LeLe]
Ass, let's go sign on,
this is my jam, yes.

577
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:19,268
First of all, I'm not doing
this with you tonight.

578
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:22,010
-You don't have any [inaudible].
-Down.

579
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:23,316
Whatever.

580
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,926
T, what's going on
with the wine?

581
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,538
It's running out. Hurry up.

582
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:30,976
Well, calm your thirsty
ass down.

583
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:32,716
It's my last bottle too LeLe.

584
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,327
Cheers.

585
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:36,720
I'm sorry, y'all.

586
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:38,635
Look, Tae and his weak ass
baby mama

587
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:41,682
have been stressed
to meet the hell out, child.

588
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:44,206
[woman 1]
I got something for you'll.

589
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,947
I'm about to get some of this W,

590
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:47,731
you know that
she won't get us right.

591
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:48,950
Shot time.

592
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:50,865
-Hell, no.
-Yes.

593
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,388
Uh, hold up. What's going on?

594
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:55,261
We're not doing hard
liquor tonight?

595
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:57,045
[Tajani]
Girl, nobody say all that.

596
00:31:57,089 --> 00:32:00,657
-[LeLe] [Inaudible].
-Oh.

597
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:05,314
[Tajani]
Man, I've been spending
so much money.

598
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:08,752
You know Marco been facing
all of this time,

599
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:11,103
you know, all these bills,

600
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:12,931
my ass gonna be back
slinging bottles

601
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:15,020
at the strip club in no time.

602
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,936
First of all,
stop stressing out.

603
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:21,548
Second of all, didn't he leave
you work and money?

604
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,942
I mean, yeah, but this...

605
00:32:24,768 --> 00:32:26,814
I can't get this work off
for shit.

606
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:29,425
You know, 50,000,
it ain't no money, y'all.

607
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:30,949
I mean, look at this house.

608
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:33,821
I still gotta take care
of my granny.

609
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:37,607
And shit, Meeka.
That bitch on bed rest.

610
00:32:38,695 --> 00:32:42,699
Bottom line,
this bag almost gone.

611
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:44,745
Mm-mm, we'd got to set you up
to play,

612
00:32:44,788 --> 00:32:47,269
you is not about to go back
to no titty bar.

613
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:49,271
You gonna sling them lean

614
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:52,361
-just like you're slinging
new bottles in the club.
-Um, hold on, bitch.

615
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:54,929
You're not about to have my dog
out here looking crazy.

616
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,975
Trying to put a sparkle on our
activist with her ass out what?

617
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,325
-I asked out something
last night.
-[laughs]

618
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:00,761
-No, we are not doing it.
-Is what I'm saying.

619
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:03,372
No, fool.
She gonna dress that up for him.

620
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:05,679
What nigger don't want to cut
from the bad bitch?

621
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,074
This game is built off
of sex appeal.

622
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,556
You're right.

623
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:32,314
[Tajani]
If I was gonna make some money,
I just had to do it my way.

624
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:33,576
What up now, baby?

625
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,492
-What you need?
-Yeah, baby. Who is you?

626
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:40,192
-Everybody call me TJ.
-Oh, yeah, TJ.

627
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:44,196
-So what you got?
-Depends on what you need.

628
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,069
[Inaudible] for the lows.

629
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,724
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

630
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:52,073
This shit looks dope.

631
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:55,163
But is this shit straight?

632
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:57,644
'Cause I ain't trying to hide
these niggas thumbs out here.

633
00:33:57,687 --> 00:34:02,344
Oh, my God, I got the best
prices in the city guaranteed.

634
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:05,086
Fuck it.
Where all the motherfuckers.

635
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,088
See, that's what I like to hear.

636
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:11,788
For years I asked Marco
why he hadn't stopped.

637
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:16,228
And all it took for me was
one sale to figure out why.

638
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:17,925
And that's all it took.

639
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:20,014
All the niggers want to know

640
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,451
who was the bad bitch
with the pills and the drink,
ha, ha.

641
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:24,758
After Shine, I was averaging

642
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:27,978
like ten or more customers
per day.

643
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:29,632
Heavyweight too.

644
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:33,245
I'm talking pints by the case,
pills by the hundred.

645
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:36,944
And, Granny, I knew
these niggers were
just trying to fuck.

646
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:40,078
But they had to respect
the bad bitch for the hustle.

647
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:44,560
I had customers buying gifts,
tipping me with every order.

648
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:47,868
Hell, one dude even tried
to buy me a car.

649
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:50,218
But this was awesome.

650
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:52,525
I mean, the attention was cool,

651
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:55,484
but my mind was on Marco
and him getting home.

652
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:59,401
And the DA
kept delaying his trial.

653
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:12,414
[man 6 on TV]
Live from downtown Detroit,
home of been on Detroit.

654
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:15,591
Local news starts now.

655
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:18,638
...has come forward saying he...

656
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:21,206
Wait, wait, wait. What are you
doing sneakin' in this house?

657
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:22,598
Hey, sugar mama.

658
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:25,253
"Hey, sugar mama."

659
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:28,126
What do you think you're gonna
stash something in this house?

660
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:30,954
Been there, done that.
That's not gonna happen in here.

661
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:34,001
Sugar mama, why can't I just
come over here for some company?

662
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:37,091
Oh, now you want to come
for some company, huh?

663
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,441
Girl, you don't get it.

664
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:44,403
I don't flip more
than Patti LaBelle

665
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:46,056
and you and Marco come by.

666
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,364
You think if I know
when someone is coming here

667
00:35:49,408 --> 00:35:51,627
to stash some drugs in my house?

668
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:54,369
Granny,
it's just a couple dollars.

669
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:55,762
I would never bring them
in this house

670
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:57,590
that's gonna get you
in no trouble.

671
00:35:57,633 --> 00:36:00,810
Trouble? Girl, [inaudible] who
do you think you're talking to?

672
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:04,814
What's gonna happen,
you're gonna end up in jail.

673
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:08,514
-Locked the fuck up.
-It's only till Marco get out.

674
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:10,646
Then me and him
are both out of this.

675
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:13,867
-I promise.
-Ha, you waiting on Marco, huh?

676
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:17,914
You know that
I think about a man.

677
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,829
You're sitting there
waiting on Marco.

678
00:36:19,873 --> 00:36:22,571
You know what a man
is to me right now?

679
00:36:22,615 --> 00:36:27,185
It's a lick, a hump, and a bump.
So you gonna wait on what?

680
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:31,711
It's only temporary, nanna.

681
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:34,409
You just hard-headed.

682
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:37,934
Girl, you just don't know,
you're gonna have to learn
the hard way.

683
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:49,816
[rock music playing]

684
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:12,360
You got, Sada Baby
in the building.
Bitch squad I see 'em.

685
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:29,725
Damn, we get a bottle
with the booze now?

686
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:32,250
[woman 2]
Oh, no. This from Sada, to you.

687
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:37,385
Oh, no, baby.
Send it back for me, boo.

688
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:38,908
[LeLe]
Uh, mm-mm.

689
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:41,737
-No, we're drinking this.
-Thank you, thank you.

690
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:45,263
Meeka, you cannot be fucking
drinking in the club.

691
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:46,655
They are gonna put us out.

692
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,396
-Why not?
-You are pregnant.

693
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,704
[blows raspberry]
Girl, tell me some shit
I don't know.

694
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:53,923
I ain't drank
or smoked in six months.

695
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:55,447
I deserve a treat.

696
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,885
Can't drive us back now,
can you?

697
00:37:58,928 --> 00:38:00,800
Thank you, Sada.

698
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:03,411
[chuckling]

699
00:38:04,238 --> 00:38:06,632
Ooh, this is my shit.

700
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:09,722
Meeka, where's you going?

701
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:12,725
This bitch.

702
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:17,425
Listen, that girl gonna do
whatever she want to do anyways.

703
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:19,079
That's ridiculous.

704
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:23,083
You know this already.
You can't watch over her 24/7.

705
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:26,129
And you cannot control
what she does.

706
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:31,439
Besides, her big ass
probably needs some dick.

707
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:33,398
You bitches is nasty.

708
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:35,443
And that bitch is pregnant,
LeLe.

709
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,837
So?
You know what they say, right?

710
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,102
-No, I don't.
-Pregnant pussy is the best.

711
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:43,538
I tried that.

712
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:46,976
Plus, she do got that
Little D running away.

713
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:49,849
Why you say that?

714
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:53,374
-Oh, she didn't tell you?
-Tell me what, bitch?

715
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:57,813
Girl, Little D damn near burned
down the house the other day.

716
00:38:57,857 --> 00:39:00,947
You lying. She wouldn't
have said something like that.

717
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:04,559
Set the drapes
in his room on fire.

718
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:07,867
Goddamn.

719
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:10,086
Baby girl.

720
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:14,874
Even a clone,
you still be one of a kind.

721
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:16,658
[laughs]

722
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:19,052
-No way.
-Yeah.

723
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:22,838
Name's Red, baby.
And listen here, sweet thing.

724
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:26,015
If I was a six,
and you was a nine,

725
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:29,454
that'd be the only time
you wouldn't be there down.

726
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:32,544
[laughs]
And I ain't lying.

727
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:36,025
You feel what I'm saying,
baby girl?

728
00:39:38,027 --> 00:39:39,638
-Maybe.
-Ooh.

729
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:42,075
Well, how about a dance?

730
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:45,383
-All right.
-Let me see you walk.

731
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:49,909
-Bitch, where is you going?
-[LeLe] Over here.

732
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:52,041
That nigga is old as fuck, LeLe.

-[LeLe] Fine. Come on, babe.
-All right.

734
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:56,437
I like the way you walk.
Peace and blessings.

747
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:28,643

748
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,778
Nigger, I know how you

Where he at? Where he at?
Locked up?

755
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:53,712
Told the nigger a thousand
times about that shit too.

756
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:56,149
Damn.

757
00:40:56,976 --> 00:40:59,935

Fuck all that though

-That's stupid.
-What you drinking?

Oh, you ain't have a bitch buy

Sitting in the club
looking stupid.

00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:32,838
I don't think you look stupid.

770
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,624
Let me see your phone.

771
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:39,845

-Bitch, I'm ready to go.
-Okay. So go.

-Kicking it with Red tonight.
-Is you smoking dope?

786
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:24,542
Give me two minutes

00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:27,022
-Okay, babe?
-Do what you do, sweet.

788
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:28,284
Thank you.

789
00:42:29,764 --> 00:42:32,201
Look, I'm trying to get me
a sugar daddy right quick.

790
00:42:32,245 --> 00:42:35,857
If you ready to go,
then leave with Meeka.

791
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:37,467
You came with me,
you're leaving with me.

792
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,295
You know how this shit go.

793
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:40,993
Now do you want to let
dad pick you up
from your house, that's on you.

794
00:42:41,036 --> 00:42:42,429
But you're leaving with me.

795
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:45,301
You ain't nobody, Mama Taj.

796
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:48,609
Remember, you aborted your baby
when Marco got locked up.

797
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:50,698
What the fuck
you just say to me?

798
00:42:50,742 --> 00:42:52,570
[Red] Baby,
let's get on the party here.

799
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:55,224

802
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,585
[Meeka]
Talking that shit.

803
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:11,240
Come on, bring that shit on.
Let's go.

804
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:16,289
[Tajani]
Bitch, you're pregnant.
Get your ass in this car.

805
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:21,990
Stink ass dumb bitch.

806
00:43:23,122 --> 00:43:25,777
I'm taking your ass
to the hospital.

807
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,996
For what?
There ain't shit wrong with me.

808
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,869
-You can just shoot me home.
-No, I'm taking you to the ER

809
00:43:30,912 --> 00:43:33,480
and I'm not taking no chances
with you or this baby.

810
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:36,483
Taj, I said I'm all right.

811
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:40,139
You don't know
what the fuck you are.
You ain't no doctor, are you?

812
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:45,274
God damn, Meeka, I swear to God,
between you and LeLe,

813
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:48,408
you're like two fucking
little ass kids.

814
00:43:48,451 --> 00:43:51,150
Everywhere we go,
I got to chaperone you two hoes.

815
00:43:52,194 --> 00:43:55,154
What was you even fighting
that fucking girl for?

816
00:43:57,722 --> 00:43:59,114
She's my baby daddy's new bitch.

817
00:43:59,158 --> 00:44:02,291
-Of course.
-She saw me in the club.

818
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:05,860
Called herself trying to talk
shit about me to her girls.

819
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:09,081
Fucking called me
fat white trash.

820
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:13,781
But you see how I fucking
dropped her ass, right?

821
00:44:13,825 --> 00:44:16,871
Hey, why didn't you tell me
about Little D

822
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:18,525
about him burning them drapes
down and shit.

823
00:44:18,568 --> 00:44:20,396
Like I feel the ways about that.

824
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,750
You know what if you don't feel
like your son almost burning you

825
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:29,057
and him the fuck up
was important enough
to tell me, then cool.

826
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:31,016
Do whatever you want to do.

827
00:44:36,761 --> 00:44:38,197
What if something
is wrong with him?

828
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:43,202
What if he's retarded
or something?

829
00:44:43,245 --> 00:44:45,030
[cries]

830
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:48,598
-I can't--
-He might need a special
school or something, medicines.

831
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:50,513
I can't afford that shit, Taj.

832
00:44:51,253 --> 00:44:53,386
How am I supposed
to take care of my baby?

833
00:44:54,996 --> 00:44:56,606
I already told you
where I stand on that,

834
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:59,261
like, you need anything,
all you got to do is--

835
00:44:59,305 --> 00:45:00,480
What? What?

836
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:04,876
You want to take care of me
and my son?

837
00:45:04,919 --> 00:45:06,878
You're gonna put me
through school?

838
00:45:07,879 --> 00:45:09,707
How does Marco feel about that,
hmm?

839
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,014
You run that shit by him?
Because he hate my ass.

840
00:45:13,058 --> 00:45:15,277
-That's not true.
-Bullshit!

841
00:45:15,321 --> 00:45:17,062
That's not true.

842
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:20,761
Look, he only tolerates me
because of you
and you fucking know it.

843
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:25,113
That motherfucker probably
will make some shit up

844
00:45:25,157 --> 00:45:27,376
if something happened to me

00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:54,062
Lamar sent me.

1017
00:56:54,802 --> 00:56:57,196
Lamar's sending bitches
out here?

1018
00:56:57,239 --> 00:57:00,112
Look, does Derek want
his shit or not?

1019
00:57:00,155 --> 00:57:01,505
[man 9] Hold on.

1020
00:57:10,122 --> 00:57:12,864
Sit your bag down,
I got to search.

1021
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,098
Hold on. I got that.

1022
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,624
Derek's upstairs, follow me.

1023
00:57:41,153 --> 00:57:42,763
Yo, D.

1024
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:44,548
Your people from Detroit here.

1025
00:57:52,381 --> 00:57:54,732
Why don't you go ahead and grab
yourself something to eat?

1026
00:57:54,775 --> 00:57:57,038
Something to drink or something?

1027
00:57:57,082 --> 00:57:58,997
I actually need to be
hitting the road,

1028
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,608
so can we just take care of this
real quick?

1029
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:06,744
I kind of need you
to stick around for a minute.

1030
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:08,876
Still watching the game.

1031
00:58:11,009 --> 00:58:12,663
Go make her a drink, baby.

1032
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:16,841
Go ahead, make yourself
comfortable. You are family.

1033
00:58:16,884 --> 00:58:20,671
[commentator speaking
indistinctly on TV]

1034
00:58:33,771 --> 00:58:36,643
-[Derek] Fuck!
-You can't be mad, right?

1035
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:38,166
You the one
who asked the bitch to stay.

1036
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:40,038
I was trying
to leave her earlier.

1037
00:58:40,081 --> 00:58:42,910
I appreciate all of this though.

1038
00:58:42,954 --> 00:58:47,349
D, yo you supposed to know
how to play this shit.

1039
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:49,743
Some type of tough king
back in the day.

1040
00:58:49,787 --> 00:58:51,092
All right, nigga.

1041
00:58:52,703 --> 00:58:56,358
You just let home girl beat you
three straight hands y'all.

1042
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:59,536
[Derek]
Said all right, nigga.

1043
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:02,843
All right, be cool,
be cool. All right,
I'm just fucking with you.

1044
00:59:02,887 --> 00:59:05,629
Hey, don't fucking tell me
to be cool, nigga.

1045
00:59:05,672 --> 00:59:07,326
I just lost $300.

1046
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:13,027
Y'all, trying to play
again or not?

1047
00:59:13,071 --> 00:59:15,029
Shit, Dogface got
some more money to lose,

1048
00:59:15,073 --> 00:59:16,901
it'll be all right over here,
huh?

1049
00:59:18,032 --> 00:59:19,904
What the fuck you
just called me?

1050
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,517
Derek, nigga. My fault.

1051
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,085
[Derek]
Oh, you think this shit funny,
huh?

1052
00:59:29,043 --> 00:59:32,351
-No, I'm just fucking with you.
-Don't, nigga!

1053
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,660
All right, what you got to be
all sensitive for nigga?

1054
00:59:36,703 --> 00:59:38,270
[Derek]
I ain't shit sensitive, nigga.

1055
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:41,012
Watch what the fuck
you say to me.

1056
00:59:41,055 --> 00:59:43,318
All right, niggas is too tough
on this bitch, huh?

1057
00:59:43,362 --> 00:59:44,581
What?

1058
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:49,673
-I ain't say nothing, man.
-That's the fuck I thought.

1059
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:58,769
I should just get that bag for
Lamar and get back on the road.

1060
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:03,251
Hey, you look familiar as hell.
Where do I know you from?

1061
01:00:03,295 --> 01:00:08,082
-Nigga, the couch.
-No, I know you.
I seen you before.

1062
01:00:08,126 --> 01:00:10,432
Boy, I ain't even from out here,
so...

1063
01:00:10,476 --> 01:00:11,695
[man 10] Okay.

1064
01:00:13,305 --> 01:00:16,656
Oh, you was at Sada's show.
That's who I've seen you with.

1065
01:00:17,483 --> 01:00:19,616
Yeah, I was there.

1066
01:00:20,312 --> 01:00:22,706
Yeah, you was all
on that nigga's head.

1067
01:00:24,185 --> 01:00:26,100
-It wasn't even like that.
-[man 10] Mm-hmm.

1068
01:00:26,144 --> 01:00:28,625
I ain't gonna lie,
Sada's shit slap though.

1069
01:00:30,061 --> 01:00:33,107
-[Tajani] Yeah, all right.
-That's your nigga?

1070
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:36,807
Mm-mm. No, it ain't nothing
like that. We're just cool.

1071
01:00:38,156 --> 01:00:39,940
Cool?

1072
01:00:39,984 --> 01:00:43,422
Man, you damn was sucking
that nigga's dick
on the way out the club.

1073
01:00:43,465 --> 01:00:45,076
Hey, keep that shit respectful.

1074
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:46,991
I mean, that's just what I saw.

1075
01:00:53,824 --> 01:00:57,741
You know?
You should link up with Sada.

1076
01:00:58,829 --> 01:01:00,352
What the fuck you talking about?

1077
01:01:00,395 --> 01:01:02,310
You notice that you used to fuck
with the music,

1078
01:01:02,354 --> 01:01:04,878
why don't you grab a feature
from that nigga or somethin'?

1079
01:01:04,922 --> 01:01:08,055
-Fuck off that nigga dick.
-What?

1080
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:10,667
I said take that nigga dick
out yo' mouth.

1081
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:13,670
[man 11]
Hey, don't come at me with
no dick sucking shit, nigga.

1082
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:15,193
[Derek]
What you gonna do, huh?

1083
01:01:16,194 --> 01:01:18,544
Ain't nobody trying to take
a day with you, bro.

1084
01:01:19,588 --> 01:01:21,808
You ain't got no motherfucking
kids this way nigga.

1085
01:01:21,852 --> 01:01:23,984
Where's my son, nigga?

1086
01:01:24,028 --> 01:01:26,683
And I ain't raised
no dick sucker.

1087
01:01:26,726 --> 01:01:28,162
So say something else

1088
01:01:28,206 --> 01:01:30,556
or I'm gonna slap the shit out
of you, nigga.

1089
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:33,341
[tense music playing]

1090
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:38,259
[laughing]

1091
01:01:40,914 --> 01:01:43,047
[coughing]

1092
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:46,703
Nigga can't tell
when he being fucked with.

1093
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:48,879
I'm playing with this nigga.

1094
01:01:50,054 --> 01:01:52,491
Come on, man.
Deal the fucking cards, man.

1095
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:56,321
Fuck out of here,
deal the cards.

1096
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:58,976
How much we playing for nigga?
You playing?

1097
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:01,326
[Derek]
Yeah, she playing. Let's go.

1098
01:02:05,547 --> 01:02:08,333
[man 11]
Hey, do me a favor, man.
Pay attention this time.

1099
01:02:08,376 --> 01:02:09,682
[Tajani laughs]

1100
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,075
Whatever.

1101
01:02:11,945 --> 01:02:13,860
Nigga, suck my dick!

1102
01:02:14,992 --> 01:02:16,515
[gunshots]

1103
01:02:19,648 --> 01:02:22,390
Told this bitch ass nigga
to watch his mouth.

1104
01:02:23,348 --> 01:02:26,133
Watch your mouth talking to me,
motherfucker.

1105
01:02:29,223 --> 01:02:30,921
Let's get this money.

1106
01:02:33,532 --> 01:02:36,970
[Tajani]
I never told Lamar what
happened while I was out there.

1107
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:38,102
I couldn't.

1108
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:40,757
He would've wanted answers

1109
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,803
or someone would have told him
about seeing me with Sada.

1110
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:45,936
So nothing happened.

1111
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:50,244
Dogface got his dog food
and Lamar got his money.

1112
01:02:50,288 --> 01:02:51,724
And that's that on that.

1113
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:56,163
[suspenseful music playing]

1114
01:03:15,487 --> 01:03:17,837
[crying]

1115
01:03:18,751 --> 01:03:20,884
He raped my baby, Taj.

1116
01:03:21,972 --> 01:03:25,366
[Tajani] Meeka, I'm...
Meeka, I'm so sorry.

1117
01:03:26,237 --> 01:03:28,587
I had to do it. I had to.

1118
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:31,372
I couldn't let him get away
with that.

1119
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:33,461
I couldn't let him get away
with...

1120
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:35,942
Where is he?
Where is he now, Meeka?

1121
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:43,210
He wasn't around, so, uh, Lee
has him and I gave him to Lee.

1122
01:03:43,254 --> 01:03:44,516
It's all right, Meeka.

1123
01:03:45,517 --> 01:03:48,128
I got Michael Fieger
on your case.

1124
01:03:49,173 --> 01:03:50,391
But I need you to be strong.

1125
01:03:50,435 --> 01:03:52,654
I need you to just hold
this shit down.

1126
01:03:52,698 --> 01:03:56,397
I know it's hard,
but you can do this.

1127
01:03:56,441 --> 01:04:00,401
Keep it together.
Keep it together, okay?

1128
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:04,144
You know what I was thinking?

1129
01:04:04,188 --> 01:04:07,104
Remember those college courses
you wanted to take?

1130
01:04:08,061 --> 01:04:10,629
We can enroll
in school together.

1131
01:04:10,672 --> 01:04:13,850
I can finish my business degree
and you could study...

1132
01:04:15,112 --> 01:04:17,854
What is it that you used
to want to study, Meeka?

1133
01:04:20,117 --> 01:04:21,770
Journalism.

1134
01:04:21,814 --> 01:04:23,468
We can still do that.

1135
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:27,864
You just got to keep it together
and stay strong.

1136
01:04:29,648 --> 01:04:33,043
You gotta stay strong
for that baby inside of you.

1137
01:04:33,086 --> 01:04:36,176
Meeka, I fucking love you.

1138
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:38,178
We're gonna get you out of this,
okay?

1139
01:04:39,049 --> 01:04:42,400
[judge]
How does the defendant plead?
-Not guilty, Your Honor.

1140
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:44,706
Under the grounds
of temporary insanity,

1141
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:47,796
the defendant and her child
are truly the victims here.

1142
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,929
They trusted Mr. Piper.

1143
01:04:52,758 --> 01:04:55,892
-[Tajani] What up though, bro?
-[Tae] What up though, Taj?

1144
01:04:55,935 --> 01:04:57,719
[Tajani] Y'all good?

1145
01:04:57,763 --> 01:05:01,027
[sighs]
Man, she's been acting funny
for a couple of weeks now.

1146
01:05:01,854 --> 01:05:04,248
[Tajani] Don't worry about it,
I'm gonna talk to her.

1147
01:05:14,606 --> 01:05:16,173
Hey, stranger.

1148
01:05:19,611 --> 01:05:21,004
Uh...

1149
01:05:21,047 --> 01:05:22,396
I got to commend you...

1150
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:26,400
for stepping up the way
you did for Meeka.

1151
01:05:26,444 --> 01:05:28,272
You didn't have to do all that.

1152
01:05:30,448 --> 01:05:31,928
You okay?

1153
01:05:34,191 --> 01:05:37,934
-You know Ray was on the news.
-They found him?

1154
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,635
His family was on the news.

1155
01:05:44,984 --> 01:05:46,681
He was a widower.

1156
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:53,950
He had three kids,
eight grandkids.

1157
01:05:55,212 --> 01:05:58,389
His daughter was on there,
crying.

1158
01:06:00,739 --> 01:06:06,092
They think he ran off like
he was senile or something.

1159
01:06:07,702 --> 01:06:10,662
Lee, I'm going to be honest,
that man is dead

1160
01:06:10,705 --> 01:06:12,881
and there ain't any shit
we can do about that.

1161
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:19,105
The best we can do, you should
just pick up and keep going.

1162
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:22,239
Where's the baby?

1163
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,372
It's in the room.

1164
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:28,506
Tae been helping me
look after him.

1165
01:06:29,942 --> 01:06:31,378
I mean, y'all good?

1166
01:06:31,422 --> 01:06:33,990
Y'all need any money
or anything like that?

1167
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,210
You sure?

1168
01:06:38,864 --> 01:06:40,605
You know I got you, right?

1169
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:55,359
Is that my god baby?
Hey, Little D.

1170
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:02,018
So you know you're gonna have
to come and stay with me
for a little while, right?

1171
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:05,064
Your mommy
and me worked it all out

1172
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:08,154
and she thinks it's best for you
to come stay with me.

1173
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:11,679
You'll get to have
your own very big room.

1174
01:07:12,376 --> 01:07:14,508
I even went to go buy
you some video games.

1175
01:07:14,552 --> 01:07:16,771
You love video games, don't you?

1176
01:07:17,859 --> 01:07:19,687
How long I got to stay with you?

1177
01:07:19,731 --> 01:07:21,037
Hmm.

1178
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,953
So you know what your mom did,
right?

1179
01:07:25,824 --> 01:07:29,219
She shot Mr. Piper,
the one that hurt me.

1180

01:20:56,199 --> 01:20:57,853
Come on, let's go.

1352
01:21:04,163 --> 01:21:06,122
[Tajani]
Get your hands off of me.

1353
01:21:07,558 --> 01:21:09,342
What the fuck
are y'all even looking for?

1354
01:21:09,386 --> 01:21:11,692
[agent 1] We'll let you know
when they find it.

1355
01:21:11,736 --> 01:21:12,650
[agent 2] Bingo!

1356
01:21:14,086 --> 01:21:16,001
Oh, yeah. Got her ass now.

1357
01:21:16,045 --> 01:21:20,049
[dramatic music playing]

1358
01:21:32,409 --> 01:21:33,497
Yeah.

1359
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:40,199
[Tajani]
I want my phone call.

1360
01:21:40,243 --> 01:21:41,940
I know my rights.

1361
01:21:41,984 --> 01:21:44,421
Phone call? You fucking serious?

1362
01:21:45,509 --> 01:21:47,903
Fucking rights, you don't
have any fucking rights.

1363
01:21:47,946 --> 01:21:50,122
It's not my custody.

1364
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:52,951
So, tell me about Baltimore.

1365
01:21:52,995 --> 01:21:55,432
Before you lie,
we've been following you

1366
01:21:55,475 --> 01:21:57,564
since Eric Harris was killed.

1367
01:22:00,219 --> 01:22:03,266
Marco taught you well,
don't say shit.

1368
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:08,967
-Still want your phone call?
-Use my cell.

1369
01:22:12,405 --> 01:22:14,103
[Marco on recording]
No, Pooh.

1370
01:22:14,146 --> 01:22:16,018
You know at the party the other
night, when he got drunk.

1371
01:22:16,061 --> 01:22:17,497
Can't keep his mouth shut.

1372
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:19,978
So what's up with you
and the nigga Dogface?

1373
01:22:20,022 --> 01:22:23,416
[Tajani on recording]
Look, all I did was drop off
a couple of bricks for Dog

1374
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,549
and pick up some money
and that's that.

1375
01:22:25,592 --> 01:22:28,944
-[Marco]
How much he pay you for that?
-[Tajani] A couple of stacks.

1376
01:22:32,556 --> 01:22:34,036
Yes!

1377
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:36,516
Yes, now we're getting it,
you see?

1378
01:22:37,474 --> 01:22:40,694
Marco don't care about you.
You're not getting a lawyer.

1379
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:44,785
He gave you up.

1380
01:22:44,829 --> 01:22:47,484
Marco would never do
no shit like that to me.

1381
01:22:48,224 --> 01:22:51,836
Well, he would and he did.

1382
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:55,144
Matter of fact,
he wanted me to give you this.

1383
01:22:58,234 --> 01:22:59,713
Kind of funny, isn't it?

1384
01:22:59,757 --> 01:23:02,847
A guy who'd always talk
some bullshit street cred,

1385
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:06,111
but as soon as his girl becomes
a groupie by some rapper,

1386
01:23:06,155 --> 01:23:08,984
he flips just like that.

1387
01:23:09,767 --> 01:23:12,683
Now,
you still want that phone call?

1388
01:23:16,252 --> 01:23:17,731
Fuck you.

1389
01:23:25,043 --> 01:23:28,960
Can you please tell the court
who David Felt is?

1390
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,309
[Marco]
Um...

1391
01:23:32,616 --> 01:23:36,750
David Felt was a dope boy
who worked for my uncle.

1392
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,972
Your uncle, Ricardo Beasley,

1393
01:23:41,668 --> 01:23:45,803
reputed leader of the Pony Up
drug organization?

1394
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:51,548
[Marco]
Hmm.

1395
01:23:52,984 --> 01:23:53,898
Yeah.

1396
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:59,208
[Tajani] Marco.
He snitched on everybody.

1397
01:24:00,165 --> 01:24:02,602
Dogface has so many charges,

1398
01:24:02,646 --> 01:24:05,605
he couldn't help but lie
when they put them up.

1399
01:24:05,649 --> 01:24:07,259
[Marco] My uncle thought
he was stealing from him.

1400
01:24:08,086 --> 01:24:11,655
So my uncle said he had
to get it and he had to get it.

1401
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:19,532
So, your uncle contracted you
to murder David Felt?

1402
01:24:21,317 --> 01:24:23,493
No, I, um...

1403
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,584
I hired, uh, people to do it.

1404
01:24:28,759 --> 01:24:29,803
And, um...

1405
01:24:32,328 --> 01:24:35,548
uh, I didn't kill him,
but I supplied the guns.

1406
01:24:35,592 --> 01:24:38,160
But you have killed before,

1407
01:24:38,203 --> 01:24:40,771
uh, according to this written
testimony?

1408
01:24:43,774 --> 01:24:46,429
-Yes.
-[Kym] About how many?

1409
01:24:49,432 --> 01:24:51,042
[Tajani]
Lamar?

1410
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,392
He must have been in disbelief
when they grabbed him.

1411
01:24:53,436 --> 01:24:55,742
Should they say
he barely had enough time

1412
01:24:55,786 --> 01:24:57,222
to put his blunt down?

1413
01:25:00,704 --> 01:25:07,537
And poor Pooh Bear, he died
in police custody, allegedly.

1414
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,626
[Kym]
So what you're saying is

1415
01:25:09,669 --> 01:25:15,240
that this woman
Tajani Vanessa Chalmers,

1416
01:25:15,284 --> 01:25:17,938
your lover and partner,

1417
01:25:17,982 --> 01:25:22,117
the woman who recently
became your fiancée,

1418
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:27,731
was a willing participant and
distributor of illegal narcotics

1419
01:25:27,774 --> 01:25:32,127
for just about as long as
the two of you were acquainted?

1420
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:39,612
That is correct.

1421
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,877
[Kym]
I have no further questions
for this witness, Your Honor.

1422
01:25:43,921 --> 01:25:47,925
Uh, bailiff, could you please
escort Mr. Beasley
out of the courtroom?

1423
01:25:52,408 --> 01:25:54,236
Will you step down, Mr. Beasley?

1424
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:57,456
[Tajani]
They say hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

1425
01:25:58,501 --> 01:26:03,158
Nah, these niggas can't handle
what they dish out
is more like it.

1426
01:26:05,029 --> 01:26:07,640
And I'll bet it was one of them
ho ass niggas from Baltimore

1427
01:26:07,684 --> 01:26:09,468
that told on me too,

1428
01:26:09,512 --> 01:26:12,384
thinkin' they were spilling
some tea seeing me with Sada.

1429
01:26:12,428 --> 01:26:14,995
They probably couldn't wait
to tell Marco.

1430
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:18,477
And me, shit I was labeled
the Queen Pin.

1431
01:26:18,521 --> 01:26:20,218
Can you believe that?

1432
01:26:20,262 --> 01:26:23,613
The head of this entire
operation from the beginning.

1433
01:26:23,656 --> 01:26:25,876
After all I did for this nigga,

1434
01:26:25,919 --> 01:26:29,184
he fucked me over
in the worst possible way.

1435
01:26:29,227 --> 01:26:32,709
I had to learn to walk out
the courtroom smiling.

1436
01:26:32,752 --> 01:26:37,017
I was sick, ended up
taking a plea deal.

1437
01:26:37,061 --> 01:26:40,586
Can you believe that shit?
Ten years.

1438
01:26:41,544 --> 01:26:42,588
Ten years.

1439
01:26:43,894 --> 01:26:46,505
Movie companies,
book publishers,

1440
01:26:46,549 --> 01:26:49,900
everybody been on my head
to like sell my story.

1441
01:26:49,943 --> 01:26:52,685
I told them I'd give them a call
once I come up with a name.

1442
01:26:53,556 --> 01:26:55,340
I was thinking One More Flip

1443
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:59,388
'cause I just kept chasing out
one more flip

1444
01:27:00,084 --> 01:27:01,912
and it's always on a dope.

1445
01:27:01,955 --> 01:27:05,263
And it's always going to be
a nigga like Marco

1446
01:27:05,307 --> 01:27:07,526
that'd flip on everybody.

1447
01:27:08,484 --> 01:27:10,094
While I've been in here,

1448
01:27:10,137 --> 01:27:12,749
I've been meeting a whole bunch
of women just like me.

1449
01:27:13,576 --> 01:27:15,969
We all got one thing in common,

1450
01:27:16,013 --> 01:27:18,711
if we hadn't have done
that shit to begin with

1451
01:27:18,755 --> 01:27:21,018
none of us would be
in this bitch.

1452
01:27:21,801 --> 01:27:24,151
Guess the moral of the story is

1453
01:27:24,195 --> 01:27:27,938
"If you don't jump in the game,
you can't lose."

1454
01:27:29,505 --> 01:27:31,246
