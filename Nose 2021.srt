3
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,083
It's not bad.

4
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,125
It's green.

5
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,125
Incredible

6
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,458
It's oily ...

7
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,041
It's good for the arms.

8
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:09,000
The smell is still strong
because it's too fresh

9
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:13,333
Is seeing patchouli worth
a three days trip ?

10
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,291
For me it is

11
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:20,416
I had never seen patchouli like this,
here in Indonesia.

12
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,958
It's very important to see
the product in its natural habitat

13
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:31,666
to see both the method they use
and what the material looks like

14
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:36,750
I find it quite moving to witness this

15
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,500
This is where it all begins for perfume

16
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:21,625
Is this office representative
of what is going on in your mind ?

17
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:23,791
It's a bit of a mess...

18
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:30,416
...But I do know where all
the project trials are though

19
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,875
For me, a perfume is a land of sharing

20
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,833
Double kiss !

21
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,125
-What perfume are you wearing?
-Ah...

22
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,333
It's a special one.

23
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,375
You don’t want to tell me.

24
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,458
I can't recognize it.

25
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,375
-It's smells very nice.
-Yes.Thank you.

26
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,583
A perfumer is an artisan.

27
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:32,458
It requires creativity and intuition.

28
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,625
as well as a lot of expertise.

29
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,750
It’s a sort of...

30
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:44,250
fragile balance between these two aspects.

31
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,500
What are you working on now?

32
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,000
On the Dior Homme perfume.

33
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,208
How to balance...

34
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,166
a top note with a bottom note.

35
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,791
The top notes are the most futile ones.

36
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:55,833
They only last a few seconds or a
few minutes depending on their volatility.

37
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,833
Then we have the middle notes.

38
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:03,708
It’s the warm and generous heart of
the perfume... and it lasts a few hours

39
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:08,083
And then the bottom notes
that last longer.

40
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:13,291
They are long-lasting notes.
The ones you remember.

41
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,416
Depending on whether it is
eau de toilette or eau de parfum,

42
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,541
you get to these bottom notes more or less
rapidly and they drag you to the bottom...

43
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,333
All of this balance itself
and creates a kind of symphony.

44
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,416
-What is the bottom note?
-It’s elemi.

45
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,750
Elemi is similar to incense.

46
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,833
My aim is to bring them together.

47
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,250
I don’t know,
I haven’t figured it out yet.

48
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,416
But that’s the idea.

49
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,458
So...to try something new

50
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,750
This is...

51
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:36,416
...a note we stopped using.
People forgot about it.

52
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:41,416
-You're making it again?
-Yes, I personally love it.

53
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,125
It smells very nice.

54
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,458
And the smells lasts a long time.

55
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:53,541
Did you create
your first perfume for someone ?

56
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:59,250
When you start, you go through a training.
At the time, it was still a training.

57
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,291
-So you work with other perfumers.
-Of course.

58
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:07,166
And they have you do
what they don't want to do themselves.

59
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:13,000
The first thing I did was a perfume

60
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:18,166
intended to whet the appetite

61
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,750
-of bovines.
-Really?

62
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,000
-So they would eat the fodder.
-That's crazy.

63
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:27,291
My first real perfume
was Diva from Ungaro.

64
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,791
I made that perfume for my wife.

65
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,666
-For your wife.
-Yes.

66
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,291
-It has to do with desire and femininity.
-Always.

67
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:39,833
Perfume is about emotions.
It starts with an emotion

68
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,791
-and it leads to seduction etc...
-Of course.

69
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:47,000
So desire is of course
the underlying theme.

70
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,166
-What drives all your perfumes.
-Yes.

71
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:54,958
He often envisions perfumes
based on the people he meets.

72
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,708
It's no secret
that women inspire him a lot.

73
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:02,125
Brunettes, blondes... They're different
when it comes to perfumes and perfumery.

74
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,750
But...

75
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:08,625
For him, it's about finding
what people might like.

76
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,250
That's his challenge.

77
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,416
When he sees someone,
he thinks, "What would suit them?

78
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,500
What would I do for him or her?"

79
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:21,166
The person comes first
and then comes the inspiration.

80
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,791
-I'll go get my jacket.
-Okay. Let's go this way.

81
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,583
-Sure, this way.
-That way?

82
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,416
-Yes, this way.
-It's better this way.

83
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,291
-Is it better that way?
-It's nicer.

84
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,125
Okay, I'll just go get my jacket.

85
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,000
-It's starting.
-Did you notice I had everything planted?

86
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,583
-Yes.
-I had the conifers removed.

87
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,875
Yes.

88
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,708
-The gardener didn't want to.
-Why not?

89
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:09,333
I don't know, I said,
"No, plant the osmanthus,

90
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,500
it'll be nice when we walk past,
it'll smell.

91
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,500
When we go out as well."

92
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,541
François and I are united
by something very specific;

93
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:23,291
we must create the best perfumes
for our two respective Houses.

94
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:29,916
What we share is our passion,
our knowledge of the raw materials,

95
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,916
our olfactory education as well
since we are both from Grasse.

96
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,333
Have you seen the pomegranates?

97
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,791
Let's see. Yes, they're ready.

98
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,333
They're beautiful.

99
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,583
Here in Grasse, people have extracted
raw materials for four centuries.

100
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:51,750
They started mixing them
and making perfumes

101
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,166
that were based on raw material
they collected themselves

102
00:16:56,333 --> 00:17:00,083
and materials that they imported and that
would go through Venice, like ambergris.

103
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:06,833
Grasse is a small town
of about 55,000 or 60,000 inhabitants

104
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,875
that enjoys the biggest amount
of knowledge in the world

105
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:14,708
regarding raw materials for perfumes

106
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,750
as well as the arts and skills
involved in making perfumes.

107
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,791
When you were born in Grasse,
when you have lived in Grasse,

108
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,958
when you were raised in a family where...

109
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,500
...the sense of smell
is as important as sight or hearing,

110
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,458
you don't have the same
background as others,

111
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,458
you're not cut from the same cloth.

112
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:12,958
There's a little bit of nostalgia about
being here since this is where I grew up.

113
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:18,666
I remember getting past here
early in the morning

114
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:25,458
because back then there were nightclubs
around Valbonne over there.

115
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,500
The road to get back to Grasse
went through here.

116
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:34,000
And since it was during
the summer holidays, in August,

117
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,250
the jasmine was blooming.

118
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:40,708
The smell of jasmine
came from right here next to us.

119
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,458
These memories are embedded in me.

120
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,458
This is one of my favorite smells

121
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:22,666
because it has a mysterious
and also magical side to it.

122
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,791
This is ambergris. This one is black

123
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,208
because it is relatively recent.

124
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,208
It's about 20 years old.

125
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,583
This one is grayer.

126
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:39,750
It's a bit older.
The name ambergris comes from its color.

127
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,291
This one is white.

128
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,958
It's one of the most sought-after notes.

129
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:51,416
Those three all have a different price.

130
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:55,166
But for perfumery, I prefer the gray one
or even the black one.

131
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,083
The black one is more wild.

132
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,750
What is it exactly?

133
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:03,000
It's a sort of concretion.

134
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,666
It comes from sperm whales.

135
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:11,791
They eat a lot of cuttlefish.

136
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:18,166
Cuttlefish have a bone,
but also a very pointy and sharp beak.

137
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,500
After a while,
the beak ulcerate their stomach,

138
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:26,541
so they secrete a substance
that wraps around the beaks

139
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,166
and they eject it.

140
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,916
It's lighter than water, so it floats.

141
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,166
Because of the effects of the sun,
the air and the sea,

142
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,416
it changes little by little.

143
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:03,625
Can you mentally create a perfume
without having any material?

144
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,875
A complete perfume? Yes, more or less.

145
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:12,291
In the same way as
when we read a formula, the recipe,

146
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:17,083
we manage to imagine
more or less what it will smell like.

147
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,541
The problem is this "more or less" part.

148
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:23,041
So between the idea
you have of the perfume,

149
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:27,458
and the formula you write down or read
in order to make a perfume,

150
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:33,541
there is a difference that we notice
when we go through the trials.

151
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,916
Which is precisely why we do these trials.

152
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:41,291
This is a formula, the recipe in a way.

153
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:47,458
There must be as much information
as possible on each line

154
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:51,083
about each material in the formula.

155
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:56,375
The number of materials
in a perfume varies a lot.

156
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:59,958
It depends on the perfume
and on the perfumer.

157
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:03,875
Generally speaking,

158
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:08,708
I would say there are between 15--
At least for me,

159
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,666
between 15 and 50 products.

160
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,583
The only thing that all Noses
have in common

161
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:21,208
even the young apprentices I have met
in schools, Brazilians, Japanese, Chinese,

162
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,250
is the passion for recording smells.

163
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:28,833
It's being passionate enough
about the idea of recording smells

164
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:32,875
that you're willing to go through
the torture that is a perfumer's training.

165
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:39,708
I think the only comparable field in terms
of difficulty when it comes to learning

166
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,625
is maybe ballet.

167
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:46,041
Every day, every single day,
you have to refresh your own memory,

168
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:49,125
You memorize the smells
and combinations of smells all over again.

169
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:52,375
And that is still not enough to guarantee

170
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:58,708
that what you will make, your recipe,
will be exactly what you envisioned.

171
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:04,250
Just like a ballerina can dance on pointe
425 times in the morning

172
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:08,125
and still fail on the 426th time
because she messes the spin.

173
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,500
The worst for us is to think you know.

174
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:25,500
It's very important
to keep up to date.

175
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:29,416
It's getting back to the baseline.
I'm constantly practicing.

176
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,458
Yes. Every day.

177
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:37,583
It's musky.

178
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,000
We can say they're all musky indeed.

179
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:45,666
Of course the musk ketone
isn't at ten percent but at one.

180
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,916
It's not soluble.

181
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:50,333
And the vulcanolide is at 11.

182
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,458
Can you smell how strong it is?

183
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:55,666
I'm surprised by the Galax's start.

184
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:58,708
The Vulcanolide has touches of pear to it.

185
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:02,916
-Vulcanolide is indeed--
-It's exceptional.

186
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,166
-It smells of undergrowth.
-It's very earthy.

187
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,291
Yes.

188
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:12,625
The undergrowth above Grasse,

189
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,958
-in October, during mushrooms season.
-Yes.

190
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,750
-The first flowers of the morning.
-They're nice.

191
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:57,208
With François, it was the meeting
of a lifetime for me on a human level.

192
00:26:57,375 --> 00:27:01,250
I was lucky enough
to take part in a conference in 2006,

193
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:05,416
the World Perfumery Congress
which was held in Cannes that year.

194
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:10,125
After the conference, a man came
to talk to me and we had coffee together.

195
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,583
Humbly, he told me, "I make perfumes

196
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:17,791
and I am looking for
exceptional raw materials.

197
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:22,250
I want to bring back exceptional materials
to the heart of my creation

198
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,958
and I would like to start
with flowers from Grasse

199
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:28,875
and I would like
to embark on this journey with you."

200
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:31,958
I thought, "Okay, he makes perfumes."

201
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,375
And then he showed me his card:

202
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:36,416
"François Demachy,
perfume creator for Dior"

203
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:42,833
I knew his name
but I had no idea it was him.

204
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:46,166
I just thought...

205
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,083
"Wow!"

206
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:53,458
They have a strong smell.

207
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,416
It's strong.

208
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00,083
We spoke the same language...

209
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:08,291
...I would talk to him about the flowers,
the harvest, organic production,

210
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:13,833
about things from my everyday life,
things that I get up for in the morning.

211
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:18,000
So he understood right away,
because he is from Grasse too and he has

212
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:22,583
tremendous respect for the raw material.

213
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,833
He said, "When you're working,
you need financial security.

214
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:32,250
so that all your energy is put at the
service of the raw material and beauty."

215
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,583
And that's it.

216
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,583
Have you ever sensed
a small touch of bubblegum?

217
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,833
-Yes, but not this time.
-Sometimes.

218
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,500
They need more sun.

219
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,541
-Exactly.
-Yes. Alcohol, basil and all that.

220
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:48,750
These are lactones.

221
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:54,125
Perfumes are a language
everyone understands

222
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:56,833
but few people can speak.

223
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:19,083
How did I become a grower?
It's the story of two people.

224
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:24,041
It's not only my story,
it's Rémi and Armelle's story.

225
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:29,375
We both wanted
to do something together at some point

226
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,875
related to the ground

227
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:35,458
because we both come
from families of farmers.

228
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:38,333
We experienced it when we were young.

229
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:42,250
Rémy more than me
since he worked at his grandparent's farm.

230
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,583
For me, it was just
when I was on holidays.

231
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,125
So we embarked on this journey.

232
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:51,750
At the time, Rémy kept working

233
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:56,208
as we needed to put food on the table
for the family.

234
00:29:56,333 --> 00:30:00,000
I started going forward
with the administrative procedures

235
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:03,916
and I learned the job with Carole.

236
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,666
I spent a lot of time at her place

237
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:12,166
digging, tying things together,
cutting, harvesting...

238
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:14,958
It was a long-term endeavor.

239
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:21,916
Between the time we first had the idea and
the day we planted our first rose bush,

240
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,458
a lot of time went by. Four years went by.

241
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:28,041
I would still help Carole from time
to time, she would train me at her place.

242
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:31,958
One day she told, "Next week
François Demachy is coming,

243
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:35,916
it would be good for you to be here,
I will introduce you."

244
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,041
So I met him at Carole's.

245
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:41,583
I briefly explained my project,

246
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,625
and after our conversation,
François said, "I'll come and have a look.

247
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,875
I'm interested, I'll come have a look."

248
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,125
You need to know
what we had planted back then.

249
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:55,208
We had planted 700 rose bushes
about 20 centimeters high.

250
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:57,666
Seven hundred rose bushes
is nothing at all.

251
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,791
It's like a garden.

252
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:03,750
It's nothing for a grower,
you don't get anywhere with that.

253
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:09,041
François came around after a little while.

254
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:12,666
Of course I was expecting
his arrival feverishly.

255
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:14,625
He was supposed to arrive early
in the afternoon

256
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:16,750
and he arrived late in the afternoon.

257
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:19,958
Early in the afternoon,
the weather was rather good.

258
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:21,875
When he arrived,
it was raining cats and dogs.

259
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:27,416
The view was so blocked we couldn't
even see the other end of the field.

260
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:32,250
All I had to show him was my little square
of rose bushes in the middle.

261
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:36,500
I suddenly realized what was happening.

262
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:41,750
I thought, "Oh, my God! You had him
come here, you have nothing to show him,

263
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:47,708
the weather is crap, he won't even realize
how beautiful the site is."

264
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:51,291
We hadn't done much to it yet,
but the site was beautiful.

265
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:55,166
And...

266
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,750
François is discreet and reserved,

267
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:05,416
so he didn't say, "Wow, this is amazing!
Let's work together, it'll be great!"

268
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,791
He didn't say much and when he left
and I closed the door behind him,

269
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:14,291
I told Rémy, "It's over,
we can start planting onions

270
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:18,333
and have a couple of sheep,
but it's over for the roses."

271
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:23,083
It was actually not over at all,
he called back after a while

272
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:25,250
and he said,
"I'm interested in your project,

273
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:28,083
I'd like to talk more about it."

274
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:36,208
-Happy Birthday!
-Happy Birthday! Thanks a lot.

275
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:50,791
Perfumery comes from distillation.

276
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:55,958
Men have always tried to capture scents

277
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:58,416
in a physical form.

278
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,708
And so they started using distillation
to capture the quintessence of the smell.

279
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:08,291
And in the 1920s and 1930s,
they started using extraction,

280
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:14,125
meaning they would use
the plant with a solvent

281
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:20,375
in order to extract everything they could;
its smell and other elements.

282
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:29,541
This factory's facility in Grasse,
is the historical part.

283
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:32,166
We work in a traditional way.

284
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:37,666
This is the part
where we transfer to perfumers

285
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:42,291
the knowledge
we have garnered over decades.

286
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:47,291
We do it the way we used to,
we do the same things we did 50 years ago,

287
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:54,166
so that perfumers can find the same smell
they remember, which hasn't changed.

288
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:57,291
-Do you know Mr. Demachy?
-Of course.

289
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:03,291
He has a good knowledge of perfumery,
about the products and the smells.

290
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,625
He knows all that very well,
he's from Grasse.

291
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:09,458
He knows the raw materials
and what they can be used for.

292
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:14,208
I worked a lot on making products for him.

293
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:18,041
They were very particular products.

294
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:24,375
He gives us an idea of what he wants,
and if he like the scent he will use it.

295
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:31,125
For me, it was meant to be.
I was born here, in the region.

296
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:37,000
Very early I was familiar
with orange trees, jasmine, roses, etc.

297
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:40,875
When you get into this job,
you can never leave it.

298
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:43,166
It's purely addictive.

299
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:48,041
September 1st marked the beginning
of my 60th year with Robertet.

300
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,791
It's been quite a while.

301
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,458
You weren't born yet.

302
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:03,250
Oftentimes, perfumers ask me

303
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:08,458
how many rose petals
their product requires.

304
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:15,125
So we tell them we need 700 kilos
of flowers for one kilo of absolute.

305
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,875
There are 350 flowers
in a kilo of flowers,

306
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:25,041
So you multiply the number of roses
by 38, the number of petals per rose,

307
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:28,458
and you have the total number of petals.

308
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:29,500
Here, we are
in the middle of the know-how.

309
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:36,083
If I want to develop
or modify a particular scent,

310
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:41,666
I can go to the factory, it's very close.
I can get there in ten minutes.

311
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:43,666
I can talk to the professionals,

312
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,583
smell the trials
and even do the trials with them.

313
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:49,958
It's an undeniable advantage.

314
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,291
And the whole part
with the zest that you see inside.

315
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:05,083
It smells very nice.

316
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,041
Let's see if I can do it.

317
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:16,666
When you see a bitter orange,
you see the difference immediately.

318
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,333
The bitter orange tree
doesn't have the graft.

319
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:21,833
-The trunk--
-It's very cylindrical.

320
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:25,041
It's cylindrical and it has a few thorns.

321
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:27,916
-Yes.
-That's its wild part.

322
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,375
-So it's only feminine?
-Feminine.

323
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,291
But the skin is different,
look at the zest.

324
00:41:37,416 --> 00:41:39,333
Look at the difference
between the two zests.

325
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:41,208
-Yes.
-It's easy to see.

326
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,583
-Here you go.
-Fantastico.

327
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,583
-It has ribs too.
-The Fantastico also has ribs.

328
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:56,458
It's smaller.

329
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:58,333
-Always.
-Always.

330
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,500
Okay.

331
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:03,333
This one is feminine.
These are the three.

332
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:06,833
-The best one.
-The best one is the Fantastico.

333
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:13,583
It's like a murderer who comes
back to the scene of the crime.

334
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:15,291
It's important to be on the site

335
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:21,083
so you can both smell and feel.

336
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:24,416
Because it's an atmosphere.

337
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:31,166
The atmosphere is part of the product.

338
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:37,916
And coming to Italy
is almost like being home.

339
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,541
We all have an Italian side to us.

340
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:46,125
The food is excellent,
the girls are pretty,

341
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:50,208
everything is nice.
It's all about the colors.

342
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:26,000
We may have to pick them up?

343
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:26,875
Yes.

344
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:30,875
If it warms up, there’re
going to be some anyway.

345
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:33,500
Like an actual harvest, yes.

346
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,833
Yes, this time of the year is reward time.

347
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:46,916
We have worked all year: we pruned,
cared, weeded, and hoed them,

348
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:50,250
and then it’s harvest
time, and that’s the reward.

349
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:52,041
Magic.

350
00:44:52,916 --> 00:44:57,000
It’s a special time,
and it’s luxury farming!

351
00:44:57,291 --> 00:45:00,750
We work in the midst of aromas
and colours.

352
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:03,208
It’s a kind of woman’s thing.

353
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:05,875
-Well, it’s increasingly a woman’s thing.
-Yes.

354
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:10,458
-And how do you treat the land?
-With a lot of respect.

355
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:16,000
Not really organic but trying to go
back to how farming once was using

356
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:18,625
observation, common sense, and trying to

357
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:21,458
-deal with each thing in its own time.
-There...

358
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:26,958
You wouldn’t know, huh? Yes, I know.
You need to come back and see it!

359
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:28,708
-Let's take a little bud.
-A fertile one.

360
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:30,583
Hyper fertile, exactly.

361
00:45:30,666 --> 00:45:32,375
-It's the right term.
-Only this?

362
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:35,791
-Yes, this is the bud.
-So you extract the bud.

363
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:40,875
Yes, this is what ends up growing.

364
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,000
-This is the bud.
-Yes.

365
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:45,416
All the genetic information is in here.

366
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:52,041
-Okay.
-And we insert the little bud.

367
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:58,083
-No way!
-Yes.

368
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:00,000
It must be done for each bush.

369
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:04,791
There are currently
about 20,000 rose bushes here,

370
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:08,750
so we've done this 20,000 times,
plus all the other times.

371
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,416
-You don't do that every year, do you?
-Fortunately, no.

372
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,208
-Just once and it's a centifolia for life.
-So it's good for 15 years.

373
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:17,000
Exactly.

374
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,916
And...

375
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,166
a month later, in August,

376
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:25,083
around August 15th,
our little bud will have grown

377
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:27,791
and we will have a new centifolia.

378
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:34,208
But the rootstock,
the mother plant, is resistant.

379
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:39,208
We weaken the shrub rose

380
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:42,416
-so that it gets the necessary sap.
-It's like surgery.

381
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,333
-And then it grows.
-It's like going to the doctor's.

382
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:48,541
This is why we have this quality
and this resistance.

383
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:50,541
It's essential.

384
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:53,541
It's a lot of handling.

385
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:55,125
Exactly.

386
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:04,916
And this is what it looks like.

387
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,500
You end up with this.

388
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:14,916
In a nearby high school in Antibes,
they have started teaching all this again.

389
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,416
-Nobody knew how to do it anymore.
-I can do it now.

390
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,500
Being able to do it is different
from doing it thousands of times

391
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:27,125
on a big scale and successfully.

392
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:30,041
-That requires years of experience.
-Really?

393
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:35,083
This is the problem with Carole,
she makes everything look easy.

394
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:36,250
-Okay.
-It has to be done.

395
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:43,625
François is like Charlie and his angels.

396
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:48,416
There's the blonde one, the one with
the light brown hair and the brunette.

397
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:55,958
When I met François,
I got to visit the creation lab.

398
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:58,166
It was a dream come true for me.

399
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:03,500
Being able to do this job

400
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,250
and for my work
to be appreciated by someone...

401
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:11,000
Organic agriculture is a difficult job.

402
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:14,750
I barely have any machine, we don't use
pesticides, it's all handmade.

403
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:17,416
And I can see when he comes to the field,

404
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,958
or at least I think
and I hope that he enjoys

405
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:28,750
smelling the product of the ground
directly from the tree or from the bush.

406
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:32,583
So I always enjoy his visits.

407
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:38,958
I have the feeling that he is happy
and therefore that I have done a good job.

408
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:09,958
Here, it's for you.

409
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:19,666
It's a farmer's job,
there is no doubt about it.

410
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:22,666
We work in the field
and we wear boots most of the time.

411
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,875
We don't see flowers
for very long during the year.

412
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:28,750
We see roses for four weeks
and tuberoses for a little longer,

413
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:32,541
but in the end,
the fields are green most of the time.

414
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:33,916
They don't blossom for long.

415
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,083
It's party time when they blossom,
but that doesn't last.

416
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:40,125
It's a real farmer's job.

417
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:43,333
But at the same time,
we work for an industry

418
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:48,250
that, for me,
embodies what makes us humans.

419
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:52,333
We don't work to feed ourselves,
we work to smell good.

420
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:57,125
It's a puzzling idea. It's very special.

421
00:49:57,208 --> 00:50:04,166
And these two worlds coming together
is something I appreciate a lot.

422
00:50:04,291 --> 00:50:09,375
We've got our feet in the mud and our head
I don't know where, maybe in the clouds.

423
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:30,166
Driving tractors is actually
what you like most about your job, right?

424
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,375
Yes.

425
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:48,416
Can you imagine at school,
40 years ago, if I had said,

426
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:52,625
"I want to be a farmer,
I want to live in the countryside"?

427
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:54,958
They would have said,
"Yuk! That's horrible."

428
00:50:55,041 --> 00:51:00,458
Whereas these days, they say,
"That's good, but it will be difficult.

429
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:05,250
You must know the ground,
the circle of life, the earth."

430
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:12,791
We look for our environment and when
we find it, we are like a fish in water,

431
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:18,750
because we are in sync with what's beneath
and above us, with the flow of time,

432
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:25,083
with the rhythm of the seasons, with
the things we do regularly, cyclically.

433
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:32,000
It probably has to do with a sort
of primary and reptilian balance.

434
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,416
Can you help me?

435
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:50,458
How much is there in this? Two kilos?

436
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:55,791
Just to give you an idea,
the iris roots that we plant

437
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:57,625
are planted today.

438
00:51:57,708 --> 00:52:03,166
This is 2018, we have to wait
for three years after planting the roots

439
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,750
before we can unearth them to use them.

440
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:08,833
We have to clean them and trim them.

441
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:13,958
After that, there is only three tons left
out of the four tons we dug up.

442
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:18,666
Once those three tons
are cut and dried up,

443
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:21,291
there is one tone of iris left.

444
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:25,083
But we must wait another two and a half
years for it to be properly dry.

445
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:29,958
Then we treat it,
we grind it and we distill it.

446
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:34,708
And from that ton,
we get about three kilos of butter

447
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:36,833
or 300 grams of irone.

448
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:42,166
So you start with a truck filled
with four tons of fresh roots

449
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:48,125
and seven and a half years later,
you end up with 300 grams of irone.

450
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:51,083
That's why products are very expensive.

451
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,250
You need to be passionate and curious.

452
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:56,750
A perfumer is someone who is curious.

453
00:52:56,875 --> 00:53:00,250
When three people are walking
in the wilderness,

454
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,625
if there is a perfumer,
he is always at the back.

455
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:06,208
He stops everywhere to smell the products,
to touch the plants, etc.

456
00:53:14,666 --> 00:53:19,041
Creators are extremely curious.

457
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:22,833
You must be curious about everything.
About everything and everyone.

458
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:35,291
It is an interpreter's job.

459
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:41,875
We stock up mental pictures
at a certain time

460
00:53:41,958 --> 00:53:45,916
and when we start creating the perfume,

461
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:48,166
all of that comes out.

462
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,125
We need all that.

463
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:01,375
Can we go in and have a drink?
-Sure.

464
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:11,541
He has a passion for well-made products,

465
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:16,291
for beauty and skills, because
you don't become an expert by chance.

466
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:04,791
I suggest we go through the Merlots first

467
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:07,541
-and then we can try the others we have.
-Yes.

468
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:12,916
Because we must match them
with the others.

469
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:17,625
The point of this tasting
is to understand the parcel of land.

470
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:21,791
By tasting the wines regularly
at different stages

471
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:25,833
we get a clearer picture little by little.

472
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:27,958
You're after the 19th.

473
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:31,000
I've tried this one.
I didn't like it much.

474
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:33,791
I like the aromatic
of the 17 and 17.1 a lot.

475
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:35,000
And their characters too.

476
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:37,041
I like this one.

477
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:39,500
It's a little timbered.

478
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:42,708
It brings out its power.

479
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:48,083
Yes, and green pepper
is very present in its bouquet of flavors.

480
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:51,125
-Yes, it's its aggressive side.
-It has pyrazine a side to it.

481
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:52,541
Yes.

482
00:56:56,166 --> 00:57:01,083
I first met François as we were working
together with Cheval Blanc on a book

483
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:06,666
in which we shared our views,
Cheval Blanc's and François Demachy's...

484
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:10,666
on senses, on olfaction,
on the sense of smell.

485
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:15,166
I soon related to his job,

486
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:18,916
because the sense of smell
is part of our daily decisions.

487
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Beyond the emotion,
which is 80% of what we feel...

488
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:26,416
You feel an emotion
when you smell something and taste a wine.

489
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:32,166
The difference between anyone's emotion
and the work of a professional

490
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:37,458
is that we must dissect,
analyze, explain, rank

491
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:39,625
and make decisions based on emotions.

492
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,833
It can be impressive

493
00:57:43,916 --> 00:57:46,500
when you enter the tasting room
of a famous vintage

494
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:49,791
and you start
giving your opinion on the wines.

495
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:58,000
François spontaneously said,
"I like this. This one is a bit grassy."

496
00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:01,125
You can tell he has expertise.

497
00:58:05,625 --> 00:58:07,875
Is there one
you like better than the others?

498
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:10,208
-This one.
-The one on the left.

499
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:14,333
-Me too.
-The other is still too alcoholic for me.

500
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:17,750
In order to remember a precise smell,

501
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:22,375
you must remember
everything that comes with the smell.

502
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:26,250
The moment you smelled it,
what was going on around you,

503
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:29,791
the people who were there,

504
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:33,000
the lighting,
which is important, the sounds, etc.

505
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:36,875
The smell jasmine
definitely reminds me of my grandma.

506
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:38,708
I was always in the field with her.

507
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:42,291
My grandma would put
jasmine flowers in her corset,

508
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:45,458
so she always smelled of jasmine.

509
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:48,250
When I smell jasmine,
it's like there is magic in the air

510
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:52,208
and she is still with me in a way.

511
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:59,291
When I trained my sense of smell
for my first job,

512
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:03,583
the perfumers would make me
smell a lot of raw materials.

513
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:06,833
They said, "You're pretty good."
I thought, "Okay."

514
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:11,250
Then they made me smell a perfume and
I thought, "This the perfume of my life."

515
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:14,583
I had never smelled anything like it.
It was like magic, I loved it.

516
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:18,500
I went home and I told my mom,

517
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:22,291
"You don't know this, it's an old perfume
you've never heard of."

518
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:26,791
My mom would wear Diorissimo
and nothing else.

519
00:59:26,875 --> 00:59:29,458
I said, "Smell this."
She said, "What is it?"

520
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:32,583
I made her smell it and she said,
"I know it, it's Jolie Madame."

521
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:34,333
I asked, "How do you know it?"

522
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:37,083
"It's the perfume I wore
when I was pregnant with you."

523
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:41,291
I think the smells
that have affected me the most

524
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:45,958
are horrible smells
that bring back bad memories.

525
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:51,083
The most violent and painful one for me

526
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:57,041
is the smell of my preschool's bathroom.

527
00:59:57,125 --> 01:00:02,791
I sometimes smell it
in public places like hospitals

528
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:06,250
and as soon as I smell it,
I am three again

529
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:09,791
and I feel excruciatingly sad,
it's terrible.

530
01:00:09,875 --> 01:00:12,583
I can picture
my schoolteacher's green trouser.

531
01:00:12,666 --> 01:00:15,916
That's it. It's horrible.

532
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,166
When you are faced with the memory
or the reality of a smell

533
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:23,416
that you haven't smelled in 30 years,

534
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:27,125
you are immediately brought back
30 years in the past.

535
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:31,791
It's... instantaneous.

536
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:34,541
It's very accurate.

537
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:57,000
It's the inside you need to smell.

538
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:09,958
He associates pictures

539
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,375
and situations with perfumes.

540
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:17,666
He creates a photo library for himself

541
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,208
that he associates with smells.

542
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:26,458
It's available to him in his brain so that
he can associate a picture with a smell.

543
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:31,541
-Can you use ginger for perfumes?
-Yes, we use it.

544
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:34,208
We have two main products;

545
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:37,708
the essence,
after distillation,

546
01:01:37,791 --> 01:01:43,791
and a CO2 extraction which brings out
the smell of fresh ginger like this.

547
01:01:44,916 --> 01:01:50,916
For example, if you ask him
about a perfume that inspires to travel,

548
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:57,458
he goes through his travels photo library
and the smells associated with it

549
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:04,291
and he can come up
with about 2,000 raw materials.

550
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:06,000
It's unbelievable.

551
01:02:58,416 --> 01:02:59,625
This is great.

552
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:02,166
You can trust me.

553
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:14,833
In perfumery, the hardest thing
is usually to decide

554
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:15,708
when the perfume is ready.

555
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:16,791
When is it done?

556
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:19,916
When is the song perfectly played?

557
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,041
"Okay, it's done,
let's stop and save it."

558
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:28,958
I understand François completely
when he thinks, "No, let's do it again.

559
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:31,125
Let's start again and adjust it."

560
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:37,000
And you can never just add something
like a flower on a salad.

561
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:40,250
It doesn't work like that.
Everything shifts, the whole formula.

562
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:43,958
Anytime you pull out a brick,
the whole Jenga tower is affected.

563
01:04:44,666 --> 01:04:47,375
It's endless
and it can become and obsession.

564
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:51,291
We're all sensitive to smells,

565
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:54,708
because they bring us back to our culture,

566
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:56,041
it's an identity.

567
01:04:57,083 --> 01:05:00,000
It even goes beyond that,
it's what we are made of.

568
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:02,166
The human side is essential.

569
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:07,000
It's the most important part for perfumes.

570
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:09,875
What is more human than a smell?

571
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:31,500
Our joker is missing today.

572
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,500
There isn't much left.
We're nearing the end.

573
01:05:45,416 --> 01:05:46,916
It makes me sad.

574
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:51,708
Orange blossoms don't last very long.

575
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,458
When we see there aren't many buds left,

576
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:59,458
we know it's only
a matter of days before the end.

577
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:02,416
We'll have to wait until next year again.

578
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:29,333
No, Georges!

579
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:42,041
To this day,

580
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:45,333
I still think
it was pretty bold of him to bank on us,

581
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:50,000
because it wasn't our job,
we were just starting.

582
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:53,625
And yet he agreed to work with us.

583
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:56,041
I think it's...

584
01:06:56,125 --> 01:07:01,291
It's cool of course that a House,
since he represents a brand,

585
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:08,208
that a House like his would make
that bet and trust in people like us.

586
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:31,375
Perfume is about human relationship.

587
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:34,833
There is always a human connection.

588
01:07:34,916 --> 01:07:39,083
To me, Perfume is in its essence...

589
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:42,750
...a human journey.

590
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:11,208
Inherently, flowers are sexual organs.

591
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:15,750
That always plays a part.
We are mammals so...

592
01:09:15,916 --> 01:09:17,750
It's not far from the topic of sex.

593
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:21,125
And that makes us dream,
so that's how it is.

594
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:15,416
Does being a perfumer help with women?

595
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,708
Yes.

596
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:21,958
It might be one of the reasons
I chose this job.

597
01:11:22,041 --> 01:11:22,875
Maybe that's why.
