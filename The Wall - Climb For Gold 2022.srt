3
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,480
I think that all the life experiences that people have...

4
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,240
I experience it all through climbing

5
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,360
There are times...

6
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,640
I just give up

7
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,480
So, we can start now

8
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,120
Can I do it?

9
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,800
Yes, go on

10
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,960
Wow!

11
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,880
Turn, turn, turn so it doesn't stick

12
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,320
It's easier if you turn it on the worktop?

13
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,880
Yeah

14
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,920
Enjoy!

15
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,440
And to you

16
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,800
This haircut is on point!

17
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,960
I remember that

18
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,360
It was fashionable

19
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,960
Why don't you wear it like that now?

20
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,760
Janja was already dancing here

21
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,360
I was dancing here

22
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,040
She was very active

23
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,800
We really thought we should put her in some sports club...

24
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,560
so that she would get tired during the day...

25
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,880
so we could have some peace and quiet in the evening

26
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,440
Twice per week dancing lessons

27
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,680
And twice per week climbing lessons

28
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,040
The climbing began to overlap with her dancing classes

29
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
My wife asked her

30
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,560
"Janja, now you have to decide what
you are going to continue with"

31
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,880
"Climbing or dancing?"

32
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,480
"You need to decide"

33
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,560
We bought second-hand climbing shoes for starters

34
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,560
What about the belt?

35
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,240
That too

36
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,360
Go Janja!

37
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,240
Even as a little girl, Janja was very strong...

38
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,960
showing her incredible strength

39
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,400
Before soccer on national TV...

40
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,880
Janja is like superhero!

41
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,920
Come on, you alright?

42
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,040
Doesn't matter though

43
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,000
No matter what, you know, all this shit...

44
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,680
we'll just work through it

45
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,920
Let’s go. Go! Go!

46
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,120
Ever since I started climbing...

47
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
my goal has been...

48
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,200
to become the strongest climber in the world

49
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,600
That's what I was seeking...

50
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,680
and I still am

51
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,760
I want to not only become strong as a climber,
but also strong as a person

52
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,280
I’ve found an incident described on a page here...

53
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,760
where Miho was angry

54
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,280
We found her cute because she is the youngest

55
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,840
Even when she was angry, she was cute

56
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,200
So we were looking at her and smiling, her sisters and I

57
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,560
But Miho didn’t like it at all and was angry

58
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,080
Even then, she didn’t like losing

59
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,600
She never wanted to be defeated by her older sisters

60
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,120
But of course, it was impossible to imagine how far I could go

61
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,000
I only had this unfounded self-confidence
that I would somehow be ok...

62
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,120
that I would become strong

63
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,200
I just believed that

64
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,520
You're my sugar

65
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,560
Yeah, look at you

66
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,760
There you go, Brookie-poo

67
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,640
The achievement, it's so big

68
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,520
We are on the moon and back, and moon and back...

69
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,440
and moon and back

70
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,200
Can I climb here?

71
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:37,800
Yeah

72
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,160
Thank you

73
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,000
Enjoy your day

74
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,720
Same to you

75
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,880
I'm sad

76
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,040
This is stylish, don't you think?

77
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,840
She never wants to see herself losing

78
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,920
That state of mind...

79
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,400
is what has allowed her to reach her current performance level

80
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,720
In 2018 Boulder World Cup, she was the overall champion

81
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,600
I think that was an important moment for her

82
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,640
My own country is hosting the Olympic Games...

83
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,800
so I am really looking forward to it

84
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,080
Being from Tokyo, a climber

85
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,840
Being in a position to aim for a medal there...

86
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,480
is really a miracle

87
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,880
I want to do it now

88
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,240
I feel that I really want to use the energy...

89
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,600
that's been building up inside me

90
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,840
- Dear viewers of S/
- PARK!

91
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,440
I’ve been selected for the Olympic Games

92
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,080
As I have been until now...

93
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,040
I will continue working hard

94
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,480
I want to do great things for Japan

95
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,480
Many people have been rooting for me

96
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,840
I want to prove myself worthy of that

97
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,680
I have a responsibility. I really do

98
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,600
Because I’ve been chosen, I have to do it

99
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,120
Keeping that in mind, I will practise diligently

100
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,600
I realised after the announcement was over

101
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,680
I realise now that I was at my wit’s end

102
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,880
Look at this

103
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,800
This cut was really bad yesterday, but look at it today

104
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,760
Look how quickly I heal

105
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,760
Really deep cuts, too

106
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,720
We've been trying to learn how to fit a carpet ourselves...

107
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,520
and I'm just tucking it all the way in on the edges...

108
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,040
It's weirdly satisfying, but kind of
frustrating at the same time

109
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,440
I always drink carbonated water

110
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:02,320
I go to the fridge and there isn't any

111
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,600
But now, even such a small thing can make me feel irritated

112
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,600
I just live as usual, but when
something happens...

113
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,120
suddenly everything seems impossible

114
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:25,960
There are times I just give up

115
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,960
But you have to survive

116
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,840
It might sound like an exaggeration...

117
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,520
but all kinds of pressure...

118
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,560
I was suppressing inside

119
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,840
Oh, my back's sore!

120
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,320
They did the first epidural...

121
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,400
Go, go, go

122
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,520
Come on, come on. You can do it!

123
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,440
Come on, hold it!

124
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,520
Yeah, like this. Keep going, keep going!

125
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,800
It's like I'm climbing stupidly

126
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,080
Stupidly, yeah. Weirdly

127
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,160
Yeah, well...

128
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,040
Damn it!

129
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,800
I knew it! You won't help yourself on purpose

130
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,960
What the fuck?

131
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,280
I'm moving away

132
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,160
It's pointless to keep doing this because I keep moving away

133
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,720
Yes, I can see

134
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,440
What now?

135
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,440
I can't

136
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,480
Quiet!

137
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:50,360
Look, can I just say one thing?

138
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:55,440
You came here and said, "I can't",
and you started getting nervous

139
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,920
What if you just turned a little?

140
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,720
That's what I couldn't do

141
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,800
Could you at least try?

142
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:02,880
No

143
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,040
Without saying, “I can’t”

144
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,960
So how the fuck am I supposed to
turn my leg from this position?

145
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,560
This is how

146
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,360
How?

147
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,640
The same way you just did

148
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:13,320
But I can't

149
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,200
Come on

150
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,680
I'm exhausted

151
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,040
Because you don't calm yourself down

152
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,160
Because you don't just take a breath. Just that. Take a breath

153
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,400
If you pull through it you can do it

154
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,240
But you have to believe

155
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,360
If you are not all in...

156
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,800
even if you are Janja, it's not possible to win

157
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,680
Hey, I think your phone fell on the floor

158
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,760
When you sit down to watch her in the Olympics...

159
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,040
how are you going to feel?

160
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,600
How shall I put it?

161
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,440
The bigger the scale of the event...

162
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,680
the more tense I become

163
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,960
She was not the kind of child...

164
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,040
to show her emotions

165
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,920
I think because she is competitive

166
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,600
She would keep saying that she wanted to get stronger

167
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:10,400
I think I can be proud of her strong mindset

168
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,880
I feel tension

169
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:34,080
In my training and in my everyday life, I feel it constantly

170
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,320
But when it comes to the competition...

171
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:42,560
because I am prepared to give it my all, the anxiety is gone

172
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,840
Just you wait

173
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,000
The person in the photo is Miho’s grandfather. Her Grandpa

174
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,280
He was really looking forward to the Olympic Games, but...

175
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:43,080
he died one month before the World Championships started

176
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,880
He’s watching over her

177
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,800
Miho too wanted to show [the Olympics] to him

178
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,000
She said, "Let’s take him with us"

179
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,120
But this morning she was saying...

180
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,240
"Grandpa may be in the stadium already"

181
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,200
Yes!

182
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,720
I can already breathe a little easier

183
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:33,920
Oh, I knew it!

184
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,280
She slipped

185
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,480
I knew that she would slip

186
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,360
Oh damn

187
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,360
Janja is anxious

188
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,000
You lost your speech, didn’t you?

189
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:26,680
Unbelievable

190
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:28,960
She wasn't careful enough

191
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:37,880
I can't relax

192
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,000
No

193
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,240
There's no going back

194
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,880
Climbing is about to start, please...

195
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,440
Do it!

196
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,960
Amazing! Amazing!

197
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,640
So happy

198
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,680
Well done, well done

199
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:05,360
There were many difficult times and moments...

200
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:10,680
when I thought I would give up, when I felt disheartened

201
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:18,040
What I realised by winning the medal...

202
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:23,760
it really made me stronger

203
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:34,000
The value of every day's experience on this journey...

204
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:39,400
I think it’s greater than the value of the medal
