1
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,270
What? Oh, come on!

2
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,011
Thank you.

3
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,939
Oh, shit! Oh, fuck!

4
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,913
Fucking Alaska.

5
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,790
Get down! On your knees now!
Get down!

6
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,192
Okay. okay.

7
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:06,126
Okay. Yep. Oh, shit!

8
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,528
Oh, come on, Princess.

9
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:10,464
I'm cooperating.
I'm cooperating, okay?

10
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,765
Clear!

11
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,968
Gotcha.

12
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,704
Hey there, Winston.
How you been?

13
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:17,771
What?

14
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,274
I'm Madolyn Harris,
US Marshal.

15
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,575
You're a hard man
to track down.

16
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,977
A deal! I want to make a deal.

17
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,247
Let's make a deal.

18
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,216
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

19
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:30,584
It's chicken noodle.

20
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,920
Throw him on the bed.

21
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:35,789
Oh, not the bedspread.

22
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,758
Not the bedspread.
It's crusty.

23
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,229
It's so... crusty.

24
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,163
Winston, you want
to make a deal?

25
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,598
Testify against Moretti.

26
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,437
Okay.

27
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,039
But I want full immunity
and lots...

28
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,342
and lots of protection.

29
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,846
All right.
Let me call it up the chain.

30
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,113
Okay.

31
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:08,155
It's Harris.
Yup. Clean capture.

32
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,023
Listen, he wants
to make a deal.

33
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,193
Uh-huh.

34
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:16,096
Copy that. Keep me posted.

35
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,365
What'd they say?

36
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,368
Get comfy. This could take
a couple of days.

37
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:26,674
Hey, uh, I don't want
to be that guy, but...

38
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:31,612
I have to use the facilities.

39
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,981
Oh, come on,
don't look at me like that.

40
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,550
These guys literally scared
the shit out of me.

41
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:38,051
What do you expect?

42
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,028
Can I have some privacy?

43
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:49,897
You might run.

44
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,599
Okay.

45
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,136
But if you don't
take off these cuffs,

46
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,406
you're the one that's gonna
have to do the paperwork.

47
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,543
Hey, Bob, Jeff.

48
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,178
Yes, ma'am.

49
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,814
I have a job for you.

50
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,884
* I wanna know who *

51
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,422
* Who was that awhile ago *

52
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,526
* I wanna know who *

53
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,530
* Who was that awhile ago *

54
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,800
* You see, when I came in *

55
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,471
* Somebody ran
out of my back door *

56
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,876
* Had his shoes
in his pocket *

57
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,111
* Overcoat in his hand *

58
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,947
* Tell me, baby *

59
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,048
* Who was that man *

60
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,450
* I wanna know who *

61
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,986
* Who was that awhile ago*

62
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:50,591
Get in.

63
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,526
What the hell is this?

64
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,495
The charter, Winston. Get in.

65
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,663
Okay.

66
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,531
It's just you say,

67
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:58,799
"We chartered
a private plane,"

68
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,134
I'm thinking Gulfstream,
thinking Learjet,

69
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:04,472
you know, Jay-Z level shit.

70
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,239
Thought we'd be popping
bottles full of bubbly.

71
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:09,109
Not fucking Dramamine.

72
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,579
That's a jet.
I never said jet.

73
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,814
I said we got a private plane,
and that's what this is.

74
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,215
- No.
- Arms.

75
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,118
This isn't a plane.
This is a kite with seatbelts.

76
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,654
Honestly, I'd rather be
on Spirit Airlines.

77
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:23,123
Well, Winston, what do you
want me to say?

78
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,427
Next time, hide out in Miami,
maybe you get a jet.

79
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,829
You go full Unabomber on me,

80
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,665
drag me all the way
out to snow-blow Alaska,

81
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,001
our options get
a little more limited.

82
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,069
Doubt you can even
land a jet out here.

83
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:39,473
Yeah, well, it's a little hard
to go off the grid in Miami.

84
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,642
Yeah, and a lot of good
that did you.

85
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,490
You guys go ahead.
I'll be there in a second.

86
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,191
- Van Sant.
- It's Madolyn.

87
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,760
I was starting
to get worried.

88
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,929
Don't be.
We're just about good to go.

89
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,196
Is he cooperating?

90
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,932
- If I say no, can I tase him?
- Sure.

91
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,467
I'm right here.
I can hear you.

92
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,202
Three days in Motel Sucks.
He hasn't shut up once.

93
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,839
Oh, come on.
You loved every minute of it.

94
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,841
Don't tell me you miss being
behind a desk.

95
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,711
No. No. Seriously, Caroline.

96
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:20,481
Thank you for putting me
in the field again.

97
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:21,949
I know you have pushback.

98
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,351
Don't thank me yet.
Judge Martin recused himself.

99
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,620
I'll give you three guesses
who's on deck.

100
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:28,622
Stewardess, is there
a meal on this flight

101
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:29,957
or is it like just snacks?

102
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,024
Shut up, Winston.

103
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,493
Yeah, okay. Just snacks. Okay.

104
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,828
- You there?
- Uh, yeah. Replace with who?

105
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,030
- Judge hard-ass himself.
- Falco?

106
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,466
Yeah, I know.
And true to form,

107
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,200
he's not letting us
push the trial date again.

108
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,670
- You're kidding.
- Look, it's gonna be fine.

109
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:45,238
The team's standing by
to meet you in Anchorage.

110
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,440
Okay.

111
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:47,808
We'll be there in about...

112
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,244
We should be there
in about 90 minutes or so.

113
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,846
- Where'd he go?
- Good.

114
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,882
Moretti's lawyers are trying
to run out the clock on us,

115
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,249
but I've done the math.

116
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,985
We could still make New York
by morning, okay?

117
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,753
- Just get going.
- Yeah.

118
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,221
All right.
Call me from Anchorage.

119
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,323
By the book, okay?
Don't embarrass us.

120
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,525
- I gotta run.

121
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,496
So, any inflight entertainment

122
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,397
or do you know party tricks?

123
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,900
Deputy Harris? Daryl Booth.

124
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,040
Hope you like flying.
Beautiful day for it.

125
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,877
I gotta say, I normally

126
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,713
don't let my passengers
board before me.

127
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,314
It's for your own safety.

128
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,084
Ooh! No kidding?

129
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,419
What you packing there,
a Glock or...

130
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,921
We're in a bit
of a rush, Mr. Booth.

131
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,222
Yes, ma'am.

132
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:44,665
You sure you don't wanna ride
in the back there with him?

133
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,200
Absolutely not.

134
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,970
Yeah, it's just tough with
all the sexual tension.

135
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,438
I only meant, uh...

136
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,106
shouldn't somebody
be watching him?

137
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,274
Oh, he's restrained,
Mr. Booth.

138
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,076
He's not going anywhere.
Trust me.

139
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,746
Okay. Hey, you're the boss.
I just...

140
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,014
I never flew
a fugitive before.

141
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,216
Witness.

142
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,785
- What?
- Shut up, Winston.

143
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,654
I'm a cooperating
government witness,

144
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,055
- not a fugitive.
- Winston.

145
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,156
No, I'm just saying,

146
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,891
technically, we're all
on the same side.

147
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,125
Not another word.

148
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,261
All right, well,

149
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,263
we're looking at moderate
clouds and light wind.

150
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,632
And I'd appreciate if you
didn't address the prisoner.

151
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,134
Yes, ma'am.

152
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,672
Sorry, I just...

153
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,007
I never flew
a US Marshal before, neither.

154
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,276
I did fly
Marshall Faulk once, though.

155
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,377
That was real cool.

156
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,816
All right. Anchorage Center,

157
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,018
November 208,
uniform, uniform.

158
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:41,021
Ready for departure on
Crooked Creek, runway 34.

159
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,859
Roger that. November 208,
uniform, uniform.

160
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:48,528
Clear for takeoff, runway 34.

161
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,297
- Ready to go?
- Yup.

162
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:52,733
Whee...

163
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:17,417
Is it always this bumpy?

164
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:29,096
* How does it feel *

165
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,399
* To treat me like you do *

166
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,702
* When you've laid
your hands upon me *

167
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,169
You're not
digging the music?

168
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,307
Yeah, I know. But up here,
you got to have some tunes

169
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,175
to drown out the wind
and the wolves.

170
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:46,880
See? She gets it.

171
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,116
It's always turbulent up here.

172
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,085
It should even out
once we hit about 3,000 feet.

173
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,787
If you feel sick, don't worry.

174
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:54,988
You know,
the number of passengers

175
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,156
have left their lunch up here?

176
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,825
-Hello?
- I could open a snack bar.

177
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,593
Hello? Hello!

178
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,629
Can you guys even hear me?

179
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,632
What if I need to take a piss?

180
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,367
You a smoker?

181
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,337
- No, I quit.
- I'll take one.

182
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,472
Yeah, it ain't the same, huh?

183
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,611
Your neck okay?

184
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,015
- You got a scratch there.
- Oh.

185
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,384
Maintenance.
Occupational hazard.

186
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,859
Come on. Oh, come on.

187
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,796
- Why is he in chains?
- Come on!

188
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,466
He said he was a witness.
Why is he all chained up?

189
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,001
Because he's a flight risk.

190
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,970
I thought he said you two
were on the same side.

191
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:44,637
He's a liar.

192
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,574
What'd he do?

193
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,211
Okay. Forget I asked.

194
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:52,980
You gotta understand

195
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,015
my usual haul
is a drunken fishing party

196
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,550
or a bunch of suits trying
to experience true nature.

197
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:00,653
Golly gee,
I'm just a local yokel pilot.

198
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,790
I sure never seen a girl

199
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:04,724
as purdy as you
from the big city.

200
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,393
You been flying long?

201
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,062
Yeah, my dad
is a crop duster in Texas.

202
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,730
I got DDT in my blood.

203
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:14,968
Well, thank you.
I'm very uptight, controlling.

204
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,970
I'd love to be
in a relationship with you

205
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,305
so I could
completely control...

206
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,007
Well, that would work
just fine for me.

207
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,175
If we were cousins,
we'd already be married.

208
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,244
I came up here
doing summer charters

209
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,046
maybe 15 years ago.

210
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:27,680
Never left.

211
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,683
I'm rambling. Sorry.

212
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:33,586
My ex always said
I talk too much. I'm sorry.

213
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,223
Beautiful, ain't it?

214
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:37,891
That, it is.

215
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:42,195
Yeah,
you getting used to it.

216
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,340
Oh, hell.

217
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,575
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

218
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,777
Nothing to worry about.

219
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,279
This piece of crap
keeps shorting out on me.

220
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,380
There's no GPS?

221
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,614
It's no big deal, really.

222
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,551
I mean,
it happens twice a week.

223
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,287
It's not serious.
I fly this route all the time.

224
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,623
75 minutes from now,
we'll be on the ground,

225
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,759
and you and your friend
or witness,

226
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,462
be on your way to Seattle,
I promise.

227
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,864
You don't think
we should turn back?

228
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:19,933
No, heck no.
I mean, it's your call.

229
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,401
I mean, I get paid either way.

230
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,436
There's some weather
moving in from the north.

231
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,704
We head back now,

232
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,306
it's probably gonna ground us
for a few hours.

233
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,108
75 minutes.

234
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,409
I know the way.
I'm gonna get you there.

235
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,999
How long you been
with the Marshals?

236
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,602
Uh, seven, almost eight years.

237
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,640
- You like it?
- It has its moments.

238
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,342
Whoa! What the shit was that?

239
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,012
We're all good.

240
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,780
- Sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

241
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,483
Bird strike is all.
Not a big deal.

242
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,452
Unless you the bird.

243
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,155
Yeah. I better
get a little higher

244
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,324
in case there's more.

245
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,027
Well, can't go too high
or I'll pass out.

246
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,534
- You good?
- Is the plane...

247
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,069
Ah, the plane's fine.

248
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:31,504
I'm gonna have
to spend my evening

249
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,973
scrubbing blood off of it,

250
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,008
but could have been worse.
Could have been a prop chop.

251
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,310
I'd be picking feathers
out of the intakes all week.

252
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,795
Look at her. Ain't she great?

253
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,297
Dancing for
your entertainment.

254
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,166
Oh, come on now.
She's resilient.

255
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,535
Yeah, I know.

256
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,104
Look at me with them
ten dollar words, right?

257
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:06,873
Don't tell nobody.

258
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,141
But the fact is,

259
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:09,542
she just keeps dancing
through all the bumps

260
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,980
and turns and turbulence.
Nothing fazes her.

261
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,948
Gotta admire a gal like that.

262
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,192
Oh, shit.

263
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,464
Hey. Hey! Hey!

264
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,933
Can you hear me?

265
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,769
Oh, Christ. Uh...

266
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,272
Uh...

267
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,209
Oh, what do I do? Um...

268
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,756
- Hey!
- What was that?

269
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,259
- I... I need to talk to you.
- What?

270
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,794
Uh, I...
I dropped something...

271
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:07,534
Uh, on the floor by my...
by my foot.

272
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,536
- You'll deal.
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

273
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,538
I... I also don't feel well.

274
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,540
I don't care, Winston.
Suck it up.

275
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,808
No, it's like I feel
really bad.

276
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:18,578
Like I got a bad feeling.

277
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,614
I think we should turn around.

278
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,383
Just take some
deep breaths, Winston.

279
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,784
You'll be fine.

280
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,487
- What's wrong with him?
- Says he feels sick.

281
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,656
Oh, shit.

282
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,397
Here.

283
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,998
Try to keep it in the bag.

284
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:42,835
Okay.

285
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,111
What'd I tell you?
One on every flight.

286
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,347
What's our ETA?

287
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,551
About an hour-ish. Soon.

288
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,091
When are we gonna see
civilization again?

289
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:08,161
Oof. Around these parts?
Not until final approach.

290
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,150
How'd you know about Seattle?

291
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,320
- What?
- Earlier.

292
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,122
You said you'd have us
on our way to Seattle

293
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,356
before we knew it.

294
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,857
How'd you know
that's where we're headed?

295
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,360
Well, shit.
Where else can you go?

296
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,330
You ain't no Alaskan.
I can tell you that.

297
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:46,399
Ain't no way you're staying
in Anchorage. No offense.

298
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,869
In fact, if I had to guess,

299
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,604
I'd say you got that
Yankee blood.

300
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,407
Not much of an accent, but...

301
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:56,543
you remind me of this gal
I used to fiddle with.

302
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,881
Can I radio ATC on these?
I need to check in.

303
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,483
- Already?
- Protocol.

304
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:04,784
Yeah. All right. Sure.

305
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:07,854
Anchorage Center,

306
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,989
November 208,
uniform, uniform.

307
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,158
Come in.

308
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,726
Come in, Anchorage Center.

309
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,429
This is November 208,
uniform, uniform. Over.

310
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,266
- Anchorage Center?
- Nothing?

311
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:23,102
Must be the, uh, mountains
blocking the signal.

312
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,804
Should be fine
in another few minutes.

313
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:45,792
Oh, fuck.

314
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,243
Kinda spooky, huh?

315
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:06,913
Local pilots call this
Eskimo soup.

316
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:13,253
The flying community up here
must be a pretty small group.

317
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,721
Mm.

318
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,823
You must know the pilot
who flew me up here last week.

319
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,391
Uh, Jani... Janikowski?

320
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:22,429
Janikowski?
Oh, sure. Great guy.

321
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,897
Man, one time up in Nome,
he and I got our hands on

322
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,799
some nitrous
and a welding torch.

323
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,502
Well, like I said, great guy.

324
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,705
Yeah. Seemed like it.

325
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,408
Except she's a woman.

326
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,477
Hmm. Oh, you mean his sister.

327
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,446
And believe me,

328
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,180
I could tell you
some stories about her, too.

329
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,953
Well, you're not really
buying that, now are you?

330
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,157
I knew you were gonna be fun.

331
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,497
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't shoot him! We need him!

332
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:04,737
Oh, shit!

333
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,374
Yeah. Yeah.

334
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:09,376
He's got a knife!

335
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,680
Easy now.
I don't wanna kill ya.

336
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,448
A cold body isn't any fun.

337
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:20,887
What the...

338
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,196
I love it when
they play hard to get.

339
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,864
Yeah. You wanna play rough?

340
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,567
Ruff, ruff.

341
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,903
Oh, yeah.
You're gonna be a party, huh?

342
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,305
Yeah.

343
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:41,040
Oh, shit! Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit! Oh, fuck! Oh, shit!

344
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,743
Hey, shut the fuck up!

345
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,652
Mr. Moretti is very
disappointed in you, Winston,

346
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,053
and he wants you dead.

347
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,555
I haven't told them anything.
I didn't say one word.

348
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,689
I swear to God.
I didn't say one word.

349
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:57,924
I know. Winston, stop. Stop.

350
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,492
Stop. I know.

351
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:01,093
I know, man.
You haven't said a word.

352
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:04,230
- I didn't say anything.
- Yeah. And now you never will.

353
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,666
Uh... I can pay you.

354
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:07,734
Come on, brother.

355
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:08,901
Have a little self-respect,
will you?

356
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:12,339
I'm serious.
A million dollars in crypto.

357
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:15,041
Completely untraceable.
You gotta let me go.

358
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,209
Do I look like the kind of guy
who deals in fucking crypto?

359
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,512
Fine. Then, uh, cash.

360
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,047
Whatever.
Hell, what does it matter?

361
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,949
We're talking about
a million dollars here.

362
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,452
Oh, yeah? You got all that
just squirreled away, huh?

363
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:29,356
I was Moretti's accountant,
so, yeah, I skimmed.

364
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:32,459
A million dollars?
You got some fucking balls.

365
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:33,560
Do you have any idea

366
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:35,428
how much money
I hid for that man?

367
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,464
'Cause he sure doesn't.

368
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,399
You wouldn't believe
how many people got a taste.

369
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,033
This one guy
in Sankaty, Massachusetts

370
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,603
got $25,000 a month,
for years.

371
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:47,774
All you have to do
is just let me walk away.

372
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,411
- That's it, huh?
- That's it.

373
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,646
Look,
what was your plan?

374
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,315
You were gonna fly us
to some abandoned airstrip

375
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:57,650
and leave us for the wolves?

376
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,853
No. Bears more likely.

377
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:02,789
This time of year.

378
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,325
And only after
we've had our fun.

379
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,528
You get the picture?

380
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,601
Okay. But here's the thing.

381
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:19,472
Who's gonna know? Right?

382
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,442
I mean,
I will disappear forever.

383
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:23,810
You get to say
you did your job,

384
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,746
plus you get a million
extra bucks in your pocket.

385
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,448
It's a win-win.

386
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:29,516
Wow.

387
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,784
And her?

388
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,488
What about her?

389
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,532
Look at her.

390
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,201
If you walk away,
she's still gonna die.

391
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,139
And then she's gonna die
because of you.

392
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,908
Oh, you have it in you, huh?
To cut her loose?

393
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,110
Just like that?

394
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,579
Oh, you didn't need those,
did you?

395
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:02,048
Not anymore.

396
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,750
You still look like a pussy.

397
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:08,120
You know what the difference
between me and you is, Twig?

398
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:10,389
I don't know.
A million dollars?

399
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:11,491
Ah!

400
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,059
Fuck! Oh, my God!

401
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,727
Have some fucking decorum,
you hear me?

402
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:15,962
I'm trying to have
a nice time.

403
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,697
Don't you dare
fucking disrupt that.

404
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,831
I hear you. I hear you.

405
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,800
I do this for fun.
I do this for free.

406
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,902
Titty twister. You like that?

407
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:25,104
- We're gonna have fun.
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

408
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,044
Hey.

409
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,715
* How does it feel *

410
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:36,816
Get up. You gotta wake up.

411
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,217
* To treat me like you do *

412
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,386
If you hear me right now,
you gotta wake up right now.

413
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,755
* When you've laid
your hands upon me*

414
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:43,856
* And you... *

415
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,703
- What the...
- You okay?

416
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,538
Winston.

417
00:23:58,571 --> 00:23:59,839
There's no air.

418
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,240
- There's no air in here.
- Yes, there is.

419
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,675
You gotta let me out of this.
You gotta let me out.

420
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:04,410
- I can't do that, Winston.
- But there's no air...

421
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,745
- in here.
- Yes, there is.

422
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,114
It is way worse
getting raped by a bald guy!

423
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:10,216
- No one's raping you.
- Oh, you wanna bet?

424
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,918
Did you see
where the knife went?

425
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,632
Oh, God!

426
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:27,934
Oh, my God!
This is how it ends?

427
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:28,968
This is how it ends for me?

428
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,040
We're all gonna die!

429
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:35,374
Oh, God, please!

430
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,076
Please, I'll be good.
I'll be a priest and shit.

431
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,391
Get him off!
Get him off of you.

432
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,459
Come on, you can do it!

433
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,399
Get up!

434
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,434
Turn around.
You gotta pull on the things!

435
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,036
Pull on the... Pull up!

436
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,172
Oh my... Ah!

437
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,213
Oh, shit.

438
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,054
Okay.

439
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,720
Winston.

440
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,122
Are you okay?

441
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,893
Winston!

442
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:38,564
No! I'm not okay.

443
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,433
I pissed myself.

444
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,376
What are we supposed to do?

445
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,111
Just let me think
for a second.

446
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,924
- What are you looking for?
- The knife.

447
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,192
I need to get these off.

448
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,960
- Hey!
- What?

449
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,328
The first aid kit.

450
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,544
Fuck.

451
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,747
Come on. I can help.
Just unlock me.

452
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,481
- Not a chance.
- Really?

453
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:30,783
What do you think
I'm gonna do?

454
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:31,818
Attack the pilot?

455
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:36,522
Fine.

456
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,627
- Easy.
- You know what?

457
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,362
You got trust issues, lady.

458
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,432
I got it. I got it.

459
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,200
Thank you.

460
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,739
Okay. That wasn't
so hard, was it?

461
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:55,107
We need to get him into
the back before he wakes up.

462
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:56,943
Oh, fuck that. Shoot him.

463
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,144
He was gonna
fly into the wilderness

464
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,578
and murder the shit out of us.

465
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,248
Nobody's killing anybody.
Besides, we might need him.

466
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,515
For what?

467
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,284
You know how to fly a plane?

468
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,418
Oh, he's as sure as shit

469
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:07,686
not gonna tell us
how to do it.

470
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,358
Oh, come on.

471
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,330
Son of a bitch.

472
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:20,366
Need some help?

473
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,571
Damn it.

474
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,179
Thank you.

475
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:35,948
Now, do my cuffs.

476
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:37,249
You can still move in those.

477
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,219
- Fuck.
- Come on.

478
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,693
All right.
No sudden movements.

479
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,962
Me? It's not my fault
we're in this position.

480
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:51,663
Just pull.

481
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,500
Come on. Yeah.

482
00:28:57,937 --> 00:28:59,105
Hold on.

483
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:05,211
Come on.

484
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,947
What are you doing down there?
Giving this guy a pedicure?

485
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,216
Fuck.

486
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:12,919
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

487
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:17,256
God, I knew something
was off about this guy

488
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,424
from the minute
he got in here,

489
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:19,691
with those redneck platitudes

490
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,994
and that bullshit
Larry the Cable Guy accent.

491
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:24,430
Winston, I swear to God,
if you don't shut up...

492
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,335
- What?
- Nothing.

493
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:30,536
Bullshit nothing. Show me.

494
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,005
We need to move him.

495
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,273
Not until you show me.

496
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:37,944
Fine.

497
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:43,615
Oh. I guess someone
did his homework.

498
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,218
Oh, they got pictures of you.

499
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,754
Oh, they got a picture of me.

500
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,490
Wait. Wait a second.

501
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,793
This is my mom's house.

502
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:57,363
- Winston.
- Oh, my God. They could...

503
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:58,931
They could hurt her.
They could kill her.

504
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:00,066
We gotta warn her.

505
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,300
We gotta call her
and warn her.

506
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,535
Winston. Winston. Focus.

507
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:05,271
We can't solve anything
until we get help.

508
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,372
And we can't get help

509
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:07,673
until we move him
into the back, okay?

510
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,408
- Okay.
- Okay.

511
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:18,317
Okay. Okay. Sit him up.

512
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:20,419
Yeah.

513
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,495
- Come on. Really?
- For him.

514
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:30,662
Oh!

515
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,364
Cuff his hands
to that grab handle there.

516
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:39,105
Son of a bitch.

517
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:41,007
See how much
you like being cuffed up.

518
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,274
It's a fair fight, huh?

519
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,212
Okay. So...

520
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:51,683
- Oh, crap.
- Listen.

521
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:54,020
Oh, my God. We're so screwed.

522
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:56,788
Oh, my God. We are so screwed.

523
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:58,324
- Calm down.
- Oh, my God.

524
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,458
Calm down?

525
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,692
You're telling me
to calm down?

526
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:01,961
My mom has never
hurt a soul in her life.

527
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:03,695
She's gonna die
and it's gonna be my fault.

528
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:05,464
Do you get that?
Do you get how that must feel?

529
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,033
Listen. Listen to me!

530
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,267
We're gonna
figure this out, okay?

531
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,635
Your mom is still alive.

532
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,971
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do. I do know that.

533
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:15,541
I know Moretti has no leverage
over you if she's dead, right?

534
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:18,310
- Yeah, I guess.
- So I know she's still alive.

535
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:20,712
I also know that
you can't change the past.

536
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,181
All we can do is choose

537
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,284
how to respond
in this moment, okay?

538
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,653
So I'm gonna get on the radio
and we're gonna get help.

539
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:30,056
For us. For your mom.

540
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,457
And then we're gonna
get you to New York

541
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,892
so you can testify
and put Moretti away for good.

542
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:37,429
But...

543
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,366
Where the hell are we?

544
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,455
At least,
let me sit up there with you.

545
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:07,559
Come on, I can help.

546
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:10,429
You really want to help?
How did you know about Daryl?

547
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,370
Just trying to keep us alive.

548
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,708
- Come on.
- Thank you.

549
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,514
You piss yourself again,
I'm sending you back.

550
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:29,982
That's all right. I'm empty.

551
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,620
Hello. Is anyone receiving me?

552
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:37,656
Can anyone hear me?

553
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,127
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.

554
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,529
They're gonna send someone
to find us, right?

555
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:44,730
I mean, when we don't show up?

556
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:45,964
Oh, we're showing up.

557
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:48,034
Oh, yeah, no,
we're showing up. For sure.

558
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:52,604
But, uh, if we don't,
they know our route, right?

559
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:56,708
Our route? There's no way
he was taking us to Anchorage.

560
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:57,809
Yeah, you know,
I'm really starting

561
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,011
to question his honesty.

562
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:03,382
But look,
there's gotta be some way

563
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:04,483
they could locate us, right?

564
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:05,651
Like an emergency signal

565
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,753
or like a black box
or something?

566
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:11,290
Winston, the radio, the GPS,
he didn't want us to be found.

567
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:15,394
Hello. Can anybody read me?

568
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:17,329
- We're gonna crash.
- Mayday. Mayday.

569
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:20,632
Quiet. No we're not.
Can anybody hear me?

570
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,434
I'm on a plane
and I need help.

571
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:26,805
Help. Help.

572
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,507
Say again?

573
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,842
Yes. Hello. Can you hear me?

574
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,311
I can hear you.

575
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,580
Yeah, I read you. Say again.

576
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:36,748
Help. I need help.

577
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:39,285
This is an aviation frequency.

578
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:41,953
Yes, I know. I'm on a plane.

579
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,156
You don't sound like a pilot.

580
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,260
No, I'm... I'm not.
My pilot, he...

581
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:49,861
- Still there? Hello?
- He's in...

582
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:52,998
He's incapacitated.
Unconscious.

583
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,466
I'm flying his plane

584
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,268
and I don't know
what I'm doing.

585
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:57,936
- All right, I get it.
- Hello?

586
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,571
Frank put you up to this,
didn't he?

587
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:00,972
You're kidding, right?

588
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:04,443
What? No, I'm not kidding.
Please give me some help.

589
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:08,147
Oh. Oh. Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, okay.

590
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,715
Okay. First thing's first.

591
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:12,151
Um, did you engage your pilot?

592
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,219
What the fuck is he saying?

593
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,389
Yes. Yes, it's on.

594
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:19,858
Okay, that'll maintain your
heading and keep you level.

595
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,528
Just keep your hands off
the yokes for now.

596
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,895
What's your altitude?
Can you see?

597
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,031
It should be a big gauge
right in front.

598
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,167
Can you hear me?

599
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,237
Three. 3000 feet.

600
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,571
Okay, you're a little low,

601
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,406
but we're not going
to worry about that yet.

602
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,242
What's your location?

603
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,979
Uh, somewhere between
Bethel and Anchorage.

604
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,415
I don't know.
All I see is mountains.

605
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:47,919
I think we may have drifted
pretty far off course here.

606
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:51,056
Okay, well, I can't be too far
away if I can... you.

607
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,824
Can you see any landmarks?

608
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,528
You're breaking up a little.
Can you say again?

609
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:57,696
I said...

610
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,468
- Damn it, come on. Hello?
- Hello...

611
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,537
Hello? Hello?

612
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:12,278
- Hello? Can anybody hear me?
- He'll call it in, right?

613
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,546
Wait, what did you say?

614
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,614
He's got to call in

615
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,349
the situation, right,
the pilot guy?

616
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:18,717
He's got to call it in.

617
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,288
What?

618
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,456
Madolyn.
Where'd you leave your brain?

619
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:30,396
- Out here?
- It's a satellite phone.

620
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:31,830
Doesn't use cell towers.

621
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,833
Come on. Come on.

622
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,036
-Madolyn?
- Caroline.

623
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,705
Oh, God! Oh, thank God.

624
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:40,806
Listen.

625
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,140
You can't be
in Anchorage already.

626
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:44,042
No, no, no.
We're still in the air.

627
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,311
We've been compromised.

628
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,546
I can barely hear you, Mads.
Hello? Hello?

629
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,080
Hang on.

630
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,716
Hey, Chet, drop the muffin,
please, and get over here.

631
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,050
The rest of you
shut the fuck up.

632
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,219
We've been compromised.

633
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:54,753
The pilot wasn't
who he says he was.

634
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,488
- He's one of Moretti's.
- You think?

635
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:58,156
Wait, what?

636
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,292
I caught him in a lie
and he tried to knife me.

637
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,628
- Are... Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

638
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,596
He's unconscious
and restrained in the back.

639
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,065
- And the witness?
- Winston, he's fine.

640
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,268
Yeah, never been better.
Thanks.

641
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:11,670
Mads, question.
Who's flying the plane?

642
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,239
- I am.
- You?

643
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,607
I'm flying this plane and I
don't know what I'm doing.

644
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:16,775
Okay. Okay.

645
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,109
Well, we just need
to stay calm.

646
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,345
I'm calm.

647
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:21,112
All right, so you are
flying the plane

648
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,415
and just so I understand it.

649
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:25,984
- How exactly?
- It's on autopilot.

650
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,753
We're sort of cruising
in a straight line.

651
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,521
I think he sabotaged
the navigation.

652
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:31,189
Sims, see if we can
track her on radar.

653
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:32,358
- Yes, ma'am.
- I need someone to help me

654
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:33,925
- fly this thing.
- Yup, we're gonna find

655
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,861
your pilot who's gonna walk
you through it. Sit tight.

656
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:37,296
Smith, get me a fucking pilot.

657
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:38,530
Okay, I'll wait for his call.

658
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:41,199
- Hey, hey, hey. My mom.
- Oh, yes, yes.

659
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:42,601
You need to send some officers

660
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,102
over to Winston's
mother's house, okay?

661
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,471
She may be in danger.

662
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:47,439
Okay, all right.
Don't worry. We're on it.

663
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:49,475
- I will call you back.
- Okay.

664
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,678
- So?
- Finding us a pilot.

665
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,812
Hey!

666
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:57,349
Y'all need a pilot?

667
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:04,290
Hot damn!
That taser's no joke.

668
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:06,191
We like our pilots crispy.

669
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:09,928
Tell me how to fly this thing.

670
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,998
Um, no.

671
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,170
I think I bit my tongue.

672
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,206
Although I was dreaming

673
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,874
that you were nibbling
on my nipple, Twiggy.

674
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:25,544
Was that you?

675
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,579
Or was that
just my imagination?

676
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:29,348
Who told you we were
moving Winston today?

677
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:33,084
I'll tell you what.

678
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,387
Why don't you come on
back here with me,

679
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:37,423
and I'll tell you
all about it.

680
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:38,857
We could play
hide-the-hot dog.

681
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:44,996
Easy now.

682
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,398
You're awful close
with that thing.

683
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:49,234
- Makes it hard to miss.
- Shoot him now.

684
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,836
- Yeah.
- Do it.

685
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,070
Also makes it more than likely

686
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,039
that that bullet's gonna
pass clear through me

687
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:56,041
and into the wall behind me.

688
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:58,410
Where the fuel line
and the fuel tank is.

689
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,712
You could put a hole in it.

690
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:02,848
Or it could ricochet around

691
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,215
right into
one of you fuckheads.

692
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:07,453
Yeah.

693
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:12,223
Now, I know
you ain't much for planes.

694
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:13,459
But surely you know
a thing or two

695
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:15,060
about how bullets work,
don't you?

696
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:20,566
Yeah.
Quite the pickle, ain't it?

697
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:27,773
Okay. I'll make you
a deal, chuckles.

698
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,375
You tell me
how to fly this thing,

699
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:30,576
I'll let you
go to prison in peace.

700
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,513
Pass. Option B?

701
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:37,148
I'll put it out there
that you turned on Moretti.

702
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,250
And you can go to prison
looking over your shoulder

703
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:41,086
for the rest of what'll be
a very short life.

704
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,188
Clearly you're mistaking me
for somebody

705
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:45,791
who actually
gives a fuck about that.

706
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,126
I've spent every
waking day in prison

707
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,595
looking over my shoulder.

708
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,198
You get it, Twig?

709
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,836
- You will.
- Yeah, no, I got it.

710
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,440
Come on, you really
wanna die out here?

711
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:04,643
Honey, you gotta
land the plane first.

712
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,011
At least, tell me
your real name.

713
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:10,816
You know what's the last thing
to go through your head

714
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:11,950
before crash landing?

715
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,789
Your ass.

716
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:20,258
- Oh, my God, he doesn't care.
- Or maybe his.

717
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,460
He doesn't care
whether he lives or dies.

718
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:23,128
- I care, Twiggy.
- He doesn't care at all.

719
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:24,262
This is Harris.

720
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,464
- I care about you.
-Hey there,

721
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:26,598
- Deputy Harris
-We're gonna die.

722
00:39:26,632 --> 00:39:27,666
My name's Hassan.

723
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,167
He doesn't care
if he lives or dies.

724
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,536
I am a pilot with air traffic
control in Anchorage.

725
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:31,470
We're all gonna die with him
in this flying coffin!

726
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:33,271
Will you shut up?

727
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,940
I could shut up, yes,

728
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,207
but it will make it
harder to help.

729
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:38,810
No, no, no.
No, I didn't mean you. I...

730
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:41,112
Hassan.
Or if you like, Hassan.

731
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:42,781
And it's all good, Deputy.

732
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,450
Sounds like things
are a little tense up there.

733
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:46,452
Yeah, yeah,
you could say that.

734
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:48,987
Well, not to worry.
We're in this together now.

735
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,689
And we're going
to get you sorted out.

736
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,024
You got an airspeed
and altitude for me?

737
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:57,429
I... Yeah. 3,000 feet.
And airspeed is...

738
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:00,231
It should be just to the left.

739
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:02,568
With the green, yellow,
and red range on it.

740
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:05,003
Got it. Airspeed is at 120.

741
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,573
120 at 3,000. Roger.

742
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:09,374
And what are you
doing after this?

743
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:12,010
Excuse me?

744
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,112
Myself, I haven't
eaten all day.

745
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,582
You want to have
dinner with me?

746
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:18,316
Yeah, if you insist.

747
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,919
I mean, we should probably
focus on landing first.

748
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,053
You're paying, though.

749
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,355
Seems only fair
since you asked me.

750
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,758
Of course. Fair's fair.

751
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,259
That is a verbal commitment,

752
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:29,895
and I'm going
to hold you to it.

753
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:33,098
This day's looking up already.
At least for me.

754
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,934
Okay, so when you're ready,

755
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,903
you're just going to ease
that yoke to the left.

756
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,004
Nice and gentle.

757
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,405
Okay.

758
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:45,410
- We're turning.
- Stellar.

759
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,381
Now, I know you're anxious
to meet me and all,

760
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:52,417
but just keep an eye
on our altitude.

761
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,853
Make sure
you're holding steady.

762
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,888
Now, would you like me
to make the reservation?

763
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:59,558
You seem kind of busy.
I got this.

764
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:02,260
Now, pull back
on the yoke a little.

765
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:03,995
Okay.

766
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:09,367
- We're good.
- I have no doubt.

767
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,402
Now, there should be
a heading indicator,

768
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:14,072
first thing above the yoke,
looks just like a compass.

769
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,641
I see it.

770
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:18,577
Okay, when you hit southeast,
just straighten out the plane.

771
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:23,114
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

772
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:24,415
Straightening.

773
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,388
- Done.
- Stupendous.

774
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:34,492
Now, do me a favor and engage
that autopilot switch again.

775
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,797
- Okay.
- Fantabulous.

776
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,131
And you are good to go.

777
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,167
Keep an eye out
for the coastline.

778
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,735
When you hit it,
we'll bank left

779
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:46,237
and follow it south
towards Anchorage.

780
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:49,174
See that?
Practically home already.

781
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:51,743
- Thank you.
- No thanks necessary.

782
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:54,112
Believe me, the drinks
you'll be buying later

783
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:56,414
will be more than enough.

784
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,049
- Is that right?
- Oh, yeah.

785
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,551
I like to drink a lot.

786
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,687
Noted.

787
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,589
I'm going to hop off now
to save your battery,

788
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:04,690
but call this number

789
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:06,792
when you spot
the coastline, okay?

790
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:08,827
Or if you just miss
the sound of my voice.

791
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,962
- I'll be counting the moments.
- 

792
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:25,944
You can call me
when you need me.

793
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:28,980
I'll be right here.
Just hanging around.

794
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,554
* How does it feel *

795
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,057
* To treat me like you do *

796
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,493
* You lay your hands upon me *

797
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:17,328
* Tell me who you are *

798
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:20,732
What were you waiting for?
Huh?

799
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:23,068
Why didn't you just
kill us and toss us out?

800
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:26,271
Fly all by my lonesome?

801
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:28,606
It ain't every day you get
a captive audience, you know.

802
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:32,377
Don't give me that.

803
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,547
I know people, Twig. And you?

804
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:39,284
Yeah, you like to watch.

805
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:43,822
Hey.

806
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,724
Hey!

807
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:50,662
If it's any consolation,

808
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:54,165
she's gonna watch, too.

809
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,602
It's going to be
a real picnic.

810
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:01,272
Winnie.

811
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,477
Why don't you
come on back here?

812
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:08,646
Why don't we start over, huh?

813
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,481
Who you want to be?

814
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:12,617
You want to be
the husband or the wife? Huh?

815
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,856
How come you ain't sweet,
like your mommy?

816
00:44:19,624 --> 00:44:21,192
Your mommy's nice and sweet.

817
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:24,595
She's real sweet.

818
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:27,465
Just like mine.

819
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,702
She loved me,
but she just wouldn't shut up.

820
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:37,608
Come here, Winnie.
I wanna show you something.

821
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:42,613
You're gonna like it.

822
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:45,683
Maybe not at first.

823
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:48,486
But they always
end up liking it.

824
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:53,291
Oh, yeah.

825
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:00,398
Fuck!

826
00:45:25,757 --> 00:45:26,758
Hey, Winnie.

827
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,128
After I kill you,

828
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:31,629
I'm gonna take the Polaroids
to show your mama.

829
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:34,732
Jesus, how does this asshole
know my mom's address?

830
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:38,703
You think Moretti had someone
in the Marshal's office?

831
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,906
I told that address
to the US Attorney

832
00:45:40,939 --> 00:45:43,208
when we were talking about
witness protection. That's it.

833
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:48,046
I'm serious. I was careful.

834
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,447
No one knows that address.

835
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,484
Caroline.

836
00:45:53,518 --> 00:45:55,420
Okay, so we're coordinating
with the military

837
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:56,754
to get search and rescue up.

838
00:45:56,788 --> 00:45:58,323
It shouldn't be long now.

839
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:01,059
Now, I'm told you're a little
small and low for radar,

840
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,393
particularly with
all the mountains,

841
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:04,095
so I'm trying to scramble
some fighter jets,

842
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:06,264
get some extra eyeballs
out there.

843
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,199
Okay, we're headed
for the coast,

844
00:46:08,233 --> 00:46:10,335
so maybe have them
sweep that first.

845
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,437
Yeah... Um, look,
there's something else.

846
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:14,572
Anchorage PD just found

847
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,442
what's left of Daryl Booth
in his apartment.

848
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:20,879
No eyes, no teeth, no fingers.

849
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:23,714
It sounds like someone really
took their time with him.

850
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:36,027
Someone talked.
Who knew about this op?

851
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:39,364
Uh, I mean, we had to notify
local law enforcement,

852
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:42,100
file a plan with the FAA,
alert the TSA, and...

853
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,534
They knew we were
moving someone,

854
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:44,769
but they didn't
know who, right?

855
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,305
I mean, who actually
knew about Winston?

856
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:50,808
Uh, well, the US Attorney,
the Director, obviously,

857
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:53,711
- the AG, the Deputy AG.
- And you.

858
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:56,114
Well, yes, of course,
but there's no telling

859
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,883
who else may have
accessed that information.

860
00:46:57,916 --> 00:46:59,284
Did you see that?

861
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:03,088
What the hell is that?

862
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:05,156
I need to call you back.

863
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,791
We're not gonna make that.
You gotta pull up.

864
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,293
- Oh, my God.
- Nah, nah, you're fine.

865
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,760
You got plenty of room left.

866
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,731
Pull up.

867
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,766
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Pull up. Pull up.

868
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,635
- You gotta pull up!
- I am. I am!

869
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,005
- I'm telling you, it's fine.
- Come on, damn it!

870
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:22,173
- Shit. The autopilot!
- Come on!

871
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:23,875
Whoa!

872
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:27,645
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

873
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:32,317
Come on. Come on.

874
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,618
Come on. Come on.

875
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:39,524
Oh, my God!

876
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:11,856
Oh, my God.

877
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:27,072
Thank you.

878
00:48:43,188 --> 00:48:45,090
Shit!

879
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:57,435
Yee-haw!
How fun was that, huh?

880
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:59,437
What a squeaker!

881
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,738
I don't know about you,

882
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,473
but I just made
a Jackson Pollock in my pants.

883
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:06,444
Hey, Winnie.
Did you make a poop?

884
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:10,581
Seriously, guys.

885
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:13,118
It's like the Museum of
Modern Art back here.

886
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:16,787
Hey, Madolyn.

887
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:18,389
I'm sure glad
you didn't kill Winston

888
00:49:18,423 --> 00:49:20,591
while he was in your custody.

889
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,728
Oh, I'd hate for you to have
to go through that shit again.

890
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:33,938
- What is he talking about?
- Just ignore him.

891
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,973
Hey! What dumb fuck

892
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:38,276
put you back
in the saddle again, huh?

893
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:42,113
Seriously, what does he mean?

894
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:43,481
It means, Twig,

895
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:45,783
that I ain't the one
you should be worried about.

896
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,152
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

897
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:50,621
Hey, Twiggy, I know
she killed her last prisoner.

898
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,526
Oh. Oh, no.

899
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:59,830
- What?
- Oh, shit. Oh, hell.

900
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:01,166
Was that supposed
to be a secret?

901
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:05,303
Oh, darling,
what's the matter?

902
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,404
No more foreplay?

903
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:08,306
How do you know that?

904
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:11,909
Whoa.

905
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,344
How do you know that?

906
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:14,512
Well, it's true, ain't it?

907
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:17,482
- Whoa.
- Answer me!

908
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:23,421
Feels good
to let it out, right?

909
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:25,656
I get it.
I've been there too, baby.

910
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,158
You don't know
what you're talking about.

911
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:28,593
Of course I do.

912
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:30,528
Oh, you could tell yourself
you're different.

913
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:31,829
We're the same, you and me.

914
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,365
Fuck you.

915
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:37,135
We'll get there.
Oh, hell, come on.

916
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:39,504
I haven't even used
my safe word yet.

917
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,674
You know, it's "burned alive."

918
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:49,947
You still see her face? Huh?

919
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,550
When you close
your eyes, you do, huh?

920
00:50:57,855 --> 00:51:00,158
Oh, I bet you still hear
her scream, don't you?

921
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:02,393
Her shrieks of pain.

922
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:04,895
Yeah.

923
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,003
Oh, I miss
these little moments.

924
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:18,409
Don't stop. Come on,
you're giving me a hard on.

925
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:33,924
I hope Moretti
does come for you.

926
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:14,499
Okay. When you're ready.

927
00:52:20,104 --> 00:52:22,039
Two years ago,

928
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:24,509
we caught up with this
young woman, Maria.

929
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,746
She'd been
on the run for weeks,

930
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:31,582
and the DA convinced her
to turn against her boyfriend,

931
00:52:31,616 --> 00:52:33,083
who was a cartel boss.

932
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,654
So we were holed up
in a shitty motel

933
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:38,356
until she could testify.

934
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:43,093
We'd been in the room
for three straight days,

935
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:47,798
and she wanted to take
a shower, unsupervised.

936
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:50,100
A moment of privacy.

937
00:52:56,106 --> 00:53:00,010
It was against protocol,
but I let her.

938
00:53:00,044 --> 00:53:02,847
So I shackled her to the tub
and stepped outside.

939
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:09,487
A sicario smashed
a Molotov cocktail

940
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,855
through the window.

941
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:15,326
I turned back and...

942
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,397
heat and smoke
and flames and...

943
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:25,903
And I ran.

944
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,842
But Maria,
with the shackles, she...

945
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:35,913
she...

946
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:48,926
And they put you on a desk.

947
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:53,197
They said they didn't trust me
in the field again.

948
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:59,036
Until now, with me.

949
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,915
Mads,
how you doing up there?

950
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:13,217
Caroline, the leak isn't from

951
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,586
the attorney's office
or the FBI.

952
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,022
It's from us, Caroline.
It's the Marshals.

953
00:54:18,055 --> 00:54:20,057
All right.
How did you get to that?

954
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,092
Our pilot friend
knows my work history.

955
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,762
My personal work history.

956
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:26,030
Wait, hang on, Mads.

957
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:27,164
Everyone out.

958
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:28,399
- I need the room.
-Yes, ma'am.

959
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:30,267
Maybe we need to bring
the director in on this.

960
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:32,036
Yes, absolutely.
As soon as we get you down.

961
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:33,504
Well, how about now?

962
00:54:33,538 --> 00:54:35,573
Look, the situation
is fluid at best.

963
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,241
We need to get you
safely on the ground

964
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,543
and into the hands of my team.

965
00:54:38,576 --> 00:54:39,944
Your team?

966
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:42,212
Yes. You could trust them.
I vetted them myself.

967
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:44,582
You did, huh?

968
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:48,953
- What does Coleridge think?
- Why? This is my operation.

969
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:52,222
- You don't trust the director?
- Hey, I did not say that.

970
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:54,959
I'm saying that if the leak
is in our office,

971
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:56,093
as you say it is,

972
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,262
then we need to be careful.

973
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,197
We can't be sure who to trust.

974
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,399
You're right.

975
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:03,100
So let me get into this, okay?

976
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,935
You focus on getting
that plane down safely.

977
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:07,772
Mads, okay?

978
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,308
Yeah. I gotta go.
Hassan's calling.

979
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:27,191
Hey. How's it going up there?

980
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,660
Not great, huh?

981
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:33,263
You wanna talk about it,
let me know.

982
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:35,433
You can come back
and pay me another visit.

983
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:48,245
US Marshal's office.

984
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:49,847
This is Deputy Harris.

985
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,082
I need you to put me
through to the director.

986
00:55:52,116 --> 00:55:53,851
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I can't
get a hold of him right now.

987
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:55,786
Tell him it's Deputy
Madolyn Harris calling

988
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,354
and that it's an emergency.

989
00:55:57,388 --> 00:55:58,656
He'll know.

990
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,290
Director Coleridge
isn't here today, ma'am.

991
00:56:00,324 --> 00:56:01,526
If you'd like,
I can put you through

992
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:03,027
to your supervisory deputy

993
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,495
or transfer you
to another department.

994
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:05,696
No, no, no. Listen to me.

995
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,598
Janine, I need
to talk to him right now.

996
00:56:07,632 --> 00:56:08,933
I'm sorry, but he's...

997
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:11,469
People will die if you
don't get him on the line.

998
00:56:11,502 --> 00:56:12,937
Oh, shit.

999
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:16,707
- Uh, let me see what I can do.
- Thank you.

1000
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:25,816
Hey, Winston.
Talk to your mother lately?

1001
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:29,053
- Ignore him.
- She's a sweet lady.

1002
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:31,088
I hope she put
her dentures back in.

1003
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:38,228
Janine.

1004
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:39,396
Yes, ma'am. I've managed

1005
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:40,898
to get a hold of
Director Coleridge.

1006
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:43,000
I'm going to patch you through
to his beach house, okay?

1007
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:46,036
- Yes, please. Thank you.
- One moment.

1008
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:49,073
- Coleridge here.
- Sir, this is Harris.

1009
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:51,842
I've been briefed, Deputy.
Where's Van Sant?

1010
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:55,813
- Uh, sir, there's a leak.
- What? what?

1011
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:57,715
Moretti has a mole
in the Marshal's office.

1012
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:58,983
I could prove it.

1013
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:01,552
And I believe that
it's Deputy Van Sant, sir.

1014
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:04,555
Hello?

1015
00:57:04,589 --> 00:57:06,557
She went out
on a limb for you, Harris.

1016
00:57:06,591 --> 00:57:10,695
I... I know. I know, sir.
I'm aware of that. I...

1017
00:57:10,728 --> 00:57:13,430
I believe that
given my prior history,

1018
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:16,333
she expected me to fail again.

1019
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,503
Van Sant.
She's in New York, right?

1020
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:20,337
That is correct.

1021
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,507
Okay. Let me make some calls.

1022
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,542
She has a team waiting for us.

1023
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:26,076
She needs to be
contained and...

1024
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,244
I understand, Deputy.

1025
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,046
Believe me.
I'll shut her down.

1026
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:30,414
From now on,
just call me directly

1027
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,916
at my house in Sankaty.

1028
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:35,886
Deputy?

1029
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,788
I will. Thank you, sir.

1030
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,892
The coast. You see it?
I see the coast.

1031
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:43,227
Oh, my God.

1032
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:45,963
Come on.

1033
00:57:46,664 --> 00:57:48,933
Hassan, we see the coast.

1034
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,769
- Ooh! Fantabulous!
- The Coast. We saw the coast.

1035
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,972
Ha-ha! You're making my day
over here.

1036
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:56,941
Well, we aim to please.

1037
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,810
Okay, so you're going
to bank left nice and easy,

1038
00:57:59,844 --> 00:58:02,046
and then just follow
that coastline to east.

1039
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,748
Okay.

1040
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:06,150
Banking.

1041
00:58:07,852 --> 00:58:09,987
Stupendous. Now be honest.

1042
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,890
Is that landscape
not just stunningly beautiful?

1043
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:14,024
Also, how's your fuel?

1044
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:18,162
Uh, fuel's at 25 gallons.

1045
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:20,430
And, yeah,
it's something all right.

1046
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:30,407
- Hassan?
- Yeah, sorry. I...

1047
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,710
Did you say 25 gallons
on both tanks?

1048
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,345
Is that a problem?

1049
00:58:35,379 --> 00:58:37,748
No, no, no. Not a problem.
Just a data point.

1050
00:58:37,782 --> 00:58:39,917
Trust me.
This is good news, Deputy.

1051
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,518
We're going to have you
on the ground in no time.

1052
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:44,188
Now turn that autopilot on
and stay the course.

1053
00:58:45,723 --> 00:58:47,124
Okay, keep me posted.

1054
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:49,126
Absolutely.
I'm here if you need.

1055
00:58:58,235 --> 00:58:59,369
What?

1056
00:58:59,403 --> 00:59:01,038
- Fuck.
- What?

1057
00:59:02,006 --> 00:59:03,073
Fuck!

1058
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:07,444
That payoff
you told Daryl about.

1059
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:10,114
Oh, you heard that?
I was bluffing.

1060
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:12,449
I swear to God,
I would never sell you out.

1061
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,484
- It's not in me to be able
- No, no, no, Winston, Winston.

1062
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:15,552
You said that you were

1063
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:17,354
paying some guy
25 grand a month.

1064
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,589
Where did you say
it was going?

1065
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:20,357
Sankaty.

1066
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:23,227
Are you sure?

1067
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,630
I thought those payoffs
were untraceable.

1068
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:28,799
Well, the accounts are,
sure, but...

1069
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:30,334
A couple years ago,
I was down in Florida

1070
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:32,369
when Hurricane Michael hit,

1071
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,304
so the payments
were a few days late.

1072
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:35,472
It was no big deal,

1073
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,507
except for this
one greedy idiot

1074
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,043
sent me a transfer request

1075
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:42,680
from an IP address
in Sankaty, Massachusetts.

1076
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:44,414
- Why?
- Holy shit.

1077
00:59:50,955 --> 00:59:52,757
Come on. Come on.

1078
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:53,858
Hey, Mad, what's up?

1079
00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:55,059
It's Coleridge. He's the leak.

1080
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,226
What?

1081
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,062
You gotta get out
of the office right now.

1082
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,330
- Wait, slow down. Slow down.
- There's no time.

1083
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:03,233
- Tell me about Coleridge.
- Winston handled his payoffs.

1084
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:04,769
Oh, shit.

1085
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:07,071
Listen to me. I called him.

1086
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,205
Okay, and?

1087
01:00:08,238 --> 01:00:09,940
I'm sorry.
I should have trusted you.

1088
01:00:09,974 --> 01:00:12,342
Okay. What did you tell him?

1089
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:14,779
That there's a leak.
That I thought...

1090
01:00:14,812 --> 01:00:17,581
-  Just say it.
- That I thought it was you.

1091
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,116
Thought it was me. Fuck.

1092
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:21,686
I'm sorry. Look, you've gotta
get out of there.

1093
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:22,853
He's coming for you.

1094
01:00:22,887 --> 01:00:24,221
Okay. All right.

1095
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:26,556
Just focus on landing
that plane safely, okay?

1096
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:27,958
- I will handle this.
- Yeah.

1097
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:31,128
And Madolyn,
you know I love you.

1098
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:33,063
- But thanks a lot, bitch.
- Okay.

1099
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:37,434
Fuck!

1100
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,782
Okay, what is that?
Do you see that?

1101
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,820
- What is that?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it.

1102
01:00:57,788 --> 01:00:58,923
Hassan.

1103
01:00:58,956 --> 01:01:00,624
All ears, Deputy.
How can I help?

1104
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,127
Uh, we see something.
It's like...

1105
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:05,830
Uh... It's a... Like a boat.

1106
01:01:05,863 --> 01:01:07,164
- A fishing boat.
- A big ship.

1107
01:01:07,197 --> 01:01:08,432
- A shipwreck.
- A shipwreck.

1108
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:10,735
Oh, shiver me timbers.
We can work with that.

1109
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:12,602
Can you see a name on it?

1110
01:01:12,636 --> 01:01:13,804
Can you see a name on it?

1111
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:14,972
You gotta get me closer.

1112
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,140
Okay, we're too high.

1113
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:17,341
All right, if you
wanted to descend,

1114
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:19,243
keep your pitch
at five degrees or less.

1115
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:22,446
And make sure you stay
above 1,000 feet, okay?

1116
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:23,613
Okay.

1117
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:28,618
Uh, just a little bit closer.

1118
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:30,287
Can you see a name?

1119
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,356
Okay, okay, it says...

1120
01:01:33,457 --> 01:01:36,526
Fat Dancer?

1121
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,627
- The Fat Dancer.
- The Fat...

1122
01:01:37,661 --> 01:01:38,963
The Fat Dancer?

1123
01:01:38,996 --> 01:01:40,030
That doesn't make any sense.

1124
01:01:40,064 --> 01:01:41,165
He took my glasses.
I don't know.

1125
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,801
The Fat Dancer?
Odd name for a boat.

1126
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:46,636
- The Fair Dancer.
- The Fair Dancer, yeah.

1127
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,806
- That makes a lot more sense.
- The Fair Dancer.

1128
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:50,875
The Fair Dancer.
Got it, okay, stand by.

1129
01:01:50,908 --> 01:01:52,176
We're running it past
the Coast Guard now.

1130
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:53,210
Okay.

1131
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:12,196
You know, I'm something
of a fair dancer myself.

1132
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:14,031
I have no doubt.

1133
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:15,499
Well, let's boogie.

1134
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:17,501
Because the Coast Guard
ID'd the wreck.

1135
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:19,469
We've got a pretty good fix
on your location.

1136
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:20,637
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1137
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,206
- They see us.
- Whoo!

1138
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,808
We are grooving now.

1139
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:26,576
Thank God.

1140
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,846
It's a fucking
roller coaster ride.

1141
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,150
Okay. I guess
we gotta land at some point.

1142
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:34,318
Like a feather.

1143
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:35,385
Now, if you'd be so kind

1144
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:37,221
as to turn left
to heading 120,

1145
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,722
that should
put you into Anchorage

1146
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:39,857
in about 30 minutes.

1147
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,325
- Okay, copy.
- Here we come.

1148
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:43,527
- Turning 120.
- Here we come.

1149
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,529
Stellar. Hold that heading.

1150
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:46,931
I'll call back
in 10 minutes or so,

1151
01:02:46,964 --> 01:02:48,665
and we can talk landings.

1152
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,868
And the finer points of
tearing up the dance floor.

1153
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:52,436
I can't wait. Thank you.

1154
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:55,105
We're gonna get out of this.
We're gonna get out of it!

1155
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,276
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

1156
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:02,179
Twig! Pay attention.
This is the good part.

1157
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:05,215
You ever see a face
turn this color before? Huh?

1158
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:08,685
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's for later.

1159
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:10,287
Oh, you know what?
Let me get that for you.

1160
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,124
Is that better? Oh, yeah.
I think I caught a rib there.

1161
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:15,893
Maybe the spleen, too.

1162
01:03:15,926 --> 01:03:18,128
Don't worry. You don't
need a spleen to live.

1163
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:19,864
Hey, you want to know
my name, huh?

1164
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:21,866
Come on.
I'll give you three guesses.

1165
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,735
Nope. No. That's not a name.

1166
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:27,938
Come on. Guess again.
Guess again.

1167
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,375
Nope. That's not a name.

1168
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:33,110
I'm only gonna give you
one more try.

1169
01:03:58,768 --> 01:03:59,836
Shit!

1170
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:04,975
Shit! Fucking bitch!

1171
01:04:38,675 --> 01:04:40,644
No one cares
what your fucking name is.

1172
01:04:47,251 --> 01:04:49,419
All right.
All right, let me see.

1173
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:53,690
- Come on. Let me see.
- Okay.

1174
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,593
Let me see. Come on. Come on.

1175
01:05:00,364 --> 01:05:01,565
Okay.

1176
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:05,402
- Okay, it's fine.
- It's not fine.

1177
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:07,871
- You're going to be fine.
- It's not fine.

1178
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,674
Just put some
pressure on it, okay?

1179
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:13,443
All right.
Let me put one of these on.

1180
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:20,384
Sorry. Another one here.
All right.

1181
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:23,053
- Okay.
- All right.

1182
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:24,588
There's morphine.
You want morphine?

1183
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:26,223
No, I'm scared of needles.

1184
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:30,961
Yeah. Fuck it. Do it.

1185
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:42,006
I'm dying. Aren't I?

1186
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:44,874
- No, you're not.
- Don't lie to me. I am.

1187
01:05:44,908 --> 01:05:45,942
You're not dying.

1188
01:05:45,976 --> 01:05:47,344
Don't fucking lie to me.
Please.

1189
01:05:47,377 --> 01:05:49,879
Listen to me. Listen to me.
You're not dying.

1190
01:05:49,913 --> 01:05:51,448
I'm gonna get you
out of this, okay?

1191
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:52,749
You just gotta breathe.

1192
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,219
All right. It's coming.

1193
01:05:58,222 --> 01:05:59,889
Oh, yeah.

1194
01:06:00,991 --> 01:06:02,792
Okay.

1195
01:06:02,826 --> 01:06:04,561
I'm feeling it
a little bit. Yeah.

1196
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:07,297
- Okay. Great.
- Whoo. Whoo.

1197
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:08,898
All right.

1198
01:06:10,934 --> 01:06:12,136
Keep pressure on it.

1199
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,514
Thank you, by the way.

1200
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:27,951
What did I do?

1201
01:06:29,153 --> 01:06:31,721
He would have killed me.

1202
01:06:31,755 --> 01:06:33,923
I told you to shoot him
when you had the chance.

1203
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:40,530
Okay, keep pressure on it.

1204
01:06:45,469 --> 01:06:46,603
Oh, yeah.

1205
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:16,866
Hello.

1206
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,034
How are you
doing up there?

1207
01:07:18,068 --> 01:07:20,870
Listen,
Winston's been stabbed.

1208
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:22,972
I... I'm sorry?

1209
01:07:23,006 --> 01:07:26,510
The pilot, uh, Booth,
or whatever his name is,

1210
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:29,213
- he got free and stabbed him.
- Oh, my God.

1211
01:07:29,246 --> 01:07:31,215
And I...
I shot him with a flare.

1212
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:33,617
A flare, okay.

1213
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:36,986
- Hello?
- Yeah. Uh, copy. Stand by.

1214
01:07:37,687 --> 01:07:38,888
All right.

1215
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:43,026
- Still there?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

1216
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,395
Okay, I couldn't reach
Deputy Van Sant.

1217
01:07:45,429 --> 01:07:47,164
What is the status
of the witness?

1218
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,570
- Dire.
- I see.

1219
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:56,173
Listen, we're gonna need some
real medical attention here.

1220
01:07:56,206 --> 01:07:59,075
Copy. Tarmac EMS
is on standby.

1221
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:02,146
Okay. How far away are we?

1222
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:04,881
About 18 to 20 minutes out.

1223
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,083
- Is there anything faster?
- Uh...

1224
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:10,053
- Hassan.
- Okay.

1225
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,488
Technically, we can
increase your speed.

1226
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:12,722
Great.

1227
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:15,192
But it'll burn through
the rest of your fuel.

1228
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:16,393
We have no choice.

1229
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,562
Deputy, I need you
to understand...

1230
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:19,929
Listen, if Winston...

1231
01:08:19,963 --> 01:08:22,399
If Winston doesn't testify,
Coleridge walks,

1232
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:23,700
Moretti walks.

1233
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:26,170
Understand, landing
will be more difficult.

1234
01:08:26,203 --> 01:08:28,037
Look, I'm not
losing him, all right?

1235
01:08:30,774 --> 01:08:34,178
Okay. Open up the red
handle marked "fuel mix"

1236
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:36,280
and then push
the throttle all the way in.

1237
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:39,183
Okay, approaching 160.

1238
01:08:39,216 --> 01:08:41,084
Now, keep an eye on that fuel.

1239
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,386
I'll call you back
in a few minutes

1240
01:08:42,419 --> 01:08:43,587
with the landing procedure.

1241
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,721
Okay.

1242
01:08:47,491 --> 01:08:50,160
All right, Winston?
Hang in there.

1243
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:53,597
- I am.
- Not long now.

1244
01:09:03,106 --> 01:09:04,741
Winston, how are you doing?

1245
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,647
You mean, like in general?

1246
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:31,268
Uh-oh.

1247
01:09:33,703 --> 01:09:35,339
You're in trouble now.

1248
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:41,044
Hang in there.

1249
01:09:46,383 --> 01:09:47,617
I'm sorry.

1250
01:09:51,488 --> 01:09:52,989
This is my fault.

1251
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:56,025
This is all my fault.

1252
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:00,129
That's the morphine talking.

1253
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:01,398
No.

1254
01:10:04,301 --> 01:10:05,735
I could've done anything.

1255
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:09,172
I was one of those guys,
like in school,

1256
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,841
I could've done anything.

1257
01:10:16,179 --> 01:10:17,747
I could've gone to college.

1258
01:10:20,517 --> 01:10:22,185
I could've got a good job.

1259
01:10:23,387 --> 01:10:27,324
But, uh, I wanted it easy.

1260
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:32,996
I knew what was going on,
about Moretti.

1261
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:38,502
I'd say, it's not me.

1262
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:43,807
I'm just some guy
moving numbers around

1263
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,610
on a computer
in a fucking basement.

1264
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:53,049
But I knew what was happening.

1265
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:56,686
And I'm...
I'm so fucking sorry.

1266
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:02,359
Um...

1267
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,895
The paper that had
our names on it.

1268
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:06,930
You know, with the addresses?

1269
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:09,065
That's my mom's address.

1270
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,734
Hey, don't worry about it.

1271
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:13,236
Could you go to that address,
go see her for me?

1272
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:17,341
Me?

1273
01:11:17,374 --> 01:11:18,875
Yeah, just go see her, please.

1274
01:11:20,544 --> 01:11:22,479
Tell her I did something,
you know,

1275
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,615
that was good.

1276
01:11:25,649 --> 01:11:27,451
Just tell her I did
something good.

1277
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:31,154
I don't know,
make some shit up, whatever.

1278
01:11:33,557 --> 01:11:37,093
Just, it would mean
a lot to her.

1279
01:11:39,563 --> 01:11:40,630
Please.

1280
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:45,669
Yeah. All right,
I'll tell her.

1281
01:11:46,403 --> 01:11:47,404
Okay.

1282
01:11:48,405 --> 01:11:49,573
Okay.

1283
01:11:57,514 --> 01:11:58,982
I did the right thing.

1284
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,303
- US Marshals.
- Janine, it's Madolyn.

1285
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,939
I need you to put me
through to Caroline Van Sant.

1286
01:12:22,972 --> 01:12:25,509
Oh. Um... Uh...

1287
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:27,844
- Janine?
- Yes, one... one moment.

1288
01:12:30,146 --> 01:12:32,048
Harris, Coleridge here.

1289
01:12:33,216 --> 01:12:34,584
Coleridge.

1290
01:12:34,618 --> 01:12:35,819
I'll take it
from here, Janine.

1291
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,554
Thank you.

1292
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:40,457
Look, I'm afraid it looks
like you were right

1293
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,492
about Deputy
Van Sant, Madolyn.

1294
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:45,261
There was a car crash

1295
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:48,031
and she was T-boned
leaving the office.

1296
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:50,667
Madolyn...

1297
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:53,670
She's dead.

1298
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:55,672
Oh.

1299
01:12:58,475 --> 01:13:00,444
I'm so very sorry, Madolyn.

1300
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:02,278
Fuck!

1301
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:04,948
Well, I know
the other driver fled.

1302
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:06,550
One of Moretti's,
I'm guessing.

1303
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:07,984
I'm headed over there
right now.

1304
01:13:08,017 --> 01:13:09,553
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1305
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:13,623
They must've been waiting
or I don't know.

1306
01:13:13,657 --> 01:13:16,493
Whatever I could do,
however I can help, please.

1307
01:13:16,526 --> 01:13:18,528
I know the two of you
were very close.

1308
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:20,664
- No wonder you're in charge.
- What did you say?

1309
01:13:20,697 --> 01:13:22,866
You got this all wrapped up,
haven't you?

1310
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:25,134
You got this all figured out.

1311
01:13:25,168 --> 01:13:26,470
Excuse me?

1312
01:13:26,503 --> 01:13:28,171
I know it was you.

1313
01:13:28,204 --> 01:13:30,206
I'm not sure where you're
going with this, Madolyn.

1314
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,408
25 grand a month?

1315
01:13:32,442 --> 01:13:34,143
Check your records.
You got sloppy.

1316
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:36,480
Oh, you wanna compare records,
Deputy Harris?

1317
01:13:36,513 --> 01:13:38,648
No one is gonna believe
a word you say.

1318
01:13:38,682 --> 01:13:39,816
A jury will.

1319
01:13:39,849 --> 01:13:41,818
- Careful, Harris.
- Careful?

1320
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:43,487
- Be very careful, Harris.
- Careful?

1321
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,354
You think I got
something to lose?

1322
01:13:45,388 --> 01:13:46,756
God damn it!
You're going fucking crazy.

1323
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:48,357
Fuck you! Careful.

1324
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:50,527
- Listen to me.
- You be fucking careful.

1325
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,562
Deputy, talk to me,
god damn it.

1326
01:13:52,596 --> 01:13:54,063
- Calm down, Harris.
- 

1327
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:56,533
My pilot's calling. Fuck you.

1328
01:13:56,566 --> 01:13:58,201
I'll see you in New York.

1329
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:00,537
Hassan.

1330
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:02,338
Guess who we've got on radar.

1331
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:03,707
Thank God.

1332
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:06,009
You're 11 miles out
and looking good, Deputy.

1333
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:07,176
Good.

1334
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:08,411
Hey, do me a favor.

1335
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,679
Hang up,
put your headphones on,

1336
01:14:09,713 --> 01:14:12,949
and turn your radio
to frequency 121.5.

1337
01:14:12,982 --> 01:14:14,818
Okay. Okay.

1338
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:21,591
Okay, hear me?

1339
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:22,959
Handsome, confident,

1340
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:25,595
ATC controller looking
for an intrepid pilot.

1341
01:14:25,629 --> 01:14:26,896
Handsome, huh?

1342
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:28,832
Land the damn plane
and see for yourself.

1343
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,168
All right, Deputy,
let's bring it in.

1344
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:34,103
Okay.

1345
01:14:39,576 --> 01:14:40,677
Winston.

1346
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:42,278
Hey, hey, Winston.

1347
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,583
- Almost there.
- Good.

1348
01:14:51,354 --> 01:14:53,122
You!

1349
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:55,592
Stupid.
Why didn't you kill me?

1350
01:14:57,193 --> 01:14:59,128
Hey! Why didn't
you just kill me?

1351
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:00,664
Because I'm not like you.

1352
01:15:00,697 --> 01:15:03,032
Oh, yeah?

1353
01:15:03,066 --> 01:15:04,634
I'm gonna tear you apart

1354
01:15:04,668 --> 01:15:07,604
into tiny little
fucking pieces.

1355
01:15:07,637 --> 01:15:08,838
They're gonna need
the entire forensics team

1356
01:15:08,872 --> 01:15:09,939
to identify you.

1357
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:13,743
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy it too.

1358
01:15:13,777 --> 01:15:15,211
I might be high, but...

1359
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,549
Is that another plane?

1360
01:15:30,393 --> 01:15:32,195
Hassan.

1361
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:34,764
There's a plane tailing us.
Looks military.

1362
01:15:34,798 --> 01:15:36,933
Yes, solid copy.
It's one of ours.

1363
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:38,134
They're going
to keep you company

1364
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:39,703
the rest of the way.

1365
01:15:39,736 --> 01:15:41,370
It's a little protection.

1366
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:43,472
That's good.

1367
01:15:45,141 --> 01:15:46,242
Protection?

1368
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:48,678
What? You think...

1369
01:15:48,712 --> 01:15:49,879
You think it's there to help?

1370
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:55,384
How exactly is it
supposed to do that?

1371
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:57,721
It's there to protect
everyone else from you.

1372
01:15:57,754 --> 01:15:59,055
In case you veer off course

1373
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:00,489
and crash into
a school or something.

1374
01:16:00,523 --> 01:16:03,059
- It's there to shoot you down.
- You're full of shit.

1375
01:16:04,928 --> 01:16:06,395
Who would you
rather lose, huh?

1376
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:08,397
The three of us?

1377
01:16:08,431 --> 01:16:09,999
Or a bunch of kiddies
playing patty cake

1378
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:11,234
in a schoolyard playground?

1379
01:16:11,267 --> 01:16:12,501
Hell, Twig.

1380
01:16:12,535 --> 01:16:14,638
Ain't you some kind of
accountant or something?

1381
01:16:14,671 --> 01:16:15,972
Do the math, you dumb fuck.

1382
01:16:16,005 --> 01:16:18,074
He's full of shit. Right?

1383
01:16:18,107 --> 01:16:20,176
It's not gonna happen.

1384
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:21,210
We're going to land
this thing.

1385
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:26,015
Don't worry.
I'm gonna land the plane.

1386
01:16:29,853 --> 01:16:31,855
I'm gonna enjoy this.

1387
01:16:31,888 --> 01:16:34,724
Hey, I see it.
Hassan, I see the runway.

1388
01:16:34,758 --> 01:16:36,660
Solid copy.
Got visual on my end.

1389
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:37,927
Flight path is good.

1390
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:42,632
Okay. Passing 1,500 feet.
Air speed's at 90 knots.

1391
01:16:45,068 --> 01:16:47,170
- Hassan?
- Yeah, I'm here.

1392
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:49,205
Deputy, there's a crosswind
that kicked up.

1393
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:51,407
I recommend
we try a practice run.

1394
01:16:54,811 --> 01:16:56,412
Winston.

1395
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,247
Winston.

1396
01:16:58,281 --> 01:16:59,916
Your chances of
a successful landing

1397
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:01,450
improve with a practice run.

1398
01:17:01,484 --> 01:17:04,120
He's not gonna make it.
I barely feel a pulse.

1399
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:05,421
- Still...
- We gotta land now.

1400
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:08,892
I'm just trying
to bring you home,

1401
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:10,626
but you're the pilot
in command.

1402
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,328
It's your call.

1403
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:16,933
There's no time.
I'm not losing him.

1404
01:17:17,934 --> 01:17:19,302
I'm landing this plane.

1405
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:24,207
I'm gonna enjoy this.
I'm gonna enjoy this.

1406
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,909
Okay. You are clear to land.

1407
01:17:25,942 --> 01:17:27,043
Line up your nose
with the spot

1408
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:28,277
on the near edge of the runway

1409
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:30,413
and cut your throttle
back to 25%.

1410
01:17:33,683 --> 01:17:35,451
Throttle to 25.

1411
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,953
I'm gonna enjoy this.

1412
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,331
Deputy, altitude.

1413
01:17:48,364 --> 01:17:52,435
Altitude's at, uh, 1,000 feet.

1414
01:17:52,468 --> 01:17:54,003
- Flaps to full.
- Flaps.

1415
01:17:55,271 --> 01:17:57,440
I don't... I don't see flaps.

1416
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:05,114
Hassan, where are the flaps?

1417
01:18:05,148 --> 01:18:06,916
It's there. A round gray lever

1418
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:08,852
just to the right
of the throttle.

1419
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:11,888
Got it. Flaps to full.

1420
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:26,135
All right, Winston.
We're almost there.

1421
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:29,806
Get off me!

1422
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:31,808
Deputy, okay, even out.
You're drifting.

1423
01:18:31,841 --> 01:18:34,610
I ain't going to no prison.
You hear me?

1424
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:37,646
Deputy, you copy?
You're drifting off course.

1425
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,815
You need to even out.

1426
01:18:43,186 --> 01:18:45,354
What the hell
is going on up there?

1427
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:46,823
Are those gunshots?

1428
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:49,926
Deputy! Deputy!

1429
01:18:51,327 --> 01:18:54,030
Deputy Harris,
are you still up?

1430
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:57,166
- Yeah, yeah, I'm here.
- Oh, thank God.

1431
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,202
Okay, okay.
You're doing great.

1432
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:01,004
- Now back to business.
- Oh, shit.

1433
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:03,572
The engine just died.
Hassan, the engine.

1434
01:19:03,606 --> 01:19:05,174
That is because
you are out of fuel.

1435
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:07,210
That's a good thing.
You are less flammable.

1436
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:09,412
Oh. Oh, that's a relief.

1437
01:19:09,445 --> 01:19:11,747
Besides, you don't need
the engine to land.

1438
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:14,250
- It's probably easier without.
- Oh, fuck.

1439
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:16,419
Just keep it steady.
We are nearly there.

1440
01:19:16,452 --> 01:19:17,520
Okay.

1441
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:20,056
Deputy, still good?

1442
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:23,426
Yeah. Yeah. Passing 600 feet.

1443
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:26,362
This crosswind is
knocking you off course.

1444
01:19:26,395 --> 01:19:29,165
Step on the right rudder pedal
until you straighten out.

1445
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:31,667
- You mean the left?
- No, it's the opposite.

1446
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:32,768
Oh, my God.

1447
01:19:34,037 --> 01:19:36,605
Okay, better! Hold that line.

1448
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:39,375
- All right.
- 500 feet.

1449
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,879
Oh.

1450
01:19:42,912 --> 01:19:44,580
Pull back
on the yoke slightly.

1451
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:45,949
Okay.

1452
01:19:51,821 --> 01:19:53,923
100 feet. You got this.
Good luck.

1453
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:55,091
Wait, that's it?

1454
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:56,292
I'll see you on the ground.

1455
01:19:56,325 --> 01:19:58,561
We got a date.
I'll pick you up at 6:05.

1456
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:02,065
20 feet. 10 feet.

1457
01:20:02,598 --> 01:20:03,599
Touchdown.

1458
01:20:05,401 --> 01:20:06,435
Oh, fuck!

1459
01:21:22,511 --> 01:21:23,512
Hey, Winston.

1460
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,716
Winston. Winston!

1461
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,352
Okay.

1462
01:21:32,188 --> 01:21:33,256
Hey.

1463
01:21:35,758 --> 01:21:37,360
Oh, cool. Did we land?

1464
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:42,065
Yeah, we did.

1465
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:44,934
Good job.

1466
01:21:46,802 --> 01:21:48,304
Ma'am, are you okay?
Are you hurt?

1467
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:50,206
No, no, no. I'm not hurt.

1468
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,641
Take him fast.
He's been stabbed twice.

1469
01:21:52,675 --> 01:21:54,177
He's lost a lot of blood.

1470
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:57,380
Hey, we had another passenger.
Where did he go?

1471
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,215
I'm sorry, ma'am.
He was flung from the plane.

1472
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:00,349
He didn't make it.

1473
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:03,286
Thank God.

1474
01:22:04,787 --> 01:22:06,355
Okay, easy with him.

1475
01:22:06,389 --> 01:22:08,591
- Nice and easy. Ready?
- He's lost a lot of blood.

1476
01:22:08,624 --> 01:22:10,693
- God.
- There we go.

1477
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:37,053
Fuck off.

1478
01:22:51,134 --> 01:22:52,268
- Yeah, I'm good.
- You okay?

1479
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,437
Thank you. I'm fine.
Thank you.

1480
01:24:06,075 --> 01:24:09,078
What the fuck? Oh, my God.

1481
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,180
This fucking day.

1482
01:24:12,248 --> 01:24:13,382
Okay.

1483
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:14,517
Milko!

1484
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,219
Milko, what the hell's
going on there?

1485
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:17,786
I said no gunshots.

1486
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,955
I'm gonna ship you
back to Bulgaria,

1487
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:21,190
you fucking moron!

1488
01:24:21,224 --> 01:24:22,758
Pick up. Pick up.

1489
01:24:23,926 --> 01:24:26,462
Milko, is it done?

1490
01:24:26,495 --> 01:24:29,465
No, Director Coleridge,
it's not done.

1491
01:24:29,498 --> 01:24:31,667
- Harris?
- But you are.
