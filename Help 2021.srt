Being a carer is all about...

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,880
..acknowledging and, you know,
preserving the residents' dignity.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,160
You know, I've been told,
I've been told before

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,800
that I'm very good at making people
feel comfortable.

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,920
Very, you know, I'm very social,

like to have a

Don't say you like have laugh.

She's not your mate.

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,480
Ow!

00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,520

WHISPERING: -- Follow me. Be quick.

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,680
Go on, then.

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,640
We've been given the honour

24
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,600
of getting tea and that
for the candidate.

25
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
-- You're the only candidate.

26
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,160
-- Er, tea, please, yeah.

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,400
Ta.

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,760
-- Milk and sugar?
--One and a half, please.

29
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,920
-- You mean two.
--No, she means one and a half.

30
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,760
-- That's not a number, is it?

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,560
-- Well, it is a number,
it's one and a half.

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,440
I'm sorry. He's rude.

33
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,880
I'm Tony, by the way.

34
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,240
He's Kenny.

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,960
-- After Kenny Dalglish, easy.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,640
Where he's named after milkman
his mum used to play dominoes with.

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,400
-- Ask him how old he is, ask him when
Dalglish made his debut.

38
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,320
-- My dad was a fortune teller.

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,520
A point to me. -- Tit.

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,600
-- Sarah, is it? -- Yeah.

41
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,800
-- Thank you, lads.

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,560
So what brings you
to residential care?

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,960
-- Well, I've got me Level 1

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,200
in Preparing to Work in Adult Social
Care... -- Going to stop you there.

45
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,160
This job is about treating
people with dignity.

46
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,080
-- Of course.
--This is their home that we work in.

47
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,200
So I'm not just employing any old
knobby-knobstopper to wipe an arse.

48
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
-- Have I upset you?

49
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,880
-- You sent your CV and,
well, your skills are joking

50
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,480
and your work's not much better.

51
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,320
-- You know, I just... I haven't found
a good fit,

52
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,000
and I think,
given the opportunity...

53
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,680
-- You think 53 hours of your Level 1
makes you ready for this?

54
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,120
-- Did I say that? -- Cos you
might be trusted to pull a pint,

55
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,640
but sitting with a scared old man
while he's trying to work out

56
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,200
what a fork is...
--All right, Alan Sugar!

57
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,320
Yeah, you see me,
but I see you as well.

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,200
-- Do you know how many people... -- You
came in here absolutely certain...

59
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,440
-- ..with this precious Level 1...
--..I was a waste of time.

60
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,360
-- ..and they last no more than I week.
--Well, I won't even last that long.

61
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,160
Stick your job.

62
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,920
Do you know, me grandad had
Alzheimer's and I was only young,

63
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,920
but I remember...I remember singing
and dancing with him and I thought,

64
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,400
"Do you know, if I can help someone
else like that,

65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,120
"maybe I'll feel less like shit."

66
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,240
So I understand dignity.

67
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,720
But from the way that you've carried
on, I'm not sure that you do.

68
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,120
-- You'll do fine.

69
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,080
You can start Monday. -- Whatever.

70
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,400
-- I was baiting you.

71

74
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
-- Stop!

75
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,200
You wanted tea.

76
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm not supposed to be out
here unsupervised,

77
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,040
but I learnt the door code

78
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
and I wrote it down.

79
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,600
-- OK. -- They'll change the code now.

80
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,560
That's all right. I'll risk that.

81
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Cos I like you.

82
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,960
-- WHISPERS: Fucking hell.

83
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,880
-- Tony!

84
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,040
Tony, come on, lad.

85
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,560
In!

86
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,800
-- Ta-ra.

87
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,920
-- I'll see you Monday.

88
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,080
-- So?

89
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,360
-- I got it.

90
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,080
-- Look at you! -- What's that screaming?
--She got the job, Bob.

91
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,520
-- I'll give her five minutes before
she fucks it. -- Bob, don't.

92
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,200
-- I say it, you think it.

93
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,080
-- I won't mess up, not this time.
--Did you take the car? -- Yeah.

94
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,080
-- She took the car today. It's my
turn. -- Well, she had her interview.

95
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,480
-- Doesn't mean she can take my keys.
--I paid for the car.

96
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,160
-- Car's for all the family.
Messed up there, didn't you?

97
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,600
-- And what did you do today, Dad, eh?

98
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,320
Did you scratch your right bollock
or left? -- I see you...

99
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,840
..even if she doesn't.

Where are you going?

106
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,040
-- You get nothing.

107
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,640
-- Don't I now?

108
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,280
-- Bill's just delivering the post,
if you'll excuse us? -- Yeah.

109
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,280
-- Nothing for her. -- No, love, not yet.

110
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,400
-- Any for me, Bill?

111
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,440
I'll take that as a no.

112
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,800
Follow me to the office, please.

113
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,360
So what we have here
is a one week induction...

114
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,120
..with two days training
on the floor.

115
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,880
The first six weeks of probationary
but I'll do my best by you.

116
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,760
Nights, you know,
they're generally OK.

117
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,840
I've switched my shifts
so I can be doing your induction,

118
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,800
so it's all joined up.

119
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,520
Right, uniform.

120
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
Me mum chose the colour.

121
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,800
Used to be hers, all this. -- OK.

122
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,880
-- I think it makes it look like you
work in a tuck shop

123
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,680
or on Play School or whatever shit
they watch these days,

124
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,880
I haven't got kids.

125
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,720
I'll let you get changed, then,
and when I come back,

126
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,000
give you the guided tour,
lay out a few don'ts and do's.

Hello, my name's Steve Frobisher.

134
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,840
I'm calling from
Bright Sky Care Home.

135
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,000
One of our residents
has gone missing.

136
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,480
His name is Tony Connell.

137
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,560
He's 47 years old.

138
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,320
He has young onset Alzheimer's.

139
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,240
Jeans and a blue jacket, I think.

140
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,280
Well, he hasn't been seen since tea.

141
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,760
Yeah, thank you. All right.

142
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,920
Well, someone will be here to answer
this number.

143
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,960
-- CLICKS FINGERS
--OK, thank you. OK, thank you. Bye.

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,200
You with me now. -- But... -- Come on.

145
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
-- Ooh!

146
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,960
-- I know where he'll probably be -
he'll have gone to his mum's.

147
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,680
Have you got this?
Cos I need her with me.

148
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,240
-- Well, there's only two of us.
Are you kidding? -- We'll be quick.

149
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,440
-- My feet hurt.

150
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,280
-- Oh, that's because you've been
walking over my heart all day, pal.

151
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,880
Come on, let's have a sit-down.

152
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
-- You'll know her...

153
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,520
..by her foot

154
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,360
The smallest gamboge hand

155
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,120
Fingers where the toes should be

156
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,920
Would more affront the sand.

157
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,040
-- That's beautiful.

158
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,400
This is his route.

159
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,600
I can't watch for him, you can,
both windows.

160
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,000
You remember his face, right?

161
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,320
-- He's a bit young, isn't he,
for all this?

162
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,000
-- It happens more than you think,
you know.

163
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,960
Probably been ill for a while with
the Alzheimer's,

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,720
but his mum was masking it.

165
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,880
Anyway, she dies and he sets fire
to the back kitchen,

166
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,720
ends up walking down the
street half naked. -- Shit.

167
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,160
-- Police pick him up and he's like,
"Don't touch me, don't touch me!"

168
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,040
You know the sort of thing? -- No.

169
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,400
-- A few evaluations later and a brain
scan or two and he moves in with us.

170
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,800
He's a lovely fellow...

171
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,000
..but can't keep him still for
love nor money.

172
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,080
-- There.

173
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,240
There he is.

174
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,200
There. -- Good girl, good girl.

175
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,720
-- INDICATOR CLICKS

176
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,360
-- Tony, come on, mate.

177
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,520
Tony! Tony!

178
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,760
Come on. -- Going back to me ma.

179
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,240
-- Tony, come on, mate. -- Get your
fucking hands off me, will ya?!

180
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,280
-- Tony, come on. You're going
to get me into trouble

181
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,920
with the police again
like last time.

182
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,160
-- Who the fuck are you to talk
to me like that? -- Tony...

183
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,560
You're just confused, mate.
--Do you want to go? -- Come on.

184
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,720
It's only Steve.
--I was expecting a big hello here

185
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,800
and this is what you do.

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,320
One and a half sugars.

187
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,280
-- I've got to get back to me ma.

188
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,640
She needs me.

189
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,600
She worries about me
when I'm not there.

190
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,520
-- Why, were you a naughty boy at
school, was you?

191
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,840
-- Sometimes, yeah. -- Oh, she had a right
to worry, then, didn't she?

192
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
SHE CHUCKLES

193
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,480
-- Well, do you want to come back
to ours?

194
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,000
Me ma makes the best scouse
in the world.

195
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,800
-- Oh, I love scouse,
especially with a load of HP.

196
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
Can you tell me her recipe?

197
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,760
-- No, she'd rather die.

198
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,680
She is dead, isn't she?

199
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
-- HE SNIFFLES

200
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,040
-- I forgot me ma was dead.

201
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,560
-- We're going to take you home, Tony.

202
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,920
-- I'm going home. -- Somebody else
lives there now, Tony.

203
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,400
The council, they've given that to
someone else.

204
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,760
-- You have a bed in a home with us -
Bright Sky Homes, do you remember?

205
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
Bright Sky.

Fierce player, Souness, wasn't he?
--Yeah.

214
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,720
-- He was me favourite.

215
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,320
-- HE EXHALES

216
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,640
Come on, Tony.

00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,640
Hey, come and show me your poster.

218
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,320
Hmm?

00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,600
You all right? -- Oh, hey.

221
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,720
So, we've got six breakfasts due,
and we're behind on feeds.

222
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,640
-- How did we get behind on feeds?

223
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,160
-- Needed a hand with the
meds order. We're behind.

224
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,000
Seniors are behind, we're behind.

225
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,320
Do you want to make a start
on Gloria's pad change?

226
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,920
Then lead on to Hercules' breakfast?

227
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,600
-- Oh, yeah, I get pads, do I?

228
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,200
-- What, you think she'll let me do it?

229
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,160
-- OK, time for downstairs.

230
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,320
-- I know.

231
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,960
-- Oh, I've got a joke
about that, actually.

232
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,360
-- About my bits? -- No!

233
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,280
But it is a bit naughty.

234
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,520
-- I like naughty. -- OK.

235
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,720
Now, there's this little boy called
Liam, and he goes downstairs

236
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,480
in the middle of the night and he
asks his dad for a cup of water...

237
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,880
-- Oh, they do that.

238
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,840
-- And his dad says,
"Jesus, Liam, that's the 15th one

239
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,360
"you've asked for tonight."

240
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,440
-- Oh, it's difficult
when they won't asleep.

241
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,400
-- And he says,
"I know it's the 15th, Dad,

242
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,640
"but me room's still on fire."

243
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,480
It's not a great joke.

244
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,520
Are you ready for me
to start downstairs now?

245
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
-- Will you tell me that joke again?

246
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,720
-- There's this little boy
called Liam... -- Yes.

247
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,920
-- ..and he goes downstairs
in the middle of the night,

248
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,280

00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,080
OK, Hercules.

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,720
I need you to pop your teeth in
before we do breakfast.

252
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,040
You don't like me doing it.

253
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,200
You bit me last time.
Do you remember?

Eh?

264

therein such present joys I find,

266
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,960
that it excels all other bliss
that Earth affords

267
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,600
or grows by kind.

Through much I want that
most do have,

269
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,960
yet still my mind forbids to crave.

270
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,240
No princely pomp, no wealthy store,

271
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,240
no force to win the victory,

272
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,160
no wily wit to salve a sore,

273
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,960
no shape to feed a loving eye.

274
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,440
To none of these I yield as thrall.

275
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,120
For why?

276
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,400
My mind doth serve for all.

277
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,480
I see how plenty surfeits oft,

278
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,200
and hasty climbers soon do fall.

279
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,200
I see those that are aloft,

280
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,360
mischanche may threaten most of all.

281
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,880
They get with toil,
they keep with fear.

282
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,040
Such cares my mind could never bear.

283
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,000

They always tell people
to take the Christmas shift.

286

Not only is the pay better,
but you actually have a good time.

287
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,360

288
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,040

was beautiful, Pol.

294

who succumbed to her lover's desire.

296
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,760

OK, calm down, mate.
--Just get her away from me.

-- Please, Dad, it's OK.
--You're all right. It's all right.

LAUGHTER FROM TV

GLORIA: -- She was out of
her mind with grief,

310
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,680
and guilt, Catholic guilt...

311
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,560
It was all weird. But I just
think she lived with the guilt.

312
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,160
-- No visitors?

313
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,640
-- Well, don't say that.

314
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,120
It's crowded enough in here
with just me, myself and I.

315
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,840
You off home?

316
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,320
-- In a bit.

-- Do you know how to play Shithead?

318
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,800
-- LAUGHING: What?

319
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,760
-- It's a simple game, really.

320
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,760
You deal three card blind,
three cards facing,

321
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,600
and you get three cards
in your hand.

322
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,560
Right, the aim of the game is to
get rid of all your cards.

323
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,520
Yeah? -- OK.

324
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,000
-- Highest card wins.

325
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,240
If you can't go higher,
then you pick up from the pile.

326
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,440
Only cards that'll do you
different is two - which means

327
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,560
you start again from two
- or seven.

328
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,000
If I play a seven,
you have to play lower then.

329
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,520
Or a ten, which is like a magic
card, a ten clears the whole pile.

330
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,240
Capishe?
--How do you remember all of that?

331
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,240
-- It's all right.
Yeah, we'll pick up as we go along.

332
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,360
I never was a big fan of...

333
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,520
It'll come to me.

334
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,240
Christmas.

335
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,880
-- Well, why weren't you a fan?

336
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,720
-- Well, when my dad left,
it was just me and Aunt Trisha.

337
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,960
We had to look after me mum.

338
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,600
That was hard.

339
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,640
Some days it was really messy.

340
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,880
And then after that doctor gave her
her tablets, then...

341
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,600
..she never left the couch.

342
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,440
-- I remember one Christmas me Dad
didn't get me anything.

343
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,680
No presents.

"if she weren't a good girl,
she weren't going to get shit."

-- And were you?

347
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,840
Was you a good girl?

348
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,640
-- Well, I was in PRU at
the time, so...

349

Oh, it's a pupil referral unit.

350

It's...it's basically where
they put kids no school wants.

No! But I was 12!

353
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,240

get presents. Don't you?

-- Yeah. -- Yeah, well, the worst thing
was me mum went along with it.

355
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,960
She's just as bad.

356
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,080

-- "Proper bad girl."

358
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,840
I did some damage.

359
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,880
-- Primary school,
I'd lost me bouncy ball,

360
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,040
and the teacher couldn't find it,
so I smashed every single light

361
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,160
in the classroom and got
suspended for two weeks.

362
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,720
-- Oh, school disco, Sonia Sherbet.

363
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,000
Well, she called me a slag
because I had boobs before her.

364
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,200

-- GCSE, Maths.

367
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,040
I turned up late and I told my
teacher I didn't have me...

368
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,160
..ne calculator, me ruler,
and me, erm...

369

-- Pen. -- Pen, yeah, yeah.

370
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,040
So, erm... So he said
to me I was too late

371
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,680
and he'd given them all out, so...
I knocked him out.

off the caretaker,

376
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,480
and I let these mates of mine in...

377
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,920
..and they cleared out every
computer they could find.

been sent away. -- Yeah.

he didn't say anything, because...

sucking him off at the time.

A simple game, really.

389
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,480
You deal three cards blind,

390

then three cards facing,

391
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,360
then three cards in your hand.

392
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,840
Then the aim of the game is
to clear all your cards, yeah?

393

Careful of that.

Sodium powder and piss.

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,000
keeping the residents apart,
so we have to do a lockdown

487
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,720
inside the home.
--But we carry it between them.

not to carry it between them.

512
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,280
-- You're not supposed to be going out.

513
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,040
-- You can cut the holier than thou
crap. You're going to work.

514
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,240
-- I'm supposed to be in work.
I'm needed in work.

515
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,000
-- Yeah, and they've all got it,
and you're bringing it here,

516
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,160
so what's the problem? -- Because your
divvy mates could infect you,

517
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,040
which could infect me, which
could then infect my residents.

518
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,480
-- It's such shit. I'm young. I need to
live my life - do something with it.

519
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,440
-- Yeah, you're really doing something
with your life, aren't you?

520
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,000
-- Hey, hey, hey.
You sound like your dad.

521
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,000
-- It's her, saying I can't go out.

522
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,480
-- If he infects me
and then I infect them.

523
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,800
-- Well, there's a solution to that,
isn't there?

524
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,720
Don't look at me like that.

525
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,800

before, we can cope again.

527

I'll get you fed as soon as I can.
--I don't want to be fed.

--The lounge is closed.

--You can't be here right now.

-- We'll sort something out, OK?
--I need to see him now. Let us in.

542
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,640
-- Maybe you can talk to him
through the window.

543
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,320
It's for the best for everyone.
--It's not for me, is it, Steve?

544
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,240

--We're just not allowed in.

--No, no, we can't...

He just needed calming.

-- Good news and bad news.

I always made sure I was the one
who cleaned her up,

you know, gave her her dignity
with the other members of staff,

600
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,880
cos they were her employees
and they shouldn't be the ones

01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,880
-- Morning.

1032
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:05,200
I've come to change your bedding.

1033
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,560
And then let's get you some
breakfast, shall we?

1034
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,800
Tony?

1035
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,400
What's Tony on?

1036
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,600
-- What do you mean? -- What the
fuck have you put Tony on?

1037
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,160
-- It's a new regime.
It's prescribed. -- Yeah, but why?

1038
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,320
-- Sarah, I know you're still
quite new to this

1039
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,960
and you've had a very hard time...

1040
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,640
-- No, fuck off back home
if you're just going to drug him!

1041
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:53,840
-- He tried to escape again.

1042
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,520
He's a constant flight risk,
so we spoke with Dr McCavitt

1043
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,680
and devised a new patient plan for
Tony. -- We just need to watch him.

1044
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,520
We've always watched him before.
His brain is still good, Steve.

1045
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,400
Can't be doing this.
--I've seen this before.

1046
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,760
Over-associating with patients.

1047
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,200
-- They're not patients,
they are residents.

1048
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,960
And they're mostly fucking dead.

1049
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,200
Right?

1050
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,560
You are slowing him down
when he needs his wits about him.

1051
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,080
He's got a good head on him,
Steve. You just leave him be.

1052
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,720
-- You've been doing this,
what, five months.

1053
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,960
I've been pushing this rock up
a hill for a little bit longer,

1054
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
so watch out till you...

1055
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:25,520
-- Please, take him off the drugs,
no more needs to be said.

1056
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,840
-- Why does he matter
so much to you, eh?

1057
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,240
-- Because he is a good man.

1058
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,120
Which is really fucking rare.

1059
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,960
-- And I'm a bad man, am I? -- I believe
you care about them, Steve.

1060
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,680
I really do.

1061
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,360
And none of this is your fault.

1062
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,320
But you do this, and you are just
like the rest of them.

1063
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,160
-- You're exhausted.
--Yeah, I am, actually.

1064
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,840
-- And the home can cope without
you for a week or two, so go home,

1065
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,440
have a rest, have a good think about
whether this is what you want.

1066
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,480
-- Sacking me? -- No, I'm simply letting
you know that we don't have any
hours for you next we

1067
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,680
With a reduced number of residents,
we have reduced income.

1068
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,920
-- They are reduced cos they died,
Steve.

1069
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,720
-- Yeah, and I'm trying to keep
this fucking place

1070
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,000
going for the ones that are left,
Sarah!

1071
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,840
Finish your shift
and then give me a call

1072
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:20,040
when you had a little bit of think
about the situation, will you?

1073
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,360
-- Yeah. -- Put your mask back on.

RADIO: -- Good afternoon and welcome
to Downing Street for the daily

1146
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,280
coronavirus briefing.

1147
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,680
I want to tell you what we've
been doing to protect

1148
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,360
people in care homes throughout
the crisis.

1149
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,960
Right from the start it's been clear
that this horrible virus

1150
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,280
affects older people most. So, right
from the start we've tried to

1151
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:57,440
throw a protective ring around
our care homes.

1152
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:01,160
We set out our first
advice in February

1153
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:04,880
and as the virus grew,
we strengthened it throughout.

1154
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,280
We made sure that care homes
have the resources

1155
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:10,000
they need to control the spread
of infection.

1156
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,040
Social care is a devolved matter...

1157
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:27,560
-- It's lovely, that.

1158
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,440
I've always said you can't beat
bread and butter.

1159
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,320
-- Yeah.

1160
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,400
Dad, you can get out of here.

1161
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,000
-- Now, don't get dramatic. -- Nah, I mean
it. I mean it, Dad, just go.

1162
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,160
-- You're quite the cover girl, do you
know that? -- What?

01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,720
-- Well, front page of the Echo you
were last week. "Covid on the run."

to fuck it up for me?

1165
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,240
-- I remembered Nana took you
caravanning round here once.

1166
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:08,280
What did you...? Did you break into
the vans? -- Please. Please go away.

1167
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,120
-- Always with the fucking drama!

people's dreams.

Where is he?

-- We've done ten days.

1171
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,040
We only need to do four more. -- What?

1172
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,800
-- We just need to get to 14 days
and then I'll make them put him

1173
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:32,960
somewhere different.

1174
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,200
-- This is quarantine?

1175
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,520
-- Well, for 14 days, that's all that
matters, isn't it?

1176
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,280
That's what they say.

1177
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,000
You know, they'll know he doesn't
have it, then, and I think...

1178
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:48,360
I'm sure he will be allowed to go...

1179
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,320
He'll be allowed to go
somewhere different.

1180

-- You're a mad cow.

1181
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:02,440
-- You always say that.
--Because you fucking are!

1182
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,520
-- We had 20 residents when
this started.

1183
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,720
Got given eight more.

1184
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,120
We lost nine.

1185
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,360
12 more had the bug.

1186
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,360
They've been dying off,
one by one, Dad.

1187
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:26,160
No.

1188
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,760
The thought of leaving him
like that...

1189
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,600
-- What do you need?

1190
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,920
-- Money.

1191
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:46,560
No... Uh, food. Just normal food.

1192
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,840
-- Fucking hell.

1193
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,040
-- Steady, all right?

1194
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:05,040
-- What's going on? -- Right foot. Ooh!
There you go.

1195
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:08,560
Left foot down. Next step. Perfect.

1196
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,040
Don't get your hopes up, all right?

1197
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,240
But it's something, do you know
what I mean?

1198
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,720
-- Where are you taking me? To
the firing squad or something?

1199
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:21,920
-- Sit down.

1200
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:27,560
-- What's going on?
--Just wait, will you?

01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,000
Woohoo-hoo!

1202
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,440
Ta-da!

1203
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,080
-- What is it you did?

1204
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,680
-- The cards.

1205
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:55,840
That'll be telling.

1206
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:58,440
Now...

1207
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,640
Do you know how to play shitter?

1208
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,160
-- HE CHUCKLES

1209
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:05,800
Is this me surprise?

1210
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,800
-- Yeah. Do you like it? -- Yeah.

1211
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:16,240
-- Do you know? I've never done much of
this before.

1212
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:19,920
To think the world we know
and it's all over. Walking.

1213
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:25,200
Seeing. Shift-free for one thing.

1214
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:30,640
-- We went on holiday when I was a kid.
--Oh. Where did you go?

1215
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,520
-- Donegal.

1216
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:43,440
-- Oh, Donegal. -- Donegal. Yeah.
Yeah, me ma had a cousin.

1217
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,600
Left us some money when she died
and she just went, "Fuck it.

1218
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,520
"We're going to Donegal." To this
day, I don't know

1219
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:49,400
why it was Donegal.

1220
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,640
-- Were you there with Trish? -- Yeah.

1221
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,560
You look like her a little
bit, actually.

1222
01:29:58,920 --> 01:29:59,920
Softness.

1223
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:04,920
Can always tell when someone's
a bit soft.

1224
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:07,360
-- I'm not soft. I'm not soft!

1225
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,920
-- I'm saying you are, Sarah.
You're soft. -- Oh, right.

1226
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,200
Hang on a minute.

1227
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:38,680
-- MUSIC: The Fields of Athenry

1228
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,080
I like this one. -- Me, too.

1229
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:48,280
-- This is Sarah's song.
--Yeah, I know. -- Yeah.

1230
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,960
Yeah, you're a blue, though.

1231
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,800
You're Everton. You're Everton.
--Nah! -- Yes, blue nose. "Meh!"

1232
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,640
You're a blue nose.

1233
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:59,400
You are a blue nose.
--Yeah, I am. -- Yeah.

1234
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,160
-- And what? How did you know that?

1235
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,280
How did you know that?
--Because I can smell it.

1236
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,200
-- I thought I had you. -- No, you didn't.

1237
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:13,200
Hasn't put me off you, though.

1238
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,200
I love you, actually.

1239
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:26,800
-- I love you, too.

1240
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:33,880
-- # Our love was on the wing

1241
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,080
# We had dreams and songs to sing

1242
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:44,320
# It's so lonely round the fields
of Athenry

1243
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:50,880
# By a lonely prison wall

1244
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:56,200
# I heard a young man calling... #

1245
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:58,920
-- Shit. Tony, go inside.

1246
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,920
-- Why? -- Go inside.

1247
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,800
Look, can you just...?
Just wait for one minute.

1248
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:09,760
-- Come on now, love. Come here. -- No!
No! No, you don't. No, you don't.

1249
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,200
-- Where are you taking her? -- You're
going to come with me for a minute.

1250
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:14,160
-- I don't want to go with you.
I want to go with Sarah.

1251
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,880
-- You do not have to say anything.
--Tony! -- Sarah!

1252
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,800
-- Tony!

1253
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,680
-- Harm your defence if you do not
mention when questioned something

1254
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:30,680
you later rely on in court. Anything
you do say may be given in evidence.

1255
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:32,760
Do you understand me? -- Please don't
take him back there.

1256
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,640
You don't understand. -- Sarah, you're
in enough trouble as it is,
love. -- Please.

1257
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:38,120
Tony!

1258
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:40,200
Tony, are you OK?

1259
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,200
Come here, mate!

1260
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:45,040
-- Calm down, love. -- Calm down.
--Come on, Sarah.

1261
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:48,120
-- Calm down! Leave him alone.

1262
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,400
-- MUFFLED: Sarah. No, I'm going
with Sarah.

1263
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,160
SHE SNIFFS

1264
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,400
-- Was it me dad who told you?

1265
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:04,840
-- No, some walkers saw you.
Do-gooders, you know.

1266
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:09,440
-- Do-gooders. -- Well, they did good.
Caught you.

1267
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:19,760
-- I need your help. Listen to me. He's
done 12 days. He's nearly safe. -- No.

1268
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,040
-- No, I quarantined him, I did. -- No.

1269
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,520
-- Just radio in and tell them not
to take him back there.

1270
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,160
Take him somewhere else, please.

1271
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:32,480
Please! -- Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me?

1272
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,200
-- Please. -- It's not my
department, love.

1273
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:43,480
-- No. No. No, it never is, is it? Eh?

1274
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:49,080
No, never... Never is. Never is.
It's always someone else.

1275
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,680
It's the way this country works now.

1276
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,840
You know, keep our eyes
down to the rest of it.

1277
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:03,760
You know, cos if we see people
queueing up for food banks

1278
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,920
and if we see people lying...
Lying on the streets,

1279
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:11,320
if we see disabled people being left
to die, we'll feel sorry.

1280
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:17,200
We can't cope. We can't cope with
Tory. Not us.

1281
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:23,560
Not any more. Underlying health
conditions. What's in them?

1282
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:28,880
When did our lives stop being
worth the same, eh?

1283
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,280
Eh?!

1284
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:35,760
-- Come on, Tony.

1285
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,840
-- Come on, mate.

1286
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,120
Welcome home.

1287
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:48,960
-- Where's Sarah?

1288
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,800
-- You don't need to worry about
her right now.

1289
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,600
Come on. Let's just get you in.
Have a nice cup of tea.
