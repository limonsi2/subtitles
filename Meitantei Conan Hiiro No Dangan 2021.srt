Can I spare your time?

00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,330
You're busy
John Foyd (51 tahun) Chief Executive Officer Cod Japan

192
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:55,620
You're busy

193
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,370
Sonoko-san

194
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,370
What happened

195
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,000
that

196
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,790
My father left, he was with me just now

197
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,200
Do you know where he went?

198
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,410
Mr John

199
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,790
I don't know English, Mr. John

200
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,870
This guest asks you not to run

201
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,290
careful

202
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,330
Ran, did I say something wrong?

203
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,250
Edogaw-kun

204
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,700
The blackout only lasts about 30 seconds, right?

205
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,790
The time is very short

206
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,120
Disappear from a place this big

207
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,540
That means it's our turn to perform

208
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,750
It's been a long time since we showed our skills

209
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,450
That's right, too

210
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,250
Our

211
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,450

Sonoko Nee-chan

217
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,000
Please send us the hotel

Inspector Megure

221
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,870
how is it going

222
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,500
We haven't found Chief Suzuki yet.

223
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,660
Oh it's like that

224
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,370
We use hotel broadcast calls

225
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,830
But no response

226
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,870
This might be a kidnapping case

227
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,790
The goal is for ransom

228
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,250
Conan and the others also attended the banquet

229
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,620
Also said that after the power cut

230
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,540
They saw something like a flash of blue and white fire

231
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,580
Let's hear what they have to say

232
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,950
I think that they use that

233
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,750
for seeing on TV series

234
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,500
The bad guys use it to let go

235
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,200
Something that can make people sting

236
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:28,870
Stun gun

237
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,790
Could it be?

238
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,160
Did President Suzuki also fall with the stun gun?

239
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,910
Chief Suzuki too?

240
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,620
But

241
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,000
To get the fainted out of here

242
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,700
30 seconds seems impossible

243
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,870
Have you checked the surveillance video?

244
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,500
Yes

245
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,750
Once the backup power is turned on

246
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,000
We didn't find anyone behaving suspiciously

247
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,910
This is very strange

248
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,370
How to take people out in the dark and crowds?

249
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,580
And what is the purpose of that person?

250
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,870
I should have

251
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,040
What has happened

252
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,660
What did you find?

253
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,660
There is a taste of eel rice

254
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,160
These kids

255
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,040
We were followed all the way from the room

256
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,040
Tell them to come back

257
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,790
Definitely smells like eel

258
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,370
But why no eel rice?

259
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,120
Turns out so

260
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,750
Everyone see here

261
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,500
The food urge seems to be missing one

262
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,290
There should have been food in this place before

263
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,540
let me see

264
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,540
Here it should be

265
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,450
Grilled eel with steamed glutinous rice and azuki bean rice in broth

266
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,870
Sounds so delicious

267
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,330
But this is weird

268
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,290
Why did the food just disappear?

269
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,120
Is it because it's so delicious?

270
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,910
So it was robbed by everyone

271
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
Wrong

272
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,790
Look, down here can hide people

273
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,410
Could it be?

274
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,950
President Suzuki brought with it

275
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,160
It's possible

276
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,620
That way, people can be moved in peace

277
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,870
If so

278
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,750
The culprit is most likely a hotel worker

279
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,540
Or dress up as a hotel staff

280
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,540
Go to the witness to see if anyone is there

281
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,910
Push the eating car out of here

282
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,250
Then check out the hotel surveillance video again

283
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:13,870
Well

284
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,330
You guys hurry back to the room

285
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,200
okay

286
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,620
Here

287
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,700
The smell of eel comes from here

288
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,160
Genta is so cool, like a police dog

289
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,250
I didn't know bell had such an ability

290
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,370
You guys don't know

291
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,120
I think I know

292
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,120
It's so close

293
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,450
The smell is getting stronger

294
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,580
hand soap

295
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,080
No any body here

296
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,080
Because the maids accept being interrogated, right?

297
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,910
How about it, Genta?

298
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,750
It should be in this room

299
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,910
I found it

300
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,870
Really? Haibara-san

301
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,790
Food push ahead

302
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,160
It should be the one that disappeared at the banquet, right?

303
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,330
Wow, found

304
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,500
Why is there a maid uniform here?

305
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,950
Edogaw-kun

306
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,910
President Suzuki is not on this cart

307
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,040
Okay

308
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,040
Great must be delicious

309
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,830
You can't eat it anymore

310
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,580
Kabayaki Sauce

311
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,540
Meet

312

Hospital

313
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,410
What about the suspect's appearance?
Hospital

314
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:46,620
Hospital

315
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,000
I dont see

316
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,040
There was a power outage

317
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,370
I see these children when I wake up

318
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,500
Our Junior Detective Team has done a great job

319
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,250
Yes

320
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,910
Inspector

321
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,410
President Mitsuka's testimony also says so

322
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,620
In other words

323
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,750
Did President Mitsuka have the same experience?

324
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,200
So was this incident really premeditated?

325
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,450
Father, what do you mean by this

326
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,410
The friend I met last week suddenly disappeared

327
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,910
Do you remember

328
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,120
He often plays golf with my dad these days

329
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,790
female president?

330
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,120
Is this the problem? My child's father

331
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,660
Mitsuka Eiko (48 tahun) Presiden Mitsuka Sugar
Is this the problem? My child's father

I don't play with him alone
Mitsuka Eiko (48 tahun) Presiden Mitsuka Sugar

336
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,750
But I remember when the police came

337
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,040
I found it in the stadium bathroom

338
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,120
That's right

339
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,750
But he didn't tell us at all

340
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,500
What happened then?

341
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,160
And he also didn't come to the banquet today

342
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,870
The female president surnamed Mitsuka

343
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,160
Is this also a sponsor of Tokyo WSG?

344
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,700
Right

345
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,830
Eiko Mitsuka

346
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,660
Isn't he president of Mitsuka Sugar?

347

Gula Mitsuka
Isn't he president of Mitsuka Sugar?

On Kamen Yaiba coklat chocolate packaging

352
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,330
There is this trademark

353
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,250
Yes

354
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,250
What I care more about than this is

355
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,040
see

356
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,700
There's a Kamen Yaiba Show

357
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,830
The maglev car opened to commemorate the Masked Rider Show

358
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,540
Really, it was the first day of a fast car

right?

365
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,700
But, honey

366
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,950
Audience recruitment is long over

367
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,750
Why is it

368
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,500
Leave them for now

369
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,540

why

527
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,250

00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,660
right

550
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,410
You guessed too fast

551
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,540
Ok I want to answer first

552
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,620
Sonoko, do you know the answer?

553
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,660
Confused

554
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,410
That's right

555
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,620
This question is too difficult

556
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,370
Give directions

557
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,200
I can't guess it at all

558
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,040
Alright here are the instructions

559
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,410
To make superconducting high-speed railcars

560
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,410
Floating on the track

561
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,250
Cars need to be equipped with super strong magnets

562
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:15,370
They are called superconducting magnets

563
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,370
Superconducting magnets (Chinese characters removed?)
They are called superconducting magnets

564
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:17,410
Superconducting magnets (Chinese characters removed?)

565
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,120
If a lawyer

566
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
There is another way to say missionary

567
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,370
Lawyer = Lawyer
There is another way to say missionary

568
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:22,410
Lawyer = Lawyer

569
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,120
That's a lawyer
Lawyer = Lawyer

570
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,160
That's a lawyer

571
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,370
Tabib=dokter
That's a lawyer

572
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:23,410
Tabib=dokter

573
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,000
Doctors and preachers, right?
Tabib=dokter

574
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,040
Doctors and preachers, right?

575
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,500
Missionary = preacher
Doctors and preachers, right?

576
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,290
so be it

577
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,250
Professor

578
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,620
Tell me

579
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,870
The answer is

580
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,410
That's right

581
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,370
Very good

582
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,750
Ran

583
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,750
Sorry Sonoko

584
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,540
Okay

585
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,750
Now there are three tickets left

586
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,040
I won't lose to a bunch of brats

587
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,000
People riding the vacuum superconducting magnetic levitation train

588
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,160
It must be this sonoko-sama

589
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,290
But it's so hard to guess

590
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,410
A missionary is a preacher

591
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,370
A missionary is a preacher

592
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,120
missionary is

593
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,160
missionary is

594
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,660
Preacher

595
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,620
Superconductor

596
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,700
so be it

597
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,870
The correct answer is preacher

598
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,540
It is

599
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,660
Third missionary

600
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,120
All answers are correct

601
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,950
Very good

602
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,410
Our luck is very good

603
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,250
Yes

604
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,750
It's nice to be able to take the fast train

605
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,620
And there are so many events around Kamen Yaiba

606
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,870
I have to hurry home

607
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,620
Show off with mom and dad

608
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,750
Oh no

609
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,080
Looks like I left my phone at the professor's house

610
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,620
I don't remember where to put it

611
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,750
You come back first

612
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,620
Goodbye then

613
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,000
Goodbye

614
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,250
We both also made an appointment with Sera

615
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,290
Let us go

616
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,040
By the way, would you like some bubble tea?

617
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
okay

618
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,120
What is it

619
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,000
I want to go for a walk with you

620
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,330
Do you want to ride it?

621
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,370
Boyya

622
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,660
ready to go

623
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,370
run

624
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,160
"Tokyo World Sports Tournament Guide"

625
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,250
Is the sponsor of Tokyo WSG
"Tokyo World Sports Tournament Guide"

626
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,660
This is what they have in common

627
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,620
President Mitsuka who disappeared while playing golf

628
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,500
And President Suzuki who was kidnapped at the banquet

629
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,330
15 years ago

630
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,160
A similar incident occurred in the US.

631
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,950
I guessed right

632
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,250
After all, even the FBI was dispatched

633
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,250
That's great

634
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,790
I found it online

635
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,750
15 years ago in USA

636
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,250
Ahead of the opening of the Boston WSG

637
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,330
Boston's World Sports Association sponsors serial kidnappings

638
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,910
The sponsor's senior figures have been kidnapped one after another

The sponsor's senior figures have been kidnapped one after another

640
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,410
First

641
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,540

second

645
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,910
Is a senior executive of a consortium in Chicago

Chicago
Is a senior executive of a consortium in Chicago

647
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,120
Chicago

648
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,250
Third

649
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:46,540
Is an executive of an auto factory in Detroit

650
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,540
Detroit
Is an executive of an auto factory in Detroit

651
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:48,950
Is an executive of an auto factory in Detroit

652
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,750
Because this case is statewide

653
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,000
So the FBI is in charge of the investigation

654
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,120
but

655
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,370
After the third victim ran away from the perpetrator

656
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,540
He was shot dead at the station

657
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,120
Even though later

658
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,410
The first and second kidnap victims were rescued safely

659
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,120
Don't know why

660
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,370
They remain silent when asked about the suspect's information

661
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,290
Refusal to cooperate with research

662
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,950
There are rumors that the suspect is Japanese

663
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,080
Suspect is a sushi chef in Boston

664
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,250
Makoto Ishihara

665
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,540
Both he and the victim participated

666
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,000
Banquet for BostonWSG

667
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,750
And when the victim of the third incident was killed

668
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,910
He is near the scene

669
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,160
Also on the gun of the murder weapon found after

670
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,750

672
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,700
We also detected his fingerprint
The database has been fingerprinted and the database is being retrieved

673
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:34,910
We also detected his fingerprint

674
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,080
Criminal Number: 7140202 Name: Makoto Ishihara

675
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,080
But when he was caught by the FBI

676
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,580
Ishihara refused to admit to the murder

677
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,120
I heard that the criminal motive

678
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,250
Is to protest the commercialization of WSG

679
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,830
That's why he committed this kind of terrorist act

680
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,000
High -level businessmen kidnapped

681
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,500
Then immediately stop sponsoring WSG

682
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,750
That's why there is such a saying

683
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,290
Companies that stop sponsoring

684
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,200
Under fire from across the United States

685
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,950
They are subject to terrorism

686
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,250
People don't forgive easily

687
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,660
and also

688
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,450
I checked the FBI director at the time

689
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,700
So this person

690
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,120
(Alan Mackenzie is 64 years old) Alan Mackenzie is an American attorney. The current President of the World Sports Association.

691
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,660
You should know Mr. Subaru
(Alan Mackenzie is 64 years old) Alan Mackenzie is an American attorney. The current President of the World Sports Association.

692
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:09,950
(Alan Mackenzie is 64 years old) Alan Mackenzie is an American attorney. The current President of the World Sports Association.

693
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,910
Alan Mackenzie

694
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,580
At that time he was still considered as the next presidential candidate

695
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,040
That's right

696
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,500
He is now the president of WSG

697
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,870
Coming to Japan soon

698
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,200
Are you curious?

699
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,120
After all, 11 years ago

700
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,620
A similar incident occurred in the US.

701
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,910
It's a crime imitating the case 15 years ago

702
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,080
I check again

703
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,500
Mr Alan was also the director of the FBI at the time

704
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,870
But before the case was killed

705
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,950
FBI arrests suspect

706
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,370
He didn't just confess to a crime by imitating a case four years ago

707
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,330
And confessed that he was this year's accomplice

708
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,450
FBI believe

709
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
What's happening in Tokyo now

710
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,160
Is it a further clone of these two cases?

711
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,910
This is the first time

712
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,790
Aimed at senior executives of sugar companies

713
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,040
The second incident was aimed at the senior executive of the consortium

714
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,160
Just like 15 years ago

715
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,330
So conclude

716
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,370
Third goal

717
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,790
Must be the top of the car manufacturers

718
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,660
Thank you son

719

Maori Detective Agency

720
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,290
Did any guests come to see dad?

721
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,370
By the way, where did that person seem to have met before?

722
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,540

What is the chairman and chief executive of Japan's Kod Corporation?

727
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,080
He is a celebrity who often appears in various media these days

728
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,700
Father is the host for this big man

729
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,040
The so-called Japanese code

730
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,910
It was Takara's car that was on the verge of bankruptcy.

731
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,750
After being acquired by a British automaker

732
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,790
Established subsidiary

733
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,950
The next target might be him

734
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,540
VIP ticket for vacuum superconducting maglev train

735
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,750
I'm back

736
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,540

737
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,160

738
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,910
Tickets for fast cars

739
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,120
That's great my mom

740
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,750
By the way, I just heard what ran said

741
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,290
Conan and they will also ride a fast car

742
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,160
That little boy?

743
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,450
It's Brother

744
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,660
Hello brother

745
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,450
Is there any problem

746
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,910
It's July 24

747
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,950
I have work and I have to go to Nagoya

748
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,700
So just ask what souvenirs you want

749
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,580
Was brother also in Nagoya that day?

750
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Is masumi too?

751
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,580
By chance

752
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,120
Let's meet in Nagoya

753
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,830
Please call again when you arrive in Nagoya

754
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,080
I don't have time to meet in Nagoya

755
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,200

756
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,830

No parking Here

758
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,830
Excuse me

759
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,790
Yumi

760
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,660
Deserves to be a Meijin celebrity

761
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Hideyoshi called a new mistress again, right?

762
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,580
You bald mouse

763
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,620
no

764
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,040
Then who are you calling?

765
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,700
Who could let you hang up in a panic so I see you

766
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,370
in that case, okay

767
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,160
I will introduce it to you

768
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,290
Dinner is ready

769
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,200
Well

00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,080
enjoy your meal

771
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,370
Tonkatsu is so delicious

772
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,620
Ran-neechan, can I watch TV?

773
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,500
Can

774
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,450
Very good

775
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,950
The most awaited news

776
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,790
Report on the vacuum superconducting fast train

777
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,450
The train was finally built

778
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,750
Conan, stop watching TV

779
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,660
The rice must be delicious too

780
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,500
understood

781
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,160
Trial operation announcement, one month before the opening of the vacuum superconducting maglev train

782
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
This is dimensional speed
Trial operation announcement, one month before the opening of the vacuum superconducting maglev train

783
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,450
Trial operation announcement, one month before the opening of the vacuum superconducting maglev train

784
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:49,950
And because of the train speed
Trial operation announcement, one month before the opening of the vacuum superconducting maglev train

785
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,700
And because of the train speed

786
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,450
"japanese bullet"
Almost comparable to the speed of a gun bullet

787
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:53,500
"japanese bullet"

788
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,000
So it's also called "Japanese bullet" in the world
"japanese bullet"

789
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,410
So it's also called "Japanese bullet" in the world

790

"japanese bullet"
So it's also called "Japanese bullet" in the world

791
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,370
"japanese bullet"

792
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
amazing

793
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,080
We will ride it

794
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,330
Dad, are you okay?

795
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,500
Ran, sit down

796
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,450
Boy, turn off the TV

797
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,540
Okay

798
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,160
Are you going to take the fast train?

799
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,120
What's wrong with us coming?

800
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,000
Stop talking nonsense and change your clothes

801
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,200
When did you guys go?

802
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,330
Yaampun

803
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,660
On launch day

804
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,830
Tokyo WSG pembukaan opening ceremony

805
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,620
What

806
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,160
Dad raised his hand

807
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,330
You just got scalded, right?

808
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,750
Don't be stubborn

809
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,580
Sorry for soiling clothes

810
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,910
Uncle

811
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,580
Why ?

812
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,910
Mr. John will ride the train fast too, right?

813
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,500
The first car crew included

814
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,290
Attend today's event

815
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,290
Tokyo World Sports Association sponsor representative

816
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,080
Dan WSG

817
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,290
So Mr John

818
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,290
Is here to entrust uncle

819
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,120
Right ?

820
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,750
What has happened

821
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,040
uncle

822
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,700
My friend will also take the fast train

823
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,830
If there is danger

824
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:01,620
Will not

825
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,410
It shouldn't be so dangerous

826
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,790
I think so

827
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,040
Moreover

828
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,870
The two people who were kidnapped earlier have returned safely

829
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,660
In other words

830
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,200
Mr. John may have been kidnapped in a maglev car this time

831
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,120
That's bad we have to tell the police

832
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,950
and many more

833
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,750
I promised the client not to tell the police about it

834
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,250
Isn't it time to say this?

835
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,580
Those two people will be kidnapped

836
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,910
Maybe it's because of President John.

837
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,370
how could that be

838
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,450
He himself said it

839
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,330
He was drunk at the bar before

840
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,450
Accidentally playing golf with President Mitsuka

841
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,500
And President Suzuki attended the banquet

842
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,910
I told the male guest next to me

843
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,200
to be on the lookout

844
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,200
In this case published

845
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,870
His company reputation will surely suffer

846
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,830
Isn't it already broken?

847
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,700
Nowadays even foreigners who are not interested in forming cooperation

848
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,000
Chasing the nail in the eye

849
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,290
So, did he come to entrust father?

850
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,830
He asked me to investigate if it was his fault

851
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:04,120
I also want me not to worry the police until I find out the truth

852
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,000
I go to the bathroom

853
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,870
The good miso soup is a complete waste

854
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,950
I will heat it up again

855
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,750
Conan

856
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,120
Can't let the kids get on the fast train

857
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,200
But seeing them so happy

858
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,500
Really have to think of a way

859
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,830

His name is Shirato

I remember that the pharmaceutical company where Haibara's father works is also called Shirato

883
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,250
It's called Baige Pharmaceutical

884
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,580

00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,330
Okay

915
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,750

Nagoya International Airport
Nagoya International Airport

924
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,700
The purpose of this car

925
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,410
This is the venue for the opening ceremony of the Tokyo World Sports Conference

926
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,690
Stadion Shibahama

927
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:13,910
Stadion Shibahama

928
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:14,160

Vacuum superconducting maglev train Shin-Nagoya Station Shibahama Station TR Shinkansen

934
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,410
So we chose to start from Nagoya
Vacuum superconducting maglev train Shin-Nagoya Station Shibahama Station TR Shinkansen

935
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:24,450
And we will go to Nagoya International Airport

936
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,830
Meet with members of the World Sports Committee and sponsor representatives

937
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:29,200
Wait until all passengers arrive

938
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,660
Let's go to the airport hospital for a physical examination

939
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,330
Hei, Conan

940
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:39,790
Does the sponsor also have to undergo a medical examination?

941
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,910
I think so too

942
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,870
Moreover, we seem to be going from the airport to the stadium

943
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:44,700
Stay with them all the time

944
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,080
Mr. John not only

945
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,950
Is it dangerous on fast trains?

946
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,370
I don't think it should be taken lightly at airports and stadiums

947
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,500
Wait, Conan, do you want to go too?

948
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,700
Of course I have to go

949
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,250
Not at all

950
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,540
I just asked Sonoko

951
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,160
Prepare five tickets

952
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,750
But I also want to take the fast train

953
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,250

But I also want to take the fast train

00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:04,910
He used to be a shooter in his school days

Former FBI Director

Still shooter

963
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,330
Just seven years ago, Mr. Alan was experienced

964
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,750
Becoming president of the World Sports Association

965
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,790
Talking about seven years ago

966
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,410
Coincidentally that year Tokyo obtained the qualifications to host the World Sports Association

967
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,410
That's right

968
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,790
The relationship between President Alan and Tokyo WSG

969
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,620
Doesn't it look like it was destined?

970
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,120
One more thing

971
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,410
Everyone

972
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,660
Please pay attention to the high-speed train model

973
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,410
On the way the train will arrive at Shibahama Station

974
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,950
There will be 10,000 national flags flying like this

975
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,580
This surprise was proposed by President Alan

976
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,160
Wait Miss Ellie

977
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,160
We can't say this matter yet

978
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
This is supposed to be a surprise

979
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
On this issue

980
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,500
Please assume that you haven't heard anything

981
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,580
Also, please don't post it online

982
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,500
Okay

983
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,370
Please take it out now

984
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,200
Brochures distributed at the entrance

987
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,330
Let's continue talking about the follow-up plan today

993
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,500
so be it

994
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,450
We want to enter it's not so easy

995
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:19,500
You really care about the case in Japan

996
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,660
Now someone is copying the case handled by the FBI

997
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,620
Then we naturally have to advance

998
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,250
FBI headquarters has also issued a permit

999
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:32,000
Consent to the use of snipers by Mr. Akai

1000
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,950
Using sniper

1001
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,540
Do you mean you will kill the hostage?

1002
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:35,830
Conan

1003
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,120
The FBI has an FBI method of doing things

1004
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,040
amazing

1005
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,330
Masked Superman Show

1006

Kamen Yaiba performance
Masked Superman Show

1009
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,160
We're going to watch Kamen Yaiba's show, it's a good thing

1010
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,290
Their attention shifted from the fast car to the Kamen Yaiba show

1011
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,290
But that girl is going to Nagoya too

1012
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,250
That girl

1013
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,250
Ran-neechan from detective agency

1014
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,080
Wait a minute, shinichi

1015
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,370
How do you know

1016
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,290
Conan told you again, right?

1017
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,580
Overall, don't go this time

1018
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,750
Leave your father to me to protect

1019
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,330
you protect

1020
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,540
Shinichi, do you want to go to Nagoya too?

1021
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,000
Then I should go together

1022
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,080
Oi, Ran

1023
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,410
Do not worry

1024
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,290
Even if something

1025
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,000
I can also protect myself

1026
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,160
not like this

1027
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,830
You are mine to protect you...

1028
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,120
What's yours

1029
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,000
Po

1030
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,410
Ponoknya

1031
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,870
You never go

1032
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,620
Just a moment shinichi

1033
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,870
Stupid

1034
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,580
Don't let me make it clear

1035
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,790
Nagoya International Airport

00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,620
Passengers in a maglev car
Nagoya International Airport

1037
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,040
Thank you to all of you

1038
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,500
Able to work with us

1039
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,620
In addition, sponsor representatives

1040
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,120
Just arrived

1041
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,040
That boy

1042
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,700
Looks like Ran

1043
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,620
Ran

1044
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,950
Didn't I tell you not to come?

1045
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,410
But I only rely on my father

1046
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,660
How can I protect Mr John?

1047
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,660
I want you to be nosy

1048
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,160
President John also hired a bodyguard, okay?

1049
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,200
Luckily, you didn't bring that bad boy with you

1050
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,250
Conan and Ai-chan

1051
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,410
Why are you here too

1052
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,700
Because Haibara had to come and take a look

1053
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,500
I'm not interested in Kamen Yaiba

1054
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,660
I faintly hear a voice calling out to me

1055
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,870
Everyone

1056
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,830
Let's shout together this time

1057
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,250
One two

1058
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:47,580
Superman is masked

1059
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,790
Save me Kamen Yaiba
Superman is masked

1060
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,580
Save me Kamen Yaiba

1061
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,250
I feel your heart

1062
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,160
Debut Kamen Yaibaa

1063
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,120
Cool

1064
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,620
In the end, I still have to carry these brats

1065
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,870
The Tokyo World's Fair is open!

1066
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,160
Conan

1067
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,500
it hurts

1068
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,250
Danger

1069
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,370
It's okay for a child

1070
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,040
Are the kids okay?

1071
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,790
Because it's decreasing

1072
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,870
So I can't help but run

1073
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,290
You are not hurt

1074
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,830
Uncle, your Japanese is very good

1075
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,330
I've been in Japan for a long time

1076
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:33,830
Turns out so

1077
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,750
This boy

1078
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,750
The school teacher never taught you

1079
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,450
Can't you not run around in the hallway?

1080
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,870
Sorry this is the child of someone I know

1081
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,830
Ran

1082
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,000
Keep him tight for me

1083
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,870
why is it like this

1084
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,000
OK let's go

1085
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,500
Conan

1086
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,790
You should be able to return with Ai-chan by now

1087
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,330
Can't do it

1088
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,750
I am a child

1089
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,120
Ai-chan should be able to go home alone

1090
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,620
I can't go back

1091
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,250
However, they are still children

1092
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,870
Let's go

1093
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,250
Is it all at the end of the team?

1094
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,250
Right

1095
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,870
Contact Okiya Subaru

1096
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,120
Coffee cooler

1097
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:16,120
I just arrived at Nagoya International Airport

1098
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,040
I want to ask for your help, Boyya

1099
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,540
so be it

1100
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,160
This is the last option

1101
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,580
I will try

1102
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,910
Who are you calling?

1103
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,330
Haibara

1104
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,620
It's Genta

1105
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,160
He said Kamen Yaiba's performance was amazing

1106
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,290
Yes

1107
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,410
Just waiting for you

1108
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,000
I will go now

1109
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,250
Be careful not to get lost, hurry up and follow everyone

1110
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:40,950
okay

1111
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,790
hai

1112
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,080
Are you ok

1113
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,370
By the way, I asked you to investigate?

1114
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,040
According to the FBI report

1115
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,910
Ishihara dies after being imprisoned

1116
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,580
Ishihara always refuses to plead guilty, right?

1117
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,120
According to the memoirs of the then FBI director

1118
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,620
He keeps complaining that he is innocent

1119
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,250
The director of the FBI at that time was

1120
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,250
President Alan

1121
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,830
How likely is Ishihara to be mistreated?

1122
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,250
I'd rather believe that it's impossible

1123
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,330
After Ishihara died,

1124
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,910
Leaving his wife and daughter

1125
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,700
Does he have a family?

1126
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,700
After Ishihara died in prison

1127
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,200
Wife and daughter return to Japan

1128
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,040
Their names

1129
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,120
Knowing that I will investigate the participant list

1130
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,910
Uncle must have

1131
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,200
Alan Mackenzie (64 years old) President of the World Sports Association

1132
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,450
Chief Alan came to this place

1134
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,500
Everyone

1135
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,910
Let's greet him with a warm round of applause

1136
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:55,370
Very fast

1137
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,750
How about that?

1138
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,410
They are not on the list

1139
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,790
Yes

1140
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:05,950
Then they might have changed their name according to the Witness Protection Plan

1141
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,370
Is Ishihara a criminal?

1142
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,910
How can his family be

1143
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,870
Applies to Witness Protection Plans

1144
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,660
As long as possible being attacked by the organization

1145
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,120
Anyone can be the applicable object

1146
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,290
On condition of ensuring personal safety

1147
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,540
Mandatory request for other parties to cooperate in the investigation

1148
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,250
This is what is called a judicial transaction

1149
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,450
Can you tell if Ishihara's wife and daughter have become

1150
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,580
Is it an object of protection?

1151
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,790
If the procedure is carried out by the FBI

1152
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,160
I'll find out soon

1153
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,580
Federal Bureau of Investigation

1154
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,370
But if it was executed by the US Marshals
Federal Bureau of Investigation

1155
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,620
But if it was executed by the US Marshals

1156
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,410
Then it will take quite some time

1157
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,120
US Marshal's Service
Then it will take quite some time

1158
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,540
US Marshal's Service

1159
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,290
why
US Marshal's Service

1160
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,200
FBI dan US Marshals

1161
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,750

1162

1163
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,160
The relationship between the two sides is not very good
US Bureau of Marshals, FBI

1164
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,450
The international route reaches the exit

1165
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,790
There is such a thing
The international route reaches the exit

1166
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:46,330
The international route reaches the exit

1167
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,370
By the way
The international route reaches the exit

1168
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:47,410
The international route reaches the exit

1169
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,040
If you change your name because of the Witness Protection Program
The international route reaches the exit

1170
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,700
If you change your name because of the Witness Protection Program

1171
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,120
Can you change it to your liking?

1172
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,160
Can not

1173
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,950
Is that not possible?

1174
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,790
Unless you can be sure that the pseudonym will not remind the real name

1175
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,620
It may be

1176
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,580
So

Owari Nagoya thrives in this city

1180
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,700
It is indeed one of the three famous cities in Japan

1181
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,410
Don't speak your mind proudly

1182
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,200
Yumi kah

1183
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,450
I also said I will pick you up when you arrive at Nagoya Station

1184
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,120
Luckily you guessed that I was here

1185
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,580
Of course I know

1186
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:26,700
After all, you are a celebrity

1187
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,080
Koalas are haunted by Taiko celebrities!
After all, you are a celebrity

1188
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:30,580
it's me

1189
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,580
Don't talk about this

1190
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,330
Going to Nagoya for a date

1191
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,700
what do you think

1192
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,950
Because I have work here today

1193
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,160
And you have to wear kimono, you have to say at least

1194
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,330
Luckily, I made a special dress

1195
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,410
excuse me

1196
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,410
Are you done with your work?

1197
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,000
Um, I just finished today

1198
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,370
look here

1199
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,120
You can see Nagoya Castle

1200
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,120
Being able to play against people in a place like this

1201
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,290
A

1202
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,250
Games?

1203
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:57,870
Didn't I tell you?

You also said that you are a member of the clubhouse executive committee

1210
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,120
I applied for it voluntarily

1211
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,370
You can really find something to do

1212
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,870
After all, I don't want other players to do this kind of work

1213
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,120
Running to raise funds

1214
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,080
No time to play shogi

1215
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,370
People who experience this feeling

1216
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,120
I'm enough

Next, everyone will do a simple check

1221
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,040
One examination room shared by men and women

1222
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,620
Then I'll take everyone to the exam room on the second floor

1223
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,450
Please follow me

1224
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,120
What is wrong

1225
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,290
I feel someone is looking at me

1226
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,620
I’m here to work today, so I can’t be detected

1227
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,910
OK, normal blood pressure

1228
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,080
Next Mr Markenzo

1229
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,910
okay

1230
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,660
Is this an energy drink?

1231
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,290
Similar

1232
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,330
Here it is, Mr. Alan

1233
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,950
thanks

1234
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,500
I just bought it at the airport

1235
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,950
I haven't slept all day

1236
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:26,160
If I fall asleep at the opening ceremony

1237
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,080
That would be bad

1238
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,040
Do you both understand English?

1239
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,660
How much has been taught in school?

1240
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,040
me too

1241
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:37,340
emergency stop

1242
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,950
Friends please stay calm

1243
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,330
Don't panic and run

1244
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,370
Evacuate in an orderly manner

1245
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,370
The door is closed, let's open the door

1246
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,250
Damn this door can't be pushed at all

1247
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,290
English is this for my life

1248
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,450
You can rest assured that we will protect you

1249
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,750

00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,370
Listen to my answer

1253
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:12,950
Ran

1254
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,620
Edogawa, this isn't an explosion at all

1255
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:16,580
This is superconducting cooling

1256
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,040
Superconducting cooling

1257
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:20,660
Edogawa

1258
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,620
Quickly go escape

1259
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,330
Haibara

1260
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
You ran away

1261
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,790
Keep consuming like this

1262
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,370
Everyone here

1263
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,290
Will die

1264
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,080

Shinichi

1270
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,120
Ran, are you okay?

1271
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,700
Can't move body

1272
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:58,450
Moreover

1273
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:02,410
What happened

1274
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,910
hai

1275
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:10,870
What's up, son?

1276
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,500
who

1277
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:42,330
This

1278
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:45,000
What happened

1279
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,410
Not ashamed to make it like this

1280
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,830
What else can we do

1281
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,040
The car suddenly came out and I almost hit it

1282
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:56,200
But it doesn't matter

1283
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,950
Because from the airport to the city

1284
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:59,000
Panggil Jige

1285
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Just the way
Panggil Jige

1286
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,160
Panggil Jige

1287
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:02,950
Why did you hang up the call?

1288
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,450
I found you Tsukichi

1289
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,580
Who are you calling?

1290
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:09,540
This is my family

1291
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:10,620
nagoya

1292
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,700
I would like to introduce you to my family
nagoya

1293
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:12,750
nagoya

1294
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,700
Say you're the boyfriend I'm dating
nagoya

1295
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:18,120
Looks like they still don't agree

1296
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,370
I told my mother beforehand that I waited until I got all the shogi titles

1297
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,950
To propose to the girlfriend you are dating

1298
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,910
One more title and one less

1299
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,250
What is the difference?

1300
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,250
You have earned the best title

1301
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,120
That's my girlfriend Yumi Miyamoto

1302
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,660
Yumi

1303
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,080
Yumi, are you drunk?

1304
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,040
I'm not drunk

1305
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,540
Yumi is very dangerous. Let's go back to the shop.

1306
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:47,540
Ran

1307
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,330
Is there pain in the body?

1308
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,410
It's fine without me, Ran, where are you

1309
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:52,660
Ran

1310
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,330
Ran

1311
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,660
Shinichi

1312
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:00,950
Not shinichi, it's me

1313
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:02,790
father

1314
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,040
Where are Conan and ai-chan

1315
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,000
They haven't woken up yet

1316
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,580
I will see President John's situation

1317
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,000
You go and wake them up

1318
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,750
Conan

1319
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,040
Conan

1320
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,540
Ran

1321
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:19,080
nee-chan

1322
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,410
Are you ok

1323
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,620
Looks like it's no big deal

1324
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,080
Conan, lost

1325
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,080
President John is missing

1326
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:28,540
He is not in front of us

1327
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,160
Have you been checked by a doctor?

1328
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,290
Don't know it's okay

1329
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:33,080
Sender at Mr. John is still working

1330
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,450
Ran-neechan, please take care of Haibara

1331
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,370
Where are you going

1332
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:36,830
bathroom

1333
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,330
arah nagoya

1334
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,700
What happened, boy?

1335
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,040
Edogawa Conan

1336
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,450
There is a small condition in the hospital now
Edogawa Conan

1337
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,040
Those people are safe

1338
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,120
But Mr. John was kidnapped

1339
00:47:59,160 --> 00:47:59,500
What

1340
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,830
Transmitter signal display

1341
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:02,620
Mr John

1342
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:05,080
On the only outside of the airport

1343
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,410
I am afraid that I will cross Minggang Middle Bridge and go east

1344
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,160
Can you catch up?

1345
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:08,910
can

1346
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:11,000
Noise

1347
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,870
Where did he go?

1348
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:21,410
Chasing the red car now

1349
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:22,950
why

1350
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,580
Don't talk, hurry up

1351
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,830
The motorcycle has a helmet

1352
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:39,830
not supposed to

1353
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:47,870
Who is that

1354
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,410
Don't ask too many questions, follow him

1355
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:51,700
Okay

1356
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,870
Coincidentally this time failed

1357
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,160
Danger

1358
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:12,040
Unlucky

1359
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,540
Haibara

1360
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,910
Are you awake Huibara

1361
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,660
I was developed by Ran-neechan

1362
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,540
Thank goodness it's fine, actually

1363
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,660
You wait a minute I moved places

1364
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:27,790
Can't get through

1365
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,950
Mr. John's cell phone is turned off

1366
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,290
Where are you

1367
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,790
My tracking glasses are broken

1368
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,040
It should have just happened.

1369
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,370
You passed out and hit it

1370
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,660
help me confirm Mr John's location

1371
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,540
Location confirmation

1372
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,910
How do you know I have spare tracking glasses on my body?

1373
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:47,500
What makes you always want to get ready

1374
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,620
wait for me a moment

1375
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,200
Please Haibara

1376
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:53,700
Nurse station

1377
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,160
What happened to the explosion earlier
Nurse station

1378
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:55,700
What happened to the explosion earlier

1379
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,660
Please calm down, please let me

1380
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,450
Maybe there was cooling just now

1381
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,370
Hurry up and get an MRI technician

1382
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:02,410
okay

1383
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:05,500
Mr. Takahashi in charge of NMR

1384
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,580
After Mr. John entered the island

1385
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,620
Turn around from the Donghai exit and head south

1386
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,000
In terms of speed, whether driving or riding a motorcycle

1387
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,910
Go to the MRI room, hurry

1388
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,370
Mr. Subaru, Mr. John now

1389
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,750
i have heard

1390
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,120
Donghae Conglomerate instructions, right?

1391
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,160
find it

1392
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:36,160
Haibara, Where is Mr John

1393
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:37,620
now

1394
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,080
Signal stops near East China Sea Joint Venture

1395
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,370
I'm next

1396
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,080
To enter the MRI room

1397
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:44,500
The internal magnetic field there

1398
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,290
May cause abnormalities in electronic devices such as tracking glasses

1399
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,290
But because there is cooling

1400
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:50,790
I think there should be no problem

1401
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:52,790
What do you mean by quenching?

1402
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:55,410
You, a detective, don't know

1403
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:56,750
What is cooling?

1404
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:57,910
Yes sorry

1405
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,910
I will tell you

1406
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,660
Inside the MRI machine

1407
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:01,950
Superconducting Magnets

1408
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:03,750
Superconducting magnets installed

To keep the working temperature at a low level
Superconducting Magnets

1411
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,950
To keep the working temperature at a low level

1412
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,080
Liquid helium in the instrument

1415
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:10,790
But once the temperature rises due to several factors
helium cair

1416
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:12,750
Liquid helium will evaporate quickly

1417
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:14,620
This is the cause

1418
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,790
That's right

1419
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,700
After cooling occurs

1420
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,330
The oxygen content in the air will be quickly pulled down by helium

1421
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,450
It will be life threatening in a few minutes

1422
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:23,950
but

1423
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,830
There must be a safety device to avoid this danger

1424
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,040
why

1425
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,330
This kind of drip station should not appear in the MRI room

1426
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:31,950
emergency stop

1427
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,450
And someone pressed the emergency stop button
emergency stop

1428
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:34,540
And someone pressed the emergency stop button

1429
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,700
How about this?

1430
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,040
I think it's because

1431
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,410
This thing is close to the superconducting magnet from the MRI machine

1432
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,200
Someone pressed the emergency stop button in a hurry

1433
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,410
That's why it leads to quench

1434
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:45,120
But in general

1435
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,250
If the emergency button is pressed

1436
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:50,080
The pipes in the hospital have to be closed, right?

1437
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:51,870
That's right

1438
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,870
If there is smoke

1439
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,540
The pipes in the hospital will be closed

Only the ventilation duct to the outside will be opened

1443
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,040
Only the ventilation duct to the outside will be opened

1444
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,830
Why just like that?

1445
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:04,620
Where are you going

1446
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,370
Please follow me to the control room

1447
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,830
The pipe to the second floor is open

1448
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:15,200
And the exhaust equipment is set to full speed operation mode

1449
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,450
You hear that?

1450
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,660
Only the second floor was full of smoke

1451
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,540
And it empties very quickly

1452
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:19,950
MRI room
And it empties very quickly

1453
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:20,160
MRI room

1454
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,660
That's why we don't die from lack of oxygen
MRI room

1455
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:25,620
Did the prisoner do this on purpose?

1456
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,540
It seems like

1457
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:28,830
If so

1458
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,160
Prisoners should have no intention to kill

1459
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,370
so be it

1460
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,450
That's why he targeted the kidnapping

1461
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,450
Put it in an interesting place

1462
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,700
I'm in company with Donghae

1463
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,290
Where is the destination?

1464
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,660
It's nearby

1465
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,080
Mr. John doesn't move

1466
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,790
That motorbike again

1467
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:48,660
This feeling

1468
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,410
Ini Jeet Kune Do

1469
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,330
Who's he

1470
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,620
amazing

1471
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,620
I will be knocked down again

1472
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,160
this child

1473
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:15,620
is it possible

1474
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,080
Really masumi

1475
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,500
Mr. Subaru, where are you?

1476
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,950
Is this all a disguise?

1477
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:36,830
Who are you

1478
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,250
Will be neechan

1479
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,830
Conan

1480
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:41,120
How will you be here?

1481
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:43,700
I'm here to find someone

1482
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,040
Do you go to this kind of factory to find someone?

1483
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:48,250
I also have some situations here

1484
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,410
From: M Subject: You go first

1485
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:00,750
I haven't been able to meet that kid

1486
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:03,120
I know mom

1487
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,450
Will be neechan

1488
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,330
The person you are looking for

1489
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,500
Could it be Mr John

1490
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,450
Your insight is very strong

1491
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:13,120
That's right

1492
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:15,120
I know where mr john

1493
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,700
Come with me

1494
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:17,750
a moment

1495
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,830
Sera neechan, why are you here?

1496
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:25,450
I saw her in the hospital lobby

1497
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,200
What happened

1498
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,660
Someone is driving the luggage cart

1499
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,000
Pass through the confused crowd at ease

1500
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,700
What does the driver look like?

1501
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,200
He's driving too fast, I can't see clearly

1502
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,750
But physically must be male

1503
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:43,500
The perpetrator is a man

1504
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,040
There

1505
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:47,000
The dispatcher Mr. John is there

1506
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,290
Is John Foyd near here?

1507
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,250
That culprit used to take hostage before

1508
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:57,080
Live in an easy to find place

1509
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,620
This time it might be the same as before

1510
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,950
I will try on Mr. John's phone

1511
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:03,910
Do you know the cell phone number?

1512
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:05,120
Why ?

1513
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:06,250
by the way

1514
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:07,370
Mr. John's cell phone

1515
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:09,040
It seems dead now

1516
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:10,080
will not

1517
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:12,950
If the Perpetrator is the same as I thought

1518
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:16,750
there is noise

1519
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:17,870
Where

1520
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:23,700
so be it

1521
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,200
On top

1522
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:26,870
Well

1523
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,080
Meet

1524
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,330
How can it be in such an interesting place

1525
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:36,830
it is because

1526
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:40,410
The culprit had no intention of killing Mr. John

1527
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,660
I will start now

1528
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,700
good to eat

1529
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,080
Sure enough, if you come to Nagoya, you must try the triple eel rice

1530
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,540
father

1531
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,540
Shinichi called me just now

1532
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,870
Said he found Mr John

1533
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:59,080
Why was the detective man calling?

1534
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,450
Don't ask, go and tell the person in charge

1535
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,450
The bowl of eel rice is mine

1536
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,000
You have to show it to me

1537
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:08,370
Okay, okay

1538
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:10,330
Thank you Shinichi

1539
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,120
It's okay here

1540
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,410
That's right

1541
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:15,700
Don't tell me if you find someone

1542
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:20,580
Mr John

1543
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,870
Do you remember the situation when you were kidnapped

1544
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:27,370
At that time, suddenly there was a burst of white smoke all around

1545
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,120
Difficulty breathing

1546
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:29,790
but

1547
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:32,080
I woke up once in the middle of the road

1548
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,870
It's in the car

1549
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:36,910
I feel like there's someone else next to me

1550
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,750
Is it a perpetrator?

1551
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,120
do not know

1552
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,540
Is it a boy or a girl?

1553
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:44,450
do not know

1554
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,500
food court

1555
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,370
Can't you take the fast train?
food court

1556
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:49,410
why

1557
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,410
The results of the physical examination are clearly normal

1558
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:51,580
Ordered today
The results of the physical examination are clearly normal

1559
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:51,620
Ordered today

1560
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:52,370
but
Ordered today

1561
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:52,410
Ordered today

1562
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:54,200
This very tasty. If something like that happens again
Ordered today

1563
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,450
It's really delicious, it's troublesome

1564
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,450
So I recommend you

1565
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,660
Let's take the Shinkansen back to Tokyo

1566
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,200
Miss Allie is in trouble

1567
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:04,160
I have to go, Miss Allie, Mr Inoue

1568
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,660
Did President Alan come here?

1569
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:08,870
I have not seen it yet

1570
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:09,500
I don't have either

1571
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,580
I searched the hospital and the conference room

1572
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,750
But Chief Alan is nowhere to be found

1573
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,500
Aichi Prefektur Prefectural Police

1574
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,000
Did you call 110?

1575
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,910
It's me, you guys are too slow to get out of the cops right?

1576
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:22,080
Sorry

1577
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:23,870
Because of the explosion at the airport

1578
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,290
Most of the police force in Nagoya City

1579
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,040
Has been moved there

1580
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:30,250
In any case, send this person to the hospital immediately

1581
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:34,410
Thanks to you I was saved

1582
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:35,410
thank you very much

1583
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,250
You're welcome

1584
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,000
Take care Mr John

1585
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:43,830
Now my job is done

1586
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,080
Tokyo

1587
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,660
Important figures in the UK have been saved

1588
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,410
Well done, Sera

1589
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:54,200
Young Detective

1590
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,540
We have to take the Shinkansen back
Young Detective

1591
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,910
Does the train stop fast?

1592
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:01,750
Saying that the carriage will still cooperate with the opening ceremony

1593
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:03,160
Depart from the station

1594
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:04,910
Only no passengers

1595
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:06,620
Not even a passenger?

1596
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:08,870
However, this is a fast unmanned car

1597
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:10,330
It's not important

1598
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:12,080
President Alan is missing

1599
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,160
Mr John just said

1600
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,080
There are still people in the car

1601
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,370
That person is probably President Alan

1602
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,450
I will answer the call later

1603
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:29,120
I found the culprit's car, Boyya

1604
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,250
Right at the airport parking

1605
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:33,250
But I'm afraid I can only find out

1606
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:36,250
Driver only male

1607
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,290
The perpetrator is a man

1608
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,290
Then the director of the FBI

1609
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,370
Hello friends from Japan

1610
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:50,910
How likely is Ishihara to be mistreated?

1611
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:01,120
Akai san

1612
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,160
As a last resort

1613
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,200
Seems to have arrived

1614
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,250
Let's go to Shin Nagoya Station now

1615
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,830
so be it

1616
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,660
Sera, let's go to Shin Nagoya Station

1617
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:28,000
Hurry up

1618
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:28,910
What is wrong

1619
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,250
I don't mean that the culprit makes cooling.

1620
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:34,540
Is the police force in the city mostly concentrated at the airport?

1621
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,870
That's right

1622
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:38,080
New Nagoya Station now when the police force is weak

1623
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:41,290
15 years ago

1624
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:41,790
World Sports Association sponsors serial kidnapping case TM company president shot and killed

1625
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:43,250
Third person kidnapped
World Sports Association sponsors serial kidnapping case TM company president shot and killed

1626
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:43,290
World Sports Association sponsors serial kidnapping case TM company president shot and killed

1627
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:44,790
Shot at the station
World Sports Association sponsors serial kidnapping case TM company president shot and killed

1628
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,040
So this time the prisoner

1629
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,950
Will he kill people with a gun at Shin-Nagoya Station?

1630
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,580
Not sure to use

1631
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,500
"japanese bullet"

1632
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,080
In other words, the decisive battlefield is in the fast cars

1633
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:59,750
Akai has already rushed to Shin-Nagoya Station

1634
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:00,950
Come on, quickly

1635
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,330
good

1636
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,790
Yumi, you drank too much

1637
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,870
Please restrain yourself

1638
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:10,500
How do I introduce you to my family?

1639
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,250
What does this have to do with your family?

1640
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:16,160
After all, the two of us are getting married

1641
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:19,700
So cool

1642
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,080
So you are willing to accept my marriage proposal

1643
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,370
Of course

1644
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,870
Yumi

1645
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:29,250
I will make you happy

1646
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,950
Tokyo World Sports Convention

1647
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:33,830
Then let's go back to Tokyo too
Tokyo World Sports Convention

1648
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:35,660
Then let's go back to Tokyo too

1649
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,330
Please follow me

1650
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,040
I'm really looking forward to the fast car

1651
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:43,040
Are you in trouble?

1652
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:45,160
The child I brought is missing

1653
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:46,120
Ran

1654
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:48,950
Have you found President Alan?

1655
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:50,660
Shouldn't be

1656
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,080
However, the fast train will depart according to the original plan

1657
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,500
The opening ceremony will also be held as usual

1658
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,080
From: Edogawa Subject: Excuse me, Haibara
The opening ceremony will also be held as usual

1659
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:55,450
From: Edogawa Subject: Excuse me, Haibara

1660
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:55,870
This is a decision made by the World Sports Association
From: Edogawa Subject: Excuse me, Haibara

1661
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:58,580
This is a decision made by the World Sports Association

1662
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,500
It's basically impossible to change

1663
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,000
How is President John now?

1664
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,830
It should be fine

1665
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,250
Don't you have to follow him?

1666
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:09,660
I said that Mr John has bodyguards to follow

1667
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:12,120
The commission I received was to investigate the incident

1668
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:13,290
Let's go

1669
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:14,160
Wait a moment

1670
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:16,250
Conan isn't back yet

1671
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:17,620
have you called?

1672
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,160
I called several times

1673
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,500
He didn't even pick up

1674
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,120
You said Edogawa

1675
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,500
He said he came home with his acquaintance

1676
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,540
Departure ceremony of the vacuum superconducting maglev train from Shibahama to the Shin-Nagoya bagian section

1677
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:34,330
After the departure plan is adjusted

1678
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:37,250
Even on the vacuum superconducting fast train

1679
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,950
No first passenger

1680
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,040
But still attracts so many people

1681
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,500
Come to see the style of the car

1682
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:48,790
The fun time has finally arrived

1683
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:56,040
Japan welcomes you

1684
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:01,950
ten

1685
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,580
Not only train fans nowadays

1686
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,620
All of Japan

1687
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,410
People from the world

1688
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:11,080
Did everyone witness this historic moment?

1689
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,250
one

1690
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:37,870
Fast train now

1691
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:39,500
Departure on time

1692
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,120
what's this

1693
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,200
The speed of the vacuum superconducting maglev train can be judged according to the color of the body

1694
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,500
Everyone came to find out
The speed of the vacuum superconducting maglev train can be judged according to the color of the body

1695
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:54,540
The speed of the vacuum superconducting maglev train can be judged according to the color of the body

1696
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:54,700
How does the vacuum superconducting fast train work?
The speed of the vacuum superconducting maglev train can be judged according to the color of the body

1697
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:55,120
How does the vacuum superconducting fast train work?

1698
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,200
There are a total of seven body colors, please remember!
How does the vacuum superconducting fast train work?

1699
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:57,500
How does the vacuum superconducting fast train work?

1700
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,160
When the train starts, it will run on wheels

1701
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:05,250
Then when the speed of the car exceeds 150 kilometers per hour

1702
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:07,330
The train will depend on the attraction of magnets and coils

1703
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:09,120
Floating on the track

1704
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:12,950
After that, the maglev train will enter the vacuum tunnel

1705
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:16,120
Reduces air resistance in tunnels

1706
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,620
Cars run at speeds of up to 1,000 kilometers per hour

1707
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:22,200
But the train can control the speed in the tunnel

1708
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:23,870
Finally the train came out of the tunnel

1709
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:25,750
After the speed drops to 300 kilometers per hour

1710
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,750
Air brake system will start

1711
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:30,450
Then the speed dropped even further to 150 kilometers per hour

1712
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,040
The wheels that were originally stored at the bottom of the carriage will be released

1713
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,660
Fast Train has no driver

1714
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,120
So who's driving?

1715
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,200
This problem

1716
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,080
This question is good

1717
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:44,080
In fact, we are in a vacuum superconducting high-speed railcar

1718
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:46,330
Equipped with a manually controlled cab

1719
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:47,580
Manual taxi
Equipped with a manually controlled cab

1720
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:48,620
but

1721
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:51,160
This cabin was used during the trial

1722
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,410
Usually not used

1723
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:53,540
In line with that

1724
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:57,080
The main control room is located between Shin-Nagoya Station and Shibahama . Station

1725
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,750
Will be responsible for operating the train

1726
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:59,950
Then let's see

1727
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,200
How is the situation in the car when the train is running?

1728
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,910
Can you see inside the maglev train?

1729
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:05,950
extraordinary

1730
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:07,790
sadly

1731
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:10,040
There's no one in the passenger compartment today

1732
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,750
Conan

1733
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:15,660
will be

1734
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,700
If President Alan isn't in the car,

1735
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,290
We didn't end up with a scolding

1736
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:25,580
I said did you smell something?

1737
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:33,910
This is President Alan

1738
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:35,750
That's right

1739
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,160
By the way, the culprit you saw at the airport

1740
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:40,500
There are some suitcases in his luggage basket

1741
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:42,910
There are two

1742
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,040
And those are two identical squares

1743
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:47,500
Two identical boxes

1744
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,660
I remember to put Mr. box. John

1745
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:52,620
It's a zipper

1746
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:58,250
Conan

1747
01:05:58,290 --> 01:05:59,330
What are you doing now

1748
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,370
Does it smell sweet and sour?

1749
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:07,250
perhaps

1750
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:09,700
This is the mark left by the wheel with a nutritious drink

1751
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:15,040
Vitamin B2 added in nutrition drink

1752
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,200
Is a fluorescent substance

1753
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,080
Will react to invisible light

1754
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,620
But it can emit invisible light

1755
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,950
Your watch is too versatile, isn't it

1756
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:26,870
After all, this is a detective tool developed by a trusted professor

1757
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:32,870
Could it be the kids who missed me?

1758
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:34,620
Just talk about me

1759
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,290
It takes a little time to repair the car

1760
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:37,700
Made me delay for so long

1761
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:41,160
I hope they have fun at the kamen yaiba event

1762
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:45,870
too weak

1763
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:47,370
You are too weak, kamen yaiba

1764
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,830
These kids are mine

1765
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,620
Hentikan Which

1766
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:53,250
The masked Superman is in danger

1767
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:55,120
There are too many enemies

1768
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,450
One two

1769
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,120
Kamen steals, yes

1770
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:02,160
Can the professor come quickly?

1771
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:04,160
That's it for freaks

1772
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:05,330
Whose voice is this

1773
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:06,500
Where

1774
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:07,450
Look at the sky

1775
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:14,000
So two people in a fast car

1776
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:14,910
excuse me

1777
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:16,160
I am the companion

1778
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:16,870
Sorry

1779
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,410
I am very sorry

1780
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:19,700
Not this

1781
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,540
Please stop at the stop halfway

1782
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,290
Drag them out of the car

1783
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,830
I will pick them up

1784
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,250
No

1785
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:28,660
Today's plan is riding experience

1786
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,910
The program is set to pass the station along the way non-stop

1787
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:35,370
But the main control room can control the train, right?

1788
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:37,450
But this way

1789
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,000
The train can't take part in the opening ceremony

1790
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,580
10,000 flag-raising activities on trains will also be stopped

1791
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:45,160
That's President Alan's creativity

1792
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:46,910
That's right

1793
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:50,160
How can you consider the situation of the high-speed train and stop the activity in a relaxed manner?

1794
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,160
But

1795
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,160
We still have to contact the main control room

1796
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,120
Leave it to me

1797
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:57,120
Conan

1798
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,200
will be

1799
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:09,200
hai

1800
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:11,160
Can you wait a little longer?

1801
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:14,330
no

1802
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,700
it's time

1803
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,040
so be it

1804
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:44,120
Go

1805
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,000
We need to find Chief Alan as soon as possible

1806
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:50,910
Conan

1807
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:52,910
That was the shot just now, right?

1808
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:55,040
And it's a bolt-action rifle

1809
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:57,160
Who have you been with since then

1810
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,660
What the hell are you doing

1811
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:01,620
Do not worry

1812
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:04,330
The one on the phone is on our side

1813
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:11,870
Then it's up to the child, boyya

1814
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:13,080
wait

1815
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:16,080
I have another request

1816
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:20,370
so be it

1817
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:23,120
Send me the mobile numbers of all participants

1818
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:27,750
July 24 vacuum superconducting magnetic levitation train/monitoring

1819
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:30,620
What are you doing actually

1820
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:37,080
good

1821
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:40,290
what are you doing now

1822
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:41,540
Lend me

1823
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,120
Wait a moment

1824
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,250
What are you doing now

1825
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:48,040
That's right

1826
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:50,160
Know that I was asked to do something

1827
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:56,700
No more here

1828
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:57,790
That's right

1829
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:00,450
I will open the door

1830
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,790
Could it be here

1831
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,040
Wait a moment

1832
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:17,580
Are you ok

1833
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:19,700
He's still conscious

1834
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:21,370
english where am i

1835
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:22,910
In a fast car

1836
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:25,620
How did you find me?

1837
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,750
Thanks to the drink bottle you dropped

1838
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:32,500
Totally worthy of being the former director of the FBI

1839
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,540
This is President Alan

1840
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,000
What

1841
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,200
Mr. Native

1842
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:40,870
What's this

1843
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,750
Do you know what happened?

1844
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:43,830
Everyone listen to me

1845
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,950
When President Alan was fired,

1846
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:47,370
Young Detective
When President Alan was fired,

1847
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:47,410
Young Detective

1848
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,660
Kidnapped with President John
Young Detective

1849
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,200
What did you say

1850
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:52,580
Then

1851
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:55,080
Both of them were put in the prison car

1852
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,620
Did Mr. Alan see the perpetrator's appearance?

1853
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:58,620
Monitoring here

1854
01:10:58,620 --> 01:10:59,370
Too bad he didn't see
Monitoring here

1855
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:00,450
Too bad he didn't see

1856
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:01,500
but

1857
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,450
We already know who did it

1858
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:08,870
"We" Conan also know?

1859
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:11,000
no

1860
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,580
The one who knows the prisoner is Shinichi-neechan

1861
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,620
So who's the culprit?

1862
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:18,370
Before revealing the real culprit

1863
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:20,450
Conan wants to confirm one more thing

1864
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:23,500
I said that's what Shinichi-niichan wanted to confirm

1865
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,200
Then please

1866
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,040
Good English

1867
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,870
Unknown contact entered

1868
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,450
Unknown contact

1869
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,080
Hit my phone too

1870
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:47,040
Halo

1871
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:48,500
Who's this

1872
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,290
No one will pick up who's calling

1873
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:52,500
Impossible

1874
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,790
Is everyone's phone ringing?

1875
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,950
Conan and I also called

1876
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,870
President Alan also rings

1877
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,910
But only one person

1878
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:04,870
The phone isn't ringing, is it?

1879
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,160
That's right

1880
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:16,160
Nona Maiko Shirato

1881
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:17,660
Nona Shirato

1882
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:25,250
Looks like your phone is not ringing

1883
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:27,000
Because the phone is dead

1884
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:29,870
There should be a battery in your phone, right?

1885
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:31,160
According to me

1886
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,410
It must be because of the MRI machine

1887
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:35,410
Let electronic products damage

1888
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,120
in other words

1889
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:39,160
The person who caused the blackout

1890
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,160
Nona Shirato

1891
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:40,750
That is you

1892
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,660
There happened to be a problem with the phone

1893
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,790
Will you put the perpetrator on me?

1894
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:50,750
Then you want to say

1895
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:54,160
Did you happen to take this fast train?

1896
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,160
The most important is Maiko Shirato

1897
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:57,500
your name

1898
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,040
And the shooting captive 15 years ago

1899
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:58,950
Maiko Shirasu
And the shooting captive 15 years ago

1900
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:00,040
And the shooting captive 15 years ago

1901
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:00,120
Maiko Shirasu si ra ha to ma i ko Makoto Ishihara i si ha ra ma ko to
And the shooting captive 15 years ago

1902
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:00,160
Maiko Shirasu si ra ha to ma i ko Makoto Ishihara i si ha ra ma ko to

1903
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,830
Makoto Ishihara's katakana is the same
Maiko Shirasu si ra ha to ma i ko Makoto Ishihara i si ha ra ma ko to

1904
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:02,870
Maiko Shirasu si ra ha to ma i ko Makoto Ishihara i si ha ra ma ko to

1905
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:04,000
This shouldn't be a coincidence
Maiko Shirasu si ra ha to ma i ko Makoto Ishihara i si ha ra ma ko to

1906
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:09,410
Your father insisted that he was innocent but died in the end

1907
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:11,290
You can't give his name

1908
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:12,500
I'm not wrong

1909
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:17,750
Alan

1910
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:19,580
this weapon

1911
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:21,330
I am very happy

1912
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:23,330
You still remember

1913
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:24,660
Correct

1914
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,750
It's the same model as the murder weapon 15 years ago

1915
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:29,290
This culprit

1916
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,250
Which is your father?

1917
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:33,580
Confessed innocence 15 years ago

1918
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:36,750
But the FBI caught my dad

1919
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,330
Do you remember?

1920
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:40,870
Was that the first victim of that case 15 years ago?

1921
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:42,580
i remember that

1922
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:44,410
Is an executive of a Japanese confectionery company

1923
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:47,830
When Japanese corporate executives are kidnapped

1924
01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:50,200
My dad is with me

1925
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:51,660
In other words, he has an alibi

1926
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,580
at that time

1927
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:55,410
I said the same thing in my testimony to the FBI

1928
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,660
But my father is still arrested

1929
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,410
He screamed injustice until he died in prison

1930
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:02,750
My mother came to Japan

1931
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:04,620
But soon he was exhausted

1932
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:06,410
Also died

1933
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:09,870
That's why you always hate the FBI

1934
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:13,870
So I listened to the US Marshals Office's suggestion to change my name and surname

1935
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:20,660
Is it a witness protection plan in a judicial transaction?

1936
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,750
you

1937
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,870
Know a lot

1938
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,950
Yes, to the people of the US Marshals

1939
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,330
Don't understand Japanese katakana

1940
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:30,040
So they don't find

1941
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,040
I use my father's name

1942
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:34,040
Then seven years ago

1943
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:36,330
God is finally on my side

1944
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:37,750
Seven years ago

1945
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:41,450
Tokyo gains qualification to host this World Sports Association

1946
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:43,700
yes, and

1947
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,160
This man is also that year

1948
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,330
Becoming president of the World Sports Association

1949
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:49,160
This is the will of God

1950
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:55,660
That's why you got involved in the Japan World Sports Association?

1951
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,700
Yes

1952
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:00,700
That's why I knew that this person was going to take the fast train

1953
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:04,450
this "Japanese bullet"

1954
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:08,330
That's why you planned the same case as 15 years ago

1955
01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:12,910
I do this to remind this person of his sins

1956
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:15,700
But you didn't kill anyone else before

1957
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:16,910
That's right

1958
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:19,290
I just need to kill him alone

1959
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:20,830
You're out of me

1960
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:28,330
I want to wait for the "Japanese bullet" to arrive at the terminal

1961
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,250
Take this person's life again

1962
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:33,830
But thanks to your blessing, the plan has changed

1963
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:35,910
I will kill him now

1964
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,080
Looks like god

1965
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,410
Still by my side

1966
01:15:58,750 --> 01:15:59,790
Stop right now

1967
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,370
what you just said

1968
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:03,580
As long as I die

1969
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:04,910
That's right

1970
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:07,080
I just need to kill you

1971
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,250
Okay

1972
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:09,450
Shoot here

1973
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,830
Tuan Mackenzie

1974
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:11,790
here

1975
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:12,870
Shoot here

1976
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:14,290
Shoot from a higher position

1977
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:16,540
So even if the bullet goes through my body

1978
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:18,330
It will only touch the floor

1979
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,660
Aim for my chest

1980
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,080
Shoot from a higher position

1981
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,950
So even if the bullet goes through my body

1982
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,700
It will only touch the floor

1983
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:28,500
High-speed trains are designed to travel at high speeds

1984
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:31,250
Use a very light material, right?

1985
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:37,500
Of course

1986
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:41,000
If the bullet hits a wall or ceiling

1987
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,870
Dangerous train

1988
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:45,450
Everyone present will be in danger

1989
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,330
Even though the floor is quite strong

1990
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:49,870
But shooting from very close range is also easy to penetrate

1991
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:54,200
So you have to be at the farthest distance so that the bullet can hit the left chest

1992
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:56,450
Shoot me from the highest position possible

1993
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,620
That's what Mr. Alan said

1994
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:59,120
Shut up and stop talking nonsense

1995
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:00,950
Nona shirahato

1996
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,250
I think you should know

1997
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:04,620
Mr. Alan used to be a shooter

1998
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,370
Also expert shooters who participated in previous experience events

1999
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:07,700
Conan

2000
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:09,120
father

2001
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:11,910
here

2002
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,660
Shoot here

2003
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,330
Higher

2004
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:19,250
Defeat

2005
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:21,450
Return

2006
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,250
Raise your hands up

2007
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:26,200
take a step back

2008
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,540
snow

2009
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:41,540
Shot removal verification?

2010
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:49,950
Conan

2011
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:51,200
What is wrong

2012
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:52,620
What has happened

2013
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:54,120
who's this

2014
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,790
Who shot him?

2015
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,000
Yokohama Machida

2016
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,120
The person who shot must be Mr. Akai
Yokohama Machida

2017
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,540
The person who shot must be Mr. Akai

2018
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:05,370
But shouldn't the show be?

2019
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:06,870
Still in Nago?

2020
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:08,750
Fast car

2021
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:08,910
Tokyo

2022
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:09,290
Just arrived near Yamanashi
Tokyo

2023
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:09,830
Yamanashi
Just arrived near Yamanashi

2024
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:10,410
nagoya
Just arrived near Yamanashi

2025
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:10,450
nagoya

2026
01:18:10,450 --> 01:18:10,870
It's impossible to successfully become a sniper at this distance
nagoya

2027
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:12,950
It's impossible to successfully become a sniper at this distance

2028
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:14,950
So Mr. Akai

2029
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,250
Only customize special bullets

2030
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,000
Not made of iron

2031
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,250
It's made of silver

2032
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,370
Silver bullets will not be orbited by magnetic levitation

2033
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:38,500
Electromagnets hang on the sidewall

2034
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:41,120
The electromagnetic induction effect between the electromagnets not only allows the train body to levitate

2035
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,910
It can also make bullets fly in the trajectory

2036
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:43,000
Current speed
It can also make bullets fly in the trajectory

2037
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,040
Current speed

2038
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,410
Flying at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour
Current speed

2039
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:46,120
Flying at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour

2040
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,080
After entering the vacuum tunnel

2041
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,580
Almost unaffected by gravity and air resistance

2042
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:53,660
Chase behind a maglev car at a constant speed

2043
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:54,750
This time

2044
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:56,910
If the fast train slows down suddenly

2045
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:59,620
And the slowdown lasts for a long time

2046
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:01,450
The silver bullet will be during the slowdown period

2047
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,580
Ultra-light car body that goes through the maglev kereta train

2048
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:12,410
At this time, as long as the vital part of the perpetrator

2049
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:14,080
Only in pre-calculated positions

2050
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,200
Snipers can be successful

2051
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,830
This requires the cooperation of someone in the carriage

2052
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:21,000
Is that person?

2053
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,370
That's right, Edogawa Conan

2054
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:25,950
Nona shirato

2055
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,160
Conan sera chan

2056
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,410
Are you okay

2057
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:31,450
Everyone is fine

2058
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,200
Why did the perpetrator get shot

2059
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,200
Did the gun explode?

2060
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:35,370
Leave this alone

2061
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:37,620
Hurry up let the fast train stop nearby

2062
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:38,700
Call an ambulance

2063
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,450
Taking into account the operating status of the high-speed train

2064
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,080
Nearest station

2065
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,250
What is the terminal?

2066
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:45,950
Shibahama Station

2067
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:49,370
I will now alert the police and ambulance to stand guard at Shibahama Station

2068
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,790
Is this resolved?

2069
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:53,870
Not yet

2070
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:54,750
That's right

2071
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,660
There are still accomplices who are not caught

2072
01:19:58,120 --> 01:19:59,540
And minions

2073
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:07,290
Chicken wing

2074
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:09,540
Yumi, are you okay?

2075
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,290
I'm fine

2076
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:13,750
Before seeing your family

2077
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:16,160
I don't know how to vomit

2078
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:18,790
Let's go back to Tokyo today

2079
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:21,000
By the way, I'll take a taxi to take you to the station

2080
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,120
That car really goes fast

2081
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,540
Park me right away

2082
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:34,370
Yumi

2083
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:36,200
Is Yumi okay?

2084
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:37,450
Yumi

2085
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,330
Yumi Yumi

2086
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,330
Did you mean: accomplice

2087
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:45,450
That's right Conan

2088
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:49,000
It seems that Shirato's sister is also aware of this

2089
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,330
new brother

2090
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:53,330
Of course you would notice it if you saw that kind of thing

2091
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:58,330
Obviously someone was operating the car from a distance

2092
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:02,830
And when the perpetrator is in danger

2093
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:05,580
In other words, there are accomplices who are secretly helping

2094
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:09,250
The prisoner was carrying a large suitcase containing President Alan

2095
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:11,200
Get on this fast car

2096
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,450
After breaking free at the airport

2097
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:17,080
Although the police force at Shin-Nagoya Station is insufficient,

2098
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,700
It's not easy to ride a car like this

2099
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,370
In other words, accomplice

2100
01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:21,870
Related to fast cars

2101
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,160
And it's a boy

2102
01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:26,370
Really? Mr. Inoue

2103
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:31,750
You can think of this cooling method and put it into practice

2104
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,330
Eligible to be a magnetic levitation technology engineer

2105
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,620
Talking about electric trains and nuclear magnetic resonance

2106
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,870
Superconducting magnets are used

2107
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,950
You are responsible for debugging

2108
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:44,450
You can't be bothered with this little trick

2109
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:46,580
Can use remote operation

2110
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:48,290
The person who just made sudden braking like that

2111
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:51,370
Only you can monitor real-time images in the car

2112
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:52,950
Magnetic Levitation Engineer

2113
01:21:57,790 --> 01:21:58,830
Give it back to me

2114
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:00,620
Don't you want to run away?

2115
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:01,450
find it

2116
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,620
The software connected to the main control room of the maglev kereta train

2117
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:06,620
It hurts me back

2118
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,040
Why are you doing this

2119
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:10,910
Among the people involved in the case 15 years ago

2120
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:12,620
Only two Japanese

2121
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:15,000
One of them is the suspect Makoto Ishihara

2122
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,040
The others are the first victims

2123
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:18,040
The executives of that dim sum company

2124
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,660
that person

2125
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:21,200
Is my father

2126
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,410
What did you say

2127
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:25,290
After my dad stopped sponsoring world experience

2128
01:22:25,330 --> 01:22:27,250
Criticized in the US

2129
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:30,040
He was finally dismissed by the company's board of directors

2130
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:30,580
Newport Beach

2131
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:32,580
Case 15 years ago
Newport Beach

2132
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:32,620
Newport Beach

2133
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:33,040
Taking everything our family has
Newport Beach

2134
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,910
This car stops: Tokyo Chuanpin
Taking everything our family has

2135
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:35,580
This car stops: Tokyo Chuanpin

2136
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:36,040
But the FBI
This car stops: Tokyo Chuanpin

2137
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,450
But the FBI

2138
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:40,540
But caught the wrong criminal and declared the case closed

2139
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,450
Catching the wrong criminal

2140
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,080
Four years later

2141
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,790
The copycat was caught

2142
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:46,910
Atlanta: 15 years ago
The copycat was caught

2143
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:47,950
Atlanta: 15 years ago

2144
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:50,870
I recognize that person's face

2145
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:54,000
One of the criminals who kidnapped my father 15 years ago

2146
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,080
Like that

2147
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:56,950
But my testimony

2148
01:22:57,290 --> 01:22:59,500
Hidden by the FBI

2149
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,910
Just to beat people becomes a trick

2150
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:07,200
That's why you hate the FBI

2151
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:10,700
My father was accused of being unbearable in the US.

2152
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,290
We really can't live in America anymore

2153
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:14,950
That's why you came to Japan

2154
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:18,120
After coming to Japan

2155
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:21,700
I was investigating this case 15 years ago online

2156
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,450
I found a woman who has the same hatred as me

2157
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,830
Maiko Shirasu

2158
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:27,750
He is your accomplice, right

2159
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:29,080
Right

2160
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:34,370
Go out

2161
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:36,080
stop

2162
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,120
bastard

2163
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:40,580
father

2164
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:41,410
Young Detective

2165
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:43,290
What happened to Huihara
Young Detective

2166
01:23:43,290 --> 01:23:43,330
Young Detective

2167
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:44,000
how is the situation?
Young Detective

2168
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:45,660
Are you ok

2169
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,000
Hurry up and answer me Huibara

2170
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:48,580
Haibara

2171
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:49,870
Haibara

2172
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:51,750
Perpetrators run away

2173
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,330
At Xingangbin . Station

2174
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:54,370
Unlucky

2175
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:56,660
Halo

2176
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,040
Sensei where are you

2177
01:23:59,450 --> 01:24:00,790
Okay, I understand

2178
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:02,500
Go to Xingangbin right?

2179
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:03,500
Camel

2180
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:04,370
Well

2181
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,870
Compared to when we met before

2182
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:17,950
He looks like a different person

2183
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,450
By the way, are you ?

2184
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,040
I asked my brother to protect Yumimi

2185
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,160
There is such a thing

2186
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,910
Edogawa Conan

2187
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,410
What's up son?

2188
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:29,910
Shizuoka

2189
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:33,160
Such a big man runs really fast

2190
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:35,910
And even the escape car is ready

2191
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:40,370
The world's first vacuum superconducting high-speed train

2192
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:41,910
Ok everyone back

2193
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,870
No, right?

2194
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:45,950
Fast cars are coming

2195
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,120
At least go to the platform and have a look before leaving

2196
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:49,830
How do doctors?

2197
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:51,700
Looks like I can only make one trip

2198
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,750
Shouldn't be able to catch up

2199
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:57,950
Unlucky

2200
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,290
Ran

2201
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:00,950
Help me contact the Megure Police Department

2202
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:06,870
I will ask the teacher for help next

2203
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:09,410
Talking to you on the phone

2204
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:11,700
That's what you call yourself

2205
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,000
There are two people

2206
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:14,870
What did you say

2207
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:18,450
One of them is the person you call teacher

2208
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:21,000
The other one is the one carrying the rifle

2209
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,450
Maybe from the FBI

2210
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:24,540
Shibahama

2211
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:27,540
The train will arrive at Shibahama Station in 10 minutes
Shibahama

2212
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:29,200
Slowly now

2213
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:31,500
The phone rings

2214
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:40,660
Shinichi where are you

2215
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:41,830
Dad called me and said

2216
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,830
He was at the Gangbei Exit in Xingangbin

2217
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:46,200
Loss of prisoners

2218
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:47,290
Shinichi

2219
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:49,790
cellphone

2220
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:52,120
you brought two

2221
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:54,290
Yes

2222
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:55,750
Yes

2223
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:56,580
guru

2224
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,200
Where is the culprit now?

2225
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:00,700
Near Gangbei Exit

2226
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:03,950
If the prisoners depart from Xingangbin and take the Gangbei Exit

2227
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:04,790
Xinganghama Third Keihin Port Northern Transportation Hub
If the prisoners depart from Xingangbin and take the Gangbei Exit

2228
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:04,830
Xinganghama Third Keihin Port Northern Transportation Hub

2229
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:05,910
Must ready
Xinganghama Third Keihin Port Northern Transportation Hub

2230
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:05,950
Xinganghama Third Keihin Port Northern Transportation Hub

2231
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:07,870
Let's take the third Keihin to Tokyo

2232
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,290
He might as well just be hiding

2233
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:13,750
Actually, I went to the beach area along the bottom line

2234
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:14,910
What's the photo?

2235
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:16,580
According to me

2236
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:19,830
Don't think about things that are too complicated

2237
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,830
For example

2238
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:23,700
Industrial Avenue di depan Gangbei Exit

2239
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:23,870
Stretches east-west

2240
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:26,290
Gangbei Industrial Road Gangbin Transportation Center Gangbei Overpass
Stretches east-west

2241
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:26,870
If you go west

2242
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:27,660
Tsurumi River
If you go west

2243
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:27,790
If you go west

2244
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:27,950
Will cross the Kamoike Bridge across the Tsurumi River

2245
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:30,790
Jembatan Kamoike Sungai Tsurumi
Will cross the Kamoike Bridge across the Tsurumi River

2246
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:31,870
Now this time

2247
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:32,750
You should be able to see the fast train on the bridge

2248
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:34,580
Vacuum superconducting magnetic levitation train
You should be able to see the fast train on the bridge

2249
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:34,870
Vacuum superconducting magnetic levitation train

2250
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:35,950
Could it be?

2251
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:38,500
Did the perpetrator chase the fast train?

2252
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:40,160
I'm afraid so

2253
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:41,500
Jodie

2254
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:42,870
I understand

2255
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:43,750
Camel

2256
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:44,540
Yes

2257
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:46,040
Go to Yachi Bridge now

2258
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,040
good

2259
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,790
Conan, your two cell phones

2260
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:53,750
Can you show me

2261
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:55,120
I also want to know who I am

2262
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:56,080
Who's this

2263
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:01,370
Or are you saying that for a reason

2264
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:02,950
Can't let me see

2265
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:14,450
plan

2266
01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:14,950
Notice: Five minutes before the train arrives at Shibahama Station

2267
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:16,700
There he is

2268
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,200
Beginning

2269
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:22,540
what sound

2270
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:24,200
is it possible

2271
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:25,830
The train is going fast

2272
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:28,830
Shibahama Station is almost there

2273
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:30,410
Gotta start slowing down

2274
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:33,080
Does he still want Mr. Alan's life?

2275
01:27:34,830 --> 01:27:37,250
He really intended to use this "Japanese bullet".

2276
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:41,500
find it

2277
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,330
Black German car

2278
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:44,700
It should be that one

2279
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:45,660
careful

2280
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:46,250
Well

2281
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:49,160
What's with that car?

2282
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:50,580
Do not dare to show up?

2283
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:53,410
Start chasing

2284
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,870
At this speed, the wheel cannot be lowered

2285
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:02,120
The magnetic pole of the track cannot be reversed

2286
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:04,620
Is there no way to solve it?

2287
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:06,500
There's no point if you ask me

2288
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:07,330
In a fast car

2289
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:09,250
There are manual taxis, right?

2290
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:11,620
Connect to main control room to receive signal

2291
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,580
Maybe they can fight together

2292
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:15,410
no

2293
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,870
How can ordinary people drive?

2294
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:17,540
Besides, it's still a child

2295
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:18,950
Less bullshit and hurry up

2296
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,950
No brakes not responding

2297
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:29,160
unlucky

2298
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:31,290
Haibara, we did it according to the requirements of the main control room

2299
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:32,830
But the train still doesn't slow down

2300
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:33,200
Current speed 1000km/h

2301
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,160
Why doesn't the speed change at all
Current speed 1000km/h

2302
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:35,200
Current speed 1000km/h

2303
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,200
Can't find the reason
Current speed 1000km/h

2304
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:39,000
It is said that even the main control room cannot be controlled

2305
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,080
how

2306
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:42,790
Unknown programs take control of the system

2307
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:44,290
That's why I can't stop

2308
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:45,750
In other words

2309
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:48,910
Perpetrators set up other systems first

2310
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:51,080
What will happen like this?

2311
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:53,950
After the track is completely turned off

2312
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:56,580
The buoyancy of magnetic levitation will be lost

2313
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:58,330
The train slows down gradually

2314
01:28:58,370 --> 01:28:59,370
finally

2315
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:01,040
The body of the car will touch the ground

2316
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:04,080
Emergency landing

2317
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:05,370
It does not matter

2318
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,370
As long as the train's superconducting magnets don't fail

2319
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:09,790
The car will not slip

2320
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,290
Even if the speed drops

2321
01:29:11,330 --> 01:29:12,620
The train can still

2322
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:14,250
Landing in a relatively balanced position

2323
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:16,750
Who are you

2324
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:20,120
Just an elementary school student who really likes science

2325
01:29:23,330 --> 01:29:23,910
What has happened

2326
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:35,290
camel

2327
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:37,000
Is it okay with your car skills?

2328
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:37,910
of course

2329
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,910
But I'm not used to the road conditions in this area

2330
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:40,660
No problem

2331
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:41,540
I'll show you the way

2332
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:42,000
Shuichi Akai

2333
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,790
Don't leave it to me
Shuichi Akai

2334
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:46,750
I already remember all the maps in the area

2335
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,040
Well

2336
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:50,120
Um I thought about it

2337
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:53,410
Trick win

2338
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:57,830
First, the offensive must be divided into two groups

2339
01:29:58,290 --> 01:29:59,500
Joed, Camel

2340
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:00,580
You are divided into two groups

2341
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,080
Akai, we are divided into two teams

2342
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:11,200
What to do next show

2343
01:30:11,950 --> 01:30:13,410
The first way remains the same

2344
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:14,700
Camel kept chasing

2345
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:18,200
The second way is standby at the next location

2346
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:19,830
Standby

2347
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,540
This is an irregular cover layout

2348
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:25,540
It only takes five steps for the public

2349
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:29,250
Too slow

2350
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:30,330
Let's go after the culprit

2351
01:30:30,370 --> 01:30:31,000
We got the news

2352
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,410
Fast train speed out of control

2353
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:35,500
it will hit Shibahama station in five minutes

2354
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:39,200
What did you say

2355
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:40,950
Everyone

2356
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,660
Please keep calm and don't stop

2357
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:45,200
Everyone is behind me

2358
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:46,660
Don't worry, professor

2359
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,370
What happened

2360
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:54,500
What

2361
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:55,040
Was it an earthquake?

2362
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:57,580
The body of the carriage is too vibrating and can't stay still

2363
01:30:58,370 --> 01:30:59,040
car door

2364
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:07,330
Why the car body becomes so unstable

2365
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:07,950
Okay, I understand

2366
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:09,870
I just checked with the main control room

2367
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:12,450
Liquid helium in the car quickly leaked

2368
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:13,950
Is that a quell again?

2369
01:31:17,290 --> 01:31:18,790
Nothing happens wherever you press

2370
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:19,700
Edogawa

2371
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:22,330
The superconducting magnets of the high-speed train have cooling

2372
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:23,750
so be it

2373
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:24,910
No wonder there was an explosion just now

2374
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,620
I will slip if I don't want to find a way

2375
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:28,660
How to do

2376
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:29,750
see

2377
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:31,000
Bad situation

2378
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:35,330
Conan

2379
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:37,620
Ran

2380
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:42,450
Ran

2381
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:44,620
Edogawa

2382
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,830
The location where you were just now was the sub-control room

2383
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:51,120
Maybe in the car cabin

2384
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,080
Brakes can still be used

2385
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:55,040
I understand thank you

2386
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:55,580
As soon as possible

2387
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,250
The first step

2388
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:00,120
Attacker leaves

2389
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:02,330
Gusei Station near Hachioji . Street

2390
01:32:02,330 --> 01:32:02,910
Hideichi Akai James Black dan Judy Stylin

2391
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:04,450
Camel, you go to Guxi Station
Hideichi Akai James Black dan Judy Stylin

2392
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:06,160
if that's the problem

2393
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:08,290
Wasn't it getting further and further away from the prisoner's car?

2394
01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:09,660
Stop talking nonsense and go to Guxi Station

2395
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:10,200
okay

2396
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:15,080
Isn't that car chasing me?

2397
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:16,660
The second stage

2398
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:20,080
Defenders drive along Route 109 to Umenoki

2399
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:27,410
Just in front

2400
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:30,160
what's that

2401
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:33,870
How to do

2402
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,160
Continue like this

2403
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:38,040
Calling Yuanzi

2404
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:38,660
Sonoko
Calling Yuanzi

2405
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:39,750
Ran

2406
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:42,660
Shibahama Station is in chaos as the fast train goes out of control

2407
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:45,660
WSG forced to postpone opening ceremony

2408
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:47,370
Even an evacuation warning was issued

2409
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:48,160
Impossible

2410
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,950
You are on the Shinkansen

2411
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:50,910
It should be fine

2412
01:32:51,290 --> 01:32:52,870
I'm fine

2413
01:32:52,910 --> 01:32:53,790
But the problem is

2414
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,750
We called ai-chan

2415
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:57,000
But he didn't answer

2416
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,540
We are still afraid of the accident

2417
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:00,660
Ai-chan with me

2418
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:01,540
But Conan

2419
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:03,160
haibara right next to you

2420
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:04,330
Then tell him quickly

2421
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:06,000
new kamen yaiba

2422
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:07,040
It was from the sky

2423
01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:09,040
Get off with a parachute

2424
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:10,580
very cool

2425
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,080
parachute

2426
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:16,950
parachute

2427
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:21,080
no

2428
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:23,580
The brakes here don't seem to work either

2429
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,660
At a loss

2430
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,660
Conan what are you doing?

2431
01:33:27,790 --> 01:33:30,160
Nothing I thought about what this is for

2432
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:31,950
Can Edogawa hear it?

2433
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:42,040
Caught

2434
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,080
Umenoki

2435
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:44,120
unlucky

2436
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:51,290
What is the origin of the car?

2437
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:10,200
I will go after

2438
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,120
third step

2439
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,080
Attacker heading to Loop Line 2

2440
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,750
Go to Carmel on Loop Line 2

2441
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,250
But

2442
01:34:19,290 --> 01:34:21,120
I finally caught up with that prisoner

2443
01:34:21,450 --> 01:34:22,000
camel

2444
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:23,870
I go

2445
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,000
Xingangbin Third Keihin Loop Line 2

2446
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:38,500
This is a car that really humiliates the perpetrator

2447
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:39,700
wrong

2448
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:41,500
He's still here

2449
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:43,540
Understand?

2450
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:45,040
Even if the brakes really fail

2451
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:47,200
Other devices may still work

2452
01:34:47,950 --> 01:34:48,830
so be it

2453
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:49,830
When everything is ready

2454
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:51,250
Just press the blue button

2455
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:52,500
thank you

2456
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:55,580
Then we will listen to Rans suggestion

2457
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:57,700
Move to the driver's seat in the back

2458
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:59,080
I want to live here

2459
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:00,830
In terms of

2460
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:02,000
We'd better split up

2461
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,080
If you hear my voice there

2462
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,500
That's the signal of the action

2463
01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:08,500
good

2464
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,500
Tamachi Loop Route 2 Shinkohama Ketiga Keihin Tokyo terikat

2465
01:35:14,410 --> 01:35:15,370
What has happened

2466
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:19,370
how

2467
01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:44,450
fourth step

2468
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:47,250
The defender changes lane to the side of the road

2469
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:48,830
This guy

2470
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:58,660
Not anymore

2471
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:00,250
We can't catch up

2472
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:01,040
mission fails

2473
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:02,500
There is no fifth step

2474
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:05,700
Attacker walking under the Xingangbin Earth Bridge

2475
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:06,660
General

2476
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:07,290
Jodie

2477
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,160
Really coming

2478
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:15,200
parking

2479
01:36:15,370 --> 01:36:16,580
What is this man doing?

2480
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:29,750
There should be some distance from the front of the car

2481
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:32,910
Okay

2482
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,620
Tie this end

2483
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:37,290
My work is done

2484
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:40,700
I will wait for Conan's next signal

2485
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:54,040
finally achieved

2486
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:56,370
now

2487
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:57,950
will be

2488
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,790
What a big parachute

2489
01:37:25,450 --> 01:37:27,160
Stop for me

2490
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:40,830
Conan

2491
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,410
Damn how can I die here

2492
01:37:58,450 --> 01:37:59,830
Conan

2493
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:33,040
how

2494
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:36,540
Monitoring on the car is restored

2495
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:38,620
get out of the way

2496
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:42,500
Not here

2497
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:45,700
Sorry to let me

2498
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:05,910
Conan

2499
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:06,950
will be

2500
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:10,450
Please answer me quickly

2501
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:11,700
Edogawa

2502
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:15,080
Young Detective

2503
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:15,870
Haibara
Young Detective

2504
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:16,120

Ran-neechan
Young Detective

2508
01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:18,660
Ran-neechan

2509
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:20,790
Do not worry

2510
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:23,080
Everyone is fine

2511
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:41,580
The perpetrator took the initiative to shoot the gun

2512
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:44,700
What kind of magic show do you use

2513
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:47,620
This is not magic but shogi

2514
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:48,830
Shogi

2515
01:39:50,370 --> 01:39:51,830
I have the best in Japan

2516
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,290
wrong

2517
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:56,450
It should be said to be the number one mind in the world

2518
01:40:00,910 --> 01:40:02,040
FBI

2519
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:02,410
Federal Bureau of Investigation

2520
01:40:02,410 --> 01:40:04,500
Lying on the ground with head in hand
Federal Bureau of Investigation

2521
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,040
Lying on the ground with head in hand

2522
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:07,040
Turns out it was from the FBI

2523
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:22,450
FBI

2524
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:26,040
Is the FBI hiding my confession?

2525
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:28,040
15 years ago

2526
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:30,200
I witnessed the incident with my own eyes

2527
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:33,540
But you caught Ishihara

2528
01:40:33,580 --> 01:40:35,250
Call a person named Makoto Ishihara

2529
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:37,200
Slander as a criminal

2530
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:38,910
Detainee 15 years ago

2531
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:40,040
Makoto Ishihara

2532
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:41,450
Nonsense

2533
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:42,540
He doesn't talk nonsense

2534
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:45,870
The impersonator was arrested four years later

2535
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:46,950
Confess yourself

2536
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:49,120
The person you see

2537
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:50,910
Actually a copycat

2538
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:53,040
In that case 15 years ago

2539
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:56,000
He is Makoto Ishihara's partner

2540
01:40:56,290 --> 01:40:57,250
you're lying

2541
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:58,870
Then why are you

2542
01:40:58,910 --> 01:41:01,290
When that man was arrested 11 years ago

2543
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:03,620
Not announced to the public

2544
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:05,000
He was also an accomplice in the case 15 years ago

2545
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:05,370
James Black |

2546
01:41:05,370 --> 01:41:07,160
Due to judicial transactions
James Black |

2547
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:07,370
James Black |

2548
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,040
We no longer hold him accountable for his past crimes

2549
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,660
The condition is that he must acknowledge the names of his accomplices

2550
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:14,250
so are we

2551
01:41:14,290 --> 01:41:17,450
not holding him accountable in the case 15 years ago

2552
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,120
That's why we didn't announce it to the public

2553
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:22,790
Ayah Shirato Maiko

2554
01:41:22,830 --> 01:41:23,830
Makoto Ishihara

2555
01:41:24,450 --> 01:41:28,120
He's an accomplice to the prisoners who kidnapped your father

2556
01:41:28,830 --> 01:41:31,330
You actually became an accomplice of this kind of person

2557
01:41:31,370 --> 01:41:33,370
For unnecessary revenge

2558
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:34,790
Become a criminal

2559
01:41:34,950 --> 01:41:35,700
no

2560
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:39,000
Everything is to blame for your assertive judicial dealings

2561
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:40,700
Is this a self-serving judicial transaction?

2562
01:41:40,910 --> 01:41:42,000
That's right

2563
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:45,250
This is the dirty trick you are the best at

2564
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:47,250
So our talented family will

2565
01:41:47,290 --> 01:41:48,450
Then your family

2566
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:51,700
Why can we get away with US accusations?

2567
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,040
What's the matter

2568
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:56,830
Able to pull ridiculous revenge jokes

2569
01:41:57,330 --> 01:41:58,580
What do you want to say

2570
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:01,950
Precisely because you have been able to change your name and surname through the Witness Protection Program

2571
01:42:02,290 --> 01:42:03,250
Isn't that?

2572
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:08,580
Isn't this what you call it?

2573
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:10,950
Part of that dirty judicial deal

2574
01:42:24,830 --> 01:42:25,620
Where is the culprit?

2575
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:26,750
it's here

2576
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:34,290
Let's leave it to the Japanese police.

2577
01:42:39,330 --> 01:42:40,250
Conan

2578
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:41,250
will be

2579
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:41,910
Tokyo Fire Department

2580
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:42,870
Are you okay
Tokyo Fire Department

2581
01:42:42,870 --> 01:42:42,910
Tokyo Fire Department

2582
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:44,250
How was the injury?
Tokyo Fire Department

2583
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:46,290
I only got a few scratches

2584
01:42:46,370 --> 01:42:47,540
me too

2585
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:49,330
are you okay

2586
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:51,120
Who is it?

2587
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:55,750
That's the suspect, Maiko Shiraito

2588
01:42:55,790 --> 01:42:56,910
I leave it to you

2589
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:00,000
Yes

2590
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:00,950
Pay attention to slow down during construction ahead
Yes

2591
01:43:00,950 --> 01:43:01,000
Pay attention to slow down during construction ahead

2592
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:01,540
He is still alive
Pay attention to slow down during construction ahead

2593
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:01,790
He is still alive

2594
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:03,540
Worth the show

2595
01:43:03,950 --> 01:43:06,410
Really can use magnetic levitation path to hit tough snipers

2596
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:09,330
Also accurately dodge the fine points

2597
01:43:09,870 --> 01:43:11,700
No one can do it except you

2598
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:13,040
No, this is not my credit

2599
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:16,040
It was all that kid's idea

2600
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:20,410
Is everyone's cell phone ringing?

2601
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:24,290
I sent an email to Mr Alan then

2602
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:25,790
Beg him when the situation is critical

2603
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:26,410
Bring the prisoner's shoulder to that position

2604
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:28,160
Please help if necessary... Avoid hitting the prisoner's vital organs on the shoulder... the center of the roof
Bring the prisoner's shoulder to that position

2605
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,540
Bring the prisoner's shoulder to that position

2606
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:31,450
Higher English

2607
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:32,950
Defeat

2608
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:33,660
Return

2609
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:35,620
It turned out like this

2610
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:45,200
No matter how cruel the prisoner is, he can't kill him

2611
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:48,450
It seems this is the boy's principle

2612
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:51,620
Different from our FBI

2613
01:43:58,410 --> 01:44:00,950
I love that jacket

2614
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:02,660
forget it

2615
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:08,450
Come back

2616
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:11,450
okay

2617
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:15,700
When you pull the trigger

2618
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:18,750
Pale and sudden emptiness

2619
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:22,620
Chaos and glare obscure the truth

2620
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:26,910
Baptism that brings endless darkness

2621
01:48:34,450 --> 01:48:35,700
I parked the car there

2622
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:36,790
Come and get it

2623
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:37,830
good

2624
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:38,830
other than that

2625
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:41,580
There are two other guests in my car

2626
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:43,950
I hope you can send them home safely

2627
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,620
Troublesome for you, Camel

2628
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,370
FBI kid

2629
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:00,950
I don't know where you come from

2630
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:02,200
All because of you

2631
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:05,370
An important figure in our country is almost in trouble

2632
01:49:07,330 --> 01:49:09,000
Luck this time

2633
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,580
I'll let you go if things don't become a big deal

2634
01:49:12,450 --> 01:49:14,410
Don't think there's another time

2635
01:49:27,370 --> 01:49:28,870
Child?

2636
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:33,580
Don't you remember

2637
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:35,580
You clearly agreed to my marriage proposal

2638
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:36,250
do not remember

2639
01:49:36,290 --> 01:49:38,000
I fainted, I have no impression at all

2640
01:49:38,660 --> 01:49:39,660
how

2641
01:49:41,370 --> 01:49:44,660
I remember apparently throwing up in whose car

2642
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:49,040
Drive safely, slow down

2643
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,870
What smell is this?

2644
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Hi guys

2645
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,000
It's time for you to play

2646
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Oh!

2647
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
