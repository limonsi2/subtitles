5
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:46,533
- How's it looking,
Mayor Givens?

6
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:50,100
- Hey, Cassie, everything is
coming together perfectly.

7
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:52,033
- Oh, my.
This time tomorrow,

8
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:55,367
Dickens, Ohio becomes
Victorian London.

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,900
- It's gonna
be a wonderful week.

10
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,767
- Oh, it depends on your
grand finale, doesn't it?

11
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,667
Now, how are things looking
over at the theater?

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,166
- I'm gonna say it,

13
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,967
this is going to
be the best version

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,133
of "A Christmas Carol"
this town has ever seen.

15
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:09,600
- It's
the 100th anniversary

16
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:12,133
of our town's production
of the play, Cassie.

17
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:14,300
It has to be better
than the best.

18
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,767
- Well, technically
better than the best

19
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,867
still makes it the best,
am I right?

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,467
It will be.

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,100
- Well, when you have
a seasoned veteran

22
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:27,867
like Ray Muller playing Scrooge,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,066
it pretty well
directs itself, right?

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,300
- Well, not really.

25
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:32,533
I mean, okay,

26
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,400
so this one time
when I was at NYU,

27
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,000
I was-
- oh, Harry!

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,734
I'll just be over
here if you need me.

29
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:51,200
Some of these flats
are older than I am.

30
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,600
I wonder if we should
touch up the edges a bit?

31
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:54,767
- Hey, guys.

32
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,066
- Ah, Matt, you read my mind.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,233
Thank you. You guys, your paint.

34
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:01,200
You're great.

35
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,800
- You got it, Cassie.

36
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:04,333
- Andy Fitzgerald,
"Dickens Gazette."

37
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:06,600
- Ah, Andy.
I know who you are.

38
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:07,934
You, uh, you've been
my parents' neighbor

39
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:08,967
for like 30 years.

40
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,266
- I got a part-time job

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,667
as a reporter with the paper.

42
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,200
It's a bucket list thing.

43
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,700
Just go with it.

44
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,734
- Is this for that Arts
and Entertainment section?

45
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:19,767
- Mayor's got us doing a
special Dickens Day edition.

46
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,066
He wants this year's production

47
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,467
to get as much
press as possible.

48
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,834
- Oh, that's good,

49
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:27,066
because people are
going to love it.

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,600
At least I hope they love it.

51
00:02:28,734 --> 00:02:31,033
It's just, the cast has
been working so hard, right?

52
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,333
And I know how much this play

53
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:33,934
means to people
during the holiday.

54
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:36,467
- I wonder though, isn't
directing local theater

55
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
kind of a step
down from Broadway?

56
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:42,300
- Um, well,

57
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,734
I wasn't ever actually
on Broadway per se.

58
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:46,834
- Well, that's not
what your mom says.

59
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,800
- Well, see, I directed

60
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:50,367
a couple of shows off Broadway-

61
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,633
- And how far off?

62
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:53,400
- Off, off. Like,
you needed a car.

63
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:55,300
Okay, listen, the
mayor brought me on

64
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,900
because I know this play
backwards and forwards.

65
00:02:58,033 --> 00:02:59,133
I grew up with it.

66
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,533
My first role was in this play.

67
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,567
- Ebenezer's lost love, Belle.

68
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,066
- Uh, no. Cratchit
daughter number three.

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,400
- Hmm.
- No lines, but, well,

70
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:09,433
I created a complex
backstory for her, okay?

71
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:10,667
- Hmm.
- And I was only six.

72
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,033
- Maybe I should get
a quote from Ray,

73
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,834
the Sir Patrick Stewart
of Central Ohio.

74
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:16,967
Is Ray here?

75
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,433
- Uh-
Where's our Scrooge?

76
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:20,567
- You know, he should've
been here a few minutes ago.

77
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,233
- Give me a call when
the star of the show

78
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:24,000
gets here, okay?

79
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:24,934
- Okay.

80
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,567
Okay, so, so remember Tiny Tim

81
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:37,800
doesn't feel sorry for himself.

82
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:40,166
He has a really positive spirit,

83
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,033
which is ultimately what
gets Scrooge to change.

84
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,533
- So I shouldn't act sick?

85
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,500
- Just let his sickness
show only on the outside.

86
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:48,934
On the inside, Tiny Tim

87
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:51,033
is like any other
happy-go-lucky kid.

88
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,433
- What about the crutch,
can I still use that?

89
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,333
- Yes, just try not
to wave it around

90
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:57,800
like a lightsaber on show night.

91
00:03:57,934 --> 00:03:58,700
Deal?
- Deal.

92
00:03:58,834 --> 00:03:59,834
- Okay.

93
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,133
- I'd better get going.

94
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:03,667
My mom's over there.
- Okay, I'll walk you.

95
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,967
- My mom said you were
like the best actor

96
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,100
in Dickens growing up.

97
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:08,767
- Aw, that's nice.

98
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,533
I, uh, I wasn't bad.

99
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,600
Okay, bye.
- Bye, Cassie.

100
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:13,567
- Hey, Brandon!

101
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,400
- Hi, Marilyn.
- Hi!

102
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:15,867
- Hi, Mom.

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,934
- Hey, you. getting in
some extra rehearsal time?

104
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:19,200
- Yeah, yeah.

105
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,200
Brandon is just so committed

106
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,233
to doing a great
job as Tiny Tim.

107
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:24,900
- A director's
job is never done.

108
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:27,700
- No, not until everyone
takes a bow.

109
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:31,133
Um, did you tell Andy
I was on Broadway?

110
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,567
- Oh, I might've
said something. Why?

111
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,400
- Well, because
apparently everyone thinks

112
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:40,633
I'm some big director
that's got this in the bag.

113
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:43,166
- Don't you?
- I hope so.

114
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,066
But I haven't worked as a
director in five years, right?

115
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,100
I'm not exactly brimming
with confidence.

116
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,567
- I blame David.

117
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,033
I mean, you took time off

118
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,333
to help him start his business.

119
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:54,000
And what did he do in return?

120
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:55,433
- Well, he amicably agreed

121
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:57,367
to a divorce and
fair settlement,

122
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,900
which is the whole reason
I get to have this time

123
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,500
to figure out my next steps.

124
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:03,233
- Well, would it be good to know

125
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:04,567
that the Palmer's are hiring

126
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,767
someone in accounts payable

127
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,433
and I can put in a good word?
- Uh,

128
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,233
I will keep that in mind.

129
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:11,667
Oh, oh, that's the mayor.

130
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Uh, I gotta go.

131
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:15,233
- Okay. Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

132
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,767
- Cassie, I'm sorry
for taking you

133
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,166
away from everything,

134
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,000
but, um, this is something
we should discuss

135
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:25,100
away from the rest of the cast.

136
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:27,900
- I had a feeling this
was gonna be an issue.

137
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:31,066
Ray, I can only
imagine how weird

138
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,133
this must be for you to
have your former student

139
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,567
now be your director,

140
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,867
but if something's wrong,
you can talk to me.

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,033
- That is the issue, Cassie.

142
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,233
He can't talk at all.

143
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:43,667
Raymond has laryngitis.

144
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,000
- Oh. Oh, okay.

145
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:51,166
Uh, Ray, I'm sure
you're gonna be fine.

146
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,200
I mean, you know,
all of your blocking

147
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,900
and your lines, right?

148
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,567
And I'm sure your
famous lemon-ginger tea

149
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,367
is gonna clear up your
throat lickety-split,

150
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,667
right before the show
on Christmas Eve.

151
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,333
- It's not that's
simple, Cassie.

152
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:04,734
Raymond has a
large vocal nodule.

153
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,300
- Oh.
- 40 years of performing

154
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:11,433
and teaching have finally
caught up with him.

155
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:13,667
And he is on strict vocal rest.

156
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,767
Not a peep for a month if
he wants to avoid surgery.

157
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,500
- Oh no, no Ray, I'm sorry.

158
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:23,133
I can only imagine how
hard this is for you.

159
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:25,333
- I know Ray is irreplaceable,

160
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:30,166
but I'm gonna have to find
someone else to play Scrooge.

161
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,533
Who's his understudy?

162
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:32,500
- Daniel Gary.

163
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:35,033
- And he's what, not good?

164
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,333
- Daniel won a trip to Jamaica,

165
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,233
and because Ray has
never missed a show,

166
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:39,734
I told him to go.

167
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,934
- I hate to say this,

168
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:45,967
but we may need to
cancel the play.

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,367
- What?

170
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,533
This is the longest running
production in the country.

171
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,400
We just need to find
another Scrooge.

172
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:55,033
- Who could possibly
fill Ray's shoes?

173
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,934
His Scrooge is iconic!

174
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,900
- Okay, I completely agree,

175
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:01,333
but I can just call some
of my theater friends

176
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:02,600
in New York, right?

177
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:04,200
I'm sure one of them
is gonna know a name

178
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,467
that we can hire to come
out and do the show.

179
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,200
- We don't have the budget
to hire a big actor.

180
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,233
Besides, this is
community theater,

181
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:13,767
it has to be someone
from Dickens.

182
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,467
Jake Dorsey.

183
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,867
I like it. I like it a lot.

184
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,767
- No, it's not good.

185
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,667
I don't like it.
- Why not?

186
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,900
Jake is the biggest name

187
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:24,500
that's ever come
out of this town.

188
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:25,433
- Yep.

189
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,100
- I can't think of a better way

190
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,967
to promote Dickens Days.

191
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,266
And he'd definitely
draws a big crowd.

192
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,100
- Mayor Givens,
he's an action star.

193
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,867
Okay? The guy's a super cheese.

194
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,367
There's no way he could handle

195
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,066
a complex role like Scrooge.

196
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,100
- He's a professional
actor, Cassie.

197
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,834
I'm sure he could
learn the part,

198
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:45,567
especially with your help.

199
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,734
- And his nephew is
playing Tiny Tim.

200
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:48,934
I bet he'd love to do it.

201
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:50,567
- I'm sure he's busy.

202
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,433
- Only one way to
find out, call him.

203
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:55,200
- Oh, you
think Jake Dorsey

204
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,667
is gonna take my call?

205
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,867
- Why not?

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,300
You were both in
Ray's theater class

207
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:00,600
together, weren't you?

208
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:02,667
- Yeah, but, you know,
we really weren't close.

209
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,500
You know, he was more
behind the scenes

210
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:06,200
and I was, you know.

211
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,900
- Cassie.
- What?

212
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:12,500
- Please get his number from
his brother and call him.

213
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:13,767
It's either that

214
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,533
or we'll have to
cancel the play.

215
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,934
- Do the right thing,

216
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:34,800
or it's the last
thing you'll do.

217
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,867
- Cut, cut. Cut, cut.

218
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,934
- Are we good? You got that?

219
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:39,600
- That was excellent.

220
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:41,300
All right, yeah. Are we good?

221
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:42,800
- Uh, let's take it again, Jake.

222
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:43,967
- Do we need to take it again,

223
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,000
or do you just
wanna take it again?

224
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,233
- No, you were great.

225
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:47,600
Let's just, one more.
We had a technical.

226
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:49,834
- All right, everybody.
Let's go back to one.

227
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:50,734
- Let's reset.

228
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:51,667
- Oh, Denise.

229
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,433
Everybody, my agents here. Hey.

230
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,500
Hey, Dee Dee, what did they say?

231
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:55,667
Did they make me an offer?

232
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,667
- N- oh, oh, we'll talk.

233
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,266
- What is that face?
It doesn't look good.

234
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,266
- Reset!

235
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,500
Hey, you.
- Oh.

236
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:07,367
- And action!

237
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,600
- Oh, hey, Brandon.

238
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:18,066
Hi, Allison.
- Hey.

239
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,233
- Whatcha watching?

240
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:20,166
- My Uncle Jake.

241
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,800
He's doing a huge action scene.

242
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,100
- Oh.

243
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:24,100
- Do the right thing,

244
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:26,767
or it's the last
thing you'll do.

245
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,467
Do the right thing,

246
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,200
or it's the last
thing you'll do.

247
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,333
- He is so cool.

248
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:34,667
- Sure is. Yep.

249
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,100
Wait, is he shooting
a movie right now?

250
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:39,567
- Actually, it says
tomorrow's the last day.

251
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,934
- Oh, great.

252
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:42,700
- Maybe he can come
home for Christmas.

253
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,100
- Ha ha, don't
count on it, buddy.

254
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:46,433
- Hi. Hi, Craig.

255
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:47,667
- Hi, Cassie.

256
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,066
- Dad, can I have some
more fries, please?

257
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
- Oh, only because
watching you play Tiny Tim

258
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:55,300
makes me feel compelled
to overfeed you.

259
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,233
Cassie-
- Yeah?

260
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:57,467
- Brandon has been talking about

261
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,500
how much you've
been helping him.

262
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,133
- Mm, he's a natural.

263
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,400
- Well, I hope
he's not too good,

264
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,266
or he might leave
us like Jake did.

265
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,433
- He had a dream,
honey. He followed it.

266
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:06,367
- That he did.

267
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,300
- I don't know if you heard,

268
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:09,166
but Ray Muller lost his voice.

269
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,867
So-
- Yeah, what a bummer.

270
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,300
- Yeah.

271
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:14,233
- Isn't that what an
understudy is for?

272
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:15,767
- Well, yes, but,

273
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,166
okay, so the mayor
wanted me to ask Jake

274
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,367
to come home and play Scrooge,

275
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,934
and I need a way of
getting ahold of him.

276
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:27,667
- Really? That would be amazing.

277
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,900
- Well,
good luck with that.

278
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:31,533
I mean, he hasn't
been home in years.

279
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,734
- Well, I have to try, you know?

280
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,000
Otherwise, um,

281
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,133
there won't
be a play at all.

282
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,533
- Here, here's his number.

283
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,667
I would call him for you,

284
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,500
but I don't think it
would help your chances.

285
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:55,333
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

286
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:56,834
- Thanks.

287
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,367
- Did you tell them how
important this role is to me?

288
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,700
- You are literally
shooting the third movie

289
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,033
of your own franchise.

290
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,333
You have a catch phrase.

291
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:11,567
What more do you want?

292
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,133
- Okay, it is the
"Dunes of Eastlynn,"

293
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:15,500
it is my mother's favorite book.

294
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,900
She'd be very proud if she knew

295
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:18,467
that I was playing
the role of Travis.

296
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,200
I mean, I'm perfect for it.

297
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,700
- I get it, I do.

298
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,200
- I've made you a
lot of money, Denise.

299
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,367
All I'm asking is for you
to get me in the room.

300
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,367
- I will do everything
I can, all right?

301
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,900
But, please, don't
get your hopes up.

302
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:34,367
You know how these things go.

303
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
- Aren't, aren't
you supposed to be

304
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:36,967
my biggest cheerleader?

305
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,033
- I am. You are amazing.

306
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,033
I just, I have to take
this call, all right?

307
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,533
We'll talk. I promise.

308
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,000
Hello.

309
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:46,934
- Here you go, with all
the usual accoutrements.

310
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,934
That is French for
high-maintenance actor.

311
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,767
- I'm okay. Thanks, Ben.

312
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,700
- All right, then.

313
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:52,934
Well, you'll be happy to know

314
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,166
I finished the
Christmas shopping

315
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,567
for your brother, his
wife, and Brandon.

316
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,533
- What'd I get them?

317
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:57,800
- Oh, you were very generous.

318
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,233
Craig got a new
set of golf clubs,

319
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:00,633
Allison got a personalized
charcuterie board,

320
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:04,100
and Brandon got a
top-of-the-line gaming headset.

321
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:05,767
- You're the best.
- I know,

322
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,367
which is why you got me
a VIP weekend in Vegas.

323
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,867
- You know what?

324
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,166
You should have made it a week.

325
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,000
- Oh, I did.

326
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:14,734
- Good.

327
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,834
- So we still need
two more overcoats

328
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:25,333
and a hat for Bob Cratchit.

329
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:26,266
- Yeah.

330
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:28,567
- Cassie, just make the call.

331
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,100
What's the worst
that's gonna happen?

332
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:31,033
- Oh, I don't know.

333
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,834
Uh, maybe Jake hangs up on me

334
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:34,400
and I don't get
to direct the play

335
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,400
because there is no play?

336
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,333
- Is this about you shooting
him down for the prom?

337
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,867
- Well, uh, I did
not shoot him down.

338
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,533
I told him very nicely
that I was waiting

339
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,567
for Mike Van Camp to ask me.

340
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,867
And in my defense,
he hadn't spoken

341
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
more than two words
to me before that day.

342
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,467
- Yeah, I'm sure
he's totally over it.

343
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,700
- I just know he's
probably too famous

344
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,867
to even take my call.

345
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,066
- Well, let's find out.

346
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:00,400
- You hit video.

347
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:01,300
- Oh no.

348
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,033
- Hey boss?
- Yeah?

349
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,233
- Got a 614 number here.

350
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:07,633
- 614, that's Ohio.

351
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,467
You don't, you don't
need to answer that.

352
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,633
- Oh, shoot, uh-

353
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:12,900
- Um.

354
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,400
- It's a video call.

355
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,700
- Jake! Hi.

356
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:20,133
- Cassie Pruitt?

357
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,166
- Yes, hi.

358
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,867
- He remembers you!

359
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,934
- Howdy.

360
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:27,367
- Howdy?
- Yeah.

361
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,533
- Wow. I, um, I just didn't
think you would pick up.

362
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,667
- Well, I didn't.

363
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,734
My assistant did. Say hi to Ben.

364
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:37,133
- Oh, hi!

365
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:39,100
- Hi. You haven't
changed this high school.

366
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:40,333
- Ah, thanks.

367
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,133
- Okay, so the last
I heard about you,

368
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:44,533
you were taking
Broadway by storm.

369
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,367
Are you still crushing
the Great White Way?

370
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,166
- Oh, you bet. You bet.

371
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,734
Yeah, but listen, so I'm
back in Ohio right now.

372
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,266
I'm directing "A
Christmas Carol"

373
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,700
for Dickens Days this year.

374
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,867
- You're directing. You're
not gonna act in it?

375
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,867
- Oh, well, I actually
studied directing at school.

376
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:03,000
I just, I just thought
it was more challenging.

377
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,100
- More challenging than acting?

378
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:08,300
That's a weird thing to say.

379
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:10,834
Um, well, it's cool that
you're back in Dickens.

380
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:11,900
I'm sure they're happy to have

381
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:14,600
the on-and-only Cassie Pruitt.

382
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:15,700
That's a big deal.

383
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,166
- It is a big deal, yeah.

384
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,467
- Yeah, no, I know.
I just said that.

385
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,900
- I don't, what?

386
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:24,467
- Let me ask you a question.

387
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Whenever I get a call from Ohio,

388
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:27,867
people want something,

389
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,400
like an autographed picture-
- I'm good.

390
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,767
- Or a lot of times they want me

391
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,667
to sing "Happy
Birthday" to their mom

392
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,166
and send it via video.

393
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,100
So what do you want?

394
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:39,934
- Okay. So this is the
100th Dickens Days,

395
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:41,800
which, of course, means
all eyes are gonna be

396
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:42,867
on the festival, right?

397
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,333
Especially the play.

398
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,166
- Right, I mean, the play
was the most important event.

399
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,367
- Exactly. And, okay, so
we've run into a little snag.

400
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,600
Ray Muller, who plays
Scrooge, he lost his voice.

401
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:56,533
So we don't have a Scrooge

402
00:14:56,667 --> 00:15:00,533
and the play is only a
week away on Christmas Eve.

403
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,734
- Well, Ray is irreplaceable.

404
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:05,834
- Not necessarily.

405
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:07,667
Okay, so hear me out,

406
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,166
the mayor was
wondering if maybe you

407
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,100
would come home and
take over the role.

408
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,333
- The mayor is wondering?

409
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:16,867
- I know
it's ridiculous.

410
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,166
It's so silly. I
wasn't even gonna ask.

411
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,867
- Why is it ridiculous?

412
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,700
You think it's ridiculous
because you think

413
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:27,100
I can't play Ebenezer Scrooge?

414
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:28,767
- No, it's more that I,

415
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,166
well, I didn't think you would.

416
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,400
- As it turns out,

417
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:34,567
I'm preparing for a
career-defining role.

418
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,266
Yeah, I'm, I'm not
gonna be available-

419
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,500
- Okay, but hold on, hold on,

420
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:40,200
it's just that if, if
I don't find a Scrooge,

421
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,133
there won't be a play at all.

422
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:44,066
- Well, why don't
you play Scrooge?

423
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,033
Or is it, is it not
challenging enough for you?

424
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,166
- Ooh, good. Okay.

425
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,433
Well, I just thought
I'd give it a try.

426
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,400
So good luck with your movie.

427
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,600
- Yeah, congrats
on the play. Bye.

428
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,266
- That was so weird.

429
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,533
- Yeah, that took a turn.

430
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:04,333
- Jake! How's my handsome guy?

431
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:07,100
I bring cupcakes, your favorite.

432
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,300
- You're bringing cupcakes.

433
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:10,767
Did they make me an offer?

434
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,400
- Ah, look,
I'm sorry, Jake.

435
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:15,867
They just don't think
you have the chops

436
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,033
for a dramatic part.

437
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,133
- That hurts.

438
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:20,934
- Oh, Jakey.

439
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:22,300
- Listen, is there nothing

440
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:23,967
that I can do to prove myself?

441
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,734
- Look, what
do you want me to say?

442
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:28,200
No one's just gonna hand you

443
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,900
a meaty, dramatic
role.

444
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,467
Look around. Come on.

445
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,000
You got a good thing going here.

446
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:36,266
Don't fight it.

447
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,800
- So, as much as it breaks
my heart to say this,

448
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:31,300
without Ray, there's
no Ebenezer Scrooge.

449
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:33,800
And without Ebenezer Scrooge,

450
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:36,100
there's no play.

451
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:37,934
I know, I'm so sorry.

452
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:42,467
Trust me, nobody wanted
this more than me.

453
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,967
And I just wanted to say
thank you all so much.

454
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,467
You've been great, and
this is such an honor.

455
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,667
- Bah, humbug!

456
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,600
- Excuse me, this is a
closed meeting for cast.

457
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:55,133
- Bah, humbug!

458
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:59,867
- Jake?
-

459
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,033
- Hi. Hey, what's up?

460
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,100
Hi, hi, hi.

461
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:03,300
- Yeah, hi.

462
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:04,233
Can you guys just
excuse me for one sec?

463
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,867
Yeah, sorry. Just a minute.

464
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,266
- Mm, hey, guys.

465
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,467
- What are you doing here?

466
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,000
- Well, you said you
needed an Ebenezer Scrooge.

467
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,467
Well, guess what?

468
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,633
Here I am.

469
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:16,400
- Uh, yeah, what
happened to this whole

470
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,000
career-defining role?

471
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,800
- Well, I turned it down
because I want a chance

472
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:22,400
to work with a bonafide
Broadway director.

473
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:24,266
So what, you gonna make me

474
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,967
audition for the role now, hmm?

475
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:36,667
- Okay, guys, great news,

476
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,333
uh, you have a Scrooge.

477
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:40,233
- Whoo-hoo!

478
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:43,667
- Whoo!

479
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,133
You're gonna be great.
- I am gonna be great.

480
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:47,433
- Yeah, I know, I just,

481
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:51,567
I just said that.

482
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,233
- My agent, hang on. Hello?

483
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:58,000
- Look at you directing
an A-list celebrity.

484
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:01,467
This is a huge deal.

485
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,000
- Or a huge mistake.

486
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:10,834
I'm coming to you live from
Dickens, Ohio, my hometown.

487
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:11,667
And look at this,

488
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
this is my new cast

489
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:15,533
of "A Christmas Carol."

490
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:16,533
- Do the right thing,

491
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:17,934
or it's the last
thing you'll do.

492
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:20,033
- Did you hear that, America-
- Uncle Jake!

493
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,367
- Oh! Oh!

494
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,266
It's my nephew! It's Brandon.

495
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,734
Look at this kid.

496
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:25,834
Oh, my gosh.

497
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,900
Ah! What's up?

498
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:33,367
Hi, good to see you.
- Welcome home.

499
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,633
- Hi, Craig.

500
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:36,967
- Hey.

501
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,133
Man, I cannot believe
how big you've gotten.

502
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,333
You're huge.

503
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:42,233
- That's because
you haven't seen him

504
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:43,734
since he was six.

505
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:46,133
- Hey, I was hoping
that you guys

506
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:48,834
would accept my invitation
to come out to LA.

507
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:50,867
- Yeah, well, it's kind
of hard to get away.

508
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,734
You know, with the restaurant.

509
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:54,800
- Jake, why don't I get
your bags in the car

510
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:56,033
and get you settled
in at the house?

511
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,266
- Allison, that's
so sweet of you,

512
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,667
but I'm actually
staying at the, the B&B.

513
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,934
- What? You're not
staying with us?

514
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:04,533
- Sorry, Brandon.

515
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,133
I didn't want to
impose, you know?

516
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:08,066
It's such short notice.

517
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,500
Plus, I'm gonna be
spending most of my time

518
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:10,734
trying to learn my lines.

519
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:13,100
- I can help you. I
know everyone's lines.

520
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:14,367
- Yeah, the
trick is getting him

521
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,800
not to mouth every single one.

522
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:17,667
- Does he? Does he do it?

523
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,467
- But I'll see you tomorrow
at Dickens Days, right?

524
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,000
- Let's see. Yeah, we'll see.

525
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:26,900
- Yeah, we should
probably get going.

526
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:28,734
- Yeah.
- Okay, night!

527
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,333
- Welcome home, Jake.

528
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:32,266
- Bye, Allison.

529
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:39,367
- Ah, all
right. Awesome.

530
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,600
Great rehearsal today, guys.

531
00:20:40,734 --> 00:20:43,133
I'll see you tomorrow.

532
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:45,066
- Here is your script.

533
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,333
- Thank you, boss.

534
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:48,500
Uh, I'm gonna head back

535
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:51,300
to the B&B and get settled in.

536
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:52,533
- Where all your bags?

537
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:53,734
- My assistant went
ahead with them.

538
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,100
- You brought an entourage?

539
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:56,133
- It's one guy.

540
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:58,166
- Hmm, can you walk to the B&B,

541
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,967
or do you need a limo?

542
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,734
- I can walk, as
long as somebody

543
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:03,233
rolls out a red carpet for me.

544
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:04,533
- Oh. Well, see, it's winter.

545
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:06,734
So the best I can do is
carpet of pine needles.

546
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:08,033
- Yeah? That would work.

547
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:08,834
- Yeah?
- You could do that.

548
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,066
- Great.

549
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,767
- Well, which way
are you heading?

550
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,834
- Towards the inn.

551
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:14,367
- Would you to walk with me?

552
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,767
- Sure.

553
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:24,667
So how does it feel to be back?

554
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,600
- Weird.

555
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:27,767
- Yeah, it was weird coming home

556
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,066
from New York, too.

557
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,867
Everything always seems so-
- Small.

558
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,100
- I was gonna say quiet.

559
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:35,367
- Ah, no, Malibu is quiet.
- Right.

560
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:42,367
- So I know this really
great cocoa stand

561
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,133
if you wanna, can I buy you one?

562
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,834
- Cocoa with you?
- Yeah.

563
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:51,233
- I will not say no to that.

564
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:02,200
Here you go.
- Ooh, thank you.

565
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,800
- This looks good.

566
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:06,667
Merry Christmas, thank you!

567
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,700
Wow, I mean the town
has gone all out

568
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:12,333
for Dickens Days,
this is elaborate.

569
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:13,600
- Yeah, the mayor decided

570
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,333
to really kick it up a notch-
- Here you go.

571
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,133
- For the 100th anniversary.
- Huh.

572
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:19,900
- We're even doing a
horse and carriage ride.

573
00:22:20,033 --> 00:22:21,967
- Ooh, you know, the last time

574
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,567
I was on a horse and
carriage, I had to,

575
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,200
I had to jump off
of a helicopter

576
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,100
in land mines for
an action sequence.

577
00:22:28,233 --> 00:22:31,767
- Well, I think
that is out of our budget,

578
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,900
but technically, so is
a movie star like you.

579
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:39,000
- All right, tell
you what, while I'm here,

580
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:41,500
let's, let's pretend
like I'm not famous.

581
00:22:41,633 --> 00:22:43,600
- Oh, well, you're the
one that brought it up

582
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:45,233
with the whole
helicopter thing, right?

583
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:46,767
So, yeah.
- okay, fair point.

584
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,600
- True fair point.

585
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,000
However, I have to say

586
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:51,467
that it feels weird
being back home.

587
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,200
- Why?
- I don't know.

588
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,600
Everywhere I look, I just,

589
00:22:54,734 --> 00:22:56,700
I remember all of these people

590
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,133
who didn't think I would
be successful at all.

591
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:01,934
- Is that why you
don't come home much?

592
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:05,033
- No, but it's why I
work so hard to make it.

593
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,600
Well, what about you?

594
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:09,200
How did they convince the
one-and-only Cassie Pruitt

595
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:12,500
to come home and direct
community theater?

596
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:15,633
- Well, I came back
about three months ago

597
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,533
to help out after
my mom's surgery,

598
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,233
and they needed a director.

599
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:21,900
So I just decided to
stay through Christmas.

600
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,166
- And then it's, is
it back to Broadway?

601
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,667
- Back, truth is,

602
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:30,633
I never really got there.

603
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:32,667
- Well, what does,
what does that mean?

604
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,934
- Well, it's a,

605
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:37,500
it's a long story and
a pretty short walk.

606
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:39,700
So maybe, maybe some other time.

607
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:41,166
- Okay.

608
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,500
- So what about you?

609
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:44,133
What ultimately made you decide

610
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:45,433
to come home and do the play?

611
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:46,934
- You're surprised, aren't you?

612
00:23:47,066 --> 00:23:48,233
- Considering you hung up on me?

613
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:50,300
I'd say
yeah, a little bit.

614
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:52,066
- Okay, what
exactly did you say?

615
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,700
Directing, it's more
what than acting?

616
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,500
- Challenging, but that
is not what I meant.

617
00:23:57,633 --> 00:23:59,333
- There it is.
- You took it wrong.

618
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:02,000
- Listen, Cassie, you
shot up the bat signal.

619
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:04,100
I answered your call.

620
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:06,300
If Dickens, Ohio
needs Jake Dorsey,

621
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:07,533
well then, guess what?

622
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:09,934
I'm gonna come
home, save the day.

623
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:12,800
Oh, my gosh.

624
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:15,100
Look where we are.

625
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:18,266
This is the best
job I've ever had.

626
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,700
I mean, aside from the
whole movie star thing.

627
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:21,900
- You worked here?
- What?

628
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:23,000
- You know, I
remember you worked

629
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:24,633
at your mom's restaurant, but I-

630
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:25,834
- Cassie, you used to come in

631
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:27,433
and you'd buy things
for your parents

632
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:28,967
and I was the guy
behind the register.

633
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,400
- Yes. Okay.

634
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:31,867
Yeah, it's all coming back.

635
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,834
- No.

636
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:34,800
- I remember that you were

637
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:36,567
the best set
builder we ever had.

638
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,066
And I remember that
you were really quiet,

639
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
like really quiet.
- I was shy.

640
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,066
- Aw, you were shy?

641
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,867
Is that why you never
auditioned for any parts?

642
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,433
- No, I auditioned
for every single play.

643
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,533
I never got cast because
all they saw me as

644
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:51,934
was the guy who
could build the set

645
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:54,600
and point the spotlight at you.

646
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:56,767
- Or, maybe you
weren't good enough.

647
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,633
Oh! Oh!
- Ooh!

648
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:00,834
- You don't think
I'm good enough

649
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:02,300
to play Ebenezer
Scrooge, do you?

650
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:04,300
- Well, hopefully, you
are gonna prove me wrong.

651
00:25:04,433 --> 00:25:06,133
- Yeah, I am.
- Let's do this.

652
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:21,066
So this is by far the
best B&B in Dickens.

653
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,767
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

654
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,867
- Hey, boss.

655
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,633
Bad news, the linens
aren't Egyptian cotton.

656
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:29,834
I've overnighted some,

657
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,066
but it looks like
you'll have to suffer

658
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,567
through some low thread
count percale tonight.

659
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,266
- Ben, I,

660
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,233
I don't care about these things.

661
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:37,300
- Since when?

662
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,000
Hi, uh, Ben.

663
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:43,533
I'm Jake's personal assistant.

664
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,033
- Cassie.

665
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,467
- I was just joking about
the low thread count thing.

666
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,033
- Yeah, I feel like
you weren't though.

667
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:50,900
- No, I wasn't.

668
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:52,533
- Hey, whose team are you on?

669
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,133
- Yours, of course.

670
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:56,567
Here is your key.
Everything is unpacked.

671
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,500
Text me if you need anything.

672
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:00,500
- All right. Thank you, Ben.

673
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:02,000
- So Been seems-

674
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:03,300
- Great, yeah.

675
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:04,533
Yeah. He's great.

676
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:07,000
- So is it okay if I
run everything by you

677
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,700
or do I have to go through Ben?

678
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,166
- No. Cassie, it's me.

679
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,633
You just talk to me.

680
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:15,133
- Perfect. So I'm going to
text you a rehearsal schedule.

681
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:16,767
You have a fitting
in the morning,

682
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,367
and the festival kickoff
is tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

683
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,100
- Yeah, um, I'm probably
not gonna make that,

684
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:25,300
sleeping in with
the West Coast time

685
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:26,633
and lines to learn.

686
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:29,033
- Right, except for
the rest of the cast

687
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,433
will be there to
promote the show.

688
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:32,000
- Okay.
- And the mayor is gonna be

689
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,934
there to promote that
you are now in said show.

690
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:36,367
- I'm gonna try to make it.

691
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,700
- Right, which is
code for, "Meh."

692
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:40,934
- I'll tell you what,
you tell the mayor

693
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,200
that I'm getting into character

694
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,667
and he's gonna understand that.

695
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,300
- Oh, well you do look
pretty annoyed right now.

696
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,100
So maybe he'll buy it.

697
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:49,500
Hey listen, Brandon
will be there.

698
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:51,033
You don't wanna
disappoint him, do you?

699
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:53,033
- Really? You're going to
bring my nephew into this?

700
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,033
- Mm, I just did.

701
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:56,667
- All right, Cassie Pruitt.

702
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,767
- See you tomorrow, Scrooge.

703
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,934
- Yeah. Wait a minute.

704
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:01,166
Are you calling me
Scrooge as my character,

705
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,800
or as a general sort
of personality trait?

706
00:27:03,934 --> 00:27:05,300
- Mm, yes. Night.

707
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,233
- Bah, humbug.

708
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:29,667
- Good morning,
and happy holidays

709
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,166
from the town of Dickens, Ohio.

710
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,233
As mayor, I'd like to
officially welcome everyone

711
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:43,300
to the 100th anniversary
of Dickens Days.

712
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,433
As you know, every year,

713
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:49,066
in the week leading
up to Christmas,

714
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,166
our town is transformed
into Victorian London

715
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,767
and we are transported back

716
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,266
to the time of our namesake,

717
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,867
the great writer and
chronicler of his age,

718
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,300
Charles Dickens.

719
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,533
And for our Centennial
celebration,

720
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:11,400
we've pulled out all the stops.

721
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:15,033
Today, we'll have a visit
from Father Christmas.

722
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:18,100
And tomorrow is the
gingerbread house contest.

723
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,533
Then, candlelight
caroling on Main Street,

724
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,433
Dickens Day of Giving,

725
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:27,734
and finally, our
Christmas Eve production

726
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:29,600
of "A Christmas Carol."

727
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:35,467
This year, it's a
special privilege

728
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,100
to welcome home Dickens'
most famous actor

729
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:42,333
to play the starring
role of Ebenezer Scrooge,

730
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:44,533
our very own Jake Dorsey.

731
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:11,000
- Jake! Uh, you missed your
wardrobe fitting this morning.

732
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:13,367
And the mayor was on stage
hoping to introduce you.

733
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,633
- Right, but for what?

734
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:15,900
He was going to have
me come up on stage

735
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:17,433
and scream, "Bah,
humbug" at people.

736
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:18,667
I'm not gonna do that.

737
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,700
- Well, didn't have a
problem screaming it

738
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:21,100
last night at the theater,

739
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:22,900
twice.

740
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:24,367
- Because I was making
a grand entrance.

741
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,934
It was, it was very different.

742
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:29,100
- Are you getting cold feet?

743
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:30,567
Do you not wanna do this?

744
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,266
- I wanna do it, but I
signed up to do the play.

745
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,367
I didn't come here to
do all this other stuff.

746
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,967
- Okay, well, all
this other stuff,

747
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,133
it's part of promoting the play.

748
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:39,166
- Speaking of
promoting the play,

749
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,900
is that Ray Muller over there?

750
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:42,100
- What?

751
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:45,000
Ray! He'd love to see you.

752
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:46,600
Come over, come.

753
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:49,467
Ah, hi!

754
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,567
Oh, this is so you, Ray.

755
00:29:52,734 --> 00:29:53,834
You can't even
talk and you still

756
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:56,200
find a way to help
out, thank you.

757
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:57,533
- Mr. Muller, I don't know

758
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,100
if you remember me or not.

759
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:01,533
I'm Jake Dorsey from your
high school theater class,

760
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,300
20 years ago almost.

761
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:06,033
- Yeah, that's right.

762
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:07,133
"Throttle Run."

763
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:08,734
I'm sorry for the circumstances

764
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:10,100
that have brought me here.

765
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:11,867
It's awful to hear about,

766
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,133
but I hope I do you proud.

767
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:14,467
Sir, they're big shoes to fill.

768
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,300
- Hi, Mr. Mayor.

769
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:17,767
W- hold on. Hold on, wait.

770
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,333
What? What do you
mean he's not coming?

771
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:22,333
Okay, calm down.

772
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:24,433
I'll be right there. Okay, bye.

773
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:25,967
- What's wrong?

774
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,200
- Father Christmas can't make it

775
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:30,100
and there's a line
of kids already.

776
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:31,633
What?

777
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:34,600
- Ho-ho-ho-ho, Merry
Christmas, Dawntae.

778
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:36,200
That's for you, my dear.

779
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:38,667
Merry Christmas. Pretty hair.

780
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,467
All right. Well, Oh!

781
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,166
Well, hello there, young man.

782
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,100
How are you? Merry Christmas.

783
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:45,266
- Hi.
- Hi.

784
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,700
- So I know I'm a
little too old for this-

785
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:48,100
- Oh, nonsense,
you're never too old

786
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:50,166
to talk to Father Christmas.

787
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,200
Question, would
you like, perhaps,

788
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,700
a pair of headphones
for your video games?

789
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:57,700
- Nah, I already have some.
- Oh.

790
00:30:57,834 --> 00:30:59,300
- So I don't know
if you know this,

791
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:00,900
but my Uncle Jake is home.

792
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:02,667
He's Jake Dorsey,
the famous actor.

793
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,066
- Oh, I know who he is Yes.

794
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,633
- Well, the only thing I want

795
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:09,400
is for my Uncle Jake
and my dad to get along.

796
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:12,266
Maybe my Uncle Jake
would come home more.

797
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,500
I really miss seeing him.

798
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,467
- Well, I, I bet that I can
make that happen, Brandon.

799
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,700
- How do you know my name?

800
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:24,567
- Because I'm,
I'm Father Christmas.

801
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,834
I know everything!

802
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:30,700
Here, lad, a little
extra candy for you,

803
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:32,100
my boy, Merry Christmas.

804
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:33,600
Don't tell anybody.

805
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:34,533
- Merry Christmas.

806
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,033
- Merry Christmas.

807
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,567
- Brandon!
- Oh!

808
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,367
- I'm just wondering
if I could give you

809
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,333
a really important job.

810
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:46,834
- Yeah, sure.

811
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:48,633
- Could I put you in charge
of helping your Uncle Jake

812
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:49,934
learn all of his lines?

813
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:51,200
- Yeah, I can do that.

814
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,734
- Maybe you two could
work together tomorrow

815
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:55,333
while you build gingerbread
houses at the inn?

816
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:56,533
- Awesome. I'll be there.

817
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:57,934
- Okay.

818
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,200
- Thank you.

819
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,967
- And I suppose you'll
want want a day off.

820
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,400
- If it's quite convenient, sir.

821
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:21,633
If I-

822
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:24,967
- If, if, if
I were to hold back

823
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,400
half a shilling wages.

824
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:28,266
- It's crown.

825
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,133
- Crown.
- Half a crown.

826
00:32:29,266 --> 00:32:30,867
- Crown, right.

827
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,133
- Pay up.

828
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:36,100
- You're just messing up
to see how many I'll eat.

829
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:38,033
- Maybe, just maybe.

830
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:41,133
- Uncle Jake! Say
the line, please.

831
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,333
Do the right thing,

832
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:48,433
or it's the last
thing you'll do.

833
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:51,967
- It must be awesome
being famous.

834
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,333
- Maybe not. It's okay,
it's got its perks.

835
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:56,600
But sometimes,

836
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,367
sometimes you just
wanna be a guy

837
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,166
who can shove
marshmallows in his face.

838
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,867
You know, without
everybody paying attention,

839
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,333
and not be bothered
by anybody, capisce?

840
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,066
- Hey, we gotta get going.

841
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,633
- Okay, let me just wash
my hands, they're sticky

842
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:12,367
from all the candy.
- Okay.

843
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,633
- He's a good kid.
- Yeah.

844
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:21,667
Look do me a favor,

845
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,867
just try to keep in mind

846
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,367
that it's going to crush
him when you leave.

847
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,633
And you're a big deal to him.

848
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:27,467
- Well, he's a big
deal to me, Craig.

849
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,066
- Come on, Jake.

850
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,900
You haven't seen
him in like years.

851
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:33,633
- Craig, can we
talk while I'm here?

852
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:34,900
Can we have a conversation?

853
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:36,834
- You mean more than
what we just did?

854
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:38,900
I'm good. Ready?

855
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:40,266
- See you tomorrow.

856
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,266
- Bye, buddy.

857
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:50,967
- Yeah, I
actually remember that.

858
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,967
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

859
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,934
- Hi. I'm Millie.

860
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:55,266
- Hi, Millie. I'm Jake.

861
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,633
I play Belle, your lost love.

862
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:59,233
I mean Scrooge's
lost love, whatever.

863
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:01,100
I'm Millie. Did I
say that already?

864
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:02,200
- Yeah, you did.

865
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,333
- I am so excited

866
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:06,734
for the Christmas Eve
ball flashback scene.

867
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:08,233
We get to dance together.

868
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:12,734
- Oh, Millie, honey, Jake
doesn't play Young Ebenezer.

869
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:14,233
Jake is old.
- Ah.

870
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,166
That's, thank you.

871
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,867
- Okay, she has no idea

872
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,233
that he is in love with her.

873
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:25,433
- Are you kidding?

874
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:27,834
Girls always know when
a guy's into them.

875
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:30,667
Okay, let's get
to work, shall we?

876
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,233
- Not always.

877
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:34,633
All right, so we'll just, what?

878
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:35,633
We're taking it from the top?

879
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:36,867
We'll do that-
- Yeah, yeah.

880
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,200
I will call action, okay.
- Okay.

881
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:39,533
- Action.

882
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,033
- Merry Christmas, Uncle.

883
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,300
- Bah, humbug.

884
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:45,100
- Christmas, a humbug?

885
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:47,166
Uncle, you don't
mean that, I'm sure.

886
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,433
- You're poor.

887
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:50,800
Nope. That's not right.

888
00:34:50,934 --> 00:34:51,700
- No.
- I skipped something.

889
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:52,633
- Yep.

890
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,266
- Merry Christmas?

891
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,667
What right do you, what?

892
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,266
Merry Chris-

893
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,300
Nope. That's not it.

894
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,100
Uh, Merry, uh.

895
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:07,700
Well, Merry Christmas.

896
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:08,934
I think I'm gonna have to
find a different voice,

897
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,133
'cause that one...

898
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:11,500
Can we just take
it back to the top?

899
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:12,767
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.

900
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,300
Just please remember
this is not a movie.

901
00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:15,800
There's no going
back on show night.

902
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:17,633
- I
know that, Cassie.

903
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:18,967
- I just gotta make sure.

904
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,367
- Um, you know what,
don't worry about it.

905
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Bah, Humbug.

906
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:27,033
- What right have
you to be dismal?

907
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:30,433
You're rich enough.
Don't be cross.

908
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:32,600
- Do you, do you
need back again?

909
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:33,867
- No.

910
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,400
- Oh, guys, please do
not record rehearsals.

911
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:37,367
Actors need to feel safe

912
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
to find their characters, okay?

913
00:35:39,633 --> 00:35:41,000
Thank you.

914
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:42,300
Okay.
- Thank you.

915
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:45,266
- All right, let's pick
it up from Fred's line.

916
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,900
- What right have
you to be dismal?

917
00:35:47,033 --> 00:35:49,433
You're rich enough.
Don't be cross.

918
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:51,367
- What else can I be

919
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,834
when I live in such a world

920
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:55,367
of fools as this?

921
00:36:02,433 --> 00:36:03,200
What?

922
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,667
- Nothing, it's just,

923
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,000
it's a lot different
from how Ray did it.

924
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:09,367
- Ray's not here, bro. I am.

925
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,533
- Can, can I make a suggestion?

926
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,100
- Most directors give the
actors a couple of times

927
00:36:14,233 --> 00:36:15,300
to run through it
before they jump in

928
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:17,600
with the performance notes.

929
00:36:17,734 --> 00:36:18,533
- Cool, okay.

930
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:21,333
Uh, let's just keep going.

931
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:30,600
- Hey.
- Hey.

932
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:34,200
- You okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.

933
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,533
- Listen, it's
just the first day.

934
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:39,367
It'll all come together once
you get your lines down.

935
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,934
- It's not
my lines, Cassie.

936
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,633
I'm good at
remembering my lines.

937
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:46,767
I just, I have to
be in character

938
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,200
in order to trigger them,

939
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,600
and I don't know who
Scrooge is on the inside.

940
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:55,033
So I just, I don't,
I don't know.

941
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:56,500
- Okay. So listen,

942
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:58,266
I know you have a lot
more experience than I do,

943
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,133
but can I make a suggestion?

944
00:37:00,266 --> 00:37:02,967
- Uh, yeah. Please, yes.

945
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,734
- Okay so when I sat

946
00:37:06,533 --> 00:37:08,967
and I had problems
getting into character,

947
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,600
I would think about her
from the outside in.

948
00:37:12,734 --> 00:37:13,834
- What do you mean?

949
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:17,266
- Okay, so I would
think about her walk

950
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,300
and her hair and
her posture, yeah.

951
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:26,600
Remember, Scrooge is
an old man, right?

952
00:37:26,734 --> 00:37:30,633
He's cold and he's stiff
because he's too cheap

953
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:34,633
to have a fire burning.

954
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:37,667
He has a constant
scowl on his face

955
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,433
because he doesn't even
love his own family,

956
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:45,467
or doesn't realize

957
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,266
that he actually
does love them, yeah.

958
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,100
Does that makes sense?

959
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:04,500
- Yeah, that's, that's
really helpful, actually.

960
00:38:04,633 --> 00:38:06,300
- Good.

961
00:38:06,433 --> 00:38:09,934
- I'm sorry about
being uncool in there.

962
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:13,800
- Yeah, it was a little
uncool, but all good.

963
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:22,467
So some of us are gonna go

964
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,467
to the Three Ghost Pub
after the candlelight walk.

965
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,367
You wanna join?

966
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,900
- I would love that.

967
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:31,600
- Okay. Meet you
at the inn at 8:00?

968
00:38:31,734 --> 00:38:32,734
- Great.
- Great.

969
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:34,700
- Yeah.
- Okay.

970
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:36,200
- Thank you, Cassie.

971
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,400
- No problem.

972
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:51,000
- Hey, boss.

973
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:52,066
- Hey, where you been?

974
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,000
What is that?

975
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:53,934
- I went to Cleveland to get

976
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:55,166
some more of your moisturizer.

977
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:55,967
- Nah, you didn't
have to do that.

978
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,700
The hotel stuff is fine.

979
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:01,166
- I don't even know
who you are anymore.

980
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,000
- You know what, in fact,

981
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:03,266
I want you to keep this.

982
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,867
Merry Christmas, it's a
little present for you.

983
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,100
- Thanks. You going somewhere?

984
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:07,834
- Yeah, I am gonna do
the candlelight walk

985
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:09,533
down Main Street, and then,

986
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:12,166
I'm gonna hang out with
the cast afterwards.

987
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,667
What?

988
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,100
- I don't know. It's just,
you seem happier than usual.

989
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:16,700
- Well, I don't know,

990
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:19,400
it's kind of nice
being back home.

991
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:20,433
- You want some tasty news?

992
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:21,600
- Yes. What?

993
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,200
- My celebrity
assistant text group

994
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,333
has some chatter about
the "Dunes of Eastlynn."

995
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:29,400
And, FYI, they still haven't
cast their Travis yet.

996
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,000
- Huh. Does Denise know this?

997
00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:32,500
- I already took care of it.

998
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:34,834
- Ben, my man, I'm starting
to lose count on my IOUs.

999
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:36,100
- Eh, don't worry. I'm not.

1000

One question though,

were you lip syncing?

Everyone is so excited you
came home to do the play.

but you must be very
proud of your daughter.

1023

00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:28,266
- No, I don't know how to dance.

1055
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,667
- Well, look, I am
going to show you,

1056
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,700
okay?
- Okay.

1057
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:33,600
- Yes. One hand here.
- Okay.

1058
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:35,100
- This hand goes here.
- Okay.

1059
00:41:35,233 --> 00:41:36,533
- And then we sway.

1060
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:38,166
- We just sway?
- Yeah.

1061
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,266
See, it's not that hard.

1062
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:43,233
Um, what was that conversation

1063
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:44,433
that you were having
with your mother?

1064
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:46,200
What was that about?

1065
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:48,633
I don't think you wanna know.

1066
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:50,033
- No, I do wanna know.

1067
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:52,734
Absolutely. You can talk to me.

1068
00:41:54,967 --> 00:41:57,066
- So it's been a long time

1069
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,367
since I've worked as a director.

1070
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,500
And it's just because
I put my career on hold

1071
00:42:04,633 --> 00:42:07,400
to help my
ex-husband's business.

1072
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:10,000
And now that we're divorced,

1073
00:42:10,133 --> 00:42:11,700
I'm just trying to figure out

1074
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,734
what my next steps are.

1075
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,166
But I need to prove to myself

1076
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:20,667
that I can still do this, right?

1077
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,600
Before I just give up.

1078
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:25,734
That's why I want this play

1079
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:27,834
to be really successful.

1080
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,867
- I guess that means I gotta be

1081
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,800
the best Ebenezer Scrooge
this town has ever seen,

1082
00:42:35,934 --> 00:42:38,567
even though some people
say that I can't.

1083
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,834
- I think you can.

1084
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:42,166
- Ah, you were skeptical.

1085
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,500
You were skeptical

1086
00:42:43,633 --> 00:42:44,834
on the first conversation
on the phone.

1087
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:48,200
- I, um, that's
because I was jealous.

1088
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,200
- Jealous? Of what?

1089
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,734
- It's embarrassing.

1090
00:42:52,867 --> 00:42:54,567
I was the one that
was voted most likely

1091
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,734
to become a household name.

1092
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,967
Don't laugh!
- That is embarrassing.

1093
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:01,266
- Do you wanna know something

1094
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,367
that's even crazier?
- What?

1095
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,033
- I was voted the guy

1096
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,700
who was least likely
to leave Dickens.

1097
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:10,567
- Well, I guess the
voters were wrong, right?

1098
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,166
- They were wrong.

1099
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,633
You know, I don't
blame you for doubting

1100
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:23,934
whether or not I
could play this role,

1101
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:25,200
because even after
all this time,

1102
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:28,800
I'm not sure that I
have what it takes to,

1103
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,033
to do something more serious.

1104
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:35,800
- I know you have what it takes.

1105
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:38,900
I'm gonna help you see it.

1106
00:43:50,633 --> 00:43:52,100
- Oh, okay, can...

1107
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,633
It's close, but can
I make a suggestion?

1108
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:58,166
- Uh, yeah. Yep, of course,
you are the director.

1109
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,700
What do you got?
- So I think

1110
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:02,967
the key here is Scrooge's shock

1111
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,433
at feeling afraid for
someone else's future

1112
00:44:05,567 --> 00:44:08,033
rather than just his own.

1113
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:09,233
- Huh, okay.

1114
00:44:09,367 --> 00:44:11,233
- I want you to
think about Brandon.

1115
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:13,967
He is your actual nephew.

1116
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,500
This is all here for
you. Get into it.

1117
00:44:16,633 --> 00:44:19,033
- Okay. All right, all right.
- Yeah, be great.

1118
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:22,633
- Um, okay.

1119
00:44:23,934 --> 00:44:26,367
- Merry Christmas
to us all, my dears.

1120
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,633
- God bless us, every one.

1121
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,333
- Spirit, tell me that
Tiny Tim will live.

1122
00:44:34,467 --> 00:44:37,767
Oh, kind Spirit, say
he will be spared.

1123
00:44:39,767 --> 00:44:42,400
- If he be like to die,
he had better do it

1124
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:46,000
and decrease the
surplus population.

1125
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:50,567
- Yes!
- Yeah?

1126
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,533
- Yes!
Yeah, yeah?

1127
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:52,767
- Thank you.

1128
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,166
- Okay.
- So much better.

1129
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,433
- Possibly.
- Right? You're good.

1130
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,934
- Okay, just a
reminder for everyone

1131
00:44:57,066 --> 00:44:59,600
who is delivering pies for
Dickens Days of Giving,

1132
00:44:59,734 --> 00:45:02,734
we are meeting at the
Country Grill at noon.

1133
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,567
I'll see you there.

1134
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,433
- Hey, I would like to
join you. Is that okay?

1135
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,900
- I'd like that.

1136
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:14,300
- Good.
- Okay.

1137
00:45:14,433 --> 00:45:16,800
- Nice work today. Thank you.

1138
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:25,166
- I put the figgy
puddings in the back,

1139
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,800
the mince meat and the
rum cakes on the counter.

1140
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:29,367
- Hey, hey.

1141
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,734
Ah, it smells good in here.

1142
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:33,266
- Yeah, that'd be the pies.

1143
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,133
- Yeah. This place
looks amazing.

1144
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:38,467
- Hey.
- Same old vibe.

1145
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,533
- Yeah, that's 'cause
it's the same old place.

1146
00:45:41,667 --> 00:45:44,000
- Hey, wait a minute.

1147
00:45:44,133 --> 00:45:45,633
What happened to the
second dining room?

1148
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:46,867
Why is it walled off?

1149
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,400
- A few years ago, I
had to sell the space

1150
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:49,667
to the shop next door.

1151
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,900
- Well, why didn't you tell me?

1152
00:45:51,033 --> 00:45:52,300
- Well, I didn't think
you wanted to know.

1153
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:54,500
- Of course I wanna know.

1154
00:45:54,633 --> 00:45:56,967
Hey, if you needed money, Craig-

1155
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,533
- No, I didn't need
money. I needed the help.

1156
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:01,767
- Cool, I mean, can I help

1157
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,433
with the cost of some
of these pies at least?

1158
00:46:03,567 --> 00:46:05,700
- Jake, we make the
pies every year.

1159
00:46:05,834 --> 00:46:06,700
I'm happy to do it.

1160
00:46:06,834 --> 00:46:08,533
- Hey, I wanna help.

1161
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:10,767
- Yeah, well, Mom passed
away about five years ago

1162
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,100
and we haven't
heard from you much,

1163
00:46:12,233 --> 00:46:13,967
so that's news to me.

1164
00:46:15,266 --> 00:46:16,233
- Just because I didn't stay

1165
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:17,400
and help you run this restaurant

1166
00:46:17,533 --> 00:46:18,567
doesn't mean I don't care.

1167
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,900
- I didn't ask you to stay,

1168
00:46:20,033 --> 00:46:21,066
and I didn't expect you to.

1169
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,900
- You know, what
is your problem?

1170
00:46:25,233 --> 00:46:28,467
- My problem is, Jake,
is that you say you care

1171
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,667
about Brandon and
the rest of us,

1172
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,000
but we hear from you
once a year at Christmas

1173
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:35,166
when a bunch of presents show up

1174
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,467
that nobody really wants.

1175
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,800
- Hey, I'm trying
to be generous.

1176
00:46:38,934 --> 00:46:42,066
I don't, I don't
know what else to do.

1177
00:46:44,233 --> 00:46:46,400
- It's not complicate, Jake.

1178
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:48,266
Just check in once
in awhile, okay?

1179
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,867
Come home for a birthday,

1180
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,633
be part of your family,
not some celebrity

1181
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:55,567
who occasionally
remembers he has one.

1182
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,400
- Thanks
for the pie, honey.

1183
00:47:00,533 --> 00:47:01,467
- Thank you.

1184
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,900
- Bye.

1185
00:47:03,033 --> 00:47:05,367
- Brr, all right, how
about when we're done

1186
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,633
delivering the pies,

1187
00:47:06,767 --> 00:47:08,400
we go get some dinner?

1188
00:47:08,533 --> 00:47:10,066
- Hmm. Yeah, I'd like that.

1189
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,066
- Yeah?

1190
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,800
Maybe, uh, maybe Craig's?

1191
00:47:13,934 --> 00:47:15,233
- I don't know about that.

1192
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:19,166
I saw him earlier, and
things were a little tense.

1193
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,867
- Well, you're gonna be
with me this time, yeah?

1194
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,300
And Craig and I are buds.

1195
00:47:23,433 --> 00:47:25,867
- Ha ha, what, so you're
gonna vouch for my character?

1196
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,367
- I don't know.

1197
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,400
I think I gotta get to know
you a little better first.

1198
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:31,066
- I look forward to that.

1199
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,800
- Holy cow.

1200
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:41,600
Wow.

1201
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,400
You look amazing.

1202
00:47:43,533 --> 00:47:47,500
- Thank you.

1203
00:47:47,633 --> 00:47:49,934
Oh, full service. I like it.

1204
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,500
Thank you.

1205
00:47:56,467 --> 00:47:57,266
- Hi.
- Hi.

1206
00:47:58,367 --> 00:47:59,300
Have you seen Craig yet?

1207
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:00,600
- I have not, no.

1208
00:48:00,734 --> 00:48:03,033
So I don't think
that sibling rivalry

1209
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:05,467
will be on the menu tonight.

1210
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,367
- There he is. Craig, hi!

1211
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,734
- Oh, hi.

1212
00:48:09,867 --> 00:48:12,367
- There he is.
- Do you need some menus?

1213
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,600
There you go.

1214
00:48:13,734 --> 00:48:16,834
The specials are on the back.

1215
00:48:16,967 --> 00:48:19,934
- So what were your
favorites growing up?

1216
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:23,367
- Uh, well, chicken pot pie.
- The chicken pot pie.

1217
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,867
- And do you still serve it?

1218
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,400
- Every night.

1219
00:48:26,533 --> 00:48:28,066
- Do you remember when we
would just eat the crust,

1220
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,000
how mad Mom would get?

1221
00:48:31,433 --> 00:48:33,266
- You know, I made a couple
of tweaks to that crust.

1222
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,934
And I think it's even better,

1223
00:48:35,066 --> 00:48:36,867
but you should try it.

1224
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:41,133
- I would, I would love that.

1225
00:48:41,266 --> 00:48:42,600
- Yeah, sounds good.

1226
00:48:42,734 --> 00:48:44,200
- I'll be right back.

1227
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:46,567
- Okay, what just happened?

1228
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,133
- I just helped my actress
change the motivation.

1229
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:53,900
- First you get people
to stop filming me

1230
00:48:54,033 --> 00:48:55,133
and then you give me that advice

1231
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,266
about getting into
Scrooge's body,

1232
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,533
and now this.

1233
00:48:58,667 --> 00:49:00,100
- I'm just, you know.

1234
00:49:00,233 --> 00:49:03,800
- You're just doing your
job extremely well, Cassie.

1235
00:49:03,934 --> 00:49:05,166
Don't ever let anybody tell you

1236
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,567
that you can't be a director,

1237
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,400
because you are an
amazing director, Cassie.

1238
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:10,633
You were meant to do this.

1239
00:49:11,967 --> 00:49:12,934
- Thank you.

1240
00:49:14,133 --> 00:49:17,834
It's, uh, it's really
nice of you to say.

1241
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:19,934
- I'm just being honest.

1242
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:30,567
- Well?

1243
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,200
- Mm, Craig, my gosh,
this was fantastic.

1244
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:35,934
This was like all
of our childhood

1245
00:49:36,066 --> 00:49:37,200
just wrapped up on a plate.

1246
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:40,066
- And that's
why I love what I do.

1247
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,500
- Mom would be really proud.

1248
00:49:43,934 --> 00:49:44,934
She knew that she was
leaving the family legacy

1249
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:46,400
in the right hands.

1250
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,867
- Well, thanks for coming in.

1251
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,900
Jake, that means a lot.

1252
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,400
- Well, look at that.

1253
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,100
Well, I would offer
to walk you home, but-

1254
00:50:10,233 --> 00:50:12,600
- You've got to be kidding me.

1255
00:50:12,734 --> 00:50:13,867
Did you plan this?

1256
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,200
- I had nothing to do
with this, I promise.

1257
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:20,400
But, I mean, we can't let a
perfectly good carriage ride

1258
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:23,000
go to waste, can we?

1259
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:23,834
Jump in.

1260
00:50:26,133 --> 00:50:28,166
Can we jump in?

1261
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,667
We're jumping in.

1262
00:50:33,433 --> 00:50:34,400
- All right.

1263
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,900
- It really does feel like
Victorian London, doesn't it?

1264
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:40,834
- Yeah.

1265
00:50:43,867 --> 00:50:47,367
- Okay, smile.

1266
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,433
- Ah. You know, I bet Scrooge
would have hated selfies.

1267
00:50:50,567 --> 00:50:52,467
- Oh, I'm sorry. We
don't have to take one.

1268
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,500
- No. Tonight, I am
not Ebenezer Scrooge.

1269
00:50:55,633 --> 00:50:56,934
I'm Jake Dorsey.

1270
00:50:57,066 --> 00:50:58,200
- What, who?

1271
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:01,133
Ha ha, ha ha, yeah.
- Ha ha, zing.

1272
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,633
- And I have, I don't know,

1273
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:04,533
it's been a long time
since I've wanted

1274
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:06,000
to take a selfie with somebody.

1275
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:07,200
So, ready?
- Okay, yeah.

1276
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:09,133
- One, two, three.
- Look cute.

1277
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,633
- Got it. All right.

1278
00:51:15,767 --> 00:51:17,000
- Aw!

1279
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:18,233
- There.

1280
00:51:21,066 --> 00:51:21,967
Are you cold?

1281
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:22,967
- I am, actually.

1282
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,300
- Here, let me get a blanket.

1283
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:26,400
Oh, my gosh.

1284
00:51:27,467 --> 00:51:28,800
- What?

1285
00:51:28,934 --> 00:51:30,467
- This is so weird.

1286
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,467
Wow, it's so wild.

1287
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,100
It's like, of all the books

1288
00:51:37,233 --> 00:51:39,900
this guy could be
reading right now.

1289
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:42,133
This is the book that they're
turning into the movie.

1290
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,600
This is the role that
I wanted so badly.

1291
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:47,400
This was my mother's
favorite book.

1292
00:51:47,533 --> 00:51:49,500
That's, that's why I
wanted to do it, you know?

1293
00:51:49,633 --> 00:51:51,834
'Cause I just, I just
wanted to make her proud.

1294
00:51:51,967 --> 00:51:53,266
- Why didn't you tell me that?

1295
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,500
- I don't know, I mean,
I have to pace myself

1296
00:51:55,633 --> 00:51:59,667
about how much I
overshare today.

1297
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,934
- I had a great time today.

1298
00:52:01,066 --> 00:52:02,533
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1299
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:03,433
- Me too.

1300
00:52:05,367 --> 00:52:07,934
It kind of makes me wish I'd
asked you out in high school.

1301
00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:09,333
- You did.

1302
00:52:09,467 --> 00:52:12,667
Yeah, you asked me to
the prom, remember?

1303
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,934
- You remember, you
remember the one thing

1304
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,000
that I wish you would have
forgotten from high school.

1305
00:52:18,133 --> 00:52:22,000
It's amazing.

1306
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:23,900
- I regret something
too, though.

1307
00:52:24,033 --> 00:52:24,834
- What?

1308
00:52:26,066 --> 00:52:27,800
- I should've said yes.

1309
00:52:27,934 --> 00:52:30,300
- Yeah, it's 'cause
I'm famous now.

1310
00:52:30,433 --> 00:52:32,800
- No, because I know you now.

1311
00:52:53,633 --> 00:52:54,533
- Good morning, Ben.

1312
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:55,900
- Good morning, boss.

1313
00:52:56,033 --> 00:52:56,667
You enjoy you're
carriage ride last night?

1314
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,800
- Ooh, I did.

1315
00:52:57,934 --> 00:52:58,734
In fact, you wouldn't
happen to know

1316
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:00,467
who arranged that, would you?

1317
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,567
- Santa's little helper.

1318
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,900
So don't forget,

1319
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:04,133
before rehearsal,
we've got the crew

1320
00:53:04,266 --> 00:53:05,600
from Cleveland today
coming to interview you

1321
00:53:05,734 --> 00:53:06,867
at the ice rink.

1322
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,900
- Hmm. Okay, but
why the ice rink?

1323
00:53:10,033 --> 00:53:12,066
- Because it's
fun. And Christmas.

1324
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,200
You played hockey.
- I don't, I don't want

1325
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:15,500
this play to be about me, Ben.

1326
00:53:15,633 --> 00:53:17,934
- Isn't that
why you came here?

1327
00:53:18,066 --> 00:53:19,700
This is about you.

1328
00:53:19,834 --> 00:53:20,967
- Not anymore.

1329
00:53:26,633 --> 00:53:28,133
I mean, I kind of
feel like Uncle Jed

1330
00:53:28,266 --> 00:53:29,166
from "Beverly Hillbillies."

1331
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,467
- You look cute.

1332
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,400
- Cute. Cute on Scrooge.

1333
00:53:33,533 --> 00:53:35,233
Isn't that an oxymoron?

1334
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:38,433
- It's a different
direction, I'll say that.

1335
00:53:38,567 --> 00:53:40,467
But, on show night
when your makeup is on

1336
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,967
and you're onstage,

1337
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,867
no one will think you're cute

1338
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,300
or even remotely
attractive whatsoever.

1339
00:53:46,433 --> 00:53:48,033
- Okay, now you're just
hurting my feelings.

1340
00:53:48,166 --> 00:53:50,367
Uh, "Cleveland Today" is
coming to interview me

1341
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,800
at the ice skating rink.

1342
00:53:51,934 --> 00:53:52,967
- Are you serious?

1343
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,200
- Yeah, do you
wanna come with me?

1344
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,700
- No, do you have any
idea how hard we worked

1345
00:53:55,834 --> 00:53:57,567
to get them to come here
and do a piece on the play?

1346
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,767
But they just kept saying,
"You're too far away."

1347
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,066
Hmm, I guess that's what
they mean by star power.

1348
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,133
- Wanna know what they
mean by star power?

1349
00:54:05,266 --> 00:54:06,867
- Yeah.
- Boom, right here.

1350
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,066
This is what they
mean by star power.

1351
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,433
Feel it. Feel it!
- You are such a dork.

1352
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:11,100
- Uncle Jake!
- Whoa!

1353
00:54:11,233 --> 00:54:12,467
Hey buddy. What's up?

1354
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,967
My parents wanna know
if you and Cassie

1355
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,433
can come to dinner
tomorrow night.

1356
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:17,400
- Can we?

1357
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:18,567
- We can.
- Yes!

1358
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,767
- There you go. It's a date.

1359
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,300
All right, you two
work out the details.

1360
00:54:21,433 --> 00:54:23,200
I am gonna go change.

1361
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:24,467
- Your uncle is nuts.

1362
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,734
- I know.

1363
00:54:25,867 --> 00:54:27,166
- Welcome back to
"Cleveland Today."

1364
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,300
And as promised, we
are live in Dickens

1365
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:32,166
with hometown
megastar, Jake Dorsey.

1366
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,600
Jake, welcome back to Dickens.

1367
00:54:33,734 --> 00:54:35,266
- Well, I'm happy
to be here, yeah.

1368
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,834
- Now, I have it
on good authority

1369
00:54:36,967 --> 00:54:39,200
that you didn't come home
just to do some skating.

1370
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:40,700
You're here to do
community theater,

1371
00:54:40,834 --> 00:54:42,100
is that right?
- That's right, yeah.

1372
00:54:42,233 --> 00:54:44,333
I am going to play
Ebenezer Scrooge

1373
00:54:44,467 --> 00:54:46,033
in a Dickens production
of "A Christmas Carol."

1374
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:47,834
- What made you
decide to do that?

1375
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:50,233
- Well, I'm from Dickens, Ohio.

1376
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,266
Dickens Days is
close to my heart.

1377
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,734
And of course, Ray Muller,

1378
00:54:53,867 --> 00:54:55,734
who happens to be the
best actor out of Dickens

1379
00:54:55,867 --> 00:54:57,700
and was also my
coach in high school,

1380
00:54:57,834 --> 00:55:01,166
he got a little sick
so I stepped in.

1381
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,667
- Well, that's
very heroic of you.

1382
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,033
- Yeah.

1383
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:07,867
Also, it's given me a chance

1384
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,867
to work with a really
incredible director.

1385
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,767
- Oh, is it somebody you've
made movies with before?

1386
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,200
- No, actually,
somebody that I've known

1387
00:55:17,266 --> 00:55:18,367
for a very long time,

1388
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,934
somebody I have a
lot of respect for.

1389
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:22,667
In fact, do you mind
if we call her over?

1390
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,667
- Absolutely!

1391
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,433
- Cassie, come on over here.

1392
00:55:25,567 --> 00:55:26,834
This is Cassie
Pruitt, everybody.

1393
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:28,967
-
Isn't she great?

1394
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:29,900
- There she is.

1395
00:55:30,033 --> 00:55:31,166
Well, I was hoping we would get

1396
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,000
to see you on the
ice as well, Jake.

1397
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:34,066
Didn't you use to play hockey?

1398
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,967
- I did.
- Oh no, no, no, no.

1399
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,567
Sorry, I do not need to lose

1400
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,533
my lead actor to a broken arm.

1401
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:42,300
He is just fine in
this dirty chair.

1402
00:55:42,433 --> 00:55:44,700
- Can you imagine Ebenezer
Scrooge on crutches?

1403
00:55:44,834 --> 00:55:45,800
You'd be like, "Wait,
is it Tiny Tim?

1404
00:55:45,934 --> 00:55:47,066
Is it Scrooge? (grumbles)"

1405
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,000
- Okay, well, Cassie, tell me?

1406
00:55:48,133 --> 00:55:48,934
- Yeah?
What is it like

1407
00:55:49,066 --> 00:55:50,467
directing such a mega star?

1408
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,767
I can imagine it's
a little daunting.

1409
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,367
- Ah, no, no.

1410
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,934
Jake's a total pro.
We're lucky to have him.

1411
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:57,133
- And between you
and I, tell me,

1412
00:55:57,266 --> 00:55:59,100
what is your favorite
Jake Dorsey movie?

1413
00:55:59,233 --> 00:56:00,433
- Ooh, good question.

1414
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:01,567
I actually would like to know

1415
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,433
the answer to this too, Cassie.

1416
00:56:05,567 --> 00:56:07,367
- Okay, well it's, um,

1417
00:56:08,266 --> 00:56:09,066
it's the one where he is,

1418
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,333
he is like (imitates whooshing),

1419
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:11,600
like, right onto the car.

1420
00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:12,967
- They all have that in them.

1421
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,266
- Yeah, right?

1422
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,700
That's the joke.
- Yeah.

1423
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:18,467
- Just want to let you
viewers know that the festival

1424
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,233
runs all the way
through Christmas Eve.

1425
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:25,000
It's gonna be a step back
into Victorian London.

1426
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:26,867
- That's right. It's
gonna be a lot of fun.

1427
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,133
So come on down
to Dickens, Ohio,

1428
00:56:30,266 --> 00:56:31,900
and come see a play.

1429
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,133
- Well, I think
you just convinced

1430
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,967
a few thousand people
to do just that,

1431
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,433
Jake Dorsey.
- I hope so.

1432
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:39,133
I'm Carrie Lee Gaffney
for "Cleveland Today."

1433
00:56:39,266 --> 00:56:40,066
Now I'm going to
throw it on back

1434
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,633
to you in the studio.

1435
00:56:42,767 --> 00:56:44,533
- I can't believe
that you haven't seen

1436
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,100
any of my movies.

1437
00:56:46,233 --> 00:56:49,600
We're doing a marathon.

1438
00:56:49,734 --> 00:56:50,867
- Hey, is it cool with you

1439
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,333
if I take the rest
of the night off?

1440
00:56:52,467 --> 00:56:53,600
- Ben.

1441
00:56:53,734 --> 00:56:54,867
- I wanna visit a couple
of friends in Cleveland.

1442
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,834
- Oh, Ben, why don't you
take the holidays off?

1443
00:56:58,967 --> 00:57:00,600
I'll see you next year.

1444
00:57:00,734 --> 00:57:03,533
- Hey, I wanna see
you nail this part.

1445
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:04,734
I'm not going anywhere.

1446
00:57:04,867 --> 00:57:07,533
I'll see you later.

1447
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:08,767
- It must be nice knowing

1448
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:09,967
someone's got your
back like that.

1449
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,100
- Yeah. I mean,
well, I pay him, so.

1450
00:57:11,233 --> 00:57:12,700
So there's that.
- Well, right.

1451
00:57:12,834 --> 00:57:15,600
No, but I think
he actually cares, though.

1452
00:57:15,734 --> 00:57:17,300
- He does. He does.

1453
00:57:19,066 --> 00:57:22,033
Actually, more than
my agent, sadly.

1454
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,200
- Well, thanks.

1455
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:29,133
Thanks again for including
me in the interview.

1456
00:57:29,266 --> 00:57:30,300
- Of course, Cassie.

1457
00:57:30,433 --> 00:57:32,433
Hey, what are you doing

1458
00:57:32,567 --> 00:57:35,000
for the rest of the afternoon?

1459
00:57:35,133 --> 00:57:37,767
- I was
actually debating

1460
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,000
getting a Christmas tree,

1461
00:57:39,133 --> 00:57:40,600
but I'm not sure
if I'm up for it.

1462
00:57:40,734 --> 00:57:42,100
- Wait, wait a minute.

1463
00:57:42,233 --> 00:57:44,767
Hold on, you don't have
a Christmas tree yet?

1464
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,967
I mean, you know
that's like a felony

1465
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,300
in this town, right?

1466
00:57:47,433 --> 00:57:49,467
- I know. Yeah, it kind of is.

1467
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,400
But you know, I just,
I've been so busy and...

1468
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,266
Okay, the truth is
Christmas kind of reminds me

1469
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,533
of my ex-husband,

1470
00:58:01,667 --> 00:58:04,033
and I just didn't
wanna do it alone.

1471
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:05,700
- Well, guess what?

1472
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,066
You're not alone.

1473
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:21,367
When I was a kid,
my favorite thing

1474
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,500
was decorating a
huge Christmas tree.

1475
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,867
- Yeah?
And when I worked here,

1476
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,133
I had this knack for
finding the perfect tree

1477
00:58:28,266 --> 00:58:29,333
for every customer.

1478
00:58:29,467 --> 00:58:31,066
- Hmm, what's the secret?

1479
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,100
- The secret was
finding the tree

1480
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:34,834
that's right for you.

1481
00:58:34,967 --> 00:58:36,967
- Oh, so I should look for one

1482
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,266
going through a rough patch?

1483
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,266
- Well,
it's funny, you know,

1484
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,800
if a tree has gone
through a rough patch,

1485
00:58:42,934 --> 00:58:46,400
it makes it the strongest
tree on the lot.

1486
00:58:47,533 --> 00:58:50,333
- I like the way you think.

1487
00:58:50,467 --> 00:58:51,600
I think this is it.

1488
00:58:51,734 --> 00:58:53,100
- Yeah? That's the one?
- Yeah.

1489
00:58:53,233 --> 00:58:54,934
- Jake?
- Matt!

1490
00:58:55,066 --> 00:58:57,266
Ah, what's up brother?

1491
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,033
Oh, look at this guy.

1492
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:00,266
Oh, look at you.

1493
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,467
- You wanna work here again?

1494
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,533
- It's
tempting, actually.

1495
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:04,767
- You're great at
drawing in crowds.

1496
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,433
- Ah, it's probably
just the popcorn.

1497
00:59:06,567 --> 00:59:07,800
- It could be.

1498
00:59:07,934 --> 00:59:08,867
- It's good to see you, man.

1499
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,667
- Have fun, guys.
- Bye.

1500
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,033
- That's amazing.

1501
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,066
Well, this is, this
is a lot better

1502
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,967
than what I would
be doing in LA.

1503
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,133
- Yeah? What would you be doing?

1504
00:59:24,266 --> 00:59:26,133
- Um, well, I'd probably
be watching old movies

1505
00:59:26,266 --> 00:59:30,533
in my pajamas, and then be
sulking about being alone.

1506
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:34,367
And then I would be
spying on my brother,

1507
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,567
Craig, and his family
via social media.

1508
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,500
- Is there a reason you wouldn't

1509
00:59:37,633 --> 00:59:40,500
just come home for the holidays?

1510
00:59:40,633 --> 00:59:43,834
- Ever since
my mother passed away,

1511
00:59:43,967 --> 00:59:47,367
I have found it very
hard to come back here,

1512
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,467
especially at Christmastime,

1513
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,667
which I guess makes Craig
feel like I don't care.

1514
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,633
He doesn't understand it,

1515
00:59:53,767 --> 00:59:55,166
which makes my feelings get hurt

1516
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,400
and I don't understand him.

1517
00:59:56,533 --> 00:59:57,633
And then, we sort
of just drift apart,

1518
00:59:57,767 --> 01:00:00,633
which I guess is how
that happens, so.

1519
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:06,333
- Your home now, right?
- Yeah.

1520
01:00:06,467 --> 01:00:09,233
- So maybe it's
time for new start?

1521
01:00:09,367 --> 01:00:11,367
- Yeah. And it's
going pretty good.

1522
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,100
- Good.
- All right.

1523
01:00:13,233 --> 01:00:16,333
Should we do the magic three?

1524
01:00:16,467 --> 01:00:18,100
- Yes.
- Remember that?

1525
01:00:18,233 --> 01:00:19,033
- I do.
- Okay.

1526
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:20,567
- Okay. Here we go.

1527
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,133
- One, two, three.

1528
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:26,567
- Oh!

1529
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:27,700
- It never gets old.

1530
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:29,900
- It works though.

1531
01:00:30,033 --> 01:00:34,033
It's beautiful.

1532
01:00:34,166 --> 01:00:35,200
You know the only
thing that's missing

1533
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:37,734
is a bunch of presents
under the tree.

1534
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,033
- No, I'm good.

1535
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:42,667
I'm, I'm very content
with what I have.

1536
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,333
- Okay, I have a
confession to make.

1537
01:00:44,467 --> 01:00:45,166
- You're married?

1538
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,567
- No.
- Okay.

1539
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,867
- When we were in high school,

1540
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,333
I made a present for you,

1541
01:00:51,467 --> 01:00:53,033
and I didn't have a
courage to give it to you.

1542
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:54,266
- Why?

1543
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,300
- Well, because I
asked you to the prom

1544
01:00:55,433 --> 01:00:56,333
and that took me two weeks

1545
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:57,300
to muster up the
courage for that

1546
01:00:57,433 --> 01:00:58,900
and then you turned me down.

1547
01:00:59,033 --> 01:01:00,900
So, you know, I could
only imagine how,

1548
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:02,166
how the gift was just gonna

1549
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:03,500
Right?

1550
01:01:03,633 --> 01:01:04,767
- Okay. So what was it?

1551
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:05,800
Do you remember?
- Yeah, of course

1552
01:01:05,934 --> 01:01:06,967
I remember what it was.

1553
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,734
- And?
- No, I'm not gonna tell you.

1554
01:01:08,867 --> 01:01:14,467
- Jake!

1555
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,467
not the man I was.m not, m

1556
01:01:19,033 --> 01:01:20,300
I am not the man I.

1557
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:24,533
I am not the man I was.

1558
01:01:25,867 --> 01:01:26,667
- Okay.

1559
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:35,133
So this whole,
this whole story

1560
01:01:35,266 --> 01:01:37,500
is about changing your life

1561
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,133
before it's too late.

1562
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:45,467
Now, I know you've had success,

1563
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,900
but so has Scrooge, right?

1564
01:01:48,033 --> 01:01:50,667
And it's, it's the other things,

1565
01:01:52,033 --> 01:01:53,734
the important things,

1566
01:01:54,967 --> 01:01:57,400
the things that matter
to us at Christmastime

1567
01:01:57,533 --> 01:02:00,400
that he still has
the power to change.

1568
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:04,767
And I just see that you
are so busy up in here.

1569
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,000
I need you to get
out of your head

1570
01:02:07,133 --> 01:02:08,700
and into your body.

1571
01:02:10,533 --> 01:02:11,600
- Yeah.

1572
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,367
- Spirit! Hear me.

1573
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,000
I am not the man I was.

1574
01:02:34,567 --> 01:02:37,600
I will not be that
man that I have been

1575
01:02:37,734 --> 01:02:39,200
for so many years.

1576
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,533
Why show me all this

1577
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,600
if I am past all hope?

1578
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:54,567
Assure me that I yet
may change the shadows

1579
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,567
that you have shown me.

1580
01:02:58,266 --> 01:02:59,633
Let the boy live!

1581
01:03:03,467 --> 01:03:06,934
I will honor Christmas
in my heart and keep it,

1582
01:03:07,066 --> 01:03:08,567
try to keep it all the year,

1583
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:12,300
in the past and the
present and the future.

1584
01:03:12,433 --> 01:03:16,400
The spirits of all three
shall strive within me.

1585
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,567
I will not shut out the
lessons that they teach,

1586
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,300
the lessons that they teach.

1587
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,266
- Brilliant.

1588
01:03:36,033 --> 01:03:39,967
Ah, it was so good.

1589
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,667
Mm.

1590
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:59,000
Now this is mulled wine.

1591
01:04:00,533 --> 01:04:03,066
It's a English
Christmas tradition.

1592
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,000
- Ooh, it smell spicy.

1593
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:07,233
- One of the vendors
made it in his garage.

1594
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:10,033
- Ooh, garage wine. Risky!

1595
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,200
- Craig actually
tried to make eggnog

1596
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:14,700
a couple of years ago.

1597
01:04:14,834 --> 01:04:16,166
It didn't go his way.

1598
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:17,900
- Can I try?

1599
01:04:18,033 --> 01:04:19,266
- Sure, son.

1600
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,800
No, just kidding.
- Uh, maybe in a few years.

1601
01:04:20,934 --> 01:04:24,734
- Mm, I got something
for you to try. Hang on.

1602
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,467
Here you go, buddy.

1603
01:04:28,433 --> 01:04:30,667
- Oh, Christmas 'crackers.

1604
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,400
- Uh, you got my
child explosives?

1605
01:04:33,533 --> 01:04:36,600
- I did. Yeah,
apologies in advance.

1606
01:04:36,734 --> 01:04:38,066
Although Craig and I,

1607
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,467
we used to blow those
things up every Christmas.

1608
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,166
Good times, good memories.

1609
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,700
- Blew the place up.

1610
01:04:43,834 --> 01:04:46,400
- Speaking of, do you
happen to have the stuff

1611
01:04:46,533 --> 01:04:47,600
that I left at Mom's?

1612
01:04:47,734 --> 01:04:49,200
- Well, as a matter
of fact, yes.

1613
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:51,400
It's been collecting
dust in the shed.

1614
01:04:51,533 --> 01:04:52,667
Walk this way.

1615
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,900
- Cheers.
- Good thing. Cheers.

1616
01:04:58,033 --> 01:05:00,400
- Oh, Dickens League champs,

1617
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,500
peewee division.

1618
01:05:07,633 --> 01:05:08,900
I remember that.

1619
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,500
Do you remember the summer

1620
01:05:13,633 --> 01:05:15,000
you taught me how to
throw a curve ball?

1621
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:17,266
- You mean I tried

1622
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,734
to teach you how to
throw a curve ball?

1623
01:05:18,867 --> 01:05:21,333
- No, no, you taught me.
- No no, it didn't curve much.

1624
01:05:21,467 --> 01:05:23,967
- No, it curved!

1625
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:27,000
- That's what big
brothers are for.

1626
01:05:28,367 --> 01:05:29,166
- Oh, wow.

1627
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,066
I'm sorry, I, I have been gone

1628
01:05:41,934 --> 01:05:43,834
for the past few years.

1629
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,533
And I'm sorry.

1630
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:51,467
- You missed a lot.

1631
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:56,133
But I'm sorry too.

1632
01:05:57,033 --> 01:05:59,066
- Why? Why are you sorry?

1633
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,867
- You know, when mom got sick

1634
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,133
and you were already
in LA working,

1635
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:08,233
my life here was,

1636
01:06:08,367 --> 01:06:09,700
you know, trying to
keep the restaurant open

1637
01:06:09,834 --> 01:06:11,700
and taking care of her.

1638
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:13,867
It was hard.

1639
01:06:15,333 --> 01:06:18,533
So when she died
and you came home

1640
01:06:18,667 --> 01:06:21,033
for the funeral, I was angry,

1641
01:06:23,367 --> 01:06:25,400
and I said a bunch of
things I shouldn't have.

1642
01:06:25,533 --> 01:06:26,600
So I'm sorry.

1643
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,266
- Yeah. Yeah, I remember.

1644
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:37,600
And I also said a lot
of stuff that I regret.

1645
01:06:39,467 --> 01:06:41,200
That was rough patch.

1646
01:06:45,734 --> 01:06:49,133
- You know, the truth
is, I like it here.

1647
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:53,533
I love Dickens, and I
love the restaurant.

1648
01:06:54,734 --> 01:06:56,533
And I'm happy for you.

1649
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,300
Mom would be proud of you.

1650
01:07:04,133 --> 01:07:05,500
I'm proud of you.

1651
01:07:07,567 --> 01:07:09,400
- I just miss her, man.

1652
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,333
- And I know that she
would be proud of you.

1653
01:07:14,467 --> 01:07:16,100
She really would be.

1654
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:18,834
She would also be
really jealous of you,

1655
01:07:18,967 --> 01:07:20,300
because the crust, man,

1656
01:07:20,433 --> 01:07:22,000
on her chicken pot pie.

1657
01:07:22,133 --> 01:07:26,600
'Cause it's, it was
better.

1658
01:07:29,734 --> 01:07:31,767
Hey, I'm coming home a
lot from here on out.

1659
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:36,533
So you're gonna wish that
I would leave, actually.

1660
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:37,967
- Love you, man.

1661
01:07:45,333 --> 01:07:47,900
- So before we get ready
for our dress rehearsal,

1662
01:07:48,033 --> 01:07:50,166
I just wanna say
that this has been

1663
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,000
one of the best
weeks of my life.

1664
01:07:53,133 --> 01:07:55,200
Thanks to all of you.

1665
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:56,333
Thank you.

1666
01:07:56,467 --> 01:07:57,433
- And here's the
Cassie for bringing out

1667
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,567
the best in all of us.

1668
01:08:02,266 --> 01:08:04,233
Oh! Now, before I forget,

1669
01:08:04,367 --> 01:08:05,567
all right, here they are.

1670
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:09,233
Okay, a little birdie
told me that Ray

1671
01:08:09,367 --> 01:08:11,734
used to get you all a
present before the show.

1672
01:08:11,867 --> 01:08:13,233
- It was me. I'm the bird.

1673
01:08:13,367 --> 01:08:14,900
- That's right, he is.

1674
01:08:15,033 --> 01:08:17,300
So I know this is
just dress rehearsal,

1675
01:08:17,433 --> 01:08:19,500
but I wanted to thank you

1676
01:08:19,633 --> 01:08:21,834
for your patience with me

1677
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:24,567
and just for making me feel
like part of the family.

1678
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,433
- Aw, thanks, Jake.
- Merry Christmas.

1679
01:08:26,567 --> 01:08:28,266
- A pocket watch!

1680
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,166
Thanks, Jake.

1681
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,533
Thank you!
- Thanks, Jake.

1682
01:08:33,633 --> 01:08:35,367
- And you, come here.

1683
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,100
All right.

1684
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,967
- You didn't have
to get me something.

1685
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,133
- Technically I didn't.

1686
01:08:46,266 --> 01:08:47,600
I couldn't believe it,

1687
01:08:47,734 --> 01:08:49,100
but when I was going through
all my stuff at Craig's,

1688
01:08:49,233 --> 01:08:50,367
I found this.

1689
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,600
This is the gift that I made you

1690
01:08:51,734 --> 01:08:55,033
all those years ago
that I never gave you.

1691
01:09:00,367 --> 01:09:01,967
- What?

1692
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,734
Is this an actual mixed tape?

1693
01:09:03,867 --> 01:09:05,233
- It is, yeah,
it's the collection

1694
01:09:05,367 --> 01:09:06,400
of all my favorite songs.

1695
01:09:06,533 --> 01:09:07,934
Old things.

1696
01:09:08,066 --> 01:09:09,100
- How am I supposed to play it?

1697
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:10,433
- I don't know.

1698
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,767
- Thank you, Jake.

1699
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,967
- Thank you, Cassie,
for everything.

1700
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,266
- And I got something
for you too.

1701
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,266
- You did?
- I did.

1702
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,967
- Ah!

1703
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:26,033
- Look here. Aw, man.

1704
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:32,333
This is awesome.

1705
01:09:34,867 --> 01:09:37,066
"To my all-time
favorite Scrooge.

1706
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,667
It's all right, it's all true,

1707
01:09:40,834 --> 01:09:42,867
it all happened, Cassie."

1708
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,533
Is this the line from the play?

1709
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:51,667
- Have I taught you nothing?

1710
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:52,600
- Thank you.

1711
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,633
This is an amazing gift.

1712
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:06,166
- I'm so glad you like it.
- I love it.

1713
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:10,133
I love it.

1714
01:10:10,266 --> 01:10:12,033
- Jake!
- Yes.

1715
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,000
- I've been trying
to get ahold of you.

1716
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:15,567
- Uh, yeah, 60,000 texts later.

1717
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:16,633
What's going on?

1718
01:10:16,767 --> 01:10:17,900
- So don't kill me,

1719
01:10:18,033 --> 01:10:19,266
but I may have recorded
some of your rehearsals.

1720
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,166
- Why?

1721
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,400
- Before you get upset,

1722
01:10:21,533 --> 01:10:22,633
I may have sent some
of the best parts

1723
01:10:22,767 --> 01:10:23,800
to some people who
may have sent it

1724
01:10:23,934 --> 01:10:25,800
to their bosses at the studio

1725
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:28,600
making "Dunes of Eastlynn."

1726
01:10:28,734 --> 01:10:32,233
And the producers are
considering you for the role.

1727
01:10:32,367 --> 01:10:33,700
- The role?
- The role.

1728
01:10:33,834 --> 01:10:35,667
- Jake, that's amazing!

1729
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,900
- Okay, hold on a second.

1730
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:39,066
Why, why hasn't
Denise called me yet?

1731
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,333
- Oh, I think your
agent is still trying

1732
01:10:40,467 --> 01:10:41,667
to figure out how to
take credit for it.

1733
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,266
- Well, we know who
the credit belongs to.

1734
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,800
It belongs to you,
and it belongs to you.

1735
01:10:48,033 --> 01:10:49,900
- There is one thing you
have to do first though.

1736
01:10:50,033 --> 01:10:50,867
- What?

1737
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,400
- The producer, Jeff MacQuarrie,

1738
01:10:53,533 --> 01:10:55,033
he has this holiday
party every year.

1739
01:10:55,166 --> 01:10:56,233
- Yeah, okay.

1740
01:10:56,367 --> 01:10:57,633
So this party in
Hollywood, it's like,

1741
01:10:57,767 --> 01:10:59,100
it's infamous.

1742
01:10:59,233 --> 01:11:00,467
You have to be in his inner
circle to get invited.

1743
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,900
- You're invited, Jake.

1744
01:11:02,033 --> 01:11:03,433
- Ah, are you kidding me?

1745
01:11:03,567 --> 01:11:04,400
- That's amazing.

1746
01:11:04,533 --> 01:11:05,667
- He wants to meet you first

1747
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,800
before he makes
his big decision.

1748
01:11:06,934 --> 01:11:08,300
- Of course he does, absolutely.

1749
01:11:08,433 --> 01:11:09,934
When is it?

1750
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:13,767
- Tomorrow night.

1751
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,300
Christmas Eve.

1752
01:11:17,433 --> 01:11:18,667
- Gosh darn it.

1753
01:11:19,834 --> 01:11:21,133
Well, that's a no-brainer.

1754
01:11:21,266 --> 01:11:23,734
I made a commitment to
Cassie, to the play.

1755
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:24,934
I'm not going.

1756
01:11:25,066 --> 01:11:26,967
- Jake, I'm sorry,

1757
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,500
but you have to
play the game here.

1758
01:11:29,633 --> 01:11:30,400
If you want a shot at this part,

1759
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:31,667
you have to be there.

1760
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,800
- Yeah, well, I'm
not gonna be, so.

1761
01:11:33,934 --> 01:11:36,400
- Jake, I think you should go.

1762
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:44,834
- Ben, give me
just five minutes.

1763
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,533
Yeah? Five minutes.

1764
01:11:49,033 --> 01:11:50,266
What are you talking about?

1765
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,166
- The whole reason you're here

1766
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:56,266
is for this exact
career-defining role,

1767
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,033
and now you have a shot.

1768
01:11:58,166 --> 01:11:59,967
I am not gonna be the one

1769
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:02,500
to stand in the way
of your dream part.

1770
01:12:02,633 --> 01:12:03,800
- Okay, with all due respect,

1771
01:12:03,934 --> 01:12:04,633
I understand that.

1772
01:12:04,767 --> 01:12:06,700
But what about the play?

1773
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:09,533
- We'll figure it out.

1774
01:12:09,667 --> 01:12:11,767
- Cassie, you needed
this to be a success.

1775
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,800
- No, what I needed
was to remember

1776
01:12:15,967 --> 01:12:17,700
why I love directing.

1777
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:20,800
It's not about success,

1778
01:12:22,533 --> 01:12:24,633
it's about the whole production,

1779
01:12:24,767 --> 01:12:26,967
the whole experience with
the cast and the crew

1780
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,734
and watching the whole
play come together,

1781
01:12:29,867 --> 01:12:32,834
helping you find
that inner Scrooge.

1782
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,367
Yeah, that's the whole thing.

1783
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:40,700
And it all made me
realize that, directing,

1784
01:12:40,834 --> 01:12:43,600
that is what I am meant to do,

1785
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:46,333
and that's not gonna change.

1786
01:12:46,467 --> 01:12:50,567
- You know what else
is not gonna change?

1787
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,767
Your Scrooge.

1788
01:12:53,767 --> 01:12:54,734
I'm staying.

1789
01:12:56,934 --> 01:12:59,367
- Then I'm kicking
you off the show.

1790
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,900
- What are you talking about?

1791
01:13:02,033 --> 01:13:03,900
You can't do that.

1792
01:13:04,033 --> 01:13:05,033
- I just did.

1793
01:13:08,533 --> 01:13:11,533
Jake, you've wanted
this for so long,

1794
01:13:14,233 --> 01:13:15,633
and you're ready.

1795
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,100
You're ready.

1796
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,033
- But what about us?

1797
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,734
- I, um, I have to figure out

1798
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,900
my own future,

1799
01:13:31,033 --> 01:13:35,166
you know, before I can
have one with someone else.

1800
01:13:45,533 --> 01:13:46,333
- Hey.

1801
01:13:50,066 --> 01:13:52,400
I am sorry that I have to go.

1802
01:13:52,533 --> 01:13:54,934
I hope you're not
too disappointed.

1803
01:13:55,066 --> 01:13:56,400
- It's okay.

1804
01:13:56,533 --> 01:13:59,533
Dad said the movie is about
grandma's favorite book.

1805
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:01,300
- How did you know
what role it was?

1806
01:14:01,433 --> 01:14:02,667
- Cassie.

1807
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,934
That's when I understood

1808
01:14:04,066 --> 01:14:05,934
why you had to leave again.

1809
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:08,767
And if she didn't make
you go, I would have.

1810
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,633
- when will I see you
again, Uncle Jake?

1811
01:14:10,767 --> 01:14:12,233
- Soon, I promise.

1812
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,400
I got a lot to come back for.

1813
01:14:15,533 --> 01:14:19,100
I got you, I've got
your mom, your dad.

1814
01:14:19,233 --> 01:14:20,834
- Isn't there
another reason, Jake?

1815
01:14:24,667 --> 01:14:25,800
- I can't believe
he's just gonna leave.

1816
01:14:25,934 --> 01:14:27,433
Well, he didn't
have a choice, Mom.

1817
01:14:27,567 --> 01:14:28,700
- Why?

1818
01:14:28,834 --> 01:14:29,967
- Because I kicked
him off the show.

1819
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,467
Well, I'm not talking
about the show, honey.

1820
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,800
I'm talking about your heart.

1821
01:14:33,934 --> 01:14:34,900
- Right, well, I also-

1822
01:14:35,033 --> 01:14:36,166
- If there's one thing

1823
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,400
the last few weeks
have proven to me,

1824
01:14:37,533 --> 01:14:40,600
it's that you are a
fabulous director.

1825
01:14:41,734 --> 01:14:43,266
And I know you'll figure out

1826
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,033
how to put on a great play.

1827
01:14:46,166 --> 01:14:49,133
And I'm sorry for
ever doubting you.

1828
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:53,367
- Thank you. That means a lot.

1829
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:59,266
- I've also never
seen you so happy,

1830
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,133
until today, that is.

1831
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:07,533
You know, I understand why you
kicked him out of the play.

1832
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:10,633
I doubt he would've
left if you hadn't.

1833
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:14,900
But, did you tell him you
wanted him to come back?

1834
01:15:17,433 --> 01:15:18,233
- No.

1835
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,000
- Do you?

1836
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,100
- Yes.

1837
01:15:25,066 --> 01:15:28,100
- Then he
deserves to know.

1838
01:15:29,467 --> 01:15:32,033
- Mom, I told him it
wasn't the right time.

1839
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:33,233
- And is that the truth?

1840
01:15:33,367 --> 01:15:34,166
- No.

1841
01:15:35,734 --> 01:15:37,433
- You're just scared.

1842
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:42,233
Plus, the heart doesn't
care about timing,

1843
01:15:42,367 --> 01:15:46,033
it only knows who
makes it beat faster.

1844
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:49,900
- Thank you.

1845
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,500
- You okay?

1846
01:16:07,467 --> 01:16:10,867
- Ben, you've had my
back for a long time.

1847
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,367
You're the only person I trust.

1848
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:21,333
Do you think I'm
doing the right thing?

1849
01:16:21,467 --> 01:16:24,934
- Do you want me to answer
that as your assistant

1850
01:16:25,066 --> 01:16:26,533
or as your friend?

1851
01:16:31,266 --> 01:16:33,667
- How about as my manager?

1852
01:16:35,567 --> 01:16:37,400
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

1853
01:16:37,533 --> 01:16:38,567
I mean, I don't know
what took me so long.

1854
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:39,400
- Yeah.
- I mean, you've been

1855
01:16:39,533 --> 01:16:41,800
in that role for years.

1856
01:16:41,934 --> 01:16:43,200
It's about time
you get recognized,

1857
01:16:45,433 --> 01:16:47,166
and paid for it.

1858
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,867
- Well, now I am really
glad I came with you

1859
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,066
to Dickens instead of Vegas.

1860
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:53,567
Thank you, Jake.

1861
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,133
- You guys, he
didn't want to leave.

1862
01:17:09,266 --> 01:17:10,333
I told him to go.

1863
01:17:10,467 --> 01:17:11,567
- What? Why?

1864
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:14,400
- Because this is a role
of a lifetime for him,

1865
01:17:14,533 --> 01:17:17,600
and we are still gonna
put on a great show.

1866
01:17:17,734 --> 01:17:19,800
This is community theater.

1867
01:17:19,934 --> 01:17:21,667
It's not about any one of us,

1868
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,633
it's about all of us.

1869
01:17:23,767 --> 01:17:25,233
- So we're not
canceling the show?

1870
01:17:25,367 --> 01:17:26,867
- Of course not.

1871
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,867
You guys have worked
way too hard for that.

1872
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,400
- So what are we
supposed to do now?

1873
01:17:30,533 --> 01:17:32,200
We're right back where
we were last week.

1874
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:33,867
- We're gonna be fine, trust me.

1875
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,066
- Are we?

1876
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,133
Because there's a
bunch of new stations

1877
01:17:36,266 --> 01:17:37,433
coming from Cleveland,

1878
01:17:37,567 --> 01:17:39,233
all here to see Jake Dorsey.
- That's true.

1879
01:17:39,367 --> 01:17:40,467
- What are they going to say

1880
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,033
when they find out
he's not even here?

1881
01:17:42,166 --> 01:17:44,133
- I don't know, but
they're gonna see

1882
01:17:44,266 --> 01:17:46,100
a great performance.

1883
01:17:46,233 --> 01:17:48,934
- Well, who's
gonna play Scrooge?

1884
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,400
- Me.

1885
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:54,400
- I mean, with
the right costume,

1886
01:17:54,533 --> 01:17:55,767
I think we could pull it off.

1887
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:56,900
It could be great.

1888
01:17:57,033 --> 01:17:58,567
- You guys, we're doing this.

1889
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,200
The show must go on.

1890
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:01,500
Get into it. Let's go!

1891
01:18:01,633 --> 01:18:03,467
- Whoo!
- All right!

1892
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,233
Let's go!

1893
01:18:23,467 --> 01:18:25,066
Okay, this is it.

1894
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,266
Break a leg, everyone.

1895
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,166
And I'm gonna need
a compound fracture.

1896
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,433
- Are you sure
you wanna do this?

1897
01:18:30,567 --> 01:18:32,433
- Well, I would rather
be down here with you,

1898
01:18:32,567 --> 01:18:34,600
but I don't really
have a choice.

1899
01:18:34,734 --> 01:18:35,967
Okay, I gotta get to the stage.

1900
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:37,000
- Okay. Oh, your headset.

1901
01:18:37,133 --> 01:18:38,600
- Oh, sorry. Okay.

1902
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:44,567
- Hi!

1903
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,033
- What is happening?

1904
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:48,533
Um, hold lights. Hold lights.

1905
01:18:48,667 --> 01:18:51,767
- Hey. Sorry, guys.

1906
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,266
- What are you doing here?

1907
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,166
As much as I would actually love

1908
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:59,200
to see you play Scrooge,
and I really would,

1909
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:02,367
I have grown fond of the role,

1910
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:03,400
and of you.

1911
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,467
I meant it when I said
you could count on me.

1912
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,700
-
They showed up.

1913
01:19:12,834 --> 01:19:14,633
- It's Jake!
_ Hey, look, it's Jake!

1914
01:19:14,767 --> 01:19:16,867
- All right.
- You see? He's back.

1915
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,100
- Yeah, we've got a show to do.

1916
01:19:18,233 --> 01:19:19,800
All right, let me go, uh-

1917
01:19:19,934 --> 01:19:21,433
- Get ready, okay.

Merry Christmas ♪

1919
01:19:24,033 --> 01:19:26,300

1924
01:19:37,066 --> 01:19:38,200
- Bah, humbug!

1925
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:42,266
Merry Christmas, indeed.

1926
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,300
Spirit, say that the
boy will be spared.

1927
01:19:49,467 --> 01:19:51,667
- If he be like to die,
he had better do it

1928
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,633
and decrease the
surplus population.

1929
01:19:53,767 --> 01:19:55,100
- No.

1930
01:19:55,233 --> 01:19:57,734
- And so I release you with
a full heart, Ebenezer.

1931
01:19:57,867 --> 01:19:59,800
- Turn around, you fool.

1932
01:19:59,934 --> 01:20:01,600
What's wrong with you?

1933
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,567
Oh, Spirit, oh, oh.

1934
01:20:08,133 --> 01:20:10,767
Spirit!

1935
01:20:19,967 --> 01:20:24,000
Merry Christmas, all!

1936
01:20:25,133 --> 01:20:28,433
Happy New Year to all the world!

1937
01:20:28,567 --> 01:20:29,367
Ah, hello!

1938
01:20:30,533 --> 01:20:33,033
There, the window

1939
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:36,967
through which I saw all
the wandering spirits!

1940
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,433
It's all right.

1941
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,734
It's all true.

1942
01:20:50,133 --> 01:20:51,400
It all happened.

1943
01:20:54,667 --> 01:20:56,300
- Merry Christmas, indeed.

1944
01:20:56,433 --> 01:20:57,767
- That's all you
need to say, Bob.

1945
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:58,834
Hop up, boy!

1946
01:20:59,734 --> 01:21:00,633
Oh! Hey!

1947
01:21:00,767 --> 01:21:03,200
- God bless us every one!

1948
01:21:14,133 --> 01:21:16,734
- Ray Muller, everybody!

1949
01:21:16,867 --> 01:21:18,233
This play would not be possible

1950
01:21:18,367 --> 01:21:21,567
without our amazing
and brilliant director.

1951
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,800
Let's hear it for Cassie Pruitt.

1952
01:21:23,934 --> 01:21:25,567
Cassie, come on out.

1953
01:21:26,533 --> 01:21:27,667
Good job.

1954
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:32,533
- Thank you.

1955
01:21:34,367 --> 01:21:35,467
- Uncle Jake, say the line.

1956
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,600
- You want me to say it?
- Yeah.

1957
01:21:36,734 --> 01:21:38,800
- Hey, do the right thing.

1958
01:21:38,934 --> 01:21:41,467
- Or it's the
last thing you'll do!

1959
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,934
- That's right.

1960
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:44,367
Congratulations.

1961
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:47,467
- And a cheers to you.

1962
01:21:50,066 --> 01:21:51,066
- I'm so proud of you.

1963
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,533
You guys just nailed it.

1964
01:21:52,667 --> 01:21:54,066
There wasn't a dry
eye in the house.

1965
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,600
- Thank you, Craig.

1966
01:21:55,734 --> 01:21:56,600
- Come here.

1967
01:21:58,467 --> 01:21:59,567
I love you, buddy.

1968
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:02,500
- Ah, I love you
too, little brother.

1969
01:22:02,633 --> 01:22:05,166
- And this one

1970
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,900
is gonna take Broadway by storm.

1971
01:22:24,734 --> 01:22:26,367
Hey. You look happy.

1972
01:22:29,567 --> 01:22:32,433
- Yeah, I'm happier than I've
been in a really long time.

1973
01:22:32,567 --> 01:22:33,700
- Me too.

1974
01:22:33,834 --> 01:22:36,066
- You have no idea
how relieved I was

1975
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,667
to see you standing
on that stage.

1976
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,867
- It's the easiest, best
decision of my life.

1977
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,934
- But you miss the party in LA.

1978
01:22:45,066 --> 01:22:46,667
Now you're not gonna
get the role you wanted.

1979
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,367
- Maybe, maybe not.

1980
01:22:51,934 --> 01:22:53,166
It's Christmas,

1981
01:22:54,834 --> 01:22:57,533
and I need to be with
the people that I love.

1982
01:22:57,667 --> 01:23:02,133
- How do you feel about
long distance relationships?

1983
01:23:02,266 --> 01:23:04,467
- Cassie, wherever you are,

1984
01:23:05,433 --> 01:23:06,767
that's where I wanna be.

1985
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,166
- Mm, good line.

1986
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,867
Or was it the delivery?

1987
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,066
- It wasn't a line,

1988
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,633
and I'm not acting.
