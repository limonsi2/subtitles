GO SEPPUKU YOURSELVES

16
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,772
How are you doing today?

17
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,524
Feverish?

18
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:41,319
Got money for medicine?
Guess not.

19
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:42,862
How about you?

20
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,282
Take the medicine and get well,

21
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,744
or leave it and kick the bucket.

22
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,414
You know what that means? Hell.

23
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:55,333
You hear?

24
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,835
Oh dear, you're getting
worse by day.

25
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,129
And you.

26
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,715
The epidemic got you, too?

27
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,677
What you need,
is money for medicine.

28
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,305
No money, tough luck.

29
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:11,974
You're still young.

30
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:17,814
Eat some fish, fart, and sleep.
That should sort you out.

31
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,192
Medicine...

32
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:22,610
Money first.

33
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:28,950
Money, money, money,
money is the enemy of the times.

34
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:42,380
Oh dear, Danbe, you're looking
a little worse for wear.

35
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:49,262
Be conscious about your looks
when you've passed forty, I say.

36
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:55,435
I'm bored of hearing
your usual balderdash.

37
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:00,398
What's wrong?
Is it about the epidemic palaver?

38
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:03,609
Since the well's been contaminated,

39
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:09,240
the magistrate's guards are eradicating
lawbreakers by beheading

40
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,451
or ordering them to do seppuku.

41
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,661
They'll come for you.

42
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,496
Me?

43
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,207
I'm just a medicine seller.

44
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,085
Who'd benefit from the epidemic.

45
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,755
I see... it's like that?

46
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:27,675
The culprit must be evil.

47
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:30,553
But I can see their motives.

48
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:35,057
Our avaricious magistrate
are paying for

49
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,604
their own wrongdoings at last.

50
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:44,525
Since when do you speak
like a wise man, huh?

51
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:47,820
I'm a pebble in a riverbed.

52
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,908
All edges get rounded over time.

53
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,869
The well nearby
is contaminated, too.

54
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:57,330
Any ideas?

55
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,792
A demon, I heard.

56
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:05,338
No one can be that savage unless

57
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:09,091
it's a demon or an evil spirit.

58
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:15,848
I'm looking for that demon.

59
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,478
An outsider, I wager.

60
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,025
I'm a samurai.

61
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:11,862
Killing people is what I do.

62
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,693
Raikan Kichiemon.

63
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:24,865
As the punishment for poisoning
the town's wells,

64
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,701
I order you to commit seppuku.

65
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:38,045
Like I said many times,

66
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:42,675
I know nothing about that poison.

67
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:47,638
Shame on you,
quibbleing until the end.

68
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,975
A woman said she saw you.

69
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:55,145
You spread the disease on purpose.

70
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,148
Did you not, Raikan?

71
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,740
You seem so eager to watch
me commit seppuku.

72
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:12,496
Exasperating I may,

73
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,750
yet I'd seppuku myself
if you insist.

74
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:21,005
The world today is
not worth living for.

75
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:25,426
Stop talking nonsense
and get on with it.

76
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:30,472
I must tell you
one thing before I die.

77
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:36,103
You are the ones
spreading the epidemic.

78
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:41,066
Each and every one of you

79
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,701
has been possessed
by an evil spirit.

80
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,163
Even now, as we speak...

81
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,509
you're letting it spread itself.

82
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,513
And the poor are dying from it.

83
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:18,896
Sucking the peasants dry with land tax
under the name of governance.

84
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,273
Shut up, outsider!

85
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:29,281
The one who poisoned the wells
was a demon.

86
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,118
Not a human.

87
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:37,373
Not that it matters to me.

88
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,251
Every single one of you should

89
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,088
go to hell!

90
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:47,800
After death,

91
00:16:50,678 --> 00:16:53,180
you can be reborn and start over.

92
00:16:56,517 --> 00:17:01,063
You cannot continue exploiting
the poor and making them suffer.

93
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:02,690
It's your turn

94
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,989
to go to hell.

95
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:17,621
God created the epidemic
out of fury.

96
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:25,295
And as a punishment
of your wrongdoings.

97
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:33,554
If my seppuku would clear out
the epidemic and save the poor,

98
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,765
I'll cut my stomach open with honor.

99
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,478
Then do it already!

100
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,696
There was a rogue samurai
in the red-light district,

101
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:56,994
and a young lad nearby laughed
at this samurai being smarmy.

102
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,497
The lad ended up
becoming a rogue himself.

103
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,212
They ran into each other one day,
and the samurai said to him

104
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,216
"Don't beat yourself up."

105
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,888
"A lost coin in deep snow
will be lost forever,"

106
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:21,351
"lost love under the bridge
will soon to be a telltale."

107
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:26,315
"Life is short,"

108
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:33,155
"too short to have your
questions answered."

109
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,201
"So you, who I met in the past,"

110
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,163
"whether you will be reborn
or you won't,"

111
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:47,252
"take a gamble and
see it for yourself."

112
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:00,974
I have lived my
whole life with sword.

113
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,814
One who has been following
the 'right' path all one's life,

114
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,233
is boring as fuck.

115
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:14,822
A path which is barely within the law,
there is pastime.

116
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:19,618
Life without pastime
is not worth living.

117
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,330
On a detour you take,
discover compassion.

118
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,126
I have killed many for money.

119
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:32,381
I have indulged myself with
good <i>sake</i> and fine women.

120
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,762
Yet I am enraged with intolerance.

121
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,684
Of your goddamn decision!

122
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,525
Have you ever said
anything like this?

123
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:57,072
Have you ever been allowed to do
anything you like?

124
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:04,496
Have I ever been a fawner?
Over my dead body!

125
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,502
Father, mother,

126
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:16,633
and brothers, I've been nothing
but the black sheep of the family.

127
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,261
Everybody dies.

128
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:24,892
Nobody can stand in my way.

129
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:39,823
I'll do whatever the hell
I want to do before I die.

130
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,998
But you lot, no matter
how hard you try,

131
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:53,462
your lives will never be
as good as mine.

132
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,177
Just deserts!

133
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,848
You bastards.

134
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,290
All kinds of disgrace and sins,

135
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:19,798
now purified, refreshed.

136
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,222
The end of the epidemic

137
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,810
at Mt. Resurrection-Wolf.

138
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,733
Funeral procession on its path.

139
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:51,288
I will be reborn as a beast.

140
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,252
Now all of you,

141
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,214
go seppuku yourselves!
