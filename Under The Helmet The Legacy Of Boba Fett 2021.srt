<i>We had to hit the ground running.</i>

47
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:02,372
<i>Because there were more shots</i>
<i>and there were more complicated designs.</i>

48
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:07,210
<i>Ralph McQuarrie and I</i>
<i>had traded sketches back and forth</i>

49

<i>And it evolved into Boba Fett.</i>

51
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,010
I liked the design. I don't think
we even changed that much of him.

52
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,595
There were different versions of it.

54
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,559

<i>the armature</i>
<i>and all the gadgets and weaponry,</i>

57
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,735
<i>is something we've</i>
<i>never seen in</i> Star Wars <i>before.</i>

58
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,238
One thing that stood out above the rest
is his "T" visor.

59
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,283
<i>Medieval in its styling,</i>

60
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:42,203
<i>it's something that speaks to, you know,</i>
<i>the days of sword and sorcery.</i>

61
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:46,207
It just gives him that added dimension
of magic and mystique.

62
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:50,420
JOHNSTON: <i>I don't remember if Ralph</i>
<i>added the "T" shape or if I did it,</i>

63
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,423
<i>or if George came by and said,</i>
<i>"Hey, give him a 'T' shape."</i>

64
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,758
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I don't remember where that came from.</i>

65
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,262
But during the whole process of evolution,
a lot of stuff like that would happen

66
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,306
<i>where somebody would suggest something</i>

67
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,892

<i>the power of a design.</i>

69

Anything out there
that resembles that visor

70
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,191
is just Boba Fett.

71
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:16,362
JOHNSTON: <i>The Boba Fett suit itself</i>
<i>was originally intended to be an army</i>

72
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,698

73
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,826
<i>and the plan was</i>
<i>to build 100 of these suits,</i>

74
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,664

<i>to the crew in England.</i>

77
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,005

you know, introduction.
"Here's the new character, Boba Fett"

79
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:41,804
Boba has sort of a radio voice.
There's a speaker built into him here.

80
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,682
And also, there's a certain amount
of telemetry going on.

81
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,393
And certain amount of feedback
for some reason.

82
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,604
It was just a show-and-tell
of the character,

83
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,231
but it was a very functional costume.

84
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,107

86
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,819
There's a flamethrower here.

87
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,988
This is a dart-throwing device.

88
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,865
Very deadly.

89
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:05,036
These also shoot some sort of darts,
projectiles from each knee.

90
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,206
Sure, have him turn around
and get a shot of the jetpack.

91
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,166

(JETPACK WHOOSHING)

93
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,379

95
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,550

to fit that costume.

<i>"Okay."</i>

98
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:27,433
George is standing there and he's looking,
and he says, "You know, we need a cape."

99
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:32,563
I said, "George, there's a <i>Star Wars</i> towel
right there in the garage. (LAUGHING)

100

"We use it when we rinse off
after a volleyball game at lunch."

101
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:40,363
That was the first introduction of Boba
in some sort of physical form to us,

102
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,074
<i>months before</i>
<i>the film went into production.</i>

103
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,076
Apparently, there was a budget issue.

104
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,495
And once the original suit was built,

105
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,707
George decided that
we didn't have the money

106
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,710
to turn them into an army.
But we had this one suit.

107
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,547
And George said, "Let's make him
a different kind of a character.

108
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,299
"Let's make him a bounty hunter."

109
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,136
<i>So the first thing I did was</i>
<i>I painted the entire thing silver,</i>

110
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,181
<i>so that when I put</i>
<i>the subsequent layers of paint on,</i>

111
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:11,185
<i>it would look like something hit the suit</i>
<i>and broke the covering away,</i>

112
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,688
<i>whether it's paint</i>
<i>or some kind of metallic finish,</i>

113
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,398
<i>and you would see the metal underneath.</i>

114
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,693
And from that, I just started
mixing rail road colors

115
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,570
and just painting it up and damaging it.

116
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,488
I would take a heat gun,

117
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,491
<i>I heat the plastic,</i>
<i>and I think I had a rock or something</i>

118
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,494
<i>that I would then press</i>
<i>into the hot plastic to make a dent.</i>

119
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,079
George never came by and said,

120
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,665
"I don't know,
I don't like that orange on there."

121
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,043
You know, he said,
"Just take it and run with it."

122
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,253
<i>There was no sort of interim stage.</i>

123
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,340
<i>He went from white plastic to Boba Fett.</i>

124
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,218
I said, "This is a good character.
People like the bad guys."

125
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,348

this holiday special.

the actual release
of <i>The Empire Strikes Back.</i>

135
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,664
FILONI: <i>Beautiful work, very stylized.</i>

136
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,543
It's just very simple,
kind of fantasy storytelling.

137
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,755
Chewbacca suspected all along
there was something bad about Boba.

138
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,423
How did you know, Chewie?

139
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,135
It wasn't until the last ten years
that any of us realized

140
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,389
that a month before
the <i>Star Wars Holiday Special</i> came out,

141
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,768
<i>Boba Fett was actually</i>
<i>in this Marin County parade.</i>

142
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,774
BURTT: <i>George Lucas,</i>
<i>who lives in the town,</i>

143
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,986
<i>wanted to do something very local</i>
<i>that was exciting about</i> Star Wars.

144
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,199
And so, they put Vader
and this strange character, Boba Fett,

145
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,202
<i>that people didn't know,</i>
<i>into the local parade.</i>

146
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:58,709
It's hard to imagine a local parade

147
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:02,171
where <i>Star Wars</i> characters,
not just like people in costumes,

148
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,174
<i>the actual screen-use costumes</i>
<i>are walking down the street.</i>

149
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,802
But that's exactly what happened.

150
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,934
Duwayne was inside it at the time.

151
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,687
<i>And it was a strange sight</i>

152
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,107
<i>because Boba hadn't been put on film yet</i>
<i>and become well-known.</i>

153
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,903
DUNHAM: <i>At first glance, you didn't say,</i>
<i>"Oh, that's a stormtrooper."</i>

154
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,655
You said, "Whoa, who is that?"

155
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,287
VILMUR: <i>Vader was a known</i>
<i>quantity at that point.</i>

156
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,915
But the fans definitely responded to Fett.

157
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,170
LUCAS: <i>And that's where</i>
<i>it really started.</i>

158
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,341
You know, and then, over time,
we put him in the movies.

159
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:54,098
I think what made Boba Fett really popular
was that he was a mystery.

160
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,602
<i>Like Darth Vader, the helmet was his face.</i>

161
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,229
I liked that
we didn't give him any backstory.

162
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,231
<i>He was just one of the bounty hunters.</i>

163
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,108
George never worried
about stuff like that.

164
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,861
He never felt like

00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:29,613
<i>that have Boba Fett as part</i>
<i>of a broader spectrum of characters.</i>

328
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:34,994
This is a Japanese Boba Fett toy,
and it actually tap dances

329
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,247
to a couple of <i>Star Wars</i> melodies.

330
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,668
<i>There are many strange Boba Fett things,</i>
<i>there are many fan-made Boba Fett objects.</i>

331
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,422
But perhaps my favorite
because of what Rancho Obi-Wan used to be

332
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:50,217
<i>is a painted Easter egg of Boba Fett.</i>

333
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,928
The inside of the egg is long gone.

334
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:57,474
One of the reasons that Boba Fett
has become so popular among collectors

335
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:02,896
is because of the story of
the send-away Boba Fett action figure.

336
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,276
Here we have two versions
of the rocket-firing Boba Fett,

337
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,737
the one with a four-sided missile.

338
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,032
And this was an attempt to do
a locking mechanism

339
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,867
with an eight-sided rocket.

340
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,328
This is instead
what we all got in the mail.

341
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:22,082
Boba Fett in a plastic package
with a sonic-welded missile in it,

342
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,625
and a note to consumers...

343
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,130
"Sorry, the launcher has been removed
from the product for safety reasons.

344
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,216
"If you're unhappy,
we'll send you a different figure."

345
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,095
<i>The handful that are out there</i>
<i>in the public among collectors</i>

346
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,767
came from the ones that were tested
at Kenner Products in Cincinnati,

347
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:45,314
and when they go up at auctions,
they can go into the six figures now.

348
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,609
The Boba Fett figure was a big deal
because if you had that,

349
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,361
you had a capable villain
to do your adventures with.

350
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,031
<i>And it invited creative thinking.</i>

351
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,825
<i>It invited stories to be told</i>
<i>about this character.</i>

352
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,495
<i>And now we play</i>
<i>with biggest toys there are.</i>

353
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,413
And Boba Fett is still one of them.

354
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:06,251
He gets out of the Darth Vader carrying
case, and he's back in play. (LAUGHS)

355
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,962
(DEVICE BEEPING)

356
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:14,218
KENNEDY: <i>How the fans would react to</i>
<i>Boba Fett reappearing in</i> The Mandalorian.

357
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,888
<i>We knew it would be big, I have to say.</i>

358
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,308
I think this was
sort of a gasp rather than a scream.

359
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,979
MORRISON: <i>All that time since the '80s,</i>

360
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,023
<i>when Boba disappeared...</i>

361
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:33,070
and now it was like,
"Here he comes. The great comeback"

362
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,072
KENNEDY: <i>To have Temuera Morrison back,</i>

363
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,074
he's just remarkable in the part.

364
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,827
Big day today.

365
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,495
(WHOOSHING)

366
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,582
First reveal.

367
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,418
I've been tracking you, Mandalorian.

368
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,046
Boba, he's back.

369
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,007
MAN: Here we go. And... Action!

370
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,720
WEN: <i>What happened to Boba Fett</i>
<i>after he was swallowed up by the Sarlacc?</i>

371
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,514
That's a story in itself.

372
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,141
I'm here for the armor.

373
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,270
If you want my armor,
you'll have to peel it off my dead body.

374
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,482
Where's Boba been all this time?

375
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:14,945
I don't want your armor. I want my armor.

376
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,446
It belongs to me.

377
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,870
BURTT: <i>I never imagined that Boba Fett</i>
<i>would be a character,</i>

378
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:27,416
that we'd be talking about 40-plus years
after he was created.

379
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,212
A character if you see it,
and it enters your imagination

380
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,215
at the right age, it changes your DNA.
You sort of carry it along.

381
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,844
<i>And there was</i>
<i>a whole generation of</i> Star Wars <i>kids,</i>

382
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,639
<i>I would call them, and young fans</i>
<i>that absorbed what was in the movies.</i>

383
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,938
And it became a culture.

384
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,608
The world was ready
for this bounty hunter.

385
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,029
FILONI: <i>Temuera and what he's brought</i>
<i>to the character,</i>

386
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,074
Daniel, Jeremy, these people
that have been in the suit,

387
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,493
<i>it becomes their legacy as well.</i>

388
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,958
Fans have wanted this character
to come back in <i>Star Wars</i> for so long.

389
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,629
<i>It's even more exciting to realize</i>

390
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,132
that we have a whole series
on the way that features Boba Fett.

391
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,717
(CRACKLING)

392
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,470
<i>The anticipation is remarkable.</i>
