5
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:21,467
Cherry Springs. The kind of
place that's frozen in time.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,266
Friendly and familiar
faces on every corner.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,633
I came back to find
comfort in that familiarity.

8
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:34,000
But beneath the facade of a
peaceful life, lies a darkness.

9
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:38,667
It seems even the quaintest
of towns hide big secrets.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,800
And the truth?

11
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:46,100
Well, that's something I
just couldn't run away from.

12
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,033
Ok, come on.
Let's take a little walk.

13
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,367
Hey Uncle Joe. Need any help?

14
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,000
No, no, I think that's it.

15
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:54,000
I got the cake in the car.
We all set.

16
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:57,133
You still calling it "the cake"
after all these years?

17
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:58,500
What's wrong with that?

18
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:01,066
Well, it's your specialty.
Give it some pizazz.

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Uncle Joe's Butter Bundt.

20
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:07,066
No. That's a mouthful.
People ask for the cake.

21
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,900
I give them the cake.

22
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:11,400
I'm a simple man.

23
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:13,867
And I love you for it,
Uncle Joe.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,633
You know I didn't think you'd
stick around this long,

25
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,400
but I am glad that you did.

26
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:23,800
Well, Mom's house
isn't gonna sell itself.

27
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:26,934
Can you believe it's
coming up on a year

28
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:29,066
since she's been gone?

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,967
Yeah, I miss her
every single day.

30
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,333
You know I could've
handled this for you.

31
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:40,100
I know. I wanted to be here.

32
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:44,567
Anyway, all this talk of the
festival has got me nostalgic.

33
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,567
I couldn't miss it.

34
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,567
You want a ride?

35
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,667
Nah, I'm gonna stop by Rachel's.

36
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,734
See if she needs a help setting
up her pet adoption tent.

37
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:51,934
Look at you.

38
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:54,533
Been here for a
month and already

39
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:58,900
Cherry Springs,
citizen of the year.

40
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:01,400
C'mon, Bogie.
Let's go see some friends.

41
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,567
Come on buddy.
Come on buddy.

42
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,300
Come on, Bogey.

43
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:07,333
Bye. Have a good day.

44
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:09,300
Hey! Ready to head out?

45
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:11,200
Yep. Tony's out back
loading up the truck.

46
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,433
Hi!

47
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:17,133
Here's hoping we find
some little pups a home.

48
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:19,400
Sorry.
This guy's off the market.

49
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,967
This guy's taken, too.

50
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,433
They asked me to be a part of

51
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:23,967
the festival's eligible
bachelor auction,

52
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,100
but I turned 'em down.

53
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:26,633
Oh! That's a shame.

54
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:27,967
Could of used that twenty
dollars you would've earned.

55
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,934
Thanks, Honey.

56
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:30,433
I said he'd go for five.

57
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:32,800
Wow. Kid forgets who
signs his paychecks.

58
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:34,133
Good to see you Mel.

59
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:34,900
Hey.

60
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,667
Melanie, this is Ryan Monroe.

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,767
He works at the
auto body shop with me.

62
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,266
Nice to meet you.

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,166
Nice to meet ya.

64
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,633
And what brings you
out to this way?

65
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:42,967
Oh, I'm just visiting my
old stomping grounds.

66
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,300
Been friends with
these two forever.

67
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,233
I'm talking pre, Pre-K.

68
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,066
Rachel thought you'd be
back in Boston by now.

69
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,834
I told her you can't
get enough of us.

70
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:51,734
I guess I'm enjoying the R&R.

71
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:52,934
What did you do up in Boston?

72
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,066
I'm an investigative reporter
for the Boston Chronicle.

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,400
Exposes crooks.
Fights injustice.

74
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,233
Like Lois Lane
if she were Superman.

75
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:01,500
Always knew she
was going places.

76
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:05,000
Speaking of going places,
let's get a move on.

77
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,066
Come on, let's go, let's go.

78
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:18,834
Thank you all for coming
today to celebrate

79
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,066
the opening of the
Twila Birch Community Center.

80
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,133
Uh, ha ha, yeah!

81
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:31,567
A beautiful center like this

82
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,800
deserves a beautiful
celebration,

83
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:35,200
and our vendors and volunteers

84
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,333
have really brought
out their best

85
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:39,967
this year for our
inaugural festival.

86
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,066
Let's give it up for them.

87
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,400
That's right, that's right.

88
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:48,533
Now, I have volunteered
on the committee to make this

89
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,734
community center a reality
for the past three years.

90
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:52,333
And I can say that no one

91
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:56,533
has worked harder to bring
us here than one man.

92
00:04:56,667 --> 00:05:00,533
It is my honor to introduce
to you a beloved member of

93
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:05,734
Cherry Springs, Mr. Dan Birch.

94
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:08,133
Thank you Diana for
that warm introduction.

95
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,066
It was my late wife,
Twila's,

96
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,266
dying wish, that we build
a place, where our entire

97
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,767
community can gather
and celebrate the spirit

98
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,367
of Cherry Springs.

99
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,767
So please sign up,
get your memberships:

100
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,300
because just in a few days
we're going to be offering

101
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,900
an assortment of classes
at the Twila center gym.

102
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:32,066
And after your workout,

103
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,433
after Pilates, you can
enjoy a run around the track

104
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,767
or even a swim
in the indoor pool.

105
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,367
Thank you all for coming.

106
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,266
And let's make this
a really special community.

107
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,734
Thank you.

108
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,934
Wow. Diana was really born
to be behind that microphone.

109
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:53,300
As a speaker? Yes.
As a singer? Not so much.

110
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,867
Oh, I still have PTSD from her

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,400
karaoke party
last year in Vegas.

112
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:01,967
Heads up. We've got a customer.

113
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,000
I-- can I...?

114
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:04,934
Yeah! Go ahead. Sure.

115
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:07,033
Sorry, he loses his
ability to form sentences

116
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,467
when he sees dogs.

117
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,200
Well, if you're
interested in adopting.

118
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,800
Uh no, I got enough to handle.

119
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:14,400
Come on. Please, Dad.

120
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:18,967
That's Bogie.

121
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,166
How old is he?

122
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,033
He's 8.

123
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,033
That's...
fifty-six in dog years.

124
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,800
Wow. That's some quick math!

125
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:28,133
Smart guy, like his old man.

126
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:31,000
Mention old man
and I shall appear.

127
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,800
I don't mind if I do.

128
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,000
I see you've met my niece.

129
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:38,000
So this is the hotshot reporter
you talk about all the time?

130
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,767
Sounds about right.

131
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,133
The part about Joe talking
too much, at least.

132
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:44,867
His baking makes up for it.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,967
Well, you got that right.
I'm Melanie Abrams.

134
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,500
Jake Collins.

135
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:52,600
I'm just a sucker
who lost a bet.

136
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:55,200
A bet? You lose every one.

137
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,000
No, no, no, Jake and I,
we get together

138
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,200
from time to time
and watch the games.

139
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,734
Friendly wagers.

140
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:05,200
Well, it looks like he pays you
your winnings in baked goods.

141
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,867
I ain't complaining.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,667
Dad! Can we play
that bottle toss game?

143
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,734
I bet I can beat you.

144
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:12,734
You're on.

145
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:14,433
It was nice meeting you.

146
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,700
Likewise.

147
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:16,934
We on tomorrow, Joe?

148
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:20,333
You know it. And I feel
like my luck is taking a turn.

149
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:21,200
You'll see.

150
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,867
Famous last words!

151
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,900
Quite the bromance you two have.

152
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,233
The way you described Jake,

153
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,667
I was expecting
someone, more mature.

154
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,600
Oh, hush up. You're not the
only one with cool friends.

155
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:40,700
Speaking of cool friends.

156
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:43,700
Hey Joe.
Hey.

157
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:47,367
I see you met Cherry
Springs' hottest bachelor.

158
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,467
What's his story?

159
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,200
Uh, moved here about a
year ago from New York.

160
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,867
Can't trust those
big city types.

161
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,033
He is a detective.

162
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,033
Don't know much
else other than he got

163
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,166
those new traffic cams
installed in town.

164
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,300
Bringing Cherry Springs
out of the Dark Ages.

165
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:06,467
Enjoy.

166
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,066
Mel! Hey!

167
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,233
Hey, Sarah.

168
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:11,600
Congrats on your big book deal.

169
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:13,667
Your uncle was telling
me all about it.

170
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,433
You got a book deal?

171
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,133
That Fall River factory piece

172
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:18,667
really made you a hot commodity.

173
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,633
More like a hot mess.
I haven't decided.

174
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,734
I'm not exactly in the right
headspace to write a book.

175
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:26,667
I should be congratulating you.

176
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
I heard you're gonna be parked
here full time at the center .

177
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:30,133
That's big business.

178
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:32,734
Thanks. I'm just working
on saving up money.

179
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:35,266
I'm trying to earn enough to
lease a space inside the center.

180
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,233
I am more than happy

181
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:38,633
to contribute to
that dream of yours.

182
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:39,567
Two lattes, please?

183
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,934
Coming right up.

184
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:45,300
Is that Detective Dominic?

185
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:46,800
Great speech up there.

186
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:48,166
Oh, thanks.

187
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,734
Hey, this is Melanie,
my childhood friend.

188
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:51,266
Mel, this is Dominic.

189
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,600
Or should I say
Detective Peters?

190
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:54,600
Heard about the promotion!

191
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,900
Thank you very much.

192
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:56,467
Nice to meet you, Melanie.

193
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,567
Likewise.

194
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,467
Here you go!

195
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,767
Oh, thank you!
Thank you!

196
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,367
Enjoy the day, ladies.

197
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,133
You, too!
Bye.

198
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:06,533
So cute.

199
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:11,133
Okay. Why are you
denying your fans a book?

200
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:12,233
Over a decade
of righting wrongs.

201
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:14,066
The spotlight suits you.

202
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,734
For every fan I've made,
I've made enemies, too.

203
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:18,967
Trust me.

204
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,300
Okay, well, if anyone tries
anything, I got your back.

205
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:24,967
Oh, I bet you do.
I've seen those biceps of yours.

206
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,800
Mom strength, it's no joke.

207
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,300
I'm the one taking care of her,
of course that's what she wants.

208
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:29,200
You asked her?

209
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,066
Yes.

210
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,533
What's that?

211
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,200
Tony, I'm exhausted.
I don't know what else to do.

212
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,500
Okay, It's our mother
we're talking about here!

213
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:37,333
The burden has been on me

214
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:38,533
so don't pretend like
you suddenly care!

215
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:39,567
C'mon.

216
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,567
I have customers,
I don't have time for this.

217
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,633
Hey Melanie!

218
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:52,200
I'm so glad you could
stick around for the event.

219
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,700
Oh, I couldn't miss it.

220
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:56,367
The center's such a beautiful
tribute to your wife.

221
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,467
Her journalism class
was an inspiration.

222
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,533
I owe her my career.

223
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,233
Twila taught a lot of
students over the years,

224
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:05,033
but you were always
her favorite.

225
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,700
Here I thought
I was her favorite.

226
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,133
No, you were a troublemaker.

227
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,500
Rachel, too.

228
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:10,900
A matter a fact,
the three of you together

229
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:12,200
were always up to no good.

230
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,233
Guilty as charged.

231
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,333
Only thing we're guilty
of is having a good time.

232
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:18,900
I requested our song!
Let's dance.

233
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:21,000
I will dance circles around you.

234
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:23,166
Wait. Who's watching my kids?

235
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,567
Ah no worries!
Uncle Joe's got 'em.

236
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:28,033
Bye!

237
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,500
Do you regret looking
into the Fall River factory?

238
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:48,400
What going to
happen to all those

239
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,000
workers who lost their jobs?

240
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:52,000
You got justice
but at what cost.

241
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,967
Knock, knock.

242
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:18,533
I got keys, remember?

243
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:21,133
Yes.
I brought you, uh, leftovers.

244
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:23,633
Oh! Thank you.
Come on.

245
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,200
Oh, you dancing up
a storm out there

246
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,266
with Diana and Rachel today.

247
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,200
You know, it was like
you never left at all.

248
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,100
Maybe I never should've,

249
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:36,066
I could've been
here with Mom more.

250
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,300
Making memories
instead of mistakes.

251
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:43,033
Your mom loved you
more than anybody.

252
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,967
She framed every one of
those articles you ever wrote.

253
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,633
I got no wall space
at the diner.

254
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,300
Well, not every
one of those stories

255
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:53,300
has a happy ending, Uncle Joe.

256
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:55,967
There's something you
wanna tell me about it?

257
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,900
It's nothing.

258
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:06,367
Look, I'm no fancy investigative
reporter but it doesn't take

259
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,367
Sherlock to figure that
something is not quite right.

260
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,433
One, you're in no rush
to sell this place.

261
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,633
Two, hardly packed any
your Mom's stuff

262
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,633
and three, every time I see you,

263
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,300
you're ignoring a phone call

264
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,166
from the publishing company.

265
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,867
The last thing I need is more
pressure and more deadlines.

266
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,100
I'm fine. I promise.
Just tired is all.

267
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:33,700
Okay, if you ever need
to talk about anything,

268
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:35,133
I'm right across the street.

269
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,467
Hey there, Boston!

270
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,700
Bogie!

271
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,767
Bogie, is that your buddy?

272
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,433
Game day at my uncle's,
I take it?

273
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:51,633
That's right.

274
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,467
Any excuse for grown men to eat

275
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,867
fried food and
take turns napping.

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,800
Sounds like my kinda Sunday.

277
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:01,033
Uncle Joe tells
me you're selling.

278
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,934
No bites yet.

279
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:05,166
I think Uncle Joe mowing
the lawn shirtless

280
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,834
across the street
scares folks off.

281
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:10,166
You know, if I could arrest
him for that, I would.

282
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,734
I think he's just trying
to make you stick around.

283
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,066
Well, he doesn't need me.

284
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,533
He's got his sports buddy now.

285
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,667
If Lucas had it his way
we'd still be in New York.

286
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,233
What brings you out here?

287
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,834
Not often a
high-ranking detective

288
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,867
relocates across four states.

289
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,400
Who said I was high-ranking.

290
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:28,934
You carry yourself
like someone who's a bit

291
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:30,600
above the average
inspector rank.

292
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:33,700
I'd say... sergeant?

293
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:38,266
Wow. I see those investigative
skills at work, huh.

294
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,367
Is that why they pay you
the big bucks in Boston?

295
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:45,300
Lucas, come on, man.
Game's about to start.

296
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:52,500
You didn't answer my question.
Why Cherry Springs?

297
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:53,700
Oh, I don't know.

298
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:58,233
It just seemed like a good
place to plant some roots,

299
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:00,100
when New York stopped
feeling like home.

300
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:06,166
You ready man.

301
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,834
Hello. Hello.
Guess who's here?

302
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:16,166
I come bearing gifts.

303
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:19,500
Is that Melanie Abrams I hear?

304
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:22,000
Andy! Long time no see.

305
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,467
Hey, come around here.
Way too long, if you ask me.

306
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,667
Haven't seen you
since our class reunion.

307
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,467
I'm surprised you
remember that night.

308
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,300
We actually had
to carry you out of there.

309
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,400
What can I say,
I drank Tony under the table.

310
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:35,133
Then wound up right under
that table with him.

311
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:38,934
Speaking of, Um, Tony around?

312
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:40,233
Oh, yeah, he's in the office.

313
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:41,300
How you been, huh?

314
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:43,433
I'm doing alright.

315
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:46,000
I was real sorry to hear
about your Ma passing.

316
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:49,266
Thank you. Yeah it's been
a hard year without her.

317
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,734
She was a great lady.

318
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:52,266
And those kitchen sink cookies

319
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,467
she used to make for us,
the best.

320
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,734
They were!

321
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,934
And I hear you're
selling the house, huh?

322
00:14:58,066 --> 00:14:59,200
Working on it.

323
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,000
Gosh, a lot of great memories
growing up on that street.

324
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:05,200
We had some epic rounds
of flash light tag.

325
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,033
All those neighborhood
bike races.

326
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,166
You call those races?

327
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,467
I was just trying to keep
away from you and Rachel.

328
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,500
Well, you went from
running from the ladies

329
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,500
to running your own business.

330
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:18,900
It's a team effort. Couldn't do
it without my partner in crime.

331
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:21,500
What you got in the bag there?

332
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:23,033
Oh, just some food for Tony.

333
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,367
I owe him for
loaning me the car.

334
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
You're acting so weird.
Look at me.

335
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:27,967
And tell me that you're
not hiding something.

336
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,233
Is that Rachel?

337
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:30,967
Okay, you're lying.
You're lying.

338
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,834
Hey, everything okay?

339
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:35,800
Yeah, fine.
I gotta get some air.

340
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,166
I'll catch you later, Mel.

341
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:49,066
Rachel was really upset.

342
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,400
She said Tony's being evasive

343
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,200
about phone calls
he's been getting.

344
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,467
Anytime she asks,
they wind up in a fight.

345
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,033
Well, they have been bickering
since they were prom dates.

346
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,467
I wouldn't think
too much about it.

347
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,233
Yeah, I guess.

348
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:03,367
But Tony kinda seems on edge.

349
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,433
You saw him arguing
with his sister yesterday.

350
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,700
Yeah, well he's a hothead.
You know Tony.

351
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,600
To-go order is ready.

352
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:12,100
Thanks, Joe.

353
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:13,233
I had a hankering
for your onion rings

354
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:15,367
and I just couldn't shake it.

355
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,200
Well hey, I even threw
in a couple of milkshakes

356
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,100
for those two little
cutie-patooties of yours.

357
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:22,734
Oh, you think they're cute, huh?

358
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:24,767
One sip of this and they'll
be shrieking like banshees.

359
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,900
Easy, easy. It's me.

360
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:58,400
Sorry, I tried calling, but...

361
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,834
Yeah, I went for a jog,
left my cell at home.

362
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,200
Everything okay?

363
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,967
Tony never came home last night.

364
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,367
What?

365
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,533
After we fought,

366
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,133
I figured he was at a bar,
blowing off some steam.

367
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:11,533
But, then I woke up this
morning and he wasn't there.

368
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,767
I tried calling him,
but his phone is shut off.

369
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,667
So I called the police.

370
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,533
Is that unusual for him?

371
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:20,300
Well, he's been acting
strange lately, in general.

372
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:24,200
Closed off.
But disappearing on me?

373
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,700
It isn't like him.
I can feel it in my bones.

374
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:28,667
Something's wrong.

375
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,867
Okay.

376
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,667
C'mon. You gotta see this thing.

377
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Slow down, dude.

378
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,333
There it is.

379
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,333
I don't think we
should go near it.

380
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:49,100
Whoever this belongs to
will probably come back.

381
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:50,900
Don't be chicken, bro.

382
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,066
Sick!

383
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,367
It's a roll of cash, dude.

384
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,333
Whoa. How much is that?

385
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:10,033
A whole lot.

386
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,166
since he left work yesterday.

387
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,333
Do you have the
Find-a-Friend app?

388
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:25,600
It can ping his location.

389
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,433
His phone must be dead.
It's not getting a response.

390
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:34,433
We can check in with Sarah Jane
at her coffee truck. Or his mom.

391
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,100
His mother.
She's been sick lately.

392
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:37,266
He could be with her.

393
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,767
This is why I needed you.
You help me think straight.

394
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:50,867
What do we got?

395
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,700
A jogger found the car abandoned
out here on a morning run.

396
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:55,767
Registered to one, Tony Patel.

397
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,667
He owns the auto repair
shop on Railroad Avenue.

398
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,166
Yeah. I know him.

399
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,133
He gave me a good
deal on a alternator.

400
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,767
Yeah, well, wherever he was
headed, he was in a hurry.

401
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,266
His tire is blown out and
there's skid marks on the road.

402
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:09,800
Huh, no sign of him?

403
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:12,500
No, no, just his cell phone,
found it in the woods.

404
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,900
It's a little water damaged
but should be okay.

405
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:16,800
Have your guys run
it for calls and texts.

406
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:17,800
And let's set up a perimeter.

407
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:19,367
Will do.
Yeah.

408
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:25,066
Did you find him?
Did you find Tony?

409
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,433
This is not a
good time for press.

410
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,300
There's no scoop if we
haven't started digging.

411
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,800
I'm not here on the job.

412
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:31,300
Rachel is Tony's wife.

413
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:32,500
He's missing.

414
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:33,767
I see.

415
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,000
We're going to get
to the bottom of this.

416
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,000
Any leads on his whereabouts?

417
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:38,500
Not as of yet.

418
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:40,834
But as soon as we know
anything, I'll let you know.

419
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:43,033
Ok, thanks.
Alright.

420
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,600
You know Tony
better than they do.

421
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:52,400
If he's out there somewhere,
you've gotta help me find him.

422
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:53,500
Please.

423
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,066
When's the last
time you saw Tony?

424
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,967
Eleven in the morning, I'd say.
Maybe eleven-thirty.

425
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,066
So Tony left the auto shop
and never came back.

426
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,300
That didn't raise any red flags?

427
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:08,233
No, not at all.

428
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:10,100
Tony opens the shop.
I shut it down.

429
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:11,100
That's how it goes.

430
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:13,500
Any idea where Tony was off to?

431
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:18,400
He didn't say. He was in a huff.

432
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:21,000
He and his wife had just
gotten into a little spat.

433
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:24,400
And Rachel?
She was at the shop?

434
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:27,000
Tony was being secretive lately.

435
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:29,100
Taking phone calls
in other rooms.

436
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:31,400
Giving two-word
responses anytime

437
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,300
I'd ask him what was going on.

438
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:37,433
I'd reached a breaking point,
I guess.

439
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:40,600
And he was having one of
those secret calls yesterday?

440
00:20:40,734 --> 00:20:43,400
It was a text, actually.

441
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,266
Ryan Monroe,
Tony's employee at the shop.

442
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,500
Yeah, I was out towing a car
to bring back for repair.

443
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:50,834
It was the first time
Tony let me go out alone.

444
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,233
Kinda messed it up, though.

445
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,500
Couldn't get the cables
to work quite right.

446
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:57,400
So, you text Tony to help?

447
00:20:57,533 --> 00:21:00,734
Yeah, he came out and
got the rig going again.

448
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:03,734
I towed the car back to
the shop and that was that.

449
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:07,967
That's right. Ryan got back to
the shop around 4PM or so,

450
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,066
towing a broken down car.

451
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,100
Alone?

452
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:12,800
Yeah. That's right.
He finished his work,

453
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:13,967
so I sent him home for the day,

454
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,633
and caught up on paperwork.

455
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:18,300
And Rachel?
Where was she?

456
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:22,033
I was home. All night.

457
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,400
Tony never came back.

458
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,800
I thought maybe he went
to get a drink, but,

459
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:29,834
I talked to Harry
at The Taproom.

460
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,867
Tony never showed up.

461
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,767
The last time I saw him
we had that stupid argument.

462
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,133
That's all for today,
Mrs. Patel.

463
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:44,367
We'll keep you up to date on
anything we find out, alright.

464
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,900
Okay.
Thank you for your time.

465
00:21:46,033 --> 00:21:47,100
Thank you.
Alright.

466
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:59,867
Melanie Abrams, seems your
a tough person to chase down.

467
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:01,767
You're the one who's
been following me?

468
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,367
The van?
Not me.

469
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,567
I've only emailed
and called before now.

470
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,233
I'm Robin Carole,
from Pecanole Publishing.

471
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:10,233
Wanted to chat
about that book deal.

472
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:11,867
Right, right, sorry.

473
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,734
I'm just, a little on edge.

474
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:15,567
Come on in.

475
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:19,300
Lot of buzz about you.

476
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:20,533
You've proven to have
quite the keen eye

477
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,066
during your time
at the Chronicle.

478
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,533
Buzz isn't always a good thing.

479
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,400
Been a fan for years.

480
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:27,433
I appreciate your kind words,

481
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:31,066
but I'm not sure I have
any hot gossip for you.

482
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,400
I've taken a leave of
absence from the Chronicle

483
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:37,433
and it's company policy that
I never reveal my source.

484
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:39,200
Oh, I'm not asking you to.

485
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,100
I just want to hear
your version of what happened

486
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:43,266
at that factory
in Massachusetts.

487
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,600
I'm sorry,
I'm just not interested.

488
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:47,433
I'm sorry to hear that.

489
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,100
You have my info,
if you change your mind.

490
00:22:58,066 --> 00:23:00,133
Something's been
weighing on me all day.

491
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:01,600
I should've told
you last night,

492
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:04,533
but I, I didn't think
it's any of my business.

493
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:07,800
But now, Tony's M.I.A.
And I...

494
00:23:07,934 --> 00:23:10,533
It's okay. Talk to me.

495
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:11,800
I saw Tony with another woman.

496
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:15,033
Wait. What?

497
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,767
I was driving through
town square a few weeks ago.

498
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,834
This driver was too busy making
eyes with his passenger to

499
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,934
notice that the
light had turned red.

500
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:24,000
Just drove straight through it.

501
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:25,133
Almost hit me.

502
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:29,700
And then I saw, it was Tony.

503
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:32,367
And a woman in
his passenger seat

504
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,433
that was definitely not Rachel.

505
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:37,000
Are you sure it was him?

506
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:39,467
It was him.
Yeah I didn't tell Rachel yet.

507
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,800
But I know what I saw.

508
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,934
Okay, you should
go to the police.

509
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:47,967
Thought we could go together?

510
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,433
I don't know if I should be
getting wrapped up in this.

511
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:55,400
Okay, it's your call.
But, you in or out?

512
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,867
So, you recognized Tony,
but not the woman?

513
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,767
Yeah, I, I just know
is it wasn't Rachel.

514
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,400
And Rachel. Does she...

515
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:05,200
Haven't told her.

516
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,633
Figured we'd come to you first.

517
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:10,667
Hey, what if they faked

518
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,033
Tony's disappearance
and they ran off together?

519
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,834
You watch too much Crime TV.

520
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:18,166
Fair point.

521
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,400
I do do a lot of
late night binging.

522
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:23,700
Diana remembers seeing them
the week of the Fifteenth.

523
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:26,600
She also mentioned to me,
that you're responsible for

524
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:28,500
helping install
traffic cams in town.

525
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,667
That's right.

526
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,567
Well, I figured if we
can use traffic cam footage

527
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,667
to narrow down our
search window and find her.

528
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,333
I'm sorry. uh, we?

529
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:39,100
I'll take a look at
the traffic cam footage.

530
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:41,233
Thanks for the heads up.

531
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:46,367
So, that's it?

532
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,700
I'm sorry I thought
we were going to maybe,

533
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,400
check out the footage.

534
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:50,767
You know, crack the case.
Save the day.

535
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,734
Too much Crime TV. Copy that.

536
00:24:55,867 --> 00:25:01,000
Look, I know you two are friends
with Rachel and you mean well,

537
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,834
but I have this covered.
Okay?

538
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:07,467
Uh, well, okay.
Okay.

539
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,767
Good night.
Good night.

540
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,600
Come on.

541
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:11,500
Alright. You welcome.

542
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:13,266
Bye bye!

543
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,667
Hey, so I pulled the calendar
off Tony's phone like you asked.

544
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,767
We got lucky,
the S-D card was fine.

545
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,800
I made a list of his whereabouts

546
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:24,400
in the days leading
up to his disappearance.

547
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,567
And it looks like he trains
with a personal trainer

548
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,834
at Spring's boxing
every Thursday at 3.

549
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,800
I just need a
minute of your time.

550
00:25:31,934 --> 00:25:33,333
Look, you're not a client here.

551
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:35,066
So, I can't help you out.

552
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,767
Please. This is important.

553
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,433
Your 10AM
just called in sick.

554
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:40,600
I'll take it.

555
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:41,900
You'll what?

556
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:43,300
You heard me.

557
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:45,500
I'm just a client in
need of some training.

558
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:48,934
Hey, Dom!
Come take a look at this.

559
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,066
Managed to track down that
traffic cam footage of Tony.

560
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,266
Well those two
certainly look cozy.

561
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
You don't recognize her?

562
00:25:57,533 --> 00:26:00,500
No, but, uh, could be
she's not from around here.

563
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:01,967
I could look into it.

564
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,233
Wherever she's is,

565
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:04,800
Tony could be there
right there beside her.

566
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:06,834
And I aim to find out.

567
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,033
Seeing as I don't
require much training,

568
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:24,166
maybe you could use the time
to tell me about Tony Patel?

569
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,767
You don't quit!
Look, Tony boxed here.

570
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,600
He started showing up late,

571
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:31,734
and then he stopped
showing up about a month ago.

572
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,367
Any idea why?

573
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,667
Don't know,
he paid for all his sessions,

574
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,367
so I didn't ask any questions.

575
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:40,700
You gotta be kidding me.

576
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:42,367
Oh. Hi, there.

577
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,266
Why are you here?

578
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,367
Training sesh. Too fit to quit.

579
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,367
So you just happened
to be at this gym?

580
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,667
Small town.

581
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,266
Not exactly
gym-appropriate attire.

582
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,867
You know why I'm here.

583
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,667
Lats? Quads? Oh! Is it leg day?

584
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
By the way,

585
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:00,567
I was having a little
chat with my trainer, Jim.

586
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,066
It's Reuben.

587
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,133
Yeah, he was
telling me that Tony

588
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:05,433
stopped coming
about a month ago.

589
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:09,166
Okay, so where was he on
Thursdays from 3 to 4pm then?

590
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,800
Somewhere he felt
the need to lie about.

591
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:14,633
Would he happen to have
a locker here, by chance?

592
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,567
And who are you?
I don't see a...

593
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,934
Badge, okay. Never mind.
That's a badge.

594
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:22,934
Follow me.

595
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:27,133
Any luck with that
traffic cam footage?

596
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:30,066
Seeing as you
clearly have a habit

597
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,333
of eavesdropping
on police matters,

598
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:33,300
I'm gonna go with
"no comment."

599
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:34,500
Oh, come on.

600
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:35,834
You didn't even have
to break a sweat.

601
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:37,834
I saved you time here.

602
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:40,133
I find you mentally exhausting.

603
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:41,667
Does that count as a workout?

604
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,233
I get it.

605
00:27:43,367 --> 00:27:45,667
All my brilliant
ideas blowing your mind.

606
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Hard to keep up.

607
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:49,166
Something like that.

608
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:51,767
There you go, all yours.

609
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,033
Thank you.

610
00:27:56,066 --> 00:28:00,200
Try the side pocket.

611
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:03,567
Preferably stuffing trash into,
particular random receipts.

612
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,967
Oh, okay.

613
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,900
Oh, here's one uh, for

614
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:10,867
Thursday, March 11th at 3PM.

615
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,166
Right around the time he's

616
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,233
usually here for
his weekly session.

617
00:28:14,367 --> 00:28:17,166
Looks like he was at a place
called Smoothie Criminal.

618
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,000
That's a juice place in town.

619
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:20,000
Terrible name.

620
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:21,467
Great juice, though.

621
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,166
I could really use
one right about now.

622
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
I'm not gonna get
rid of you, am I?

623
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:34,800
Good afternoon,
I'm Detective Jake Collins

624
00:28:34,934 --> 00:28:36,567
from the Cherry Springs
Police Department.

625
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,300
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

626
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:39,734
Happy to help, detectives.

627
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:40,867
Oh, she's not a detective.

628
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,066
Right. Just a customer.

629
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,500
You know, my friend Tony
recommended this place to me.

630
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:45,800
Do you know him?

631
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:49,233
Oh, yeah. Tony? Sweet guy.

632
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:51,500
Great tipper.
Came here like clockwork.

633
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:53,000
Did he seem out of sorts?

634
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,533
You know,
he did seem kinda sad lately.

635
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:56,800
Sad.

636
00:28:56,934 --> 00:29:01,100
Do you recognize this woman
here in the photo with Tony?

637
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:03,066
So you did get that
traffic cam footage.

638
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,800
I got that info for him.
We're kind of a team.

639
00:29:05,934 --> 00:29:09,533
Yeah actually, She and Tony,
they'd come in at the same time.

640
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:10,900
And sometimes
they'd leave together.

641
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:12,633
So you have security cameras?

642
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:14,633
Yeah. The whole block,

643
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:17,700
so dentist office,
bookstore, coffee shop,

644
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:19,066
they're all on the same system.

645
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,800
Can you point us toward
the security office?

646
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:22,000
Yeah, absolutely.

647
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:26,467
What she means is can you
point ME to the security office.

648
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,934
Sure, it'll be on your right
at the end of the block.

649
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:29,600
End of the block?
Yup.

650
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:30,967
Thank you.

651
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,567
Hey, you don't
want to forget this.

652
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,133
Thanks.

653
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,567
You mentioned there was
a bookstore on the block?

654
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,233
Yup, it's right over there.

655
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:41,266
Thanks.

656
00:29:55,567 --> 00:29:57,100
Bingo.

657
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,967
Thank you so much, officer.

658
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,066
That's right. Tony Patel.

659
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,133
Praying we can find him.
Okay. Bye.

660
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:10,066
Excuse me.

661
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,767
Sorry. Didn't mean to eavesdrop.

662
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,633
Did you say
Tony Patel is missing?

663
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:17,934
Do you know him?

664
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,967
We, uh, we're friends.

665
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,767
My name is Melanie.

666
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,300
I'm Emily.

667
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:26,400
I've been friends with
Tony and his wife Rachel

668
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,100
since we were kids.

669
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:29,600
Do you know Rachel?

670
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:31,633
Afraid I don't.

671
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:34,066
Oh, she's really worried.
We all are.

672
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,133
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

673
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:40,934
I'm sorry, detective.

674
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:42,934
But I can't give you
access to that footage

675
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:44,533
without a search warrant.

676
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:46,567
You gotta be kidding me.

677
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,367
When you two saw each other,
what did you chat about?

678
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,967
It's... kinda private actually.

679
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,867
Any information you have
could help me track him down.

680
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,767
Melanie, what do
you think you're doing?

681
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,266
Ah! Detective Collins.

682
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,700
Emily here is a
friend of Tony's.

683
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:03,867
Yeah, makes sense.

684
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,867
From the looks of things,
you two were, pretty close.

685
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,300
He wanted me to keep
things between us.

686
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:14,100
So, there was
something between you?

687
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:17,500
I just mean he wanted
me to keep things quiet.

688
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:19,834
About his diagnosis.

689
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:24,600
Tony, he has pancreatic cancer.

690
00:31:24,734 --> 00:31:26,967
He didn't want anyone to know.

691
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,166
I feel bad saying anything.

692
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,633
Our support group urged
him to tell his family.

693
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,533
Especially his wife.

694
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:36,867
I see how that photo looks.

695
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,433
I get it.

696
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:41,767
But Tony was just
giving me a ride home.

697
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,100
I'd gotten some
bad news that day.

698
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:48,834
I was in remission and
found out my cancer was back.

699
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:50,300
I'm sorry to hear that.

700
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:53,500
I needed a friend. Nothing more.

701
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:59,633
Was there anything else weighing
on Tony, besides his diagnosis?

702
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:04,433
Financial security for Rachel,
in case anything happened.

703
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:09,500
But a few weeks ago
he seemed in a better mood.

704
00:32:09,633 --> 00:32:12,033
Said he figured something out.

705
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,333
How did you know to find
her in that book store?

706
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:18,633
She could've been anywhere.

707
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:22,867
In the traffic cam photo there
was a book on the dashboard.

708
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,834
The only books Tony ever
reads is the sports section.

709
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:29,033
Smoothie gal mentioned a
bookstore in the building.

710
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,333
Took a shot.

711
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:31,500
Heck of a shot.

712
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:33,233
Kind of like the snapshot you

713
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:36,166
illegally took
of police evidence.

714
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,000
I found Emily
because I know Tony.

715
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:41,667
And because I'm good at this.

716
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,767
Admit it. You could use my help.

717
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,100
I certainly could use
your help at the next stop.

718
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:48,266
Yeah? Where's that?

719
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,934
To see your friend Rachel.

720
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:02,633
How could he not
tell me he was sick?

721
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:04,233
Well, you know Tony.

722
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:07,600
He could break a leg and
he'd try to walk it off.

723
00:33:07,734 --> 00:33:09,400
He didn't want to worry you.

724
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:13,066
I wonder if Sarah Jane and his
mother know about his cancer.

725
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,266
Emily said he
didn't tell anyone.

726
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:19,667
So, that's it then?

727
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,133
He was sick and
decided to call it quits.

728
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,066
No goodbye letter. Just goodbye.

729
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,333
He could still be out there.

730
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:27,734
That's right.
You can't lose hope.

731
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:30,967
I'm gonna do everything in
my power to track Tony down.

732
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,900
And you got a good friend
here looking out for you.

733
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:36,800
I could use some company.

734
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:39,500
The house feels so
empty without Tony there.

735
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:43,000
How about I invite
Diana to stay over, too?

736
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:44,500
Like old times?

737
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:46,000
Sounds nice.

738
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,300
I know.

739
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:55,734
Okay, I'm going to make popcorn
and we can put on a movie and...

740
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,767
Sounds good.

741
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:03,700
Go outside. Both of you.
Call the police.

742
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,000
You sure?
Just go. Go.

743
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:15,533
Who's there?

744
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,834
None of my jewelry is missing

745
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,834
and all of our
electronics are still here.

746
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:32,967
What were they looking for?

747
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,667
Looks like the perp cut
themselves on the way in.

748
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,867
I'll have it tested.

749
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,333
And see if
they're in the system.

750
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:42,400
Can I talk to you for a sec?

751
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:43,734
Sure.

752
00:34:43,867 --> 00:34:46,066
Excuse us.
Yeah. Let's go.

753
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:51,867
Okay, this is
totally just a hunch.

754
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,533
Not the best way to start.

755
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:54,767
Just hear me out.

756
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,400
Tony told his friend Emily
that he'd figured out how to

757
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:00,200
take care of Rachel in
case the worst happened.

758
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:01,400
That's right.

759
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:04,400
Maybe whatever this perp
was looking for is the reason

760
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:06,533
Tony suddenly solved
his money problems.

761
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:11,567
So, what, you think Tony
had something valuable here?

762
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,600
And maybe someone was desperate
to get whatever it was back.

763
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:18,300
Hey Jake, someone called
the station asking for you.

764
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:19,967
Got a tip from a guy
who said his son found

765
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,734
something in Tony
Patel's abandoned car.

766
00:35:23,734 --> 00:35:26,600
I was with my friend,
near the road by Spring Woods

767
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:28,633
and we saw a car
just like out there,

768
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:30,133
just left there, something.

769
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:32,900
Why didn't you report it?

770
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:36,700
I don't know.

771
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,734
Alright, go on.
Give him what you took.

772
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:53,500
Oh, Mm mm,
let's see what we got here.

773
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,133
Nine... Nineteen hundred.

774
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:07,700
Something weird about
that number to you?

775
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:09,033
What are you my math teacher?

776
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,033
Hey!

777
00:36:13,734 --> 00:36:15,133
You play ball?

778
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:17,500
Starting guard for the
Cherry Springs Bulldogs.

779
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,500
Okay. Alright.

780
00:36:19,633 --> 00:36:22,533
Bulldogs, you guys got
a game tonight, right?

781
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,433
Man, it'd be a shame
if you had to miss it,

782
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:27,266
I mean if I had to call
you back in for questioning.

783
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,233
Don't look at me.
I'm on his side.

784
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:39,166
Hey, two thousand.

785
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,934
Whelp, uh, thank you,
appreciate it.

786
00:36:44,066 --> 00:36:45,000
Thank you, officer.

787
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,633
Alright, who am I looking at?

788
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:49,266
That would be William Dixon.

789
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,633
The man who robbed
Rachel's house.

790
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:53,166
Um, not bad, Dom.

791
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,800
Breaking records
with that speed.

792
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,100
How'd you manage that?

793
00:36:56,233 --> 00:36:58,300
Gotta love vigilant neighbors
and those doorbell cameras.

794
00:36:58,433 --> 00:36:59,467
I got a good shot
of this guy breaking in

795
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,066
and was able to match him
to a mugshot in our system.

796
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,767
Pretty hefty rap sheet, too.

797
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,033
Our boys are trying
to locate him now.

798
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:08,166
Hmm, well, good work.

799
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,066
What do you got there?

800
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,934
Those kids found
that in Tony's car.

801
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,200
Think it could be some of that

802
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,000
mystery money Tony
suddenly came into?

803
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:20,433
Not sure. Tony's got priors,
but from years ago.

804
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:23,200
Maybe worth a check in
with our friends in vice.

805
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:23,934
You know see if
there are any busts

806
00:37:24,066 --> 00:37:25,233
with bills that are a match.

807
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:26,166
Can I tag along?

808
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,233
Sure thing.

809
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,033
Why? He's lawyered up
and isn't talking.

810
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,266
Yup.

811
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,834
But I got something.

812
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:36,233
Turns out this guy attended a

813
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:37,700
Reform school
for troubled youth.

814
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:39,700
You wanna know
who else attended?

815
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,500
Ryan Monroe.

816
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:44,767
Tony's employee
at the repair shop?

817
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,700
That's the one.

818
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:47,867
You want to know what else?

819
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,533
Ryan has a Juvenile record.

820
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:52,734
Then it's sealed.

821
00:37:52,867 --> 00:37:54,600
Ryan doesn't know that.

822
00:37:55,834 --> 00:37:58,066
You know the man in this photo?

823
00:38:02,133 --> 00:38:04,333
Sorta. Billy went to my school,

824
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:07,333
but we weren't
friends or anything.

825
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:10,166
Any idea what he was
looking for at Rachel's?

826
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:13,033
How should I know?

827
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:19,133
We booked Mr. Dixon on
breaking and entering.

828
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:20,767
He's not the only one.

829
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,567
Yeah, I got a record. So what?

830
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,500
He stole some parts from
the shop a few years ago.

831
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:27,934
He was just a kid.

832
00:38:28,066 --> 00:38:30,567
So, you took car parts
from your employers?

833
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,133
Yeah and Tony stole an
entire car when he was my age,

834
00:38:34,266 --> 00:38:35,400
and he didn't end up a criminal!

835
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,667
He stole those parts before
he was ever working for us.

836
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,900
Why'd you hire him?

837
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:41,000
Cause they're good guys
who do nice things for people.

838
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:42,800
Tony arranged with
the court so that

839
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:44,700
Ryan could work here as
part of his probation.

840
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:49,266
So, you didn't want to be here?

841
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,967
Maybe not at first...
But I do now.

842
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,900
So Tony and Andy
don't press charges

843
00:38:59,033 --> 00:39:00,800
and you end up working for them.

844
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:02,400
Is that right?

845
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:04,700
These guys saved my life.

846
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:08,233
These guys gave me a shot
when no one could care less.

847
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:09,900
He's come a long way.

848
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:12,033
So, you had nothing to do with

849
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:16,967
the break in at Rachel's
or Tony's disappearance?

850
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,367
I swear.

851
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,934
You swear?

852
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,300
Hey!

853
00:39:58,433 --> 00:40:00,834
Look, I know you're
on this whole

854
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:02,834
"teamwork makes the
dream work" kick.

855
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,166
But we had an agreement
if I find something

856
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,467
I will come to you.

857
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,066
That's not why I'm here.

858
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,000
Okay, I think
someone's following me.

859
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:13,834
You see there.

860
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:23,800
These plates are false.

861
00:40:23,934 --> 00:40:26,233
You said a van
was following you.

862
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:29,033
Are you into
some sort of trouble?

863
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:31,900
I've definitely made some
enemies over the years.

864
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:33,133
That's for sure.

865
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:35,300
The Fall River factory,
you mean?

866
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,500
I never said that.

867
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:38,700
I'm a detective.

868
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:39,967
You piqued my interest.

869
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,800
So, I did some digging.

870
00:40:41,934 --> 00:40:43,967
Internet stalker, huh?

871
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,033
Curious as to why an
award-winning journalist

872
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:49,734
at the peak of her career
suddenly call it quits.

873
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:53,734
It was less of a peak and more
of a cliff. Went over the edge.

874
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:57,133
So Cherry Springs
is the bottom, then?

875
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:59,500
If being on the bottom
means being under the radar,

876
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:00,467
then so be it.

877
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,800
Look, if you're in some trouble
I can look into things further.

878
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:06,433
No, no. It's fine.

879
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:07,333
Don't go worrying about me.

880
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,633
The focus should
be on finding Tony.

881
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,800
Alright.

882
00:41:11,934 --> 00:41:13,600
You let me know
if you change your mind,

883
00:41:13,734 --> 00:41:15,367
you know where to find me.

884
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,367
I thought I was supposed
to let you come to me?

885
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,567
I can bend some rules.

886
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,100
It's the perks
of being in charge.

887
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:23,967
Alright.

888
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,066
Fish don't bite,
the birds do sing.

889
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:01,166
Vice just got back to me.

890
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,266
Found a match on
that roll of bills

891
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,667
those kids found in that car.

892
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,700
That right?

893
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:07,200
Yeah, could very well
be dirty money tied

894
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:08,834
to that drug bust
about a month ago.

895
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:13,166
What did Tony get himself into?

896
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,166
Hey Uncle Joe, I'm
actually making some chilli...

897
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,934
Sorry to cut you off,
sweetheart.

898
00:42:23,066 --> 00:42:24,967
I've been with
the police all day.

899
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,000
I've got some bad news.

900
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:30,967
It's Tony. I found his body.

901
00:42:38,133 --> 00:42:39,767
Cause of death,
gunshot wound to the back.

902
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,200
No sign of the murder weapon.

903
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:44,834
So, whoever did it tossed
him into the river.

904
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:47,033
And now that we know Tony's
official time of death

905
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:51,266
was between 7 and 9PM,
it clears William Dixon.

906
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,767
The guy who broke
into Rachel's house?

907
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,667
He have an alibi?

908
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,133
It's solid.

909
00:42:55,266 --> 00:42:57,100
He was at the
River Rock Casino.

910
00:42:57,233 --> 00:42:59,600
They sent over their time
stamped security footage.

911
00:42:59,734 --> 00:43:01,367
Least we got him for the B&E.

912
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,033
Yeah, Dixon might
not have killed Tony,

913
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:06,367
but that break in and
Tony's murder are related,

914
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,900
we just got to figure out how.

915
00:43:11,867 --> 00:43:15,066
I wish I there was something
better to say than, "I'm sorry""

916
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:17,600
There are no right words.

917
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,900
You being here is enough.

918
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,667
I have to get
back to the station.

919
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,400
But if you need anything,
please don't hesitate to call.

920
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:30,934
Thank you, Jake.

921
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,100
You guys take
care of each other.

922
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,700
Hi, Jake.
Hi.

923
00:43:37,834 --> 00:43:40,066
Hi, sweetie.
Hey, I hope you don't mind.

924
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,066
I let myself in.
I made a lasagna.

925
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,100
Thirty pounds of
carbs just for you.

926
00:43:48,233 --> 00:43:49,533
Oh, honey.

927
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:51,033
Hey.

928
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,767
You okay?

929
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,834
As okay as I can be.

930
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:09,433
I keep checking my phone,

931
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:12,867
thinking any second Tony'll
text me some silly meme.

932
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,500
Thank you for
taking care of Rachel.

933
00:44:16,633 --> 00:44:18,233
She told me you've been putting

934
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:21,066
extra time at the
doggy day care, too.

935
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,100
Whatever we can do, right?

936
00:44:23,233 --> 00:44:25,667
Hey, where's Sarah Jane?

937
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,400
I called to tell
her we'd all be here.

938
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:32,266
Tony and his sister had been
on the outs the past few months.

939
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,767
Yeah, I heard them
arguing at the festival.

940
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,567
About their mother?
Yeah.

941
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,500
They had their hands
full taking care of her

942
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:41,100
and trying to run businesses.

943
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:42,934
That's definitely stressful.

944
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:44,600
I think they took
it out on each other.

945
00:44:44,734 --> 00:44:48,834
But I can't imagine
she'd ever hurt Tony.

946
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:51,967
No. I just wish she wasn't M-I-A
for Rachel during all of this.

947
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,133
No kidding.

948
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,500
Hey, Melanie.
What can I get you?

949
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:04,000
Well, we just missed you
at Rachel's earlier.

950
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:05,667
Just wanted to check on you.

951
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,367
I appreciate that.

952
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,533
I'm just trying to
focus on work because

953
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:11,633
if I dwell on it for
a second I'll break down.

954
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:12,667
I'm so sorry.

955
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,400
And Mom is a wreck.

956
00:45:14,533 --> 00:45:16,367
She's already got enough
health issues as it is.

957
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,066
Tony had told me she
was making some progress.

958
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,900
Not enough.

959
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:23,367
We need to sell Mom's house

960
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,967
and move her
into a nursing home.

961
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,500
But, Tony thought differently.

962
00:45:27,633 --> 00:45:29,333
I get it.

963
00:45:29,467 --> 00:45:31,967
I'm in the process of having
to sell my childhood home.

964
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,133
It's not easy. Lots of memories.

965
00:45:34,266 --> 00:45:36,000
True.

966
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:39,367
But you'll be amazed at what
real estate goes for these days.

967
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,333
You could sell for three times
what your parents paid for it.

968
00:45:42,467 --> 00:45:44,900
So now when you go to sell
your mother's the house,

969
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,433
the profit's all yours?

970
00:45:48,266 --> 00:45:50,700
I better get
back to my customers.

971
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,000
Hi!

972
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:58,367
So you said you were Tony
and Sarah Jane's cousin.

973
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,567
Yes.

974
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,300
I'm in for the funeral,

975
00:46:01,433 --> 00:46:04,467
thought I'd just drop
in and say hello to Aunt V.

976
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,533
Thanks for the tea.

977
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:06,800
Oh, it's no trouble.

978
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,934
Mrs. Patel should be
up from her nap soon.

979
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,767
It's terrible what
happened to Tony.

980
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,233
He was so sweet to his mother.

981
00:46:14,367 --> 00:46:16,133
He visited all the time.

982
00:46:16,266 --> 00:46:18,033
Yeah, Sarah Jane
actually mentioned

983
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:20,233
wanting to move
her to a nursing home.

984
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:21,633
I think that's the plan.

985
00:46:21,767 --> 00:46:24,900
Do you think she
needs to be moved?

986
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:28,133
In her current state, yes.

987
00:46:28,266 --> 00:46:29,633
But it's a shame.

988
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:30,967
If you'd asked me
a couple of weeks ago,

989
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,300
I'd say she was fine.

990
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:36,033
How strange.
A rapid decline, huh?

991
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:39,033
Like somebody flipped a switch.

992
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:41,700
Forgetting things,
extreme anger.

993
00:46:41,834 --> 00:46:44,367
I thought it could possibly be a
side effect of her medication.

994
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,233
Right.

995
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:48,200
Sarah Jane mentioned
a prescription

996
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:50,400
that was doing
wonders for Aunt V.

997
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:52,934
Oh what was it called,
something hard to pronounce.

998
00:46:53,066 --> 00:46:54,367
Memantine.

999
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,300
That's it! And you've
been keeping up with it?

1000
00:46:57,433 --> 00:46:59,967
Sarah Jane administers
all her meds.

1001
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:02,166
I'm just with Mrs. Patel
in the afternoons.

1002
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:16,367
Hi. I need to pick up my
Mom's Memantine prescription.

1003
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,967
Name is Vera Patel.
Date of birth is 4/23/50.

1004
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,500
Please verify the address.

1005
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,233
27 Fairdale Road.

1006
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:29,300
We called you to pick up
this prescription weeks ago.

1007
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:30,233
I'm sorry.

1008
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:32,266
Things have been
unusually hectic lately.

1009
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,333
It's very dangerous to stop
taking that medication abruptly.

1010
00:47:35,467 --> 00:47:38,266
Mom has been acting
differently lately.

1011
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,934
Are violent outbursts and
memory loss side effects?

1012
00:47:42,066 --> 00:47:43,333
Yes. It's very common with

1013
00:47:43,467 --> 00:47:45,367
Alzheimer's patients
stopping Memantine.

1014
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,967
I'll fill it for you now.

1015
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,066
Thank you.

1016
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,100
So you think Tony is
getting in the way

1017
00:48:01,233 --> 00:48:04,834
of Sarah Jane's
career aspirations?

1018
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:07,333
She wants to open a coffee
shop inside the Twila center.

1019
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,533
She told me herself.

1020
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:10,934
Selling her mom's house gives
her the money to fund it.

1021
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:15,400
I gotta say, this is good.

1022
00:48:15,533 --> 00:48:18,200
Never thought I'd
hear you say that.

1023
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:20,100
No, I mean your Uncle's fries.

1024
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:21,600
But yeah.
This is a solid lead.

1025
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:25,767
How's Rachel doing?

1026
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,600
She's keeping her head up.
I don't know how she does it.

1027
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,600
It ain't easy. That's for sure.

1028
00:48:34,734 --> 00:48:39,266
I'm gathering you know
from personal experience?

1029
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,867
Friend on the force
back in the Big Apple?

1030
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,467
My wife.

1031
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,200
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.

1032
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:49,300
No, no. It's fine. I mean...

1033
00:48:51,133 --> 00:48:53,033
We were assigned partners.

1034
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:56,233
Real competitive.

1035
00:48:56,367 --> 00:49:02,000
First I was hot on her heels,
then head over heels.

1036
00:49:02,133 --> 00:49:04,333
First came love,
then came Lucas.

1037
00:49:08,633 --> 00:49:11,300
New York is a city
that doesn't plays nice.

1038
00:49:11,433 --> 00:49:14,500
We knew what we were
doing was dangerous.

1039
00:49:14,633 --> 00:49:15,734
But we figured, you know, hey,

1040
00:49:15,867 --> 00:49:19,433
we'll move somewhere
safe for Lucas.

1041
00:49:19,567 --> 00:49:21,166
But before we could...

1042
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,633
Liquor store shootout and
a stray bullet caught her.

1043
00:49:30,066 --> 00:49:32,200
I'm so sorry, Jake.

1044
00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:37,767
You know after she died,
everywhere I looked,

1045
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,133
just reminded me of her.

1046
00:49:41,934 --> 00:49:43,300
So I figured you know, hey,

1047
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:47,433
come to a new new place.

1048
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:52,100
Well it doesn't get easier,
just different.

1049
00:49:52,233 --> 00:49:58,934
That's right. Look, I know
I've given you a hard time,

1050
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:02,400
and I'm sorry.
I just don't want to

1051
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:05,066
anyone else getting
hurt on my watch.

1052
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,166
I appreciate it,
but I can take care of myself.

1053
00:50:14,934 --> 00:50:16,867
You sound like Shae.

1054
00:50:20,734 --> 00:50:23,000
Okay, uh, let's press reset.

1055
00:50:25,967 --> 00:50:30,266
So, Whoever trashed
Rachel's house

1056
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,000
was looking for
something valuable.

1057
00:50:32,133 --> 00:50:35,633
Right. Something Tony
had to provide

1058
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:37,300
for Rachel after he died.

1059
00:50:37,433 --> 00:50:38,967
So, we've searched the house,
doggy daycare and Tony's car.

1060
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:47,633
we searched the auto shop,

1061
00:50:47,767 --> 00:50:49,266
What, what is it?

1062
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,166
I talked to this kid.

1063
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,166
He said he found
cash in Tony's car.

1064
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,367
I need to take another
look at that GTO.

1065
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,400
You can take that
to forensics, yeah.

1066
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:04,567
There's gotta be some
secret compartment,

1067
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:09,367
false bottom,
something we missed.

1068
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,000
Man, I'd love to drive
a car like this someday.

1069
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:14,000
Stick to the task at hand

1070
00:51:14,133 --> 00:51:15,600
and maybe you will,
young grasshopper.

1071
00:51:31,533 --> 00:51:33,000
Dom, come take a look at this.

1072
00:51:37,867 --> 00:51:39,900
Does the stitching on
the passenger seat look

1073
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:42,400
a different color than
on the driver's side?

1074
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:45,000
I mean, maybe slightly.

1075
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:46,233
But it's an old car.

1076
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:47,567
Sun might've faded it?

1077
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,734
Or because it's
a different thread,

1078
00:51:49,867 --> 00:51:52,066
because one of these
seats has been opened

1079
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,233
and stitched back up.

1080
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,700
Whoa!

1081
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:02,066
Would you look at that.

1082
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,467
What's he doing with
this kind of cash?

1083
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,800
My guess?

1084
00:52:06,934 --> 00:52:11,066
This is Tony's insurance plan
he had hidden away for his wife.

1085
00:52:20,834 --> 00:52:21,967
What is all that?

1086
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,700
You tell me.

1087
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:29,700
Found it in your brother's car.
Over a hundred K.

1088
00:52:29,834 --> 00:52:31,000
I have no idea.

1089
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,100
I think you found
out about Tony's stash.

1090
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:37,467
Got him out of the way,

1091
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,300
then you hired someone to toss
his house looking for the cash.

1092
00:52:41,433 --> 00:52:45,967
I didn't kill my brother.
I loved Tony.

1093
00:52:48,066 --> 00:52:50,133
What about you Mom?
You love her?

1094
00:52:50,266 --> 00:52:52,066
Of course.

1095
00:53:01,233 --> 00:53:05,200
Withholding medication that
don't sound like love to me.

1096
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,100
Should I get a
lawyer or something?

1097
00:53:07,233 --> 00:53:08,500
I don't know. Should you?

1098
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:12,834
I've been putting in long
hours at the coffee truck

1099
00:53:12,967 --> 00:53:14,166
and forgot to pick it up, okay?

1100
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,500
I don't buy it.
I don't buy it.

1101
00:53:18,633 --> 00:53:21,633
I think you sabotaged
your mother's health

1102
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:24,967
to sell her house
for your own gain.

1103
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,300
So, my question is what
would you willing to do

1104
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:31,533
to your brother Tony to
get your hands on this cash?

1105
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:33,533
I know nothing about that money.

1106
00:53:33,667 --> 00:53:35,033
And even if I had the money,

1107
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:36,800
I wouldn't lease a space
from the Twila Center now.

1108
00:53:36,934 --> 00:53:38,433
Why's that?

1109
00:53:38,567 --> 00:53:40,867
Dan Birch said the center isn't
off to a hot start financially

1110
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,200
so I'm holding off.

1111
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,000
Well you know not
opening a coffee shop

1112
00:53:46,133 --> 00:53:49,533
doesn't exactly exonerate you.

1113
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:50,867
Can I please go now?

1114
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,767
You can go.

1115
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,133
But don't make too
many plans, Ms. Patel.

1116
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:09,500
Thank you everyone for coming.

1117
00:54:09,633 --> 00:54:13,033
And thank you to Dan Birch
for hosting us here.

1118
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,166
Tony was my best friend

1119
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:23,100
and he was the most generous
person that I've ever known.

1120
00:54:23,233 --> 00:54:24,567
You wanted the
shirt off his back?

1121
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,000
You just ask him for it.

1122
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:30,000
I didn't know the first thing
about cars til I met him.

1123
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:34,867
But he had this
infectious enthusiasm

1124
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,934
for everything that he loved.

1125
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:38,100
His wife, Rachel,
knows what I'm talking about.

1126
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:42,233
And I can tell you
without any doubt,

1127
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:44,200
that he loved you more than
anything in this world.

1128
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,600
I miss her, too.

1129
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:26,333
It's like I can feel
her with me, in this house.

1130
00:55:30,367 --> 00:55:32,900
There's no rush to sell.

1131
00:55:33,033 --> 00:55:36,500
Would it be so
bad to stay a bit?

1132
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:42,800
I admit,
it is tempting sometimes.

1133
00:55:42,934 --> 00:55:45,100
It wouldn't have to be here,

1134
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:49,767
although of course that
would be my first choice.

1135
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:54,567
I would just love to see
you settle somewhere

1136
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,633
where you could be happy.

1137
00:55:56,767 --> 00:56:00,233
Call someplace home.

1138
00:56:00,367 --> 00:56:04,934
You know the dinner
rush is callin'.

1139
00:56:21,967 --> 00:56:24,066
Hey Diana! What's up?

1140
00:56:26,767 --> 00:56:30,133
You don't say?

1141
00:56:30,266 --> 00:56:32,900
This is the deed,
signed by Mrs. Patel.

1142
00:56:33,033 --> 00:56:34,800
Diana knows her realtor.

1143
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:37,500
And this is Mrs. Patel's
signature on a tax document

1144
00:56:37,633 --> 00:56:40,033
from last year that
Rachel got for me.

1145
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:43,166
The signatures don't match.

1146
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,667
How can you be...

1147
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,233
You see those tiny dots?

1148
00:56:46,367 --> 00:56:49,200
Often the forger will pause
to refer back to the original

1149
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:51,300
signature and then
press down on the paper

1150
00:56:51,433 --> 00:56:52,800
when they begin
the stroke again,

1151
00:56:52,934 --> 00:56:55,000
causing these
ink blots there.

1152
00:56:55,133 --> 00:56:56,467
Where did you learn that?

1153
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,300
Research for an article I wrote

1154
00:56:58,433 --> 00:57:00,567
about a forged
letter at a museum.

1155
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:05,700
Huh. So Sarah Jane forges
her mother's signature

1156
00:57:05,834 --> 00:57:07,934
and takes ownership
of the house.

1157
00:57:08,066 --> 00:57:10,233
But she's not
opening a coffee shop,

1158
00:57:10,367 --> 00:57:12,367
so why the need for fast cash?

1159
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,767
She's not?

1160
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,900
She told me Dan Birch said
the center's in the red,

1161
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:17,567
so it's not worth her while.

1162
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,500
Really?

1163
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:20,266
Because Dan told
Diana that he paid for

1164
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,100
all of Tony's funeral costs.

1165
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:25,400
Why would he
volunteer to do that

1166
00:57:25,533 --> 00:57:27,633
when the center is
financially trouble?

1167
00:57:27,767 --> 00:57:29,033
Very strange.

1168
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:32,400
Especially for two
men who weren't close.

1169
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:35,567
You make a big show
of your generosity

1170
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:40,066
because you're feeling
guilty or redirecting focus.

1171
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,567
If Dan and Tony
were into something,

1172
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,734
that's probably why they wanted

1173
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:45,300
Sarah Jane out of the center.

1174
00:57:45,433 --> 00:57:48,033
So she wouldn't get a whiff
of whatever they had going on.

1175
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:51,100
I'm gonna track down Dan,
see what's what.

1176
00:57:51,233 --> 00:57:52,900
But I like where your head's at.

1177
00:57:53,033 --> 00:57:55,633
Like peanut butter and
chocolate, the two of us.

1178
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:56,934
I wouldn't go that far.

1179
00:58:00,066 --> 00:58:02,333
Sarah Jane must be confused.

1180
00:58:02,467 --> 00:58:05,033
Like any new business
we've had our growing pains.

1181
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:06,467
But we're doing fine.

1182
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,667
Then why tell her
she couldn't move her

1183
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,633
coffee shop into the center?

1184
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:14,333
I don't mean to be rude,

1185
00:58:14,467 --> 00:58:18,433
but Sarah Jane is not
the most reliable person.

1186
00:58:18,567 --> 00:58:20,600
I think it best she stick
to operating her truck

1187
00:58:20,734 --> 00:58:22,333
outside in the warmer months.

1188
00:58:22,467 --> 00:58:29,033
She said you paid for
Tony's funeral expenses.

1189
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:32,000
That's pretty generous
for a guy you barely knew.

1190
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,967
Tony came to me a while back,

1191
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,500
asking if the center made

1192
00:58:35,633 --> 00:58:37,500
charitable contributions
to individuals

1193
00:58:37,633 --> 00:58:41,600
for cancer treatment.
Unfortunately, we don't.

1194
00:58:41,734 --> 00:58:45,266
Anyone else know
about this visit?

1195
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,867
No. Tony wanted to keep
his diagnosis private.

1196
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,033
I felt horrible
about turning him away

1197
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:55,266
so I paid for everything
out of my own pocket,

1198
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,166
it was the least I could do.

1199
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:03,266
Where were you on
April 17th, between 7 and 9PM?

1200
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,700
That the night
Tony was murdered?

1201
00:59:11,633 --> 00:59:13,400
Let's see.

1202
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,533
I was at dinner
with Maureen Silver,

1203
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:19,767
she serves on the
board at the center.

1204
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,233
Do you have receipt?

1205
00:59:21,367 --> 00:59:24,900
I'm sure my secretary filed it.

1206
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:32,433
Thank you.

1207
00:59:32,567 --> 00:59:34,400
Yeah.

1208
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:37,233
Hello, Detective Collins,
this is Estelle Bradley.

1209
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:40,233
I'm the Patel's real estate
agent, returning your call.

1210
00:59:40,367 --> 00:59:41,767
Yeah thanks for
getting back to me.

1211
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,834
I was wondering,
uh could tell me

1212
00:59:43,967 --> 00:59:48,033
the day and time Sarah
Jane was in your office?

1213
00:59:48,166 --> 00:59:51,266
Sure. Give me a just a moment.

1214
00:59:53,233 --> 00:59:56,533
Actually, we signed at
the property. Ms. Patel asked

1215
00:59:56,667 --> 00:59:59,200
that we meet after work
on Sunday the seventeenth.

1216
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:01,200
I arrived just before seven

1217
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:02,867
and we finished up
around quarter to nine.

1218
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,900
Nine, okay.

1219
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:08,033
Um, and you were you
with them the whole time?

1220
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:10,100
I did step away to take a call.

1221
01:00:10,233 --> 01:00:12,200
I was gone five,
maybe ten minutes.

1222
01:00:15,867 --> 01:00:17,433
So, Sarah Jane was
forging documents

1223
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:18,867
during Tony's time of death.

1224
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,367
Her alibi's clean.

1225
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,233
I'll keep pressing Dan Birch.

1226
01:00:24,367 --> 01:00:27,333
Right now he's our only
person of interest.

1227
01:00:27,467 --> 01:00:30,433
I found some old photos
in the back of Tony's closet.

1228
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:33,867
Look at you guys in
your football jerseys!

1229
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,734
Rach, can I keep some of these?

1230
01:00:35,867 --> 01:00:38,600
I'd love to frame
them for the shop.

1231
01:00:40,467 --> 01:00:45,333
Yeah, of course.
Whatever you want.

1232
01:00:45,467 --> 01:00:48,133
We're all here for you,
you know that.

1233
01:01:20,033 --> 01:01:23,300
Look Uncle Joe,
don't worry I'm fine.

1234
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:26,000
It's just a minor
concussion and some bruises.

1235
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,066
I think it's
best you let Jake

1236
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,800
take care of things from now on.

1237
01:01:31,934 --> 01:01:34,734
But what about Rachel?
She's my friend.

1238
01:01:34,867 --> 01:01:39,000
Exactly!
And she wants you to be alive.

1239
01:01:41,533 --> 01:01:43,333
With your mother gone,

1240
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:47,166
you're the only family
that I have left.

1241
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,667
I'm sorry to worry you.

1242
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,233
I promise to be careful, okay.

1243
01:01:53,367 --> 01:01:58,533
Yeah, look,
it's been a long day.

1244
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:00,967
I think I'm going to
go ahead and take a walk.

1245
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,934
I'll be back.

1246
01:02:03,066 --> 01:02:05,367
Hey Joe.
Hi girls.

1247
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:10,066
Hi! Oh, you two are
a sight for sore eyes.

1248
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,066
I think I gave him a scare.

1249
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,600
We were all so worried.
Thank goodness you're okay.

1250
01:02:15,734 --> 01:02:17,200
I'm very lucky.

1251
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:18,867
What happened?

1252
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,867
My brakes, they just...
gave out.

1253
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,433
That doesn't make any sense.

1254
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:27,200
I mean, Tony would never let
you borrow an unsafe car.

1255
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:29,600
I had it towed to the shop,
Andy will get it sorted out.

1256
01:02:29,734 --> 01:02:31,633
I'm just waiting for
my discharge papers.

1257
01:02:31,767 --> 01:02:34,266
You think someone
tampered with your car?

1258
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,600
We should tell the cops.

1259
01:02:36,734 --> 01:02:38,367
Let's not jump to conclusions.

1260
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:43,066
I dunno, Mel.
She might be right.

1261
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,133
Look, I appreciate you both
looking out for me, really.

1262
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:48,166
But whatever it is,
I'll handle it.

1263
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:55,700
What are you doing here?

1264
01:02:55,834 --> 01:02:58,400
Rachel told me
about the accident.

1265
01:02:58,533 --> 01:03:00,166
Why didn't you call me?

1266
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:03,633
I just... I wanted to get
more information first.

1267
01:03:03,767 --> 01:03:05,166
It's nothing.

1268
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,333
It's not nothing.

1269
01:03:06,467 --> 01:03:09,033
This is the exact thing
I was afraid might happen,

1270
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:10,867
you get caught up
in Tony's investigation

1271
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,266
and you put yourself
in harm's way.

1272
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,800
Well, if I was
actually targeted,

1273
01:03:15,934 --> 01:03:18,433
all the more reason
to find Tony's killer fast.

1274
01:03:18,567 --> 01:03:20,166
Mel!

1275
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,033
We just finished
inspecting your car

1276
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:26,200
and it looks like someone
tampered with your brakes.

1277
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:28,033
How can you be sure?

1278
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:31,033
The car had a complete work-up
before Tony gave it to you.

1279
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:33,200
Yeah, I changed the
brake pads myself.

1280
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:35,367
But it looks like someone
cut through the brake lines.

1281
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,100
But, not completely though,

1282
01:03:37,233 --> 01:03:39,533
cause you didn't notice
when you started the car.

1283
01:03:39,667 --> 01:03:40,700
Well, whoever did
this was smart, then.

1284
01:03:40,834 --> 01:03:42,633
They gambled the lines would

1285
01:03:42,767 --> 01:03:44,333
snap first time
you hit the brakes.

1286
01:03:44,467 --> 01:03:47,000
I'm gonna to need that paperwork
from the full work-up

1287
01:03:47,133 --> 01:03:48,633
before it was loaned to Melanie.

1288
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:51,467
As well as what
you inspected today.

1289
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,467
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1290
01:03:54,133 --> 01:03:56,333
I'm opening up a
full investigation.

1291
01:03:56,467 --> 01:03:58,500
No arguing.

1292
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,900
Okay, you're clear on the plan?

1293
01:04:04,033 --> 01:04:05,400
I can not believe you
suckered me into this.

1294
01:04:05,533 --> 01:04:06,667
It's for Rachel.

1295
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,934
Yup.

1296
01:04:08,066 --> 01:04:11,700
Dan! Fancy seeing you here!

1297
01:04:11,834 --> 01:04:12,834
Hi.
Hello, ladies!

1298
01:04:12,967 --> 01:04:15,533
I heard the fried clam
lunch special was amazing.

1299
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:16,700
I had to try it for myself!

1300
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:19,700
Yes it is! I come here once
a week for my cheat meal.

1301
01:04:19,834 --> 01:04:21,934
Okay.
You guys want to join me?

1302
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,166
Oh, sure.
Love to.

1303
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,200
Awesome.
Great.

1304
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:27,266
Remember the Cherry Springs
production of West Side Story?

1305
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,033
Oh, no.
What?

1306
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:31,233
You were a great Officer Krupke.

1307
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:35,100
My granddaughter though, she's
been bitten by the theater bug.

1308
01:04:35,233 --> 01:04:38,033
She starred as Annie last fall.

1309
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,533
That is wonderful. Let me see.
Let me see a pictures?

1310
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:41,700
It's about time you asked.

1311
01:04:41,834 --> 01:04:43,200
OK, let's see, let's see.

1312
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,367
Okay, hang on one sec.

1313
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,567
Sadie is so grown up.

1314
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:50,967
I remember when she was born.

1315
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,500
Do you know what goes
really well with fried clams?

1316
01:04:56,633 --> 01:04:59,533
Key lime pie!
Who wants to go halfsies?

1317
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:01,834
No cheat meal's complete
without dessert!

1318
01:05:01,967 --> 01:05:02,700
Yeah.
None for me.

1319
01:05:02,834 --> 01:05:04,800
I've gone a little
overboard lately.

1320
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:06,934
Alright, you and me. Let's go.

1321
01:05:07,066 --> 01:05:08,266
Come on, kiddo.

1322
01:05:21,133 --> 01:05:22,734
Come on. Come on.

1323
01:05:22,867 --> 01:05:24,467
Oh, no! Hey!

1324
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,300
Okay, no problem, no problem,
I'll just get some napkins.

1325
01:05:26,433 --> 01:05:27,333
Hang on.

1326
01:05:27,467 --> 01:05:28,934
Almost there.

1327
01:05:29,066 --> 01:05:30,600
How long does it
take to clone a phone?

1328
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,800
Okay, here we go.

1329
01:05:34,934 --> 01:05:36,266
Let's get this cleaned up.

1330
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,800
Here you go.

1331
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,266
I managed to save it
before the deluge.

1332
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,433
Oh, thank you.

1333
01:05:42,567 --> 01:05:43,767
Alright, let's eat.

1334
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:44,834
Oh, I love this.

1335
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,300
Waiting on an important call?

1336
01:05:55,433 --> 01:05:56,734
Uh, something like that.

1337
01:05:56,867 --> 01:06:00,133
You promised me you would
let Jake handle things.

1338
01:06:00,266 --> 01:06:03,200
I know. I know. Okay I just...

1339
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:07,233
I keep thinking that if
I can help find Tony's killer,

1340
01:06:07,367 --> 01:06:12,200
if I can give Rachel justice,
then maybe I can redeem myself,

1341
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:13,367
in some small way.

1342
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,734
Oh, honey.

1343
01:06:17,133 --> 01:06:19,333
Tell me what
happened in Fall River.

1344
01:06:19,467 --> 01:06:21,133
You mean what wasn't published?

1345
01:06:21,266 --> 01:06:22,300
That's right.

1346
01:06:22,433 --> 01:06:25,166
As far as I can see,
warning people about a factory

1347
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,800
abusing it's workers
is a good thing.

1348
01:06:27,934 --> 01:06:29,867
I wanted the front page.

1349
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,333
So my editor let
me hold the story.

1350
01:06:33,467 --> 01:06:36,367
That week,
a factory worker died.

1351
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:41,033
That's exactly what
your article was about.

1352
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:44,166
Negligence and poor
working conditions.

1353
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,567
Yes, but had I published
the article sooner,

1354
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,834
he might still be alive.

1355
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:55,166
Your aim was to help people, you
gotta cut yourself some slack.

1356
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:57,734
I thought that article would

1357
01:06:57,867 --> 01:06:59,800
actually force the owner
to improve conditions

1358
01:06:59,934 --> 01:07:03,967
but he just closed down the
factory and moved it abroad.

1359
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:07,533
We all go through life,
doing the best we can

1360
01:07:07,667 --> 01:07:10,100
with the information
that we have, at the time.

1361
01:07:10,233 --> 01:07:14,467
All those poor people
in Fall River out of work.

1362
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:15,834
Look at me.

1363
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,266
Yes, they all need new jobs,

1364
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:27,433
but at least they're alive
to do it. Thanks to you!

1365
01:07:29,066 --> 01:07:31,533
I hope someday I can
see it like you do.

1366
01:07:39,233 --> 01:07:40,600
Uncle Joe,
Can I borrow your car!

1367
01:07:40,734 --> 01:07:43,300
Yeah.

1368
01:07:43,433 --> 01:07:45,300
Be careful.

1369
01:07:45,433 --> 01:07:46,333
Thank you.
Alright.

1370
01:07:46,467 --> 01:07:49,533
Jake! Meet me at
Dan Birch's house right now.

1371
01:07:49,667 --> 01:07:51,667
I'll tell you when we
get there! Just hurry!

1372
01:07:55,033 --> 01:07:56,400
Oh, why is the
door open like that?

1373
01:07:56,533 --> 01:07:57,767
That's strange.

1374
01:08:00,734 --> 01:08:02,367
Stay here.

1375
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,834
This is Collins.

1376
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,967
I'm going to need backup.

1377
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:34,700
For a unresponsive male with
a gunshot wound to the chest.

1378
01:08:34,834 --> 01:08:38,166
Confirming the victim
as homeowner, Dan Birch.

1379
01:08:51,433 --> 01:08:52,700
so we'll take it to the station,

1380
01:08:52,834 --> 01:08:54,066
We'll have cyber
crimes work on it.

1381
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:58,133
Great. Um, run Dan's
personal financials, also.

1382
01:08:58,266 --> 01:08:59,900
Yeah, you got it.
Alright.

1383
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:06,100
You okay?

1384
01:09:06,233 --> 01:09:10,567
I will be.
Guess it's just hitting me.

1385
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,767
It's a lot.
Take all the time you need.

1386
01:09:14,834 --> 01:09:16,667
We found Dan Birch's cell.

1387
01:09:19,367 --> 01:09:23,200
Password is 2356.

1388
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:25,700
I don't even want to
know how you know that.

1389
01:09:25,834 --> 01:09:26,967
I looked over his shoulder.

1390
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,767
Kinda like you're doing now?

1391
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:32,266
And I cloned his phone.

1392
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,700
Cloning a phone is illegal.

1393
01:09:34,834 --> 01:09:37,266
Let's call it questionable.

1394
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,633
I already know the rules,
I deleted the app.

1395
01:09:42,066 --> 01:09:45,400
There. I saw that text.

1396
01:09:45,533 --> 01:09:50,300
"Cops talked to me today.
You need to fix this ASAP."

1397
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:51,500
Can you trace that number?

1398
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:55,800
I don't know, I don't
recognize the area code.

1399
01:09:55,934 --> 01:09:57,233
It's probably from
a burner phone.

1400
01:09:57,367 --> 01:09:58,467
It's untraceable.

1401
01:10:05,066 --> 01:10:06,767
You still think
Ryan Monroe is innocent?

1402
01:10:11,867 --> 01:10:14,033
Look, I've been here
for almost two hours.

1403
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:15,000
And I'm starving.

1404
01:10:15,133 --> 01:10:16,400
Could I at least
get water or something?

1405
01:10:16,533 --> 01:10:17,467
Later.

1406
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,066
I'm gonna tell you something.

1407
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,233
Dan sent a text saying
you were getting greedy

1408
01:10:23,367 --> 01:10:25,266
and they want to cut you out.

1409
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,900
I'm not the only guy in town
with the last name Monroe.

1410
01:10:29,033 --> 01:10:31,567
Don't play games with me.

1411
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:35,033
Cut you out of what?
What did y'all have going on?

1412
01:10:35,166 --> 01:10:38,266
I have no idea!
I barely knew the guy,

1413
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,700
the first time I talked to him
was at Tony's memorial service!

1414
01:10:40,834 --> 01:10:42,400
So you don't know Dan Birch.

1415
01:10:42,533 --> 01:10:44,900
And you don't know
William Dixon,

1416
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:47,934
who's awaiting trial for
breaking into Rachel's house.

1417
01:10:48,066 --> 01:10:50,967
Good. I'm glad you caught him.

1418
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,967
Looks like sometimes
you can do your job well.

1419
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,100
You are hiding
something from me.

1420
01:10:58,233 --> 01:11:00,200
No, I'm not.

1421
01:11:06,734 --> 01:11:08,200
What are you doing here?

1422
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:09,867
Figured Jake
wouldn't have enough

1423
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,834
to charge you with
and you'd be released.

1424
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:13,967
Exactly.
Because I didn't do anything.

1425
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,500
I think so, too.

1426
01:11:15,633 --> 01:11:17,100
The only way to clear your name

1427
01:11:17,233 --> 01:11:20,266
is to figure out who's trying
to throw you under the bus.

1428
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,367
I know you don't
know me very well,

1429
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,767
but would you be willing
to sit down and talk?

1430
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:29,033
Dom. Come in here
and look at this?

1431
01:11:29,166 --> 01:11:30,367
Yeah.

1432
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,800
Cyber was able to get
into Dan Birch's laptop.

1433
01:11:33,934 --> 01:11:35,166
Take a look.

1434
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,834
A few months ago, Dan Birch was
close to declaring bankruptcy.

1435
01:11:37,967 --> 01:11:40,000
Had three personal credit cards,
maxed out.

1436
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:41,100
Okay...

1437
01:11:41,233 --> 01:11:44,300
Now, last week,
right before Tony disappearance.

1438
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:48,533
Dan Birch paid out all his debts
in giant, lump sum payments.

1439
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:49,600
Not only that,

1440
01:11:49,734 --> 01:11:51,100
he's got a pretty hefty
sum in his checking.

1441
01:11:51,233 --> 01:11:52,667
Dan Birch was laundering money

1442
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,367
through fake accounts
at the center.

1443
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,734
Whoa. But why? And for who?

1444
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:00,734
I don't know,

1445
01:12:00,867 --> 01:12:03,000
but the money
found in Tony's car

1446
01:12:03,133 --> 01:12:05,533
was scrubbed clean by
none other than Dan Birch.

1447
01:12:05,667 --> 01:12:08,533
And you're sure Dan
never came into the shop.

1448
01:12:08,667 --> 01:12:10,166
Tony never mentioned doing
any business with him?

1449
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,600
No. Nothing.

1450
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,700
I really miss Tony.

1451
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:20,033
The garage isn't the
same without him around.

1452
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:22,033
How's it been,
working with Andy?

1453
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:24,033
He's a great, too.

1454
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:26,767
You know, um,
they're both real generous.

1455
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,734
Andy's been letting
me leave early,

1456
01:12:28,867 --> 01:12:30,533
but still gives me
a full days pay, so.

1457
01:12:30,667 --> 01:12:33,266
That's nice of him.
Yeah.

1458
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,600
Shop would be swimming in
cash if it wasn't for all the

1459
01:12:36,734 --> 01:12:38,367
family and friends
discounts they give out.

1460
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:42,100
I'm guessing those freebies
are left off the books?

1461
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:44,333
Pretty sure.

1462
01:12:44,467 --> 01:12:45,867
Do you know any
of the other customers

1463
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,900
that they loaned
cars up to recently?

1464
01:12:48,033 --> 01:12:50,233
No, no, that's Andy's thing.

1465
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:53,700
Yeah, the cars are gone for
a week or two at a time.

1466
01:12:53,834 --> 01:12:56,900
The cars come back,
Andy services them.

1467
01:12:57,033 --> 01:13:00,166
If you were going to
hide something in a car,

1468
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,600
where might you stash it?

1469
01:13:02,734 --> 01:13:07,333
Behind the AC vent or
inside the spare tire.

1470
01:13:07,467 --> 01:13:10,066
If you wanted to get
real clever with it

1471
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,633
you could make a secret
compartment onto a car part,

1472
01:13:12,767 --> 01:13:14,633
like a muffler or something.

1473
01:13:14,767 --> 01:13:18,834
Not that I have any
personal experience in that.

1474
01:13:21,567 --> 01:13:22,333
Why?

1475
01:13:22,467 --> 01:13:24,166
Oh, just curious.

1476
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,600
You know what,
you stay and finish.

1477
01:13:26,734 --> 01:13:28,100
Whatever meal that is.

1478
01:13:28,233 --> 01:13:30,000
There's something
I got to look into.

1479
01:13:32,467 --> 01:13:35,600
So I was going over the River
Rock Casino security footage.

1480
01:13:35,734 --> 01:13:37,667
Thought I'd spot
Ryan with William,

1481
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,166
catch Ryan in a lie.

1482
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,233
And did you?

1483
01:13:40,367 --> 01:13:42,100
No. But I found something
even more interesting.

1484
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,600
That's Dan Birch!

1485
01:13:46,734 --> 01:13:48,767
And there's William Dixon,
who we know was involved

1486
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,300
was involved in
a local drug gang.

1487
01:13:50,433 --> 01:13:51,800
The only reason why

1488
01:13:51,934 --> 01:13:53,633
an upstanding citizen
would get involved

1489
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:55,266
in cleaning money
for a local drug gang

1490
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,266
is greed and desperation.

1491
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,467
Yeah, and based
on Dan's finances

1492
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,400
we know it's the latter.

1493
01:14:01,533 --> 01:14:04,166
I'd bet the farm, our boy
Dan was a gambling addict.

1494
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:07,367
That's where all his money went,
the River Rock Casino.

1495
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,166
You know Dan never
did alibi out.

1496
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,667
He could be Tony's killer.

1497
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,834
But then, who killed Dan?

1498
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:21,200
Yeah, okay,
we'll be right there.

1499
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:22,000
That was the coroner.

1500
01:14:22,133 --> 01:14:23,133
He just finished Dan's autopsy.

1501
01:14:23,266 --> 01:14:24,400
Let's go.
Yeah.

1502
01:15:45,133 --> 01:15:46,133
Melanie.

1503
01:15:46,266 --> 01:15:47,667
Andy.

1504
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,700
How'd you get in here?

1505
01:15:50,734 --> 01:15:51,400
What is that?

1506
01:15:51,533 --> 01:15:54,000
Looks to me like drugs.

1507
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:55,800
Ah, Tony.

1508
01:15:55,934 --> 01:15:58,266
I knew he was
desperate for money

1509
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,433
to leave behind for Rachel.

1510
01:15:59,567 --> 01:16:00,633
But do you think he...?

1511
01:16:00,767 --> 01:16:02,066
Dan Birch is dead.

1512
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,467
What? How?

1513
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,467
Someone shot him.

1514
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,300
So he was involved with Tony?

1515
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:12,200
Who... was Ryan involved?

1516
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:13,667
The police seem to think so.

1517
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,967
This is crazy.

1518
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,367
Well, it certainly is.

1519
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,800
You know, before Dan died,

1520
01:16:18,934 --> 01:16:21,066
he texted with
someone about Ryan.

1521
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,400
Who?

1522
01:16:22,533 --> 01:16:23,400
The police don't know.

1523
01:16:23,533 --> 01:16:24,700
It was to a burner phone.

1524
01:16:24,834 --> 01:16:25,867
That's too bad.

1525
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,333
Yeah.

1526
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:40,567
Ryan mentioned you've been
letting him leave work early.

1527
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:43,600
Made me wonder what was
going on here after he left.

1528
01:16:47,266 --> 01:16:50,000
TOD for Dan Birch is07PM.

1529
01:16:50,133 --> 01:16:52,033
07?

1530
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:54,066
That's awfully exact.

1531
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,500
Well he had a pacemaker.

1532
01:16:55,633 --> 01:16:58,367
The thing recorded
his very last heartbeat.

1533
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,734
Dominic, the last text
that Dan Birch sent,

1534
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:05,934
the one that incriminated Ryan,
was12.

1535
01:17:06,066 --> 01:17:07,567
Well that certainly
complicates things

1536
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,233
since dead men don't text.

1537
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,033
We got to run, Doc.
Thanks.

1538
01:17:15,166 --> 01:17:17,033
Why couldn't you just mind
your own business, Mel?

1539
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:19,133
You were running
drugs through the shop.

1540
01:17:19,266 --> 01:17:21,367
You killed Dan Birch.
And you killed Tony.

1541
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:24,266
I didn't kill them, okay.
I swear I didn't kill them.

1542
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,433
Okay, then put the gun down.
Just, tell me what happened.

1543
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,800
A couple guys approached me,
offering me a lot of money.

1544
01:17:33,934 --> 01:17:36,500
It's supposed to be easy.

1545
01:17:36,633 --> 01:17:38,500
Bring in cars with
these special mufflers.

1546
01:17:38,633 --> 01:17:40,333
I remove them,
I get the drugs out,

1547
01:17:40,467 --> 01:17:42,266
I reinstall the mufflers.
That's it.

1548
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,100
Why would you get involved
with something illegal

1549
01:17:44,233 --> 01:17:45,767
when you have so much
going on for you at the shop?

1550
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,467
Because I wanted
something of my own.

1551
01:17:49,133 --> 01:17:50,800
My name might be on
that sign out front,

1552
01:17:50,934 --> 01:17:53,166
but this place was Tony's.

1553
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,467
I thought you were best friends.

1554
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,200
I know.

1555
01:17:58,233 --> 01:17:59,967
And I loved that
guy like a brother.

1556
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:03,033
But Tony called the
shots and I'd had enough.

1557
01:18:03,166 --> 01:18:04,500
So, I thought I could
make some quick cash

1558
01:18:04,633 --> 01:18:07,200
I could finally open
up a place of my own.

1559
01:18:07,333 --> 01:18:10,033
How did Dan get involved?

1560
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:12,467
We needed somebody
to clean the cash.

1561
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,834
So he ran it through
the Twila Center.

1562
01:18:14,967 --> 01:18:16,533
Why would he agree to do that?

1563
01:18:16,667 --> 01:18:19,033
Because Dan's a gambling addict
and he's up to his ears in debt,

1564
01:18:19,166 --> 01:18:20,400
It wasn't hard to convince him.

1565
01:18:20,533 --> 01:18:23,533
And everything
was working out fine,

1566
01:18:23,667 --> 01:18:26,667
and then Dan got greedy.

1567
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,400
And he took bigger risks.

1568
01:18:28,533 --> 01:18:29,967
And we got way in
way over our heads.

1569
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,800
So, what happened?

1570
01:18:31,934 --> 01:18:33,500
Tony happened.

1571
01:18:33,633 --> 01:18:36,533
He found a bunch of cash
and he wanted answers.

1572
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:38,166
I tried to explain it to him.

1573
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,533
When that didn't work
I tried to cut him in.

1574
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:42,500
He told me I had
one week to stop

1575
01:18:42,633 --> 01:18:44,533
the operation or
he'd tell the cops.

1576
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:48,533
But Tony kept the
money for Rachel.

1577
01:18:48,667 --> 01:18:49,600
How did you know that?

1578
01:18:49,734 --> 01:18:53,300
The police found it sewn
into the seat of his car.

1579
01:18:53,433 --> 01:18:55,867
Yeah, I looked
everywhere for it.

1580
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,367
Cause I knew if I
couldn't up with that cash

1581
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,967
I'd be on the hook.

1582
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:02,767
So, you sent William Dixon to
break into Rachel's house?

1583
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:05,266
And you cut my brakes because

1584
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,300
you knew I was getting
close to the truth?

1585
01:19:07,433 --> 01:19:09,100
No, that wasn't me.

1586
01:19:09,233 --> 01:19:12,300
I swear, Mel,
I had nothing to do with that.

1587
01:19:12,433 --> 01:19:15,700
Okay, so, Dan killed Tony,

1588
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:19,700
the drug dealers killed
Dan and you framed Ryan?

1589
01:19:19,834 --> 01:19:22,200
I found Dan's body after
the dealers killed him

1590
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:23,533
and I sent that text.

1591
01:19:23,667 --> 01:19:25,400
Ryan's a good kid.
Okay.

1592
01:19:25,533 --> 01:19:26,967
But, I was desperate.

1593
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:30,734
Okay, Andy look,
you made some bad choices.

1594
01:19:30,867 --> 01:19:34,734
But you don't have...
Listen you can turn this around.

1595
01:19:34,867 --> 01:19:36,066
Okay, just, just,
give me the gun.

1596
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,367
I can help you.

1597
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,900
You said it yourself.

1598
01:19:39,033 --> 01:19:41,800
I've made a mess.
And now I got to clean it up.

1599
01:19:41,934 --> 01:19:44,400
Talk to me Andy.
Okay, just, just...

1600
01:19:44,533 --> 01:19:46,200
It doesn't have to end
with one of us getting hurt.

1601
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:47,233
Okay.

1602
01:19:49,266 --> 01:19:50,567
I'm sorry, Mel.

1603
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,800
I thought I told you to
finish eating your pancakes.

1604
01:20:17,934 --> 01:20:19,734
I suspected the
same thing you did,

1605
01:20:19,867 --> 01:20:20,967
and I lost my appetite.

1606
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,266
Police, show me your hands!

1607
01:20:26,367 --> 01:20:28,266
Thanks for coming.

1608
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,233
Are you okay?

1609
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:34,867
I will be.
Just a little shaky.

1610
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,467
You have the right
to remain silent.

1611
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,133
How'd you figure it out?

1612
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:41,133
Oh, something Ryan told me

1613
01:20:41,266 --> 01:20:43,700
because I know how to get
people to open up to me.

1614
01:20:43,834 --> 01:20:45,967
What you did was
extremely dangerous.

1615
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,433
You don't listen.

1616
01:20:50,033 --> 01:20:51,333
But you're a good investigator.

1617
01:20:53,767 --> 01:20:54,667
And a good friend.

1618
01:20:57,233 --> 01:20:58,800
Thank you.

1619
01:21:11,467 --> 01:21:13,433
Oh! Hi! Hello!

1620
01:21:13,567 --> 01:21:15,500
These are for you.

1621
01:21:15,633 --> 01:21:16,967
Aww, they're beautiful.

1622
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:17,934
I picked them out.

1623
01:21:18,066 --> 01:21:19,233
That's so sweet.

1624
01:21:23,767 --> 01:21:26,266
There's something I want
to say and it can't wait.

1625
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,667
On the list of things
that Tony loved most,

1626
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,200
his shop was only second to me.

1627
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:36,834
So, Ryan I want
you to take over.

1628
01:21:36,967 --> 01:21:40,100
Tony would be so
happy that it lives on.

1629
01:21:40,233 --> 01:21:42,033
What do you think?

1630
01:21:42,166 --> 01:21:47,033
Yes! Of course. Wow!

1631
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:48,834
Thank you, Rachel.

1632
01:21:48,967 --> 01:21:51,800
I won't let you down.

1633
01:21:51,934 --> 01:21:56,200
Tony would be
really proud of you.

1634
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:58,133
To Ryan!

1635
01:21:58,266 --> 01:21:59,633
To Tony.

1636
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,700
To Tony!

1637
01:22:03,834 --> 01:22:05,867
To Tony!

1638
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:12,900
Actually, I have my
own good news to share.

1639
01:22:13,033 --> 01:22:15,500
I called my publisher
this morning

1640
01:22:15,633 --> 01:22:18,900
and I've decided to write about
my experience in Fall River.

1641
01:22:19,033 --> 01:22:20,367
Yes.

1642
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,934
And I figured what better
place to write a book

1643
01:22:23,066 --> 01:22:25,333
than surrounded by
all the people I love.

1644
01:22:25,467 --> 01:22:27,834
Oh, so you're staying!?

1645
01:22:27,967 --> 01:22:34,567
Yes. Yes. Yeah.
You see.

1646
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:38,400
So, I looked into it and
the day your brakes were cut

1647
01:22:38,533 --> 01:22:41,600
Andy and Ryan were five hours
away picking up car parts.

1648
01:22:41,734 --> 01:22:44,200
So he was telling the truth.

1649
01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:48,934
Hey, we'll get to
the bottom of this.

1650
01:22:49,066 --> 01:22:51,400
But in the meantime,
just be careful.

1651
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:55,867
I will. Thank you.

1652
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:56,600
Alright.

1653
01:22:59,166 --> 01:23:03,000
Lucas, tell Bogie
you'll see him soon.

1654
01:23:03,133 --> 01:23:04,633
Bye, Bogie.

1655
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:08,266
See ya.
Bye.

1656
01:23:26,734 --> 01:23:29,567
Tony's investigation
proved I can't just stand

1657
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:32,166
on the sidelines when
there's injustice at play.

1658
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,266
It's like my uncle always says.

1659
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,233
Helping people is what I do.

1660
01:23:37,367 --> 01:23:43,633
I didn't want to tell my story,
but I realize I have to.

1661
01:23:43,767 --> 01:23:45,934
So here goes.
