00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:51,689
You could let her stay.

167
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,348
Yeah, please, Doctor Roth,
we don't have to do this.

168
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,020
You weren't there
when her mother needed you

169
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:56,958
and you won't be there
when Meredith needs you,

170
00:09:57,623 --> 00:09:58,696
but I will.

171
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:02,260
Oh, I know.

172
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:04,801
You want to strike me.

173
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:07,738
It's your only answer.

174
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:09,872
Violence.

175
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,571
You're an unsafe parent.

176
00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:19,076
You're a killer.

177
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:20,949
You can't pretend
that you're not.

Today's my day.

183
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:41,101
Why's your grandfather
throwing a party on my day?

184
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:44,967
I'm super hungry.
I didn't eat.

185
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:46,007
I was waiting for you.

186
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:48,240
You were?

187
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:49,681
Yeah.

188
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:53,850
Okay. Let's go.

I don't need you buying stuff.

193
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:07,292
Come on. Open it.

194
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,042
It's Mama.

[sentimental music playing]

196
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:25,945
I took that picture

197
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,346
with a film camera
my dad gave me.

198
00:11:29,853 --> 00:11:31,789
Grandpa took
all of Mama's pictures down.

199
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:35,221
Sometimes I forget
what she looks like.

200
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:38,125
She looks like you.

201
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,760
Dad, can I tell you something?

202
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:45,803
Anything.

203
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:52,667
I'm mad at Mama.

204
00:11:53,873 --> 00:11:56,407
For dying and leaving us.

205
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,050
It's okay.

206
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:04,646
I hurt, too.

[sentimental music continues]

208

Matt will see you now.

209
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,780
He's throwing parties for her
during my visitation time.

210
00:12:30,514 --> 00:12:32,041
Staring at me, laughing.

211
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:33,548
[Matt] He's baiting you.

212
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,215
Hoping you throw a punch.

213
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,920
Nah.

214
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:38,922
Then he wins.

215
00:12:39,687 --> 00:12:41,018
Opposing counsel

216
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:43,694
alleges you have
untreated PTSD

217
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,662
and brain trauma
from your military service,

218
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:48,658
making you
at-risk for violence.

219
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:52,833
I served Britain, the country
of my birth, for 22 years.

220
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:54,366
I'm the fuckin' bad guy
for it?

221
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,733
It gets worse.

222
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,276
They're requesting
supervised visits

223
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:06,515
and a reduction in visitation
from two hours a week

224
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,518
to one hour every two.

225
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:10,013
[Levon] I have to fight this.

226
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:12,018
I have ten grand saved up.

227

[Matt] From sleeping
in your truck?

228
00:13:13,623 --> 00:13:15,021
Court won't be thrilled

229
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:16,360
by your lack
of a fixed residence.

230
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,628
Hey, I'll figure it out.

231
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,930
Why does Doctor Roth
hate you so much?

232
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,529
He thinks
I killed his daughter.

233
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:24,935
Did you?

234
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,465
It was suicide.

235
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,733
I was overseas
on a deployment.

236
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:36,811
She battled depression
her whole life.

00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:38,946
You've heard
of attrition warfare?

238
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:41,110
Yeah. You grind
the enemy down slowly.

239
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:43,082
This guy's got a team

240
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:45,389
of thousand-dollar-an-hour
attorneys

241
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,789
who will bleed you dry

242

until you turn to dust
and blow away.

243
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:51,929
The best we can do
is negotiated surrender.

00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:43,880
We invited half our family.

333
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,091
My cousin Dinora
is a Police Captain in Philly,

334
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,961
and she says
they don't work these cases.

335
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,230
They take a report
and forget about it.

336
00:18:53,995 --> 00:18:55,757
Can you help us?

337
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:58,229
I can keep the site
running smoothly.

338
00:18:58,264 --> 00:18:59,137
No. Help us find Jen.

339
00:19:01,597 --> 00:19:02,899
My dad was a Green Beret.

340
00:19:04,306 --> 00:19:06,144
I can see you guys
comin' a mile away.

341
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,806
You hunt bad guys.

342
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:11,378
You jump outta planes.

343
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:13,745
[tearfully]
And you get those bad guys.

344
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:17,012
I'm a different person now.

345
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:21,786
All right, well,

346
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,921
[sniffles]
maybe this'll help her.

347
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:29,761
Here, it's 50.

348
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,464
Take it.

349
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:33,298
[Carla] We have another 20
for expenses.

350
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,264
Come on, just take it, man.

351
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:35,701
[Levon] I'm sorry.

352
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,444
It's not who I am anymore.

353

Gunny, it's me!

356
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:16,874
Don't kill me!

357
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:20,383
I got steaks!

358
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:22,484
If you'd shot
a foot to the left,
I'd be dead.

359
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,621
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

360
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:26,752
[laughs]

361
00:20:29,057 --> 00:20:30,151
You know, for me,

362
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,830
there's no separation
between day and night.

363
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:34,998
So, I got to make my own.

364
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,191
It's hard livin'
in a gray world.

365
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:40,801
I couldn't save your eyes.

366
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:42,196
Sorry.

367
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,506
That eats at me.

368
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,937
No.

369
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:48,543
You saved my life.

370
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:51,171
Joyce would be burying tags
in the back yard

371
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:52,882
if you hadn't come along,
scooped me up and ran.

[somber music playing]

373

What's her name?

374
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:01,523
Jenny.

375
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:03,393
Jenny. All right.

376
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:05,762
She a good kid?

377
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,122
She's a great kid.

378
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,434
Now, you do this,
you better lock in.

379
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:15,270
You better go full on,
no half-measures.

380

But you do, God help 'em.
[chuckles]

381
00:21:19,472 --> 00:21:21,103
I told Jenny I had her back.

382
00:21:22,472 --> 00:21:23,743
Well, uh...

383
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,383
I miss ya.

384

I worry about ya,

385

but you didn't have
to come down here
and pretend that

386
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:36,225
you needed my permission
for something

387
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,694

made your mind up about.

to go to business school.

Nah. No, thanks.

and I left the Royal Marines,

415

a lot of people
would've given up on me.

-Get me the hell outta here.

Yes, my brother.

1664
01:46:53,038 --> 01:46:54,264
He escaped...

1665
01:46:55,337 --> 01:46:56,833
with the girl.

1666
01:46:56,868 --> 01:46:58,235
None of this was business.

1667

The devil has what he came for.

1668
01:47:03,344 --> 01:47:04,340
Let him go.

1669
01:47:05,585 --> 01:47:09,650
I understand our need
to move quietly in the world.

1670
01:47:09,686 --> 01:47:12,554
But I will not turn
the other cheek

1671
01:47:12,589 --> 01:47:16,390
to the man
who killed my children.

1672
01:47:16,425 --> 01:47:19,223
Then we will kill you.

1673
01:47:19,258 --> 01:47:22,468
The Brotherhood comes before
your personal vengeance.

1674

Do you understand?

1675
01:47:25,433 --> 01:47:26,862
I understand.

[Joyce] I was thinking
about taking Merry

01:48:45,218 --> 01:48:46,313
out to the chicken coop today.

1696
01:48:46,348 --> 01:48:47,418
[Gunny] Oh.

1697
01:48:47,453 --> 01:48:48,614
-Yeah, would you like that?
-Yeah.

1698
01:48:48,649 --> 01:48:49,784
-Yeah.
-I don't know.

1699
01:48:49,819 --> 01:48:51,620
You better watch out
for that old grumpy one.

-He's mean. He's mean.

You came back.

[gentle music playing]

[chuckles, kisses]

1706
01:49:08,635 --> 01:49:10,175
You're okay, Daddy?

1707
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:11,676
Yeah. I nicked myself shaving.

1708
01:49:16,410 --> 01:49:17,344
Hi.

1709
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:18,710
Welcome back.

Hey, Joyce.

1712
01:49:23,749 --> 01:49:24,854
You're in one piece.

1713
01:49:26,322 --> 01:49:27,318
Just about.

1714
01:49:29,892 --> 01:49:31,957
Well, I guess
they didn't kill you, huh?

1715
01:49:31,992 --> 01:49:34,526
Nah. They really tried
their best.

I found her.

So, what did I miss?

1720
01:49:48,549 --> 01:49:51,879
Well, I made friends
with a crow and an owl.

1721
01:49:51,914 --> 01:49:54,018
And there's a goat
I taught to say my name.

-No.
-Yeah.

It was really cool.
I was just talking,

and then it was like, "Merry!
