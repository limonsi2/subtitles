- [Michael] This morning, the
ACLU filed a federal lawsuit

4
00:00:18,646 --> 00:00:21,614
against the Department of
Justice and against the FBI,

5
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:25,717
challenging the designation
of a musical fan base

6
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:28,357
as a criminal gang.

7
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:33,131
It is a quintessential
civil liberties case,

8
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,530
challenging government
abuse and supporting

9
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:39,236
the right of people
to express themselves

10
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:42,206
without fear of
police persecution.

11
00:00:43,737 --> 00:00:47,211
- Recognizing the
absurdity of the situation

12
00:00:48,577 --> 00:00:50,775
and that there are
civil liberties

13
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,349
and constitutional
issues involved

14
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:56,517

Just the face paint alone.

Alternative music didn't
want nothing to do with us.

89

Hip hop didn't want
nothing to do with it.

90
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:27,596
Without a home, a home
began to form itself

91
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:31,633
and began to dig its own
niche out in society.

92
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:34,669
- Explaining Juggalos
is such a hard thing.

93
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:36,935
- You probably maybe
come from a broken home

94

and you dealing with
with depression.

95
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:42,314
You know what I mean?

Probably dealing with
depression like we do.

97
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:46,417
- Trouble, you know,
trouble in their life.

98

Stuff like that, you know?

99
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:49,684
I think that's why it's
such a good clique,

100
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:52,456
such a good thing because we're
Juggalos ourself, you know?

101
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:53,754
- What does it mean
to be a Juggalo?

102
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:55,426
Most people say family.

103
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,988
- You're just walking
around with your shirt

110

111
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:10,507
Being who the fuck you are

112

other people judged us

117
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,454

00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:24,201
of a rap group called
the Insane Clown Posse,

179
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,038
known for its violent lyrics.

180
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:27,677
- [Female TV Reporter]
There's about a million fans

181
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:29,547
and a percentage may
be involved in crime.

182
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,746
- [Older Female Reporter]
The FBI has classified

183
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,649
Juggalos as a gang.

184
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:34,981
- [British Radio Reporter]
Juggalos say they're a family.

185
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:37,819
- Family, family,
family, family!

186
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:42,087
♪ And I'd walk home
feeling like a samurai ♪

187
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:45,090
♪ I'd walk in the house
and see my mama cry ♪

188
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,961
♪ I'd ask why, she
points to my drunk pops ♪

189
00:07:47,996 --> 00:07:50,832
♪ He tried to hit her
again, but that shit stops ♪

190
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:53,769
♪ I kick him in his throat,
you hear his neck break ♪

191
00:07:53,804 --> 00:07:57,036
- We both come from poor,
broken families, broken homes.

192
00:07:57,071 --> 00:08:00,611
- Our real dad bailed
when I was two.

193
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:05,110
We had to go through
his replacement,
which was even worse.

194
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:07,244
- The older I get, the more
I realize how fucked up

195
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,048
my childhood was, but
I definitely think

196
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,654
it helped made us
stronger people.

197
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,590
You know what I'm saying?

198
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,526
And I think it made us 10
billion times more hungry

199
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,989
when we starting out.

200
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:17,925
Not having nothing
when you grow up,

201
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,289
that'll shape you for the
rest of your fucking life,

202
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:21,896
whether you got money or not.

203
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:25,064
(My Heart Will Go On style song)

204
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:28,606
- [Linda] Yes, throughout the
whole house, isn't it, hun?

205
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,069
The nautical theme.

206
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:37,582
My name is Linda and
I'm Violent J's mother,

207
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:40,981
Joe Bruce.

208
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:44,116
And I'm a Juggalette.

209
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:47,053
I think I was probably
the first one.

210
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:49,627
- You were the first one, ma.

211
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:54,797
- [Linda] I was 19 years old
when I had my first baby.

212
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:59,835
That was Teresa. And then I
had Rob and then Joe's my baby,

213
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,001
the caboose.

214
00:09:03,071 --> 00:09:03,937
We struggled.

215
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,206
We were poor, but we
never went to bed hungry

216
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:10,109
or anything like that.

217
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:12,177
But there wasn't a lot of
money for entertainment.

218
00:09:12,212 --> 00:09:15,180
But as a mother, you always try.

219
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:16,918
- [Violent J] We were the
poorest in the neighborhood.

220
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:19,250
We got the food
stamps and all that.

221
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:21,186
But our imaginations were there.

222
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:23,760
Big time imaginations,
you know what I'm saying?

223
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:25,289
We had a club name.

224
00:09:25,324 --> 00:09:27,962
We called ourselves The Floobs.

225
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:35,233
First thing we did was
make having nothing cool.

226
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,304
It's okay to have
mismatched shoes.

227
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:44,044
We had these rickety old bikes

228
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:45,947
and kids would make fun of us.

229
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:48,180
They were riding around with
Mongooses and Supergooses.

230
00:09:48,215 --> 00:09:50,083
We'd have fucked up bikes.

231
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:53,152
They were pieced together
from like nine other bikes.

232
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:54,758
And we made it cool.

233
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:56,254
We were like, that's
the Floobmobile.

234
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:58,388
We turned it around
and we really did feel

235
00:09:58,423 --> 00:09:59,994
like we were the shit.

236
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:02,029
Cause we were part
of the Floobs.

237
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:03,162
- [Shaggy] We
didn't feel left out

238
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:04,768
cause we were with each other.

239
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:07,001
Like them fucking
trench coat mafia kids

240
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:08,805
from the fucking
Columbine or whatever.

241
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,235
They're all crying about

242
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,841
they didn't have no
friends, whatever.

243
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,073
There was two of
those motherfuckers,

244
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:14,976
you know what I'm saying?

245
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:16,879
They have friends, they
had each other, you know?

246
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:20,212
- [Linda] They have a lot
of self-worth together.

247
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:24,821
Even maybe separately they
don't, but together they do.

248
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:28,187
Joe had a fire, is the
only thing I can call it.

249
00:10:28,222 --> 00:10:31,025
When he wanted to do something,
you couldn't deny it.

250
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,797
He just had to, he had to do it.

251
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,965
- We always been the type
of kids that do whatever

252
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,429
we were into, you
know, we have to do it.

253
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:44,676
- And then he started going
really interested in wrestling.

254
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:48,339
I remember driving him
to Joe Louis Arena.

255
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:50,242
I didn't have the money.

256
00:10:50,277 --> 00:10:53,377
And I knew that if I didn't
take him, he would've walked.

257
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:57,183
- I must've been 15 years
old, maybe 14 years old.

258
00:10:57,218 --> 00:10:59,086
Out back is where
we all would get our

259
00:10:59,121 --> 00:11:02,122
autographs from all the
wrestlers coming out.

260
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:03,860
And all of a sudden, I see
these two guys wrestling,

261
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:05,323
these two young kids.

262
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:07,325
And I'm like, holy shit, man.

263
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,702
They do it better
than the guys inside.

264
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,099
- [Linda] I remember
coming home from work and

265
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:14,772
there'd be footprints
on my ceiling.

266
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:18,006
And I was trying to figure
out how that happened.

267
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:22,076
They would super suplex each
other in the living room.

268
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:24,210
He'd be flipping them and
the guy would actually

269
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:25,981
walk on the ceiling.

270
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:29,380
They were in junior
high school and

271
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:31,481
they started their
own wrestling league,

272
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:34,385
National Allstar Wrestling.

273
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,794
- [Violent J] We had a ring
built in his mom's backyard.

274
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,488
Built out of railroad logs.

275
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:40,259
We'd wait till it would rain

276
00:11:40,294 --> 00:11:41,931
and we'd be out
there in the rain

277
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:43,361
pounding it in the ground

278
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:44,494
because the ground
would be softer.

279
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:46,133
And then we use garden hose

280
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:48,003
to wrap around the
railroad rails.

281
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:50,302
- And we'd sell
it to the fullest.

282
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:51,941
To the kids in the neighborhood.

283
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:54,141
We ran it like a real
wrestling organization.

284
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:55,505
- We would advertise.

285
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,276
- Flyer the neighborhood.

286
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,409
- Flyer through the
neighborhood, house to house.

287
00:11:58,444 --> 00:12:00,785
Come see N.A.W. kids wrestling.

288
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,084
We weren't waiting till
we grew up to wrestle.

289
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:04,855
We were like, we're
bringing wrestling to us.

290
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,516
- I got to make the hot dogs.

291
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:09,123
I had the hot dogs
going and chips.

292
00:12:09,158 --> 00:12:10,993
It had free lunch.

293
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:13,259
When you came, you got a
hot dog and a bag of chips.

294
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:16,328
But they did it all themselves.

295
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:19,034
I don't know where a lot
of that talent came from,

296
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:22,840
but there was something
going on all the time.

297
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,337
When they started going to high
school, it was really hard.

298
00:12:25,372 --> 00:12:28,175
Cause all of a sudden you
don't know where they are

299
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,980
or who their friends are
or what they're doing.

309
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:45,929
when I was 15.

310
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:46,897
- Oh, that's the Atlantis?

311
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,327
- No, no.

312
00:12:48,362 --> 00:12:49,460
Atlantis I went
to when I was 14.

313
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:51,231
I put on a fake mustache.

314
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:54,036
- [Violent J] I could show
you the greatest place

315
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:56,071
to hide a dead body too.

316
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,977
- The Floobs ended up being
eventually the Inner City Posse,

317
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:02,847
which was their own gang.

318
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,310
- We were gonna
be some bad asses.

319
00:13:04,345 --> 00:13:06,180
We were forming our own thing.

320
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:08,886
Even though, the fact of the
matter is, we didn't know shit.

321
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,316
- We were like gang-wannabe.

322
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:11,449
- [Violent J] We started tagging

323
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:14,122
ICP all over the neighborhood.

324
00:13:14,157 --> 00:13:16,421
With rhinestone ICP hats on.

325
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,897
We were crazy for doing
what we were doing

326
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,559
because these were
real gangs here.

327
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,001
And we learned how to
get our ass kicked too.

328
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:27,267
- Yeah I learned how
to take a good beating.

329
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:29,940
- So we were walking
past these gang members

330
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,469
sitting on a porch

331
00:13:31,504 --> 00:13:35,473
and they were just
giving us this mean eye.

332
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:37,475
So, boom, we just
march on through, man.

333
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,015
Like we're the Warriors.

334
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,346
Here we go, man.

335
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:43,184
And we give them
these mean mugs.

336
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:47,419
There must've been, I don't
know, 20 of them at the time.

337
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:51,159
And I was like, fuck
man, here we go.

338
00:13:51,194 --> 00:13:53,590
Somebody says something.

339
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,097
I say, fuck you.

340
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:58,166
And fuck all you guys.

341
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:01,202
And we (imitates
heavy breathing).

342
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:03,402
All of a sudden,
man, the gang squad.

343
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:08,440
God couldn't have timed it
better for us to save our lives.

344
00:14:09,377 --> 00:14:10,541
The gang squad pulls up

345
00:14:10,576 --> 00:14:12,510
and Joe and I start walking.

346
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:14,347
We start walking

347
00:14:14,382 --> 00:14:16,954
and these guys are booking

348
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,154
all around me, surrounded them.

349

So they get them.

351
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:24,654

00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:31,133
- We were a fucking
miniature gang.

356
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:33,564
And so when this FBI
gang thing happened

357
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:36,270
25 years later, we
thought it was funny.

358
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:37,337
We laughed. We were like,

359
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:38,635
dang we're gang-bangers.

360
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,977

one of the 10 most
notorious real gangs.

Look at at how fine she is, bro.

379
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,252
Fifteen years old,
this was on my wall.

My mom was a hippie.

383
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:31,325
So of course she
had the White Album,

384
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,097

catching on a little bit.

389
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,574
Learned how to start
scratching, deejaying.

390
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:53,017

first one to commercially

in Detroit at the time

would lie to us.

456
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:20,890
- They would say, "How
many have you guys sold?"

before they went on stage.

487
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:22,655

494
00:19:36,935 --> 00:19:40,211

They're like, "The fuck
are these guys doing?"

496

00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:39,699
Kids fuckin' loved
that they were there.

521
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:42,031
We love fuckin' doing it. We
just did it more and more.

522
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:43,637
- [Violent J]
That's who we were.

523
00:20:43,672 --> 00:20:46,409
We always had a two
liter, you know.

524
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:49,544
What the fuck, man?

525
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:52,547
We used to pass fuckin' two
liters like they were 40s.

526
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:53,911
- Straight up.

527
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:56,045
- And now I remember
this clearly.

528
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,454
I remember Joe saying

529
00:20:58,489 --> 00:20:59,950
Insane Clown Posse.

530
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,823
The reaction from our crew was

531
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:09,729
(crickets)

532
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:11,368

crowds and there's like 75.

538
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:27,582
Then we're coming around
again and there's like 250.

539
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:28,583
We made fuckin' money.

540
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:29,584
Here's your money.

541
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,014
You got something.

542
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:32,455
I think it was 25
bucks or something,

543
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,754
but it was 25 bucks, dammit.

544
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:38,087
Who wants to go get a
fuckin' real job now?

545
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:39,561
- We thought we were rich, man.

546
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:41,024
- We were fuckin' getting paid.

547
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:43,730
We were driving new cars

548
00:21:43,765 --> 00:21:45,864
because, well we
drove one new car

549
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:49,406
and that was for times we
needed to look impressive.

550
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,001
We had a Suzuki Sidekick

551
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:53,575
that way when we pulled
up to the in stores,

552
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,610
you know, we were fresh.

553
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,109
- [Shaggy] This right here
behind us is St. Andrews Hall.

554
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:02,584
Hey, who's playing here tonight?

555
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:03,453
Who?

- (Indistinct)

557
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:06,786
- Lights or something.

558
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:07,655
You know what I'm saying?

559
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,656
- Fudge?

560
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:09,789
- Did they say Fudge?

561
00:22:09,824 --> 00:22:11,560
- The history in this building.

562
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:13,661

- [Linda] It was just a real
thrill the first time I saw it,

573
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:35,551
when I went to the first
concert and I saw the Juggalos

574
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:38,081
in line going
around the building.

575
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:40,523
To me, I just
couldn't believe it.

576
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,054
I couldn't say, "get
a real job" anymore.

577
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:46,892
I wanted them to have the
Bruce Brothers Hobby Shop.

578
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:48,795
I keep asking, "is
that going to happen?"

579
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,436
And they said, "Well, maybe
someday it might happen."

580
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,767
- We had this wonderful
thing going on.

581
00:22:53,802 --> 00:22:55,098
We're making money at it.

582
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:56,440
We're making a living.

583
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,771
We're able to raise our kids.

584
00:22:57,806 --> 00:22:59,135
As far as albums we've sold,

585
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,741
if you combine them all,

586
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:03,007
I think it's something
around 10 million.

587
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:06,076
It might be as
much as 14 million.

588
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:07,979
- [Shaggy] Thirty years
later, we're still working.

589
00:23:08,014 --> 00:23:09,519
Just like we always have.

590
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,180
We still put out
records, we still tour.

591
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:12,753
- [Violent J] We still move
merchandise all over the world.

592
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:14,425
You can't download a t-shirt.

593
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,021
You can't download
a pair of thongs.

594
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:20,662
(energetic hip hop beats)

595
00:23:23,964 --> 00:23:25,700
It doesn't take a rocket
scientist to figure out

596
00:23:25,735 --> 00:23:27,603
why we're still in business

597
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:30,001
and why this act became real.

598
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:35,072
Because it's destiny,
man, it's our destiny.

599
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:39,582
- [Video Narrator]
Psychopathic records presents

600
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:43,685
the infamous, world famous
Gathering of the Juggalos.

601
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,820
And this year's four day
long outdoor music festival

602
00:23:46,855 --> 00:23:50,824
of freshness, flavor and
motherfucking freedom.

603
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:52,463
Fuck work.

604
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:53,596
Tell them your Juggalo
homies said they can

605
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:56,060
eat a dick up till they hiccup.

606
00:23:57,734 --> 00:24:00,603
(whimsical music)

607
00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:24,891
- [Shaggy] The Gathering is a
family reunion for Juggalos.

608
00:24:24,926 --> 00:24:27,190
A weekend of pure bliss, fun

609
00:24:28,996 --> 00:24:30,666
and nonstop flavor.

610
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:36,903
- Where did you get that?

611
00:24:36,938 --> 00:24:38,036
- [Man Behind Camera] Get what?

612
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:39,642
- Get dick in your mouth!

613
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,648
- The reason why The
Gathering is so important

614
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:48,882
is because that is the
one week out of the year

615
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:51,885
where a Juggalo, who
is probably ostracized

616
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,524
in his or her community,

617
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:56,890
can unite with people
who are just like them.

618
00:24:56,925 --> 00:25:00,157
- We're here this weekend
to fucking rage and party

619
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:02,929
and then clean up
after ourselves.

620
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:06,636
(epic orchestra crescendo)

621
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:11,300
- [Rob] It draws between five
and 10,000 people every year.

622
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:13,610
Juggalos that come
to the gathering,

623
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:17,042
they're the most diehard
Juggalos that there are.

624
00:25:17,077 --> 00:25:19,715
- It took me 36
hours to get here.

625
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,882
- Traveling for about 55 hours.

626
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:24,016
- Dude, I quit both
my jobs to be here.

627
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:25,688
- I'm out on bond right now.

628
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:27,690
I'm not even supposed
to be here, real talk.

629
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:30,187
- I think if I died, my soul
would've made the journey.

630
00:25:30,222 --> 00:25:32,123
I'd still be here.

631
00:25:32,158 --> 00:25:33,256
- [Man Behind Camera] You
guys go to The Gathering?

632
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,257
(group exclaiming in unison)

633
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:35,425
- Ah hell no, man.

634
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,029
I heard them Juggalos are
like gang members and shit.

635
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:38,800
- They crazy!

636
00:25:38,835 --> 00:25:41,099
- Yeah we don't
associate with that shit.

637
00:25:41,134 --> 00:25:42,969
- These guys will
always be outcasts.

638
00:25:43,004 --> 00:25:45,136
Juggalos will never be cool,

639
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:47,578
but that's the way
we like it though.

640
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:49,074
Hey brother, you okay?

641
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:50,306
- [Woman] Yeah.

642
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:52,242
- It was a woman.

643
00:25:52,277 --> 00:25:53,144
My bad.

644
00:25:54,785 --> 00:25:56,587
A lot of these women are

645
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:58,820
plus size, shall we say?

646
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:01,185
But they're walking around
in bikinis or topless.

647
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,627
And I love that because
it is such an affront

648
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:07,092
to the bullshit beauty standards
that we have in society.

649
00:26:07,127 --> 00:26:08,929
If they were on a
normal beach somewhere,

650
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:10,667
everybody would be giving
them shit for that.

651
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,702
Here, no one cares.

652
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,165
- [Margee] Lots of
body pride here.

653
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,035
I have seen some women
who are so super proud

654
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,202
of their bodies and
that is very inspiring.

655
00:26:18,237 --> 00:26:20,204
- [Jason] It doesn't
matter how you look.

656
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:22,305
It doesn't matter how
much money you make.

657
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,978
It doesn't matter what part
of the country you come from.

658
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:25,979
You come here,

659
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:28,718
you're just one of us.

660
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,654
It's just like in that old
movie, Freaks, you know.

661
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,822
One of us, one of us,
gooble, gobble, one of us.

662
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:35,956
We accept her, we accept her.

663
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:37,287
♪ One of us ♪

664
00:26:37,322 --> 00:26:40,290

00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:44,833

♪ One of us, one of us ♪

668
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,970
- I think it's important
that people understand

669
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:52,038
that Juggalos are really
the last real subculture

670
00:26:52,073 --> 00:26:53,336
left in America.

671
00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:58,847
Because when you think about
all of the classic subcultures,

672
00:26:58,882 --> 00:27:01,916
you think of punk, you
think of mods and rockers.

673
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:03,786
You think of goths.

674
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:05,183
Groups that were considered
a subculture at one time

675
00:27:05,218 --> 00:27:08,054
have now been absorbed
by the mainstream.

676
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:09,825
In order for a group of people

677
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,893
to be considered a subculture,

678
00:27:11,928 --> 00:27:13,829
the mainstream has to hate you.

679
00:27:13,864 --> 00:27:15,226
You know, you can take
it back to England

680
00:27:15,261 --> 00:27:17,129
in the seventies,

681
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:19,197
when you had the sex
pistols and you had

682
00:27:19,232 --> 00:27:23,938
the Damned and all those
old school British punks.

683
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:25,907
They were not welcomed
with open arms.

684
00:27:25,942 --> 00:27:29,405
The media and the government
wanted them shut down.

685
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,847
We live in an age where
all of those old previous

686
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:35,114
subcultures have ceased
to be subculture.

687
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:37,083
But Juggalos are
still a group that is

688
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:39,921
reviled and misunderstood.

689
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:42,891
And I think that those
are two of the attitudes

690
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:46,356
that are going to create any
subculture that has strength.

691
00:27:46,391 --> 00:27:48,765
They're not going to like you,

692
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,998
and they're not going
to understand you.

693
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:53,297
- [Violent J] Why did the
FBI say Juggalos are a gang?

694
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:56,267
You know, you gotta ask the
fuckin' stupid-ass FBI that

695
00:27:56,302 --> 00:27:59,336
because I don't
know why that is.

696
00:27:59,371 --> 00:28:01,008
- [Shaggy] The FBI
never contacted us,

697
00:28:01,043 --> 00:28:05,309
asked us what Juggalos
were about, anything.

698
00:28:05,344 --> 00:28:08,818
- First I heard the report, I
thought it was just a rumor.

699
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,919
I think I asked
somebody to look it up

700
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:12,756
and it was a official.

701
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,924
Like official, like
a referee whistle.

702
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,420
It was like (whistle).

703
00:28:17,455 --> 00:28:19,488
Hold up, you're
a gangster. What?

704
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:21,061
You're going to jail. What?

705
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:22,458
That's my first thought. What?

706
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,031
Are we going to jail?

707
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:25,461
Are we fuckin' get
locked up for this shit?

708
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:28,431
What does that make
us, gang leaders?

709
00:28:33,471 --> 00:28:35,977
The thing is Juggalos
aren't a gang.

710
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:36,879
- Right.

711
00:28:39,246 --> 00:28:41,081
- It kind of sickens me.

712
00:28:41,116 --> 00:28:43,787
It's added so much to the
prejudice that we already had.

713
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,756
It was already the most
hated band in the world.

714
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,319
And if I wore a Insane
Clown Posse t-shirt

715
00:28:48,354 --> 00:28:50,189
and I walked down the street,

716
00:28:50,224 --> 00:28:52,488
some people would already treat
me like I'm less than them.

717
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:56,063
Now there's a government agency
telling everyone it's okay.

718
00:28:56,098 --> 00:28:57,262
You can be prejudiced
against them.

719
00:28:57,297 --> 00:28:58,430
They're criminal.

720
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:03,807
- If I get labeled a gang
member because of what the FBI

721
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,205
has labeled everybody, I could
lose my security clearance.

722
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,108
I could lose my job.

723
00:29:08,143 --> 00:29:10,044
- I've had somebody make
the comment where I work,

724
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,507
"Oh, well, you're
a gang member."

725
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,146
I've never broken the law.

726
00:29:13,181 --> 00:29:14,950
I've never been to
jail, at least, OK,

727
00:29:14,985 --> 00:29:16,413
I worked in a jail,

728
00:29:16,448 --> 00:29:19,317

to jail unwillingly.

riding my bike.

735
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:32,099
I just had my backpack that
has a hatchet man on it.

736
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:35,003
The policeman pulled me over
and he started questioning me,

737
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:36,565
started searching me.

738
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,810

- You can get stopped on

00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:50,480
a Riddle Box sweatshirt

744
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:53,549
or sporting a Hatchetman
charm around your neck.

745
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,892
Cops can and they do stop you.

746
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,223
They will photograph you
and they'll take a picture

747
00:29:57,258 --> 00:29:59,093
of your tattoo.

748
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:01,359
They'll put you on a gang
list just for wearing clothes.

749
00:30:01,394 --> 00:30:03,999
- What the fuck is that?

750
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:07,200
You got like a mom taking
her 14 year old son,

751
00:30:07,235 --> 00:30:10,302
to go to Hot Topic, to buy
an Insane Clown Posse shirt.

752
00:30:10,337 --> 00:30:12,843
This kid's a gang member?

753
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:16,077
Somehow he's in the
same boat as MS-13?

754
00:30:17,575 --> 00:30:18,442
Bullshit.

755
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:21,577
- Our daughter is
four years old.

756
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,414
So are they gonna consider
her a gang member?

757
00:30:23,449 --> 00:30:25,020
- So I was trying to
reenlist in the military.

758
00:30:25,055 --> 00:30:26,318
All the recruiters
pretty much like, hey,

759

ICP tattoos, no.

Gang affiliated, you know?

761
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:32,225
Cause it's a question on
there, are you affiliated

762
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,260
with any gang or have been?

763
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:36,196
- I got arrested
for a DUI and I got

764
00:30:36,231 --> 00:30:37,901
separated into a gang unit.

765
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,464
Locked up with all
these gang members,

00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:43,005
Nortes and Crips and Bloods.

767

they determine that's a Juggalo,

771
00:30:51,543 --> 00:30:54,016
hundred percent, you're
getting pulled over.

772
00:30:54,051 --> 00:30:55,886
- [Female Juggalo] They
start pulling stuff out.

773
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,316
We're like, this is gonna take
us hours to pack it again.

774
00:30:57,351 --> 00:30:59,087
It took us four hours
to put it in there.

775
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:00,990
We get back on the
expressway and sure enough,

776
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,651
if we don't pass the same
cops and they have a Juggalo

777
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:04,928
pulled over and all their
stuff pulled out of their car.

778
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,524
- People were getting fucked
with on a major level.

779
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:10,032
- We did not understand
the magnitude of how it

780
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:11,561
would fuck up Juggalos.

781
00:31:11,596 --> 00:31:13,266
- Didn't know the
repercussions of it, you know?

782
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:15,268
- And once we started
getting the reports,

783
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:18,601
the jokes stopped and
the freshness ended

784
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,209
and it just started sucking.

- You know if this were to

789
00:31:29,383 --> 00:31:31,152
happen to a band
that America liked,

790
00:31:31,187 --> 00:31:33,649
the country would be
up in arms about this.

791
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,157
But it happened to the
Insane Clown Posse.

792
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,554
So it's a joke.

793
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:39,688
Stop and take us
out of the equation.

794
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:41,624
Look what they're saying.

795
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:44,693
- If the Juggalos qualify
as a criminal street gang,

796
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:46,332
many other groups of fans

797
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:49,203
could be similarly categorized.

798
00:31:49,238 --> 00:31:53,042
For example, fans of
particular sports teams.

799
00:31:59,347 --> 00:32:02,051
A lot of the gangs
use sports memorabilia

800
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,712
as their gang logo.

801
00:32:03,747 --> 00:32:05,615
If you're in a gang neighborhood

802
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,487
wearing that particular
jersey or cap or whatnot,

803
00:32:09,522 --> 00:32:12,963
law enforcement can use
that as probable cause

804
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,691
for stopping and searching.

805
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,199
- The gang label was misguided,

806
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:20,630
but it was also very
intentional because I feel like

807
00:32:20,665 --> 00:32:22,599
America hates the poor.

808
00:32:22,634 --> 00:32:26,141
- Right now I work
in a restaurant.

809
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:27,571
It's okay.

810
00:32:27,606 --> 00:32:29,210

00:32:29,245 --> 00:32:30,409
I admit to doing that.

- I work at taco bell for now.

813
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,348
I mean, it's
something to get by.

814
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:37,119
- I do roofing for a living.

99% Of my friends,

they're in the service
industry, fry cooks,

818
00:32:43,622 --> 00:32:46,623
just on the bottom
chain of society.

819
00:32:46,658 --> 00:32:50,429
So to see any unity between
these people is a major threat.

820
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:53,696
Like if they're going
to come after these kids

821
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:57,601
who put on face paint
and throw cheap soda,

822

I mean really, come on.

823
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:00,670
It's the most harmless thing.

837
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:35,540
Today I got ready for
work with you guys.

838
00:33:35,575 --> 00:33:37,047
I drove to work.

839
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:39,775
I love what I do.

840
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,810
They have me on their pamphlets.

841
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:44,186
It was just like any
normal, typical day.

842
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:45,748
Except for, you know,
you guys watched me

843
00:33:45,783 --> 00:33:48,190
out in the parking lot.

844
00:33:48,225 --> 00:33:50,621
At the end of my workday after
I'd seen all my patients,

845
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:53,723
I received a phone call from
the head of human resources,

846
00:33:53,758 --> 00:33:57,199
wanting to know what this
documentary was about.

847
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:59,333
So I told her it was about
music that we listen to

848
00:33:59,368 --> 00:34:03,436
and how the music is associated
with being in a gang.

849
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:05,801
And they terminated me.

850
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:08,705
- It's like some
crazy communist shit.

851
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,344
I don't know what
a communist is,

852
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,116
but I know this feels
like some big, powerful,

853
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,283
scary government bullshit.

854
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:18,583
- There's no word to
describe how insane,

855
00:34:18,618 --> 00:34:21,289
how crazy, how asinine it is.

856

I'm about to start
making words up.

857

And just think if
we just rolled over

858
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:26,789
and took it up the ass,

859
00:34:26,824 --> 00:34:28,428
where would it stop?

860
00:34:28,463 --> 00:34:32,234
If we don't do something
about it, who's next?

861
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,276

some real shit here, man.

00:34:49,682 --> 00:34:52,188
We're not just laying down

866
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,289
and taking it up the ass.

867
00:34:58,823 --> 00:35:01,626
(crowd chanting)

868
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:07,467
Check it out, we're
taking the name Juggalo

869
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:09,205
the fuck back from
them motherfuckers,

870
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,306
you know what I'm saying?

871
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:16,410
We have the best
legal representation

872
00:35:17,644 --> 00:35:19,248
money can buy.

873
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,678
There he is right here, Farris.

874
00:35:20,713 --> 00:35:23,549
Give it up for our
attorney, ya'll.

875
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,291
- You all have a family
attorney now, all right?

876
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:32,327
We're gonna lay the
law down on the FBI

877
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:33,757
for the whole fam.

878
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,400
(crowd chanting)

879
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:44,702
- People always joke and ask
me if I'm going to show up

880
00:35:44,737 --> 00:35:47,309
to court in face pain
or something like that.

881
00:35:47,344 --> 00:35:51,313
If the opportunity presents
itself, maybe I will, but...

882
00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:53,282
I focus on a lot of DUIs,

883
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,845
a lot of possession
of marijuana cases,

884
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,485
a lot of misdemeanor cases.

885
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,520
I see this big guy at an
ATM with his wife and kids

886
00:36:00,555 --> 00:36:03,259
and figure out that
it's Violent J.

887
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,821
So I said, "You probably
don't meet too many Juggalos

888
00:36:04,856 --> 00:36:06,493
that are lawyers."

889
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,264
And I was like, "Let
me give you my card.

890
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,859
If you ever need
anything, give me a call.

891
00:36:09,894 --> 00:36:11,729
I'll do it for free."

892
00:36:11,764 --> 00:36:15,403
And I figured I'd never
hear from them again, ever.

893
00:36:15,438 --> 00:36:17,735
Violent J announced
that Juggalos could come

894
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,408
to this makeshift
office that I had made

895
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:22,443
at The Gathering and
fill out a statement

896
00:36:22,478 --> 00:36:24,841
and I could interview
them and stuff like that.

897
00:36:24,876 --> 00:36:27,679
There was a line out the
door and around the corner

898
00:36:27,714 --> 00:36:30,319
at that trailer for
people making statements.

899
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:33,817
Story after story of people
that were doing nothing wrong,

900
00:36:33,852 --> 00:36:35,918
but were being treated
like criminals.

901
00:36:35,953 --> 00:36:37,953
We filed a Freedom of
Information Act request

902
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:41,660
to find out why the FBI
put them on the gang list.

903
00:36:41,695 --> 00:36:44,993
What we got was
shocking and surprising.

904
00:36:45,028 --> 00:36:50,207
Literally looked like Google
research of some news articles.

905
00:36:52,574 --> 00:36:55,938
The majority of it
was random alarmist

906
00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:58,974
local news articles off of
the internet saying that

907
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:02,582
there was some crime, whether
it's vandalism, assault,

908
00:37:02,617 --> 00:37:06,850
stealing, larceny, and the
people happened to be Juggalos.

909
00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:10,458
And that was what they
sent us as support for them

910
00:37:10,493 --> 00:37:12,922
putting Juggalos
on the gang list.

911
00:37:12,957 --> 00:37:14,990
Basically what the FBI said
is we're just reporting what

912
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:17,564
these local law enforcement
officers are telling us.

913
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,368
That was their other excuse.

914
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,633
From the outside looking in,

915
00:37:20,668 --> 00:37:22,536
it might look like a gang.

916
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:26,375
It also looks a heck of a
lot like any other fan base.

917
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,643
It starts with Juggalos, but
it's a very slippery slope.

918
00:37:30,678 --> 00:37:32,315
People who listen
to gangster rap.

919
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,483
Lil Wayne claims to be
related to the Bloods.

920
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:36,715
Maybe people going
to his concerts,

921
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,914
maybe some of them are Bloods.

922
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:39,784
Maybe they're all Bloods.

923
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:44,789
And then that's sort of where
this has snowballed into.

924
00:37:45,726 --> 00:37:47,363
That's what's at stake.

925
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,024
Whether we live in a
free country or not.

926
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,927
Whether we live in an
America where everything's

927
00:37:50,962 --> 00:37:51,928
gonna to be censored and
you're going to be afraid

928
00:37:51,963 --> 00:37:53,534
to express who you are.

929
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:55,800
- [Juggalo In Group]
I swear to God.

930
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:57,472
- [Juggalo Interviewee]
The FBI, they might as well

931
00:37:57,507 --> 00:38:00,409
be hating on fans of KISS.

932
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,872
Are they gang members? No.

933
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,511
Why the fuck does that
make us gang members?

934
00:38:03,546 --> 00:38:05,348
It's a bunch of
discrimination bullshit

935
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,844
and there's no reason for it.

936
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:08,582
- You just find a
small group of people

937
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:10,485
that most people don't
give a crap about

938
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,916
and you box them in and you
say those people are bad.

939
00:38:12,951 --> 00:38:14,588
Then you just make
everybody else say,

940
00:38:14,623 --> 00:38:16,458
oh, well screw those
people, they're bad.

941
00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:18,020
Well, if you box everybody
up enough and you make

942
00:38:18,055 --> 00:38:20,495
all these small
individual bad groups,

943
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,498
then everybody's
bad and everybody's
fighting one another.

944
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:26,061
- If having bad taste
in music was a crime,

945
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:30,835
every Parrothead in the world
would be on the gang list.

946
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,679
(crowd whoop whooping)

947
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:43,419
- [Thomas] Here in Los Angeles,

948
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:46,015
MS-13 had a
notorious reputation,

949
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,083
kind of like Insane Clown Posse,

950
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,888
of being kind of
eerie and mysterious

951
00:38:50,923 --> 00:38:52,527
because some of its members,

952
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:56,597
probably less than
1%, were Satanists.

953
00:38:56,632 --> 00:39:00,469
I spent over 16 years
researching the MS-13 gang

954
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,064
on a daily basis.

955
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:05,001
I was hanging out with
active members of MS

956
00:39:05,036 --> 00:39:07,608
from the wannabes to the OGs.

957
00:39:07,643 --> 00:39:09,841
I would bring pizza or soda pop.

958
00:39:09,876 --> 00:39:12,613
The problem was when I was
started getting paged at

959
00:39:12,648 --> 00:39:14,043
two o'clock in the
morning, right?

960
00:39:14,078 --> 00:39:16,485
I need a ride home, Thomas.

961
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:22,425
The FBI assessment of the
Juggalos as a non-traditional,

962
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:27,661
or hybrid gang, states
that many Juggalo subsets

963
00:39:27,696 --> 00:39:29,960
exhibit gang-like behavior

964
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:32,732
and engage in criminal
activity and violence.

965
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:34,800
So what is a street gang?

966
00:39:34,835 --> 00:39:37,132
The federal definition
is an association

967
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,706
of three or more individuals.

968
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,480
Who's members collectively
identify themselves

969
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,516
by adopting a group identity.

970
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,552
(crowds exclaiming)

971
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:56,019
Who's purpose is
in part to engage

972
00:39:56,054 --> 00:40:01,057
in criminal activity and which
uses violence or intimidation

973
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:06,667
to further criminal enterprise.

974
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:08,196
- We're not a
criminal organization.

975
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:09,604
We're not even an organization.

976
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:11,507
We're not organized.

977
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,201
- [Gathering Attendee] Just
because I'm wearing this shirt

978
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:14,840
that's got the Hatchetman
on the back and everything.

979
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,743
It doesn't mean
I'm a gang banger.

980
00:40:16,778 --> 00:40:17,876
It doesn't mean I'm going
to hurt you or kill you.

981
00:40:17,911 --> 00:40:19,009
We're just one big family.

982
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:20,450
We look out for each other.

983
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:21,616
- We look out for each other.

984
00:40:21,651 --> 00:40:23,453
Half of us ain't got parents.

985
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:26,214
Half of us ain't got
nobody to give us nothing.

986
00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:27,985
- [Juggalo] It's just the
loyalty they bring to you.

987
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,559
That's what makes
a person family.

988
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,495
I'm family, she's family.

989
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,464
Hell, shit, all
of you are family.

990
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:35,861
Wanna come by later
and get fucked up?

991
00:40:35,896 --> 00:40:36,994
We can get fucked up.

992
00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:39,161
Don't matter, we're family.

993
00:40:39,196 --> 00:40:40,536
- It means a lot,
we like family.

994
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,834
This is like a family.

995
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:43,099
It means a lot to me.

996
00:40:43,134 --> 00:40:45,574
I love them, they love me.

997
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,609
- The Juggalo family
is the only people

998
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:49,479
that I can trust.

999
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:53,208
That I know if I need
something, they're there.

1000
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:57,146
- There's no more gang
members in Juggalos

1001
00:40:57,181 --> 00:40:59,489
than there is anything else.

1002
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:02,591
We sold 10 million
records, guaranteed.

1003
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,726
10 million people, take
a comb through that?

1004
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:08,795
Whatever you're looking
for is gonna be in there.

1005
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,797
- [Shaggy] They say that
because some kid committed some,

1006
00:41:10,832 --> 00:41:14,031
even a horrific crime, that
happens to be a Juggalo,

1007
00:41:14,066 --> 00:41:17,133
that just means all Juggalos
are criminals and gang members?

1008
00:41:17,168 --> 00:41:18,772
It's crazy.

1009
00:41:18,807 --> 00:41:20,741
People that listen to
Mozart kill people.

1010
00:41:20,776 --> 00:41:24,239
I'm sure Jack the Ripper
loves some Mozart.

1011
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,045
- [TV Reporter] Two
men calling themselves

1012
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,916
Juggalos are arrested after
the body of 21 year old,

1013
00:41:30,951 --> 00:41:33,721
Michael Goucher is
found in the woods

1014
00:41:33,756 --> 00:41:36,020
stabbed more than 20 times.

1015
00:41:36,055 --> 00:41:39,023
- We've got multiple individuals

1016
00:41:39,058 --> 00:41:41,630
committing gang related crimes,

1017
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,093
gang motivated crimes.

1018
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:45,964
And they're using
the name Juggalo.

1019
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:48,032
- The media spotlight
is on this thing.

1020
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:49,869
The media blew it up.

1021
00:41:49,904 --> 00:41:52,641
It got everybody in an uproar.

1022
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,236
- [Male TV Reporter] A Juggalo
is responsible for attacking

1023
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:56,744
a man on a bike
with a meat cleaver.

1024
00:41:56,779 --> 00:41:58,108
- [Male TV Anchor] The
FBI cited a robbery and

1025
00:41:58,143 --> 00:41:59,945
a beating of a homeless man.

1026
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,782
They also cited a Juggalo
who shot and wounded

1027
00:42:01,817 --> 00:42:03,652
a couple in Washington state.

1028
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,115
- [Male News Reporter] The
two suspects involved actually

1029
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:08,019
had their faces painted
like clowns at the time.

1030
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:09,988
- [Female News Anchor]
Shops, restaurants and bars

1031
00:42:10,023 --> 00:42:13,222
under attack in one of
Portland's trendiest
neighborhoods.

1032
00:42:13,257 --> 00:42:14,289
- [Male TV Reporter]
A threatening message

1033
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,159
laced with profanity.

1034
00:42:16,194 --> 00:42:19,063
A group called the Juggalo
family, taking responsibility.

1035
00:42:19,098 --> 00:42:20,933
- We're just doing
what we do, man.

1036
00:42:20,968 --> 00:42:22,902
We're doing it for the
Juggalos, you know?

1037
00:42:22,937 --> 00:42:25,036
Every business sells
to their clientele.

1038
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:26,873
Well that's all we're doing.

1039
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:28,710
- We're not going to
water down what we do.

1040
00:42:28,745 --> 00:42:30,206
If people like it, they like it.

1041
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:32,175
If not, fuck 'em
anyhow, you know?

1042
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,881
- [Bashir] A number of people
who have been associated with

1043
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:36,652
acts of violence and murder

1044
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:40,018
have had some kind of
connection to ICP and Juggalos.

1045
00:42:40,053 --> 00:42:42,790
They're no longer regarded as
innocent lovers of your music.

1046
00:42:42,825 --> 00:42:44,693
- I say bull(beep).

1047
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,826
I say it's not true.

1048
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:47,597
- Let me give you an example.

1049
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,291
In February, 2006.

00:42:49,326 --> 00:42:52,228

00:42:54,804 --> 00:42:56,133

00:43:45,855 --> 00:43:47,723
Utah Gang Conference.

1066
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,890
This is our opportunity to
teach our community partners

1067
00:43:49,925 --> 00:43:52,860
about current gang trends
and give them the information

1068

and how it's gang involved.

1073

If you have questions about
what some of this means,

1074
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:08,436
there's a definition book.

1075
00:44:08,471 --> 00:44:11,274
And for the safety
of the presenter,

1076
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:14,079
do not share any information
about the presenters.

- [Man Behind Camera]
Oh shit, turn it off.

1078
00:44:15,115 --> 00:44:16,950
- Take pictures, videos.

1079
00:44:16,985 --> 00:44:18,347
- [Lt. Schoenfeld] I think
that the focus of that

1080
00:44:18,382 --> 00:44:19,986
threat assessment
was on Salt Lake City

1081
00:44:20,021 --> 00:44:21,889
because we were seeing
heavy activity from our

1082
00:44:21,924 --> 00:44:25,992
Juggalo groups that made us
identify them as gang members.

1083
00:44:26,027 --> 00:44:29,358
From about 1996 until
kind of the mid 2000s,

1084
00:44:29,393 --> 00:44:32,999
we dealt with Juggalos out
on our west side a lot.

1085
00:44:33,034 --> 00:44:35,771
- [Nelson] There were some
problems between Juggalos

1086
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,465
and members of other
gangs that became

1087
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,941
relatively common for a
couple years in Salt Lake

1088
00:44:40,976 --> 00:44:44,043
to have people who affiliated
themselves with Juggalos

1089
00:44:44,078 --> 00:44:45,847
to be fighting with somebody

1090
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:48,685
who was a member
of another gang.

1091
00:44:50,953 --> 00:44:54,317
In the summer of 2008,
there was a serious assault

1092
00:44:54,352 --> 00:44:56,385
involving two Juggalos
that I charged

1093
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,827
as an attempted murder.

1094
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:03,491
Two Juggalos attacked a young
man with a large hunting knife

1095
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:07,231
and a battle axe that was
mounted onto a golf club.

1096
00:45:07,266 --> 00:45:09,101
Stabbed him multiple times,

1097
00:45:09,136 --> 00:45:13,171
took multiple swings at
his shoulder and neck area.

1098
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,208
- We get a call of aggravated
assault in progress.

1099
00:45:17,243 --> 00:45:19,980
Initial information
given by our dispatch was

1100
00:45:20,015 --> 00:45:22,411
two male suspects, tan Nissan.

1101
00:45:23,986 --> 00:45:26,118
My partner finds
a Juggalo pendant.

1102
00:45:26,153 --> 00:45:30,419
It's a Hatchetman hanging
on the fence of the house.

1103
00:45:32,225 --> 00:45:33,994
I see this tan Nissan
approach me and I'm like,

1104
00:45:34,029 --> 00:45:35,897
no, this can't be true.

1105
00:45:35,932 --> 00:45:38,768
And I see the Hatchetman
on the back of the window.

1106
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:41,903
And so I was like, you know
I got to pull this car over.

1107
00:45:41,938 --> 00:45:43,300
We're like face to face.

1108
00:45:43,335 --> 00:45:45,335
And I noticed as
I'm talking to him,

1109
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,371
I could still see some dry
blood splatter on his face.

1110
00:45:48,406 --> 00:45:50,780
I end up doing a
search of the vehicle.

1111
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:52,210
I pull out all these weapons,

1112
00:45:52,245 --> 00:45:53,816
lay them out on the
trunk of the car.

1113
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,345
Daggers, hatchets.

1114
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,986
There was just a whole
arsenal of weapons.

1115
00:46:02,992 --> 00:46:04,860
- [Nelson] The victim's
neck was just filleted open

1116
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,290
from the axe.

1117
00:46:06,325 --> 00:46:08,831
It was one of the
more bloody and

1118
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:12,329
disturbing crime
scenes I've ever seen.

1119
00:46:12,364 --> 00:46:15,497
I mean, it looks
like a slasher movie.

1120
00:46:17,303 --> 00:46:18,434
- [Det. Afatasi] We follow
a national definition.

1121
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:19,875

common name symbol identifier,

1123
00:46:21,373 --> 00:46:23,274
that engage in
criminal activity.

1124
00:46:23,309 --> 00:46:26,310
You know, Juggalos, they fit
under those three criterias.

1125
00:46:26,345 --> 00:46:29,885
It's fair to say that
some were gang members.

1126
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,051
They're violent.

1127
00:46:31,086 --> 00:46:33,152

- [Violent J] Sometimes.

1133
00:46:44,528 --> 00:46:47,430
Maybe in my subconscious
anger, but not in real life.

1134
00:46:47,465 --> 00:46:49,300
We're sitting here
in clown paint.

1135
00:46:49,335 --> 00:46:52,600

- That's dope, man. Welcome
to the world of rap.

1138
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:00,476
- What does it mean if you
call a song Imma Kill U?

1139
00:47:00,511 --> 00:47:02,918
- [Shaggy] It means
I'ma kill you.

1140
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:05,448
But I mean how you take
that, I mean are you

You're gonna go out and do it?

- [Violent J] Are you some
kinda murderer to begin with?

1144
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:12,389

1150
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,369
- So you don't really mean-

1151
00:47:25,404 --> 00:47:26,634
- No we'd be in
prison right now.

1152
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:28,570
- We'd be in prison for life.

1153
00:47:28,605 --> 00:47:31,474
- I myself was molested as a
child, you know what I mean?

1154
00:47:31,509 --> 00:47:32,475
- Really?

1155
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,048
- Yeah, absolutely.

1156
00:47:35,678 --> 00:47:38,019
- [Linda] I always wonder if
it would have been different.

1157
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:41,220
You know you always think,
I wonder if I hadn't married

1158
00:47:41,255 --> 00:47:45,587
an asshole, if their lives
would have been different.

1159
00:47:47,393 --> 00:47:49,998
- This guy was like the worst
kind of human being ever.

1160
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,428
You know what I mean?

1161
00:47:51,463 --> 00:47:54,497
He'd get super angry
at Duke, our dog

1162
00:47:54,532 --> 00:47:58,039
and he used to chase him around
the yard and like kick him.

1163
00:47:58,074 --> 00:48:01,570
For us, We just stayed out
of the house all the time.

1164
00:48:01,605 --> 00:48:03,913
One of the kind of
lingering damages

1165
00:48:03,948 --> 00:48:07,950
is I don't like to be
touched by guys at all.

1166
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:09,149
I just snap.

1167
00:48:09,184 --> 00:48:10,051
You know.

1168
00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:21,161
- [Margee] My name is Margee
Kerr and I'm a sociologist

1169
00:48:21,196 --> 00:48:24,967
and I'm working on a book
about how and why we engage

1170
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:27,497
with thrilling and
scary material.

1171
00:48:27,532 --> 00:48:29,103
And coming to The Gathering...

1172
00:48:29,138 --> 00:48:31,468
(passing motorist hollers)

1173
00:48:31,503 --> 00:48:34,174
I was reading about
how negative things

1174
00:48:34,209 --> 00:48:35,505
happen at The Gathering.

1175
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,045
But Juggalos themselves
would state that

1176
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,409
they loved each other.

1177
00:48:38,444 --> 00:48:40,246
It was all about family,
all about respect.

1178
00:48:40,281 --> 00:48:43,150
So I saw this huge discrepancy
between what the people

1179
00:48:43,185 --> 00:48:45,251
themselves were saying and
what outsiders were saying.

1180
00:48:45,286 --> 00:48:47,154
And for a sociologist,
that's like a huge red flag.

1181
00:48:47,189 --> 00:48:50,388
So I wanted to come
and see for myself.

1182
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:54,491
I see a lot of parallels
between the motivations

1183
00:48:54,526 --> 00:48:57,626
behind hardcore kind of
gangster rap and ICP.

1184
00:48:57,661 --> 00:48:59,727
Both are speaking about
their experiences,

1185
00:48:59,762 --> 00:49:02,301
living in a lower
socioeconomic status,

1186
00:49:02,336 --> 00:49:06,404
being discriminated against,
having people judge them.

1187
00:49:06,439 --> 00:49:08,175
- You ever been broke?

1188
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,177
You ever had a family member,

1189
00:49:10,212 --> 00:49:12,674
maybe alcoholic
or drug addicted,

1190
00:49:12,709 --> 00:49:14,346
that's impacting your life?

1191
00:49:14,381 --> 00:49:16,381
Somebody who's just struggling,

1192
00:49:16,416 --> 00:49:19,186
just trying to make it till the
next week or the next month.

1193
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:20,319
- You're not one of
the popular kids.

1194
00:49:20,354 --> 00:49:21,452
You're not playing sports.

1195
00:49:21,487 --> 00:49:23,388
You're not in any of the clubs.

1196
00:49:23,423 --> 00:49:25,720
- Growing up, I was kind of
tortured, made fun of a lot.

1197
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:28,492
My mom moved me from
school to school.

1198
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:31,660
- I was raised in Philadelphia,
in the Catholic Church,

1199
00:49:31,695 --> 00:49:33,332
in the 80s and the 90s.

1200
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:36,137
And what went down
there was fucked.

1201
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:38,271
We're so angry and we're so
hurt because as children,

1202
00:49:38,306 --> 00:49:40,174
we were abused.

- [Margee] I think
that for a lot of fans,

1209
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,749
they probably are connecting
to the violent lyrics

1210
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:57,026
because it may be
similar to the things

1211
00:49:57,061 --> 00:49:58,720
that they've
experienced themselves.

1212
00:49:58,755 --> 00:50:00,326
You know, it seems like
there are some people here

1213
00:50:00,361 --> 00:50:02,229
who've had some
pretty tough times,

1214
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:04,033
and I think that they are
connecting to the music

1215
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:06,299
just as any fan base
would connect to lyrics

1216
00:50:06,334 --> 00:50:08,169
that are going to speak to them.

1217

- [Violent J] We make

1218

Broken homes, hard times,

dealing with painful
shit in their life.

1220
00:50:14,408 --> 00:50:16,342
It's real anger.

1221
00:50:16,377 --> 00:50:18,773

you're curious and
you want to go there,

It's a different place to go.

1232
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,601
It's make-believe

1233
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,440

blows all of our minds

1239
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:03,290
how somebody can
make a horror movie

1240
00:51:03,325 --> 00:51:06,194
and it's all graphic and gory

1241
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,097
and that's okay and acceptable.

1242
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:11,793
But we can't sing a song about
mass murder makes me happy.

1243

That's catchy.

1244
00:51:12,697 --> 00:51:14,334
It's funny.

1245
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:16,534
- In a way ICP's
music was so healing.

1246
00:51:16,569 --> 00:51:18,470
I didn't need to
stand up and rage out

1247
00:51:18,505 --> 00:51:20,637
because it's kind of like
the clowns did it for me.

1248
00:51:20,672 --> 00:51:22,870
They allowed me to
laugh at all that pain

1249
00:51:22,905 --> 00:51:24,674
and laugh through that pain.

1250
00:51:24,709 --> 00:51:27,611
- It allowed me to vent things,
get things off my chest.

All the other music,

no matter how cool the beat is,

00:51:30,781 --> 00:51:32,385
when you listen to
what they're saying,

1254
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,749
you're not really
relating to it.

1255
00:51:33,784 --> 00:51:35,355
These guys are
talking about, hey,

- [Ruby] Did you
sing the Rusty song?

1261
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:05,517
- Rusty dog.

1262
00:52:05,552 --> 00:52:08,157
What are you doing, Rusty dog?

1263
00:52:09,655 --> 00:52:11,688
I'll tell you how we met.

1264
00:52:11,723 --> 00:52:14,328
She was working at a Friday's.

1265
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:16,528
- TGIFriday's in Minneapolis.

1266
00:52:16,563 --> 00:52:18,167
- And she was the girl
at the front that's like,

1267
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:20,367
"Hi, can I seat you?"

1268
00:52:20,402 --> 00:52:22,237
And she sat us down, all set.

1269
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:25,240
Put the tables together
and I was like, man,

1270
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:26,769
I gotta step today.

1271
00:52:26,804 --> 00:52:29,574
- No, I didn't sit you down.

1272
00:52:29,609 --> 00:52:31,708
- Obsolete information.

1273
00:52:31,743 --> 00:52:33,710
- [Michelle] I have a
better memory than you.

1274
00:52:33,745 --> 00:52:35,811
- [Violent J] And
then I was like,

1275
00:52:35,846 --> 00:52:37,714
"What're you doing tonight?"

1276
00:52:37,749 --> 00:52:39,353
What made me super fresh was

1277
00:52:39,388 --> 00:52:41,388
I was leaning like this,

1278
00:52:42,721 --> 00:52:44,424
but I wasn't leaning
against nothing.

1279
00:52:44,459 --> 00:52:47,790
I was just leaning
against air like that.

1280
00:52:49,794 --> 00:52:51,365
And I was like,

1281
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,861
"Why don't you come with
me to this concert?"

1282
00:52:52,896 --> 00:52:54,500
- I said, who, what concert?

1283
00:52:54,535 --> 00:52:55,732
- "What concert
are we going to?"

1284
00:52:55,767 --> 00:52:57,701
And I was like, "mine".

1285
00:53:00,805 --> 00:53:02,508
She came to the show,

1286
00:53:02,543 --> 00:53:05,313
jumped on the bus with me.

1287
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,909
And then all you saw
was lights and exhaust

1288
00:53:07,944 --> 00:53:11,781
as we pulled out of town
together, never to come back.

1289

00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:07,408
Because I've stopped
listening now to his music.

I used to listen

1314

But there's so much
more underlying.

1333
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:02,793
- [Linda] One of the things
that I always thought was true

1334
00:55:02,828 --> 00:55:05,433
was when you have to
make a major decision,

1335
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,865
your first instinct
on it is from God.

1336
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,900
And then the rest of
your doubt is the devil

1337
00:55:10,935 --> 00:55:12,803
trying to talk you out of it.

1338
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:14,475
And I was brought up knowing

1339
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:16,873
that there's something
bigger than us.

1340
00:55:16,908 --> 00:55:19,513
You know, it's something more.

1341
00:55:20,747 --> 00:55:22,978
- [Violent J]
Juggalos, they hear it.

1342
00:55:23,013 --> 00:55:25,387
The messages in the lyrics.

1343
00:55:27,017 --> 00:55:29,490
Each album gives people a
chance to look at themselves

1344
00:55:29,525 --> 00:55:31,624
in different ways.

1345
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:34,726
If our music sounds like
endless garbage to you,

1346
00:55:34,761 --> 00:55:36,893
you're not a Juggalo.

1347
00:55:36,928 --> 00:55:38,532
You're not meant to hear it.

1348
00:55:38,567 --> 00:55:40,765
- When somebody first
handed me an ICP CD,

1349
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,602
I realized it was starting
to answer questions

1350
00:55:42,637 --> 00:55:44,131
I didn't know I had.

1351
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:45,473
What is death?

1352
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,101
What forever really means.

1353
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:49,004
What's going on
in the afterlife?

1354
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:50,775
- It tells you a way

You know, treat

Make sure that you live

Don't judge people.

There's like all his
comedy in all their music.

1378

And then there's
all this violence.

I'm a collector of
ICP memorabilia.

1437
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,921
I think even if I
didn't like the band,

1438
00:59:22,956 --> 00:59:24,626
I would like their merchandise.

This was in the backstage

That's off of

1445
00:59:40,204 --> 00:59:41,742
It's a very small town.

1446
00:59:41,777 --> 00:59:43,139
You do tend to get looks

1447
00:59:43,174 --> 00:59:46,241
when you dress
differently than most.

1448
00:59:46,276 --> 00:59:48,078
Like people you're
holding the door open for,

1449
00:59:48,113 --> 00:59:49,277
they give you just
the strangest.

1450
00:59:49,312 --> 00:59:50,179
What the?

1451
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:53,985
They're like, "Oh that's
a nice Kokopelli."

1452
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,888
You're like, "Dude, it's
not a Kokopelli, all right?"

1453
00:59:55,923 --> 01:00:00,189
My Hatchetman will stab
your Kokopelli, all right?

1454
01:00:00,224 --> 01:00:03,390
My name is Shawn Wolf,
AKA Sly Guy Smooth.

1455
01:00:03,425 --> 01:00:06,393
I've been a Juggalo
since I was 16.

1456
01:00:06,428 --> 01:00:09,737
I have raised my kids that way.

1457
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,673
They know all about it.

1458
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:12,674
Hi, Jade Bug.

1459
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:13,675
- Hi.

1460
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:14,676
- How was school?

1461
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:16,843
That's my Jade Bug.

1462
01:00:16,878 --> 01:00:18,647
What are you 17 now?

1463
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:19,780
- Yeah.

1464
01:00:19,815 --> 01:00:21,210
- [Shawn] By two years old,

1465
01:00:21,245 --> 01:00:23,212
she knew who Violent
J and Shaggy were.

1466
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:25,280
We had a poster up, you're
like "Oh well who's that?"

1467
01:00:25,315 --> 01:00:26,380
"That's Violent J."

1468
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:27,381
"And who's that?"

1469
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:29,284
"That's Shaggy 2 Dope."

1470
01:00:29,319 --> 01:00:31,693
- I'm glad that he's into
the same music I am or else

1471
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,222
we would be butting
heads a lot with

1472
01:00:33,257 --> 01:00:36,126
how loud we play our music.

1473
01:00:36,161 --> 01:00:37,963
- [Shawn] Zach's
birthday is today.

1474
01:00:37,998 --> 01:00:39,228
Same as Shaggy 2 Dope's.

1475
01:00:39,263 --> 01:00:41,197
And he just turned 15.

1476
01:00:41,232 --> 01:00:45,168
- My dad bought me
tickets and a VIP pass

1477
01:00:45,203 --> 01:00:48,072
to the ICP concert
tomorrow night.

1478
01:00:50,076 --> 01:00:52,076
Yes, I'm extremely excited.

1479
01:00:52,111 --> 01:00:54,375
I can't really express
excitement though.

1480
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:57,015
I don't know, it's kind of
a weird thing that I have.

1481
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,687
- [Shawn] How are you buddy?

1482
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:00,348
- [Cody] Not bad,
how are you, Dad?

1483
01:01:00,383 --> 01:01:02,053
- [Shawn] Cody is my oldest
one, he just turned 18.

1484
01:01:02,088 --> 01:01:02,922
- How was school?

1485
01:01:02,957 --> 01:01:03,824
- Not bad.

1486
01:01:04,893 --> 01:01:06,288
- [Shawn] Me and Cody's mom had

1487
01:01:06,323 --> 01:01:09,258
like a one-time
deal after school.

1488
01:01:09,293 --> 01:01:13,262
I was only 15 at the
time and just stupid kid.

1489
01:01:13,297 --> 01:01:17,266
Young, dumb, full of come
kind of thing, you know?

1490
01:01:17,301 --> 01:01:19,136
And so she got knocked up.

1491
01:01:19,171 --> 01:01:22,205
I went over there one day and
she'd moved to California.

1492
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,274
Just didn't tell me or nothing
like that, just took off.

1493
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:26,880
When he was about seven,

1494
01:01:26,915 --> 01:01:30,015
she decided to put
him into a boys' home.

1495
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:32,116
- Don't throw it too high.

1496
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:33,986
- [Shawn] She just
abandoned him.

1497
01:01:34,021 --> 01:01:36,417
Didn't come back and try and
visit him or nothing like that.

1498
01:01:36,452 --> 01:01:38,826
And they actually started
trying to work with me

1499
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,729
to get custody of him.

1500
01:01:41,457 --> 01:01:42,764
I want my kids.

1501
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,359
I was raised without a dad

1502
01:01:44,394 --> 01:01:46,999
and I would never
do that to my kids.

1503
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:48,770
Somewhere after about a year,

1504
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:51,201
they finally sent
somebody out here

1505
01:01:51,236 --> 01:01:53,434
to come in, like inspect
your home and make sure

1506
01:01:53,469 --> 01:01:55,370
it's livable for him.

1507
01:01:55,405 --> 01:01:58,175
We invited this
lady into our house.

1508
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:00,276
You see my living
room and stuff.

1509
01:02:00,311 --> 01:02:04,379
It has nothing to do with ICP.
It's totally family oriented.

1510
01:02:04,414 --> 01:02:08,251
Once I brought her into my
room and she saw, you know,

1511
01:02:08,286 --> 01:02:13,223
all of this and it was a bit
overwhelming for her, I think.

1512
01:02:15,062 --> 01:02:16,292
They flat out told me, no,
we're not going to give you

1513
01:02:16,327 --> 01:02:18,525
custody of your kid.

1514
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,804
I mean, my heart just dropped
to the floor, you know?

1515
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:25,235
And then they told me why.

1516
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:28,942
I would portray possible
gang affiliations.

1517
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,082
Man, it's just a straight
kick in the nuts.

1518
01:02:37,117 --> 01:02:40,085
You know, I really don't even
know how to describe that

1519
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,824
besides flat out, you
put me on the ground

1520
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:44,892
and beat the hell out of me.

1521
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:49,523
I'd much rather have that than
someone denying me my kid.

1522
01:02:52,528 --> 01:02:54,935
- For most of my life, I
mainly felt like I was alone.

1523
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:57,267
There was no one I could
talk to, not even therapists.

1524
01:02:57,302 --> 01:03:00,006
I've been in group homes
pretty much since I was six.

1525
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:02,877
And my one shot at
getting out was him

1526
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:05,572
and it was all just
vanished as soon as

1527
01:03:05,607 --> 01:03:07,178
they said that he
couldn't have it

1528
01:03:07,213 --> 01:03:10,247
all because of some ICP thing.

1529
01:03:10,282 --> 01:03:13,448
A group home is pretty much
where kids go who have been

1530
01:03:13,483 --> 01:03:17,254
labeled all these
labels like ADHD, PTSD.

1531
01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:19,322
Little kids to 18.

1532
01:03:19,357 --> 01:03:23,524
In a way it's kind of like
a leeway juvenile place.

1533
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:25,999
Due to some of it, I don't
think I was able to mature

1534
01:03:26,034 --> 01:03:29,530
as quickly as a lot of other
people, such as my sister,

1535
01:03:29,565 --> 01:03:33,237
who's always been around a
family member or has always had

1536
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:36,878
someone there whenever
she needed to talk.

1537
01:03:40,015 --> 01:03:41,949
- People are talking
about, well, why don't you

1538
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,577
just get rid of the ICP stuff?

1539
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:45,546
ICP is not the problem.

1540
01:03:47,187 --> 01:03:50,551
As it is now, he just turned 18.

1541
01:03:50,586 --> 01:03:53,026
I personally never
got custody of him.

1542
01:03:53,061 --> 01:03:55,193
- [Zach] Flip up a burger.

1543
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,099
- As we come around,
we got our VIP Faygos.

1544
01:04:00,134 --> 01:04:01,969
And the vest that I'm wearing

1545
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:05,368
is actually Violent
J's vest that he wore.

1546
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:08,173
Hello?

1547
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:10,076
Hey man. Yeah, I'm doing an
interview right now, man.

1548
01:04:10,111 --> 01:04:12,474
Let me call you back.

1549
01:04:12,509 --> 01:04:14,410
What?

1550
01:04:14,445 --> 01:04:16,951
So my friend Kyle just called
up and said that the ICP show

1551
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:19,888
in Mesa just got canceled.

1552
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:22,451
This is my kids' first ICP show.

1553
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:27,423
That's crushing right now.

1554
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:29,062
We have no idea why yet.

1555
01:04:29,097 --> 01:04:30,998
- [Woman On Phone]
Can I help you?

1556
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:34,067
- Yeah, I'm actually calling
about the ICP show tomorrow.

1557
01:04:34,102 --> 01:04:35,299
I heard he got canceled.

1558
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:36,938
Is that correct?

1559
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,599
- [Woman On Phone] Yes,
it has been canceled.

1560
01:04:38,634 --> 01:04:40,370
We were only told that because
of the logistical issues.

1561
01:04:40,405 --> 01:04:42,075
We're not told why.

1562
01:04:43,144 --> 01:04:45,210
- All right, thank you much.

1563
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:48,378
- Well that's not very fair.

1564
01:04:48,413 --> 01:04:49,544
- [Shawn] Maybe they
can use our tickets

1565
01:04:49,579 --> 01:04:51,447
for the Tuscon show.

1566
01:04:51,482 --> 01:04:54,054
Get ahold of the
promoter or something.

1567
01:04:54,089 --> 01:04:57,684
Fuzzy, I know, oh, I
can get a hold of Fuzzy.

1568
01:04:57,719 --> 01:05:00,192
- I have no idea who that is.

1569
01:05:00,227 --> 01:05:01,655
- [Female TV Host] What
specifically are your concerns

1570
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:04,064
about a group like
this coming here?

1571

- [Female News Anchor] The
concert is called Shockfest

1573
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:10,433
and one of the headlining bands
is the Insane Clown Posse,

1574
01:05:10,468 --> 01:05:13,271
which is known for its
fans, the 'Juggaloos'.

1575

1578
01:05:25,384 --> 01:05:27,021
- People get most
of their information

1579
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:28,451
about street gangs
from the media.

1580
01:05:28,486 --> 01:05:30,585
We're hardwired to pay
attention to threat.

1581
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:34,193
And so the media uses that
to get audience share.

1582
01:05:34,228 --> 01:05:37,031
So they have an agenda to
find the most sensationalistic

1583
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,396
stories to tell about
the street gangs.

1584

A look at the Juggalos

and the danger they
present to Northern Nevada.

1586
01:05:43,138 --> 01:05:46,172
- Come October 8th, 3,000
of them will be admitted

1587
01:05:46,207 --> 01:05:48,141
inside of these doors.

1588
01:05:48,176 --> 01:05:50,572
- According to one
city councilman,
violence is a concern.

1589
01:05:50,607 --> 01:05:52,244
- [Leonardo] We have
too much violence

1590
01:05:52,279 --> 01:05:53,443
in Fort Myers as it is.

1591
01:05:53,478 --> 01:05:55,082
Why do we want to add to it?

1592
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,512
- [Female News Reporter]
In an email, he wrote,

1593
01:05:56,547 --> 01:05:58,415
I Googled Juggalos and
did not like what I saw.

1594
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:01,088
- [Male TV Reporter] And
because this is a city facility,

1595
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,189
the city council
could decide to cancel

1596
01:06:03,224 --> 01:06:05,158
the concert altogether.

1597
01:06:06,689 --> 01:06:09,624
- [Jason] We found a
spot in Kaiser, Missouri

1598
01:06:09,659 --> 01:06:11,461
for The Gathering.

1599
01:06:11,496 --> 01:06:14,002
The camp owners, they knew
exactly what the Juggalos were.

1600
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:15,465
I didn't hold anything back.

1601
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,137
And mind you, Kaiser is
where the Hell's Angels

1602
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:19,403
have held their
national biker rally.

1603
01:06:19,438 --> 01:06:23,110
And it's like, OK so Hell's
Angels are welcome, no problem.

1604
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,606
The media caught wind of it.

1605
01:06:24,641 --> 01:06:26,674
It was generating all this fear.

1606
01:06:26,709 --> 01:06:29,380
And so you have all
these people in Kaiser,

1607
01:06:29,415 --> 01:06:30,711
they're just reading
the headlines

1608
01:06:30,746 --> 01:06:32,383
and they see Juggalos, gang.

1609
01:06:32,418 --> 01:06:34,682
Those two words side by side.

1610
01:06:34,717 --> 01:06:38,191
The townsfolk were actually
calling the camp owners

1611
01:06:38,226 --> 01:06:40,556
and saying they were arming
themselves, getting ready

1612
01:06:40,591 --> 01:06:42,459
for the gang to come in.

1613
01:06:42,494 --> 01:06:44,494
(gunshots)

1614
01:06:44,529 --> 01:06:47,035
Like they thought Juggalos
were gonna come storming

1615
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:49,235
in there and start destroying

1616
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:51,204
like roaming the
streets at night

1617
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:54,702
causing destruction
and havoc or something.

1618
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:02,644
The campground owners pulled
the plug on the whole thing.

1619
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:06,681
And we were left without
a Gathering grounds.

1620
01:07:06,716 --> 01:07:07,814
We were crushed.

1621
01:07:07,849 --> 01:07:10,058
We absolutely were crushed.

1622
01:07:11,457 --> 01:07:13,259
Since the Juggalos were
first labeled as a gang,

1623
01:07:13,294 --> 01:07:15,393
more and more The
Gathering suffered.

1624
01:07:15,428 --> 01:07:17,791
Like last year we
ended up losing a lot.

1625
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:19,760
- We lost a great deal of money.

1626
01:07:19,795 --> 01:07:23,071
I believe something along
the lines of $700,000.

1627
01:07:23,106 --> 01:07:24,468
Then it was reported
on the news that

1628
01:07:24,503 --> 01:07:26,371
we couldn't pay all the vendors

1629
01:07:26,406 --> 01:07:29,110
and we were having
financial problems.

1630
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:32,212
We're not a multi-billion
dollar company, you know?

1631
01:07:32,247 --> 01:07:35,512
- [Shaggy] That's not like
a Pepsi's money that lost.

1632
01:07:35,547 --> 01:07:37,382
That's not Dorito's.

1633
01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:39,252
There is no corporate
sponsor to The Gathering.

1634
01:07:39,287 --> 01:07:42,420
That's fresh out of his
pocket and my pocket.

1635
01:07:42,455 --> 01:07:45,291
- If The Gathering
tanks, we lose our ass.

1636
01:07:45,326 --> 01:07:47,227
- You don't know what's going
to happen at The Gathering.

1637
01:07:47,262 --> 01:07:48,426
Is it going to get raided?

1638
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:50,098
Everybody's talking about it.

1639
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:51,363
I don't believe it
will ever happen,

1640
01:07:51,398 --> 01:07:53,629
but I wouldn't want it to happen

1641
01:07:53,664 --> 01:07:55,235
and it very much could.

1642
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:57,534
- Retailers dropping
our line of merchandise

1643
01:07:57,569 --> 01:07:59,767
because it's gang paraphernalia.

1644
01:07:59,802 --> 01:08:02,143
- We used to have such a
good working relationship

1645
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:03,573
with Hot Topic.

1646
01:08:03,608 --> 01:08:06,312
And now, since the
gang thing came out,

1647
01:08:06,347 --> 01:08:08,479
they don't even carry us.

1648
01:08:08,514 --> 01:08:10,349
- [Shaggy] Dropped it.

1649
01:08:10,384 --> 01:08:11,746
- [Violent J] It's really
fuckin' up our business, man.

1650
01:08:11,781 --> 01:08:13,847
My daughter's only seven.

1651
01:08:15,422 --> 01:08:17,389
And I have to maintain
this till she's 18.

1652
01:08:17,424 --> 01:08:19,259
I had to be able to
take care of her.

1653
01:08:19,294 --> 01:08:21,162
It gets harder and harder
every year, you know?

1654
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:23,164
We got to keep staying relevant.

1655
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,562
Keep making the
right moves and plays

1656
01:08:25,597 --> 01:08:27,861
because we got a long way to go.

1657
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:31,337
Like without this, I don't
know what I'd be doing.

1658
01:08:31,372 --> 01:08:32,239
You know?

1659
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,546
- [Shawn] One time, man,
I'm standing there and

1660
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:44,185
I'm like in the front row.

1661
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,418
I got hit with a full
two liter of Faygo

1662
01:08:46,453 --> 01:08:47,683
on top of my head, dude.

1663
01:08:47,718 --> 01:08:49,520
Almost knocked me the hell out.

1664
01:08:49,555 --> 01:08:51,390
I wasn't paying attention.

1665
01:08:51,425 --> 01:08:53,326
That sucker came right down
on top of my head, dude.

1666
01:08:53,361 --> 01:08:57,528
I got messed up, but then I
got a full Faygo out of it.

1667
01:08:57,563 --> 01:09:00,630
Oh, It's All Over,

1685

Their first show.

1686
01:09:44,742 --> 01:09:46,577
- [Jade] I'm kind of nervous.

1687
01:09:46,612 --> 01:09:50,218
- [Violent J] This shirt
had to be your dad's, right?

1688
01:09:50,253 --> 01:09:51,912
When a ninja comes up to us

1689
01:09:51,947 --> 01:09:55,289
and he chooses to tell
me about how the FBI

1690
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:56,884
is fucking him up,

1691
01:09:56,919 --> 01:09:59,986
you feel like you can
save this kid somehow.

1692
01:10:00,021 --> 01:10:01,724
Or make things better.

1693
01:10:01,759 --> 01:10:04,595
That's hard to deal
with emotionally.

1694
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:06,234
- Thank you, Chop.

1695
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:08,302
That's fuckin' awesome, dude.

1696
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:09,303
Thank you guys.

1697
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:10,700
Have a good show.

1698
01:10:12,033 --> 01:10:13,637
- [Violent J] First
time seeing ICP?

1699
01:10:13,672 --> 01:10:17,575
- Oh man, my heart's
racing right now.

1700
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:18,939
- Two whoops.

1701
01:10:18,974 --> 01:10:20,512
- You're giving us these?

1702
01:10:20,547 --> 01:10:21,909
- I brought them for you guys.

1703
01:10:21,944 --> 01:10:23,548
- This is awesome!

1704
01:10:25,046 --> 01:10:27,849
I have so much trouble
at meet and greets.

1705
01:10:27,884 --> 01:10:30,852
You know, I'm sweating under
the makeup the whole time.

1706
01:10:30,887 --> 01:10:32,623
What do you say to a
kid when he comes up

1707
01:10:32,658 --> 01:10:34,427
and peels his shirt
off and his whole back

1708
01:10:34,462 --> 01:10:36,792
is a big mural to your music?

1709
01:10:38,631 --> 01:10:39,993
- Glad the music could be
there for you, brother.

1710
01:10:40,028 --> 01:10:41,665
- Yeah, no doubt, man.

1711
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:44,635
- What could you say
that's good enough?

1712
01:10:47,937 --> 01:10:49,607
It's just a lot, man.

1713
01:10:49,642 --> 01:10:50,806
- [Michelle] You
know you worry a lot.

1714
01:10:50,841 --> 01:10:52,874
You think about your family.

1715
01:10:52,909 --> 01:10:55,349
It just takes a toll
on your brain, babe.

1716
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:57,648
- It gives me panic attacks.

1717
01:10:59,751 --> 01:11:01,487
I wouldn't want my worst enemy

1718
01:11:01,522 --> 01:11:03,885
to suffer from a panic attack.

1719
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,524
You're sitting there
watching TV, all of a sudden

1720
01:11:05,559 --> 01:11:08,021
you're about to
get hit by a train

1721
01:11:08,056 --> 01:11:10,595
and you don't know what the
fuck is causing the fear.

1722
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:14,566
When you come out of it,
you're just exhausted.

1723
01:11:16,097 --> 01:11:17,800
Let's talk about something else.

1724
01:11:17,835 --> 01:11:18,702
- Okay.

1731
01:11:34,357 --> 01:11:35,785
- [Michael] I like
The Allman Brothers

1732
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:37,490
and Earth, Wind & Fire

1733
01:11:37,525 --> 01:11:39,019
and Stevie Wonder.

1734
01:11:39,054 --> 01:11:42,660
The closest thing
to rebellious music

1735
01:11:42,695 --> 01:11:44,893
growing up was, uh, Aerosmith.

1736
01:11:46,831 --> 01:11:49,667
I don't listen to
Aerosmith anymore.

1737
01:11:49,702 --> 01:11:52,604
- [Farris] We filed our first
lawsuit the summer of 2012.

1738
01:11:52,639 --> 01:11:54,936
That lawsuit was
just to give the FBI

1739
01:11:54,971 --> 01:11:57,070
a chance to explain themselves.

1740
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:59,347
They didn't really have
a good explanation.

1741
01:11:59,382 --> 01:12:00,777
- [Male News Anchor]
Now the members of the

1742
01:12:00,812 --> 01:12:02,383
Insane Clown Posse
and several Juggalos

1743
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:05,749
have partnered with the
ACLU to sue the FBI.

1744
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:09,918
- This morning, the ACLU
filed a federal lawsuit

1745
01:12:09,953 --> 01:12:11,920
against the
Department of Justice

1746
01:12:11,955 --> 01:12:15,561
and against the FBI
challenging the designation

1747
01:12:15,596 --> 01:12:18,927
of a musical fan base
as a criminal gang.

1748
01:12:20,865 --> 01:12:22,667
- [Saura] One thing
that we should get clear

1749
01:12:22,702 --> 01:12:24,867
right from the start,
organized crime has nothing

1750
01:12:24,902 --> 01:12:27,507
to do with the Juggalo culture.

1751
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:29,674
- Discrimination based
on the type of music

1752
01:12:29,709 --> 01:12:32,545
a person listens to
is flat out ridiculous

1753
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,712
and un-American bull shit.

1754
01:12:36,584 --> 01:12:39,112
We are official
plaintiffs in a lawsuit

1755
01:12:39,147 --> 01:12:41,719
against the FBI officially.

1756
01:12:41,754 --> 01:12:44,458
We're going to war with the FBI.

1757
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:47,824
- ICP is not defendants
and it feels good.

1758
01:12:47,859 --> 01:12:49,727
You know what I'm saying?

1759
01:12:49,762 --> 01:12:53,764
- It's like a fucking big-ass
cheer like (imitates cheer).

1760
01:12:53,799 --> 01:12:55,733
- The ACLU, they don't play.

1761
01:12:55,768 --> 01:12:59,770
And it's gotta be a real cause
for them to get involved.

1762
01:12:59,805 --> 01:13:02,036
- [Michael] The American
Civil Liberties Union

1763
01:13:02,071 --> 01:13:05,072
is the oldest and largest
organization in the country

1764
01:13:05,107 --> 01:13:08,515
dedicated to defending the
civil rights and civil liberties

1765
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,781
of all people in this country.

1766
01:13:10,816 --> 01:13:13,553
We work on a wide,
wide variety of cases,

1767
01:13:13,588 --> 01:13:16,721
including freedom of
speech, freedom of religion,

1768
01:13:16,756 --> 01:13:19,086
police misconduct,
voting rights,

1769
01:13:19,121 --> 01:13:21,891
rights of people of
color, rights of women,

1770
01:13:21,926 --> 01:13:24,498
rights of LGBT persons.

1771
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:28,799
We are here to ensure
that our country lives up

1772
01:13:28,834 --> 01:13:33,034
to its values of freedom
and democracy and liberty.

1773
01:13:34,873 --> 01:13:38,479
I didn't initially see this
as being in any way comparable

1774
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:41,680
to the other civil
rights cases we had.

1775
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:45,651
But the more I learned,
the more it reminded me

1776
01:13:45,686 --> 01:13:47,884
of many other of our cases.

1777
01:13:49,492 --> 01:13:51,525
And it wasn't just
about representing

1778
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,758
a bunch of people who
painted their face.

1779
01:13:53,793 --> 01:13:57,597
There was serious
constitutional issues at stake.

1780
01:13:57,632 --> 01:14:00,699
Throughout history,
there has always been

1781
01:14:00,734 --> 01:14:02,734
a tendency for the government

1782
01:14:02,769 --> 01:14:06,100
to want to suppress
controversial speech.

1783
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:09,741
And that could be
speech from the left,

1784
01:14:09,776 --> 01:14:13,173
speech from the right,
speech from non-conformists.

1785
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:16,550
That's why we have the
First Amendment to serve

1786
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:19,146
as a check on abuse
of government.

1787
01:14:19,181 --> 01:14:21,951
Because of the First Amendment,
people in this country

1788
01:14:21,986 --> 01:14:24,019
can listen to whatever
music they want.

1789
01:14:24,054 --> 01:14:26,890
They can express themselves
the way they wish

1790
01:14:26,925 --> 01:14:29,695
without fear of
police harassment.

1791
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:31,730
They can worship
the way they wish.

1792
01:14:31,765 --> 01:14:33,501
There's the right to protest.

1793
01:14:33,536 --> 01:14:36,064
There's a free press to report.

1794
01:14:36,099 --> 01:14:39,133
- We need music that expresses
the times that we're happy.

1795
01:14:39,168 --> 01:14:41,641
We need music that expresses
at times that we're angry.

1796
01:14:41,676 --> 01:14:44,545
And ICP, they're doing
that for their fans.

1797
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,943
And for me, it was Soundgarden
or Jane's Addiction

1798
01:14:46,978 --> 01:14:48,780
or Ice-T tea or NWA.

1799
01:14:48,815 --> 01:14:50,276
I mean that's the
time when I grew up.

1800
01:14:50,311 --> 01:14:51,684
But time and time again,

1801
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:53,147
every 10, 15 years,

1802
01:14:53,182 --> 01:14:56,051
we find ourselves
in this situation.

1803

♪ Fuck the police comin'
straight from the underground ♪

1804
01:14:58,957 --> 01:15:00,891
- [Male News Anchor] NWA
has taunted law enforcement

1805
01:15:00,926 --> 01:15:03,960
with its lyrics urging
violence against police.

1806
01:15:03,995 --> 01:15:07,062
- [Interviewer] FBI, how
did the FBI situation stuff?

1807
01:15:07,097 --> 01:15:09,295
- [Dr. Dre] There was one
guy that thought he would

1808
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:10,769
write us a letter.

1809
01:15:10,804 --> 01:15:12,672
He's in Utah somewhere.

1810
01:15:12,707 --> 01:15:14,641
- I guess he figured if sent
us a letter, we'd be like,

1811
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,005
oh, the FBI sent us a letter,

1812
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,073
let's stop writing
records and doing this.

1813
01:15:18,108 --> 01:15:21,076
- [Saura] The FBI just seems
to find itself once again

1814
01:15:21,111 --> 01:15:23,848
investigating
musicians, fan bases.

1815
01:15:23,883 --> 01:15:25,245
Whether it's John Lennon,

1816
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,622
the Deadheads or
KISS, they're wrong.

1817
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:33,660
- [Michael] Certainly
fans of various groups

1818
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,926
have been targeted
throughout history,

1819
01:15:35,961 --> 01:15:38,962
but I believe this
is unprecedented.

1820
01:15:43,298 --> 01:15:45,298
- If we get removed
from the gang list,

1821
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:48,037
I think everything will
go back to the way it was.

1822
01:15:48,072 --> 01:15:49,808
I believe that.

1823
01:15:49,843 --> 01:15:52,910

1824
01:16:01,382 --> 01:16:04,724

looked at it and said,

1825

this ain't even worth going

1826
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:10,191
- [Female Reporter] The Detroit

Insane Clown Posse
has been classified

1828
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:13,293
as a gang by the feds.

1829
01:16:13,328 --> 01:16:14,899
And it's going to stay that way

1830
01:16:14,934 --> 01:16:17,902

1835

didn't have standing

1836
01:16:34,987 --> 01:16:36,591
to bring the case.

1837
01:16:37,957 --> 01:16:40,089
And the major argument was

1838
01:16:41,895 --> 01:16:43,928
the harms we were alleging,

1839
01:16:43,963 --> 01:16:46,326
for example, people
being pulled over

1840
01:16:46,361 --> 01:16:48,130
by the Tennessee police,

1841
01:16:48,165 --> 01:16:51,331
those were harms inflicted
by third parties.

1842
01:16:51,366 --> 01:16:53,971
- Which is crazy because
they're doing that

1843
01:16:54,006 --> 01:16:56,941
because the fuckin'
FBI says we're a gang.

1844
01:16:56,976 --> 01:17:01,011
- [Michael] The FBI created
a gang list to inform

1845
01:17:01,046 --> 01:17:04,113
the actions of local
law enforcement.

1846
01:17:04,148 --> 01:17:09,151
It's obvious that local law
enforcement is going to react.

1847
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:13,122
- It's a sad, scary,
scary fuckin' thing.

1848
01:17:15,324 --> 01:17:18,732
- The First Amendment
is a fundamental right

1849
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:22,395
upon which many of our
other rights are based.

1850
01:17:23,464 --> 01:17:26,707
And if people in a free country

1851
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:29,072
aren't able to
express themselves,

1852
01:17:29,107 --> 01:17:32,174
whether it's
politically or socially,

1853
01:17:34,178 --> 01:17:36,783
we do not live in a democracy.

1854
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:41,788
Juggalos should not
be afraid to express

1855
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:44,692
who they are in this country.

1856
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:46,826
They have an absolute
right to do that

1857

without fear of harassment.

1858
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:54,427
- Insane Clown Posse, that name
induces laughter everywhere.

All we're asking is for the

1918
01:20:38,593 --> 01:20:40,329
by implication, a gang member,

1919
01:20:40,364 --> 01:20:42,298
you've branded
them as criminals.

1920
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:44,003
- Doesn't the report
itself specifically say

1921
01:20:44,038 --> 01:20:46,269
that there's criminal
subsets of Juggalos?

1922
01:20:46,304 --> 01:20:48,942
The DOJ is not saying that
all Juggalos are gang members.

- That word subset does no work.

1924
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:53,012
It is meaningless to
everybody involved here.

1925
01:20:53,047 --> 01:20:55,575
It's meaningless to the
law enforcement officers

1926
01:20:55,610 --> 01:20:57,511
who enforce the law and
that's what's most important.

1927
01:20:57,546 --> 01:21:00,217
It did nothing to save our

01:21:03,123 --> 01:21:04,958
So let me pause it,
I mean, is that-

01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:06,388
- [Farris] That was awesome.

1931
01:21:06,423 --> 01:21:07,521

1932
01:21:07,556 --> 01:21:09,424
- [Farris] That was great, yeah.

1933
01:21:09,459 --> 01:21:11,063
That made me feel like this
is totally different than

1934
01:21:11,098 --> 01:21:13,593
your average person
on the gang list.

1935
01:21:13,628 --> 01:21:18,136
- In the morning, do I
actually remember to say that?

1936
01:21:26,707 --> 01:21:28,916
- [Michael] If we want
to get back in the game

1937
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:31,644
and be able to prove that
the rights of Juggalos

1938
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,153

violated, we need to win today.

and may it please this court,

1942
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,938
the Department of
Justice's hybrid gang rule

1946
01:21:57,639 --> 01:21:59,276

disputing that some people

1947

that self-identify as Juggalos

1948
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:03,709
have done what this
assessment says that they do?

1949
01:22:03,744 --> 01:22:05,953
- [Saura] We're not
challenging the finding

1950
01:22:05,988 --> 01:22:08,186
that maybe eight people
someplace in Idaho

1951
01:22:08,221 --> 01:22:11,123
are acting as a criminal street
gang and bearing the name

1952
01:22:11,158 --> 01:22:14,027
Juggalo for reasons that
are out of our control.

1953
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:17,558
There is no data to support
that this group is engaged in

1954

1955
01:22:19,232 --> 01:22:20,627

1960
01:22:28,571 --> 01:22:31,374
The 2011 report does not
state that all Juggalos

legal consequences follow

1962
01:22:34,214 --> 01:22:35,576
from this report.

1963
01:22:35,611 --> 01:22:37,215
- [Judge] Not the be facetious,

1964
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:39,085
but could you pass the
FBI background check

1965
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,120
and be in your job if you
were a member of the Juggalos?

1967
01:22:43,322 --> 01:22:46,158
- [Judge] These third
parties told these folks

1968
01:22:46,193 --> 01:22:49,062
it was upon reliance
on this assessment

1969
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:52,164
that they were taking the
actions that they were taking.

1970
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:54,100
They say the police
officer came up to me

1971
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:56,597
and I read your group is a
gang in the FBI assessment

1972
01:22:56,632 --> 01:22:59,006
and so I'm going to
detain you, search you,

1973
01:22:59,041 --> 01:23:00,733
whatever it is
they say they did.

1974
01:23:00,768 --> 01:23:02,669
It seems to me a little hard
for you to get around that.

1975
01:23:02,704 --> 01:23:05,210
- [Lindsey] It's simply
information being provided

1976
01:23:05,245 --> 01:23:08,180
for law enforcement entities
to use how they see fit.

1977
01:23:08,215 --> 01:23:11,018

01:26:17,932 --> 01:26:19,734
And really, I think the hippies
are really the same thing.

2039
01:26:19,769 --> 01:26:22,242
It's just a little more tattoos,
a little more aggressive.

2040
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:24,475
But other than that I've had a
good time out here with them.

2041
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:26,675
It really shocked me because
everybody was telling us

2042
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:27,940
it's gonna be all this and that.

2043
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:29,381
- I want a picture, man.

2044
01:26:29,416 --> 01:26:30,283
Can I get a picture?

2045
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:31,185
- Sure.

2046
01:26:32,617 --> 01:26:33,583
- Thank you, man.

2047
01:26:33,618 --> 01:26:34,815
- No problem, thank you.

2048
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:35,684
- Thanks a lot.

2049
01:26:35,719 --> 01:26:36,685
- Thanks, buddy.

2050
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:38,555
- Thank you, brother.

2051
01:26:38,590 --> 01:26:39,985
- No real issues.

2052
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,888
Not on our end.

2053
01:26:41,923 --> 01:26:43,758
For the most part, fans
seem to want to take care

2054
01:26:43,793 --> 01:26:47,366
of themselves, offering
out to help each other.

2055
01:26:47,401 --> 01:26:49,929
- If you need more bread,
come back and see us, OK?

2056
01:26:49,964 --> 01:26:51,304
- Appreciate you.

2057
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:52,932
- No problem, man.

2058
01:26:52,967 --> 01:26:56,276
Keep your homeys
hydrated too, all right?

2059
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:57,640
Lot of Juggalos don't have much.

2060
01:26:57,675 --> 01:26:59,807
When they get
here, we feed them.

2061
01:26:59,842 --> 01:27:01,842
Hot dogs, we got water for them.

2062
01:27:01,877 --> 01:27:04,009
We've got about 800 or so
pounds of donated clothing

2063
01:27:04,044 --> 01:27:05,945
so far that people have brought.

2064
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:09,388
We're just the part of the
family that likes to cook.

2065
01:27:09,423 --> 01:27:11,984
- [Preacher] May we christen
this space our new home.

2066
01:27:12,019 --> 01:27:14,657
A place where we never
have to feel alone.

2067
01:27:14,692 --> 01:27:16,956
A place of love,
music and peace.

2068
01:27:16,991 --> 01:27:21,532
A time when we can cherish
and stress the least.

2069
01:27:21,567 --> 01:27:24,337
That is not gonna
happen, anyway.

2070
01:27:25,703 --> 01:27:27,571
- [Man On Radio]
Hey Kevin or Alan.

2071
01:27:27,606 --> 01:27:30,706
There's a bunch of ATF guys
that tried to get in here.

2072
01:27:30,741 --> 01:27:33,511
They're just gonna basically
go throughout the grounds,

2073
01:27:33,546 --> 01:27:36,349
giving out everybody the bone.

2074
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:37,977
- [Farris] Well, the ATF,

2075
01:27:38,012 --> 01:27:40,287
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms are outside

2076
01:27:40,322 --> 01:27:43,884
the back entrance to
the Gathering of the
Juggalos right now

2077
01:27:43,919 --> 01:27:46,458
which is on private property.

2078
01:27:48,088 --> 01:27:49,725
What I'm also
concerned about is that

2079
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,563
the ATF often
works with the FBI.

2080
01:27:52,598 --> 01:27:54,301
They can not come onto your
property without your consent,

2081
01:27:54,336 --> 01:27:57,700
without a search warrant
signed by a judge.

2082
01:27:57,735 --> 01:27:59,537
- You guys rented
the venue from me,

2083
01:27:59,572 --> 01:28:01,605
but I'm not gonna
give them consent.

2084
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,541
But you're going to
explain everything?

2085
01:28:03,576 --> 01:28:04,971
- I'm going to explain
it all to them.

2086
01:28:05,006 --> 01:28:05,972
So if you're ready
to go out there.

2087
01:28:06,007 --> 01:28:07,875
All right, let's do it.

2088
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:09,481
That's one of them right there?

2089
01:28:09,516 --> 01:28:10,911
Is that one of them
right there too?

2090
01:28:10,946 --> 01:28:12,913
I'm an attorney, I'd
like to speak to you.

2091
01:28:12,948 --> 01:28:14,486
You with the ATF?

2092
01:28:17,524 --> 01:28:18,886
Excuse me, sir.

2093
01:28:18,921 --> 01:28:20,327
I'm an attorney,
can I speak to you?

2094
01:28:20,362 --> 01:28:22,659
Are you with the ATF?

2095
01:28:22,694 --> 01:28:25,431
Are you a law enforcement agent?

2096
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:34,605
Did he just flick us off?

2097
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,442
We should point out,
very unprofessionally,

2098
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:38,741
one of them flicked
us off on his way out

2099
01:28:38,776 --> 01:28:41,381
after refusing to speak to me.

2100
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:45,418
- [Michael] After an initial win

2101
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:47,717
in the Sixth Circuit
Court of Appeals,

2102
01:28:47,752 --> 01:28:49,884
the case went back
to the trial court

2103
01:28:49,919 --> 01:28:52,359
for another motion to dismiss by

2104
01:28:52,394 --> 01:28:54,625
the FBI and the
Department of Justice.

2105
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:56,528
And this time we lost.

2106
01:28:57,861 --> 01:28:59,795
- Hold on, fuck you man.

2107
01:28:59,830 --> 01:29:02,633
- And we went back up to
the US Court of Appeals

2108
01:29:02,668 --> 01:29:04,866
and we lost there as well.

2109
01:29:04,901 --> 01:29:05,867
- Fuck you.

2110
01:29:05,902 --> 01:29:06,736
Wait a minute, what?

2111
01:29:06,771 --> 01:29:07,869
Fuck you.

2112
01:29:07,904 --> 01:29:09,904
- [Michael] The court held that

2113
01:29:09,939 --> 01:29:12,478
because local law enforcement

2114
01:29:13,844 --> 01:29:16,746
were not forced to
harass the Juggalos,

2115
01:29:16,781 --> 01:29:18,979
the FBI was not responsible

2116
01:29:19,014 --> 01:29:22,983
under the Administrative
Procedures Act.

2117
01:29:23,018 --> 01:29:24,919
- When it gets thrown
out of court repeatedly,

2118
01:29:24,954 --> 01:29:26,855
how else are you
going to stand up?

2119
01:29:26,890 --> 01:29:27,889
What do you do?

2120
01:29:27,924 --> 01:29:28,923
You protest.

2121
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:32,696
- [Male Announcer] Thousands
of demonstrators assembled

2122
01:29:32,731 --> 01:29:35,127
in the nation's capital
for a mass protest.

2123
01:29:35,162 --> 01:29:36,997
- [Male Narrator] The Lincoln
Memorial is forever enshrined

2124
01:29:37,032 --> 01:29:40,638
as a megaphone for the voice
of the American people.

2125
01:29:40,673 --> 01:29:43,608
From anti-war protests
to million man marches.

2126
01:29:43,643 --> 01:29:46,875

that aren't even Juggalos.

2182
01:32:02,177 --> 01:32:04,749
They were there because
they heard what was going on

2183
01:32:04,784 --> 01:32:06,586
and they knew it was bullshit.

2184
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:07,950

01:33:04,844 --> 01:33:06,712
some bullshit right there.

2209
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:09,077
The government stating
your fans are a gang

2210
01:33:09,112 --> 01:33:11,915
is undoubtedly bullshit.

2211
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:14,621
But so is your music, you know.

2212
01:33:15,415 --> 01:33:17,217
That hasn't changed,

2213
01:33:17,252 --> 01:33:19,384
but that's another march.

2214
01:33:19,419 --> 01:33:21,155
- [Shaggy] Even though
technically we're
still on the list,

2215
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:23,157
now the normal person
that hears about ICP

2216
01:33:23,192 --> 01:33:24,928
being linked with gang stuff.

2217
01:33:24,963 --> 01:33:26,831
To them, it's almost
laughable now.

2218
01:33:26,866 --> 01:33:29,262
It's like, come on these
kids are not gang members.

2219
01:33:29,297 --> 01:33:32,133
- [Violent J] We stood
up as far as we could.

2220
01:33:32,168 --> 01:33:34,003
And we said we're not a gang.

2221
01:33:34,038 --> 01:33:37,677
In our eyes, we feel
like we won that shit.

2222
01:33:37,712 --> 01:33:41,109
- [Michael] I think the
best evidence of the success

2223
01:33:41,144 --> 01:33:45,278
of the case is the complaints
that we've been receiving

2224
01:33:45,313 --> 01:33:48,215
about harassment by local police

2225
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:50,822
have dwindled to almost none.

2226
01:33:54,157 --> 01:33:56,025
To express their appreciation,

2227
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:59,127
I even got an invitation
to Hallowicked.

2228
01:33:59,162 --> 01:34:03,637
They invited us onstage to
spray Faygo on the crowd.

2229
01:34:05,234 --> 01:34:09,137
I put a clown mask on and
actually went out and did it.

2230
01:34:09,172 --> 01:34:13,911
But I got out quickly cause
I was getting really sticky.

2231
01:34:18,148 --> 01:34:21,116
- [Saura] This is a case that
could go to the Supreme Court.

2232
01:34:21,151 --> 01:34:22,249
This is a case that
is important enough

2233
01:34:22,284 --> 01:34:23,987
to go to the Supreme Court.

2234
01:34:24,022 --> 01:34:26,352
- If the government can
target a group of people

2235
01:34:26,387 --> 01:34:28,420
based on their musical taste,

2236
01:34:28,455 --> 01:34:30,730
they can target
of group of people

2237
01:34:30,765 --> 01:34:32,831
based on any reason at all.

2238
01:34:32,866 --> 01:34:34,096
- I work for an
insurance company.

2239
01:34:34,131 --> 01:34:35,130
- I'm a carpenter.

2240
01:34:35,165 --> 01:34:36,098
- A college graduate.

2241
01:34:36,133 --> 01:34:37,231
- An IT guy.

2242
01:34:37,266 --> 01:34:39,134
- A Juris Doctorate graduate.

2243
01:34:39,169 --> 01:34:41,169
- I help train soldiers,
federal first responders,

2244
01:34:41,204 --> 01:34:42,808
Department of Homeland Security.

2245
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:45,712
- I wanna grow up
to be a teacher.

2246
01:34:45,747 --> 01:34:48,946
- The FBI designation
was unprecedented.

2247
01:34:48,981 --> 01:34:50,376
And it's a bad precedent.

2248
01:34:50,411 --> 01:34:51,278
- I'm a veteran.

2249
01:34:51,313 --> 01:34:53,181
- I'm a soldier.

2250
01:34:53,216 --> 01:34:54,985
- I'm vice president of the
Desert Storm War Memorial.

2251
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:57,251
- I'm a Juggalo, also a father.

2252
01:34:57,286 --> 01:34:58,153
- I'm a brother.

2253
01:34:58,188 --> 01:34:59,792
- And a husband.

2254
01:34:59,827 --> 01:35:01,222
- [Michael] The First
Amendment guarantees

2255
01:35:01,257 --> 01:35:03,829
the right to freedom
of speech that serves

2256
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:07,030
as the foundation for
all the other freedoms

2257
01:35:07,065 --> 01:35:08,735
we have in this country.

2258
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:09,868
- And I'm not a gang member.

2259
01:35:09,903 --> 01:35:11,067
- Definitely not gang members.

2260
01:35:11,102 --> 01:35:12,233
- I am not a gang member.

2261
01:35:12,268 --> 01:35:13,498
- I am not a gang member.

2262
01:35:13,533 --> 01:35:15,742
- I am not a gang member.

2263
01:35:17,273 --> 01:35:18,844
- [Michael] Without
these freedoms,

2264
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:21,946
we are not the United
States of America.

2265
01:35:23,543 --> 01:35:26,016
- [Violent J] We
got one more for ya.

2266
01:35:26,051 --> 01:35:29,250
