00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,727
- [Blinkie] This is my hometown.

6
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:14,695
Henderson, Kentucky.

7
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:16,731
I've never been away from here,

8
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:20,839
but I can't imagine there's
any other place quite like it.

9
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:24,153
It's a beautiful town
right on the river

10
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:27,811
where the grass is green,
and so are the trees.

11
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:30,193
The people are nice,
[people laughing]

12
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:32,057
and they say hello
to you as they pass

13
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:33,714
by on the street.

14
00:01:33,714 --> 00:01:35,992
Yeah, whether they
know you or not.

15
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:38,719
It's a great place to grow up.

[dogs barking]

18
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:00,948
Things started to get really,
[TV static]

19
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:03,882
really weird around here
toward the end of summer.

20
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:07,127
Crazy things started to
happen all around Henderson.

21
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,268
[car alarms sounding]

22
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:16,584
My sisters and I actually
slept through all of this,

23
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:20,312
but our parents went Cuh-ray-zy.

24
00:02:26,353 --> 00:02:29,528
[car alarms sounding]

25
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,224
Yeah. So, I'm just
getting started.

26
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:40,367
I swear this also happened.

27
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:42,265
Cats started barking.

33
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:01,284
Yeah, my friends and I probably

34
00:03:01,284 --> 00:03:03,217
aren't too different
from all you guys.

00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,646
- Madi, you have
so much potential.

40
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:54,337
Since you don't
believe in yourself,

41
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:57,237
and so on in your
workouts and on the track,

42
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,274
if you don't start believing
in yourself and working harder

43
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,380
we'll never improve those times.

44
00:04:07,937 --> 00:04:09,456
- Hey.

45
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:12,286
You think you can fix dad's
old laptop? It's a clunker.

46

- Geek Inc. at your service.

47
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:38,588

48
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:39,417
What?

49
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:41,315
I don't know what's
wrong with it.

50
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,143

science fair project goes to

the ginormous rocket, yay!

54
00:04:56,641 --> 00:05:01,577
Congratulations.
[children clapping]

55
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:03,717
Sheldon, I know
you're disappointed

56
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:05,719
and this looks really cool,

57
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:07,583
but there's always next year.

58
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:09,999
And the popcorn's good.

00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,323
- Where do you think Blinkie got

61
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:27,016
whatever it is
that she's wearing?

62
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:29,259
- Maybe the dumpster?

63
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:30,847
- For sure.

64
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:32,332
- [Blinkie] Yep. That's me.

65
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,576
And my two horrible sisters.

66
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:36,543
Really?

67
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,890
- Bye, brace face.

68
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,201
- Bye, stinky!

69
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:42,825
Oh, I mean Blinkie.

[people chattering]

71
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:55,389
- [Woman] We used to
get some fresh apples.

72
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,632
- [Girl] Take a trip out there.

73
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:57,840
Go to the apple orchard.

74
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,186
- By the way, Tammy.
Happy birthday.

75
00:05:59,186 --> 00:06:01,775
- Yeah, happy birthday.

76
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:02,879
- What a coincidence
you and your brother

77
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,191
have the same birthday.

78
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:08,298
[people chattering]

79
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,303
- What do we have here?

80
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:15,754
A party.
[chuckling]

81
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:17,446
- I'm here, the party can begin.

82
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:21,104
I brought pie. It's
my mom's famous pie.

83
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:23,762
I love pie.

84
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:27,663
- Boys and girls with their
decorations, how disgusting.

85
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:32,357
But wait, I can't wait to
see the look on their faces.

86
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:34,980
Little do they know
what's about to happen.

87
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,707
Oh, it's okay, Snowflake.

88
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:39,709
It's just fat boy Mayor Tim,

89
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:43,023
with his pie at
the birthday party.

90
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:44,369
Oh...
[suspenseful music]

91
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:48,822
Let it begin with 3, 2, 1.

95
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:02,352

[people chattering]

100
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:15,227

Honey, no.

102
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:17,609
- The water's out.

103
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:22,062
- I don't know.
[ominous music]

104
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:24,547
- Is it okay?
- Are we good?

105
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:27,136
- [Child] What's happening?

106
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:28,448
[laughing]

107
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,139

what's happened.

108
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,935
[all exclaiming]

109
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:34,868
- I don't like sharks,
I don't like sharks.

110
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:38,285
I don't like sharks.
- You know what's going on?

111
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:39,493
- No, I don't.

112
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,667
- Can't you dictionary
it up, or something?

113
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,876
- No, I can't.
[suspenseful music]

114
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:45,637
Oh my god.
[children exclaiming]

115
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:48,398
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

116
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,780

[ominous music]

118
00:07:53,576 --> 00:07:55,336

120
00:07:58,201 --> 00:07:59,409
Oh yes.

121
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:02,343
Oh no, don't find
me. Nobody back here.

[ominous music]

124
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:15,253
Which one of these
dead burned cords

125
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,427
go to the fog machine?

126
00:08:17,427 --> 00:08:20,292
These cords, I'll tell
you, it's too much.

127
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:24,262
- Good afternoon, Brutus.

128
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:25,781
[snarling]

129
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:28,128
- Jehovah's witness. I ain't
got time for them, come on.

130
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,304
These, you have to have
an engineering degree

131
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:35,031
to put these fog
machines together.

132
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:36,205
Shouldn't need help with this.

133
00:08:36,205 --> 00:08:38,276
This should not take this long.

134
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:40,623
Got to get fog up on this porch.

135
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:42,038
- Good afternoon, Brutus.

136
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:43,108
- Can I help you?

137
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:44,593
I'm a little busy here.

138
00:08:44,593 --> 00:08:47,699
- Yeah. It seems that you like
Halloween just a little bit?

139
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:48,942
- You think?

140
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:50,115
[laughing]

141
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:51,841
- Well, I just
wanted to invite you

142
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:53,705
to our church's
annual trunk or treat

143
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:55,845
for the kids later this month.
- Children?

144
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:58,020
No, I'm, I don't know.

145
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,953
- The church backs right
up to your property, sir.

146
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:03,301
- No, I'm not going
to that, I'm too busy.

147
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:05,130
- All right. Well
you enjoy your day.

148
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,823
- Children. You
could scare them.

149
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:11,689
Get this town under your
mercy, but what to wear?

150
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:13,898
Pastor?
- Yes.

151
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:16,590
- I think I will be attending,
yes. I'll be coming.

152
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,488
Not too many people
know me around here.

153
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:19,662
And it'll give me a chance

154
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:21,630
to make an impression
on the community.

155
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,286
Yeah.
- Great, I'll see you there.

156
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:27,636
- Yes. I'll see you.
[laughing]

157
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:31,191
Yes, I'll see you all.
[ominous music]

[students chattering]

159
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:45,861
- Guys. Guys, guys,
it's the Punisher.

160
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:48,898
- I hear he's been shaving
since he was seven.

161
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:50,313
- Quick, try not to
make eye contact.

162
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:53,420
- The little odd squad.
- Yeah the nerd herd.

163
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,318
- Come on, guys.

164
00:09:55,318 --> 00:09:56,734
Don't waste your time on them.

165
00:09:56,734 --> 00:10:01,255
- Yeah, with the
not so hot shots.

166
00:10:01,255 --> 00:10:02,981
- [Both] Wait a minute.

167
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:05,777
Did we just agree on something?

168
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:08,366
- Ew, no!
- Whatever, losers.

169
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:09,436
[school bell ringing]

170
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:11,196
- Let's get to class.

171
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:17,306
[door slams]

172
00:10:17,306 --> 00:10:18,548
- So what are you
gonna be for Halloween?

173
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,378
- Uh, I don't know yet.

174
00:10:20,378 --> 00:10:21,759
- Well I heard of this
really cool website

175
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,657
called HalloweenCostumes.com.
- Cool.

176
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:24,934
- And...
- Guys.

177
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:27,488
We need to get on Mayor
Tim's press conference,

178
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:29,629
and see what he's got
to say about the lake.

179
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,774
[people chattering and yelling]

180
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:41,917
[banging gavel]

181
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:43,919
- Alright, alright.

182
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,818
Let's settle down
everyone, settle down.

183
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:48,958
We're here to talk
about the events

184
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,652
that happened at the lake
port yesterday afternoon.

185
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,619
Now, to be perfectly honest,

186
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:56,759
those events have
been classified,

187
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,074
then de-classified, and
now overly simplified

188
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:02,662
as just a fluke.

189
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,147
In fact, I have a
report right here

190
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:07,908
from our own prestigious
Parks Department.

191
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:09,669
They work for me.

192
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,084
And it states,

193
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:13,431
"The bizarre set of
circumstances that happened

194
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:15,882
yesterday afternoon at the lake

195
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,334
was simply algae."

196
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:21,473
[people exclaiming]

197
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,235
Yes, algae, yes.

198
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:28,101
Algae, A-L-L-G...

199
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:31,242
- Algae.

200
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:33,209
The city is saying it's
some type of algae?

201
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:34,694
No.
- No way, guys.

202
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,936
Don't believe them.

203
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:37,248
They don't know what
they're talking about.

204
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:38,628
Yeah, that was not algae.

205
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:40,147
- It has no characteristics.
- They don't know

206
00:11:40,147 --> 00:11:41,735
what they're talking about.
- We were there and we saw.

207
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,426
I saw shark fins.

208
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:44,393
- Yeah.

209
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:45,359
- My dad says it's haunted.

210
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,326
- Wait a minute.

211
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:48,121
The lake is haunted?

212
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:49,605
- Really?

213
00:11:49,605 --> 00:11:52,194
- The lake, the whole town,

214
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:54,230
and definitely that
mansion downtown.

215
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,956
- Really?
- What mansion?

216
00:11:55,956 --> 00:11:57,820
- The one across the
street from the church.

217
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,891
- It has the big
iron fence around it.

218
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:01,134
And he decorates.

219
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:03,136
- The one covered in
Halloween decorations?

220
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:05,103
- Yeah.
- Some kids say

221
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:06,346
that last year what it was time

222
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:09,176
to take down all the
Halloween decorations,

223
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:10,971
not all the ghosts and monsters

224
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:12,766
were put back into their boxes.

225
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,735
[all exclaiming]

226
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,632
- That doesn't make sense.

227
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:17,806
- They walked off.

228
00:12:17,806 --> 00:12:19,083
- No way.
- No.

229
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,567
That's why some kids
say that, that's not-

230
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,017
- Nice try.

231
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:24,433
- I mean, supposedly,

232
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:25,848
he has a laboratory down there

233
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:27,470
where he does experiments.

234
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,438
- Experiments?

235
00:12:29,438 --> 00:12:30,853
On what, exactly?

236
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:33,476
- Not on us. I hope.

237
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:35,444
[laughing]

238
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:38,102
[ominous music]

239
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,525
- Blinkie is terrified.

240
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:48,733
After the thing at the lake,

241
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,666
and then this morning
with the river.

242
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,012
- I don't know if I
can even get Rusty

243
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:53,289
to go to school tomorrow.

244
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:56,499
He's afraid he gonna
vanish, for real.

245
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:57,915
- It has to stop.

246
00:12:57,915 --> 00:13:00,158
I mean, what is causing
all this insanity?

247
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:01,815
- Sheldon has been
researching these things

248
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:04,611
online for days, and he
doesn't have any answers.

249
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:07,234
- Madi's in her room
and afraid to come out.

250
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:08,408
- Well, you know,

251
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:09,789
with everything
that's been going on,

252
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,032
Doug is, he's really
wondering what's coming next,

253
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:14,414
so he's thinking that
we may move away.

254
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:17,210
- [Children] You and Doug
can move, but we're staying.

255
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,799
This is where all
of our friends are.

256
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,008
- Well, we'll see,
kids. We'll see.

257
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,878
- [Chloe] What are you
guys whispering about?

258
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:31,396
- Oh, nothing, Chloe.

259
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:34,020
We just think we should be
wearing a dress in here.

260
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,298
- Actually, I think this
is the perfect environment

261
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:38,127
to hold a beautiful tea party.

262
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:38,956
[laughing]

263
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:40,578
- You guys are so bad.

264
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:41,821
- Tell me about it.

265
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,650
I actually have to
live with that one.

266
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,341
- Even worse, I have
to live with you.

267
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:46,653
- Oh can you be quiet?

268
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:49,276
- Even worse, we have
to hear you guys talk.

269
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:50,243
At the same time.

270
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:51,727
- Okay, guys.

271
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:53,763
Let's get serious.

272
00:13:53,763 --> 00:13:56,490
What is going on in this town?

273
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,768
- [Both] We heard our parents
talking about moving away.

274
00:13:58,768 --> 00:13:59,804
- See?

275
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:01,841
- Mine too. They want to leave!

276
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,326
- We can't let
this happen, guys.

277
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:05,603
We'll never see
each other again.

278
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:08,571
- There has to be some
type of scientific,

279
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:09,883
mathematical equation.
- Okay, did you just

280
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,229
come out of the dictionary?

281
00:14:12,782 --> 00:14:14,784
- Guys, maybe we'll
just get lucky

282
00:14:14,784 --> 00:14:16,407
and all this weird
stuff will just stop.

283
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:17,408
- Yeah, maybe.
- Come on, guys.

284
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:18,616
Let's head home.

285
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:20,998
Before I decide to
paint my bedroom pink.

286
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:23,863
- Alright let's go.
[all laughing]

287
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:28,868
[children chattering]
[feet pattering]

288
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:34,874
[ominous music]
[gate squeaking]

289
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:36,945
- Guys, did you see that?

290
00:14:36,945 --> 00:14:38,912
- What was that?
- Whoa.

291
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,983
- You guys. You
guys, what is that?

292
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:42,916
- Is this place haunted?
- Guys, guys.

293
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,505
I think he's got like
a spell on the house,

294
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:47,507
like he's got
powers, or something?

295
00:14:47,507 --> 00:14:48,335
I don't know.

296
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:50,648
- I told you.

297
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:52,236
- It's got to be Snivley
doing this, for sure.

298
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:55,066
- Remember the birthday
party, the computer room,

299
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:57,103
and all the pets in the
city are going crazy.

300
00:14:57,103 --> 00:14:59,829
- And there was a tsunami.

301
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:01,072
In the river.

302
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:02,660
- Oh yeah, we read
that in the newspaper.

303
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,592
- The river?
- Oh yeah.

304
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:04,386
We read that in the newspaper.

305
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:05,766
- We gotta stop Snivley,

306
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:07,561
and it starts with this house.

307
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:08,804
- But how?

308
00:15:08,804 --> 00:15:11,600
I mean, this guy's
got strange powers.

309
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,635
And what have we got?

310
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,775
- Google.

311
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,573
[suspenseful music]

312
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:44,219
- Blinkie, watch it.
- What? Sorry.

313
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:45,461
Sorry.
- Gosh...

314
00:15:47,256 --> 00:15:48,499
- Hey Tommy.

315
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:50,742
Here's a report about
Snivley and his family.

316
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,957
- Yeah, we found the same stuff.

317
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,372
It's all about Snivley's great,

318
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:00,925
great, great grandfather,

319
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:02,409
who found some gold around here.

320
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:03,790
- And he helped grow Henderson

321
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,688
by building free houses
for all the miners

322
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:06,827
living with their families.

323
00:16:06,827 --> 00:16:08,346
- That's cool.
- During our research,

324
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:10,072
we found out that
all the houses,

325
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:11,591
he gave them back to
the people of Henderson

326
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:12,764
when all the gold was gone.

327
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,904
- Yeah, that was really nice.

328
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:16,596
- Tammy and I found
some blueprints

329
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:18,667
about Snivley's lab he
built two years ago.

330
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:20,393
- I told you.
- He has a lab?

331
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:21,566
- Yeah.
- Oh.

332
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:22,809
Remember the report
at City Hall?

333
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:24,535
- It said something
about dirt and rocks,

334
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:25,881
but we couldn't figure it out.

335
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:27,469
- It was super confusing.

336
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:28,780
- Hey guys.
- Hi mom.

337
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,162
- Sorry, but it's bedtime.

338
00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:33,268
So we need to turn off
all your devices, okay?

339
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:34,924
And I want you to
get some good sleep

340
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:37,720
because tomorrow
is trunk or treat!

341
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,447
Yeah, alright, love you guys.

342
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,346
- Goodnight.
- Thank you!

343
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:43,588
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Irene.

344
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:44,589
- Goodnight.

345
00:16:45,728 --> 00:16:47,213
- Goodnight, guys.

346
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:53,012
- I just can't take it anymore.

347
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,254
- Oh my goodness.

348
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:55,186
- How do we know
nothing about him?

349
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:58,155
- Well, all we
really know is that

350
00:16:58,155 --> 00:17:00,778
he's a super weird science guy,

351
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:02,021
and he's really rich.

352
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:06,025
- Well, for all you
no-brainers out there,

353
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,925
it means that he's an enigma.

354
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:11,409
- A what?

355
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:13,963
- That some kind of weird
vampire swamp monster?

356
00:17:13,963 --> 00:17:15,068
- Yeah.
- No.

357
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,691
It means that he's a mystery.

358
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:21,626
- Well then basically we
got a whole lot of nothing.

359
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:23,732
- Yeah.
- And then some.

360
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:26,148
- Just everybody,
go back to sleep.

361
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:27,011
- Okay.

362
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:31,291
[ominous music]

363
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:41,646
- Guys guys guys guys!
- What was that?

364
00:17:41,646 --> 00:17:42,716
- Are you okay?

365
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:43,855
Is everyone fine?

366
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:44,925
You good?
- Yeah.

367
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:46,237
- What was that?

368
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:51,518
- Just go back to sleep.
- Just go back to bed.

369
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:53,934
[sighing]

370
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:55,798
- Goodnight again.

371
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:57,455
- Come on, pick up
the pace, slowpoke.

372
00:17:57,455 --> 00:17:59,492
You can carry more than that.

373
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:00,527
Y'all hurry up.

374
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:01,770
I need to get in here.

375
00:18:03,012 --> 00:18:06,188
Yes, sweet gold!
[laughing]

376
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:07,776
We're rich, Snowflake!

377
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:12,160
We'll be eating filet
mignon all night long.

378
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,540
We need to go deeper.

379
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,233
There's more gold,
bring me more dynamite.

380
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:18,545
You bum! I said more dynamite.

381
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:20,168
We gotta go deeper.

382
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:22,929
[laughing]

383
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:25,587
[ominous music]

384
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:37,150
[people chattering]
[upbeat music]

385
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,134
- I just wanted to take a moment

386
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,376
to thank everyone for coming out

387
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:59,345
on such a beautiful day
that the lord gave us.

388
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:01,140
I hope you're all having fun.

389
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,244
- We are.

390
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:03,452
- Can I help you, sir?

391
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:06,006
- Pastor, it's me!

392
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:06,938
- Who's me?

393
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:09,631
- Me. Brutus.

394
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:10,563
Brutus Snivley.
- Oh!

395
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,081
Brutus, I love the outfit.

396
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:14,153
Did you come for my blood?

397
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:18,087
- No, but I could recommend
a few other people.

398
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:19,986
- Pastor, great turnout.

399
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:20,918
- I know, I think the kids

400
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:21,953
are really having a good time.

401
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,921
- Oh I am.
- Yeah.

402
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:27,166
So, Mr. Snively.
- It's Snivley, Snivley.

403
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,064
- Pardon, I believe
you know the Mayor.

404
00:19:29,064 --> 00:19:30,617
- Yeah.
[chuckling]

405
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:31,825
- Good to see you, Brutus.

406
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,862
You do know this
is a church, right?

407
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:35,070
- And you do know
you're supposed

408
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,349
to eat that cupcake,
and not wear it.

409
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:39,764
[laughing]

410
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:40,800
You big wiener.

411
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:45,356
Pastor, did you receive
the pumpkins I sent?

412
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:46,978
- Oh yes, that was
so very kind of you.

413
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,601
We're gonna send them
home with the children

414
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:51,293
at the end of the day.
- Yes, please. Please do.

415
00:19:51,293 --> 00:19:53,813
I decided this year to
have a haunted house.

416
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:55,263
For the kiddies, you know.
- Oh that's a lovely idea.

417
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:57,886
- For the children.
- Of course, yes, yes.

418
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:00,337
- Guys guys guys.

419
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,823
- Pastor, could I please
make an announcement?

420
00:20:03,823 --> 00:20:04,927
- I don't see why not.

421
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:06,584
Please do, please do.

422
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,933
- Ladies and gentlemen,
all you good people.

423
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,213
As you probably know,

424
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,318
my great great
great grandfather,

425
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:19,045
Cornelius Snivley,
helped this town

426
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:21,150
by building homes for the people

427
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,567
who worked in his gold mines.

428
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,465
But what you
probably didn't know

429
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:28,848
is that he used his
own money, generously,

430
00:20:28,848 --> 00:20:30,401
to build this old church.

431
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,094
Yes, well, I wanted
to let you know

432
00:20:34,094 --> 00:20:36,235
that I'll be having
a haunted house

433
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,754
at my house for you
guys to come over.

434
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:41,067
It'll be a good time,
so please, please,

435
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:43,000
bring the kiddies over, yes.

436
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,071
And in the spirit of Halloween,

437
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:48,108
we'll be having a
jack-O-lantern carving contest.

438
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:51,042
Where we'll be giving children
all these sharp knives

439
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,838
so they can carve
up the pumpkins.

440
00:20:53,838 --> 00:20:56,013
[laughing maniacally]

441
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:59,119
Yes, so children, come
get your knives, please.

442
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:03,986
- Let's thank Mr. Snively.
- Snivley. It's Snivley.

443
00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:05,229
[all clapping]

444
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:07,300
- Mr. Snivley, for the pumpkins.

445
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,922
Not so much the knives,

446
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:11,994
but have a great trunk
or treat, everyone.

447
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,619
- This is the reason we
don't invite him to things.

448
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:16,758
He's a menace.

449
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:19,036
My gosh, knives to children?

450
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,003
I can't even imagine.

451
00:21:21,003 --> 00:21:22,626
Good grief, this is ridiculous.

452
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:25,870
[upbeat music resumes]

453
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,114
- Is that it?

454
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:31,255
My stomach's gonna
be as empty as yours.

455
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:33,464
[laughing]

456
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:39,643
[ominous music]

457
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,238
- Yes, Mr. Mayor.

458
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:52,483
Yes, sir.
[knocking on door]

459
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:54,968
Yes, Mr. Mayor, yes, okay.

460
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:59,456
Okay, uh huh, okay, alright.

461
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:01,734
Bye bye, alright,
yeah, enjoy your lunch.

462
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:03,011
Alright, bye Mr. Mayor.

463
00:22:05,185 --> 00:22:07,498
- Pastor, are you okay?

464
00:22:07,498 --> 00:22:10,432
- Yeah, it's just,
it's all these calls.

465
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,916
The Mayor every five minutes,

466
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,505
and I assured him these are not

467
00:22:14,505 --> 00:22:16,196
the plights of
the Old Testament.

468
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:19,407
- So let it be written,
so let it be done.

469
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:21,719
- Bob.
- What? Yul Brynner.

470
00:22:22,893 --> 00:22:25,205
- Anyways, what can
I do for you guys?

471
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:28,105
- Well Pastor, Rusty's
been having nightmares.

472
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:30,728
- Chloe's staying up all
night, she's not sleeping.

473
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:33,662
- And Blinkie's been
terrified all week.

474
00:22:33,662 --> 00:22:35,940
- Well, nightmares and dreams

475
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,218
are a way for God to
communicate to us,

476
00:22:38,218 --> 00:22:40,773
and we all interpret
them differently.

477
00:22:40,773 --> 00:22:42,499
- Yeah, but they seem to
be getting a lot worse.

478
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:44,535
- Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah.

479
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:45,778
- Well you just
have to stay strong

480
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,573
and remember that
no matter what,

481
00:22:47,573 --> 00:22:49,402
God is in control.

482
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:52,543
- Pastor, we love you
and we love the church,

483
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:54,614
but we are seriously
thinking about moving away.

484
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:56,202
- Yes.
- Yeah.

485
00:22:56,202 --> 00:22:57,790
- You know, I truly
hate to see that

486
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,137
from any family
here in Henderson,

487
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:02,519
but I understand
that you have to do

488
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,383
what's best for your family.

489
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,487
- Thank you Pastor.

490
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:07,316
- Thank you.
- Let me walk you out.

491
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:15,808
[crowd yelling and exclaiming]

492
00:23:25,852 --> 00:23:26,819
- Now now.

493
00:23:28,027 --> 00:23:30,409
Now now, everyone, calm
down please, calm down.

494
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:34,620
When in the course of human
events as a community,

495
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,243
we must come together
to participate-

496
00:23:37,243 --> 00:23:38,934
- Oh blah blah blah!

497
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:40,936
Stuff it, Mr. Mayor, come on!

498
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:42,110
Tell us the truth.

499
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,629
- Why are these strange
things happening,

500
00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:45,458
and what are you doing to
find out who's doing them?

501
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,908
- Well, I can assure you-

502
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:48,668
- Then tell us the truth, Mayor!

503
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:50,532
- You can't handle the truth!

504
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:51,740
- We can handle it,

505
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,983
and we need to know the truth

506
00:23:52,983 --> 00:23:54,950
so we can protect
our kids and homes.

507
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,332
- Yeah, come on.

508
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:58,575
You know, if it
was left up to me,

509
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:00,749
I'd sell my house
right now and move.

510
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:02,717
- Yeah.
[all exclaiming]

511
00:24:02,717 --> 00:24:03,752
- Who would even think about

512
00:24:03,752 --> 00:24:05,133
buying in Henderson now?

513
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:07,135
- I would.
- Who are you?

514
00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:08,723
- I am Benjamin Schafer.

515
00:24:10,103 --> 00:24:12,312
And my client is prepared
to make fair offers

516
00:24:12,312 --> 00:24:14,176
on all your homes.

517
00:24:14,176 --> 00:24:16,282
- Oh, alright.
- Cash offers.

518
00:24:16,282 --> 00:24:17,490
[all exclaiming]

519
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,699
- You know what,
show me the money.

520
00:24:19,699 --> 00:24:22,012
- Now hold up here, hold up.

521
00:24:22,012 --> 00:24:24,773
Who is your client?

522
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:26,326
- Brutus Snivley.

523
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:27,811
- Oh.

524
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:30,020
- Do you mean old man Snively?

525
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,055
- No, Snivley.

526
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:33,541
I've heard it both ways.

527
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:36,336
And I've got the contracts
right here, so come on up.

528
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:38,856
Mr. Snivley believes
that no one should live

529
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:40,099
in Henderson in fear.

530
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:42,481
So let's make a deal.

531
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,447
[crowd exclaiming]

532
00:24:43,447 --> 00:24:44,724

00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:16,771
What kind of pie was it, Timmy?

712
00:31:16,771 --> 00:31:18,600
- Cherry, it's my favorite.

713
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,154
You guys can have
some if you'd like.

714
00:31:20,154 --> 00:31:22,121
- Yum I like pie.
- Yuck.

715
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:24,296
You can't pay me a million
dollars to eat that pie.

716
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:25,953
But you better eat it before

717
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:27,195
the creature from
Dead Man's Island

718
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:29,197
comes across the Ohio
Bridge to eat you!

719
00:31:30,543 --> 00:31:32,476
My great grandfather
Snivley swears

720
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:35,134
he saw the creature
from Dead Man's Island.

721
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:37,378
He saw the back of the creature.

722
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:39,656
It looked like a giant
with long, scraggly hair.

723
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:42,314
And when it turned around,

724
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:43,867
[screams]

725
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:46,905
[boys laughing]

726
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,562

[screaming]

729
00:31:57,053 --> 00:31:57,881
- Monster!

730
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,989
[suspenseful music]

731
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:08,133
- What are you looking at?
[dance music]

732
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:09,824
- Oh...

733
00:32:09,824 --> 00:32:11,274
- Are you okay?

734
00:32:11,274 --> 00:32:12,206
- Give me a minute.

735
00:32:12,206 --> 00:32:14,001
- Alright Mayor, you take care.

736
00:32:15,554 --> 00:32:18,212
[music resumes]

737
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:22,975
- Hey!

738
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:28,567
- [All] S'mores!

739
00:32:29,844 --> 00:32:31,950
[laughing]

740
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,123
- Now go away.

741
00:32:34,228 --> 00:32:35,056
Hoodlums.

742
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:38,853
[music resumes]

743
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:45,618
[upbeat music]

744
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:48,656
- Why do you have all
those keys, anyways?

745
00:32:48,656 --> 00:32:49,933
- 'Cause when you have sisters

746
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:51,970
that lock you in
closets, ya learn.

747
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,798
Come on!

748
00:32:55,421 --> 00:32:56,526
- Come on, Rusty.

749
00:32:58,114 --> 00:33:00,702
- Guys, maybe this isn't
such the best idea.

750
00:33:00,702 --> 00:33:02,463
- Snivley's up to
something, I just know it.

751
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:05,293
Plus, it's just snooping
around. Come on!

752
00:33:05,293 --> 00:33:08,124
- Now, we got plenty
of barrels of blood.

753
00:33:08,124 --> 00:33:10,298
And plenty of rotten,
smelly pumpkins.

754
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:13,405
But we need more poison
ivy and poison oak.

755
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:15,717
Especially in the
torture maze right there,

756
00:33:15,717 --> 00:33:17,754
where the kiddies are
coming down the halls.

757
00:33:17,754 --> 00:33:19,687
And take 'em down.
- Guys, guys.

758
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:21,585
He's got a timer set.

759
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:23,829
- Yeah, they're gonna smell
that pumpkin, it stinks.

760
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:26,004
And then we're gonna, I know,

761
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,557
and then they're gonna turn, oh,

762
00:33:27,557 --> 00:33:29,421
what are you getting at, Elmer?

763
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:30,422
No! Get out!

764
00:33:30,422 --> 00:33:32,458
Look at, go! Hurry up!

765
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:34,909
Go, hurry up! Come
on, Snowflake.

766
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:36,600
Come on, let's get
'em, let's get them.

767
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,845
They're bite size.
[children yelling]

768
00:33:39,845 --> 00:33:42,296
- They're coming, go!
- Guys, go!

769
00:33:42,296 --> 00:33:44,746
Come on, hurry.
- Go, go! Run!

770
00:33:46,196 --> 00:33:48,785
[men groaning]
[children yelling]

771
00:33:48,785 --> 00:33:51,339

[both yelling and exclaiming]

782
00:35:35,995 --> 00:35:37,894

[children chattering]

784
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:47,283
- Oh yeah. Oh hey, hey guys.

785
00:35:47,283 --> 00:35:48,146
Come here.

786
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:52,426
So, is there anything-
- Geek!

787
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:54,945
- Geek!
- It's okay.

788
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,051
- [Both] They're just jerks.

789
00:35:57,051 --> 00:35:59,502
- So, did anything
happen to y'all guys

790
00:35:59,502 --> 00:36:01,228
after the lightning at church?

791
00:36:02,332 --> 00:36:04,886
I can cast spells, guys!
[all exclaiming]

792
00:36:04,886 --> 00:36:06,819
- Guys, time out,
time out, time out.

793
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:09,167
So, what happened to us
is what scientists call

794
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,823
electromagnetic
transfer osmosis,

795
00:36:10,823 --> 00:36:12,066
and according to them,

796
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:13,274
it can be pretty serious.
- What?

797
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:15,380
- Don't ask me about it,
we'll be here all day.

798
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,451
- All I care is that
maybe we can stop Stivley

799
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:19,798
from running-
- Scaring.

800
00:36:19,798 --> 00:36:21,558
- Scaring everyone
out of Henderson.

801
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:23,111
- There has to be a
logical solution to this.

802
00:36:23,111 --> 00:36:25,113
It's crazy.
- Yeah, well.

803
00:36:25,113 --> 00:36:27,875
I think it's gonna take
a lot more than logic.

804
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:30,188
Like a miracle.
- Definitely, yeah.

805
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,086
- Let's meet up at the
tree house tonight,

806
00:36:32,086 --> 00:36:33,881
and see what we can
do with our powers.

807
00:36:33,881 --> 00:36:34,951
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

808
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:36,021
See you all there.
- Bye.

809
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:39,507
- Tammy, Tammy, Tammy!

810
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:43,339
[children cheering]

811
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:44,616
- Lucky shot.

812
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:46,134
- Okay, whatever you
say, little brother.

813
00:36:46,134 --> 00:36:47,481
- Just because you're
two minutes older,

814
00:36:47,481 --> 00:36:48,654
doesn't make a difference.

815
00:36:48,654 --> 00:36:49,931
- Oh it still matters!
- And you better

816
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:51,933
put that stick down.
- Hey, break it up!

817
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:54,384
Have a seat.

818
00:36:58,146 --> 00:37:00,045
- I'm not sitting
in that girly seat.

819
00:37:00,045 --> 00:37:02,012
- It's not that big
of a deal, Tommy.

820
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:07,915
- Anyone have any
ideas about Snivley?

821
00:37:12,885 --> 00:37:13,714
- Guys, come on.

822
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:14,749
Nobody has any ideas?

823
00:37:18,063 --> 00:37:21,653
- Guys, I could cast
some nasty spells on him.

824
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:26,140
[ominous music]

825
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:31,835
[bright jingling]

826
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:35,253
- Good morning, dark shine.

827
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,771
You handsome devil, you.

828
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:39,291
You're no Beetlejuice, but
you're still pretty good.

829
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:42,467

Oh, there you are
again, Mr. Handsome!

833
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,376
[grumbling]

834
00:37:57,585 --> 00:37:59,484
- That should stop him.

835
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:02,935
[upbeat music]

836
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:07,733
- What are you looking
at, sweetie poo?

837
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:10,149
I'm not gonna read you
a bedtime story tonight.

838
00:38:10,149 --> 00:38:10,978
Stop.

839
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:17,225
[ominous music]
[cane tapping]

840
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,298
- Get out of here, mutt!

841
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:26,752
My great great great grandson?

842
00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:30,687
You are besmirching
the Snivley name.

843
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:32,586
You must stop with
your evil plan

844
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:35,036
to chase the people
from Henderson.

845
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:40,007
Or, you will be cursed
with these plagues forever.

846
00:38:40,939 --> 00:38:43,321
And for goodness sakes,

847
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,393
take off that
ridiculous hat in bed.

848
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:50,328
- You gave this town to the
people, but I want it back!

849
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,777
And soon, I'll get it back.

850
00:38:51,777 --> 00:38:53,400
Tomorrow's the day
that will never end

851
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,884
for the people of Henderson.

852
00:38:54,884 --> 00:38:56,334
- You're despicable!

853
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,300
- I am not!

854
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,577
- You're deplorable!

855
00:38:58,577 --> 00:38:59,440
- Am not!

856
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,890
- Uh huh so!

857
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,755
In fact, you're a jerk!

858
00:39:05,446 --> 00:39:07,448
- I'm not a jerk, am I?

859
00:39:07,448 --> 00:39:10,486
Sweetie poo?
[ominous howling]

860
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:14,835
[school bell ringing]

861
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:17,769
[lockers rattling]

862
00:39:18,597 --> 00:39:19,529
- What?

863
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:21,151
- I've been thinking.

864
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:23,637
Maybe we can't defeat Snivley,

865
00:39:23,637 --> 00:39:25,363
but maybe we can
defeat the boiler.

866
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:28,676
We could always check
it out during lunch.

867
00:39:28,676 --> 00:39:30,678
- I mean, it's worth a shot,

868
00:39:30,678 --> 00:39:32,922
but you really think
you can fix a boiler?

869
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:37,478
After last night, I'm
not sure what we can do.

870
00:39:37,478 --> 00:39:39,584
- I'm not too worried
about the boiler.

871
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:44,589
I'm worried about a
much bigger problem.

872
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:47,730
- Alright let's go, let's go!

873
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,731
Single file.

874
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,700
File single. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

875
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:56,255
Speed it up, speed it up,
speed it up, speed it up.

876
00:39:56,255 --> 00:39:57,602
Go go go go go.

877
00:39:57,602 --> 00:40:00,225
[upbeat music]

878
00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:08,716
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa.

879
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:10,062
Respect my authority.

880
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:13,963
Slow, S-L-O-W.

881
00:40:13,963 --> 00:40:14,895
- Blinkie.
- What?

882
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:15,827
- If you can use those keys

883
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:17,069
to get us into the boiler room,

884
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:18,864
I have something to keep
Rambo from finding us.

885
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:20,072
- What?

886
00:40:20,072 --> 00:40:22,247
- That's for me to know
and you to find out.

887
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:24,663
- You sound like my grandpa.

888
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:26,251
Like, really?

889
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,151
But I mean, we can try it.

890
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,292
[stammering]

891
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:35,122
- Not in my house.

892
00:40:35,122 --> 00:40:37,262
That litter needs a babysitter.

893
00:40:37,262 --> 00:40:39,298
Put your baby in the crib.

894
00:40:39,298 --> 00:40:41,439
A-ha! Get to stepping.

895
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,443
Kids today, I tell you.

896
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,169
- So, Rusty. What
you got for Rambo?

897
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:49,377
- Come on, I'll show you.

898

901
00:41:06,602 --> 00:41:07,982
- Whoa.

902
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:09,501
That's impressive.

903
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:14,126
Is that a kitty cat
on school property?

904
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:17,095
Oh no, not today,
mister whiskers.

905
00:41:17,095 --> 00:41:18,337
No way.

906
00:41:18,337 --> 00:41:19,407
We need some nails.

907
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:23,481
Mm, yeah. [muffled speech]

908
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,104
There you go my
friend. [laughing]

909
00:41:26,104 --> 00:41:29,107
Yeah, little kitty
cat, you're mine.

910
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:32,835
[ominous music]

911
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,361
[Rambo whistling]

912
00:41:45,226 --> 00:41:46,020
Oh no.

913
00:41:47,366 --> 00:41:50,197
Not today. Not in my family.

914
00:41:50,197 --> 00:41:53,269
A discarded can of a
carbonated beverage?

915
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:56,134
Hey mister beverage,
do you like magic?

916
00:41:56,134 --> 00:41:59,862
'Cause I'm gonna
make you disappear.

917
00:41:59,862 --> 00:42:01,208
Yeah, see? Voila.

918
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,486
Oh yeah.

919
00:42:05,246 --> 00:42:07,283
That's that. Let's go, buddy.

920
00:42:07,283 --> 00:42:08,871
My work here is done.

921
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:14,739
[ominous music]

922
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:17,017
Wait a minute.

923
00:42:17,017 --> 00:42:18,225
I know that smell.

924
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:21,780
Is that, is that
an ocean breeze?

925
00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:24,576
Is that a rhinoceros?

926
00:42:27,268 --> 00:42:32,273
Oh no, I know for a fact
that's teenage trouble makers.

927
00:42:33,481 --> 00:42:35,932
I know that smell, and
I'm coming to get ya.

928
00:42:35,932 --> 00:42:37,624
- Wait, wait, wait.

929
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:38,694
Do you have a key?

930
00:42:38,694 --> 00:42:39,557
- Yeah.

931
00:42:40,765 --> 00:42:41,938
- Come on.

932
00:42:41,938 --> 00:42:43,561
- Here.

933
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,941
There's a button.

934
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:50,015
[indistinct whispering]

935
00:42:51,776 --> 00:42:54,192
- Oh, so this is where
they keep all this junk.

936
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:55,676
- Yeah, no kidding.

937
00:42:55,676 --> 00:42:57,436
- Whoa whoa whoa!

[all coughing]

940
00:43:05,513 --> 00:43:06,998

[all coughing and exclaiming]
[suspenseful music]

942
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:20,736
- What are you doing?
It doesn't work!

943
00:43:20,736 --> 00:43:22,669
- This is so I can tell

944
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:24,049
the computer to
have the iron away.

945
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:26,707
- What is iron away?
[yelling]

946
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:29,607
[whooshing]
[kids exclaiming]

947
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,332
- What does that mean?

948
00:43:31,332 --> 00:43:33,369
- Now, guys, now!

949
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:34,888
[yelling]

950
00:43:34,888 --> 00:43:37,097

[farting noise]

953
00:43:44,518 --> 00:43:45,830

Let's go, let's go!

[ominous music]

956
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:59,429

[people chattering]

958
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:05,021
I'm not really sure what
happened, but we're okay, right?

959
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:05,850
Hey guys.

960
00:44:08,611 --> 00:44:09,923
I think we got our miracle.

961
00:44:09,923 --> 00:44:11,062
The heat's back on!

962
00:44:11,062 --> 00:44:15,894
Woo!
[all clapping]

963
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:17,137
Either somebody up there

964
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:19,726
or somebody down here
really loves us, right?

965
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:20,658
Alright.
[ominous music]

966
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,212
Let's get this mess cleaned up.

967
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:28,631
- Here, kitty kitty kitty.

968
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:30,668
Where are you?

Meow?

970
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:35,638
Kitty, kitty, where
are you, kitty?

971
00:44:38,261 --> 00:44:39,193
Ah...kitty?

[knocking on wood]

973
00:44:43,094 --> 00:44:45,130
Kitty...[smacking lips]

974
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,650
Kitty kitty kitty, meow, meow?

975
00:44:49,997 --> 00:44:51,516
Here, kitty kitty.

976
00:44:53,069 --> 00:44:54,657
Here, kitty.

00:44:54,657 --> 00:44:56,866
Where are you at, kitty?

978
00:44:56,866 --> 00:44:57,695
Come here.

- Well hey, Mr.
Schnitz...Schnitzel...

982
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,172
Schnizelnagen?
- That's okay.

983
00:45:27,172 --> 00:45:28,242
You can call me Rambo.

984
00:45:28,242 --> 00:45:30,451
- Okay, Mr. Rambo, welcome.

985
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:33,696
Whose cat does this belong to?

986
00:45:33,696 --> 00:45:35,525
- Here, here, you take kitty.

987
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:38,011
- No, no, I couldn't.
- Yeah, please.

988
00:45:38,011 --> 00:45:41,600

take it, take it, take it,

989
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,328
take it!
[children cheering]

990
00:45:45,328 --> 00:45:46,951
- Alright.

991
00:45:46,951 --> 00:45:48,435
So, what should I name it?

992
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:51,438
[children chattering]

993
00:45:51,438 --> 00:45:52,266
- Decoy, yeah.

994
00:45:53,612 --> 00:45:54,924
- What about Decoy?

995
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,203
- Decoy, okay.

996
00:45:59,342 --> 00:46:01,897
Everybody, meet Decoy.

997
00:46:01,897 --> 00:46:05,486

[bell tower ringing]
[engine rumbling]

1000
00:46:20,536 --> 00:46:21,709
- Hey bud, how was school?

1001
00:46:21,709 --> 00:46:23,815
- Well, I made a kitten
magically appear,

1002
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:26,369
and...
- Harry Potter!

1003
00:46:27,646 --> 00:46:28,475
- Stop.

1004
00:46:29,856 --> 00:46:33,066
Oh, I faked out a
security guy, Rambo.

1005
00:46:33,066 --> 00:46:34,239
- Did you say Rambo?

1006
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,864
As in, he drew
first blood, not me.

1007
00:46:37,864 --> 00:46:40,452
- Oh my gosh, please stop.

1008
00:46:40,452 --> 00:46:42,006
I fixed the school boiler room.

1009
00:46:43,421 --> 00:46:44,284
- Hey, check this out.

1010
00:46:44,284 --> 00:46:45,354
It's the weather app.

1011
00:46:46,424 --> 00:46:48,564
Why is it so sunny out for?

1012
00:46:48,564 --> 00:46:49,772
- I don't know.
- Well,

1013
00:46:49,772 --> 00:46:51,774
if things don't
change around here,

1014
00:46:51,774 --> 00:46:53,017
your mother and I have agreed

1015
00:46:53,017 --> 00:46:54,708
that we're hasta la vista, baby.

1016
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:55,985
We're out of Henderson.

1017
00:46:55,985 --> 00:46:58,194
- That's not funny.

1018
00:46:58,194 --> 00:46:59,851
- This is crazy.

1019
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:01,370
I mean, did you guys understand

1020
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,785
in the boiler room last night?

1021
00:47:02,785 --> 00:47:04,891
What did she mean
about the pressure?

1022
00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:06,444
- It's confusing.

1023
00:47:06,444 --> 00:47:08,653
- Well I told you guys
it had to fart, right?

1024
00:47:08,653 --> 00:47:10,103
- That's gross.
- Better out than in.

1025
00:47:10,103 --> 00:47:11,587
- It's still gross.
- Wait.

1026
00:47:11,587 --> 00:47:13,037
So why are we here, anyway?

1027
00:47:13,037 --> 00:47:17,489
- Well, there's good news
and there's bad news.

1028
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:21,252
Bad news is, the sun
is still shining.

1029
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:24,048
- The good news is,
we're all still alive!

1030
00:47:25,187 --> 00:47:27,845
Wait, do you remember
was Snively said?

1031
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,847
Tomorrow, there will be no night

1032
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,296
for the people of Henderson.

1033
00:47:31,296 --> 00:47:32,815
- Well how can he turn
the night into day?

1034
00:47:32,815 --> 00:47:34,852
- Well, through my
extensive research, guys,

1035
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,199
I've found irrefutable
evidence online

1036
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:40,202
that he's using satellites,
real live satellites,

1037
00:47:40,202 --> 00:47:41,341
with mirrors on them,

1038
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,206
to shine light from
other parts of the world

1039
00:47:44,206 --> 00:47:46,242
down onto us here in Henderson.

1040
00:47:46,242 --> 00:47:47,485
- And you just happened
to discover that

1041
00:47:47,485 --> 00:47:49,142
in the last 24 hours.

1042
00:47:49,142 --> 00:47:51,178
I mean, is that the bad
news, or can I get worse?

1043
00:47:51,178 --> 00:47:53,008
- Well, if he can do that-

1044
00:47:53,008 --> 00:47:54,630
- Then he won't
have much trouble

1045
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:57,357
activating the earthquake
to destroy Henderson.

1046
00:47:57,357 --> 00:47:58,703
- Yeah.

1047
00:47:58,703 --> 00:48:00,532
- [Both] Or people
from leaving Henderson.

1048
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:03,328
- Hi.

1049
00:48:03,328 --> 00:48:04,985
- Dinner's here already?

1050
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,575
- Oh, they're a little
early today, aren't they?

1051
00:48:08,575 --> 00:48:09,817
- Hey y'all, how you doing?

1052
00:48:09,817 --> 00:48:12,268
- Aren't you early
for Meals on Wheels?

1053
00:48:12,268 --> 00:48:13,821
- Well it's 7:30.

1054
00:48:13,821 --> 00:48:15,133
- No, it can't be.

1055
00:48:16,169 --> 00:48:17,584
- Oh, well, you know,

1056
00:48:17,584 --> 00:48:19,241
we're having some
pretty strange weather.

1057
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:21,139
- Yeah.
- It's been kinda weird.

1058
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:22,761
- That's true.
- You guys have a great day.

1059
00:48:22,761 --> 00:48:24,487
- Alright thank you.
- Bye bye.

1060
00:48:24,487 --> 00:48:29,492
- Bye bye.
[birds chirping]

1061
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:34,808
- Hey Tammy.

1062
00:48:34,808 --> 00:48:36,396
What's wrong, babe?

1063
00:48:36,396 --> 00:48:37,915
Oh, you know you're not supposed

1064
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,813
to use this phone unless
it's an emergency, right?

1065
00:48:39,813 --> 00:48:41,125

your sister that way.

there anything you can do?

00:56:10,643 --> 00:56:12,886
It's ours, Snowflake.

1239
00:56:12,886 --> 00:56:15,164
Those suckers are gone.

1240
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:18,064
[melancholy music]

1241
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:45,358
- Okay Samson, go outside.

1242
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:50,018
Oh, leave the squirrels alone!

1243
00:57:52,641 --> 00:57:55,333
[music resumes]

1244
00:57:59,234 --> 00:58:01,650
[dog barking]

1245
00:58:17,148 --> 00:58:19,772
Hey guys, watch this video
I just took of Samson.

1246
00:58:20,669 --> 00:58:22,602
[suspenseful music]

1247
00:58:22,602 --> 00:58:24,155
[dog barking]

1248
00:58:24,155 --> 00:58:28,366
- Wait, why does he still
have his powers but we don't?

1249
00:58:28,366 --> 00:58:30,437
- Because, he never stopped
believing in himself,

1250
00:58:30,437 --> 00:58:32,509
and Samson believed he
could get the squirrel.

1251
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,027
So he never lost his confidence.

1252
00:58:34,027 --> 00:58:36,996
- She's right, he never
did stop believing, guys.

1253
00:58:36,996 --> 00:58:37,859
We did, though.

1254
00:58:38,894 --> 00:58:40,171
We may all be intelligent,

1255
00:58:40,171 --> 00:58:42,519
but we'd have to work
very smart this time.

1256
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,210
- What about now, though?

1257
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:47,696
- You guys, we can stop Snivley,

1258
00:58:47,696 --> 00:58:49,802
but we have to start
believing again.

1259
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:52,667
- It's like Ms. Hoffman said.

1260
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:54,979
All we have to do is
have courage and believe.

1261
00:58:56,153 --> 00:58:59,501
- I mean guys, if
a dog can do it.

1262
00:58:59,501 --> 00:59:02,159
- Based off of this film
that she just showed us,

1263
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:05,024
I do believe that with
literal to no chance of error,

1264
00:59:05,024 --> 00:59:08,165
we can definitely
kick Snivley's behind.

1265
00:59:08,165 --> 00:59:09,166
[all clapping and cheering]

1266
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:10,547
- Guys, guys.

1267
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,756
I need to take a reality check.

1268
00:59:12,756 --> 00:59:15,621
So, tomorrow, meet
me in the gym.

1269
00:59:15,621 --> 00:59:17,381
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

1270
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:23,525
[students exclaiming]

1271
00:59:23,525 --> 00:59:26,355
- That hurt.
- I've had enough.

1272
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:27,943
[chimes ringing]

1273
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:30,152
[child yelling]
[students laughing]

1274
00:59:30,152 --> 00:59:31,533
I still got it.

1275
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:33,880
- Alright, hey
guys, guys, come on.

1276
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,124
Alright, I got a
plan for tonight.

1277
00:59:36,124 --> 00:59:38,264
Snivley's gonna wish he never
made that haunted house.

1278
00:59:38,264 --> 00:59:42,682
- [All] Yeah!
[playful music]

1279
00:59:42,682 --> 00:59:44,788
- Are you ready?
- This looks so cool.

1280
00:59:44,788 --> 00:59:46,375
- Are you having fun tonight?
- Yeah.

1281
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:48,446
[playful music]
[laughing]

1282
00:59:48,446 --> 00:59:51,449
[people chattering]

1283
00:59:54,487 --> 00:59:57,179
- Welcome, welcome everyone,
to my haunted house.

1284
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,286
- I think it's okay,
mom, it's okay.

1285
01:00:00,286 --> 01:00:01,943
- Are you sure?
- Come on, come on.

1286
01:00:01,943 --> 01:00:03,600
- You guys, be careful.
- Come on.

1287
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,050
- A trick? No, I've
got a treat for you!

1288
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:08,363
Come on in, come
on up, step on up.

1289
01:00:08,363 --> 01:00:09,847
Yes, enjoy the haunted house.

1290
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:12,401
- Haunted house? Yes!
- No no no no.

1291
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:14,265
Please, it's for
the children only.

1292
01:00:14,265 --> 01:00:15,991
Yes, I'm sure you'll understand.

1293
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:17,821
Now make way, come on.

1294
01:00:17,821 --> 01:00:19,063
Yes, come on.

1295
01:00:19,063 --> 01:00:22,308
Come on, kiddos, yes.
[all chattering]

1296
01:00:22,308 --> 01:00:23,240
- Alright, see ya.

1297
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,104
- You guys stay together.

1298
01:00:25,104 --> 01:00:26,899
- Let's go.
- Be careful, guys.

1299
01:00:26,899 --> 01:00:28,625
- Stay together!
- Yes yes.

1300
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,419
- Text me, Madi.
- They'll be fine.

1301
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:31,835
They're in good hands.

1302
01:00:31,835 --> 01:00:33,146
I'm sure you understand.

1303
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,152
- Are we sure about this?
- I don't know.

1304
01:00:39,152 --> 01:00:41,361
- Not a good feeling.
[laughing]

1305
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:43,398
- It's good to see
you again, children.

1306
01:00:43,398 --> 01:00:44,813
[laughing]
[ominous music]

1307
01:00:44,813 --> 01:00:47,644
Well come along.
Come right this way.

Yes, come on.

Come on, follow me.

[distant screaming]
[children chattering]

1312
01:01:01,071 --> 01:01:02,935
- I'm scared!

1313
01:01:02,935 --> 01:01:04,833
I want to get out
of here, it's scary!

1314
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:08,699
- I want to go home.
- Guys we need to get out.

1315
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:11,150
- Guys guys guys guys.

1316
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,808
Calm down. It's just
a haunted house.

1317
01:01:13,808 --> 01:01:16,224
- Still!
- We need to find Snivley.

1318
01:01:16,224 --> 01:01:18,882
- Yeah, and, I could
climb the hole,

1319
01:01:18,882 --> 01:01:20,228
and find the door.

1320
01:01:20,228 --> 01:01:21,954
- We'll come, lead
down to the lab.

1321
01:01:21,954 --> 01:01:23,818
- Alright guys.
[crosstalk]

1322
01:01:23,818 --> 01:01:27,028
- Next time I see him,
I'm gonna freeze him!

1323
01:01:27,028 --> 01:01:28,719
- I'll get the butcher,
you get the shadow.

1324
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:31,032
- Yep, you get the butcher,
I'll get the shadow.

1325
01:01:31,032 --> 01:01:34,380
[metal clanking]
[woman screaming]

1326
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:39,005
- So, your friends have
left you all alone, huh?

1327
01:01:39,005 --> 01:01:40,662
[whooshing]

1328
01:01:40,662 --> 01:01:41,974
- Nice one.
- Thanks.

1329
01:01:43,078 --> 01:01:44,114
- Should I un-freeze him?

1330
01:01:44,114 --> 01:01:45,460
- Probably not.

1331
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,289
- A proud moment, though.
- Should be.

1332
01:01:47,289 --> 01:01:52,260
[growling]
[blades clinking]

1333
01:01:59,336 --> 01:02:02,132

01:02:02,132 --> 01:02:03,720
- Thank you.

1335
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,169
- I got down to the lab,

1336
01:02:05,169 --> 01:02:06,205
and I found a door.

1337
01:02:06,205 --> 01:02:07,447
- Okay let's go.
- Let's go!

1338
01:02:07,447 --> 01:02:11,728
- Come on, guys.
[ominous music]

1339
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,177
- Alright come on, hurry.

1340
01:02:13,177 --> 01:02:15,179
This is that monitor I
saw when we were snooping.

1341
01:02:15,179 --> 01:02:16,111
- Okay.
- Alright.

1342
01:02:17,941 --> 01:02:20,357
Crap, we still only got
three minutes, though.

1343
01:02:20,357 --> 01:02:21,772
- 'Til what?

1344
01:02:21,772 --> 01:02:23,670
- 'Til the earthquake
wipes out all of Henderson.

1345
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:26,363
- I can change the
coordinates too.

1346
01:02:26,363 --> 01:02:29,746
I'm the expert here, but it
will still be three minutes.

1347
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,677
- Alright we'll do that.

1348
01:02:30,677 --> 01:02:31,886
- Got it.
- Alright great.

1349
01:02:32,852 --> 01:02:35,061
Wait, wait. What's that thing?

1350
01:02:35,061 --> 01:02:36,753
- I don't know. Leave it.
- Who's that? Oh, oh.

1351
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,065
- Madi! Guys!
- We're coming!

1352
01:02:40,446 --> 01:02:45,347
[ominous music]
[growling]

1353
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,048
- We fixed the earthquake.

1354
01:02:56,048 --> 01:02:57,877
It's only going to
go up at the house.

1355
01:02:57,877 --> 01:02:59,120
- Okay.
- Yeah, but we've only

1356
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,431
got three minutes,
so we gotta be quick.

1357
01:03:00,431 --> 01:03:02,882
- Make that two
minutes and 30 seconds.

1358
01:03:02,882 --> 01:03:05,264
- We need to go.
- You guys go get Snivley.

1359
01:03:05,264 --> 01:03:06,886
- [All] What?

1360
01:03:06,886 --> 01:03:08,577
- Just can't leave him there.

1361
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:10,269
Us three, we'll
go. You all stay.

1362
01:03:11,373 --> 01:03:12,927
- He's done so
much to us, though.

1363
01:03:12,927 --> 01:03:15,550
- Really, after literally
everything he's done to us,

1364
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:17,103
they're gonna go get him.

1365
01:03:17,103 --> 01:03:20,106
[suspenseful music]

1366
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:22,971
- Uh oh.

1367
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:24,593
We have a problem.

1368
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:25,974
- Now him and his
goons are loose!

1369
01:03:25,974 --> 01:03:26,975
We gotta get out of here!

1370
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,908
- Army crawl!
- Army crawl!

1371
01:03:28,908 --> 01:03:29,806
- Go get the team.

1372
01:03:31,738 --> 01:03:32,878
[Brutus laughing maniacally]

1373
01:03:32,878 --> 01:03:35,052
- [Brutus] Beep beep,
manager service.

1374
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:39,436
Sheldon, you can't outsmart me.

1375
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,129
Rusty, you're no magician.

1376
01:03:44,303 --> 01:03:47,271
Tommy and Tammy, it
was me by the way

1377
01:03:47,271 --> 01:03:49,826
that ruined your birthday party.

1378
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,104
- Guys, guys, I think I
found the door, come on.

1379
01:03:52,104 --> 01:03:53,933
It's locked.

1380
01:03:53,933 --> 01:03:55,935
It's locked, it's locked!
- The key, where is it?

1381
01:03:55,935 --> 01:03:57,730
- I don't know.
[suspenseful music]

1382
01:03:57,730 --> 01:04:00,284
- Where's Rusty, where's Rusty?

[all yelling]
[banging on window]

1384
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:08,637

01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:09,846
Hey kids.
[children yelling]

1386
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,158
Back up, Rambo's

1387
01:04:12,158 --> 01:04:13,642
- Rambo, what are
you doing here?

1388
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:15,023
- Hey, I've had my
good eye on you guys

1389
01:04:15,023 --> 01:04:16,576
ever since school.

1390
01:04:16,576 --> 01:04:18,855
Ever since you
made Decoy appear.

1391
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,511
I like how you did
that, by the way,

1392
01:04:20,511 --> 01:04:21,961
that was really cool.

1393
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:23,307
So listen, kids, we ain't
got no time to waste.

1394
01:04:23,307 --> 01:04:25,516
Rambo says no more
trick or treat,

1395
01:04:25,516 --> 01:04:26,724
let's get to the street.

1396
01:04:26,724 --> 01:04:30,038
Come on kids, go!
[kids yelling]

1397
01:04:30,038 --> 01:04:31,591
Yeah that's what
I'm talking about.

1398
01:04:31,591 --> 01:04:33,179
Snivley, where you at, Snivley?

1399
01:04:33,179 --> 01:04:35,285
Hey, I got something for you.

1400

[all yelling and exclaiming]
[ominous music]

1401
01:04:44,501 --> 01:04:47,400

[people yelling]

1403
01:04:51,611 --> 01:04:52,716
- Wait a minute, I never
missed a court date.

1404
01:04:52,716 --> 01:04:53,890
What's the big idea, mister?

1405
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,203

01:04:58,964 --> 01:05:01,035
- No, stop, please!

1408
01:05:01,035 --> 01:05:04,003
Officer, I have a
medical condition.

1409
01:05:04,003 --> 01:05:05,832
I'm Alcatraz-intolerant!

[ominous music]
[fire rumbling]

1414
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:20,295
Please, don't.

1415
01:05:20,295 --> 01:05:21,814
I've got a lot to do yet.

1416
01:05:21,814 --> 01:05:24,230
No, not Mr. Topper,
give him back!

1417
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:25,645
Hey, Mr. Topper!

1418
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:29,373
[muffled wailing]

1419
01:05:29,373 --> 01:05:31,410

Alright, fantastic.

Well thank you all
for being here today.

At today's celebration

of our own Halloween Heroes.

1426
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:58,333
- An awards ceremony, ha!

1427
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,128
Look at 'em up there.

1428
01:06:00,128 --> 01:06:02,751
This whole town should
have been mine, all mine.

1429
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:04,305
And I would've had it
all, too, you know.

1430
01:06:04,305 --> 01:06:06,134
- Oh, before we get started,

1431
01:06:06,134 --> 01:06:07,653
I would like to ask Pastor Dale

1432
01:06:07,653 --> 01:06:10,380

And thank you all for coming.

1437
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,113
Let us pray.

1438
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:23,289
Lord, we thank you for
having such fine young people

1439
01:06:23,289 --> 01:06:26,120
in our community as
the Halloween Heroes.

1440
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:30,745
Young people with such strong
values of right and wrong,

1441
01:06:30,745 --> 01:06:32,850
of courage and character,

1442
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,093
that was passed down to them

1443
01:06:34,093 --> 01:06:36,751
from their wonderful
parents and elders.

1444
01:06:36,751 --> 01:06:39,926
We thank you, lord,
and those crazy kids.

1445
01:06:39,926 --> 01:06:41,273
Amen.

- Yes, yes.

1448
01:06:46,243 --> 01:06:49,177
Yes, amen indeed. Alright.

1449
01:06:49,177 --> 01:06:53,009
Well, first of all,
I have wonderful news

1450
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,011
for the entire community.

1451
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:58,117
With some of the gold that
was mined from under the city,

1452
01:06:58,117 --> 01:07:00,430
thanks to my people,

1453
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:04,675
we are going to build
a community center

1454
01:07:04,675 --> 01:07:07,230
for all the children
of Henderson.

[all clapping]

1456
01:07:08,645 --> 01:07:11,613
Yes, it's wonderful,
wonderful news.

1457
01:07:11,613 --> 01:07:13,995
And, we're going to
build it on the site

1458
01:07:13,995 --> 01:07:15,514
of the old Snivley mansion.

1459
01:07:15,514 --> 01:07:17,033
- You mean Snively!

1460
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,413
- No, it's Snivley.

1461
01:07:19,276 --> 01:07:21,416
But I've heard it both ways.

1462
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,694
So, without further ado,

1463
01:07:23,694 --> 01:07:26,456
I would like for
Principal Healy,

1464
01:07:26,456 --> 01:07:29,355
and the Halloween Heroes to
join me here on stage, please.

1465

[all clapping]

1466
01:07:32,876 --> 01:07:34,222
- I would've had it all,

1467
01:07:34,222 --> 01:07:36,121
if it weren't for
those meddling kids.

1468
01:07:37,329 --> 01:07:40,366
And Mayor Tim.
- Alright here we go.

1469
01:07:40,366 --> 01:07:42,334
For bringing an end
to the calamities

1470
01:07:42,334 --> 01:07:44,715
and disturbances
in our community,

1471
01:07:44,715 --> 01:07:48,236
and for the apprehension of
the individual responsible,

1472
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:50,307
Snivley,

1473
01:07:50,307 --> 01:07:52,068
the city of Henderson
awards this plaque

1474
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,519
of commendation and
outstanding citizenship

1475
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:59,040
to the group known as
the Halloween Heroes.

1476
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,353
Principal Healy, if
you would, please.

1478
01:08:04,597 --> 01:08:05,978

want you to know

1479
01:08:05,978 --> 01:08:08,532
how proud I am of all of you.

1480
01:08:08,532 --> 01:08:09,947
I'm gonna place this plaque

1481
01:08:09,947 --> 01:08:11,604
at the opening of our school

1482
01:08:11,604 --> 01:08:13,606
so everyone who
comes in will know,

1483
01:08:13,606 --> 01:08:16,022
as long as you believe in
yourself and have courage,

1484
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:17,403
anything is possible.

1485
01:08:17,403 --> 01:08:20,441
Including fixing
a broken boiler.

1486
01:08:20,441 --> 01:08:23,996
Congratulations, guys.

- Just one more
announcement to make.

1490
01:08:43,188 --> 01:08:44,430
My mother, of course,

1491
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:46,398
has donated some of
her famous cherry pies

1492
01:08:46,398 --> 01:08:48,124
for refreshments today.

1493
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,402
Mother, could you
please wave your hand

1494
01:08:50,402 --> 01:08:52,162
so everyone can see you.

1495
01:08:52,162 --> 01:08:54,647
Yes, thank you, thank you.

I love my Timmy.
- I do love her cherry pies.

1498
01:08:59,894 --> 01:09:02,207
- Yuck, you couldn't
pay me a million dollars

1499
01:09:02,207 --> 01:09:04,519
to eat that pie.
- Shut up, Sniffles!

1500
01:09:06,245 --> 01:09:08,523
Here's a quarter. Go
get me a candy bar.

1501
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,425
- This isn't enough.

1502
01:09:13,425 --> 01:09:14,495
- [Prisoner] Make it enough!

1503
01:09:14,495 --> 01:09:16,359
- Yes sir, Mr. Mountain, sir.

1504
01:09:17,567 --> 01:09:19,914
- And take off that
ridiculous hat!

[suspenseful music]

1506
01:09:28,612 --> 01:09:32,720
- [Blinkie] Well, I guess we
really did save Henderson.

1507
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,171
And everything has changed
for my friends and me.

1508
01:09:37,794 --> 01:09:40,072
- Wow.
- Madi found her speed

1509
01:09:40,072 --> 01:09:41,315
and her determination.

1510
01:09:41,315 --> 01:09:43,489
- That's a new track record.

1511
01:09:43,489 --> 01:09:45,836
- [Blinkie] She now
wants to be an Olympian.

[chanting]

1513
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,740
Tommy and Tammy stopped
being so competitive,

1514
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,122
and became better role models.

1515
01:09:56,122 --> 01:09:58,366

1516
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,856

1519
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:11,966
That's what I'm talking about.

1520
01:10:11,966 --> 01:10:12,794
Well done, well done.

1521
01:10:13,692 --> 01:10:14,520
Good job.

1522
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:17,178
I'm proud of you.

1523
01:10:17,178 --> 01:10:18,110
That's what I want to see.
- Good job, little brother.

1524
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,939
- It was only two minutes.

1525
01:10:22,597 --> 01:10:23,874
- He's in a class right now,

1526
01:10:23,874 --> 01:10:26,325
but I can have him call
you back when he's done.

1527
01:10:26,325 --> 01:10:28,845
- [Blinkie] Chloe really
did start her own business.

1528
01:10:28,845 --> 01:10:30,087
- Can I help you?

1529
01:10:30,087 --> 01:10:31,917
- Hi, I'm here to
fix your computers.

1530
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,059
- [Blinkie] Geek
Inc. at your service.

Here you go.
- Thank you.

1533
01:10:43,791 --> 01:10:45,241
- Okay ready?
- Let's go!

1534
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,725
- Are you sure?
- Rusty changed his name

1535
01:10:46,725 --> 01:10:48,692
to Rusty the Magnificent.

1536
01:10:48,692 --> 01:10:51,523
- Abra cadabra!

[screaming]

1538
01:10:54,733 --> 01:10:57,391
- Change me back!
- And he still uses his sister

1539
01:10:57,391 --> 01:10:58,840
for magic practice.

1540
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,911
- Well hurry up
and change me back!

1541
01:11:00,911 --> 01:11:01,705
- Okay.

1542
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:06,400
Abra cadabra!
[chiming]

1543
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,161
You asked for it.

1544
01:11:10,852 --> 01:11:13,510
[music resumes]

1545
01:11:22,519 --> 01:11:23,900
- [Blinkie] Sheldon
found his confidence,

1546
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,902
and his invention
actually worked!

1547
01:11:29,664 --> 01:11:31,701
- See, Sheldon, I
knew you could do it!

1548
01:11:31,701 --> 01:11:33,289
Come on, class.
- Best of all,

1549
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,567
he finally won the science fair.

- Thank you.
[all clapping]

1553
01:11:49,132 --> 01:11:50,892
- [Blinkie] As for me,

1554
01:11:50,892 --> 01:11:52,998
I found the ability
to stand up for myself

1555
01:11:52,998 --> 01:11:54,448
and my friends.

1556
01:11:56,242 --> 01:11:57,658
God gave us these gifts.

1557
01:11:58,762 --> 01:12:00,350
We just had to
believe in ourselves.

1558
01:12:02,387 --> 01:12:07,115
I promise you, if anything
like this ever happens again,

1559
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:09,773
the Halloween Heroes will
be there to save the day.

[upbeat rock music]

1561
01:13:23,053 --> 01:13:24,607
- Hey Mayor.

1562
01:13:24,607 --> 01:13:26,885
- I'm here to learn Taiwan Doe.

1563
01:13:26,885 --> 01:13:28,680
They say I need to
lose some weight.

1564
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,027
- Ah, well, class
is over tonight,

1565
01:13:31,027 --> 01:13:32,994
but tomorrow at 7:00.

1566
01:13:32,994 --> 01:13:34,927
- Okay, I'll come back.

1567
01:13:34,927 --> 01:13:37,861
- Excellent.
- Would you like some?

1568
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,702
How do you use these things?
