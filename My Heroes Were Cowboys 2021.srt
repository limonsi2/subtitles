<i>[Robin] </i>I grew up
with horses always around me.

39
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,773
<i>I was raised in a little country town</i>
<i>in Australia.</i>

40
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,321
<i>I wasn't small, but I would be called</i>
<i>the runt of the litter.</i>

41
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,826
<i>I didn't speak that well. I couldn't read.</i>

42
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,328
<i>I was a loner.</i>

43
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,998
<i>I was happy with a horse.</i>

44
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,169
<i>When you can't communicate</i>
<i>with other people,</i>

45
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,256
<i>you're ostracized a little bit.</i>

46
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,135
<i>That's why I was pushed</i>
<i>to my grandparents,</i>

47
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:25,598
<i>to try to change my life,</i>
<i>which it changed my life.</i>

48
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,231
<i>I looked up to my granddad,</i>
<i>and he had a stern voice.</i>

49
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:37,360
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>he was a highly decorated war hero,</i>

50
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,446
<i>and he'd been in the Light Horse Brigade</i>
<i>in Australia, you know.</i>

51
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,573
<i>And that's such a… a huge honor</i>

52
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,076
<i>to fight for your country on horseback.</i>

53
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,581
<i>But… I've never seen</i>

54
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,210
<i>love in my… granddad's eyes.</i>

55
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,172
<i>We always ate at the table together.</i>

56
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,717
<i>And then he'd look straight down</i>
<i>at his food,</i>

57
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,970
<i>and then he'd look up again</i>
<i>and just look straight through you.</i>

58
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,471
<i>That stare.</i>

59
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,350
<i>Just before he passed away in hospital,</i>

60
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,519
<i>and… and he'd still give me that look.</i>

61
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,107
<i>[announcer] </i>What did you think
of his efforts tonight?

62
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,151
<i>[Robin] That's always been</i>
<i>at the back of my mind,</i>

63
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,737
<i>you know, what my granddad</i>
<i>had said to me, you know?</i>

64
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,697
<i>"You'll amount to nothing."</i>

65
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,370
<i>My grandma was very soft-spoken.</i>

66
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,915
<i>When I was young, I would look at a book.</i>

67
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,668
<i>Instead of opening up</i>
<i>and going from the top,</i>

68
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,920
<i>I would start from the bottom,</i>
<i>and she said,</i>

69
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,089
<i>"Now start from this side here</i>

70
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,677
<i>and then follow it down</i>
<i>again and again and again."</i>

71
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:50,975
<i>And I think that's what's helped me</i>
<i>pass this on to my training.</i>

72
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,811
<i>You know,</i>
<i>it was that repetition of doing it.</i>

73
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,067
<i>She said, "Believe in what you are."</i>

74
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,653
<i>"And if you want to do it</i>
<i>through the horses, do it."</i>

75
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,241
<i>Just be very gentle with them,</i>

76
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,578
<i>and they will give back</i>
<i>a lot more love to you.</i>

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,088
<i>You know, I… I like a man</i>
<i>who watches things going around.</i>

78
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,465
<i>It means he'll make his mark someday.</i>

79
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,678
<i>[Robin] I would say I was about 10 or 11.</i>

80
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:33,810
<i>I went into this movie theater,</i>
<i>and… I was mesmerized.</i>

81
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,022
<i>You know, it was so large, the screen.</i>
<i>It's just wide,</i>

82
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,650
<i>and… the animals running towards you.</i>

83
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,444
<i>And the whole attire,</i>

84
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,531
<i>I mean, the hat, the boots, and the scarf.</i>

85
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,325
<i>Especially their mannerism</i>
<i>and how they got on a horse, you know?</i>

86
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,577
<i>It's just like, "Oh, wow."</i>

87
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,081
<i>I went back the next day.</i>

88
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:02,380
<i>Every time I watched a western</i>
<i>with a horse doing something unusual,</i>

89
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,342
<i>you know, I'm gonna copy that</i>
<i>and just see if I can do it better.</i>

90
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,056
<i>My first trick was the lay-down position,</i>

91
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,643
<i>because I wasn't that big</i>
<i>to… to get on the horse.</i>

92
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,854
<i>So I had to teach him to lay down</i>
<i>so I could get on him.</i>

93
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,605
<i>Good boy. Whoa.</i>

94
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,402
<i>I wanted to get into the picture business,</i>
<i>because I wanted to train horses.</i>

95
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:28,030
<i>But all the lots in Hollywood</i>
<i>got rid of all the horses,</i>

96
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,408
<i>because it was just after </i>Star Wars.

00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,909

102
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,596
<i>It's over.</i>

103
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,310
<i>There was still a desire to stay here</i>

104
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,729

<i>after pulling the chuck wagon in</i>
<i>on this little lot.</i>

<i>right there with me,</i>
