00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,093
you might not have heard of
six-on-six girls' basketball.

(gentle orchestral music)

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,023
It was first played in the early 1900s.

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,060
Rules were simple, three girls
on each side of the court,

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,193
guards on defense, forwards on offense.

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,033
Only the ball could cross half-court.

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,593
Two dribbles, then you
had to pass or shoot.

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,980
In small town Iowa,

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,893
six-on-six ruled the hearts
and minds of everyone.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,670

15
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,600

every thrill and every spill

(orchestral music continues)

19
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,190
- In this final game,

20
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,130
Schoulte scored 20 baskets in 29 attempts,

21
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,450
while the other two forwards hit 7 of 24,

22
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,833
to give Monona a 47% game
average from the field.

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,830
Speaking of records
established by Schoulte,

24
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,830
she holds the single game record
of 111 points in one game.

25
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,390
- [Narrator] Gyms overflowed,

26
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,663
with fans cheering on their girls.

(orchestral music continues)

28
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,020
I remember my grandmother

29
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,010
telling me about her Six-on-Six days.

30
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,260
Mom told me of her own glory days as well.

31
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,153
My daughter has heard their
stories and mine also.

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,143
Someday she'll share those
memories with her children.

33
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,430
- [Commentator] Ball is put into play

34

in the Mediapolis Bullettes court,

35
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,198
and Nancy Sheridan, number 13.

(spectators cheering)

37
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:29,880
Schmeiser, Sheridan, Mehaffey

38
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,880
Kathy Schmeiser, the forth
leading scorer of the tournament.

(orchestral music continues)

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,530
A sell out crowd of 15,000 is on hand

41
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,670
to watch the two top teams
in Iowa Girls Basketball,

42
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,570
battle it out for the State Championship

43
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,600
and what a battle it promises to be.

44
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,320
They're calling it the "Dream Game,"

45
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,530
because it brings together
not only the teams

46
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,100
ranked number one and number
two in the state all season,

47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,510
but also the two greatest
scorers in tournament history.

48

- [Narrator] Those old
gyms have fallen silent,

49
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,623
the doors are locked, lights turned off.

50
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,520
Years will pass

51
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Those of us who played we'll grow old

52
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,803
but we will never forget
when it was our game.

53
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,293
When it was our time.

54
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:32,245

00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:37,022
(traffic whooshing)

56
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,130
- You've seen that?

57
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,170
- Nope.

58
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,820
- Well, you can study up on your flight.

59
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,663
I want you there ASAP.

60
00:03:52,828 --> 00:03:56,020
- (chuckles) That's hilarious!

61
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,960
- Jimmy I'm serious.

62
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,910
There's something going on there.

63
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,060
I wanna know what is.

64
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,850
- Hey, if you believe in it, that's fine,

65
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,230
but don't waste my time.

66
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,559
I have plenty of work to do right here.

67
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,530
- (chuckles) I'm not wasting your time,

68
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,333
I'm giving you your next assignment.

69
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,720
Go talk to Edna in HR
she'll book you a flight.

70
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,546
- Ken I'm not going to the middle of Iowa

71
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,240
- You work here, right?

72
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,523
You're a reporter?

73
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,213
Here's the story,

74
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,430
go write it.
- This isn't a story,

75
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,570
this is a joke in the middle of nowhere.

76
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,500
Now I've paid my dues with
high-school-feel-good stories,

77
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,812
I don't have to do that crap anymore.

78
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:36,580
- (sighs) Jimmy, I feel like
it would do you some good

79
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,893
to write something positive for a change.

80
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,580
I feel like you've forgotten why people

81
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,900
love sports in the first place.

82
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,670
- I tell the stories that are happening.

83
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,220
- Aha, but not the good ones.

84
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,040
I'm tapping you because
you're a solid writer

85
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,683
and people will read it
if it comes from you.

86
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,457
I'd like you to continue your work here.

87
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:02,960
- Are you saying what I think you saying?

88
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,560
Because I could have three other jobs

89
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,290
by dinnertime tonight if I leave here.

90
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,373
- Maybe, maybe not.

91
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,550
- I'm sorry Ken, but this isn't right.

92
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,580
- It's the way it is kid.

93
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,653
My gut tells me this is worth our time.

94
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,763
Go do a good piece, make us both proud.

95
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,875
(soft instrumental music)

96
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:42,698

97
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:51,118

98
00:05:57,448 --> 00:06:00,281

100
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:35,816
(car engine roars)

101
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:46,932
(door opens and shuts)

102
00:06:48,015 --> 00:06:49,848
- I'll be right there.

103
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:55,050
You'll be needing a room I bet.

104
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,010
- I do, I need the best room you got,

105
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:57,968
though I'll be here a while-

106
00:06:57,968 --> 00:07:01,980
- Oh, well then you'll be needing
number 12, the green room.

107
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,430
- The green room?
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,550
Oh, it's nice, it's very nice.

109
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,220
- Good, good, it's quiet
I hope. I'll be working.

110
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,443
- Oh yeah, it's very quiet
except for the highway,

111
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:12,670
that's not quiet.

112
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,760
But other than that, you
could hear a pin drop.

113
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,590
No, except there are dogs that
come around here sometimes

114
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,440
and sometimes they bark
quite a bit actually.

115
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,819
But other than that, you
could hear a mouse scratches-

116
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,200
- You know what, it'll be fine, thank you.

117
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,033
I'll take it.

118
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,215
(keys clanking)

119
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:33,130
- All right, there you go. (chuckles)

120
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,833
- Thanks
- Enjoy the game.

121
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,933
- How did you know?

122
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:40,930
- It's that time of the year,
why else would you be here?

123
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:49,551
(traffic whooshes)

124
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:57,728
(door slides open)
(door shuts)

125
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:05,603
- (sighs) Lovely!

126
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:10,230
(gentle guitar music)

127
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:33,818
(soft instrumental music)

128
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:45,170
(door chimes)

129
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,790
- May I help you?

130
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,360
- Maybe, my name is Jimmy.

131
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,540
There's a girl's basketball
team here I'd like to see.

132
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,860
- Oh yeah, why is that?

133
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,623
- I'm a writer, do you read?

134
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,473
I mean, "Sports Today" I write for them.

135
00:09:01,634 --> 00:09:03,120
- I know who you are.

136
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,000
- So you've seen my work.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,660
- Not really.

138
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,960
- I see.

139
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,770
So where can I find these girls?

140
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,470
My editor would like me to
write something about them.

141
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,873
- Our girls in Sports Today?

142
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,300
- It's possible.

143
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,597
I'd like to see what they're doing.

144
00:09:20,597 --> 00:09:22,700
- It's 2:30 so I got the counter.

145
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,633
- Thank you, Mary.

146
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,700
Why?

147
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,860
- Why?

148
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,200
You mean why would
anyone care about a story

149
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
about girls basketball?

150
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,463
- No, I mean, why you?

151
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,460
- I'm a writer, I cover sports,

152
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,210
this is a sport story someone
thinks should be written.

153
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:44,578
- But not you.

154
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:46,090
- I don't know yet,

155
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,083
but if there is a story here,
I'm the one that'll find it.

156
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,613
- Good luck.

157
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:57,184
(footsteps pattering)

158
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:01,770
- The girls practice at the
Roundhouse at 4 o'clock.

159
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,275
- Thank you.

160
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:05,510
- Oh, what is a round house?

161
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,810
And where would I find it?

162
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,130
- Hey you honey?

163
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:16,280
- Dad, I made you something
to eat, it's in the oven.

164
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,596
- Good deal.

165
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:20,096
(hums a tune)

166
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,903
(sighs) You wanna watch?

167
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,380
that dumb show you like while we eat.

168
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,883
- Sorry dad, I got practice.

169
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:30,890
- I thought we talked about that.

170
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,183
- I'm not quitting dad.

171
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,416
- I want you to concentrate on grades.

172
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,600
- I know and my grades are great.

173
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,670
Call the school they'll tell you.

174
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,403
- You know I don't like it Laney.

175
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:43,151
- Well it will be over soon.

176
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,600
- Don't slam that door.

177
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,340
- [George] Well, Mike, we
appreciate the information,

178
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,627
we'll check with you later in the year,

179
00:10:57,627 --> 00:11:00,160
and to look for your ratings every week.

180
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,480
And until next week,

181
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,884
this is George Turner
reporting for the Iowa Girl.

182
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:08,384
(soft instrumental music)

183
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:42,263
(balls thumping)
(shoes squeaking)

184
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,740
- Is there something you need?
- No.

185
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,573
Actually, yeah.

186
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,837
You know what, I write for "Sports Today".

187
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,960
- Is that right?

188
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,634
Here in New Providence,
what are the odds of that?

189
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:57,330
- (chuckles) You have no idea.

190
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,123
- Hey, it's all right, Billy.

191
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:02,617
(whistle blows)

192
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:04,700
- Time to work, let's go.

193
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:08,310
(balls thumping)
(shoes squeaks)

194
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,133
Ashley, square up!

195
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,640
(balls thumping)
(shoes squeaks)

196
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,933
Gina no.

197
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,943
Julie, watch your left.

198
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,813
- [Player] Square up, square up, let's go.

199
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:26,230
(hands clap)

200
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,150
- You must've been pretty pissed.

201
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:33,043
- I don't follow.

202
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,543
- Mr. Voss,

203
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,340
you're almost as famous as
the people you write about,

204
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,680
why are you here covering
girls high school basketball?

205
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,940
- I told you,

206
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,743
someone believes this might
be a story worth sharing.

207
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,500
- You know, this team and these girls,

208
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,930
they might not mean all that
much to you, or your magazine,

209
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,863
but we don't really care.

210
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,343
What I do care about is this,

211
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,410
I will not allow you to come
here and trivialize our effort

212
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,110
or what this team means to this town.

213
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,493
- I understand your concern,

214
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,163
and you're probably right.

215
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,180
I don't see the story here.

216
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,400
I don't see what all the fuss
is about, but I'll be fair.

217
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,230
I can promise you that.

218
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,190
- The fuss. (scoffs)

219
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,240
- Meaning you still play Six-on-Six.

220
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,310
Not exactly cutting edge.

221
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,573
This game, you're teaching
your girls, it's dead.

222
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,363
- My girls are ballplayers.

223
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,613
- Maybe they should play
basketball instead of this.

224
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,883
No offense but,

225
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,083
who wants to watch this?

226
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,803
- Be here tomorrow night at
6:00, and you'll find out.

227
00:13:49,855 --> 00:13:52,688
(footsteps thump)

228
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:59,765
(cheerleaders chanting)
(lively music)

229
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:12,245
(spectators clapping)

230
00:14:19,673 --> 00:14:24,673
(cheerleaders chanting)
(spectators cheering)

231
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:38,765
(spectators whistles)

232
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:10,555
(cheering continues)

233
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:27,754
(buzzer)

234
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:33,452
(lively music continues)

235
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,716
(footsteps clomping)
- Congratulations!

236
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:49,549
- Thanks.

237
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,823
- The one girl.
- Laney Mitchell.

238
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,603
She's good huh.
- Yeah.

239
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,140
- So what'd you think of the game?

240
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,233
- It was interesting.

241
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,340
- You keep watching Mr. Voss,

242
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,350
you might come to really
appreciate what's happening here.

243
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,870
- You know, it's a big world,

244
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,750
A lot of big things happening.

245
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,890
I don't dislike what you have here,

246
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,380
I just don't know if
it's national newsworthy.

247
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,793
- You were in here
tonight, you saw the crowd.

248
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,473
- I did.

249
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,650
- Then maybe our game
isn't the problem, Mr. Voss

250
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:33,490
(footsteps thumping)

251
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:37,933
(highway whooshes)

252
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:50,893
(keyboard clicking)
(breathing heavily)

253
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:53,422
(blows air)

254
00:16:56,922 --> 00:17:00,755
- This is not working.
(bangs)

255
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:07,315
(footsteps pattering)
(highway whooshes)

256
00:17:12,236 --> 00:17:15,300
Hello!
(knocks)

257
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,683
Hi, the heater in my room is broken,

258
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:24,821
Hello!

259
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:33,299
What is this?
(paper clatters)

260
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,466
(footsteps pattering)

261
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:44,881
(telephone rings)

262
00:17:48,807 --> 00:17:51,790
(gasps) Damn it, it's cold!

263
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,220
Hello, what?
(breathing heavily)

264
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,190
No, the dog!

265
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,950
Why would I have seen the dog?

266
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,120
Hey, listen, there's
almost no heat in my room.

267
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,763
Yeah, so can I switch?

268
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,890
So, all the rooms are this cold,

269
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,283
but it's freezing in here.

270
00:18:09,494 --> 00:18:10,813
Hello!

271
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:12,293
Hello!

272
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:14,105
(shoes squeaking)
(balls thumping)

273
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:17,188
(players chattering)

274
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,193
- Henry Logan, Des Moines Register.

275
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,603
- Good newspaper.
- It is, thanks.

276
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,350
It's a great gig.

277
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,343
Who do you write for?
- Sports Today.

278
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,663
- Sports Today.

279
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,163
You're Jimmy Voss!

280
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,400
Man, I read that article
about Barry Bolden,

281
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,518
that man wants to kill you.

282
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:51,130
- I think he'd settled to beating me

283
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,940
within an inch of my life.

284
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,090
- Yeah. (chuckles)
- Square up, square up.

285
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,250
- Look at her, she's just crazy good.

286
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,700
It's like watching the "Cat."

287
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,150
- She works at it though,
she's not a natural,

288
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,223
- Lots to live up to,

289
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,153
her mom averaged 29 points a game.

290
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,913
- Her mom?

291
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,823
- Yeah, but she passed
away a few years ago.

292
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,620
Her grandma was good too.

293
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,983
She's from over in Clutier,

294
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,080
got a powerhouse of a team in the 1940s.

295
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,450
- The '40s?

296
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,550
You're kidding, right?

297
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,803
- I could be wrong,

298
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:33,297
but,

299
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,463
no, I'm right.

300
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:44,303
- You carry all that around with you?

301
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,850
- It settles a lot of arguments.

302
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,510
- Doesn't anyone dribble in this game?

303
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:56,280
- Yeah sort of, two dribbles
and you have to pass or shoot.

304
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,213
- Seriously?

305
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,600
- You have 3 on defense, 3 on offense,

306
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,793
guards and forwards.

307
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,460
- So if you're a guard,

308
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,140
you don't have to be able to shoot,

309
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,500
and you don't have to be able to dribble.

310
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
So what's the point in playing the game?

311
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:17,530
- My cousin Jane couldn't
dribble to save her life.

312
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,560
She couldn't hit a shot,

313
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,760
if she was standing
under a 4-foot basket,

314
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:26,200
but that kid, man, she
had the quickest hands,

315
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,230
so she played guard.

316
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,343
She led the team in steals all 4 years.

317
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:34,840
(balls thumping)
(shoes squeaking)

318
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,540
- Did you call somebody "The Cat?"

319
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,170
- Sure, yeah.

320
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,933
She was a local legend
around here years ago.

321
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,223
- She in that book?

322
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,763
- She is the book.

323
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:54,360
(soft instrumental music)

324
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,460
- Rita, I know he's there,

325
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,090
the man hasn't taken vacations since 1983,

326
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,050
now put him through please.

327
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,547
Thank you.

328
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,420
You got your food already?

329
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,820
We haven't even ordered yet.

330
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,590
- They know what I like.

331
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,653
- Well, what if you wanted
something different today?

332
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:18,403
- I never order anything different.

333
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,220
- Yeah, but what if today you did?

334
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,820
- People don't eat here
for the food, Jimmy.

335
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,473
They know who I am,
that's why I come here.

336
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,840
- Can I get you something?

337
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,580
- Yeah, I'll have two eggs over easy,

338
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,420
bacon fried to a crisp, very important,

339
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,893
wheat toast, not white,

340
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,693
coffee cream, no sugar
and no powder, real cream.

341
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,200
Ken, Ken, Ken, talk to me.

342
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,900
Hey look, I have tried,
but there is nothing here,

343
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,250
you gotta let me come home.

344
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,663
Hey, this is my career
we're talking about.

345
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,280
Don't don't lecture me, Ken.

346
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,470
Okay, hey, hey, it's me.

347
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,713
I'm not some stringer.

348
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,623
Hey, you're deliberately
killing my career!

349
00:22:14,427 --> 00:22:17,260
(bangs telephone)

350
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,103
Well, my career is going to be over.

351
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,480
- When God closes a
door, he opens a window.

352
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,313
- What?

353
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,383
- My grandma used to
say, it's inspirational.

354
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,773
- It's burglary.

355
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,793
- Hello young man!

356
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,550
- Sir.

357
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,770
- I hear you're here to put
our little town on the map,

358
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,133
we're thrilled to have you.

359
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,300
- Fingers crossed sir.

360
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,403
- If there's anything we can do at all?

361
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,940
- It is freezing in here.

362
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,430
I actually think it's warmer outside.

363
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,423
- I'm not dead yet.

364
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:08,750
- I'll be quick.

365
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,739
I heard about what happened at the cafe.

366
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:13,063
- Hmm, so why are you here?

367
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,720
- A while back,

368
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,480
the state was sued by a few girls

369
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,440
for the right to play
five-on-five basketball

370
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,723
instead of six-on-six, and they won.

371
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,530
This is the last season for
six-on-six after this, it's-

372
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,483
- Done, good!

373
00:23:29,953 --> 00:23:30,786
- (scoffs) Good.

374
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,073
Why good?

375
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,453
- Because now your girls
can play a real sport.

376
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,520
- You mean five-on-five?

377
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,110
Like the boys, for what?

378
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,030
A career in basketball.

379
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,810
There's no NBA for women.

380
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,920
They're not preparing for the big time.

381
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,360
There is no big time for
them, there's only this time,

382
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,730
and in the name of fairness and progress,

383
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,491
the state's about to take
it all away from them.

384
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:00,363
It is not right.

385
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,223
Sorry.
- It's okay.

386
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,610
I'm sorry too.

387
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,940
I wish I shared your enthusiasm

388
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,000
but I just don't get it.

389
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,810
I think it's ridiculous.
- Enthusiasm?

390
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,780
It's more than that.

391
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,170
- How can it be more than that?

392
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,930
- Because it is to us.

393
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,310
- Hey look, we both have problems, okay?

394
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,150
I got no place else to go.

395
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,870
If I go back to New York, I'll be-

396
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,130
- Irrelevant?

397
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,550
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

398
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,320
Welcome to our world, Jimmy.

399
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,240
- Oh, so that's why you're here.

400
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,260
You think that if I
write a positive story,

401
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,730
it'll save six-on-six.

402
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,510
- You can not save it, Jimmy.

403
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,343
- Then why?

404
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,610
- Because,

405
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,142
we are letting something very special die

406
00:24:50,142 --> 00:24:54,340
at the end of the season and
it deserves to be remembered.

407
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,300
- Why, why does this
matter so much to you?

408
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,520
This whole town?

409
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,713
I just don't get it.

410
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,790
- Our grandmas played this game,

411
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,780
our mothers played this game.

412
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,240
We don't have Broadway, or
the Empire State building,

413
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,503
or the Yankees.

414
00:25:14,484 --> 00:25:16,960
In this town, we have each other,

415
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,793
we have the community,

416
00:25:17,793 --> 00:25:20,220
and at the very heart of it all,

417
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,003
those girls playing this
game is the foundation.

418
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:28,180
- You know, there's nothing
I can do to save it.

419
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,460
- I am not asking you to save it.

420
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,460
Help us preserve the
legacy and tell our story.

421
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,380
Please stay.

422
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,933
- Can't stay here or I'll freeze to death.

423
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:48,807
- (sighs) What would if I could
offer you something better?

424
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,390
Hey, the apartment above the garage,

425
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,770
it's still workable, right?

426
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:04,000
- Yeah, yes, comes with a cost.

427
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,610
- I have an expense account.

428
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,380
- Not money.

429
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,620
I'm moving from the farm, the spring,

430
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,570
and I have arthritis.

431
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,770
I could use some help with moving boxes

432
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,083
and furniture every once in a while.

433
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,140
I won't charge you rent
or utilities, sound good.

434
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,173
- Right, as long as its got heat I'm in.

435
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,640
- Not exactly a loft in
Greenwich village, is it?

436
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,060
- Oh, it's perfect,
actually, thank you.

437
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,023
- Oh, Teresa is the one to thank.

438
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,200
So, haul your stuff in and
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

439
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,070
- Really, really thank you.

440
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,250
I appreciate it.
(Patricia chuckles)

441
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,350
- Don't thank me,

442
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,827
till you've seen all the
boxes I have for you to move.

443
00:26:46,827 --> 00:26:48,930
- I think maybe she likes me.

444
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:49,763
- Maybe.

445
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,070
Fair warning though,

446
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,333
She neuters the dogs she likes.

447
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,023
- I'll keep my legs crossed.

448
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,350
- You coming to the game tomorrow night?

449
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,950
- What else is there to do here?

450
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:08,303
- Well, I hope you like it,

451
00:27:10,225 --> 00:27:12,058
the apartment, I mean.

452
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:17,274
(footsteps thumping)

453
00:27:17,274 --> 00:27:20,357
(upbeat funky music)

454
00:27:22,158 --> 00:27:25,325
(spectators cheering)

455
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:54,048
(music intensifies)

456
00:28:01,858 --> 00:28:04,941
(players chattering)

457
00:28:15,008 --> 00:28:20,008
(spectators cheering)
(shoes squeaking)

458
00:28:35,217 --> 00:28:38,467
(cheering intensifies)

459
00:28:51,407 --> 00:28:53,473
(whistles)

460
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:55,532
- I heard you left the hotel.

461
00:28:55,532 --> 00:28:56,365
- I did.

462
00:29:03,684 --> 00:29:07,017
(spectators chattering)

463
00:29:17,568 --> 00:29:18,980
All right, what am I missing here, huh?

464
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,360
This is a regular season game,

465
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,430
these people are cheering like

466
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,603
the NBA Championships is on the line.

467
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:28,239
- They're not here for the game, Jimmy.

468
00:29:30,448 --> 00:29:32,639
- New Providence, lets
go, one, two, three,

469
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:35,639
- New Providence!
- Let's go ladies.

470
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:40,494
(buzzing)

471
00:29:40,494 --> 00:29:44,186
(spectators cheering)

472
00:29:44,186 --> 00:29:45,983
- It's like the Cat has come back.

473
00:29:47,015 --> 00:29:49,932
(door clicks open)

474
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,510
- It's almost 11:00 PM,
where have you been?

475
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,760
- We won the game, so afterwards,

476
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,530
a few of the girls and I went to the cafe

477
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:03,560
to get some burgers and
shakes to celebrate.

478
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,650
- You didn't call me.

479
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,840
I've been worried sick
all night. (grumbles)

480
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,513
- I didn't want to wake you up.

481
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,500
- This is exactly the kind
of thing I knew would happen.

482
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:19,060
You're not playing
anymore, you're grounded.

483
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,260
- What do you mean?

484
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,320
I didn't do anything wrong.

485
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,783
- You didn't come home!

486
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,930
Scared me half to death,

487
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,112
rolling here after being God-knows-where,

488
00:30:28,112 --> 00:30:29,780
doing God-knows-what.

489
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,173
- I just told you
exactly what I was doing.

490
00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:34,710
- Don't you sas me Laney
something (indistinct).

491
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,530
You tell that coach, tomorrow,
you're done, that's it!

492
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,480
- You want to ground me, fine!

493
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,210
- Laney, I forbid you to
take a step into the gym,

494
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,611
don't you dare test me!

495
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,861
(whimpers)

496
00:30:51,411 --> 00:30:53,578
(mumbles)

497
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:57,168
(door closes)

498
00:30:57,168 --> 00:30:59,751
(gentle music)

499
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,459
(footsteps thumping)

500
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:06,700
- Here you go.

501
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,460
- I didn't order this.

502
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,510
- Coffee cream, no sugar, no
powder, real cream, right?

503
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,940
- Right.
- Food is coming.

504
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,640
- I didn't order any food.

505
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,510
- There he is.

506
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,670
- Good morning, sir.

507
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,240
- How's the story coming along?

508
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,050
I can't wait to read it.

509
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,880
- Slow but steady.

510
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,970
- Now, if you need me for
pictures with the girls,

511
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,650
please let me know.

512
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:29,843
- Of course, sir.

513
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,773
- I got to get something off my chest,

514
00:31:49,349 --> 00:31:51,280
The way you were acting last night

515
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,163
it upset me, but what hurt me,

516
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,750
was thinking I can't trust you.

517
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,303
- I didn't lie.
- Don't interrupt me.

518
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,290
I believe you.

519
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,593
I trust you, you're a good girl.

520
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:11,800
Your mom saw to that,

521
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,633
but,

522
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:17,510
you're done playing ball.

523
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,860
- Dad!
- Stop.

524
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,360
Now, I'll let you play one last game

525
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,640
but you tell that coach,
you're done after that.

526
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,223
Laney, Laney!

527
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:38,703
(balls thumping)
(shoes squeaking)

528
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:40,524
(background chatter)

529
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:41,551
- Woo-hoo!

530
00:32:41,551 --> 00:32:45,430
(balls thumping)
(shoes squeaking)

531
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,050
- That's Millie Hamilton,

532
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,323
she led the team in scoring scoring in 1971.

533
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:56,570
And Joy Baker, she set a
school record for steals, 1983.

534
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,763
- It's crazy isn't it?

535
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,023
- Christina Lang, it's like
my book has come to life.

536
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,063
- Just enjoy the moment Henry.

537
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:13,896
(balls thumping)
(shoes squeaking)

538
00:33:13,896 --> 00:33:16,646
(balls thumping)

539
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,460
- Nice!
- Thanks.

540
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,840
- So the other night,

541
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,370
Henry told me people don't
come here for the game?

542
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,010
- Yeah, so.

543
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,110
- So why do they come?

544
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,093
- They come to support the girls Jimmy.

545
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:34,823
- No, no, that's not it.

546
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,650
I've been to high school
games over the years,

547
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,290
they're definitely not here for the girls,

548
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,490
and apparently they're not
here for the game either.

549
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,490
So why do they come?

550
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,008
- They come because it's New Providence.

551
00:33:48,008 --> 00:33:50,210
They come because it's home.

552
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,910
They believe in it and
it's the right thing to do.

553
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:53,960
- They believe in it?

554
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:56,373
It makes no sense.

555
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,144
- Why are you here,
there's no practice today?

556
00:34:01,144 --> 00:34:03,307
- I'd like to interview the "Cat."

557
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,200
- The Cat's gone.

558
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,660
- Dead?

559
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,770
- No, not dead, just not here anymore.

560
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,118
- What does that mean?

561
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:15,220
- Just, look it's just not an option,

562
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,133
okay, let it go.

563
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:25,819
(suspenseful music)
(metal clinking)

564
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:28,867
- Jimmy!
- Tell me about "The Cat."

565
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:36,110
- You, uh live here alone?
(soft instrumental music)

566
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,660
- My mother is in the basement.

567
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,653
I'm not Norman Bates,

568
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,640
the basements where bedroom is,

569
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,990
I have an apartment in Des Moines

570
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,423
but I live back home
during basketball season.

571
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,090
- You spend the whole winter here?

572
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,910
- Where else should I be?

573
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,883
The Cat, here.

574
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,530
Cat Holiday scores 103

575
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,977
as New Providence crushes Jules, 103?.

576
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,440
- She broke 100, four times.

577
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,050
- My God, didn't the other team show up?

578
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,563
- The other team was a state
champion the year before,

579
00:35:17,712 --> 00:35:20,090
that was her first 100-point game.

580
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,680
The other three were her senior year.

581
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,613
Rumor had it, she tried out
for an NBA team that summer.

582
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,653
- Rumor had it?

583
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,580
- Well, Cat didn't brag,

584
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,693
she didn't have to.

585
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,060
Apparently she disappeared

586
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,520
for a couple of months after graduation,

587
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,263
and then suddenly she was back.

588
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,903
Never told anybody where she went.

589
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:48,050
- Henry I'm impressed

590
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,060
and a little disturbed by
your detailed book here,

591
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,040
but I don't believe that.

592
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,520
- Like I said, it's a rumor.

593
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,130
Believe what you want.

594
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,750
- Can I talk to her?

595
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,300
- Who, the Cat?

596
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,510
- Yeah, Cat Holiday.

597
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:05,083
She leave New Providence
after high school or stay?

598
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,773
- Listen, you should probably go.

599
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,493
- Did I say something wrong?
- No.

600
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,750
- Why is everyone avoiding my question?

601
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,010
- I answered your question.

602
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,800
- Really?
- Really!

603
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,370
She got married, left town,

604
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,940
just like every other
kid in New Providence.

605
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,302
- Teresa didn't.
- Teresa is different.

606
00:36:29,302 --> 00:36:30,213
- How so?

607
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,410
- You should probably go.

608
00:36:37,022 --> 00:36:38,236
- Now wait a minute,

609
00:36:38,236 --> 00:36:40,420
what's with the secrets, huh?

610
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,690
Where's Cat?

611
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,790
What's up with Teresa?

612
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,313
- I don't know, man,

613
00:36:45,313 --> 00:36:47,523
you're the reporter, figure it out.

614
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,063
- You're a very bad liar, Henry.

615
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,820
(engine cranking)
(playful instrumental music)

616
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:21,470
(door shuts)
(footsteps approaching)

617
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,760
- Morning.

618
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,763
- Yeah, it's 6:30.

619
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,450
- Got a late start this morning.

620
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,930
- Late start, that's good.

621
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,510
- Junior, don't leave until
I give you that check.

622
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,180
- It'll be an hour before I go to town,

623
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,590
I'm gonna need some of that
coffee of yours in the meantime.

624
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,883
- You're late, you
don't deserve my coffee.

625
00:37:40,571 --> 00:37:42,793
- (chuckles) Best cup of coffee in Iowa.

626
00:37:45,154 --> 00:37:50,154
So, you are probably that writer
guy that I've heard about.

627
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:55,020
- Jimmy Voss.
(metal clanks)

628
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,183
- Sports Today?

629
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,363
- A fan?

630
00:37:58,363 --> 00:38:01,373
- Mm-mm, I hate sports,
it's a waste of time.

631
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,170
- Sorry you feel that way.

632
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,040
- I know what you write about too.

633
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,730
Every story has got an ugly side

634
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,600
and you find that every time, don't you?

635
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,633
- Is that what I do?

636
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,300
- Isn't it.

637
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,121
- Neither of you deserve this.

638
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:18,087
- Thank you.
(Junior chuckles)

639
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,822
(Junior sniffles)

640
00:38:19,822 --> 00:38:23,800
(slurps coffee) Mm,
thank God, that is good.

641
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,362
- I told you. (clears throat)

642
00:38:25,362 --> 00:38:26,530
- What do you put in it?

643
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,810
- Well as they say, if I told
you, I'd have to kill you.

644
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,300
- Well, you have to stand
in line on that one.

645
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,730
- (chuckles) Oh, Laney called,

646
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,070
she said you don't need to pick her up,

647
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,150
she's got a ride to work.
- Good deal.

648
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,163
- Laney, Laney Mitchell?

649
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,530
- She's my daughter.

650
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,870
- Well, I'm gonna go inside,

651
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,417
you guys can stand around if you want,

652
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:45,210
but you only get one cup of coffee

653
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,110
until you actually get something done.

654
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,670
- She's a peach, isn't she?

655
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
- You work for her?

656
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,603
- No, I worked for her
husband for many years.

657
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,660
Now that he's passed, she
will be selling place.

658
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,675
- To you?

659
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:06,363
- No, (chuckles) price is not
in my league, I don't imagine.

660
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,820
- You must be pretty proud
of your daughter, sir?

661
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,653
- I am,

662
00:39:13,595 --> 00:39:16,870
but not for the reasons you think.

663
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:21,380
- No, she's kind of a local
celebrity around here,

664
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,580
isn't she?
- You see that's,

665
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,400
a little bit like saying
you deserve an award,

666
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,735
because your car has the most rust on it.

667
00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:31,235
(metal snaps)

668
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:35,910
(metal clanks)

669
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:40,467
Who cares, this town
don't deserve my daughter.

670
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:42,093
Ain't done nothing for her.

671
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,810
- She seems to like it.

672
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,523
- Some people don't know
what's best for them.

673
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,123
They need guidance,

674
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,750
maybe I should work on that.

675
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,000
- Have a good morning.

676
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,087
- Well, you too, Mr. Bigshot.

677
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:07,813
(machine humming)
- Laney?

678
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,130
- Do you need help finding something?

679
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,480
- No, I was looking for you.

680
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,063
Do you have a minute to talk?
- About what?

681
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,440
- Basketball, of course.

682
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,583
- How important is it to you?

683
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,161
- Well, I have fun.

684
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:27,070
- (chuckles) I bet you do.

685
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,360
- Tell me what's it like,

686
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,030
when you walk out on that court

687
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,763
and you know no one can stop you.

688
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,150
- I don't know, I guess, I feel lucky.

689
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,813
- Aw, but that's not luck,

690
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,230
you work very hard, don't you?

691
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,073
- Well, yeah.

692
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,620
- You know when this season's over,

693
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,420
this game for the girls is over too,

694
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,350
how does that make you feel?

695
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:54,427
- Well, how would you feel
if that happened to you?

696
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:57,840
- I don't think I'd like it very much.

697
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,130
- Why not?

698
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,210
- Okay, now I'm the one
asking the questions,

699
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,040
not the other way around.

700
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,530
- I told you, I feel lucky.

701
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,620
People are happy when I play
and that makes me proud,

702
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,350
but I'm also sad.

703
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:13,510
I'm sad for this town,
I'm sad for Coach Teresa,

704
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,430
but I'm mostly sad for the girls

705
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,900
who will never get their chance to play.

706
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,340
They'll never know what it's like

707
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,760
to be a part of something so important.

708
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,853
- One more question,

709
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,790
you think you'll make it to regionals?

710
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,733
- Does it really matter?

711
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,250
I got to get back to work.

712
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,580
- Sorry for making you do this tonight,

713
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,010
I like to get things done.
(gentle music)

714
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,070
Watch where you're going.

715
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,560
- All I see is box.

716
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,843
- You're doing fine.

717
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:49,215
You have landed, set them down, relax.

718
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,020
- (exhales) Geez, what's in this?

719
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,800
- I have no idea.

720
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,148
I forgot to label the first
20 boxes or something.

721
00:41:56,148 --> 00:42:00,700
- All right, well...

722
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,783
- Follow me then.

723
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,473
- Patricia?

724
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,163
Hello!

725
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,610
- My husband's brother, Frank moved

726
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,100
these other boxes for me.

727
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,400
Come to think of it,

728
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,180
I haven't seen Frank for quite a while.

729
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,210
Good Lord, I hope he's not
buried in here somewhere.

730
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:21,070
- How long has your husband been gone?

731
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:21,903
- Two years.

732
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,523
- Sorry for your loss.

733
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,330
You're moving into town?

734
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:32,300
- No, I think maybe I wanna
see more of the world.

735
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,193
- California?
- Des Moines.

736
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,240
Okay, next up is the long
dresser in my bedroom.

737
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,890
Do you have gloves, that's heavy.

738
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,817
- Some driving gloves in my
room, I will go get them.

739
00:42:44,817 --> 00:42:46,100
- No, no, you go on up to the bedroom,

740
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,630
and check out that beast

741
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,880
and I'll go get your gloves.

742
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,240
Don't try and lift it by yourself,

743
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,073
that's what killed my husband.

744
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:53,656
I'll be right back.

745
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:58,263
(soft orchestral music)

746
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:23,206
(papers clattering)

747
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:30,343
- (sighs) She wasn't joking, Roy.

748
00:43:33,696 --> 00:43:35,850
- Is this journalism to you?

749
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,510
- That is a private document.

750
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,700
- Oh, until you publish it in Sports Today

751
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,950
for the whole world to read.

752
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,780
- That's a first draft,
I write multiple drafts.

753
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,220
- Oh, are they all this
entertaining as this.

754
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,503
- I was sent here to write a story.

755
00:43:48,503 --> 00:43:51,340
- This is not a story.

756
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,040
This is personal, isn't it?

757
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,630
Why do you hate us so much?

758
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,830
- I don't hate you.

759
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,844
- Get out!
- What?

760
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,373
- I don't wanna see you,
get out of my house, out!

761
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:10,056
(spectators cheering)

762
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:15,169
(door slams)

763
00:44:16,711 --> 00:44:20,760
- When you look at your opponent tonight,

764
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,890
do you think they're better than you?

765
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:25,840
This is a winnable game, ladies,

766
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,533
come on let's wake up!

767
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:29,300
- I can't do it by myself.

768
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,400
- Shut up Laney.

769
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,343
- Stop, you will not turn on each other!

770
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:35,483
Laney, look around you,

771
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:39,103
Okay, everyone is tired,

772
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:42,720
we all work together on this team,

773
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,620
do you understand?

774
00:44:45,053 --> 00:44:48,220
(spectators cheering)

775
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:53,181
(cheerful music)

776
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,340
- Who's the girl on Laney?

777
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,670
- That's Dana Fredericks,

778
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,141
she's a great gaurd but
fouls out all the time.

779
00:45:08,141 --> 00:45:10,695
(referee whistles)

780
00:45:10,695 --> 00:45:13,778
(cheering continues)

781
00:45:37,727 --> 00:45:39,938
- She's killing her out there.

782
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:42,688
- Thats what they do to her
every time.

783
00:45:43,872 --> 00:45:45,223
- Move the ball, move the ball.

784
00:45:48,394 --> 00:45:51,477
(cheering continues)

785
00:46:02,715 --> 00:46:05,632
(referee whistles)

786
00:46:12,762 --> 00:46:16,179
- Hey call it both ways.

787
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:24,414
(body thumps)
(spectators jeer)

788
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:25,514
(referee whistles)

789
00:46:25,514 --> 00:46:27,070
- Girls to your bench.

790
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:27,903
Coach?

791
00:46:30,113 --> 00:46:33,613
(soft instrumental music)

792
00:46:38,753 --> 00:46:41,920
(spectators clapping)

793
00:46:50,899 --> 00:46:52,816
- Sorry about that.

794
00:46:56,367 --> 00:46:57,812
(footsteps clomping)

795
00:46:57,812 --> 00:47:02,600
- You see, that's why I don't
want you playing this dumb game.

796
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,433
- I'm fine.

797
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:11,290
- Better hope this ain't serious.

798
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,963
- That's it, we're done.

799
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:26,143
I just wanted to get them
to regionals one more time.

800
00:47:29,954 --> 00:47:32,303
- I'm sorry. (scoffs)

801
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,323
- I played so many games in this building.

802
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,313
Look at it,

803
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,613
it's perfect.

804
00:47:47,286 --> 00:47:49,453
It shouldn't end this way.

805
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:52,383
- Teresa,

806
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,130
I know how much it hurts

807
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:57,480
to lose something you love,

808
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:03,080
but this is just a game,

809
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,293
had to end sometime.

810
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,423
- My God Jimmy!

811
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,500
You don't get it at all, do you?

812
00:48:12,691 --> 00:48:15,774
(footsteps clomping)

813
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:27,430
(soft instrumental music)

814
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:39,290
(ball thumping)

815
00:48:40,606 --> 00:48:43,768
(door knocks)

816
00:48:43,768 --> 00:48:47,185
- Jimmy Voss, you are a hard man to find.

817
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,480
- What can I do for you, Mr. Frazier?

818
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,040
- I represent GSN,
Global Sports Network.

819
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,410
We are the fastest growing
sports broadcast network today.

820
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,050
You know our rival, everybody does.

821
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:02,930
The difference between us and them,

822
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:04,870
is we're a little more edgy,

823
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,817
we are not your father's sports network.

824
00:49:07,817 --> 00:49:10,040
But we wanna get in the trenches,

825
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,343
we want the dirt.

826
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:14,223
Jimmy, we want you.

827
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,320
- I don't understand,

828
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,023
I'm a writer, print.

829
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:21,710
- Physical copies of newspapers, books,

830
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,130
and magazines have been
on the decline for years.

831
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,280
Nobody wants to read,

832
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,830
but it doesn't mean they
don't want the story,

833
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,210
and we love your work.

834
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:31,820
We want to nurture it.

835
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,970
We feel what happened to you

836
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,140
from your current employer was unjust.

837
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,710
We will always stand beside you, Jimmy,

838
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,363
but, we're thinking bigger picture.

839
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:45,590
- Again, I'm just a little
confused, I'm a writer.

840
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:47,283
You're a cable network?

841
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:49,253
- Yeah, silly me.

842
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:54,063
I have not yet fully
explained my proposition.

843
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,510
In addition to your articles,

844
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:59,010
we want you to be on the show.

845
00:50:00,462 --> 00:50:02,360
- You want to interview me?

846
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,520
- Not exactly, no.

847
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,007
We want you to host your own show.

848
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:09,640
"The Real Deal With Jimmy Voss,"

849
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,740
has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

850
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,443
- I'd have my own show?
- Yeah.

851
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,350
- I don't know anything about television.

852
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,810
- No, that's my job, you get the stories.

853
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:20,160
I'll take care of the rest.

854
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,780
- I don't know what to say.

855
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,320
- Before you answer it, know this,

856
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,310
the network is prepared to triple
your current salary.

857
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:34,140
If you're renewed, which
we both know you will be,

858
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,160
we'll negotiate,

859
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,563
but I promise you it will not be hard.

860
00:50:39,438 --> 00:50:41,250
- Why me?

861
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,510
- Because Jimmy, you have something

862
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,740
that's really hard to
find in this business,

863
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,870
a nose for the news.

864
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:51,603
We want the dirt, your current
employer is afraid to expose.

865
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:58,793
- Here, call me when you
decide, but make it quick.

866
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,330
We'd like to get you back
into civilization soon.

867
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:04,360
It's too cold here.

868
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,303
- Where's the job?

869
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,850
- Los Angeles.

870
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,923
- Oh, it's beautiful
- You'll love it.

871
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,710
- I have a story to finish here.

872
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,300
I need a little time.

873
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,213
- Do me a favor,

874
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:19,643
there's a ticket waiting

875
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:22,810
for you at the airport
in the morning, 6:00 AM,

876
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:23,727
two days from now.

877
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:27,833
This is your shot, don't miss it.

878
00:51:31,486 --> 00:51:34,986
(soft instrumental music)

879
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:47,850
- This is a closed practice,

880
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:48,840
you should know that by now.

881
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,130
- Teresa?

882
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:51,550
- Do you not hear what I'm saying?

883
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,951
- Teresa, please?
- Come on.

884
00:51:53,951 --> 00:51:55,666
Bill, get back there.

885
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:57,370
Get out of here now!

886
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,880
We've got lot of work to do.

887
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,630
- I know, I'm sorry for before,

888
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,910
but I just need a minute of your time.

889
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:05,125
- Now, girls get to work, let's go.

890
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:07,610
(Bill claps)

891
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:08,930
Spit it out, what do you want?

892
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,200
- Where's Laney?

893
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,950
- My guess home so what?

894
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,130
- So you win this next game,

895
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,110
you move on to regionals, right?

896
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:16,430
- Don't rub it in Jimmy.

897
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,210
- I'm not rubbing it in.

898
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:20,870
Laney is faking her
injury to appease her father.

899
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,387
- You are something else, get out of here!

900
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:24,370
- Are you listening to me?

901
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:26,420
I saw her this morning at your mom's farm,

902
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,393
she was practicing her leg is fine.

903
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:32,023
- (scoffs) Why would she make that up?

904
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,970
- 'Cause her father is mean drunk,

905
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:36,453
trust me, I know the signs.

906
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,210
- Well, even if what
you're saying is true,

907
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:43,788
she's not gonna come back.

908
00:52:43,788 --> 00:52:46,300
- I might be able to convince her,

909
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,710
keep coaching the girls,
I'll see what I can do.

910
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,403
- Hey,

911
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,090
come here!

912
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:55,014
Why are you doing this?

913
00:52:55,014 --> 00:52:56,520
Why now?

914
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,638
- It's like everyone around
here keeps telling me,

915
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:00,923
it's the right thing to do.

916
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,763
- Thanks baby.
(soft instrumental music)

917
00:53:14,883 --> 00:53:17,300
(door knock)

918
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:21,093
- Come in.
(door shuts)

919
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,610
- Good evening, sir.

920
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:32,280
- What do you need?

921
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,270
- Sports Today has
authorized a small payment

922
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,870
in exchange for your
daughter's exclusive interview.

923
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:41,867
- How much?

924
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:43,073
- $500.

925
00:53:48,005 --> 00:53:51,530
- Oh, well, we'll give you 10 minutes.

926
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:54,823
- Not you, just her, that's the deal.

927
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:15,390
- I'm gonna hit the showers

928
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,440
and wash the day off.

929
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:21,003
You, be gone when I'm done.

930
00:54:23,148 --> 00:54:24,917
Put the money on the table.

931
00:54:38,936 --> 00:54:41,020
- I don't really have anything to say.

932
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,770
- That's okay, I'll do the talking.

933
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:46,820
I know what's going on here
and I know why you're doing it.

934
00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:49,360
- What do you mean?

935
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,870
- Your leg is fine.

936
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:53,853
I saw you practicing this
morning and Patricia's farm.

937
00:54:55,595 --> 00:54:58,800
I'm not trying to embarrass
you, or upset you,

938
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,370
but I hope, that I can convince you

939
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:04,280
to do something that I
never had the courage to do,

940
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,810
and I've regretted it my whole life.

941
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:07,360
- I'm not going to play.

942
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,070
- Laney, if you don't play,

943
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:12,020
you're never going to forgive yourself.

944
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,300
- Why don't you shut up?

945
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:17,460
You don't know me,

946
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,290
you come here and start
messing with people,

947
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:21,300
and then you'll go back
to where you came from.

948
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,300
I can't just leave!

949
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,303
- I know why you're doing this, your dad.

950
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,663
- He needs me.

951
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,260
- Your team needs you,

952
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,260
your coach needs you,

953
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,257
your town, they need you.

954
00:55:34,257 --> 00:55:36,160
And your dad,

955
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,780
he just wants to keep you down with him.

956
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,470
But you're special,

957
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,930
and he knows that and he's
just scared to lose you.

958
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:45,960
- I don't care, that's my dad,

959
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,570
and he needs me, I have to take care of him.

960
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,200
- Listen to me, Laney.

961
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,640
I hate to say this, but
you have a real shot,

962
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,830
you can get a scholarship,
go to school somewhere,

963
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,827
and you might be able to get out of here.

964
00:55:57,827 --> 00:56:00,380
Now he's made his choice,

965
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:02,742
you need to make yours.
- I have.

966
00:56:02,742 --> 00:56:04,334
- What's going on in here?

967
00:56:04,334 --> 00:56:06,490
- He's leaving dad,

968
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:08,660
sit down, I'll fix you something to eat.

969
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:12,803
- Wait, why don't you go
to your room for a minute?

970
00:56:24,834 --> 00:56:26,600
(chuckles)

971
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,400
- You think what you're
doing to her is fair?

972
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,723
- Those from around
here, fair is in August,

973
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,290
life isn't fair.

974
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:38,790
Life down right hard, no time for games,

975
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:41,550
especially ones that
don't get you anywhere.

976
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:44,200
- I'm going to tell everyone
what you've done to her.

977
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,900
- Well, yeah,

978
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,300
I may not be the most liked man

979
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,350
in New Providence, but I can sleep easy,

980
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:54,670
knowing they'll trust me more

981
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,081
than an arrogant "Big-city" has been.

982
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,680
I want you to get out of my house.

983
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,580
- You know what, you're right,

984
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,290
that's exactly what I am.

985
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:03,740
I'm not much good to anybody,

986
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,160
but I'm begging you, sir, to let her play.

987
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,490
She deserves a chance
to see what she can do.

988
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:11,993
- You have no right!

989
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:14,783
And no business here.

990
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:21,083
You can get along,
before we have a problem.

991
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:35,116
- What happened?

992
00:57:35,116 --> 00:57:37,116
- I went and talked to Junior and Laney.

993
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,760
- How'd it go?

994
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,593
- Not good.

995
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,053
- I'm sorry.

996
00:57:44,573 --> 00:57:45,453
- It's okay.

997
00:57:49,761 --> 00:57:51,161
- I do have some other news.

998
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:53,883
- What's that?

999
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,230
- I got a job offer

1000
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,433
in Los Angeles,

1001
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,910
I leave tomorrow morning.

1002
00:58:03,928 --> 00:58:06,774
- So you'll miss the game.

1003
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:07,774
- Afraid so.

1004
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,610
- I've got kinda used you being

1005
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,807
in bleachers the last few weeks.

1006
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:18,513
- Maybe I'll come visit sometime.

1007
00:58:20,348 --> 00:58:21,498
- I won't bet on it.

1008
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:24,217
- You never know.

1009
00:58:28,273 --> 00:58:33,273
(ball thumps)
(soft instrumental music)

1010
00:58:40,194 --> 00:58:42,861
(bucket clanks)

1011
00:58:46,713 --> 00:58:49,380
(bucket clanks)

1012
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,623
- I need a beast of burden.

1013
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,133
- Would an ass do?

1014
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:05,933
- Nicely.

1015
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,353
- I hear you're leaving us.

1016
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:11,743
- I'm afraid so.

1017
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,390
Don't worry about my article though,

1018
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:16,860
I won't be turning it in.

1019
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,113
- Sorry, I yelled at you.

1020
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,593
Sorry. I hurt your feelings.

1021
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:23,060
- When Roy built this house,

1022
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,480
I told him I wanted a closet
I could walk around in.

1023
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,210
Unfortunately, the only way
I can walk around that closet

1024
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,950
is if I took all the clothes out of it.

1025
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:32,750
(both chuckle)
- At least he tried.

1026
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:36,540
- He was very good to me, very good.

1027
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,663
- I'm sure he was.

1028
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,460
- You want the rest of
the boxes out there,

1029
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,450
or you have more packing to do?

1030
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,520
- No, since you're leaving,

1031
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,150
if you can get as many of
these as you can downstairs,

1032
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:50,000
and then I'll see.

1033
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:50,833
- You got it!

1034
00:59:59,307 --> 01:00:02,807
(soft instrumental music)

1035
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:08,682
(paper clatter)

1036
01:00:28,951 --> 01:00:31,784
(music continues)

1037
01:00:42,207 --> 01:00:43,957
- What are you doing?

1038
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:48,170
- You're Cat Holiday?
(door shuts)

1039
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:51,280
- That is personal to
me, you had no right.

1040
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,880
- They say you're a legend.

1041
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,040
- I'm an old widow.

1042
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:57,080
- Why does everyone keep
your secret for you?

1043
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,580
- Because they're nice people,

1044
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,400
they respect my wishes.

1045
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,110
- What wishes?

1046
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:03,230
When did you become "The Cat?"

1047
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:04,830
- Oh, who cares?

1048
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,290
- I care,

1049
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:08,347
please tell me when did it happen?

1050
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:10,132
- Argh!

1051
01:01:12,029 --> 01:01:15,260
(breathes heavily)

1052
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:17,053
- I was tall for my age.

1053
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:18,993
I loved playing basketball.

1054
01:01:18,993 --> 01:01:22,640
But I wanted to play defense, but-

1055
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,540
- But the coaches wanted you to score?

1056
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:27,523
- and I worked.

1057
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,010
They were depending on me to score,

1058
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:34,893
so I made sure no one was
going to score more than me.

1059
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:38,323
At the hoops night and day,

1060
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:43,460
at the gym, driveway
everywhere, always shooting.

1061
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,293
Anyway,

1062
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:48,170
a writer who was covering the game

1063
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:51,583
for another little town,
wrote that I moved like a cat,

1064
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,613
word got around.

1065
01:01:54,447 --> 01:01:56,347
- "The Cat" was born.

1066
01:01:56,347 --> 01:01:57,463
- "The Cat" was born.

1067
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,400
- You meant a lot to these people.

1068
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,650
- Basketball meant a lot to me.

1069
01:02:06,506 --> 01:02:09,100
- The more played it, the more I loved it.

1070
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,593
And I would hit a shot,

1071
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:14,173
The whole of the gym would just erupt,

1072
01:02:14,173 --> 01:02:16,713
it had meant the world to me.

1073
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,870
- So why do you hide from that now?

1074
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,573
- Because it's not my time.

1075
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,087
- Now I get it.

1076
01:02:27,635 --> 01:02:29,863
- I haven't been in that gym,

1077
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:34,720
for like 40 years, oh my God!

1078
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,790
- Not even when Teresa played?

1079
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:38,513
Not even now when she's coaching?

1080
01:02:40,192 --> 01:02:41,025
- I can't.

1081
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,040
- Teresa could really use you now.

1082
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,064
- Teresa has done very well on her own.

1083
01:02:47,064 --> 01:02:49,464
- Does she knows the story?
- Oh yes, she knows.

1084
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,180
- So you won't go?

1085
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:53,903
Not even to the last home game?

1086
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:57,700
- No.
- You know,

1087
01:02:59,177 --> 01:03:01,343
"The Cat" gave people a lot of hope.

1088
01:03:02,637 --> 01:03:03,743
"The Cat" was real.

1089
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,133
You ask these people, "The Cat" was a hero.

1090
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,340
and they could use a hero right now.

1091
01:03:17,674 --> 01:03:20,091
(door knock)

1092
01:03:24,737 --> 01:03:27,654
(door creaks open)

1093
01:03:30,033 --> 01:03:32,732
- What are you doing here?
(door closes)

1094
01:03:32,732 --> 01:03:34,770
- I know about "The Cat."

1095
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,380
She told me everything.

1096
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:39,710
- So she told you.

1097
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:42,293
- She didn't want to, but
she couldn't avoid it.

1098
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,283
That's why you coach, for her.

1099
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,890
- Yeah.

1100
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:53,483
- I just want you to
know that, I get it now.

1101
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:56,303
- You think so,

1102
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:58,693
- I know I do.

1103
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:01,910
Sorry, it took so long,

1104
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:04,663
but it really is special.

1105
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:06,553
- Yeah.

1106
01:04:06,553 --> 01:04:08,403
- Just wish I could have seen it sooner.

1107
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,967
Take care, okay.
- All right

1108
01:04:16,737 --> 01:04:19,654
(door creaks open)

1109
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:29,404

1110
01:04:53,141 --> 01:04:56,641

(background chatter)

1117
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,350
- Does your dad know you're here?

1118
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:06,680
- No, coach, I snuck out
my bedroom window.

1119
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,513
Can I suit up?

1120
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:14,942
- Yes, go warm up, you
got this, make it count.

1121

- (sniffles) Win one for your dad, okay.

1132
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:01,363
- No mom, this one it's for you.

1133
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:04,180
All right, listen up ladies,

1134
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:05,377
this is important, okay?

1135
01:07:05,377 --> 01:07:08,493
I want you to take a moment, soak this up.

1136
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,520
You are living in a moment

that will stay with you
for the rest of your lives.

1138

Look at each other,

1139
01:07:16,592 --> 01:07:20,930
you'll know each other for
the rest of your lives, okay.

1140
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:23,480
Doesn't matter if we win or lose tonight,

1141
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,920
I want you to know all of this,

1142

She doesn't touch the ball at all,

1166
01:10:48,587 --> 01:10:52,293

foul, do not foul, okay.

On the side of the barn

1198
