3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,708
(soft music)

4
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,186
(door opening)

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,178
(gun firing)

6
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:27,845
(soft music)

7
00:00:50,536 --> 00:00:53,196
- Exterior, beach, day.

8
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,866
Max looks upon the overwhelming idea

9
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:58,353
that this is the Pacific Ocean.

10
00:00:59,497 --> 00:01:01,417
(waves rolling)

11
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:03,862
(gulls calling)

12
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:06,180
(soft music)

13
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,307
(gulls calling)

14
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:26,747
(soft music)

15
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:31,926
(waves rolling)

16
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:34,244
(soft music)

17
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:12,697
- All right, my flock,
let's continue to focus

18
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:16,975
that energy on picturing
yourself invisible.

19
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:19,008
Picture this moment right now,

20
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,332
but picture yourself not in it.

21
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:24,542
Good.

22
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:27,141
Now, I want you to focus
on a particular part

23
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:29,845
of your body, maybe your hand,

24
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:32,271
and picture that part of your body,

25
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:35,324
maybe your hand, becoming invisible.

26
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,131
Good.

27
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:40,449
(soft music)

28
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:51,551
Now open that energy to your entire body.

29
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:55,519
And we're gonna do that for a while.

30
00:02:56,704 --> 00:02:59,149
(waves rolling)

31
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:01,467
(soft music)

32
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:06,586
- [Everrett] Interior,
night, Max's car, stopped.

33
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,079
Max opens her eyes and eats
a candy bar in the dark.

34
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,628
- Holy schnikes, I thought
I'd never stop peeing.

35
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:15,994
At this point, I think it'd be healthier

36
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:17,973
for you to go back to smoking.

37
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:22,170
- I am gonna really miss
these nights with you, DeeDee.

38
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,784
- Why, are you going somewhere?

39
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:26,575
- No, just.

40
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:30,245
Okay, all right, let's get this over with.

41
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:33,615
Could you turn off your
damn high beams, asshole?

42
00:03:35,597 --> 00:03:37,333
You can do this one on
your own, if you want.

43
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,165
I'll stay here with the
stuff until you signal.

44
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:40,536
- You sure?

45
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:41,677
- I don't really feel like making chitchat

46
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:43,250
with a buncha dope heads.

47
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,890
- Okay, but if anything goes down.

48
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,086
- You just flash the signal,
and I will be out there

49
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:49,289
full steam eddy with a gun up their ass.

50
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:52,362
(crickets chirping)

51
00:03:53,543 --> 00:03:54,343
Fuck.

52
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:07,025
(waves rolling)

53
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,810
(gulls calling)

54
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,128
(soft music)

55
00:04:21,524 --> 00:04:22,324
- How was it?

56
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:25,155
- Good.

57
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:26,369
- Will you come back next week?

58
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:27,558
- I'm afraid not.

59
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,006
I'm heading east today.

60
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:29,805
- Where east?

61
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:31,049
I'm from Baltimore.

62
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:31,912
- Delaware.

63
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:32,711
- All the way then?

64
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:36,765
- Yeah, my mom is sick,
like deathbed sick.

65
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:38,579
So I'm gonna go take care of her.

66
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,332
- I'm sorry to hear about your mother,

67
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:42,519
but I'm glad she has a
daughter as kind and caring

68
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,056
as you are to take care of her.

69
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,017
- I'm not even her favorite.

70
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:48,599
That's the real kick in the nuts.

71
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,289
Oh hold on.

72
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:51,088
Do you want, um,

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,903
do you want one?

74
00:04:53,903 --> 00:04:55,389
- Does it look like I want one?

75
00:04:57,351 --> 00:04:59,925
- Are you more in the Christmas spirit?

76
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,287
- I don't think so.

77
00:05:01,287 --> 00:05:02,086
- No worries.

78
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:04,021
- Namaste.

79
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:06,339
(soft music)

80
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:37,619
- Exterior, Everett's backyard
in the Hollywood Hills.

81
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:40,808
Everett stops tending his
vegetables at the sight

82
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,852
of the white brick on his table.

83
00:05:42,852 --> 00:05:45,655
- [Max] For you. And Robbie.

84
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:49,335
- [Everett] Now what is that?

85
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:51,109
Should I even ask where you got this?

86
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:53,913
- You know what it is,
and no you shouldn't.

87
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:56,579
- All right, well, I'll
put it somewhere safe.

88
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:02,647
You want a beer?

89
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:04,169
They're inside. Help yourself.

90
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:06,051
- No, I quit.

91
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:06,850
- Quit?

92
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,500
Oh, those are worse than anything.

93
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,818
(soft music)

94
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:26,769
Can you clean these off for me?

95
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:29,330
- I hate beets.

96
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:31,977
They really taste like dirt.

97
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:35,127
(soft music)

98
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:40,174
- So what's your plan for
when you get back home?

99
00:06:40,174 --> 00:06:41,085
- Watch my mom die.

100
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:44,212
- Now don't be morbid.

101
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:46,085
- I could say take care of her, but,

102
00:06:46,983 --> 00:06:49,544
look, when I get down to
it, I'm gonna watch her die.

103
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:50,781
And I'm gonna make sure that she dies

104
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:53,642
as comfortably as possible.

105
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:58,377
However the fuck I'm supposed
to do that. I have no clue.

106
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,649
Honestly, I'm guessing it's a lot of

107
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:02,590
soup and pillow fluffing.

108
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:05,560
- You gotta do it, though.

109
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,359
- Do I, Ev?

110
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:08,474
Do I really?

111
00:07:09,914 --> 00:07:12,762
What does it say about
me when my first instinct

112
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:15,236
is to run the fuck away to
a cabin in the mountains

113
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:18,104
and not show my face until I
know that she's good and gone,

114
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,617
so that I don't have to deal with it?

115
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:22,966
- I think everyone has
those split-second thoughts,

116
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:24,961
but you'd never actually do it.

117
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:25,760
- Why not?

118
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:29,536
I've been known to be a
selfish asshole before.

119
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:32,138
Just ask Megan, if you can find her.

120
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,705
- Still no luck?

121
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:35,504
- [Max] No.

122
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:40,056
- Well, she's bound to
show up sooner or later.

123
00:07:40,056 --> 00:07:41,620
I mean, how long have
you two known each other?

124
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,988
And how many end-of-the-world, knockdown,

125
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:45,350
dragout fights have you had?

126
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,642
- Too long and too many.

127
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:49,937
- See, you're perfect for each other.

128
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,704
- She's never been gone this long, though.

129
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:57,744
I don't know, I really
screwed up this time.

130
00:07:59,253 --> 00:08:00,676
- It couldn't have been that bad.

131
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:02,242
- It wasn't my finest hour.

132
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,401
It wasn't hers either, but still.

133
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:08,514
She changed her number.

134
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,408
She's never done that before.

135
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,763
She basically vanished.

136
00:08:15,138 --> 00:08:16,577
- Does your mom have a garden?

137
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,758
- Mm, she got a little backyard,

138
00:08:20,758 --> 00:08:23,009
about the size of what you got here.

139
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,326
- Well when you get back
and you get settled,

140
00:08:24,326 --> 00:08:26,100
you should start one if there's room.

141
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:29,054
It'll keep you calm.

142
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:29,891
Keeps me calm.

143
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:34,366
Keeps me from thinking
about my surroundings,

144
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:36,150
where my next gig's coming from,

145
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,033
how the last one almost destroyed me.

146
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:42,193
This is just you and your two hands

147
00:08:42,193 --> 00:08:43,836
digging holes and planting life.

148
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:47,851
My last job, it almost killed me.

149
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:50,479
I was working 80-hour weeks,
working through my lunch,

150
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,205
and all I could think
about was buying a farm

151
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:55,157
in the middle of nowhere
and becoming a farmer.

152
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:57,395
(chuckling)

153
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,438
- As he talks, we see it.

154
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:05,977
Acres of land sprawled out
behind a beautiful red barn

155
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:09,314
and a giant white house
with a wraparound porch.

156
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:12,403
Even a goddamn dog laying at the feet

157
00:09:12,403 --> 00:09:15,848
of an unknown farmer rocking
in his rocking chair.

158
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:19,787
- You know, I think at my age,
my priorities have changed.

159
00:09:21,887 --> 00:09:23,796
Maybe raising chickens
and planting veggies

160
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,276
is what I'm supposed to be doing.

161
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:29,752
- [Jack] And then we see rows and rows

162
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,468
of planted tomatoes.

163
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:33,418
The unknown farmer inspects his crops.

164
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,948
(soft music)

165
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,161
- You know, Meg and I used to
get this cabin up in Carmel

166
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,062
whenever the two of us
both had a free weekend.

167
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:02,014
- Amongst the majestic and
towering trees, a secluded cabin.

168
00:10:02,014 --> 00:10:04,852
No other people in sight,
just how it should be.

169
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:06,965
- It was really small.
It was just one room.

170
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:11,278
And the bed was up this small ladder

171
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,743
under a slanted roof,
so you couldn't sit up.

172
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:15,066
And if you rolled too far to the left,

173
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:17,378
you'd fall 10 feet to the floor.

174
00:10:17,378 --> 00:10:19,344
And the bathtub was out on the porch.

175
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:22,221
And the road, it was this
long, winding, gravelly road

176
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,921
that you could only travel by foot.

177
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,208
- And then we see gravel road.

178
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,833
Max and Megan, wagons filled
with groceries and suitcases.

179
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,995
- But the owners had left
these small, kiddie red wagons

180
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:35,936
down at the bottom of the hill

181
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,511
so that we could haul
our stuff up with them.

182
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,587
- And then we see Max and Megan.

183
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:45,382
They make love in the outdoor
tub, with only the lights

184
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:47,600
from inside the cabin illuminating them.

185
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:50,717
Above them, nothing but trees and stars.

186
00:10:54,109 --> 00:10:57,008
- The cabin and the solitude
along with Megan, it just,

187
00:10:58,731 --> 00:11:00,141
it always made me kinda
second guess that maybe

188
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:02,347
I just picked the wrong
fucking career choice.

189
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:05,572
But it's too late now.

190
00:11:06,802 --> 00:11:08,576
I don't know how to do anything else.

191
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:11,765
And when you think about
it, the one thing that I did

192
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:15,898
devote myself to doing,
I failed at that too, so

193
00:11:15,898 --> 00:11:18,536
what does that tell you about
how big of an idiot I am?

194
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,432
All right, these good enough?

195
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:22,591
- [Everett] Good enough.

196
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:23,550
- All right.

197
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:26,447
I don't know.

198
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:29,754
I don't think I have it
in me anymore, you know.

199
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,634
You stay out here long enough,
you start to just become

200
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:37,064
that sad, pathetic old bag, you know,

201
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:39,503
just chasing a fucking pipe dream.

202
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:43,768
And, the longer that I
stay out here, the sadder

203
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:44,567
and more pathetic I become,

204
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,370
and that might be worse than anything.

205
00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:49,932
(soft music)

206
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,542
- I know you're moving back
east, but you can still write.

207
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:04,570
There's no rule saying
you gotta be out here.

208
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,612
- Why can't I let it go, though?

209
00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:07,849
I mean, you're talking about giving it up

210
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:10,516
and going to live on a damn farm.

211
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:14,160
And you're successful.

212
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,785
- Oh, data wrangling is not successful.

213
00:12:17,785 --> 00:12:21,132
- Oh really? I deliver
drugs and do CC work.

214
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:22,638
- See, you work in TV?

215
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:24,297
- Get the fuck outta here.

216
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:26,436
- And famous people need their drugs.

217
00:12:26,436 --> 00:12:28,360
- Oh, God, the last thing
those cats wanna hear

218
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,531
from their delivery
chick when they're buying

219
00:12:30,531 --> 00:12:32,065
large quantities of delivered drugs

220
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:34,233
is my pitch for the
Streets of Fire reboot.

221
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,247
- Well maybe you're doing it
wrong, because I'd totally be

222
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:38,980
into a Streets of Fire reboot
while chipping my nuts off.

223
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,682
- Maybe I am doing it wrong (chuckles).

224
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:46,595
Okay, I should get outta here.

225
00:12:46,595 --> 00:12:49,005
I gotta finish packing up my stuff.

226
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,311
- You will always have
friends and a place to stay

227
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:53,522
out here, you know that.

228
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:55,123
- [Max] I know.

229
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:58,350
- Anytime, middle of the
night, you call us up

230
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,795
and we'll have clean sheets
ready in the guestroom.

231
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:02,422
- Thank you.

232
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,774
Hey, say goodbye to Robbie for me.

233
00:13:04,774 --> 00:13:05,632
I really wanted to catch her,

234
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:07,984
but I'm just behind schedule as it is.

235
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:11,171
(soft music)

236
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:18,120
- I'll walk you out.

237
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,973
- Thank you.

238
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:21,291
(soft music)

239
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:32,111
- Interior, Max's car, driving, day.

240
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:34,534
Her phone is ringing.

241
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:38,172
- Hits speaker on phone,
doesn't say anything.

242
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:39,284
- Uh, Max?

243
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:40,589
- Yeah.

244
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:42,171
- It's DeeDee, what's going on, man?

245
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:43,226
- What you mean, girl?

246
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,317
- What you mean what you mean, girl?

247
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:47,455
You tore off with the
goods and left me with two

248
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:49,776
supremely creepy and
pissed off dope smokers.

249
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:51,415
Do you not realize who these people are

250
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:53,354
and what they're capable of?

251
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:56,259
- DeeDee, it's been really
fun making deliveries with you

252
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:59,539
and everything, but I just had to split.

253
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,237
I am sorry that it was
on your watch and all,

254
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:04,910
but good luck with the
little script and everything.

255
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,684
- Thanks, it just made the blacklist.

256
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:10,405
- I gotta go, DeeDee.

257
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:13,236
- [DeeDee] Max, you know they kill people.

258
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:16,274
(soft dramatic music)

259
00:14:22,515 --> 00:14:24,168
- [Waitress] And my dad told me I should

260
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:25,088
bring these out to you.

261
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:27,994
He said to me to tell
you that you'd like them

262
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:30,001
so much that you'd like
to clean your plates.

263
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:32,632
Umm.

264
00:14:32,632 --> 00:14:34,950
(soft music)

265
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:55,720
- Interior, Max's apartment, day.

266
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,941
Max loads up her car.

267
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:01,439
- Yeah, I'm packing up now, Mom.

268
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:04,956
Not too much, um.

269
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:07,673
I sold slash gave away most of it, so.

270
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:11,055
No, no, I got plenty.

271
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:13,839
No, no, besides, you don't
have any money anyway.

272
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,349
Hey, is your nurse there?

273
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,759
Okay, how long has she been there?

274
00:15:19,571 --> 00:15:21,646
Okay, all right, you all right then, did?

275
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,511
I said, are you good then, Mom?

276
00:15:27,196 --> 00:15:28,004
Mom, hey.

277
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,754
Mom, can you turn down.

278
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:34,324
Can you turn down the v-

279
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,496
No, no, I don't wanna know what's on.

280
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:40,277
I just want you to turn
down the volume on it.

281
00:15:40,277 --> 00:15:42,243
Yes, yes, I know, I know.

282
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:44,132
The commercials are always louder.

283
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:46,111
Yeah, they do that for the old people, so.

284
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,959
No, but it's true, Mom.

285
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:51,162
Can you turn it down?

286
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:54,854
That's better.

287
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,312
Okay, well, I'm sorry to tell you, Mom,

288
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:57,757
but you're fucking old (laughs).

289
00:16:00,254 --> 00:16:02,434
Don't act like you're a
prude all of a sudden.

290
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:06,056
Yeah, yeah, Regina's coming.

291
00:16:06,056 --> 00:16:08,859
Yeah, we buried the hatchet and made up.

292
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,383
Yes, it had been a while since we talked,

293
00:16:13,383 --> 00:16:15,275
but you know, we did it for you.

294
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:18,409
Yeah, I think we realized
that all of our issues

295
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:21,372
were pretty petty, compared to the actual

296
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:23,002
serious shit like your health and.

297
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:27,471
Hey, don't start crying, you big baby.

298
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:31,960
Okay, hey, listen, just
need to stay strong

299
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,542
for a few more days, and
then we're all gonna be

300
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:36,193
together like you wanted, and we-

301
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:38,511
(soft music)

302
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,154
Hey, Mom, I'm gonna let you go, okay?

303
00:16:43,238 --> 00:16:45,118
Yeah, go get your rest.

304
00:16:45,118 --> 00:16:47,093
I need to just get a few more things done

305
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:48,839
before I can head out.

306
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,882
I think I can hit the road by tonight,

307
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:52,742
tomorrow morning at the latest.

308
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:55,071
But I'm gonna try to get the fuck outta-

309
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:57,818
Sorry, get outta Dodge by sundown,

310
00:16:58,707 --> 00:17:01,719
but I gotta stop by the
office and finish off

311
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,442
a few more things, get that
final paycheck and then.

312
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:07,064
Yes, and then pick up Regina, of course.

313
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,119
Okay.

314
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,501
Yeah, hey, just promise me you won't talk

315
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:12,460
to her for too long.

316
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,512
Yeah, you really need your rest

317
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:16,718
and you're gonna be
seeing us soon enough, so.

318
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:20,986
Okay, all right, yeah, I'll
call you from the road.

319
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:22,971
And, hey, I'll be seeing you
and knocking on your door

320
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:25,061
in just a few days' time.

321
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:26,165
Yeah, four at the most.

322
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:29,579
All right, love you too, Mom, bye.

323
00:17:30,612 --> 00:17:33,409
(soft piano music)

324
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:49,072
(phone clicking)

325
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:56,500
(soft piano music)

326
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:12,331
- Interior, Max's car, driving.

327
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:14,352
Day, Max drives.

328
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:16,670
(soft music)

329
00:19:21,518 --> 00:19:23,408
- She grabs a candy bar from her bag,

330
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:25,415
unwraps it and takes a big old bite.

331
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:29,142
(soft piano music)

332
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:07,987
(keys striking)

333
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:14,919
(Max sighing)

334
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:19,252
- What up, Austin?

335
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,048
- Didn't think you were
gonna make it in today.

336
00:20:21,048 --> 00:20:23,623
- Yeah, traffic, and all that shit.

337
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,131
You know how it is.

338
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:26,637
- Yeah, I do know how it is,

339
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:28,229
which is why I leave early enough

340
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:29,461
to make it to work on time.

341
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,454
Make sense?

342
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:31,816
- Yeah, yeah, no, it sure does.

343
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:34,233
And I just, I can't seem to get going

344
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,388
before a certain hour, I have no idea why.

345
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:39,287
I go to bed at like nine.

346
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:42,292
- Really? Because it smells
like you've been up all night.

347
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:45,617
- It just must be my
natural musk, I guess.

348
00:20:45,617 --> 00:20:49,223
- Well you're natural musk
smells like deep-fried butthole.

349
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:51,678
Clean yourself up tomorrow
before you come in,

350
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:52,477
like an adult.

351
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:54,471
- Yes, yes, will do, Boss.

352
00:20:55,638 --> 00:20:57,355
- You gonna have that
file ready for me today?

353
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:00,328
- Yeah, I got like another hour.

354
00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:02,393
- Good, I need to deliver by EOD.

355
00:21:03,215 --> 00:21:04,858
- You're gonna have it by lunchtime.

356
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:06,492
- Good.

357
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:08,810
(soft music)

358
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:17,250
(keys striking)

359
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,305
(phone vibrating)

360
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:25,623
(soft music)

361
00:21:40,878 --> 00:21:43,276
(Max sighing)

362
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:46,296
- Ooh.

363
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:48,614
(soft music)

364
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:20,602
(bottles jiggling)

365
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:22,920
(soft music)

366
00:22:26,985 --> 00:22:29,714
(paper unwrapping)

367
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:32,032
(soft music)

368
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:44,921
- Through the window, Max
sees Nadine cross the street

369
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:47,845
toward the less than five-star motel.

370
00:22:47,845 --> 00:22:50,163
(soft music)

371
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:55,471
- Nadine goes to the
second floor of the motel,

372
00:22:56,276 --> 00:22:59,214
fishes out keys from her
giant bag and enters her room.

373
00:23:00,704 --> 00:23:03,326
(soft music)

374
00:23:03,326 --> 00:23:04,429
- That's fucking tasty.

375
00:23:05,938 --> 00:23:07,625
I haven't had one of
these since grade school.

376
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:11,007
Oh, was this?

377
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,012
Come on, don't be like that.

378
00:23:13,012 --> 00:23:14,779
Just get another one from the fridge.

379
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,467
No one will know.

380
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,928
(soft music)

381
00:23:19,928 --> 00:23:22,622
(bottles jiggling)

382
00:23:22,622 --> 00:23:24,940
(soft music)

383
00:23:31,483 --> 00:23:33,970
It's fun not doing what
you're supposed to be doing.

384
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,769
Am I right?

385
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:37,327
(phone ringing)

386
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:39,992
My mom again.

387
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:43,413
God, her voicemails are
always so rambly pambly.

388
00:23:44,887 --> 00:23:47,111
(soft music)

389
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:49,292
God, being sick hasn't
zapped her of her ability

390
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:51,693
to ramble about the
fucking most random things.

391
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:54,816
Like, okay, she called because she can't

392
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:57,099
seem to get a hold of Regina, oops.

393
00:23:57,099 --> 00:23:58,604
But now she's on a tirade about some

394
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,414
turkey fest in the Ozarks.

395
00:24:02,536 --> 00:24:05,337
Okay, and how they drop
the turkeys from the plane

396
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:07,437
and how that is such a waste of resources

397
00:24:07,437 --> 00:24:09,659
and the turkeys don't
deserve such treatment.

398
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,103
(laughs) Think of the turkeys,
yes, she just said that.

399
00:24:16,317 --> 00:24:18,322
Oh, man, I guess this is what she

400
00:24:18,322 --> 00:24:19,857
and my sis talk about for hours.

401
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,097
(soft music)

402
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:23,898
Pfft.

403
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:26,321
(soft music)

404
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:27,567
You enjoy that lunch, man.

405
00:24:29,054 --> 00:24:30,003
Hey, what's up?

406
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:31,423
- Oh, hey.

407
00:24:31,423 --> 00:24:33,312
- Hey, I finished that file and I sent it

408
00:24:33,312 --> 00:24:34,636
off like 10 minutes ago.

409
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:35,981
- [Austin] I don't need
to go over it, do I?

410
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:38,462
Your work solid when
it comes to this show?

411
00:24:38,462 --> 00:24:39,670
- Rock solid, pal.

412
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,483
Yeah, you can just send it
right off to the client.

413
00:24:41,483 --> 00:24:43,173
- [Austin] All right, good.

414
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:45,496
Give me a few minutes, and
I'll get you something else.

415
00:24:45,496 --> 00:24:47,352
- Yeah, you know what, you
take your time, buddy boy.

416
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,577
I'm just gonna step outside and, you know,

417
00:24:49,577 --> 00:24:51,400
get some fresh air, all that nonsense.

418
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,988
(soft music)

419
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:58,653
- What the hell are you
doing eating my lunch, Tony?

420
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,900
(soft music)

421
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,017
(phone clicking)

422
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:18,813
(soft music)

423
00:25:25,713 --> 00:25:26,512
- Come in.

424
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:30,576
(soft music)

425
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:31,622
It's gonna have to be a quickie.

426
00:25:31,622 --> 00:25:33,732
I was due back at work
like 10 minutes ago.

427
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,420
So what's it gonna be?

428
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,299
Foot fetish, horsey ride.

429
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:39,917
- [Max] Nadine, stop smoking that weed.

430
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:41,183
- Max, what the hell?

431
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:43,207
- Oh my God, I have always wondered

432
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:46,247
what you do on your long breaks.

433
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:47,312
Don't worry, I won't say nothing.

434
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,274
- Thanks.

435
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,304
Do you want some?

436
00:25:51,388 --> 00:25:53,795
- Mm, no. No, I quit.

437
00:25:53,795 --> 00:25:55,400
Do you have any candy?

438
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,286
- No, I don't think so.

439
00:25:57,286 --> 00:25:58,657
- That's all right.

440
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,691
So, this is where the magic happens.

441
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:03,280
- [Nadine] Some might say.

442
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,740
I would say. I am pretty magical.

443
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,324
- Okay, well, fill me in on all this

444
00:26:08,324 --> 00:26:10,808
magic the gathering shit going on here.

445
00:26:10,808 --> 00:26:13,522
- [Nadine] Well, every
day at this time I have

446
00:26:13,522 --> 00:26:16,233
a slot on a website where I perform.

447
00:26:16,233 --> 00:26:17,445
- Perform, huh?

448
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:18,874
- Yeah, perform.

449
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:21,262
I mean, sometimes it's
just some straight-up

450
00:26:21,262 --> 00:26:24,542
missionary position sex, but
other times, I'm dominated.

451
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:27,754
Sometimes I dominate, and
sometimes I just ride him

452
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,615
around the room like a horsey with a GoPro

453
00:26:29,615 --> 00:26:30,749
strapped to my boobs.

454
00:26:31,897 --> 00:26:33,326
- Do you have that video?

455
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:34,947
- Wouldn't you like to know?

456
00:26:34,947 --> 00:26:36,856
- That's why I asked.

457
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:38,141
- No.

458
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:40,292
- Okay, I'll look it up later.

459
00:26:42,821 --> 00:26:44,499
- Oh, you know what?

460
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:46,257
There might be a candy bar in there.

461
00:26:47,176 --> 00:26:49,096
But you might not wanna eat it.

462
00:26:49,096 --> 00:26:50,551
- Think I just found it.

463
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:51,532
- Yep, that's it.

464
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:55,826
- I don't wanna know where this has been.

465
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,242
Or do I?

466
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,041
- You don't.

467
00:26:59,041 --> 00:26:59,840
- Okay.

468
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,479
- You know, my whole
life I've been told that

469
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:07,411
to be a truly creative person,
I need to have experience.

470
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:08,504
- Whatever the fuck that means.

471
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:11,343
- Exactly, so I sit around
waiting for that phone call

472
00:27:11,343 --> 00:27:13,376
from Hollywoodland that everybody wants.

473
00:27:13,376 --> 00:27:16,515
That's exactly what I'm getting
in the meantime, experience.

474
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:20,425
I mean, and a girl's gotta pay her rent.

475
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:21,988
- Preach, sister.

476
00:27:21,988 --> 00:27:23,408
- I mean, in the grand scheme of things,

477
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,693
am I really doing anything that terrible?

478
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:29,424
I'm not a murderer, I'm not
a racist, I don't do drugs.

479
00:27:31,989 --> 00:27:34,484
Hard drugs.

480
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:36,365
And everybody I deal with are fine,

481
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:39,136
upstanding, consenting adults.

482
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,831
- [Max] And some of us
are just horsing around.

483
00:27:41,831 --> 00:27:42,630
- [Nadine] Really?

484
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,643
- [Max] Sorry.

485
00:27:43,643 --> 00:27:45,724
Okay, well, you convinced me.

486
00:27:45,724 --> 00:27:46,962
When can I book some time?

487
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:47,844
- [Nadine] You just did.

488
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:50,273
This conversation's
costing you a pretty penny.

489
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:52,268
- Oh shit.

490
00:27:53,895 --> 00:27:55,315
Okay.

491
00:27:55,315 --> 00:27:59,068
Well, I have to get something out of this.

492
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:01,932
Do you know anyone who might
be interested in buying

493
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:05,788
like a large quantity of
drugs for sorta super cheap?

494
00:28:05,788 --> 00:28:06,596
- Mm.

495
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:08,962
Oh, did you try Guy?

496
00:28:08,962 --> 00:28:10,842
He loves buying large quantity of drugs,

497
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:13,345
especially for super sorta cheap.

498
00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:14,668
Oh, I don't think he's here today,

499
00:28:14,668 --> 00:28:15,714
but I can get his number for you.

500
00:28:15,714 --> 00:28:17,708
- Dammit, no no, no no no, it's all right.

501
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:20,470
We've hung out a couple
times outside work.

502
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,657
Yeah, he and Meg were old college chums.

503
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:24,000
- [Nadine] Is Meg your girl?

504
00:28:25,544 --> 00:28:26,343
- Was.

505
00:28:28,155 --> 00:28:30,713
(phone ringing)

506
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:33,027
- Yeah?

507
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:35,223
Yeah.

508
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:37,343
What's he want?

509
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:43,005
Okay, send him up in like two.

510
00:28:43,978 --> 00:28:45,292
Thanks.

511
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:46,451
- I thought you had to get back.

512
00:28:46,451 --> 00:28:47,841
- [Nadine] They won't notice.

513
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:53,714
- [Max] Okay, well, thank you
for the talk and everything.

514
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:56,847
- No problem. Max?

515
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:57,646
- Yeah?

516
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:02,831
- [Nadine] No, jerk.

517
00:29:02,831 --> 00:29:04,442
- Oh fuck, I'm sorry.

518
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:05,241
Okay.

519
00:29:06,226 --> 00:29:07,025
Um.

520
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:09,816
That's all I got.

521
00:29:12,153 --> 00:29:13,256
- [Nadine] Good enough.

522
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,979
- That is my motto. Good enough.

523
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:19,297
(soft music)

524
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:23,262
Okay.

525
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,716
- Exterior, motel, Max
dodges traffic and dials.

526
00:29:44,914 --> 00:29:47,782
- Hey, this is Guy, leave me a message.

527
00:29:47,782 --> 00:29:49,709
Or not, I don't give a beep!

528
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:52,299
- Hey, Guy, it's Max.

529
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:54,255
Listen, I've got something that I was told

530
00:29:54,255 --> 00:29:55,857
you'd be interested in.

531
00:29:55,857 --> 00:29:57,103
Give me a call super quick.

532
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:59,328
I really need to unload it fast, okay.

533
00:29:59,328 --> 00:30:01,342
Yeah, we'll talk about it when we meet up.

534
00:30:02,693 --> 00:30:05,011
(soft music)

535
00:30:09,264 --> 00:30:11,249
- [Waitress] Do you want
me to take these plates or?

536
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:12,048
(banging table)

537
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:14,794
(waitress gasping)

538
00:30:14,794 --> 00:30:17,112
(soft music)

539
00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:22,995
(phone ringing)

540
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:25,313
(soft music)

541
00:30:28,357 --> 00:30:30,229
(phone ringing)

542
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:31,028
- [Jack] Yeah?

543
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:32,032
- [Max] Hey, it's Max.

544
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:33,259
You got any time?

545
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:34,058
- [Jack] When?

546
00:30:34,058 --> 00:30:35,299
- [Max] Right now, or
as close to right now

547
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:36,264
as you can get.

548
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:39,407
- [Jack] I just had a cancellation.

549
00:30:39,407 --> 00:30:40,893
I'm just down here banging
away at Fish Tales.

550
00:30:40,893 --> 00:30:41,776
- [Max] Heading to you right now.

551
00:30:41,776 --> 00:30:43,342
- [Jack] Okay, see you in a few.

552
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:47,167
(soft music)

553
00:30:50,158 --> 00:30:52,107
- [Everrett] Interior, arcade, day.

554
00:30:52,968 --> 00:30:56,612
Lights, buzzers, silver balls, tilts.

555
00:30:56,612 --> 00:30:59,211
Multi balls, hands on flippers.

556
00:30:59,211 --> 00:31:01,081
Quarters falling in the change machine.

557
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:04,044
- This is my last session.

558
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:06,845
I'm heading back east, tonight hopefully.

559
00:31:08,072 --> 00:31:10,788
- [Jack] Is it your mom?
Is she that bad off?

560
00:31:10,788 --> 00:31:12,611
- I'm taking my sister to see her too.

561
00:31:13,424 --> 00:31:14,364
Oh, watch the gutter.

562
00:31:14,364 --> 00:31:15,946
- [Jack] Ah, yep, thank you.

563
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:19,634
Well that's, I mean
that's really good, Max.

564
00:31:19,634 --> 00:31:21,465
We've talked a lot about
her in the last sessions

565
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:23,503
about how you've got a lot of anxiety

566
00:31:23,503 --> 00:31:25,959
about finally meeting her.

567
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,915
Thinking that she might
hurt you in some way.

568
00:31:27,915 --> 00:31:29,227
- Yeah.

569
00:31:29,227 --> 00:31:31,418
- And so they were just that?

570
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:34,465
Thoughts in your head?

571
00:31:34,465 --> 00:31:36,239
Stories running rampant in your mind.

572
00:31:37,544 --> 00:31:40,958
- Yeah, except that she
showed up at my front door

573
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:42,454
and tried to shoot me in the face,

574
00:31:42,454 --> 00:31:44,557
but other than that, watch the gutter.

575
00:31:45,926 --> 00:31:47,010
- [Jack] What'd you say?

576
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,375
- I said watch the gutter because of that.

577
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:53,519
- Max, you're being serious right now?

578
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:55,415
Max?

579
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,211
- I mean, luckily, I've been
like super paranoid lately,

580
00:31:58,211 --> 00:32:00,052
so when she showed up, you know,

581
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:02,715
I'd gotten a gun and I was ready for her.

582
00:32:02,715 --> 00:32:03,514
- I don't know what to--

583
00:32:03,514 --> 00:32:04,735
- So then I shot her in the face.

584
00:32:05,692 --> 00:32:07,437
It's okay, I mean, I feel pretty good.

585
00:32:07,437 --> 00:32:09,144
Really, considering.

586
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:11,446
(ball striking)

587
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:14,766
- [Jack] Max, you have to tell the police.

588
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,924
Unless, you're not serious?

589
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:20,962
- They'll figure it out.

590
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:23,319
I mean, the police are
really smart people, right?

591
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:26,292
So, besides, it's not exactly
like I'm trying to hide it.

592
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:28,445
She's in my trunk for Chrissakes.

593
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:29,975
I just need a little bit of time to tie up

594
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:32,641
a few loose ends, and hopefully I can just

595
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:34,962
avoid them until then, you know.

596
00:32:34,962 --> 00:32:35,940
It shouldn't be that hard.

597
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,839
I mean, that fucking
Eileen Warnos in training

598
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,891
has no job and no friends,
and the only person

599
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,390
that she ever talked to was Mom.

600
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:44,437
- Max, one more time.

601
00:32:44,437 --> 00:32:46,355
Last chance, you are messing with me?

602
00:32:47,755 --> 00:32:50,699
Max, you're playing a sick
joke on me, right, Max?

603
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:52,697
Tell me that you're
playing a sick joke on me.

604
00:32:53,987 --> 00:32:55,044
What the hell, Max?

605
00:32:55,044 --> 00:32:56,418
- What?

606
00:32:56,418 --> 00:32:58,823
What do you want me to
do? Okay, it's done.

607
00:32:58,823 --> 00:33:00,980
I can't unshoot her in the face.

608
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,201
- You're not human.

609
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,427
Watch the multiple ramp.

610
00:33:04,427 --> 00:33:05,626
- [Max] Got it.

611
00:33:06,832 --> 00:33:08,921
- Okay, Max, one last time, just tell me

612
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:10,382
that you're playing a joke on me.

613
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:12,012
- [Max] No.

614
00:33:12,012 --> 00:33:13,422
- Max, you're not serious, Max.

615
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:16,836
Max?

616
00:33:16,836 --> 00:33:17,955
- What's up?

617
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:19,347
- [Jack] You are messing with me.

618
00:33:19,347 --> 00:33:21,308
(chuckling)

619
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:22,107
- No.

620
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:26,124
- [Jack] Okay, Max, I have to report this.

621
00:33:26,124 --> 00:33:27,609
- Why?

622
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:30,334
This is not exactly a
legit session, is it?

623
00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:32,027
- Max.

624
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:33,516
- What?

625
00:33:33,516 --> 00:33:36,158
She was a fucking bully, okay.

626
00:33:36,158 --> 00:33:38,920
Really, a piece of shit,
nobody's gonna miss her.

627
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,841
- That is not the point.

628
00:33:39,841 --> 00:33:40,831
- Well it should be.

629
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:44,598
Fuck.

630
00:33:44,598 --> 00:33:46,007
All right.

631
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:48,501
All right, all right, you wanna talk?

632
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:49,300
Let's talk.

633
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:53,603
Let's talk about how
sometimes I think that my life

634
00:33:53,603 --> 00:33:56,346
would be a whole lot easier
if I had a fucking disability.

635
00:33:56,346 --> 00:33:57,583
Just a little one.

636
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:59,645
Nothing like too major, but, you know.

637
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:01,563
Maybe a little bit of the old Down's.

638
00:34:01,563 --> 00:34:03,328
Or maybe if my dad had punched me

639
00:34:03,328 --> 00:34:05,073
one too many times in the head

640
00:34:05,073 --> 00:34:06,780
and scrambled my brains just a little bit

641
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,141
too much, you know.

642
00:34:08,141 --> 00:34:11,891
Just enough to like me
a little off, a touch.

643
00:34:11,891 --> 00:34:14,779
Just so that I could
still appreciate things.

644
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:16,051
- Why would you want that?

645
00:34:17,032 --> 00:34:18,815
- [Max] I would be innocent to everything.

646
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:20,255
Everybody would be my friends.

647
00:34:21,147 --> 00:34:22,259
- You don't think that
people with disabilities

648
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:23,058
have a hard time?

649
00:34:23,058 --> 00:34:24,263
- No, I have no doubt that every day

650
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:26,190
is an enormous struggle for them.

651
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,205
But, they have a group
of people who are there

652
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:30,170
to support them at all times.

653
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:33,125
If I need to call in someone
for help, I'm considered weak,

654
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,516
needy, if anybody even bothers to answer.

655
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:38,495
But if I'm a little bit slow,

656
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:40,088
just a little bit
scrambled eggs in the head,

657
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:43,617
then I get a lot of compassion
and understanding and

658
00:34:44,509 --> 00:34:47,737
bless her heart and
God love her, you know.

659
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:50,282
And I can go on disability and play RPGs

660
00:34:50,282 --> 00:34:51,739
all day at the local comic shop.

661
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:54,900
Or, or I could just, I could
get a job bagging groceries

662
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,578
and be perfectly content with that.

663
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,410
- You don't believe that.

664
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,440
You're trying to be hateful,
but it doesn't suit you.

665
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,457
- [Max] I wish that were true,

666
00:35:04,457 --> 00:35:06,618
but I've had this realization.

667
00:35:07,486 --> 00:35:09,053
- Yeah?

668
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:11,326
- And I'm not a very nice person.

669
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:13,323
Not human. You just said.

670
00:35:14,872 --> 00:35:16,867
If you could look into
my brain, you would run

671
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:20,243
the other way so goddam fast
it would turn your hair white.

672
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,495
- We all have those thoughts, Max.

673
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,328
But the fact that you're
not acting on them, right?

674
00:35:24,328 --> 00:35:26,429
The fact that you feel remorse about them,

675
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:28,567
even a little bit, shows
that you're not as bad

676
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:30,859
of a person, or horrible of a
person as you think you are.

677
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:31,658
- I don't know.

678
00:35:31,658 --> 00:35:33,404
I mean, my thoughts get pretty dark.

679
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:36,972
Plus I just murdered my sister.

680
00:35:36,972 --> 00:35:38,315
- [Jack] Tell me about that.

681
00:35:38,315 --> 00:35:40,785
- (chuckles) You still
think I'm making it up.

682
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:41,584
- [Jack] Tell me what happened.

683
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:45,209
- Okay, so I was taking a
break from boxing up my stuff.

684
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:48,976
And like weeks before I'd
had this strange feeling

685
00:35:48,976 --> 00:35:51,613
like someone was watching
me, right, like following me.

686
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,807
And I hadn't spoken to her in years,

687
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:57,367
but my mom had been talking to her.

688
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:59,256
And she mentioned she'd
just moved out here,

689
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:01,513
and that gave me this really uneasy,

690
00:36:01,513 --> 00:36:04,035
queasy feeling, like a sense of dread.

691
00:36:05,155 --> 00:36:07,610
Like any day she was just
gonna show up at my door,

692
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,285
and I, I don't know what.

693
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:11,676
- [Jack] Why would you think that?

694
00:36:11,676 --> 00:36:13,587
- Because, she is a fucking cunt.

695
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:17,332
Bullied me my whole life, beat me up,

696
00:36:17,332 --> 00:36:20,442
tortured me, told people
that she was an only child.

697
00:36:20,442 --> 00:36:22,667
I mean, my God, I couldn't
imagine any scenario

698
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:23,693
where there was gonna be hugs

699
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:25,275
and goodwill exchanged, you know.

700
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,037
So, I said, fuck me.

701
00:36:29,111 --> 00:36:30,841
And I took a couple of deep breaths,

702
00:36:31,653 --> 00:36:34,472
and I slowly grabbed the doorknob,

703
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:37,820
and when I yanked open the door,

704
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,021
well, you see where this is going.

705
00:36:39,021 --> 00:36:40,716
(gun firing)

706
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:41,630
- [Jack] Dammit.

707
00:36:42,796 --> 00:36:45,328
Okay, tell me, did anyone
hear the shots? Did anyone--

708
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,846
- Hold on, hold on.

709
00:36:49,021 --> 00:36:51,543
- Hey, Max, I'm definitely interested in

710
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,342
what you think I'd be interested in.

711
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:54,890
Come to my house, posthaste, my lady.

712
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,519
Text me when you're on your way.

713
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,992
Peace.

714
00:36:57,992 --> 00:36:59,056
- I'm sorry, you were saying?

715
00:36:59,897 --> 00:37:00,731
- [Jack] Did anyone hear the shots,

716
00:37:00,731 --> 00:37:02,009
or did anyone see anything?

717
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,596
- Not that I know of.

718
00:37:04,596 --> 00:37:05,814
Why?

719
00:37:05,814 --> 00:37:07,572
You still think I'm making it up.

720
00:37:08,966 --> 00:37:10,724
- [Jack] I don't.

721
00:37:11,716 --> 00:37:13,505
(ball shooting)

722
00:37:13,505 --> 00:37:14,541
- I have her body right outside

723
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:16,148
in the trunk, if you wanna see it.

724
00:37:16,148 --> 00:37:17,346
- No, I'm good.

725
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:19,101
Ooh.

726
00:37:21,956 --> 00:37:23,874
Max, I think we're done.

727
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,789
For the day.

728
00:37:28,718 --> 00:37:29,517
- Okay.

729
00:37:30,452 --> 00:37:31,807
Okay, well, it's been, um.

730
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:40,742
- Have a good trip home, Max.

731
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:41,541
- Yep.

732
00:37:43,015 --> 00:37:46,097
- And don't kill anyone on
your way out, psychopath.

733
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:50,803
Hey, if anybody's on
Haunted House, I got next.

734
00:37:52,421 --> 00:37:54,739
(soft music)

735
00:38:01,522 --> 00:38:04,110
(phone clicking)

736
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,428
(soft music)

737
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:11,886
(sword whooshing)

738
00:38:11,886 --> 00:38:14,204
(soft music)

739
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:51,257
(phone ringing)

740
00:38:52,459 --> 00:38:55,672
- Hey, I'm outside your
apartment. Where are you at?

741
00:38:55,672 --> 00:38:57,887
- Oh, hey, I'm actually not there.

742
00:38:57,887 --> 00:39:00,451
I'm at the Batcade, hitting some balls.

743
00:39:01,513 --> 00:39:02,328
- Okay.

744
00:39:02,328 --> 00:39:03,814
- Off your mom's chin (laughs).

745
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,548
Hey, get back here, you daffy bitch.

746
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:15,054
- Who the fuck are you
calling a daffy bitch,

747
00:39:15,054 --> 00:39:16,359
you daffy bastard?

748
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:21,154
- [Guy] Oh, hey.

749
00:39:24,582 --> 00:39:25,767
- [Max] Ah!

750
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:27,178
- Whoa.

751
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:27,976
Whoa.

752
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:33,401
Can I sample?

753
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:34,386
- You're buying. You can
do whatever you want.

754
00:39:34,386 --> 00:39:37,496
- Ah, ah ah, I'm not buying yet.

755
00:39:37,496 --> 00:39:39,145
- Oh horseshit, come on, you'll buy it.

756
00:39:39,145 --> 00:39:40,344
I'll bet you Greek.

757
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:41,462
- I'll take that.

758
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,261
- Okay.

759
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:48,934
(snorting)

760
00:39:51,054 --> 00:39:53,212
(groaning)

761
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:55,816
- You see?

762
00:39:57,096 --> 00:40:00,372
- I can see, for miles.

763
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,412
I want this.

764
00:40:02,412 --> 00:40:03,211
- It's yours.

765
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:06,727
- Great.

766
00:40:06,727 --> 00:40:08,339
Now, where did you get this stuff?

767
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,279
Don't you normally deliver it?

768
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,223
- [Max] Not anymore.

769
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,730
- So, this is somebody else's drugs then?

770
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,226
- [Max] I mean.

771
00:40:18,226 --> 00:40:20,902
- Look, I don't care. I'm still buying.

772
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:24,057
I just, you know, wanna
know if I need to bury it

773
00:40:24,057 --> 00:40:26,685
in a deep, dark hole
somewhere or something.

774
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:29,274
- Uh, yeah, yeah, I would say so.

775
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:30,281
It's such a large quantity.

776
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:32,650
I'd say the darker and the
deeper the hole is probably best.

777
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,874
- [Guy] Yeah, right.

778
00:40:33,874 --> 00:40:36,832
Man, I do love me some shady dealings.

779
00:40:36,832 --> 00:40:37,887
- All right.

780
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:39,798
Well let's deal some shadiness then, okay,

781
00:40:39,798 --> 00:40:41,694
because you owe me Greek and my tummy's

782
00:40:41,694 --> 00:40:43,631
growling like an angry alley cat.

783
00:40:43,631 --> 00:40:44,763
- Why does it feel like I'm more worried

784
00:40:44,763 --> 00:40:46,748
about these drugs than you are?

785
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:48,216
- I don't know.

786
00:40:48,216 --> 00:40:49,513
Hummus trumps safety.

787
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,671
(laughing)

788
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,325
- Okay, I'm gonna go get some money

789
00:40:54,325 --> 00:40:55,907
and we'll go get our tzatziki on.

790
00:40:56,772 --> 00:40:59,570
(soft piano music)

791
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:10,708
Heads up.

792
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,131
- Okay.

793
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:15,145
- What, you're not gonna count it?

794
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:17,994
- No, even if you shorted
me, what am I gonna do?

795
00:41:17,994 --> 00:41:19,730
Take the drugs to Delaware?

796
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,233
- You might need to. You're
moving to Delaware and all.

797
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,432
- How dare you?

798
00:41:23,432 --> 00:41:24,582
- Okay, look.

799
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,028
Come on, let's go.
Daddy is getting hangry.

800
00:41:27,028 --> 00:41:27,827
- Yo.

801
00:41:29,512 --> 00:41:30,730
You're not gonna stash this?

802
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,444
- No, we're gonna be gone
for like a few minutes.

803
00:41:33,444 --> 00:41:36,221
- Okay, well, like draw
a blind or something.

804
00:41:36,221 --> 00:41:37,571
- Oh, now who's worried.

805
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:42,311
(door opening and closing)

806
00:41:42,311 --> 00:41:44,949
(dramatic music)

807
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,128
(sword unsheathing)

808
00:41:51,128 --> 00:41:53,605
(door buzzing)

809
00:41:55,032 --> 00:41:57,509
(door opening)

810
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,709
(sword unsheathing)

811
00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:05,346
(dramatic music)

812
00:42:20,274 --> 00:42:22,641
- They always forget the pop.

813
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:25,278
(dramatic music)

814
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:34,787
- Exterior, suburbs, day.

815
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,575
Guy and Max walk down the street.

816
00:42:37,575 --> 00:42:41,286
Guy tells a very elaborate
and animated story.

817
00:42:41,286 --> 00:42:43,025
Max listens, but we don't hear.

818
00:42:44,068 --> 00:42:45,413
Instead, we hear-

819
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,035
- [Max] Have you seen Meg lately?

820
00:43:04,035 --> 00:43:06,809
- No, last time I saw her
was Crab's birthday party.

821
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,173
You know, I've known Meg for a long time.

822
00:43:10,173 --> 00:43:13,462
That girl can hold a grudge,
but this seems a bit much.

823
00:43:13,462 --> 00:43:14,997
- Yeah, but you didn't
see the whole thing.

824
00:43:14,997 --> 00:43:17,634
I mean, it started at the
party and then it continued

825
00:43:17,634 --> 00:43:18,670
into the car and the apartment.

826
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:19,840
- Yeah, I don't think
you actually ever told me

827
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,048
what happened afterwards.

828
00:43:21,048 --> 00:43:22,525
- Well, you saw the beginning.

829
00:43:22,525 --> 00:43:26,441
- Flashback, interior
Crabtree's kitchen, night.

830
00:43:27,282 --> 00:43:29,613
Max pours a shot for Megan.

831
00:43:29,613 --> 00:43:31,933
- She downs it without hesitation.

832
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:33,871
This is our first time witnessing

833
00:43:33,871 --> 00:43:35,830
Megan living and breathing.

834
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:38,295
And she's a fucking firecracker.

835
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:42,169
(upbeat music)

836
00:43:42,169 --> 00:43:44,228
(Max groaning excitedly)

837
00:43:44,228 --> 00:43:45,763
- Pour me another.

838
00:43:45,763 --> 00:43:48,247
- What kind of mischief are
you mischief makers making?

839
00:43:48,247 --> 00:43:50,340
- Oh, just a little bit of drunk mischief.

840
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:52,850
Man, we found this bottle of hooch.

841
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:54,260
- [Megan] Expensive.

842
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,526
- It's nice hooch.

843
00:43:55,526 --> 00:43:58,221
And Crabtree was trying to
fucking hide it from us.

844
00:43:58,221 --> 00:43:59,467
- [Megan] So we're gonna drink it all.

845
00:43:59,467 --> 00:44:00,618
- I can get behind that.

846
00:44:02,229 --> 00:44:03,364
A toast.

847
00:44:03,364 --> 00:44:04,163
To, uh.

848
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:06,941
- To go fucking ourselves, I guess so.

849
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,931
(partiers chattering)

850
00:44:09,931 --> 00:44:12,742
- [Max] Hey, you keep
an eye out for Crabs.

851
00:44:12,742 --> 00:44:14,294
- [Guy] Oh, do we know where he's at?

852
00:44:14,294 --> 00:44:15,934
- He's in the backyard sweating Tara.

853
00:44:15,934 --> 00:44:17,552
He's been on that shit since college.

854
00:44:17,552 --> 00:44:18,399
(laughing)

855
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:19,918
Don't tell Steph.

856
00:44:19,918 --> 00:44:21,190
- [Guy] No doubt.

857
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,271
I've been on that shit since high school.

858
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:25,246
- Okay, good luck.

859
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,817
She's hot as shit, and word
is that she doesn't have

860
00:44:27,817 --> 00:44:30,157
any interest in sexual encounters.

861
00:44:30,157 --> 00:44:30,982
- Well, I don't care.

862
00:44:30,982 --> 00:44:32,861
Ask Meg how many times I've tried

863
00:44:32,861 --> 00:44:34,236
and how many times I've listened.

864
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:36,489
- Her tits are such a waste.

865
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,881
- [Megan] What are you...

866
00:44:39,881 --> 00:44:41,368
- [Max] Because she's
got really nice titties.

867
00:44:41,368 --> 00:44:42,385
You said so yourself.

868
00:44:42,385 --> 00:44:44,488
- Yeah, I can say that
because she is my friend.

869
00:44:45,562 --> 00:44:47,418
(Max laughing)

870
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:48,216
- Oh my God (laughs).

871
00:44:50,373 --> 00:44:52,867
Okay, all right, can we forget her?

872
00:44:52,867 --> 00:44:54,248
Let's just finish this
up, we're almost done.

873
00:44:54,248 --> 00:44:55,047
- Go to hell.

874
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:57,308
- What?

875
00:44:57,308 --> 00:44:59,785
(upbeat music)

876
00:45:02,172 --> 00:45:05,865
Meg?

877
00:45:05,865 --> 00:45:07,026
Baby?

878
00:45:07,026 --> 00:45:10,063
(partiers chattering)

879
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,733
- Interior, Steph's bedroom.

880
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:18,085
Max finds Megan digging
through Steph's drawers.

881
00:45:18,085 --> 00:45:21,043
- Megan pulls out some lacy underwear.

882
00:45:21,043 --> 00:45:23,414
- [Megan] Steph even has
nicer underwear than me.

883
00:45:23,414 --> 00:45:24,678
- [Max] Nice.

884
00:45:24,678 --> 00:45:26,494
- She throws the underwear at her.

885
00:45:27,296 --> 00:45:28,754
Max catches them.

886
00:45:28,754 --> 00:45:30,346
- [Max] These would look good on you.

887
00:45:30,346 --> 00:45:31,497
- [Megan] Shut up.

888
00:45:31,497 --> 00:45:33,377
- Max holds them up to Megan.

889
00:45:33,377 --> 00:45:35,189
- [Max] No, I'm serious.

890
00:45:35,189 --> 00:45:36,609
Hey, come here.

891
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,153
- [Megan] Oh my God, just give me a break.

892
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:40,119
- Meg slams the drawer shut.

893
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:42,104
- [Max] So is this still
about the titty remark?

894
00:45:42,104 --> 00:45:43,859
- [Megan] Just because you
and I talk about Tara's tits

895
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:46,106
doesn't mean you can go
talk to Guy about them.

896
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:48,827
- Meg sits on the bed.

897
00:45:48,827 --> 00:45:50,553
- Max stays near the dresser.

898
00:45:50,553 --> 00:45:53,933
- [Max] Look, we've both
had a lot to drink, okay.

899
00:45:53,933 --> 00:45:55,943
We're just saying things.

900
00:45:55,943 --> 00:45:57,421
- [Megan] Things?

901
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,763
You mean things that
we're actually thinking

902
00:45:58,763 --> 00:46:00,968
but we don't say until
we're nice and lubricated,

903
00:46:00,968 --> 00:46:01,927
those kind of things?

904
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:04,843
- [Max] Wow, we really shouldn't
hit the bottle so hard.

905
00:46:04,843 --> 00:46:07,845
You know, we used to have
a nice time together.

906
00:46:07,845 --> 00:46:09,245
Now all we do is fight.

907
00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:11,077
- [Megan] Fight, oh, is this a fight?

908
00:46:11,077 --> 00:46:12,285
- [Max] Yeah, always.

909
00:46:12,285 --> 00:46:14,241
- [Megan] I thought I was just
calling you out on your shit.

910
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:16,380
- [Max] Yeah, that's all you do anymore

911
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,771
is call me out on my shit.

912
00:46:17,771 --> 00:46:20,092
- [Megan] Can we please just go?

913
00:46:20,092 --> 00:46:20,891
- [Max] Sure.

914
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:23,611
I don't like these people anyway.

915
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:25,817
- Megan's had enough, storms out.

916
00:46:25,817 --> 00:46:28,713
Max pockets the underwear
and takes a breather.

917
00:46:28,713 --> 00:46:30,133
- From offscreen we hear

918
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:32,664
a girl fight.

919
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:33,463
(Megan shouting and shrieking)

920
00:46:33,463 --> 00:46:35,171
Max races out of the room to discover.

921
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,148
- [Megan] You fucking bitch.

922
00:46:38,148 --> 00:46:41,130
(upbeat dramatic music)

923
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,448
(struggling)

924
00:46:44,503 --> 00:46:47,294
Get the fuck off me (screams).

925
00:46:47,294 --> 00:46:49,531
(screaming)

926
00:46:53,042 --> 00:46:55,669
- You love it when I do this.

927
00:46:55,669 --> 00:46:56,468
Hm?

928
00:46:57,603 --> 00:46:59,570
I'm not even touching you.

929
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:02,735
(upbeat music)

930
00:47:02,735 --> 00:47:03,824
(radio clicking)

931
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:04,623
I hate that song.

932
00:47:04,623 --> 00:47:06,423
- You hate every song.

933
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,581
- That's because all
new music sucks anymore.

934
00:47:10,691 --> 00:47:13,088
- Are you sure it's the music's fault?

935
00:47:13,088 --> 00:47:14,626
- Are you saying that I suck?

936
00:47:17,864 --> 00:47:19,543
- No, Meg, I'm not saying that you suck.

937
00:47:19,543 --> 00:47:21,020
Okay, never mind, never mind.

938
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:21,818
- Awesome.

939
00:47:25,652 --> 00:47:28,416
- Later, Max and Megan's apartment.

940
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:30,734
(soft music)

941
00:47:39,455 --> 00:47:41,665
(sighing)

942
00:47:41,665 --> 00:47:43,983
(soft music)

943
00:48:01,272 --> 00:48:04,252
(furniture squeaking)

944
00:48:04,252 --> 00:48:06,570
(soft music)

945
00:48:17,531 --> 00:48:20,377
- [Megan] You call me Tara,
and I'll call you Crabtree.

946
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:21,401
- What?

947
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:23,449
- [Megan] You know you want to.

948
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:24,248
- No.

949
00:48:25,171 --> 00:48:26,318
- [Megan] Call me Tara.
I'll call you Crabtree.

950
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:28,155
- Megan, stop, it's not funny.

951
00:48:29,054 --> 00:48:29,853
- No?

952
00:48:31,382 --> 00:48:32,998
I think it's downright hilarious.

953
00:48:35,934 --> 00:48:37,522
(Megan thudding)

954
00:48:37,522 --> 00:48:38,932
Yeah, run away, run away like a pussy

955
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:40,332
like you always fucking do.

956
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:41,934
- [Max] Oh, oh, you wanna see a pussy?

957
00:48:41,934 --> 00:48:42,971
- [Megan] Hell, yeah.

958
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:46,338
(punch striking and Max thudding)

959
00:48:46,338 --> 00:48:47,137
Max.

960
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,958
- You're fucking insane!

961
00:48:51,385 --> 00:48:54,632
(lock clicking)

962
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:55,915
- Max, come on.

963
00:48:55,915 --> 00:48:58,233
(soft music)

964
00:48:59,156 --> 00:48:59,976
I'm sorry.

965
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:04,778
Come on, open up.

966
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:07,096
(soft music)

967
00:49:07,957 --> 00:49:08,774
Max.

968
00:49:08,774 --> 00:49:11,092
(soft music)

969
00:49:19,845 --> 00:49:21,235
Come on. I won't do it again.

970
00:49:22,144 --> 00:49:25,181
(soft dramatic music)

971
00:49:50,476 --> 00:49:52,653
- Hi, Officers, can I help you?

972
00:49:52,653 --> 00:49:53,913
- Are you Megan Sayles?

973
00:49:55,473 --> 00:49:57,123
- Yeah, why?

974
00:49:57,123 --> 00:49:58,226
- We got a call from this residence

975
00:49:58,226 --> 00:50:00,259
about a possible domestic violence.

976
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:02,215
- Is there anyone else in the apartment?

977
00:50:02,215 --> 00:50:03,014
- Yes.

978
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:07,691
- Max, what is this?

979
00:50:07,691 --> 00:50:08,564
- Ma'am, can you turn around,

980
00:50:08,564 --> 00:50:09,619
put your hands behind your back?

981
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:11,118
- What, are you serious?

982
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:14,479
(soft music)

983
00:50:20,686 --> 00:50:21,568
Mm.

984
00:50:21,568 --> 00:50:23,886
(soft music)

985
00:50:26,194 --> 00:50:28,033
Next stop Willoughby.

986
00:50:28,033 --> 00:50:30,351
(soft music)

987
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:36,606
- That was the last time I ever saw her.

988
00:50:36,606 --> 00:50:38,748
I mean, I went to bail
her out and she was gone.

989
00:50:40,169 --> 00:50:42,389
(sighing)

990
00:50:42,389 --> 00:50:43,860
I will never forget that look.

991
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,079
- Mm, good stuff, man.

992
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,246
Oh, sorry.

993
00:50:53,246 --> 00:50:54,553
No, this,

994
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,216
it's good stuff, that sucks, yeah.

995
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:02,196
Did you try calling
around, Crabtree or Tara?

996
00:51:04,087 --> 00:51:05,285
Well, not Tara.

997
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,392
- Nobody's heard from her.

998
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:09,655
Or at least that's what
they're telling me.

999
00:51:09,655 --> 00:51:11,180
Yeah, I keep like stopping
by our old haunts,

1000
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,606
hoping maybe she'll show up, you know.

1001
00:51:13,606 --> 00:51:15,444
Like every couple weeks, I'll
go to her old dance class.

1002
00:51:15,444 --> 00:51:16,243
- Right.

1003
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:17,260
- [Max] She used to
take tap at this studio

1004
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,009
over on Magnolia, and I'm
thinking maybe I'll run into her.

1005
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:20,808
- Mm-hm.

1006
00:51:22,448 --> 00:51:23,247
Sad as shit, man.

1007
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:24,693
Hey, are you gonna finish that?

1008
00:51:27,014 --> 00:51:27,812
Thank you.

1009
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:30,859
Could I get a box for this?

1010
00:51:30,859 --> 00:51:31,658
Box.

1011
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:34,321
Thank you.

1012
00:51:34,321 --> 00:51:37,064
- Exterior. Guy's neighborhood.

1013
00:51:37,064 --> 00:51:38,666
Guy carries a to-go box.

1014
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:41,303
Max craves a fucking candy
bar and would kill two

1015
00:51:41,303 --> 00:51:42,646
of you assholes to have one.

1016
00:51:48,611 --> 00:51:50,849
- So, you heading straight for the border?

1017
00:51:52,284 --> 00:51:53,579
- I think I might check in on Meg's

1018
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:55,317
dance class one last time.

1019
00:51:55,317 --> 00:51:56,312
- Mm.

1020
00:51:56,312 --> 00:51:59,333
Well, good luck with that, I guess.

1021
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:02,843
And, oh, thanks for the drugs.

1022
00:52:02,843 --> 00:52:04,061
- Enjoy.

1023
00:52:04,061 --> 00:52:05,647
- Hey, come on.

1024
00:52:06,462 --> 00:52:09,041
Let me get one last
whiff, you smelly bastard.

1025
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:09,839
Okay.

1026
00:52:11,457 --> 00:52:12,896
Yeah, that's good.

1027
00:52:13,851 --> 00:52:15,369
That's really good.

1028
00:52:17,597 --> 00:52:19,485
(sniffing)

1029
00:52:19,485 --> 00:52:22,811
Oh, I'm going to eat the
living pita out of you

1030
00:52:22,811 --> 00:52:23,818
once we get in there.

1031
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:25,729
Mm.

1032
00:52:27,789 --> 00:52:31,116
Uh, who the fuck are you guys?

1033
00:52:31,116 --> 00:52:31,972
- The reckoning.

1034
00:52:33,753 --> 00:52:34,821
- [Guy] Oh, please.

1035
00:52:36,007 --> 00:52:37,784
- What's in the container?

1036
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:39,664
- It's yours.

1037
00:52:41,272 --> 00:52:42,873
- Everything is ours.

1038
00:52:42,873 --> 00:52:45,205
(Guy sobbing)

1039
00:52:45,205 --> 00:52:47,523
(soft music)

1040
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:14,455
- Okay, come on guys, look.

1041
00:53:14,455 --> 00:53:16,181
If I knew this was your boss' stash,

1042
00:53:16,181 --> 00:53:19,068
I woulda told Max to just go away.

1043
00:53:19,068 --> 00:53:21,335
Come on, you gotta believe
me for Christ sakes.

1044
00:53:21,335 --> 00:53:24,132
To hell with that chick.
I barely even know her.

1045
00:53:24,132 --> 00:53:25,506
I hardly like her.

1046
00:53:27,047 --> 00:53:30,893
Look, she's going to some
dance studio on Magnolia,

1047
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:34,116
to look for her ex, Meg.

1048
00:53:34,116 --> 00:53:35,611
Megan.

1049
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:36,938
- Shut it or I cut it.

1050
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:40,805
- He said kill them all.

1051
00:53:40,805 --> 00:53:42,966
- Oh, God, please no, please!

1052
00:53:42,966 --> 00:53:45,744
(sword striking)

1053
00:53:45,744 --> 00:53:48,062
(soft music)

1054
00:53:57,396 --> 00:54:01,072
- Fatality (echoes).

1055
00:54:05,946 --> 00:54:09,063
(soft saxophone music)

1056
00:54:35,487 --> 00:54:39,671
- I used to dance.

1057
00:54:39,671 --> 00:54:41,134
- Sorry, what was that?

1058
00:54:41,134 --> 00:54:42,860
- I used to dance.

1059
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,568
- What was that again?

1060
00:54:44,568 --> 00:54:46,816
- Jesus, I said I used to dance.

1061
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,450
I'm too old now.

1062
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,063
I'm Bernice.

1063
00:54:50,063 --> 00:54:51,683
- I bet you could cut a mean rug.

1064
00:54:51,683 --> 00:54:53,288
- Oh, don't be daft.

1065
00:54:53,288 --> 00:54:55,937
I'm hold as hell, but I
still enjoy watching others.

1066
00:54:55,937 --> 00:54:59,173
(soft saxophone music)

1067
00:54:59,173 --> 00:55:01,298
See that girl there?

1068
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,722
- She your niece or something?

1069
00:55:02,722 --> 00:55:05,260
- She's attractive, isn't she?

1070
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,726
- Yeah.

1071
00:55:06,726 --> 00:55:08,802
- I enjoy watching them dance,

1072
00:55:08,802 --> 00:55:11,563
especially the young, pretty ones.

1073
00:55:11,563 --> 00:55:13,669
- I bet you would have
blown her away in the looks

1074
00:55:13,669 --> 00:55:15,705
department when you were her age.

1075
00:55:15,705 --> 00:55:18,023
- Stop messing with me, girl.

1076
00:55:21,007 --> 00:55:23,388
Do you know Esther Williams?

1077
00:55:23,388 --> 00:55:25,176
- Not personally, no.

1078
00:55:25,176 --> 00:55:28,711
But yeah, she did the
water-dancing pictures, right.

1079
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:30,871
- She dropped acid.

1080
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:32,678
- Get outta here.

1081
00:55:32,678 --> 00:55:34,939
- Cary Grant turned her on to it.

1082
00:55:34,939 --> 00:55:37,976
- Wild, did you ever do acid, Bernice?

1083
00:55:39,056 --> 00:55:41,470
- Yes, but that's not
where I'm going with this.

1084
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:43,124
- Where are you going then, girl?

1085
00:55:43,124 --> 00:55:47,007
- Shut your mouth and
I'll tell you (laughs).

1086
00:55:47,007 --> 00:55:51,083
Well I first saw Esther
Williams in Bathing Beauty.

1087
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:56,060
And when I saw her dive
into that beautiful,

1088
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,674
crystal-clear blue water, and
all those gorgeous dancers

1089
00:55:58,674 --> 00:56:02,671
in rows and rows all around
in perfect harmony, I.

1090
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:07,818
Oh my, I started saving my
money right then and there.

1091
00:56:07,818 --> 00:56:11,689
By the time Thrill of a
Romance had come out, well,

1092
00:56:11,689 --> 00:56:14,734
I was on a Greyhound heading through Texas

1093
00:56:14,734 --> 00:56:16,763
on my way to Hollywoodland.

1094
00:56:16,763 --> 00:56:18,742
- How was it when you got out here?

1095
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:20,719
- Well, after I got settled
in with a couple other girls

1096
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:23,893
in an apartment near Hollywood and Vine,

1097
00:56:23,893 --> 00:56:26,186
I went on a lot of auditions.

1098
00:56:26,186 --> 00:56:27,846
And went out on a lotta dates.

1099
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:31,075
But I don't know, somehow
I could just not get

1100
00:56:31,075 --> 00:56:35,259
my tap-dancing, water-balleting
foot in the door, so

1101
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:40,054
I started waitressing to make ends meet.

1102
00:56:40,222 --> 00:56:43,590
And I've been making ends meet
now for just about 50 years

1103
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:46,079
at the same greasy spoon.

1104
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,444
I'm old enough to retire,

1105
00:56:47,444 --> 00:56:51,503
but what the hell else would
I do except die faster?

1106
00:56:51,503 --> 00:56:54,620
(soft saxophone music)

1107
00:56:56,767 --> 00:56:57,726
Look at her.

1108
00:56:59,178 --> 00:57:02,135
She's been dancing there for a while.

1109
00:57:03,288 --> 00:57:05,075
So much heart.

1110
00:57:05,075 --> 00:57:06,114
So much hope.

1111
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:11,242
Not disenchanted by the
whole business of life yet.

1112
00:57:12,157 --> 00:57:15,514
Eventually she'll get it, and she'll stop.

1113
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,814
And she'll stop coming.

1114
00:57:20,814 --> 00:57:24,393
And some other young
person will take her place.

1115
00:57:24,393 --> 00:57:28,949
And over and over and over,
until I eventually drop dead.

1116
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:32,776
Hopefully right on this spot.

1117
00:57:36,902 --> 00:57:38,983
I gotta use the ladies' room.

1118
00:57:38,983 --> 00:57:41,059
Number one or number two?

1119
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:43,042
- [Bernice] A lady never tells.

1120
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,317
- Well I aint no lady, Bernice.

1121
00:57:45,317 --> 00:57:48,434
(soft saxophone music)

1122
00:58:13,261 --> 00:58:14,060
- Bye, Bernice.

1123
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,021
- Oh, bye, honey.

1124
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:17,409
Aw.

1125
00:58:19,478 --> 00:58:22,345
Thanks for the company and
for the sweet sweet treat.

1126
00:58:22,345 --> 00:58:23,827
- My pleasure, Bernice.

1127
00:58:23,827 --> 00:58:26,944
(soft saxophone music)

1128
00:58:34,382 --> 00:58:37,222
(giggling)

1129
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,120
Would you like another?

1130
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:38,919
- Okay.

1131
00:58:41,902 --> 00:58:45,175
- Bernice, do you see
those ladies over there?

1132
00:58:45,175 --> 00:58:47,733
- Why, yes dear, I see them all.

1133
00:58:49,419 --> 00:58:53,718
- Max, I want you to focus
on becoming invisible.

1134
00:58:54,934 --> 00:58:56,152
Good.

1135
00:58:56,152 --> 00:58:59,665
Now open up that energy
to your entire body.

1136
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:02,685
Good.

1137
00:59:02,685 --> 00:59:05,903
(waves crashing)

1138
00:59:05,903 --> 00:59:09,020
(soft saxophone music)

1139
00:59:13,808 --> 00:59:14,821
Good.

1140
00:59:14,821 --> 00:59:17,938
(soft saxophone music)

1141
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:22,564
- This was fun.

1142
00:59:22,564 --> 00:59:24,282
- See you soon, Bernice.

1143
00:59:24,282 --> 00:59:26,550
(kissing)

1144
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:27,832
- Bye, dear.

1145
00:59:27,832 --> 00:59:30,948
(soft saxophone music)

1146
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,728
- [Megan] Max, what are you doing?

1147
00:59:43,026 --> 00:59:45,849
- Meg, what are you doing here?

1148
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:46,942
- What are you doing here?

1149
00:59:46,942 --> 00:59:49,656
- Looking for you. I was
just at your dance class.

1150
00:59:49,656 --> 00:59:51,318
- No you weren't. I just got done.

1151
00:59:52,265 --> 00:59:54,720
- No, that doesn't make any sense.

1152
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,519
I was just--

1153
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,936
- Tapmatics?

1154
00:59:56,936 --> 00:59:59,841
- This one. Dance, Dance, Baby.

1155
00:59:59,841 --> 01:00:01,568
- I go to the one across the street.

1156
01:00:03,524 --> 01:00:05,250
- And you've never been to this one?

1157
01:00:06,085 --> 01:00:07,495
- No, it's too expensive.

1158
01:00:07,495 --> 01:00:09,243
Been going there since we were together.

1159
01:00:10,094 --> 01:00:10,893
- Huh.

1160
01:00:12,338 --> 01:00:14,170
- Those gals with you?

1161
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:17,622
- Sorta. Meg, I need to talk to you.

1162
01:00:17,622 --> 01:00:19,962
- So talk. Here's just
as good a place as any.

1163
01:00:19,962 --> 01:00:20,761
- Hm-mm, mm-mm.

1164
01:00:20,761 --> 01:00:23,386
Could you give me a ride
and we can talk later?

1165
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:24,259
Please, Meg.

1166
01:00:24,259 --> 01:00:25,237
- Don't call me that.

1167
01:00:25,237 --> 01:00:26,244
- Megan, okay, I promise you I will be

1168
01:00:26,244 --> 01:00:27,624
outta your life forever.

1169
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,478
- Okay, fine, let's just go.

1170
01:00:28,478 --> 01:00:30,876
- Thank you, Meg, Megan.

1171
01:00:30,876 --> 01:00:33,593
(saxophone music)

1172
01:00:51,464 --> 01:00:52,263
- Hey, Meg.

1173
01:00:52,263 --> 01:00:53,072
- Megan.

1174
01:00:53,072 --> 01:00:54,486
(phone vibrating)

1175
01:00:54,486 --> 01:00:55,285
- Megan.

1176
01:00:56,722 --> 01:00:57,873
- Hey, Steve, what's up?

1177
01:00:59,753 --> 01:01:00,769
Really?

1178
01:01:00,769 --> 01:01:02,563
Okay, uh.

1179
01:01:02,563 --> 01:01:05,152
Yeah I mean, it's just more
than 10 days straight, so.

1180
01:01:07,339 --> 01:01:09,650
Yeah, okay, yeah, I'm the
new girl so I get screwed

1181
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:12,498
when it comes to shifts and
hours and shit like that.

1182
01:01:12,498 --> 01:01:13,419
Uh-huh.

1183
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:14,589
Just means I have to get drunk as fast

1184
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:16,220
as humanly possible, starting now.

1185
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,780
All right, peace, bye.

1186
01:01:21,513 --> 01:01:22,312
- Work?

1187
01:01:26,241 --> 01:01:27,577
Where you working these days?

1188
01:01:28,697 --> 01:01:30,298
- Can you do me a favor and get in my bag

1189
01:01:30,298 --> 01:01:32,120
up there, in the top, there's a mini.

1190
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:32,919
- Sure.

1191
01:01:36,186 --> 01:01:37,728
(bag unzipping)

1192
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:39,236
- Oh my God, Jesus Christ, dude.

1193
01:01:39,236 --> 01:01:41,193
- Um, I'm working on it.

1194
01:01:41,193 --> 01:01:42,152
- Okay, work harder.

1195
01:01:43,357 --> 01:01:44,994
- Oh, got it.

1196
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:48,315
(bag zipping)

1197
01:01:49,211 --> 01:01:51,596
Oh, should I, you want me to open it?

1198
01:01:51,596 --> 01:01:52,555
- Holy fuck.

1199
01:02:02,858 --> 01:02:03,657
Here.

1200
01:02:06,274 --> 01:02:08,976
I would have offered you
some, but I don't like you.

1201
01:02:11,808 --> 01:02:12,767
- It's okay.

1202
01:02:14,306 --> 01:02:16,588
I'm good. I actually
don't drink anymore, so.

1203
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:19,989
- Good for you.

1204
01:02:22,384 --> 01:02:24,109
- Megan, I--

1205
01:02:24,109 --> 01:02:26,672
(radio clicking)

1206
01:02:26,672 --> 01:02:28,990
(rock music)

1207
01:02:32,979 --> 01:02:33,959
(radio clicking)

1208
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:34,966
- What are you doing?

1209
01:02:36,148 --> 01:02:37,952
- I'm sorry. Habit.

1210
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,411
- Put it back, I like that song.

1211
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,397
- I thought you hated all new music.

1212
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,878
(rock music)

1213
01:02:51,732 --> 01:02:53,869
(music playing louder)

1214
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:54,926
Happy?

1215
01:02:54,926 --> 01:02:56,418
- Not even remotely.

1216
01:02:56,418 --> 01:02:59,135
(loud rock music)

1217
01:03:16,972 --> 01:03:21,077
- Super, later in Pasadena,
interior, apartment.

1218
01:03:21,077 --> 01:03:22,448
Living room.

1219
01:03:22,448 --> 01:03:25,134
Closeup of pictures on a
wall of unknown happy couple

1220
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,944
as they pose in front of
well nose, well-know, tour.

1221
01:03:27,944 --> 01:03:28,836
God dammit.

1222
01:03:28,836 --> 01:03:32,451
- As they pose in front of
well-known tourist attractions.

1223
01:03:32,451 --> 01:03:36,460
Grand Canyon, Stonehenge, Disneyland,

1224
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,330
world's largest chair.

1225
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:40,353
- Wider, Max studies the pictures,

1226
01:03:40,353 --> 01:03:42,435
scopes out the fully decorated

1227
01:03:42,435 --> 01:03:44,622
and clearly lived-in apartment.

1228
01:03:44,622 --> 01:03:47,214
- From upstairs the shower stops running.

1229
01:03:48,873 --> 01:03:51,350
(door opening)

1230
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:53,774
- Looking to steal?

1231
01:03:54,672 --> 01:03:56,111
- Looking for something sweet.

1232
01:03:57,118 --> 01:03:58,278
- Probably not gonna find it.

1233
01:03:58,278 --> 01:03:59,633
These people hike for fun.

1234
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:03,517
Besides, it looks like you
could lay off the sweets.

1235
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:05,973
- Ha ha.

1236
01:04:29,402 --> 01:04:31,800
(top popping)

1237
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:46,086
- I don't trust you with glassware, so.

1238
01:04:46,086 --> 01:04:47,825
- I don't drink, so.

1239
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:51,652
- Shame.

1240
01:04:56,195 --> 01:04:57,761
- So how long you been living here?

1241
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:00,945
- House sitting.

1242
01:05:02,122 --> 01:05:03,867
Just since last week.

1243
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:07,150
Until then, crashing on couches.

1244
01:05:08,662 --> 01:05:10,101
- So who's place is this then?

1245
01:05:12,115 --> 01:05:16,568
- One of my managers at my
sweet new job at Whole Foods.

1246
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:20,353
Her husband's a grip, so
she took some time off

1247
01:05:20,353 --> 01:05:22,811
to go hang with him in
Hotlanta while he's filming.

1248
01:05:24,486 --> 01:05:27,037
And I told her about my current situation,

1249
01:05:27,037 --> 01:05:30,196
so she took pity on me and here I am.

1250
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:32,130
- Whole Foods, huh?

1251
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:36,043
- Well, it's not delivering drugs,

1252
01:05:36,043 --> 01:05:38,568
but it pays the bills, as they say.

1253
01:05:41,682 --> 01:05:42,481
What about you?

1254
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,399
Are you still living at our, at the,

1255
01:05:46,717 --> 01:05:47,957
the old place?

1256
01:05:49,751 --> 01:05:50,550
- Yeah.

1257
01:05:51,675 --> 01:05:53,356
Or well I was, but, um,

1258
01:05:54,773 --> 01:05:55,581
Mom's sick.

1259
01:05:57,132 --> 01:05:59,837
She's like dying, so I'm gonna go

1260
01:06:01,074 --> 01:06:04,884
take care of her and then just stay there.

1261
01:06:06,751 --> 01:06:07,662
I'm done with here.

1262
01:06:10,962 --> 01:06:12,777
- Never were a team player, were you?

1263
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:18,550
- Well, you know, the team
kinda sucked, didn't it?

1264
01:06:19,497 --> 01:06:20,910
- [Megan] Was it the team?

1265
01:06:23,544 --> 01:06:24,407
- What you saying?

1266
01:06:27,908 --> 01:06:29,529
- Maybe you didn't suck, you know,

1267
01:06:29,529 --> 01:06:31,495
but maybe you weren't that great, either.

1268
01:06:37,752 --> 01:06:40,145
(scoffing)

1269
01:06:40,145 --> 01:06:41,008
- Now you tell me.

1270
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:45,010
- I'm not a monster.

1271
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:46,924
I couldn't tell you that
when we were together,

1272
01:06:46,924 --> 01:06:49,547
because it woulda broken your
heart, but now I don't care.

1273
01:06:53,534 --> 01:06:56,012
- Oh (groans).

1274
01:06:57,688 --> 01:07:00,534
To the fucking monsters then.

1275
01:07:00,534 --> 01:07:03,002
- Ah, so you do think I'm a monster?

1276
01:07:03,949 --> 01:07:05,860
- Not you, no, I mean us.

1277
01:07:06,711 --> 01:07:09,290
The human race, we're all just disgusting,

1278
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:12,276
cannibalistic, bottom-feeding monsters.

1279
01:07:14,402 --> 01:07:15,515
What?

1280
01:07:15,515 --> 01:07:18,171
What, it's in our DNA, okay.

1281
01:07:18,171 --> 01:07:21,489
So calling someone a monster
is not really an insult.

1282
01:07:21,489 --> 01:07:23,216
It's just, you know, like the truth.

1283
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:27,282
Okay, like you're only human, you know.

1284
01:07:27,282 --> 01:07:30,095
Same thing as, you're a monster.

1285
01:07:31,166 --> 01:07:32,262
Why thank you.

1286
01:07:33,564 --> 01:07:36,029
The Blob should be insulted

1287
01:07:36,029 --> 01:07:38,276
at the idea of being
called a fucking monster.

1288
01:07:39,117 --> 01:07:40,929
The Blob is the Blob.

1289
01:07:40,929 --> 01:07:44,104
Okay, it does what it
does. It's called the Blob.

1290
01:07:44,104 --> 01:07:47,540
It is a fucking blob and
it fucking eats everything.

1291
01:07:49,004 --> 01:07:49,803
Simple.

1292
01:07:50,822 --> 01:07:51,621
Mm-hm.

1293
01:07:53,742 --> 01:07:56,168
Why be angry with it when it eats you?

1294
01:07:56,168 --> 01:07:57,054
That's its nature.

1295
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,501
It's not lying to your face one second

1296
01:08:00,501 --> 01:08:04,656
and then turning around and stabbing you

1297
01:08:04,656 --> 01:08:05,778
in the back the next second.

1298
01:08:05,778 --> 01:08:08,262
You know, it's like, it wants
to eat you and you know it.

1299
01:08:08,262 --> 01:08:11,180
And it knows it, so don't
be surprised when it does.

1300
01:08:13,517 --> 01:08:15,598
That's what makes us worse.

1301
01:08:15,598 --> 01:08:19,358
We think that we're better
than something like the Blob,

1302
01:08:19,358 --> 01:08:22,139
or Freddy, or Jason.

1303
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:22,993
Or like the Thing.

1304
01:08:22,993 --> 01:08:25,736
Well, okay, the Thing,
the Thing's behavior

1305
01:08:25,736 --> 01:08:26,982
is actually closer to our behavior,

1306
01:08:26,982 --> 01:08:28,085
but that's because it mimics us, right.

1307
01:08:28,085 --> 01:08:29,879
So like the Thing's
actually just an asshole

1308
01:08:29,879 --> 01:08:31,387
because it's imitating humans.

1309
01:08:32,228 --> 01:08:34,300
- That and eating worlds.

1310
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,930
- Yeah, but you know that already.

1311
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:40,283
Me, if I eat your world,

1312
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,874
I'm gonna take you out for drinks

1313
01:08:42,874 --> 01:08:45,290
and say really nice things to you.

1314
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:48,694
And roofie you, rape you
and then eat your world.

1315
01:08:48,694 --> 01:08:50,028
- You're bonkers.

1316
01:08:50,028 --> 01:08:53,020
Yeah, but the point is that
I'm just embracing what it is

1317
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:54,774
that we've been placed on
this Earth to do, right?

1318
01:08:54,774 --> 01:08:57,758
Like be a race of giant fucking assholes

1319
01:08:57,758 --> 01:09:00,108
and just screw each other over and over

1320
01:09:00,108 --> 01:09:02,441
and get screwed over and
over on a daily basis.

1321
01:09:03,743 --> 01:09:05,822
(sighing)

1322
01:09:06,706 --> 01:09:07,676
And I can't keep up.

1323
01:09:09,928 --> 01:09:11,567
So I'm dropping out.

1324
01:09:11,567 --> 01:09:13,885
(soft music)

1325
01:09:14,746 --> 01:09:17,194
I'm gonna go home to my
mom, take care of her.

1326
01:09:19,413 --> 01:09:21,389
Get a job there, like
something with the least amount

1327
01:09:21,389 --> 01:09:23,089
of responsibility and pressure.

1328
01:09:24,438 --> 01:09:25,976
And fucking use of brain power.

1329
01:09:28,092 --> 01:09:31,564
Spend my days watching movies and

1330
01:09:31,564 --> 01:09:33,885
reading and listening to music.

1331
01:09:33,885 --> 01:09:36,379
And I'll take smoking up
and drinking again all day,

1332
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,533
until I have a heart
attack in like five years.

1333
01:09:40,387 --> 01:09:44,054
And not giving a shit about
this world or anyone in it.

1334
01:09:46,639 --> 01:09:47,899
- Except your mom.

1335
01:09:51,656 --> 01:09:52,455
No.

1336
01:09:53,282 --> 01:09:55,002
You know what I meant.

1337
01:09:55,002 --> 01:09:57,320
(soft music)

1338
01:09:59,686 --> 01:10:01,911
- I don't really give a
shit about her, either.

1339
01:10:05,514 --> 01:10:07,585
But she'll be dead soon
enough, so it's like,

1340
01:10:07,585 --> 01:10:10,190
what's a couple of weeks
of taking care of her?

1341
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:12,344
(soft music)

1342
01:10:12,344 --> 01:10:14,241
It was her last wish to see
my sister and me together,

1343
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:16,351
so it's like literally
the least I could do.

1344
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:22,288
- You mean, you guys made up or?

1345
01:10:22,288 --> 01:10:23,650
- No.

1346
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:24,449
No.

1347
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,079
No.

1348
01:10:27,582 --> 01:10:29,471
I shot her in the face.

1349
01:10:29,471 --> 01:10:30,996
She's in the trunk of my car.

1350
01:10:30,996 --> 01:10:33,835
(laughing)

1351
01:10:33,835 --> 01:10:34,634
It's true.

1352
01:10:37,642 --> 01:10:38,441
- Sure.

1353
01:10:39,464 --> 01:10:40,327
- [Max] It's true.

1354
01:10:42,306 --> 01:10:45,364
(door creaking)

1355
01:10:45,364 --> 01:10:47,818
(gun firing)

1356
01:10:47,818 --> 01:10:48,901
I went to her fucking monster-in-training

1357
01:10:48,901 --> 01:10:52,028
one-bedroom apartment
and knocked on the door,

1358
01:10:52,028 --> 01:10:54,064
and when she opened it, I
fucking shot her in the face.

1359
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,558
(soft music)

1360
01:10:58,541 --> 01:10:59,889
What?

1361
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:02,943
It was like putting down
a lame animal, okay.

1362
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:05,234
She wasn't helping anyone.

1363
01:11:05,234 --> 01:11:07,420
She wasn't bettering society.

1364
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,888
She was just like taking up space,

1365
01:11:08,888 --> 01:11:10,902
you know, both mentally and physically, so

1366
01:11:12,235 --> 01:11:14,098
two problems with one bullet.

1367
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:16,592
Well two, okay.

1368
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:20,840
I shot her in the pussy too,
just for the hell of it.

1369
01:11:22,419 --> 01:11:25,615
(upbeat dramatic music)

1370
01:11:33,398 --> 01:11:35,677
(gun firing)

1371
01:11:35,677 --> 01:11:38,874
(upbeat dramatic music)

1372
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,132
- I need a cigarette.

1373
01:11:44,132 --> 01:11:47,329
(upbeat dramatic music)

1374
01:11:55,487 --> 01:11:58,077
- Exterior, night.

1375
01:11:58,077 --> 01:11:59,288
Rooftop balcony.

1376
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:03,657
Strung lights give off a warm Cali,

1377
01:12:03,657 --> 01:12:05,157
living the good life vibe.

1378
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:07,504
But there's anything but that

1379
01:12:07,504 --> 01:12:10,038
as Megan fires up a cigarette.

1380
01:12:10,038 --> 01:12:12,356
(soft music)

1381
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:16,300
(traffic passing)

1382
01:12:26,129 --> 01:12:26,928
- Megan?

1383
01:12:32,334 --> 01:12:33,496
You all right?

1384
01:12:33,496 --> 01:12:35,815
(soft music)

1385
01:12:38,155 --> 01:12:38,954
Megan?

1386
01:12:40,975 --> 01:12:42,030
- Can you get out now?

1387
01:12:46,603 --> 01:12:47,403
- That night,

1388
01:12:49,549 --> 01:12:51,805
you never gave me a chance
to apologize to you.

1389
01:12:52,883 --> 01:12:55,610
I mean, it probably wouldn't
have made it better, but

1390
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:56,693
after how long we've been together,

1391
01:12:56,693 --> 01:12:58,324
you at least owe me that courtesy.

1392
01:13:00,913 --> 01:13:02,566
- I don't owe you anything, Max.

1393
01:13:05,286 --> 01:13:07,284
- [Max] Well I'm not
leaving until you do, so.

1394
01:13:08,112 --> 01:13:09,008
- Oh no?

1395
01:13:09,008 --> 01:13:11,600
All right, how about if
I call the cops then?

1396
01:13:12,754 --> 01:13:15,021
(Max chuckles)

1397
01:13:15,021 --> 01:13:16,759
- [Max] Maybe I still have a gun then.

1398
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:19,425
- Threats?

1399
01:13:21,456 --> 01:13:25,535
Fuck your threats, fuck
your gun and fuck you.

1400
01:13:26,721 --> 01:13:27,520
That night,

1401
01:13:29,467 --> 01:13:31,145
you told the cops I hit you, right?

1402
01:13:32,172 --> 01:13:34,889
(traffic passing)

1403
01:13:41,663 --> 01:13:43,725
No, no, mm-mm.

1404
01:13:43,725 --> 01:13:45,048
You don't get to do that.

1405
01:13:45,048 --> 01:13:47,945
Okay, you asked the question,
all right, so let's go.

1406
01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:49,952
Let's do this. Let's hash it out.

1407
01:13:54,236 --> 01:13:55,035
I'm waiting.

1408
01:13:55,035 --> 01:13:57,353
- Yeah, yeah, I fucking told
the cops that you hit me.

1409
01:13:58,379 --> 01:14:00,808
But I dropped the charges
as soon as you were gone.

1410
01:14:01,753 --> 01:14:03,239
- That was awfully nice of you.

1411
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:07,100
I still had to stay in
the drunk tank overnight,

1412
01:14:08,764 --> 01:14:11,022
which did give me a lot of time to think.

1413
01:14:13,091 --> 01:14:17,130
And I've never felt
more alone, or betrayed,

1414
01:14:18,017 --> 01:14:18,915
in my entire life.

1415
01:14:21,348 --> 01:14:24,561
Sitting in that smelly metal
box, bawling my eyes out,

1416
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:26,412
snot running in my mouth,
blubbering to myself

1417
01:14:26,412 --> 01:14:27,796
about how much you hurt me.

1418
01:14:29,749 --> 01:14:30,567
Pathetic, right?

1419
01:14:31,562 --> 01:14:33,394
- I know that I hurt you, Meg,

1420
01:14:33,394 --> 01:14:34,928
but you were out of control, okay,

1421
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:36,290
and I'd had too much to drink.

1422
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:37,226
I wasn't even thinking straight.

1423
01:14:37,226 --> 01:14:38,504
- Cut that shit.

1424
01:14:40,097 --> 01:14:41,688
That shouldn't matter.

1425
01:14:41,688 --> 01:14:44,005
(soft music)

1426
01:14:47,242 --> 01:14:51,989
So, after about three
hours and losing most

1427
01:14:51,989 --> 01:14:54,879
of my bodily fluids, I calmed myself down,

1428
01:14:56,084 --> 01:15:00,489
and I realized that you would
never truly have my back.

1429
01:15:02,174 --> 01:15:02,973
Ever.

1430
01:15:04,275 --> 01:15:06,912
And I would never feel
completely comfortable with you.

1431
01:15:08,245 --> 01:15:10,163
I'd always be just a little bit guarded.

1432
01:15:12,023 --> 01:15:14,031
And I shouldn't have
that in a relationship.

1433
01:15:15,419 --> 01:15:19,159
I should be able to do
and say whatever I want

1434
01:15:19,159 --> 01:15:21,469
and know that you would have my back.

1435
01:15:21,469 --> 01:15:25,019
Even if I'm wrong, you
should have my fucking back.

1436
01:15:25,019 --> 01:15:25,948
- Within reason.

1437
01:15:25,948 --> 01:15:29,948
- No, no, I, I should be able to fucking,

1438
01:15:29,948 --> 01:15:32,335
to fucking walk down
the street in blackface

1439
01:15:32,335 --> 01:15:36,348
and quoting Mein Kampf, and you
should have my fucking back.

1440
01:15:38,304 --> 01:15:39,969
You know, I don't think
it's that crazy for someone

1441
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:41,840
who you truly believe is your soulmate.

1442
01:15:43,091 --> 01:15:45,409
(soft music)

1443
01:15:46,357 --> 01:15:47,603
- Now who's talking crazy?

1444
01:15:50,969 --> 01:15:52,928
- All right, so how about this?

1445
01:15:52,928 --> 01:15:55,171
I don't think it's too much to ask

1446
01:15:55,171 --> 01:15:57,904
for your girlfriend of over 10 years

1447
01:15:57,904 --> 01:15:59,880
to not call the cops on you for something

1448
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,571
that you didn't even fucking do.

1449
01:16:02,477 --> 01:16:04,795
(soft music)

1450
01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:12,925
Looking back now, I wish
I woulda knocked you out.

1451
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:16,011
Least it woulda been worth it then.

1452
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:22,065
- And we're back at the infamous night.

1453
01:16:24,287 --> 01:16:28,228
Max walks away from Megan,
who's hot on her heels,

1454
01:16:28,228 --> 01:16:29,680
swinging them panties around.

1455
01:16:32,209 --> 01:16:34,990
- Yeah, run away like you
always do, like a fucking pussy!

1456
01:16:35,937 --> 01:16:37,752
- Oh, you wanna see a fucking pussy?

1457
01:16:37,752 --> 01:16:40,431
- Hell yeah, think fast.

1458
01:16:40,431 --> 01:16:42,589
(laughing)

1459
01:16:44,574 --> 01:16:46,978
Oh my, Max, are you okay?

1460
01:16:46,978 --> 01:16:49,376
- Stop, you're fucking insane.

1461
01:16:52,267 --> 01:16:54,825
- Max (laughs).

1462
01:16:56,013 --> 01:16:57,013
Max, come on.

1463
01:16:58,190 --> 01:16:58,987
I'm sorry.

1464
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:09,250
Max, come on, please.

1465
01:17:10,734 --> 01:17:11,898
Open the door.

1466
01:17:11,898 --> 01:17:14,217
(soft music)

1467
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:23,549
- Over your fucking pride.

1468
01:17:23,549 --> 01:17:25,867
(soft music)

1469
01:17:32,443 --> 01:17:33,827
- Meg.

1470
01:17:33,827 --> 01:17:34,626
- Oh my God.

1471
01:17:36,513 --> 01:17:39,264
Meg doesn't exist.

1472
01:17:39,264 --> 01:17:40,800
Okay?

1473
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,085
Megan works at Whole Foods.

1474
01:17:44,415 --> 01:17:47,929
Meg was a struggling actress

1475
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:50,782
living with a crappy writer

1476
01:17:50,782 --> 01:17:53,404
who delivered drugs and
bellyached all damn day.

1477
01:17:54,869 --> 01:17:57,823
Megan works her shifts,

1478
01:17:57,823 --> 01:17:59,654
comes home and drinks alone

1479
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:03,615
with the comfort of the
knowledge that when she dies

1480
01:18:03,615 --> 01:18:08,411
she will have led a pitiful
and unassuming existence.

1481
01:18:08,602 --> 01:18:11,786
But as long as she has her
vodka and her prescription card,

1482
01:18:11,786 --> 01:18:13,225
she won't make a fuss no more.

1483
01:18:14,258 --> 01:18:16,576
(soft music)

1484
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:23,089
No, don't.

1485
01:18:23,089 --> 01:18:25,407
(soft music)

1486
01:18:28,763 --> 01:18:31,041
(Max sobbing)

1487
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:33,360
(soft music)

1488
01:19:01,469 --> 01:19:04,268
(knocking on door)

1489
01:19:05,895 --> 01:19:06,952
Did you forget something?

1490
01:19:08,449 --> 01:19:09,549
Who the hell are you?

1491
01:19:09,549 --> 01:19:10,348
- [Joey] Max.

1492
01:19:11,688 --> 01:19:12,928
- [Megan] She just left.

1493
01:19:13,951 --> 01:19:16,688
You probably walked right past her.

1494
01:19:17,842 --> 01:19:19,357
You guys aren't too bright, are you?

1495
01:19:19,357 --> 01:19:20,208
(sword unsheathing)

1496
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:21,422
What the hell?

1497
01:19:21,422 --> 01:19:23,150
I don't know where she is.

1498
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:24,858
I don't know anything.

1499
01:19:24,858 --> 01:19:28,934
(sword striking and body thudding)

1500
01:19:32,202 --> 01:19:34,475
- Interior, rest stop bathroom.

1501
01:19:34,475 --> 01:19:36,996
Welcome to colorful Colorado.

1502
01:19:36,996 --> 01:19:38,818
It's looking to be another hot fucking day

1503
01:19:38,818 --> 01:19:41,150
because the sun is a jerk.

1504
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:43,609
Max pisses, forever.

1505
01:19:43,609 --> 01:19:46,008
(urine flowing)

1506
01:19:46,008 --> 01:19:48,341
(soft music)

1507
01:19:48,341 --> 01:19:50,898
(urine flowing)

1508
01:20:09,757 --> 01:20:12,297
(urine stopping)

1509
01:20:12,297 --> 01:20:14,615
(soft music)

1510
01:21:16,727 --> 01:21:17,526
- Oh yeah.

1511
01:21:20,564 --> 01:21:22,236
- Exterior, rest stop.

1512
01:21:23,556 --> 01:21:25,669
Max just walked into a Samurai movie.

1513
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:29,630
(intense saxophone music)

1514
01:21:52,404 --> 01:21:53,564
- Nice sword.

1515
01:21:53,564 --> 01:21:56,281
(saxophone music)

1516
01:21:59,186 --> 01:22:01,923
(sword unsheathing)

1517
01:22:01,923 --> 01:22:04,639
(saxophone music)

1518
01:22:11,505 --> 01:22:14,027
(sword striking)

1519
01:22:14,027 --> 01:22:16,744
(saxophone music)

1520
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:24,889
(sword penetrating)

1521
01:22:24,889 --> 01:22:27,791
(blood flowing)

1522
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:30,589
(creatures crawling)

1523
01:22:42,571 --> 01:22:45,043
(creatures squealing)

1524
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,361
(soft music)

1525
01:23:03,725 --> 01:23:06,216
(creatures squealing)

1526
01:23:06,216 --> 01:23:08,534
(soft music)

1527
01:23:24,616 --> 01:23:25,415
- [Assistant] Regina.

1528
01:23:28,138 --> 01:23:31,853
Hey, Reggie, your mom's on the phone.

1529
01:23:33,374 --> 01:23:34,712
- What does she want?

1530
01:23:34,712 --> 01:23:36,927
I just sent a check for the month.

1531
01:23:39,903 --> 01:23:40,766
Hi, Mom.

1532
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:43,020
How are you doing? Everything okay?

1533
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,411
Did you get the check I sent?

1534
01:23:46,903 --> 01:23:49,465
No, I haven't heard
from her, not in years.

1535
01:23:49,465 --> 01:23:50,264
You know that.

1536
01:23:51,901 --> 01:23:53,093
Why, did she call you?

1537
01:24:01,587 --> 01:24:02,645
That is terrible.

1538
01:24:05,912 --> 01:24:07,014
How are you holding up?

1539
01:24:08,565 --> 01:24:11,350
(waves crashing)

1540
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:12,811
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1541
01:24:13,954 --> 01:24:18,118
In some ways, maybe, this is best for her.

1542
01:24:20,701 --> 01:24:23,002
Yeah, it is, it is a terrible way to go,

1543
01:24:23,002 --> 01:24:25,179
but at least maybe now she'll,

1544
01:24:25,179 --> 01:24:26,832
she'll have some sort of peace.

1545
01:24:30,443 --> 01:24:32,889
Yeah, you want me to take
care of the arrangements?

1546
01:24:36,032 --> 01:24:37,704
Yeah, of course, you want her buried

1547
01:24:37,704 --> 01:24:39,431
in the family plot back home, right?

1548
01:24:42,413 --> 01:24:44,955
Yeah, I'll get on that. I'll
take care of everything.

1549
01:24:45,981 --> 01:24:47,602
Just let me figure out what I need to do,

1550
01:24:47,602 --> 01:24:49,245
and I'll get back to you, okay?

1551
01:24:50,184 --> 01:24:52,822
(waves crashing)

1552
01:24:53,865 --> 01:24:55,612
Yeah, I'm fine.

1553
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:59,244
Yeah, I.

1554
01:24:59,244 --> 01:25:01,134
Look, just be strong.

1555
01:25:01,134 --> 01:25:04,839
I will take care of everything,
and I'll see you soon.

1556
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:07,598
Yeah, I love you too, bye.

1557
01:25:08,614 --> 01:25:10,605
- Is everything okay?

1558
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:11,404
- Ugh.

1559
01:25:13,323 --> 01:25:16,440
She called to tell me
that my sister's body

1560
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,955
was found in a rest stop bathroom

1561
01:25:17,955 --> 01:25:19,838
stabbed to death by a Samurai sword.

1562
01:25:21,465 --> 01:25:23,547
And the heads of her ex-girlfriend

1563
01:25:23,547 --> 01:25:25,639
and best friend were there too.

1564
01:25:27,373 --> 01:25:28,706
- Jesus, Reg.

1565
01:25:28,706 --> 01:25:30,538
Are, are you okay?

1566
01:25:30,538 --> 01:25:32,840
- Yeah, I'm fine. I am.

1567
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:35,528
I think. I'm fine.

1568
01:25:37,088 --> 01:25:39,601
Oh, I haven't seen or spoken to Max

1569
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:42,257
since we had a falling-out over a script.

1570
01:25:42,257 --> 01:25:43,056
- Eating Cars?

1571
01:25:43,056 --> 01:25:43,855
- Yeah.

1572
01:25:44,895 --> 01:25:46,764
She said she wrote more of it than I did,

1573
01:25:46,764 --> 01:25:49,278
and she wanted a cowriting credit

1574
01:25:49,278 --> 01:25:53,593
and for her name to be
above mine, and I said, no,

1575
01:25:53,593 --> 01:25:56,183
because in actuality she
hadn't written a single word.

1576
01:25:57,410 --> 01:26:00,271
I said I'd give her a story
credit or nothing, you know.

1577
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:03,481
She said she wanted
cowriting, and then I told her

1578
01:26:03,481 --> 01:26:06,109
to go to hell and I haven't
heard from her since.

1579
01:26:06,109 --> 01:26:07,864
- And when was that?

1580
01:26:07,864 --> 01:26:11,214
- Uh, right before I sold it.

1581
01:26:14,309 --> 01:26:16,284
You know, I tried to find her.

1582
01:26:16,284 --> 01:26:18,413
I called her, she didn't answer,

1583
01:26:18,413 --> 01:26:19,804
she changed her phone number.

1584
01:26:21,559 --> 01:26:23,276
And I haven't heard anything since.

1585
01:26:23,276 --> 01:26:24,235
- And your mother too?

1586
01:26:24,235 --> 01:26:25,597
- Yeah.

1587
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:27,476
She said, as far as she was concerned,

1588
01:26:27,476 --> 01:26:29,298
we were both out to get her,

1589
01:26:29,298 --> 01:26:31,169
and that we were both dead in her mind.

1590
01:26:33,201 --> 01:26:35,496
Yeah, Mom hasn't heard
from her since either.

1591
01:26:37,719 --> 01:26:40,136
- That is so sad.

1592
01:26:40,136 --> 01:26:40,934
I.

1593
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:46,302
- I came to terms with not
having a sibling long ago.

1594
01:26:46,302 --> 01:26:48,977
- I know, I know, but still.

1595
01:26:48,977 --> 01:26:51,614
(waves crashing)

1596
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:58,303
- What time is our lunch
meeting with Doug and Silva?

1597
01:26:59,344 --> 01:27:02,379
- 1:30. Eating Cars, the sequel.

1598
01:27:03,478 --> 01:27:05,093
Should be interesting.

1599
01:27:06,413 --> 01:27:07,270
Any ideas?

1600
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:09,639
- Maybe.

1601
01:27:12,023 --> 01:27:15,353
But, I need to get a shower.

1602
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:19,612
Join me.

1603
01:27:19,612 --> 01:27:21,931
(soft music)

1604
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:26,234
(gulls calling)

1605
01:27:26,234 --> 01:27:28,552
(soft music)

1606
01:27:42,281 --> 01:27:44,919
(gulls calling)
