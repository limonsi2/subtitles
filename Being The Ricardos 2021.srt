00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,416
I said, “Yeah,” but I did not…

172
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,041
-The sooner you stop talking…
-Yeah.

173
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,708
I think everyone's acquainted,
but let's go around. Joe.

174
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,833
Uh, Joe Strickland, CBS.

175
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,458
Howard Wenke, also CBS.

176
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,583
Roger Otter, Philip Morris.

177
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,125
Irwin Gotlieb, attorney for Desilu.

178
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,791
Sam Stein, attorney for Lucille Ball.

179
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,333
Tip Tribby, VP of Public Relations
for Philip Morris.

180
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,958
Tip, if Winchell had it cold,
he'd have used her name,

181
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,625
it would have been at the top of the show,
not the bottom,

182
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:00,000
and this morning, we'd be reading about it
on the front page of every paper.

183
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,541
-Am I right?
-Yes.

184
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,875
They don't have it.

185
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,541
Can you see where CBS might be concerned
that there's an it to have?

186
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,916
-Do you see that?
-Uh, couldn't follow you.

187
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,708
Lucy, you need to tell me right here
and now what the hell is going on.

188
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,375
You don't want to talk to my wife
like that, amigo.

189
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,750
Or what, Des, you're gonna beat me up?

190
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:14,916
Oh, she will.

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,166
So we're done with introductions?

192
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,333
I'm not a Communist,
I've never been a Communist,

193
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,125
but technically, yeah, I am.

194
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,666
JOE:
Jesus Christ.

195
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,916
Do you get what's happening here?

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,416
Do you know that this is not funny?

197
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,041
Yes, I do get what's happening,
and, yes, I know it's not funny.

198
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,250
-Lucy…
-My father died when I was very young.

199
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,083
I was raised by my mother and my
grandfather, a man named Fred C. Hunt.

200
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,291
I'd like everyone but Howard
to leave the room.

201
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,250
Philip Morris pays for the show.

202
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,833
And they get their money's worth,
so give us a minute, would you?

203
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,625
ROGER:
(sighs) She's smoking a Chesterfield.

204
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,125
Could she at least smoke one of
the seven brands Philip Morris offers?

205
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,208
-Got it. Got it.
-(door opens)

206
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,833
-Thank you.
-(sighs)

207
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,333
(Desi clears throat)

208
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,583
(door closes)

209
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,750
Fred C. Hunt, my grandfather,
was a member of the party.

210
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,208
This was in the early '30s.
I was in my early 20s.

211
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,708
He never used the word “Communist.”

212
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,500
But he cared about workers,
the working man.

213
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:09,083
He raised my little brother and me,
and I wanted to please him.

214
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,541
So I checked the box.

215
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,083
Back then, it wasn't considered much worse
than being a Republican.

216
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,166
DESI:
Hmm.

217
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,833
-HOWARD: Have you been to a meeting?
-No.

218
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:17,916
-Never?
-No.

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,916
-You were at a cocktail party,
later you found out that people… -No.

220
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,916
Have you ever subscribed
to a publication…

221
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,500
My entire relationship with Communism is,
20 years ago, I checked a box.

222
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,458
Why is this coming out now?

223
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,333
The committee investigated her
and cleared her.

224
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,833
But then last week, uh, William Wheeler
convened a special session out here,

225
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:38,750
a private session, called her in again,
and that's why we're sitting here.

226
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,000
(sighs)

227
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,500
(Howard exhales sharply)

228
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,291
And nobody's picked it up?

229
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,125
Nobody's picked up the story.

230
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,625
Not a single paper, not a single
news network, including your own.

231
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,583
Maybe.

232
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,041
Maybe we're out of this.

233
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,333
We just don't know yet.

234
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,625
When will we?

235
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:06,000
If you tape a show Friday night,
means you still have a show.

236
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,875
Okay.

237
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,583
-You and me,
-(door closes)

238
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,791
we've been through worse than this.

239
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,625
(sighs) We have?

240
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,916
No.

241
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,791
That's what I thought.

242
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,250
(Desi clears throat)

243
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,583
Hey. The whole piece
was invented out of thin air?

244
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:40,333
-Huh?
-Four pages, 1,500 words?

245
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,000
Are you being funny right now?

246
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,500
That is the second time
someone's asked me that this morning.

247
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,708
I'm Lucille Ball.
When I'm being funny, you'll know it.

248
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,333
-(chuckles)
-They invented the whole thing?

249
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,250
You don't think we got bigger fish to fry?

250
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,041
-They invented the whole thing?
-Yes, they invented the whole thing.

251
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,375
I was on the boat playing cards.

252
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,875
They invented the whole thing,
and I'm angry at them.

253
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,541
And I'll do something about it,
but right now…

254
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,625
-Got it.
-Hmm.

255
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,958
Priorities.

256
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,041
You're right.

257
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,208
Say that again. “Desi, you're right.”

258
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,875
No.

259
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,333
Everything's gonna be fine.

260
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,500
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
I won't allow it.

261
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,291
I just won't.

262
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,583
Hmm?

263
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,000
-You've never done that before.
-I know.

264
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,291
I've seen other people do it
in movies I've been in.

265
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,583
(Desi chuckles)

266
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,583
For the love of God, old man,
this isn't hard.

267
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,625
Rusty Hamer plays Rusty Williams
on The Danny Thomas Show.

268
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,500
He's in second grade,
and they made him sign a loyalty oath

269
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,875
when he signed his contract,
which I think is ugly.

270
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,708
I don't know why this is tripping you up.
It wasn't confusing.

271
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,791
There's no such thing as
The Danny Thomas Show.

272
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,583
It's called Make Room for Daddy.
Don't tell me comedy.

273
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,666
And if Little Rusty is a Communist,

274
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,875
then I'm gonna beat the shit
out of a seven-year-old kid.

275
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,708
-I have no problem with that.
-I'm done.

276
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,291
That, right there,

277
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,750
was funnier than anything
you've written so far this year.

278
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,041
(chuckles)

279
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,208
That's not…

280
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,791
-I've written plenty of funny…
-No.

281
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,250
(doors opening)

282
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,125
♪ ♪

283
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,541
Good morning!

284
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,125
Mm. Don Glass is directing this week?

285
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,083
-We'll be fine.
-(sighs)

286
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,333
You're wondering what's going on.

287
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,416
No matter what's going on,
we all support you a thousand percent.

288
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,000
I'd like to find out what's going on
before I make that commitment.

289
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:42,208
A long time ago, Lucy accidentally checked
the wrong box on her voter registration.

290
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,500
That's the first act
of a new episode right there.

291
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,916
-Yeah, “Lucy Gets Blacklisted.”
-That's not a joke, Bob.

292
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You made the joke.
I just put the button…

293
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,916
Last week, she testified
in a closed session.

294
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,750
-She was cleared.
-Okay.

295
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,041
Yeah? She was cleared.

296
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,708
So I don't know where Winchell
got his information, but it was wrong.

297
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,083
As you can see, it was not picked up
by any newspaper.

298
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,416
So let's do our show.

299
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,333
Jess, it's your stage.

300
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,583
(clears throat)

301
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,208
I Love Lucy , episode 204.

302
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,458
Season two, episode four.

303
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,208
“Ethel and Fred Fight.”

304
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,916
Teleplay by Bob Carroll,
Madelyn Pugh and myself.

305
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,500
Took three of you to write this one?

306
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,500
Okay, come on. And directing this week,
Donald Glass is back with us.

307
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,875
-Let's give him a hand. -(applause)
-Hey, thanks. It's good to be back.

308
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,291
JESS: Act one, “Interior,
the Ricardo's living room, night.”

309
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,208
Excuse me. Donald.

310
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,166
-Y-Yes?
-Good morning. I'm Lucille Ball.

311
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,875
I sure know that, Lucy.

312
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,208
I wanted to make sure
because you haven't been here in a while.

313
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,916
Is it because you've been
going through puberty?

314
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,250
I look young, yes,
but I went through it a long time ago,

315
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,083
and I haven't been here because
I've been directing at Danny Thomas.

316
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,833
WILLIAM:
With the Communist kid?

317
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,083
-Fuck off.
-Jesus Christ.

318
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,541
LUCILLE:
You don't have to fuck off,

319
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,166
but you do need to know that Danny
does jokes– few people do it better.

320
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,958
I do physical comedy.

321
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,541
-I've seen every episode of the show.
-So have 60 million other people.

322
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,666
Are none of them
professional television directors?

323
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,666
DESI:
(chuckles) She's kidding.

324
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,833
-I can tell.
-Ah.

325
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,041
LUCILLE:
I'm hazing you a little, Donald.

326
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,541
It's just my way of saying
I have no confidence in you at all.

327
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,833
(laughs) All right, all right, all right.

328
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,583
We haven't gotten off
to a great start this morning, I think.

329
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,791
And I have no idea what the fuck
you were talking about, Bill.

330
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,875
Ah, Des, I'm begging you, don't ask.

331
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,083
All right, no problem.

332
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,333
I just wanted to say that this show
is made by Desilu Productions,

333
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,958
whose president
is speaking to you right now.

334
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:24,208
And for the next 30 minutes, I don't want
to hear a word that is not in this script.

335
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,708
-It's your stage.
-JESS: Thank you.

336
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,625
“Lucy's putting the finishing touches
on a fancy dinner table–

337
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,458
good china, silver, et cetera.”

338
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,083
Uh, the table is set for four
but there are only three chairs.

339
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,791
-I-I should've put that in the,
in the stage direction. -JESS: Okay.

340
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,625
Well, technically, it's two chairs
and a piano bench.

341
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,875
For a total of?

342
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,291
Three chairs.

343
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,333
JESS: “Lucy's putting the finishing
touches on a fancy dinner table–

344
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,875
good china, silver, et cetera.”

345
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,791
Table's set for four
but there's only three chairs.

346
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:48,958
“After a moment,

347
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,375
“the door opens and Ricky enters.

348
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,750
“Lucy doesn't hear him.

349
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:53,791
“Ricky tiptoes in back of her.

350
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,791
-Ricky puts his…”
-Why not?

351
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,750
Sorry?

352
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,375
Why doesn't Lucy hear him?

353
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,708
Well, he's about to do that thing
where you cover someone's eyes

354
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:02,791
and you say, “Guess who.”

355
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,083
I understand it's a setup.

356
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,166
I understand

357
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,875
why we need Lucy to not hear him.

358
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,000
I just don't understand why, in an
apartment this size, Lucy doesn't hear–

359
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:15,458
or, for that matter, see– the front door
open when she's standing 12 feet from it.

360
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,791
We'll work on that.

361
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:20,916
Thanks.

362
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,833
“Ricky tiptoes in back of her
and reaches around

363
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,666
and covers her eyes with his hands.”

364
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,750
RICKY:
Guess who it is.

365
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,625
LUCY:
Bill? Pat?

366
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,625
-Sam?
-No.

367
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,458
-Ralph?
-JESS: “Ricky reacts to this.”

368
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,958
No, it's me.

369
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,750
Oh, yes, of course.

370
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,166
Oh, hang on.

371
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,291
Are we supposed to believe
that Ricky believes that Lucy

372
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,166
-really doesn't know it's him?
-Want to do this now?

373
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,541
That Ricky believes that Lucy is
not only unfamiliar with his voice–

374
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,125
which, let's not forget,
has a Cuban accent–

375
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,666
but that he really believes
there are at least seven other men

376
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,000
who routinely walk into their apartment?

377
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,000
DESI (chuckles):
She has a pretty good point.

378
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,041
-She has four or five pretty good points.
-JESS: All right.

379
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,125
W-We'll write a better joke
or Ricky will know that Lucy's joking.

380
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,541
-Ah.
-BOB: We can change the names.

381
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,208
-Pedro, Pablo, Jose.
-What?

382
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,375
Because they're Spanish names.

383
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,166
I mean Latin names.

384
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,666
They're Cuban names.

385
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,416
(sighs) Thanks for
clearing that up, professor.

386
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,375
-I'm just, you know…
-JESS: Okay, “Ricky takes his hands away

387
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,625
and turns her around.”

388
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,916
-No, it's me.
-Oh, yes, of course.

389
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,833
-Uh, uh…
-JESS: “She snaps her fingers

390
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,041
-and pretends she can't remember
his name.” -(fingers snapping)

391
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,083
-Very funny.
-“Ricky kisses her

392
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,291
and then notices the table setup.”

393
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,583
Hey, company for dinner?

394
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,958
-Uh-huh.
-Who is it?

395
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,583
JESS:
“Lucy elaborately ignores him.”

396
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,166
LUCY: How do you like
the new water glasses, Ricky?

397
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,375
RICKY:
Who's coming for dinner, Lucy?

398
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,875
Doesn't the table look beautiful tonight?

399
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,083
Lucy, who is it?

400
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,708
Some people.

401
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:37,958
(audience laughter)

402
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,541
RICKY (annoyed):
Lucy…

403
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,333
Whom is coming here for dinner tonight?

404
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,083
Whom? You mean besides “meem” and “youm”?

405
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,000
(laughter)

406
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,708
RICKY:
Never mind that. What are their names?

407
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,750
-Fred and Ethel Mertz.
-Wait a minute.

408
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,750
I thought you said Fred and Ethel had a
big fight and they were mad at each other.

409
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:57,916
-They are.
-(audience laughter)

410
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,708
RICKY: I thought you said
they weren't speaking to each other.

411
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,250
-They aren't.
-(audience laughter)

412
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,625
-And that he was staying at the Y.
-He is.

413
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,083
-And that she won't let him in the house.
-She won't.

414
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:11,041
Well, if they are and they aren't
and he is and she won't, how come?

415
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,708
Well…

416
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,541
Lucy Esmeralda McGillicuddy Ricardo.

417
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,875
Oh…

418
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,458
That's nice, but is the rhythm
getting old too early?

419
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,750
We'll work on that.

420
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,625
'Cause we want to live up to the quality
of the writing you were used to at RKO.

421
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,458
-That was gutsy.
-That was…

422
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:33,958
(chuckles) It was a joke about
the writing at RKO and not…

423
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,708
Yeah?

424
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,750
Obviously not an insult aimed at Lucy.

425
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,708
♪ ♪

426
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,791
Looking back, it may have been
an insult aimed at Lucy.

427
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,750
Which was very unusual.

428
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,125
Lucy and I were close.

429
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,708
-(laughs)
-JESS: Okay, let's take it from…

430
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,458
OLDER MADELYN:
Look, she was always tough on the writing,

431
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,333
she pressed down hard on each beat,

432
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,791
but that week…

433
00:17:55,875 --> 00:18:00,083
it was like her life depended on
whether a joke was a “B” or “B”-plus.

434
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,875
JESS: “She tries to make her way past him
on her way to the kitchen,

435
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,125
but he holds out his hand
and blocks the way.”

436
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,458
OLDER BOB:
There was a Broadway show

437
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,625
called Too Many Girls.

438
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,833
It was terrible.

439
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,791
One of the stars of
Too Many Girls was Desi.

440
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,041
Too Many Girls.

441
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:18,625
RKO decided to make
a very bad Broadway show into–

442
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:22,041
and I still can't believe it–
an even worse movie.

443
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,541
They kept Desi in the cast,
but the second female lead was replaced

444
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,333
by the queen of the “B” movies,
Lucille Ball.

445
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,166
A couple of days before shooting started,

446
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,791
Desi was on a soundstage working with
a piano and a drum and Ann Miller.

447
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,166
Here's what you have to understand.

448
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,041
A more handsome, charming man than Desi
you've never met.

449
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,708
Standing off, away from
the pack of chorus girls, is Lucy,

450
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,208
who was unrecognizable because
she was still in the middle of shooting

451
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,791
Dance, Girl, Dance,
playing a burlesque girl

452
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,541
who'd just been beaten up by her pimp.

453
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,333
So she was… unrecognizable.

454
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,083
That's how they met.

455
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,750

-Yes.

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,375
I'm Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha III,
but just my mother calls me that.

480
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,833
-Desi. Desi.
-I'm Angie.

481
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,083
I'm in the chorus and I wanted to say
I'm looking forward to working with you.

482
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,958
-I'm looking forward, too, Angie.
-(laughs)

483
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,750
-Patty.
-Patty.

484
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,750
-Uh, short for Patricia?
-Yes.

485
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,583
-DESI: Also in the chorus?
-Mm-hmm. Dancing chorus.

-Oh. -LUCILLE: “Do you remember
the first time we met?

487
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,833
You were rudely attentive,
but now you're obnoxiously indifferent.”

488
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,625
What?

489
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,625
It's a line from our movie, dumb-dumb.

490
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,583
Do we know each other?

00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,625
(audience laughter)

853
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,000
(audience laughter)

854
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,000
(footsteps squishing)

855
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:41,375
(audience laughter continues)

856
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:48,958
What can happen in the vat of grapes?
What can she do?

857
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:52,125
-(audience whispering)
-(man in audience clears throat)

858
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,166
JESS:
It doesn't matter right now.

859
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:59,333
We need to get back to–
Des, the network isn't gonna allow it

860
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:01,125
and neither will Philip Morris. Lucy…

861
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:02,833
Just hang on.

862
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:04,916
(audience whispering)

863
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,791
-She loses an earring.
-BOB: Yes.

864
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:10,958
-MADELYN: There it is.
-What are you talking about?

865
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,083
In the grapes.

866
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,625
(audience laughter)

867
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,875
(audience laughter continues)

868
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:26,791
(laughter grows)

869
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:34,208
Push it to next year.

870
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:36,083
They're not going to Italy
while she's pregnant.

871
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:38,458
I'll bet you my next paycheck
against your next paycheck

872
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:40,708
that CBS won't even allow us
to use the word “pregnant.”

873
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:43,750
-“Lucy Tells the Truth.”
-BOB: That one's Madelyn's idea.

874
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:46,375
-She got it just seconds after
I pitched it. -Folks…

875
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:49,166
MADELYN: Ricky bets Lucy
that she can't go two days without lying,

876
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,000
and we put her in situations
where it's hard not to lie.

877
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,000
LUCY:
Okay, it's started.

878
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,750
For the next 48 hours.

879
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,208
-Okay.
-All right.

880
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:58,833
ETHEL: I can hardly wait
to hear you tomorrow afternoon, Lucy.

881
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,000
LUCY:
Why?

882
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,500
We're playing bridge
at Carolyn's, remember?

883
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:04,125
Oh, no, no, no.

884
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,833
I can't spend the afternoon

885
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:07,583
with three women
and have to tell the truth.

886
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:10,750
-(audience laughter)
-I'll call Carolyn and tell her I'm sick.

887
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:14,416
MADELYN:
After 47 hours,

888
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,958
-she's winning, but in the final hour…
-BOB: Here it is.

889
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:19,458
MADELYN: …Ricky gets a visit from
the IRS, and the guy wants to ask about

890
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:22,416
some questionable things
that Ricky's claiming on his deductions.

891
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,166
Lucy's sitting in the living room, too,
and of course when she's asked

892
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,041
by the IRS agent to corroborate,
she can't tell a lie, so…

893
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:29,333
That's a funny premise.

894
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:30,750
Yes, it is.

895
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,458
But lose the IRS scene.

896
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:33,833
-Could be a good scene.
-He's correct.

897
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:35,083
Once I write it, it could be good.

898
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,833
Ah, Ricky Ricardo loves America.

899
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,208
He loves being an American.

900
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:40,083
He's grateful to this country.

901
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:41,416
He'd never cheat on his taxes.

902
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,125
-It's very relatable. Everybody does.
-I don't! Neither does Ricky.

903
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:47,000
Especially when his wife is accused
of being un-American.

904
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:50,708
Look for something else, and
start working on the first pregnancy show.

905
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,125
-Listen to me.
-What?

906
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:53,791
They're not gonna let us do it.

907
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:56,583
-Let that be my problem.
-Oh, I wish I could, Des,

908
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:58,458
but it's very much my problem, okay?

909
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:01,750
So instead of talking about
goddamn grapes, why don't…

910
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,583
Look, what you got to understand is this.

911
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:06,250
-We don't know…
-Jess, they're free to take us off the air

912
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:09,375
for the rest of the year
while continuing to pay our contracts

913
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:12,083
and answering questions about
why motherhood is too salacious

914
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:16,041
to put on CBS, but something tells me
they're not gonna go that route.

915
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:19,750
Instead, I think Broadcast Standards
and Practices will give you

916
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:22,666
a list of insane restrictions,
which might even include

917
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,791
you winning your bet with Desi,
and which I have no doubt

918
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:28,375
the three of you
will navigate beautifully.

919
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:29,583
You told me to be nice.

920
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:31,541
Good?

921
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,125
Yeah.

922
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:35,208
(phone ringing in distance)

923
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:42,083
I don't care what your first thoughts
out of the gate were,

924
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:45,208
but your first words out of the gate
were no good.

925
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:47,291
And what was with you at the table read?

926
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,833
I'm sorry. She was jumping
on every stage direction.

927
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:51,958
It's her process.

928
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:54,500
-But that process usually happens
in private. -BOB: Yes.

929
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,791
And following your advice,
maybe every once in a while,

930
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:59,916
the first words out of her mouth
could be “good script.”

931
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,041
Well, is this the right week
for this shit?

932
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:06,500
-Hey.
-We do seem to be having some success, no?

933
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:09,208
We're all really tired from
working on this week's script.

934
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:11,291
Oh, are you sleepy? You need a nap?

935
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:13,166
-Can I talk to you for a second, boss?
-Sure.

936
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:21,791
I'm the executive producer of this show.

937
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:23,833
You can't manhandle me like that
in front of other people.

938
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,458
You just can't do it. My show.

939
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:26,916
And Madelyn was a hundred percent right.

940
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,916
-Ricky pays his taxes.
-I get it.

941
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,041
And we're having the baby on the show.

942
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:33,125
There's no chance they say yes.

943
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,875
There's no chance they say yes to you.

944
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,458
Did you get all that?

945
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:44,458
Yes.

946
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:46,125
That was a joke.

947
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:49,416
DONALD:
Back to right before Vivian's entrance.

948
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,166
“When do we eat?”

949
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,333
Settle. And action.

950
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:55,875
Uh, when do we eat?

951
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:58,083
I've been living on
peanut butter sandwiches.

952
00:41:58,166 --> 00:42:00,166
DONALD: Bill, that line's
got to take you over to the table.

953
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,833
-Hmm?
-You need to cross to the table on that.

954
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:03,166
Why?

955
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,666
-Because we need to…
-LUCILLE: So you can see the table,

956
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,666
notice that a fourth place is set
and say your next line.

957
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:11,791
Uh, someone else coming?

958
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:16,250
Well, Fred, I took the liberty of asking
a young lady to be your dinner companion.

959
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,500
-A young lady?
-A cute young chick.

960
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:21,041
-Oh, boy, bring her on.
-Uh-uh.

961
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:22,625
-Hang on.
-What?

962
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:24,916
LUCILLE:
When I say, “I took the liberty of asking

963
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,833
-a young lady to be
your dinner companion…” -Mm-hmm.

964
00:42:26,916 --> 00:42:30,375
…Ricky should take a sip from a glass of
water on the table to keep from laughing.

965
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,083
-And then when I say,
“A cute young chick…” -Uh-huh.

966
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,541
…he should choke on his water a little.

967
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:35,375
-I like that.
-I like it, too.

968
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:39,416
The very idea that Ethel's
a cute young chick should make Desi choke.

969
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,708
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
That's 15.

970
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:44,916
-Okay.
-That's 15 minutes!

971
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,416
(indistinct chatter)

972
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,708
I'll be funny by Friday.

973
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:50,458
And when can we expect you to be funny?

974
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,416
-(door closes)
-“Exactly what makes a husband leave home

975
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,958
-is something that has been baffling wives
since Adam and Eve.” -Enough.

976
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:14,500
“For an outstanding example, let's take
one of the nation's most famous husbands.”

977
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:17,083
-You've memorized it?
-I've memorized worse writing than this.

978
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:19,708
-Yes, it's a tabloid.
-“With a curvy, red-haired tidbit

979
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:24,333
like Lucy waiting for him at home,
would Desi be foolish enough…”

980
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:27,083
-Stop it. -”…to prowl Hollywood
like a bachelor wolf?

981
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:29,166
-If so, why?”
-It's made up.

982
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,375
-20 million readers want to know.
-Lucy…

983
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:34,625
-20 million and one.
-How many times

984
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:37,708
I got to 'splain where I was
and what I was doing?

985
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:39,833
How many times you got to 'splain?

986
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:42,291
(chuckles)
I can't get enough of that joke.

987
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,125
They document an entire night.

988
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,083
Someone in your gang's a rat.

989
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,166
My gang.

990
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,875
(scoffs)

991
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:53,500
The night they're talking about,
I was with Red Skelton and Xavier Cugat.

992
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:56,708
-Which one of them you think squealed?
-They made it up from nothing?

993
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:58,958
I heard on Winchell the other night
that you were a Communist.

994
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,083
That was true, you idiot!

995
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:03,083
Yeah. That was a bad example.

996
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,666
And I didn't check the wrong box.

997
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,750
Okay, I'm sorry about that.

998
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:11,416
I believe you.

999
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,583
-I'm just messing around.
-Good.

1000
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:18,000
No. That gets you out of the woods,
but it puts you into other woods.

1001
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:19,250
What are the other woods?

1002
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:21,375
You don't come home anymore.
Did you know that?

1003
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,791
-You change subjects faster than…
-Keep up.

1004
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:25,166
It's not hard.

1005
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,416
I asked, “Did you know
you don't come home anymore?”

1006
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,833
Of course I come home.

1007
00:44:29,916 --> 00:44:32,750
Sometimes I go to the boat and play cards.

1008
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:35,875
We drink, it goes late,
it's easier to sleep on the boat.

1009
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:39,375
That used to be once a week, then twice.

1010
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:41,875
Now it's four or five times.

1011
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,125
I go home after work, you go to the boat.

1012
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:50,208
You once asked me what my ambition was.

1013
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:51,291
You remember?

1014
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:53,666
Mm-hmm.

1015
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,750
And you liked my answer.

1016
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,458
She used the word “home” a lot.

1017
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:04,000
She talked about having a home.

They eloped.

1021
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:15,625
They bought a ranch in Chatsworth.

1022
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:19,833
They were deeply in love
and deliriously happy.

1023
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:23,625
What you got to understand is
they weren't very happy.

1024
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,458
They never saw each other.

1354
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,291
French toast, bacon and potatoes.

1355
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:08,875
She said that someone noticed
I hadn't had breakfast.

1356
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:10,541
She said it looked like
I had lost some weight.

1357
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:12,041
She's right. You look great.

1358
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:15,041
Madelyn's a staff writer.
She doesn't bring people their breakfast.

1359
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:18,375
I'm not sure what you're asking.

1360
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:19,583
It sounds like she was…

1361
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:22,083
How would she know I hadn't had breakfast?

1362
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,625
I really don't know.

1363
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:28,708
-It was you, right?
-Yeah.

1364
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:31,416
Got to give me credit.
When I lie, I give it up pretty quick.

1365
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,000
-It's admirable.
-Thanks.

1366
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:38,750
You told her to bring me breakfast
and remark on my weight loss.

1367
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:40,916
Let me explain why.

1368
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,166
Why?

1369
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:44,250
Because I think you should
get off this loony diet you're on.

1370
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:45,416
It's working.

1371
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,916
It's not good for you.

1372
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,125
I feel great.

1373
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:49,875
It's not good for Ethel.

1374
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:51,750
Ah, it's not.

1375
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:54,250
We're best friends, Viv.
I don't want to fight.

1376
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:56,041
-I just sent some breakfast over
because… -You didn't just send it over.

1377
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,375
You sent it over
with Madelyn and a message

1378
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:01,958
and now a new message,
which is that I look too good.

1379
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:05,000
Because we want you at the weight
you were when we cast you.

1380
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:06,375
Otherwise it'll be bad for Ethel?

1381
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:07,708
-Yes.
-Or bad for you?

1382
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:12,791
All right.

1383
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,875
No one's gonna stop loving Lucy
when you're pregnant.

1384
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:16,291
You're not a pinup girl.

1385
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:19,416
Thanks for that, Viv.

1386
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,041
VIVIAN:
I'm saying take it easy, that's all.

1387
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:25,708
Everyone here stands shoulder to shoulder
with you and no one feels funny

1388
01:00:25,791 --> 01:00:28,208
'cause we're scared to death,
and you're not helping

1389
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,708
by jumping up and down
on everyone who works here

1390
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:32,500
and doing it in front of the whole crew!

1391
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:35,791
Goddamn it, Viv,
most American women look like you, not me.

1392
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:38,041
They want to see themselves on television.

1393
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:45,166
(door opens)

1394
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:50,458
What the hell are the two of you
screaming about?

1395
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:52,333
-LUCILLE: Nothing.
-Nothing!

1396
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:54,583
I'm in my room taking my midmorning nap.

1397
01:00:54,666 --> 01:00:57,291
VIVIAN: Don't you usually do that
while we're rehearsing?

1398
01:00:58,291 --> 01:01:01,416
I'd love to hear more of that
Moss Hart wit on the show.

1399
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:10,791
VIVIAN:
Don't worry about it.

1400
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,583
The weight always comes back.
I can't keep it off anymore.

1401
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:17,333
This conversation went poorly.

1402
01:01:17,416 --> 01:01:19,333
I thought it was great.

1403
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:23,916
I definitely feel like performing
for tens of millions of people now.

1404
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,083
All right.

1405
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:29,875
-So…
-(page turns)

1406
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:31,375
Okay.

1407
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:34,375
(thunder rumbling softly)

1408
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:38,958
-Lucille.
-Yeah?

1409
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:42,125
Come with me for a drink.

1410
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:43,625
It's 10:00 a.m.

1411
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:45,500
I'm sure it's 10:15 somewhere.

1412
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:47,250
We have to be back onstage.

1413
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:49,041
-I wonder if they'll wait for you.
-Bill, I'm not…

1414
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:50,291
Kid.

1415
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:52,666
Tell the stage Mrs. Arnaz is
taking some personal time

1416
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,125
and she'll be back when she's back.

1417
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:56,375
-Probably 15 minutes.
-Yes, ma'am.

1418
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:59,041
And you should remind props that I need
garden shears in the opening scene.

1419
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:00,541
-Copy.
-WILLIAM: Let's go.

1420
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:02,833
We have to establish right away
that I'm setting a fancy table.

1421
01:02:02,916 --> 01:02:04,708
-You don't have to explain it to him.
-We'll have flowers in a vase.

1422
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:06,291
I'll cut one of the flowers.

1423
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:08,291
-He doesn't care.
-It'll be too short.

1424
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:10,333
I'll cut the other flowers,
they'll be too short, and so on.

1425
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:11,875
-Got it.
-So I need garden shears.

1426
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:12,958
Copy.

1427
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:15,250
Regular scissors aren't strong enough
to cut through the stems.

1428
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:17,208
He's thinking a lot about killing you now.

1429
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:18,291
-Fine.
-Go.

1430
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:20,000
Yep.

1431
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:21,708
(rain falling)

1432
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:23,291
It's raining.

1433
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:24,583
-Your hair gonna be all right?
-(thunder rumbling)

1434
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:26,041
I'm fine.

1435
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:30,250
Ever since I started doing this show,
rain bounces off my hair.

1436
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,166
-That's helpful.
-Mm.

1437
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,958
Honestly had no idea this place was here.

1438
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:37,625
WILLIAM:
They like to keep a low profile.

1439
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:39,791
LUCILLE:
Can't imagine why.

1440
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:43,166
Kind of people go to a bar
on a Wednesday morning?

1441
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,500
WILLIAM:
It's an eclectic group.

1442
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:48,208
-What are you having?
-(“Junker's Blues” playing over radio)

1443
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:50,083
LUCILLE:
I'll take a tetanus shot.

1444
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:52,083
-Jim Beam, two times.
-BARTENDER: Sure, Bill.

1445
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:54,208
(sighs) I thought you and Desi had a deal.

1446
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:56,791
You don't drink at work.

1447
01:02:56,875 --> 01:02:59,416
Desi and I have a deal
that I won't be drunk at work.

1448
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,625
Have you ever seen me drunk at work?

1449
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:03,708
-Would I know?
-No.

1450
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:04,958
Here's to your new baby.

1451
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:06,458
All right, then.

1452
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,916
Are they being polite
or do they not recognize us?

1453
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,583
They don't own television sets.

1454
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:14,416
Why didn't I think of that?

1455
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,833
Honey, I read seven newspapers every day.

1456
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:18,833
Seven? When do you have time to do that?

1457
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:21,666
It's 30 minutes between races
at Santa Anita,

1458
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,708
and it takes me a minute and a half
to pick a horse.

1459
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:25,333
-Aren't you at work?
-Yeah.

1460
01:03:25,416 --> 01:03:28,291
We have bookies now and telephones.

1461
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:31,083
Know all about that.
Did a Damon Runyon picture.

1462
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:33,000
In none of those seven newspapers

1463
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:36,958
have I read anything about
Lucille Ball being a Communist.

1464
01:03:38,416 --> 01:03:40,791
I don't hear anyone talking about it.

1465
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:42,458
Since when do you talk to anyone?

1466
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:44,958
I got news for you: the less you talk,
the more things you hear,

1467
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:46,875
and I haven't heard anything.

1468
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:48,916
So…

1469
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,208
problems at home?

1470
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,416
Problems at home?

1471
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,541
-Yeah.
-No.

1472
01:03:55,625 --> 01:04:00,291
I'd like very much to have problems at
home, but my problem's not home that much.

1473
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:01,458
Few times a week.

1474
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:02,708
He was playing cards on the boat
Wednesday night.

1475
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:04,125
I know.

1476
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:05,458
The picture's six months old.

1477
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:07,958
I was there when it was taken.

1478
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:10,541
I'm saying, why wasn't he home,
where I and our daughter were?

1479
01:04:10,625 --> 01:04:14,875
Your husband is in love with America
like no man I have ever known

1480
01:04:14,958 --> 01:04:19,583
since George M. Cohan, who loved America
so much he wrote the same song five times.

1481
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:20,708
Okay?

1482
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:24,208
Desi loves America as much as that guy.

1483
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:26,500
But that doesn't mean he's not Cuban.

1484
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:28,208
-I know that.
-The world he's from

1485
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:30,916
has a very narrow definition of manhood.

1486
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,291
-I know that, too.
-The man is the man.

1487
01:04:33,375 --> 01:04:34,416
Mm-hmm.

1488
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,333
And not for nothing,
but the women are happy.

1489
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:38,208
(scoffs softly) You've asked them?

1490
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,000
They look happy.

1491
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:42,500
I see.

1492
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:46,125
-But that's neither here nor there.
-It really isn't.

1493
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:49,333
He's mesmerized by you, Lucille.

1494
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:52,500
And he misses you
when you're in two different places.

1495
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:54,708
He does. I'm a witness.

1496
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:56,333
-He doesn't have to.
-He…

1497
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:57,666
We live in the same house.

1498
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,625
He does have to.

1499
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:00,958
That's what I'm saying.

1500
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:07,083
He has to spend time away from you
so that he can feel like he's not the…

1501
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:08,458
Second banana.

1502
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:11,166
I navigate male egos for a living, bud.

1503
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,333
Then why are you running the set?

1504
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:15,958
Why are you running rehearsals?

1505
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:17,666
You're doing it right in front of him.

1506
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:20,458
I can't prioritize the director's feelings
over the health of the show.

1507
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:23,500
No, no, not– I couldn't care less
about Donald's feelings if I tried hard.

1508
01:05:23,583 --> 01:05:24,666
He's a hack.

1509
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:28,916
But we'll overcome that because,
frankly, we're not doing Uncle Vanya.

1510
01:05:30,291 --> 01:05:31,500
Got it.

1511
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:33,250
But the business at the dinner table
has to be precise.

1512
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:35,083
Really?

1513
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:36,708
I was only in vaudeville 40 years,

1514
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:39,375
so I wouldn't know about these things
of which you speak.

1515
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:40,500
I know you know.

1516
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:41,750
I'm just saying…

1517
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:44,625
You did it in front of Desi is my point.

1518
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:47,500
Let me tell you something about Desi.

1519
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:49,416
He runs this show.

Oh, Wally Pipp.

toured with his husband's Latin orchestra.

Now, this studio has a handshake
understanding with Metro and Warner,

1694

“Guess who it is.”

-“No.”
-“No.”

“George? Julius? Stephen? Ivan?”

1800
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:18,333

-We changed that to

1801
01:18:18,416 --> 01:18:19,708
“Pedro? Julio? Juan? Guillermo?”

1810
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:36,958

takes his hands away from Lucy's eyes,

1811
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:38,541
turns her around and says…

1812
01:18:38,625 --> 01:18:42,041
-“No, it's me.”
-So my question again, Jess:

1813
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:46,416
Does Ricky honestly, truly believe
that there might be eight different men

1814
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:51,750
who routinely walk into their apartment,
all of whom sound exactly like Desi Arnaz?

they won't soon forgive you.

cutting the flowers in the scene…

1828

1829
01:19:21,666 --> 01:19:23,208
Ricky opens the door, comes in,

1830
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:26,416
shuts the door, as we've seen him do
in 37 episodes.

1831
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,250
Lucy doesn't acknowledge him.

-Right.

notice he's home any more than we can.

01:19:37,916 --> 01:19:41,208
He stands there for a full beat,
and then another,

1837
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:45,083
and then merrily,
in a slightly exaggerated manner,

1838
01:19:45,166 --> 01:19:48,208

a hundred times, he says…

01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:46,375
Then turns to Fred and says,
“What's a hypocrite?”

1861
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:48,750
Fred tells him,
“It's a person who says one thing

1862
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:50,208
-but does another.”
-Mm-hmm.

1863
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:52,541
Desi says, “Thank you,”
turns back to Lucy and says…

1864
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:54,708
-“Oh, yeah?” (chuckles)
-Yeah, that's good. That's good.

1865
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:56,500
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was gonna pitch.

1866
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:58,541
-But I pitched it faster.
-By interrupting me.

1867
01:20:58,625 --> 01:21:00,166
How do you think I got to be
a woman in a comedy room?

1868
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,250
(knocking)

1869
01:21:01,333 --> 01:21:02,833
Hey, is now a good time?

1870
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:04,083
JESS:
Yeah. Madelyn had a good idea.

1871
01:21:04,166 --> 01:21:07,833
Desi's entrance, we shoot it both ways
and see which one gets the bigger laugh.

1872
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,208
That was my idea.

1873
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:10,833
It's a bad idea.

1874
01:21:10,916 --> 01:21:12,250
Mm. It's just not your day.

1875
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:14,291
-Can I have a minute in your office?
-JESS: Yeah.

1876
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:15,625
Sure.

1877
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:17,458
(sighs):
All right.

1878
01:21:17,541 --> 01:21:18,958

1879
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,416
What's wrong with shooting it both ways?

1880
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,875
You'll be on the floor
during the show, right?

1881
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:25,458
I'll be where I always am.

1882
01:21:25,541 --> 01:21:27,291
In full view of the audience?

1883
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:28,875
I suppose.

1884
01:21:28,958 --> 01:21:30,375
Since we're doing it both ways,

1885
01:21:30,458 --> 01:21:33,458
how about we do it once with your pants on
and once with your pants off?

1886
01:21:33,541 --> 01:21:35,458
-That's not the same.
-It is.

1887
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:39,166
And I don't want to do the version
with my pants off in front of 200 people.

1888
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:42,125
But that's not what I need
to talk to you about.

1889
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:44,208
You're not gonna tell me
you're pregnant again, are you?

1890
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:47,333
No.
I'm still pregnant from before, but no.

1891
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:50,125
Jess, you know how much I value you.

1892
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:52,333
-I think I do.
-You know you do.

1893
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:53,500
Okay.

1894
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:55,708
And you also know what it is
Desi does around here.

1895
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:57,458
Sure.

1896
01:21:57,541 --> 01:22:00,125
-I mean, every business decision
goes through Desi. -Mm-hmm.

1897
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:03,208
In fact, most business decisions
are made by Desi.

1898
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:06,083
-You married a very bright man.
-I did.

1899
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:08,458
He makes a lot of creative decisions, too.

1900
01:22:08,541 --> 01:22:10,500
Mm. I'm not sure I'd say a lot.

1901
01:22:10,583 --> 01:22:11,791
I would. I'd say a lot.

1902
01:22:11,875 --> 01:22:13,625
He devised the camera system that we use.

1903
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:16,625
He's the reason the East Coast
doesn't see the show on a foggy kinescope.

1904
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:18,583
-Yeah.
-And even though we use three cameras,

1905
01:22:18,666 --> 01:22:20,916
the studio audience can see every scene.

1906
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,916
-That's him, too.
-Mm-hmm.

1907
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,500
And the four of us, the cast,
we can see the audience.

1908
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:25,708
I give him a lot of credit for that.

1909
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:29,166
He's the one who thought up
Lucy being pregnant on the show.

1910
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:32,791
That is never gonna happen,
'cause no matter what CBS says,

1911
01:22:32,875 --> 01:22:34,125
Philip Morris is never
gonna let it happen.

1912
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:36,125
But, like I said, I give him credit.

1913
01:22:36,208 --> 01:22:38,708
That's the thing, though. You don't.

1914
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:39,958
What do you mean?

1915
01:22:40,041 --> 01:22:42,291
He doesn't get credit
as an executive producer,

1916
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:44,750
which, let's face it, is what he is.

1917
01:22:44,833 --> 01:22:47,125
-(sighs)
-You get sole credit.

1918
01:22:47,208 --> 01:22:49,708
I didn't win my credit in a raffle!
I earn it.

1919
01:22:49,791 --> 01:22:52,625
I'm the showrunner! Not to mention
being the creator of the show.

1920
01:22:52,708 --> 01:22:54,833
I don't see how we could
do the show without you.

1921
01:22:54,916 --> 01:22:56,083
You absolutely could not.

1922
01:22:56,166 --> 01:22:59,000
I don't see how we could do the show
without Desi either.

1923
01:22:59,083 --> 01:23:02,083
Because he plays Ricky,
which he does get a screen credit for.

-Why are you telling me?
-The opening,

Ricky's entrance with his hands
over my eyes, that was Jess, right?

1946

You know I'm right about the logic.

Why aren't you backing me up instead of
endorsing a plan to shoot it both ways?

1951
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:22,291
Listen, why don't we get together
for a drink or a swim this weekend,

01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:23,916

I won't say who wrote what,

1960
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:45,000
that I'm the lady in there
trying to make Lucy smarter.

struggling, it sounds like–
to make Lucy smarter?

1968

And she needs to be smarter?

1969
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:07,166
She sometimes, for the sake of comedy,
is infantilized.

-This is a crazy week,

time and place to be having
this conversation.

1972
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:15,125
-This is important…
-How is she infantilized?

1973
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:16,750
She literally says, “Waah.”

1974
01:25:16,833 --> 01:25:18,750
'Cause when she does,
60 million people laugh,

1975
01:25:18,833 --> 01:25:22,125
just like with Lou Costello
and Stan Laurel, and you get paid.

1976
01:25:22,208 --> 01:25:25,041
When those two grown men
play slow-witted five-year-olds, I cringe.

No, you don't.

You think I'm the funniest writer
in the room,

1980
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:32,250
and that's why
you're talking to me and not Jess.

1981
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:37,333
Many people regard Lucy as clever.

1982
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:39,625
I mean, she always has a plan
to overcome an obstacle.

1983
01:25:39,708 --> 01:25:43,375
Yeah, but oftentimes that obstacle
is her husband's permission.

1984
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:47,958
You really think, this week, right now,
is the best time to talk about this?

1985
01:25:48,041 --> 01:25:51,625
-No! I literally said that 30 seconds ago.
-(sighs)

1986
01:25:52,625 --> 01:25:54,541
Look…

1987
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:58,208

and they outsmart the men.

feel like you have to…

Oh, stop. Okay.

And my fervent wish for you
is that, one day,

2002
01:26:25,291 --> 01:26:26,791
you will be half as funny as Gracie Allen.

2003
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:31,166
In the meantime, please remember
that Lucy and Ricky and Fred and Ethel,

2004
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:34,000
if they live past tomorrow,
have to live in a reality

01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:21,333
Uh, nothing from Mr. Lyons yet?

2025
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:22,375
No.

2026
01:27:22,458 --> 01:27:23,625
(sighs)

2027
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:25,291
Anyone at Philip Morris?

2028
01:27:25,375 --> 01:27:26,708
No.

2029
01:27:31,833 --> 01:27:33,750
Gracias.

2030
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:36,166
-(phone ringing)
-Acompáñame al escenario.

2031
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:38,083
Walk me to the stage.
We're an hour behind.

2032
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:40,041
Okay, Madelyn's got a new joke
for the second act.

2033
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:42,875
I just this minute told Lucy
that we don't talk about who wrote what.

2034
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:45,000
Madelyn came up with the joke
just seconds after I did.

2035
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:47,791
Isn't it possible that two comedy writers
working on the same script

2036
01:27:47,875 --> 01:27:49,250
came up with the same joke
at the same time?

2037
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:50,416
-It's possible.
-Thank you.

2038
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,708
-Just not what happened.
-Do I need to be here for any of this?

2039
01:27:52,791 --> 01:27:55,000
Uh, “Hypocrite? What's a hypocrite?”

2040
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:57,791
-So that's to Fred.
-Got it. Good.

2041
01:27:57,875 --> 01:27:59,333
-Is that what you wanted me for?
-Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

2042
01:27:59,416 --> 01:28:01,958
The hypocrite joke is for episode nine.
That's the script we're working on, okay?

2043
01:28:02,041 --> 01:28:03,958
If Lucy's gonna be pregnant–
Lucy Ricardo–

2044
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:06,375
then we have to introduce it in nine,
according to your timetable.

2045
01:28:06,458 --> 01:28:09,541
-Yeah. -So I just want to confirm that
there's no chance we're doing that, right?

2046
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:11,333
We are doing that.

2047
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:13,166
You know Philip Morris won't let us.

2048
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:15,375
And-and even if they did,
we don't want to see this girl pregnant.

2049
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:16,583
We don't want to know that she's pregnant.

2050
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:17,833
We don't want to know
how she got pregnant.

2051
01:28:17,916 --> 01:28:20,833
Do we have viewers who don't know
how women get pregnant?

2052
01:28:20,916 --> 01:28:22,416
Yeah, they're called children.

2053
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:25,375
Uh, do any of these children have
younger brothers or sisters?

2054
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:28,208
You know what, you know what else
a lot of our viewers are? Christian.

2055
01:28:28,291 --> 01:28:30,083
Ah, I'm way ahead of you.

2056
01:28:30,166 --> 01:28:35,708
I'm going to have a priest, a minister
and a rabbi review every script.

2057
01:28:35,791 --> 01:28:37,916
I'm gonna get rewritten by
a priest, a minister and a rabbi?

2058
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,666
-Mm-hmm.
-A joke in there somewhere.

2059
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:41,916
Good, because if I'm rewritten
by a priest, a minister and a rabbi,

2060
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,208
there aren't gonna be many
left in the script.

2061
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:44,541
-(laughs) Good one.
-Uh, Des…

2062
01:28:44,625 --> 01:28:46,083
No, no, e-enough. Enough.

2063
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:48,083
I sent a telegram to Alfred Lyons.

2064
01:28:48,166 --> 01:28:49,291
-You did.
-Yes.

2065
01:28:49,375 --> 01:28:50,791
And I've put the decision in his hands.

2066
01:28:50,875 --> 01:28:52,833
-Okay. Okay.
-All right.

2067
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:54,250
(chuckles):
Okay, good.

2068
01:28:54,333 --> 01:28:57,000
-You're that sure he's gonna say no, huh?
-I am.

2069
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:59,083
-That it? Okay.
-Mm-hmm. -Yeah.

2070
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:02,333
Oh, Bob, Bob, tell Desi that thing
you were saying before.

2071
01:29:03,416 --> 01:29:04,500
Me?

2072
01:29:04,583 --> 01:29:06,625
Yeah.

2073
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,333
-Really?
-DESI: Guys.

2074
01:29:08,416 --> 01:29:09,958
JESS:
No, it was interesting.

2075
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:11,666
-Bob was saying that you…
-Hmm?

2076
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:13,791
…are really the title character
of the show.

2077
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:17,708
Because you are the “I” in I Love Lucy.

2078
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:20,375
Mm-hmm.

2079
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:21,875
So strictly speaking,
you have top billing.

2080
01:29:22,958 --> 01:29:25,250
I am the “I” in I Love Lucy.

2081
01:29:25,333 --> 01:29:27,291

Yeah.

2082
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:28,875
I never thought of it that way.

2083
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:30,916
-Yeah, you like that?
-I like that.

2084
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Yeah.

2085
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:33,875
(chuckles):
Jess…

2086
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:37,333
patronize me again,
and I'll stick my hand down your throat

2087
01:29:37,416 --> 01:29:39,958
and pull your fucking lungs out.

01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,791

-ROSEN: Excuse me.

2089
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:42,875
What is it?

2090
01:29:42,958 --> 01:29:44,666
It-It's a telegram for Mr. Arnaz.

2091
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:47,416
-It's from Mr. Lyons and Philip Morris.
-Mm.

2092
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:50,833
-Vamos a ver.
-Yeah.

2093
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:56,041
Let's go, please.

2094
01:29:56,125 --> 01:29:58,166
-We are an hour behind.
-Yeah.

2095
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:05,666
What does it say?

2096
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:09,791
“To all Philip Morris and CBS employees:

2097
01:30:11,041 --> 01:30:13,166
Don't fuck with the Cuban.”

2098
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:16,958

2099
01:30:19,916 --> 01:30:22,625

and he hasn't called.

2100
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:25,916
Not that it makes any difference to me.”

2101
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,708
“Oh, I can see that it doesn't make
any difference to you.

2102
01:30:28,791 --> 01:30:31,750
Why don't you call Ricky
and tell him you're sorry?”

2103
01:30:31,833 --> 01:30:35,125
“What? You think I'd allow my pride…”
Hmm.

2104
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:38,416
“Do you think
I'd swallow my pride like that?”

2105
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:39,500
(whispers):
Never.

2106
01:30:41,125 --> 01:30:42,333
(whispers):
What are you doing up?

2107
01:30:42,416 --> 01:30:45,208
(hushed):
I woke up and you weren't there.

2108
01:30:45,291 --> 01:30:49,291
So I went to the nursery
to see if everything was okay, and…

2109
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:51,416
she kicked her blanket off, so I fixed it.

2110
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,416
That woke her up.

2111
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:56,125
But as you can see,
I got her back to sleep.

to do the laundry, right?

I like doing laundry.
I never get the chance.

Okay, I'm going to put her back
in her little apartment now.

she's drunk, I'm not.

Why do you ask?

-You heard her right.

It won't take long.
We just need to make an adjustment.

Two people who are fighting
have to share a seat at a dinner table.

Can't just be a scrum.

2353
01:43:24,875 --> 01:43:26,458
(sighs softly)

2354
01:43:27,541 --> 01:43:30,708
(band playing I Love Lucy theme)

2355
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:38,666
(lively chatter)

2356
01:43:50,541 --> 01:43:51,916
All right, holding. Get Des.

2357
01:43:57,500 --> 01:44:00,375
-(music ends)
-(applause)

2358
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:02,416
(applause continues in distance)

2359
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:04,958
We think it's about 15 minutes.

2360
01:44:06,041 --> 01:44:07,541
-You think?
-We're holding for something.

2361
01:44:07,625 --> 01:44:10,375
-I'm not sure what.
-Okay, thanks.

2362
01:44:10,458 --> 01:44:11,875
Holding?

2363
01:44:13,083 --> 01:44:14,250
(knocking)

2364
01:44:14,333 --> 01:44:16,333
Yeah, come in.

2365
01:44:17,375 --> 01:44:19,000
(sighs)

2366
01:44:20,541 --> 01:44:22,875
-Can I have a second?
-Sure.

2367
01:44:23,833 --> 01:44:25,833
-(footsteps receding)
-(band playing in distance)

2368
01:44:27,333 --> 01:44:29,041
I think I know why you want to see me.

2369
01:44:29,125 --> 01:44:31,208
-Do you?
-Hear me out.

2370
01:44:31,291 --> 01:44:32,416
I asked you to do me a favor, Jess.

2371
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:34,416
-I asked you to give him an E.P. credit.
-Mm-hmm.

2372
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:38,250
Instead, you tried to convince him he was
the title character or some bullshit.

2373
01:44:38,333 --> 01:44:39,375
What the hell was that?!

2374
01:44:39,458 --> 01:44:40,791
-I'm sorry if he was insulted.
-(sighs)

2375
01:44:40,875 --> 01:44:42,416
I mean, I know he's insulted,
so I'm sorry.

2376
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,916
He wasn't insulted.
He was laughing about it.

2377
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,541
But, yeah, he's insulted.

2378
01:44:46,625 --> 01:44:48,208
No, he's offended. I'm insulted.

2379
01:44:48,291 --> 01:44:51,458
-I asked you to do me a small favor.
-Yeah.

2380
01:44:51,541 --> 01:44:53,416
And it's not like
you don't owe me a couple.

2381
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:55,583
(sighs)

2382
01:44:55,666 --> 01:44:57,666
It wasn't a small favor.

2383
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:59,541
And I don't know what you think I owe you.

2384
01:44:59,625 --> 01:45:01,375
-Really?
-It wasn't a small favor.

2385
01:45:01,458 --> 01:45:04,250
-You asked me to save your marriage.
-No, I…

2386
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:06,333
And-and it's not the first time
you've asked me to do that, is it?

2387
01:45:06,416 --> 01:45:09,208
I asked you to give him
an E.P. credit, that's all.

2388
01:45:09,291 --> 01:45:11,416
Oh, no problem.
Can my wife play Lucy once in a while?

2389
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:13,250
If your wife played Lucy once in a while,

2390
01:45:13,333 --> 01:45:15,958
I would think it appropriate
she be so credited.

2391
01:45:16,041 --> 01:45:17,583
And what do you mean
it's not the first time

2392
01:45:17,666 --> 01:45:19,625
-I asked you to save my marriage?
-(scoffs)

2393
01:45:19,708 --> 01:45:21,375
(imitating Lucille): “Jess, Jess,
we'll have Desi play my husband.

2394
01:45:21,458 --> 01:45:23,583
-It'll save my marriage.”
-Was that supposed to be me?

2395
01:45:23,666 --> 01:45:25,083
-Yeah, yeah.
-Don't do voices.

2396
01:45:25,166 --> 01:45:27,083
Oh, are you insulted? Desi's offended?

2397
01:45:27,166 --> 01:45:29,875
You asked me to give away my job title
like it was a parking spot!

2398
01:45:29,958 --> 01:45:31,208
You're right.

2399
01:45:31,291 --> 01:45:32,708
-I'm sorry!
-Jesus Christ, Lucy!

2400
01:45:32,791 --> 01:45:34,625
Sometimes I think that you…

2401
01:45:37,625 --> 01:45:38,833
Wait, what?

2402
01:45:40,416 --> 01:45:42,125
You're right. I'm sorry.

2403
01:45:42,208 --> 01:45:43,375
I was dead wrong.

2404
01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:45,666
I wasn't expecting that.

2405
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:47,250
-I know.
-Have you ever said that to me before?

2406
01:45:47,333 --> 01:45:49,250
I doubt it, but…

2407
01:45:49,333 --> 01:45:51,791
I've thought it, if that means anything.

2408
01:45:51,875 --> 01:45:53,708
It does.

2409
01:45:54,708 --> 01:45:57,875
It's just been
a compound fracture of a week.

2410
01:45:59,875 --> 01:46:01,500
Hey.

2411
01:46:01,583 --> 01:46:03,625
-Why are we holding?
-I'm not sure.

2412
01:46:03,708 --> 01:46:05,208
We're holding. Someone has to know why.

2413
01:46:05,291 --> 01:46:07,250
-He's-he's coming.
-(knocking)

2414
01:46:07,333 --> 01:46:09,625
-(sighs)
-Come in.

2415
01:46:09,708 --> 01:46:11,458
Desi's asking to see you in his office.

2416
01:46:12,541 --> 01:46:14,583
-You mean in his dressing room?
-No, he's in his office

2417
01:46:14,666 --> 01:46:17,083
with some CBS executives
and some men from Philip Morris.

2418
01:46:19,875 --> 01:46:21,583
Why is he in his office at showtime?

2419
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,250
♪ ♪

2420
01:46:28,125 --> 01:46:30,875
The evening editions just came out.

2421
01:46:34,833 --> 01:46:36,250
Listen to me.

2422
01:46:36,333 --> 01:46:38,000
Memorize this.

2423
01:46:38,083 --> 01:46:40,041
“It's none of your fucking business.”

2424
01:46:44,208 --> 01:46:45,291
There.

2425
01:46:45,375 --> 01:46:47,791
Let that be the best thing I ever wrote.

2426
01:46:54,416 --> 01:46:55,625
Nah.

2427
01:46:55,708 --> 01:46:57,416
It's still “Vitameatavegamin.”

2428
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:01,958
(sighs)

2429
01:47:05,208 --> 01:47:07,208
(hushed chatter)

2430
01:47:10,791 --> 01:47:12,208
(chatter quiets)

2431
01:47:15,875 --> 01:47:17,041
(clears throat)

2432
01:47:19,125 --> 01:47:20,541
DESI:
The evening edition.

2433
01:47:25,375 --> 01:47:26,791
-It's all right.
-(sighs)

2434
01:47:26,875 --> 01:47:28,291
It's all right.

2435
01:47:29,583 --> 01:47:30,583
(exhales sharply)

2436
01:47:30,666 --> 01:47:32,500
It's in four-inch type.

2437
01:47:32,583 --> 01:47:34,583
I'm gonna fix this.

2438
01:47:34,666 --> 01:47:36,000
That's Hindenburg type.

2439
01:47:36,083 --> 01:47:38,041
I've already made the calls.

2440
01:47:38,125 --> 01:47:39,916
-And they used red ink.
-Yeah.

2441
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,416
I didn't even know newspapers had red ink.

2442
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:43,833
I guess they do.

2443
01:47:43,916 --> 01:47:46,208
I was cleared.

2444
01:47:46,291 --> 01:47:49,541
Somehow, the city editor,
a woman named Agness Underwood,

2445
01:47:49,625 --> 01:47:54,375
has a photostatic copy of the affidavit
showing you registered in 1936

2446
01:47:54,458 --> 01:47:56,750
as a voter intending to affiliate
with the Communist Party.

2447
01:47:56,833 --> 01:47:58,000
But I was cleared.

2448
01:47:58,083 --> 01:48:00,041
After the testimony,
they stamped “canceled” on the card,

2449
01:48:00,125 --> 01:48:01,166
and I saw the card.

2450
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,791
Other papers are
showing the canceled card.

2451
01:48:02,875 --> 01:48:05,750
They're running a caption that says,
“Note the cancellation at left.”

2452
01:48:05,833 --> 01:48:10,125
But the Herald-Express took the word
“canceled” out of the document altogether.

2453
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:11,583
Other papers?

2454
01:48:11,666 --> 01:48:14,666
Yes, yes, but I've-I've made calls
and we are taking care of this.

2455
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:16,791
-We– Eh?
-Calls to who?

2456
01:48:16,875 --> 01:48:18,833
Every reporter within 20 minutes
of this soundstage.

2457
01:48:18,916 --> 01:48:20,000
That's why we're holding.

2458
01:48:20,083 --> 01:48:22,250
-You're saying reporters are coming here?
-Yeah.

2459
01:48:22,333 --> 01:48:24,416
We'll seat them in the back
of the bleachers.

2460
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:26,541
You think we're still filming a show?

2461
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:29,000
Why are none of you talking?

2462
01:48:29,083 --> 01:48:30,500
Desi has an idea.

2463
01:48:30,583 --> 01:48:34,833
I'm going to warm up the audience
the way I always do,

2464
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:38,666
except instead of “Cuban Pete”
and the joke about the turtle,

2465
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:40,875
I'm going to tell them what happened.

2466
01:48:40,958 --> 01:48:44,291
I'm going to explain
that you checked the wrong box,

2467
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:47,291
I'm going to show them
the canceled document,

2468
01:48:47,375 --> 01:48:49,750
and then I'm going to bring you out

2469
01:48:49,833 --> 01:48:52,500
so the press sees them
give you a round of applause.

2470
01:48:52,583 --> 01:48:53,666
Yes.

2471
01:48:54,666 --> 01:48:55,875
Hmm?

2472
01:48:57,250 --> 01:48:59,208
Fellas, can we, um…

2473
01:48:59,291 --> 01:49:01,375
have the room for just a moment?

2474
01:49:14,625 --> 01:49:18,541
You're not telling these people
that I checked the wrong box.

2475
01:49:18,625 --> 01:49:20,625
This is a critical moment, Lucy.

2476
01:49:20,708 --> 01:49:22,625
-If I'm gonna die…
-You're not.

2477
01:49:22,708 --> 01:49:24,541
…I would rather die standing up.

2478
01:49:24,625 --> 01:49:25,916
(scoffs) I don't have any idea
what that is suppo…

2479
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,791
I'm not an idiot.
I didn't check the wrong box.

2480
01:49:27,875 --> 01:49:28,875
You saw the headline.

2481
01:49:28,958 --> 01:49:31,833
-You can see the headline
from outer space. -Then please…

2482
01:49:31,916 --> 01:49:34,958
Grandpa Fred raised me
from when I was age four.

2483
01:49:35,041 --> 01:49:38,125
He cared about the little guy.
He cared about workers' rights.

2484
01:49:38,208 --> 01:49:41,000
It was a tribute to him,
and to say that I checked the wrong…

2485
01:49:41,083 --> 01:49:42,458
Grandpa Fred, Grandpa Fred.

2486
01:49:42,541 --> 01:49:45,458
Grandpa Fred was wrong, Lucy!

2487
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:49,083
Yes, he didn't tell you the part
where they throw your father in prison

2488
01:49:49,166 --> 01:49:51,291
for the crime
of being the mayor of a city.

2489
01:49:51,375 --> 01:49:55,666
I was chased to this country, Lucy!

2490
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:57,833
Believe me, you checked the wrong box!

2491
01:50:00,791 --> 01:50:02,333
And if they don't applaud?

2492
01:50:03,958 --> 01:50:06,666
They will.
And the press will write that they did.

2493
01:50:09,208 --> 01:50:11,541
You're gonna tell them I was accused of…

2494
01:50:11,625 --> 01:50:14,083
They're going to read it
in the morning anyway.

2495
01:50:14,166 --> 01:50:17,875
We have a sample population
of 200 people on our stage, so…

2496
01:50:17,958 --> 01:50:19,541
Miss Rosen!

2497
01:50:19,625 --> 01:50:21,625
If they boo me?

2498
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,666
If they boo you…

2499
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,958
…then we're done.

2500
01:50:29,041 --> 01:50:31,250
-Here, tonight.
-(door opens)

2501
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:40,375
Call this man.

2502
01:50:41,833 --> 01:50:44,583
Tell them it's for me.

2503
01:50:44,666 --> 01:50:46,000
They'll find him.

2504
01:50:46,083 --> 01:50:48,250
He's expecting my call.

2505
01:50:48,333 --> 01:50:49,833
Tell me when you have him.

2506
01:50:49,916 --> 01:50:51,333
ROSEN:
Yes, sir.

2507
01:50:52,666 --> 01:50:54,041
(door closes)

2508
01:50:58,916 --> 01:51:00,916
(rumba music playing faintly)

2509
01:51:02,875 --> 01:51:04,875
(music continues inside)

2510
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,916
Someone said they spotted you
going out here.

2511
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:14,750
(sighs)

2512
01:51:17,666 --> 01:51:18,875
I was just told.

2513
01:51:18,958 --> 01:51:20,250
(sighs)

2514
01:51:20,333 --> 01:51:23,333
Jesus, Lulu. Four-inch type?

2515
01:51:23,416 --> 01:51:25,041
Red ink.

2516
01:51:27,916 --> 01:51:29,625
I shouldn't have piled on this week.

2517
01:51:29,708 --> 01:51:31,125
It just…

2518
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:33,583
What?

2519
01:51:34,583 --> 01:51:36,791
None of that matters right now.

2520
01:51:39,416 --> 01:51:41,166
May be the last time we're out here.

2521
01:51:41,250 --> 01:51:43,041

and Ethel is married to her grandfather,
and it's understood,

2525
01:51:54,125 --> 01:51:56,958
as the underlying premise
for a running joke,

Last week, my wife, Lucille Ball,

was asked to testify
in front of a closed session

Un-American Activities Committee.

Yes, the congressmen

After hours of testimony,
the committee concluded unambiguously

2607
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:38,500
that Lucy was and is in no way
involved with the Communist Party.

2608
01:56:38,583 --> 01:56:40,875
So everything's swell, right?

2609

-All right, everybody!
-Let's do a show!

2694
02:01:15,541 --> 02:01:17,416
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
This is places for scene “A”!

2695
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:19,166
-MAN 1: Scene “A”!
-MAN 2: Scene “A,” places!

2696
02:01:19,250 --> 02:01:21,291
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
Okay, positions, everyone.

-Cameras up.

2698
02:01:22,958 --> 02:01:24,291
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
Quiet on set. Bell!

2699
02:01:24,375 --> 02:01:25,375
(soundstage bell rings)

2700
02:01:25,458 --> 02:01:26,791

2703

-Let's roll sound.
-Rolling! -Rolling!

2704
02:01:32,250 --> 02:01:33,541
-Sound speed.
-And mark.

2705
02:01:33,625 --> 02:01:35,541
-Speed mark.
-Dolly.

2706
02:01:35,625 --> 02:01:37,791
Settle. And action.

2707
02:01:38,875 --> 02:01:40,958
OLDER MADELYN:
It ended up being a good show that night.

2708
02:01:41,041 --> 02:01:43,958
We did both versions of the opening,

2709
02:01:44,041 --> 02:01:46,250
but it was the original version
that made it on the air,

2710
02:01:46,333 --> 02:01:47,541
the one with all the names.

2711
02:01:47,625 --> 02:01:51,000
You must've gotten a copy
of the “B” negative,

2712
02:01:51,083 --> 02:01:52,583
'cause your original question was…

2713
02:01:52,666 --> 02:01:55,500
For the record, I won my bet with Desi.

2714
02:01:55,583 --> 02:01:57,958
CBS wouldn't let us use
the word “pregnant.”

2715
02:01:59,541 --> 02:02:01,375
But more people watched
the birth of Little Ricky

2716
02:02:01,458 --> 02:02:04,666
than had ever watched
a television program before.

2717
02:02:05,833 --> 02:02:07,083
Your original question?

2718
02:02:07,166 --> 02:02:10,458
You asked about why Lucy stopped
when we were doing the alt.

2719
02:02:10,541 --> 02:02:11,708
The alternate version.

2720
02:02:11,791 --> 02:02:14,833
We were doing Lucy's version
of Ricky's entrance first.

2721
02:02:14,916 --> 02:02:16,541
She was doing the bit with the flowers,

2722
02:02:16,625 --> 02:02:19,208
which we couldn't use
'cause we were running long.

2723
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:24,250
(audience laughter)

2724
02:02:27,791 --> 02:02:31,833
She takes a pitcher
and pours water into the vase…

2725
02:02:31,916 --> 02:02:34,625
Which makes all the flowers
come up to the surface.

2726
02:02:37,916 --> 02:02:40,083
(audience laughter)

2727
02:02:44,083 --> 02:02:47,500
It seemed like she just got lost
in her own head for a second.

2728
02:02:47,583 --> 02:02:49,333
I can't remember what her cue was.

2729
02:02:49,416 --> 02:02:52,041
It may have been the only time
she ever went up on a line.

2730
02:02:52,125 --> 02:02:55,083
I can't remember the first line, but we…

2731
02:02:55,166 --> 02:02:56,583
we had to stop and go again.

2732
02:02:56,666 --> 02:02:58,666
It was Desi's line.

2733
02:02:58,750 --> 02:03:00,500
It was the new bit Lucy put in.

2734
02:03:01,708 --> 02:03:03,166

What was his line?

2735
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:06,750
