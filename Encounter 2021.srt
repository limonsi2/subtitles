No.

Your mom's got guts to spare.

360
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,333
Okay? Believe me.

361
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:44,416
Hey, let me show you something else.

362
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,125
This is where we're headed.
It's in Nevada.

363
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:51,958
We should be there about noon tomorrow.

364
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:53,750
And...

365
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,083
and we came from up here in Oregon, right?

366
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,458
Yeah. You've got
yourself a job navigating.

367
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:00,208
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are these muscles?

It's dangerous.

376
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:17,500

as half the population.

00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:37,625
Folks look normal, but inside they're not.

382
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,875
If you use that spray,
it's like a force field.

383
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,041
You're gonna be safe.

384

Hey, Bobby.

to you while I'm around, okay?

390

something like this

393

394
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:05,208
Hey. When you get back to school,

395
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:07,583

stories you're gonna have?

396
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:10,125
Uh, can I tell them about the gun firing?

397

I mean, I'm not sure
if you can tell them that.

398
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:15,375
It's top secret, dude.
That's just for the crew.

399
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:16,583
That's just for the Musketeers.

400
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:18,208
But you can tell them you went on

401
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:20,333
a crazy road trip
with your cool-ass dad, okay?

402
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,208
-Yeah, just smile.

403
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:25,083
Smiling's the best disguise.

404
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:26,875
Okay, that's a little bit
too much. It's scary.

405
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,250
Dude, you're looking like
an alien yourself now.

406

-Just smile normally.
-What if the trooper finds us?

407
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:35,625
There's no way he's gonna find us.

408
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,208
What do you mean?

409
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:39,416

437

when there's an alien inside you?

438
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,208
I think it's like you can hear everything

439
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,333
and see everything,

440
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:55,708
but you just can't move
and you can't speak.

441
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:03,166

about 120 clients a year.

716

Been doing this for 18 years.

717
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,416
So that's...

718
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:33,666
And I have to look each and
every one of them in the eye

719
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,708
to see if I can find the good in 'em,

720
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:37,791
'cause that's what I do-- that's my job.

721

723
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,791
but by not putting out
an arrest warrant straightaway,

724
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,791

725
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:50,416
of these boys being hurt or killed.

737
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:38,125
Unfortunately, he checks
a lot of these boxes.

738
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:43,416
Separated from wife, isolated from kids.

739
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:46,333
Dishonorably discharged

740
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:48,666
from the one thing that he was good at.

741
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,291
He's got no benefits,
no health care, no pension.

742

Nothing.

743
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:57,041

for a couple of years

744
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,333

00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,125

Not even a toothbrush.

751
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:22,000
But you know what he did have?

752
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:23,750
He had a gun.

753
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:28,625

754
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,208

755
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:31,833
You're a parole officer.

756
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,208
But he loves his boys.

757
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:41,125
Practically all annihilators
are considered loving fathers.

758
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:44,416
That's why nobody sees it coming.

759
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:51,666
If we don't stop Malik,
he's gonna execute those boys.

in your direction, you understand me?

1418
01:37:14,708 --> 01:37:18,208
Trust me, I just don't want
anyone to get hurt.

1419
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:20,416
Why the fuck should I trust you, huh?

1420
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:21,833
We're done.

1421
01:37:21,916 --> 01:37:23,208
Okay, who do you trust?

1422
01:37:23,291 --> 01:37:24,583
Do you trust your PO?

1423
01:37:24,666 --> 01:37:26,625
My... What, Hattie?

1424
01:37:26,708 --> 01:37:28,208
Yeah. She's standing by.

1425
01:37:28,291 --> 01:37:30,791
Well, then, asshole, put her on.

1426
01:37:30,875 --> 01:37:32,875
Okay, I'm gonna do that now.

1427
01:37:41,708 --> 01:37:43,208
Malik?

1428
01:37:43,291 --> 01:37:44,875
MALIK:
Oh, Hattie.

1429
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:46,833
Came all this way for me, huh?

1430
01:37:48,916 --> 01:37:50,708
I fucked up, Hattie.

1431
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:54,208
I dug myself in pretty deep.

1432
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:56,500
I, uh...

1433
01:37:56,583 --> 01:37:58,500
I can see that.

1434
01:37:58,583 --> 01:38:00,458
But there's still a way out.

1435
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:04,166
Ah, not for me.

1436
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:06,583
-I deserve what's coming.
-I have to disagree with you.

1437
01:38:06,666 --> 01:38:10,916
Your mind has played
a horrible trick on you, Malik,

1438
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,250
and everybody's gonna take that
into account, okay?

1439
01:38:13,333 --> 01:38:15,541
Everybody's gonna take that into account.

1440
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:18,250
See, there are some things
going on in your head

1441
01:38:18,333 --> 01:38:20,458
that you're not in control of.

1442
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:24,833
But, Malik, your boys need you
now more than ever, okay?

1443
01:38:24,916 --> 01:38:26,875
If we do this thing right...

1444
01:38:26,958 --> 01:38:28,833
Listen to me.

1445

If we do this thing right,

You trying to fuck me, Hattie?

-No, Malik...
-Huh? You trying to fuck me?!

1451
01:38:44,208 --> 01:38:45,916
You're trying to fuck me.

SHEP: Malik! Let Jay out of
the car so we can resolve this.

1454
01:39:11,583 --> 01:39:13,750
You've got one more minute.

1455
01:39:13,833 --> 01:39:15,875
Hey, Jay.

1456
01:39:15,958 --> 01:39:18,750
Thank you for coming out here
to take care of me.

1457
01:39:18,833 --> 01:39:21,333
You did a good job, okay?

1458
01:39:21,416 --> 01:39:22,833
You did great.

1459
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:27,083
I need you to run off now.

1460
01:39:27,166 --> 01:39:28,916
Hmm.

1461
01:39:30,625 --> 01:39:32,250
Get out of the car.

1462
01:39:33,541 --> 01:39:35,958
Get out of the car!

1463
01:39:36,041 --> 01:39:38,333
I'm not going without you.

1464
01:39:38,416 --> 01:39:40,416
Families take care of each other.

1465
01:39:45,875 --> 01:39:47,833
I didn't take care of you.

1466
01:39:53,416 --> 01:39:55,166
I put you in danger.

1467
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:00,875
You put your trust in me.

1468
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,333
And I lied to you.

1469
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,250
Look where I got us to.

1470
01:40:12,125 --> 01:40:14,625
And it weren't you
that did those bad things.

1471
01:40:18,375 --> 01:40:20,375
It was the demons inside of you.

1472
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
But you're a hero to me, Dad.
