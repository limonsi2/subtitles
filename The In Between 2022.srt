Good morning, Tessa.
I'm Dr. Sarkisian.

14
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:13,002
You've been in
a very bad car accident.

15
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:15,613
You ruptured your heart
due to trauma,

16
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:18,703
which we were forced
to repair surgically.

17
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:21,402

Morning.

23

Morning.
I made pancakes.

24
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:19,938
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go shoot photos.

25
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:21,592
Oh, it's so cold outside.

26
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:24,116
Yeah, I just don't want
to miss the morning light.

27
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,295
Well, maybe when you're
back, we could do a little
research for colleges.

28
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:29,905
All right. Bye.

She's not taken
a single picture of us.

32
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,179
You're too pretty.
You'd break her lens.

33

Hey, I told you.
You've gotta let her
come to you.

a little short.

I think I'm just gonna go
tell the theater owner.

53
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:35,367
I mean, there's nothing he
can do about it. They
obviously sent him the wrong
print.

54
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:37,326
I can get my money back.

55
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:41,896
I've seen this film before.
I don't think you want
to miss it.

56

Does it have a happy ending?

57
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:47,075
No. Definitely not.

I lost feeling
about an hour ago,

71
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:49,066
so I'm not sure.
Why didn't you
say something?

72
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,809
Um, the movie is
a bit of a downer, so...

73
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:56,117
It's a love story.
[sniffles]

74

not all love stories
are downers.

The English Patient.
Mm-hmm.

78
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:10,827
I think it's the ending
of a relationship,

79
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:13,700
that's what makes
a love story so memorable.

80
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,398
What about
Pride and Prejudice?

81
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:19,575
Jane Eyre?
Those both have
happy endings.

82
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,535
That's only because
the writer chose to end
their love stories
prematurely.

83
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:28,062
Wow. That is
a really interesting way

84
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,717

you're wrong.

DiCaprio didn't die at the

marginal artistic talent.

00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,653
He saved Rose's life.
Right, of course.

92
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:58,701
But he also love-bombed her
and stole her away
from her fiancé.

93
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:03,010
And poor Rose was
just so hypnotized
by that steamy car sex,

94
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:09,103
that she really thought
that he'd give her a life
of passionate adventure?

95
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:17,502
Please, come on.
That's a life of abject
poverty and dehumanizing
infidelity.

was a disaster...

a one-star review, for sure.

101
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,795
So, um, how did you get
so good at speaking French?

102
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:51,841
My dad is
a foreign languages
professor.

103
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:56,628
So by the time I was 12,
he had me fluent in French,
Spanish, and Italian.

104
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,587
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

105
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,852
If I could just read
Dante's Inferno
in the original Italian,

106
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:06,203
my life would be
complete, I think.
I get that a lot.

107
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:09,729
Really?
No. No, I've never
gotten that before.

108
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:18,041
That's some pretty old gear
you got there.
You don't shoot digital?

109
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:21,566
No, I don't.
I get a much higher
dynamic range on film.

110
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,920
Plus, I'm also
kind of addicted to the
smell of the developing
chemicals.

111
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:29,400
The fumes make me
a little delirious.
[laughs]

112
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:31,925
Kind of like what your eyes
are doing to me right now.

113
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,405
Ooh.

114
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,798

00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:37,452
[both chuckle]

116
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:39,933
That was really cheesy.
No, no.

117
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,500
It was... It was...

118
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:44,328
a little cheesy, yeah.

119
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,289
It sounded perfect
in my head.

120
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:51,858
Oh, okay. Then let me
imagine that for a sec,
okay.
Okay.

121
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:55,644
Still bad?
It's worse, actually.

122
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:57,472

00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,741

125
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,308
Yeah, me too.

126
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,314
Um, thank you for letting me

127
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:17,579
whisper in your ear
for three hours.

My name is...
It's Skylar.

00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:40,689
I'm Tessa.

132
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:43,866
Maybe I'll see you here
again sometime.

133
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:45,607
Yeah, I'd like that.

134
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:51,918

to show you something.

Sky!

145
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:36,544
Bad dream.

146
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,157
You called out his name.

147
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:45,248
It's called a visitation
dream. We see lots of 'em
around here.

148
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,598
It's all part
of the grieving process.

149
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:50,558
I know. It just felt
like Skylar was really here.

150
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:54,170
Doris would love
to hear about that.
Who's Doris?

151
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:57,913
A patient writing a book
on the afterlife.
Okay.

152
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,872
The other day,
she offered to read my aura.

153
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,483
I politely declined.

154
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:08,315
What is that?
Your belongings
from the crash.

155
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:10,534
They closed
the accident report already?

156
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:13,233
Well, neither driver
had drugs or alcohol
in their system.

157
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:15,278
That's usually
the end of it.

158
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,889
They never even
interviewed me.

159
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,285
You said you didn't remember
anything about the accident?

160
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:28,030
I don't.
Maybe that's for the best.

161
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:49,443
[Dr. Sarkisian]
I'm very encouraged, Tessa.

162
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:50,966
The scan shows
your right ventricle

163
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,968
is functioning quite well,
despite the tear.

164
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,970
Finally, some good news.

165
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,928
It is more than good.

166
00:16:56,972 --> 00:17:00,019
Ninety-nine out of 100
with this same injury
die on my table.

167
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,411
I did die.

168
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,413
Only for a short time.

169
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:06,416
I could see Skylar.

170
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,551
Like, he was in this...
this crazy white light.

171
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:12,901
What is that?
Was she, you know,
hallucinating?

172
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:15,034
When the body undergoes
severe trauma...

173
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,427
[heartbeat thumping]
...the hypothalamus
can flood the brain

174
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:20,387
with pain relieving endorphins.

So when can we take her
home?

175
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,521
[Dr. Sarkisian] End of the
week. Tessa needs to be
extremely careful these next
few months.

176
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:26,480
Any chest pains
or shortness of breath,

177
00:17:26,523 --> 00:17:29,961
you call 911 immediately.
Understand?

178
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:32,225
[shower running]

179
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:35,228
[heartbeat thumping]

180
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,734
[crying]

181
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:15,616
[crying continues]

182
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:18,314
[knocking on door]

183
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:26,366
Jazz? Just give me a second.

184
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,370
Jazz?

185
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:41,207
[electrical crackling]

186
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:46,168
[phone chimes, buzzes]

187
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:14,501
[Skylar]
You watch, I'll translate.

188
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:26,165
[indistinct PA announcement]

189
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,267
Hi, excuse me.
Are you Doris?

190
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,706
[exhales] I am going to take
a wild guess here.

191
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:53,061
Room B424,
girl with the broken heart?

192
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:56,717
[laughing] Relax.

193
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,718
I'm not psychic.

194
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:01,200
Jasmine told me you might
come looking for me.
Oh.

195
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:04,638
My condolences.

196
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:06,335
Thank you.

197
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:07,989
Are your hands injured?

198
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,077
Excuse me?

199
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:12,646
From the accident.
Did you hurt
your hands at all?

200
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:15,779
No, why?
Ta-da! Huh?

201
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:18,913
Oh, come on. Come on.
[chuckles]

202
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,004
So, what is your book about?

203
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:25,528
It's about ADC's.

204
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:27,574
After Death Communication.

205
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:32,318
Okay, so you believe that
dead people can contact us?

206
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:35,146
Along with billions
of other people

207
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,846
from faiths
that span the globe.

208
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:43,633
Sometimes, the departed,

209
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:47,811
they call out
to us in voice.

210
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:54,949
And other times, we can
smell their cologne or
perfume in the air.

211
00:20:56,342 --> 00:21:00,650
No matter how they
communicate, the message is
the same.

212
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:03,479
"I'm still here.

213
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:06,134
And your grief,
like a beacon,

214
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:07,918
calls me to your side."

215
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:12,662
And when the separation
has been traumatic,

216
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:14,882
like with you
and your boyfriend,

217
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:17,928
there's often
unfinished business.

218
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,714
Like regrets or something?

219
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:25,109
Like things left undone
or unsaid.

220
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:26,807
[door opens]
[Vickie] Tessa.

221
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,983
We signed you out.
It's time to go.

222
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:32,029
He's in the in-between.

223
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:35,250
But he won't be there for
long, a few weeks at most.

224
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,991
And when he moves on...

225
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:40,342
he's gone for good.

226
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:43,040
I gotta go.
Oh, wait, wait.

227
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,652
Here, take this.
It's my first book.

228
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:47,915
It's a good place
to start.
That's okay.

229
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:50,657
He's reaching out to you.

230
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:53,660
Reach back.

231
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,054
It's too late for that.

232
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,895
[teacher]
Tessa, you're up.

233
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:15,551
[clears throat]

234
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,392
Um, this is a photo that
I took back in February.

235
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:33,874
Is that how you spend
your free time,
taking pictures of trees?

236
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:37,399
Well, it's actually
not a tree, asshole.

237
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,096
[class laughs]
It's a cell phone tower,

238
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,576
disguised as a tree.

239
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,408
It is an allegory
for the artificiality
of modern life.

240
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,802
[school bell rings]

241
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:53,241
It's a lovely photo, Tessa.

242
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:55,635
Your technical skills have
taken huge leaps this year.

243
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:57,767
Oh, thank you.
I know you're
still a junior,

244
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:01,162
but I think you have a good
shot of getting into the
Rhode Island School of
Design.

245
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:03,251
I'd be happy to write you
a letter of recommendation.

246
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:05,862
Thank you. I just--
My work's not ready
for that yet.

247
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:08,735
Oh? What do you feel
is missing?

248
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:10,824
Just like a point of view.

249
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,913
You know, something to say
that's my own.

250
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:16,612
Well, maybe it's time
for your subject matter
to evolve.

251
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:19,963
After all,
there is something notably
missing from all your
photos.

252
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,574
Yeah, I know. Color.

253
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:24,228
No. People.

254
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:27,449
You know, Tessa, before
an artist can find her
voice,

255
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:29,712
she has to find
a subject she loves.

256
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:32,759
Who or what
do you love, Tessa?

257
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,023
["Closer" playing]

258
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:46,599
[Skylar]
I should probably...

259
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:48,252
Yeah, me too.

260
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:55,102
Hey, okay.
What do you think?

261
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:58,888
Red?
Noisy colors
are trendy.

262
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:03,763
I don't know. I feel like
you're kind of taking
advantage of your dad's
niceness.

263
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:06,548
Of course, I am.
My dad is putty when
I get straight A's.

264
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,158
Hey, yo, Tess!

265
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:11,988
Hi, Cortez.
Hey, uh, do you have
plans this weekend?

266
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:16,515
As it happens, I actually
work as Tessa's full-time
scheduler,

267
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,344
so I can say, with
absolute authority, that
she does not have any plans

268
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:22,477
this weekend.
What are you saying?
What are you doing?

269
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,740
Well, the final crew meet
of the season is this
Saturday.

270
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:27,700
I was kind of wondering
if you 'd come out
and take some photos.

271
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:31,225
Uh, sorry. I don't really do
sports photography.

272
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:34,576
But if you glue
a selfie stick to your
forehead, it might be the
same thing.

273
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,317
Will Judd be there?

274
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:41,452
Well, wherever I go,
my rowing partner goes,
so...

275
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:42,932
Then we'll be there.

276
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,108
"We" will be there?

277
00:25:45,152 --> 00:25:47,197
I'll be there as your photo
assistant, remember?

278
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:48,503
I'm her photo assistant.

279
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,679
Well, the first race
starts at30.

280
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:53,813
In the morning?
He didn't mean morning,
did he?

281
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:55,075
[Tessa]
Yup, he did.

282
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,783
[spectators cheering]

283
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:11,308
Do you think Judd
can see me from here?

284
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:14,834
Hey!
You are fired.
Give me this.

285
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:17,576
Assistanting is
not my thing. My bad.

286
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,187
You were the one
who dragged me out here.
So behave, please.

287
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,276
[announcer]
Racers, starting positions.

288
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,930
Ready your marks.

289
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:27,977
Row!

290
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:31,067
[air horn blows]
[rowers grunting]

291
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,035

[spectators cheering]

294
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:11,341
Whoo! Whoo!
Yeah!

295
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,565
[both laughing]
Yes!

296
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,132
Whoo!

297
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,658
[Shannon]
You never said he was hot.

298
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,488
Yes, I did.
No, you said he was cute.

299
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:32,754
Emojis are cute.
That guy is like melting
my sunglasses, Tess.

300
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:36,366
I think I'm gonna go.
Are you crazy?

301
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:40,544
You've been obsessed
about this guy for like
months, and you're just
gonna ditch?

302
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:44,244
I don't know what
to say to him.
"Hold me."

303
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:46,420
He just won the race.
Congratulate him.

304
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:48,378
Okay.

305
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:52,078
Can I put this on my Story?

306
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:54,341
If you wanna die.

307
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,618
Tessa! Hey-- Oh!

308
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:13,099
Oh, my God! Sorry.
Whoa, whoa!

309
00:29:13,142 --> 00:29:17,103
My legs are always
Jell-O after races.

310
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:20,628
I can't believe
that you're a...

311
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:21,977
A jock?

312
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:23,805
A jock, yeah!

313
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:26,765
Jocks don't speak
Spanish, French and Italian.

314
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,071
Hey, this one does.
Well, they definitely
don't read

315
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:31,682
Jane Austin and
Emily Bronteë.

316
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:34,947
I have a thing
for happy endings.
Skylar!

317
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,297
Oh, shit. Here we go. Um...

318
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:42,693
That is what I
call a finish.

319
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:43,912
Thanks, Mom.

320
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:46,872
Um...
Movie theater girl.

321
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:49,875
Her name is Tessa.
How did you...

322
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:53,530
The blue eyes.
Skylar went on and on
about them.

323
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:57,404
Wow, Mom! Does anyone see
a deep, dark hole
I can crawl into?

324
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:59,710
[Leigh] You know,
he spent weeks searching
for you on the Internet.

325
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:02,409
Mom...
[Leigh] And he couldn't find
a thing about you.

326
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:04,541
Well, that is by design.
[phone ringing]

327
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:06,500
Told you.
She's analog. Like me.

328
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:09,503
[sighs] Your father
is driving me crazy.

329
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:12,071
Talk to him, Mom.
Tell him-- Tell him I won.

330
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:16,249
No. You can talk to him
yourself later. Are you
going to be heading back to
Edison tonight?

331
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:20,296
No, I'm gonna be staying
at Grandpa Mike's. Um...

332
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,867
But first, I was gonna see
if Tessa maybe wanted to
go...

333
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:27,173
Chill out and hang?

334
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:28,870
[softly] Oh, my God.

335
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:30,916
Movie theater
girl would love

336
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:33,919
to chill out and hang.
[Leigh chuckles]

337
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:35,529
All right. Bye.
Thanks.

338
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:38,227
[footsteps departing]
Thank you, Mom.

339
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:40,882
That's my mom.
She does, uh, parties.

340
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:43,363
[laughs]

341
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:47,149
[horn honks]

342
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,553
I can put the top up
if you want.

343
00:30:59,596 --> 00:31:02,904
[laughing] No, it's okay.
It feels really good.

344
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:09,911
[sighs] You look amazing.

345
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:13,306
Say it in French.

346
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:16,222
[speaking French]

347
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:19,355
You too.

348
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,271
Um...

349
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:25,448
You don't have
a girlfriend, do you?

350
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:28,103
No. Not since
the eighth grade. Why?

351
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:30,889
This kinda looks like you.

352
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:32,716
[laughs] No. That is, uh...

353
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,503
That's my mom and dad
when they were teenagers.
Oh!

354
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:39,375
Yeah, this is actually
the same Jeep that my
grandpa

355
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,769
bought my mom
for her 18th birthday.

356
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:44,511
You can actually see it
behind them in the photo.

357
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:47,949
Oh, yeah! They're so cute.
They look so in love.

358
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:50,212
Yeah, they were.
"They were"?

359
00:31:50,256 --> 00:31:52,084
Are. They are.

360
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:55,130
My dad's just
living and teaching in
Oregon right now.

361
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:59,961
That's pretty far.
Are they, like, taking
a break or something?

362
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:01,397
No.

363
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:07,316
They're gonna be fine.
They talk almost
every day, so...

364
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:13,148
Some music.

365
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:15,150
Whoa!
If you wanna
take a look.

366
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,371
[gasps] What?

367
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:22,723
Yeah, it's my mom's entire
high school playlist.

368
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:25,595
New Order. Cake. Bush.

369
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:26,988
Echo and the Bunnymen.

370
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:28,598
Your mom's like
my new bestie.

371
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,259
Your dad made
her a mix tape?

372
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:39,087
Yes, he did.

373
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:42,569
Can I play it?

374
00:32:49,358 --> 00:32:51,621
It's the other way.
[both chuckle]

375
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:57,279
It's okay. I won't tell
the '80s police.
Shut up.

376
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:33,663
I have spent every summer
of my life down here
with my grandfather.

377
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:35,535
How have I never
heard of this place?

378
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:37,754
Well, that's my favorite
part about taking photos.

379
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:41,889
It's like you just
stumble and wander
and find places like this.

380
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:46,459
Right. But what...
what drew you
to this spot specifically?

381
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:48,417
The view.

382
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:51,377
That view.

383
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,900
[seagulls squawking]

384
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:54,771
It was called
The Empyrean.

385
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:58,340
It was a honeymooners'
resort back in the '60s.

386
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:01,474
It's so surreal.
It's unbelievable.

387
00:34:03,345 --> 00:34:04,651
You've gone in there?

388
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:06,740
Unarmed?

389
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:09,525
I'll do anything
for a great photo.

390
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:13,486
"Empyrean"?

391
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:16,184
That's where Dante
meets God, right?

392
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:19,274
Highest of all heavens.
A place of pure love.

393
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:24,105
Look at it. If that's
not a metaphor for love,
then I don't know what is.

394
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:27,500
Can I see your photos?

395
00:34:28,892 --> 00:34:31,678
They're not on my phone.
I don't shoot digital,
remember?

396
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:33,897
Well, how do people
see your work?

397
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:37,945
I don't show it,
unless I have to for class.

398
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:39,468
How come?

399
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:41,427
'Cause I'm not
good enough yet.

400
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,559
I find that
seriously difficult
to believe.

401
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:48,825
Okay, so if you won't
show me your photos,

402
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:52,264
maybe you can
give me a tour.
Of The Empyrean?

403
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:54,353
Yeah, show it to me.

404
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,793
I wanna see it, you know,
through your eyes.

405
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:01,795
["Never Tear Us Apart"
playing]

406
00:35:02,752 --> 00:35:05,015
[both laughing]

407
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:18,899
[tennis ball thwacking]
[both grunting]

408
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:56,980
[piano keys playing]

409
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:08,775
Do you know how to waltz?

410
00:36:09,776 --> 00:36:12,605
No.
Okay, just step back
this way.

411
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:15,782
Okay.
And then
your back foot forward.

412
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:20,700
And then it's like
one, two, three.
Straighten your leg.

413
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:24,660
One, two, three.

414
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,184
Okay.

415
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,015
And then you have to
put your chin up
and then lead.

416
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:35,541
Like you don't want
to pay any attention
to the other person.

417
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:38,065
Don't slip.
[both laughing]

418
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:45,420
You know it's true

419
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:48,510
Worlds collided

420
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:52,558
We're shining through

421
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:07,660
Do you want to see
what it's like to be
inside of a camera?

422
00:37:07,703 --> 00:37:09,792
Yeah.
Okay. Close the door.

423
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,983
It works just like
a camera lens.

424
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:28,550
I kind of made it myself.

425
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:29,725
Whoa.

426
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:33,468
It's beautiful.

427
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:35,905
Yeah.

428
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:37,951
[playing harmonica]

429
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:48,483
I mean,
it's pretty good, right?

430
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:52,748
Ooh, I mean, it's obvious
you just haven't been
playing that long.

431
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:55,751
Just three years.
Oh.

432
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:58,232
Should have heard me
back then.

433
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,278
[both laughing]

434
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:08,895
Can you hear them?

435
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:11,637
Hear who?

436
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:15,467
The ghosts of
newlyweds past.

437
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:18,905
No. What are they saying?

438
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:22,735
Well, the groom,
he's saying...

439
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:27,000
[in deep voice]
Come on, honey.

440
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:31,831
You've been in the bathroom
for two hours now.

441
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,486
It's time to come to bed.
You're my wife.

442
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:38,359
What does the bride say?

443
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:43,059
Well, the bride
is saying, um...

444
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:47,542
But you haven't even
kissed me yet.

445
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:32,935
Okay.
You want me to walk you
to your door

446
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:36,983
so your parents don't think
I'm a... taxidermist?

447
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:38,071
What?

448
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:43,206
Or like someone--
a serial killer?

449
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:47,515
That's okay.
Um, they're not
my parents, actually.

450
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:52,607
I, uh... I'm just
a genetic stranger
that lives under their roof.

451
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:55,784
"A genetic stranger"?

452
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:58,961
Yeah, it's, uh...
It's a long story.

453
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:01,790
For another time.

454
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,187
When can I see you again?

455
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:12,627
Um, well, when are you
back in Avalon?

456
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:13,976
End of the month.

457
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,978
And how long are you
gonna be here for?

458
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,068
The whole summer.

459
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:22,420
I'm staying with my grandpa
until I leave for Brown.

460
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:24,900
You're going to Brown? What?

461
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,990
I just kissed
an Ivy League bro?

462
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:30,993
[gasps]
[laughs]
Your street cred ruined?

463
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:33,474
Only if you tell me
that you're also a
lifeguard.

464
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:35,041
Yeah.

465
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:37,957
Are you serious?
Mm-hmm.

466
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,961
About three summers now
at Washington Avenue Beach.

467
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:44,920
No! Why?

468
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:54,147
Good night.
Good night.

469
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:15,516
[heartbeat thumping]

470
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,097
[sniffles]

471
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:35,623
[continues crying softly]

472
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:43,413
Do I need to kick
this guy's ass?

473
00:41:43,457 --> 00:41:44,893
No, she's just scared.

474
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:45,938
Why?

475
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:47,940
Because she likes him.

476
00:41:56,775 --> 00:41:58,603
[shutter clicks]

477
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:07,176
[Vickie] Tessa?

478
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,572
[footsteps approaching]

479
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:14,096
Shannon's waiting.

480
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,752
Okay, I'm coming.

481
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,066
Hey, what's that?

482
00:42:27,936 --> 00:42:30,939
That is four
A's, one A-minus.

483
00:42:30,983 --> 00:42:32,593
Don't want to talk about it.

484
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:35,901
I'm gonna tint the windows,
so no one knows it's me
inside.

485
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:39,034
Geez, stop whining.
It's a car.

486
00:42:39,078 --> 00:42:40,906
So did you call
the phone company?

487
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,648
Yeah.
And?

488
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:48,566
You were right. They just
said that Skylar probably
sent the photo before the
accident

489
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:52,308
and then it got stuck
in the server or something.

490
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:59,402
But that doesn't explain
why my phone just turned on
after it was completely
trashed.

491
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:00,795
Can you explain that?

492
00:43:02,536 --> 00:43:03,711
I can't. No.

493
00:43:05,408 --> 00:43:06,801
[sighs]

494
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:08,934
Hey.

495
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:11,893
It's totally normal
to read into things.

496
00:43:11,937 --> 00:43:14,722
My mom did the same thing
after her sister died.

497
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:17,986
Every rainbow was a sign.

498
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:20,641
Every butterfly
was a message from heaven.

499
00:43:21,555 --> 00:43:23,688
[door opens]

500
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,783
Meet my computer on wheels.

501
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:38,137
[Shannon] Shit.

502
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:41,793
Sorry. You put it
on my Spotify.

503
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:43,577
It's okay.

504
00:43:44,883 --> 00:43:46,319
[music stops]

505
00:43:48,538 --> 00:43:49,757
Hey.

506
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:52,934
Talk to me, Tess.

507
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:57,330
I can't believe he's gone.

508
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,202
It's like I close my eyes

509
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:03,466
and I see us meeting
for the first time.

510
00:44:04,337 --> 00:44:06,774
And I remember every word
that he said to me.

511
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:11,431
I remember every expression
on his face.

512
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,434
And then I open my eyes
and it's like...

513
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:18,786
Did I, like, just dream
our entire relationship up?

514
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,223
Did I dream him up?
Hey. I was there.

515
00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:23,661
He wasn't a dream, okay?

516
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:26,838
Your head's just
a little scrambled.

517
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:31,059
That happens when
two tons of metal comes
crashing into you.

518
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,714
I don't even remember
the last thing I said to
him.

519
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:35,194
Come on.
I'm serious.

520
00:44:36,804 --> 00:44:39,328
We were fighting
that last week, remember?

521
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,896
Hey.

522
00:44:42,592 --> 00:44:45,770
You guys had an epic summer.

523
00:44:45,813 --> 00:44:49,817
One that you will
never forget.
Yeah.

524
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:52,864
Damn, I won't forget it,
and I was just
a jealous bystander.

525
00:44:52,907 --> 00:44:54,517
[laughing]

526
00:44:56,432 --> 00:44:57,999
Oh, my God.

527
00:44:59,348 --> 00:45:03,613
It's my first day back,
and I look like a total
mess.

528
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:05,006
Yeah. You do.

529
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:08,053
[laughing]
You do, yeah.

530
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:10,708
[school bell ringing]

531
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:29,465
[phone chimes]

532
00:45:44,132 --> 00:45:45,917
I heard about
what happened, Tessa.

533
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,570
I'm terribly sorry.

534
00:45:49,572 --> 00:45:52,271
If you were my daughter,
I'd tell you to use it.

535
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:54,708
Use it?

536
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,362
The pain, the emptiness.

537
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:58,581
Channel it,
through your camera.

538
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:02,672
Some of the greatest works
of art were produced
by intense grief.

539
00:46:02,716 --> 00:46:05,023
Okay.
Tessa.

540
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:07,590
RISD portfolio day
is right around the corner.

541
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:08,853
Thank you.

542
00:46:10,811 --> 00:46:13,640
[seagulls squawking]

543

["Perfect Day" playing]

544
00:47:31,152 --> 00:47:32,501
[Mel] So that's it?

545
00:47:33,285 --> 00:47:35,809
You're just giving up
your photography?

546
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,158
It sure looks like it.

547
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:39,987
This is the same crap
your mom used to pull.

548
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,641
She'd become obsessed
with things.

549
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:43,861
Baking, yoga, pottery.

550
00:47:44,426 --> 00:47:47,429
One day, lose interest,
move on to the next.

551
00:47:48,256 --> 00:47:51,477
That's why she could never
get any traction in life.

552
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:54,001
Are you done?

553
00:47:56,134 --> 00:47:58,266
You think Skylar
would have wanted this?

554
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:00,355
I don't know.

555
00:48:01,704 --> 00:48:04,055
Why don't you go ask him?

556
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:14,543
[sighs]

557
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,223
[Skylar] It's okay.
I won't tell the '80s
police.
[Tessa] Shut up. [laughs]

558
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:45,357
[heartbeat thumping]

559
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:22,568
I'm still here, Tess.

560
00:49:31,794 --> 00:49:33,057

[Vickie] Tess?
I'm sleeping.

564
00:49:48,942 --> 00:49:52,206
I just did a double shift.
You were asleep when I left.

565
00:49:53,686 --> 00:49:55,470
Did you even eat anything?

566
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:57,559
I'm not hungry.

567
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:01,041
Can you please
just let me sleep?

568
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:02,651

[harmonica music

577
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:22,460
Hi.

578
00:53:51,184 --> 00:53:54,274
[indistinct PA announcement]

579
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:56,929
Tessa?
Uh, I gotta talk to Doris.

580
00:53:56,972 --> 00:53:59,975
Hang on a second.
Let me-- Wait, Tessa.

581
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:03,501
What--
Her family took her home
this morning.

582
00:54:04,371 --> 00:54:07,156
There was nothing
more we could do.
Are you okay, honey?

583
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,681
Um, I just haven't--
I haven't eaten today.

584
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:12,379
Um--
You know what,
let me check you out.

585
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:15,382
Why do you need to talk
to Doris so bad?
It's just--

586
00:54:15,426 --> 00:54:18,646
It's about what
she was telling me before.
It's about the afterlife.

587
00:54:20,518 --> 00:54:23,825
Maybe that old coot
isn't so crazy after all.

588
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:26,828
What do you mean?
Your heartbeat is fast,
but it sounds healthy.

589
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:29,962
Wait, what do you--
What were you saying?
What do you mean?

590
00:54:30,571 --> 00:54:32,660
Doris told me you'd
come looking for her.

591
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:35,446
She even left you something.

592
00:54:36,142 --> 00:54:37,622
Her book.

593
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:45,630
Tessa, I have seen a lot
of dying and grieving
in my time here.

594
00:54:45,673 --> 00:54:47,806
Looking back
never helped anyone.

595
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:50,069
There's either life
or there's death.

596
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:52,898
There's no place in-between.

597
00:54:53,638 --> 00:54:55,335
I'm gonna find him.

598
00:54:56,467 --> 00:55:01,210
[Doris on video]
What does the in-between
look like?

599
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:08,087
Well, we as living beings
can never imagine it.
We have no reference.

600
00:55:08,653 --> 00:55:14,615
It would be like trying
to describe a sunset
to a blind man.

601
00:55:16,225 --> 00:55:21,492
Technological advances
have made ghost-hunting
a legitimate field.

602
00:55:21,535 --> 00:55:27,280
My friend Darlene,
she let me borrow her
full-spectrum digital
camera.

well beyond the human eye,

00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,732
Well, happy Fourth of July.

607
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,301
I don't know. I actually
kind of like this weather.
Don't call me.

608
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,912
So, you think this means
the fireworks are canceled?

609
00:55:50,956 --> 00:55:53,393
I think so, yeah.
Yeah.

610
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:56,004
Hey.
Hey.

611
00:55:57,223 --> 00:55:58,833
You okay?
Yeah.

612
00:55:58,877 --> 00:56:01,575
Skylar, Tess says
you're going to Brown.

613
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:03,664
Congrats!
Thank you.

614
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:05,013
What are you gonna study?

615
00:56:05,057 --> 00:56:07,886
Probably Latin.
That'll come in handy.

616
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:11,280
You never know
when you're gonna meet
the Pope or something.

617
00:56:11,324 --> 00:56:13,065
Or need to conduct
an exorcism.

618
00:56:13,108 --> 00:56:14,980
Nice. That's nice.

619
00:56:15,023 --> 00:56:18,418
I don't know. I just don't
want to have any regrets,
you know?

620
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:20,159
I wanna live a bunch
of different lives.

621
00:56:20,202 --> 00:56:22,291
What's the point of speaking
all these languages

622
00:56:22,335 --> 00:56:25,033
if I'm not gonna travel
the world and use them,
you know?

623
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:32,127
Let's go.
We are going to watch
the fireworks on TV.

624
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:34,521
Are your parents home?

625
00:56:37,263 --> 00:56:38,743
Do you want
to talk about it?

626
00:56:40,222 --> 00:56:41,528
Not really.

627
00:56:41,572 --> 00:56:42,790
Okay.

628
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:49,188
My mom filed
for divorce today.

629
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:53,279
I'm really sorry.

630
00:56:54,149 --> 00:56:58,545
You know,
I know this doesn't
help right now, but...

631
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,243
just because
they're splitting up

632
00:57:01,287 --> 00:57:03,637
that doesn't mean that
they don't care
about each other.

633
00:57:03,681 --> 00:57:05,334
It means they've given up.

634
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,730
I don't think that's fair.
Fair to who? You or them?

635
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:14,822
[sighs] When you're
rowing a race and you get
to the last 20 meters,

636
00:57:17,782 --> 00:57:20,262
your entire body
is telling you to stop.

637
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:25,311
Your muscles are on fire.
Your lungs are screaming at
you.

638
00:57:26,181 --> 00:57:30,098
Everything inside you
wants to quit,
make the pain go away.

639
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,711
But if you want to win,

640
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:38,193
that's exactly
when you dig deeper
and you row harder.

641
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:40,718
You really don't like
to let things go, do you?

642
00:57:40,761 --> 00:57:43,198
You noticed?
[laughs]

643
00:57:46,288 --> 00:57:47,551

[sighs]

646
00:57:57,561 --> 00:58:00,912
You're just starting
to make me believe
in happy endings.

647
00:58:19,757 --> 00:58:22,368
Oh, no! The photo! No.
Oh, oh...

648
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:25,066
What?
It's totally ruined.
It's totally ruined.

649
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,068
Now you see why I don't
let anyone up here.

650
00:58:27,112 --> 00:58:29,941
I am pretty amazed
that you've let me
into your inner sanctum.

651
00:58:29,984 --> 00:58:32,944
Yeah, well,
if you tell anyone,

652
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:34,641
I'll poison you.

653
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:41,387
Oh, you don't have to...

654
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:44,651
Hmm?
You don't have to look
through that.

655
00:58:44,695 --> 00:58:47,219
No, no, no. Okay.
Yeah.

656
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:52,006
It's cool.

657
00:59:13,288 --> 00:59:14,768
I like this one.

658
00:59:22,863 --> 00:59:25,562
That's, um--
That's a cell phone tower.

659
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:29,087
Yeah.
It's an allegory

660
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:34,005
for something--
technology co-opting
our natural environment.

661
00:59:47,627 --> 00:59:48,889
Really?

662
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:50,935
Really.

663
00:59:53,067 --> 00:59:57,637
I know you hate compliments,
but this work is incredible.

664
00:59:57,681 --> 01:00:01,162
I'm serious. It's like
you can see things
that no one else can.

665
01:00:01,206 --> 01:00:04,252
That just shows
how much you know
about photography.

666
01:00:04,296 --> 01:00:06,037
[laughs]

667
01:00:06,994 --> 01:00:08,735
I mean, I think
you can sell this stuff.

668
01:00:08,779 --> 01:00:11,433
Maybe on Etsy.

669
01:00:11,956 --> 01:00:14,045
There is something
that's missing

670
01:00:14,088 --> 01:00:16,221
from like all
of your photos.

671
01:00:16,264 --> 01:00:17,657
Yeah, I know.
It's color.

672
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:19,920
No. You.

673
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:25,012
I just don't really think
the world needs another
selfie.

674
01:00:25,056 --> 01:00:28,581
Oh, come on. What is wrong
with stepping in front of
the camera every once in
awhile.

675
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,976
I believe that a
photographer should point
her lens outward,

676
01:00:32,803 --> 01:00:34,674
toward the world.
Yeah?

677
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:36,850
Yeah, so you can try
and understand it.

678
01:00:36,894 --> 01:00:38,896
What about trying
to understand yourself?

679
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:42,377
If you had my past,
you wouldn't ask that
question.

680
01:00:43,335 --> 01:00:44,902
You ever gonna
tell me about it?

681
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:48,209
[chuckles]

682
01:00:49,471 --> 01:00:50,472
[sighs]

683
01:00:51,386 --> 01:00:53,040
Come on.
I'll walk you home.

684
01:00:54,694 --> 01:01:00,439
I never met my real father.
He ran off before I was
born.

685
01:01:00,482 --> 01:01:03,094
And my mom...

686
01:01:03,137 --> 01:01:07,402
The kind way to describe her
would be flaky.

687
01:01:08,926 --> 01:01:11,276
Wow.
Instead of
counting sheep

688
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:13,060
to go to sleep
when I was a kid,

689
01:01:13,104 --> 01:01:15,410
I would count her fiancés.

690
01:01:16,977 --> 01:01:18,631
And Mel was
one of them?

691
01:01:19,371 --> 01:01:21,286
Yeah, he was
the last one.

692
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:26,726
Her final victim before
she ghosted us for good.

693
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,989
And that's when
he took you in?

694
01:01:29,555 --> 01:01:31,557
Well, he tried,
but the court,

695
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,386
they just didn't really
look too kindly on
a middle-aged bachelor

696
01:01:34,429 --> 01:01:36,388
wanting to adopt
a young girl.

697
01:01:36,431 --> 01:01:39,217
So then where did you go?

698
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:41,610
Ah, Family Services.

699
01:01:42,089 --> 01:01:43,264
Foster care.

700
01:01:45,136 --> 01:01:46,093
Oh.

701
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,922
You know how you said
that I notice things

702
01:01:48,966 --> 01:01:50,619
that no one else does?

703
01:01:50,663 --> 01:01:52,273
Mm-hmm.

704
01:01:52,317 --> 01:01:56,103
When you live with strangers
who can hurt you,

705
01:01:56,147 --> 01:01:57,975
and I bounced around a lot,

706
01:01:58,018 --> 01:02:01,630
you have to really just
observe everything.

707
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:04,721
When you're a foster kid,
you learn the hard way to...

708
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:07,767
Never put your guard down?

709
01:02:09,334 --> 01:02:10,727
Yeah.

710
01:02:11,162 --> 01:02:13,425
Anyway, about a year ago,
Mel and Vickie got married

711
01:02:13,468 --> 01:02:15,949
and then the court
let them take me in.

712
01:02:15,993 --> 01:02:18,517
So that's why you call
yourself a genetic stranger?

713
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:23,827
[buzzing, clicking]

714
01:02:25,045 --> 01:02:27,831
I did that.
[scoffs]

715
01:02:27,874 --> 01:02:30,137
["One Day" playing]

716
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:00,515
[Vickie] Good God.

717
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:04,084
How early is it?
Super early.

718
01:03:04,737 --> 01:03:07,958
A little splash
of almond milk, right?

719
01:03:11,744 --> 01:03:13,050
Uh, yeah.

720
01:03:16,662 --> 01:03:18,011
I like your necklace.

721
01:03:18,055 --> 01:03:20,013
Yeah? Shannon
lent it to me.

722
01:03:21,188 --> 01:03:25,889
You know, if you ever
want to borrow anything from
me, clothes or makeup,
jewelry...

723
01:03:25,932 --> 01:03:27,499
All righty.

724
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:30,067
I'll see you later, Vick.

725
01:03:33,984 --> 01:03:35,246
See ya.

726
01:03:54,004 --> 01:03:55,440
[shutter clicks]

727
01:04:00,662 --> 01:04:03,361
When a rower dies,
this is what heaven looks
like.

728
01:04:03,404 --> 01:04:08,975
For me, heaven is
Paris in the rain.
Like cobblestone streets.

729
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:10,411
Yeah?
Yeah.

730
01:04:10,455 --> 01:04:13,806
Is everything
in black and white?

731
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,895
Get out of my head.

732
01:04:17,288 --> 01:04:20,508
You ever been? To Paris?

733
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:21,596
Someday.

734
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,294
Avec moi?

735
01:04:24,295 --> 01:04:27,037
I guess I could use
a translator.

736
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:33,826
My parents had
their honeymoon there.

737
01:04:34,696 --> 01:04:36,873
So I've been saving up
to send them

738
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:38,700
for their 25th anniversary.

739
01:04:39,701 --> 01:04:43,270
What if they
don't want to go?
I mean, who doesn't want
to go to Paris?

740
01:04:43,314 --> 01:04:45,751
Yeah, but what if they don't
want to go with each other?

741
01:04:46,317 --> 01:04:49,450
It's not a crime
to fall out of love,
you know.

742
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:51,539
Tessa.
Hmm?

743
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:52,889
Love never dies.

744
01:04:55,717 --> 01:04:56,936
What?

745
01:04:58,764 --> 01:05:02,028
You just sound like someone
who's never been hurt by
life.

746
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:05,379
You putting me on notice?

747
01:05:05,423 --> 01:05:07,164
[laughs] No.

748
01:05:12,647 --> 01:05:14,345
Um, what the hell is that?

749
01:05:14,388 --> 01:05:15,694
This...

750
01:05:17,783 --> 01:05:20,699
is a rowboat.
I'm assuming you want me
to get in that?

751
01:05:20,742 --> 01:05:24,007
You are getting
in this with me.
No.

752
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:27,358
We spent four hours
in your dark room
doing what you love to do.

753
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:29,186
Let me show you
what I love to do.

754
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:32,058
[birds squawking,
chittering]

755
01:05:32,102 --> 01:05:34,756
[Tessa] Hands under your...
Thumbs there.
[Skylar] Thumbs here.

756
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,325
And then it's gonna go
simple like that.
You press it down.

757
01:05:38,369 --> 01:05:41,676
Okay.
And then you tilt it
and then you pull it.

758
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,462
Hmm.
And then you're
pressing down,

759
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:46,594
tilt it,
and then pull it.

760
01:05:46,638 --> 01:05:49,206
Okay, I'm gonna try
and go forward again.
All right.

761
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:50,729
Don't help me.
I won't.

762
01:05:50,772 --> 01:05:53,123
I won't. You've got this.
You've got this.

763
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,776
[exhales sharply]

764
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,256
[Tessa] Oh, my God!

765
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,432
This is awful.
[Skylar laughs]

766
01:05:58,476 --> 01:06:01,174
Oh, I'm tired now.
You're flying!

767
01:06:01,218 --> 01:06:04,264
[Skylar playing harmonica]

768
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:31,161
I love you, Tessa.

769
01:06:37,254 --> 01:06:39,517
[stammers softly]

770
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,008
We should probably
head back, yeah?

771
01:07:05,369 --> 01:07:07,632
[slow pop music playing]

772
01:07:31,656 --> 01:07:33,701
[moans softly]

773
01:07:57,986 --> 01:08:00,206
[students chattering]

774
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:05,385
Hey.

775
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:11,913
"The in-between"?

776
01:08:11,957 --> 01:08:13,480
That's just what
Doris calls it,

777
01:08:13,524 --> 01:08:15,917
but every culture
has its own version of it.

778
01:08:15,961 --> 01:08:19,095
So, it's where we go
after we die.

779
01:08:19,138 --> 01:08:21,271
Not me. I'm going
to Jamaica.

780
01:08:21,314 --> 01:08:23,099
I'm serious, Shannon.

781
01:08:23,142 --> 01:08:25,275
It's like a waiting room
for our souls.

782
01:08:25,318 --> 01:08:26,972
Okay, so you think Skylar

783
01:08:27,015 --> 01:08:29,757
is reaching out to you
from this waiting room?

784
01:08:29,801 --> 01:08:33,544
They were color photos,
Shannon. I don't...
I don't shoot in color.

785
01:08:33,587 --> 01:08:36,155
I don't even own
the chemicals to develop it.

786
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:39,506
But you can't show me
the photos?
No, I told you.

787
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:41,813
The fixer didn't work.
I don't know why.

788
01:08:41,856 --> 01:08:46,296
But maybe spirits
can't be captured on film
or something. I don't know.

789
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:48,385
All right.

790
01:08:50,561 --> 01:08:52,606
Tess, I want
to believe you,
I swear,

791
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:56,306
but messages
from the other side?

792
01:08:57,524 --> 01:08:59,657
I just think he wants
the same thing I want.

793
01:09:01,441 --> 01:09:06,359
To see me one last time
so that we can actually
say goodbye to each other.

794
01:09:07,273 --> 01:09:09,536
You loved him,
and he knew that.

795
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,103
What more is there to say?

796
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,105
[teacher]
Two-minute warning.

797
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,454
Please take your seats

798
01:09:14,498 --> 01:09:16,630
and set your phones
to silent mode.

799
01:09:16,674 --> 01:09:18,284
Dude, we need
to focus, okay?

800
01:09:18,328 --> 01:09:19,764
You're not even
listening to me.

801
01:09:19,807 --> 01:09:22,070
Yes, I am!
I just don't think

802
01:09:22,114 --> 01:09:25,509
this is about color photos
or waiting rooms
or the in-between.

803
01:09:25,552 --> 01:09:28,773
Then what is it about?
A girl who won't let go.

804
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:33,604
Just think about it.
Okay?

805
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:36,433
[door close]

806
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:54,929
[sighs]

807
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:08,595
[laughs]

808
01:10:10,597 --> 01:10:11,642
Sorry.

809
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:09,003
[ringtone:
"Never Tear Us Apart"]

810
01:11:09,047 --> 01:11:11,571
Cell phone use is prohibited
during the test!

811
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,619
[ringtone spreads to
all cell phones,
overlapping]

812
01:11:15,662 --> 01:11:17,185
[students murmuring]

813
01:11:52,873 --> 01:11:55,223
Didn't I tell you
the drive would be worth it?

814
01:11:55,963 --> 01:11:58,792
This negative's made of
glass. It's coated in
collodion,

815
01:11:58,836 --> 01:12:02,492
then dipped in silver
nitrate, which is crazy.

816
01:12:02,535 --> 01:12:05,451
Because after that,
you only ave a few minutes
to take the photo

817
01:12:05,495 --> 01:12:07,453
or the chemicals
completely dry up.

818
01:12:07,497 --> 01:12:10,369
Hmm. That's exactly
what I was gonna say.

819
01:12:11,239 --> 01:12:12,980
It's only ten grand.

820
01:12:13,024 --> 01:12:14,678
It's a little
out of my budget.

821
01:12:14,721 --> 01:12:17,985
But I can offer you
a gluten-free cracker

822
01:12:18,029 --> 01:12:21,728
with rotting cheese on it.
You're so generous.
it's crazy.

823
01:12:21,772 --> 01:12:23,251
Sorry. Am I interrupting?

824
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,341
No. Julian, hi.

825
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:28,213
We were just talking about
how much we love the photo.
Oh, yeah.

826
01:12:28,256 --> 01:12:29,780
It's wonderful, isn't it?

827
01:12:29,823 --> 01:12:31,825
I just love how
he prioritizes

828
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:33,784
mood and atmosphere
over subject.

829
01:12:33,827 --> 01:12:36,743
That is a very sophisticated
insight for a girl your age.

830
01:12:36,787 --> 01:12:40,094
Julian, meet my very
sophisticated girlfriend.

831
01:12:40,138 --> 01:12:42,053
Hi, I'm Tessa.
Nice to meet you.

832
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:45,056
Congratulations on this.
This is great.
Oh, thank you.

833
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:49,974
Okay, kids, follow me.
I wanna show you something.

834
01:12:58,286 --> 01:13:02,160
Doesn't it look amazing
all lit up like this?

835
01:13:02,203 --> 01:13:06,164
Like it belongs here?
It does belong here.

836
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:09,820
Tessa, you have
an extraordinary eye.

837
01:13:11,561 --> 01:13:13,519
I don't understand.

838
01:13:13,563 --> 01:13:17,393
It's for sale
for $1,000.

839
01:13:17,436 --> 01:13:20,613
Yeah, and we already have
two serious inquiries.

840
01:13:20,657 --> 01:13:24,312
[heartbeat thumping]
Uh, this photo

841
01:13:25,226 --> 01:13:29,056
is not for sale.
This was a gift to Skylar.

842
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,797
Can't you print
another one?

843
01:13:30,841 --> 01:13:32,582
I really just don't want
anyone looking at it.

844
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:33,887
Can we please take it down?

845
01:13:35,236 --> 01:13:36,716
Are you serious?

846
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,632
Take it down.
Hey, it's okay.
I'll take it down.

847
01:13:39,676 --> 01:13:40,851
Thank you.

848
01:13:40,894 --> 01:13:43,114
[heartbeat continues]

849
01:13:45,769 --> 01:13:48,554
[no audible dialogue]
[train whistle blows]

850
01:13:48,598 --> 01:13:50,469
That's exactly why
I brought you here,

851
01:13:50,513 --> 01:13:53,951
to prove
that your photos are great,
even Julian thinks so.

852
01:13:53,994 --> 01:13:56,214
I don't want this photo
hanging on the wall

853
01:13:56,257 --> 01:13:58,477
of some random stranger.

854
01:13:58,521 --> 01:13:59,957
This is my photo.

855
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,176
That means I get to decide
who I share it with

856
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,874
and I shared it with you.

857
01:14:05,484 --> 01:14:06,485
You're right.

858
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:08,966
I'm sorry. I should have
asked you first.

859
01:14:09,009 --> 01:14:10,881
I just wanted you to see
how amazing you are.

860
01:14:10,924 --> 01:14:14,145
And that you can
get into RISD.

861
01:14:15,363 --> 01:14:17,017
Who said anything
about RISD?

862
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:21,979
Shannon said your art
teacher thought you could
get in.

863
01:14:22,022 --> 01:14:25,678
I'm gonna kill her.
It is the best art college
in the country.

864
01:14:25,722 --> 01:14:28,986
And it's in Providence,
which is in the same city
as Brown.

865
01:14:29,029 --> 01:14:31,205
Which if you get in,
we could be together.

866
01:14:31,249 --> 01:14:33,556
I--
For real.
Without a ticking clock.

867
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:36,210
Even if I could
get into RISD,

868
01:14:36,254 --> 01:14:38,125
which I totally doubt,

869
01:14:38,169 --> 01:14:41,302
I cannot afford that.
You're going to
get into RISD.

870
01:14:41,346 --> 01:14:43,653
No.
And you could just
get a scholarship.

871
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:46,830
Skylar, Jesus,
just give it up.

872
01:14:46,873 --> 01:14:49,572
This is--
You can't fix everything.

873
01:14:49,615 --> 01:14:50,921
What?

874
01:14:50,964 --> 01:14:53,358
Your parents' marriage
and me.

875
01:14:54,141 --> 01:14:56,274
Some things are
just beyond repair.

876
01:14:56,317 --> 01:14:58,015
Is that why you
won't say you love me?

877
01:15:00,844 --> 01:15:04,238
Because you're...
beyond repair.

878
01:15:09,548 --> 01:15:10,767
Okay.

879
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:12,769
That's...

880
01:15:20,864 --> 01:15:24,041
[machinery rattling]
[chattering on screen]

881
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,678
[phone chimes]

882
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,736
[knocking on door]
[pop music
playing on stereo]

883
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:52,999
[footsteps approaching]

884
01:16:54,261 --> 01:16:57,743
Hey,00. I'm here
like you asked. What's up?

885
01:16:57,787 --> 01:16:59,919
I would like to take
your portrait.

886
01:17:01,138 --> 01:17:05,621
Uh... can I change first?
No, you don't have to.
You can just put that on.

887
01:17:06,491 --> 01:17:07,710
What's that?

888
01:17:08,841 --> 01:17:10,756
It was my mom's.

889
01:17:18,155 --> 01:17:19,983
This really brings me
back to college.

890
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:25,205
I had a boyfriend
who was an art major.
Made me pose for him.

891
01:17:25,249 --> 01:17:31,124
So... Mel isn't the first
person that you've been in
love with.

892
01:17:33,213 --> 01:17:36,042
Gosh, no.
I've loved a few men.

893
01:17:36,086 --> 01:17:38,915
Maybe even one woman.

894
01:17:41,613 --> 01:17:46,531
Did you love any of them
more than they loved you?

895
01:17:46,574 --> 01:17:48,620
Oh, probably.

896
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:49,969
Didn't that scare you?

897
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:55,583
Knowing that someone
could you hurt you more
than you could hurt them?

898
01:17:55,627 --> 01:17:57,629
Yeah. Maybe at first.

899
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,980
But then I think I realized
if you protect yourself
from the lows,

900
01:18:01,024 --> 01:18:04,680
you just end up missing
all the highs too.

901
01:18:08,031 --> 01:18:09,946
You love Skylar. Don't you?

902
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:17,344
I think I'm screwing it up.

903
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:23,133
Yeah. If it's not
opening old wounds,
it's probably not true love.

904
01:18:24,917 --> 01:18:26,440
I just don't
know what to do.

905
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:30,967
How do I get Skylar
to understand that...

906
01:18:32,577 --> 01:18:34,318
I love him. [chuckles]

907
01:18:36,668 --> 01:18:38,496
You start by saying it.

908
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:43,327
You need to hear
the words, Tessa.

909
01:18:44,067 --> 01:18:45,938
You mean, he needs
to hear the words.

910
01:18:45,982 --> 01:18:49,463
No. You need to hear
yourself say them.

911
01:18:51,378 --> 01:18:52,728
Out loud.

912
01:18:53,859 --> 01:18:56,470
So the world knows
your feelings count.

913
01:18:58,342 --> 01:18:59,517
That you count.

914
01:19:05,653 --> 01:19:07,177
Vickie, I'm sorry.

915
01:19:08,874 --> 01:19:10,746
For how I've treated you.

916
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:27,023
Hey Google, dim the lights.

917
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:30,243
Yes!
Oh, man.
No smoke machine?

918
01:19:30,287 --> 01:19:31,331
Shh!

919
01:19:32,071 --> 01:19:33,899
We begin this invocation

920
01:19:33,943 --> 01:19:36,336
by asking the
Archangel Michael

921
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:38,861
to protect us against
any malevolent spirits

922
01:19:38,904 --> 01:19:42,603
that may be seeking a
gateway into this earthbound
sphere.
You wrote this?

923
01:19:43,213 --> 01:19:45,171
You're interrupting
my invocation.
I'm sorry!

924
01:19:45,215 --> 01:19:46,825
It's just-- This is crazy.

925
01:19:46,869 --> 01:19:48,609
Did you read all of
these books in two days?

926
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:51,830
Bitch, yes!
You know speed reading
is my super power.

927
01:19:51,874 --> 01:19:54,920
Enjoy Your Own Funeral.

928
01:19:54,964 --> 01:19:58,097
Yeah. That happens
to be a classic

929
01:19:58,141 --> 01:20:01,144
of the paranormal
metaphysical genre.

930
01:20:01,187 --> 01:20:02,841
Now hush.
Okay.

931
01:20:02,885 --> 01:20:05,713
[pop music playing]

932
01:20:05,757 --> 01:20:07,541
We seek to communicate

933
01:20:07,585 --> 01:20:11,807
only with the disembodies
spirit formerly known as
Skylar Adams.

934
01:20:12,982 --> 01:20:14,853
No other spirits, please.

935
01:20:16,376 --> 01:20:17,377
Okay.

936
01:20:18,726 --> 01:20:22,774
A Ouija board?
Please, Tess.
This is a planchette.

937
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,603
There's a pencil tip
attached to the bottom.

938
01:20:25,646 --> 01:20:28,954
We ask questions
and Skylar communicates
by moving our hands.

939
01:20:28,998 --> 01:20:31,000
Just like he did in the gym.

940
01:20:31,043 --> 01:20:33,045
Here. Fingers right there.

941
01:20:34,046 --> 01:20:35,569
Okay.

942
01:20:35,613 --> 01:20:37,223
Close your eyes.

943
01:20:40,009 --> 01:20:43,882
[gasps]
Oh, my God, it moved.
Sorry that was me. My bad.

944
01:20:43,926 --> 01:20:46,580
It's called scrying.
The deceased use the mirror

945
01:20:46,624 --> 01:20:48,887
as a gateway to the world
of the living.

946
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:54,110
All you have to do is
stare into the mirror
in a trance-like state.

947
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:57,069
That's it.
Okay.

948
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,559
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Can we cover up
Gambino and Drake?

949
01:21:08,602 --> 01:21:10,778
They're like really
distracting me.

950
01:21:10,822 --> 01:21:12,563
Instrumental
Trans-Communication.

951
01:21:12,606 --> 01:21:16,175
The spirit uses the TV
monitor as a bridge to our
world.

952
01:21:16,219 --> 01:21:18,786
What is this? Okay.
Here you go.

953
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:21,006
Blocks out the gamma rays.

954
01:21:26,533 --> 01:21:27,795
Do you see anything?

955
01:21:27,839 --> 01:21:29,362
No. Do you?

956
01:21:30,581 --> 01:21:31,582
No.

957
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:33,540
[sighs]

958
01:21:35,673 --> 01:21:37,936
[both sigh]

959
01:21:39,285 --> 01:21:41,418
Maybe I should have
read more books.

960
01:21:42,114 --> 01:21:44,943
No. No, you've been awesome.

961
01:21:44,987 --> 01:21:46,466
[phone chimes]

962
01:21:47,554 --> 01:21:49,992
[sighs] Oh, man.
It's just Vickie.

963
01:21:50,035 --> 01:21:52,255
Needs the car.
She has a shift.

964
01:21:53,734 --> 01:21:56,346
Okay. I'll walk you out.

965
01:21:57,521 --> 01:21:58,652
Okay.

966
01:22:02,004 --> 01:22:05,616
[faint, high
-pitched humming]

967
01:22:18,672 --> 01:22:21,110
[electric warbling]
[voice murmuring]

968
01:22:25,027 --> 01:22:26,245
Hello?

969
01:22:29,031 --> 01:22:31,381
[murmuring continues]

970
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,650
[GPS] Your route
is being calculated.

971
01:22:41,304 --> 01:22:46,352
Proceed for four miles
to the entrance to
Highway 85 South.

972
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:55,274
It's a map.
[door opens, closes]

973
01:22:55,318 --> 01:22:57,711
["Closer" playing]

974
01:23:03,717 --> 01:23:06,198
Tessa? Tessa!

975
01:23:06,242 --> 01:23:09,636
Sorry! I've gotta do this.

976
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:10,811
Tessa!

977
01:23:10,855 --> 01:23:11,987
[tires screeching]

978
01:23:13,336 --> 01:23:19,516
[GPS] Head southwest
to I-95 South,
and proceed for 106 miles.

979
01:23:21,561 --> 01:23:24,129
Continue straight
for six miles.

980
01:23:39,492 --> 01:23:42,278
[GPS] Take the next right,
and in 100 feet,

981
01:23:42,321 --> 01:23:45,150
your destination
will be on your right.

982
01:23:50,895 --> 01:23:53,463
[GPS] You have arrived
at your destination.

983
01:23:53,506 --> 01:23:55,204
[heartbeat thumping]

984
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:05,431
I told you he
wasn't gone yet.

985
01:24:05,475 --> 01:24:07,738
[laughs] Doris!

986
01:24:07,781 --> 01:24:11,046
[chuckles] Come. Sit.

987
01:24:14,571 --> 01:24:17,878
You know,
I love coming out here at
night

988
01:24:17,922 --> 01:24:20,968
to watch the shooting stars.

989
01:24:21,012 --> 01:24:24,189
My angels are
calling me home.

990
01:24:26,235 --> 01:24:28,454
Skylar knows
the end is near.

991
01:24:31,153 --> 01:24:33,111
You don't have much time.

992
01:24:33,155 --> 01:24:35,287
He's been communicating
with you?

993
01:24:35,331 --> 01:24:38,508
Well, I'm much closer
to his world than you are.

994
01:24:39,161 --> 01:24:40,901
[chuckles]

995
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:42,773
What does he want?

996
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:44,470
My help.

997
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:48,431
To bring
the two of you together.

998
01:24:49,171 --> 01:24:50,476
Can you?

999
01:24:55,177 --> 01:24:57,179
Please.

1000
01:25:01,661 --> 01:25:06,797
In ancient folklore,
the souls of the departed

1001
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:12,933
returned to places
where they experienced
their greatest moments of
love.

1002
01:25:13,717 --> 01:25:20,071
That's where they were able
to cross the life-death
barrier.

1003
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:23,683
Now, perhaps if
you and Skylar went back

1004
01:25:23,727 --> 01:25:29,298
to where you felt
the most love,

1005
01:25:30,603 --> 01:25:34,868
the window between worlds
might open?

1006
01:25:36,696 --> 01:25:37,741
Okay.

1007
01:25:38,481 --> 01:25:39,786
But be careful.

1008
01:25:41,614 --> 01:25:44,574
If you do manage
to cross the barrier...

1009
01:25:46,445 --> 01:25:48,360
there may be no way back.

1010
01:25:53,452 --> 01:25:56,847
[hip-hop music playing
over speakers]
[teenagers laughing,
chattering]

1011
01:26:05,638 --> 01:26:07,031
Tess?

1012
01:26:07,074 --> 01:26:08,206
What's up?

1013
01:26:08,815 --> 01:26:11,340
This is not how I wanted
my summer to go.

1014
01:26:11,383 --> 01:26:13,777
Oh, no, what do you mean?
What's wrong?

1015
01:26:14,386 --> 01:26:16,345
They're so cute together,
it's stupid.

1016
01:26:16,388 --> 01:26:17,650
Who's cute?

1017
01:26:18,869 --> 01:26:22,002
Oh. Is that Judd?
[Shannon] That's Judd.

1018
01:26:22,046 --> 01:26:24,179
Oh...
My vagina is weeping.

1019
01:26:24,222 --> 01:26:27,269
They are cute,
but I'm so sorry.

1020
01:26:27,878 --> 01:26:28,922
That's terrible.

1021
01:26:28,966 --> 01:26:30,663
Oh, my God!
What?

1022
01:26:30,707 --> 01:26:33,362
Billy Hodges
came to my party?

1023
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:36,669
Ciao, Billy.

1024
01:26:39,933 --> 01:26:41,631
Hey.
Hey.

1025
01:26:43,502 --> 01:26:45,548
[sighs] It's
just three words.

1026
01:26:51,293 --> 01:26:52,772
Hi.

1027
01:26:59,344 --> 01:27:04,219
Can we go somewhere
to talk for a second, alone?

1028
01:27:04,262 --> 01:27:06,525
Sure.
[both chuckle]

1029
01:27:06,569 --> 01:27:08,701
Yo, brutha!Hey.

1030
01:27:08,745 --> 01:27:11,008
[Cortez]
I just heard the good news.
What news?

1031
01:27:11,051 --> 01:27:12,618
Um...
Oregon State!

1032
01:27:14,098 --> 01:27:16,579
Nothing's official yet.
Oh, bullshit, bro.

1033
01:27:16,622 --> 01:27:21,323
No, I just talked
to the new coach. He said
it's as good as done.

1034
01:27:21,975 --> 01:27:23,325
Come on.

1035
01:27:24,326 --> 01:27:26,458
Um...Okay.

1036
01:27:26,502 --> 01:27:30,593
Tess? Tess? Tessa?

1037
01:27:30,636 --> 01:27:33,987
Tess, I was gonna
tell you, I swear.
When?

1038
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,165
When were you gonna tell me?
After I got into RISD?
No, of course not.

1039
01:27:38,209 --> 01:27:42,909
I just didn't want to give
you another reason to back
out.
What about our plan?

1040
01:27:43,693 --> 01:27:46,086
The same city?
No more ticking clock?

1041
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:48,872
You weren't even gonna
send in an application.

1042
01:27:50,134 --> 01:27:52,354
I applied last week.

1043
01:27:55,531 --> 01:28:00,057
Well, thank you for waiting
until the last possible
moment to tell me.

1044
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:04,670
[sighs]

1045
01:28:04,714 --> 01:28:08,065
The truth is, Tess,
my dad's not...

1046
01:28:08,108 --> 01:28:09,936
He's not doing that well.

1047
01:28:11,242 --> 01:28:15,681
He's really lonely in Oregon
and I feel like I should
stay with him for awhile.

1048
01:28:15,725 --> 01:28:19,642
Oregon is on the other side
of the country.

1049
01:28:19,685 --> 01:28:23,167
How were we ever
gonna see each other?
It'll be hard.

1050
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:27,824
I'm not switching schools
permanently. I'm not!

1051
01:28:27,867 --> 01:28:30,914
And if you get into RISD,
and you will,

1052
01:28:30,957 --> 01:28:33,220
I'll be in Providence
before you are.

1053
01:28:33,264 --> 01:28:36,920
What happens if you start
to like Oregon? What happens
if your team starts to win?

1054
01:28:36,963 --> 01:28:39,357
Tess, my dad
needs me right now.

1055
01:28:39,401 --> 01:28:41,185
He's my family. I don't--

1056
01:28:42,099 --> 01:28:45,842
[exhales]
You don't understand
about family because--

1057
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:49,498
Because I don't have one.

1058
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:51,891
That is not what
I meant to say.

1059
01:28:54,851 --> 01:28:56,809
I knew this was
gonna happen.

1060
01:28:58,637 --> 01:29:01,423
I get close to people
and they disappear on me.

1061
01:29:01,945 --> 01:29:03,990
This is just what
happens to me.

1062
01:29:04,034 --> 01:29:04,948
Tess.
No.

1063
01:29:06,253 --> 01:29:07,298
No.

1064
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:10,867
You're just gonna push me
away like you do everyone?

1065
01:29:15,524 --> 01:29:17,482
The summer is over, Skylar.

1066
01:29:19,528 --> 01:29:21,051
And so are we.

1067
01:29:28,232 --> 01:29:30,103
[horn honking]

1068
01:29:32,497 --> 01:29:36,936
Hey.
Your ghost-hunting assistant
has arrived.

1069
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,809
Here you go.
Direct from Daddy's closet.

1070
01:29:39,852 --> 01:29:45,292
Yeah, this is full spectrum,
motion sensor, night vision.

1071
01:29:45,336 --> 01:29:46,685
Perfect. Thank you.

1072
01:29:47,686 --> 01:29:49,253
Who gave you all the swag?

1073
01:29:49,296 --> 01:29:52,169
Ah, Vickie's credit card.

1074
01:29:52,212 --> 01:29:55,390
Whoa! Tessa's a
bad, bad girl.

1075
01:29:55,433 --> 01:29:58,523
Bye.
Hey, if there are nudes
of my mom on that camera,

1076
01:29:58,567 --> 01:30:00,046
I do not want to know.

1077
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:03,180
[whispers]
Shh. I'm gonna tell you.

1078
01:30:41,914 --> 01:30:43,873
[seagulls squawking]

1079
01:31:25,305 --> 01:31:26,959
[sighs]

1080
01:31:31,834 --> 01:31:33,226
[exhales sharply]

1081
01:31:42,888 --> 01:31:45,630

1082
01:34:02,114 --> 01:34:05,161

[police radio chatter]

1084
01:34:12,821 --> 01:34:14,257
[officer]
Central, standby.

1085
01:34:14,953 --> 01:34:16,694
You Tessa Benson?

1086
01:34:23,745 --> 01:34:25,398
I can't believe
you tracked my phone.

1087
01:34:25,442 --> 01:34:27,313
The day you stole
Vickie's credit card

1088
01:34:27,357 --> 01:34:29,315
was the day you gave up
your right to privacy.

1089
01:34:29,359 --> 01:34:32,928
What were you doing
at the hotel so late?
I was taking photos.

1090
01:34:32,971 --> 01:34:36,105
I told you that.
What, are you trying to put
yourself back in the
hospital?

1091
01:34:36,148 --> 01:34:39,325
I don't understand this.
Things were so much better
this summer.

1092
01:34:39,369 --> 01:34:41,850
We started to feel
like a family.
Do you not understand?

1093
01:34:41,893 --> 01:34:45,592
Geez, I wonder what happened
at the end of the summer
that might change my mood.

1094
01:34:45,636 --> 01:34:48,291
You know what I've been
through? What Vickie's been
through?
Stop.

1095
01:34:48,334 --> 01:34:51,207
Love hurts.
You learn to live with it.
Fuck off, Mel.

1096
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:53,296
Hey, no! You don't get
to talk to him like that.

1097
01:34:53,339 --> 01:34:56,081
Not after everything
he's done for you.
There's no...

1098
01:34:57,648 --> 01:34:58,693
Tessa!

1099
01:34:58,736 --> 01:35:00,912
[ultrasound warbling]

1100
01:35:06,526 --> 01:35:08,311
She's ruptured the repair.

1101
01:35:08,354 --> 01:35:12,271
Is it any wonder? The way
she's been running around
all crazy.

1102
01:35:12,315 --> 01:35:16,232
You can see right here.
There's a fair amount of
blood accumulated around her
heart.

1103
01:35:16,275 --> 01:35:18,756
Will she be all right?
Not until we
drain the chamber

1104
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,671
and reinforce
the original suture.

1105
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:23,326
We're gonna schedule you
for an OR first thing
in the morning.

1106
01:35:23,369 --> 01:35:27,330
No, no, I-- I'm not--
You gotta let me go.
You need to let me go.

1107
01:35:27,373 --> 01:35:29,985
Tessa! 50 milligrams now.
[Tessa] Jasmine, no!
Don't, please!

1108
01:35:30,028 --> 01:35:33,075
Tessa, if I let you go home,
you won't make it
through the night.

1109
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:36,382
You don't understand.
You don't understand.
Get some rest now, honey.

1110
01:35:36,426 --> 01:35:39,429
I never got to tell...
tell him.

1111
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:41,779
Tell him what?

1112
01:35:41,823 --> 01:35:43,433
That...

1113
01:36:07,326 --> 01:36:10,199
They can never, ever
tear us apart.

1114
01:36:10,721 --> 01:36:13,506

1115

[song continues on ringtone]

1116
01:36:38,488 --> 01:36:39,489
Tess?

1117
01:36:40,011 --> 01:36:41,926
[groans] Shan, is that you?

1118
01:36:41,970 --> 01:36:45,190
Are you okay?
You-- You sound medicated.

1119
01:36:45,234 --> 01:36:48,498
I'm at the hospital.
What happened?

1120
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,023
I saw him, Shan.

1121
01:36:52,067 --> 01:36:54,852
No way.
At the hotel.

1122
01:36:55,461 --> 01:36:58,116
I couldn't touch him,
but he was there.

1123
01:37:00,379 --> 01:37:03,556
I just have one place left
that I have to go.

1124
01:37:04,383 --> 01:37:06,995
The lake.
Where he told you
he loved you.

1125
01:37:07,865 --> 01:37:10,172
I just don't really have
much time left.

1126
01:37:10,215 --> 01:37:12,130
Okay, stay put. I'm coming.

1127
01:37:21,923 --> 01:37:23,315
Whoa.

1128
01:37:24,926 --> 01:37:26,753
Now what?
I don't know.

1129
01:37:26,797 --> 01:37:28,625
[electrical crackling]

1130
01:37:28,668 --> 01:37:31,846
Room 22.
I'll take him.

1131
01:37:31,889 --> 01:37:34,457
[chiming]
Oh. Ooh, two more.

1132
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,894

Witching hour.
I'll take odds,

1133
01:37:36,938 --> 01:37:38,156
you take evens.
Yeah.

[elevator dings]

1135
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:45,816
Whoa.
Let's go.

1136
01:37:46,382 --> 01:37:47,949
I could get used to this.

1137
01:37:58,089 --> 01:37:59,308
[elevator dings]

1138
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:04,443
[security guard]
Hey! What are you doing?

1139
01:38:04,487 --> 01:38:06,402
Go, go, go.
Come on.

1140
01:38:07,229 --> 01:38:08,360
Oh, God.

1141
01:38:18,501 --> 01:38:20,459
Whoa. What the hell?

1142
01:38:22,505 --> 01:38:25,247
[tires squealing]

1143
01:38:33,429 --> 01:38:35,344
The lake is that way.
You've gotta turn around.

1144
01:38:35,387 --> 01:38:38,521
I know. I know!
It's the wrong way!
Please turn around.

1145
01:38:38,564 --> 01:38:40,044
I can't.

1146
01:38:41,872 --> 01:38:43,569
Let go.
What?

1147
01:38:43,613 --> 01:38:45,006
Let go!

[door opens, closes]

1152
01:39:12,163 --> 01:39:16,646
What are you doing here?
Skylar says he's called you
and left you a ton of
messages.

1153
01:39:17,908 --> 01:39:21,433
So?
So? You're ghosting
your soul mate?

1154
01:39:21,477 --> 01:39:24,088
Shannon, my past is always
just gonna get in the way.

1155
01:39:24,132 --> 01:39:26,873
Remember last year,
you'd spotted
that condemned bridge

1156
01:39:26,917 --> 01:39:29,006
and just had to get a photo.

1157
01:39:29,050 --> 01:39:31,530
You had to jump
into the water,

1158
01:39:31,574 --> 01:39:33,880
even though it was
freezing cold.

1159
01:39:34,533 --> 01:39:35,970
You know what
I was thinking,

1160
01:39:36,753 --> 01:39:40,539
when I saw you down there
swimming against the current
to get your photo,

1161
01:39:40,583 --> 01:39:43,890
"Imagine if Tess could
be like this for her life,

1162
01:39:43,934 --> 01:39:45,196
and not just for her art."

1163
01:39:47,807 --> 01:39:50,636
He's leaving tonight, Tess.

1164
01:40:05,738 --> 01:40:07,131
Lock up for me.

This is where
the accident happened.

1168

Do you know why
he brought you here?

1169
01:41:03,013 --> 01:41:04,232
No.

1170
01:41:04,971 --> 01:41:06,277
I don't know.

1171
01:41:07,191 --> 01:41:08,627
But I'm gonna find out.

1172
01:41:10,107 --> 01:41:11,413

Oh, my God.

01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,302

[Shannon]
My friend just passed out.
She has a heart condition.

1179

I'm at the corner
of 6th and Channel,
please send somebody!

[Tessa] Skylar!

1181
01:41:54,195 --> 01:41:55,370
Tess.

1182
01:41:55,413 --> 01:41:57,633
You forgot your hat.
[chuckles]

1183
01:42:01,245 --> 01:42:02,899
I'm so sorry, Sky.

1184
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:05,119
I'm sorry. I'm...

1185
01:42:06,076 --> 01:42:10,080
[sighs] I should have
talked to you before
making any decisions.

1186
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:14,128
No. You shouldn't have to
explain loving your family.

1187
01:42:14,737 --> 01:42:18,654
If I hadn't spent my whole
life just pushing everyone
away, I would have
understood that.

1188
01:42:18,697 --> 01:42:21,135
No, come on, Tess.
I love you.

1190
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,095
I said it.

1191
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:27,445
Would you mind
if I said it again?

1192
01:42:33,930 --> 01:42:35,236
I love you.

01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:15,711
It's you.
It's me.

1196
01:43:17,843 --> 01:43:19,410
Oh, my God.

1197
01:43:33,163 --> 01:43:35,383
[siren wailing in distance]

1198
01:43:37,341 --> 01:43:40,388
I love you.
I know.

1199
01:43:40,431 --> 01:43:43,304
You told me.
I love you.

1200
01:43:43,347 --> 01:43:46,524
So that's why
you brought me here?

1201
01:43:46,568 --> 01:43:48,657
So that I'd know?

1202
01:43:49,397 --> 01:43:51,790
Yeah. No regrets.

1203
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:00,495
So, is this...

1204
01:44:01,931 --> 01:44:05,064
Is this it?
We're still in Avalon.

1205
01:44:05,108 --> 01:44:06,631
Not exactly.

1206
01:44:06,675 --> 01:44:10,026
It's like everything
you see is a memory,

1207
01:44:10,069 --> 01:44:14,422
a dream that we have,
to project it onto the
world.

1208
01:44:15,553 --> 01:44:17,033
It's kinda cool.

1209
01:44:17,773 --> 01:44:19,992
Come on. I'll show you.

1210
01:44:20,036 --> 01:44:21,603
Okay.

1211
01:44:22,778 --> 01:44:25,868
[paramedics,
Shannon chattering]

1212
01:44:33,136 --> 01:44:35,312
[speaking French]

1213
01:44:39,229 --> 01:44:41,275
[speaking French]

1214
01:45:18,790 --> 01:45:21,576
[doctors, nurses chattering]

1215
01:45:27,625 --> 01:45:30,976
I came out here
the first day I met you.

1216
01:45:33,196 --> 01:45:36,112
My parents had just told me
about the separation.

1217
01:45:36,982 --> 01:45:39,333
Felt like it was
the worst day of my life.

1218
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:44,903
And then I met you.

1219
01:45:45,730 --> 01:45:47,906
And it was probably
the best day of my life.

1220
01:45:49,081 --> 01:45:50,344
Mine too.

1221
01:46:43,135 --> 01:46:47,096
[Dr. Sarkisian]
There's nothing more we can
do. She has a decision to
make.

1222
01:46:47,139 --> 01:46:49,141
She has to want to live.

1223
01:46:49,707 --> 01:46:52,928
Come back, Tess.
Come back, Tess...

1224
01:47:16,517 --> 01:47:19,041
[crying]

1225
01:47:19,955 --> 01:47:20,999
Hey.

1226
01:47:24,046 --> 01:47:25,177
What's wrong?

1227
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:35,666
I've spent my whole life
learning how not to get
hurt.

1228
01:47:36,754 --> 01:47:38,843
And that's no way to live.

1229
01:47:42,151 --> 01:47:47,069
But... But even with
all the hurt that I feel
right now...

1230
01:47:50,594 --> 01:47:52,074
I don't regret a thing.

1231
01:47:54,555 --> 01:47:56,165
Because I love you.

1232
01:47:58,733 --> 01:48:01,387
And knowing that I'm capable
of feeling this way,

1233
01:48:01,431 --> 01:48:03,041
makes life worth living.

1234
01:48:06,654 --> 01:48:08,699
I don't want
to say goodbye.

1235
01:48:09,439 --> 01:48:10,962
You don't have to.

1236
01:48:14,313 --> 01:48:16,490
Love never dies.

1237
01:48:25,324 --> 01:48:26,761
[sighs]

1238
01:48:26,804 --> 01:48:28,240
I'm gonna miss you.

1239
01:48:29,981 --> 01:48:32,506
[sobbing]
I'm gonna miss you.

1240
01:48:44,909 --> 01:48:47,303
Go give us
a happy ending, yeah?

1241
01:49:06,496 --> 01:49:07,845
Hey.

1242
01:49:11,153 --> 01:49:13,198
No more dying, okay?

1243
01:49:14,286 --> 01:49:15,679
[chuckles]

1244
01:49:30,302 --> 01:49:32,174
Oh, my God.
It smells so good.

1245
01:49:32,217 --> 01:49:34,568
Sit down. There's plenty.
I can't. I gotta go.

1246
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:36,874
Good luck, Tessa.
Love you.

1247
01:49:36,918 --> 01:49:39,050
Go get 'em.
All right, bye.

1248
01:49:39,094 --> 01:49:40,791
See you later!

1249
01:49:42,097 --> 01:49:44,403
Ever since I was
a little girl,

1250
01:49:44,447 --> 01:49:48,233
people always told me that
I see things
that no one else does.

1251
01:49:48,277 --> 01:49:52,455
It wasn't just that
my camera was a way for me
to express myself.

1252
01:49:53,064 --> 01:49:57,547
It was the means by which
I captured the unseen.

1253
01:49:58,113 --> 01:50:02,160
It was only recently
that I discovered something
that I had been blind to.

1254
01:50:05,033 --> 01:50:06,077
A ghost.

1255
01:50:08,689 --> 01:50:11,474
All of us,
each and every one of us,

1256
01:50:11,517 --> 01:50:13,258
are haunted by ghosts.

1257
01:50:14,085 --> 01:50:17,393
The ghosts of
childhood trauma.

1258
01:50:19,264 --> 01:50:22,006
The ghosts of
unfulfilled dreams.

1259
01:50:22,833 --> 01:50:25,183
The ghosts of lost love.

1260
01:50:27,751 --> 01:50:31,102
Like so many people,
I believed that,

1261
01:50:31,146 --> 01:50:33,888
if I just ignored
these ghosts,

1262
01:50:33,931 --> 01:50:36,194
they would
eventually go away.

1263
01:50:37,065 --> 01:50:39,197
This turned out
to be a mistake.

1264
01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:43,462
Just like all of
our worst fears,

1265
01:50:43,506 --> 01:50:48,511
these invisible spirits
gain strength in darkness.

1266
01:50:49,555 --> 01:50:53,255
If we run from them,
they run faster.

1267
01:50:53,298 --> 01:50:56,911
If we push them away,
they just push back harder.

1268
01:50:56,954 --> 01:50:58,477
What are we supposed to do?

1269
01:51:01,698 --> 01:51:03,352
It has taken...

1270
01:51:04,527 --> 01:51:07,095
great personal loss

1271
01:51:07,748 --> 01:51:10,054
for me to discover the
answer to this question.

1272
01:51:13,144 --> 01:51:15,973
We must attend
to our ghosts.

1273
01:51:16,844 --> 01:51:20,717
We must welcome them
into our lives

1274
01:51:20,761 --> 01:51:24,895
as though they are part of
us, because they are part of
us.

1275
01:51:29,291 --> 01:51:33,991
It's only when we
acknowledge their presence
will they make room for new
possibilities.

1276
01:51:36,124 --> 01:51:39,823
In the end,
I've learned that our ghosts
are part of who we are,

1277
01:51:39,867 --> 01:51:41,390
part of who we hope to be.

1278
01:51:43,087 --> 01:51:45,873
These hauntings
stay inside us,

1279
01:51:45,916 --> 01:51:48,745
tethered to our
hearts forever.

1280
01:51:50,573 --> 01:51:51,966
In life.

1281
01:51:53,576 --> 01:51:54,838
In death.

1282
01:51:55,752 --> 01:51:59,800
And... everywhere
in-between.
