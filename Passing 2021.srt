[train engine chugging]

4
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:32,217
-[man 1, muffled] Hot enough for you?
-[woman 1] She's tried everything.

5
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,135
[horn blares]

6
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,600
[woman 2] What about the looks
she was getting…

7
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,187
[man 2] We were all, frankly, keen on…

8
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,650
[woman 3] No, it's not right for a girl.

9
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,569
[woman 4] …giving you any more money to…

10
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,615
[indistinct chatter]

11
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,785
-[man 2] Look at it this way…
-[woman 5] It's simple to me.

12
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,787
[man 3] I must stay away from…

13
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,956
[whistle blows]

14
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,666
-[man 4] Goin'--
-[man 5] Excuse me.

15
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,210
[woman 6] Feels like
the whole city is out today.

16
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,253
[woman 7] Summer sales.

17
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,589
-Can't keep a New Yorker from a bargain.
-[woman 6] Ain't that the truth?

18
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,758
Let's get to the toy store
and out of this heat.

19
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,469
I'll never hear the end of it
if I don't get my niece a doll.

20
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,179
[woman 7] She asking
for some special sort?

21
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,807
They have those ones
with darling hair you can braid.

22
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,726
-[woman 6] Yes, maybe she'd like that.
-[man 6 whistles] Taxi!

23
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,686
[both women sigh]

24
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,022
-[woman 6] Oh.
-[woman 7] There now, that's better.

25
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,608
[woman 6] Look at that precious
little pickaninny one.

26
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,111
-That, she'll love.
-No.

27
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,322
[woman 6] She's never even met a colored
who didn't work for us. Thank heavens.

28
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,116
-[both exclaim]
-Oh.

29
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,827
No, never mind, ladies.
Accidents will happen.

30
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,704
-[woman 6] My goodness.
-Here you are.

31
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,791
-[shopper] Here.
-[woman 6] Oh! Thank you.

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,795
-What a nice lady.
-[woman 6] Mm-hmm.

33
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,884
[shopper sighs]

34
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,061
[clerk] There you go, miss.
Thank you so much.

35
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,398
-[woman 8] Thank you.
-[girl] Mama, I want that one.

36
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,443
[shopper] Do you have
the Mother Goose Drawing and Tracing Book?

37
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,819
[clerk] All sold out.

38
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,907
Figures. I've tried all over town.
My son won't settle for anything but.

39
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,409
[clerk] Try again in a couple weeks.
Might get lucky.

40
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:25,121
-His birthday's tomorrow.
-[clerk] Well, better luck next time.

41
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,832
[woman laughing]

42
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,083
[indistinct chatter]

43
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,711
[clerk] Thank you.

44
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,344
[car horn blares]

45
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,346
[man 1] Mister?
Hey, are you all right, sir?

46
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,683
Please, somebody, help me.
I… I… Help me out.

47
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,978
He's fallen down. Sir, can you hear me?

48
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,688
[man 2] Sir. Sir, you all right?

49
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,357
-[woman] What's happened?
-I don't know.

50
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,358
[woman] He all right?

51
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,153
[streetcar bell clanging]

52
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,037
[exhales deeply]

53
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,794
[driver] This heat.
Feels like I'm about to pass out myself.

54
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:17,298
Yes. I guess it's tea I need.
I'm a little faint.

55
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,302
[driver] The Drayton, ma'am? They do say
as how there's always a breeze up there.

56
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,973
-[shopper] The Drayton would be lovely.
-[indistinct chatter]

57
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,101
[man] Oh! Taxi!

58
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,645
Take him to a hospital.

59
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,147
[birds singing]

60
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,625
Thank you.

61
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,422
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

62
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,087
[man 1] The waiter will be with you.

63
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,176
[woman 1 whispering] Stop it.

64
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,970
-Now?
-[man 2] Yes, now.

65
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,775
[compact clicks]

66
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,526
[shopper sighs]

67
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,034
[woman 1] You satisfied?

68
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,496
[indistinct whispering continues]

69
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,587
Come here.

70
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,560
[woman 1 giggling]

71
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:51,994
[man 3] See you later.

72
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,955
[woman 2] Don't be long.
I'll get another one.

73
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,415
[man 3] I won't. I hope.

74
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,209
-You'll be all right?
-[woman 2] I'll be just fine.

75
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,630
I'm going to sit here
and enjoy this cool room.

76
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,674
-[man 3] All right.
-[woman 2] All right.

77
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,136
-[man 3] I suppose I should…
-[woman 2] I suppose you should.

78
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,400
-[imperceptible]
-Oh!

79
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,446
[indistinct whispering
and chuckling continues]

80
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,051
[man 2] We'll be married soon.

81
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,098
As far as they know, we are.

82
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,226
[shopper sighs]

83
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:03,941
Pardon me. I don't mean to stare,
but I think I know you.

84
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,943
[shopper] I'm afraid you're mistaken.

85
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,030
No, of course I know you, Rene.

86
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,534
You look just the same.
Tell me, do they still call you Rene?

87
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,954
[Irene] Yes, though no one's
called me that for a long time.

88
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,791
Don't you know me?

89
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,295
Not really, Rene?

90
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,092
I'm afraid I can't seem to place…

91
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,221
[woman 2 giggles]

92
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,724
-Clare?
-[Clare] Mm-hmm.

93
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,309
That's right.

94
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,607
-Not Clare Kendry?
-[Clare] Mm-hmm.

95
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,942
Now, don't run away.

96
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,070
You simply must stay and talk.

97
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,782
Fancy meeting you here.
It's simply too lucky.

98
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,367
It's awfully surprising, yes.

99
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,202
[Clare] Mmm.

100
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,704
[giggling]

101
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,123
I'd never have known you
if you hadn't laughed.

102
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,417
You've changed so.

103
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,378
Well, it's been 12 years at least.

104
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,423
You know, I almost dropped by
your father's house not so long ago.

105
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,592
I've thought of you so often.

106
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,844
-You have?
-[Clare] Of course.

107
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,641
You know, since I've been here,
I've hoped I might run into someone.

108
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,228
Preferably you, though.
And now you're here.

109
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,525
I'll wager you haven't given me a thought.

110
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,110
So…

111
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,280
Tell me.

112
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,076
I want to know everything.
Married? Children?

113
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,247
-Yes. Two boys. You?
-Mm-hmm.

114
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,709
One girl. Margery. She's my angel.

115
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,211
My husband John's here on business.

116
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,422
Banking business.
In this heat! Can you imagine?

117
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,673
That was your husband?

118
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:55,303
[chuckles softly]
We've been here a whole week from Chicago.

119
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,387
That's home.

120
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,308
Although I come here
and remember what home really is.

121
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,148
Well, we can see lots of one another
these days that I'm here, can't we?

122
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,652
I don't know… I mean… I'm just…

123
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,072
I live in Harlem, still.

124
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,867
I don't come
to this part of town a whole lot.

125
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,746
Oh, that's sad.

126
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,375
Perhaps I can come visit
with you another time in Harlem?

127
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,002
Meet your boys?

128
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,421
We're here quite often.

129
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,716
And if this trip goes well,
well, John's quite sure we'll move.

130
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,679
It's my dream to come back, Rene.

131
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,349
[chuckles]

132
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,934
I'm sure.

133
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,023
Clare…

134
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,152
does he…

135
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,488
Know?

136
00:10:58,991 --> 00:10:59,950
[chuckles]

137
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,829
Let's go up to my suite,
where we can talk properly.

138
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,749
Waiter!

139
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,295
Ugh. I can't bear this heat!
I have to change.

140
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,465
John'll be back soon.

141
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,177
And here I am, sweatin' up a storm.

142
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,262
-That's nice.
-Oh!

143
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,683
I found Gert Johnson in the phone book.
Well, Gertrude Martin now.

144
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,184
She married Fred. Remember?

145
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,896
Yes. I haven't seen Fred
for an unmentionable time.

146
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,898
Well, they have twins.
Isn't that wonderful?

147
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,442
-Mmm.
-Boys. Oh, I'd love boys.

148
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,903
I'd never risk it again, though.

149
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:39,031
I went through hell those nine months
for fear Margery might turn out dark.

150
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,324
Mine are dark.

151
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,453
Oh. And your husband, he…

152
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:49,291
He… couldn't exactly "pass,"
if that's what you mean.

153
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,086
Oh, I thought…

154
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,381
Oh. [laughing]

155
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,719
Oh, well, then. [chuckles]

156
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,222
Would you?

157
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,684
Would you?

158
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,364
Well, anyway, she goes as white.

159
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,953
-So, you haven't ever thought to?
-What?

160
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,250
I'm asking
if you ever thought of passing, Rene.

161
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,669
No, why should I?

162
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,759
I mean, for convenience,
occasionally, I suppose. But no.

163
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,261
I just mean
I have everything I've ever wanted.

164
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,972
Except perhaps
a little more money. [scoffs]

165
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,517
Of course. That's all
anybody ever wants, a little more money.

166
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,643
[chuckles]

167
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,771
Money's an awfully nice thing to have.

168
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,776
In fact, all things considered,
I think it's entirely worth the price.

169
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,614
I should go, Clare.

170
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,366
I'm not sure
it's such a good idea if John…

171
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,160
Oh, no, Rene, it is.

172
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,289
Oh, you must stay a little while longer.
Oh, please say you'll stay.

173
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,168
Hang it! I've made a mess.

174
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,921
Give me a second,
and I'll order us some food up here.

175
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,672
All right.

176
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,849
Whatcha thinking, Rene?

177
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,186
You're curious, is that it?

178
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,231
You can ask me anything.
Anything you want.

179
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,194
What have you told him… of your family?

180
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,492
You know, I haven't had to worry
as much as you'd think.

181
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,619
There were my aunts, you see.

182
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,789
They took me in after Father died
and gave me a home of sorts.

183
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:56,335
[exhales deeply] Very white,
very respectable, very religious.

184
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,629
I met John not long after,

185
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:02,424
and as soon as I turned 18 and legal,
we got married and…

186
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,970
well, went off and left for good.

187
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,516
And you're happy?

188
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,768
Of course, Rene.

189
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,355
As you say,
I have everything I ever wanted.

190
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,237
I'm sorry, Clare, that was rude of me.

191
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,447
Of course you're happy.

192
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,825
-Look at you.
-[Clare chuckles]

193
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,248
-And your daughter?
-Margery? Oh, she's divine.

194
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,960
John wants to put her in one of those
Swiss boarding schools in the fall.

195
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:42,256
I dare say she'll get quite the education.
Not like anything we had.

196
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,092
Room service, hello?

197
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,930
We want cakes.
The most beautiful cakes you have.

198
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,432
Mm-hmm.

199
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:55,728
Tell me, what tea you got
passes for French champagne?

200
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,315
Oh, I'm messing!

201
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:06,238
Yes, we'll take a pitcher of iced tea
in champagne flutes.

202
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,824
Mm-hmm. We're celebrating.

203
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,745
[both laughing]

204
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,416
-[Irene] That's enough, thank you.
-Have a drop more. You've hardly had any.

205
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,751
[door opens]

206
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:22,463
-[John] Nig?
-John, dear! [kisses]

207
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,133
I ran into an old,
old friend of mine from school.

208
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:30,137
Irene Westover.
Irene, this is my husband, John Bellew.

209
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,264
Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Westover.

210
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,768
-Actually, it's Mrs. Redfield.
-[John] Mm.

211
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:40,189
Oh, of course, I…
I didn't even think to ask.

212
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,857
I am sorry if I've interrupted.

213
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,444
-Will you get me a drink, honey?
-[Clare] Here.

214
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,612
[John] Thank you.

215
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,780
[sniffles] Hmm.

216
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,325
So, what do you say, then? To old friends?

217
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,828
-To old friends!
-To old friends.

218
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,414
[Clare chuckles]

219
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,795
[knocking on door]

220
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,881
-Did you hear what John called me, Rene?
-Oh, Clare, please.

221
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,134
[Clare] No, go on, tell her why.

222
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,803
[John chuckles] Oh, it's silly.

223
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,473
When we were first married,
this woman was as white as a lily.

224
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:19,103
But as the years go by,
she seems to be getting darker and darker.

225
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:23,107
So I told her, "If you don't look out,
you'll wake up one morning

226
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,401
and find
that you've turned into a nigger."

227
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,571
Yeah. She's been Nig ever since.

228
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,990
[all giggling]

229
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,249
[laughs hysterically]

230
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,921
That's good!

231
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,716
Well, it's silly.

232
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,260
No, that's… That's…

233
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,720
That's good.

234
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,221
My goodness, John!

235
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,975
After all these years,
what would it matter

236
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,145
if you found out
that I was 1 or 2% colored, hmm?

237
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,565
Well, you can turn as black
as you please, as far as I'm concerned.

238
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,983
I know you're not colored.

239
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,363
So, you dislike Negroes, Mr. Bellew?

240
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,533
No, no, no, not at all. I hate them.

241
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,244
[John and Clare laugh]

242
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:21,290
But not as much as Nig does,
for all she's trying to turn into one.

243
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,084
Why, she won't have them near her,
not even as a maid.

244
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,086
Isn't that true?

245
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,922
Have you ever known any Negroes?

246
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,719
[John] No, no,
but I do know people who know them.

247
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,638
And I read about them
in the papers, of course.

248
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,892
Terrible mess. Robbing, killing.

249
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,269
[sighs] It's sad, really.

250
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:46,899
John, Rene doesn't want to hear
about your pet perversions.

251
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,693
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bore you.

252
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,279
You live nearby?

253
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,698
Fairly.

254
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:59,036
[John] It's a great city, New York.
City of the future.

255
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,498
-What line of work is your husband in?
-He's a doctor.

256
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,877
-[John] That's an interesting life.
-[Irene] Yes. Hard. Nerve-racking too.

257
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,297
Wife's nerves, too, I bet.
All those lady patients.

258
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,300
John, dear, don't start! More tea, Rene?

259
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,844
I've taken up
too much of your time already.

260
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,472
Oh, but we're just getting started!

261
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,017
-Thank you for the drink.
-[John] I'll see you out.

262
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,316
[Clare] Rene.

263
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,654
-I do hope to see you soon.
-Goodbye, Mrs. Redfield.

264
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,365
-Glad to have met you.
-[Irene] Goodbye, Clare.

265
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,912
[breathes deeply]

266
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,584
[jazz piano music playing]

267
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,087
[crickets chirping]

268
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,172
[child shouting in distance]

269
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,518
-[Irene] Evening, Lance.
-Evening.

270
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,008
[children talking indistinctly]

271
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,572
[husband] Hmm.

272
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,618
Where you been?

273
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,745
Lookin' for that darn book.

274
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,373
-They eat?
-I think so.

275
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,918
I was gonna put them to bed, but…

276
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,420
-But you fell asleep.
-Apparently.

277
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,135
[husband] Mm.

278
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,013
Am I still sleeping?

279
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,066
[chuckling]

280
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,785
[birds singing]

281
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:54,836
[horns honking]

282
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,311
Catch it!

283
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,689
Pass, pass.

284
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,318
[husband] Hey. Come here.

285
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,698
[grunts]

286
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,411
-I thought you nailed this already.
-[son 1] I forget sometimes.

287
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,037
[husband] All right, ten minutes.

288
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,504
-[son 1] Catch the ball, okay?
-[son 2] I don't want to.

289
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,589
[son 1] Don't lose it.

290
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,386
It's boring. Play with me.

291
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,596
[son 2] Just leave me alone.

292
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,181
Damn!

293
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,225
[sighs in exasperation]

294
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,188
-Caught!
-[gasps] Damn it!

295
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,774
Brian, why you gotta be
creepin' around the place like that?

296
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:58,984
Profanity, miss!

297
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,069
They'll be late for school.

298
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,990
I'm not gonna have time to make it
to my next call if I have to drop you.

299
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,911
-[maid] Boys, come on in.
-Irene?

300
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,497
[maid] Yes, yes,
you have to come on in now.

301
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,582
Sorry, honey.

302
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,593
I was just thinking
how much Junior is getting like you.

303
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,552
[Brian] Mmm.

304
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,763
I wonder if he isn't
going too fast in school.

305
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,139
It's easy to forget he's younger.

306
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:32,642
I wish you wouldn't be
ever fretting about those boys.

307
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,854
They are fine. They're perfectly
good, strong, healthy boys.

308
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:36,855
I suppose.

309
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,399
I'm just afraid
he's picked up some queer ideas

310
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,485
about things from some of the older boys.

311
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,028
"Queer"? What about?

312
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,864
You know,
things young boys be thinking about.

313
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,992
Ah. You mean about sex?

314
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,953
Yes. Jokes. Things like that.

315
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,664
If sex isn't a joke, what is it?

316
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,502
-What is a joke?
-Don't be facetious.

317
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,419
You ready?

318
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,798
No, you go. I'll take the bus.

319
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,219
-Pick you up, then?
-Please. From the printing office.

320
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,013
I need to see about more handbills
and tickets for the dance.

321
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,598
They should be paying you.

322
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,227
It isn't charity work
if they pay me for it.

323
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,738
[indistinct chatter]

324
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,573
-[maid] Go on, boys.
-[Brian] Are we ready?

325
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,158
[Irene] Lickety-split!

326
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,701
-Come back.
-Are you ready?

327
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,702
-I'm fast.
-Let's go.

328
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,121
-Go on, boys, get.
-Junior.

329
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,748
-[son 2] I don't wanna go!
-[Brian] You have to, I'm afraid.

330
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,833
[Junior] Bye, Mama.

331
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,044
-I'm too fast! Can't catch me.
-[son 2] Get back here.

332
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,504
[door closes]

333
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,922
[clock ticking]

334
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,133
-You want grapefruit, ma'am?
-Mm-hmm.

335
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,720
Thank you.

336
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,319
Ugh, my hat.

337
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,533
Oh, Ms. Redfield, you forgot one.

338
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,246
Thank you.

339
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,846
-Do you want me to drive?
-Mmm.

340
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:18,808
Yeah, sure.

341
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:24,940
[grunts]

342
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,863
Everything set?

343
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,742
We're a month away and all the bookings
are gone, not counting the door.

344
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,162
-Busy as a cat with fleas myself.
-Ain't you cold?

345
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,374
No, leave it, if you're not cold.

346
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:47,963
[car horn honks]

347
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,549
[sighs] This city!

348
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,718
I think I'm beginning to hate sick people.

349
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,973
Their stupid meddling families,
their dirty, smelly rooms--

350
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,849
Come on, now. It's just a bad day.

351
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,894
You don't mean that.
You're helping those sick people.

352
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,188
-Let's not talk about it.
-You brought it up.

353
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,649
[sighs]

354
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,657
-Put the window down.
-Thought you were cold.

355
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,118
Now I'm saying I can't breathe.
Put the window down.

356
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,501
I know you think trying somewhere else
would be easier for us.

357
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,421
South America or some such.
And to a point, I agree.

358
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,090
We should go abroad somewhere.

359
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,843
Not for a while, of course,
but when the boys leave…

360
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,971
-We can visit Brazil.
-Visit?

361
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,976
Or I was thinking of one of them
European schools for Junior.

362
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,979
You are going to make
a mollycoddle out of that boy.

363
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,398
Ted is the one who needs your attention,
not Junior,

364
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:52,611
and you needn't think I'll let you send
Junior to some nice kindergarten school

365
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,821
'cause he's getting
a much-needed education.

366
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,908
Sooner he learns about sex, the better.
Certainly if he learns it's a grand joke.

367
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,201
The greatest in the world.

368
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,495
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

369
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:08,960
I'm just getting a little tired
of playing second fiddle

370
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,172
to your precious Negro League, that's all.

371
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,177
How about a little charity for this Negro?

372
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,471
[Irene] Come on, now.
There's people looking.

373
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,316
What's this?

374
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,153
-I think it's from Clare Bellew.
-Clare Bellew?

375
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:39,032
[grunts] That woman from Chicago
you told me about running into?

376
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,493
-Mm-hmm.
-You gonna see her again?

377
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,038
I haven't opened the letter.

378
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,249
-It's postmarked New York.
-I know.

379
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,544
-They must've moved here.
-Brian, I'm not going to see her.

380
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,630
Thought you were good friends in school.

381
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,716
Brian, darling,
I'd have to be an idiot not to realize

382
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,803
if a man calls me a you-know-what,
it's his fault the first time,

383
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,305
but mine if I give him
the opportunity to do it again.

384
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,306
Sure, sure.

385
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,475
May I?

386
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:24,744
"I am so lonely, so lonely…"

387
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,497
"Cannot help longing
to be with you again."

388
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:32,293
-Don't mock her. That's not fair.
-I'm just reading it. [chuckles]

389
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,378
Fine.

390
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:38,133
"You can't know
how in this pale life of mine,

391
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,594
I am all the time seeing
the bright pictures of that other

392
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,389
that I thought
I was so glad to be free of."

393
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,016
[Irene sighs]

394
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,687
Oh, come on, it's funny!
She's very dramatic.

395
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,982
"It may be, Rene dear,

396
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,611
that your way may be the wiser
and infinitely happier one."

397
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:02,323
I'm flattered. "Wiser." As if anything
could rectify the humiliation…

398
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,742
Wait, wait, there's more.

399
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,453
"I wouldn't feel this wild desire…

400
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,663
if I hadn't seen you."

401
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,417
That's rich.

402
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,044
Blaming you.

403
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,550
"Wild desire."

404
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,595
Don't give her an inch.

405
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,355
What you so angry for anyhow?

406
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,109
-Husband didn't call you a--
-No, but he would've.

407
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,694
It amounts to the same thing.

408
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,905
[Brian] It has, you will admit,
its humorous side.

409
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,992
[Irene] No, I won't.

410
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,787
It's not funny, it's revolting.

411
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,208
Irene, leave it, huh?
It's normal. They always come back.

412
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,628
They have to work hard at getting there,
why would they wanna come back?

413
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,755
If I knew that, I'd know what race is.

414
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,591
You'd think they'd be
satisfied being white.

415
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,427
Rot! Who's satisfied being anything?

416
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,981
I am.

417
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:18,858
[Brian] Hmm?

418
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,820
Satisfied.

419
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:26,699
I am.

420
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,375
-[Brian] Let's go. Wait, Junior!
-Come on, boys.

421
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,919
-Books, books.
-Bye, Mama.

422
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,045
[Junior] Bye, Mama.

423
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,924
-[chuckles] Bye.
-[door closes]

424
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,813
[jazz music playing]

425
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,166
I got yams for tonight.
Save the chicken for tomorrow.

426
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,334
Yes, ma'am.

427
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,212
-Did you clean the boys' room already?
-Not yet.

428
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,549
Well, hurry. They'll be back soon
and then it'll be impossible.

429
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,010
Can I get you something?

430
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,720
No. I can get it.

431
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,306
[clock ticking]

432
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,359
[clock chiming]

433
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,164
[phone ringing]

434
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,719
Redfield residence.

435
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,639
Yes, hello.

436
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:14,807
Mm-hmm.

437
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,893
It's Mr. Wentworth.

438
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,275
Hello. Yes, Hugh.

439
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,444
Oh, quite, and you?

440
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,445
[doorbell chimes]

441
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,157
Every single one, honest. I know…

442
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,912
Wait, I'll give mine to Bianca.
I won't need it anyway.

443
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,247
-[door opens]
-No, I mean it.

444
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,917
It was silly of me not to,
I'll be so busy…

445
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,968
[Clare] Mm-hmm.

446
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,352
Well, as long as Brian has a place
to drop down now and then…

447
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,020
-[indistinct chatter]
-Uh-huh.

448
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,443
That's nice. My love to Bianca.

449
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:12,198
Yes, I'll see to it right away.
See you tomorrow, Hugh. Bye.

450
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,285
[sighs]

451
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,921
[gasps, chuckles] Dear God,
but aren't you lovely, Clare.

452
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,342
Didn't you mean to
answer my letter, Rene?

453
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,556
Every day I went
to that nasty little post office.

454
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,851
They thought I was having an affair
and the man had thrown me over.

455
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,103
-Oh! Clare, I…
-Well…

456
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,272
Eventually it sunk in.

457
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,733
You hadn't written to me
and didn't intend to.

458
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,653
I tried very hard to forget,
I really did, but I couldn't.

459
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,532
I had to know why. That's why I came here.

460
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,037
Why didn't you write to me, Rene?

461
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,506
You see…

462
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,513
Well… you see…

463
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,689
I can't help thinking that…

464
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,109
you ought not to…

465
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,446
ought not to come up here.

466
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,490
-You mean you don't want me here.
-No.

467
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,408
What I said,
you ought not to run the risk.

468
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,954
It's terribly foolish.
You must see that, and, well…

469
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,541
just not the right thing.

470
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,918
[chuckles] Oh!

471
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:51,047
Rene, you are priceless.
The right thing?

472
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,466
-I mean, it isn't safe.
-Safe?

473
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:57,428
To come up here. Considering what I saw
of Mr. Bellew's attitude.

474
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,016
Oh, of course, I understand.

475
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,937
And I don't blame you
for being angry, Rene.

476
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:10,441
You acted beautifully that day,
really beautifully. Thank you.

477
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,194
I don't want thanks.

478
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:18,199
I just mean that… it was very kind of you
to be so delicate about it.

479
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,159
What other option did I have, Clare?

480
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,871
I have been furious at you,
really furious.

481
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,706
-Putting me in that position.
-Of course.

482
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,376
I can't see why you wouldn't
understand why I wouldn't write.

483
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,418
Foolish of me.

484
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,420
Why I wouldn't want
anything to do with you!

485
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,799
[crying]

486
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,431
Oh, no, now…

487
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,311
-Don't cry.
-[sobbing]

488
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,231
I just… I feel so terrible about it all.

489
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,484
Oh, I… I didn't think…

490
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,237
I'm so very sorry, Rene.

491
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:00,032
There, there. Don't be.

492
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,160
I'm sorry too.

493
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,744
[Clare chuckles]

494
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,955
[sniffles]

495
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,461
Oh, darn it. The truth is
I'm very glad to see you, Clare.

496
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:14,839
Very.

497
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,801
Oh, and I you, Rene. You can't imagine.

498
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:24,307
Without that day, I would've got
to the end, unable to speak to anyone.

499
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,684
[chuckles] You can't know.

500
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,563
Never anyone to really talk to.

501
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,774
It was insensitive of me
not to think about that.

502
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,860
Oh, I don't expect you to understand.

503
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,029
You're happy.

504
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,659
You have a true, good life,
and you're free.

505
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:45,953
Free and safe.

506
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,457
Safe. [scoffs]

507
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,710
I don't even know what that is anymore.

508
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,796
[children laughing indistinctly]

509
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:01,052
I'm beginning to believe that no one
is ever completely happy, free, or safe.

510
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,263
Well, then, what does it matter
if I come up here sometimes?

511
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:08,976
You have a child, Clare.
It's not just a matter of your safety.

512
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,353
[phone ringing]

513
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,649
Being a mother
is the cruelest thing in the world.

514
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,860
-[maid] Hello. Redfield residence.
-Yes.

515
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,029
[maid] One moment…

516
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,447
And the most responsible.

517
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,493
Mr. Wentworth
is on the telephone again, ma'am.

518
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,286
[Irene] Excuse me.

519
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,550
Hello?

520
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:51,686
Oh, honestly, Hugh, tell her to stop
being silly. I've told you it's fine.

521
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,814
Mm-hmm. See you tomorrow.

522
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,239
You sound busy.

523
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,826
It's this
Negro Welfare League dance tomorrow.

524
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:10,579
I'm on the organizational committee.
I am the committee, pretty much.

525
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:14,333
-Hugh Wentworth, the novelist?
-Yes. Do you know him?

526
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,585
-I've read a book or two of his.
-You have?

527
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:17,962
[chuckles softly]

528
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,172
-They're good, aren't they?
-I suppose.

529
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,757
Sort of contemptuous.

530
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,678
Yes. Well, he's a dear, really.

531
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,014
Mind if I do some things around the house?

532
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,224
-I wasn't expecting guests.
-Oh, I don't mind.

533
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,642
You can show me your home.

534
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,188
So, Hugh Wentworth's
coming up to your dance, huh?

535
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,316
[chuckles] Yes. Why not?

536
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,277
Curious to me.

537
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,238
A man like that going to a Negro dance.

538
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,283
Hundreds of white people like Hugh
come to affairs in Harlem now

539
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,244
-Why?
-Same reason you're here. To see Negroes.

540
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,205
What are you doing, boys?

541
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,959
To enjoy themselves, to get material,

542
00:38:57,043 --> 00:39:00,046
to gaze on the great and near-great
as they gaze on the Negroes.

543
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,256
Rene, suppose I come too?

544
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,844
-Why, because so many white people go?
-No, because it'll be fun.

545
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:10,097
I don't know.
What if somebody recognizes you?

546
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,932
I'll take my chances on getting by.

547
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,894
-You'll be bored stiff.
-I won't, honestly. I won't.

548
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,897
-I won't be able to look after you.
-I'll be as good as gold.

549
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,900
I'll just sit there
and gaze at the great and not-so-great.

550
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,652
Look, I don't care
what you do or where you go,

551
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,780
but I don't see why you should
put yourself in a place

552
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,114
that might bring you trouble.

553
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,200
Damn John!

554
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,371
He gets in the way of everything I want.
I could kill him.

555
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,789
I wouldn't.

556
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,833
There's still capital punishment
in this state, at least.

557
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,630
I want so much to be around Negroes again.

558
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,883
Talk with them, hear them laugh.

559
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,637
I've almost forgotten it…

560
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,597
[pot shatters]

561
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,307
Damn!

562
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,313
-Shall I go down?
-No, it's nothing.

563
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,148
Zu will clean it.

564
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:04,860
Zu!

565
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,698
Come to the dance if you want to.
I'm not going to stop you.

566
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:13,369
[Clare] Thank you, Rene.
That's so kind of you. Really, thank you.

567
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,286
[Irene] Boys?

568
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,539
-[Junior] What do you want? We're busy.
-[Irene] Junior.

569
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:20,709
Oh, now, don't be cross.
I know I've gone and spoiled everything,

570
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,712
but if I promise not to get in the way,
will you let me in?

571
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,969
It will just be us for dinner.

572
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,513
It's just as well.
I don't have any more for more.

573
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:37,268
Well, they were the cowboys
and I was the Indian,

574
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,562
and they captured me
right outside the fort.

575
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,856
But I think I just made my getaway.

576
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,150
[children playing indistinctly]

577
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,651
[Irene chuckles]

578
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,571
Pay him no attention.
Junior gets ahead of himself fast.

579
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:54,368
Mmm. What's cooking?
Yams? How you fixin' them?

580
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:59,039
-Butter, salt, sugar. Simple.
-[giggles] Simple!

581
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,460
Why, it's just about
the most perfect taste on God's earth!

582
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,880
Where did you find her, Rene?

583
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,757
I long for a maid
who knows real home cookin'.

584
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,136
-[Irene] It's not like that.
-Not like what?

585
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,263
Everyone needs help. It's normal.

586
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:21,854
-Maybe next time you can stay for dinner.
-Oh, please, yes.

587
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,399
How about I stop by tomorrow
and we can go to the dance together?

588
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,692
All right.

589
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,737
-All right. See you tomorrow, then.
-Tomorrow. Yes.

590
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,573
-Bye, Rene.
-[Irene] Mm.

591
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,037
[jazz piano music playing]

592
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,709
[indistinct chatter]

593
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,258
-All right, come on in.
-I didn't get a chance yet.

594
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:10,653
-Thought you might've fallen asleep.
-No. Out on time. For once.

595
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,112
Ooh, good.

596
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:18,035
-You nervous?
-Hey, get off. You're sitting on my dress.

597
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,467
-Clare's coming. Clare Bellew.
-Hmm?

598
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,221
-That crazy woman, Clare?
-Her, yes, her.

599
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,556
Crazy woman Clare Bellew.

600
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,849
-She's not crazy.
-Since when?

601
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,893
Just… different.

602
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,019
[Brian chuckles]

603
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:51,068
She surprised me with a visit yesterday.

604
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,238
Yesterday?
Why in the world didn't you tell me?

605
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:57,324
-Don't know. I had a lot to think about.
-Irene.

606
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,828
She made it sound not such a problem
if she came with us, so…

607
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:01,996
I said fine.

608
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,084
-She's coming here?
-Any minute, I would think.

609
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,128
Be nice, huh?

610
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,755
I highly doubt it.

611
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,008
I mean, you be nice to her.

612
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,426
I will be polite.

613
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,808
[Irene] Gonna dress or lie there?

614
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,696
Quit hovering. Go wait for me downstairs.

615
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,038
Wait, I'm sorry. I love you.

616
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,416
Boy! You are nervous.

617
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,758
-[doorbell chimes]
-[breathes deeply]

618
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,889
[Clare] Oh, I thought
I'd never get better.

619
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,183
I had such a fever.
I thought I'd die. Truly.

620
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:07,770
[Brian] It was quite the epidemic.
I can't recall how many cases I treated.

621
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,521
-Not all of them made it.
-Mmm.

622
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,273
-So you're lucky.
-Yeah.

623
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,567
[Brian] Of course,
many more survived on my watch.

624
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,486
-[Clare giggles]
-I'm not bragging.

625
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:16,904
[Clare] And what if you are?

626
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,616
-It's worth bragging about if it's true.
-[chuckles]

627
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:21,742
You may be right.

628
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,538
I'm sorry,
I didn't realize you were here already.

629
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,916
Don't worry.
We made our own introductions.

630
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,125
Yeah, we did.

631
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,461
-You look lovely, Rene.
-[Brian] Mm-hmm.

632
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,091
I'm afraid I may have chosen all wrong.

633
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,177
Rot! It's perfect.

634
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,304
-[Junior] …do it again.
-[Ted] You told me.

635
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,889
Here they are!

636
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,892
Well, how do I look?

637
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,603
-Like a princess.
-[giggling]

638
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,939
All right, all right.

639
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,608
-Good night and good night.
-[Irene] Good night.

640
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,569
I feel exactly as I used to
the night before Christmas.

641
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,864
I knew there was a surprise waiting
for me, but I could never guess what.

642
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,033
-Ah.
-I'm so excited.

643
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,953
-You can't possibly imagine.
-[car horn honks]

644
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,497
-"You can't possibly imagine."
-[Irene] Stop now.

645
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,875
-[woman] Hi.
-[upbeat jazz music playing]

646
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,003
-[indistinct chatter]
-[woman] That music sounds good.

647
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,549
[man] They'll be there.

648
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,092
[music continues playing]

649
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,303
[indistinct chatter]

650
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,773
Bianca, I am outraged.

651
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:45,784
There's Hugh!

652
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,078
[Brian] Anywhere to sit?

653
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,081
In that booth with Hugh
if we can get there.

654
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,208
[Clare] What a hoot!

655
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,056
[man] There he goes!

656
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,080
[woman] Hey, where'd you learn this dance?

657
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,832
[man] You taught me everything I know.

658
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,751
[laughing] Felise, Dave!

659
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,796
-It's a triumph! The band is peachy!
-It's a riot!

660
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,341
-Come on, Brian. We're going dancing.
-[Brian] What--

661
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:45,302
-Oh, no, no, no.
-Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

662
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,346
Look out, Clare.
The man has two left feet.

663
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,017
-Is that true?
-No.

664
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,312
-Yes, it's very true. Bit rusty.
-[chuckles]

665
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,147
-Well, let's give it a go.
-All right.

666
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,070
Okay.

667
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:14,414
"Poor man, rich man, beggar man, thief…"
How's the rest of it go?

668
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:19,294
[Hugh] "Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief."
All here and a few more.

669
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,885
What I'm trying to find out
is the history and status

670
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:30,347
of the blonde beauty out of the fairy tale
that you've brought along.

671
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,306
[Clare] See?

672
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,599
[both laughing]

673
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,227
[Hugh] The one currently seen
dancing with your husband.

674
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:39,690
She's a girl from Chicago I used to know.
She's very excited I know you.

675
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,276
-Good of her, I'm sure.
-[chuckles]

676
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:47,072
[Hugh] Can you spot
my wayward wife in the throng?

677
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,535
Ah, yes!

678
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,579
Ah. The usual problem.

679
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:57,541
All these gentlemen of color have driven
a mere Nordic out of her mind.

680
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,458
[Irene] Stop!

681
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,795
Have I laid eyes on her tonight
except in spots here and there

682
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,839
being twirled about by some Ethiopian?

683
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,132
I have not.

684
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,093
Well, sir, you have to admit
that the average colored man

685
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,928
is a better dancer than the average white.

686
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,389
That is if the celebrities
who find their way up here

687
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,224
are fair specimens of your sort.

688
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:18,020
Having not tripped the light fantastic
with any of the males,

689
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,689
I am hardly in a position
to argue the point.

690
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,280
[crowd applauding]

691
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:31,450
[Hugh] Bianca and Co. are always raving on

692
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:36,705
about the good looks of some Negro,
especially an unusually dark one.

693
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,373
Like Ralph Hazelton there.

694
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:42,628
Dozens of women
have declared him fantastically handsome.

695
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,171
What do you think? Is he?

696
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,507
No. And I don't think
anyone else would either.

697
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:52,012
It's just plain exoticism.
An interest in what's different.

698
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,181
A kind of emotional excitement…

699
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,018
Something you feel in the presence
of something strange

700
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,896
and, even perhaps, a bit repugnant to you.

701
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,105
And there you have it.

702
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,195
So, do you subscribe to the notion

703
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:12,157
that our motives for coming up here
are predatory?

704
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:13,659
[Irene] No.

705
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,536
More curious, I should say.

706
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,289
Like your princess from Chicago.

707
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:21,750
[Irene chuckles]

708
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,504
[Hugh] What is that supposed to mean?

709
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,924
Things aren't always what they seem, Hugh.

710
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,349
I'll be damned.

711
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,603
-Nobody could tell from looking at her.
-[Hugh] No.

712
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,231
Most surprising.

713
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,193
Tell me,
can you always tell the difference?

714
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:51,530
-Oh, now you really are sounding ignorant.
-No, no, I mean it.

715
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,283
Feelings of kinship
or something like that?

716
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:58,954
Stop talking to me like you're writing
for the National Geographic.

717
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,455
I can tell same as you.

718
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,543
And I suppose sometimes there is a…

719
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,379
a thing… a thing that can't be registered.

720
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,674
[Hugh] Yes, I understand what you mean.

721
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:15,345
Yet, lots of people pass all the time.

722
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,472
It's easy for a Negro to pass for white.

723
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:21,393
I'm not sure it would be so simple
for a white person to pass for colored.

724
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,354
Never thought of that.

725
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,607
No, Hugh. Why should you?

726
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,193
Sometimes I think you could.

727
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,446
Yes.

728
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,615
And in a way, if you can,
why wouldn't you?

729
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,576
Sorry. Hey.

730
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:40,954
-[Hugh] I'm asking, why wouldn't you?
-Who's to say I'm not?

731
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:45,167
-You're being unusually cryptic this--
-And you are being an ass.

732
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:47,961
I just mean…

733
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,339
we're all of us passing
for something or other.

734
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:56,887
Aren't we?

735
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,597
[guests applaud]

736
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,057
An ass, am I?

737
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:05,270
Ah, my feet hurt
like a… a marathon runner's.

738
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,648
I am in awe of your energy! [chuckles]

739
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,151
Well, I suppose
I ought to go retrieve my wife

740
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,905
before some man or other
steals her away from me indefinitely.

741
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,074
Won't you dance with me, Mr. Wentworth?

742
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,577
It's not quite my strong suit, Ms. Bellew.

743
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,413
-[Brian] Hugh.
-Brian.

744
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,710
-Thank you.
-And for you.

745
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,880
-Thank you.
-Your husband has ruined me, Rene.

746
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:34,633
I must have another dance with him.
He's the best here!

747
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:39,763
[chuckles] I guess my wife hasn't told you
that I do not respond well to flattery.

748
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,808
Uh, however, I would be more than happy

749
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,727
to find you a suitable replacement.

750
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:46,895
-[Irene] Oh.
-[Brian] Mmm.

751
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,147
[upbeat jazz music continues playing]

752
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,900
Now, this… this is your man.

753
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,944
-[man] You?
-[Clare] Yeah.

754
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,822
You'll do. Come along.

755
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:43,201
-[man] See ya.
-[Irene laughs] He doesn't stand a chance.

756
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,619
[Brian] None whatsoever.

757
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:46,663
Oh!

758
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,041
You know, I'm rather glad she came.

759
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,131
Isn't she
extraordinarily beautiful, though?

760
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,841
No, not particularly.

761
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,719
-You're fooling!
-No.

762
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:05,348
I mean, she'd be a rather unusually
good-looking white woman, I suppose.

763
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:09,728
But personally, I like my women darker.

764
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:11,855
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

765
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,780
Maybe it's just because she was so happy.

766
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,074
Shh.

767
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,081
Irene, watch yourself.

768
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,167
Mmm?

769
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,253
Don't find yourself responsible
for that kind of happiness.

770
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:38,131
[chuckles] Nonsense.

771
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,847
[jazz trumpet music playing]

772
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,687
[man] Hey, can it!

773
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,148
[trumpet continues playing, fades]

774
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,234
[birds singing]

775
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,987
[jazz piano music playing]

776
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:12,958
[clock chiming]

777
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,441
[door opens, closes]

778
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:40,568
[Junior] Clare?

779
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,405
[Ted] Goin' back to bed, Mama?

780
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,949
No, of course not, sweetie.

781
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:51,246
-Where's Clare?
-She's coming later when you'll be in bed.

782
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,666
-But she sends you special kisses.
-But Pa said she'd play with me.

783
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,962
Ted, take your brother to the kitchen
and get something to eat.

784
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,505
I don't want something to eat.

785
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,717
-Ted, I said go take your…
-'Scuse me.

786
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,889
Sorry. I told Junior Clare would be here.

787
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,267
[door slams]

788
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,893
What's that about?

789
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,148
Somebody called him a dirty…

790
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,651
you-know-what today.

791
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:26,865
[Irene gasps]

792
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,881
-[Irene] Zulena?
-Out back, Rene.

793
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:50,138
What in the world?
Clare, aren't you freezing?

794
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,975
When the Lord brings you
a magical day like this, I say lap it up.

795
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,393
You're crazy.

796
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:59,022
-Zu, can you help with these groceries?
-They call this an Indian summer.

797
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,358
-An Indian summer?
-Zu.

798
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,531
Zu and I were just talking
about the Charlestons next door.

799
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,242
-That eldest girl is getting so pretty.
-She is.

800
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,995
Ted can barely look at her.

801
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:23,046
-Puberty makes such a mess of friendships.
-[Zulena] Puberty is a mess!

802
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,923
Amen to that! [chuckles]

803
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,549
I don't know.

804
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,135
You had a lot of friends, as I recall.

805
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,846
I suppose.

806
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,936
Sometimes I wonder
why we weren't better friends.

807
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,563
Oh, we did all right.

808
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,317
I always admired you, though.

809
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:50,573
You were always so calm
and beautiful in the face of everything.

810
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:53,076
Me? Come on, now.

811
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,203
You were always the beauty.

812
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,957
Not how I see it.

813
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,426
Staying for dinner?

814
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,052
I can't.

815
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,179
John's coming home.

816
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,683
Oh, I thought next week.

817
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,060
Back early.

818
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,312
Misses me.

819
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,900
Can't say I feel the same.
Wish he'd stay away always. [sighs]

820
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,404
-You mustn't say that.
-Mustn't I?

821
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,620
[sighs]

822
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,497
[jazz piano music playing]

823
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,844
Still coming to bridge?

824
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,638
Heaven forfend I miss the bridge, Rene!

825
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:57,765
[Irene chuckles]

826
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,821
[clock chiming]

827
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,923
[Irene] "It was dusky inside
and smelled like wood and oil."

828
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:33,676
"She bumped her head on a light bulb
dangling from the ceiling."

829
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,261
Want to take the next part?

830
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:39,098
"All that time, the rat steadied the bulb

831
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,935
and pulled the chain,
and light flickered."

832
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,813
There was a lynching in Little Rock.
You hear about that?

833
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,982
-[mouthing] Not now.
-What happened?

834
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:51,653
A Black man was accused
of assaulting two white women.

835
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,072
What did he do to them?

836
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:57,242
It's less a question
of "what" than "if," Ted.

837
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,786
-But they lynched the man anyway.
-Exactly.

838
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,204
Junior, go brush your teeth.

839
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,206
They…

840
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:05,792
-chased him…
-Brian.

841
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:09,337
They caught him, hung him from
a telephone pole, and they shot him.

842
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:13,132
-But why, Papa?
-Because they hate us, son.

843
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,677
I said, Brian, not now.

844
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:21,474
Come here.

845
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,437
Seems as though
we can't discuss these things

846
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,856
without distressing
the ladies of our family.

847
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,818
[Junior and Brian laughing]

848
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:33,987
-All right?
-Yeah.

849
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,114
Go brush those teeth, hmm?

850
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,963
[Irene] I know I take being a mother
rather seriously.

851
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:55,925
I know I'm wrapped up in my boys
and the running of my house.

852
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,595
But I don't think
there's anything funny in that.

853
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,762
[Clare] Oh, Rene, I know.

854
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:03,141
You're so good. So perfect.

855
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,394
You say that like it's a bad thing.

856
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:08,229
[trumpet playing in distance]

857
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,817
Let's sit here a minute.

858
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,613
I like hearing him play.

859
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:41,429
Don't think, whatever happens,
I'll forget how good you've been to me.

860
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,266
-What are you talking about?
-I mean it.

861
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:49,937
You see, I…

862
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:56,027
I don't have proper morals
or a sense of duty like you.

863
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,573
-You're talking nonsense.
-But it's true, Rene.

864
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,204
Don't you realize?

865
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,750
I'm not like you one bit.

866
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:23,012
Why, to get the things
I want so badly, I'd do anything.

867
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:25,765
Hurt anybody.

868
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,895
Throw anything away.

869
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:33,898
Anything.

870
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,697
I'm not safe.

871
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,448
[trumpet continues playing]

872
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,253
Clare, stop it.

873
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,797
What you're saying is wrong.

874
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,675
You've always had so much,
you haven't given up a thing.

875
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,262
[trumpet stops playing]

876
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,230
Clare?

877
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:25,992
[Irene sobbing]

878
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,544
[doorbell chimes]

879
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,924
[indistinct whispering]

880
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,014
[Irene] Oh, I'm sorry.

881
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,642
Has Mae called?

882
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:54,103
[sighs] I don't know where she could be.

883
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,898
Damn Zu taking the night off…

884
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,275
She does have to see her family
from time to time.

885
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:05,823
Oh, but, we're late already and…

886
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,994
Well, it is my last night
before I leave for Europe.

887
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:17,794
Why don't I stay with the boys
and you two go?

888
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,796
-[Brian] Really?
-I don't mind.

889
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:23,174
-No, we can't leave you.
-Oh, yes, you can.

890
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:26,385
And it will make the numbers even.

891
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,100
Well, now I really have to play bridge.

892
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,694
-Go on, now.
-But I'll miss you, Rene.

893
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:47,073
No, you won't. Go on. Get.

894
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,082
Go on, now.

895
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,216
[clock ticking]

896
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:09,303
[playing upbeat jazz music]

897
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,793
[crowd cheering]

898
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,673
This is where all the talent is.

899
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,593
-[Hugh] Yeah, and the hooch.
-[Irene laughs]

900
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,052
Where's Princess tonight?

901
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,847
It's a rarity having the two of you
all to myself.

902
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,433
She's in Europe.

903
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:58,978
Her daughter's in boarding school.
Switzerland, of all places.

904
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,105
[both chuckle]

905
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,901
-What?
-Nothing. Just, uh…

906
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:08,070
What do you know about Switzerland?

907
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:13,951
Well, I shouldn't miss her too much.
I find her hard work.

908
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,995
Well, some would say the same of you.

909
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,747
True.

910
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:23,044
But I call it shameless, what she does.
Always playing the victim.

911
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:24,837
"Poor little tragic me," etcetera…

912
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,797
It's a low way
of making yourself popular--

913
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,467
-I don't think that's fair.
-I didn't quite finish.

914
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:35,514
But she does maintain a certain charm.

915
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,726
Hugh, you hardly know the woman.

916
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,687
-Since she isn't here to defend herself--
-You will?

917
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:45,399
Very chivalrous of you, I'm sure.

918
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:48,027
[lively jazz music playing]

919
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,283
[Irene chuckles]

920
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:01,624
-[birds singing]
-[children playing in distance]

921
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,710
[jazz piano music playing]

922
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,966
-[Irene] Afternoon, Lance.
-Irene.

923
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,391
Have to let this dry before we attach it.

924
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:09,150
This is nice, isn't it? Just us four.

925
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,491
-I'll make some hot chocolate.
-Yes, please!

926
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:20,870
Look out!

927
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,174
[Ted] No, I want to keep talking about it.

928
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:36,427
-[Irene] You two look serious.
-We're talking about John Carter.

929
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:40,139
The one that got lynched in Little Rock.

930
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,809
-That again?
-[Ted] You gotta know about these things.

931
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,312
-Do I?
-Do we have any more nuts?

932
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:48,731
-I'll see.
-I want some too.

933
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,568
You know they did more
than just shoot him.

934
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:56,072
They attached his body to a caravan,
dragged it through the city.

935
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:00,659
-Did you tell your father that?
-He told me.

936
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:02,953
He did?

937
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:08,751
I'm old enough not to be spoken to
like a child anymore.

938
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,422
[pot bubbling loudly]

939
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:14,548
[Irene sighs]

940
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,678
[Junior] Thank you for dinner, Mama.

941
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:35,027
I wish you wouldn't keep talking to them
about all that lynching stuff.

942
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,195
Why?

943
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:40,116
There'll be time for them to learn
about horrible things when they're older.

944
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:43,244
-Right now, they're safe.
-You are absolutely wrong.

945
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:46,705
If you are determined
to have them grow up in this damn country,

946
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,999
the sooner they find out, the better.

947
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:52,002
But they're happy. Why ruin that?

948
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,922
-I want them to stay happy.
-Irene.

949
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:59,885
What is the use
in keeping things from them? Hmm?

950
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:03,180
We tried to keep them
from hearing the word "nigger."

951
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,224
-Don't use those--
-They found out the hard way.

952
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,977
You are not to talk
about the race problem. I won't have it.

953
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:11,105
-It is my house too. They need to know--
-They don't!

954
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:14,942
They do not.

955
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:24,577
I don't understand how someone
as intelligent as you can be so stupid.

956
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,207
[crying softly]

957
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,769
I wanted to leave
this hellish place years ago.

958
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:57,318
I have been saying
we should go away for a bit.

959
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:05,618
But then you seemed happier
having Clare around, so…

960
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,204
The hell has Clare got to do with--

961
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:10,664
Only that we would have
gone on a trip but for that.

962
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:12,833
I gave up that idea because you objected…

963
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,419
-I never objected to having Clare--
-God damn it!

964
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:18,422
Irene, I'm not talking about Clare.

965
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:20,341
-It seems--
-I'm not talking about a trip!

966
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:22,176
I am talking about leaving this--

967
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:27,014
It seems to me you are a lot less content
with what you've got when she's not here.

968
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:40,778
[dishes clattering]

969
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:54,083
[continues crying]

970
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,466
[indistinct chatter]

971
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:04,885
[footsteps running]

972
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,272
[gentle piano music playing]

973
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,288
[train engine chugging]

974
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,426
[Clare giggling]

975
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:58,564
[jazz piano music playing]

976
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:17,041
[Clare] Not how I see it. No.

977
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,047
[indistinct chatter echoing]

978
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:29,136
[indistinct laughter echoing]

979
01:12:58,957 --> 01:12:59,792
[giggles]

980
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:03,712
I'm getting up.

981
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:06,006
Don't worry.

982
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:08,801
Hmm.

983
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:15,808
-It was good of you to think to call me.
-Always the attentive husband.

984
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:17,059
[Irene sighs]

985
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:18,977
All of those people coming to tea.

986
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:23,273
Thank goodness everything is ready.

987
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,279
-Clare's downstairs.
-Clare? How?

988
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:31,365
I didn't invite her, purposely.

989
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:35,577
Uh, she's been back for a while.
Zu's always taking messages,

990
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,038
and you never seem to respond.

991
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,790
Might a mere man ask why?

992
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:45,212
This party is for Hugh, and Hugh happens
not to care a great deal for her, so…

993
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,631
I didn't ask her.

994
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:50,801
If you ask me, his dislike
has less to do with her

995
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:55,764
and more to do with the attention
she happens to not give him very much of.

996
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:58,058
-You love Hugh.
-I do.

997
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,936
But you'll admit he has
a godlike opinion of himself.

998
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,187
I disagree.

999
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:05,858
He thinks far better of himself
than that. [giggles]

1000
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,344
Brian?

1001
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,764
I'm sorry. It's my fault, Irene.

1002
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:42,811
She seemed hurt at being left out.
I told her I was sure you'd forgotten.

1003
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:50,360
But, Brian, I…

1004
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:58,869
You spoke to her, then?

1005
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:01,413
Yes.

1006
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,500
Of course you did.

1007
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:18,263
In spite of what I said,
Clare does add to any party.

1008
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,809
She's so easy on the eyes.

1009
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:26,271
[sighs]

1010
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,982
You won't be long?

1011
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:36,448
[breathing heavily]

1012
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,667
[indistinct chatter]

1013
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,088
-[woman 1] Thank you.
-[Irene] Sorry.

1014
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:55,217
[woman 2] We're all discussing
La Josephine. You've seen her, I presume?

1015
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:58,762
-[Irene] Josephine Baker? No, never.
-[man] You're missing out.

1016
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,474
[Irene] She may have been
in Shuffle Along when I saw it,

1017
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:05,894
but I can't remember.

1018
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,938
[woman 2] I much prefer her
to Ethel Waters.

1019
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:10,524
[Irene] Ethel Waters is awfully good.

1020
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,152
Hello, Felise, so glad you made it.

1021
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:16,655
[Felise] Oh, come back. Irene.

1022
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:20,492
-You haven't sat down all afternoon.
-[Irene breathing heavily]

1023
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:22,744
[Felise] I wanna talk to you.

1024
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:31,378
Come out of it, whatever it is.
You look like the second gravedigger.

1025
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:33,422
[Irene] I'm not quite feeling up to par.

1026
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:38,010
-The weather, I guess.
-[Felise] Buy yourself an expensive frock.

1027
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:39,344
It always helps.

1028
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:43,056
I have been trying to get her alone
all afternoon. Clare!

1029
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:47,477
You look too divine,
sitting so quiet like a painting!

1030
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,730
-Come over for a gathering next month.
-You must!

1031
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:52,274
[Clare] I was telling Dave
I just finished his book.

1032
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:55,277
-[Felise] You've read his books?
-Of course, I've read all of 'em!

1033
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:57,863
[Hugh] Oh.

1034
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:03,452
So sorry, Rene, I must've pushed you.
Clumsy of me.

1035
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:09,124
Don't tell me,
it's priceless and irreplaceable?

1036
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:12,044
No, you didn't push me, I'm quite sure.

1037
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:15,881
That pot was the ugliest thing

1038
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:19,051
that your ancestors,
the charming Confederates, ever owned.

1039
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:21,845
I've forgotten how many
thousands of years ago it was

1040
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:25,849
that Brian's
great-great-great-great uncle owned it…

1041
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:30,562
What I mean is I never figured out how
to get rid of it till just this minute.

1042
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:34,024
Inspiration! I had only to break it,
and I was free of it forever.

1043
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:37,527
-[chuckles] Simple.
-Well done.

1044
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,909
-[Hugh] My lovely.
-[woman] Oh, that was wonderful.

1045
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,079
Well done.

1046
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:51,500
Brian, thank you so much
for a tea party that…

1047
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:53,460
-Bye, Rene.
-…can never be matched.

1048
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:55,629
-Staying for dinner?
-Oh, I can't tonight.

1049
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:59,549
Oh. Right.
Too bad. Brian's got work, anyway.

1050
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,426
-So glad to see you.
-So long.

1051
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:06,682
Thank you so much.
We had a marvelous time.

1052
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:08,392
Good to see you. Thank you.

1053
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,061
[clock chiming]

1054
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:14,481
[door opens]

1055
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:17,651
-[Junior] Then I beat Patrick in a race.
-[Brian] Hat! Hat!

1056
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:19,945
Race you up the steps! Can't catch me.

1057
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,406
[Ted] I'm not letting you have it. No!

1058
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:25,867
Evening.

1059
01:18:31,748 --> 01:18:33,500
[bell ringing]

1060
01:18:33,583 --> 01:18:34,751
[Felise] My goodness.

1061
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:40,173
-Heavens, my eyes are watering.
-I fear my fingers might fall off.

1062
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:41,800
-[giggling]
-This wind is brutal!

1063
01:18:43,009 --> 01:18:43,844
[John] Excuse me.

1064
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:48,557
Oh, Mrs. Redfield! How do you do?

1065
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:09,661
That was abrupt.

1066
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:15,000
You just passed the only person I ever met
while disguised as a white woman.

1067
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,752
[jazz piano music playing]

1068
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:46,114
Hello, Central Quincy 5-4-7-3.

1069
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:52,913
Hello, is Mrs. Bellew in? It's urgent.

1070
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:58,043
No?

1071
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:04,966
Never mind.

1072
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:10,013
It isn't that urgent.

1073
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:12,557
I'll try again later.

1074
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,643
[wind whistling]

1075
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:07,571
[wind continues blowing]

1076
01:21:12,742 --> 01:21:14,536
[jazz piano music playing]

1077
01:21:33,763 --> 01:21:35,181
[breathing heavily]

1078
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,855
[trumpet playing in distance]

1079
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,546
[Brian] Irene.

1080
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:09,716
Irene.

1081
01:22:13,219 --> 01:22:14,930
What are you doing? It's freezing.

1082
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:18,516
Are we going to that party with Clare?

1083
01:22:30,987 --> 01:22:32,405
[Clare giggling]

1084
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:35,742
[Brian chuckling]

1085
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:39,496
Have you ever been up to the sixth floor?

1086
01:22:39,579 --> 01:22:43,500
[Clare] Of course!
My father was a janitor.

1087
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:44,501
[chuckles]

1088
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,378
[Clare] Back in the old days

1089
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:49,923
when every ramshackle apartment
had its own elevator.

1090
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:51,007
[Brian] Elevator?

1091
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:56,680
-Oh, you can't mean we have to walk up?
-[chuckles] All the way to the top.

1092
01:22:56,763 --> 01:22:58,264
[Clare] Oh, Lord!

1093
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:01,101
Why on earth would anyone live here?

1094
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,396
She says it discourages
the casual visitor.

1095
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,107
-Says she'd rather be dead than bored!
-Huh.

1096
01:23:08,608 --> 01:23:09,651
[Clare sighs]

1097
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:12,862
Damn these thin shoes.

1098
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:17,909
What is it, Rene?

1099
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:23,415
Have you ever thought of what you'd do
if John found out?

1100
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:24,916
Yes.

1101
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,253
[Brian] Don't fall by the wayside
before the fourth floor.

1102
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:31,506
I absolutely refuse to carry anybody up
more than two flights.

1103
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:34,676
[Clare giggling]

1104
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:39,264
And? What would you?

1105
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:43,560
I'd do what I want
more than anything right now.

1106
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,187
I'd come up here to live.

1107
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:49,399
In Harlem. With you.

1108
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:00,660
[Brian chuckling]

1109
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:10,754
Lord.

1110
01:24:11,629 --> 01:24:13,548
[Brian and Clare breathing heavily]

1111
01:24:31,691 --> 01:24:33,026
Come on, slowpoke.

1112
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:36,362
[indistinct chatter]

1113
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:47,415
[Dave] …dinner at Eddie's,
then Leroy's, then Smalls.

1114
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,168
Those dancers seem strange to anyone else?

1115
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:53,171
-No, honey, just the liquor.
-That's why I've given it up.

1116
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:54,923
-Since this morning?
-Yes.

1117
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,717
And nothing in the least exciting
has happened--

1118
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:59,844
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

1119
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:02,514
I wouldn't.
I've heard the drinks here aren't safe.

1120
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:04,390
[indistinct chatter continues]

1121
01:25:06,726 --> 01:25:10,814
[Dave] Irene, have you taken a vow
not to laugh again?

1122
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:15,568
No. It's simply the rest of you
are so clever, I'm speechless.

1123
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:17,654
You haven't a drink. What will you take?

1124
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:20,323
Ginger ale and three drams of scotch.

1125
01:25:20,406 --> 01:25:22,659
Scotch first, then the ice,
then the ginger ale.

1126
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:26,079
[Felise] Don't attempt
to mix that yourself, Dave, honey.

1127
01:25:26,162 --> 01:25:29,082
-Have the butler make it.
-[Irene] And the footman, would you?

1128
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:51,437
[soft jazz music playing]

1129
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:41,029
-Yes, it's a perfect evening.
-Good.

1130
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:57,337
[Dave] Don't stand there.
Aren't you freezing?

1131
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:58,671
[pounding on door]

1132
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:03,051
[Dave] Come. Come talk to me,
or at least listen to me gabble.

1133
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,054
-[man 1] Evening, can I help you?
-[John] Let me in.

1134
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:09,557
[man 1] Perhaps
you've come to the wrong house.

1135
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,684
[John] I know where I am. Let me in.

1136
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,895
[man 2] Which apartment
are you looking for, sir?

1137
01:27:13,978 --> 01:27:16,064
-[John] My wife is in there.
-[man 1] Your wife?

1138
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:18,816
No, sir, she's not here. I guarantee it.

1139
01:27:19,525 --> 01:27:22,487
-[man 2] Excuse me, I think you're wrong.
-[John] I'm not wrong.

1140
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,697
-[man 1] Do not come in!
-[man 2] Sir, calm down.

1141
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:26,658
-[man 3] What's going on?
-[John] Out of my way.

1142
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:27,575
Can I help you?

1143
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:32,121
[John] I've been to the Redfields'
and I know she's with them.

1144
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:33,456
Ralph, where's my drink?

1145
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:43,174
[John] Save yourself the trouble
and get out of my way.

1146
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,970
I know what you're doing here. I know.

1147
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,140
I'm Redfield.
What the devil's the matter--

1148
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:53,935
You don't get to tell me what to do!
Any of you people!

1149
01:27:54,018 --> 01:27:55,270
[Dave] It's best you leave.

1150
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:56,813
You liar!

1151
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,400
[Felise] Careful.
You're the only white man here.

1152
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:05,863
You dirty liar.

1153
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:16,666
[gasps]

1154
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:23,423
[Felise] Oh!

1155
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:27,885
-Good Lord Jesus!
-[indistinct chatter]

1156
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,555
-[man 1] Hurry.
-[man 2] Quickly!

1157
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:33,349
Quickly!

1158
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:36,978
Go downstairs.

1159
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:45,445
[wind whistling]

1160
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:54,972
[man 1] Her husband's just sitting there?

1161
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:57,767
[man 2] I don't know.

1162
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,311
[man 1] You don't know?

1163
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:02,397
[man 2] I don't know
for sure if she's dead.

1164
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,482
[high-pitched ringing]

1165
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:08,444
[ambulance sirens blaring]

1166
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:14,283
[man 3] I imagine he was
just trying to protect his wife.

1167
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:16,452
[man 4] Doesn't strike me
as particularly unusual.

1168
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:21,958
[Irene] Is she…

1169
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,838
Is she…

1170
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:45,565
[moans]

1171
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:48,401
Irene, you mustn't.

1172
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:51,112
You'll make yourself sick.

1173
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:55,116
[man 3] I mean, she just tumbled over
and was gone.

1174
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,993
[Dave] Irene was there
beside her, weren't you?

1175
01:30:57,076 --> 01:30:58,161
[officer] This lady here?

1176
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:00,413
You're sure she fell?

1177
01:31:00,496 --> 01:31:02,790
Her husband
didn't give her a shove or anything,

1178
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:05,001
as Dr. Redfield here seems to think?

1179
01:31:06,085 --> 01:31:09,672
No. I'm quite sure she just fell
before anyone could stop her.

1180
01:31:09,755 --> 01:31:11,090
It was so quick, I…

1181
01:31:13,217 --> 01:31:14,093
[gagging]

1182
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:16,929
-Careful.
-[officer] Anyone else notice anything?

1183
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:19,056
-You mustn't.
-[officer] None of you saw how she fell?

1184
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:23,394
-[Felise] He was upset, that's true.
-[officer] So an accident?

1185
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:27,565
[Felise] I guess an accident, yeah.

1186
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:29,484
That's what I thought.

1187
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:31,944
[breath trembling]

1188
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:16,447
[whispers] I love you.

1189
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:22,453
[officer] Death by misadventure,
I'm inclined to believe.

1190
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:24,830
Let's go up
and have a look at that window.

1191
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:30,836
[wind blowing]

1192
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,474
