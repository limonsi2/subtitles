00:00:10,724 --> 00:00:11,689
Each and every one of you

4
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:12,965
are a part
of the American dream

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,862
because you are entrepreneurs
and you own your own business.

6
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:18,448
And I will tell you, some days
are not so good.

7
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:19,655
But guess what?

8
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:22,862
So many days are so amazing.

9
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:31,206
<i>You're
important to us.</i>

10
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:35,206
<i>It is the sisterhood,
it is the camaraderie, it is,</i>

11
00:00:35,862 --> 00:00:38,206
it is LuLaRoe.

12
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:41,689
<i>The law of attraction
rules the universe.</i>

13
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:43,862
I'm so blessed to be
a part of LuLaRoe.

14
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:45,586
<i>You are planting seeds.</i>

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,379
<i>In the last 30 days,</i>

16
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:52,137
<i>I sold over $13,000 worth
of LuLaRoe clothing.</i>

17
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:54,000
That is insane.

18
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:56,310
<i>We love you,
we value you</i>

19
00:00:56,344 --> 00:00:58,862
<i>in everything that you do.</i>

20
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:01,103
Together, we're home!

21
00:01:01,137 --> 00:01:03,931
It's given me my purpose back.

22
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:06,965
<i>I knew that not only
was this special,</i>

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,413
<i>but this was something</i>

24
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:09,896
<i>that was gonna change
people's lives.</i>

25
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:13,724
<i>You do solemnly state
under penalty of perjury</i>

26
00:01:13,758 --> 00:01:15,586
that the evidence you
shall give in this matter

27
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,862
will be the truth,
the whole truth

28
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:18,172
and nothing but the truth.

29
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:20,068
Yes.

30
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:22,103

your full name?

DeAnne Stidham Brady.

32
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:27,758
Women are filing
a class-action lawsuit

33
00:01:27,793 --> 00:01:30,758
accusing LuLaRoe of being
a pyramid scheme.

34
00:01:30,793 --> 00:01:33,000
Can you please
state your full legal name?

35
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,931
Mark Allen Stidham.

36
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:38,620
<i>The lawsuit
seeks a billion dollars
for a plaintiff</i>

37
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:41,620
<i>unknowingly recruited
into LuLaRoe's pyramid scheme.</i>

38
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:44,586
I hate that I joined LuLaRoe,
I am embarrassed

39
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,896
that I sold LuLaRoe.

40
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,103
They got my money.

41
00:01:48,137 --> 00:01:49,448
LuLaRoe won.

42
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:51,448
I actually,

43
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:54,896
literally despise them,
and it makes me angry.

44
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:57,586
<i>According to
Washington Attorney General,
Bob Ferguson,</i>

45
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,586
<i>"LuLaRoe tricked consumers
into buying</i>

46
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,827
<i>into its pyramid scheme."</i>

47
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:04,137
I wasn't alone in...
in receiving merchandise

48
00:02:04,172 --> 00:02:06,275
that I just was not
able to sell

49
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,862
to anyone because it was crap.

50
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,793
I am stuck with thousands
of dollars

51
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:12,827
of inventory.

52
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:15,206
Even at my peak month,

53
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:18,448
I don't think I ever made
any money.

54
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:20,448
I was in a lot of debt that...

55
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:23,620
I was unable to pay back.

56
00:02:24,413 --> 00:02:27,379
Disrupting that status quo,

57
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,793
we... we created enemies.

58
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:33,206
We were attacked viciously
on social media.

59
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:35,344
Why doesn't LuLaRoe
sell directly to consumers?

60
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:38,344
I don't know.

61
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,206
How many retailers
does LuLaRoe currently have?

62
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:41,965
I do not know.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,517
Do you know
a ballpark?
- Nope.

64
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:46,206
How are you
currently compensated?

65
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,379
I don't know.

66
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:51,827
When did you start
asking others to sell

67
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:53,344
LuLaRoe clothing for you?

68
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:56,862
I never asked anyone.

69
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:08,931
Be happy.

70
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:10,793
Give yourself kudos
of the good things

71
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:12,724
that you are doing
and say to yourself,

72
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:13,827
"You know what?

73
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:15,413
I'm able to buy
better groceries.

74
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:17,379
I am able to make
the car payment."

75
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:19,758
Those are the reasons
why you got started
at LuLaRoe.

76
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,413
<i>If the pitch was real</i>

77
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:25,758
and I said to you,
"With no experience,

78
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:26,931
little money down,

79
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:28,413
you can run your
own business,

80
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:29,689
set your own hours,

81
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:32,034
spend more time
with your friends and family

82
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:34,482
and possibly
be a millionaire,"

83
00:03:34,517 --> 00:03:35,862
and that is possible,

84
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:38,034
wouldn't you do it?

85
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:39,896
I'm super excited
because I just got

86
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:41,931
my initial inventory today.

87
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,758
It's a welcome card here
from DeAnne and Mark.

88
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:46,793
This is the planner.

89
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:50,482
This is so cute.

90
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:53,034
These are really pretty.

91
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:54,862
Hello, birds.

92
00:03:54,896 --> 00:03:56,379
Purple birds.

93
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:59,000
- We have some busy bees.
- Do you like wearing
underpants?

94
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:00,379
'Cause this is what
it'll feel like.

95
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:03,517
Also, little extra tuck,
tuck for people like me,

96
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:04,931
like moms, who need it.

97
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:07,758
- Stickers. Stickers
- Stickers. Oh, my gosh.

98
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:14,137
<i>LuLaRoe is a multi-level marketing
company.</i>

99
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:16,310
They sell shirts, dresses,

100
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:17,482
all kinds of clothes,

101
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:20,103
but they're most known
for their leggings.

102
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:25,034
<i>The leggings cost
around $25.</i>

103
00:04:25,068 --> 00:04:27,310
<i>They have like a slightly
higher price point.</i>

104
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:30,137
And I think
they were considered
a little more high quality

105
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:32,827
and a little more designer
than, you know,

106
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:35,344
just a random
pair of leggings.

107
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:38,137
<i>People really loved
their really colorful ones</i>

108
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:40,482
<i>or they loved
the weird patterns.</i>

109
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:42,068
<i>They loved how soft they were.</i>

110
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:43,413
<i>And I remember the first time</i>

111
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:44,758
I heard about LuLaRoe,

112
00:04:44,793 --> 00:04:46,689
that's what people
were talking about,

113
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:48,896
<i>was these leggings
are so comfortable</i>

114
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:50,413
<i>and they're so soft.</i>

115
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:54,172
Buttery soft leggings.

116
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:55,448
LuLaRoe leggings,

117
00:04:55,482 --> 00:04:56,827
if you haven't tried them,

118
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:59,310
are one of the most softest,

119
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:02,482
<i>buttery things you'll ever
put on your legs.</i>

120
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:06,965
- That buttery soft hand feel
that you all absolutely love.
- Buttery soft.

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,758
Like, what does buttery
even mean?

122
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:12,310
And I thought that was really
ridiculous, too,

123
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:13,413
until I felt them.

124
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:18,862
<i>Now, let's go
to a little town</i>

125
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:21,931
<i>in New Jersey where things
are really popping.</i>

126
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:25,000
<i>Yes, there's a party going on
at Mrs. Betty Martin's house.</i>

127
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:26,517
<i>It's a Tupperware party,</i>

128
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:28,137
<i>and it's really fun.</i>

129
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:30,310
<i>The girls get together
and meet their old friends</i>

130
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:31,896
<i>and make some new ones.</i>

131
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,758
<i>Then there's a demonstration</i>

132
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:35,172
<i>by one of the Tupperware
dealers</i>

133
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:36,379
<i>who lives in your community.</i>

00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:39,758

<i>Avon calling</i>

136
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:43,586
<i>Growing up,
I remember my mom</i>

137
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,241
<i>going to a lot of Tupperware
parties.</i>

138
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:47,172
My great grandma sold Avon.

139
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:48,379
My aunt sold Mary Kay.

140
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:51,379
<i>Dishes in my grandma's house</i>

141
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:53,137
<i>were from like door-to-door
salesmen.</i>

142
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:55,620
<i>And you would see
a lot of products</i>

143
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,827
<i>in people's houses.</i>

144
00:05:56,862 --> 00:05:59,172
<i>I thought it was just a fun...</i>

145
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:01,379
<i>...get together?</i>

146
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:03,379
As a kid, I did not understand

147
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:05,413
about the recruitment.

148
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,655
<i>Like, I really thought these
women were just, like,</i>

149
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:08,965
<i>running a business
out of their house.</i>

150
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:15,896
<i>The American dream
is that we all have</i>

151
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:19,137
the chance to be rich,

152
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:21,620
and make it, you know,
we all have the chance.

153
00:06:21,655 --> 00:06:22,896
We all grow up thinking,

154
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:25,620
"I'm gonna get famous
or I'm gonna get rich."

155
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:28,620
And we aren't discouraged
from thinking that.

156
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,758
Maybe you'd like to look
at this more closely.

157
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:32,586
I'll pass it around.

158
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,793
Yeah.

159
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,310
<i>If you work
hard enough,</i>

160
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:37,827
<i>you will achieve success.</i>

161
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,896
And these companies,

162
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:42,379
they're just exploiting

163
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:44,448
that hopefulness that we've
all been raised with.

164
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:48,724
<i>LuLaRoe was founded in 2013</i>

165
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:51,896
and grew extremely fast.

166
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:54,137
<i>So, in 2015,</i>

167
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:56,793
<i>they only had around
1,000 consultants.</i>

168
00:06:56,827 --> 00:06:58,896
<i>By April 2017,</i>

169
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:01,517
<i>they had over 80,000
consultants</i>

170
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,724
<i>and were making
a billion dollars in revenue.</i>

171
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:09,034
So, that's 0 to 80,000
in five years.

172
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:10,310
You know, having come
from business,

173
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:11,793
I understand most companies
would kill

174
00:07:11,827 --> 00:07:14,275
to have that kind of growth
year over year.

175
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,724
And so, uh, business processes
have been a challenge.

176
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:20,034
You know, when it was just
a small family business,

177
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:22,034
we all just, kind of,
rolled up our sleeves

178
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,482
and did what needed
to be done.

179
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,655
<i>I first got
interested</i>

180
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:29,310
<i>in reporting
on multi-level marketing</i>

181
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:31,103
because I had noticed

182
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:33,931
that a lot of people
that I knew from growing up

183
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:36,827
on social media had
been joining MLMs.

184
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:38,689
Hey, girl, hey!

185
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,448
Hey, hey, hey, ladies!

186
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:43,689
Hey, girl, hey, happy Friday!

187
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:46,379
<i>The simplest way
to explain an MLM</i>

188
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:48,689
<i>or a multi-level marketing
company</i>

189
00:07:48,724 --> 00:07:51,793
<i>is that they recruit
individual retailers</i>

190
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:53,758
<i>to sell a product.</i>

191
00:07:53,793 --> 00:07:55,931
<i>And then those retailers</i>

192
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:58,620
<i>recruit other retailers.</i>

193
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:00,379
<i>The products can be anything.</i>

194
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,689
<i>It can be essential oils,</i>

195
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:04,448
<i>it can be herbal supplements,</i>

196
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:05,931
<i>it can be make-up</i>

197
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:07,689
<i>or it can be leggings.</i>

198
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:12,482
<i>LuLaRoe is the kind of MLM,</i>

199
00:08:12,517 --> 00:08:13,620
<i>they have a product,</i>

200
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,724
<i>banana leggings,</i>

201
00:08:15,758 --> 00:08:19,241
<i>and they're superior
to other banana leggings.</i>

202
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:22,448
<i>They're so superior
that you must sell them</i>

203
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:24,172
<i>door-to-door or to your
friends and family</i>

204
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:25,241
<i>or on a Facebook Live.</i>

205
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:28,000
<i>And that's how exclusive
this opportunity is.</i>

206
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:29,931
<i>And the way</i>

207
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:32,275
<i>the companies describe
how that works</i>

208
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,241
is you buy in,

209
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:36,068
you get a bunch of banana
leggings,

210
00:08:36,103 --> 00:08:37,724
you sell a bunch of banana
leggings.

211
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:39,103
All of your friends
at that party

212
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:40,758
that were buying
the banana leggings are like,

213
00:08:40,793 --> 00:08:43,034
"Wow, this is an amazing
business opportunity."

214
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:44,413
And you're like, "I know.

215
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:46,275
Would you like to sign up
underneath me?"

216
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,793
So, you sign people up
underneath you,

217
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,000
<i>and there's one rung
of people below you.</i>

218
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:51,034
<i>That's your downline.</i>

219
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:54,000
<i>Now, you're an upline.</i>

220
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:57,689
<i>And you get a slice of every
future purchase</i>

221
00:08:57,724 --> 00:08:58,862
<i>that they make.</i>

222
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:00,724
<i>So, it behooves an upline</i>

223
00:09:00,758 --> 00:09:03,758
<i>to encourage their downline
to stock up.</i>

224
00:09:07,517 --> 00:09:10,000
<i>The sales pitch
from the MLM company</i>

225
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:13,172
<i>is that, that is supposed
to continue on,</i>

226
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:14,344
kind of like a chain letter,

227
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,344
where you've got
your people under you.

228
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:18,000
Say you have ten, you know,

229
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:21,000
half of them are amazing
recruiters, they each get ten.

230
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:23,310
<i>Oh, my gosh, now you have,
like, 60 people</i>

231
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:25,241
<i>that you're getting
a slice of.</i>

232
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,551
<i>Then those people are also
supposed to be</i>

233
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:29,724
<i>just as ambitious.</i>

234
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:35,344
It's been a while
since we've shopped,

235
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,793
so I want to show you guys
what is new.

236
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,241
Do you have the daisies
in the medium?

237
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:40,413
I don't.

238
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:42,068
Here's another extra small.

239
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:44,068
It has cute little, uh,
typewriters

240
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:45,413
with little sweet notes on it.

241
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:47,517
I think that the Internet

242
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:50,344
helped people who pitch MLMs
as an opportunity,

243
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:51,862
as a business opportunity.

244
00:09:51,896 --> 00:09:55,413
I think it helped them
over an early hurdle,

245
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:58,724
which is, who am I
gonna recruit.

246
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:00,413
Social media has been

247
00:10:00,448 --> 00:10:03,172
like gasoline on the fire
of MLMs.

248
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:05,758
I am so beyond excited,

249
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:07,413
I'm about to spontaneously
combust.

250
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:08,620
I don't know what you get,

251
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't know what I'm
gonna give away,

252
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:11,310
but it's gonna be something
good.

253
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,344
<i>Instead of just
having a party at your house,</i>

254
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:16,413
<i>where you can invite people
who could physically
get there,</i>

255
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:18,448
you can have an online party

256
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:20,931
where you can invite everyone
you know,

257
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:22,586
plus invite them to invite
everyone they know.

258
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,241
And, you know, you can get
these Facebook groups

259
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:26,137
that have like 30,000 people
in them.

260
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:28,000
So if you're thinking
about doing it,

261
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:29,172
I would encourage you to do it

262
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:30,793
'cause it's been such
a blessing.

263
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:33,793
<i>So it just makes
it even easier</i>

264
00:10:33,827 --> 00:10:35,344
<i>to recruit people.</i>

265
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:38,137
If you are interested
in all of the opportunity,

266
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,310
please feel free to reach out
with me.

267
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:41,862
<i>"Let me ask
you a question.</i>

268
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:45,551
Have you ever thought
about potentially working
on a side hustle?

269
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:46,931
You're such a badass.

270
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:49,000
I think you would be amazing
at this opportunity

271
00:10:49,034 --> 00:10:50,827
I recently got involved with.

272
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:52,172
I know this sounds crazy,

273
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:54,137
but I've made a little bit
of side cash.

274
00:10:54,172 --> 00:10:56,137
Let me tell you more about it.
Lol.

275
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:58,482
Here's my number, call me soon
or text me, 'kay?"

276
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:02,517
Oh, my gosh, guys,
I got rained on so bad.

277
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:05,241
I was delivering LuLaRoe,
like all day.

278
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:07,000
<i>I think LuLaRoe
is kind of an example</i>

279
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:10,655
of like the American
work ethos on steroids.

280
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:13,689
Sometimes, you feel like,
"I only have this much

281
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:15,482
and I'm strung out.

282
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:17,655
I cannot do it anymore."

283
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:19,172
Get out there, get busy,

284
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:22,034
enjoy, have fun
and serve your customers.

285
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:23,137
Serve your community.

286
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:27,517
<i>DeAnne and Mark Stidham</i>

287
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:29,034
<i>are the founders of LuLaRoe.</i>

288
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,862
So DeAnne is Mormon

289
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:35,034
<i>and she was raised
in a Mormon family</i>

290
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:37,517
<i>that's basically
Mormon royalty.</i>

291
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,758
<i>DeAnne's descended
from the brother</i>

292
00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:45,137
<i>of the man who founded
the Mormon church.</i>

293
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,551
<i>Because of that relationship</i>

294
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:50,172
<i>to the founding of the church,</i>

295
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:53,482
<i>there would have been
a sense of exceptionalism</i>

296
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:55,000
<i>within the family.</i>

297
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:57,241
There is a huge amount
of overlap

298
00:11:57,275 --> 00:12:00,310
between Mormons
and the MLM community.

299
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,862
<i>Mormons are born
and bred missionaries,</i>

300
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:05,068
<i>and that skillset</i>

301
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:07,034
<i>becomes really useful</i>

302
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:09,758
<i>when you're trying to get
people to join</i>

303
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:12,206
this once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

304
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:20,241
I grew up in the same, uh,
Mormon circles

305
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:21,965
as DeAnne.

306
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,413
<i>Like, I remember her presence,</i>

307
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:26,068
<i>I remember how her perfume
and makeup</i>

308
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:27,551
<i>and hairspray smelled.</i>

309
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:30,896
She was incredibly outgoing.

310
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:32,379
<i>There are some people
that just always seem</i>

311
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:33,931
<i>like they're selling
something.</i>

312
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:35,862
And they're always trying

313
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:38,586
to convert you to something,
right?

314
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,413
And as a child,

315
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:42,620
<i>I sensed that about her.</i>

316
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:46,275
And I will tell you,
even if you're selling
ten items a day,

317
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,551
you're making a difference.

318
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:49,931
You decided that you could

319
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:53,137
the minute you said,
"I'm gonna do LuLaRoe."

320
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,241
<i>I think the cult
of personality around DeAnne</i>

321
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,758
<i>probably helped
a lot in the beginning.</i>

322
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,206
<i>She is very flashy,</i>

323
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:01,275
<i>lots of jewelry,
lots of makeup.</i>

324
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,448
She cannot stay off
of her phone

325
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,000
<i>and posting pictures
of herself</i>

326
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,379
<i>and doing live videos</i>

327
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:07,827
<i>and being on Instagram Live,</i>

328
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:09,655
and it's mesmerizing.

329
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,344
Hey, everybody.
I am so excited.

330
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:14,620
It is enthusiastic Thursday.

331
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:17,103
I am in love with this hat.

332
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:22,655
<i>The origin story
of DeAnne's business,</i>

333
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:25,827
it's attractive
to a lot of new recruits.

334
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:28,448
<i>I had one kid
on a hip and I was pregnant,</i>

335
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:30,482
and a couple of kids
in the stroller.

336
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:33,034
<i>DeAnne has this very</i>

337
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:35,517
<i>humble and inspiring
origin story</i>

338
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:37,862
<i>that she is sure
to repeat all the time.</i>

339
00:13:37,896 --> 00:13:40,482
How she started
as this single mother

340
00:13:40,517 --> 00:13:44,034
who was selling maxi skirts
out of the trunk of her car.

341
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:45,586
<i>And I said,
"I'm coming.</i>

342
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,034
<i>Invite all your friends</i>

343
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:49,275
<i>and we're gonna have
a maxi skirt party,"</i>

344
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,103
and they go, "Okay,
count me in, DeAnne."

345
00:13:51,137 --> 00:13:52,965
And no matter how many I did,

346
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,965
uh, I just kept booking
more and more.

347
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,344
<i>And we started
a conversation about,</i>

348
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:00,206
<i>"Don't you think there's
probably other women</i>

349
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:03,517
that would want the same
opportunity you've had

350
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,379
to earn extra money
while still having the freedom

351
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,724
around their schedule,
to be a stay-at-home mom

352
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:10,620
or take care of their kids?"

353
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:12,379
<i>The house parties
were making a lot of money</i>

354
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:14,517
<i>and the skirts
were very popular.</i>

355
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:17,241
And soon other women,
like Brittany Hunter,

356
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:19,172
who was the first retailer
for LuLaRoe,

357
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,724
um, wanted in.

358
00:14:21,758 --> 00:14:23,827
They wanted to know how
they could sell the skirts.

359
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,275
I'm the first retailer
of LuLaRoe,

360
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,068
but technically it wasn't
called LuLaRoe

361
00:14:28,103 --> 00:14:30,034
in the beginning,
so it's been nine years.

362
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:32,379
And it was, um,

363
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,068
August of 2012,
I'm pretty sure,

364
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:36,413
when I had my very first
maxi skirt party with DeAnne

365
00:14:37,137 --> 00:14:38,931
<i>and loved it.</i>

366
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:41,379
<i>Absolutely fell in love
with people coming to my house</i>

367
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,896
<i>and the camaraderie
and the excitement.</i>

368
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:45,758
<i>I called her the next day,
I'm like, "I wanna do this.</i>

369
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,517
<i>I need more skirts.
How do I get more skirts?"</i>

370
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,000
<i>It was her and I just
selling maxi skirts,</i>

371
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:52,551
and she was still doing
her parties

372
00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:54,689
and I would do some
around southern Utah.

373
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:56,896
And, yeah,
that's kind of where it began.

374
00:14:58,655 --> 00:14:59,931
<i>So, it works very well</i>

375
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,068
<i>that as a part
of DeAnne's origin story,</i>

376
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,517
this business
to recruit other people

377
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:08,413
or get other women involved
wasn't even her idea.

378
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:10,586
It just fell upon her.

379
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,482
<i>It's this American dream saga.</i>

380
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:16,137
<i>She was just like you.
She wasn't special.</i>

381
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:19,965
She wasn't rich.
She wasn't #blessed.

382
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,827
She just worked really hard.

383
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:24,689
She was your, you know,
your average suburban
wife and mother,

384
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,965
and look at everything
she accomplished.

385
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:38,965
But the story of Mark
and DeAnne and LuLaRoe,

386
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,310
it's not really about them.

387
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:42,551
It's really about
the thousands

388
00:15:42,586 --> 00:15:45,068
upon thousands of women

389
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:48,827
<i>who fell prey to the promises
of feeling worthy</i>

390
00:15:48,862 --> 00:15:50,965
<i>and being a part
of something bigger</i>

391
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,620
<i>and having impact
and the sisterhood</i>

392
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:57,000
and are now telling
their story.

393
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:12,931
<i>Before I started
LuLaRoe in 2016,</i>

394
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:14,827
I just felt kind of lost,

395
00:16:14,862 --> 00:16:16,448
and I feel like
when I found LuLaRoe,

396
00:16:16,482 --> 00:16:19,586
I'm like, "This is clicking,
like, finally,

397
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,931
this is something
that I can do."

398
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:32,551
<i>I actually went down
to a convention</i>

399
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:34,413
<i>in Corona, California,</i>

400
00:16:34,448 --> 00:16:37,413
<i>and there were so many
retailers from across
the country coming.</i>

401
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:39,172
I was like,
"Wow, this is awesome.

402
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,586
I'm part
of this big movement."

403
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,793
<i>DeAnne spoke
at that convention,</i>

404
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:46,310
and I was eating up
every word she was saying.

405
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:49,137
I think I even got teary-eyed,
like, listening to her story.

406
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:50,724
<i>You know,
when she was explaining</i>

407
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:52,482
<i>her struggles before starting,</i>

408
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:54,965
I kind of related to that.

409
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,793
And, like, that's how
I got emotional too,

410
00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:59,482
because I felt like I wasn't
where I was supposed to be,

411
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:02,379
until I found LuLaRoe.

412
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:04,172
And I just...
that really spoke to me.

413
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:07,965
This is LuLaRoe.

414
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,862
I have so much stuff. Sorry.

415
00:17:11,275 --> 00:17:12,724
Oh, here we go.

416
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:15,034
This one has
the LuLaRoe logo in it.

417
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh, and I have
matching leggings to this,

418
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:19,137
so you literally have a...
it's called a Lula outfit.

419
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:24,034
<i>I knew it cost a lot to join,</i>

420
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:29,034
<i>so I went to my mom
and I asked her,</i>

421
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:32,379
<i>"Is there any way
that I could borrow $10,000?"</i>

422
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:34,517
<i>She was very skeptical
at first,</i>

423
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:36,000
<i>but when I was explaining it
to her,</i>

424
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:37,827
<i>I like, kind of
broke down in tears</i>

425
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:40,310
<i>because I just felt
so passionate about it.</i>

426
00:17:40,344 --> 00:17:41,896
And she agreed

427
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:45,448
and she agreed to take money
from her 401to help me.

428
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,000
Hi, guys, Jill here.

429
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:49,758
Um, I'm kind of testingsomething a little bit different today.

430
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:52,413
I'm going to be doing $5
off each Julia

431
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:54,034
and free shipping.

432
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:57,482
<i>I had been hyping it up
on Facebook, social media,</i>

433
00:17:57,517 --> 00:18:01,034
and so I had friends
from high school and college
come and shop,

434
00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:03,068
and that helped
push that first month

435
00:18:03,103 --> 00:18:04,793
to $10,000 in sales.

436
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:06,137
So, up next, you guys, I have

437
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:09,068
an extra-large green Carly.

438
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:12,413
This is legging soft material.
It's a green heather.

439
00:18:12,448 --> 00:18:15,724
<i>I felt like
LuLaRoe's message
was "Everybody is beautiful."</i>

440
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:18,655
Our size ranges
would go up to a size 18-20,

441
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:21,310
so I feel like
it was really size-inclusive.

442
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:23,965
And I felt like
that drew a lot of women in.

443
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,137
Carlies do run
two to three sizes big.

444
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:29,310
So, this looks really cute
with it knotted up, you know?

445
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:31,241
It was really cool.
It was so exciting.

446
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:33,379
My customers loved
the outfits I put together.

447
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:36,103
<i>My second month,
I went to $15,000,</i>

448
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:37,896
and I was just blown away

449
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:41,034
about, like, how much money
I could get by doing this.

450
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:42,655
So, these are medium

451
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,586
and it is dipped
with striped, stripes.

452
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,620
Super, super cute.

453
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:48,551
It was a whirlwind,

454
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,137
and our first month,
we sold $21,000.

455
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:54,275
And then it just grew so fast.

456
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,379
Take my challenge.

457
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:58,137
Get out there
and find five people a day.

458
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:00,068
Go out and talk to them.

459
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:03,655
I listen to DeAnne every day,
you know, on Instagram,

460
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:06,344
and it really gave me
a huge boost in confidence.

461
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,517
And your goal
is to develop a relationship

462
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:11,965
with those people that you
come in contact with, okay?

463
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,172
That was another aspect of
what was recruiting.

464
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:16,206
I had girls
who signed up under me.

465
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:17,965
I was able
to build a team of ten

466
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,379
to become the rank of trainer.

467
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:20,551
When you became a trainer,

468
00:19:20,586 --> 00:19:23,137
that's when you got
the gold watch.

469
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:25,310
<i>I couldn't wait to get
that gold watch.</i>

470
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:27,103
It was a goal
I strived for,

471
00:19:27,137 --> 00:19:29,034
like, "I have to earn
that watch."

472
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:32,000
Like, "I will do anything
to earn this watch."

473
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:34,724
<i>I hit trainer. I mean,
that's where the money was at.</i>

474
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,620
And then you didn't have
to stress on your sales.

475
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,724
And then we have this beauty.

476
00:19:38,758 --> 00:19:41,000
<i>So you start out
just as a retailer,</i>

477
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:43,137
which means that you're just
selling for yourself

478
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:44,655
and you're getting
your own sales.

479
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:46,034
<i>Then you can move on
to sponsor,</i>

480
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:48,275
<i>which means you have
people under you.</i>

481
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,275
<i>And then after that,
it goes trainer,</i>

482
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,793
<i>coach, mentor, ambassador.</i>

483
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:55,862
<i>And so basically,
all that really means is</i>

484
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:57,689
<i>you just have more
and more people under you.</i>

485
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:59,689
<i>Since the early MLMs,</i>

486
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:02,172
<i>one of the exercises
you do at the beginning</i>

487
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:04,448
<i>is writing down 10 or 50...</i>

488
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:06,344
I think LuLaRoe does 50 names,

489
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:08,310
um, that you're supposed
to write down of people

490
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:10,103
you could possibly recruit.

491
00:20:10,137 --> 00:20:12,482
<i>In church communities,
Mormonism</i>

492
00:20:12,517 --> 00:20:14,862
<i>especially, those networks,</i>

493
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:17,379
it doesn't take
any time at all

494
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:18,793
to think of those 50 names.

495
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:22,620
<i>And so DeAnne
was able to tap</i>

496
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,689
<i>into this preexisting
Mormon network</i>

497
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:29,689
<i>so that she could not
sell leggings</i>

498
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:33,862
but sell um... like, hope.

499
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:38,689
<i>LuLaRoe's
marketing strategy</i>

500
00:20:38,724 --> 00:20:41,068
was very family-oriented,

501
00:20:41,103 --> 00:20:43,448
like so we could help mothers
support their children.

502
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:45,862
<i>We have people
starting right now,</i>

503
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:47,862
<i>who are doing incredible
things for their family.</i>

504
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:50,482
<i>She wanted to be
a stay-at-home mom,</i>

505
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,034
<i>but has the freedom
to come and go</i>

506
00:20:52,068 --> 00:20:53,206
<i>and do what she wanted to do.</i>

507
00:20:54,344 --> 00:20:58,034
How many women
would like an opportunity

508
00:20:58,068 --> 00:21:01,379
to earn income
while staying at home?

509
00:21:01,413 --> 00:21:05,241
I had title after title, mom,
sister, daughter, girlfriend,

510
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:06,689
but I hadn't figured out

511
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:10,000
what my individual
purpose was.

512
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:12,758
The idea of, um,

513
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:14,413
you know, making money
from home

514
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:17,551
with two small children
was ideal.

515
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:19,068
I was used to making money.

516
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:20,517
I was used to contributing

517
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:22,724
to the household bills
and everything,

518
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:25,689
um, and I wanted that answer
to staying at home

519
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:28,379
and still being able
to raise my daughter.

520
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:32,413
So, um, you know, I heard
the term "Moms Losing Money".

521
00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:36,724
That's what MLM stands for,
is Moms Losing Money.

522
00:21:36,758 --> 00:21:40,172
Um, and so it's not something
that appealed to me

523
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:43,689
because it...
it didn't make sense to me.

524
00:21:43,724 --> 00:21:45,448
It didn't make sense or cents.

525
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:47,275
We started this business
on the premise

526
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,758
that you could make full-time
income on a part-time...

527
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:50,931
part-time work.

528
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:53,724
Yes, full-time pay
for part-time work.

529
00:21:54,206 --> 00:21:55,931
It's... that's...

530
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:58,931
If that doesn't define an MLM,
I don't know what does,

531
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:03,310
because as
a "real" entrepreneur,

532
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:05,827
full-time pay, full-time work,

533
00:22:05,862 --> 00:22:09,793
24/7, 365,
losing sleep, losing money.

534
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:12,000
That is the entrepreneur life.

535
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,620
<i>I always say that besides
being an entrepreneur,</i>

536
00:22:17,655 --> 00:22:20,482
<i>being a mother
is one of the loneliest things
you can do.</i>

537
00:22:20,517 --> 00:22:22,620
<i>It costs more to keep
your kids in daycare</i>

538
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:23,827
<i>than it is for you to work</i>

539
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:25,620
<i>and then, you know,
pay for that.</i>

540
00:22:25,655 --> 00:22:27,758
So, it makes sense
for a lot of women

541
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:29,275
to stay home
and take care of their kids

542
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,137
and they... but they want
to feel productive, right?

543
00:22:31,172 --> 00:22:32,689
They miss
their nine-to-five life.

544
00:22:32,724 --> 00:22:34,689
They miss... you know,
once you become a mom,

545
00:22:34,724 --> 00:22:36,275
it's a different
group of friends.

546
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,862
So, you miss that community,
a sense of community.

547
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:44,000
<i>And so when you see
other moms being boss babes,</i>

548
00:22:44,034 --> 00:22:46,000
<i>that's something
that you want.</i>

549
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:54,896
<i>Whatever I do in life,</i>

550
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:57,068
<i>I want to be
the very best I can be.</i>

551
00:22:57,103 --> 00:22:58,689
<i>So, if I'm a LuLaRoe retailer,</i>

552
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:00,379
<i>I wanna be
the best one I can be.</i>

553
00:23:01,275 --> 00:23:03,586
If I have kids,
I'm gonna have 11.

554
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:05,689
<i>Girls, bring him down.</i>

555
00:23:05,724 --> 00:23:08,724
I'm bringing him down,
see, he's pulling me.

556
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:15,068
Whoa. Slow down, baby.

557
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,379
<i>It's pure craziness.</i>

558
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:19,000
<i>So, we're Christians,</i>

559
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:20,310
<i>we're members
of the Church of Christ.</i>

560
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:22,586
<i>We had four kids,</i>

561
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,172
<i>but then
we went on a mission trip</i>

562
00:23:24,896 --> 00:23:26,379
<i>and we stayed in an orphanage.</i>

563
00:23:27,344 --> 00:23:28,517
<i>I'm a stay-at-home mom</i>

564
00:23:28,551 --> 00:23:30,137
and Kenny had
a really good job,

565
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:31,413
so why not adopt?

566
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:34,689
That's how 11 happens.

567
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:36,000
So...

568
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:38,689
<i>I would say
that our generation</i>

569
00:23:38,724 --> 00:23:40,413
<i>is just a bunch of strong</i>

570
00:23:40,448 --> 00:23:42,034
<i>stay-at-home moms</i>

571
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:44,551
<i>and a lot of us joined
LuLaRoe</i>

572
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:46,310
<i>and that's what grew LuLaRoe.</i>

573
00:23:46,344 --> 00:23:48,827
It was who signed up,
saw the business opportunity

574
00:23:50,206 --> 00:23:51,310
<i>and ran with it.</i>

575
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:53,344
It's like a cool mom club.

576
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:58,620
<i>When I started,
we didn't go live,</i>

577
00:23:58,655 --> 00:24:01,034
<i>we just did in home pop-ups.</i>

578
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:03,827
<i>It was just girls shopping.
Just like a big party.</i>

579
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:05,827
<i>A lot of fun.</i>

580
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,689
<i>This is nice.
Is this the back or the front?</i>

581
00:24:07,724 --> 00:24:08,793
It's reversible.

582
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:10,551
I like options.

583
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:14,241
Wendi, Wendi.

584
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:15,965
<i>I have
some of the best friends</i>

585
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,620
<i>from that because</i>

586
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:20,275
<i>I feel like, even though
LuLaRoe pushed community,</i>

587
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,586
we had then to create
true community

588
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,206
to make it work.

589
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:25,931
I know, Tracy,
the Shirleys are on point

590
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,448
and I have a new box
coming tomorrow.

591
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:29,517
It's going to be good.

592
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,034
Your desire to succeed.

593
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:34,551
Your commitment
to your, to your goals

594
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:37,724
and your commitment
to not letting yourself down

595
00:24:37,758 --> 00:24:39,620
<i>will make
all of the difference.</i>

596
00:24:39,655 --> 00:24:41,206
<i>Remember, your business</i>

597
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:42,896
<i>is not going to grow
without you.</i>

598
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:44,931
Now, we also want you

599
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:47,137
to strive
for getting on the cruise.

600
00:24:48,827 --> 00:24:51,068
<i>It was a goal
to cruise qualify.</i>

601
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:52,724
<i>There was
three different tiers,</i>

602
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:53,862
and so of course, I wanted

603
00:24:53,896 --> 00:24:55,068
the highest ranking tier.

604
00:24:55,103 --> 00:24:57,827
That meant you got
a better room in the cruise.

605
00:24:57,862 --> 00:24:59,827
<i>The cruise was actually
something you qualified for</i>

606
00:24:59,862 --> 00:25:03,551
if you sold $12,000
for six months in a row.

607
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:07,137
You are that person that gets

608
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,103
and deserves anything
that you choose for it to be.

609
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:13,724
<i>Go, go, go.
Prizes, cruises.</i>

610
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:16,896
<i>I just really, really
enjoy working for that.</i>

611
00:25:17,862 --> 00:25:19,068
For something.

612
00:25:19,103 --> 00:25:21,206
Because then it doesn't seem
like a job, then it was fun.

613
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:25,517
<i>LuLaRoe cruise ship,
all LuLaRoe people.</i>

614
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:27,000
And if you've been to any
LuLaRoe event,

615
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:28,827
you know at LuLaRoe
everything's a party

616
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,310
- and super fun.
- Yes, it's not the same.

617
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,896
<i>You never wanna
miss a cruise.</i>

618
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,620
And we can't wait to see you
on the next cruise.

619
00:25:36,655 --> 00:25:38,172
We are so excited.

620
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:02,724
<i>I'm always
trying to find things
on the Internet</i>

621
00:26:02,758 --> 00:26:04,517
<i>that will resonate
with people.</i>

622
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:06,551
So I cover influencers,

623
00:26:06,586 --> 00:26:08,275
things going viral
on the Internet.

624
00:26:09,482 --> 00:26:11,965
<i>So, LuLaRoe in their heyday,</i>

625
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,103
they had these cruises

626
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:17,827
that were like candy
for social media,

627
00:26:17,862 --> 00:26:19,965
<i>like, if you follow
all of the top sellers</i>

628
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,275
<i>of LuLaRoe on Instagram</i>

629
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,172
<i>and they're all on this cruise
at the same time,</i>

630
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:26,103
<i>and they're posting
#BecauseOfLuLaRoe,</i>

631
00:26:26,137 --> 00:26:28,137
"I'm having a pina colada
on the beach,

632
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,206
and I'm in the Caribbean

633
00:26:29,241 --> 00:26:30,655
and I'm doing this
and I'm doing that."

634
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,379
And it's like, "Duh,
of course I want to do this."

635
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,620
<i>And it's all part of just
like feeding into this notion</i>

636
00:26:39,655 --> 00:26:41,655
<i>that if you work hard enough,</i>

637
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:43,620
<i>you will get all of these
amazing things,</i>

638
00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:44,862
<i>like, you will get
this free trip,</i>

639
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:46,275
<i>you'll get to meet
Mark and DeAnne,</i>

640
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,482
who are like superstars.

641
00:26:49,344 --> 00:26:52,551
<i>And there's this one clip
of LuLaRoe's cruise</i>

642
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:54,965
<i>and there's this scene
where, like,</i>

643
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,310
<i>they're all out on the deck</i>

644
00:26:57,344 --> 00:26:59,655
<i>and they're all
dancing and partying,</i>

645
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:03,931
and DeAnne and Mark
jump into the pool

646
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:06,068
that's in the middle
of this deck on this ship.

647
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:17,172
<i>They're in the pool
in their clothes,</i>

648
00:27:17,206 --> 00:27:20,206
<i>and it's just this like...
The Great Gatsby-esque shot.</i>

649
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,034
They're just in the center
of this universe.

650
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:28,793
MLM conferences

651
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:33,551
are like a cross between
an evangelical tent revival.

652
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:36,758
You shall not die,
but you shall live.

653
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:39,206
<i>A Tony Robbins conference,</i>

654
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:43,379
<i>a nightclub
discotheque extravaganza</i>

655
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,172
<i>and a Katy Perry concert.</i>

656
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:48,931
<i>In fact, Katy Perry did
perform at a LuLaRoe event.</i>

657
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:52,068
<i>So they're really
just there to inspire,</i>

658
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:55,206
to create
that sense of transcendence,

659
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,620
to burn all of the messages

660
00:27:57,655 --> 00:27:59,655
that have been
delivered virtually

661
00:27:59,689 --> 00:28:03,517
into the recruits' brains.

662
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:07,000
<i>When you participate
in a group language ritual</i>

663
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:09,000
<i>with other people
doing the same thing,</i>

664
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:13,137
<i>it has a physiological
de-stressing effect on you.</i>

665
00:28:13,172 --> 00:28:15,448
Your cortisol levels go down,

666
00:28:15,482 --> 00:28:18,448
your serotonin
and dopamine spike.

667
00:28:18,482 --> 00:28:20,482
This is why so many people

668
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:25,034
have profound conversion
events when they go to church

669
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:28,517
and listen to religious music
or speak in tongues.

670
00:28:28,551 --> 00:28:30,241
These are bonding events.

671
00:28:32,034 --> 00:28:35,103
<i>It's about
that person up at the top,</i>

672
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:37,827
<i>speaking to their flock,</i>

673
00:28:37,862 --> 00:28:40,344
and in order
for that person at the top

674
00:28:40,379 --> 00:28:43,620
to be rich and to give
blessings down below,

675
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,137
<i>the people from the bottom
must give, they must tithe.</i>

676
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,655
<i>So you need recruitment.</i>

677
00:28:49,689 --> 00:28:51,689
<i>It's not really
about the product.</i>

678
00:28:51,724 --> 00:28:53,068
<i>They're selling a dream,
right?</i>

679
00:28:53,103 --> 00:28:54,655
<i>They're just, they're not
selling the reality,</i>

680
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:55,931
they're selling the dream.

681
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,413
Ready.

682
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:13,965
<i>I do think LuLaRoe
was trying to sell</i>

683
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,344
<i>the American dream.</i>

684
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:17,965
That was horrible.

685
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,517
I remember
their mission statement.

686
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:20,586
It was...

687
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:24,896
...bless... blessing, uh,

688
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:27,655
blessing lives
and strengthening families.

689
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:35,172
It was... nothing
but positivity and joy

690
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:39,724
and... and this could be you,
this could be you.

691
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:42,241
It really just seemed
like a wonderland.

692
00:29:49,068 --> 00:29:50,068
Argh!

693
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,000
Let's go!

694
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:01,896
So the first time
I ever encountered LuLaRoe,

695
00:30:02,862 --> 00:30:04,827
I was on a family cruise

696
00:30:04,862 --> 00:30:07,241
<i>and we were just
out on the beach</i>

697
00:30:07,275 --> 00:30:10,689
<i>and enjoying,
enjoying our time.</i>

698
00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:15,965
And there was this guy
playing Michael Jackson.

699
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,586
<i>And so I just go
and I start dancing.</i>

700
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:24,034
<i>This guy came
and approached me</i>

701
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:26,965
<i>and said, "Hey, if I give you
$100,</i>

702
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
<i>will you wear
some female leggings</i>

703
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:31,896
<i>and come and do
the same thing you just did</i>

704
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,310
<i>tomorrow morning
at this business meeting?"</i>

705
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:36,310
And I was just like, $100?

706
00:30:36,344 --> 00:30:37,896
Making money on vaca...

707
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:39,655
Yeah, yeah.

708
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:41,379
You best believe
I'm... I'm there.

709
00:30:44,172 --> 00:30:45,517
<i>So I showed up</i>

710
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:48,413
and I just sat
in the back as a surprise.

711
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:50,827
Elijah! Elijah! Elijah!

712
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:54,724
He, you know, hyped up
the crowd and everything.

713
00:30:54,758 --> 00:30:58,068
Give it up for Elijah!

714
00:30:58,103 --> 00:31:01,068
<i>And then
I come in there
and I do my thing,</i>

715
00:31:01,103 --> 00:31:04,034
<i>you know, I just, I just
put it down, you know?</i>

716
00:31:16,517 --> 00:31:18,793
<i>Full, like,
pop and lock dance,</i>

717
00:31:18,827 --> 00:31:21,413
the ladies went crazy.
It was so fun.

718
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:23,862
Oh, I loved it.

719
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:40,137
<i>The whole atmosphere was just</i>

720
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,448
full of joy
and excitement, like

721
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:46,137
overwhelming joy
and excitement.

722
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:49,068
Oh, not to mention,
it was a wholesome party.

723
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:50,689
There was no alcohol.

724
00:31:50,724 --> 00:31:52,241
<i>So, I'm just like,</i>

725
00:31:52,275 --> 00:31:54,448
<i>"This is my place."</i>

726
00:31:54,482 --> 00:31:58,620
Like, you see how I am,
I'm a naturally just crazy and

727
00:31:58,655 --> 00:32:00,448
full of energy, I don't need

728
00:32:00,482 --> 00:32:02,172
anything to help me party.

729
00:32:04,793 --> 00:32:06,206
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

730
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:09,896
Wow. Good morning.
Oh, we're just
getting started.

731
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:13,310
You have no idea
how many amazing things
we have planned for you today

732
00:32:13,344 --> 00:32:15,172
and tomorrow. Oh, my gosh.

733
00:32:15,206 --> 00:32:17,034
And that's where
I met DeAnne and Mark.

734
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,689
<i>So they flew me out
to one of the conventions.</i>

735
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:32,000
LuLaRoe! LuLaRoe! LuLaRoe!

736
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,379
<i>And DeAnne</i>

737
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:40,137
called me on stage
to tell my "why",

738
00:32:41,482 --> 00:32:43,862
uh, and my mom
was in the crowd.

739
00:32:46,034 --> 00:32:47,482
<i>So, the "why"...</i>

740
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,448
How can I describe
"the why", it was...

741
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:54,379
Everyone has a "why",

742
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:57,551
like a sob story to...

743
00:32:58,517 --> 00:33:00,103
...make you relate.

744
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:05,206
<i>I, uh, told this crowd</i>

745
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:07,689
<i>my "why",
I definitely got emotional.</i>

746
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:10,517
'Cause all these people only
knew me as this hype man,
this...

747
00:33:11,413 --> 00:33:13,965
<i>crazy, rambunctious
kid that just</i>

748
00:33:14,965 --> 00:33:17,103
<i>thrives on positive energy.</i>

749
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:21,862
<i>I got emotional because
my mom was out there</i>

750
00:33:21,896 --> 00:33:24,068
and I was just like,
"Yeah, I'm grateful for her.

751
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:28,034
I want to become
successful enough to...
for her

752
00:33:28,068 --> 00:33:29,413
so that she
doesn't have to work

753
00:33:29,448 --> 00:33:30,758
ever again in her life."

754
00:33:31,206 --> 00:33:33,344
And...

755
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:35,241
that's when
DeAnne onboarded her.

756
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:38,965
<i>She pulled my mom on stage</i>

757
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,931
<i>and then she onboarded my
mom to become a consultant.</i>

758
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,206
And I was shocked.

759
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:47,689
I didn't know,
I was like,
"Me, a consultant?"

760
00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:49,275
I don't even know
what LuLaRoe is.

761
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,448
I didn't know anything,
you know,

762
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:52,862
so I just went with it.

763
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,103
So, when they were
coming up happy,

764
00:33:55,137 --> 00:33:57,068
I said, "Okay,"
you know, so...

765
00:33:57,862 --> 00:34:01,620
What am I wearing?
The Amelia.

766
00:34:01,655 --> 00:34:02,931
- Hey.
- How could you forget?

767
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:05,413
How could I forget?
I'm learning inventory.

768
00:34:05,448 --> 00:34:08,517
This is my newfound business.

769
00:34:08,551 --> 00:34:10,965
<i>So my mom
became a consultant</i>

770
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,620
<i>and my sister</i>

771
00:34:13,655 --> 00:34:16,517
<i>became a consultant
under my mom.</i>

772
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:18,793
She saw me making money
and she was like, "Okay,

773
00:34:18,827 --> 00:34:19,965
I want to do it.

774
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,275
I think I'm gonna
do it, Mom.

775
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,137
I think I'm gonna sign
on and everything."

776
00:34:23,172 --> 00:34:25,655
I said, "Okay, well, make sure
you sign under me because

777
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,310
I'll gain a percentage
of your sales.

778
00:34:28,344 --> 00:34:31,310
I'll make money off
the percentage of your sales."

779
00:34:31,344 --> 00:34:34,068
And so, she said
okay and sure enough, she did.

780
00:34:34,103 --> 00:34:35,241
Black and white cardigan.

781
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:36,931
You can match
with a lot of things,

782
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:39,344
like a mustard colored Carly.

783
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:41,275
What? You have to be fly.

784
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,793
You have to have that mindset.

785
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:44,137
You know, let's do this

786
00:34:44,172 --> 00:34:45,827
and fight and work
real hard at it.

787
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,103
Yeah. We are so blessed.

788
00:34:48,137 --> 00:34:50,172
You just don't know,
this company is the one.

789
00:34:50,206 --> 00:34:51,241
<i>For me,</i>

790
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:54,482
that was when I felt, "Wow,

791
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:58,103
they really are blessing

792
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,000
and strengthening families."

793
00:35:31,517 --> 00:35:33,793
<i>I am a widowed single mom</i>

794
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:38,275
and I am
a former LuLaRoe consultant,

795
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,034
and now I own
Decades Rock 'N' Pop.

796
00:35:42,068 --> 00:35:44,724
<i>Before that, it was</i>

797
00:35:44,758 --> 00:35:47,103
<i>a LuLaRoe branded Airstream.</i>

798
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:53,965
This is my new
boutique for LuLaRoe.

799
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,448
Everything on social media
was perfect with LuLaRoe.

800
00:35:57,482 --> 00:35:58,965
She is about to push.

801
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,275
She is adorable.

802
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,620
A person would post
a picture of their new car.

803
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:05,448
<i>♪BecauseOfLuLaRoe.</i>

804

00:36:12,482 --> 00:36:14,137
<i>Always #BecauseOfLuLaRoe.</i>

807
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,517
Of course me
with the Airstream,

808
00:36:17,482 --> 00:36:18,965
because of LuLaRoe.

809
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,206
<i>My entire lifestyle, really,</i>

810
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:24,000
<i>it all became everything
LuLaRoe.</i>

811
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,689
<i>There was definitely
a culture of toxic positivity</i>

812
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:32,689
<i>because of what you
were allowed to share</i>

813
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,827
<i>and what you weren't
allowed to share.</i>

814
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:37,137
<i>So you were allowed
to share everything positive,</i>

815
00:36:37,172 --> 00:36:40,172
<i>but if anything negative
showed up on your pages,</i>

816
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:43,517
under your comments,
under your sold comments,

817
00:36:43,551 --> 00:36:46,482
you were
supposed to delete it.

818
00:36:46,517 --> 00:36:48,448
<i>It never happened,
it was never on there.</i>

819
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,482
So when I get those messages
from my team that I go,

820
00:36:53,034 --> 00:36:54,482
"Oh, my gosh.

821
00:36:54,517 --> 00:36:56,413
Why has LuLaRoe done
this to me?"

822
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,517
Be an editor.

823
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,137
Use that delete button.

824
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:00,896
It's really powerful.

825
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:01,965
I could not

826
00:37:02,965 --> 00:37:05,034
count the number
of times I was reprimanded

827
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:06,689
for being "negative"

828
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,275
because I was
trying to address

829
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,724
legitimate business concerns.

830
00:37:11,758 --> 00:37:13,206
You know, if you complained,

831
00:37:13,241 --> 00:37:15,344
then you should,
you should just be grateful.

832
00:37:15,379 --> 00:37:18,413
If your business has
taken any kind of a dip,

833
00:37:18,448 --> 00:37:21,724
it's because you took
a slow thought process

834
00:37:21,758 --> 00:37:23,862
and got rubbernecking.

835
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:25,793
Got yourself thinking
about the negativity.

836
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,413
When I say, you had to
be sunshine and rainbows,

837
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,103
you did, no real talk.

838
00:37:31,137 --> 00:37:33,620
<i>Everything was boss
girl, boss babe.</i>

839
00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:35,068
<i>Stay at home
and work in your pajamas.</i>

840
00:37:35,103 --> 00:37:36,827
Just... just like everything,

841
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:38,413
everything,
everything was fake.

842
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,724
<i>It was very, very common
to see the higher ranks</i>

843
00:37:43,758 --> 00:37:45,724
<i>sitting on a top of maybe</i>

844
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:49,206
100 boxes of LuLaRoe

845
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:50,517
stacked up
in front of their house.

846
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:54,413
<i>So the way LuLaRoe's
structure worked</i>

847
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:57,551
<i>was that it was
a surprise box.</i>

848
00:37:57,586 --> 00:37:58,931
You didn't know
what you were getting.

849
00:37:58,965 --> 00:38:01,758
You could choose your styles,
but you never knew the print.

850
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:03,896
Today, I actually
have four boxes here.

851
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:05,862
Look how nice.

852
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:07,448
<i>You would say,
"Hey, Tuesday night,"</i>

853
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:09,827
<i>I'm going to open
this box live, Facebook Live,"</i>

854
00:38:09,862 --> 00:38:11,241
and you'd be excited.

855
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:13,137
These are gorgeous,
these might,

856
00:38:13,172 --> 00:38:16,586
might, might be my favorite.

857
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,655
<i>And people would start
claiming the second</i>

858
00:38:18,689 --> 00:38:20,310
you opened it up
and they wanted it.

859
00:38:20,344 --> 00:38:22,482
<i>That's how big
the LuLaRoe craze was.</i>

860
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:26,310
Favorite ever, you guys,
favorite ever.

861
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:28,448
But it also started
draining money right

862
00:38:28,482 --> 00:38:30,965
from the beginning.

863
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,655
<i>It was kind of like
playing a scratch off
lottery ticket</i>

864
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:34,758
<i>every time
you placed an order.</i>

865
00:38:37,517 --> 00:38:39,344
<i>It was very, very addicting.</i>

866
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:41,413
<i>And then, once you
start getting good boxes,</i>

867
00:38:41,448 --> 00:38:43,137
<i>you're like, "Oh, I'm gonna
order another one,</i>

868
00:38:44,482 --> 00:38:46,000
because I sold half my box."

869
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:48,827
Well, you sold half your box,

870
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:50,448
you're really
not making anything.

871
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:03,068
Oh, my leg.

872
00:39:04,206 --> 00:39:06,206
- Got it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

873
00:39:06,241 --> 00:39:08,172
Mama, what's this one?

874
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:11,551
- Okay, so that
is the perfect tee.
- Yes.

875
00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:13,965
That's actually what
I have on, but I tied it.
Yes.

876
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Ma, do you have
any unicorn leggings?

877
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:18,000
- These... I had...
- Unicorn.

878
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:19,896
What do you think
about that, Zip?

879
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:22,206
Oh, I...
- These kiwis.

880
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:23,586
Hang on, let's see where.

881
00:39:26,379 --> 00:39:28,413
So, what a unicorn is,

882
00:39:28,448 --> 00:39:32,551
it would be like
a very unique print,

883
00:39:32,586 --> 00:39:36,172
<i>a hot commodity
that everyone had to have,</i>

884
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:38,241
<i>almost like you
can flaunt with it</i>

885
00:39:38,827 --> 00:39:40,068
and be like, "Yeah,

886
00:39:41,103 --> 00:39:42,620
I got something
that you don't have."

887
00:39:42,655 --> 00:39:43,724
This one is a...

888
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:45,172
Ooh. Those are kind of cool.

889
00:39:45,206 --> 00:39:47,379
That's an owl with
the headphones on.

890
00:39:47,413 --> 00:39:50,517
- These are huge unicorns.
- LuLaRoe.

891
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:52,827
Because it's the shades with

892
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:55,241
LuLaRoe emblem
on these things.

893
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:56,344
Come on now.

894
00:39:56,379 --> 00:39:58,620
I know one for a fact was

895
00:39:58,655 --> 00:40:00,724
all black leggings like,

896
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:03,827
if you got
all black leggings, then,

897
00:40:04,413 --> 00:40:06,241
oh, you got it like, it

898
00:40:06,724 --> 00:40:08,206
sold instantly.

899
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:10,310
- Oh, those are fly.
- I know these are fire,

900
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:13,344
but I don't know
if they would be unicorns.

901
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:15,379
- No, maybe not.
- They're unicorn to me.
Mmm-hmm

902
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,413
I mean, people would tell
they had like

903
00:40:18,448 --> 00:40:19,827
hundreds of pairs of LuLaRoe,

904
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:22,172
like more leggings
than you could ever wear.

905
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:24,896
It was like
a collecting kind of craze.

906
00:40:24,931 --> 00:40:26,655
They created their own,

907
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:29,413
um, hysteria around
these leggings.

908
00:40:29,448 --> 00:40:32,724
You know,
as a business person,
I'm like, I was like, smart.

909
00:40:32,758 --> 00:40:34,724
- Do you wanna follow us?
- Yeah.

910
00:40:34,758 --> 00:40:36,655
Do you wanna follow us
through the warehouse
a little bit?

911
00:40:36,689 --> 00:40:40,655
You have to see the amazing
pieces that are here.

912
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,034
Look at these.

913
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:44,379
DeAnne just scored two

914
00:40:44,413 --> 00:40:46,137
Tie Dye Carlys.

915
00:40:46,172 --> 00:40:47,206
Yeah. Because you know what?

916
00:40:47,241 --> 00:40:49,034
I am the owner,
and I never get Tie Dyes

917
00:40:49,068 --> 00:40:51,344
'cause you guys
all buy them up so fast.

918
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:53,103
It has been
the best day of my life.

919
00:40:53,137 --> 00:40:55,379
Well, look at them.
Look at everybody's busy,
busy, busy,

920
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:57,620
pulling your orders.
So get out there and order,
order, order, order

921
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,586
more fresh stuff, yo.

922
00:41:08,724 --> 00:41:09,827
<i>Before LuLaRoe,</i>

923
00:41:09,862 --> 00:41:12,413
<i>by all accounts,
Mark and DeAnne were</i>

924
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,931
<i>a semi-normal family.</i>

925
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:18,000
<i>They had a pretty modest
house for California.</i>

926
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,275
<i>After LuLaRoe,</i>

927
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,655
<i>they have balled out for sure.</i>

928
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:30,206
<i>They bought this extremely</i>

929
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:32,448
<i>lavish Wyoming ranch</i>

930
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:35,931
<i>that they host their
family on a lot,</i>

931
00:41:35,965 --> 00:41:38,482
<i>and it's very
glamorous looking.</i>

932
00:41:39,827 --> 00:41:43,137
<i>Mark has also used his wealth</i>

933
00:41:43,172 --> 00:41:46,034
<i>to buy a lot of luxury cars.</i>

934
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:48,551
<i>One of them broke
the land speed record.</i>

935
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,034
<i>The Stidhams flaunted that
they were becoming wealthy</i>

936
00:41:54,068 --> 00:41:55,862
<i>because that is kind of</i>

937
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:58,793
<i>part of the company model,
right?</i>

938
00:41:58,827 --> 00:42:01,758
<i>Like, you want
to show how successful</i>

939
00:42:01,793 --> 00:42:04,000
<i>you're being because</i>

940
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:06,827
that will inspire other
people to try it as well.

941
00:42:06,862 --> 00:42:08,793
<i>We are in...
Gucci, shopping.</i>

942
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:11,206
<i>Look at these girls
and look how cute.</i>

943
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:12,448
<i>This is what we do.</i>

944
00:42:12,482 --> 00:42:15,137
<i>DeAnne was what
these women thought</i>

945
00:42:15,172 --> 00:42:17,862
<i>they could become if they
just had enough money.</i>

946
00:42:22,689 --> 00:42:25,655
The millionaire mindset
or a thought of

947
00:42:26,068 --> 00:42:28,344
how can I become

948
00:42:29,517 --> 00:42:31,793
and strive
with the opportunities

949
00:42:31,827 --> 00:42:33,620
that are right
in front of me.

950
00:42:33,655 --> 00:42:35,724
<i>Family is very important
to the Stidhams,</i>

951
00:42:35,758 --> 00:42:38,551
<i>so DeAnne hired basically
all of her children</i>

952
00:42:38,586 --> 00:42:40,448
<i>in one capacity or another.</i>

953
00:42:40,482 --> 00:42:43,620
We want to introduce
you to our family,

954
00:42:43,655 --> 00:42:45,344
which also happens to be

955
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:47,965
a core part
of the home office team.

956
00:42:50,379 --> 00:42:51,793
<i>Mark and I thought about</i>

957
00:42:51,827 --> 00:42:53,172
<i>the people that we wanted most</i>

958
00:42:53,206 --> 00:42:54,655
<i>to be involved were our kids.</i>

959
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:56,000
We knew they could help us.

960
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:58,206
I remember
my parents just saying,

961
00:42:58,241 --> 00:42:59,586
"We want to present
the opportunity

962
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,689
to our kids first."

963
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:03,758
They wanted us to be
a part of something that

964
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:05,379
they were seeing success

965
00:43:05,413 --> 00:43:07,206
and they didn't
want it for themselves.

966
00:43:07,241 --> 00:43:10,862
LuLaRoe really became
a very incestuous

967
00:43:10,896 --> 00:43:14,000
when it came to how
they promoted people

968
00:43:14,034 --> 00:43:16,275
<i>and who was
running the company.</i>

969
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,965
<i>And I mean, the Stidhams</i>

970
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,241
<i>decided that they
were going to employ as,</i>

971
00:43:20,275 --> 00:43:23,034
<i>I guess, as many family
members as they could.</i>

972
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:24,758
<i>And in my opinion,</i>

973
00:43:24,793 --> 00:43:28,068
<i>it was also a way of them
controlling everything.</i>

974
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:31,862
<i>Because their family would
be totally loyal to them</i>

975
00:43:31,896 --> 00:43:35,241
and would do
what was necessary,

976
00:43:35,275 --> 00:43:37,034
in order to keep
the business going,

977
00:43:37,068 --> 00:43:40,344
according to the dictates
of its founders.

978
00:43:40,379 --> 00:43:42,551
So as the business was
very small in the beginning,

979
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:45,103
my wife said, "I'd like
to have our kids involved."

980
00:43:45,137 --> 00:43:46,620
They all had
different skill sets

981
00:43:46,655 --> 00:43:49,241
and they were
the first executive team.

982
00:43:49,275 --> 00:43:52,896
I think the values
of MLMs align

983
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:55,275
perfectly with

984
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,379
the way we think
about money in America

985
00:43:57,413 --> 00:43:59,655
or the way we preach
about money in America.

986
00:43:59,689 --> 00:44:01,448
Big things are happening.

987
00:44:01,482 --> 00:44:02,758
They will continue to happen

988
00:44:02,793 --> 00:44:04,827
by those that
are part of this company.

989
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,172
<i>MLMs probably
wouldn't exist without</i>

990
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:11,931
<i>the prosperity gospel,
and what it</i>

991
00:44:12,689 --> 00:44:14,965
<i>espouses is that Mormonism</i>

992
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,103
in particular, being blessed

993
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:19,620
with money is like literally
being blessed by God,

994
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:21,724
like God favors you

995
00:44:21,758 --> 00:44:23,862
if you are wealthy.

996
00:44:23,896 --> 00:44:26,931
You want to know, if you're
good to your fellow man,

997
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:29,310
then...
then look around and see...

998
00:44:30,862 --> 00:44:32,517
check your bank account.

999
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:34,344
If you have spent
your entire life

1000
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,275
hearing the prosperity gospel

1001
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,172
and hearing that you
can pull yourself

1002
00:44:39,206 --> 00:44:40,413
up by your bootstraps,

1003
00:44:40,448 --> 00:44:42,517
then when someone
comes along and says,

1004
00:44:42,551 --> 00:44:44,068
"Here, actually,
you can do it,

1005
00:44:44,103 --> 00:44:46,482
and you don't have to go
have any student debt."

1006
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,689
You know, and you can
be the boss.

1007
00:44:48,724 --> 00:44:50,965
Then we're all kind
of primed for it

1008
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,275
from birth here
in the United States.

1009
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:54,793
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

1010
00:44:54,827 --> 00:44:56,655
And when you are ready
and you are determined,

1011
00:44:56,689 --> 00:44:58,000
you're gonna do
whatever it takes.

1012
00:44:58,034 --> 00:45:01,517
Remember that I will persist
until I succeed.

1013
00:45:01,551 --> 00:45:03,896
I wasn't even a year in
and I was attending almost

1014
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:06,586
every training that I could
either fly or drive to.

1015
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,965
By getting here, you prove
to yourself

1016
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,068
that this was where you
needed to be

1017
00:45:12,103 --> 00:45:14,655
<i>at the most important time
of your business.</i>

1018
00:45:18,413 --> 00:45:19,896
<i>They convinced me</i>

1019
00:45:19,931 --> 00:45:21,137
<i>to... to buy more,</i>

1020
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:23,310
<i>buy more, sell more.</i>

1021
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:25,379
<i>The bigger your business is,
the more you're gonna sell</i>

1022
00:45:25,413 --> 00:45:26,758
<i>because more people
will come to you</i>

1023
00:45:26,793 --> 00:45:28,793
because you have more stuff
in your pictures,

1024
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:32,344
and, you know, they
encourage that.

1025
00:45:32,379 --> 00:45:34,000
What they, LuLaRoe, would tell
you to do,

1026
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:35,241
and especially the leaders,

1027
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:37,620
is to put the money back in

1028
00:45:37,655 --> 00:45:39,068
to buy more inventory

1029
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,068
and to grow your inventory.

1030
00:45:41,103 --> 00:45:42,620
<i>So that's exactly what I did.</i>

1031
00:45:42,655 --> 00:45:45,034
<i>As much as I could,</i>

1032
00:45:45,068 --> 00:45:48,862
<i>um, use to buy more clothing
and add more styles,</i>

1033
00:45:48,896 --> 00:45:50,172
<i>and sizes and colors,</i>

1034
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:52,310
<i>I would, I would put it
all back in.</i>

1035
00:45:52,344 --> 00:45:55,000
I had somebody
underneath of me who, um...

1036
00:45:56,862 --> 00:45:58,724
sold $12,000 in one month.

1037
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:01,379
And then she said to me,

1038
00:46:01,413 --> 00:46:02,965
"But I spent $12,000."

1039
00:46:03,793 --> 00:46:05,275
And I said to her,

1040
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:07,379
"Well, you had to spend
money to make money."

1041
00:46:07,413 --> 00:46:10,103
<i>"Order more inventory
and you'll do better."</i>

1042
00:46:10,137 --> 00:46:11,655
<i>It was just kind
of always a blanket.</i>

1043
00:46:12,655 --> 00:46:14,137
What can I do to make
my business better?

1044
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:16,655
Like, if you stood in line
to talk to DeAnne

1045
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,758
and she would...
like, her first question,

1046
00:46:19,793 --> 00:46:21,413
probably back to you
probably would have been,

1047
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,379
"Well, how much inventory
have you ordered this month?"

1048
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,413
Remember, you ought to
be placing orders

1049
00:46:27,448 --> 00:46:29,896
every single day, do not wait

1050
00:46:29,931 --> 00:46:32,275
for things to be restocked.

1051
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:34,896
You order what is available
to you every day.

1052
00:46:34,931 --> 00:46:36,827
Every dollar that we made,

1053
00:46:36,862 --> 00:46:40,413
they would tell us to reinvest
it back into more clothes.

1054
00:46:40,448 --> 00:46:42,586
Order consistently
to replenish

1055
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,793
the sales that you're having.

1056
00:46:43,827 --> 00:46:45,931
Always felt more pressure
to buy more merchandise.

1057
00:46:45,965 --> 00:46:47,793
They always told us,

1058
00:46:47,827 --> 00:46:49,758
"The more you have,
the more you sell."

1059
00:46:49,793 --> 00:46:51,965
The more you buy,
the more you sell.

1060
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,517
Like, it's not ethical.

1061
00:46:53,551 --> 00:46:54,758
Look at your inventory,

1062
00:46:54,793 --> 00:46:56,068
analyze what you're selling,

1063
00:46:56,103 --> 00:46:59,517
analyze what season is coming,
what you intend to sell

1064
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:01,448
and order consistently

1065
00:47:01,482 --> 00:47:03,275
to sell consistently

1066
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,517
so that your business

1067
00:47:04,551 --> 00:47:06,172
will consistently grow.

1068
00:47:06,206 --> 00:47:09,517
They're making money off
every single box you order.

1069
00:47:09,551 --> 00:47:11,689
That's why they're telling you
to order more boxes.

1070
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:13,655
And you know what?

1071
00:47:13,689 --> 00:47:16,103
Maybe that was part
of their plan for sending you,

1072
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:20,137
you know, a box full of half
of it is unsellable crap

1073
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:23,034
because they know
they're gonna just tell you,

1074
00:47:23,068 --> 00:47:25,965
"Oh, you couldn't sell
half of it, order more."

1075
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,896
So size medium Julia.

1076
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:29,862
You can layer it, you can
put a Lindsay over it,

1077
00:47:29,896 --> 00:47:31,034
you can put a Shirley over it,

1078
00:47:31,068 --> 00:47:32,448
you can put a Joy over it.

1079
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:35,551
I was just consumed
and obsessed with selling,

1080
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,517
that was for sure. I just got
the endorphins as soon as
I had a sale.

1081
00:47:38,551 --> 00:47:41,827
Heart pink and a gold
and it's kind of like
an Aztec look to it.

1082
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:44,379
So you have these pretty
triangles.

1083
00:47:44,413 --> 00:47:46,965
Here's my sales for the day.
I got to beat it tomorrow,

1084
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,448
and I was just competing,
I guess, with myself and just,

1085
00:47:50,482 --> 00:47:53,793
"Hey, you know, I sold
1,000 today.
Let's do 1,500 tomorrow."

1086
00:47:53,827 --> 00:47:57,586
You have black, would be
super cute wearing it
with black leggings

1087
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,137
and wearing this as a tunic.

1088
00:47:59,172 --> 00:48:01,862
I wanted to hit those top
rankings, you know,

1089
00:48:01,896 --> 00:48:03,344
to show that I was a success.

1090
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:05,275
Super pretty.

1091
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,034
Someone can just rock
this dress.

1092
00:48:07,068 --> 00:48:08,448
They train you to think
this way.

1093
00:48:09,413 --> 00:48:10,413
They're so good at it.

1094
00:48:11,034 --> 00:48:12,793
Every single week.

1095
00:48:12,827 --> 00:48:15,103
You know, with the webinar
and all of the trainings,

1096
00:48:15,137 --> 00:48:18,068
and they're encouraging,
you know, go to the trainings.

1097
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,517
<i>This is where it's at.</i>

1098
00:48:19,551 --> 00:48:22,068
<i>This is where the excitement
is created,</i>

1099
00:48:22,103 --> 00:48:23,517
<i>all of us coming together</i>

1100
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,862
and creating bigger,
better businesses together.

1101
00:48:26,896 --> 00:48:28,551
It just went from like,

1102
00:48:28,586 --> 00:48:29,931
nice and calm

1103
00:48:29,965 --> 00:48:32,413
<i>to very much high-paced job</i>

1104
00:48:32,448 --> 00:48:34,344
<i>that I had to keep up in.</i>

1105
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:36,206
'Cause if you don't keep up,
you fail.

1106
00:48:36,241 --> 00:48:39,103
263, large royal blue.

1107
00:48:39,137 --> 00:48:42,413
1483, small black lace.
Polka dots.

1108
00:48:42,448 --> 00:48:44,275
Like 16-hour days.

1109
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:46,931
I would wake up and I had
all these orders

1110
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,793
that I saw immediately,
as soon as I got up,

1111
00:48:48,827 --> 00:48:51,068
before I went to the bathroom,
I would go pull orders.

1112
00:48:51,103 --> 00:48:54,034
We were like 24/7,
all the time.

1113
00:48:54,068 --> 00:48:55,689
What's the next thing
we can do?

1114
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,000
I never felt like I could
take a break.

1115
00:48:58,034 --> 00:48:59,000
I just had to keep going.

1116
00:49:03,862 --> 00:49:06,793
<i>Day one, working
for LuLaRoe was...</i>

1117
00:49:06,827 --> 00:49:08,965
I would say, hit
the ground running.

1118
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,620
As a professional designer,

1119
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,517
I understand that I'm not
designing for myself,

1120
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:15,068
<i>I'm designing for the company,</i>

1121
00:49:15,103 --> 00:49:16,758
and what they wanted was...

1122
00:49:17,448 --> 00:49:20,689
loud, busy, eye-catching.

1123
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:23,620
Our main direction was just
make it pop.

1124
00:49:29,965 --> 00:49:32,551
When you're working
in production, there's always
this balance

1125
00:49:32,586 --> 00:49:35,482
of quality and quantity,

1126
00:49:35,517 --> 00:49:36,931
and with LuLaRoe,
it was like...

1127
00:49:39,137 --> 00:49:41,068
<i>So we were given the task</i>

1128
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,655
<i>by, Patrick, the head
of design and production,</i>

1129
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,310
<i>to design</i>

1130
00:49:45,344 --> 00:49:46,724
<i>a thousand prints,</i>

1131
00:49:46,758 --> 00:49:48,586
<i>in one day between</i>

1132
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:51,827
<i>me and three other designers.</i>

1133
00:49:51,862 --> 00:49:54,586
It would be open
and existing print,

1134
00:49:55,379 --> 00:49:57,655
<i>change of color, save it.</i>

1135
00:49:57,689 --> 00:50:00,137
<i>Put stripes over it, save it.</i>

1136
00:50:00,172 --> 00:50:02,827
<i>Put the stripes
in the background, save it.</i>

1137
00:50:02,862 --> 00:50:04,000
Open another pattern,

1138
00:50:05,034 --> 00:50:06,620
put it over
the existing pattern

1139
00:50:06,655 --> 00:50:10,000
to make this unholy mash up
of two patterns.

1140
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:11,965
You know, does it look good?

1141
00:50:12,482 --> 00:50:14,827
No. Save it.

1142
00:50:14,862 --> 00:50:17,758
It was a stressful
environment.

1143
00:50:17,793 --> 00:50:20,482
<i>By the end of the day,
Patrick would have
a thousand patterns</i>

1144
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:25,068
to choose from,
and how many actually
made it to production,

1145
00:50:25,586 --> 00:50:26,689
I have no idea.

1146
00:50:28,586 --> 00:50:30,000
The evidence.

1147
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:34,620
Oh, boy.

1148
00:50:34,655 --> 00:50:36,137
They stopped producing

1149
00:50:36,172 --> 00:50:39,034
the inventory
that I joined for.

1150
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:42,275
<i>I don't want print
overlay over print overlay.</i>

1151
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:43,827
<i>The yuck colors,</i>

1152
00:50:43,862 --> 00:50:48,137
<i>the oranges, the weird shades
of mustard, stripes,</i>

1153
00:50:48,172 --> 00:50:50,344
<i>ugly flowers.</i>

1154
00:50:50,379 --> 00:50:52,896
A jaguar, a bear.

1155
00:50:52,931 --> 00:50:55,931
None of them appearing
from the crotch.

1156
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:57,000
So, that's good.

1157
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:00,793
<i>Uh, lot of shapes.</i>

1158
00:51:00,827 --> 00:51:03,482
A pattern layered on top
of a pattern.

1159
00:51:05,689 --> 00:51:07,551
God! There's just so many
of them.

1160
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:08,896
Here she is.

1161
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:11,137
We're like, "Okay."

1162
00:51:12,724 --> 00:51:14,862
There were some
questionable prints.

1163
00:51:14,896 --> 00:51:17,827
<i>You know, they put the...
the designer, Patrick.</i>

1164
00:51:17,862 --> 00:51:20,344
<i>They put DeAnne, Mark
on a pair of leggings,</i>

1165
00:51:20,379 --> 00:51:22,655
<i>like we had actual clothes
with their faces on it.</i>

1166
00:51:23,517 --> 00:51:25,689
Uh, it was just strange.

1167
00:51:28,413 --> 00:51:31,068
This one, I designed
the ghost.

1168
00:51:31,862 --> 00:51:34,206
Owl eyes, peacock feathers,

1169
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:36,379
tribal, ethnic.

1170
00:51:36,413 --> 00:51:37,482
<i>I don't know.</i>

1171
00:51:37,517 --> 00:51:39,137
We get the boxes.
We open it up.

1172
00:51:39,862 --> 00:51:40,862
And it was like,

1173
00:51:42,689 --> 00:51:44,310
"What the hell is this?"

1174
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,862
All of the color vomit

1175
00:51:52,896 --> 00:51:54,827
you could put on fabric

1176
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:57,241
encapsulated in these
brown boxes.

1177
00:51:57,758 --> 00:51:59,724
We were horrified.

1178
00:51:59,758 --> 00:52:02,206
No one in the fucking world

1179
00:52:02,241 --> 00:52:03,896
wants to wear leggings

1180
00:52:03,931 --> 00:52:05,586
that feature a bee

1181
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,793
<i>crawling up your cooch.</i>

1182
00:52:09,275 --> 00:52:12,517
Oh, my God!
That bee is gonna sting
your big pink pearl.

1183
00:52:18,793 --> 00:52:19,896
No.

1184
00:52:25,137 --> 00:52:27,379
<i>Blake is my 22-year-old son.</i>

1185
00:52:28,758 --> 00:52:30,724
<i>And he signed up</i>

1186
00:52:30,758 --> 00:52:33,482
<i>to sell LuLaRoe
under me and...</i>

1187
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:36,896
I wish I could have talked him
out of it.

1188
00:52:36,931 --> 00:52:37,931
His onboarding package

1189
00:52:37,965 --> 00:52:40,793
was horrendous.

1190
00:52:41,655 --> 00:52:43,275
The worst I'd ever seen.

1191
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:45,586
Okay, any other...
anything else we can show?

1192
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,448
We have just so much,

1193
00:52:47,482 --> 00:52:50,620
- so much.
- Here's your number...
number 17.

1194
00:52:50,655 --> 00:52:52,620
And so this is
number 30 right here.

1195
00:52:52,655 --> 00:52:54,620
It's pretty green one.

1196
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,862
I just remember trying
to pattern mix

1197
00:52:56,896 --> 00:52:58,793
and put this with like
a striped shirt

1198
00:52:58,827 --> 00:53:02,620
and just thinking,
"This is the ugliest
thing I've ever seen,

1199
00:53:02,655 --> 00:53:03,931
but I've gotta sell it."

1200
00:53:03,965 --> 00:53:05,000
I think it's,

1201
00:53:05,689 --> 00:53:07,206
I think it's gorgeous.

1202
00:53:07,241 --> 00:53:09,172
And this one, which is going
to be the gray sleeves

1203
00:53:09,206 --> 00:53:11,551
with a really pretty
dark blue background

1204
00:53:11,586 --> 00:53:13,206
with pinks, purples, corals.

1205
00:53:13,241 --> 00:53:16,034
<i>When I saw that box,
I actually called home office</i>

1206
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,620
<i>and said,</i>

1207
00:53:17,655 --> 00:53:20,448
"Do you understand what you
just sent my recruit"?

1208
00:53:20,482 --> 00:53:22,448
I wasn't trying to make
it my son. I'm like,

1209
00:53:22,482 --> 00:53:24,517
"Do you understand
his onboarding package?

1210
00:53:24,551 --> 00:53:27,827
Like, I've been in here
for three years.
I couldn't sell that."

1211
00:53:27,862 --> 00:53:31,275
Gray with... tigers.

1212
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:32,724
Like, with black tigers
on them.

1213
00:53:32,758 --> 00:53:34,827
Number 1404.
This is an extra small.

1214
00:53:34,862 --> 00:53:36,344
I always remember her saying,

1215
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,344
"This isn't good stuff.
We've gotta get it returned."

1216
00:53:38,379 --> 00:53:40,517
I have this one which is
so gorgeous black background,

1217
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,206
there's really
gorgeous flowers

1218
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:43,724
on there, golden flowers.

1219
00:53:43,758 --> 00:53:45,448
And I just remember
thinking,
"I've got to do it.

1220
00:53:45,482 --> 00:53:47,310
I've gotta push it.
I can do this."

1221
00:53:47,344 --> 00:53:49,172
And then, I remember
my first live,

1222
00:53:49,655 --> 00:53:50,758
I sold a pair,

1223
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:52,758
and I've sold my very
first shirt,

1224
00:53:52,793 --> 00:53:54,310
and I remember just
looking to her

1225
00:53:54,344 --> 00:53:56,793
and being like,
"Yes, I did it,
I can do this."

1226
00:53:56,827 --> 00:53:59,379
And then I'm pretty sure
I sold one other piece
that live.

1227
00:53:59,413 --> 00:54:00,689
And then from there,
I would do lives

1228
00:54:00,724 --> 00:54:02,275
and not sell anything.

1229
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:04,034
And then from there, about
six or eight months later,

1230
00:54:04,068 --> 00:54:06,241
I just kind of tapered off
and they went into a box

1231
00:54:06,275 --> 00:54:07,275
and I never sold them again.

1232
00:54:08,448 --> 00:54:10,965
You can't go overnight,

1233
00:54:11,896 --> 00:54:13,241
you know, making

1234
00:54:13,275 --> 00:54:16,758
clothing for a few
thousand people,

1235
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:18,931
to making boxes

1236
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:21,103
full of clothing
for 80,000 people.

1237
00:54:22,034 --> 00:54:23,758
You have to cut
corners somewhere.

1238
00:54:32,862 --> 00:54:34,586
<i>It was madness over here.</i>

1239
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,620
<i>They ship, receive
everything here.</i>

1240
00:54:37,655 --> 00:54:39,724
<i>That's where they would park
right there, all the Mercedes,</i>

1241
00:54:39,758 --> 00:54:40,965
<i>all their flashy cars.</i>

1242
00:54:41,896 --> 00:54:43,413
I was working at LuLaRoe

1243
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:46,000
from March of 2016

1244
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:48,862
to January of 2017.

1245
00:54:48,896 --> 00:54:51,517
For what amount
we were gonna
do on a day, I was like

1246
00:54:51,551 --> 00:54:54,241
15 million, 12 million
in a day.

1247
00:54:54,275 --> 00:54:56,172
Okay, walking,
walking, walking.

1248
00:54:56,206 --> 00:54:57,793
<i>This is what it looks like.</i>

1249
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,586
<i>Leggings, leggings
and leggings.</i>

1250
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,965
<i>More leggings.</i>

1251
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,448
<i>It's like, get busy.</i>

1252
00:55:02,482 --> 00:55:04,310
<i>Everybody, start selling.</i>

1253
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:06,482
We can go see where they
have their moldy
clothes at.

1254
00:55:10,827 --> 00:55:12,793
<i>The warehouse was full.</i>

1255
00:55:12,827 --> 00:55:14,586
<i>It was packed to the brim.</i>

1256
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:18,517
<i>And somebody decided to put...
start putting clothes outside.</i>

1257
00:55:18,551 --> 00:55:20,724
<i>One night, like it started
to drizzle,</i>

1258
00:55:20,758 --> 00:55:22,793
<i>and the next day, sunny.</i>

1259
00:55:22,827 --> 00:55:24,620
And then as time went on,

1260
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:28,000
nobody really noticed
like the molding yet.

1261
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:31,793
And yeah, starting to get into
the... to get shipped out.

1262
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:36,103
Thousands.

1263
00:55:38,206 --> 00:55:39,517
Yeah, it's a lot of clothes.

1264
00:55:42,724 --> 00:55:47,413
I'm sorry.
Y'all just taking on the tour
of the LuLaRoe, uh...

1265
00:55:52,137 --> 00:55:53,689
All right,
we're taking off, man.

1266
00:55:57,344 --> 00:55:58,620
Why is he so angry?

1267
00:56:03,724 --> 00:56:05,758
<i>When people describe</i>

1268
00:56:05,793 --> 00:56:08,862
<i>MLMs to you, they'll draw you
a pyramid,</i>

1269
00:56:08,896 --> 00:56:11,206
and at the bottom
of the pyramid,

1270
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:13,068
like the visible base,

1271
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:15,586
um, you see just more
retailers, right?

1272
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,379
Like that's a line
of retailers.

1273
00:56:17,413 --> 00:56:20,000
<i>But I think there's
an invisible face</i>

1274
00:56:20,034 --> 00:56:22,758
<i>that gets left out of all
of those graphics,</i>

1275
00:56:22,793 --> 00:56:24,827
<i>and that's made up
of all the people</i>

1276
00:56:24,862 --> 00:56:26,482
<i>who are making the products</i>

1277
00:56:26,517 --> 00:56:28,137
<i>that all the retailers
are selling.</i>

1278
00:56:43,034 --> 00:56:44,655
<i>The people
at the very bottom
of the LuLaRoe</i>

1279
00:56:44,689 --> 00:56:47,586
pyramid are not white
Christian stay-at-home moms.

1280
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,827
Um, they're the people
making the leggings.

1281
00:57:21,172 --> 00:57:22,965
And let me show you
what I got,

1282
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,344
because it's a piece of crap.

1283
00:57:24,379 --> 00:57:26,068
<i>She's fighting mad.</i>

1284
00:57:26,103 --> 00:57:28,862
<i>She is just one of thousands
of women complaining</i>

1285
00:57:28,896 --> 00:57:30,965
<i>about the super soft leggings
they purchased,</i>

1286
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,379
<i>only to discover
they have holes.</i>

1287
00:57:33,413 --> 00:57:34,862
They're ripping, um, they're

1288
00:57:34,896 --> 00:57:36,103
wearing them for a few hours,

1289
00:57:36,137 --> 00:57:37,965
they're wearing them
for a few minutes
and finding holes

1290
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,827
and large, substantial tears.

1291
00:57:39,862 --> 00:57:42,172
<i>Christina Hinks
used to sell the leggings.</i>

1292
00:57:42,206 --> 00:57:45,551
<i>She showed me a pair
that an angry customer
returned to her.</i>

1293
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:50,482
<i>I remember like my third,</i>

1294
00:57:50,517 --> 00:57:52,000
third or fourth order,

1295
00:57:52,034 --> 00:57:54,482
getting the ever-coveted black.

1296
00:57:54,517 --> 00:57:56,413
Solid black leggings.

1297
00:57:56,448 --> 00:57:58,517
And I was like, "Well, shit,

1298
00:57:58,551 --> 00:58:00,137
<i>I'm gonna keep
one of these for me,"
you know.</i>

1299
00:58:00,172 --> 00:58:01,689
<i>The day that I wore them,</i>

1300
00:58:01,724 --> 00:58:02,931
<i>I fell asleep on my couch.</i>

1301
00:58:04,034 --> 00:58:06,586
I was woken up a few hours
later by the baby crying,

1302
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,931
and I got up
and my husband's cackling.

1303
00:58:09,482 --> 00:58:10,482
Cackling.

1304
00:58:11,068 --> 00:58:12,275
"What's funny?"

1305
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,068
He's like,
"Christina, your ass
looks like Swiss cheese."

1306
00:58:15,103 --> 00:58:16,620
Went into the bathroom,
took my pants off,

1307
00:58:16,655 --> 00:58:18,620
and you could put
your whole hand

1308
00:58:18,655 --> 00:58:21,724
<i>through the holes
in my left butt cheek.</i>

1309
00:58:21,758 --> 00:58:23,448
And I said, "Okay,
it must be a fluke."

1310
00:58:23,482 --> 00:58:24,724
So, I pulled the second
pair out

1311
00:58:25,517 --> 00:58:27,551
and I put them on.
Same thing.

1312
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,413
I was pissed.

1313
00:58:29,448 --> 00:58:30,551
That's when I started digging.

1314
00:58:30,586 --> 00:58:32,586
That's when I started
reaching out to people.

1315
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,551
<i>MommyGyver was a blog</i>

1316
00:58:35,586 --> 00:58:39,103
<i>that I created to sort
of empower women</i>

1317
00:58:39,137 --> 00:58:40,310
<i>to do their own things,</i>

1318
00:58:42,379 --> 00:58:43,724
<i>like MacGyver,</i>

1319
00:58:43,758 --> 00:58:45,793
<i>who could turn anything
into anything.</i>

1320
00:58:53,172 --> 00:58:54,275
So I had started

1321
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:56,344
writing MommyGyver
around, um,

1322
00:58:56,379 --> 00:58:57,586
May and June

1323
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:59,965
of the... of 2016-ish.

1324
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,034
<i>And I really started
writing about LuLaRoe.</i>

1325
00:59:04,068 --> 00:59:06,655
<i>I think the first post
I made was in December.</i>

1326
00:59:06,689 --> 00:59:07,862
<i>When I first started writing,</i>

1327
00:59:07,896 --> 00:59:09,379
<i>nobody wanted to cover it.</i>

1328
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:11,103
It wasn't a big enough
dumpster fire

1329
00:59:11,137 --> 00:59:12,586
for them to see the fire

1330
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,206
from way high up.

1331
00:59:14,241 --> 00:59:16,000
And I felt obligated.

1332
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:18,689
I felt like I had
to say something

1333
00:59:18,724 --> 00:59:20,000
because if I didn't,
who would?

1334
00:59:22,103 --> 00:59:24,862
<i>All of these, these women
were sending me messages.</i>

1335
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:26,310
<i>This particular consultant</i>

1336
00:59:26,344 --> 00:59:28,034
<i>was baited to onboard
with the understanding</i>

1337
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:30,965
that it would only take
her 20 hours a week
to make full-time pay.

1338
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,448
She states that, um,

1339
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:34,344
<i>she learned very quickly
it's not a part-time job,</i>

1340
00:59:34,379 --> 00:59:36,517
<i>and even exceeded
full-time hours,</i>

1341
00:59:36,551 --> 00:59:38,275
<i>as was my experience.</i>

1342
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:39,793
<i>As I started digging through</i>

1343
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:41,965
<i>and as I started going
higher up and higher up</i>

1344
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,034
<i>and into their close circles,</i>

1345
00:59:44,068 --> 00:59:46,689
<i>I was finding
leaders telling people</i>

1346
00:59:46,724 --> 00:59:49,310
<i>how to get other women
to buy in.</i>

1347
00:59:49,344 --> 00:59:54,000
<i>Know most people don't have
$5,000, $10,000
at their disposal,</i>

1348
00:59:54,034 --> 00:59:55,344
<i>but that's okay.</i>

1349
00:59:55,379 --> 00:59:58,586
They can take that
credit card with $5,000
or $10,000 maximum

1350
00:59:58,620 --> 00:59:59,862
and they can max it out.

1351
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:02,689
My sponsor initially had
suggested to me maybe

1352
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:07,172
that I try, um, crowd funding.

1353
01:00:07,206 --> 01:00:11,965
In the end, to come up
with a last little bit, um,

1354
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,103
we ended up
not paying some bills.

1355
01:00:14,137 --> 01:00:16,034
At one point, there was
a document given to me

1356
01:00:16,068 --> 01:00:19,517
<i>where it was created
by a top consultant,</i>

1357
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:22,103
<i>and it was how to come up
with the money.</i>

1358
01:00:22,137 --> 01:00:24,379
Um, ask you friends
and family for a loan.

1359
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:26,689
Borrow from your
children's college fund.

1360
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:28,448
You can get a loan.
You can get...

1361
01:00:28,482 --> 01:00:32,620
Um, use credit cards,
you can use, um,
money from family.

1362
01:00:32,655 --> 01:00:35,172
You can sell stuff
that you already own.

1363
01:00:35,206 --> 01:00:38,724
Um, so there's lots of ways
that you can raise that money.

1364
01:00:38,758 --> 01:00:42,379
I started hearing that women
were... were, following me

1365
01:00:42,413 --> 01:00:45,862
<i>and they were waiting
for the next article
to come out.</i>

1366
01:00:45,896 --> 01:00:48,862
<i>As I started getting
more popular in my blog,</i>

1367
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:49,965
<i>I was getting death threats.</i>

1368
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,310
<i>People were showing
up on my doorstep.</i>

1369
01:00:51,344 --> 01:00:52,758
<i>I was getting hate mail.</i>

1370
01:00:52,793 --> 01:00:54,793
<i>I was not expecting</i>

1371
01:00:54,827 --> 01:00:58,344
MommyGyver to become
as famous/infamous as it was.

1372
01:01:01,137 --> 01:01:03,551
<i>So are you guys
blocking the trolls?</i>

1373
01:01:03,586 --> 01:01:04,862
That would be awesome.

1374
01:01:05,413 --> 01:01:06,689
Um, so make sure

1375
01:01:06,724 --> 01:01:09,103
that you do because
it would make me so happy.

1376
01:01:13,965 --> 01:01:17,241
<i>There were retailers
on every corner, you know.</i>

1377
01:01:17,275 --> 01:01:20,034
I mean,
it was really highly doubtful
that we would all succeed.

1378
01:01:22,241 --> 01:01:24,827
My next door neighbor
was a retailer

1379
01:01:24,862 --> 01:01:25,896
in our apartment.

1380
01:01:25,931 --> 01:01:28,068
<i>I was here.
She was here.</i>

1381
01:01:28,103 --> 01:01:31,172
And it was crazy, we all both
had our LuLaRoe rooms.

1382
01:01:32,206 --> 01:01:33,793
<i>Everywhere you turn,</i>

1383
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:36,275
<i>there was somebody,
I mean, you go to the mall,</i>

1384
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:38,448
<i>you run into somebody
selling LuLaRoe,</i>

1385
01:01:38,482 --> 01:01:39,896
wearing it
or something like that.

1386
01:01:43,586 --> 01:01:46,068
<i>I made about 60 grand</i>

1387
01:01:46,103 --> 01:01:48,241
<i>in that first,
within that first year.</i>

1388
01:01:48,275 --> 01:01:49,724
And I just took that money

1389
01:01:49,758 --> 01:01:51,206
and just threw
it back in there.

1390
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:53,103
This dress
right here cost me.

1391
01:01:53,137 --> 01:01:55,724
I paid $30 for this, $30.

1392
01:01:55,758 --> 01:01:57,862
I'm lucky to get
probably $10 for it now.

1393
01:01:58,724 --> 01:02:00,379
And at certain point,

1394
01:02:00,413 --> 01:02:03,793
I was spending more than
I was bringing in.

1395
01:02:03,827 --> 01:02:06,689
I have boxes
in that corner right there,

1396
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:09,965
and I have these pink bags
full of LuLaRoe.

1397
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,758
This is all left.
This is all what I have left.

1398
01:02:14,137 --> 01:02:16,379
<i>I really had enough inventory.</i>

1399
01:02:16,413 --> 01:02:17,620
<i>I really did,</i>

1400
01:02:17,655 --> 01:02:19,965
<i>but I bought more things.</i>

1401
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,896
That's what gets
you more in trouble.

1402
01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:23,931
I was telling
somebody recently.

1403
01:02:23,965 --> 01:02:25,827
If you wanna... what I paid,

1404
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,758
we're talking
at least 20 grand.

1405
01:02:28,793 --> 01:02:30,862
Wow!
-$20,000 right here.

1406
01:02:30,896 --> 01:02:33,482
Wow.
- 20,000, 25,000 right here.

1407
01:02:36,172 --> 01:02:38,413
<i>Sales just started
to drop like almost</i>

1408
01:02:38,448 --> 01:02:39,620
<i>half each month.</i>

1409
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:42,965
So, let's say June,
I did 16,000.

1410
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,448
<i>The next month
would have been,</i>

1411
01:02:44,482 --> 01:02:45,896
<i>you know, 12,000,</i>

1412
01:02:45,931 --> 01:02:49,413
<i>then 10,000,
then 8,000, then 4,000.</i>

1413
01:02:49,448 --> 01:02:50,965
<i>And by January 2018</i>

1414
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,793
<i>I only sold
a thousand dollars.</i>

1415
01:02:53,827 --> 01:02:56,068
And I just felt I needed
to have new inventory.

1416
01:02:56,103 --> 01:02:58,103
What I had was not selling.

1417
01:02:58,137 --> 01:03:01,034
I can only create so many
outfits with what I had.

1418
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:04,068
So I actually took out loans

1419
01:03:04,103 --> 01:03:05,758
to buy more inventory.

1420
01:03:06,724 --> 01:03:07,965
<i>My house was</i>

1421
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,034
<i>more LuLaRoe
than it was honestly house.</i>

1422
01:03:11,068 --> 01:03:13,137
<i>Inventory all over
the front room</i>

1423
01:03:13,172 --> 01:03:15,344
<i>and the sitting room
and the dining room.</i>

1424
01:03:16,068 --> 01:03:17,758
Everywhere.

1425
01:03:17,793 --> 01:03:20,000
<i>There's stuff
that goes on in our brains</i>

1426
01:03:20,034 --> 01:03:22,310
<i>that is totally natural.</i>

1427
01:03:22,344 --> 01:03:25,068
<i>They are defense mechanisms.
They keep us alive.</i>

1428
01:03:25,103 --> 01:03:26,965
We all have this, um,

1429
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
cognitive bias
called loss aversion,

1430
01:03:30,034 --> 01:03:32,379
which basically means

1431
01:03:32,413 --> 01:03:34,379
that we feel losses

1432
01:03:34,413 --> 01:03:36,379
a lot more deeply
and more strongly

1433
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:37,862
than we feel gains.

1434
01:03:37,896 --> 01:03:39,379
There's a lot of tricks
we play on ourselves

1435
01:03:39,413 --> 01:03:41,827
to like, not feel
like a loser.

1436
01:03:41,862 --> 01:03:44,896
<i>There's another thing
called honoring sunk costs,</i>

1437
01:03:44,931 --> 01:03:47,586
<i>and that is throwing
good money after bad.</i>

1438
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,482
<i>So, the more money
you put into your MLM,</i>

1439
01:03:49,517 --> 01:03:51,620
<i>the more you're losing,
the more you're thinking,</i>

1440
01:03:51,655 --> 01:03:53,034
<i>"It's an investment."</i>

1441
01:03:53,068 --> 01:03:55,344
"I know I'm already
$10,000 in debt

1442
01:03:55,379 --> 01:03:56,517
and my husband doesn't know,

1443
01:03:56,551 --> 01:03:58,241
and our garage
is full of leggings,

1444
01:03:58,275 --> 01:04:01,551
and I can't quit now.

1445
01:04:01,586 --> 01:04:04,103
You know, I can't just
walk away
with that kind of debt.

1446
01:04:04,137 --> 01:04:05,310
I have to keep trying."

1447
01:04:05,344 --> 01:04:08,034
With LuLaRoe,
there's no safety net.

1448
01:04:08,068 --> 01:04:10,137
There's nothing
to save you when your,

1449
01:04:10,172 --> 01:04:11,758
when your business goes wrong,

1450
01:04:11,793 --> 01:04:13,620
because you aren't a business.

1451
01:04:13,655 --> 01:04:14,793
You're...

1452
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,896
you're a retailer

1453
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:19,758
for another company.

1454
01:04:19,793 --> 01:04:21,862
And if they fail,
they'll get protected.

1455
01:04:21,896 --> 01:04:23,000
But you are ass out.

1456
01:04:23,896 --> 01:04:25,793
Oh, my gosh,
there's so many large.

1457
01:04:25,827 --> 01:04:29,620
1446, white with the black.

1458
01:04:29,655 --> 01:04:32,137
<i>I was in a jam.
I couldn't pay
any of my bills.</i>

1459
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:33,448
<i>We were behind
on the house payment,</i>

1460
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:35,413
<i>plus we had 11 kids.</i>

1461
01:04:35,448 --> 01:04:38,482
<i>So, it... it was just had
become desperation.</i>

1462
01:04:38,517 --> 01:04:40,724
<i>I pretty much hit rock bottom
and said I can't.</i>

1463
01:04:41,758 --> 01:04:42,931
I went live with my closet

1464
01:04:43,517 --> 01:04:44,896
because I had so much,

1465
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:46,758
so much,

1466
01:04:46,793 --> 01:04:48,793
and I still hadn't told
my customers yet.

1467
01:04:49,655 --> 01:04:51,827
And I just held up this dress

1468
01:04:51,862 --> 01:04:54,206
and I was like, "All right,
this is a sweater Carly,

1469
01:04:54,241 --> 01:04:56,551
it's super rare,
it's a unicorn."

1470
01:04:56,586 --> 01:04:58,448
Um, and then
I just start crying.

1471
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:02,310
<i>Once the tears started,
I couldn't get them to stop.</i>

1472
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:07,448
And I just told them,
you know, "This is it."

1473
01:05:07,482 --> 01:05:09,206
<i>I already knew
I was gonna have to file</i>

1474
01:05:09,241 --> 01:05:11,206
<i>for bankruptcy.
There is no way.</i>

1475
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:14,034
I knew I owed
so much in taxes.

1476
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:17,206
This is where I go
to make my monthly

1477
01:05:17,827 --> 01:05:18,827
bankruptcy payment,

1478
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:21,137
715 basically.

1479
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:24,034
I'm in a five-year bankruptcy,

1480
01:05:24,068 --> 01:05:26,482
so overall I'll be paying

1481
01:05:26,517 --> 01:05:28,206
a little over $40,000

1482
01:05:28,241 --> 01:05:29,862
with all the fees
and everything.

1483
01:05:29,896 --> 01:05:31,344
The lawyer fees and all.

1484
01:05:33,517 --> 01:05:35,620
<i>I'll be honest
with you,
I thought about suicide</i>

1485
01:05:35,655 --> 01:05:36,827
<i>when all this was happening,</i>

1486
01:05:36,862 --> 01:05:39,448
<i>and just...
just to get out of that</i>

1487
01:05:39,482 --> 01:05:41,310
after hitting rock bottom, so.

1488
01:05:45,137 --> 01:05:46,103
I, um,

1489
01:05:47,172 --> 01:05:49,103
have crazy anxiety now

1490
01:05:49,137 --> 01:05:50,448
that I didn't have before.

1491
01:05:50,482 --> 01:05:52,000
I felt like a failure.

1492
01:05:52,034 --> 01:05:54,000
I put myself in debt,

1493
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:56,827
and I had no way
to pay it off.

1494
01:05:56,862 --> 01:05:59,103
Still tens of thousands
in debt

1495
01:05:59,137 --> 01:06:01,689
to this day that I still
haven't managed to pay off.

1496
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,896
<i>So you know the story
of Red Riding Hood,</i>

1497
01:06:13,931 --> 01:06:15,310
<i>how she went
through the forest</i>

1498
01:06:15,344 --> 01:06:16,379
<i>to visit her grandmother</i>

1499
01:06:16,413 --> 01:06:19,586
and the wolf had eaten
her grandmother.

1500
01:06:21,034 --> 01:06:23,000
<i>And the whole time
she's like, "Wow.</i>

1501
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:26,137
<i>Grandma, you're acting
kind of weird.</i>

1502
01:06:26,172 --> 01:06:27,655
<i>Grandma, your nose
is a little different.</i>

1503
01:06:28,724 --> 01:06:30,172
<i>Holy crap, grandma,
you're eating me.</i>

1504
01:06:30,206 --> 01:06:31,724
You're not really grandma,
you're a wolf."

1505
01:06:32,517 --> 01:06:33,862
That's what LuLaRoe was.

1506
01:06:33,896 --> 01:06:35,551
It was innocuous,

1507
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,827
<i>genuine, real,</i>

1508
01:06:37,862 --> 01:06:41,137
<i>love, emotion, comfort.</i>

1509
01:06:41,172 --> 01:06:43,551
"Just kidding.
We're gonna eat you alive."

1510
01:06:44,586 --> 01:06:46,827
What happens to people
in MLMs,

1511
01:06:46,862 --> 01:06:49,379
and I've done interventions
to get people out

1512
01:06:49,413 --> 01:06:51,034
of multi-level marketing
schemes

1513
01:06:51,586 --> 01:06:53,310
is they get hurt,

1514
01:06:53,344 --> 01:06:55,068
and they could be bankrupted,

1515
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:57,655
their marriage could end,
they become estranged

1516
01:06:57,689 --> 01:06:59,827
from family and old friends.

1517
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:02,103
People can be devastated.

1518
01:07:02,137 --> 01:07:05,034
<i>I mean, how do you get people
to buy into something</i>

1519
01:07:05,068 --> 01:07:07,413
<i>that is not in their own
best interest?</i>

1520
01:07:07,448 --> 01:07:10,068
And the answer
is you manipulate them

1521
01:07:10,103 --> 01:07:12,965
in a kind of cult-like manner.

1522
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,241
When I decided
it was no longer for me,

1523
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,413
everyone that was above me

1524
01:07:18,448 --> 01:07:19,620
stopped talking to me.

1525
01:07:19,655 --> 01:07:22,586
I didn't want my upline
to be mad that I was leaving

1526
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:24,896
because I know it would
affect their bonus checks.

1527
01:07:24,931 --> 01:07:27,275
It was hard for me to let go.

1528
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:30,206
Um, it was hard for me
to admit failure.

1529
01:07:32,068 --> 01:07:34,862
I've talked to ex-MLM sources

1530
01:07:34,896 --> 01:07:37,241
who described
the process of leaving

1531
01:07:37,275 --> 01:07:39,965
as psychological warfare,

1532
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,103
who found that the moment
that they expressed

1533
01:07:43,137 --> 01:07:44,413
that they didn't wanna
be involved

1534
01:07:44,448 --> 01:07:45,862
with this group anymore,

1535
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:47,896
they were dropped like trash.

1536
01:07:47,931 --> 01:07:49,482
That's the thing
that lets you know

1537
01:07:49,517 --> 01:07:51,586
this is a destructive,
cultish group,

1538
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:53,620
when leaving comes

1539
01:07:53,655 --> 01:07:56,620
with these major consequences.

1540
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:00,827
<i>I was never
making any money.</i>

1541
01:08:00,862 --> 01:08:04,482
<i>I stuck it out as long
as I could, and fall of 18,</i>

1542
01:08:04,517 --> 01:08:06,379
<i>that was it.</i>

1543
01:08:06,413 --> 01:08:09,000
<i>I just kind of dropped off
the LuLaRoe world.</i>

1544
01:08:10,413 --> 01:08:11,793
<i>Said, "I don't want
to do this anymore."</i>

1545
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:14,448
<i>And it's lonely</i>

1546
01:08:14,482 --> 01:08:15,896
<i>when that happens to you,</i>

1547
01:08:15,931 --> 01:08:17,655
<i>because you don't have
anything else in your life</i>

1548
01:08:17,689 --> 01:08:19,103
<i>except for LuLaRoe,
and now you have</i>

1549
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:21,310
<i>to rebuild it all over again.</i>

1550
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:24,103
LuLaRoe convinced us
that we were in something,

1551
01:08:24,137 --> 01:08:27,689
you know, super popular
and we were super important,

1552
01:08:27,724 --> 01:08:28,965
and you just kind of

1553
01:08:29,517 --> 01:08:31,965
fell into acting like it

1554
01:08:32,724 --> 01:08:33,724
and believing it.

1555
01:08:35,896 --> 01:08:40,000
<i>And that's why I look back
on it feeling so cultish.</i>

1556
01:08:40,034 --> 01:08:42,310
You are not selling clothes.

1557
01:08:42,344 --> 01:08:45,793
<i>You are giving people freedom,
you are giving people life,</i>

1558
01:08:45,827 --> 01:08:46,931
you are giving people hope,

1559
01:08:46,965 --> 01:08:48,965
you are giving
people confidence.

1560
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,620
<i>Is LuLaRoe a cult?</i>

1561
01:08:50,655 --> 01:08:52,379
<i>I would have to say,</i>

1562
01:08:54,413 --> 01:08:57,310
I just can't think
of anything else

1563
01:08:57,344 --> 01:09:01,275
that makes people
quite that dedicated.

1564
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,827
Think about
all the great things.

1565
01:09:02,862 --> 01:09:04,517
Think about
the positive things,

1566
01:09:04,551 --> 01:09:05,931
not the negative things.

1567
01:09:05,965 --> 01:09:07,931
I would be up until
four o'clock in the morning,

1568
01:09:07,965 --> 01:09:09,034
almost every night.

1569
01:09:09,068 --> 01:09:11,586
My kids saw way less of me
after I started.

1570
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,413
I don't think I ever slept.

1571
01:09:13,448 --> 01:09:15,103
<i>There's no
work-life balance.</i>

1572
01:09:15,137 --> 01:09:17,379
<i>You know, you're putting
all of your finances into it.</i>

1573
01:09:17,413 --> 01:09:19,724
<i>You've alienated
your friends and family.</i>

1574
01:09:19,758 --> 01:09:21,586
I just can't think
of anything else

1575
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:24,379
to call it.

1576
01:09:24,413 --> 01:09:27,620
<i>When I left,
I was a mess.
I was a hot mess.</i>

1577
01:09:27,655 --> 01:09:29,862
<i>I was in hook,
line and sinker.</i>

1578
01:09:29,896 --> 01:09:32,241
<i>I believed all of it,
and I don't think</i>

1579
01:09:32,275 --> 01:09:33,896
<i>that they went into it</i>

1580
01:09:33,931 --> 01:09:36,103
<i>to create it to be a cult.</i>

1581
01:09:36,137 --> 01:09:38,206
But from my experience,
it was.

1582
01:09:39,793 --> 01:09:41,413
Especially when I went to leave.

1583
01:09:42,724 --> 01:09:44,172
<i>That was a struggle.</i>

1584
01:09:44,206 --> 01:09:45,827
<i>You quickly learned
who your friends were</i>

1585
01:09:45,862 --> 01:09:46,931
<i>and who they weren't.</i>

1586
01:09:48,793 --> 01:09:50,206
<i>They had no need
for me anymore.</i>

1587
01:09:51,931 --> 01:09:53,379
Looking back on it now, I'm...

1588
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,758
I'm shocked that I

1589
01:09:56,793 --> 01:09:58,758
drank that much Kool-Aid.

1590
01:09:58,793 --> 01:10:01,275
You're basically, like, marked
as a suppressive person

1591
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,517
and you're hurting
their business by leaving

1592
01:10:03,551 --> 01:10:05,275
and by telling your truth.

1593
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:07,379
So I just shut up and I left

1594
01:10:07,413 --> 01:10:09,620
and I refused to talk
about it until now.

1595
01:10:09,655 --> 01:10:12,034
I literally didn't know
what to do with myself,

1596
01:10:12,068 --> 01:10:13,896
because it was my identity.

1597
01:10:13,931 --> 01:10:16,241
The mentality in there
is always positive,

1598
01:10:16,275 --> 01:10:17,827
nothing negative,

1599
01:10:17,862 --> 01:10:21,551
and you're
in a LuLaRoe family.

1600
01:10:21,586 --> 01:10:22,620
So you have your LuLa mom,

1601
01:10:22,655 --> 01:10:25,068
your LuLa grandma,
your LuLa babies.

1602
01:10:25,103 --> 01:10:27,344
Everything is Lula
In LuLaRoe.

1603
01:10:30,448 --> 01:10:31,896
<i>MLMs are scammy,</i>

1604
01:10:31,931 --> 01:10:34,551
but they are not
just your average scam.

1605
01:10:35,758 --> 01:10:38,172
<i>They have so much in common</i>

1606
01:10:38,206 --> 01:10:39,793
<i>psychologically with the groups</i>

1607
01:10:39,827 --> 01:10:42,344
<i>that we would traditionally
think of as cults.</i>

1608
01:10:42,379 --> 01:10:45,551
<i>You know, they encourage you
to recruit others.</i>

1609
01:10:45,586 --> 01:10:48,448
They shut down
questioning and dissent.

1610
01:10:48,482 --> 01:10:50,103
<i>They gaslight you
into thinking</i>

1611
01:10:50,137 --> 01:10:52,931
<i>that if you don't succeed
in this organization,</i>

1612
01:10:52,965 --> 01:10:54,344
<i>it is your fault.</i>

1613
01:10:54,379 --> 01:10:56,172
<i>If you don't make
your quota for the month,</i>

1614
01:10:56,206 --> 01:10:59,103
well, girl, it's because you
didn't think positive enough.

1615
01:10:59,137 --> 01:11:01,482
You didn't envision
the Cadillac.

1616
01:11:01,517 --> 01:11:02,517
Therefore,

1617
01:11:03,517 --> 01:11:04,689
there is something
wrong with you.

1618
01:11:05,793 --> 01:11:07,724
You need to stick
it out another month

1619
01:11:07,758 --> 01:11:09,241
to really prove yourself

1620
01:11:09,275 --> 01:11:11,413
as the boss babe
we thought you were.

1621
01:11:11,448 --> 01:11:13,931
I just felt like a failure
and I didn't wanna

1622
01:11:14,793 --> 01:11:17,000
go to my mom
and after she gave me

1623
01:11:17,034 --> 01:11:19,655
<i>that money from her
retirement fund,</i>

1624
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:21,241
like I didn't want
to go to her

1625
01:11:21,275 --> 01:11:22,586
and be like, "Mom,
I failed."

1626
01:11:23,517 --> 01:11:27,068
So, I just, I was in denial
a long time,

1627
01:11:27,103 --> 01:11:29,241
and I just

1628
01:11:29,275 --> 01:11:31,862
really just had
to face the truth.

1629
01:11:31,896 --> 01:11:34,000
<i>It's really hard to see
yourself as a victim.</i>

1630
01:11:34,931 --> 01:11:36,620
<i>To say you were victimized</i>

1631
01:11:36,655 --> 01:11:38,586
is to admit a weakness,

1632
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:41,103
and a weakness feels painful.

1633
01:11:41,137 --> 01:11:43,896
Plus, if you admit
that you were victimized,

1634
01:11:43,931 --> 01:11:45,758
then you also have
to, in an MLM,

1635
01:11:45,793 --> 01:11:47,344
admit that you
victimized others,

1636
01:11:47,931 --> 01:11:49,517
which is even harder.

1637
01:11:49,551 --> 01:11:51,310
<i>I just felt
extremely guilty</i>

1638
01:11:51,344 --> 01:11:52,344
<i>for the people that I,</i>

1639
01:11:53,655 --> 01:11:54,655
<i>you know, had join.</i>

1640
01:11:56,517 --> 01:12:00,758
So, I just, I always think
about that, I always
wonder like, how do they

1641
01:12:00,793 --> 01:12:03,034
think of me,
like I had such highs

1642
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:04,413
and then I had such lows.

1643
01:12:04,448 --> 01:12:08,137
And I think about that now,
like, what do they
think of me now

1644
01:12:08,172 --> 01:12:10,517
or did they think I was being
deceitful at the time.

1645
01:12:11,862 --> 01:12:14,206
<i>So, while
a LuLaRoe recruit</i>

1646
01:12:14,241 --> 01:12:16,034
<i>might be a suburban mom</i>

1647
01:12:16,068 --> 01:12:18,310
<i>with highlights
wearing bulldog leggings</i>

1648
01:12:18,344 --> 01:12:21,206
rather than
a new religious member

1649
01:12:21,241 --> 01:12:24,379
in a white robe
with a shaved head
on a commune,

1650
01:12:24,413 --> 01:12:27,655
the methods of manipulation
that they're under
are quite similar.

1651
01:12:31,172 --> 01:12:33,689
We were supposed to dress
a certain way all the time.

1652
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:40,206
<i>If it was too big,
we would tie a knot in it,</i>

1653
01:12:41,172 --> 01:12:42,586
<i>mix our patterns,</i>

1654
01:12:43,896 --> 01:12:46,068
<i>then we all wore it,</i>

1655
01:12:46,103 --> 01:12:47,586
<i>and we all wore
the same thing,</i>

1656
01:12:49,275 --> 01:12:50,310
acted the same way.

1657
01:12:51,689 --> 01:12:54,310
<i>So like
being on stage
and looking out</i>

1658
01:12:54,344 --> 01:12:55,517
<i>into the audience.</i>

1659
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:58,034
Um, everybody was twins.

1660
01:12:58,068 --> 01:13:00,517
I'm not going to lie, like
everybody had that Joy on.

1661
01:13:00,551 --> 01:13:02,275
How am I remembering
all these names?

1662
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:05,379
It's like the cardigan,
the long.

1663
01:13:05,413 --> 01:13:07,448
<i>And then everyone
was rocking leggings.</i>

1664
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:12,034
Oh, my gosh. Wow!
What a morning.

1665
01:13:12,068 --> 01:13:13,413
<i>I can't imagine
what that must</i>

1666
01:13:13,448 --> 01:13:16,000
<i>have been like for DeAnne,</i>

1667
01:13:16,034 --> 01:13:19,275
<i>to look out and see everybody
that you've convinced</i>

1668
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:20,620
<i>to be a certain way.</i>

1669
01:13:20,655 --> 01:13:22,655
<i>What that would feel like?</i>

1670
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:24,551
I've always just
kind of always wondered

1671
01:13:24,586 --> 01:13:26,034
what did she really think.

1672
01:13:27,172 --> 01:13:29,827
<i>They need
that culture of conformity</i>

1673
01:13:29,862 --> 01:13:32,482
<i>where you're only hearing
the MLM rhetoric,</i>

1674
01:13:32,517 --> 01:13:34,137
<i>where you're only hearing</i>

1675
01:13:34,172 --> 01:13:36,586
<i>that toxic positivity
from your upline,</i>

1676
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,758
where you're only
hearing the mantras

1677
01:13:38,793 --> 01:13:41,448
and the faux inspiration
from the people at the top,

1678
01:13:41,482 --> 01:13:43,000
it creates the sense that

1679
01:13:43,034 --> 01:13:45,413
you're a part of something
bigger than yourself.

1680
01:13:45,448 --> 01:13:48,758
And I want to tell you
there is a sense of belonging.

1681
01:13:48,793 --> 01:13:52,758
I think there is a specific
group of people
that they're targeting

1682
01:13:52,793 --> 01:13:55,448
and it's middle-aged
white women in Middle America.

1683
01:13:56,448 --> 01:13:58,413
<i>But they probably
do have sprinklings of,</i>

1684
01:13:58,448 --> 01:14:00,310
<i>you know, a Latina,
a black woman,</i>

1685
01:14:00,344 --> 01:14:01,655
<i>uh, you know, an Asian</i>

1686
01:14:01,689 --> 01:14:04,344
<i>just to, you know, bring some
diversity, some seasoning.</i>

1687
01:14:04,379 --> 01:14:06,862
But, um, they use
a lot of black vernacular

1688
01:14:06,896 --> 01:14:10,448
in order to, um,
to look relatable.

1689
01:14:11,034 --> 01:14:12,517
Hey, girls. Hey!

1690
01:14:12,551 --> 01:14:15,517
Hey, girl, hey. Hello, hello,
everyone, welcome.

1691
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:17,379
- Hey!
- Which is fine.

1692
01:14:17,413 --> 01:14:19,448
That's fine if you wanna use
black vernacular.

1693
01:14:19,482 --> 01:14:21,310
<i>I'm not the vernacular police,</i>

1694
01:14:21,344 --> 01:14:24,000
but it's not reflected
in their downline.

1695
01:14:24,034 --> 01:14:25,551
It's not reflected
on their stages

1696
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,206
when they hold
these major events.

1697
01:14:27,241 --> 01:14:29,137
<i>I have a problem
with it because</i>

1698
01:14:29,172 --> 01:14:31,620
<i>they're using
the Black vernacular
to profit,</i>

1699
01:14:31,655 --> 01:14:34,103
but we're not profiting
off of it because

1700
01:14:35,034 --> 01:14:36,862
we're only there
for seasoning

1701
01:14:36,896 --> 01:14:38,689
so that they can tell,

1702
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,482
the world,
"Yes, we're diverse."

1703
01:14:43,379 --> 01:14:44,379
Okay.

1704
01:14:45,517 --> 01:14:47,793
- Is that it?
Yes.

1705
01:14:47,827 --> 01:14:51,172
That really struck me
when I would sell my product,

1706
01:14:51,206 --> 01:14:52,965
um, Black people
would never...

1707
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,206
I would... that would shut,
they would shut the door
in my face, yeah.

1708
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,344
I promise you, I promise you.

1709
01:14:58,379 --> 01:15:02,275
And I have neighbors, people,
church, family, friends.

1710
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:06,896
<i>My daughter said the clothing
wasn't their style.</i>

1711
01:15:06,931 --> 01:15:08,896
I guess they didn't like
the clothing.

1712
01:15:08,931 --> 01:15:10,000
<i>I would say</i>

1713
01:15:10,034 --> 01:15:13,620
<i>95% of these women were white.</i>

1714
01:15:13,655 --> 01:15:18,068
I have only seen a few people
of color ever

1715
01:15:18,103 --> 01:15:20,517
who were a part of LuLaRoe,

1716
01:15:20,551 --> 01:15:25,068
<i>and all the main figures
who are very popular</i>

1717
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:28,724
<i>and high up in LuLaRoe were
always very homogeneous.</i>

1718
01:15:30,413 --> 01:15:33,241
<i>Mark and DeAnne were
projecting a certain image,</i>

1719
01:15:33,275 --> 01:15:35,793
<i>an image of a white couple.</i>

1720
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:37,896
When you have a group

1721
01:15:37,931 --> 01:15:40,586
than has that kind
of leadership

1722
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:44,103
<i>that represents a...
a kind of prototype,</i>

1723
01:15:44,137 --> 01:15:47,758
they encourage you to want
to be just like the leaders.

1724
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:50,000
What's up, y'all?
We're here.

1725
01:15:50,034 --> 01:15:52,793
This is 2016,
New York convention.

1726
01:15:52,827 --> 01:15:56,034
It's getting live,
it's getting lit.
There's a bunch of ladies

1727
01:15:56,068 --> 01:15:59,689
in leggings and dresses
and leggings and dresses.

1728
01:15:59,724 --> 01:16:02,310
Did I mention
that they're in leggings?

1729
01:16:05,379 --> 01:16:07,689
Being Black at LuLaRoe

1730
01:16:09,413 --> 01:16:10,620
was great.

1731
01:16:10,655 --> 01:16:12,793
I was the unicorn Of LuLaRoe,

1732
01:16:12,827 --> 01:16:14,310
you best believe.

1733
01:16:14,344 --> 01:16:16,931
<i>I rode that train,</i>

1734
01:16:16,965 --> 01:16:19,620
I mean, I tooted my horn
and everything because

1735
01:16:19,655 --> 01:16:21,931
I mean, yeah, they...

1736
01:16:21,965 --> 01:16:24,482
It wasn't diverse at all.

1737
01:16:24,517 --> 01:16:26,551
I mean, in a serious,

1738
01:16:26,586 --> 01:16:28,068
on a serious side, like...

1739
01:16:30,275 --> 01:16:31,862
I don't know if I could
say like...

1740
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:39,310
I may have could have gotten
taken advantage of...

1741
01:16:40,379 --> 01:16:41,896
...a few times,

1742
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:46,275
like I definitely
endured some...

1743
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,793
some racism I'm not,
I'm not going to lie.

1744
01:16:48,827 --> 01:16:52,172
But again, for me...

1745
01:16:54,344 --> 01:16:55,620
I'll put up with it.

1746
01:16:55,655 --> 01:16:58,310
I'm where I wanted to be...

1747
01:16:58,344 --> 01:17:00,413
I'm living my dream, you know,

1748
01:17:00,448 --> 01:17:04,586
and I've dealt with it
in my life.

1749
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,413
You know, this is,
it's nothing new.

1750
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:09,482
<i>It's going to be everywhere
you go.</i>

1751
01:17:09,517 --> 01:17:12,034
Like, there's always
somebody that hates you.

1752
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:25,655
<i>I was so grateful
for the opportunity just
to be there.</i>

1753
01:17:25,689 --> 01:17:27,551
They incorporated me
in their family.

1754
01:17:27,586 --> 01:17:30,724
They let me come
to the cookouts.

1755
01:17:30,758 --> 01:17:32,034
<i>I was in.</i>

1756
01:17:33,758 --> 01:17:34,793
And I'm just like,

1757
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,068
"I'm this nobody from Concord,
like, I mean..."

1758
01:17:41,103 --> 01:17:47,931
I was thinking, "Yeah, I want
to do this for the rest
of my life."

1759

01:18:04,758 --> 01:18:07,034
<i>There was always a lot of hype,</i>

1765
01:18:07,068 --> 01:18:08,793
<i>fun activities,</i>

1766
01:18:08,827 --> 01:18:10,137
ran by Sam Schultz.

1767
01:18:12,241 --> 01:18:15,965
<i>Sam Schultz is DeAnne's
direct nephew.</i>

1768
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,344
<i>Sam was right at the top
of LuLaRoe</i>

1769
01:18:19,551 --> 01:18:22,034
and was really the LuLaRoe
hype man.

1770
01:18:22,068 --> 01:18:25,103
It was actually Sam Schultz
who came and approached me

1771
01:18:25,137 --> 01:18:26,965
<i>at that beach.</i>

1772
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,655
He was the reason
why I was there.

1773
01:18:30,344 --> 01:18:32,655
Elijah! Elijah! Elijah!

1774
01:18:36,137 --> 01:18:40,655
I related to Sam,
like he was kind of my idol.

1775
01:18:40,689 --> 01:18:43,103
<i>He was my big brother.</i>

1776
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,000
Ha-ha!

1777
01:18:45,034 --> 01:18:48,931
- Yo, what up, y'all?
- Look, it's a Monday.

1778
01:18:48,965 --> 01:18:51,172
- Back to work.
- Hey!

1779
01:18:51,206 --> 01:18:52,793
<i>I would do
anything for Sam.</i>

1780
01:18:53,482 --> 01:18:56,000
I felt in debt to him.

1781
01:18:56,034 --> 01:18:59,172
<i>The first time
I met Sam Shultz was
at a LuLaRoe training,</i>

1782
01:18:59,206 --> 01:19:01,724
and they will ask you
what your "why" is.

1783
01:19:01,758 --> 01:19:04,068
Can you guys see me okay?

1784
01:19:04,103 --> 01:19:07,034
Let's see, I felt like
this is like
an interrogation light.

1785
01:19:07,068 --> 01:19:10,517
<i>He's very,
very good
at getting close to you</i>

1786
01:19:10,551 --> 01:19:11,793
<i>and listening to your story.</i>

1787
01:19:12,724 --> 01:19:13,862
What's up, everyone?

1788
01:19:13,896 --> 01:19:15,413
It feels nice to have somebody

1789
01:19:16,103 --> 01:19:18,034
kind of ask you those.

1790
01:19:18,068 --> 01:19:19,551
Why do you...
Why do you do
what you do?

1791
01:19:20,275 --> 01:19:21,275
<i>I told my why.</i>

1792
01:19:22,827 --> 01:19:26,586
My husband had passed
in December of 2012.

1793
01:19:31,896 --> 01:19:34,620
<i>There were
times shortly
after Scott passed</i>

1794
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:38,965
<i>that I really probably
didn't deserve to have my son.</i>

1795
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,068
Which might not be
the best thing
for any mom to ever say.

1796
01:19:44,068 --> 01:19:47,620
<i>Just self-medicated,
slept a lot.</i>

1797
01:19:49,724 --> 01:19:50,724
<i>It was bad.</i>

1798
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:56,034
<i>And I told him that story,</i>

1799
01:19:56,068 --> 01:19:59,862
<i>and I think right
then and there, right then,</i>

1800
01:20:01,413 --> 01:20:02,517
I was the target.

1801
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,413
Because he knew the guilt
that I carried from the years

1802
01:20:09,448 --> 01:20:11,206
immediately after
my husband passed.

1803
01:20:11,241 --> 01:20:14,620
He chose close people
and groomed them for a while,

1804
01:20:15,586 --> 01:20:16,793
<i>so he would get away with it.</i>

1805
01:20:17,655 --> 01:20:19,172
<i>So we wouldn't turn on him.</i>

1806
01:20:20,551 --> 01:20:22,551
<i>I called him my best friend</i>

1807
01:20:22,586 --> 01:20:24,517
<i>'cause I did think
he was my best friend.</i>

1808
01:20:24,551 --> 01:20:25,620
And so did my son.

1809
01:20:26,896 --> 01:20:29,137
<i>He loved him.</i>

1810
01:20:29,172 --> 01:20:32,586
When you are brought up
in a household
that literally worships

1811
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,896
the church of MLM,

1812
01:20:34,931 --> 01:20:38,896
<i>all you know is how
to worship the church of MLM.</i>

1813
01:20:45,724 --> 01:20:48,206
<i>Sam kind of
encouraged us to,</i>

1814
01:20:48,241 --> 01:20:49,793
<i>"All right, come on,
let's do our own thing.</i>

1815
01:20:49,827 --> 01:20:52,275
<i>It's... we're going to start
our own thing."</i>

1816
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:54,689
I trusted him, you know.

1817
01:20:55,931 --> 01:20:58,000
And I quit, I quit LuLaRoe.

1818
01:20:58,586 --> 01:20:59,793
I did.

1819
01:21:03,965 --> 01:21:05,137
I was naive.

1820
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,068
I learned that Sam

1821
01:21:11,103 --> 01:21:15,482
was in and out
of various schemes,

1822
01:21:15,517 --> 01:21:18,689
plots, get rich quick ideas,
whatever you want
to call them.

1823
01:21:18,724 --> 01:21:21,206
The Utah County musician,
who makes a living

1824
01:21:21,241 --> 01:21:24,827
organizing concerts
and once owned the popular
Sammy's Cafe,

1825
01:21:24,862 --> 01:21:27,034
is now facing
26 felonies tonight.

1826
01:21:27,068 --> 01:21:29,482
<i>In all charging
documents say Schultz
recruited</i>

1827
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:31,344
<i>at least 13 investors,</i>

1828
01:21:31,379 --> 01:21:35,103
<i>who collectively gave Schultz
$323,000.</i>

1829
01:21:36,655 --> 01:21:39,655
<i>There was a medicinal
marijuana farm.</i>

1830
01:21:39,689 --> 01:21:41,275
<i>You know, he wanted
more money from me</i>

1831
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:43,586
<i>for these fake investment
opportunities.</i>

1832
01:21:43,931 --> 01:21:44,931
In total,

1833
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:51,344
Sam managed to get from me
almost $100,000,

1834
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,655
<i>and the majority of that
money was money left
by my late husband,</i>

1835
01:21:58,689 --> 01:22:00,137
<i>allocated to Peirson.</i>

1836
01:22:06,413 --> 01:22:08,482
<i>People will say
to me with
the current business,</i>

1837
01:22:09,517 --> 01:22:11,827
<i>"Oh, my gosh,
you worked so hard.</i>

1838
01:22:11,862 --> 01:22:14,482
<i>You worked, I can't believe
you do all this by yourself."</i>

1839
01:22:15,413 --> 01:22:16,931
<i>They don't know
the real reason</i>

1840
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:20,068
why I do all of it by myself
is because in my head,

1841
01:22:21,448 --> 01:22:24,000
every time the Airstream
door opens,

1842
01:22:24,034 --> 01:22:27,137
I'm constantly trying
to make up for what I lost.

1843
01:22:47,275 --> 01:22:49,517
Me, like so many others

1844
01:22:50,965 --> 01:22:54,379
of his victims, were plucked
right out of that company.

1845
01:22:54,413 --> 01:22:55,758
But you know what?
The company won't

1846
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,655
take any responsibility
for it.

1847
01:23:04,517 --> 01:23:06,896
2017 was the big year

1848
01:23:06,931 --> 01:23:09,103
where they got
a ton of lawsuits
filed against them

1849
01:23:09,137 --> 01:23:11,724
and the backlash against them
really started.

1850
01:23:18,965 --> 01:23:20,931
<i>I think there was really
power in numbers,</i>

1851
01:23:20,965 --> 01:23:24,000
<i>and once people all started
getting together and talking
about this stuff,</i>

1852
01:23:24,034 --> 01:23:26,379
<i>you know, I think
more lawsuits were filed.</i>

1853
01:23:26,413 --> 01:23:29,206
<i>I think people started
reaching out to the media.</i>

1854
01:23:29,241 --> 01:23:30,965
And I think ultimately,

1855
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,068
it started giving
the case attention.

1856
01:23:35,103 --> 01:23:36,896
Three Sacramento women
are suing

1857
01:23:36,931 --> 01:23:41,241
a popular clothing company
called LuLaRoe for $1 billion.

1858
01:23:41,275 --> 01:23:42,655
<i>The attorney claims
the company</i>

1859
01:23:42,689 --> 01:23:44,379
<i>has cheated
thousands of women.</i>

1860
01:23:59,206 --> 01:24:02,103
<i>I'm a fourth generation
steamfitter of Local UA342.</i>

1861
01:24:04,482 --> 01:24:06,965
I'm known
in the LuLaRoe Defective

1862
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,896
Defectors' Support Group
as Heather Blithely.

1863
01:24:09,931 --> 01:24:12,137
<i>My legal name, however,
is Heather Blevins.</i>

1864
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:16,310
I try to keep my online
social media presence

1865
01:24:16,344 --> 01:24:19,620
and my real life self
kind of separate.

1866
01:24:21,551 --> 01:24:23,137
<i>I don't know
why I wanted to help so bad.</i>

1867
01:24:23,172 --> 01:24:24,655
<i>I really don't.</i>

1868
01:24:24,689 --> 01:24:26,793
<i>It just wasn't fair,
and no one was listening.</i>

1869
01:24:26,827 --> 01:24:28,310
And everyone was telling us
we were wrong

1870
01:24:28,344 --> 01:24:30,517
for trying to help
and we were wrong for caring

1871
01:24:30,551 --> 01:24:35,689
and we just knew...
that it was real.

1872
01:24:42,068 --> 01:24:44,689
<i>I think that
the Facebook group
is one of the reasons</i>

1873
01:24:44,724 --> 01:24:48,137
why I have always known
this is a story
that's worth reporting

1874
01:24:48,172 --> 01:24:50,482
because people were

1875
01:24:50,517 --> 01:24:53,275
so incredibly passionate
about it.

1876
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:55,137
<i>I wasn't really sure</i>

1877
01:24:56,586 --> 01:24:59,689
how to go about
telling you guys.

1878
01:24:59,724 --> 01:25:01,931
<i>And just
really want
to see</i>

1879
01:25:01,965 --> 01:25:04,793
<i>justice in some form
or another.</i>

1880
01:25:04,827 --> 01:25:07,034
<i>When I first joined
LuLaRoe Defective,</i>

1881
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:08,241
<i>it was pretty small</i>

1882
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:10,206
<i>and I volunteered.</i>

1883
01:25:10,241 --> 01:25:14,103
As consultants started
mass leaving LuLaRoe,

1884
01:25:14,137 --> 01:25:17,931
<i>there wasn't any place
for us to say,</i>

1885
01:25:17,965 --> 01:25:20,000
"Here's what really happened
behind the scenes."

1886
01:25:21,103 --> 01:25:22,758
<i>So, it's like a domino effect,
right?</i>

1887
01:25:22,793 --> 01:25:26,344
You get one person
who just is not happy

1888
01:25:26,379 --> 01:25:29,689
and they decide to say
something and then
it's like, boom.

1889
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:31,827
The... the door gets
kicked down.

1890
01:25:31,862 --> 01:25:33,517
It's like, me too, me too.

1891
01:25:33,551 --> 01:25:34,862
<i>This happened to me too.</i>

1892
01:25:36,275 --> 01:25:39,172
The membership grew
pretty steadily,

1893
01:25:39,206 --> 01:25:42,241
<i>um, from a few hundred
to a couple of thousand,</i>

1894
01:25:42,275 --> 01:25:44,000
<i>and at the height
of the group,</i>

1895
01:25:44,034 --> 01:25:46,000
<i>there were 75,000 members.</i>

1896
01:25:48,137 --> 01:25:51,275
<i>Heather is
one of my good friends now,</i>

1897
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:53,896
and she's a damn good
detective as well.

1898
01:25:53,931 --> 01:25:56,896
I can say that.

1899
01:25:56,931 --> 01:25:59,586
<i>It was brought
to our attention by some
of the members</i>

1900
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:04,275
<i>how a lot of their
onboarding packages
had ads that advertised</i>

1901
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:05,931
<i>full-time pay
for part-time work.</i>

1902
01:26:05,965 --> 01:26:09,655
$60,000 to $75,000 a year,

1903
01:26:09,689 --> 01:26:12,000
working 20 hours a week.

1904
01:26:14,482 --> 01:26:16,655
<i>There was
a trend of burning your
onboarding package.</i>

1905
01:26:16,689 --> 01:26:18,862
<i>When people would cancel,
they were just so excited
to get out</i>

1906
01:26:18,896 --> 01:26:20,482
<i>that they would burn
their onboarding package,</i>

1907
01:26:20,517 --> 01:26:23,068
<i>and I realized that
evidence is being lost.</i>

1908
01:26:23,103 --> 01:26:25,931
<i>And so I went and got
a post office box</i>

1909
01:26:25,965 --> 01:26:28,517
<i>and asked the group for
their onboarding packages.</i>

1910
01:26:31,931 --> 01:26:33,275
<i>We encouraged everyone,</i>

1911
01:26:33,310 --> 01:26:35,827
<i>"File a complaint with
your state's
attorney general,"</i>

1912
01:26:35,862 --> 01:26:37,551
<i>and all we could
do is hope that</i>

1913
01:26:37,586 --> 01:26:39,517
<i>someone was going to pay
attention and someone
was going to take interest.</i>

1914
01:26:40,517 --> 01:26:44,000
Finally, I got a message

1915
01:26:44,034 --> 01:26:47,586
from the investigators
of the Washington State
Attorney General's Office,

1916
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:50,413
<i>and she was asking if I had
any information about</i>

1917
01:26:50,448 --> 01:26:53,172
which consultants
in Washington were impacted.

1918
01:26:53,206 --> 01:26:55,517
<i>One thing I sent to them
was the brochure</i>

1919
01:26:55,551 --> 01:26:56,862
<i>that came
in the onboarding package</i>

1920
01:26:56,896 --> 01:26:59,275
<i>that said you could make
full-time work
for part-time pay.</i>

1921
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:02,862
Oh, and the video of Jordan
and Lindsay Wheeler,
who's a top consultant.

1922
01:27:02,896 --> 01:27:06,068
We need to get away
from being
a pyramid scheme, okay?

1923
01:27:06,103 --> 01:27:08,862
What it is is if you
sign up Sally,

1924
01:27:09,862 --> 01:27:13,206
you have, you have no reason
to help Sally

1925
01:27:13,241 --> 01:27:15,586
sell the product in her room.

1926
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:19,344
Right? You can just keep
promoting her to buy, to buy,
to buy, to buy.

1927
01:27:19,379 --> 01:27:22,620
- You could even...
<i>And they were
explaining</i>

1928
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:23,724
a pretty big policy change.

1929
01:27:23,758 --> 01:27:25,034
I'm not panicked
at all, right?

1930
01:27:25,068 --> 01:27:26,655
If you're doing
the right things,

1931
01:27:26,689 --> 01:27:27,896
there's no issue.

1932
01:27:27,931 --> 01:27:29,689
When the LuLaRoe
first started,

1933
01:27:29,724 --> 01:27:31,551
if you had people under you,

1934
01:27:31,586 --> 01:27:35,206
you weren't making
a percentage of the clothing
they sold.

1935
01:27:35,241 --> 01:27:38,310
You're making a percentage
of the clothing they bought.

1936
01:27:38,344 --> 01:27:40,413
<i>So for example,
I'm in LuLaRoe.</i>

1937
01:27:40,448 --> 01:27:42,586
<i>I have a girl under me,
let's say.</i>

1938
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:45,965
<i>If she buys ten shirts
and she can only sell two,</i>

1939
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,241
<i>it doesn't really
matter to me.</i>

1940
01:27:47,275 --> 01:27:50,206
<i>I'm making commission
off all ten shirts.</i>

1941
01:27:50,241 --> 01:27:52,620
<i>And then eventually
LuLaRoe changed</i>

1942
01:27:52,655 --> 01:27:55,931
<i>their structure for bonuses,</i>

1943
01:27:55,965 --> 01:28:03,068
<i>where instead I was gonna
make only money
of the shirts she sold.</i>

1944
01:28:03,103 --> 01:28:07,379
<i>So instead of making money
for ten shirts, I was looking
at making money for two.</i>

1945
01:28:07,413 --> 01:28:10,310
All of the sudden,
people's, um,

1946
01:28:10,344 --> 01:28:12,413
income was dropping
precipitously.

1947
01:28:12,448 --> 01:28:13,931
I mean, we've been talking
about it forever.

1948
01:28:13,965 --> 01:28:15,379
If you've come
to a leadership.

1949
01:28:15,413 --> 01:28:17,206
<i>Yeah, this
is not new.</i>

1950
01:28:17,241 --> 01:28:18,310
Yeah, this is not new.

1951
01:28:18,344 --> 01:28:20,379
This is something that
we've been talking about.

1952
01:28:20,413 --> 01:28:23,137
Lindsay, what do you say
to people when

1953
01:28:23,172 --> 01:28:25,586
they say we are a pyramid
scheme?

1954
01:28:26,172 --> 01:28:27,551
Quick answer.

1955
01:28:27,586 --> 01:28:28,724
We're not a pyramid scheme.

1956
01:28:28,758 --> 01:28:30,137
My husband thought we were
at first.

1957
01:28:30,172 --> 01:28:32,413
He told me I was gonna
share a cell with
Bernie Madoff

1958
01:28:32,448 --> 01:28:34,275
'cause he was convinced
that there was no way

1959
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:36,896
that I could make this
kind of money doing
something legally.

1960
01:28:36,931 --> 01:28:39,137
That's my favorite piece
of evidence that
I've ever seen.

1961
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:42,137
And again, that was sent
to me by a consultant.

1962
01:28:42,172 --> 01:28:45,206
<i>You've
probably seen their brightly
colored tops and leggings</i>

1963
01:28:45,241 --> 01:28:47,103
<i>on your social media feed.</i>

1964
01:28:47,137 --> 01:28:50,655
<i>But tonight, the company
LuLaRoe facing
another lawsuit.</i>

1965
01:28:50,689 --> 01:28:53,724
<i>The Washington State
Attorney General says LuLaRoe</i>

1966
01:28:53,758 --> 01:28:56,379
<i>made claims of high profits
and tricked people</i>

1967
01:28:56,413 --> 01:28:58,068
<i>into joining a pyramid scheme.</i>

1968
01:28:58,103 --> 01:29:01,103
<i>So, what makes LuLaRoe
a pyramid scheme,</i>

1969
01:29:01,137 --> 01:29:02,827
according to the Attorney
General's office?

1970
01:29:02,862 --> 01:29:07,103
Well, the monthly bonuses,
which were reportedly
seven to 12 times higher

1971
01:29:07,137 --> 01:29:08,965
<i>than the actual
merchandise sales.</i>

1972
01:29:12,586 --> 01:29:15,793
<i>Do you ever
encourage retailers to share
how much they made,</i>

1973
01:29:15,827 --> 01:29:17,827
<i>um, in a particular
bonus check?</i>

1974
01:29:17,862 --> 01:29:19,379
No. 121.

1975
01:29:19,413 --> 01:29:21,206
So, exhibit 121.

1976
01:29:21,241 --> 01:29:22,896
<i>So I'm gonna
start playing at...</i>

1977
01:29:22,931 --> 01:29:26,034
<i>at the beginning
and play for a little bit.</i>

1978
01:29:26,068 --> 01:29:28,793
<i>I am from Maryland.</i>

1979
01:29:28,827 --> 01:29:32,206
<i>My... my last check
was $250,000,</i>

1980
01:29:32,241 --> 01:29:36,034
<i>and I do about
12,000 to 13,000 in sales
every month.</i>

1981
01:29:37,586 --> 01:29:40,034
<i>I'm in Salt Lake City...
Riverton, Utah,</i>

1982
01:29:40,068 --> 01:29:43,655
<i>and our last check
was 307,000.</i>

1983
01:29:46,206 --> 01:29:49,344
<i>I... I can't even say it.
It, like, blows my mind.</i>

1984
01:29:49,379 --> 01:29:51,689
<i>So, uh, correct me
if I'm wrong,</i>

1985
01:29:51,724 --> 01:29:54,000
<i>but everyone in that video
is making more</i>

1986
01:29:54,034 --> 01:29:56,000
<i>in bonus checks than
they are in sales, correct?</i>

1987
01:29:56,862 --> 01:29:58,517
At that time, yes.

1988
01:29:58,551 --> 01:30:00,793
<i>Why were
they making more
on bonus checks than sales?</i>

1989
01:30:00,827 --> 01:30:02,034
I don't know. Maybe they...

1990
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:04,896
maybe they helped
a lot of people

1991
01:30:06,551 --> 01:30:08,344
to help them make money.

1992
01:30:42,517 --> 01:30:45,551
<i>When we heard
about the outcome
of the Washington State case,</i>

1993
01:30:45,586 --> 01:30:47,517
<i>we were all definitely elated.</i>

1994
01:31:02,103 --> 01:31:03,241
<i>We were super excited</i>

1995
01:31:03,275 --> 01:31:04,517
<i>that the consultants
got money back.</i>

1996
01:31:04,551 --> 01:31:06,586
It really, I think,
gave us hope

1997
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:09,206
that, um, what we were doing
was counting for something.

1998
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:10,620
We weren't just screaming
into the void.

1999
01:31:10,655 --> 01:31:12,551
People were listening.
It was actually

2000
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:16,724
creating change, um,
and some positive outcomes,

2001
01:31:16,758 --> 01:31:18,379
and we really hope
that it'll continue

2002
01:31:18,413 --> 01:31:19,379
through the rest
of the states.

2003
01:31:52,137 --> 01:31:54,241
The FTC needs to strengthen
its regulations

2004
01:31:54,275 --> 01:31:56,517
against, uh, multi-level
marketing companies.

2005
01:31:56,551 --> 01:31:58,241
Pyramid schemes
are already illegal,

2006
01:31:58,275 --> 01:32:03,413
um, the FTC, um, website
has all that information.

2007
01:32:03,448 --> 01:32:05,517
Uh, I think the FTC
really needs to step up

2008
01:32:05,551 --> 01:32:07,965
and expand that to all MLMs.

2009
01:32:10,379 --> 01:32:14,172
<i>In the beginning
of doing a research
around MLMs,</i>

2010
01:32:14,206 --> 01:32:16,931
I didn't understand
that 99% of people

2011
01:32:16,965 --> 01:32:19,000
made nothing or lost money.

2012
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:21,344
And that's a lot, that's like
kind of a low figure.

2013
01:32:21,379 --> 01:32:23,827
They think maybe it's 99.9.

2014
01:32:23,862 --> 01:32:26,482
One, two, three.
Whoo!

2015
01:32:27,896 --> 01:32:31,172
<i>In a successful
multi-level marketing scheme,</i>

2016
01:32:31,206 --> 01:32:36,413
you need a lot of failure
because you're making money
off of the recruits

2017
01:32:36,448 --> 01:32:41,344
and you're making money
off of their, um, desperation,

2018
01:32:41,379 --> 01:32:46,862
which often manifests
as more investment
in the company.

2019
01:32:46,896 --> 01:32:51,896
<i>LuLaRoe isn't
built for you to have
your own freedom</i>

2020
01:32:51,931 --> 01:32:53,448
<i>and to have
your own empowerment.</i>

2021
01:32:53,482 --> 01:32:56,931
It is meant to build
the people at the top.

2022
01:32:56,965 --> 01:32:59,655
It's meant to make the people
at the top richer.

2023
01:32:59,689 --> 01:33:01,689
Capitalism is the root
of all evil.

2024
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,172
<i>It does surprise me</i>

2025
01:33:10,206 --> 01:33:12,068
<i>that LuLaRoe is still
in existence</i>

2026
01:33:12,103 --> 01:33:16,310
because I didn't really think

2027
01:33:16,344 --> 01:33:18,137
that they would be able
to fight off

2028
01:33:18,172 --> 01:33:19,724
all of the litigation
against them

2029
01:33:19,758 --> 01:33:21,862
without having to file
for bankruptcy.

2030
01:33:21,896 --> 01:33:24,068
I think
that LuLaRoe still exists

2031
01:33:24,103 --> 01:33:26,241
because Mark
and DeAnne Stidham

2032
01:33:26,275 --> 01:33:29,931
want to continue making money
from this business,

2033
01:33:29,965 --> 01:33:34,068
and what their business
is all about is selling dreams

2034
01:33:34,862 --> 01:33:37,655
as opposed
to selling a product.

2035
01:33:37,689 --> 01:33:41,172
And... and there are people
that still want to believe

2036
01:33:41,206 --> 01:33:45,655
in the American dream
and the dream of LuLaRoe.

2037
01:33:54,793 --> 01:33:56,344
<i>We just got here
to Cancun.</i>

2038
01:33:57,448 --> 01:34:00,965
<i>This is so worth
the hard work.</i>

2039
01:34:02,793 --> 01:34:05,275
I can't wait to get together
with you

2040
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:07,655
when you get here to Cancun.

2041
01:34:07,689 --> 01:34:10,620
And those of you
that are not here, get busy,

2042
01:34:10,655 --> 01:34:12,620
and know that we love giving.

2043
01:34:15,931 --> 01:34:17,586
<i>I can't
believe it, I can't believe</i>

2044
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:19,827
<i>like this is still going on.</i>

2045
01:34:19,862 --> 01:34:21,862
It's like none of this
had ever happened,

2046
01:34:21,896 --> 01:34:23,620
and the cognitive
dissonance there

2047
01:34:23,655 --> 01:34:26,551
is just like, it's crazy.

2048
01:34:26,586 --> 01:34:28,965
<i>This is the one
where I had my son with me.</i>

2049
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,241
It's like... I took Brooks.
it was so awesome.

2050
01:34:31,275 --> 01:34:33,793
- What, he's like a baby?
- Yeah, I was nursing.

2051
01:34:33,827 --> 01:34:35,482
And I was able to bring him.

2052
01:34:35,517 --> 01:34:38,103
- Yeah.
- Do you know what I wonder?
I would love to know,

2053
01:34:38,137 --> 01:34:39,655
and there's no way
to actually prove this,

2054
01:34:39,689 --> 01:34:41,965
but I would love to know,
like how many babies were born

2055
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,241
- because of LuLaRoe.
- How many times have you seen

2056
01:34:44,275 --> 01:34:46,448
fund-raisers for like
IVF treatments?

2057
01:34:46,482 --> 01:34:48,896
And all of us
are like, oh...

2058
01:34:51,344 --> 01:34:54,034
<i>I ended up
in Cancun this weekend</i>

2059
01:34:54,068 --> 01:34:57,241
because LuLaRoe
is doing a incentive trip,

2060
01:34:57,275 --> 01:34:59,034
is what we call it
a Dream Trip

2061
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:02,034
and, um, leaders, high sellers
are here,

2062
01:35:02,068 --> 01:35:03,448
<i>they would come together
once a year,</i>

2063
01:35:03,482 --> 01:35:05,724
just coming together
to be with my people.

2064
01:35:05,758 --> 01:35:08,655
But Brianna, you started
six years ago.

2065
01:35:08,689 --> 01:35:09,931
- Yeah, almost.
- Yeah.

2066
01:35:09,965 --> 01:35:11,482
So, I worked full-time
at the hospital.

2067
01:35:11,517 --> 01:35:14,862
I was in nursing school,
and I was doing LuLaRoe,
like all at once.

2068
01:35:14,896 --> 01:35:17,482
And so online just
worked really well for me.

2069
01:35:17,517 --> 01:35:19,137
And then when I graduated
nursing school,

2070
01:35:19,172 --> 01:35:21,931
I was like full-time LuLaRoe,
full-time at the hospital.

2071
01:35:21,965 --> 01:35:24,724
And then eventually
LuLaRoe took over

2072
01:35:24,758 --> 01:35:27,448
and I quit at the hospital
and haven't looked back.

2073
01:35:27,482 --> 01:35:28,896
Did you buy
before you sold?

2074
01:35:28,931 --> 01:35:32,275
I did. I bought,
I bought a lot before I sold.

2075
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:35,034
Like a lot, a lot, a lot.
I loved it.

2076
01:35:35,068 --> 01:35:36,206
I mean, it was just...

2077
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:39,137
It made me feel good,

2078
01:35:39,172 --> 01:35:40,758
and then the community
that I've built

2079
01:35:40,793 --> 01:35:44,103
since then has been amazing.

2080
01:35:45,172 --> 01:35:48,103
Everybody's looking
for this bad story,

2081
01:35:48,137 --> 01:35:50,620
but it's not the bad story
that's really there.

2082
01:35:50,655 --> 01:35:53,344
It's the empowerment
that we are bringing.

2083
01:35:53,379 --> 01:35:56,310
It's the joy
that we're creating
in people's lives

2084
01:35:56,344 --> 01:35:59,965
and this opportunity
that people have had to grow.

2085
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,206
<i>And the people that are here</i>

2086
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:04,275
<i>are because of choices
that they've made
in their business.</i>

2087
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:05,931
And some people have left.

2088
01:36:05,965 --> 01:36:08,758
And they can find reasons
as to why.

2089
01:36:08,793 --> 01:36:11,000
And there could be reasons
that they want to use

2090
01:36:11,034 --> 01:36:12,517
that maybe are
against LuLaRoe.

2091
01:36:12,551 --> 01:36:15,862
It could be reasons on media
and things that they followed.

2092
01:36:15,896 --> 01:36:19,758
But no matter what,
it all boils down
to a personal choice

2093
01:36:19,793 --> 01:36:21,517
and how you choose
to run your business.

2094
01:36:21,551 --> 01:36:23,931
I am here because
of the choices that I've made.

2095
01:36:23,965 --> 01:36:26,793
Your... your customers
become your friends,
like it's not just...

2096
01:36:26,827 --> 01:36:28,827
- Oh, she's like my bestie now,
it's wild.
- It's not,

2097
01:36:28,862 --> 01:36:30,206
it's not like going
into Target.

2098
01:36:30,241 --> 01:36:32,379
Like, my customers would be
like, "Hey, will this fit me?"

2099
01:36:32,413 --> 01:36:33,586
Because I know their size.

2100
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:35,620
- She really does.
- You build that friendship.

2101
01:36:35,655 --> 01:36:37,551
People would come up,
"Is that LuLa?"

2102
01:36:37,586 --> 01:36:39,034
And I'm like, "Yeah, it is."

2103
01:36:39,068 --> 01:36:40,689
- Well, and then you bond
with that person.
- Yeah.

2104
01:36:40,724 --> 01:36:42,241
'Cause they know what LuLa is,

2105
01:36:42,275 --> 01:36:44,206
- it's like this amazing bond.
- Absolutely.

2106
01:36:44,241 --> 01:36:46,275
It gave me the confidence
and then I started getting

2107
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:48,241
into working out
and then I started...

2108
01:36:48,275 --> 01:36:50,862
I actually managed to lose
like 60 pounds

2109
01:36:50,896 --> 01:36:52,862
That's awesome.

2110
01:36:52,896 --> 01:36:54,551
We are around and thriving.

2111
01:36:54,586 --> 01:36:57,034
And it's... again it's
a people's perception
and choice.

2112
01:36:57,068 --> 01:36:59,620
If they chose
to stop following LuLaRoe,

2113
01:36:59,655 --> 01:37:02,896
then in their life,
we don't exist anymore,

2114
01:37:02,931 --> 01:37:03,965
but we are still here.

2115
01:37:09,172 --> 01:37:14,689
I really, really hate
when MLM participants
are portrayed as suckers.

2116
01:37:14,724 --> 01:37:16,620
<i>There's nothing unusual
about someone</i>

2117
01:37:16,655 --> 01:37:19,517
<i>who would like
to run their own business</i>

2118
01:37:19,551 --> 01:37:22,310
<i>and have more time
with their families.</i>

2119
01:37:22,344 --> 01:37:25,620
<i>That is what the
American dream is,</i>

2120
01:37:25,655 --> 01:37:28,413
<i>and we've all been
pitched that since birth.</i>

2121
01:37:28,448 --> 01:37:31,413
People tend to think
that folks wind up in groups

2122
01:37:31,448 --> 01:37:34,448
like LuLaRoe
because of "brainwashing."

2123
01:37:34,482 --> 01:37:37,068
They were brainwashed.
They were mind-controlled.

2124
01:37:37,103 --> 01:37:38,586
That would never happen to me.

2125
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:41,793
We all are susceptible
to these methods
of manipulation.

2126
01:37:41,827 --> 01:37:45,448
LuLaRoe used the tools
of psychological

2127
01:37:45,482 --> 01:37:48,862
and emotional manipulation
to make money.

2128
01:37:48,896 --> 01:37:50,931
As long as there are people
in this country

2129
01:37:50,965 --> 01:37:53,482
who are locked out
of the dignified labor market

2130
01:37:53,517 --> 01:37:57,517
and made a promise
that the American dream
is still available to them,

2131
01:37:57,551 --> 01:37:59,413
the MLM industry will thrive.

2132
01:37:59,448 --> 01:38:03,862
I did join a couple
of other MLMs
after leaving LuLaRoe

2133
01:38:03,896 --> 01:38:05,310
just because I was
still trying to bring

2134
01:38:05,344 --> 01:38:07,482
a little bit of income
into my family life,

2135
01:38:08,344 --> 01:38:10,896
and none of those
panned out either.

2136
01:38:10,931 --> 01:38:15,310
After LuLaRoe,
I really finally got the idea

2137
01:38:15,344 --> 01:38:19,724
that this was not in any way
going to help me,

2138
01:38:19,758 --> 01:38:21,517
and that these types
of companies

2139
01:38:21,551 --> 01:38:23,310
were just predatory.

2140
01:38:27,344 --> 01:38:29,379
<i>Yeah, that's starting
to look like a good...</i>

2141
01:38:29,413 --> 01:38:30,689
It's ready to go,
cookie dough.

2142
01:38:31,206 --> 01:38:33,241
- See.
- Ooh.

2143
01:38:33,275 --> 01:38:35,793
You are my mother.
You hear the rhyme
you just did.

2144
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:37,965
It's ready to go,
cookie dough.

2145
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,310
- Aw!
- Mmm-hmm.

2146
01:38:39,344 --> 01:38:40,793
We could start us a jingle.

2147
01:38:40,827 --> 01:38:43,896
Well, the American dream
is for me

2148
01:38:43,931 --> 01:38:48,862
was, I promise you, just
to be financially stable

2149
01:38:48,896 --> 01:38:50,551
and own my own business.

2150
01:38:50,586 --> 01:38:52,586
<i>And LuLaRoe could have worked,</i>

2151
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:54,241
<i>could have been that for me.</i>

2152
01:38:54,275 --> 01:38:57,482
However, I... maybe I'll...
I'll take all blame, though.

2153
01:38:57,517 --> 01:39:00,931
I just didn't have
that fight to... to, um...

2154
01:39:03,793 --> 01:39:04,862
to make it happen.

2155
01:39:04,896 --> 01:39:06,827
<i>There you go. Voila!</i>

2156
01:39:06,862 --> 01:39:09,206
<i>But I... I would like
to give it one more shot,</i>

2157
01:39:09,241 --> 01:39:11,551
and it can be lucrative.

2158
01:39:11,586 --> 01:39:15,551
If LuLaRoe came to me tomorrow
and asked me,

2159
01:39:15,586 --> 01:39:19,655
"Hey, you wanna perform
on a cruise like you did?"

2160
01:39:19,689 --> 01:39:24,689
Heck yes, please.
Like, let's go, win.

2161
01:39:24,724 --> 01:39:26,482
Like, yeah, no, I...

2162
01:39:27,758 --> 01:39:29,310
in a heartbeat.

2163
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:32,724
- You never stop.
- No.

2164
01:39:32,758 --> 01:39:34,448
- Never stops, never.
- I can't.

2165
01:39:34,482 --> 01:39:36,241
Never, never stops. It's okay.

2166
01:39:36,275 --> 01:39:37,310
- I can't.

2167
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:39,241
- Oh.
- Check who that is.

2168
01:39:39,275 --> 01:39:41,586
That is just in time.

2169
01:39:41,620 --> 01:39:44,551
I get asked all the time,
after my experience
with LuLaRoe,

2170
01:39:44,586 --> 01:39:47,586
"Why in the world
would you do another
direct sales company?"

2171
01:39:48,448 --> 01:39:50,241
And the answer is,

2172
01:39:50,275 --> 01:39:52,586
I honestly feel
it's apples and oranges.

2173
01:39:53,344 --> 01:39:54,793
Here's my nail collection.

2174
01:39:56,689 --> 01:39:58,586
I have like the
entire collection almost.

2175
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:00,068
I'm missing two.

2176
01:40:00,103 --> 01:40:04,413
<i>If you look
at the Better Bureau Business,
the BBB rating,</i>

2177
01:40:04,448 --> 01:40:06,896
I think LuLaRoe had an F.

2178
01:40:06,931 --> 01:40:10,034
And my new companies
Plunder, Red Aspen,
they have an A.

2179
01:40:10,068 --> 01:40:11,931
I think that says something.

2180
01:40:11,965 --> 01:40:14,724
So this is my
old LuLaRoe group.

2181
01:40:14,758 --> 01:40:16,241
<i>I struggle
with this MLM</i>

2182
01:40:16,275 --> 01:40:18,655
<i>because I do like MLMs.</i>

2183
01:40:18,689 --> 01:40:20,862
<i>I love a lot
of different MLMs,</i>

2184
01:40:20,896 --> 01:40:23,137
<i>and I like to support
other women</i>

2185
01:40:23,172 --> 01:40:24,965
<i>and their businesses,
of course.</i>

2186
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,137
So, I would like to say
that I'm not for them,

2187
01:40:28,172 --> 01:40:30,310
but my nails come from them.

2188
01:40:30,344 --> 01:40:31,896
My candles come from them.

2189
01:40:31,931 --> 01:40:34,275
You know what I mean?
Like, I feel like
there's a purpose for it.

2190
01:40:34,793 --> 01:40:35,896
Um...

2191
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:41,620
And I feel like
they've been around
for decades and decades.

2192
01:40:43,275 --> 01:40:45,448
<i>My advice
to anybody going</i>

2193
01:40:45,482 --> 01:40:48,655
<i>into an MLM
or even considering it.</i>

2194
01:40:48,689 --> 01:40:50,413
I don't care
if it's nail strips,

2195
01:40:50,448 --> 01:40:53,896
protein shakes, vitamins,
what else is out there,

2196
01:40:53,931 --> 01:40:57,206
make-up, um, hair products.

2197
01:40:57,793 --> 01:41:00,137
I don't care what it is.

2198
01:41:00,172 --> 01:41:04,310
Say no. Run as far as you can,
as fast as you can.

2199
01:41:06,965 --> 01:41:08,620
<i>I don't think
the takeaway</i>

2200
01:41:08,655 --> 01:41:11,034
<i>from the LulaRoe's story is
that it's wrong to have hope.</i>

2201
01:41:11,827 --> 01:41:13,827
<i>It's good to have hope.</i>

2202
01:41:13,862 --> 01:41:17,551
<i>The American dream
preys on hope.</i>

2203
01:41:17,586 --> 01:41:21,000
<i>And so until we make
the American dream</i>

2204
01:41:21,655 --> 01:41:23,620
<i>less all-consuming,</i>

2205
01:41:23,655 --> 01:41:27,206
<i>that hope will lead people
to harm.</i>

2206
01:41:27,241 --> 01:41:29,827
So, it's the American dream
that has to change,

2207
01:41:29,862 --> 01:41:32,482
not our capacity to hope
that has to change.

2208
01:41:35,310 --> 01:41:36,379
<i>I'm not surprised
at all</i>

2209
01:41:36,413 --> 01:41:38,448
<i>that LuLaRoe still exists.</i>

2210
01:41:38,482 --> 01:41:41,620
<i>This is just what the people
who start MLMs do.</i>

2211
01:41:41,655 --> 01:41:44,689
<i>And if it wasn't LuLaRoe
that was sticking around,</i>

2212
01:41:44,724 --> 01:41:47,241
Mark and DeAnne
would go start another MLM.

2213
01:41:47,275 --> 01:41:49,724
<i>We're aware
of the negativity,
but guess what?</i>

2214
01:41:49,758 --> 01:41:53,655
<i>It is a minute amount
compared to all</i>

2215
01:41:53,689 --> 01:41:56,482
<i>of the amazing positive things
that are happening.</i>

2216
01:41:56,517 --> 01:41:58,931
<i>Forget about using
the truth as your defense.</i>

2217
01:41:58,965 --> 01:42:01,034
<i>Use kindness as your defense.</i>

2218
01:42:01,068 --> 01:42:02,931
<i>That is the culture
of LuLaRoe.</i>

2219
01:42:02,965 --> 01:42:05,000
This is just the way
we do business here

2220
01:42:05,551 --> 01:42:08,206
to make people think

2221
01:42:08,241 --> 01:42:11,068
that they're pursuing
their own success

2222
01:42:11,103 --> 01:42:14,758
while they're actually
making someone else rich.

2223
01:42:17,068 --> 01:42:20,586
<i>It's just greed,
pure American greed.</i>

2224
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:23,206
<i>Each and every
one of you are a part
of the American dream</i>

2225
01:42:23,241 --> 01:42:26,931
<i>because you are entrepreneurs
and you own your own business,</i>

2226
01:42:26,965 --> 01:42:30,034
<i>and I will tell you,
some days are not so good.</i>

2227
01:42:30,068 --> 01:42:31,620
<i>Guess what?</i>

2228
01:42:31,655 --> 01:42:34,862
<i>So many days are so amazing.</i>

2229
01:42:38,413 --> 01:42:39,724
LuLaRoe.
