3
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,896
Even lost souls have a place.

4
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,338
Phellinus linteus.

5
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,641
That's the species.

6
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,343
Grows on mulberry trees.

7
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,679
Tastes like cow
manure, cures cancer.

8
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,514
Well, that's not entirely true.

9
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,716
Some evidence suggests that

10
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,584
polysaccharides isolated
from the mushrooms

11
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:20,387
inhibit the tumor growth by
stimulating proliferation

12
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,922
of the t lymphocytes
and immune function.

13
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,401
If you tell me what you
want with these things

14
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:27,127
I could probably give you
some more information.

15
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,163
Hey, you up for a trade?

16
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:33,734
I got some...

17
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,172
Trail mix.

18
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,341
I've been looking for
those mushrooms all day,

19
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:42,710
but now I know why I haven't
been able to find them.

20
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:43,743
Here.

21
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:26,440
Eileen.

22
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,810
I brought you a new friend,

23
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,378
Rocco.

24
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,980
Rocco, meet Eileen.

25
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:38,418
Hello Eileen,
you're looking good.

26
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,855
All right, I'll leave you two.

27
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,424
Get to know each
other a little bit.

28
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,387
Huh.

29
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:05,146
Hmm.

30
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,148
You're mad at me Eileen.

31
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:08,282
I get it.

32
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,916
I haven't been
giving you much love.

33
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,218
No love at all.

34
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,231
I've been spending a
little too much time

35
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:16,190
in my own little world,

36
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,359
while you've been drying up.

37
00:19:18,392 --> 00:19:22,563
Withering away in some dark
corner of the universe.

38
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:24,331
Cold, alone and mute.

39
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:26,932
I'm sorry.

40
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:32,473
I'm gonna make it up
to you, I promise.

41
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:31,764
Hello.

42
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,534
Dr. Mercer.

43
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,934
- Yes.
- It's Alicia Freedman.

44
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:36,103
How are you doing?

45
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:37,471
Dr. Freedman.

46
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,707
It's nice to hear from
you, it's been too long.

47
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,275
How's your post-doc going?

48
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,577
Not bad, all things considered.

49
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:45,379
Cornell is not a rough
place to do a post-doc

50
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:46,913
from what I hear.

51
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,582
My latest study
got accepted into nature.

52
00:20:48,616 --> 00:20:49,916
So that's something at least.

53
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:50,883
Something?

54
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,052
That's absolutely fantastic.

55
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:53,254
What was the study?

56
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:54,821
I looked at the impact

57
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,732
of arbuscular mycorrhizal
fungi on nitrogen cycling

58
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,260
in various ecosystems.

59
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:02,795
Wow, you're gonna be
the lab's golden child.

60
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,466
I'm sure Richard will get his
ro1 renewed a few times over

61
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:06,667
with a nature publication.

62
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,102
Thank you.

63
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:10,204
Well, send me your
paper, I'd love to read it.

64
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:11,639
Hot off the press, will do.

65
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:12,792
Following in your footsteps.

66
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,618
Ha! I wish.
You're leaving me in the dust.

67
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:15,609
No way.

68
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:16,943
You're a brilliant scientist.

69
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,178
What can I do for you, Alicia?

70
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:19,979
I know you
prefer to avoid academia

71
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:22,349
and all of its pretentious
trappings these days,

72
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:25,152
can you write me a letter of
recommendation for the k award?

73
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:26,654
Well, normally i'd,

74
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:28,888
I'd avoid any remnants of
that whole grotesque world,

75
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,358
but you were a fantastic student

76
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:34,428
and you definitely deserve
a k award more than anyone.

77
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,130
So for you,

78
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:37,897
this once, yes.

79
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,133
I would be so grateful.

80
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,302
- Yes I'll do it.
- Thank you so much.

81
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:42,569
When's the deadline?

82
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:45,673
In two weeks,
I'll send you the form.

83
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:46,873
Perfect.

84
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,075
Send it over.

85
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:50,577
Listen, have a great
day and congratulations.

86
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:51,820
- Have a great day-
- it's all right.

87
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,414
Thanks again.

88
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:10,863
Hey, who's there?

89
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,100
Hey.

90
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,070
What are you doing here, kid?

91
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:17,970
I don't mean any harm.

92
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,674
I'm not arguing with you,
what are you doing here?

93
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:24,977
I brought you back
your bowl, your fork too.

94
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,946
Well, couldn't
this wait 'till daylight?

95
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:27,979
Probably.

96
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,691
I, I was wondering if you
had any more of that food.

97
00:22:37,725 --> 00:22:39,727
Don't you have a home?

98
00:22:49,103 --> 00:22:50,937
All right, come on in.

99
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,628
What's your name?

100
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:15,995
Elvis.

101
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,601
After Elvis Presley?

102
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:21,435
No,

103
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,203
after Elvis costello.

104
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:29,376
Your mama name
you after Elvis costello?

105
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,943
Mm-mm.

106
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,647
Nope, she died the
day I was born.

107
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,816
I'm sorry to hear that.

108
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:38,118
I never knew her.

109
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:42,556
Well, why did you
get named after Elvis costello?

110
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:46,360
My daddy, the night mama died,

111
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:48,162
he held me in his
arms in the hospital

112
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:50,531
and he played an Elvis
costello song over and over

113
00:23:50,564 --> 00:23:54,067
while his tears fell
down my baby face.

114
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,103
What was the song?

115
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:57,805
It was called "I want you"

116
00:23:57,838 --> 00:24:00,940
from the album "blood
and chocolate".

117
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:05,612
That's a really sad story.

118
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:07,947
My daddy says the snow was
falling outside the window,

119
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,192
and when the clock
struck midnight

120
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,752
he knew that my name was Elvis.

121
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,555
Is your daddy still alive?

122
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:17,124
Yes, but why do you wanna know?

123
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:21,228
Well, he must be
wondering where you are.

124
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:23,130
I'm not going home

125
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:24,531
if that's what
you're getting at,

126
00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:27,634
for a whole series of reasons.

127
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:29,969
You can't live in
the woods, you know.

128
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:31,003
Says who?

129
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:37,644
Well, I got a spare bedroom,
you can stay there tonight.

130
00:24:37,678 --> 00:24:39,580
But we gotta get you to
a real home tomorrow.

131
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:42,282
What does real home even mean?

132
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:48,689
I haven't been around children
or family for a long time.

133
00:24:48,722 --> 00:24:53,093
It's been about 40 or 50 years
since I was even part of one.

134
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:57,464
So you're not really the
best one to ask, are you?

135
00:25:09,443 --> 00:25:11,187
You got a lot of weird
stuff in your kitchen,

136
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:14,748
I mean, compared to other
people's kitchens, no offense.

137
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:19,119
I have no idea what other
people have in their kitchen.

138
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:20,430
So what do you do
with all these mushrooms

139
00:25:20,454 --> 00:25:21,955
I saw you hunting?

140
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:24,858
I use them for my old man aches.

141
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:26,493
Are you like a
wizard or something?

142
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:27,794
Exactly.

143
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:29,663
Or more specifically
a retired botanist

144
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:32,566
with rheumatoid arthritis.

145
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,601
Sounds spooky.

146
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:36,803
I studied fungi in
my lab for many years,

147
00:25:36,837 --> 00:25:40,841
extracting various
components to treat diseases.

148
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:43,644
What kinds of diseases?

149
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:47,648
Viruses, cancer,
diabetes, for starters.

150
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:49,182
So you put the
mushrooms in a cauldron

151
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:53,287
and then you don't get cancer?

152
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,989
I study medicinal
chemistry methods,

153
00:25:56,024 --> 00:25:57,658
extracting certain molecules

154
00:25:57,691 --> 00:26:01,194
that reduce the
inflammation in my joints.

155
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:03,830
Does it work?

156
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:07,834
It helps, but my
methods are rudimentary.

157
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:09,369
I mean, I think I
was a lot better off

158
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:13,140
when I had all that fancy
machinery back at my lab.

159
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:17,011
I think it's reducing
the swell, but over time.

160
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:22,716
Hmm, why don't you
just go to the doctor?

161
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,184
I do when I have to,

162
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:26,486
but I hate modern medicine.

163
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:30,490
Every time they give me advice,

164
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:31,868
my rheumatoid
arthritis gets better,

165
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:34,928
but then I get 20
other problems.

166
00:26:34,962 --> 00:26:36,797
You sound like my dad.

167
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,066
What's wrong with your dad?

168
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:41,802
He becomes one with
the alien sometimes.

169
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:43,570
One with the alien?

170
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:45,939
Well,

171
00:26:45,973 --> 00:26:48,642
it's like an alien takes
over his earthly body

172
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:53,513
to alert the world of impending
doom, something like that.

173
00:26:55,382 --> 00:26:58,485
Sounds like he's
got schizophrenia.

174
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:00,730
That's what the doctors call it.

175
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:02,422
They say the alien isn't real,

176
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:05,125
and that my daddy needs
a lot of medicine.

177
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:06,560
Hmm.

178
00:27:06,593 --> 00:27:11,331
Well, maybe they're just
trying to protect him and you.

179
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:13,266
Or maybe they're worried

180
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,477
that the alien is gonna
make him do something-

181
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:15,501
- crazy?

182
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:27,147
Can I come mushroom
hunting with you?

183
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,082
Today?

184
00:27:28,116 --> 00:27:30,651
Well, aren't you going?

185
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:32,352
Yeah, I'm going.

186
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:33,186
You wanna come?

187
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,788
You can come along.

188
00:27:59,212 --> 00:28:01,181
Here,

189
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:02,849
come around here.

190
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:04,384
Yeah, I can see it.

191
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:06,253
- Right there.
- Mm-hm.

192
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:09,956
Hey, see this.

193
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,426
Looks like charcoal, right?

194
00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:16,596
It's called inonotus obliquus,
otherwise known as chaga.

195
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,598
It looks ugly, but it's
been used for hundreds,

196
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:21,735
maybe even thousands of
years by different cultures.

197
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:23,336
They say it has
medicinal qualities,

198
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,807
that it can heal a sick
birch tree where it lives.

199
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,509
Take a look at the inside of it.

200
00:28:30,343 --> 00:28:31,378
It's almost orange.

201
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:32,379
Yeah.

202
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:33,556
I mean, you could
use it as a dye,

203
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,716
but I think that's wasteful.

204
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:38,394
You know, when you
harvest these things,

205
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:39,929
you have to make sure that
you only take half of it

206
00:28:39,953 --> 00:28:41,254
off the tree,

207
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:42,756
otherwise you can hurt the tree,

208
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:45,193
and you can come back for
more in a couple of years.

209
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:48,795
The earth has all these
amazing organisms,

210
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:51,465
if we take care of them,
they'll take care of us.

211
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:53,067
How does this one
take care of us?

212
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:54,101
Well,

213
00:28:55,136 --> 00:28:58,172
might fight certain
kinds of cancer.

214
00:28:58,206 --> 00:29:01,675
There's plenty of evidence
that what chaga actually does

215
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:04,611
is up-regulate the expression
of pro-apoptotic proteins

216
00:29:04,644 --> 00:29:05,812
in cancer cells.

217
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:08,315
Basically it stops
the growth of tumors.

218
00:29:08,348 --> 00:29:09,816
Russians have known
this for years

219
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,120
and other therapeutic
reasons as well.

220
00:29:12,153 --> 00:29:16,990
I care about it because of it's
anti-inflammatory medicine.

221
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:19,392
My joints, they swell up

222
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:21,261
and after a while
they can get damaged

223
00:29:21,294 --> 00:29:25,699
so my immune system is a piece
of crap, pardon my Latin.

224
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:26,972
So do you eat it like an apple?

225
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,902
I don't, others might.

226
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:31,471
I use a double extraction
tincture method.

227
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:34,841
What I do is I grind up
the chaga into a powder,

228
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,244
I add some alcohol,

229
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,911
and I shake it up a
couple of times a day

230
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:39,080
for a couple of months,

231
00:29:39,113 --> 00:29:41,681
and then I do a
bunch of other steps,

232
00:29:41,715 --> 00:29:44,885
but I'm not gonna
bore you with those.

233
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:47,788
Plants are pretty cool, huh?

234
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:52,359
Ah, fungi actually
aren't plants, they're...

235
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:54,895
They were classified that
way because they didn't move.

236
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:56,696
And back in the late
'60s, early 70s,

237
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,298
a guy named Robert whittaker,

238
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:01,035
he proposed they get
their own kingdom.

239
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:03,303
They're actually more like us

240
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:05,672
than they are plants by the way.

241
00:30:05,705 --> 00:30:07,275
They don't look much like us.

242
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:10,211
Yeah, nothing much
looks like me.

243
00:30:10,244 --> 00:30:11,745
You know, when I was your age,

244
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:13,214
I used to gather up mushrooms

245
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:16,017
and bring them to the
back porch for my mother.

246
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,152
I used to think they
were the most bizarre,

247
00:30:18,186 --> 00:30:20,587
beautiful structures
I'd ever seen.

248
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,232
She would cook 'em up
and serve 'em to my dad

249
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:23,390
after he came home

250
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:25,092
from working long hours
in the coal mines.

251
00:30:25,126 --> 00:30:29,230
One of his favorites was
laetiporus sulphureus,

252
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:32,465
better known as
chicken of the woods.

253
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,202
If you eat it, so it
tastes like chicken?

254
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:35,969
Yeah, kind of.

255
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,214
But there's also
hen of the woods,

256
00:30:37,238 --> 00:30:38,705
that tastes a lot better.

257
00:30:38,738 --> 00:30:41,275
Mushrooms are bad-ass little
organisms, if you ask me.

258
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:43,144
I knew you had some
cool backstory to you.

259
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:45,321
When you left me that lunch
on the rock a few days ago,

260
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,680
I knew that you were solid.

261
00:30:46,713 --> 00:30:48,249
I don't know how solid I am,

262
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:52,053
but I try to follow
my internal compass.

263
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:53,321
What's that?

264
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:56,290
You know, just try
to do the right thing.

265
00:30:56,324 --> 00:30:59,026
Thought you might
need some help.

266
00:31:05,498 --> 00:31:07,667
What do you normally
eat at your house?

267
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,170
It depends.

268
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:10,314
If my dad's home he'll make me

269
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:11,818
one of those dinners
from the freezer.

270
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:13,640
TV dinner?

271
00:31:13,673 --> 00:31:14,673
Hm.

272
00:31:15,942 --> 00:31:19,880
Like Salisbury steak with
potatoes on the side.

273
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:21,948
What does your
dad do for a living?

274
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:23,583
He works in a factory
stacking lumber,

275
00:31:23,617 --> 00:31:26,419
but that's not his passion.

276
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:28,655
What's his passion?

277
00:31:28,688 --> 00:31:30,790
Music, he plays the guitar
and he's good at it too,

278
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:32,792
but every time he doesn't
take his medicine,

279
00:31:32,826 --> 00:31:35,929
he, he can't go to work
or play the guitar.

280
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:37,797
I always end up in
some foster home

281
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:40,901
and the last one I
was in was real bad.

282
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:42,736
Do you have any aunts or uncles?

283
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:44,604
Yeah, but they're in jail.

284
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:46,340
What for?

285
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:48,975
I don't know, drugs, maybe.

286
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,710
That's really sad.

287
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,646
Sounds like you had
a rough go of it.

288
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:55,916
Well, I'm having a picnic
with a retired botanists,

289
00:31:55,949 --> 00:31:57,218
and I'm learning new things.

290
00:31:57,251 --> 00:32:00,288
So I can't complain
at this very second.

291
00:32:00,321 --> 00:32:01,664
Don't you think your
school will be missing you

292
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:03,590
and come looking for you?

293
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:05,425
I don't know, maybe.

294
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,272
Missing school is not
a great idea, Elvis,

295
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:09,596
I'm just saying.

296
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,333
Education is the key.

297
00:32:13,867 --> 00:32:16,103
To what?

298
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:18,372
You know, a lot of
people drop out of school

299
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:21,409
because they don't
have a choice.

300
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:23,010
They struggle to
pay their bills,

301
00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:25,679
they ended up taking jobs
that endanger their lives,

302
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,348
or they turn to crime
and end up in jail.

303
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:28,848
I mean,

304
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:31,618
I'm not trying to sound like
a public service announcement,

305
00:32:31,651 --> 00:32:33,187
but that's the way it happens.

306
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,189
It's a cycle, you know.

307
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:37,158
Then their kids have
nothing to look up to

308
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:38,692
and they have no hope.

309
00:32:38,725 --> 00:32:40,827
You have to be the one
to break the cycle.

310
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,697
Did you break the cycle?

311
00:32:44,864 --> 00:32:46,300
My dad died of lung disease

312
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:50,503
from working in the
mines for many years.

313
00:32:50,537 --> 00:32:54,541
My mom and I stood over
his grave when I was 17.

314
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,447
She told me, "you can't
die like your daddy did.

315
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,415
You're all I got left."

316
00:33:02,615 --> 00:33:03,850
So you have a phd

317
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:05,618
and that's why you're
not dead right now?

318
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:06,786
No, it's not that simple.

319
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,189
Yeah, I got a phd in botany,

320
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:12,126
and, you know, I ran a
good lab for many years.

321
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:16,163
But you still have
some weird disease.

322
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:18,366
Your phd can't do
anything about that.

323
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,469
True, but my disease is
not based on my life choices,

324
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:24,271
at least not that I know of.

325
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:26,539
You can't live in an abandoned
school bus, you know,

326
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,942
that's, that's not
a great solution.

327
00:33:28,975 --> 00:33:31,811
What do you know about that bus?

328
00:33:33,381 --> 00:33:35,383
I saw you run into
it a couple of days ago

329
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:39,186
when you were following
me through the woods.

330
00:33:40,321 --> 00:33:41,821
You know the history
of that park?

331
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:43,090
Of what park?

332
00:33:44,025 --> 00:33:45,192
Lake shawnee.

333
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:47,161
You know the history
of lake shawnee?

334
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:50,597
Well, it's an abandoned
amusement park

335
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,466
that was built in the 1920s

336
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,004
over what they think is native
American burial grounds.

337
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:00,241
A little girl was playing
on the swings and she died

338
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:01,475
in the '60s,

339
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:04,245
so they shut the
whole place down.

340
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:06,679
Why would they take that
land from the native Americans

341
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:08,315
in the first place?

342
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:11,452
The English settlers,

343
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:13,454
they took it from
the native Americans.

344
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:16,123
And lore has it that there
was a turf war in that area

345
00:34:16,157 --> 00:34:17,258
in the 1700s.

346
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:21,694
Ah, they shouldn't have
fought over that land.

347
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:23,963
They should've come up
with something peaceful.

348
00:34:23,997 --> 00:34:25,499
Agreed.

349
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:28,235
Violence in and of itself is
not the answer to anything.

350
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:29,537
That's my whole point.

351
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:32,506
Two wrongs don't make a right.

352
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,540
Well.

353
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:37,411
How do you like the picnic?

354
00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:56,397
- Yes.
- Jack?

355
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,431
Who's this?

356
00:34:57,465 --> 00:34:58,832
Ah this is Michael Mercer.

357
00:34:58,865 --> 00:35:00,934
- How are you?
- Dr. Mercer, how are things?

358
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:01,868
Long time, no speak.

359
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:03,337
All is going well.

360
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,148
Are you still working at that
same lab you told me about

361
00:35:05,172 --> 00:35:06,073
the last time we spoke?

362
00:35:06,107 --> 00:35:08,576
New lab, c. Elegans.

363
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:10,277
Yes, pretty good model organism.

364
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:11,620
Well, i'm
pouring plates every day,

365
00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:12,846
so nothing too exciting.

366
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:14,448
Smelly yellow jello, I call it.

367
00:35:14,482 --> 00:35:16,150
Well, that's something
to be proud of.

368
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:17,451
The scientists like me though.

369
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:19,086
I have a question for you.

370
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,521
Shoot.

371
00:35:20,554 --> 00:35:22,365
Is your brother still working
at the police department?

372
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,158
Yep, he's still a cop.

373
00:35:24,191 --> 00:35:27,128
Can you ask him to look
into something for me?

374
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:28,962
Sure, what is it?

375
00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:31,831
A runaway kid has been living
in the woods near my house.

376
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:33,700
He needed food and
he need shelter,

377
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:36,669
so I took him in and
I gave him some food,

378
00:35:36,703 --> 00:35:38,572
but he refused to go home

379
00:35:38,606 --> 00:35:39,748
and he wouldn't give
me his last name.

380
00:35:39,772 --> 00:35:41,275
Tough one.

381
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,910
Apparently he keeps
ending up in foster care.

382
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:45,645
His dad is ill.

383
00:35:45,678 --> 00:35:47,148
Look, I wanna help him,

384
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:48,815
but I don't want
him missing school

385
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:50,560
and I definitely don't want
his father being worried

386
00:35:50,584 --> 00:35:52,119
about him.

387
00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:53,354
And on the other hand,

388
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:54,930
I don't wanna turn him
in to the police station

389
00:35:54,954 --> 00:35:56,932
because it sounds like he's
been through hell and back.

390
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:58,135
I don't know
what I would do either.

391
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,460
But can you,

392
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:02,530
can you ask your brother if
there's been a missing kid

393
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:05,865
with the first name
Elvis in morgantown?

394
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:07,377
I'll call my
brother and buzz you back.

395
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:09,702
You know, maybe give him
a little of his back story.

396
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:12,439
No problem, will do.

397
00:36:12,473 --> 00:36:14,408
Terrific, thanks Jack.

398
00:36:26,086 --> 00:36:27,321
Rise and shine.

399
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:30,690
What time is it?

400
00:36:30,723 --> 00:36:32,593
Time for school.

401
00:36:32,626 --> 00:36:33,693
Is that a joke?

402
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:34,928
Kinda.

403
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:38,765
Go brush your teeth,
we're taking a drive.

404
00:36:38,798 --> 00:36:39,798
Come on.

405
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:08,128
When you think of west
Virginia, what do you think of?

406
00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:10,431
Mountains, drugs and blue skies.

407
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:11,931
What else?

408
00:37:11,965 --> 00:37:14,335
"Mountaineers are always
free," that's the motto.

409
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,769
Yep, montani semper liberi.

410
00:37:16,803 --> 00:37:18,706
Did you learn that at school?

411
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:19,939
Yeah, but don't ask me which,

412
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:23,110
'cause I ain't going
back there right now.

413
00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:24,078
If you could learn anything,

414
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:26,213
what would you wanna learn?

415
00:37:26,247 --> 00:37:27,981
How to build bubble houses.

416
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:29,416
Bubble houses?

417
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,019
You know those igloo looking
houses without windows?

418
00:37:32,052 --> 00:37:34,488
They're the safest
places you can live.

419
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:36,889
If a hurricane or tornado
hits you in your bubble house

420
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:38,158
you'll be fine.

421
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:40,060
I didn't know that.

422
00:37:40,094 --> 00:37:41,262
Doesn't really make sense

423
00:37:41,295 --> 00:37:43,063
why people live in
other kinds of houses.

424
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:45,865
Well, maybe they like
windows or sunshine.

425
00:37:45,898 --> 00:37:48,435
Maybe they don't like the
way those things look.

426
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:49,936
Well, I think that's shallow.

427
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:53,073
Why would people choose
looks over safety?

428
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:54,541
Hmm.

429
00:37:54,575 --> 00:37:55,808
That's really a good point.

430
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:59,346
People are really into
what things look like.

431
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,316
That's just gross,
if you ask me.

432
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:10,758
What are we doing here?

433
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,958
You need some clothes.

434
00:38:11,991 --> 00:38:13,761
You can't wear the
same thing every day.

435
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:15,095
Who says?

436
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,030
I don't know,

437
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:17,598
the clothes police, who cares?

438
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:19,099
Here's the deal.

439
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:21,568
I don't know anything about
kids much less kids' clothes.

440
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:24,738
So I'm gonna let you
figure out what you want

441
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:26,540
and then I'm gonna pay for it.

442
00:38:26,573 --> 00:38:28,075
What if I just want some candy,

443
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:29,743
can I keep the
rest of the money?

444
00:38:29,777 --> 00:38:32,646
No, this is your big
moment to be responsible.

445
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,914
Sounds stressful.

446
00:38:34,947 --> 00:38:36,116
I'll be waiting right here.

447
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,585
Don't worry, i'm
not going anywhere.

448
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,263
What did you get?

449
00:38:50,597 --> 00:38:51,799
Huh,

450
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:55,135
some shoes, shorts,
socks, pants, pajamas.

451
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:57,304
That was fast.

452
00:38:57,338 --> 00:38:59,006
I was scared you
were gonna drive away.

453
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,274
Well, I'm still here.

454
00:39:00,307 --> 00:39:02,076
Put on your seatbelt.

455
00:40:11,044 --> 00:40:13,180
My father died 40
years ago today.

456
00:40:13,213 --> 00:40:15,249
Do you think he's
with god right now?

457
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:16,383
I don't really know.

458
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:18,685
I never much believed in god.

459
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:19,919
Believing in god

460
00:40:19,952 --> 00:40:22,189
doesn't have anything to
do with god, you know.

461
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:23,290
What do you mean?

462
00:40:23,323 --> 00:40:25,092
Believing in god helps us.

463
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:26,369
If you don't have
anyone to pray to

464
00:40:26,393 --> 00:40:28,562
how can you have any hope?

465
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,598
I believe in science.

466
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:33,109
Science won't comfort
you in the night

467
00:40:33,133 --> 00:40:35,135
when you're cold and alone.

468
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:36,169
Hmm.

469
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,540
Maybe you're right.

470
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:42,042
My father was a good man.

471
00:40:42,075 --> 00:40:44,011
He worked hard,

472
00:40:44,044 --> 00:40:45,446
helped people.

473
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:47,381
You'll see him again.

474
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,378
You a fan of ice cream?

475
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:52,646
Yeah.

476
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,867
Do you always eat ice cream

477
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:16,470
after you go to the graveyard?

478
00:42:16,503 --> 00:42:19,273
No, but I might start.

479
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:24,678
You know,
death doesn't scare me.

480
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:26,146
Oh, really?

481
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:28,348
What does scare you?

482
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:30,551
Hm, going crazy.

483
00:42:31,752 --> 00:42:35,322
Yeah, that would be a lot worse.

484
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:37,658
Your body just
sees what it wants to see

485
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:38,902
and hears what it wants to hear

486
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:40,327
and does what it wants to do.

487
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,895
It's not fair.

488
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:44,164
Well, illness isn't fair.

489
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:52,205
Are you a fan
of strawberry ice cream?

490
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,307
Not really.

491
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:57,477
Ms. Davis brought it to
me from down the road.

492
00:42:57,511 --> 00:42:59,013
She had some extra
frozen strawberries

493
00:42:59,047 --> 00:43:01,715
she needed to do something with.

494
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:06,620
Chocolate is way better.

495
00:43:06,653 --> 00:43:08,288
I'll let her know.

496
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:26,506
Have you read "the hobbit"?

497
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,709
Never even heard of it.

498
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:31,045
Oh, you should give it a shot.

499
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,946
I have another book as well,

500
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,880
it's pretty good.

501
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:35,983
It's more of a kid's book.

502
00:43:36,017 --> 00:43:39,653
It's about a guy who
lives in a mushroom house.

503
00:43:39,686 --> 00:43:43,523
My grad students gave it
to me for a birthday gift.

504
00:43:43,557 --> 00:43:44,625
Hey, did you,

505
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:46,893
did you brush your teeth?

506
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:48,161
Mm-hm, yeah.

507
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:49,196
Two minutes?

508
00:43:49,229 --> 00:43:51,065
Five minutes.

509
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,633
Really?

510
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:55,002
All right, well, good night.

511
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:05,879
Mr. Mercer.

512
00:44:06,747 --> 00:44:08,315
Yes, Elvis.

513
00:44:08,348 --> 00:44:11,952
I can't read very well.

514
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:13,087
It's okay.

515
00:44:13,121 --> 00:44:14,287
It's not a requirement.

516
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:16,223
You can just leave
'em on the nightstand

517
00:44:16,256 --> 00:44:17,467
and I'll put 'em back tomorrow.

518
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:18,659
Can you read to me?

519
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:19,693
Can't sleep.

520
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:23,663
Sure.

521
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:29,469
You might not like "the hobbit",

522
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:31,838
it was written a long time ago.

523
00:44:31,872 --> 00:44:33,340
I'm gonna read you

524
00:44:33,373 --> 00:44:34,917
the one about the guy who
lives in the mushroom house.

525
00:44:34,941 --> 00:44:37,577
My students thought
it was hilarious

526
00:44:37,611 --> 00:44:39,613
when they gave it to me.

527
00:44:42,716 --> 00:44:45,886
"Jasper Jenkins was
a small, slim man,

528
00:44:47,254 --> 00:44:50,924
with big feet and
long skinny fingers.

529
00:44:50,957 --> 00:44:54,594
He was jolly most of the
time and had a wide grin

530
00:44:54,628 --> 00:44:58,331
that brightened up the neighborhood
whenever he would smile.

531
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:03,203
Jasper was the only man in town
who lived inside a mushroom.

532
00:45:03,236 --> 00:45:05,173
It had tiny windows

533
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:08,042
and he would sit beside
them on rainy days

534
00:45:08,076 --> 00:45:12,379
and watch the drops fall
from the sky and hit the mud.

535
00:45:12,412 --> 00:45:13,814
Ping, ping, ping.

536
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:20,320
The mushroom house on
the outskirts of town

537
00:45:20,353 --> 00:45:23,057
had everything Jasper needed.

538
00:45:23,091 --> 00:45:26,893
He liked to bake cookies
in the big, round oven,

539
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:31,465
and pass them out to the city
kids on Saturday evenings.

540
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:34,634
He was everyone's favorite guy.

541
00:45:34,668 --> 00:45:35,668
"He..."

542
00:45:58,525 --> 00:45:59,726
Michael Mercer here.

543
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,294
Hi, Dr. Mercer, it's Jack.

544
00:46:01,328 --> 00:46:02,262
Jack, hi.

545
00:46:02,295 --> 00:46:04,431
Did you find out anything?

546
00:46:04,464 --> 00:46:06,800
Are you sure his name's Elvis?

547
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:08,335
I guess I'm not that sure.

548
00:46:08,368 --> 00:46:10,871
Any kids reported missing
in the last couple of weeks?

549
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:13,807
Unfortunately not, no kids, doc.

550
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,475
That's helpful, thanks Jack.

551
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:17,221
Yeah, no, I have to think
about what to do next.

552
00:46:17,245 --> 00:46:19,213
Maybe you can get
him to tell you his last name.

553
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:21,158
Yeah, I'll give it a shot
and I'll give you a call back.

554
00:46:21,182 --> 00:46:22,391
My brother says
you can call him directly

555
00:46:22,415 --> 00:46:23,617
- next time.
- Thanks, Jack.

556
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,386
I'll text you his number.

557
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:30,690
You like the book?

558
00:46:30,724 --> 00:46:33,360
Yeah, I like what parts
of it I can understand.

559
00:46:33,393 --> 00:46:36,530
Oh, the more you read,
the easier it gets.

560
00:46:36,563 --> 00:46:38,132
I'm also not
that good at school.

561
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:39,633
You know you're very smart.

562
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:42,103
Maybe you're just not
applying yourself.

563
00:46:42,136 --> 00:46:44,138
It also helps if you go.

564
00:46:45,438 --> 00:46:46,783
I gotta write a recommendation
letter for a friend

565
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:49,810
so you can either
keep reading that book

566
00:46:49,843 --> 00:46:52,679
or I can put you to work
doing some chores for me.

567
00:46:52,712 --> 00:46:54,915
What kinds of chores?

568
00:46:54,948 --> 00:46:56,716
You can either
do some mushrooming

569
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,086
or you can rake the leaves.

570
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,288
Raking leaves isn't my thing,

571
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,688
I'd rather go mushrooming.

572
00:47:01,721 --> 00:47:03,057
Okay.

573
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:07,028
I'll give you $5 for every
chaga chunk you bring to me.

574
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:09,030
But no cheating.

575
00:47:09,063 --> 00:47:11,998
You can't take the whole
batch from the tree.

576
00:47:12,033 --> 00:47:13,033
Deal?

577
00:47:14,801 --> 00:47:15,969
Deal?

578
00:47:16,002 --> 00:47:17,238
- Sure.
- Okay.

579
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:21,374
So what you're gonna look for,

580
00:47:21,408 --> 00:47:25,412
remember, like the last
time, is the charcoal.

581
00:47:25,445 --> 00:47:26,646
It looks like charcoal,

582
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,192
it'll be on the side
of the tree, okay.

583
00:47:28,216 --> 00:47:31,418
So you can look up and you
can look around the tree,

584
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:34,788
sometimes it will be at
the roots as well, okay.

585
00:47:34,821 --> 00:47:35,821
Good luck.

586
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:54,268
Hello.

587
00:48:54,302 --> 00:48:57,071
Officer Bradley,
it's Michael Mercer,

588
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:58,205
Jack's old employer.

589
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:00,374
I, I ran the lab where,

590
00:49:00,408 --> 00:49:01,441
where he worked.

591
00:49:01,474 --> 00:49:03,377
Ah, hi, Dr. Mercer.

592
00:49:03,411 --> 00:49:05,212
I've heard great
things about you.

593
00:49:05,246 --> 00:49:06,147
Yeah, same to you.

594
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,249
Um, listen, thank you so much

595
00:49:08,282 --> 00:49:10,318
for looking into the
situation with the child.

596
00:49:10,351 --> 00:49:15,056
I, I just found a math test
with the boy's name on it.

597
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:18,059
Ah, his name is Jacob faulkner.

598
00:49:18,092 --> 00:49:21,362
F-a-u-l-k-n-e-r.

599
00:49:21,395 --> 00:49:23,697
Jacob faulkner?

600
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,532
I don't know if he
made up the name Elvis

601
00:49:25,565 --> 00:49:29,370
or if he just doesn't wanna
go by any other name, but-

602
00:49:29,403 --> 00:49:31,105
- Jacob faulkner.

603
00:49:31,138 --> 00:49:33,640
Yeah, or he just doesn't
wanna go home, yeah.

604
00:49:33,673 --> 00:49:35,343
I can look into it.

605
00:49:35,376 --> 00:49:36,676
Give me a day or two.

606
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,245
Yes, um, can you look into this?

607
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:39,846
I, I don't wanna...

608
00:49:40,747 --> 00:49:42,183
I wanna help the boy,

609
00:49:42,216 --> 00:49:44,294
but I also don't want his
family to be worried about him

610
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:45,652
and i'm,

611
00:49:45,685 --> 00:49:48,621
I'm just, I'm not
sure what to do here.

612
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:52,859
Is the situation
stable with the boy right now?

613
00:49:52,892 --> 00:49:54,328
Yes, no, no,

614
00:49:54,362 --> 00:49:55,938
he seems to be doing well,
all things considered.

615
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:57,264
Yeah, I can look into it.

616
00:49:57,298 --> 00:49:59,233
Well, thank you for
your help, officer,

617
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:01,435
I really appreciate it.

618
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:02,702
Happy to help out.

619
00:50:02,736 --> 00:50:04,238
I'll be in touch.

620
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:06,307
Have a great day.

621
00:50:11,379 --> 00:50:12,779
Hey.

622
00:50:12,812 --> 00:50:14,391
Hey, I left you those
mushrooms on the front porch,

623
00:50:14,415 --> 00:50:15,582
you can check them out later.

624
00:50:15,615 --> 00:50:17,451
Oh, great, yeah, I will.

625
00:50:17,485 --> 00:50:19,253
And maybe you can
make a career of this.

626
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:22,856
Yeah, it's relaxing
roaming the woods alone.

627
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:24,267
Did you come across
any black bears?

628
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:25,692
No, and I sure hope I don't.

629
00:50:25,725 --> 00:50:27,694
Have you ever come across any?

630
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:29,196
I have.

631
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,732
You just have to back away
slowly, they won't bother you.

632
00:50:32,766 --> 00:50:35,469
So this is what I want
from those mushrooms.

633
00:50:35,503 --> 00:50:37,570
It's ergosterol peroxide.

634
00:50:38,972 --> 00:50:41,275
It's a steroid derivative
that you can isolate.

635
00:50:41,308 --> 00:50:43,676
It keeps your immune system
from getting too active.

636
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,710
You see.

637
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,150
It looks like
hieroglyphics actually.

638
00:50:50,451 --> 00:50:52,086
Well, if you ever
take organic chemistry

639
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:53,397
you'll have fun working problems

640
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:56,856
where you move different
functional groups around

641
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:01,529
depending on various conditions
like heat or pressure.

642
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:03,563
If you're anything like I was.

643
00:51:03,596 --> 00:51:06,100
I used to throw my chemistry
books around on Saturday nights

644
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:07,334
and I'd scream.

645
00:51:09,203 --> 00:51:11,571
Well, that doesn't sound
like a good time at all.

646
00:51:11,604 --> 00:51:13,074
Hm.

647
00:51:13,107 --> 00:51:16,043
I used to have dreams about
reactions and wake up sweating.

648
00:51:16,077 --> 00:51:18,479
Then one day it just clicked.

649
00:51:19,979 --> 00:51:21,282
So why did you retire?

650
00:51:21,315 --> 00:51:23,616
You don't seem old enough.

651
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,752
Couldn't get any grants anymore.

652
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:27,421
I mean, the university
expected you

653
00:51:27,455 --> 00:51:29,423
to find these funding sources

654
00:51:29,457 --> 00:51:31,525
from all these different places.

655
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:33,027
And you know what?

656
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:37,398
If your grants expire and you
don't get others, that's it.

657
00:51:38,566 --> 00:51:39,775
You know, you have
to sell yourself out

658
00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:42,203
and study topics that
don't interest you.

659
00:51:42,236 --> 00:51:44,314
It's what the entities are
funding at any given time.

660
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:47,607
You know, I ended up feeling
like a used car salesman.

661
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,717
And science shouldn't
be like that.

662
00:51:48,741 --> 00:51:51,945
That's not why I got into it.

663
00:51:51,978 --> 00:51:53,380
Do you miss it?

664
00:51:53,414 --> 00:51:57,251
I miss it all the
time, I miss my students.

665
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,196
Well, you do have lab
up there in the mountains.

666
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:12,533
I mean, you're not that old,
you could always just go back.

667
00:52:12,566 --> 00:52:14,034
Yeah, who knows?

668
00:52:14,068 --> 00:52:16,437
Anyway, I'm gonna turn in
a little early tonight,

669
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:20,640
my old man bone aches are
heating up a little bit.

670
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:25,479
Hey, wait.

671
00:52:25,513 --> 00:52:27,248
You still owe me 20 bucks.

672
00:52:27,281 --> 00:52:28,715
For what?

673
00:52:28,748 --> 00:52:30,588
For those four chaga
chunks that I brought you.

674
00:52:30,618 --> 00:52:34,421
They look nasty, but they
sure make me a little bit.

675
00:52:34,455 --> 00:52:35,623
Okay.

676
00:52:35,655 --> 00:52:38,159
A deal is a deal,
yeah, 20 bucks it is.

677
00:52:50,271 --> 00:52:51,438
Hmm, thanks.

678
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:55,209
- Mr. Mercer?
- Yeah.

679
00:52:55,242 --> 00:52:57,645
I mean it, thank you.

680
00:52:57,677 --> 00:52:59,846
You're welcome.

681
00:53:03,317 --> 00:53:05,653
I'm just gonna lay down and
take a little rest for a bit.

682
00:53:05,685 --> 00:53:07,354
- I'll feel better.
- Mm-hm.

683
00:53:26,973 --> 00:53:27,973
Huh.

684
00:53:45,825 --> 00:53:46,825
Elvis?

685
00:53:56,503 --> 00:53:57,503
Elvis?

686
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:21,561
Elvis?

687
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:29,663
I trusted you.

688
00:55:30,531 --> 00:55:31,732
I trusted you.

689
00:57:52,372 --> 00:57:53,807
You stole my father's rings.

690
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:55,175
You called the police on me.

691
00:57:55,209 --> 00:57:56,677
I'm trying to help you.

692
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:58,221
I heard you talking to
that officer on the phone.

693
00:57:58,245 --> 00:57:59,622
You told him my
name and everything.

694
00:57:59,646 --> 00:58:00,447
I trusted you.

695
00:58:00,481 --> 00:58:01,782
I trusted you.

696
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:02,982
I don't care about the money,

697
00:58:03,016 --> 00:58:05,552
give me the goddamn
rings back kid.

698
00:58:07,521 --> 00:58:08,422
Good luck.

699
00:58:08,455 --> 00:58:10,624
Please, come on.

700
00:58:12,726 --> 00:58:14,370
I don't wanna go back
to another foster home.

701
00:58:14,394 --> 00:58:16,063
You were gonna have
them take me away.

702
00:58:16,096 --> 00:58:17,336
You lied to me about your name.

703
00:58:17,364 --> 00:58:18,499
No, I didn't lie.

704
00:58:18,532 --> 00:58:20,267
- Yes you did.
- My name is Jacob,

705
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,536
my dad just calls me Elvis.

706
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,048
If you're not gonna
take care of me,

707
00:58:25,072 --> 00:58:27,007
then at least
bring me to my dad.

708
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,776
He may be crazy,
but he loves me.

709
00:58:44,491 --> 00:58:45,491
Come on.

710
00:58:55,235 --> 00:58:56,235
Come on.

711
00:59:36,343 --> 00:59:37,945
Is this your house?

712
00:59:38,812 --> 00:59:40,213
It was.

713
00:59:42,983 --> 00:59:44,585
I'm sorry, Elvis.

714
00:59:46,186 --> 00:59:49,189
I wonder if daddy is dead.

715
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,662
We're gonna find out.

716
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:21,481
What are we doing here?

717
01:01:21,515 --> 01:01:23,550
We need to do something drastic.

718
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,519
What do you mean drastic?

719
01:01:25,552 --> 01:01:28,488
We're gonna buy some
chocolate ice cream.

720
01:01:28,522 --> 01:01:29,956
A lot of it.

721
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,200
We're gonna take that ice cream,

722
01:01:31,224 --> 01:01:33,860
I'm gonna drive to
the top of a mountain.

723
01:01:33,894 --> 01:01:36,830
And as we look down at
the world beneath us

724
01:01:36,863 --> 01:01:41,368
and we see those tiny dots
of rocks, creeks and trees,

725
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,938
we're gonna eat that ice cream.

726
01:01:44,971 --> 01:01:46,873
We're gonna eat it
until we can't move

727
01:01:46,907 --> 01:01:48,675
and they will have
to send a helicopter

728
01:01:48,709 --> 01:01:52,713
to airlift us out with our
big bellies out of the forest.

729
01:01:52,746 --> 01:01:54,614
We will hear the sounds
of the chopper blades

730
01:01:54,648 --> 01:01:58,418
as they fly through the
sky with god's breath

731
01:02:00,454 --> 01:02:02,389
on our chocolate covered faces.

732
01:02:02,422 --> 01:02:04,391
I thought you
didn't believe in god.

733
01:02:04,424 --> 01:02:08,729
I believe in god's breath
and chocolate ice cream.

734
01:02:15,069 --> 01:02:16,670
I hope my dad is okay.

735
01:02:16,703 --> 01:02:17,504
I hope so too.

736
01:02:17,537 --> 01:02:18,805
We'll find out.

737
01:02:19,973 --> 01:02:21,808
I'm sorry I took your
money and your rings.

738
01:02:21,842 --> 01:02:25,312
I don't care about the
money, the rings are important.

739
01:02:25,345 --> 01:02:26,346
Will you forgive me?

740
01:02:26,379 --> 01:02:27,614
Yep.

741
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:32,153
If my dad is dead will
you take care of me?

742
01:02:32,186 --> 01:02:34,855
Let's see if we
can find your daddy first.

743
01:02:34,888 --> 01:02:37,158
If we can't, will
you take care of me?

744
01:02:37,191 --> 01:02:39,860
I don't even know
if I'm qualified.

745
01:02:39,893 --> 01:02:41,461
What does that mean?

746
01:02:41,495 --> 01:02:43,064
Well, I told you before,

747
01:02:43,097 --> 01:02:45,432
I mean, I don't know
anything about kids.

748
01:02:45,465 --> 01:02:48,468
I had some college students,
but that's been a while.

749
01:02:48,502 --> 01:02:50,904
I probably wouldn't
be all that hard.

750
01:02:50,937 --> 01:02:54,041
I mean, if you know how to
make meals and don't do drugs,

751
01:02:54,075 --> 01:02:56,810
you're probably a better
guardian than I've ever had.

752
01:02:56,843 --> 01:02:59,713
Let's see if we
can find your daddy first.

753
01:02:59,746 --> 01:03:03,251
My daddy was going
crazy when I ran away.

754
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:05,253
He said the house was
filled with rival aliens

755
01:03:05,285 --> 01:03:08,889
who wanted to capture him and
take him back to some planet.

756
01:03:08,922 --> 01:03:10,390
I tried to hand
him his medicine,

757
01:03:10,423 --> 01:03:13,393
but he knocked it out of my
hand and said I was one of them.

758
01:03:13,426 --> 01:03:16,363
I got real scared and
ran into the woods.

759
01:03:16,396 --> 01:03:18,999
No kid should
have to deal with that.

760
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:20,033
Hmm.

761
01:03:21,535 --> 01:03:22,702
Psst.

762
01:03:22,736 --> 01:03:24,280
It's like my daddy isn't
my daddy sometimes,

763
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:27,307
like he's a monster in a bad
dream and I can't wake up.

764
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,309
Bad dreams are no
fun, that's for sure,

765
01:03:29,342 --> 01:03:32,746
especially when you can't
wake up or change anything.

766
01:03:32,779 --> 01:03:36,284
What kind of dreams do you have?

767
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:38,752
I dream about chemical reactions

768
01:03:38,785 --> 01:03:40,687
and old girlfriends
from decades ago,

769
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,656
you know, boring stuff.

770
01:03:44,258 --> 01:03:45,434
What kind of dreams do you have

771
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:49,429
about things you wanna
do with your life?

772
01:03:49,462 --> 01:03:51,531
You mean daydreams,
like aspirations?

773
01:03:51,565 --> 01:03:53,500
Yeah, that kind.

774
01:03:53,533 --> 01:03:54,768
I don't know.

775
01:03:56,037 --> 01:03:58,738
I've done everything
I had in mind.

776
01:03:58,772 --> 01:04:01,908
I presented scientific
findings around the world,

777
01:04:01,942 --> 01:04:05,912
I took my mom to easter
island before she died,

778
01:04:05,946 --> 01:04:07,547
I spent my life
moving science forward

779
01:04:07,581 --> 01:04:12,186
and now I guess I just wanna
feel less physical pain.

780
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,654
That's not a dream.

781
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:16,990
What do you daydream?

782
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:19,060
I told you, I wanna
build a bubble house

783
01:04:19,093 --> 01:04:21,394
like Wallace neff, but better.

784
01:04:21,428 --> 01:04:23,430
His bubble houses got
torn down after a while,

785
01:04:23,463 --> 01:04:25,299
so I want mine to
be indestructible.

786
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:28,269
Bubble houses won't even
be able to go through them.

787
01:04:28,302 --> 01:04:31,138
I also wanna plant a garden
with lots of potatoes,

788
01:04:31,172 --> 01:04:32,639
black-eyed Susans,

789
01:04:32,672 --> 01:04:33,874
everything you would need

790
01:04:33,907 --> 01:04:36,010
if things go horribly
wrong in the world.

791
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:38,288
What do you think is gonna
go horribly wrong in the world?

792
01:04:38,312 --> 01:04:42,849
I don't know, but I wanna
be ready, whatever it is.

793
01:04:42,883 --> 01:04:45,385
I like your idea of a
bubble house to protect you

794
01:04:45,418 --> 01:04:48,889
when things go
wrong in the world.

795
01:04:48,922 --> 01:04:50,533
You know, you could
come live there with me,

796
01:04:50,557 --> 01:04:52,859
you could be old and
need some shelter.

797
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:56,163
I appreciate the invitation.

798
01:04:57,831 --> 01:04:59,300
You...

799
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:01,577
We could have a laboratory to
make your mushroom medicine.

800
01:05:01,601 --> 01:05:03,837
I'd have to teach
you how to make everything.

801
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:06,606
That's fine, I don't
mind learning how.

802
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,807
We could have...

803
01:05:07,841 --> 01:05:08,951
We could be two
mushroom scientists

804
01:05:08,975 --> 01:05:10,710
living in a bubble house.

805
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:12,079
Or a mushroom house.

806
01:05:12,113 --> 01:05:14,015
Like that book
you're reading me?

807
01:05:14,048 --> 01:05:16,150
Yeah, that you swiped.

808
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:17,851
I'll give it back.

809
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:23,790
You know, if my daddy
is dead, I will be sad,

810
01:05:23,823 --> 01:05:25,393
but I'll also be
a little relieved

811
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:26,893
because then I
could live with you

812
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:31,464
and I wouldn't be so worried
all the time about everything.

813
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:34,935
I will love him, I
will always love him,

814
01:05:34,968 --> 01:05:39,606
but being worried all
the time is not much fun.

815
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:42,876
I used to worry about
my dad all the time too.

816
01:05:42,909 --> 01:05:44,878
He used to cough all
night most nights.

817
01:05:44,911 --> 01:05:46,347
Can we go home?

818
01:05:47,647 --> 01:05:48,647
Yeah.

819
01:05:59,926 --> 01:06:01,828
I think I had too much.

820
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:05,632
Well, you can have some more.

821
01:06:05,665 --> 01:06:06,665
No, done.

822
01:06:12,273 --> 01:06:14,041
Just give me a minute.

823
01:06:16,444 --> 01:06:17,411
Hello.

824
01:06:17,445 --> 01:06:18,578
Dr. Mercer.

825
01:06:18,611 --> 01:06:19,779
Yes.

826
01:06:19,813 --> 01:06:21,115
This is officer Bradley.

827
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:22,350
Hi officer.

828
01:06:22,383 --> 01:06:23,659
So I have
some information for you

829
01:06:23,683 --> 01:06:25,286
on Jacob faulkner.

830
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:26,753
Please go ahead.

831
01:06:26,786 --> 01:06:29,656
Jacob faulkner
is the son of Davis faulkner,

832
01:06:29,689 --> 01:06:32,859
originally from
wheeling, West Virginia.

833
01:06:32,892 --> 01:06:35,296
The father is a 34 year old man

834
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:37,964
and he's been in and out
of mental institutions

835
01:06:37,998 --> 01:06:40,167
for the last 15 years.

836
01:06:40,201 --> 01:06:42,370
He's now in the west
Virginia state hospital

837
01:06:42,403 --> 01:06:44,138
after burning down their house

838
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:46,539
on west sycamore two weeks ago.

839
01:06:46,573 --> 01:06:49,642
Jacob was presumed to be dead.

840
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:53,447
So I'm relieved to find
out that's not the case.

841
01:06:53,481 --> 01:06:55,149
He's safe at the moment.

842
01:06:55,182 --> 01:06:56,750
I'm so glad to hear it.

843
01:06:56,783 --> 01:06:58,252
You can bring the
boy into custody

844
01:06:58,285 --> 01:07:02,056
and we'll work with child
services to find him a home.

845
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:04,425
The child's mother died
during his childbirth

846
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:08,828
and there are no relatives that
don't have criminal records.

847
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:11,265
Is there any way I could
foster the boy for now?

848
01:07:11,298 --> 01:07:12,199
That's awful kind of you

849
01:07:12,233 --> 01:07:13,467
to wanna help that child.

850
01:07:13,501 --> 01:07:16,470
Sounds like it's been
a hard life for him.

851
01:07:16,504 --> 01:07:18,705
I'll need to send an
officer there as well.

852
01:07:18,738 --> 01:07:19,639
I understand.

853
01:07:19,672 --> 01:07:21,108
Can we start that process?

854
01:07:21,142 --> 01:07:22,609
Is the boy close by

855
01:07:22,642 --> 01:07:25,112
so that I could speak with
him to put it in my report?

856
01:07:25,146 --> 01:07:26,013
Yes, he's a...

857
01:07:26,047 --> 01:07:27,814
He's right next to me.

858
01:07:27,847 --> 01:07:28,847
Elvis?

859
01:07:34,121 --> 01:07:34,921
Hello.

860
01:07:34,954 --> 01:07:37,124
Jacob?

861
01:07:37,158 --> 01:07:38,325
Yes, sir.

862
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:39,726
So your father is okay,

863
01:07:39,759 --> 01:07:41,561
but he's in the
hospital right now.

864
01:07:41,594 --> 01:07:42,962
He's sick.

865
01:07:42,996 --> 01:07:44,498
He's sick a lot.

866
01:07:45,698 --> 01:07:47,667
We're glad you're okay.

867
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:51,272
Do you wanna stay with
Dr. Mercer right now?

868
01:07:51,305 --> 01:07:52,772
I would like that.

869
01:07:52,806 --> 01:07:54,583
We will need to
send someone to speak with you

870
01:07:54,607 --> 01:07:56,810
and visit Dr. Mercer's home.

871
01:07:56,843 --> 01:07:58,812
We will need to fill
out some paperwork

872
01:07:58,845 --> 01:08:01,082
while we sort things
out, there is a process.

873
01:08:01,115 --> 01:08:03,350
Yeah, I understand.

874
01:08:03,384 --> 01:08:04,584
Okay.

875
01:08:04,617 --> 01:08:07,488
What school do you go to?

876
01:08:07,521 --> 01:08:08,721
Lincoln heights elementary,

877
01:08:08,755 --> 01:08:11,225
I haven't been in
for a while though.

878
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:12,393
Okay.

879
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:14,694
Thank you for
sharing that with me.

880
01:08:14,727 --> 01:08:16,330
We'll figure out
what to do next.

881
01:08:16,363 --> 01:08:17,764
Go get some ice cream.

882
01:08:17,797 --> 01:08:19,133
I already did.

883
01:08:20,867 --> 01:08:22,369
Thank you for your help officer.

884
01:08:22,403 --> 01:08:23,404
Anytime.

885
01:08:23,437 --> 01:08:26,407
We will be reaching out shortly.

886
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,740
Let's go.

887
01:08:53,367 --> 01:08:55,569
What's that you're drinking?

888
01:08:55,603 --> 01:08:59,106
Phellinus linteus
and inonotus obliquus.

889
01:09:00,241 --> 01:09:01,741
Is that doing anything for you?

890
01:09:01,774 --> 01:09:02,774
Be honest.

891
01:09:03,676 --> 01:09:05,579
Hm, I don't know.

892
01:09:05,613 --> 01:09:06,655
My knee is feeling
a little better

893
01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:09,316
but my eyes are acting up.

894
01:09:10,451 --> 01:09:12,386
What do you mean?

895
01:09:12,419 --> 01:09:14,787
My immune system attacks
whatever it wants sometimes

896
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:18,192
and I get this thing
called uveitis,

897
01:09:18,225 --> 01:09:21,562
when parts of your
eyes get blurred and

898
01:09:24,298 --> 01:09:25,732
inflamed.

899
01:09:25,765 --> 01:09:27,010
You know, sunlight
gives me a headache,

900
01:09:27,034 --> 01:09:28,469
and I can't read.

901
01:09:29,869 --> 01:09:31,738
It's a lot of fun.

902
01:09:31,771 --> 01:09:36,143
Sorry I've caused you
so much stress, you know.

903
01:09:36,177 --> 01:09:38,579
It's not your fault kid.

904
01:09:38,612 --> 01:09:42,550
I used to get stressed out
when I had a Grant due.

905
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:43,617
You know what?

906
01:09:43,651 --> 01:09:45,019
Coping with stress

907
01:09:45,052 --> 01:09:46,997
is probably one of the
hardest things to do in life.

908
01:09:47,021 --> 01:09:50,723
Some people, they
go right through it,

909
01:09:50,757 --> 01:09:51,757
but not me.

910
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:54,794
My body has a huge tantrum.

911
01:09:56,729 --> 01:09:59,633
I'm just not that good at it.

912
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:01,502
But I'm gonna take a little rest

913
01:10:01,535 --> 01:10:03,537
then I'm gonna
feel a lot better.

914
01:10:03,571 --> 01:10:07,774
Help yourself to
whatever you want, okay.

915
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:26,313
Mr. Mercer,

916
01:12:26,347 --> 01:12:28,382
here's some water.

917
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,484
I'm not feeling good, Elvis,

918
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:32,228
could you get the juice
from the refrigerator?

919
01:12:32,252 --> 01:12:33,953
That stuff's not helping you.

920
01:12:33,986 --> 01:12:35,922
You need real medicine.

921
01:12:39,827 --> 01:12:40,993
Come on, take.

922
01:12:42,563 --> 01:12:45,733
Your mushroom juice
isn't helping you.

923
01:12:57,311 --> 01:12:59,480
See, it wasn't that hard.

924
01:12:59,513 --> 01:13:02,316
Gonna feel a lot better now.

925
01:13:02,349 --> 01:13:04,051
You're a good kid,
you know that, Elvis?

926
01:13:04,084 --> 01:13:07,121
Yeah, someone's gotta
keep you in shape.

927
01:13:07,154 --> 01:13:08,655
Okay kid.

928
01:13:08,689 --> 01:13:09,922
All right, rest up a little

929
01:13:09,956 --> 01:13:12,326
and that should
kick in in a bit.

930
01:13:36,183 --> 01:13:38,194
See, this is the third day
you've been taking your medicine

931
01:13:38,218 --> 01:13:40,287
and you're already
looking a lot better.

932
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,922
Hmm, thanks for taking
care of me, Elvis.

933
01:13:42,955 --> 01:13:46,326
Well, someone has to
keep you in check, anyway.

934
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,796
Listen, you need to
go to the doctor.

935
01:13:48,829 --> 01:13:51,931
There we can get you
a real prescription.

936
01:13:51,964 --> 01:13:53,434
Mm-mm.

937
01:13:53,467 --> 01:13:57,471
Okay, if you go to the
doctor, I'll go to school.

938
01:13:59,006 --> 01:13:59,907
Really?

939
01:13:59,939 --> 01:14:02,075
Yeah, but you have to go.

940
01:14:04,611 --> 01:14:05,611
Okay,

941
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,480
deal.

942
01:14:08,382 --> 01:14:09,917
All right.

943
01:14:09,949 --> 01:14:11,518
Have a nice dinner.

944
01:14:49,289 --> 01:14:50,424
You know, I'm no expert,

945
01:14:50,457 --> 01:14:52,192
but you need to try new things.

946
01:14:52,226 --> 01:14:54,294
You're a walking contradiction.

947
01:14:54,328 --> 01:14:56,129
What do you mean?

948
01:14:56,163 --> 01:14:57,498
You say you believe in science,

949
01:14:57,531 --> 01:14:58,966
but you don't like doctors.

950
01:14:58,998 --> 01:15:00,834
Doctors believe in science.

951
01:15:00,868 --> 01:15:02,946
You say that you're not good
with kids, but as it turns out,

952
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:04,838
you're actually
pretty good with kids.

953
01:15:04,872 --> 01:15:05,973
Well, n of 1.

954
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:07,441
Fine, n of 1.

955
01:15:07,474 --> 01:15:08,375
But listen to me,

956
01:15:08,408 --> 01:15:09,877
there's sun over your head,

957
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,921
that sun is gonna go past your
face, past your messy hair,

958
01:15:11,945 --> 01:15:13,547
and enter deep into your bones.

959
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:14,748
It's gonna warm you up

960
01:15:14,781 --> 01:15:17,050
and stop you to be
such a stubborn troll.

961
01:15:17,084 --> 01:15:21,622
You're the worst wizard in
the state of West Virginia.

962
01:15:22,856 --> 01:15:24,191
Maybe that sun can warm you up

963
01:15:24,224 --> 01:15:25,659
and get you to stop stealing.

964
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:26,793
Quiet.

965
01:15:26,827 --> 01:15:28,762
Listen, sun over your head.

966
01:15:28,795 --> 01:15:30,197
Now lie down.

967
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:33,433
It's gonna give you the
strength to go to the doctor.

968
01:15:33,467 --> 01:15:34,902
It's a beautiful day outside.

969
01:15:34,935 --> 01:15:38,539
Birds are singing and
flowers are blooming.

970
01:15:50,417 --> 01:15:53,420
You know, it's okay to be
afraid to go in to the doctor.

971
01:15:53,453 --> 01:15:57,524
I guess I'm just afraid
of what they might tell me.

972
01:15:57,558 --> 01:15:59,626
Well, what I try to
do is make myself okay

973
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:01,895
with the worst thing
that can possibly happen,

974
01:16:01,929 --> 01:16:04,698
then the thing that's going
to happen doesn't seem as bad,

975
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:06,333
like my dad being dead.

976
01:16:06,366 --> 01:16:07,601
If I can be okay with that,

977
01:16:07,634 --> 01:16:09,836
then the worst thing
doesn't seem as bad.

978
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:12,272
What's the worst thing
that they can tell you?

979
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:13,774
I guess that I'm gonna die.

980
01:16:13,807 --> 01:16:15,652
If anything, the doctor's
going to stop you from dying

981
01:16:15,676 --> 01:16:16,676
so quickly.

982
01:16:18,178 --> 01:16:20,914
We're all going
to die, you know.

983
01:16:52,312 --> 01:16:53,547
So what's the verdict?

984
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:54,857
That you're gonna
die anytime soon?

985
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:55,881
Nope.

986
01:16:57,317 --> 01:17:00,687
Hm, did they tell you
anything ground-breaking?

987
01:17:00,721 --> 01:17:05,125
Just told me to take my
meds and gave me a checkup.

988
01:17:06,326 --> 01:17:09,663
See, I told you it
wouldn't be so bad.

989
01:17:09,696 --> 01:17:12,399
Aren't you glad you went?

990
01:17:12,432 --> 01:17:13,500
I think so.

991
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:17,237
Well, since a deal's a deal,

992
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:20,240
I wanna start going
back to school.

993
01:17:20,273 --> 01:17:22,943
Do you think you can
get me there every day?

994
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:25,879
Absolutely, I'd be happy to
take you to school every day.

995
01:17:25,912 --> 01:17:27,814
I was glad you wouldn't mind.

996
01:17:27,848 --> 01:17:31,418
Anyway, since my dad
burned down our house,

997
01:17:32,285 --> 01:17:33,520
I don't have...

998
01:17:34,688 --> 01:17:36,990
I don't think I'll be
seeing him for a while.

999
01:17:37,025 --> 01:17:39,693
You might be right about that.

1000
01:17:40,727 --> 01:17:42,996
Well, do you wanna go fishing?

1001
01:17:43,031 --> 01:17:44,031
When?

1002
01:17:44,798 --> 01:17:45,999
Right now.

1003
01:17:46,034 --> 01:17:48,535
You don't seem beat up
like you did before.

1004
01:17:48,568 --> 01:17:49,903
Sure, we just,

1005
01:17:51,105 --> 01:17:53,874
we just have to grab
the Poles from home.

1006
01:17:53,907 --> 01:17:54,808
I'm fine with that.

1007
01:17:54,841 --> 01:17:57,344
You got anywhere else to be?

1008
01:17:57,377 --> 01:17:59,013
Nope.

1009
01:17:59,047 --> 01:18:02,150
I have absolutely nowhere else
to be except being with you.

1010
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:05,086
Perfect, that makes two of us.

1011
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:09,189
Mr. Mercer, come
get your prescription.

1012
01:18:12,759 --> 01:18:13,860
Okay, that's enough.

1013
01:18:13,894 --> 01:18:15,362
Elvis, that's enough.

1014
01:18:16,763 --> 01:18:18,132
And reel it in a little bit.

1015
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:19,199
Hook.

1016
01:18:19,232 --> 01:18:20,600
I will.

1017
01:18:20,634 --> 01:18:22,636
- I'm bad at this.
- Okay, you take this one.

1018
01:18:22,669 --> 01:18:24,004
This one's already set.

1019
01:18:24,038 --> 01:18:24,971
It's already in the water.

1020
01:18:25,006 --> 01:18:27,407
- Just hold it.
- Hold it? Okay.

1021
01:18:31,712 --> 01:18:33,447
Put your finger here like this

1022
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,084
and then put it back like that.

1023
01:18:38,418 --> 01:18:39,720
That's it, good.

1024
01:18:39,753 --> 01:18:40,854
Just hold it.

1025
01:18:45,692 --> 01:18:48,062
The castle goes on the ends,

1026
01:18:48,096 --> 01:18:49,396
- like this, okay.
- Mm-hm.

1027
01:18:49,429 --> 01:18:52,833
So you put your
castle on the ends.

1028
01:18:52,866 --> 01:18:54,668
That's it, okay.

1029
01:18:54,701 --> 01:18:58,472
And the knight, your
knight, the horse, okay,

1030
01:18:59,673 --> 01:19:01,241
goes on the next square.

1031
01:19:01,274 --> 01:19:05,179
And then you have your bishop
that goes on the next square,

1032
01:19:05,213 --> 01:19:06,213
okay.

1033
01:19:07,215 --> 01:19:10,517
And then you do queen
on own color, okay.

1034
01:19:11,551 --> 01:19:13,320
- This is the queen-
- okay.

1035
01:19:13,353 --> 01:19:15,822
And the king, okay.

1036
01:19:15,856 --> 01:19:17,657
So this is the queen?

1037
01:19:17,691 --> 01:19:18,868
That's the queen, that's right.

1038
01:19:18,892 --> 01:19:21,762
The king is the tallest piece.

1039
01:19:21,795 --> 01:19:23,663
Technically they're
almost the same size.

1040
01:19:23,697 --> 01:19:24,865
And these are called pawns,

1041
01:19:24,898 --> 01:19:28,069
and you just put
those in front, okay.

1042
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:26,426
Dear daddy,

1043
01:20:26,459 --> 01:20:28,428
I know that you are
still in the hospital.

1044
01:20:28,461 --> 01:20:29,763
The nice policeman told me

1045
01:20:29,796 --> 01:20:32,200
that you burned down our
house on west sycamore.

1046
01:20:32,233 --> 01:20:35,569
I actually drove by it and
saw it with my own two eyes.

1047
01:20:35,602 --> 01:20:36,803
It was burned to the ground,

1048
01:20:36,837 --> 01:20:38,614
but I know you must've
had a real good reason,

1049
01:20:38,638 --> 01:20:40,774
like those creatures
coming for us.

1050
01:20:40,807 --> 01:20:42,310
You must've been so scared

1051
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:44,377
and I feel bad for having
left you alone with them.

1052
01:20:44,411 --> 01:20:47,380
I hope you can
forgive me one day.

1053
01:20:47,414 --> 01:20:48,882
They said that they don't think

1054
01:20:48,915 --> 01:20:51,484
that you will be getting out
of there for a long time.

1055
01:20:51,518 --> 01:20:54,055
I do think that they will take
real good care of you though,

1056
01:20:54,088 --> 01:20:55,889
and that's what you deserve.

1057
01:20:55,922 --> 01:20:58,092
As for me, I'm doing pretty well

1058
01:20:58,125 --> 01:21:01,428
considering how much has
happened in the last year.

1059
01:21:01,461 --> 01:21:04,464
I ended up finding this retired
botanist in the mountains,

1060
01:21:04,497 --> 01:21:06,466
and he was nice
enough to take me in.

1061
01:21:06,499 --> 01:21:09,603
He studies mushrooms,
isn't that funny?

1062
01:21:09,636 --> 01:21:10,876
He gathers them from the forest

1063
01:21:10,904 --> 01:21:12,772
and then brings them
back to his house.

1064
01:21:12,806 --> 01:21:15,876
He used to do lots of
his experiments with them

1065
01:21:15,909 --> 01:21:18,045
and that's what he's
teaching me about now.

1066
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:20,547
I'm learning all about science.

1067
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:23,284
At school, they even put me
in gifted and talented class,

1068
01:21:23,317 --> 01:21:24,951
isn't that hard to believe?

1069
01:21:24,985 --> 01:21:27,787
Remember how I was
always so slow before?

1070
01:21:27,821 --> 01:21:30,057
I couldn't even read
very well back then.

1071
01:21:30,091 --> 01:21:33,927
I'm getting a lot better
though, daddy, a lot better.

1072
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,930
Anyway, Mr. Mercer takes
me to school every day

1073
01:21:36,963 --> 01:21:38,765
and picks me up afterwards.

1074
01:21:38,798 --> 01:21:40,967
He says, he's going to
get me a volunteering job

1075
01:21:41,001 --> 01:21:42,036
at a science laboratory

1076
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:44,272
when I get a little older.

1077
01:21:44,305 --> 01:21:47,574
Maybe I will even go
to college one day.

1078
01:21:47,607 --> 01:21:50,543
Mr. Mercer is also working
on the papers to adopt me.

1079
01:21:50,577 --> 01:21:52,445
He's almost finished
with the process,

1080
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:53,747
but I just want you to know

1081
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:55,682
nobody could ever
take your place.

1082
01:21:55,715 --> 01:21:57,651
You may be sick, but you're
my one and only daddy

1083
01:21:57,684 --> 01:22:00,021
and I will always love
you no matter what.

1084
01:22:00,054 --> 01:22:01,788
I just want you to know that.

1085
01:22:01,821 --> 01:22:04,091
Oh, also, by the
way, guess what?

1086
01:22:04,125 --> 01:22:06,093
We are building a
bubble house, daddy.

1087
01:22:06,127 --> 01:22:08,561
Remember how you and I talked
about that a few times?

1088
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:09,739
Those houses that
would keep us safe

1089
01:22:09,763 --> 01:22:11,831
from hurricanes and aliens?

1090
01:22:11,865 --> 01:22:15,602
Well, Mr. Mercer and I are
actually making one ourselves.

1091
01:22:15,635 --> 01:22:18,205
He calls it a mushroom house
but I call it a bubble house.

1092
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,141
When it's all done, we
are going to move into it

1093
01:22:20,174 --> 01:22:22,043
and live there forever.

1094
01:22:22,076 --> 01:22:24,078
It'll even be big enough
for you to come stay

1095
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:26,080
if you ever get out
of the hospital.

1096
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:29,616
I also want you to
know, daddy, I am okay.

1097
01:22:29,649 --> 01:22:32,420
Everything's going to be
just fine for you and me.

1098
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:35,122
Hope they are letting you play
your guitar in the hospital.

1099
01:22:35,156 --> 01:22:37,158
I'm sure the other people
they would like it.

1100
01:22:37,191 --> 01:22:40,627
Also, both me and mama are
there with you in spirit.

1101
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:42,063
Much love, Elvis.

1102
01:25:34,968 --> 01:25:37,003
Do you think they will let us

1103
01:25:37,037 --> 01:25:38,638
bring a cake into the hospital?

1104
01:25:39,806 --> 01:25:43,444
Not sure, but
it can't hurt to try.
