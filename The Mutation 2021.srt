(light eerie music)

10
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,583
- You know I'm
worried about you.

11
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,792
You barely eat, I hardly see you

12
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:28,500
when you aren't in
that room working.

13
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,000
- I'm fine, all right?

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,958
Look, I'm sorry if I've
come across distant

15
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,792
or whatnot lately, but
I feel like I'm really

16
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:36,250
getting somewhere
with this work.

17
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,500
I don't wanna stop, not now.

18
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:40,708
I am so close.

00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:49,792

(phone ringing)

21
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,750
- Dr. Linda Rowe.

22
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:02,542
Yes.

23
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,000
Right.

24
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,042
Okay, sure.

25
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:10,958
No problem.

26
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,208
See you there.

27
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:16,750
I gotta go.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,333
Shouldn't take more
than a couple hours.

29
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,083
- I didn't realize
you were on call.

30
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,292
- [Linda] Don't wait up.

31

- Oh, Christ.

42
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:08,625
How did you get out?

43
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,625
(mutant growling)

44
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,167
No, come on now.

45
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:18,457
You see?

46
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:22,707
There's nothing to worry about.

47
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:23,625
No harm.

48
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,707
(mutant grunting)

49
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,292

(dramatic music)

63
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:32,292
- You sure you don't
want me to help you out?

64
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:35,082
- I've got it, thank you.

65
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:37,957
- You know, Jenna, you
don't have to leave so soon.

66
00:05:37,957 --> 00:05:41,667
I could, I could setup the
guest bedroom and we could-

67
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:42,667
- We can what?

68
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,917
Go back to being happy families?

69
00:05:46,082 --> 00:05:48,750
- Things don't have to
be like this, Jenna.

70
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,957
- I'm sorry, all right, I am.

71
00:05:49,957 --> 00:05:52,292
But I'm not sorry
for what I did.

72
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:53,957
- [Alan] All right,
stop, stop, just-

73
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:56,500
- Some people just aren't
destined for one another.

74
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:03,375
- Look, I agree, but without
giving something a proper go,

75
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,125
I mean we can't, we
can't really comment

76
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,000
that on our relationship.

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,333
- We did give it a go, Alan.

78
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,375
One hell of a go.

79
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,167
We just aren't right
for each other.

80
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,792
Look, I'm gonna load up the car.

81
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,042
I'll be back for the rest
of my stuff tomorrow.

82
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:25,542
(door thudding)

83
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:28,582
(gravel crunching)

84
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:39,582
(car doors slamming)

85
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:42,625
- You okay?

86
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,375
- What, oh, I'm sorry.

87
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:49,792
I didn't exactly get
much sleep last night.

88
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,292
- Yeah, I can see that.

89
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,832
Do you wanna go home?

90
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:56,250
You still have that
holiday you barely used.

91
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,917
- No, no, no, I could,

92
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:01,833
I could use the
distraction if I'm honest.

93
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,708
- The wife?

94
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,250
- Ex-wife.

95
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,625
I guess I should get
used to saying that.

96
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,833
- Is she really
backing out on you?

97
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,708
- Says we're not meant to be.

98
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,875
Which is probably
partially true,

99
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:20,625
but I don't know how she got
to that conclusion so fast

100
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,000
'cause everything was
fine until I found out.

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,332
And then, bam.

102
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:28,000
Her mind was all made up.

103
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:31,250
- Yeah, well, how
fine can you really be

104
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,167
if she was playing
those games, huh?

105
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:36,125
Anyway, this might distract you.

106
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:42,000
- Hello, Marsh.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,542
They're waiting over there.

108
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:48,792
(light eerie music)

109
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:01,708
- Oh, Captain Norton.

110
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,083
This is zoologist Alan Marsh

111
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,583
and his assistant, Julie Larkin.

112
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,083
- We got body, male.

113
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,875
Wife arrived home early in
the morning and found him.

114
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,208
Claims she was at work.

115
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,333
Claims she doesn't
know what coulda

116
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,750
done this to her husband.

117
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,042
- What do you mean
what coulda done this?

118
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:20,582
- Well, we're not really
sure, but we don't think

119
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:22,707
this murder was committed
by another human.

120
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:26,917
- So, what are you
saying did this?

121
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,875
- We don't know.

122
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,542
That's what we're hoping
you can help us with.

123
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:33,832
McKenna, would you mind?

124
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:36,375
- Miss Larkin, Marsh,
hi, thanks for coming.

125
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,332
Sorry to throw you both
in the deep end like this,

126
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:41,082
but we need an opinion.

127
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:42,207
Come with me.
- Sure.

128
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:55,917
(suspenseful music)

129
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,208
- Jesus Christ.

130
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,500
- Chambers, take
Miss Larkin outside

131
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,917
for some fresh air, will you?

132
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,583
- What are you thinking
coulda done this?

133
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:24,500
- A bear?

134
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:27,292
A big wild cat?

135
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,250
Christ knows.

136
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,958
- A bear so close
to the city, no.

137
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,167
And this attack
happened indoors,

138
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,000
that would be very
outta character.

139
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,833
Big cats don't really
come near humans

140
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,458
unless they feel threatened, so.

141
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:57,167
Oh, God, no, this was
something completely different.

142
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,583
- Do you have any idea
what might've done this?

143
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:05,125
- I'll need to take some samples

144
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,708
if that's okay with you boys.

145
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,875
- Do what needs to be done.

146
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,125
McKenna'll stay with ya.

147
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,333
- Appreciate it.

148
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,708
(light dramatic music)

149
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,542
- You essentially listen.
- Uh huh.

150
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,667
- We'll do all the talking.

151
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,875
Just make a mental
note of anything

152
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,792
she says that might
spark a thought.

153
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,250
Has she seen any wild
animals in the area recently

154
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,083
or any idea what
might've done this.

155
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,083
All right?

156
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,292
- Yeah, I gotcha.
(sirens wailing)

157
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,708
(somber music)

158
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,458
- Dr. Linda Rowe, I'm
Captain Edwardo Norton.

159
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,667
This is Detective James McKenna.

160
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,917
And with us today, we also
have specialist zoologist,

161
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:21,750
Alan Marsh, who's helping
us with the investigation.

162
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,875
- Hi.

163
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,375
- Thank you for waiting here.

164
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:30,375
I wish we were meeting under
better circumstances, Dr. Rowe.

165
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,542
How are you holding up?

166
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,375
- Call me Linda.

167
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,833
- Okay, Linda, we're gonna
have to ask you some questions.

168
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,875
Are you ready and
comfortable to begin?

169
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:42,875
- Sure.

170
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,792
- I have written down
here you arrived home

171
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:48,833
in the early hours
of the morning.

172
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,250
- I'm a doctor, I was on call.

173
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:58,250
Usually I don't get called
out, but last night I was.

174
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:00,833
- That was lucky for you.

175
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:04,750
- Excuse him.

176
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,750
So, can you tell me what
happened when you arrived home.

177
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:17,125
- I got home, everything
seemed normal.

178
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:25,917
I walked in and I knew
something was off.

179
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,583
The lights had been left
on and he never did that.

180
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:40,208
He was a in bed by
midnight kinda guy,

181
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:44,167
and he wouldn't leave the
lights on while sleeping.

182
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,750
- Was there anything
strange outside

183
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,958
the house before you went in?

184
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:49,833
- Nothing.

185
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,708
That was what was so strange.

186
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,375
I froze.

187
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,958
(Linda sneezes)

188
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,583
I had to get them to check it

189
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,625
was actually him
because I couldn't

190
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,792
believe he's really gone.

191
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:21,583
(Linda crying)

192
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:30,208
(Linda sneezes)

193
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:36,417
Thank you.

194
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,333
- Marsh here is gonna
take some samples

195
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,958
from your clothing, Dr. Rowe.

196
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,333
You okay with that?

197
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,292
- Sure.

198
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,167
- Here's my card.

199
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,667
Don't be afraid to just call me

200
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:00,583
if you can think
of anything, okay?

201
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,958
(light dramatic music)

202
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,667
- What are you thinking?

203
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:30,292
- She's clearly in shock.

204
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:33,208
Whatever was in the
house she has no clue.

205
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,000
But she's clearly had
some kinda reaction to it.

206
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,417
- What do you mean?

207
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,250
- Well, she was
sneezing profusely.

208
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,042
And she hasn't washed since
discovering her husband,

209
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:46,542
so I'm guessing whatever it
was has rubbed off on her skin,

210
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,583
her hair, and most
likely her clothing.

211
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,333
So, I'll get the
swabs off to the lab

212
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,583
and let you boys know asap
exactly what's going on.

213
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,042
I'm assuming you're gonna
ask her for clothing too?

214
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:59,042
- We'll be taking swabs and
a lamination from the prints.

215
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,042
- I'm not sure everything
she's revealing

216
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:04,208
is the entire truth.

217
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,750
- Why do you say that?
- The files of her husband,

218
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,625
they was all tampered
with or gone missing.

219
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,625
She's hiding something.

220
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,292
(ominous music)

221
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,167
- These fucking heels.

222
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:39,917
(trash thudding)

223
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:45,125
(rats squeaking)
(suspenseful music)

224
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,417
(woman gasps)

225
00:15:58,417 --> 00:15:59,375
Just a rat.

226
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,750
(eerie music)

227
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,792
(mutant growling)

228
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,875
(suspenseful music)

229
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:32,125
(trash bin rattling)

230
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:36,917
(heel snapping)
(woman groaning)

231
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:42,042
(mutant growling)
(woman groaning)

232
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:47,917
(mutant shrieking)
(woman coughing)

233
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:50,750
(woman gasping)

234
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,000
(mutant shrieking)

235
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,208
(woman groaning)
(metal clanking)

236
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,541
(mutant growling)

237
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,208
(suspenseful music)

238
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,500
(woman gasps)

239
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,458
(mutant grunting)
(flesh squishing)

240
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,500
(woman groaning)

241
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,458
(woman screaming)

242
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,333
(phone buzzing)

243
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,541
- Alan speaking.

244
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:32,208
- [Linda] Hi, it's
Linda, Dr. Rowe.

245
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,375
I hope you don't mind,
I got your number

246
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,583
from the officer or
Detective McKenna.

247
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:42,000
I found something that you
might wanna take a look at.

248
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,667
Do you mind coming over?

249
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,833
(Alan sighs)

250
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:55,083
(light switch clicking)

251
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,083
(door thudding)

252
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,458
- [Alan] God damn.

253
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,792
- I'm sorry for calling
so out of the blue.

254
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:17,292
I was just in this
big old house alone.

255
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,833
- Why didn't you ask the
officers to come with you?

256
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,958
- What, Captain Norton
and Detective McKenna?

257
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,667
Not exactly the
comforting type, are they?

258
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:34,792
- No, I suppose not.

259
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,583
- Anyway, when I came back

260
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:43,208
I started looking around
and I found these.

261
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:51,792
You know they think
I was in on it.

262
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,042
I can sense it.

263
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,833
The way they worded their
questions towards me.

264
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,208
I found these in the workspace.

265
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,083
I was never allowed
in here before.

266
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,958
I found them in
there stashed away.

267
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:21,042
- You know, you should
be showing these to
the cops, not me.

268
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,375
- I wanted a second opinion.

269
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,792
Before I take this further.

270
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,542
- This paper looks new.

271
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,875
So you seriously had no idea

272
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,875
what he was up to
here in his lab?

273
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,292
- I knew he was
trialing some drugs.

274
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:53,250
After he got made redundant,
he really believed in the work

275
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,625
he was doing and he didn't
wanna give up on it.

276
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:00,667
He had the money to
get by month-by-month

277
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:05,333
and it was something he
was so passionate about.

278
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,792
I thought, what
the hell, you know?

279
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,208
As long as we can pay the bills.

280
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,708
- These uh, these packets
here on the table,

281
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:21,583
he's mixing medicines.

282
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:29,125
Growth hormone, 19-Nor-5,
androstenedione, Dianabol,

283
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:37,333
and uranium isotopes.

284
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,333
- Sorry, I get the first part.

285
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,792
Uranium what?
- It's uranium-235.

286
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,333
- So, it's radioactive?

287
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,125
- You never asked him specifics?

288
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:54,708
(Linda sighs)
Geez.

289
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,042
- I let him tell me what
he wanted to tell me.

290
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,417
I knew he tested on
generics in here,

291
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:04,042
you know, mice, rats, rabbits.

292
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:09,250
He was trialing a
drug which hopefully

293
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,750
some of these papers can
shed some light onto.

294
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,042
- You didn't know your
husband so well, huh?

295
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:20,333
- You only know what
people will let you see.

296
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,167
(fire crackling)

297
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:31,458
(light dramatic music)

298
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,250
I should ask before pouring.

299
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,542
Gin?

300
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:48,875
- I'll take it straight.

301
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:56,000
This your mom?

302
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,917
- Yeah.

303
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,417
Yeah, that's my mom
a few years back.

304
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,292
- You know, you
got the same eyes.

305
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,208
- Thank you.

306
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,042
People used to say that.

307
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,250
- I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

308
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:29,042
- You know, she would
usually be the one

309
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:31,083
I would call in a
situation like this.

310
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,958
(Linda sighs)

311
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:40,167
Like this, I mean, whoever
is in a situation like this?

312
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:47,083
I picked up my phone earlier
and I looked who to call

313
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,667
and there was no one.

314
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:55,667
I couldn't think of a
single person to call.

315
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,167
(Linda chuckling)

316
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:00,333
How'd I get like this, huh?

317
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,167
- You know, your husband must've

318
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,375
had something else up there.

319
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,042
From the markings I saw, it
had to be something at least,

320
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:14,958
at least his size if not double.

321
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,125
- You think so?

322
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,250
I will work with you.

323
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,333
I wanna help if you'll let me.

324
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:30,708
I wanna find out what my
husband was working on

325
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:34,750
out there and I wanna
find out what killed him.

326
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:43,958
And then, I wanna take the
son of a bitch out myself.

327
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:50,750
I will work with you.

328
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,708
I will tell you what
you need to know

329
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,417
if you help me get to it.

330
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,292
- All right.

331
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,708
You got yourself a deal.

332
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:04,042
Off the record of course.

333
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,417
- I'll raise a toast to that.

334
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,583
Top up?

335
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:23,958
- You know, if I keep
drinking like this,

336
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,917
I won't be able to
drive myself home.

337
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,292
- I have a couch.

338
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:30,208
You're welcome to
crash if you need.

339
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:32,958
- Top it up.

340
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:37,500
Thank you.

341
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,208
- So, tell me, where's
the wedding ring?

342
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:45,625
- I'm sorry?

343
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:49,792
- Well, yesterday when I
met you at the station,

344
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:51,250
you had a ring on your finger.

345
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:53,042
Now, it's gone.

346
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,000
So, either you decided to
hide that fact when you got

347
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,958
the call to come over or
there's something else.

348
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:05,250
- Wow.

349
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,208
It's a bit of both.

350
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:10,542
- Explain.

351
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,125
- I'm...

352
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,792
I'm going through a bit of
a nasty divorce right now,

353
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:24,500
and I didn't really
want that on show

354
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,792
or to be the topic
of conversation.

355
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:31,375
- How'd you even know it
would be a potential topic?

356
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:35,417
- Is it not?

357
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:40,833
- Well, I invited you
over here to help out

358
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:44,167
on a case and to figure
out what's going on.

359
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:49,375
- Hm and (clinking) gin is
an essential part of that.

360
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,250
Isn't it?

361
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:54,542
- You're good.

362
00:25:58,667 --> 00:25:59,917
You really think
that you'll find out

363
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:01,833
what did this to my husband?

364
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,292
- 100%.

365
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:11,000
Look, whatever is out
there, I'll find it.

366
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:21,333
(traffic humming)

367
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,042
- [Chambers] This
is Suzanne Wright.

368
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:25,875
She was found in the early
hours of the morning.

369
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,125
The neighbors called
it in when they heard

370
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,208
a commotion around
the back of the flat.

371
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:31,333
Our boys went in and they

372
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:34,000
found her body
completely mutilated.

373
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,375
- Uh, where is the location?

374
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,250
- A side street by the club.

375
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:40,875
- So, it's gaining confidence.

376
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,500
It's ventured into the city.

377
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,708
- It seems so, yeah.

378
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:49,083
The same abrasions we found on
the first victim, Peter Rowe.

379
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:52,125
Any results back yet on the
clothing from the first scene?

380
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:55,792
Do we have any ideas yet
what kind of animal this is?

381
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,208
- No, I don't have my
results back either,

382
00:26:57,208 --> 00:27:00,792
but I mean from these abrasions,

383
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:05,958
it's apparent to be
some kinda rodent.

384
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:06,833
- A rodent?

385
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:09,958
- I mean, last night she did say

386
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:12,583
he was working on
mice and rats, but-

387
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,125
- Who?

388
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:16,208
- Linda Rowe, she
told me her husband

389
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:18,833
had been testing
something up in his lab

390
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:21,542
and was taking mice and
rats up there to test

391
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:24,000
whatever drug concoction
he was coming up with.

392
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,583
- What the hell were you doing
with Linda Rowe last night?

393
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:28,500
- She called me.

394
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:31,750
She didn't wanna be alone and
she wanted to help somehow.

395
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,417
- And how the hell did
she get your number?

396
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:35,875
- Sir, I just
thought it would be-

397
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:38,167
- You and I will talk later.

398
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,917
We can't have people helping
investigating this crime

399
00:27:42,917 --> 00:27:45,458
getting involved with the
victim's bereaved wife.

400
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:48,375
It's not professional.

401
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,292
And if you screw this
up, I'll feed your balls

402
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:53,625
to those animals you
study in the goddamn zoo.

403
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:57,583
- Look, she didn't call you

404
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,833
'cause she didn't
think you'd listen.

405
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:01,625
And you know what, I
kinda see her point.

406
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:02,917
Now, look, I'm here
to help you out

407
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,292
and if you wanna keep me here,
I wouldn't start by throwing

408
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:05,958
around your little
empty threats.

409
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:11,000
As for my personal life,
none of your business.

410
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,333
- He made something
up in his lab?

411
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,750
- He made something for sure.

412
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,792
As for what, that's the problem.

413
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:20,542
Right now, everything is
kinda pointing towards

414
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,708
it being some kind
of mutated rodent,

415
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,625
but I don't even wanna say that.

416
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:25,500
I mean, (sighs).

417
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:30,083
I mean, it defies all logic,
it defies all evolution.

418
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,625
Right now, (stuttering),

419
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,167
I can't say exactly
what it is right now.

420
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,375
It's just-

421
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,167
- You're saying some
mutated creature

422
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:38,500
is walking these streets?

423
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,958
- Quite possibly.

424
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:42,875
- [Norton] Damn.

425
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,125
Were there reporters
at the crime scene?

426
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,833
- Press office is
dealing with it now, sir.

427
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:49,875
It's hitting the
news as we speak.

428
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:53,125
- Look, whatever this thing is,

429
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:56,292
it's clearly feeding
once a day minimum.

430
00:28:56,292 --> 00:28:57,667
So, we gotta put the
city on lockdown.

431
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,750
Keep everybody safe
until we can find it.

432
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,500
- Lockdown?

433
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,792
Are you crazy?

434
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:05,250
You can't put the city
on lockdown for this.

435
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,583
We don't even know
what the hell this is.

436
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:11,583
Look, we think it's
killed two people,

437
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,083
but we have no forensic evidence

438
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,667
linking them together as of yet.

439
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:19,125
Hell, we have no evidence of
anything right now except some

440
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:22,458
half-assed theory of a potential
serial giant rat killer.

441
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:25,667
The press will have a field day.

442
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:32,750
The public needs to
be warned, officially.

443
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Only Christ knows
what we can tell them.

444
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:44,208
(light dramatic music)

445
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:51,375
(keys jingling)

446
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:57,917
- [Julie] What is
it about this woman?

447
00:29:57,917 --> 00:29:59,542
- I'm just gonna go warn her.

448
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,625
- Alan, I know you
better than that.

449
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,792
- Julie, that is all.

450
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,208
- Do you really think
it's a good idea

451
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,250
to be hitting on
a grieving widow?

452
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,792
(Alan scoffs)

453
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,750
- Look, there's a major
difference between me warning

454
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,083
somebody and taking them out
for a candlelit dinner, okay?

455
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,542
I'm gonna be two seconds.

456
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:24,750
(door creaking)
(ominous music)

457
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,667
Linda?

458
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,208
Linda, you home?

459
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:35,375
(eerie music)

460
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:45,667
(ceiling thudding)

461
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:51,750
(phone ringing)

462
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:57,458
- [Linda] Alan, hi, it's Linda.

463
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:59,125
I'm down at the station.

464
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,042
They said you went
to check in on me.

465
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:04,667
- Yeah, I'm in your house.

466
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:09,583
- [Linda] Oh, sorry, I
left a little while back.

467
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:10,875
I was asked to go
down to the station

468
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,500
for some further questioning.

469
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:16,083
- Yeah, I think there's
something in your house.

470
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:20,208
- [Linda] What?

471
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:23,625
(eerie music continues)

472
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:42,083
- Yeah, I think it's come back.

473
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:46,250
(suspenseful music)

474
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,542
(light dramatic music)

475
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:01,250
Fuck it.

476
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:09,458
(suspenseful music)

477
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,875
(dramatic music)

478
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:24,125
(Alan groaning)

479
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,667
(mutant growling)
(flesh ripping)

480
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:31,875
(foot thudding)
(Alan groaning)

481
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:38,292
(Alan grunting)
(mutant groaning)

482
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,708
(flesh squishing)
(Alan groaning)

483
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,083
(suspenseful music)
(door slamming)

484
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,542
- [Linda] Alan!

485
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:50,875
(Alan panting)

486
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:52,250
- It's in there, it's in there.

487
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,875
Come on.

488
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,958
Come on, get in the car.

489
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:04,417
- So, you're saying the thing

490
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:09,625
that attacked you
was a giant rat?

491
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:12,083
- Look, I know how
this sounds, all right?

492
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:14,083
But that thing, it
was more mutated.

493
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:18,333
It was the size of a
frickin' bear, I...

494
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,667
God knows how it got that big.

495
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,333
- Whatever he was playing with,

496
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,500
concocting in his
little room, it got out.

497
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,958
- We got the results back.
(light dramatic music)

498
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:33,458
From Linda's clothing
and the first victim.

499
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:34,833
It's definitely rodent fur.

500
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,833
It must've rubbed off
from her husband's body

501
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:40,875
and that's why she
had that reaction.

502
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:45,333
- The biggest question is
why did it go back there?

503
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:48,417
- Maybe it associates
it with its home.

504
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,417
Which isn't necessarily
a bad thing.

505
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:55,625
I mean, at least we know it
isn't in the sewers of the city.

506
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:58,042
- And where do you
suppose this creature goes

507
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:00,333
when it's not at its home?

508
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,792
- God knows, where
do rats dwell?

509
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:06,125
Sewers, dark alleys, dumpsters?

510
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:09,125
- Something the city is full of.

511
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:13,375
- I need to update the
chief on this latest.

512
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:15,583
(Norton sighs)

513
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,833
Christ, this is all we need.

514
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:20,750
- Look, this is a rat.

515
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:23,875
One larger in size,
I'll grant you that,

516
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,125
but it's still a rat.

517
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:28,042
And it's a once in a
lifetime opportunity

518
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:29,333
to deal with
something like this.

519
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,708
I've never encountered
anything like this.

520
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:34,500
I wanna find out what Peter
Rowe was trying to achieve,

521
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,667
how it got this big.

522
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,625
We should treat this like
we would any other case;

523
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:41,042
we trap it and then we study it.

524
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:42,875
- What if you're wrong?

525
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:45,708
What if it becomes
uncontrollable and
more people die?

526
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,958
- Look, if we act fast,
this won't be a situation.

527
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,208
- 24 hours, that's all we have.

528
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,917
We track this fucker down,

529
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:55,667
we figure out how
to take it down,

530
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:58,125
we capture it and we end this.

531
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:00,167
And it's all yours.

532
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:05,875
A word, Alan, before I leave.

533
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:18,042
(Alan groaning)

534
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:19,917
What is going on?

535
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,083
- I'm sorry?

536
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,625
- Your little assistant told me,

537
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:25,708
so I know you're going
through a hard time at home.

538
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,375
But jumping onto
the next best thing

539
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,458
is not gonna resolve your
mental state, all right?

540
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:34,125
I warned you about getting
involved with the wife.

541
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:36,708
You need to be
focused right now.

542
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:38,208
I need your attention.

543
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:41,292
You're the expert that's gonna
help us capture this thing.

544
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,542
Now, I can get my firearms
officers to shoot it dead,

545
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:47,750
but you want it alive.

546
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,458
So, in that case,

547
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,542
buck yourself up and just
stay away from the wife.

548
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:53,750
- I told you, there's
nothing going on.

549
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,375
- Let her grieve.

550
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:57,583
(Alan sighs)
Understood?

551
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:01,875
She could still be a suspect.
- Yeah.

552
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,458
I hear ya.

553
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:05,000
- We'll see you first thing.

554
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:11,667
McKenna.
(eerie music)

555
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:13,833
- Sir?
- Come on, we're off.

556
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,250
- Hey.

557
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:27,042
Everything okay?

558
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:29,542
(Alan chuckling)

559
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:31,167
I'm sorry for turning up.

560
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,875
I just wanted to
check you were okay.

561
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,333
I heard about the attack.

562
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:41,292
- I'm fine, really, it's
just a few scratches.

563
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,750
- I was scared to
go back to the house

564
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,833
after they told me
that thing was there.

565
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,958
They told me I
should be cautious.

566
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:59,333
He can't stop us
from having a drink.

567
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,833
That's not affecting
anything, surely.

568
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:06,583
- I guess I should go by
what he says while I'm still

569
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:10,958
hired and assisting the case.

570
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:18,208
- So, how come you
went by my place today?

571
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,583
- Uh, I, uh, just wanted,

572
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,750
just wanted to
warn you, ya know?

573
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,750
There's a huge mutant
rat running around.

574
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,583
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right, you know?

575
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,250
- I appreciate that.

576
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,042
Thank you.

577
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:45,375
- So, you thought about where
you're gonna wait this out?

578
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,625
- I'll probably just
go back to the hotel

579
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:53,042
that I stayed in after Peter.

580
00:37:53,042 --> 00:37:56,833
You know, when they were
examining the house.

581
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:02,000
- No siblings or-

582
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,375
- No siblings.
- Oh.

583
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,250
- There's an aunt of Peter's,

584
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,167
but she doesn't really
have the space for me.

585
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,292
And I need to kinda
stay close by for work.

586
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:19,375
- Ah, so um, so how
long you been a doctor?

587
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:21,958
- Coming up to my fifth year.

588
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,583
I'm a late starter.

589
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,750
I started off as a nurse

590
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,917
and then I studied
and became a doctor.

591
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,042
I wanted something fulfilling.

592
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:38,833
You know, and after my mom,

593
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,083
I wanted to figure out
something I could do

594
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:46,000
that could stop others from
going through what she did.

595
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,250
And you, a zoologist.

596
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,500
What exactly does that entail?

597
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:03,208
- Well, we specialize in
multiple areas of animal care.

598
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:05,375
Anything from animal welfare

599
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:10,125
to controlling
pests and diseases.

600
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:14,167
My team and I mainly
focus on drug development.

601
00:39:15,292 --> 00:39:17,250
We make drugs to help animals,

602
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,708
whether it be by stopping
the spread of diseases

603
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:23,417
or from stopping them from
contracting it themselves.

604
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:26,833
I started the business when
I just got sick of working

605
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:30,875
for my old boss and then
hired Julie as my assistant,

606
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:34,542
and I just haven't
looked back since.

607
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,875
(Linda sighs)

608
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:42,458
- You know, if I keep drinking,

609
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:47,375
I won't be suitable to drive.

610
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:51,667
(light dramatic music)

611
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:56,833
So, I should probably quit while

612
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,750
I'm ahead and go
check into the hotel.

613
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,708
- It's looking like
it's gonna cost you.

614
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:23,583
- Okay.

615
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:27,000
- You don't look surprised.

616
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
- Well, do any cars pass
their inspections, huh?

617
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,042
(mechanic scoffs)

618
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:34,750
Hm, sorry, how long
is this gonna take?

619
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,500
'Cause I've got places to be.

620
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:42,958
- Right, I'll go finish it now.

621
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:46,167
- Great.
- There's the papers.

622
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:50,333
Copy machine is
ready when you are.

623
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:51,458
- [Woman] Mm.

624
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:57,083
(ominous music)

625
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:58,042
- Stuck up bitch.

626
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,042
(suspenseful music)

627
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,750
(metal clanking)

628
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:27,000
(suspenseful music)

629
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:56,792
(woman sighs)

630
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:04,000
(suspenseful music)
(rats squeaking)

631
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:14,458
(dramatic music)

632
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:17,458
(mutant growling)

633
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:28,917
(light dramatic music)

634
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:33,167
- Hello?

635
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:41,333
Hey, mister.

636
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,792
(door slamming)

637
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,333
Look, I don't have time
to be waiting all day.

638
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:05,750
(dramatic music)
(woman groaning)

639
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:07,958
(suspenseful music)

640
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:13,167
(mutant growling)
(flesh squishing)

641
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:22,333
(woman screaming)

642
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:28,917
(mutant growling)

643
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,375
(metal bins clanking)

644
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:38,250
(woman panting)
(mutant growling)

645
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:43,458
(flesh squishing)
(woman screaming)

646
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:48,625
(hammer thudding)
(mutant screeching)

647
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,833
(mutant growling)
(flesh squishing)

648
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:53,792
(woman screaming)

649
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:07,417
(mutant roaring)

650
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:13,792
(phone ringing)

651
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:17,000
- Alan speaking.

652
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:20,750
All right, yeah.

653
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,667
I'm on my way, I'm on my way.

654
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:27,292
(Alan sighs)

655
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:29,083
When?

656
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,500
When did this happen?

657
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:34,500
- The late hours of the night.

658
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,417
Seemed she had someone
checking out her car.

659
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:39,958
The rat got up probably
from the sewers below,

660
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:42,583
attacked the workman
and then attacked her.

661
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:46,292
- Anyone else around?

662
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:48,000
- Yeah, it was pretty quiet.

663
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,125
Although it does look like
the creature had attempted

664
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:51,667
to get into some
of the other homes.

665
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:53,583
- Goddammit, stop calling
this thing a creature!

666
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:56,125
I told you it's a rat,
it's a frickin' rat!

667
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:57,375
All right?

668
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:58,958
And you shoulda
put warnings out!

669
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:00,917
The public don't even know
what's out there amongst them.

670
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:02,667
All right, if you
had put warnings out,

671
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,667
maybe people would've
stayed fucking indoors!

672
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:06,167
- It isn't that easy.

673
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:08,167
We have to weigh up the factors.

674
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:09,792
Scaring the public into feeling

675
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:12,125
they aren't safe is not the way.

676
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:14,125
It's last case scenario.

677
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:16,625
The public's response is
what we need to control

678
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:18,750
in order to get
ahold of this thing.

679
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,708
This is no different to
any other serial killings,

680
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:23,583
except it's not human.

681
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,333
- Yeah, you're doing
a great job so far.

682
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:28,542
- Whatever actions that
coulda taken place,

683
00:45:28,542 --> 00:45:30,167
it got into the garage.

684
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:32,708
There really isn't much
to have prevented that.

685
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:39,625
The body count's rising.

686
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,208
Christ, this thing
could attack again.

687
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:47,250
We need to get someone else in.

688
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,625
- I'm not leaving this case.

689
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:53,750
- Look, it's out of our hands.

690
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,667
We need to get the FBI in.

691
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:57,708
So, we just wanna thank you for

692
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:59,250
all the work you've done so far.

693
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:04,667
- I'm so sorry, Alan.

694
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:09,708
Look, what you need
to do now is to focus

695
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:13,958
all of your energy onto finding
that thing and ending this.

696
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:16,625
You can't listen to them.

697
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:18,250
- I have no intention
of doing so.

698
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,125
Thank you.

699
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:23,000
Those guys have no idea
what they are dealing with.

700
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:25,625
They didn't see that thing.
They didn't look in its eyes.

701
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:27,667
They didn't see its face.

702
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:31,208
That thing is angry
and it is hungry.

703
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:33,875
Whatever your husband
created, it is pissed off.

704
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,542
We gotta trap it.

705
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:44,292
- What do you mean?

706
00:46:44,292 --> 00:46:46,875
- It'll go back to the house.

707
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:49,917
It obviously sees it as
some kind of safe place,

708
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,292
so we go back there.

709
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,750
And when it returns,
we're ready.

710
00:46:57,792 --> 00:46:58,792
- We wait it out?

711
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,083
- Exactly.

712
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:03,542
- Okay.

713
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:11,125
- All right, all right.
(light dramatic music)

714
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:16,542
(suspenseful music)

715
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,458
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

716
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:27,417
Let it come out.

717
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:29,000
You just stay there.

718
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,875
- Sure.

719
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:35,250
(fist knocking)

720
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,375
(suspenseful music)

721
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:48,500
(fist knocking)

722
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:02,500
(Julie scoffs)
(Alan sighs)

723
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,917
- Firstly, what the
hell are you doing here?

724
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:07,833
Secondly, what is going on?

725
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:11,625
- All right, okay, all
right, just let me explain.

726
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:13,500
- Go on.

727
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:18,000
- They uh, they
brought the feds in.

728
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,458
Another girl was found
dead this morning.

729
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:21,833
- [Julie] Oh, Alan.

730
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:24,292
- Yeah, right now I just
kinda wanna focus on

731
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:26,250
getting this thing
over and down with

732
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:30,333
so it doesn't get out
and harm anyone else.

733
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:31,292
- Well, I don't think you need

734
00:48:31,292 --> 00:48:33,583
to worry about that much longer.

735
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:35,583
- [Alan] What do you mean?

736
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,875
- Go and turn on the news.

737
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:46,417
(restaurant guests
talking over each other)

738
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:53,083
- Hey, honey.
- What time do you call this?

739
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:55,792
- Come on, can't we
make this a good night?

740
00:48:55,792 --> 00:48:59,583
- What, you want me to put
on a smile and just act like

741
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:02,500
you being late all the
time isn't a big issue?

742
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,958
- This thing's still
loose in our city.

743
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:07,208
This is my job, all right?

744
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:10,042
I can't just drop it
when I feel like it.

745
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:13,500
- Drinks?

746
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:19,875
- Vodka straight, please.
- Sure.

747
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:22,458
- I guess I'll take the same.

748
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:26,750
(light swanky music)

749
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:37,875
(light dramatic music)
(rats squeaking)

750
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,208
(rats scampering)

751
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:55,125
(trash thudding)

752
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,875
(rats squeaking)

753
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:01,000
(suspenseful music)

754
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:07,208
- Oh, shit, pickin' up
the fuckin' trash now.

755
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,958
(trash rustling)

756
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:14,833
(eerie music)

757
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:17,917
(rats squeaking)
Vermin.

758
00:50:17,917 --> 00:50:23,125
(liquid splashing)
(suspenseful music)

759
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,500
(dramatic music)
(mutant growling)

760
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,708
(muffled rock music)

761
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,750
Jay!

762
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:49,000
(Tina screaming)
Help me!

763
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,500
Jay!
(mutant growling)

764
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,375
Help!

765
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:56,250
(Tina screaming)

766
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:02,750
(mutant grunting)
(flesh squishing)

767
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,583
(body thudding)
(Tina gasps)

768
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:06,750
(mutant screeching)

769
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:07,417
(silverware clanking)

770
00:51:07,417 --> 00:51:10,875
(mutant growling)

771
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:16,083
(ominous music)
(Tina panting)

772
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:30,875
(Tina crying)

773
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:37,833
(Tina screaming)

774
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:42,208
(suspenseful music)

775
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:51,750
(head crunching)
(mutant growling)

776
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:59,458
(neck snapping)

777
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:04,083
(body thudding)
(light swanky music)

778
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,833
(mutant roaring)

779
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:09,875
(waitress groaning)

780
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:11,750
(bottles shattering)

781
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,458

00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:19,667
(mutant groaning)
(claws thudding)

783
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,125
(plates shattering)

784
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:29,625
(mutant growling)

785
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:32,250
(foot thudding)

786
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,042
(chair crashing)

787
00:52:34,042 --> 00:52:36,667
(waitress groaning)

788
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:39,500
(neck snapping)

789
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:50,250
(flesh squishing)
(man screaming)

790
00:52:57,333 --> 00:53:02,542
(hand thudding)
(people screaming)

791
00:53:05,042 --> 00:53:06,333
(mutant growling)

792
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:09,833
(woman screaming)

793
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:12,958
(neck snapping)

794
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:14,250
(woman screaming)

795
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:18,792
(flesh squishing)
(woman screaming)

796
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:21,750
(restaurant guests screaming)

797
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:25,792
(man grunting)
(bottles shattering)

798
00:53:25,792 --> 00:53:27,083
(flesh squishing)
(man groaning)

799
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:30,042
(woman screaming)

800
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:40,792
- You brought a gun to
our anniversary dinner?

801
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:44,250
- Fuckin' right, now
get the fuck out!

802
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:46,000
(gunshots banging)

803
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,125
(blood squishing)

804
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:51,417
(suspenseful music)

805
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:58,458
(Norton screaming)
(flesh squishing)

806
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:07,667
(dramatic music)

807
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:19,250
- You really think that'll work?

808
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:24,500
- Sure, I mean, it's just
about keeping it inside.

809
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:28,792
- Say it reproduces.

810
00:54:28,792 --> 00:54:31,167
I mean, what do we,
what do we do then?

811
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:34,708
- Well, I mean, the
average rat reproduces

812
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:38,250
every three weeks.

813
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:41,042
And this being a mutated rat,

814
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:46,167
I'd say it could vary anything
from months to weeks to days.

815
00:54:47,542 --> 00:54:49,375
I'd like to say that
days is unlikely,

816
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:53,792
but I mean, look, the
faster we catch this thing,

817
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:55,917
the faster we can end this.

818
00:55:00,917 --> 00:55:02,875
- Well, I'm gonna hit the sack.

819
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:05,125
Doesn't look like it's
coming back tonight.

820
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:06,792
- [Alan] Okay, I'll
stay up till sunrise.

821
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:08,458
Don't worry.

822
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:09,917
- Let me know if
you need anything.

823
00:55:09,917 --> 00:55:11,833
- Sure, sweet dreams.
- Good night.

824
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:14,708
I've put some fresh linen
and towels upstairs for you.

825
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:16,083
- [Julie] Oh, thanks.

826
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,500
- [Alan] Ah, man.

827
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,667
- Everything all right?

828
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:27,667
- Ah, it's just, just
my back still stings

829
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:29,167
from the other night.

830
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:32,167
I shoulda got it checked out
earlier today, but (sighs).

831
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,583
- Let me take a look.

832
00:55:34,583 --> 00:55:36,000
I can help.

833
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,917
- Any excuse to get
my shirt off, eh?

834
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:40,625
- You wish.

835
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:42,958
Come on, I am a doctor.

836
00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:44,417
- Oh, I know.
- Show me.

837
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:48,542
(Alan groaning)

838
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:58,792
Looks like these bandages
haven't been changed.

839
00:56:00,292 --> 00:56:03,375
You should be changing these
twice a day to avoid infection.

840
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:07,375
Have you been using antiseptic?

841
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:08,875
- No, I was just using
whatever the police doctor

842
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:11,667
gave me when they
first checked me over.

843
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:14,792
- Alan, that rat coulda been
carrying all kinds of diseases.

844
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:20,292
Can you please take
care of yourself better?

845
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:22,792
- Yes, ma'am.

846
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,875
(light music)

847
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:31,167
- This is gonna sting.

848
00:56:34,917 --> 00:56:36,917
- God fuckin' dammit.

849
00:56:36,917 --> 00:56:40,625
(Alan clears throat)

850
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:43,083
(Alan sighs)

851
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:47,583
Thank you for caring.

852
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:50,083
It feels like it's been a while

853
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:53,125
since someone actually
cared, you know?

854
00:56:54,542 --> 00:56:55,708
- I could say the same.

855
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,917
- How do you mean?

856
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:02,083
- I don't believe that anyone

857
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:04,125
truly has the perfect marriage.

858
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:08,125
I mean, I get that people
have their hiccups.

859
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,542
You know, the ups and downs.
- Uh huh.

860
00:57:12,542 --> 00:57:14,083
- That's all I'm gonna say.

861
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:17,458
- What, he didn't
make you feel loved?

862
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:20,542
- He was a busy guy.

863
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:23,875
- Oh, I know that story.

864
00:57:25,917 --> 00:57:29,208
I think that's, that's where
I messed up with Jenna.

865
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:35,042
I just wasn't as much
as I shoulda been,

866
00:57:35,042 --> 00:57:36,542
and when I was, I didn't...

867
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:40,917
I didn't give her the
attention she deserved.

868
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:42,792
- People lead busy lives.

869
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,000
It's easy to get caught up.

870
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,667
It's understandable.

871
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,833
- Yeah, but what's not
understandable is not seeing

872
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:52,708
what's right there
in front of you.

873
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:59,375
And not showing that
person day in and day out

874
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:00,875
how much they mean to you.

875
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,667
That's supposed to be
the easy part, right?

876
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:09,875
(light music)

877
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:17,917
(bugs chirping)

878
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:26,458
(fist knocking)

879
00:58:31,667 --> 00:58:33,875
- Who's that?
- What?

880
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:36,167
- Who's at the door?

881
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:37,042
- Oh, shit.

882
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:39,250
Shit, I fell asleep.

883
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,375
You stay here.

884
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:44,292
I'll go check.

885
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,333
(Alan groaning)

886
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:54,500
(door creaking)

887
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,958
- Thought we'd find you here.

888
00:58:57,375 --> 00:58:58,583
- What's going on?

889
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:01,458
- Have you seen the news?

890
00:59:03,292 --> 00:59:04,917
- With all that we know now,

891
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:07,333
did the police leave
this too late to tell us?

892
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:10,250
Should we all have been
warned much sooner?

893
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,708
What we know is that
this so-called beast

894
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:16,208
has now taken the lives
of dozens of citizens.

895
00:59:16,208 --> 00:59:18,375
But perhaps that coulda
been avoided if the public

896
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:20,000
had been made aware much sooner

897
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,958
that a beast was on
the loose in the city.

898
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:24,708
Police have confirmed
that the beast

899
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,917
is a wild and predatory animal,

900
00:59:26,917 --> 00:59:30,250
possibly ranging between
five and six feet in height.

901
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:33,250
The advice is to stay
indoors until further news,

902
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:35,708
and avoid drainage
areas and sewers.

903
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:38,125
They're advising that
if you see the beast,

904
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:39,500
do not approach.

905
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:42,458
People are being told
to travel in groups

906
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:45,750
of at least two persons,
keeping to well lit streets

907
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,958
and avoiding evenings
and night times.

908
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:53,625
- We need your help.

909
00:59:54,292 --> 00:59:55,208
- Of course.

910
00:59:58,042 --> 00:59:59,875
- You already have an idea?

911
01:00:01,042 --> 01:00:02,167
- What, us being
back in the house

912
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:04,375
wasn't enough of a clue for you?

913
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:05,542
It'll come back.

914
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:07,208
We just gotta wait it out.

915
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:08,708
- Well, how can you be so sure?

916
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:10,125
- Look, I can't be
sure of anything,

917
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:12,667
but I can damn well be
ready if it does come back.

918
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:16,000
- How the fuck are you
three gonna take it out?

919
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,875
- Look, you called us
for a reason, right?

920
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:25,708
So, unless you have a better
idea, this is the plan.

921
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:29,875
Now, you can stay and
help us or you can leave,

922
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:32,667
and go about whatever little
plan you've already got.

923
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:36,917
No one's forcing you to
stay here, all right?

924
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:37,875
It's your choice.

925
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:44,958
- Tell us what to do.

926
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:54,333
(bugs chirping)

927
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:57,042
(trunk creaking)

928
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:02,208
- We're gonna need something
to defend ourselves.

929
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:03,833
- You didn't bring a firearm?

930
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,250
I thought you wild
animal experts

931
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,542
all had that as
part of your job.

932
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,583
- Well, pick your poison.

933
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:14,667
- I'll stick with my gun.

934
01:01:16,292 --> 01:01:17,958
My friend died last
night because he couldn't

935
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:20,042
defend himself
against that thing.

936
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:27,000
I'm carrying and I'll
use it if needed.

937
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:34,417
- Look, I'm, I'm sorry
about Captain Norton.

938
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:40,792
We're gonna get this
fucker, all right?

939
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:43,750
- Damn right.

940
01:01:50,167 --> 01:01:53,250
(trunk slamming)

941
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:56,417
(mutant screeching)

942
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:58,083
- Okay, we need
to go back inside.

943
01:01:58,083 --> 01:01:59,000
Come on, come on.

944
01:02:04,792 --> 01:02:07,708
- This gas, it'll actually work?

945
01:02:07,708 --> 01:02:11,583
I mean, you didn't
seem convinced earlier.

946
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:16,042
- Yeah, well, I didn't
really understand it earlier.

947
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:19,583
But as long as we keep it
in the house it should work.

948
01:02:21,542 --> 01:02:24,583
(mutant shrieking)

949
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:36,167
(Linda sighs)

950
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:42,458
- Be ready.
- What's going on?

951
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:43,333
- It's coming.

952
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:05,875
- What are you
planning on doing?

953
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:07,250
Stay inside the house.

954
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,125
- I'm gonna lure it
back to the house.

955
01:03:09,125 --> 01:03:10,333
Now, get back in the house

956
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:11,583
and just make sure
every door is locked.

957
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:13,750
- You need to be careful.

958
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:15,417
- I got this!

959
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:17,792
Go back in the house.

960
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:25,833
- Just in case.

961
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,792
- We are gassing
it, not shooting it.

962
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:32,583
- We're gonna do anything we
need to to fuckin' kill it.

963
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:36,250
(gun clicks)
It's jammed.

964
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:40,875
(mutant growling)

965
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:45,458
(ominous music)

966
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,708
- What was that?

967
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:17,125
(bugs chirping)

968
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:31,333
(suspenseful music)

969
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:34,458
- Where is it?

970
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:42,000
(mutant growling)
(Julie screaming)

971
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,208

973
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,833

(Chambers screaming)

979
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:06,000
- Get Alan!
(claw thudding)

980

981

(Chambers panting)

986
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,750
- [Alan] Open the door!

987
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:02,583
- Fuck, I can't open
it, it's fuckin' locked.

988
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:05,833
(Julie screaming)
Where's the key?

989
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:07,083
I need to go
upstairs and get her.

990
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:08,917
- You go, I'll find
another way in.

991
01:06:09,792 --> 01:06:13,167
(light dramatic music)

992
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,167
(Alan panting)

993
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:22,083
Goddammit.

994
01:06:26,625 --> 01:06:29,667
Linda, it's in the house.

995
01:06:29,667 --> 01:06:30,542
- I know.

996
01:06:32,167 --> 01:06:33,750
- So, you get outside
and wait there.

997
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,667
I'll get Julie and
then we'll gas it.

998
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:40,708
- Leave it to me.

999
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:43,000
I'm going to.

1000
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,583
- What the hell?
- I'm sorry, Alan.

1001
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:49,708
I've got to do it myself.

1002
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:51,958
- No, what the hell is this?

1003
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:55,292
- Just stay there.
(eerie music)

1004

(Alan groaning)

1006
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:11,208
- Marsh?

(glass shattering)
(Alan groaning)

1008
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:28,167
Julie, you up here?

1009
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:31,292
- Yes.

1010
01:07:36,417 --> 01:07:37,417
- Is it locked?

1011
01:07:39,417 --> 01:07:40,792
- Yes.

1012
01:07:40,792 --> 01:07:43,542

1046
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:35,500
Sorry.

- Alan, are you okay?
(Alan groaning)

1055
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:43,041
- Where is it?

1056
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:44,708
- [Julie] It's locked
in the dining room.

1057
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:46,708
- What, what the hell happened?

1058
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:49,250
- I think it was Linda.

1059
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,000
- What?

1060
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:53,458
- I found these
documents upstairs.

1061
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:57,291
I think she's been keeping
close to us to monitor us.

1062
01:12:57,291 --> 01:12:59,125
To stop us from killing the rat.

1063
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,500
I don't think her husband
made this monster at all.

1064
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,166
- What are you saying?

1065
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:07,041
- I'm saying, these
documents are Linda's.

1066
01:13:08,458 --> 01:13:11,875
I think she was experimenting
on the rat to help her mother,

1067
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:14,541
and I think it escaped
and killed her husband,

1068
01:13:14,541 --> 01:13:16,666
and now she's trying
to cover her tracks.

1069
01:13:17,833 --> 01:13:18,750
Look.

1070
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:23,916
- What the hell?

1071
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:28,000
(light dramatic music)

1072
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,250
- Why'd you have to go through
and find all the information?

1073
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,250
- Linda, what in the
hell is going on?

1074
01:13:38,416 --> 01:13:40,333
- She suffered a horrible death.

1075
01:13:42,708 --> 01:13:44,666
The cancer spread so rapidly.

1076
01:13:46,916 --> 01:13:48,375
There was nothing we could do,

1077
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:53,583
but sit back and watch her
suffer until her drying breath.

1078
01:13:56,458 --> 01:13:59,833
To prevent anyone else from
ever experiencing this again,

1079
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:05,833
I tried to make something in
vain of what happened to her.

1080
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,125
To honor her life.

1081
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:13,083
A cure that could
prevent anyone else

1082
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:16,000
from having to go through
what my mother had to.

1083
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:20,583
I found an antidote
that reverses cells

1084
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:22,583
from growing at such a pace.

1085
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:28,083
The idea was the cells
would reduce in size,

1086
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:31,833
become manageable, so
the patient could live

1087
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:35,125
with the disease for
many, many years.

1088
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:38,083
It went wrong.

1089
01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:45,500
In fact, what I made
had the opposite effect.

1090
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:49,375
It made cells grow
at such a pace

1091
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:53,375
that it enlarged the body
the way a steroid would.

1092
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:59,250
The rat I was testing on
was growing at such a pace,

1093
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:02,833
I documented it
over several weeks.

1094
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,250
- What, that thing was in
this house for several weeks?

1095
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:11,458
- One night it must've
escaped, and found Peter.

1096
01:15:15,916 --> 01:15:17,083
And it killed him.

1097
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:22,291
If Peter hadn't died that night,

1098
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:27,166
I believe I would've found
the answers I was looking for.

1099
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:32,041
The reaction the rat
had was a positive one,

1100
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:35,125
even though it didn't work for
the direction I wanted it to.

1101
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:40,541
If I had more time I could've
studied how to reverse it

1102
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:44,791
and make the cells
dissolve at a similar pace.

1103
01:15:47,666 --> 01:15:48,916
I was so close.

1104
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:52,250
- And now, he's
gone and we've got

1105
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:55,333
a mutated rat just
dying to tear us apart.

1106
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:57,208
So, what the fuck is
your big idea, Linda?

1107
01:15:57,208 --> 01:15:58,291
What is your plan?

1108
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:01,208
- I have to end this now.

1109
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:04,625
This is all my fault.

1110
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:11,125
I was only trying to
do the right thing.

1111
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:16,583
I'm so sorry it got out of hand.

1112
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:19,750
I did not mean for
any of this to happen.

1113
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:24,666
- You were using
me for information.

1114
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:32,083
- As we continued to
meet, the more we met,

1115
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:35,625
the more I realized how
they were involving you.

1116
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,208
- No, no, no, no, no, you
used me for information.

1117
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:44,375
Why didn't you just
tell me what you did?

1118
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:45,791
I coulda helped you.

1119
01:16:45,791 --> 01:16:49,750
- And risk going to jail
for what's happened?

1120
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:52,875
You seemed to have a plan
how to capture the rat.

1121
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:54,625
I had already tried and failed.

1122
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:57,291
- What do you mean?

1123
01:16:59,458 --> 01:17:04,875
Wait, when I came here to
warn you and I got attacked,

1124
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,666
you lead it here?

1125
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,583
- It returned while I was gone.

1126
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:14,875
I was too late to trap it.

1127
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:20,500
I'm sorry for what
happened to you.

1128
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:23,250
I felt so bad.

1129
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:31,208
If I'd been here, I could've
just killed it myself.

1130
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:35,500
- Just, just, just
lower your gun.

1131
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,000
Let us, let us help you.

1132
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:42,458
- No, I want you to get
out of the house, Alan.

1133
01:17:43,541 --> 01:17:44,958
Let me deal with this.

1134
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:46,833
- You can't do this alone.
(suspenseful music)

1135
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:49,166
Just, just, just let
us, let us help you.

1136
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:53,166
- I started this,
now I gotta end it.

1137
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:55,625
- All right, I get it, I
get why you did it, okay?

1138
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:56,833
Just let us help you.

1139
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:58,583
Give me the gun,
give me the gun.

1140
01:17:58,583 --> 01:18:00,708
- Just get outta
the house, Alan.

1141
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:03,833
(suspenseful music)
This isn't safe.

1142
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:04,750
(McKenna grunting)
(bat thudding)

1143
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:07,625
(Linda groaning)

1144
01:18:14,416 --> 01:18:16,708
- What the hell was
this woman playing at?

1145
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:19,208
- Julie, McKenna, get
outside, get Linda.

1146
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:20,416
- What?

1147
01:18:20,416 --> 01:18:22,250
- Just go outside, I'll
meet you out there.

1148
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:23,500
- I'm not leaving you.

1149
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,541
- Look, I'm gonna
set this thing off.

1150
01:18:25,541 --> 01:18:28,583
You get Linda, find a window,
and no matter what happens,

1151
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:29,791
just get out, all right?

1152
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:32,541
Okay?

1153
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:35,166
- Okay.

1154
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,291
(door creaking)

1155
01:18:38,291 --> 01:18:41,000
(eerie music)

1156
01:18:51,833 --> 01:18:54,583
(mutant growling)

1157
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:56,333
Linda, wake up, we've
gotta get out of here.

1158
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:58,333
(Linda groaning)

1159
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:00,125
- I have to kill it.

1160
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:04,041
I gotta kill it.

1161
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:06,708
Oh, (groaning).

1162
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,166
(eerie music)

1163
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:26,583
(flesh squishing)
(suspenseful music)

1164
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:44,125
(gas hissing)

1165
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:49,291
(suspenseful music)

1166
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:10,708
(dramatic music)

1167
01:20:13,166 --> 01:20:14,291
- Get out.

1168
01:20:14,291 --> 01:20:16,666
Get out!
- Linda, come on!

1169
01:20:16,666 --> 01:20:20,666
- Go!
(mutant growling)

1170
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:23,000
(suspenseful music)

1171
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,250
- Go, go, go, go!

1172
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:29,958
Go!
- I'm going!

1173
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:33,625
(intense dramatic music)

1174
01:20:34,916 --> 01:20:37,500
(Alan panting)

1175
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:49,583
- Come on, come on, come on.

1176
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:51,916
Let's go, let's go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

1177
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:57,750
(suspenseful music)

1178
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,125
All right.

1179
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:04,041
(house rumbling)
What the fuck was that?

1180
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:11,000
(intense dramatic music)

1181
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:14,666
Fuck.

1182
01:21:15,791 --> 01:21:17,250
- I thought we
killed that thing?

1183
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:20,625
- It must've got into the
drug concoction in the lab.

1184
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,333
(mutant growling)

1185
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:25,208
- Jesus, it's still growing.

1186
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:26,416
- We've gotta get out of here.

1187
01:21:26,416 --> 01:21:27,416
- Come on, run!

1188
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:28,333
- Move!
- Come on!

1189
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:32,458
- Get to the car.
- Come on.

1190
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:35,333
(dramatic music)

1191
01:21:38,708 --> 01:21:40,166
- Come on, man, start
the fucking car!

1192
01:21:40,166 --> 01:21:43,708
(car engine sputtering)

1193
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:47,875
McKenna, how about we just
start the fucking car?

1194
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:50,708
- Get out, now!
- Open the door.

1195
01:21:50,708 --> 01:21:52,166
Open the door!
- We can't get out!

1196
01:21:52,166 --> 01:21:53,791
- Open the door then,
open the fucking door!

1197
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:55,875
Open the door, come
on, open the door!

1198
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:58,250
Open the door then!

1199
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,541
(mutant growling)
Oh, God!

1200
01:21:59,541 --> 01:22:02,541
- McKenna, I can't-
- This way, come on.

1201
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:04,250
Come on, open the door.

1202
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:06,291
Open the fuckin' door.
(mutant growling)

1203
01:22:06,291 --> 01:22:08,041
Come on!
- Oh, I'm stuck!

1204
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:12,125
- Come on, come on.
(suspenseful music)

1205
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:15,000

(mutant roaring)
(Julie screaming)

1216
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:56,791

(mutant growling)

1223
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:44,916
Look, whatever that
thing has taken,

1224
01:23:44,916 --> 01:23:47,208
it's just gonna get bigger and
it's just gonna keep mutating

1225
01:23:47,208 --> 01:23:49,250
and there's only so
much his body can take.

1226
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:52,416
Just watch.
(suspenseful music)

1227

(Alan spitting)

1233
01:24:26,125 --> 01:24:28,708
- Do you know how far we
are from civilization?

1234
01:24:28,708 --> 01:24:30,583
