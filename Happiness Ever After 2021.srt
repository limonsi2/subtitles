<i>-Okay.</i>

166
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,708
<i>-Pizza maybe?</i>
<i>-[Zimkhitha] I love vegan pizza.</i>

167
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,625
<i>[Zimkhitha] All right,</i>
<i>let's start off with an inhale,</i>

168
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:25,791
<i>open up the heart,</i>
<i>chin up, into seated cow.</i>

169
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:30,416
<i>And exhale,</i>

<i>[Princess] I did.</i>

174
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,250
<i>[Zimkhitha] And let's just keep going.</i>

175
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,750
<i>[Princess] I wish I could</i>

176
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,916

<i>[Zaza] I know, right?</i>

178
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,375

180
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,583
<i>All right. Um.</i>

181
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,958
<i>Ladies, I think</i>

182
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,583
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-[Zaza] Thanks.</i>

183
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:04,041
<i>Listen, Princess, um,</i>
<i>your exhibition was… was amazing.</i>

184
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,291
<i>-Aw.</i>
<i>-Honestly, from the artwork to…</i>

185
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,416
<i>to the people there, um.</i>

186
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,833
<i>-I'm glad I stayed.</i>
<i>-It was the people.</i>

187
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,000
<i>-Hmm, the people there.</i>
<i>-[Zimkhitha] Namaste, ladies.</i>

188
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,041
<i>-[chuckles]</i>
<i>-[Zaza] Namaste.</i>

189
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,791
<i>So shit has happened we need to dissect.</i>

190
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,666
<i>My life is not a science project, okay.</i>

191
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,916
<i>-There's nothing to dissect.</i>
<i>-You need to think about it.</i>

192

<i>The man you choose is actually</i>

<i>Hmm.</i>

194
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,333
<i>Beki took care of business.</i>
<i>I don't have to worry about anything.</i>

195

<i>So don't let this</i>
<i>Leo nonsense fool you. Please.</i>

196
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,125
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

197
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,750
<i>-Why would you do that?</i>
<i>-Oh ye of little faith.</i>

198
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,583
<i>-This was very useful.</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

199
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,291
<i>[Yonda] See, we need</i>
<i>to be extremely accurate,</i>

200
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,958
<i>because these girls</i>
<i>are no match for the "single men."</i>

201
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:50,666
<i>If I may just say here, the basis of</i>
<i>this entire research is completely flawed.</i>

202
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,083
<i>We need to speak to real people</i>

203
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,750
<i>here and not some</i>
<i>scientific research or some stats now.</i>

204

<i>I got that.</i>

205
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,958
<i>I don't know. We-- We just need</i>
<i>to figure out what our users want</i>

206
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,541
<i>and that way, I can give it to them.</i>

207
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,708
<i>Wrong. That's not</i>
<i>how these things work, okay?</i>

208
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,291
<i>What they do is they give us the money,</i>

209
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,833
<i>and then we give them</i>
<i>a platform that they can explore.</i>

210
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,250
<i>Yonda, please,</i>
<i>it is scientifically proven that</i>

<i>[Max] New adventure?</i>

00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:39,583
<i>Well, what you need to do, my friend,</i>

506
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:41,375
<i>is you need to invite me</i>
<i>to more exhibitions.</i>

<i>[laughing]</i>

508
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,083
<i>[Yonda] So, what you're looking at</i>
<i>is the prototype.</i>

509
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:49,916
<i>So the app has a function that simulates</i>

510
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,291
<i>the basic needs</i>
<i>that our clients look out for.</i>

<i>I can only fund this</i>
<i>from my private coffers.</i>

<i>A bunch of random strangers</i>
<i>commenting on my idea,</i>

<i>[Zimkhitha] </i>It's not a bunch of randoms.
It can help you.

1133
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:20,958
<i>Leo, Leon. I'll pour you a drink.</i>

1134
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:23,291
<i>-Oh, uh…</i>
<i>-No, thanks.</i>

1135
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:25,916
<i>-[Princess] That won't be necessary.</i>
<i>-[Max] Of course, uh…</i>

1136
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:30,583
<i>Leon here is fighting demons.</i>
<i>Then aren't we all?</i>

1137
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:37,333
<i>-[Leo] Yeah.</i>
<i>-Leon is Thandi's absent father.</i>

<i>-Maxwell!</i>
<i>-Oh!</i>

1139
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:40,416
<i>But he is.</i>

1140
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,166
<i>Yeah. You know what Prof.,</i>
<i>you're so right. I, uh, I've been absent.</i>

1141
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:47,375
<i>But I plan to make up for all that now.</i>

1142
01:07:47,458 --> 01:07:48,916
<i>Is it?</i>

1143
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:50,625
<i>[Leo] Yeah.</i>

1144
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:52,291
<i>It is.</i>

1145
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:58,458
<i>[woman] You know, Princess,</i>

1146
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:01,583
<i>you've really struck gold</i>
<i>with Maxwell here.</i>

1147

<i>-Babe.</i>
<i>-[Zaza] Oh, has she? Hmm?</i>

1148
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:04,500
<i>-[Zim] Zaza.</i>
<i>-No, but she started it.</i>

1149
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:07,416
<i>You know, everything that glitters</i>
<i>is not always gold.</i>

1150

<i>-[dramatic music playing]</i>
<i>-[huffs]</i>

1151

<i>-[indistinct chatter]</i>

1152
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:17,375
<i>Thanks for the invite.</i>

1153
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:58,958
<i>[Princess] Thank you so much</i>
<i>for tonight. It has been--</i>

1154
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:00,791
<i>Before you thank us, who is that--</i>

1155
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:03,458
<i>[woman] Sorry. Sorry.</i>
<i>Can I please use your bathroom?</i>

1156
01:09:03,541 --> 01:09:06,500
<i>Yes, of course.</i>
<i>It's just around the corner to your left.</i>

1157

<i>-Za-za.</i>
<i>-"Lala," look.</i>

1159
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:12,125
<i>If Mzwa tries to speak to you,</i>
<i>don't say anything.</i>

1160

<i>I don't wanna have to put my hands on you.</i>

1161
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:16,583
<i>-Oh.</i>
<i>-Okay?</i>

1162
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:19,166

<i>-[Zaza] Huh.</i>

1163
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:22,416
<i>Don't let him go. Okay? I'll be back.</i>

1164
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:24,916
<i>You'll be back. [chuckles] Okay.</i>

1165
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,750
<i>-It's okay. Zaza, Zaza.</i>
<i>-It's okay.</i>

1166
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:30,333
<i>Okay guys, listen. You know what,</i>
<i>I think I'm gonna head.</i>

1167
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:34,000
<i>-Please, don't. Please, please, please.</i>
<i>-No way, chill, chill, chill, chill.</i>

1168
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:35,125
<i>So, wait.</i>

1169

<i>-[laughs]</i>

<i>-Yonda was the guy from yoga.</i>

1171
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,208
<i>-Okay, Miss Leo.</i>
<i>-Ooh.</i>

1172
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:42,833
<i>-Let's talk about you.</i>
<i>-Let's don't.</i>

1173
01:09:42,916 --> 01:09:44,916
<i>Also, what was going</i>
<i>on with you at the table?</i>

1174
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,583
<i>Don't put me in this thing</i>
<i>of yours, please, okay.</i>

1175
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:49,958
<i>Yeah. Hey, tonight was crazy.</i>

1176

<i>-[laughs]</i>
<i>-Like, actually, no?</i>

1177
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:55,916
<i>Ha-ha-ha.</i>

1178
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:57,625
<i>[Max] Bye.</i>

<i>[Max] Well, the party's over.</i>

1182
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,625
<i>It is, isn't it?</i>

1183
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:33,750
<i>I wanna see her.</i>

1184

<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Yeah, um…</i>

1186
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:40,708
<i>I'll call my mom</i>

<i>-[Leo] Please.</i>
<i>-[softly] Yeah.</i>

1188
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,833
<i>[Leo] Yeah?</i>

1189
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,500
<i>Thandi's asleep, so…</i>

1190
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:11,333
<i>She's gonna drop her off in the morning.</i>

1191
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:17,375
<i>Just--</i>

1192
01:11:18,416 --> 01:11:20,541
<i>Please don't forget</i>
<i>to give her my present.</i>

1193
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:21,791
<i>Yeah.</i>

1194
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,708
<i>-I'll see you?</i>
<i>-[softly] Yeah.</i>

1195
01:11:38,541 --> 01:11:39,791
<i>You slept with him.</i>

1196
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:45,875
<i>Is he what you want?</i>

1197
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,458
<i>[sighs]</i>

1198
01:11:49,583 --> 01:11:50,666
<i>Maxwell.</i>

1199
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:53,750
<i>You are what I want.</i>

1200
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,083
<i>You're my peace.</i>

1201
01:11:58,041 --> 01:11:59,666
<i>You're my calm. You--</i>

1202
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,583
<i>Max.</i>

1203
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:04,666
<i>This is what I want.</i>

1204
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:06,833
<i>[Max] No, that is what you want to want.</i>

1205
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:12,583
<i>Princess, we are building</i>
<i>a solid family together.</i>

1206
01:12:13,791 --> 01:12:15,125
<i>I just wanted--</i>

1207
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:19,125
<i>You know what?</i>

1208
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,500
<i>You can go on living your lie.</i>

1209
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:22,458
<i>My lie?</i>

1210
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:25,416
<i>Yes, this lie that you deserve</i>
<i>to be with someone</i>

1211
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,291
<i>that crushed you and left you.</i>

1212
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:28,333
<i>Max!</i>

1213
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:33,000
<i>This subservient wife shit, it's not me.</i>

1214
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:34,750
<i>Yeah.</i>

1215
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,041
<i>You know, if you don't know who you are,</i>

1216
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:42,083
<i>everyone will tell you</i>
<i>who you're meant to be.</i>

1217
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:45,583
<i>[somber music playing]</i>

1218
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,791
<i>Don't blame me for your indecisiveness.</i>

1219
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:55,125
<i>Max.</i>

1220
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:26,375
<i>[Zaza] You know Princess,</i>
<i>if that basic, crass woman sells my house,</i>

1221
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:29,458
<i>my kids and I are literally</i>
<i>on the streets. We're homeless.</i>

1222
01:13:29,541 --> 01:13:31,583
<i>Please just sell the penthouse</i>
<i>and pay back the money.</i>

1223
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:33,875
<i>I don't want to.</i>

1224
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,708
<i>So, uh, Maxwell, moved out.</i>

1225
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,625
<i>Huh? What happened?</i>

1226
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:48,666
<i>What did you do?</i>

1227
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:50,375
<i>I mean, you know, I…</i>

1228
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:53,875
<i>kind of slept with Leo. So…</i>

1229
01:13:58,291 --> 01:13:59,375
<i>Don't say it.</i>

1230
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:01,458
<i>No, I won't. We know you, you're weak.</i>

1231
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:04,875
<i>It just happened. I mean,</i>
<i>it's not like I planned it or anything.</i>

1232
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:06,833
<i>Of course you didn't plan it,</i>
<i>you kinky cat.</i>

1233
01:14:06,916 --> 01:14:08,333
<i>-[sighs]</i>
<i>-And the ring?</i>

1234
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:10,583
<i>I'm going to give</i>
<i>the ring back, don't worry.</i>

1235
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:13,250
<i>-You're going. So it's still with you.</i>
<i>-[laughs]</i>

1236
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:14,958
<i>Anyway, you never give back diamonds.</i>

1237
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:16,833
<i>-I'm not you, I'll give it back.</i>
<i>-Slay queen.</i>

1238

<i>-That was quick.</i>
<i>-What did you do?</i>

<i>Excuse me?</i>

1252
01:15:10,083 --> 01:15:12,666
<i>You took the company's money</i>
<i>and bought a car!</i>

<i>A bloody car and a shag pad.</i>
<i>[in Zulu] Shame on you.</i>

<i>[in English] It was a loan, Fa--</i>

1255
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:19,791
<i>[angrily] That loan was meant</i>

<i>My brother was in the middle</i>
<i>of helping us build partnership there.</i>

<i>But you wouldn't know that, would you?</i>

1258
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:27,000
<i>[in Zulu] Because you've</i>

<i>[in English] If you paid</i>

<i>Hey! Why are you two</i>

1270
01:15:58,041 --> 01:16:00,875

<i>We should write a letter to her family.</i>

01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:23,291
<i>Is it jealousy?</i>

1277
01:16:24,125 --> 01:16:27,208
<i>That you've never had anyone</i>
