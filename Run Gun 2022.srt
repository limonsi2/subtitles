Wait. Hey!

19
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:25,466
Hey!

20
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,729
Amigo, untie me!

21
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:31,646
Untie me, please.

22
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:36,346
I've pissed off
the Shoemaker enough already.

23
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,218
Yeah, no shit?

24
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:41,873
I know who you are.
You work for her, right?

25
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:46,182
I also work for her, man.
She hates me too, yeah.

26
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:48,228
I lost her dog.

27
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,580
What did you do?

28
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,496
Yeah, a little bit
more than that.

29
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,152
Uh... So...

30
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:01,850
where are we going? America?

31
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:04,069
We?Yeah.

32
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,898
I got family in Texas,
Florida, Des Moines--

33
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:08,291
I was thinking about California.

34
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:10,641
California! Yeah.
I love California.

35
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:12,034
Look, mate--

36
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,254
Lupe. My name is Lupe, yeah.Lupe.

37
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:17,387
I'm sure you'd say anything
to come with me right now,
but I just--

38
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,563
Yeah, you're right about that.
I sure will.

39
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,131
What's your name?

40
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:26,091
I haven't thought of
the new one yet.

41
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,877
Huh?I'm just done.

42
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:31,358
I'm gonna get away
from all this violence.

45
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,457
Yeah, now's good.

46
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:46,721
Good. Good choice,
I-- I like that.

47
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:50,246
You and I, buddy,
we're gonna be great friends.
You know that, right?

48
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,380
Man, I see it, just--
Sunday morning, you know,

49
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:57,340
mimosas for brunch,
you and I driving down PCH

50
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:59,777
in a convertible red Mustang.

51
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,692
[grunts]
We're gonna kill it![gun cocks]

52
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:11,485
My client,
this noble man before you,

53
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:14,226
was burglarized
nearly three months ago.

54
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:18,274
And your office has only paid
a fraction of the damages
incurred.

55
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:20,494
There's no way
I'm gonna take a loss.

56
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:29,111
Tires. My client makes
an honest living selling tires,

57
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:33,202
and your offices
won't promptly step up
and replace his damages.

58
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,683
I ain't gonna take a loss.

59
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:39,164
We're drawing up a massive suit
against Sackman/Burns.

60
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,385
If I were you, I'd be terrified.

61
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:46,433
That's depressing.
Didn't steal enough.

62
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:49,958
Ray...Okay.

63
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,569
You know the saying,

64
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:54,702
"If you owe the bank $100,
it's your problem.

65
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:57,444
But you owe the bank
$100 million,

66
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:59,141
it's the bank's problem"?

67
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,144
Well, if you're gonna steal,
steal big.

68
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:04,755
If you're gonna gamble,
gamble big.

69
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,975
Petty shit
never gets you anywhere.

70
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:12,807
Okay, uh, well, thanks for that.

71
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:14,112
I'll be drafting
a letter today.

72
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:15,375
We'll pay the claim...

73
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:19,814
if you can answer me
just this one question.

74
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:23,470
Now, we agree that this window

75
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:25,994
is the sole entry and exit point
of the burglars?

76
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:27,952
[lawyer laughs]

77
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:30,999
Have I been talking
to myself this whole time?

78
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:33,218
No, no, no.
It's just that...

79
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,092
even a Mini Cooper's tire is
a whole lot wider than that.

80
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,663
Mr. Lopez, I believe you.

81
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:45,274
Somebody broke into your garage,
stole your property,

82
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:49,234
but you might wanna go
over your claim again.

83
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,281
Seems there's some items
on the list that have been

84
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:55,589
previously sold, misplaced,
or overlooked and...

85
00:06:57,721 --> 00:07:00,289
there ain't no way
we're taking the loss.

86
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:03,553
[partner chuckles]

87
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:05,163
Well, all right.

88
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:11,735
[making airplane sounds]

89
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,824
Whoa!

90
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:14,956
[laughing]

91
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,610
That actually got me.

92
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,265
All right, muscles.
You get some sleep.

93
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,484
All right?All right.

94
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,141
See you in a sec.See you.

95
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,363
[theme music plays]

00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:34,932
[TV narrator]
Time is running out
for our Crane Guys.

97
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:37,369
[man on TV] There's
no way. There's no way
we can lift this thing!

98
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:40,851
I don't know if they're gonna
be able to lift this.They always lift it.

99
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:43,898
Yeah, but, babe,
this time they've only got
15 minutes.

100
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,378
Or what happens?

101
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:56,388
You're so smart.I know. Told you.

102
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:59,348
Do I get a cookie?Yeah. Of course
you get a cookie.

103
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:04,048
So good.Yeah, these are the best
part about meeting me.

104
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:06,224
You have the best snacks.Yep.

105
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:14,276
What?You wanna sneak out
to my place?

106
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:16,800
I can't. I have to watch Julian.

107
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:19,760
Well, that's the beauty
of my place.

108
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:22,937
[sighs]

109
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:24,504
Okay, let's go.

110
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:32,076
Wow, really-- Just such class.

111
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,863
I never dreamed I'd be
dating a guy who lived
in a mobile home.

112
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:38,169
Mobile homes
are prefabricated houses

113
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:40,563
and this baby is a motor home.

114
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,565
Oh!

115
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:43,827
Or actually a
recreational vehicle,

116
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,134
since it was built after 1976.

117
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:48,963
It was? Huh!Mmm.

118
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,271
No, no, no, no.

119
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,447
On account of that stuff
being gross.

120
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:57,101
I mean, how can you
eat that stuff?

121
00:08:57,275 --> 00:09:00,888
Because it's delicious
and familiar.

122
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:04,631
Miss it if I stopped.

123
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:06,807
[woman]
Right, well, I understand that.

124
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:08,809
I'm gonna get Julian
hooked on it, though.

125
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,077
You know Julian loves you.

126
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:19,123
And you're a hard guy
to get to really know.

127
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:22,344
You know me.

128
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,476
It's been a year.

129
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,261
Sixteen months.

130
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,306
A great 16 months.

131
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,441
It's just, Julian's starting
to see us as...

132
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:33,790
a family.

133
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,923
And so I'm wondering...

134
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:39,013
are we?

135
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:41,668
I mean,
do you even want a family?

136
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:43,408
Yeah.

137
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:47,543
Yeah, of course, one day.

138
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,114
Well, if you wanted
to move in, that'd be great.

139
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:55,290
If you wanted to move on,
I would be fine.

140
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:58,075
A little wrecked,
but I'd make it.

141
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:01,383
But I just can't break
his little heart.

142
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,649
I do want a family.

143
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,566
Seriously.

144
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,743
Two kids.
You know, boy and a girl.

145
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:19,531
Well, that little guy
would get you halfway there.

146
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,668
[typing]

147
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,544
Man, the tire guy?
That was crazy.

148
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,982
I am definitely mentioning
that in my college classes.

149
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:36,592
Yeah.

150
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:39,116
How do you always
get in their head like that?

151
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,163
It's... It's crazy.
It's almost like
you think like a criminal.

152
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,383
Dude, your talents
are wasted here.

153
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:47,951
I mean, you would kill it
in a poker tournament.

154
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,084
I gave up gambling.

155
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:52,347
Oh. Well, chess!

156
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:53,740
I'm more of a checkers man.

157
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:55,742
There are checkers men?

158
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,266
All right, well, reminds me.Pretty sure.

159
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,791
I do have to get you
to sign my course hours.

160
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:03,837
Your course hours.Yeah.

161
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:06,578
All right!All right.

162
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:10,582
Course hours.

163
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:12,497
[phone rings]

164
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:24,553
Hello?Hey, it's me. Lupe.

165
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,337
What's up, buddy?

166
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:28,209
You still getting out next week?

167
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,994
[Lupe]
I'm not gonna make it
that long, man, okay?

168
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:35,172
I just found out
I got spotted in here
months ago.

169
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:39,437
Um... They waited to tell me,
and for them, it paid off.

170
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:40,917
Paid off? How?

171
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:43,137
[Lupe]
They've seen you visit, Ray.

172
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:46,488
Well, did they follow me home?

173
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:49,752
Well, not them,
because they're in here with me,

174
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:52,537
but the people on the outside,
yeah, probably.

175
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,105
Look, I don't think
the Shoemaker's been told yet.

176
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,716
Why wouldn't she have been told?

177
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,848
There's a price
on both of our heads, Lupe.

178
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:01,285
And I don't need
your bullshit optimism
right now.

179
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:05,028
Look, look.
The spotter's boss
is someone local. Hmm?

180
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:08,379
I just think they want something
in exchange
for not ratting us out.

181
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:10,207
If this gets back down to her,

182
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,862
if she finds out,
then anybody around us
could be--

183
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,995
Dead. Yes, I know.

184
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,040
It's gonna be okay.

185
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:18,781
Just give me some time

186
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,609
and I'll figure out
what they want.

187
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:23,394
Look, I'm sorry, man.

188
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:26,267
Probably wishing you left me
in the desert, huh?

189
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:33,709
Okay. Well, gotta go. Bye.

190
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:00,867
Fuck!

191
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,742
[breathing heavily]

192
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:19,233
[phone rings]

193
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:27,241
[ringing continues]

194
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:48,001
[motorbike approaching]

195
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:08,108
Hey, how are you?

196
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:13,461
You must be Ray, yeah.

197
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:17,073
Name's Perry,
I work for Grayson.
Heard of him?

198
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:22,644
He, um...

199
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:25,473
he wants you at this address.

200
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:28,345
Now.

201
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:33,611
So, uh...

202
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:35,831
if I were you...

203
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,357
I'd get there.

204
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,624
[engine starts]

205
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:58,810
[message notification]

206
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:08,603
[machinery clattering]

207
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:27,317
[indistinct speech]

208
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:28,928
I want my fucking money!

209
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,495
[cracking][man groans]

210
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:33,367
Get that?
I want my fucking money!

211
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:45,248
Hey!

212
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:49,600
See all this?

213
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:51,994
My idea.

214
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,779
I told my brother,

215
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,608
if you ever wanna look like
you're losing a lot of money,

216
00:15:58,522 --> 00:15:59,784
buy a newspaper.

217
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:09,969
You like that, huh?

218
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:12,362
Yeah, me too.

219
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:14,886
I got it at an art fair

220
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:17,498
where they were hawking
turquoise and pottery.

221
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:20,283
Artist was selling it
for a couple of hundred dollars.

222
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:23,634
I said,
"Kid, I'll give you
$10,000 for it."

223
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:25,375
And he looks at me.

224
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:28,465
And I said, "The only caveat is

225
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,903
I get first dibs
on everything you create
from here on out."

226
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,775
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

227
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:36,343
You're thinking a guy like me,
bringing art into the world.

228
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,084
But you gotta remember.

229
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:41,522
The Medicis were criminals,
crooks.

230
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:45,047
And without them,
you never would've had
a Renaissance.

231
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:48,050
Wow, well,
that's a really cool story--

232
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:50,313
Stop it with
the fake American, okay?

233
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,272
I know who you are.
I know your name.

234
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:55,014
Of course,
your reputation precedes you.

235
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:59,409
The Shoemaker
was very secretive,
good at hiding things.

236
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,021
It's a good thing she wasn't
very savvy at finding things,

237
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,761
because you'd be dead,
am I right?

238
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:07,809
If this is a case
of mistaken identity,

239
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:10,159
I can check with her.
I got her number up here.

240
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,130
[phone ringing]

241
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:35,489
[ringing continues]

242
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:44,498
Fine. What's your price?

243
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:47,153
Thank you.

244
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:49,764
My price is you work for me.

245
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:51,635
I'm done with that shit.

246
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:52,854
Really?Really.

247
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:54,160
No kidding!

248
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:57,076
[exclaims] Me too!

249
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,600
After today, I'm pivoting.

250
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:02,864
Gonna tie up some loose ends.

251
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:05,780
The thing is...

252
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:11,177
I've intercepted a package
going to the Shoemaker.

253
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:14,049
It was too important
for me to pass up.
It means everything.

254
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:18,097
It's the world,
and it's gonna be here
in a couple of hours.

255
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:20,447
Now, if the Shoemaker
comes after me,

256
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,537
I want you close.

257
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:26,235
I can't trust
those knuckle-draggers
over there.

258
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:27,976
You know what I mean?

259
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,978
They're not clever like you.

260
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,153
[whistles]

261
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:35,331
All right.
First job, my other place.

262
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:38,029
I have a neighbor.
He won't cut his tree.

263
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:41,032
Now I've given him a chance,
but I'm through talking.

264
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:42,295
Thank you.

265
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,427
You have tools?

266
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,473
I have a new drill,
but I don't like lending it out.

267
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:48,997
Poison.

268
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,087
Drill?

269
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:55,046
You make a little hole,
jam in the poison.

270
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:58,180
Wait, you're blackmailing me
to kill a tree?

271
00:18:58,354 --> 00:18:59,790
Yeah.

272
00:18:59,964 --> 00:19:02,793
What, you think I want you
to poison my neighbor?

273
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:06,754
[all laughing]

274
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:09,931
Right? Hard no.

275
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:12,281
Yeah. Okay,
I thought you'd say that.

276
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,979
Brando, give me your phone,
will you?

277
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,549
Okay, I wanna show you something
that took place
just a little while ago.

278
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:23,162
[Lupe shouting]

279
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:24,337
Stop...

280
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,775
Please, please...

281
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,779
[shouting,
beating sounds continue]

282
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:35,696
[filters popping on]

283
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,394
Aw, Jesus.

284
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:40,440
I must have pressed
the wrong button.

285
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:42,746
But I think
you get the point, right?

286
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:45,662
Weirdest thing to me?

287
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:48,361
How guys have phones in there.

288
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:50,928
But it won't be close
to what the Shoemaker does

289
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:53,844
to him or you
or your loved ones.

290
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:57,805
The woman, Faith, her kid.

291
00:19:58,327 --> 00:19:59,807
Ooh.

292
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,852
What's this?

293
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:05,247
Is this when we get to see
the old Ray
I heard so much about?

294
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:07,945
No, but he's fucking knocking.

295
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,078
All right, all right.
Break it up, you two.

296
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,428
We're on the same team now.

297
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:15,170
I don't see
what the problem is here.
You're gonna be safe with me.

298
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:17,607
I take care of my own.
I'll take care of you.

299
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:23,004
You must really hate this tree.

300
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,399
You're gonna be fun
to have around.

301
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:28,401
Good! Good, good, good!

302
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:31,099
All right. First things first.
Take care of the tree.

303
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,493
Herbicide, it's called.

304
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:36,409
Do your fucking pickup!

305
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:03,218
[motorbike driving]

306
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:12,227
[groaning]

307
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:30,637
[phone rings]

308
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:35,337
[dance music
plays through phone]

309
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:37,600
[Brando]
Ray, the tree can wait.

310
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:40,168
Fucking idiot Perry
dumped his bike
on the way to the pickup.

311
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:45,260
Fucking-- Fucking
dumped his bike.
Forget the tree, just...

312
00:21:45,434 --> 00:21:47,871
[dance music plays
on car stereo]

313
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,541
Subtle.

314
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:07,630
Likewise.

315
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:13,070
440 grand in here.

316
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:17,161
I don't have to tell you
what my brother will have me do
if you run off on us.

317
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:19,947
How's Lupe?

318
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:24,125
Your buddy's in the infirmary.
He'll pull through.

319
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:29,435
Get him a message.You really testing me
right now?

320
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:32,829
You run errands for us,
not the other way.

321
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:34,962
Tell him I'm glad
I didn't leave him.

322
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:38,487
That is as cryptic as hell,
but sure.

323
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:40,315
Fuck it! I'll pass it on!

324
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:46,800
Guy's name is Ninni.

325
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:49,977
It's a public place.
It's called East Jesus.

326
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:54,111
Museum, there's some old junk.

327
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:57,201
Don't worry.
You'll fit right in.

328
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:52,795
[women chatting, laughing]

329
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:55,102
[woman]
Would you rather we start over?

330
00:24:55,276 --> 00:24:56,320
[woman 2] Okay.

331
00:25:01,456 --> 00:25:02,762
All right.

332
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:04,415
Not yet.

333
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:18,038
Fuck.

334
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:20,127
Isn't ketchup water the worst?

335
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,651
Mmm.

336
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:24,523
[continues squeezing ketchup]

337
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,350
Yeah.

338
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,266
You know what I think about
when I eat chicken?

339
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,617
I think
how this used to be a T. rex.

340
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:36,970
Millions of years ago,
this guy's ancestor

341
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:40,408
was the most fearsome thing
to ever walk on land.

342
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,323
Then catastrophe hits.

343
00:25:42,497 --> 00:25:44,455
And they had to shrink down,

344
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,676
evolve to this miserable
little creature,

345
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:52,725
so weak that its very name
means "coward."

346
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:54,248
[Ray] Ah.

347
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:56,337
[chuckles]

348
00:25:57,947 --> 00:26:02,648
Yeah, I see what you did there.
That was-- That was
very clever, yeah.

349
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:06,608
Now we're gonna make this
exchange, or I'm just
gonna fucking take it from you.

350
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:11,744
You do have some balls.

351
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:13,963
You wanna find out?

352
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:16,270
[woman]
Excuse me, boys!

353
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:19,839
Do you guys mind moving
out of the way,
maybe somewhere over there?

354
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:23,059
Please? Thanks.

355
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:25,584
All right, how's my hair?

356
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:29,588
Do we...

357
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:35,550
Do you wanna grab yours
and I'll grab mine?

358
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,166
Grayson won't even tell
his own brother what that is.

359
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:48,519
But Grayson loves a deal,
so it must be something big,

360
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:51,087
bigger than the 440
he's paying for it.

361
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:54,177
You got a guess?

362
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:58,617
You know, I've evolved
to be less curious.

363
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:01,010
[laughs]

364
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,362
I ain't done.

365
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:07,887
Yeah, you are.

366
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:10,411
[clicks tongue]

367
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:40,484
[pats bag]

368
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:42,356
[chuckles]

369
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,227
[phone rings]

370
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:49,058
Oh.

371
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:52,583
Hey, babe! Hey.

372
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:54,107
Tried you at work.

373
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:57,371
Yeah, I'm... I'm not there.

374
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,416
I know. I can hear you driving.

375
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,985
So, where are you driving off to
in the middle of a Tuesday, Ray?

376
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:05,988
You know, nowhere much. Just...

377
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:08,512
nowhere much.

378
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,125
Something came up,
but I'm working on it.

379
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:14,823
Are you running, Ray?

380
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:18,000
[pop, hissing]

381
00:28:18,174 --> 00:28:19,567
I gotta call you back, okay?

382
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,743
Think I just got a flat tire.

383
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:24,050
Yeah.

384
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:39,674
[air hissing]

385
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:03,872
[carnival horn
honking in background]

386
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,407
[reggae playing from vehicle]

387
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:48,612
[grunts]

388
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:56,795
Throw it in the Jeep!

389
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:59,319
[gunshot]

390
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:15,465
It goes under the road!
Go back up!

391
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,776
[gunshot]

392
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:26,955
[gunshot]

393
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:29,828
[tires screeching]

394
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:39,838
[gunshots]

395
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:43,232
[gun clicks]

396
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:48,977
[pants]

397
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:50,761
Oh, man!

398
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:55,679
[grunts]

399
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,726
Okay, okay...

400
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:24,099
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

401
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:27,059
A little bit further.
Come on, mate.
Come on, mate.

402
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:37,808
Okay.

403
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:47,862
[engine stops]

404
00:31:55,174 --> 00:31:56,436
[grunting]

405
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:40,959
Okay.

406
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:52,144
Okay.

407
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:24,350
[classical music plays]What an idiot.

408
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:26,047
[Perry breathing heavily]

409
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:28,397
[ringtone plays]

410
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:30,356
Ray?

411
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:32,880
Woman I've been chasing.

412
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:34,925
Well, you know what they say.

413
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,232
Man chases a woman
until she catches him.

414
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:41,019
Hey, baby.

415
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:44,152
It's bad.

416
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,676
How bad?He got away.

417
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,330
He what?

418
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:50,332
With the money or the pickup?

419
00:33:50,506 --> 00:33:52,334
Both.Both?

420
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:55,859
Yeah, both days are good.

421
00:33:57,731 --> 00:33:59,515
What the fuck?

422
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:02,562
Unlike Perry,
this guy really knows
how to handle himself.

423
00:34:02,736 --> 00:34:05,478
You were supposed to be able
to handle yourself.

424
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:10,135
You and your brother need
to make Ray disappear.

425
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:12,050
My brother's dead.

426
00:34:13,616 --> 00:34:15,488
Shit!

427
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:17,577
Well, that makes things
a little harder.

428
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:20,971
I have never seen my brother

429
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:23,713
as excited about anything
as he is about this.

430
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:25,628
Must be a fortune.

431
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:27,804
I think I've figured out
which way this asshole went.

432
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:29,893
You better.

433
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,592
Otherwise, we're both fucked.

434
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:36,161
Both of us? Yeah, Ninni. Handle this.

435
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:38,641
Or he's gonna slit
both of our throats.

436
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:40,469
Come on! Enough already!

437
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:42,776
Yeah, baby, I gotta go.

438
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:45,996
Fuck.

439
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:51,219
[Grayson]
All right, come on. Let's go.Where are we going?

440
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:52,916
Ray's house.

441
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,441
Just in case he gets
any ideas about running away.

442
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:16,462
[hornets buzzing]

443
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:25,514
[grunting, panting]

444
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:32,130
Oh, Yes! Fuck yes!

445
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:42,662
[grunting]

446
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:44,316
No fucking handles.

447
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:58,199
[man] Do you have a gun?No!

448
00:36:00,114 --> 00:36:04,553
No, I'm just trying
to buy this car.
It's beautiful. What is it, '78?

449
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:07,600
[lisps]
It's not mine to sell.Okay.

450
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:10,298
Do you have a car?

451
00:36:10,864 --> 00:36:12,518
[laughing]

452
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:14,128
Well, you're not picky.

453
00:36:15,347 --> 00:36:17,305
I'll also pay you
to use a phone.

454
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:20,090
No, I don't have a phone.
But I got a radio.

455
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,530
It's for the police.
Here, you wanna call 'em?

456
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:27,359
Oh...

457
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:28,838
What happened?

458
00:36:29,012 --> 00:36:30,188
[sighs]

459
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:32,625
I was cleaning my shotgun and--

460
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:34,801
Wait. I thought you said
you didn't have a gun.

461
00:36:34,975 --> 00:36:37,412
Oh, no. I don't have a gun here.

462
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:38,892
I don't have a gun here.

463
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:43,288
Look...

464
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,291
I'd like to invite you in,
but...

465
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,163
you seem like a certain type.

466
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,559
Little rough. No nonsense?

467
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:55,213
I'm not rough.

468
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:57,258
Some nonsense, but...

469
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:02,916
Come on.

470
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:12,012
Oh, hey, stay away
from that area.
It's falling apart.

471
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:13,709
It's okay, mate.

472
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:17,278
I don't wanna know.What?

473
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:20,063
I'm just saying
I don't care
what you do out here.

474
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:24,981
I'm sure lots of people
around these parts cook,
you know, stuff.

475
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:26,722
I don't judge.

476
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:28,202
You mean meth?

477
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:30,726
Oh! No,
that's not my thing.

478
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,338
No, I say no to drugs.Me too.

479
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:35,340
I'm a beer guy.

480
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:38,038
Beer, yeah.Hey, come on.
I'll show you my man cave.

481
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:39,169
[laughing]

482
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:40,432
Yeah.

483
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:43,478
Boom!

484
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,873
Here's my man cave! [laughing]

485
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:49,919
Wow.

486
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:52,966
So you live here?

487
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,316
Yeah. Just for now, yeah.

488
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,579
Why? Where do you live?

489
00:37:58,754 --> 00:38:00,452
An old RV.

490
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:03,106
What? Really?Yeah.

491
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,500
You know what really bugs me?

492
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:08,373
It's when people call 'em
"motor homes" instead of
"recreational vehicles."

493
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:11,071
Yes. Yes!But what's even worse

494
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:12,986
is when older people
call them all...

495
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,032
Winnebagos!Winnebagos! Yeah.

496
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:18,339
Hey, my buds call me Billings.

497
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:19,949
I'm Ray.

498
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:26,739
Oh, yeah, part
of the job description
is killing pests.

499
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:29,481
Shoot 'em,
blow up any gopher holes.

500
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:31,657
This right here
is called varmint killer.

501
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:34,529
[high pitched groan]

502
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:37,097
You-- You good there, mate?Yeah, yeah.

503
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:39,578
It's just I'm out here
in the middle of nowhere
using words like "varmint"

504
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:40,883
like I'm Yosemite Sam.

505
00:38:41,754 --> 00:38:42,755
Well...

506
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,148
Hmm!

507
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:49,544
You know, I thought
I was headed towards
a better life myself, but...

508
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:52,982
Well, delivery driver's
due this afternoon.

509
00:38:53,156 --> 00:38:55,289
[echoing]
Maybe they can take you
to the next town.

510
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:57,639
That or a phone.Hey. Hey.

511
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:02,035
[echoing] I'm
telling you, bro,
that shit's gotta come out.

512
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:04,690
[grunts]

513
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:07,823
My grandmammy told me
that the toughest asshole

514
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:11,174
can be taken down
by the tiniest piece of metal.

515
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:13,612
It's hospital or me.

516
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:15,788
You choose.

517
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:19,487
All right.

518
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:22,098
Yeah, come on!
Do-si-do. Here's my partner.

519
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:24,840
Hey, watch my collectibles.

520
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:33,545
[Grayson]
This is Ray's life?

521
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:38,288
That's depressing.

522
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:41,466
I hate it when good things
happen to bad people.

523
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:44,251
World's gone nuts.

524
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:47,515
So, if he has
skipped town on us,
what do you wanna do?

525
00:39:47,689 --> 00:39:49,604
Well, the ancient Romans
used to take a guy,

526
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:52,999
put him in a sack with a dog,
a snake, and a monkey.

527
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:54,827
And just dump 'em in the river.

528
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:59,092
But we don't have
any of those things.

529
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,445
[ringtone plays]

530
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:08,057
Not Ray.

531
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,495
Hey, baby!

532
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:13,976
There were some tracks.

533
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,804
They're gone now.

534
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:17,850
Sending you a map
of my location.

535
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:20,026
Can't be far.

536
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,638
Okay, baby. I gotta go, though.

537
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:33,648
You sure you don't want
any anesthesia?

538
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:36,303
I really recommend it.No, I can't.

539
00:40:37,347 --> 00:40:39,828
I have to stay conscious,

540
00:40:40,002 --> 00:40:41,177
get back.

541
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:43,397
You have-- You have an RV.

542
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:47,009
Where do you have to
get back to?

543
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:50,012
I got a tree to poison.

544
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,494
It's a long story.

545
00:40:57,063 --> 00:41:00,327
[Grayson] I knew I should have
done this myself.
I can't trust anybody else.

546
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:01,720
All right.

547
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:03,504
We'll come back
for the broad later.

548
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:05,463
Okay, Perry, drive.
Salton Sea.

549
00:41:05,637 --> 00:41:07,465
I'll handle it.
You stay here.

550
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:09,554
I'm sorry, what?

551
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:12,992
What did you say,
little brother?
You'll handle it?

552
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:14,689
What, you running things now?

553
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:17,431
I said I'll handle it.

554
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:20,434
It's too valuable.Well, how much is it?

555
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:23,045
Fuck the money.
It's the package.

556
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:24,569
Well, what's in the package?

557
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:26,353
You'll see.

558
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:29,878
Along with
the rest of the world.

559
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,100
[engine starts]

560
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,017
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

561
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:41,194
Thank you.You're welcome.

562
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:43,979
Seems like you would know.

563
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:47,679
Those other wounds.

564
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:49,811
Where'd they come from?

565
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:53,119
I'd rather forget.

566
00:41:54,642 --> 00:41:56,078
I hear you.

567
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:03,346
A few years ago,
I fell off a ladder
putting up the Christmas lights

568
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:09,048
and I-- I broke the nerves
in this hand.

569
00:42:09,222 --> 00:42:11,354
I can--
I can barely feel this hand.

570
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,531
Except for some nights...

571
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:16,534
you won't believe this,
it itches.

572
00:42:22,104 --> 00:42:23,976
Hmm.

573
00:42:27,675 --> 00:42:28,894
Okay, okay.

574
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:31,331
Go slow, go slow.Yeah, yeah.

575
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:33,725
[groaning]

576
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:36,292
[exhales]

577
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:41,036
So, what do I owe you
for the patch?No, nothing. Nothing.

578
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,560
Mm-mmm.

579
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,476
I don't like to owe.

580
00:42:49,305 --> 00:42:51,699
Let me buy the 'Vette.

581
00:42:51,873 --> 00:42:55,573
I'll give you 20 grand for it.I told you.
It's not mine to sell.

582
00:42:55,747 --> 00:42:57,879
You're killing me, Billings.
Come on.

583
00:42:59,707 --> 00:43:04,799
Well, the patch
may have been free,
but for the bottle.

584
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:07,410
Take it.

585
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:09,456
Rest a bit.

586
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:12,328
You rest.

587
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:30,477
[Brando]
East Jesus is not so far.

588
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:32,479
We should get back to the car.

589
00:43:34,002 --> 00:43:35,787
I wanted to see this.

590
00:43:38,311 --> 00:43:40,879
You know this lake
was made by accident?

591
00:43:41,053 --> 00:43:43,882
Dam broke,
filled it with water.

592
00:43:44,056 --> 00:43:46,319
When I was a kid,
this was a huge
tourist destination.

593
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:48,234
Now, look at it. It's poison.

594
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:51,019
It stinks.
It's rotten.

595
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,369
It's depressing.

596
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,679
Nothing to be done.
It's the way of things.

597
00:44:00,246 --> 00:44:02,509
Call it what you want,
entropy, whatever.

598
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:06,600
Our world is decaying
right before our eyes,

599
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:08,646
aging, dying.

600
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:12,737
It's going so fast,
we don't even notice it.

601
00:44:14,347 --> 00:44:16,349
I noticed
it's getting worse out there.

602
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,178
Everybody's
at each other's throats.

603
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:22,790
That's different, okay?
That's not our fault.

604
00:44:22,964 --> 00:44:27,055
That's 'cause of something
that happened ten years ago.Like what?

605
00:44:27,229 --> 00:44:30,755
All right, I'm gonna
tell you something that
I haven't told anybody, okay?

606
00:44:30,929 --> 00:44:32,626
This is really important to me.

607
00:44:34,454 --> 00:44:37,022
You ever hear of
the Mandela Effect?

608
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:40,199
You're gonna tell me
anyway, so--Shut up, asshole. Just listen.

609
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:47,380
It's named after the fact
that millions upon millions
of people swear

610
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:51,689
that Nelson Mandela passed away
in prison in the 1980s.

611
00:44:51,863 --> 00:44:56,084
So there's a discrepancy
between historical record

612
00:44:56,258 --> 00:44:58,391
and what people remember.

613
00:44:58,565 --> 00:45:02,221
And there are countless
examples of it, especially
in popular culture, okay?

614
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:04,136
Um, um, um...

615
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:08,053
Darth Vader never said,
"Luke, I am your father," okay?

616
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:12,448
Hannibal Lecter in
Silence of the Lambs
never said, "Hello, Clarice."

617
00:45:12,622 --> 00:45:16,104
The Monopoly Man, okay?
The Monopoly Man
never wore a monocle.

618
00:45:16,278 --> 00:45:19,891
An eyepiece. Yeah, he did--Yeah, yeah. No, he didn't.

619
00:45:20,065 --> 00:45:25,287
The theory is, ten years ago,
we split into a parallel
universe, a darker one.

620
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:26,854
Franky, what the fuck
are you talking about?

621
00:45:27,028 --> 00:45:30,075
No, no, no!
I'm not alone on this, okay?

622
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:34,253
The effect explains
why society is acting so crazy,

623
00:45:34,427 --> 00:45:36,864
why it's become
so divisive, okay?

624
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:40,912
Multiverses or time travelers
or powers beyond our control

625
00:45:41,086 --> 00:45:42,740
are making us act this way.

626
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:44,872
It's not our fault!
We're being manipulated!

627
00:45:45,046 --> 00:45:48,006
People think that it's hackers
or that it's propaganda...

628
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,311
Son of a bitch....and it's not.

629
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:50,878
I know!I could've sworn

630
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:52,967
he was wearing an eyepiece!Okay, here's one!

631
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:55,753
And I swear to God this is true!

632
00:45:55,927 --> 00:45:58,625
You remember
the comedian Sinbad, right?

633
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:01,933
Okay, Sinbad made a movie
about a genie.

634
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:04,849
Now I saw this movie!
Do you understand me?

635
00:46:05,023 --> 00:46:09,027
Now people are saying
it was never made,
but I'm telling you I saw it!

636
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:10,855
I can see it in my mind's eye!

637
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:13,248
I can see it
at the video store on the shelf!

638
00:46:13,422 --> 00:46:14,946
I believe you, boss.Will you shut up?

639
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,513
Shut up!
I'm talking to
my fucking brother!

640
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:19,124
Get out of here!

641
00:46:19,298 --> 00:46:20,516
Get out of here!

642
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,041
Jesus! Goddamn it!

643
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:32,572
Listen, you've no doubt noticed
that I got a lot going on,
right?

644
00:46:32,746 --> 00:46:34,966
And I want you to know
that I appreciate everything
you're doing,

645
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,011
the way that you're handling
everything you're handling.

646
00:46:37,185 --> 00:46:38,796
You've been a real partner.

647
00:46:39,971 --> 00:46:41,407
You've been a brother.

648
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:46,238
In a couple of days,
this will all be over,
and we'll talk.

649
00:46:48,893 --> 00:46:50,808
Come on. Let's go.

650
00:46:57,379 --> 00:46:58,598
[sighs]

651
00:47:13,308 --> 00:47:15,093
Hey, I think you
locked the door.

652
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:17,443
Billings!

653
00:47:17,617 --> 00:47:19,140
I asked you to rest.

654
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:21,490
Is that why you locked me in?

655
00:47:21,664 --> 00:47:24,232
[speaking without lisp]
I can't be letting you leave
just quite yet now, can I?

656
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:27,409
Wait a minute.
Your accent just changed.

657
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,500
Your whole thing just changed.

658
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:35,287
Well, you show up shot,

659
00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:37,550
$20,000 on you.

660
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:40,509
Gotta be more to this story.

661
00:47:42,511 --> 00:47:44,339
Okay, well, how's this?

662
00:47:44,513 --> 00:47:49,692
Story's over, and you just
made yourself 20 grand.
Sound good?

663
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:53,609
Where there's 20 grand,
I'll wager there is more.

664
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:55,655
Lots more.

665
00:47:57,918 --> 00:47:59,354
You played me.

666
00:48:02,096 --> 00:48:04,707
You waited till
I dropped my guard,
and you played me.

667
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,884
I been waiting too long, son.

668
00:48:08,363 --> 00:48:10,148
Waiting my whole fucking life.

669
00:48:11,366 --> 00:48:12,672
You know, they lie to you.

670
00:48:12,846 --> 00:48:14,326
They tell you,
if you just hang in there,

671
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,763
the world's
gonna give you your break,

672
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,286
your turn.

673
00:48:19,374 --> 00:48:20,854
But it doesn't.

674
00:48:23,204 --> 00:48:26,816
You gotta take everything
you can get,
so here I am.

675
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:28,906
Taking.

676
00:48:30,342 --> 00:48:33,998
Well, before you take from me,

677
00:48:34,172 --> 00:48:36,739
just know that people
have killed for that money.

678
00:48:38,611 --> 00:48:40,918
I've killed for that money.

679
00:48:43,311 --> 00:48:44,312
Wait here.

680
00:48:46,314 --> 00:48:47,315
No!

681
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:50,405
Open the fucking door, Billings!

682
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:52,712
Billings!

683
00:48:54,714 --> 00:48:56,455
Fuck! Okay...

684
00:49:20,479 --> 00:49:22,089
[grunts]

685
00:49:34,754 --> 00:49:35,929
Fuck!

686
00:49:45,547 --> 00:49:47,158
[cocks gun]

687
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:59,257
Okay. Drink up, bitch.

688
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:04,305
Okay.

689
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:18,754
Okay, okay.

690
00:50:20,104 --> 00:50:21,888
Another fucking lock.

691
00:50:22,454 --> 00:50:23,542
Okay.

692
00:50:40,602 --> 00:50:41,777
[chuckles]

693
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:44,128
Ray, you should know
that I'm armed.

694
00:50:47,566 --> 00:50:49,263
All right. I'm coming in, Ray.

695
00:50:51,787 --> 00:50:53,267
[screams]

696
00:50:58,316 --> 00:51:01,014
[Ray screaming]

697
00:51:01,188 --> 00:51:04,800
[singing]
I keep some traps out here, Ray,

698
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:07,281
but you know that now

699
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:09,979
'cause you don't need your legs

700
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:12,069
to show me
where the money's at, Ray.

701
00:51:12,243 --> 00:51:14,506
You thought
we were playing checkers,

702
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,465
I was playing chess.

703
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:21,078
I'm really fucking good
at checkers!

704
00:51:21,252 --> 00:51:22,514
[grunts]

705
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,388
[grunting]

706
00:51:29,042 --> 00:51:31,044
[panting]

707
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:41,533
[grunting]

708
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:48,670
[coughing]

709
00:51:49,497 --> 00:51:50,977
Bags. Where?

710
00:51:52,457 --> 00:51:55,155
We gotta go.Sure, I'm gonna send you.

711
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:57,026
But first, where are the bags?

712
00:51:57,201 --> 00:52:02,467
Look, you know I've gotta bring
Grayson the pickup, but...

713
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:07,994
I'll give you the rest
of the cash,
and let's call it even.

714
00:52:08,168 --> 00:52:10,736
We ain't yet even
for my brother.

715
00:52:12,694 --> 00:52:14,261
Both bags. Where?

716
00:52:15,654 --> 00:52:16,959
There. Look!

717
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,875
It's there?
Well, let me just turn around.

718
00:52:20,049 --> 00:52:22,443
Yes! Turn the fuck around!
Oh!

719
00:52:22,617 --> 00:52:24,141
Cutting me out of negotiations?

720
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:26,926
You wanna make a deal?

721
00:52:27,753 --> 00:52:29,233
Try to cut me out?

722
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:41,158
[gunshot]

723
00:52:42,115 --> 00:52:43,986
I'm shooting to wound, Ray.

724
00:52:45,205 --> 00:52:46,293
Trying to.

725
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:00,742
One way in,
one way out of there!

726
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,269
[phone ringing]

727
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:10,796
[ringing continues]

728
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,632
Hello?

729
00:53:20,806 --> 00:53:22,242
[Faith] Hello?

730
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:24,331
This is Dr. Topaz.

731
00:53:25,158 --> 00:53:26,638
Dr. To--

732
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,553
I'm sorry, do I--

733
00:53:30,424 --> 00:53:31,338
Is Ray there?

734
00:53:31,512 --> 00:53:32,992
I'm afraid to tell you

735
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:34,776
that Ray was in an accident.

736
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:37,214
It involved
a recreational vehicle.

737
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:39,738
I-Is he all right?

738
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:42,088
Sir, I'm his--
I'm his girlfriend.
I'm Faith Dryer.

739
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:46,310
Well, Ms. Dryer,
he wouldn't be in a hospital

740
00:53:46,484 --> 00:53:48,660
if he were all right.Fuck, fuck, fuck. No.

741
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:50,662
No, Faith, no!

742
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:52,229
He's limping along.

743
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:55,754
[roars]

744
00:53:56,972 --> 00:53:59,758
Okay, well,
we're at the end of a dirt road.

745
00:54:00,454 --> 00:54:01,673
[grunts]

746
00:54:03,588 --> 00:54:05,459
How stat can you be here?

747
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:09,028
Um... two hours.
I just-- I have to get a sitter.

748
00:54:09,202 --> 00:54:11,422
Okay. See you soon, Ms. Dryer.

749
00:54:12,423 --> 00:54:14,381
Be quick, but don't hurry.

750
00:54:15,034 --> 00:54:16,122
Okay.

751
00:54:18,864 --> 00:54:22,520
Two hours,
she's gonna drive right to me.

752
00:54:24,173 --> 00:54:29,570
Unless you wanna tell me
where the money
and this pickup bag is.

753
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,226
I can give you
the rest of the cash.

754
00:54:34,706 --> 00:54:36,621
Another 420 grand!

755
00:54:37,404 --> 00:54:38,666
Whoo!

756
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,538
Now we're cooking with gas!

757
00:54:40,712 --> 00:54:42,714
And what of this talk
of your pickup?

758
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:45,543
I can't give you the pickup!You can't?

759
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:46,935
If I don't go back
with the pickup,

760
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:48,154
then my li--

761
00:54:49,677 --> 00:54:52,027
my family's life...

762
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:55,161
it won't be worth a thing.

763
00:54:55,335 --> 00:54:57,337
Well, your life
isn't worth much right now.

764
00:54:59,426 --> 00:55:03,038
I'm sorry.
That sounded cynical.

765
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:08,087
So we making a deal or what?

766
00:55:08,261 --> 00:55:10,698
Tell me where it is.I'll go get it.

767
00:55:10,872 --> 00:55:12,309
Hmm.

768
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:16,530
Because the cash
and this other bag

769
00:55:16,704 --> 00:55:18,445
are in the same spot, huh?

770
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:21,405
And I gotta guess,
whatever it is,

771
00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:23,320
it's worth about the same
as the money, right?

772
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:25,931
It was a trade, correct?

773
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:29,587
Just give me ten minutes
to go get it.

774
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:33,982
I can trust you
and maybe get half the wealth.

775
00:55:34,156 --> 00:55:36,550
Or I could torture you
and get it all.

776
00:55:36,724 --> 00:55:39,597
Hmm, I think I'll go with B,

777
00:55:39,771 --> 00:55:41,338
torture, all.

778
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,514
[groans]

779
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:53,828
It's a matter of time, Ray!

780
00:56:03,621 --> 00:56:05,318
Got you, motherfucker.

781
00:56:12,325 --> 00:56:15,154
Ugh!I see it now,

782
00:56:15,328 --> 00:56:18,549
the Yosemite Sam resemblance,
uncanny.

783
00:56:18,723 --> 00:56:21,116
You fucking poisoned me?Maybe.

784
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:23,945
Gambling it works
on people, but...

785
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:25,382
[groans]

786
00:56:26,992 --> 00:56:28,254
You're dead!

787
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:29,777
I'm not sure
you got the time, bud!

788
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,344
I'll fucking kill you, man!

789
00:56:31,518 --> 00:56:35,174
[gagging, spitting]

790
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:38,395
You're dead!

791
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,399
I'll fucking kill you
and your girl!

792
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,493
Okay. Where's the gun?

793
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:52,060
[Billings retching]

794
00:57:17,956 --> 00:57:19,784
[handle rattling]

795
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:21,394
[grunts]

796
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,149
[Billings]
Goddamn it, Ray!

797
00:58:32,683 --> 00:58:34,336
[chain jangles]

798
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:39,864
[grunts]

799
00:58:40,038 --> 00:58:41,692
Oh, my God.
Are you okay--

800
00:58:41,866 --> 00:58:43,432
[screams] Fuck!

801
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:45,217
[Ray yells
in distance]

802
00:58:46,697 --> 00:58:48,394
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

803
00:58:59,013 --> 00:59:00,754
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

804
00:59:00,928 --> 00:59:02,800
Sure, you will.
You're here to take me.

805
00:59:02,974 --> 00:59:05,585
Take you?
No, I want out of here too.

806
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:08,719
[Billings] Ray!

807
00:59:09,937 --> 00:59:11,591
He's looking for me.

808
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,945
Okay.

809
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:24,430
[grunts]

810
00:59:26,475 --> 00:59:29,217
The name's Ray.
What's yours?

811
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:31,219
What are we, friends?

812
00:59:33,221 --> 00:59:34,745
Common enemy?

813
00:59:36,268 --> 00:59:38,052
Yeah, he did that to you?

814
00:59:38,226 --> 00:59:40,707
Some of it. Look.

815
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:43,971
I got a woman
and her kid waiting for me.

816
00:59:45,712 --> 00:59:47,801
The thought of not
seeing them again hurts
more than any of this.

817
00:59:47,975 --> 00:59:52,153
So you'd better believe
I'm getting out of this
hell hole and back to them.

818
00:59:52,327 --> 00:59:54,765
Okay? Okay.

819
00:59:54,939 --> 00:59:58,290
Tara, I've-- I've been here
five days, I think. Um...

820
00:59:59,334 --> 01:00:00,901
He grabbed me off the road.

821
01:00:06,994 --> 01:00:08,996
What, were you
running away from home?

822
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:11,042
I never really had a home
to run away from.

823
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:17,265
Well, you know,
you shouldn't hitchhike.

824
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:19,354
I didn't.

825
01:00:20,442 --> 01:00:23,620
Good, because...
you shouldn't.

826
01:00:25,056 --> 01:00:27,362
Maybe you're about done?Yeah. [clears throat]

827
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:29,147
[sign thuds]

828
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,197
[vehicle approaches outside]

829
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:42,639
[horn honks]

830
01:00:42,813 --> 01:00:44,553
[honking continues]

831
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:46,164
Ah, shit!

832
01:00:46,904 --> 01:00:48,166
I think that's for me.

833
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:50,690
He said that he's expecting
a truck to come,

834
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:53,171
but I don't know
where it's going.

835
01:00:56,391 --> 01:01:00,613
Doesn't matter. 'Cause you ain't
never getting on it, all right?

836
01:01:03,834 --> 01:01:05,052
Come on, come on...

837
01:01:09,317 --> 01:01:11,189
Any problems?Not a one!

838
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,714
You're early.Yeah, by, like, two minutes.

839
01:01:14,888 --> 01:01:16,673
That's right. That's okay.

840
01:01:16,847 --> 01:01:19,632
You just wait right here.
I'll go get her.

841
01:01:19,806 --> 01:01:22,722
No, I'd like to see
what I'm picking up
before I pick it up.

842
01:01:23,636 --> 01:01:25,203
No problem.
You're the expert.

843
01:01:25,377 --> 01:01:27,727
Come on. Come on in.

844
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:29,729
Please don't leave me.

845
01:01:29,903 --> 01:01:32,993
I'm not gonna leave you,
because we're both
getting out of here.

846
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:34,778
[distant chatter]

847
01:01:34,952 --> 01:01:37,041
But, first--
first, I gotta leave you.

848
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:38,695
No! [grunts]

849
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:40,522
Shh. Trust me.

850
01:01:55,624 --> 01:01:58,540
Ah. There she is.
[chuckles]

851
01:02:05,983 --> 01:02:08,637
Are you okay?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

852
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:10,509
Okay?How much is she worth?

853
01:02:10,683 --> 01:02:12,424
Well, I'm not gonna
inspect her teeth.

854
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:16,863
It's okay.

855
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:19,300
Bring her upstairs.

856
01:02:22,173 --> 01:02:25,132
Come on. Come on.

857
01:03:06,957 --> 01:03:08,785
When you load her, lock her up.

858
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:11,613
And hurry up.
I got a long drive.

859
01:03:12,223 --> 01:03:13,224
Yes, ma'am.

860
01:03:15,966 --> 01:03:17,924
Wait, wait. You hear something?

861
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:20,100
[rumbling, clattering]

862
01:03:32,156 --> 01:03:33,766
[hornets buzzing]

863
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:36,116
[screaming]

864
01:03:37,335 --> 01:03:39,076
[groans]

865
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,992
Get the fuck back!
Get the fuck back! You okay?

866
01:04:03,056 --> 01:04:04,144
Don't scream.

867
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:05,711
[grunts]

868
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:07,495
Why did you cover my mouth?

869
01:04:07,669 --> 01:04:09,802
I thought that would work.
I'm sorry.

870
01:04:13,153 --> 01:04:15,068
Look.They'll find us by the car.

871
01:04:15,242 --> 01:04:16,678
And they'll find us
in the desert.

872
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,332
We need to double back
for the car.

873
01:04:18,506 --> 01:04:20,508
And then I'm gonna take you
anywhere you wanna go.

874
01:04:20,682 --> 01:04:21,683
Name it.

875
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,294
[grunts]

876
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:26,123
I've been squatting
over in Slab City.

877
01:04:26,297 --> 01:04:28,038
I should be okay there.

878
01:04:29,735 --> 01:04:32,564
Well, we'll worry
about that later.

879
01:04:33,782 --> 01:04:34,696
Can you run?

880
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,350
Can you run?No.

881
01:04:36,524 --> 01:04:38,178
But I am gonna hobble like hell.

882
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:40,354
Wait.

883
01:04:41,268 --> 01:04:42,530
Not just yet.

884
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,754
I should have told you
about him.

885
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:51,191
Very unprofessional of me.

886
01:04:51,365 --> 01:04:55,195
But don't worry.
Neither of them
can get too far.

887
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:57,197
I can fix this.

888
01:04:57,371 --> 01:04:59,808
Yeah. You've done
a bang-up job so far.

889
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:02,637
Hey, they're definitely
in here.

890
01:05:03,595 --> 01:05:05,162
Lot of reasons
to be careful.

891
01:05:05,336 --> 01:05:06,728
Look at my face.

892
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,818
This was supposed to
be fucking simple.

893
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:12,082
I wanna get the
fuck out of here.

894
01:05:16,303 --> 01:05:17,435
Wait. There's blood.

895
01:05:17,609 --> 01:05:19,437
[metal clanking]

896
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,921
Just follow my lead.

897
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:32,754
Come here.

898
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:36,802
Okay, three--

899
01:05:36,976 --> 01:05:40,197
No! Two, one.

900
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,202
[gasps and screams]

901
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:50,076
[sobbing]

902
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,643
What is this
doing here?

903
01:05:51,817 --> 01:05:53,514
He must have moved it.

904
01:05:53,688 --> 01:05:56,561
I keep some traps
around for protection.

905
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:59,651
Oh, my God. Help me.
Can you help me right now?

906
01:06:00,434 --> 01:06:01,609
[screaming]

907
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:03,960
[phone rings]Shh, shh, shh. Hello?

908
01:06:04,134 --> 01:06:06,092
Doctor here.Dr. Topaz?

909
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:07,702
[woman] Help me![Billings] Speaking.

910
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:09,226
Hi. It's Faith Dryer.
I'm calling about--

911
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,316
Ray, yes, yes.
Well, it's a pleasure

912
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,405
to hear from you again,
Ms. Dryer.

913
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:16,755
[woman screaming
through phone]

914
01:06:16,929 --> 01:06:18,626
Sorry, what was that
in the background?

915
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,238
[woman] Oh, my God!Hold one moment, please?

916
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:23,370
[woman] Oh, my God.
Help me, fucking idiot.

917
01:06:27,331 --> 01:06:29,072
[Billings]
I'm back.[chuckles]

918
01:06:29,246 --> 01:06:31,204
Can you hear me now? Yes, thank you.

919
01:06:31,378 --> 01:06:32,684
How's Ray?

920
01:06:32,858 --> 01:06:34,773
[Billings sighs]
I have to admit,

921
01:06:34,947 --> 01:06:37,341
he's doing much better
than I expected.

922
01:06:37,515 --> 01:06:38,820
The guy won't quit.

923
01:06:40,909 --> 01:06:42,520
Do you have your ETA?

924
01:06:42,694 --> 01:06:44,130
Uh, we are about...

925
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:46,915
30 minutes away.We?

926
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:50,180
Yeah, my son.
I couldn't get a sitter.

927
01:06:50,354 --> 01:06:52,399
No problem whatsoever.
I'll tell you what.

928
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:54,836
I will send a security guard
to meet you.

929
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,795
He's a burly man with a beard.

930
01:06:56,969 --> 01:06:59,232
Okay, thank you.

931
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:06,500
You good?Okay, yeah, yeah. Go!

932
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:13,812
Oh! Fuck this. Stand back.

933
01:07:25,737 --> 01:07:27,086
[tires screech]

934
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:41,274
[beep][car lock chirps]

935
01:07:41,448 --> 01:07:43,668
No, no, no, no!

936
01:07:43,842 --> 01:07:46,149
Remote shut-off. Shit! Shit!

937
01:07:46,323 --> 01:07:48,107
He told me this wasn't his car!

938
01:07:51,806 --> 01:07:53,634
[fires shot]

939
01:07:55,854 --> 01:07:58,639
[fires shot]Go! Just run! Just run!

940
01:08:02,165 --> 01:08:03,601
[fires shot]

941
01:08:10,564 --> 01:08:12,305
Go, go! Go, Tara.

942
01:08:12,479 --> 01:08:15,569
Go, go, go, go, go! Run! Run!

943
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,615
Run, Tara, run!

944
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:18,833
[gunshot]

945
01:08:19,007 --> 01:08:19,921
[Ray] No!

946
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,054
Still got it.

947
01:08:26,624 --> 01:08:28,321
I don't feel like fighting you.

948
01:08:28,495 --> 01:08:31,150
Best believe
I feel like killing you!

949
01:08:32,456 --> 01:08:33,718
[gunshot]

950
01:08:33,892 --> 01:08:35,763
Fuck!

951
01:08:41,247 --> 01:08:43,902
For the love of God, Montresor!

952
01:08:44,076 --> 01:08:46,557
You gotta start
thinking about your woman.

953
01:08:48,646 --> 01:08:49,864
Think about Faith.

954
01:08:50,735 --> 01:08:52,867
[thudding]Oh...

955
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:54,739
And that kid that's with her.

956
01:08:57,437 --> 01:08:59,613
Yeah, son.

957
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:03,878
They'll both be here
in, say, 20 minutes?

958
01:09:05,793 --> 01:09:07,099
Faith's smart!

959
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:10,407
She's not gonna just
walk into your place!

960
01:09:11,408 --> 01:09:13,192
You mean like you did?

961
01:09:13,366 --> 01:09:15,107
[laughs]

962
01:09:15,281 --> 01:09:17,588
Yeah, I mean,
you're probably right.

963
01:09:17,762 --> 01:09:19,677
That's why I'm gonna meet her
at the access road.

964
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:24,725
I'm sorry, meet "them"
at the access road.

965
01:09:31,558 --> 01:09:33,299
If I tell you
where the bags are...

966
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:35,823
When you tell me
where the bags are....will you let 'em go?

967
01:09:35,997 --> 01:09:37,782
Will you trust my answer?

968
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,437
I can be less cynical.

969
01:09:44,354 --> 01:09:46,486
I probably don't even
have time to kill 'em.

970
01:09:47,705 --> 01:09:50,055
All this death here,
people are gonna come looking.

971
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:52,579
I need a head start.

972
01:09:53,624 --> 01:09:55,539
This money gets me far
and away.

973
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:05,462
[voice breaking]
Rusted car husk at the speedway.

974

[laughing]

975
01:10:07,464 --> 01:10:08,682
I put it under the hood.

976
01:10:08,856 --> 01:10:10,467
[whooping]

977
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:12,382
Yeah!

978
01:10:13,905 --> 01:10:15,863
$440,000?

979
01:10:16,037 --> 01:10:18,692
420 now. You already got 20.

980
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:21,434
All right, then.

981
01:10:25,003 --> 01:10:26,134
[beeps][car lock chirps]

982
01:10:26,309 --> 01:10:27,701

[car drives off]

985
01:10:52,378 --> 01:10:53,640
Fuck!

986
01:11:20,145 --> 01:11:22,016
[chuckles]

987
01:11:23,496 --> 01:11:25,281
[box clatters]

988
01:11:50,654 --> 01:11:51,698
Action time.

989
01:11:51,872 --> 01:11:54,527
[grunting]

990
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:02,883

[engine shuts off]

994
01:12:36,177 --> 01:12:37,657
Oh, shit.

995
01:12:45,622 --> 01:12:47,188
Oh, shit.

996
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,756
Door's coming off!Oh, shit!

997
01:12:54,631 --> 01:12:56,241
Check and mate.

998

[groans]

01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:20,091
[grunts][groans]

1000
01:13:20,265 --> 01:13:21,745
[laughs]

1001
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:24,574
Any last words?

1002
01:13:26,184 --> 01:13:27,185
I...

1003
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:28,752
Good enough.

1004
01:13:28,926 --> 01:13:30,406
[whistles]

1005
01:13:36,934 --> 01:13:38,892
Well, there's gotta
be a story here.

1006
01:13:43,767 --> 01:13:45,029
I'm the victim here!

1007
01:13:47,684 --> 01:13:49,642
[Grayson]
I'm just disappointed is all.

1008
01:13:49,816 --> 01:13:53,167
I heard so many clever
things about you, Ray.

1009
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:56,432
But I guess I get the
backstabbing murder side

1010
01:13:56,606 --> 01:13:58,259
of the old habits,
don't I?

1011
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,697
I already told you.
He killed them.

1012
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:03,351
He was trying to steal
the money, the pickup.

1013
01:14:03,526 --> 01:14:06,093
Unless you and the twins

1014
01:14:06,267 --> 01:14:08,444
always planned
on double-crossing us.

1015
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:11,534
Split it with this asshole here

1016
01:14:11,708 --> 01:14:14,145
until greed
got the better of you?

1017
01:14:15,363 --> 01:14:17,583
[lisps]
I'm just an innocent bystander.

1018
01:14:17,757 --> 01:14:20,238
This stranger,
he just came in,

1019
01:14:20,412 --> 01:14:22,632
and he was trying
to threaten me,
and I was just...

1020
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:27,027
All right.
I'm sorry, sir.

1021
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:29,203
I'm just gonna cut the shit
and level with you.

1022
01:14:29,377 --> 01:14:31,467
The sharp dresser
is mostly right.

1023
01:14:31,641 --> 01:14:33,207
Me and Ray go way back.

1024
01:14:33,381 --> 01:14:35,645
He called me,
and he said he needed a place

1025
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:37,516
to stash, and I quote,

1026
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:40,040
"440,000 buckaroonies."

1027
01:14:41,259 --> 01:14:43,000
But then he killed that man,

1028
01:14:43,174 --> 01:14:45,916
and since then,
I've just been trying
to survive.

1029
01:14:49,789 --> 01:14:53,489
Oh, I'm sorry.
I started to tune out
at "buckaroonies."

1030
01:14:55,316 --> 01:14:58,406
You know, before
you get too chummy
with this fucking guy,

1031
01:14:58,581 --> 01:15:03,107
you should know that
he is a dirty, murdering,
fucking child trafficker!

1032
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:09,940
If you survive this,
we'll talk.

1033
01:15:13,378 --> 01:15:16,642
Oh, so you're
a piece of shit too.

1034
01:15:18,426 --> 01:15:19,906
The world changed.

1035
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,824
It's under the hood.

1036
01:15:27,566 --> 01:15:28,698
Really?

1037
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,265
Go look.

1038
01:15:34,312 --> 01:15:35,966
Well, I expected more
out of you.

1039
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:39,796
You worked for the Shoemaker.

1040
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:42,755
Thought you'd learn
how to hide money and things.

1041
01:15:42,929 --> 01:15:45,497
Maybe some of it
would've rubbed off on you.

1042
01:15:45,671 --> 01:15:47,847
Yeah, well,
I'm sorry to disappoint.

1043
01:15:49,675 --> 01:15:51,024
Frankie, the package!

1044
01:15:51,198 --> 01:15:52,635
Give it, here. Here, here.

1045
01:15:52,809 --> 01:15:54,898
Where's the cash?[Ray] You have it.

1046
01:15:55,072 --> 01:15:57,161
I don't have it.Yes, you do.

1047
01:15:57,335 --> 01:15:59,337
I don't have it!Yes, you do!

1048
01:15:59,511 --> 01:16:02,296
You have it!Shut up, both of you!

1049
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:04,298
First things first!

1050
01:16:04,472 --> 01:16:05,909
Gorgeous.

1051
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:07,737
That's it?This is it!

1052
01:16:07,911 --> 01:16:08,825
Really?

1053
01:16:08,999 --> 01:16:10,566
Fucking move.

1054
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,132
[Grayson]
Yes, yes...

1055
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:13,830
Yes! [laughing]

1056
01:16:14,004 --> 01:16:16,006
Yeah. This is it!

1057
01:16:18,138 --> 01:16:19,444
This proves it!

1058
01:16:20,401 --> 01:16:22,273
The Mandela Effect is real!

1059
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:23,840
It's real?

1060
01:16:24,014 --> 01:16:27,104
The world has changed,
and it's not our fault.

1061
01:16:29,019 --> 01:16:30,803
You're all witnesses to it.

1062
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:36,461
I give this gift...
to all mankind.

1063
01:16:37,114 --> 01:16:38,811
[laughing]

1064
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,902
Get the VCR.

1065
01:16:55,132 --> 01:16:57,221
[VCR whirring]

1066
01:16:57,395 --> 01:16:59,615
[triumphant movie
soundtrack plays]

1067
01:17:01,921 --> 01:17:04,968
[man roars]

1068
01:17:05,142 --> 01:17:08,058
[Spanish dubbed dialogue]

1069
01:17:08,972 --> 01:17:10,321
Yeah, I've seen this.

1070
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:13,890
This is...
This is Kazaam.

1071
01:17:14,064 --> 01:17:15,674
You actually bought
four copies of Kazaam.

1072
01:17:15,848 --> 01:17:17,720
Shazaam.No, Kazaam.

1073
01:17:17,894 --> 01:17:19,417
Kazaam.They're
both genie movies.

1074
01:17:19,591 --> 01:17:21,245
But this one is
the Shaquille O'Neal vehicle.

1075
01:17:21,419 --> 01:17:23,900
It's Shazaam.That's a good
Photoshop, though.

1076
01:17:25,597 --> 01:17:30,471
[Spanish dub continues]

1077
01:17:33,997 --> 01:17:36,042
Why does she want this?
What the hell?

1078
01:17:36,869 --> 01:17:39,350
$440,000 for this?

1079
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:43,180
Yo soy Kazaam!

1080
01:17:44,181 --> 01:17:46,009
[boy on screen yells]

1081
01:17:49,752 --> 01:17:51,928
Oh, she
got you.

1082
01:17:53,233 --> 01:17:57,542
What a waste
of 440,000
buckaroonies.

1083
01:17:57,716 --> 01:17:59,762
But Shaq's
really grounded
in this scene.

1084
01:17:59,936 --> 01:18:01,502
He's so
much better
than LeBron.

1085
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,896
Plus, he's got
all these commercials--Shut up.

1086
01:18:07,204 --> 01:18:09,075
[Grayson]
It's just depressing is all.

1087
01:18:10,337 --> 01:18:11,817
I thought this would prove it.

1088
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:15,734
Why is the world
so crazy?

1089
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:18,519
I mean,
it's poisoned.

1090
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,087
It's... toxic.

1091
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:22,872
And there's nothing
to be done.

1092
01:18:25,091 --> 01:18:26,527
Fucking sucks.

1093
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:30,662
I guess
it's on us.

1094
01:18:30,836 --> 01:18:35,319
I mean, it'd be easier
if we can blame the universe
changing or time travelers.

1095
01:18:35,493 --> 01:18:38,844
But maybe everything right now
is our own damn fault.

1096
01:18:39,018 --> 01:18:40,846
Just shut the fuck up.
Get behind the wheel

1097
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,413
or I'll put you
behind the car.

1098
01:18:42,587 --> 01:18:43,849
Get out of here.

1099
01:18:44,981 --> 01:18:47,026
Hey! What was that for?

1100
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,375
All right.

1101
01:18:49,899 --> 01:18:51,727
Tapes are gone.
They're worthless.

1102
01:18:53,424 --> 01:18:55,426
Might as well get
my money back.

1103
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,168
Where is it?I'll tell you what happened.

1104
01:18:59,038 --> 01:19:01,649
Your brother
double-crossed you.

1105
01:19:01,824 --> 01:19:05,088
He and the twins were gonna
steal everything and kill Perry,

1106
01:19:05,262 --> 01:19:08,004
but I got sent instead.Bullshit.

1107
01:19:08,178 --> 01:19:10,746
Frankie, the guy's
a professional liar.

1108
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,358
All they had to do
was make it look
like I'd run off.

1109
01:19:14,532 --> 01:19:17,709
There was a time
that would have been easier.
All I did was run.

1110
01:19:19,102 --> 01:19:21,495
Even if it was true,
which it isn't,

1111
01:19:21,669 --> 01:19:23,933
he'd still know
where the money is, right?

1112
01:19:30,548 --> 01:19:32,245
Where's the money?

1113
01:19:32,419 --> 01:19:35,248
It's in that car,
last I saw it.

1114
01:19:37,337 --> 01:19:38,425
[whistles]

1115
01:19:42,647 --> 01:19:44,867
[grunting]

1116
01:19:52,135 --> 01:19:53,136
Oh, shit!

1117
01:20:07,063 --> 01:20:08,934
All right.
I'm calling the Shoemaker.

1118
01:20:09,108 --> 01:20:12,111
Maybe your death
will be a peace offering,

1119
01:20:12,285 --> 01:20:14,592
you and your friend
in prison.

1120
01:20:14,766 --> 01:20:18,944
The only person I told
is Billings.

1121
01:20:19,118 --> 01:20:22,165
Hey! Don't you
put that on me, bro!

1122
01:20:22,339 --> 01:20:24,123
I'd be long gone
if I had the money!

1123
01:20:25,298 --> 01:20:27,083
[whistles]Oh, Shit.

1124
01:20:43,926 --> 01:20:46,580
You stand,
you die.

1125
01:20:49,627 --> 01:20:52,499

[grunting]

1129
01:21:26,751 --> 01:21:28,405
Somebody wants
to talk to you.

1130
01:21:32,235 --> 01:21:34,193
What's the matter, Ray?
You don't wanna talk?

1131
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:46,423
All right. On my signal,
take him around again.

1132
01:21:46,597 --> 01:21:49,426
Only twice as long
and twice as fast.

1133
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,949
[vehicle approaching]

1134
01:21:53,996 --> 01:21:56,824
She must have overheard me
and Ray! Beat us to it!

1135
01:22:05,703 --> 01:22:08,010
She's got the cash!
Chase her down!

[coughing, laughing]

1137
01:22:13,754 --> 01:22:14,973
Is that true?

1138
01:22:16,453 --> 01:22:17,628
She's got the cash?

1139
01:22:17,802 --> 01:22:19,021
Your brother...

1140
01:22:20,457 --> 01:22:22,981
asked when you were
gonna see the old me.

1141
01:22:23,155 --> 01:22:26,506
Yeah.
You said you were knocking.

1142
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,681
Well, I'm waiting.

1143
01:22:30,641 --> 01:22:32,077
I let him in.

1144
01:22:33,905 --> 01:22:35,646
What?[whistles]

1145
01:22:37,865 --> 01:22:39,998

1146
01:22:40,172 --> 01:22:41,434
Perry, stop!

01:22:44,133 --> 01:22:47,092
Perry, wait!Fucker.

1148
01:22:51,357 --> 01:22:52,619
Oh, f...

1149
01:22:52,793 --> 01:22:53,838
Okay.

Oh, geez. No.

1153
01:23:35,053 --> 01:23:37,751
No, no, no, no, no...

1154
01:23:39,492 --> 01:23:41,973
I'm gonna borrow these firearms.

1155
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,498
Can never have enough.

Find a damn gun!

1161
01:24:22,492 --> 01:24:23,797
Okay.

1162
01:24:24,755 --> 01:24:26,191
Great. More running.

[grunting]

1164
01:25:03,968 --> 01:25:05,012
One shot.

Can you make
your one shot count?

You're a mess, Ray![gunshot]

1169

In a few steps...[gunshot]

1170
01:25:22,465 --> 01:25:23,683
I will be in range

1171
01:25:23,857 --> 01:25:25,772
and one of these pistols
will kill you!

1172
01:25:26,338 --> 01:25:28,123
Believe that.

1173
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,779
Oh...

1174
01:25:32,953 --> 01:25:33,998
Okay.

1175
01:25:34,172 --> 01:25:35,521
Okay.

1176
01:25:35,695 --> 01:25:38,307
Okay, I always like
a good Western.

1177
01:25:38,481 --> 01:25:41,440
High Noon, Shane.

1178
01:25:42,267 --> 01:25:43,573
Cowboy Bebop?

1179
01:25:52,016 --> 01:25:53,887
I never saw you
as the anime type.

1180
01:25:56,455 --> 01:25:57,935
You never asked.

1181
01:26:01,939 --> 01:26:03,419
I gotta call range!

1182
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:12,993

[Billings roars]Billings!

1187
01:26:34,798 --> 01:26:36,800
Billings, stop! Stop!

Ray...

1189
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:44,111
You're not Yosemite Sam.

1190
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,550
Just grazed me!

1191
01:26:49,421 --> 01:26:51,075
You're Wile E. Coyote.

[gasps]

1193
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,611
Check and mate.

1194
01:27:12,314 --> 01:27:14,229
Oh, what a fucking day.

[groans]

1196
01:27:23,629 --> 01:27:24,804
What?

[vehicle approaching]

1198
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,165
Shit! [screams]

01:27:50,569 --> 01:27:52,571
[phone rings]

1200
01:27:52,745 --> 01:27:54,051
Hello?

1201
01:27:54,225 --> 01:27:55,531
[Ray] Faith!
Are you okay?

1202
01:27:55,705 --> 01:27:58,098
Ray! Are you okay?

1203
01:27:59,926 --> 01:28:02,015
I am now.

1204
01:28:02,189 --> 01:28:05,671
But it's best if you and Julian
just turn around, okay?
Get out of here.

1205
01:28:05,845 --> 01:28:07,630
I'm-- But I'm right here.

1206
01:28:07,804 --> 01:28:10,197
And I want to be with you
more than anything.

1207
01:28:10,372 --> 01:28:13,723
But trust me.
I will explain everything
when I see you in a few hours.

1208
01:28:14,419 --> 01:28:16,291
Everything.

1209
01:28:16,465 --> 01:28:18,510
Even the things
that I wanted to forget.

1210
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:20,599
Echoes from my past.

1211
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:25,691
I'm so sorry.

1212
01:28:25,865 --> 01:28:29,260
Sorry that even
a whisper of them
came close to you and Julian.

1213
01:28:32,089 --> 01:28:33,917
But I'll never
let that happen again.

1214
01:28:35,701 --> 01:28:36,920
It's all behind me.

1215
01:28:42,447 --> 01:28:45,885
Hey, remember when you said,
with Julian,
I was halfway there?

1216
01:28:46,059 --> 01:28:47,452
Yeah.

1217
01:28:47,626 --> 01:28:49,585
I think I just picked up
the other half.

1218
01:28:52,936 --> 01:28:54,024
A kid I found.

1219
01:28:56,243 --> 01:28:57,506
She needs what I need.

1220
01:29:02,206 --> 01:29:03,947
She needs it
just as much as I do.

1221
01:29:07,690 --> 01:29:09,344
What is it that you need?

1222
01:29:10,649 --> 01:29:11,824
I just need...

1223
01:29:13,957 --> 01:29:15,088
to get...

1224
01:29:20,877 --> 01:29:22,531
home.

1225
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:32,688
Just like
you thought.

1226
01:30:35,038 --> 01:30:37,475
Shoemaker always was
good at hiding things.

1227
01:30:39,738 --> 01:30:41,087
[Ray] We should
get rid of this.

1228
01:30:42,872 --> 01:30:44,221
It's nothing
but trouble.

1229
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,616
That's not me anymore.[snickers]
