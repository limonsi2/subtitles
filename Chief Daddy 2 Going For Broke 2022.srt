3
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,625
Don't tell me.
Over my brother's business?

4
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:39,916
So?

5
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:48,416
Sorry oh!

6
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,541
That's a lie.

7
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:42,541
For real.

8
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,875
Lie! You're lying.

9
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,666
She's legally married to my brother.

10
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,750
That's right.

11
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,375
I knew it would come to this.

12
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,625
He is my brother!

13
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,541
I knew it.

14
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,458
Hey! Hey!

15
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:37,791
Yes!

16
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:41,416
Oluwafemi,
I've told you several times.

17
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,833
English language
that twists the tongue.

18
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,125
As I was saying...

19
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,958
Ah! Taboo!

20
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,916
Sign it!

21
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,708
What about us?

22
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,666
-He's a man. You are ladies.
-So?

23
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,333
Don't be offended.

24
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,500
So frustrating!

25
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,375
You don't have the guts.

26
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,541
-No guts.
-Not your fault.

27
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,333
Who's this mad woman?

28
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:33,166
You either pack up or improve.
It's better you go sell smoked fish.

29
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,291
Are you foolish?

30
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,791
-Who's going to sell smoked fish?
-Sis, it's okay!

31
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,208
She said we should sell fish!

32
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,041
Get out of my sight.

33
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,125
Take your rubbish away!
With your wedding gown!

34
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,750
Take it easy.

35
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,875
I'm confused. Take a look.

36
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,666
Want to break me?

37
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,916
-You forgot how expensive it is.
-Small chops fried in oil!

38
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,375
Thank you for coming!

39
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,833
Thanks for coming.

40
00:15:56,666 --> 00:16:00,250
You know me, though.
I don't care.

41
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,625
Where are these guys?

42
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,208
Shut it off.

43
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,875
Shut it off, please.

44
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,416
He has no money.

45
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,416
My money.

46
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,458
What a pity.

47
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,125
Won't I just begin--

48
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:38,375
Ah, I'm in trouble.

49
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:31,333
-Oh, please.
-Auntie A.

50
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,541
You're confusing me.

51
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:37,750
Honestly.

52
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:12,625
Calm down!

53
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,208
You've annoyed him terribly.

54
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,416
Is that how to show support?

55
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:02,625
Wait. Are you a child? Huh?

56
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,416
Don't you have any sense?

57
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:12,916
That's your cup of tea.

58
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,541
Please!

59
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:04,166
Who are you telling to chill?
Keep quiet!

60
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,000
Who is this skinny one?

61
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:31,083
She should know her place.

62
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:51,291
Come and sit.
There's money to be made!

63
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,208
Did you hear that?

64
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,583
It will shine everywhere!

65
00:56:57,708 --> 00:56:59,583
-What's her name?
-Rihanna.

66
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:19,083
Sorry, it is not allowed
to make noise around here.

67
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:33,625
I am a Nigerian, I recognized
you guys, as soon as I saw you.

68
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:05,000
I'm happy
when I see my people.

69
01:00:09,541 --> 01:00:14,000
I have a fine car.
Don't think that I'm joking.

70
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:21,416
Where are you guys going?
My car is here. Where are you going?

71
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:37,583
Nobody has this type
of car in Dubai.

72
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:39,791
I am a very popular guy in this city.

73
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:49,375
Everyone knows me in Dubai.

74
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:40,833
Come on, Sis.
End the call, let us discuss business.

75
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:46,750
We were supposed to send the proposal.

76
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:14,583
Are you jealous?
At least I got a man.

77
01:03:25,416 --> 01:03:26,458
Meaning?

78
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:40,583
Come on, what's the matter?
You should be dancing!

79
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:50,166
Why are you always negative?

80
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:52,958
-You love being sad for fun.
-I was wondering as well.

81
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:57,791
-What?
-Money is money.

82
01:09:57,875 --> 01:09:59,541
-Right?
-Right.

83
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:01,833
Hurry, hurry.

84
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:03,875
Hurry, hurry.

85
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,208
Let's think this through.

86
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:16,500
Tinu, the boss!

87
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:17,583
The tenacious Teni.

88
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:19,541
Tenacious.

89
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:45,791
-Hey! Look! Hey!
-Get out my way.

90
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,875
It was too good to be true.

91
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,625
Oh my God.

92
01:11:24,916 --> 01:11:26,208
Come here.

93
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:36,416
When everything was rosy,
you didn't know we existed.

94
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:42,875
You're not serious.

95
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:53,958
Hmm? You and who?

96
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:56,750
-It's your family that'll die.
-It's your own cursed family.

97
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:58,541
Stop insulting each other.

98
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:19,583
Please, don't disturb us
with all these documents.

99
01:14:51,833 --> 01:14:54,041
-What did you buy?
-We're finished.

100
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:20,958
Let us go.
I'm talking too much.

101
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:49,166
You wanna go?

102
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:53,125
Let's go.

103
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:07,958
You're the man.

104
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:51,666
I said it!

105
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:55,333
I know Dammy Baggio!
Dammy who plays for Royal Manchester!

106
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:57,750
Dammy! Talented guy, I tell you.

107
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:48,000
-I'm a Nigerian guy.

108
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:55,125
Fool! Look at his big head!
