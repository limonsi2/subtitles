[Announcer] The Olympic flame is
now approaching the stadium.

[News Broadcaster]
As the date approaches,

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,560
you're going to hear
lots about Picabo.

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,960
An amazing American

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,560
with an unusual name turns
Olympic skiing upside down.

12
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,040
[Picabo] I'm going to
tell you all about

13
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,319
my year and how ripping
awesome it was because

14
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,319
it felt damn good
to kick some Europeans butt.

15
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:14,159
I'll tell you what.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,480
- It's a European sport,

17
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,959
and frankly, we're
an embarrassment.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,719
You couldn't find skiing
in any newspaper.

19
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,599
Nobody was talking about it.

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,959
- Picabo put ski racing
back on the map.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,439
[Announcer] One of those
rare downhillers

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,079
whose name has transcended
the sport.

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,640
Dorfmeister watches

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,840
as Picabo Street replaces her
as the leader by over a second.

25
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,640
What an amazing run.

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,519
- All of a sudden,

27
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,560
ski racing is being talked
about in someone's household.

28
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,359
- My guest is the infamous
Picabo Street.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,200
- There's some people where you

30
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,079
know that they've
entered the room,

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,239
and then there are some people

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,760
where you don't really
realize they came.

33
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,519
- Thanks, thanks.

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
- You were tremendous.
- You were wonderful.

35
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:04,400
- When she came into the room,
you knew she was there.

36
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,079
- Yahoo!!

37
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,120
(screams)

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,280
- In the speed events,

39
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,319
downhill and Super G,
Picabo Street is the greatest

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,240
North American,
male or female ever to race,

41
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,759
and she has paid a physical
and emotional price.

42
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,919
- The more fearlessness that you

43
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,680
can demonstrate going down the
hill, the better the payoff.

44
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,000
- People ask me,

45
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,000
what are you thinking when
you're going that fast?

46
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,680
I said, I'm thinking about
how I can go faster.

47
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,360
- For someone to be able to
pursue their dream through all

48
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,439
that adversity, it takes someone
who is radically committed.

49
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,240
In my experience,
every single professional

50
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,919
athlete is running
to escape something.

51
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,800
- One of the shining stars

52
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,319
from the 1998 Winter Olympics
is in trouble with the law.

53
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,199
Picabo Street has been charged
with assault and domestic

54
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,520
violence after an incident
involving her father.

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,120
- After her career,

56
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,919
she was in the press,
and that's when she was really

57
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,560
misunderstood
and misrepresented.

58
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,759
- She just had a big heart
and liked people and was

59
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,120
naturally inclined
to help people.

60
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,680
And I think that helped pave

61
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:17,520
the way for Lindsey and a whole
new generation of skiers, too.

62
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,960
- For all the young
ones out there

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,719
that have the same
dream, go for it.

64
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,520
Because dreams can come true.

65
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,400
- Lindsey's good friend and
mentor, Picabo Street.

66
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,919
(cheering)

67
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,280
- Thank you.

68
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,639
When I met her,
she was nine years old.

69
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,680
She stood taller than everybody
else and she still does.

70
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,719
I'm super proud of how she's

71
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,039
handled becoming the greatest
American skier of all times.

72
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,840
Miss Lindsey Vonn!

73
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,319
(cheering)

74
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,039
- I've looked up to Picabo since

75
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,159
I was a little girl,
and it means so much to me

76
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:59,639
to have her here and to be so
supportive over my whole career.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,560
- First time, right?
- Yep.

78
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,479
Nothing like interviewing your
idol for your first time.

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,240
(calm music)

80
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,000
- I'm always like,

81
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,240
I hate the cold and everyone's
like... What?

82
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,120
- Same with me!
They're like, what's wrong?

83
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,319
Why are you cold?

84
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,079
I'm like, because I
don't like the cold.

85
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,319
- Never liked it. They're like,
Why do I go so fast?

86
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,720
I want to get the bottom.

87
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,199
- Put my clothes on.

88
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,120
- When you started skiing,
what drew you to it?

89
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,079
What did you love about it?

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,720
Did it change when
you were a kid

91
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,439
to when you started racing?

92
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,800
- I don't think so.

93
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,519
I think it was the
same thing always.

94
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,199
I just fell in love
with the speed.

95
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,720
I fell in love with
being able to harness that.

96
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,480
And something inside of me felt
like this should feel out

97
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,120
of control all the time,
but it doesn't.

98
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,240
And I like making it not
feel out of control.

99
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,959
- And do you feel like that is
different from your life?

100
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,040
I know for me, skiing was always

101
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,360
the outlet where I felt
the most in control.

102
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:22,199
- I would say that for sure
because especially, like,

103
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,839
when you're there
and you're going, it's you.

104
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,920
When we're going, it's us.

105
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,120
So you're totally relying

106
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,480
on yourself for everything
to come through.

107
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,639
(calm music)

108
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,399
(snap)

109
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,360
- Picabo,
you are, like, my hero,

110
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:50,160
and this is such a full
circle moment for me.

111
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,920
I am where I am because of you.

112
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,000
And I still have your poster

113
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,920
that you signed when I
was nine in my bedroom.

114
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,920
I brought it here just to like,
show you...

115
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,120
- To prove it exists.
- Yes.

116
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,199
Yeah, like, when we were racing

117
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,040
together, we're
on the same team.

118
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,639
But I was like, your shadow.

119
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,120
And so for me, this is such
an honor, and I want to know.

120
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,279
I mean, I know pretty much
everything there is to know

121
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,040
about you, but where
did it all begin?

122
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,560
Where did Picabo come from?

123
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,160
[Picabo] Triumph was the fun
sports game beginning for me.

124
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,439
I would do my chores as well as
I could do them to earn

125
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,600
the right to go play
and figure out who I was.

126
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,000
Growing up here.

127
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,439
As I've gotten older,
I look back on it.

128
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,079
Every time I come back here,
I think about how

129
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,680
such a small town and so
many really close people.

130
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,240
I felt like I had not just

131
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,160
my family, but the family
within the community.

132
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,279
It was like 32 people,
very work oriented.

133
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:11,839
I had my brother,
was one of seven or eight boys

134
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,560
in town that I had
to interact with.

135
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,920
- So you entertained yourself.

136
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,800
And it was bikes and hiking and

137
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,399
cops and robbers and everything
was a competition.

138
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,160
[Picabo] I was competitive
all the time.

139
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,120
I mean, I had to beat my brother

140
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,560
to the breakfast, lunch,
and dinner table.

141
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,720
I had to beat him
down with the food.

142
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,959
I had to beat him down with our

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,199
chores when we got
home from school.

144
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,360
I mean, I was competing with him

145
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,560
all my life,
in everything I did.

146
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,360
- Peeky was pretty tomboyed out
because it was all boys

147
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,800
in the community,
and she was going to be a better

148
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,160
boy than the boys were,
even though she was a girl.

149
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,480
- If you drove by,

150
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,600
you wouldn't know that there was
a girl in the mix.

151
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,800
[Picabo] There's a town 20 miles
south of Triumph called Picabo.

152
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,639
The way I spell my name,

153
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,040
it has a beautiful river
running through it.

154
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,240
And Picabo is

155
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,560
the Native American name
for shining waters.

156
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,120
- We were poor,
we didn't have money.

157
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,120
We grew our own food.

158
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,920
We went shopping once and you

159
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,079
wore those clothes
and rode the school bus.

160
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,040
- This was my favorite spot.

161
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,319
I learned how
to ski right there.

162
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,319
Every time I come back and look
at it, I think about how steep

163
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,080
it is and how aggressive
that was for me to tackle that.

164
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,720
By the end, I'd come
bombing down here.

165
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,320
I remember just bombing down
and worrying, actually,

166
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,919
that I would go off into Mom's
garden and how much trouble I

167
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,159
was going to get if I did
that, but I never did.

168
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,919
- How did you do it yourself?

169
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,360
- I just needed it to happen.

170
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,200
- You just grabbed your
brother's equipment?

171
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,600
- I waited for them
all to go inside.

172
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,399
It was just like, just kind
of stealthy out there.

173
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,519
And he comes out like,
what are you doing up there?

174
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,480
And I'm like, Watch.

175
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,480
And I skied and
didn't fall down.

176
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,919
And I'm sure it wasn't pretty,
but showed some skills.

177
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,720
And he was like, wow.

178
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:07,559
(calm music)

179
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Once I got good enough
in the backyard.

180
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,480
Then my first experience was

181
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,240
right over in Sun Valley
on Quarter Dollar.

182
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,399
And I got on the chairlift
with my brother.

183
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,480
I held on like a little baby
the whole way up the chairlift.

184
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,000
We got off the top and I
went straight to the bottom.

185
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:29,519
Straight was fearless,
stiff legged snow plow out

186
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,279
there, just bumping along
and got to the bottom.

187
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,559
And my brother came down and he
said to me, you can turn.

188
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,720
And I said, Why?

189
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,960
One of the things my dad did,

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,600
we'd get to the top
of the mountain, 9:15 a.m..

191
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,399
And he'd say to me, all right,
well, we're headed to the bowls

192
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,519
and you're welcome
to come, but keep up.

193
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,320
Otherwise we'll see
at the car at four o'clock.

194
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,519
And I'm thinking, four o'clock?!

195
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,039
I don't have any money.
I can't get lunch.

196
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,919
I got to keep up.

197
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,519
So, I mean, I learned how to be

198
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,080
the skier I am because of the
mountain right here, Baldy.

199
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,679
It's an amazing mountain.

200
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:09,559
From then on, it's basically
been downhill for me.

201
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,279
- She was always chasing
the groups ahead of her because

202
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,519
she was beating
everybody her own age.

203
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,320
She would beat all the girls
and the boys,

204
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,679
and then she'd start going
after the groups ahead of her.

205
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,360
The older kids.

206
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,919
Mom said, she goes, I had
two jobs in life. With you,

207
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,480
it was keeping you fed.

208
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,399
And she goes as far as Peek,
It was keeping her alive.

209
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,440
- She was a full time kid,
you know, one of those that you

210
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,080
have to run around after all
the time, keep them safe.

211
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,720
- My father raised me like,

212
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:46,120
you work hard and then you play
hard, kind of get your chores

213
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,120
done and then have
at it kind of thing.

214
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,480
So, yeah, I've always
raised them like that.

215
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,720
[Picabo] My father
was a stonemason

216
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,879
and he built some of the coolest

217
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,720
and most beautiful structures
in the Sun Valley area.

218
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,720
[Baba] An attribute
of dad that a lot

219
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,240
people didn't know is

220
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:06,639
that the guy would have given
you the shirt off on his back.

221
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,759
He was an extremely
giving person,

222
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,120
but dad carried
a lot of anger in his life.

223
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:19,480
[Picabo] My father was
raised in a very

224
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,919
uncomfortable environment,
and he didn't know how to set up

225
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,559
a more comfortable
environment himself.

226
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,679
If you grew up in this
atmosphere, you know it when

227
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,360
you're asleep and you wake
up to your parents fighting.

228
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,039
There's a certain
thump on the floor.

229
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,120
There's a certain
sound of the slap.

230
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,720
There's a certain

231
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,480
velocity in a voice
that stays with you forever.

232
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,320
And I just looked for positive

233
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,320
energy in life where
it had it to give me.

234
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,279
I love the view from the top

235
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,120
of a mountain,
and it was an escape for me.

236
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,159
[Announcer] On every
corner of this

237
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,720
magnificent city,
Olympic fever is in the air.

238
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,320
The women's Giant Slalom is the
first Alpine event to be held.

239
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,000
Cristin Cooper,
Debbie Armstrong,

240
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:14,360
Tamara McKinney formed the core
of America's hope for medals.

241
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,720
[Picabo] I didn't watch
TV till I was 13 years old,

242
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,240
and when I saw Cristin Cooper
and Tamara McKinney skiing,

243
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,120
I realized, wow,
that's what I want to do.

244
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,679
That's where I want to be.

245
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,679
(upbeat music)

246
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,080
That was it.
That was me.

247
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
That was what I wanted to do.

248
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:40,159
I, in all my innocence, looked
up at my father and said,

249
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,320
Hey Dad, I want to go
to the Olympics

250
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,240
and win a medal in skiing.

251
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,120
That's when he turns and goes,
Great.

252
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,919
Sounds like a good plan.

253
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,120
Family apples are all
going in your basket.

254
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,720
Don't drop it.

255
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,360
From the time when I was 10
to about 15,

256
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,159
we really were hammering
everything into my skiing.

257
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,120
All the money we brought in as

258
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,519
a family, cleaning houses,
and my dad doing his

259
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:06,919
stonemasonry went
right into me skiing.

260
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,840
- Picabo is remarkable.

261
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,120
Came from a very
hard working family.

262
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,759
They didn't have the money
to take care of everything,

263
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,840
so we helped her
whenever we could.

264
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,080
We went out and found money.

265
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,639
We found equipment.

266
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,759
- It's an expensive sport,
we'll call it.

267
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:24,720
So there's a demographic
of people that are involved

268
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:27,279
in it, and there's
a demographic that aren't.

269
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,000
That was what really fueled her

270
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:34,559
fire to, okay, well,
I'm going to beat your ass

271
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,200
in my rags while you're
wearing your Gucci.

272
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,519
And she did.

273
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,080
- The very first time
she showed up.

274
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,519
And she had mentioned her name

275
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,360
was Picabo, and one of the
boys was teasing her about it.

276
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,840
Well, next thing I know,
that boy is coming to me.

277
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,519
He's got a bloody
nose and he's crying.

278
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,320
And he's going I said, What
in the heck happened to you?

279
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,960
And he said, Well,
Picabo, she hit me.

280
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,519
And I said, well,
why did she hit you?

281
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,600
He says, Because I was
teasing her about her name.

282
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,519
I mean, she was just tough.

283
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,600
[Picabo] There were a
lot of times when I

284
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,159
just walked away,
kind of holding my head low

285
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,120
because I was a little bit
embarrassed about how many

286
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,120
people I had beaten,
how fast I had actually gone.

287
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,120
And I didn't have anything else

288
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,960
in mind but skiing as
fast as I possibly could.

289
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,120
[Announcer]
Out front is Jean Claude Killy,

290
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,120
one of the greatest
Champions of all time.

291
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,080
[Picabo] My dad,
he drove the bus

292
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,840
for the Sun Valley Ski Resort.

293
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,399
He used to drive
Jean Claude Killy.

294
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,480
So Jean gets off the bus one

295
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,919
day, and my dad goes,
So my daughter's a ski racer.

296
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,600
And John turns around.
Oh, really?

297
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,639
It's like, yeah, she skis
for the local team here.

298
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,159
She's actually

299
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,480
on the US Development Team now,
and she's dreaming of going

300
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,960
to the Olympics and winning
a gold medal one day.

301
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,919
And Jean Claude is like,
what's her name?

302
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,120
I'll keep track of her.

303
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,600
Then he comes home and tells us

304
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,840
at dinner that night, oh, I told
Jean Claude Killy about you.

305
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm like, who's that?

306
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:00,120
He's like,
just the greatest skier ever.

307
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,440
It made me super excited.

308
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,600
Like, yeah, my dad
believes in me.

309
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,000
But at the same time,
I was like (gasps)

310
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,120
(upbeat music)

311
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,440
- I was lucky to be
invited to be

312
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,759
the head coach for
this junior team.

313
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,440
An amazing group of young women
came along, including Picabo.

314
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,080
When she was 14.

315
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,480
Picabo was brash,

316
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,879
and everybody around her was
a little brash going,

317
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,159
this is the next Olympic gold
medalist, and you've got to take

318
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,720
her immediately onto the ski
team,

319
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,679
but you've got to have
the maturity with all

320
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,480
the demands of wearing
a national team uniform.

321
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,279
[Heidi Voelker] I think back,

322
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,360
being on the US Ski Team at such
a young age, it's mind blowing.

323
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,639
I mean, in a sense,
the US Ski Team raised us.

324
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:48,440
We were gone from our families
ten months out of the year.

325
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,919
- They're videoing us
coming to you live

326
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,279
from Lone, Norway.

327
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,879
- Did you fit in? Do you think?
- No.

328
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,639
No, I didn't fit in
very much at all.

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,600
I was sassy.

330
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,399
I was irreverent and driven.

331
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,559
I was competitive, but more so
with myself than anyone else.

332
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,080
- Some of the ski
coaches would say,

333
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,320
there's no doubt about it.
Picabo street has great

334
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,679
natural ability, but she
doesn't work like she should.

335
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,960
- I think they could say that
about me at one point in time.

336
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,279
And they did.
- At this early stage.

337
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,440
- At this early stage,

338
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,720
when I first got on,
they believed that.

339
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,919
And these exact words,

340
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,159
Picabo Street will
never amount to anything.

341
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,919
She cannot follow the rules.

342
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,120
(chuckles)

343
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,919
And when I heard that one,
I just laughed.

344
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,720
Like, rules are
meant to be broken.

345
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,919
And that's kind of how I felt.

346
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,919
And I was going to make it work.

347
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,919
- Don't! It's gonna look
so bad on camera.

348
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,120
- I showed up to camp
fat, sassy.

349
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:46,360
And so it was like,
you're gone. Boom, out of here.

350
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,320
You're gone off the team,
sent home.

351
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,320
Lied to my dad,
tried telling me, fine,

352
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,879
I'm training, whatever he's
like, here's what's happening.

353
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,120
The apple basket dropped.

354
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,559
The apples are all
over everywhere.

355
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,320
And you need to start gathering
them up and put them

356
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,440
in a basket, and you need to get
on a plane on Monday for Hawaii.

357
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,240
- Your dad, in fact,
gave you two options.

358
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,640
He said, either hit
the highway or come join me.

359
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,720
And your parents had moved
to Maui at the time,

360
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,960
and he was a mason
rebuilding walls and things.

361
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,359
He said, Come work
with me for a while.

362
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,240
- I think the situation was
that it was time for her

363
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:18,319
to decide if she really
wanted it or not.

364
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,160
And we did kind of put
her on the spot.

365
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,920
[Picabo] But it's hard
to be in Hawaii on boot camp.

366
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,119
- Who was your trainer?
- Just my dad.

367
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,519
The Marine stepped in.

368
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:32,720
- Your dad was a Marine?

369
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,599
- My dad was a Marine.
- I didn't know that.

370
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,920
- Yeah.

371
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,279
- So you went back and you
did a lot of hard, manual

372
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,319
labor that kind of straightened
you out a little bit, didn't it?

373
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,759
- It did.
It did straight me out.

374
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,079
I mean, I was studying hard,
finishing up my high school.

375
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,200
I couldn't talk on the phone.

376
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,640
I couldn't go out.

377
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,480
I was under Dad's thumb.

378
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,200
I grew a lot.

379
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,400
My dad's and my relationship

380
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,039
bonded at a new level because
when I left, he slipped a 50

381
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,960
in an envelope, and he
wrote a little note.

382
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,400
And his exact words were,

383
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,960
Your best interest
is my only concern.

384
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,279
And I was like,
I got to do this.

385
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,759
That's all he cares about.

386
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,319
That's all he wants me to do
is be the best that I can be.

387
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,319
And he knows I can be
the best in the world.

388
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,440
[Announcer] The United
States of America!

389
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,640
(cheering)

390
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,599
- She was really ready
to come on in 93.

391
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,200
And that's when we had the
World Championships in Morioka.

392
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,119
And she won a silver
medal in the combined.

393
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,480
And completely unexpected.

394
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:45,119
The European coaches
were just snickering.

395
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
What is this name?
Picabo?

396
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,440
It's not even a real name.

397
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,839
- Ching ching!

398
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,640
Oh, my God.

399
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,920
Ching ching.
- Go ahead and buy that Harley.

400
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,200
- * I'm gonna be
riding a Harley! *

401
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,440
- Did you have any expectations

402
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,720
coming into the
World Championships,

403
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,200
Picabo, that a medal was
a possibility for you?

404
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,039
- Yeah, I did.
For the combined.

405
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,200
I knew that I could for sure be

406
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,160
top five, and I was
hoping for a top three.

407
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,440
So, yes.

408
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,160
- I was with the
Austrian ski team,

409
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,359
and we had an athlete

410
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,039
that normally should
have won the combined.

411
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,079
Her name was Anita Wachter.
She was third.

412
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,440
So when I had to do an interview
after the race,

413
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,799
the journalist said, So you
guys lost a silver medal today?

414
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,799
And I said, no, no, no.

415
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,119
We won the bronze.

416
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,920
And the journalist said, no,

417
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,880
you lost a silver medal
because of Picabo.

418
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,119
(crowd cheers)
- Woo-hoo!

419
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,000
- And this was actually the
first time my ears went up

420
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,960
and said, Okay, who is she?

421
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,400
When you're coaching,
when you're connoisseur

422
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,559
of the whole thing, you look at
different techniques of skiing.

423
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,920
And one thing that caught
my attention was a skill set

424
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,720
that Picabo had. We
call it gliding

425
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,119
in a very low tuck and being
very fast in flat sections.

426
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,599
And that's a big thing
that speed limits.

427
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,920
When you drive 80 miles an hour.

428
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,519
Open up the window and put your

429
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,400
hand out the window, and you're
going to go, almost lost my arm.

430
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,359
It gives you a pretty good
feeling how the air is

431
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,559
a resistance and also
makes noise.

432
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,559
And a lot of athletes
at that level can hear

433
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,640
the noise, and they adjust their
body position very clearly.

434
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,240
- She could generate
speed by just

435
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,759
gliding on the snow that nobody
else we've ever seen do.

436
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,119
[Picabo] I went in the
scientific wind

437
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,720
tunnel that they use
to measure our aerodynamics.

438
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:58,759
- With the hands and the arms

439
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:02,599
you've got to come out there.

440
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,400
[Picabo] I spent 35 minutes
with the guy

441
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,680
on different kinds of stances
and positions, trying to figure

442
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,000
out which one was
the best for me.

443
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,200
And my legs got tired,
and I just kind of relaxed

444
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,960
into this really low,
comfortable position.

445
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,759
My drag dropped three points.

446
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,039
We both looked at each other

447
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:27,920
and smiled like,
oh, my goodness,

448
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,359
we just found a little edge
that no one will ever have it.

449
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,440
[Announcer] Welcome to Norway.

450
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,240
Where once again,
Winter Games will be played.

451
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,119
Only now there will be cheering

452
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,359
crowds, and all
the world will see.

453
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:51,920
- We were just thrilled that she
had made the Olympic team.

454
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,920
She was in high 20's.

455
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,079
30 result skier,
which at that point,

456
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,920
you're the 30th best
skier on the planet.

457
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,720
That's pretty impressive.

458
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,279
- I remember being beside myself
to go to the first Olympics.

459
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,359
This is the real deal.

460
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,559
We are super far away from home,

461
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:15,160
meeting all the other athletes
and getting in your uniform and

462
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,440
finally getting something
that says USA in letters

463
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,799
that you're going to put on your
back like, oh, my goodness.

464
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:25,079
[Announcer] Welcome
United States of America.

465
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,599
- It's like, it's happening!
This is real.

466
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,160
(crowd cheering)

467
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,000
(crowd cheering)

468
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,519
[Announcer] More than
170,000 race fans

469
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,079
have made their way to Norway's
white Mountain, Kvitfjell.

470
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,440
They have created
an unparalleled festive

471
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,359
atmosphere under
bright, sunny sky.

472
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:59,119
- The interesting story
behind Lilyhammer

473
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,160
is the original course
they picked was on a different

474
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,039
mountain, and the top
part was relatively flat.

475
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,839
There was nobody on the planet

476
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,440
who could ski flats as
fast as Picabo.

477
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:15,519
German team is protesting.

478
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,720
Got to move this race

479
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:19,200
from the women's course
to the men's course.

480
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,440
- Olympic history will be made
here at Kvitfjell

481
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,759
in the downhill,
where for the first time ever,

482
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,559
the women will compete
on the same course as the men.

483
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,559
- It's a European sport,
and we were total underdogs.

484
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,359
(indistinct announcer)

485
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,599
What's gratifying is stay

486
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,200
focused and, frankly, beat the
Europeans at their own game.

487
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,039
[Announcer] Seizinger. There's
the leading time now by 1.24.

488
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,119
We're back at Kvitjfell, and
it's time for Picabo Street.

489
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,400
(Picabo singing)

490
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,000
- What are you listening to?
- Gabriella.

491
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,039
[Announcer]
Her thing is going fast,

492
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,400
and she's next
to chase Katja Seizinger

493
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,640
and her teammate, Hilary Lynn.

494
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,359
Picabo's parents,

495
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,200
who arrived a couple of days ago

496
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,720
here for the big moment.

497
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,559
(beep)

498
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,759
- All right, Peek. (indistinct)
Come on.

499
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:24,920
(beep)

500
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,160
(beep)

501
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,160
[Announcer] Aerodynamic
foil on top of her boot

502
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,440
so that she slides better

503
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,119
through the air down
here on the flat.

504
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,559
Now, Picabo is known
for being a great glider.

505
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,359
She has a very fine
feel for the snow.

506
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,000
Let the speed run over it well,
and it's so amazing.

507
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:54,720
I mean, a year ago
at this time, Picabo Street,

508
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,119
nobody would have
known her name.

509
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,599
And she went to
medal in the decline

510
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,480
at the World's Championship
and ever since then

511
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,400
she's just gotten better
and better with every race.

512
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,119
[Picabo] I had someone ask me,
what is it about skiing for you?

513
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,960
And I said, it's the speed.

514
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,519
Your skis are kind of like your

515
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:22,119
race car, but you're driving
it from a real raw place.

516
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,480
It doesn't get much more intense

517
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:27,200
than that as far as being
in that danger element.

518
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,799
Control over that amount

519
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,440
of speed and those aggressive
of physical movements

520
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:45,960
and that many G-Forces in a turn
that are solely created by me.

521
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,599
(crowd cheers)

522
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,039
[Announcer] One more turn
to the final.

523
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:56,119
Into the finish area.

524
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:59,240
(indistinct)

525
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,079
Seventy miles an hour to the
finish line for Picabo Street.

526
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,200
Into second place.

527
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,000
(cheering)

528
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:13,759
(upbeat music)

529
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,960
For Picabo Street, in her first
Olympics, Silver was great.

530
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,160
- I expected a medal.

531
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,039
I wanted myself to ski well
enough to get a medal,

532
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:26,279
but I was going to settle for a
top five, so I still

533
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,960
came home with the medal.
That's excellent.

534
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:32,240
* *

535
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:38,319
[Announcer] Number two,
Picabo Street!

536
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,039
[Picabo] The whole
idea that I actually

537
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,559
did it and my dream came true.

538
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:49,480
Sometimes I still have to pick
the medal up and actually get it

539
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,440
in my hand to believe
that it really happened.

540
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,559
And then all the memories flow.

541
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,720
The thing that it's created

542
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:58,839
for me is a bright spot
in my life that I have to look

543
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,440
at and remember and
to brighten my day.

544
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,160
* *

545
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,160
[Announcer] The winner
of the silver medal.

546
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,319
(foreign language)

547
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,160
Picabo Street.

548
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,000
(foreign language)

549
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,640
(cheering)

550
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,160
(crowd singing)

551
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,920
[Picabo] It was all really
really super cool,

552
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,119
except for one moment.

553
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,079
The wrong (bleep) flag went
up the center.

554
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,720
It was not our flag.

555
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,319
I was a silver medalist.

556
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,920
So as I watched them go up...
- Oh, yeah.

557
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,039
- I'm watching mine.

558
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,359
I'm not hearing my anthem.

559
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,319
I'm seeing my flag,
but I'm not hearing my anthem.

560
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,960
So it's this moment of like,

561
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,480
I will never step back on this

562
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,079
stage again and hear
someone else's anthem.

563
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,559
(indistinct chatter)

564
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:11,279
My whole family and I just took

565
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:15,759
a big (sighs) sigh, like,
okay, we did it.

566
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,559
Everything that we ever thought

567
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,440
we could do, and as far as
we thought we could make it,

568
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,960
we were right.

569
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,359
- And we are most pleased to be
joined now by Picabo Street.

570
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,160
Newly Crown silver medalist
in ladies downhill.

571
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,359
Congratulations to you.
- Thank you.

572
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,480
(crowd cheers)

573
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,119
- It was the warrior came
home with the victory.

574
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,519
- Picabo, can I get my picture
taken with you?

575
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,559
- Sure!
- Alright.

576
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,119
[Picabo] The top of
my list for things

577
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,680
I'm aiming at,
being a role model

578
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,559
now and what not, I'm aiming
to the children,

579
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,799
more so than anything.
I get such a pleasure out

580
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,319
of being around the kids
and seeing what I mean to them.

581
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,039
- She couldn't just walk through

582
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,599
the airport anymore
without being recognized.

583
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,000
(cheering)

584
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,359
[Announcer]
Downhill silver medalist

585
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,039
Picabo Street arrived
in Salt Lake City.

586
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:15,359
- Her winning and her
success made

587
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,920
the family successful
and gave opportunities.

588
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,880
Even at 21 years old, that's
a lot on someone's shoulders.

589
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:26,119
- Picabo, we're thinking about
making you a Gladiator.

590
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,359
How about that?

591
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,480
- Well, I got to win some
more medals first.

592
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,599
Elmo.

593
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,279
I didn't win a medal
for playing Picabo.

594
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,319
- No?

595
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,519
- And we've named
a street after you.

596
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,519
You have your own street.

597
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:40,720
And there's...

598
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:43,000
(clapping)

599
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,920
[Picabo]
My dad gave me a sweater,

600
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,079
and he bought me in Glamor,
and I wore it.

601
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,200
And I remember feeling really
stoked to be, like,

602
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,240
honoring Norway and honoring the
Olympics and honoring my dad.

603
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,680
And

604
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,319
he was my Superman and my all
in advocate and the person

605
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,559
who believed in me the most
and did the most for me.

606
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:07,200
But he was also
the biggest distraction.

607
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,599
I think he honestly spent his

608
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,079
entire adult life in denial
that he had diabetes.

609
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,799
There was a point in time when

610
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:16,960
he was manageable as
a diabetic, right?

611
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,960
I'd catch him, he'd be like,
I'd come home,

612
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,079
and he'd be on the couch
with the remote like this.

613
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,920
- But if I said, hey, dad,
you need to get a drink.

614
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,119
Then here came the combative,

615
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,960
oh, you just, you just...

616
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,559
you just, you know,

617
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,240
mess with me, leave me alone.

618
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:36,119
And those times would escalate,

619
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,519
and you get into
situations where

620
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,119
it can get physical.

621
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,519
And we had that, too.

622
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:47,440
We had domestic violence.

623
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,720
[Picabo] He had kicked
my mom so hard

624
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:54,119
in the shoulder up against
the cabin that he separated her

625
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,480
cartilage off her sternum

626
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,200
and broke a rib.

627
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,279
I headed home to be the referee

628
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:08,200
and be in the middle
of my family dynamics again.

629
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,480
The pressure on us as a family
to try and maintain our

630
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,559
composure, for me to
keep our big secret secret,

631
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,319
and for all these corporations
are going,

632
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,759
We love you.
You're this great all American

633
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,319
family, and we want
to support you.

634
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,319
And so here I am all along,
trying to make the show

635
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:31,319
with my skiing and be this
positive, like all American.

636
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,440
And I'm fighting
to get this done.

637
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,200
And I'm representing,
and you can, too.

638
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,720
And it doesn't matter
where you came from.

639
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:39,200
And all the while, I'm like...

640
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,559
And you just keep fighting and
grinding and struggling through.

641
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:51,400
Climbing that next mountain,
looking for that next view.

642
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:58,720
(indistinct announcer)

643
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,559
[Announcer]
Silver in the Olympics,

644
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,119
but never a World Cup winner.
Picabo Street has been

645
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,000
a threat to fix
that every time out.

646
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,240
World Cup win seems
only a matter of time.

647
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,599
(upbeat music)

648
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,319
[Picabo] I don't know why,
but it seemed to me like a lot

649
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,960
of times Americans would rise
out of nowhere,

650
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,119
win an Olympic medal, and then
fall back into nowhere again.

651
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,160
(indistinct announcer)

652
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,119
- The fact that I walked away
from a beater like that without

653
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,200
getting hurt was something
that was pretty significant

654
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,960
to me, that, believe it or not,
gave me a lot of confidence.

655
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,279
And that was kind

656
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,319
of the confidence I needed
to go into the season.

657
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,279
And I just built from there.

658
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,680
I never set out to be a flash
in the pan in the sport.

659
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,200
And what the Olympics did for me

660
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,599
is proved to me that no matter
how intense the level

661
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,079
of competition you throw at me,
I'm ready for it.

662
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,079
(upbeat music)

663
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,160
[Announcer[ Street was
skiing against 1:41:51

664
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,519
and she didn't just beat it,
she destroyed it.

665
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,839
And so the day belonged

666
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,559
to Street, her first
ever World Cup win.

667
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,160
Street's margin of victory
in skiing terms was huge.

668
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,000
- I'm extremely happy, I can't

669
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,960
explain how happy
I am right now.

670
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,839
- When you win in Europe

671
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,880
for the first time,
you are a superstar.

672
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,200
You're just looked
upon differently.

673
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,720
- We went from showing

674
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:38,400
that there's huge potential
to full on, very quick.

675
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:44,039
- In sports,
Olympian Picabo Street is

676
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:46,240
making skiing
history this season.

677
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:49,720
Racing in Austria,
Street won her third straight

678
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,519
World Cup downhill, something
no American has ever done.

679
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:57,960
She has now won four downhills
this year. That is one more than

680
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,720
any American, male or
female, has ever won.

681
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:03,240
(indistinct announcer)

682
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,000
(upbeat music)

683
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,119
- With two races remaining,

684
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,440
Street is first in the World Cup
downhill standings.

685
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,679
No American has ever
won the downhill title.

686
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,079
[Picabo] We sat down that night
in Ernst goes

687
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,599
the deal is you're leading

688
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,719
the downhill standings by so far
that if you finish the top three

689
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,960
tomorrow, you'll win
the downhill title tomorrow.

690
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,239
And I was like, wow!

691
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,000
(crowd cheering)

692
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,239
(announcer speaking
in foreign language)

693
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,599
(announcer speaking
in foreign language)

694
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,360
- It was the first time
ever that the

695
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
US won the overall
title in downhill.

696
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,239
(announcer speaking
in foreign language)

697
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,760
[Picabo]
Standing on that top step,

698
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,440
receiving that globe like it's
the most comfortable zone I've

699
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,719
been in, because that's
a day in, day out grind.

700
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,039
There's no,

701
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,559
That was a flash in the pan.
That was a fluke.

702
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:10,880
Nothing. There's no writing
that off.

703
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,159
(announcer speaking
in foreign language)

704
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,519
- I'm really happy
with the whole season.

705
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:19,800
I wasn't able to continue

706
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,719
at quite that high level,
winning every race like

707
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,280
Picabo, but I was consistently
in there every single race,

708
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,559
and I think it's
ended on a good note.

709
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,360
- It's incredible.

710
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,800
I've been around for a long

711
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,920
time, so it's not
that easy to get.

712
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,960
That's an incredible

713
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,559
accomplishment
for American skiing.

714
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,920
- When they handed that thing

715
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,239
to me, it was
one of the more unexpected

716
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,360
and gratifying moments
in skiing for me.

717
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,519
But what I realized,
as many competitors do,

718
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:54,480
once you win one,
you want another one.

719
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,039
It's addicting.

720
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,960
(laughter)

721
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,559
Oh, I'm not crying.
No way.

722
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,159
Just the downhill title. Ha!

723
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:06,159
I cried like a baby when they
put that thing in my hand.

724
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,559
(indistinct chatter)

725
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,719
- We were the team to beat
and to drive into every one

726
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,400
of these resorts and show
up and be the team to beat.

727
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,000
The Americans hadn't felt like

728
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:25,960
that for 15 years,
so that was a big change.

729
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:30,960
[Announcer] Picabo Street
from Sun Valley, Idaho.

730
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,320
- Olympic silver medalist

731
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,039
Picabo Street has a winning
personality to go with her

732
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,760
winning streak.
And what a streak.

733
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,280
You and Hilary Lynn.

734
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,599
I mean, did you win every single
race but one downhill this year?

735
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,320
- Yeah, we did.
It was an interesting year

736
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,480
for sure, for the Europeans
to be chasing the Americans

737
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:48,840
for the first time ever.

738
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,159
(cheering)

739
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,360
I feel awesome about what I've

740
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,719
just done, and believe it or
not, it's made me more hungry.

741
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,760
If you can leave it to win more.
I'm such a pig.

742
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,199
I can't get enough,
but I'm into it.

743
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:04,920
I'm liking winning,
and I'm going to continue.

744
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,039
- I have a letter from

745
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,480
Mr. Bill Clinton
in the White House,

746
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,119
our President of the United
States. Miss Picabo Street.

747
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:13,480
- Finally!
(laughter)

748
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:18,519
- Dear Picabo, your exceptional
talent and your winning attitude

749
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:20,559
have captured the hearts
of Americans and earned

750
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:22,760
the admiration of athletes
around the globe.

751
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,960
(clapping)

752
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,719
- Now, my message to the kids,
get out and free ski and let

753
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,519
this mountain turn you
into the skier that you can be.

754
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,000
Because it will.

755
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:35,480
The feeling of flying on your
boards with 7,000 pounds of

756
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,320
G-Force on your leg and you're
just making the fattest arc

757
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,280
and there's no snow coming off
your edge and, you know,

758
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,719
you're just smoking and it's
like, that's the feeling.

759
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,679
It's the scheme feeling that you
know and you yearn for.

760
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:48,039
And when you feel it, there's
nothing better in the world.

761
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,840
There is nothing that's
tops a flat ski arc.

762
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,920
(laughter and applause)

763
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,840
- You changed the game as far as
getting sponsors,

764
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,320
being in the media in that way,
you put skiing on the map.

765
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,400
You are the reason why I did
all the things that I did.

766
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,280
Business too.

767
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,320
You transcended skiing.

768
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,079
- I remember being really
proud to be a Nike athlete.

769
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:15,440
I was their first
winter athlete, period.

770
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,880
The wind howls because it
knows it has to race me.

771
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,719
I have my own shoe,
which I still have some.

772
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,480
- I remember being like,
Holy (bleep)

773
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,840
A ski racer has a freaking shoe.

774
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:32,760
That for me was like,
this is what's possible.

775
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,119
- Yeah.

776
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:36,599
- Like you raised the glass
ceiling by a thousand.

777
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:41,519
- Do we out our GS skis
in the cargo again?

778
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:43,480
- GS skis in the cargo.

779
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,400
- My mom and dad didn't come
watch me race a lot,

780
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,599
so when they did

781
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:52,480
come to watch me race,
it was really special.

782
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:54,639
And I remember my mom
coming over to Europe.

783
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,480
The chamois hang out
up there on the rocks.

784
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:00,400
- Yeah.
- In the sun, in the morning.

785
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,000
- There is a big portion of her

786
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:06,800
life that she grew up
on the road away from mom.

787
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,239
She went from a girl to a woman
on her own in a hotel room.

788
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,679
So the moments that they had to
come together, they cherished.

789
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:18,639
- Good morning.
- Morning.

790
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,039
- That's a ski.
- I'm a beginner.

791
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:24,719
(laughter)

792
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,880
* Little darling *

793
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,000
* It's been a long cold *

794
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:33,519
* lonely winter *

795
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:35,039
* Little darling *

796
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,840
* It seems like years
since it's been clear *

797
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,199
* Ohhh *

798
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:45,360
* Here come the sun *

799
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,559
- This is so gorgeous

800
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:54,039
and dramatic.

801
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,360
- Rocks! Big rocks.

802
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,119
- It's nice having
your mom here.

803
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,280
Is that an inspiration?

804
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,719
- Oh, yeah, totally.
She hasn't ever been

805
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,239
to a European race before,
so it's fun for me to know

806
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,840
that she's getting
to see it over here.

807
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,599
She's getting to see

808
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:13,760
the whole European scene and how
big of a deal it is here.

809
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,440
- That's great.

810
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,880
- Plus, it's nice for
her to meet

811
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,840
all the people here that I know
and that I talk about all

812
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,840
the time that are all my friends
and the people in my life

813
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,639
for eight months
out of the year.

814
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:29,639
(calm music)

815
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,440
- We've conquered the Castle,

816
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,960
we kicked the Austrians and the
Germans and the Italians off.

817
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,440
They are angry.

818
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,320
What we got to do now is we got

819
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,239
to come up with a plan
to stay at the top.

820
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,280
- You just have to stand on it
where everybody said to you,

821
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,239
It's not like you're going
to get thrown all around.

822
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,559
The ice patches
are not that bad.

823
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,360
- Defending the spot is tough.

824
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,599
The visualizing of where we
want to go is very important.

825
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:06,559
The dream to be there.

826
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,880
I always had the
feeling that Picabo

827
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,679
very nicely reacted
to images like this.

828
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,360
(calm music)

829
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,519
[Announcer] Picabo Street

830
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,079
came to Sierra Nevada with only
one thing in her mind.

831
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:35,880
The gold medal in her favorite
discipline, the downhill.

832
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,039
Over a second
ahead of anybody else.

833
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,519
And Street, who is
a real gliding machine.

834
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,360
Her own unique style
slicing through the air.

835
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,280
(announcer speaking
in foreign language)

836
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,760
(yelling indistinctly)

837
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,199
(cheering)

838
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,039
[Announcer] Picabo Street had
a massive advantage.

839
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,719
Point 65 on a second.

840
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,360
(Picabo screaming)

841
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:34,119
- I'm the guy that, I over
amp, just like that.

842
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:36,119
So I can take her too far.

843
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,880
Where Baba can mellow her out.

844
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,679
- Did you hear dad yelling
when you got to the finish?

845
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,320
- Yeah, I did.
He was the first person I heard.

846
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,960
I turn around and
he's going, yeah.

847
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I'm like, Hi, dad.

848
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:47,119
- What were you thinking about

849
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:49,760
when you were
going off the jump?

850
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,159
- Well, I'll tell you what.

851
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,840
Looking at the ground
way down there.

852
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,320
I went, oh, my God.

853
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,000
I caught so much air.
Holy.

854
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:58,440
And then I was like, okay,
get back in the course.

855
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,599
Get back in the course.
- I love it.

856
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:02,039
I don't get to see a race a lot,

857
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,559
but on TV and you
can smell it and hear it here.

858
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,639
Like, car racing stuff.

859
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:10,400
(whistling)

860
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:14,639
(indistinct announcer)

861
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,239
- To win.
What was it?

862
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,920
Two overall titles?

863
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,039
Back to back.

864
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:22,760
That is...

865
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,320
That's big time.

866
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,159
* Picabo knows what to do *

867
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:29,000
* She's a downhill pilot *

868
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,920
* And a snow girl runner *

869
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,400
* Picabo gonna get you *

870
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:35,840
- I remember working with some

871
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,159
graphics people at Nike on a
commercial called Sister Slope.

872
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:45,639
And she was this, like, cartoon
animated character of me.

873
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:46,960
Oh, she was so rad.

874
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,840
Long hair, great long legs,
purple downhill suit.

875
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,360
* *

876
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,679
They were supposed to release it

877
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:00,480
for that next season,
but I blew my knee out.

878
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,800
[News Broadcaster]
Picabo tore ligaments

879
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,280
and cartilage in her left knee
when she crashed during

880
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,400
a practice run in Vail,
Colorado.

881
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,039
Street is not expected to ski
again for at least six months.

882
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:12,559
[Picabo]
I had tasted that success.

883
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,719
I had won those races.
I had won the title.

884
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,519
And it was like, dangle dangle.
- The downhill title.

885
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:19,320
The World Championships.
- Exactly.

886
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,679
And so here's...
- The Olympics.

887
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:23,519
- Here's another year
of smoking everybody.

888
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:26,280
But nope. Instead, we're going
to sideline you for a second.

889
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,199
[News Broadcaster]
So like many skiers before her,

890
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:30,519
Picabo was wheeled
into the operating room of

891
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:31,920
Dr. Richard Steadman.

892
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,079
One of the best knee
surgeons in the world.

893
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:36,800
But unlike other skiers,

894
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,960
Picabo insisted she'd be
awake for the entire operation.

895
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:46,079
- What were you
doing with that?

896
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,480
(indistinct)

897
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,079
- Okay.

898
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,800
I talked to him a lot during.
I was asking him a lot

899
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,519
of questions, and it was very
interesting and it seemed

900
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,039
very difficult.
And he's very good at it.

901
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,119
- Who's driving that thing?

902
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:08,239
- It's not me!
(laughter)

903
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:10,440
Yee-haw!

904
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,559
Fixed up.
Ready to go.

905
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,840
- I'm Jake Shores.

906
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,320
I am a chiropractor that's
trained in neurology.

907
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,039
So she first injured her left
ACL in '89,

908
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:25,679
and then she did it again in
1996.

909
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:28,920
The fact that she did the same
thing twice

910
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,920
makes the surgery more
difficult,

911
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,480
the recovery more difficult.

912
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:34,039
And then most of the
time you're gonna have

913
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,480
a greater decrease in function

914
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:37,639
because of the compromise of the
joint.

915
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,639
- She tore the medial collateral
ligament,

916
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:43,360
which keeps the knee from going
this way.

917
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,960
She tore a back corner
ligament in this area,

918
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,440
which protects in this
direction.

919
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:52,360
She stressed this ligament

920
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,119
and then she also bruised the
bone

921
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:58,800
in the back of the joint.

922
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,119
And then actually had a
small compression fracture

923
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,079
of the bone in this area
when the knee went like that.

924
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,119
So it was an extensive injury.

925
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,559
- That's why you needed a little
more room

926
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:14,760
in that canal was to get that
piece of bone through there.

927
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,960
- To get it through just right.
- Before you screwed it on.

928
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,159
Little fat little screws.

929
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,719
- Five, four, three, two, one.

930
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,960
Relax. Good.

931
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,679
(Picabo exhaling shakily)

932
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:27,719
- [Doctor] What's that?

933
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,760
- [Picabo] I'm trying really
hard.

934
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,119
- [Doctor] I know you are.

935
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,159
- From my perspective,

936
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:34,400
it doesn't seem like it changed
anything,

937
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,920
but you didn't question
what you were doing

938
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,320
or where you were going,

939
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,199
or if you were gonna make
the Olympics from that point?

940
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:42,639
- No, there wasn't a question at
all.

941
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:43,559
It was like, how,

942
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:46,079
pardon my French, but how
(bleep) long

943
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:48,559
is this break gonna take 'cause
I didn't order this breakup.

944
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:51,280
(wind howling)

945
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,280
- Back where we belong, huh?

946
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,000
- [Reporter] So Peek, how's the
road

947
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:03,360
from recovery been for you?

948
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,880
- It's been great, actually.

949
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,280
What it has done is let the
love of skiing resurface for me

950
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,440
and that's what I'm feeling
right now.

951
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,159
I think I was so excited
actually,

952
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:15,400
when I got to the top last
time that I literally puked.

953
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,559
The skiing feels absolutely
awesome.

954
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:20,119
Wind in my face, just,

955
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,199
just right.

956
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:26,239
The knee is perfect.

957
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,239
Working just like it's supposed
to.

958
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,000
It's just a little bit weak,
obviously,

959
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:32,679
because it's just needs some
more time.

960
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,119
(anticipatory music)

961
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:37,880
I mean, it was great to
be back on snow and all,

962
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,119
but definitely wasn't ready.

963
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:42,400
- [Newscaster] Street
has had several setbacks.

964
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,920
Picabo is still not ready
to join her teammates

965
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,559
and is getting away
from the media's glare.

966
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,920
Last week, she went off
to a secret location

967
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,119
for more training and more
rehab.

968
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,559
- The most intense training
that I had had going in

969
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,719
was in super G.

970
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,400
We were trying to emulate
downhill

971
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,039
and we were running real fast
super G

972
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,119
for two weeks straight in
Colorado.

973
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:06,880
- [Newscaster] Most observers
say Picabo

974
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,440
is simply running out of time

975
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,559
to be a serious threat in
Nagano.

976
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:14,400
- Sweden was the last
race before the Olympics.

977
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,000
The new-shaped ski was
what everybody was on,

978
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:20,360
but I couldn't get them figured.

979
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:23,400
In downhill, especially the
speed events

980
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,880
there has been a concern about
being able

981
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,000
to limit the speed of the
athletes

982
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:30,280
because our athletes today
are so much stronger,

983
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,079
they're better trained, in
the equipment is a lot better.

984
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,760
There is a concern about
building up too much speed.

985
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,159
(announcer speaking
indistinctly)

986
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,039
- With the opening of the
Winter Olympics in Nagano

987
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,679
now less than a week away,

988
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:06,559
America's Picabo Street
suffered a mild concussion

989
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:10,000
and some cuts and bruises,
but no serious injury

990
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:12,280
when she lost a ski and fell
yesterday

991
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,360
during a downhill run in Sweden.

992
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:18,480
- Usually the sooner
she calls after we know

993
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:20,880
that the race she's run,

994
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,760
the better chances are that
she's won,

995
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,679
and, boy, Dee and I were

996
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:28,079
fighting over each other
to the phone to, "Hello?"

997
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:31,280
And it's like, (breathing
heavily) "I'm all right."

998
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,360
- Ah, I broke juniors.

999
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:37,119
- "I broke my skis, dad. I broke
my skis."

1000
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:38,519
And I'm going, "Then you're in
one piece?"

1001
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,000
She's going, "Yeah, I've got
a little bit of dizziness

1002
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:43,400
and my eye's quivering
and my neck is sore."

1003
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,960
And I'm going "Well, hang in
there,

1004
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,760
we'll get you home and patch you
up

1005
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,920
and we'll get to Nagano."

1006
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,280
(stately brass music)

1007
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,719
- [Announcer] And the Olympic
torch

1008
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,199
has been winding through Japan,

1009
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:00,039
visiting every part of the
country

1010
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,960
on its way to the Olympic
stadium.

1011
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:06,719
In the end, it'll have
touched over 6,600 hands

1012
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,559
on the way to the Olympic
cauldron.

1013
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,719
50,000 people are expected to
gather here

1014
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,360
for this opening ceremony.

1015
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,000
Ancient religious rituals
mixed with modern technology

1016
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:23,679
blending together in a songful
prayer

1017
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:25,639
of hope for the 21st century.

1018
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,719
The United States is next.

1019
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,920
(crowd cheering)
(bells jangling)

1020
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,559
Led by flag bearer Eric Flaim.

1021
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:39,920
- Did you know, the team
voted me to carry the flag

1022
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,559
in the opening ceremonies?

1023
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,280
- But you didn't?
- I won that popularity.

1024
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,519
That was like such-
- That's huge.

1025
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:48,000
- A big moment in my life
as an Olympic athlete.

1026
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:49,119
I was like, (gasping)

1027
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:50,519
but I said, "I can't do it.

1028
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,960
I'm hurt. And I need rehab
and I can't go early."

1029
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,360
(slowly building triumphant
music)

1030
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:12,480
(jet engines roaring)

1031
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:16,440
- Was she 100% at the Games in
Nagano?

1032
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,320
That you normally have
with an athlete? No.

1033
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,559
- [Announcer] They're the
best in super G this season.

1034
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:24,480
Seizinger of Germany,

1035
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:25,320
Ertl of Germany,

1036
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,679
along with the Austrian Geotschl

1037
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:29,440
and Isolde Kostner, always
dangerous from Italy.

1038
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,199
Picabo Street way down on the
pack

1039
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:32,559
where she skied only four

1040
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:34,639
of the six super G's so far this
year.

1041
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:36,920
(skiers chattering)
(radio squawking indistinctly)

1042
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,679
- We did something really
outside the box that day

1043
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:43,360
where after we inspected
the course in the morning,

1044
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,400
I saw it was a very
straightforward course set

1045
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,119
that they normally don't have in
super G

1046
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:51,440
because the core setter was a
Russian

1047
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,360
and one of his athletes had
a huge chance to win a medal.

1048
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,079
So he set a course that
was basically straight.

1049
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,719
I spoke with my coach and said,

1050
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,519
"Pull out the downhill skis

1051
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,320
and give it a shot because
they were no turns."

1052
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:10,000
(radio chatter in foreign
language)

1053
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:11,320
- [Coach] Okay.

1054
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,079
- Gather all my stuff, out
the door to the ski room.

1055
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,480
I get to the ski room,

1056
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:16,920
and my downhill training skis
are outside the ski room.

1057
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,159
And I'm like, "Wait a minute."

1058
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:21,360
- And then I spoke with
Picabo and I said to Peek,

1059
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,559
"We're gonna let you go on
the downhills skis today.

1060
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:24,559
What do you think?"

1061
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:25,840
And she said, "Whatever you
say."

1062
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,320
And when you have trust with
an athlete, it's really cool.

1063
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,559
[Announcer] It will
be a smooth track for her.

1064
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,760
A possibility it'll get faster
by the time Seizinger runs

1065
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,880
because it's sunny out there

1066
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,440
and a glaze might form on the
track.

1067
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,519
(horn blaring)
- Go, go, go, go, go!

1068
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:42,519
- [Announcer] And
America's Picabo Street.

1069
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,440
She's never won in super
giant slalom before,

1070
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,480
but she said at a press release
prior today's competition

1071
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:51,480
she's really desperate
to do well in this event

1072
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:54,280
as part of her preparation
to take the downhill title

1073
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,320
of the Olympic Games away

1074
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,719
from Germany's Katja Seizinger,
very much her archrival.

1075
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:04,000
- She's had
only seven races this year,

1076
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:07,079
coming back from the knee
injury of December '96

1077
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,840
and a crash at Are, Sweden last
week.

1078
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,119
- This is where she excels.

1079
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:13,119
She's got a natural
ability to work the terrain

1080
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:15,760
beneath her skis while
in a tucked position.

1081
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,119
She just feels the snow.

1082
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:21,119
(muffled crowd exclaiming)

1083
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:22,239
There's that first jump, goes
back,

1084
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,639
and she gets through it a little
bit wide.

1085
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:26,239
That's gonna cost her, Tim.

1086
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,920
[Announcer] She's getting
bounced around on the hairpin.

1087
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,320
Sun Terrace hairpin.

1088
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,119
Now a series of tight technical
turns.

1089
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:34,840
Getting good pressure
against the turning ski,

1090
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,159
nice and high and early.

1091
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:38,719
This is good skiing from Street.

1092
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,719
- Picabo Street, in early
trouble,

1093
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,199
now flying over this top.

1094
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:44,119
- Using her downhill skills

1095
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:45,719
to good effect off these
rollers.

1096
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,119
These jumps throwing
the skier into the air.

1097
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,320
Street, never better than
eleventh on the World Cup tour,

1098
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,960
but the Olympic Games is
a special temperament.

1099
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,519
A special psych is required.

1100
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,320
And look at the margin.

1101
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,039
1.14 seconds faster than
Ingeborg Helen Marken

1102
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,960
Picabo Street has had a flyer.

1103
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,960
- When she popped that
run, nobody ever said,

1104
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,639
"We've got the gold now."

1105
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,400
It's hold your breath until
the last girl crosses the line

1106
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,880
and then for sure.

1107
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,840
- This is Michaela Dorfmeister,

1108
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,119
a 25-year-old from Neuchatel,
Austria.

1109
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,760
Here she is, racing for gold
in the Olympics super G.

1110
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,000
- A beautiful flight.

1111
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:26,760
She stays in her tuck all the
way through.

1112
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,320
No, this woman is not your
average Austrian hausfrau.

1113
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,679
- There is the time to beat
Dorfmeister

1114
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:33,679
over the final jump.

1115
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:35,199
One one hundredth behind.

1116
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:38,719
Dorfmeister, she's in the second
place

1117
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,800
and she nearly got into first.

1118
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:44,079
But it will be gold for Picabo
Street.

1119
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:46,000
[Woman] Yeah, Peeky!

1120
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:49,000
- Her first ever victory in a
super G race

1121
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:52,440
for Picabo Street, and it is
Olympic gold.

1122
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,519
- Mom? Hi, mom.

1123
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:57,519
Mom, I won.

1124
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,079
(laughs) Thank you.

1125
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:03,719
Thanks, Mom. I miss you.

1126
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,960
I wish you were here.

1127
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,320
(laughs) It's okay, I'm
gonna win more than one, mom.

1128
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,119
I'm gonna bring them both
to Maui, okay? (laughs)

1129
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:20,440
(man speaking in foreign
language)

1130
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,400
I love you too. Wanna talk to
dad?

1131
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,239
- That snow will kick your ass.

1132
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,079
- That will kick us both, dad.

1133
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:35,639
Great, did you talk to mom?

1134
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,079
- Yeah, mom knows.

1135
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,960
(gentle music)

1136
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,199
- What a day.
- What a day.

1137
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,599
It's a dream come true for me

1138
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,599
It's something that everyone
dreams of all their life

1139
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:48,800
when they're an athlete.

1140
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,320
And for me, it's been
such a difficult season.

1141
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,519
I've had so many ups and so many
downs.

1142
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,559
It's been really long, you know?

1143
00:55:56,599 --> 00:55:58,360
It's been a long time
that I've been waiting

1144
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,840
to get back into form to be able

1145
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,480
to attack the course all out.

1146
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:02,840
- If it was me, I would've cried
now.

1147
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,320
- I've already cried and
stopped and cried and stopped.

1148
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,559
So it's been very emotional.

1149
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,440
[Announcer] And in second
place, Michaela Dorfmeister.

1150
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,559
(gentle inspirational music)

1151
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,639
[Announcer] Medals will be
presented

1152
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:30,519
by Mr. John Claude Killy
IOC member in France,

1153
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:31,920
downhill, giant slalom

1154
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,519
and special slalom gold
medalist in Grenoble in 1968.

1155
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,679
Olympic champion and gold
medalist Picabo Street,

1156
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:42,719
United States of America.

1157
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,559
(crowd cheering)

1158
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,719
- When John Clark puts
the metal around my neck,

1159
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,000
he knew he had crushed me,
right.

1160
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:58,239
He knew it. And he said,

1161
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,519
your father told me we're gonna
do

1162
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:01,119
this when you were a kid.

1163
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:03,079
I'm so proud of you and
I'm so glad to be here

1164
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,960
so honored, so honored to
be here, to give you this.

1165
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,840
(crowd cheering)

1166
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,679
(gentle inspirational music)

1167
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,320
("The Star-Spangled Banner"
playing)

1168
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:25,400
So I started singing there,

1169
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,960
I'm dumb and I'm crying
and singing in the hall.

1170
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,960
It's just like the culmination
of

1171
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,559
everything coming together

1172
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:31,840
in one shot it's magical,

1173
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,400
you feel like a rock star,

1174
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,320
you're crying because
the joy in your belly

1175
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,679
is so beyond anything
you thought it would ever

1176
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:38,920
be and you thought it would be

1177
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,920
the most wonderful thing ever,

1178
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,480
and it's better than that.

1179
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:45,880
(crowd applauding)

1180
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,039
[Announcer] Congratulations
to these Olympic champions.

1181
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:52,519
(gentle spirited music)

1182
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:10,760
[Picabo] The night
after I won my gold medal

1183
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,480
that was a super fun night

1184
00:58:12,519 --> 00:58:14,679
and the next day was like a
twilight zone.

1185
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:19,519
My dad had ended up
MIA for a little while,

1186
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:23,360
and so he kind of spun and
did his usual deviation of,

1187
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,119
"oh, let me just blow myself off

1188
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:28,119
and not take care of myself."

1189
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,880
- We went out and partying.

1190
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,840
We got home and I'm going,

1191
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,320
"God, you can't get food out.

1192
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,039
I don't want to hear about it,"
whoa.

1193
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,519
And then Baba pushed
her button and (bleep)

1194
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,679
(mumbling)

1195
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,599
and he went up to cool it and
went to bed.

1196
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:43,119
[Picabo] I remember him
coming back to the house

1197
00:58:43,159 --> 00:58:45,039
you know I said, "where were
you?"

1198
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:47,280
And he's like, "oh, just out for
a walk."

1199
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,920
He had run into Tim Layden,
a sports illustrated writer.

1200
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,320
Do I need to worry about that
one?

1201
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,239
Maybe.

1202
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,559
Needless to say was pretty
distracting.

1203
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,000
Definitely, the closest we had
come

1204
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,000
to the elephant in the room
being

1205
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:07,360
seen and our secret coming out,

1206
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:12,440
and I didn't have a lot
of gusto after that for,

1207
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,400
you know getting feisty on the
hill.

1208
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:18,039
- This is the first Olympic
winter where

1209
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,119
all of the Alpine skiing
events have been rescheduled.

1210
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:22,719
The erratic weather has
stopped them from skiing

1211
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,719
five out of the past eight
days but today finally,

1212
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,039
they're able to ski.

1213
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,920
[Announcer] The ladies'
downhill.

1214
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,519
(crowd cheering)

1215
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:34,719
(air horn blowing)

1216
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:38,079
(air horn blowing)

1217
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:41,079

1218
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,159
(announcers chattering)

1219
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,519
(calm suspenseful music)

1220
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,599
[Commentator] Feather
soft touch on the snow.

1221
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:16,039
- She is almost just too behind.

1222
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:19,480
- And she too
gets thrown a little bit wide,

1223
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:21,960
but you can see there's just
there's room to move on this

1224
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,199
course. I don't think that a
perfect line

1225
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:25,599
is gonna be essential today.

1226
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:28,239
You've gotta just let the
skis run and attack the course

1227
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,519
and Picabo sure did that.

1228
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,000
- That is great split time on
2.05,

1229
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:36,960
she is only 5.100, she's
picked up a little here.

1230
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:49,280
- We didn't walk away with two.

1231
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,599
So it's a disappointment for me,

1232
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:53,239
normally should be a
disappointment for Picabo too.

1233
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,000
It's a disappointment
for the coaching staff

1234
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:56,559
because we'd lost the focus.

1235
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,559
[Interviewer] What
does having a gold medal

1236
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:00,039
in your hip pocket before

1237
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:01,920
you do the downhill, do to
your frame of mind in downhill?

1238
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,320
- Well it's tough, it's really
tough because I think there,

1239
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,639
there probably would have been
more hunger surfacing in me,

1240
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:08,519
but I try and look at the big
picture all the time and not

1241
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,119
get too caught up in the little
picture.

1242
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:12,320
And the big picture is maybe
I would have risked too much

1243
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,800
and hurt myself again today.

1244
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,000
If I had been that hungry and
not had won that gold medal

1245
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:17,360
already the super G's.

1246
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:19,559
I lost my downhill ski
on a couple of turns

1247
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:22,280
and that scary, you know,
I actually screamed.

1248
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,320
I'm just glad to be standing
down

1249
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,519
here talking to you one piece.

1250
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:25,719
I didn't want to hit
the fence again today.

1251
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,320
So I skied a bit tentative

1252
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,679
and you just can't do
that with this field.

1253
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:29,559
They're too good.

1254
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,800
It's amazing how our greatest
moments can

1255
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,920
like they can crush us, like
that was a crushing one.

1256
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:44,519
- The whole emotional
power that Picabo had

1257
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:47,320
was kind of empty after
she won the gold medal

1258
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,000
and we had to finish the season.

1259
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:51,280
We had new skis, new equipment.

1260
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,639
- I had blown off racing

1261
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:54,679
on the shape skis before Nagano

1262
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:55,840
'cause I wasn't familiar with

1263
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,320
them and didn't like them.

1264
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,280
So I went for it in the Crans.

1265
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:06,639
- American Olympic skiing
champion Picabo Street is

1266
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:09,880
spending Friday the 13th in
a hospital in Switzerland,

1267
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,639
Street fell today in the last
world cup

1268
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:15,599
downhill race of the season
and broke her left leg.

1269
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:17,920
Her doctor said, it'll be many
months now

1270
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,599
before she skis again.

1271
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,119
(Picabo wailing in pain)

1272
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,400
- I couldn't feel my body.

1273
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,360
I couldn't feel my legs
and I was really scared

1274
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,039
I was paralyzed, and I rolled
over and everything came with

1275
01:02:33,079 --> 01:02:36,320
me and I was so happy that
everything moved with me,

1276
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,719
but then the pain set in.

1277
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:42,480
It's crazy, it was the best
and the worst year of my life,

1278
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:44,840
I laid in the hospital
and was just lost really

1279
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,159
for several days going, "what is
going on?

1280
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:49,719
What is it just happened to me?"

1281
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,440
And it's always kind of in
this pattern in my life,

1282
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,559
whenever anything really good
happens.

1283
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:56,519
I need to just start holding
my breath because I know a

1284
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,000
disaster is right around the
corner

1285
01:02:58,039 --> 01:03:00,000
so that it can stay balanced.

1286
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:02,639
- What was it like to go
from the extreme of winning

1287
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:07,559
the Olympics to being there
with their leg broken in Crans?

1288
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,960
(Picabo chuckles)

1289
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:16,440
- It was a very, very dramatic
transition

1290
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,400
that produced depression
and I closed everything up

1291
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,960
and I just wanted to stay home.

1292
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:30,360
I couldn't get up and go
anywhere and I didn't want to,

1293
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,960
you know, my legs couldn't
carry me anywhere.

1294
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,639
- She fractured her left femur,

1295
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,480
which is the hardest bone
in your body to break.

1296
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:40,840
And this time she injured
the lateral meniscus

1297
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,800
of a right knee.

1298
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,000
They went in and fixed it and
surgically

1299
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,320
adhered it with plates.

1300
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,880
However you do that knowing
that in a few months,

1301
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,119
they're gonna go back in,

1302
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,119
cut you back open to pull the
plate out

1303
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:56,079
and then you have to rehab all
over again.

1304
01:03:56,119 --> 01:03:57,159
- I'd just catch myself crying.

1305
01:03:57,199 --> 01:03:59,920
and then it all pours in as to
why?

1306
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,079
And it's different things all
the way

1307
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:05,559
from those little things
that I said before,

1308
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,840
like "oh my, my legs are getting
small

1309
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,519
they're atrophying right
underneath me"

1310
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:14,719
to, "oh you know how am
I gonna get out of this?"

1311
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,119
To, "gosh do I even want to ski
anymore?"

1312
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:18,599
I mean, it's heavy this time.

1313
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,079
[News Broadcaster] In the speed
events, downhill

1314
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:25,639
and super-G, Picabo Street is

1315
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:29,360
the greatest North American
male or female ever to race.

1316
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,039
And she has paid a physical
and emotional price.

1317
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,679
Note that no other US
skiers are in the top five.

Street has nothing left to
prove.

(soft music)

1322
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:47,960
- Does it hurt, physically
hurt again when you watch it?

1323
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,320
- It hurts my heart.

1324
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,760
It hurts my stomach, my
soul, you know, deep inside.

1325
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,519
Like the part that drives
me, it hurts that part.

1326
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,719
And that has never been touched
before.

- And that thing that got me out
of it was

1329
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,719
actually Mother's Day came.

1330
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,599
And I hadn't been out of
my room in quite some time.

1331
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:14,239
And I thought, maybe I'll go
wish my mom

1332

a Happy Mother's Day in the
kitchen today.

1333

It's really far away, but
I think I can make it.

1334
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,400
And I had been interacting with
my mom

1335
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,400
'cause I needed her help to
go to the freaking bathroom.

on-campus today.

1342
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,599
And many of them were there
to get a peek at Picabo.

1343
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:42,039
- Back at her first appearance

1344
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,199
in Oregon today, since she
broke her leg in Switzerland.

1345

you been?

1346
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:47,639
Good?
- Good!

1347
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:48,480
- Woo!

dad and I were absolutely, and
mom,

1350
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,360
adamant about, "Look, you need
to rehab,

1351
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,679
and you need to come back with
the mindset

1352
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:03,800
that you're gonna be a
world-class athlete again.

1353

That way, even if you're not,

you at least will be able
to walk up and down stairs

for the rest of your life."

1356
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:12,519

injury that she went through.

01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,320
I was like, "No!

1363
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:26,079
I can not believe that you
guys wanna make fun of my legs.

1364
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,960
I am insulted."

1365
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,639
And then I kind of sat
and thought about it,

1366
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:33,079
and I kind of digested it a
little bit.

1367
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:34,159
And then I went, "You know what?

1368
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,079
Maybe it would be exactly what I
need."

1369
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,440
(audience applauding)

1370
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,639
- For the International Olympic
Committee,

1371
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:42,559
has decided

1372
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:48,559
to award the organization of
the 19th Olympic winter games

1373
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:52,760
in 2002 to the city of Salt Lake
City.

1374
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,599
(crowd cheering)

1375
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:00,400
- Towards the end of my
career, I started to gauge,

1376
01:07:01,159 --> 01:07:02,760
like, I knew nothing was gonna
top

1377
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,000
the Olympics in Salt Lake.

1378
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:05,559
Win, lose, or draw.

1379
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,000
Like, come on!

1380
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,280
The Olympics in front of
American crowd.

1381
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,440
Boo yah!

1382
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,760
Like, it doesn't get better, I
don't care.

1383
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,559
- So many skiers, you know,
we had so many injuries,

1384
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:17,119
and they get injured and
that's their last race.

1385
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:20,760
It's nice to be able to
end on your own terms.

1386
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,880
[Reporter] Now, after 20 months

1387
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,119
of grueling rehabilitation,

1388
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:26,239
Picabo is back on her skies,

1389
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,559
and considering another Olympic
run.

1390
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,159
- You gotta make Nationals.

1391
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:33,440
Then you gotta make the Olympic
team.

1392
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,119
It isn't like, "Oh, well
you won four years ago.

1393
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:38,119
So we're automatically
gonna put you on the team."

1394
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:40,719
No, she had to, she had
to go race in New Orleans

1395
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,000
and Europe with tubs.

1396
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,840
[Interviewer] You can't have
fear when you're going down

1397
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,360
that mountain at 80 miles
an hour, not even an ounce.

1398
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,800
- No, because it's the
mountain is like a dog.

1399
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,960
It's going to smell that fear.

1400
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And it's going to get ya.

1401
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:55,039
It's going to bite you.

1402
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:56,440
I'll be ready probably by
November,

1403
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,280
December to hit the fence
again, I'm not planning on it,

1404
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,599
but I've got to be ready for
that.

1405
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:00,719
If I want to get back.

1406
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:05,079
- Throughout Peak's career, the
injuries that she sustained,

1407
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:07,400
left her in a position
that as she is recovering

1408
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,320
and training for the
salt lake games in 2002,

1409
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,960
she's doing it on the knees
of someone who's probably in

1410
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,279
their mid 60's to early 70's.

1411
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,239
- And you have to be very
careful two work through the

1412
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:23,600
comback to gain back the
trust to the equipment

1413
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,199
that's within the mind of the
ski racer.

1414
01:08:25,239 --> 01:08:27,680
- Do I have the right to say I
don't want

1415
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,039
to go if it's foggy?

1416
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,640
- No

1417
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,800
- No.

1418
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,079
All right.

1419
01:08:34,119 --> 01:08:36,760
- From letting it loose
and really go full blast

1420
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,319
and push the limit.

1421
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:40,119
It, it all happens in the, in
the head.

1422
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:42,479
It happens in the, in the brain.

1423
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,359
- 10 seconds,

1424
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,079
5,4,3

1425
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:48,560
- Go, go, go, go

1426
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:54,600
- The worst part about
it is packing your bags

1427
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,520
and living out of them
and being away from all

1428
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,560
the people that you really care
about.

1429
01:09:00,199 --> 01:09:01,960
You start to think about who,
you know,

1430
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,760
who am I and what am I doing?

1431
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:08,239
(audience cheering)

1432
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:10,079
Am I stuck in this little world

1433
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:11,119
of I'm a competitive athlete?

1434
01:09:11,159 --> 01:09:12,319
And that's what I'm all about.

1435
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:14,760
And, and I'm not evolving as a
person.

1436
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,479
- Three months, four months
of a year, and the same bag,

1437
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,720
you know, when you're skiing
well,

1438
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,319
yeah, it is glamorous,

1439
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:29,279
but when you're skiing slow and
you're not performing, it's,

1440
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:30,640
it's lonely on the road.

1441
01:09:32,119 --> 01:09:33,720
- So the training program's
getting juggled around and it's,

1442
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,319
and it's getting specific,

1443
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,199
whether or not to come to a
dry line camp now is a little

1444
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:38,720
bit iffy and, you know,

1445
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,680
sit next to the volleyball coach

1446
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,960
and watch them play volleyball.

1447
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,680
That kills me, you know,

1448
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,760
but I show up anyway and
like today I'm not going to

1449
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,760
water-ski cause I shouldn't,
I can, but I shouldn't.

1450
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,800
So I'm gonna get in the water
and I'm just gonna run in

1451
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,560
the water and get a good
workout.

1452
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,520
Ooh.

1453
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,800
Yeah.

1454
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,720
Well we've brought obviously
some young girls up.

1455
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,760
So Julia Mancuso and Lindsey
Kildow are our both very,

1456
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,039
very good young skiers.

1457
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:03,439
- When I was a little kid,

1458
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:07,319
I wanted to be famous and I want
to be

1459
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:11,960
the most decorated skier of all
time.

1460
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,359
They want what I've gotten and
more.

1461
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:16,680
And that to me is what I want to
see.

1462
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,119
That's what I want to see
when I look in their eyes,

1463
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,079
because I don't want to
walk away from the sport,

1464
01:10:20,119 --> 01:10:21,840
knowing that I set some
pretty big footsteps

1465
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,359
that may not be stepped in.

1466
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,399
- That winter, I just kind of
like, I, I was your shadow.

1467
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:32,399
I don't know if you
remember that in a sermonic.

1468
01:10:32,439 --> 01:10:34,720
Do you remember the
camp that we had there?

1469
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,319
And I, we were skiing super-G
and I said,

1470
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,439
"what are you looking at in
inspection"

1471
01:10:41,479 --> 01:10:44,079
because I wanted to know
like what you're looking at.

1472
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:45,119
And you said,

1473
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:46,920
"I'm looking at the fall line."

1474
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,000
And I said," how did you know,

1475
01:10:48,039 --> 01:10:50,199
how do you know where the fall
line is?"

1476
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:53,199
And you said, "I can't tell
you, you just have to know"

1477
01:10:53,239 --> 01:10:54,680
- You knew though that's why,

1478
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,720
cause you love the fall line
and you're in it all the time.

1479
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,600
- I know.

1480
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,760
But like, I remember that.

1481
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,079
- Tamara said to me one time,

1482
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:07,520
you're-- she didn't say
you were a disaster.

1483
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,399
Like she didn't flat out
to me, but she said to me,

1484
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:10,800
"she says, you have an
incredible fire.

1485
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,920
And when you finally learn
how to channel it, right,

1486
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,159
you're going to be unbeatable."

1487
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:15,199
And I was like,

1488
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:16,359
"what does that mean?

1489
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:17,079
What do I do?

1490
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:17,920
How do I do that?"

1491
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,520
Like, yeah. Okay.

1492
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,479
So that was our, that was that
exactly.

1493
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,359
- Wow.

1494
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:23,560
- At that point in your career,

1495
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,479
I think you're just on
a different trajectory

1496
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:30,079
and I wasn't sure like
what your mindset was.

1497
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:32,079
- What?

1498
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:32,960
- Take a picture

1499
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,720
- Ooh yes
- Who?

1500
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,119
- All together?

1501
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:41,119
- We're going to go to
the, the, the stadium,

1502
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,479
(crowd cheering)

1503
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,199
[Announcer] Ladies and
gentlemen,

1504
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:51,239
welcome to the opening ceremony
of

1505
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:53,840
the 19th Olympic winter games.

1506
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,760
(trumpets blowing)

1507
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,399
(crowd cheering)

1508
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:05,079
- Picabo Street, said she
probably would have retired,

1509
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,359
had not the next Olympics
been in her home country.

1510
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:10,680
So she's back for a last hurrah.

1511
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:14,000
[Announcer] The Olympic
flame is now approaching

1512
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:14,920
the stadium.

1513
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,760
(crowd cheering)

1514
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:22,920
Picabo Street and Cammi Granato.

1515
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:23,760
(Crowd cheering)

1516
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,119
- Proud members of

1517
01:12:25,159 --> 01:12:28,039
the Olympic team. Each a gold
medalist in Nagano.

1518
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:30,600
Street is a skier, Granato is
captain of

1519
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,960
the women's hockey team.

1520
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,119
And soon the moment everyone
has been waiting for.

1521
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:40,520
- I remember it being this
really methodical, euphoric,

1522
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,760
almost like dreamy moment
of climbing up those stairs,

1523
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,159
holding the torch.

1524
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:47,840
[Reporter] Street and
Granato march by Mike Eruzione,

1525
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,720
from the Miracle on
Ice hockey team of 1980

1526
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,119
that won the gold medal.

1527
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:56,079
[Picabo] It was so cool to be a
part

1528
01:12:56,119 --> 01:12:58,720
of such a beautiful moment for
our country

1529
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,960
and for the Olympics.

1530
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,199
[Announcer] Gold medal Hockey
team.

1531
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,000
Team USA

1532
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,680
(Crowd cheering)

1533
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,640
(soft piano music)

1534
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,000
[Picabo] In the back of my
mind, I'm thinking, you know,

1535
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:17,439
that was-- that might've been my
show.

1536
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,399
(calm music)

1537
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,159
(calm music)

1538
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,399
(calm music)

1539
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,039
- I'm with Picabo Street,

1540
01:13:49,079 --> 01:13:50,279
just below the women's start at
the lodge,

1541
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:51,840
and we're out of the public eye.

1542
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,560
24 people going in front of you,
does it change the plan at all?

1543
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,720
- It changes it a tiny bit.

1544
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,079
Obviously, with the warm
weather, the delays,

1545
01:13:58,119 --> 01:13:59,800
it's bumped us back to noon
today.

1546
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:00,920
We've got a pretty aggressive
line

1547
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,239
we wanna run off the jump today.

1548
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:04,520
And bottom line is, it's
a beautiful sunny day.

1549
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,039
It's my last day out here, so.
I've been enjoying it so far,

1550
01:14:07,079 --> 01:14:09,199
and we'll see if I can
make it another good one.

1551
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:14,039
(calm music)

1552
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:16,199
[Woman On Radio] You
guys, the key to this course

1553
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:18,000
is to attack, that's all there
is to it.

1554
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:20,840
Get low in the traverse up there

1555
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,920
and come down and just attack.

1556
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,760
The snow is nice, it's goopy.

1557
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,119
You just got to lay it over

1558
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:26,199
and believe in yourselves.

1559
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:28,279
Come on. There's no tricks. So
just go!

1560
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,560
(calm music)

1561
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,479
(calm music)

1562
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,720
[Announcer] Carol Montillet,
France, still the leader,

1563
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,079
followed by Kostner of
Italy, Goetschl of Austria,

1564
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:00,399
and all three of those women,

1565
01:15:00,439 --> 01:15:02,760
know there's only one
serious contender left

1566
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,800
who can drop into that medal
count.

1567
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,119
And here she is, Picabo Street.

1568
01:15:07,159 --> 01:15:10,079
(Skis clacking)

1569
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,359
(calm music)

1570
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,039
- Go, Picabo!

1571
01:15:19,079 --> 01:15:21,720
(Dee whistles)

1572
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:26,520
Go, Picabo! Come on, girl! Lets
see it!

1573
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,920
- Come on Peek!
- All right Peek, come on!

1574
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,319
[Coach] Good strong start now!
Come on!

1575
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:31,079
[Time Keeper] 10 seconds!
[Teammate] Go Peek!

1576
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:32,439
- Go girl!
- Come on Peek!

1577
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:35,000
[Teammate] Burn it up
girl! Charge it! Come on! Go!

1578
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:39,119
[Time Keeper] 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
(teammates cheering)

1579
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:41,119
[Announcer] Pushed to
display all of her success,

1580
01:15:41,159 --> 01:15:43,119
this is the run of her life.

1581
01:15:43,159 --> 01:15:44,640
- And she truly believes

1582
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,199
that she can do it, and
then she loves this course.

1583
01:15:47,239 --> 01:15:49,800
She feels like she owns
it. She skied well on it.

1584
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,119
She's fastest up at the top.
This is where she truly excels.

1585
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:56,119
Look at how wide her
stance is and her tuck.

1586
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:57,560
She just drops way down

1587
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,159
and lets her skis float above
the snow.

1588
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,000
(inspiring music)

1589
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,319
(inspiring music)

1590
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:21,720
(crowd cheering)

1591
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,159
(inspirational music)

1592
01:16:29,319 --> 01:16:31,119
[Announcer] Here's the
first jump over shooting star,

1593
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:32,359
not too bad.

1594
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:35,039
2/10 back however, so
that bobble up higher

1595
01:16:35,079 --> 01:16:36,640
has cost her time.

1596
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,159
- It's still not too late,

1597
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:40,479
there's some good turns.

1598
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,239
She skied well down here
on the bottom in training.

1599
01:16:42,279 --> 01:16:43,920
She needs to get back
into her tuck though.

1600
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,359
Looking a little tentative.

1601
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,119
(inspirational music)

1602
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:04,560
(inspirational music)

1603
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,960
(crowd cheering)

1604
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:27,479
(inspirational music)

1605
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:43,479
(crowd cheering)

1606
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:53,560
(cheering continues)

1607
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:01,439
- But I have nothing but
admiration

1608
01:18:01,479 --> 01:18:04,199
for a stellar effort by
this Olympic champion who,

1609
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,399
by all rights, shouldn't have
even been a contender here.

1610
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,640
The greatest American downhiller
ever taking a final bow.

1611
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,760
(crowd cheering)

1612
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:22,800
- You won that rose, kid.

1613
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,960
- I know. I know.

1614
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,760
- And you'd win that
rose, you know what happened.

1615
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,960
- Yep, it's all good.

1616
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,439
- Yeah. You had
'em for a while, man.

1617
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:34,279
It's good for ya. I'm
really proud of you, honey.

1618
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:37,720
- Thanks Dad,
thanks for everything.

1619
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,359
- You bet.

1620
01:18:39,399 --> 01:18:41,960
- No more 3 AM phone calls.
- Yeah!

1621
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,479
[Announcer] So for Picabo,
there's no storybook finish

1622
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,000
for the comeback girl.

1623
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:50,399
But she's leaving ski racing,
having brought more attention

1624
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:53,359
to her sport in the U S.
than anyone before her.

1625
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,279
- Best day I've ever had

1626
01:18:57,319 --> 01:18:59,479
in my ski racing career, it's
all because of you, thank you.

1627
01:19:02,119 --> 01:19:05,039
[Announcer] Turns out,
everyone's rooting for this-

1628
01:19:05,079 --> 01:19:07,439
- Thanks to my mom and dad.

1629
01:19:07,479 --> 01:19:09,199
You guys have been great
throughout my whole career.

1630
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:11,359
You've always supported
me and you've been there

1631
01:19:11,399 --> 01:19:13,479
waiting for that phone call
at 4 o'clock in the morning.

1632
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:18,680
Now we won't have to wait
anymore. I'll be home baby.
Whoo!

1633
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,199
And it's hard to explain to
people

1634
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:21,520
that that was rewarding for me.

1635
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:24,119
They're like, "What? You got you
16th."

1636
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,720
And I'm like, yeah, all the
history,

1637
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,760
all the water under the
bridge, all of the time,

1638
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:34,520
all the effort, all of the,
you know, ups and downs.

1639
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:40,760
It's like, there's more to it
than that time at the finish.

1640
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,359
I just hugged Lindsey
Kildow. She's 17 years old,

1641
01:19:45,399 --> 01:19:46,520
first time in the Olympics,

1642
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,079
getting the jitters out of her
system.

1643
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:51,319
And you know, my team is good.
It's big and it's strong.

1644
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:53,880
And I'm gonna really have a
fun time living vicariously

1645
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,239
through them and watching them.

1646
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:56,640
And, hopefully, I'll
be hugging them one day

1647
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:57,840
after they've won a gold medal.

1648
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,479
'Cause the feeling is
great when it happens.

1649
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,039
- It was such a great Olympics.
- It was perfect, yeah.

1650
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:08,920
- Yeah, it was such a great
games.

1651
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,039
Way to represent by the way.

1652
01:20:11,079 --> 01:20:13,039
Top finish of the U.S. at those
games.

1653
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:14,119
- I know, but everyone over...

1654
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,359
Everyone was like, "Our team did
so bad.

1655
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:18,560
We're going to pretend like
you didn't even do that."

1656
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,079
So I got literally-
- Just made you more hungry.

1657
01:20:20,119 --> 01:20:22,000
- 'Cause you retired, and
I was, like, on the team.

1658
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:23,199
- Ma, ma, mrr, mrr mrr. (Picabo
laughs)

1659
01:20:23,239 --> 01:20:26,359
- Yeah, and I was like, no one
even cares.

1660
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:28,319
- They missed our baton
handoff, didn't they?

1661
01:20:28,359 --> 01:20:31,479
- I know! They're late to the
game.

1662
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,000
- Picabo Street's retirement
was among the most prominent

1663
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:41,319
storylines to come out
of the Winter Olympics.

1664
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:43,920
- I feel so great. I
feel so relieved, Judy.

1665
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,359
It's really been incredible.

1666
01:20:45,399 --> 01:20:48,239
I mean, the Olympic experience
has been wonderful for me.

1667
01:20:48,279 --> 01:20:50,239
And I've gotten to feel it

1668
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:51,840
from all the different
perspectives

1669
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,359
that you can feel it from.

1670
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:58,600
I knew that I was gonna
need a couple of years

1671
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,079
to find myself and
figure out what I wanted

1672
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:02,079
to do with my life.

1673
01:21:02,119 --> 01:21:03,479
I knew I wanted to pay it
forward,

1674
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,279
but in what form?

1675
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:08,319
And then, what do I want for
me, personally, in my life?

1676
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:14,159
(electronic music)

1677
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:22,520
- You're so, like, you.

1678
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,239
And you always say what's on
your mind,

1679
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:27,079
and you have no filter, and
that's what I love about you.

1680
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:29,119
Do you ever feel like you were
judged

1681
01:21:29,159 --> 01:21:31,119
kind of for being a rebel?
- Oh, yeah. All the time.

1682
01:21:31,159 --> 01:21:32,560
All the time.

1683
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,880
I think you feel it always,
that people are judging you.

1684
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,079
When you're growing up in the
spotlight,

1685
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:39,000
I felt judged all along.

1686
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:42,239
It magnified a whole lot
more about five years ago.

1687
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:50,159
[Media Journalist]
Picabo called the cops

1688
01:21:50,199 --> 01:21:52,039
after her father, who's
diabetic,

1689
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:54,079
became belligerent and confused

1690
01:21:54,119 --> 01:21:57,119
after his blood sugar
dropped to a dangerous level.

1691
01:21:57,159 --> 01:22:01,119
- As dad was getting older,
I think as time went on,

1692
01:22:01,159 --> 01:22:03,000
it was getting rawer and rawer

1693
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:06,279
with this mismanagement of his
diabetes.

1694
01:22:06,319 --> 01:22:10,199
And so, Peek had become
a caretaker for them.

1695
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:11,760
So they were living with her

1696
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,399
and, you know, there's
a lot of frustration,

1697
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:19,600
especially with mom and
Peek, he would get physical.

1698
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,279
[Media Journalist] Picabo
says her father attacked her

1699
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:23,840
by grabbing her hair.

1700
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,600
- Two handfuls on either side of
my neck,

1701
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,000
and I was, I started...

1702
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:30,319
I put my hands on his chest
and he stumbled backwards.

1703
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:33,039
- She says they both fell down
the stairs.

1704
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:36,239
When she broke free, she called
911.

1705
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,920
- Were you afraid your
father was going to hurt you?

1706
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,279
- Oh, I was petrified.

1707
01:22:45,319 --> 01:22:46,760
- She called for help

1708
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,680
because her father was in the
middle of a medical crisis.

1709
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,079
And she ended up getting
arrested

1710
01:22:51,119 --> 01:22:53,640
when she did not deserve to at
all.

1711
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,920
And it crushed her brand, her
impact,

1712
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,520
and a lot of her spirit.

1713
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,920
[News Host] Former Olympian was
charged

1714
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,720
with one count of assault and
three counts

1715
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:06,439
of domestic violence, all
of which are misdemeanors.

1716
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:08,319
[Media Journalist] Both of
her parents signed affidavits

1717
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:09,640
supporting their daughter.

1718
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:13,239
Her father wrote, "The
entire episode was my fault.

1719
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:16,079
And Picabo was only defending
herself."

1720
01:23:16,119 --> 01:23:19,199
- I can look at it like I
should've never called for help,

1721
01:23:19,239 --> 01:23:21,159
but we always called for help.

1722
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:24,319
It was what we always did,
call for help for Dad.

1723
01:23:24,359 --> 01:23:25,520
[Media Journalist] Four weeks
ago,

1724
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:28,319
the prosecution finally
dropped all charges.

1725
01:23:28,359 --> 01:23:32,000
- It kicked her the
curbs so fast, you know,

1726
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:35,239
and all of our sponsorships
went away so fast

1727
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:37,600
that it devastated her.

1728
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:39,920
- They should not have arrested
Picabo.

1729
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,399
[Media Journalist]
Picabo's lawyer, Joe Rona,

1730
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:45,199
is adamant that prosecutors
and police rushed to judgment.

1731
01:23:45,239 --> 01:23:50,319
- They can destroy lives simply
by filing a criminal charge.

1732
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:52,920
- I invited her to a golf
tournament.

1733
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,840
I just thought she'd come in as
Picabo,

1734
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,560
you know, own the room.

1735
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:00,399
And I made eye contact
with her in the foyer,

1736
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:03,239
and she wasn't coming in
until I went and got her.

1737
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:04,960
And that just crushed me.

1738
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,720
- It started when I was a little
girl

1739
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,399
and got worse when he got
diabetes.

1740
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:17,000
And then we found out that
he had early onset dementia

1741
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:18,399
when we had our incident.

1742
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:21,680
He doesn't remember what day it
was,

1743
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,399
what time of day it was,
nothing.

1744
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:27,319
He had so much remorse in the
last couple of years of his life

1745
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:29,159
and I showed him so much grace.

1746
01:24:31,479 --> 01:24:33,520
The last time I saw him, he was
making potato salad

1747
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,520
with these little teeny potatoes
he loved

1748
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:40,279
and I said, "I gotta go get my
kids, Dad."

1749
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:42,119
And he turned and said, "All
right, boo. I love you."

1750
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:43,159
And I said, "I love you, too."

1751
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:44,279
And I walked out.

1752
01:24:45,159 --> 01:24:47,600
And that's the last time I saw
him.

1753
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:50,119
But I got the goodbye,

1754
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:52,239
and I think that's
God's way of being like,

1755
01:24:52,279 --> 01:24:53,720
"You were there always."

1756
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,199
You know?

1757
01:24:55,239 --> 01:24:58,159
Because this was such a
beautiful, insane,

1758
01:24:58,199 --> 01:25:02,720
intense relationship
that engulfed everything

1759
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,960
and was magical.

1760
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,199
Daxy, come on, honey!

1761
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,159
It's an honor to care for a
parent.

1762
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:13,199
And I care for my Mom every day.

1763
01:25:13,239 --> 01:25:14,520
It was an honor to care for my
Dad.

1764
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,199
It was hard and scary and I
failed a lot,

1765
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:23,399
but it makes such a
better person out of you.

1766
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:25,119
(Picabo chuckling)

1767
01:25:25,159 --> 01:25:26,840
[Picabo] It's fun to try to go,

1768
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,760
you get it, like right there.

1769
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:31,960
- You're good, dude.

1770
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,319
- Come on, get in here!

1771
01:25:34,359 --> 01:25:35,399
Ride with me!

1772
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:38,079
(gentle music)

1773
01:25:38,119 --> 01:25:40,880
- There's this analogy that
my girlfriend said to me,

1774
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:43,880
and it's, "When you become a
mom,

1775
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,239
you are instantly tethered with
this sled,

1776
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:49,960
and you're constantly pulling
the sled

1777
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,800
whether all of the kids are
riding in it,

1778
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,079
or none of them are riding in
it.

1779
01:25:53,119 --> 01:25:55,600
It doesn't matter, you're
still pulling it along."

1780
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:02,159
It's such a warming, welcoming,
like forever feeling.

1781
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:04,039
(soft music playing)

1782
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:06,119
It's like nothing else on the
planet.

1783
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,600
- Better than skiing?
- Oh my God, yeah.

1784
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:11,039
Don't worry, if you bump me,

1785
01:26:11,079 --> 01:26:12,880
I'll just bump Trey and
he can go off the edge.

1786
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:13,800
- Deal!

1787
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,199
(soft music playing)

1788
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:19,359
- What's the one thing that
you wish that people knew?

1789
01:26:20,199 --> 01:26:23,880
Like take down the hard
eggshell.

1790
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,239
Like what's the one thing that
is like,

1791
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:27,359
this is me that you don't know?

1792
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:29,439
- You know, I think a lot of
people see me

1793
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:33,079
as a lot harder and
tougher than I really am.

1794
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:38,920
I feel like there's two
operating systems that we have.

1795
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,119
We're either operating out of
love

1796
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:41,479
or we're operating out of fear.

1797
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,520
I don't think the hate
is the opposite of love.

1798
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,119
I think fear is.

1799
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:46,960
And it's like, I don't,

1800
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,600
I don't want to be
stifled by that anymore.

1801
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,319
[Picabo] You'd go noodling
where?

1802
01:26:57,359 --> 01:26:58,600
(man laughing)

1803
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,159
- Down in there?
- Yeah!

1804
01:27:00,199 --> 01:27:02,000
- You would not!
- Yeah you would!

1805
01:27:02,039 --> 01:27:03,720
- No you wouldn't!
- Yeah I would!

1806
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,279
- Are you serious?
- Easily!

1807
01:27:05,319 --> 01:27:07,560
- Come on! Would you? What would
you wear?

1808
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,159
There's a Cherokee proverb of
like,

1809
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:11,680
you have two wolves
that live inside of you

1810
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,760
and one of them is super
kind and pumps you up

1811
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,039
and makes you feel good.

1812
01:27:15,079 --> 01:27:16,760
And the other one's super
nasty and mean and evil.

1813
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,319
And when the little grandson
asks the Cherokee grandpa,

1814
01:27:20,359 --> 01:27:23,359
"What wolf wins the battle?"

1815
01:27:23,399 --> 01:27:26,079
He says "The one you feed."

1816
01:27:26,119 --> 01:27:29,359
(soft music playing)

1817
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,560
- The button? Which one?

1818
01:27:33,479 --> 01:27:34,920
Yeah! You got it!

1819
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,439
- And grab this.

1820
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:40,720
(soft music playing)

1821
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:43,439
- You look great!

1822
01:27:43,479 --> 01:27:44,119
- Thank you.

1823
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:47,199
(soft music playing)

1824
01:27:47,239 --> 01:27:49,720
- I deal with that same
battle that everybody does

1825
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,199
all day, every day.

1826
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:53,920
What's the story you're telling
yourself?

1827
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,319
It's a beautiful thing to be raw
and real

1828
01:27:56,359 --> 01:27:58,680
and human and going through it.

1829
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,239
Not...
- You taught me that.

1830
01:28:00,279 --> 01:28:01,319
- Not trying to hide from it

1831
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,319
and be something you're not,
right?

1832
01:28:03,359 --> 01:28:04,680
- Well, that's what you taught
me.

1833
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,439
Then that allowed me to do the
same thing.

1834
01:28:07,479 --> 01:28:08,479
- Good.

1835
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,359
Yay.

1836
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:13,039
- Nuh-uh!

1837
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:14,720
Linds!

1838
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,039
- Yeah. This is in my bedroom.

1839
01:28:17,079 --> 01:28:18,960
Not awkward at all, I'm 36 years
old.

1840
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,720
(Picabo laughing)

1841
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:21,720
- But

1842
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,840
- That's a cool poster!

1843
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,760
- Team Street.
- Team Street!

1844
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,000
- Yep.
- Linds...

1845
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:29,319
- "Follow your dreams! "I did.
- Yeah, you did.

1846
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:32,760
- So thank you.

1847
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,680
- Yeah.

1848
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:45,159
(instrumental music playing)

1849
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,520
- Follow in your footsteps in
that way.

1850
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:50,560
Like you, you know,

1851
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,479
inspired me and I try to inspire
others

1852
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,680
and I hope the next
generation does the same.

1853
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:56,520
- Pay it forward.

1854
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,000
- But you know,

1855
01:28:58,039 --> 01:29:00,199
I think what you're doing with
your academy is incredible.

1856
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:01,640
- That's funny. It's so cool.

1857
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,640
- What drove you to start that?

1858
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:06,119
- I was lucky to be one of
the early ones on the ski team

1859
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:08,000
when they had a strong
development program.

1860
01:29:08,039 --> 01:29:09,439
- Yeah.

1861
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:10,720
- And we were doing school
on the road and it was tough.

1862
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,399
I struggled and I want
other people to not run

1863
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:15,960
into that situation and
not feel unprepared.

1864
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:21,159
* Later I'd watch you and
wonder what it was like *

1865
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,119
* How do you bear the full
weight? *

1866
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:29,479
* How does the long way feel? *

1867
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:34,680
* Kneading your hand too
tight against the wheel? *

1868
01:29:36,479 --> 01:29:40,000
* How do you stay
in that tower? *

1869
01:29:40,039 --> 01:29:43,520
* How do you reckon your own
power? *

1870
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:48,720
* How does the wheel not
turn hour on hour on hour? *

1871
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,840
* I was trying to find my way *

1872
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,680
* I was thinking my mind was
made *

1873
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:01,840
* But you were making
my heart change shape *

1874
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:04,840
* It's all that I could take *

1875
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:07,760
* I was trying to find my way *
