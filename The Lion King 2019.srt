1
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,353
From the day we arrive On the planet

2
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,237
And blinking Step into the sun

3
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,470
There's more to see than can ever be seen

4
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,676
More to do than can ever be done

5
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,233
There's far too much to take in here

6
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,719
More to find than can ever be found

7
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,352
But the sun rolling high

8
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,396
Through the sapphire sky

9
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,237
Keeps great and small on the endless round

10
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,917
It's the circle of life

11
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,670
And it moves us all

12
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,517
Through despair and hope

13
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,678
Through faith and love

14
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,438
Till we find our place

15
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,598
On the path unwinding

16
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,395
In the circle

17
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,678
The circle of life

18
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,077
It's the circle of life

19
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,558
And it moves us all

20
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,679
Through despair and hope

21
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,200
Through faith and love

22
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,918
Till we find our place

23
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,157
On the path unwinding

24
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,672
In the circle

25
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,070
The circle of life

26
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,597
Life's not fair... is it, my little friend?

27
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,513
While some are born to feast...

28
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,399
others spend their lives in the dark,

29
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,153
begging for scraps.

30
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,112
The way I see it...

31
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,395
you and I are exactly the same.

32
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,391
We both want to find a way out.

33
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,040
The king approaches!

34
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,640
This is not a drill.

35
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,439
His Majesty has requested an audience.

36
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,071
Upon his entrance, you will rise and genuflect.

37
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,674
Zazu...

38
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,677
you've made me lose my lunch.

39
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,077
You will answer to Mufasa

40
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,576
for missing the ceremony this morning.

41
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,910
I answer to no one.

42
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,994
Scar? Scar. Scar.

43
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,197
No, no. Don't look at me like that.

44
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,750
Are you hungry, Zazu?

45
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,718
Perhaps we could have a bite together!

46
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
You can't eat me!

47
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,431
It is forbidden to eat a member of the king's court!

48
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,955
Ow! No, please! Stop it!

49
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,998
Scar!

50
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,195
Well, look who's come down to mingle with the commoners.

51
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,470
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.

52
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,753
Was that today?

53
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,831
Must've slipped my mind.

54
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,673
Of course I meant no disrespect

55
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,117
towards His Majesty or Sarabi.

56
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:42,436
As you know, I have tremendous respect for the queen.

57
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,629
As the king's brother,

58
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,439
you should've been first in line.

59
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,159
I was first in line.

60
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,519
Or don't you remember?

61
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,916
That is, until the precious prince arrived.

62
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,113
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

63
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,509
Oh, no, Mufasa,

64
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,990
perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.

65
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,630
Is that a challenge?

66
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,158
I wouldn't dream of challenging you again.

67
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,150
A wise decision.

68
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,551
You are no match for His Royalness.

69
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,958
Well, as far as brains go, I got the lion's share.

70
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,719
But when it comes to brute strength,

71
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,871
I'm afraid my big brother...

72
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,714
will always rule.

73
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,156
Not always, Scar.

74
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,592
One day, it'll be my son who rules.

75
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,877
Simba will be your king.

76
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,070
Then long live the king.

77
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,515
- What am I gonna do with him? - Oh, come on.

78
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,856
We both know he should've been

79
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,315
expelled from the Pride Lands long ago.

80
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,393
He's my brother, Zazu. This is his home.

81
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,190
As long as I am king, that will never change.

82
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,033
Well, there's one in every family, sire.

83
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,431
I had a cousin who thought he was a woodpecker.

84
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,439
He slammed his head into trees,

85
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,776
and our beaks aren't built for it.

86
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,634
He was concussed regularly. Oh, you've gone.

87
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,837
Uh, sire, coming back!

88
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,279
Simba.

89
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,077
Dad, you awake?

90
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,278
Dad, wake up!

91
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,440
Dad!

92
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,431
Dad, Dad, Dad!

93
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,320
Your son's awake.

94
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,631
Before sunrise, he's your son.

95
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,633
Come on, Dad, let's go.

96
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,393
You said I could patrol with you today.

97
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
And today has started.

98
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,440
You promised! You up?

99
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,469
Let's do this!

100
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,359
- Let's do this. - So, what's first?

101
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,638
Give orders for the hunt? Chase away evil intruders?

102
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,359
Dad! You're going the wrong way!

103
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,595
Dad?

104
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,316
I'm not supposed to go up here.

105
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,110
Look, Simba.

106
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,075
Everything the light touches is our kingdom.

107
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,790
You rule all of that?

108
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,434
Yes.

109
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,990
But a king's time as ruler...

110
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,073
rises and falls like the sun.

111
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,833
One day, Simba...

112
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,993
the sun will set on my time here...

113
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,755
and will rise with you as the new king.

114
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,791
All of this will belong to me?

115
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,552
It belongs to no one, but will be yours to protect.

116
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,677
A great responsibility.

117
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,152
Everything the light touches?

118
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,990
Those trees? And the watering hole?

119
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,873
And that mountain?

120
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,350
And beyond those shadows?

121
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,512
You must not go there, Simba.

122
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,876
But I thought a king could do whatever he wants.

123
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,309
Take any territory.

124
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,438
While others search for what they can take...

125
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,434
a true king searches for what he can give.

126
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,280
Everything you see exists together

127
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,238
in a delicate balance.

128
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,718
As king, you need to understand that balance...

129
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,997
and respect all the creatures...

130
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,834
from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.

131
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,239
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

132
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,950
Yes, Simba. But let me explain.

133
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,359
When we die, our bodies become the grass...

134
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,433
and the antelope eat the grass...

135
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,038
and so we are all connected in the great circle of life.

136
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,757
- Sire! - Morning, Zazu.

137
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,400
Do you have the morning report?

138
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,119
Yes, sire.

139
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,271
Ten flamingos are taking a stand.

140
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,874
Two giraffe were caught necking.

141
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,156
The buzz from the bees...

142
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,336
is that the leopards are in a bit of a spot.

143
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Ready for some fun?

144
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,280
The birds are tweeting at 4:00 in the morning.

145
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,913
I'm like, "Birds, we get it."

146
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,594
Stay low to the ground.

147
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
I got this.

148
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,679
Check the wind, the shadows...

149
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,676
and wait for the perfect moment to pounce.

150
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,976
The cheetahs stole the baboons' dinner,

151
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,216
and now the baboons are going ape.

152
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,311
Of course, as I say, cheetahs never prosper.

153
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,516
That's what I say.

154
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,736
Do you get... I'll say it again.

155
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,353
Cheetahs never...

156
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,792
Come on! It's the news!

157
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,599
That's very good!

158
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,640
Sire!

159
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,432
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands.

160
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,596
They're on the hunt!

161
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,559
- Where's Sarabi? - She's leading the charge.

162
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,040
Zazu, take Simba home.

163
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,873
Dad, let me come! I can help.

164
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,557
No, son. You stay with the other cubs.

165
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,029
I am not a cub.

166
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,800
Come on.

167
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,674
Let's go home.

168
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,709
Here we are.

169
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,391
Now you go along and play with the other cubs.

170
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,318
Great.

171
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,279
If you wish to kill something...

172
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,437
you might want to stay downwind.

173
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,632
I know how to hunt, Uncle Scar.

174
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,872
Well, let's hope we're never attacked by a beetle.

175
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,670
Go back to your den, Simba. I don't babysit.

176
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,714
Babysit? I'm gonna be the king of Pride Rock.

177
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,953
My dad showed me the whole kingdom.

178
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,157
Said I'm going to rule it all.

179
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,913
Is that so?

180
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,116
Think about it.

181
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,239
When I'm king, I'll have to give you orders.

182
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,153
Tell you what to do.

183
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,152
How weird is that?

184
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,357
You've no idea.

185
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,152
So, your dad showed you the whole kingdom?

186
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,072
Did he show you the shadows beyond the northern borders?

187
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,359
No. He said I can't go there. Ever.

188
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,309
And he's absolutely right.

189
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,471
An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince.

190
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,350
An elephant graveyard? Whoa.

191
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,555
Oh, dear. I've said too much.

192
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,776
Though I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later...

193
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,520
you being king and all.

194
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,040
You've been there?

195
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,511
We've all been there. And it's no place for a cub.

196
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,030
All those rotting bones...

197
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,272
and burning pools of oozing mud.

198
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,631
Rotting bones? Oozing mud?

199
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,077
Promise me you'll stay away, Simba.

200
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,833
Now, you run along.

201
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,352
And remember...

202
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,715
it's our little secret...

203
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,999
Your Majesty.

204
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,552
Nala! Come on. We have to go.

205
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,433
- Where? - Watering hole.

206
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,637
Simba, she's having her bath.

207
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,632
And it's time for yours.

208
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,950
But, Mom...

209
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,960
I can do it myself.

210
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,349
Hold still.

211
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,199
You're messing up my mane!

212
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,238
Come on. Behind the ears.

213
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,159
Come on, Mom!

214
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,559
See? All clean. Can we go?

215
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,236
There's no hyenas. You just chased them all off.

216
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,313
Just to the watering hole and no further.

217
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,518
And stay downwind.

218
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,558
And one more little thing.

219
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,518
Zazu will be going with you.

220
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,716
Zazu?

221
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,479
Zazu goes... or you don't.

222
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,759
Come along. Keep up. Let's move in a unit.

223
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,400
Okay, buddy system.

224
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,239
So, where are we really going?

225
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
How did you know?

226
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
You hate the water.

227
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,911
I heard about this place, Nala.

228
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,559
The most incredible, amazing...

229
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,439
Just tell me where.

230
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,399
An elephant graveyard.

231
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,672
Whoa. How far is it?

232
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,672
Not far. Just to the shadows.

233
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,718
But don't worry, everyone's been there.

234
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,234
We've never been that far before.

235
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,278
- What if we get lost? - Relax, Nala.

236
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,911
I patrolled the entire kingdom this morning with my dad.

237
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,514
There's nothing to worry about.

238
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,558
Well, there is one thing.

239
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,200
We have an imminent threat. Something is approaching.

240
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,272
Oh, wait, scratch that. That's my own shadow.

241
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,313
How we getting rid of the dodo?

242
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,119
Trust me, I got this.

243
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,634
Follow me to freedom.

244
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,918
Oh, how lovely it is...

245
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,278
to see the future king with his future queen.

246
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,199
I could just molt.

247
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,993
What do you mean, "future queen"?

248
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,994
Well, one day the two of you will be betrothed.

249
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,959
Intended. Affianced.

250
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,195
Simba, you speak bird?

251
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,430
Married!

252
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,876
Come on. One day you will be married.

253
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,800
To each other.

254
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,270
- Ugh! - Ew!

255
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,240
Mmm-mmm. That's not gonna happen, Zazu.

256
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Never ever.

257
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,595
Nala and I are friends.

258
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,917
And besides, she's afraid of rhinos!

259
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,176
And he's never eaten an impala.

260
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,236
I've tried it once.

261
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,754
We are never getting married, Zazu.

262
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,673
A monarch who ignores tradition?

263
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,593
With an attitude like that,

264
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,956
I'm afraid you'll be a pretty pathetic king.

265
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,510
Well, I'm not letting anyone tell me where to go,

266
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,955
what to do... and even who to marry.

267
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,952
There will never be a king like me.

268
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,318
Simba, you can't escape your destiny.

269
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,994
Just watch.

270
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,193
I'm gonna be a mighty king

271
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,238
So enemies beware

272
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,354
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts

273
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,397
With quite so little hair

274
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,318
I'm gonna be the main event Like no king was before

275
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,320
I'm brushing up on looking down

276
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,119
Working on my roar

277
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,637
Thus far a rather uninspiring thing

278
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,556
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

279
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,837
You have rather a long way to go, young master.

280
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,480
If you think... No one saying "do this"

281
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,869
Now, when I said that...

282
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,280
No one saying "be there"

283
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
What I meant was...

284
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,472
No one saying "stop that"

285
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,154
No one saying "see here"

286
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,510
Now see here!

287
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,673
Free to run around all day

288
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,240
Well, that's definitely out.

289
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,837
Free to do it all my way

290
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,995
I think it's time that you and I

291
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,878
Arranged a heart-to-heart

292
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,232
Kings don't need advice

293
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,880
From little hornbills for a start

294
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,713
If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out

295
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,310
Out of service Out of Africa

296
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,671
I wouldn't hang about

297
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,477
This child is getting wildly out of wing

298
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Simba!

299
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,754
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

300
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,829
Simba!

301
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,720
I can't see you, Simba.

302
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,639
You must be in my sight at all times.

303
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,029
I've lost him!

304
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,990
I know what you're doing!

305
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,833
Where are you going, Simba?

306
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,434
Come on!

307
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,637
You can't hide from me, Simba.

308
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,440
It is my sworn duty to keep you safe.

309
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,075
You listen to me right now.

310
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,136
I'm sorry to flutter about in your face,

311
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,516
have you seen... He's a little lion.

312
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,639
He's small, but he's cute.

313
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,911
Everybody look left Everybody look right

314
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,398
Everywhere you look I'm

315
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,480
Standing in the spotlight Not yet.

316
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,076
Let every creature go for broke and sing

317
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,279
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing

318
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,360
I see you down there! I see you down there!

319
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,911
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

320
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,076
Oh, I just can't wait to be king Simba!

321
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,234
He just can't wait to be king

322
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:11,075
Oh, I just can't wait Just can't wait

323
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,752
To be king

324
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,630
I've lost him!

325
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,712
Mufasa's gonna have my feathers.

326
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,553
This is not good!

327
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,439
Simba, we really lost him.

328
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,954
I know what you're thinking.

329
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,395
"The future king is a genius."

330
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,835
You can't be serious.

331
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,310
You would've never gotten away without your queen.

332
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,834
Aren't you forgetting something?

333
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,639
There is no queen.

334
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
You could say that again.

335
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,314
I'd rather marry an aardvark.

336
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,193
Good luck finding one that will say yes.

337
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,056
Good luck getting out of here without a bruising.

338
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,912
Give it your best shot.

339
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Pinned ya!

340
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,353
You owe me an apology.

341
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,795
Never!

342
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,839
Pinned ya. Again.

343
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,235
Nala, stop!

344
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
What is that?

345
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,079
You're not gonna trick me, Simba.

346
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,436
I know that there's nothing...

347
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,673
This must be it.

348
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,109
Come on!

349
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,037
Simba, we're way beyond the Pride Lands.

350
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,510
We found it, Nala. You know what this means?

351
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,080
It means we can go home.

352
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,392
It means they won't treat us like cubs anymore.

353
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,830
Simba, get down! It could be dangerous.

354
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,320
Danger?

355
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,677
I laugh in the face of danger.

356
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,910
Cool!

357
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,469
You hear that, Nala?

358
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,599
Simba, come on!

359
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,399
You've proved how brave you are.

360
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,676
Now the sun is going down,

361
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,717
I'm not just gonna sit here and...

362
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,871
Well, look at this.

363
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,031
We weren't expecting guests today.

364
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,556
Would you two cubs...

365
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,680
like to stay for dinner?

366
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,718
Yeah, stay for dinner.

367
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,156
'Cause you look like a midnight snack!

368
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,016
Can you just give me a little bit of space?

369
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,076
I'm helping.

370
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,714
We have talked about this before.

371
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,996
I come in alone.

372
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,431
I'm the lead distraction so everyone can circle.

373
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,796
Okay, okay. Sorry.

374
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,593
Don't be sorry. Just do it.

375
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,992
Now, this is a meal I've waited my whole life for.

376
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,756
What an unexpected treat, to eat the son of a king.

377
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,480
Wait a second, the king? As in you-know-who?

378
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,000
Who rules you-know-where?

379
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,675
Mufasa does not rule me!

380
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,710
You can't do anything to me!

381
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,712
'Cause I'm the future king!

382
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,359
He's telling me what to do.

383
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,035
His father's strength flickering inside.

384
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,440
I wonder...

385
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,157
how all that bravery will taste.

386
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,236
Let them go, Shenzi!

387
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,835
They made a mistake, a horrible mistake!

388
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,954
But if you do this, you will start a war with Mufasa!

389
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,793
Hyenas and lions have been at war

390
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,599
since the beginning of time.

391
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,032
But Mufasa's bloodline will end here!

392
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,520
Run!

393
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,552
Don't let them get away!

394
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Come on!

395
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,274
Did you hear that?

396
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,920
The future king!

397
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,554
Oh, don't hurt me!

398
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,313
Do it again!

399
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,040
If you ever come near my son again...

400
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,193
No, Mufasa. Never.

401
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,030
Never again.

402
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,869
You've been warned, Shenzi.

403
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,475
I thought you were very brave.

404
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,110
Zazu?

405
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,317
Take Nala back to Pride Rock.

406
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,313
Yes, sire.

407
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,472
Don't be too hard on him, sire.

408
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,951
I remember a cub, a certain headstrong cub...

409
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,998
who was always getting into scrapes.

410
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,800
And he achieved some prominence,

411
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,916
did he not, sire?

412
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,995
I have to teach my son a lesson.

413
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,512
Nala, come along.

414
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,552
Simba?

415
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,312
You deliberately disobeyed me.

416
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,596
I know.

417
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,519
You could have been killed.

418
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,430
And what's worse, you put Nala in danger.

419
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,030
Do you understand what's at stake?

420
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,630
You jeopardized the future of our pride.

421
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,872
I just wanted to show you I could do it.

422
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,997
That I could be brave like you.

423
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,356
I'm only brave when I have to be,

424
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,352
when there's no other choice.

425
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,876
But you're not scared of anything.

426
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,880
I was today.

427
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,080
You were?

428
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,234
Yes. I thought I might lose you.

429
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,032
I guess even kings get scared, huh?

430
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,631
More than you could ever know.

431
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,638
- But guess what? - What?

432
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,470
I think those hyenas were even scareder.

433
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,559
That's 'cause nobody messes with your dad.

434
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,870
Come here.

435
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,876
- Dad? - Uh-huh?

436
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,680
- We're pals, right? - Right.

437
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,794
And we'll always be together... right?

438
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,631
Simba, let me tell you something my father told me.

439
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,712
Look at the stars.

440
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,310
The great kings of the past...

441
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,473
look down on us from those stars.

442
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,911
- Really? - Yes.

443
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,390
So whenever you feel alone...

444
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,354
just remember that those kings...

445
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,280
will always be up there to guide you.

446
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,032
And so will I.

447
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,312
But I can't see them, Dad.

448
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,637
Keep looking, son.

449
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,519
Keep looking.

450
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,638
Mufasa is strong.

451
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,712
Like, way stronger than us.

452
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,439
- Please give me some space. - What?

453
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,319
You could lay anywhere in this cave.

454
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,736
- Where do you want me to... - I need some personal space.

455
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,513
- Okay? - Okay.

456
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
Not to take anything away from you. You were great.

457
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,760
But he is...

458
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,656
See, now I know you're doing this on purpose.

459
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,149
Very brave, too. Tough, good energy.

460
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,336
Now you're just being spiteful.

461
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
Good posture.

462
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,635
Next time I see Mufasa...

463
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,400
I'm gonna teach him a lesson he will never forget.

464
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,711
Well, you're in luck! He's right behind ya.

465
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,314
Mufasa?

466
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,277
That's not the king.

467
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,551
You fools have stripped your land of every living thing.

468
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,713
And yet I send two little cubs your way...

469
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,394
and they come back alive.

470
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,315
I guess we'll have to eat you instead.

471
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,038
Why eat one meal...

472
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,352
when you can be feasting the rest of your lives?

473
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,873
What could you possibly offer us?

474
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,680
A place where you can fill your bellies.

475
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,672
Where everything the light touches

476
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,831
is yours for the kill.

477
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,071
The Pride Lands are not yours to give.

478
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,630
The king controls those hunting grounds.

479
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,469
That's why we're going to kill him.

480
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,360
Mufasa has always shown too much restraint...

481
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,637
when it comes to hunting.

482
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,357
When I am king...

483
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,671
the mighty will be free to take whatever they want.

484
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,512
Because a hyena's belly is never full.

485
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,675
Mufasa's far too powerful to challenge.

486
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,833
Mufasa is yesterday's message

487
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,911
A clapped-out, distracted regime

488
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,794
Whose failings undoubtedly presage

489
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,879
The need for a dif'rent dream

490
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,998
Yes, leonine times are a-changing

491
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,232
Which means that hyenas must too

492
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,200
My vision is clear and wide-ranging

493
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,200
And even encompasses you

494
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,991
So prepare for the coup of the century

495
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,032
Prepare for the murkiest scam

496
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,912
Meticulous planning Tenacity spanning

497
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,596
Decades of denial Is simply why I'll

498
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,032
Be king Undisputed Respected Saluted

499
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,238
And seen for the wonder I am

500
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,720
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared

501
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,758
Be prepared

502
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,396
- Be prepared - Be prepared

503
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,199
Be prepared Be prepared

504
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,397
- Be prepared - Be prepared

505
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:41,149
Be prepared Be prepared Be prepared

506
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,437
Be prepared

507
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,520
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared

508
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,071
Be prepared

509
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,911
My dad was pretty upset with me.

510
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,151
That's why we're here, Simba.

511
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,199
I think I know a way for you to make it up to him.

512
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,751
A gift that will make him forget it ever happened.

513
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,799
But he's the king. What could I give him?

514
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,519
Your roar.

515
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,680
My roar?

516
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,194
Yes!

517
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,799
Did you hear that?

518
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,791
This gorge is where all lions come to find their roar.

519
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
All lions?

520
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,755
Even my dad?

521
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,113
Even Mufasa came here when he was your age.

522
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,680
Refused to leave...

523
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,720
until his roar could be heard above the rim.

524
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,960
All the way up there?

525
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,998
That's when you know you've found it.

526
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,913
With a little practice...

527
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,914
you'll never be called a cub again.

528
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,239
Watch this.

529
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,357
You'll get it, Simba.

530
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,716
Just takes time.

531
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,553
I'll check on you later.

532
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,080
Dad will be so proud, won't he?

533
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,880
It's a gift he'll never forget.

534
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,793
Mufasa! Quick!

535
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,633
Stampede in the gorge!

536
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,990
Simba's down there!

537
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,389
Simba?

538
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,594
I'll find him.

539
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,760
Zazu!

540
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,595
Hold on! Help is coming!

541
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,076
There he is! On that tree!

542
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,956
I'm coming, Simba! Hold on!

543
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,035
I'll help them, Zazu! You get the pride!

544
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,429
Go!

545
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,236
Dad!

546
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,236
Simba!

547
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,719
Come to me, son.

548
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,355
Jump!

549
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,996
Dad!

550
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,589
Scar!

551
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,760
Help me.

552
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,071
Long live the king!

553
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,036
No!

554
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,750
Dad?

555
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,720
Dad?

556
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,280
Dad?

557
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,834
Dad?

558
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,551
Come on, wake up.

559
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,158
Help! Somebody help!

560
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,033
Simba!

561
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,711
What have you done?

562
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,478
It was a stampede.

563
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,040
He tried to save me.

564
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,396
It was an accident.

565
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,474
- I didn't mean for it to... - Of course you didn't.

566
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,077
No one ever means for these things to happen.

567
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,959
But the king is dead...

568
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,759
and if it weren't for you...

569
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,636
he'd still be alive.

570
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,554
Your father had such hopes for you...

571
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,872
gave you so many chances.

572
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,997
And this is how you repay him.

573
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,280
I didn't know. I didn't know.

574
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,318
Oh, what will your mother think?

575
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,837
A son who causes his father's death.

576
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,597
A boy who kills a king.

577
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,591
What am I gonna do?

578
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,949
Run.

579
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,314
Run away, Simba.

580
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,191
Run away and never return!

581
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,551
Kill him.

582
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,273
Go down and make sure he's dead.

583
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,434
Seriously?

584
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,273
Oh, I'm sorry.

585
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,160
That's a good distance right there.

586
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,236
Okay.

587
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,960
No little cub could survive that fall.

588
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,074
Listen, we're gonna tell her...

589
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,199
we went down there and we ate him.

590
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,112
Uh-huh. That's perfect, 'cause I am starving!

591
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,839
We're not gonna eat him.

592
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,150
Simba is dead.

593
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,755
That's all she ever has to know.

594
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,000
Works for me.

595
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:57,310
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.

596
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,479
The greatest leader the pride has ever known.

597
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,152
To lose a brother...

598
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,271
such a deep, personal loss.

599
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,995
And little Simba, who had barely begun to live.

600
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,710
A cub whose blood held our future.

601
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,032
It's almost too much to endure.

602
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,198
I only wish I had gotten to the gorge in time...

603
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,398
been there to save them.

604
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,032
And so it is with a heavy heart...

605
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,831
that I must assume the throne.

606
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,120
Mufasa and Simba are gone...

607
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,194
which means I am your king.

608
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,120
But I must admit...

609
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,034
I cannot bear this burden alone.

610
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,872
And I will need some help... to ensure

611
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,997
the safety of the pride.

612
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,518
Nala, stay close.

613
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,840
And so, from the ashes of this tragedy...

614
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,199
we shall welcome the dawning of a new era.

615
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,960
A great...

616
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,038
and glorious future!

617
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,352
Oh, dear.

618
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,915
I missed 'em!

619
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,800
I'm gonna get one of those vultures one day.

620
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,960
I'm gonna get one!

621
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,680
I don't know why it's so important to you.

622
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,031
I just feel like it would make me feel better.

623
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,191
Oh, no. It's a little lion!

624
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,360
- That is not a lion. - Well then, go check it out.

625
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,496
- What is it? - That is not a lion,

626
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,556
it's a furry bird!

627
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,869
It looks like a lion!

628
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,760
That's not a lion. Let me get a closer look. Excuse me.

629
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,435
All right, let me see what we're dealing with here.

630
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,600
It's a lion!

631
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,256
- Run for your life, Pumbaa! - Wait! Hey, Timon.

632
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,000
- Wait, Timon, wait! - It's a little lion!

633
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,355
It gets bigger.

634
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,358
Can we keep him? Can we please keep him?

635
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,440
Oh, oh, okay. I promise I'll walk him every day!

636
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,016
If he makes a little mess, I'll clean it up.

637
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,110
You'll be his little mess!

638
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,440
He's gonna eat you and then use my body as a toothpick!

639
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,477
But one day, when he's big and strong,

640
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,789
he'll be on our side!

641
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,316
I've got it. What if he's on our side?

642
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,675
Hear me out!

643
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,834
Having a ferocious lion around might not be such a bad idea!

644
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,315
Well then, can we keep him?

645
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,709
Yes, of course we can keep him!

646
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,440
My God, who is the brains of this operation?

647
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,398
We're gonna name him Fred!

648
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,313
Who are you?

649
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,576
Uh, we're the guys who saved your life.

650
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,600
Yes.

651
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,916
Risked everything. Fought off angry vultures!

652
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,719
Hordes of them. Flocks.

653
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,200
I'm Pumbaa.

654
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,635
- This is Timon. - Did I mention

655
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,949
that we saved your life?

656
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,157
It doesn't matter.

657
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,191
Whoa. How bleak is that?

658
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,416
It doesn't even matter?

659
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,591
Like I don't have enough that I'm dealing with, right?

660
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,160
Now his problems are my problems?

661
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,440
But we can help him. We're in a position to help him.

662
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,515
So, how are you, in as few words as possible?

663
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,872
I did something terrible.

664
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,878
I don't wanna talk about it.

665
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,675
Look, kid, we've all made mistakes.

666
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,480
Uh, there must be something we can do, right?

667
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,632
Not unless you can change the past.

668
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,216
Well, you know, that's a lot to ask...

669
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,336
That's pretty hard. That's a biggie.

670
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,416
...if I'm being honest.

671
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,136
I mean, change the past? It already happened.

672
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,833
Yeah, so you can't change that.

673
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,280
But you know what you can change?

674
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,317
The future. That's our specialty.

675
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,834
Kind of our thing.

676
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,435
How can you change something that hasn't happened?

677
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,671
Well, to change the future,

678
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,194
you gotta put your past behind you.

679
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,400
Way behind.

680
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,756
Look, kid, bad things happen

681
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,991
and you can't do anything about it, right?

682
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,080
Right.

683
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,800
Wrong! When the world turns its back on you...

684
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,758
you turn your back on the world!

685
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,158
And only embrace what's next!

686
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,198
And turn the "what" into "so what?"

687
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,477
Well, that's not what I was taught.

688
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,518
Well, then maybe you need a new lesson.

689
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,152
Repeat after me, kid. Hakuna matata.

690
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,672
- What? - Hakuna matata.

691
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,194
Hakuna matata.

692
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,456
Most people get a bigger reaction

693
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,596
when we say it the first...

694
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,160
Okay, well anyway. Hakuna matata.

695
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,776
Some people start clapping immediately.

696
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,031
It means "no worries." One and a...

697
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,237
I do the counting here.

698
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,280
- I wanna count! - Why don't we count together?

699
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,896
- Okay, that's a good idea. - All right.

700
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,320
One and a two and a...

701
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,479
Hakuna matata

702
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,790
What a wonderful phrase

703
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,352
Hakuna matata

704
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,357
It ain't no passing craze

705
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:21,471
It means no worries For the rest of your days

706
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,676
It's our problem-free

707
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,637
Philosophy

708
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,993
Hakuna matata

709
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,874
- Hakuna matata? - Yeah, it's our motto.

710
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,554
What's a motto?

711
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,096
Nothin'. What's-a-motto with you?

712
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,236
- Nice. - Boom!

713
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,830
Those two words will solve all your problems.

714
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,435
Yeah. Take Pumbaa here.

715
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,350
Why, when he was a young warthog

716
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,718
When I was a young warthog

717
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,551
- How are you feeling? - It's an emotional story.

718
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,360
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal

719
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,399
He could clear the savannah after every meal

720
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,597
I'm a sensitive soul

721
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,196
Although I seem thick-skinned

722
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,150
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind

723
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,596
I was always here for you and I resent that.

724
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,229
- And, oh, the shame - Yes, he was ashamed

725
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,959
I thought of changing my name

726
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,634
I mean, to what, "Brad"?

727
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,520
And I got downhearted

728
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,435
Ev'ry time that I farted

729
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,875
Are you gonna stop me?

730
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,919
No, I'm not! You disgust me!

731
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,753
Hakuna matata

732
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,155
What a wonderful phrase

733
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,479
Hakuna matata

734
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,396
Ain't no passing craze

735
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,792
It means no worries For the rest of your days

736
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,189
Yeah, sing it, kid

737
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,830
It's our problem-free Philosophy

738
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,878
Hakuna matata

739
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,752
Welcome to our humble home.

740
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,149
You live here?

741
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,776
Well, we live wherever we want.

742
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,075
We do as we please.

743
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,310
It's beautiful.

744
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,472
Yeah, it's really nice, huh?

745
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,914
Everyone, this is Simba.

746
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,998
That, my friend, is a lion.

747
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,316
What about food?

748
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,656
Have you thought about feeding that thing?

749
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,195
Yeah, I'm starved! I could eat a whole zebra.

750
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,350
Here we go.

751
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,314
Uh, no, no, no, kid, we're fresh out of zebra.

752
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,630
Any antelope?

753
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,553
- Uh-oh. - No, listen, kid...

754
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,837
if you want to live with us, you have to eat like us.

755
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,879
And most importantly, not eat us!

756
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,432
This looks like a good spot to rustle up some grub!

757
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,480
- Yeah! - It's perfect!

758
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,880
Step aside, fellas!

759
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,314
Ugh. What's that?

760
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,640
Ooh. Too chewy.

761
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,120
This one's got some nuttiness!

762
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,760
Mmm. Now that's what I call umami!

763
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,309
Slimy, yet satisfying.

764
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,440
Mmm. Extra crunchy.

765
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,000
- They're local. - Yeah. Oh, are they?

766
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,236
They're from right there.

767
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,631
I'm telling ya, kid, this is the great life.

768
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,800
No rules.

769
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,838
No responsibilities.

770
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,560
Ooh! The little cream-filled kind.

771
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,790
I love these!

772
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,016
- Those are good. - I love these.

773
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,040
Those are the best.

774
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,176
Can I have the head?

775
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,200
Well, kid?

776
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,794
Oh, well.

777
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,599
Hakuna matata.

778
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,399
Slimy...

779
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,960
yet satisfying.

780
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,713
- That's it! - We didn't lie!

781
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,520
Egg sac! I got an egg sac!

782
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:39,154
Hakuna matata Hakuna matata Hakuna matata

783
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,710
It means no worries For the rest of your days

784
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:51,356
It's our problem-free Philosophy

785
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,479
- Hakuna matata, oh - Hakuna matata, hakuna matata

786
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,109
- Hakuna matata, yeah - Hakuna matata, hakuna matata

787
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,478
- Hakuna matata - Hakuna matata, hakuna matata

788
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,837
Hakuna matata Hakuna matata

789
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,037
- It means no worries - Hakuna matata

790
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,715
- For the rest of your days - Hakuna matata, hakuna matata

791
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:13,991
Hakuna It's our problem-free Philosophy

792
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,800
Hakuna matata One more time.

793
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,056
Oh, no, I think we did it. Yeah.

794
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,176
I think we got this one.

795
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,296
But we're just getting in the groove, guys.

796
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,456
No, let's leave 'em wanting more.

797
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,176
Yeah, you've grown 400 pounds since we started.

798
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,839
Meanwhile I look exactly the same.

799
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,216
It means no worries

800
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,336
Will you tell him to stop?

801
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,456
But you insisted we sing the song.

802
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,616
I insisted? You started singing it!

803
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,696
Well, it's our signature song...

804
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,856
we shouldn't be sharing it with everyone.

805
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,936
Look at that sunset.

806
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,096
But it's our signature song, so we have to.

807
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,157
Look, just tell him to stop.

808
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,834
It means no worries

809
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,096
Oh, now he's riffing, Pumbaa.

810
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,156
This is a nightmare.

811
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,200
It actually is becoming better and better.

812
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,954
Nala.

813
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,720
Come.

814
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,440
Sit with us.

815
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,070
Zazu, where have you been?

816
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,917
I'm sorry, Nala. I came as soon as I could.

817
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,073
The morning report, Zazu.

818
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,473
Your Majesty, the Pride Lands are in imminent danger.

819
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,599
The hyenas are chasing off the last of the herds.

820
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:51,830
The bird's back!

821
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,914
Get him!

822
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,958
Don't come here again, unless you want to be eaten!

823
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,313
We have to do something, Sarabi. We have to fight!

824
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,070
Nala. Scar is the king.

825
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,873
But you are our queen!

826
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,151
We should leave before it's too late!

827
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:40,439
We must all stay together and protect the Pride Lands.

828
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:44,150
This is our home. We must never abandon it.

829
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,312
This isn't the home I remember.

830
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,200
Our time will come, Nala.

831
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,589
Be patient.

832
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,160
Sarabi.

833
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,678
The king wishes to see you.

834
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,113
Don't go.

835
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,750
I'm not afraid of him.

836
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,276
Won't you join me, Sarabi?

837
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,318
There's plenty to go around.

838
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,353
You're overhunting, Scar.

839
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,557
I've simply perfected the kill.

840
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,994
With the help of my army.

841
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,311
You're killing everything.

842
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,958
Don't you see? There is nobody to challenge me.

843
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,510
We can finally take whatever we want.

844
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,554
We?

845
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,350
Long ago you chose Mufasa over me.

846
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,477
But now there is a new king.

847
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,117
So stop being so selfish.

848
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,313
You are the selfish one.

849
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,437
The other lions look to you.

850
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,513
As long as you resist they will reject me.

851
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,917
Take your place by my side, and we will feast together.

852
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,399
I will never be your queen!

853
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,833
Then from now on...

854
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,119
the lions will eat after the hyenas.

855
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,955
And they don't leave much behind.

856
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,976
Just what do you think

857
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,957
you are doing, young lady?

858
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,520
Go away, Zazu.

859
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,399
I'm going to find help.

860
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,313
I will very much not go away.

861
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,917
I am sworn to protect you and must order you back to bed.

862
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,760
I don't need protecting anymore.

863
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,834
Uh, Scar! Uh, wonderful to see you.

864
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,992
Uh, sorry to drop in like this!

865
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,116
Ah!

866
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,434
Have I ever told you about my brother

867
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,637
who thought he was a woodpecker?

868
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,873
Nala...

869
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,360
Oh, I'm gonna get ya!

870
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,159
I'm gonna get ya! Oh, I got ya!

871
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,754
Oh.

872
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,798
Simba! It's you!

873
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,234
Did you see that?

874
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,720
Man, that butterfly was right there!

875
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,996
I almost had him.

876
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,635
I thought it was a lion.

877
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,440
You know, the other kind of lion.

878
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,840
You know, a real lion?

879
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,593
I mean, not that you're not a real lion.

880
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,512
But you know, the kind that eats...

881
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,875
I'm gonna go.

882
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,439
Hey, where you going?

883
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,796
You wanna get some grubs?

884
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,353
What's up with that guy?

885
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,440
Um, Simba...

886
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,913
How can I say this?

887
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,833
- He's prey. - Yeah.

888
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,074
And he is never gonna want to frolic with a carnivore.

889
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,197
No. You two will never frolic.

890
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,033
Why not?

891
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:28,433
You see, in nature there's a delicate balance.

892
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,478
Oh, yeah. The circle of life. I know that.

893
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,233
- No. - No, no, no.

894
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,456
I don't know where you're getting "circle" from.

895
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,480
No, yeah.

896
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,600
There's no circle of life.

897
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,776
- No, it's no circle. - No, not at all.

898
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,951
- In fact, it's the opposite. - Yeah.

899
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,280
- It's a line. - Yeah.

900
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,909
It's a meaningless line of indifference.

901
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,510
And we're all just running towards the end of the line.

902
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,957
And then one day we'll reach the end, and that'll be it.

903
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,336
- That's it. - Line over!

904
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,113
- Nothing. - Nada.

905
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,520
And you can really just kinda...

906
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,319
do your own thing and fend for yourself...

907
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,416
'cause your line doesn't affect anyone else's lines.

908
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,636
You're alive and then you're not. Like this guy.

909
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,956
Mmm.

910
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,879
You sure it's not a circle?

911
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,039
That we're all connected?

912
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,431
A circle would mean we're all this.

913
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,916
That would mean what I do affects him...

914
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,600
affects that thing, affects that thing.

915
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,240
Yeah. No. That's not how it goes.

916
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,919
Which would make doing whatever we wanted

917
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,195
not that cool.

918
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,834
Let me simplify this for you.

919
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,719
- Life is meaningless. - Yes.

920
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,760
That's why you just gotta look out for yourself.

921
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,280
That's why you do you, Simba.

922
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,636
Yeah, Simba, for the first time...

923
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,110
we're entrusting you to make a plan for us today.

924
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,875
This is important. Think about all you've been taught.

925
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,037
What do you wanna do?

926
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,879
Absolutely nothing.

927
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,039
Whoo-hoo! - Exactly! He gets it!

928
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,873
Jackpot!

929
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,096
Out of my way! Out of my way!

930
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,760
- Crunchy! - All right! Time to eat!

931
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,397
Oh.

932
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,551
Hello!

933
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,552
Nice one, Simba.

934
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,360
Oh, thanks. Must've been the termites.

935
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,352
Or the crickets.

936
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,480
And you wonder why I prefer to sleep underground.

937
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,958
Hey, Timon.

938
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,349
Do you ever look up there

939
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,750
and wonder what those sparkly dots are?

940
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,636
Oh, Pumbaa. I don't wonder. I know.

941
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,832
Really? What are they?

942
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,719
They're fireflies.

943
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,874
Fireflies that got stuck on that big, bluish-black thing.

944
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,960
Oh.

945
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,389
I guess that makes sense.

946
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,557
I always thought they were balls of gas

947
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,711
burning billions of miles away.

948
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,190
Oh, Pumbaa, why is everything always gas with you?

949
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,800
I know.

950
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,793
- What do you think, Simba? - Yeah.

951
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,191
Oh, I don't know.

952
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,272
But somebody once told me...

953
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,636
the great kings of the past are up there...

954
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,838
and they're all watching over us.

955
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,796
That's a good one! That's insane!

956
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,792
That's insane!

957
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,952
Royal dead guys watching over us!

958
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,077
Well, I hope they don't fall out of the sky!

959
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,800
Hang on, Your Majesty! Don't let go!

960
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,280
Oh, that would be a mess.

961
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,510
Oh, man!

962
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,736
I mean, Simba, think about it.

963
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,070
Why would a bunch of kings be looking out for us?

964
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,232
- We're outcasts. - Royal warthogs!

965
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,955
- I can't! I can't! - I can't! I actually can't.

966
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,750
- I can't. - No, you can. I can't.

967
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,874
Yeah. Yeah.

968
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,072
Yeah.

969
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,754
That's stupid.

970
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,960
I'm gonna go get some grubs or something.

971
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,475
- What did you say to him? - I don't know.

972
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,909
As you were saying it,

973
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,354
I thought, "This won't end well."

974
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,796
- You just start laughing. - You laughed too.

975
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,351
I did not. I would never.

976
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,472
Man, I blew it.

977
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,673
Simba.

978
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,556
Simba is alive!

979
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:45,151
A-weema-weh A-weema-weh

980
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:52,632
A-weema-weh A-weema-weh Wee

981

In the jungle, the mightyjungle

984
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,917
The lion sleeps tonight

985
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:13,312
In the jungle, the quietjungle

986
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,837
The lion sleeps tonight

987

01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,755
Near the village, the peaceful village

01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,869
The lion sleeps tonight

991
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,277
Near the village, the quiet village

992
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,353
The lion sleeps tonight

993

Pumbaa!

01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,317
Run for your life!

997
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,036
Run, Pumbaa, run!

998
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,640
Timon, help!

999
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,400
Pumbaa!

1000
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,350
Pumbaa?

1001
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,519
I'm gonna die!

1002
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,273
I'm coming, Pumbaa! Hang in there!

1003
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,038
Move! Move! Move!

1004
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,840
No!

1005
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,280
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1006
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,800
No!

1007
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,400
Nala?

1008
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,912
Simba?

1009
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,273
Is that really you?

1010
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,635
Yeah.

1011
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,632
It's me, Simba!

1012
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,016
Nala, what're you doing? Oh, my...

1013
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,040
I don't believe it!

1014
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,520
Look at you!

1015
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,600
Pumbaa...

1016
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,319
I don't think you're getting eaten.

1017
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,359
Oh, where have you been?

1018
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,954
I thought you were dead!

1019
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,999
You thought he was dead. I thought I was dead!

1020
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,192
I thought you were gonna eat me.

1021
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,317
What fun!

1022
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,358
I'm so sorry, before we move on,

1023
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,640
how do you two know each other?

1024
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:35,876
Timon, Pumbaa...

1025
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,952
I want you to meet my best friend, Nala.

1026
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,430
Best friend? Well, that hurts.

1027
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,200
Nala, you're gonna love it here!

1028
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,360
This place is amazing.

1029
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,033
It's everything you could ever want.

1030
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,398
Simba, we need to leave.

1031
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,559
Scar has taken over with the hyenas.

1032
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,754
You have to take your place as king.

1033
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,195
King? Simba?

1034
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,870
We kneel before you as loyal servants.

1035
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,997
Pumbaa, relax. She's wrong.

1036
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,560
Lady, you've got your lions crossed.

1037
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,600
Nice.

1038
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,239
Seeing you again,

1039
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,198
you don't know what this will mean to everyone.

1040
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,431
What this means to me.

1041
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,672
You have to come home.

1042
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,872
This is my home.

1043
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:14,960
Please stay.

1044
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,600
This place is incredible.

1045
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,399
I know you'll love it.

1046
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,960
I can't.

1047
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,395
Come on!

1048
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,358
At least let me show you around.

1049
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,512
Where are you going?

1050
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:35,760
Simba, it's so beautiful.

1051
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,960
I can see what's happening I can't. What?

1052
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,916
And they don't have a clue Who's "they"?

1053
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,357
They'll fall in love And here's the bottom line

1054
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,800
Our trio's down to two Oh, I get it.

1055
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,720
The sweet caress of twilight Yeah.

1056
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,836
There's magic ev'rywhere It's ev'rywhere.

1057
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:59,875
And with all this romantic atmosphere

1058
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,952
Disaster's in the air

1059
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,795
Can you feel the love tonight?

1060
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:19,873
The peace the evening brings

1061
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:27,270
The world for once in perfect harmony

1062
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:31,992
With all its living things

1063
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,519
So many things to tell her

1064
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:42,638
But how to make her see The truth about my past?

1065
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,992
Impossible She'd turn away from me

1066
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,080
He's holding back, he's hiding

1067
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,871
But what, I can't decide

1068
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,078
Why won't he be the king I know he is?

1069
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,075
The king I see inside?

1070
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,830
Can you feel the love tonight?

1071
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:12,157
The peace the evening brings

1072
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:19,317
The world for once in perfect harmony

1073
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:23,913
With all its living things

1074
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:31,515
Can you feel the love tonight?

1075
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:38,150
You needn't look too far

1076
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:45,154
Stealing through the night's uncertainties

1077
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:49,832
Love is where they are

1078
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:57,471
And if he falls in love tonight

1079
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:03,113
It can be assumed

1080
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:10,154
His carefree days with us are history

1081
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:17,359
In short, our pal is doomed

1082
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,636
I told you. Isn't it great here?

1083
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,678
You know, maybe it could be like this forever.

1084
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,672
It's amazing.

1085
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:41,318
But there's something I don't understand.

1086
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,711
If you've been alive all this time...

1087
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,792
why haven't you come home?

1088
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,071
We've really needed you.

1089
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,640
They're fine, all right?

1090
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,160
Nobody needs me.

1091
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,039
You're the king.

1092
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,874
Nala, Scar is the king.

1093
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,919
Simba, he's decimated the Pride Lands.

1094
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,878
There's no food, no water...

1095
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,952
There's nothing I can do.

1096
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,679
What about your mother?

1097
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,797
This is your responsibility.

1098
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,360
You need to challenge Scar.

1099
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,354
I can't go back. Ever.

1100
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,715
Why?

1101
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,633
Because of what happened at the gorge?

1102
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,916
Scar told us that...

1103
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,309
You wouldn't understand!

1104
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,880
None of it matters. Okay?

1105
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,394
Hakuna matata.

1106
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,560
What?

1107
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,473
It's something I learned out here, okay?

1108
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,279
You see, sometimes bad things happen,

1109
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,999
and there's nothing you can do about it.

1110
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,594
So, why worry?

1111
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,712
Why worry?

1112
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,798
What happened to you?

1113
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,236
You're not the Simba I remember.

1114
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:38,114
And I never will be. Are you satisfied?

1115
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,999
No, I'm disappointed.

1116
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,280
You know, now you're starting to sound like my father.

1117
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,114
Good. I'm glad one of us does.

1118
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,190
You have no idea what I've been through!

1119
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,960
I came here looking for help.

1120
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,150
I guess I made a mistake.

1121
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,953
Goodbye, Simba.

1122
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,074
"Disappointed"?

1123
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,871
She wants me to go home?

1124
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,997
I am home.

1125
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,037
"Best friend"?

1126
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,510
I don't need best friends. I don't need anybody.

1127
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,480
Never did.

1128
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,431
Go away.

1129
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,160
Going away will not answer the question.

1130
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,960
What question? Who are you?

1131
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,317
I know exactly who I am.

1132
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,915
The question is, who are you?

1133
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:11,390
I'm nobody. So leave me alone. All right?

1134
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,720
Everybody is somebody. Even a nobody.

1135
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,912
Yeah, I think you're confused.

1136
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,599
I am confused?

1137
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,600
You don't even know who you are.

1138
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,717
Oh. And I suppose you do?

1139
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,951
I held the son of Mufasa.

1140
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,595
You knew my father?

1141
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,680
Correction.

1142
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,599
I know your father.

1143
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,951
He died a long time ago.

1144
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,634
He's alive!

1145
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,879
And I can take you to him.

1146
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,993
Follow me. I will show you!

1147
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,160
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey!

1148
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,320
If you can keep up!

1149
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,474
Wait!

1150
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,599
Follow me!

1151
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:09,755
Quickly, quickly! Come through!

1152
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,240
Hey! Slow down!

1153
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,400
Hey, you better hurry.

1154
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,320
Hold on. I'm coming, I'm coming.

1155
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:44,680
Come.

1156
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,314
Your father is waiting.

1157
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,272
Do you see him?

1158
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,717
I don't see anything.

1159
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,120
Look closer.

1160
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,272
You see?

1161
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,040
He lives in you.

1162
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,439
Simba.

1163
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,960
Dad?

1164
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:43,353
Simba.

1165
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:48,311
You must take your place in the circle of life.

1166
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:50,920
I can't.

1167
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,959
You must remember who you are.

1168
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,510
The one true king.

1169
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:57,750
I'm sorry.

1170
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,952
I don't know how to be like you.

1171
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:05,600
As king, I was most proud of one thing.

1172
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,320
Having you as my son.

1173
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,717
That was a long time ago.

1174
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:17,034
No, Simba. That is forever.

1175
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,560
Please.

1176
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,473
Don't leave me again.

1177
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,917
I never left you.

1178
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,197
And never will.

1179
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,240
Remember who you are.

1180
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,871
Remember.

1181
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,994
And so, I ask again.

1182
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,236
Who are you?

1183
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:54,791
I am Simba.

1184
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:57,236
Son of Mufasa.

1185
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:26,360
Yeah Spirit

1186
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:30,830
Watch the heavens open

1187
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,911
Yeah

1188
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:38,518
Spirit

1189
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:42,796
Can you hear it calling?

1190
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,670
Yeah

1191
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,436
Simba?

1192
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,956
Come on! What are you waiting for?

1193
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:54,674
Let's go home!

1194
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,591
Spirit

1195
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:10,834
Watch the heavens open, open Yeah

1196
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:15,111
Your destiny is coming close

1197
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:18,394
Stand up and fight

1198
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:28,311
So, go in to a far-off land

1199
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:34,875
And be one with the great I am

1200
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,716
I didn't wanna believe you.

1201
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:51,951
So, what are you gonna do?

1202
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,873
My father once told me to protect

1203
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:55,713
everything the light touches.

1204
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,600
If I don't fight for it, who will?

1205
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,599
I will.

1206
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,319
It's going to be dangerous.

1207
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,437
Danger? Ha!

1208
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,718
I laugh in the face of danger.

1209
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,518
It can't be!

1210
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,512
Hello, Zazu.

1211
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,672
Your Majesty.

1212
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,600
Welcome home.

1213
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:24,920
We're here!

1214
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,559
Oh, everyone, calm down. We're here.

1215
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,393
The backup has arrived!

1216
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,074
What are you guys doing here?

1217
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:33,517
- Um, we were not worried! - Um... No, not worried.

1218
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,280
- 'Cause no worries. - Nope. Hakuna matata.

1219
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:38,751
- We were concerned, because... - Because, you know...

1220
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,240
You're our friend.

1221
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,160
What about the meaningless line of indifference?

1222
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,669
Well, we were thinking...

1223
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,960
- maybe it curves a little bit. - That's a good point.

1224
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,275
I mean, Simba, look,

1225
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,272
I'm happy to admit when Pumbaa's wrong...

1226
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:51,496
and this is one of those instances.

1227
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,600
What? That wasn't my thing.

1228
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,870
You told me about the line.

1229
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,040
Wait, hold on.

1230
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,994
Now, this is the place you're fighting for?

1231
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,391
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

1232
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,751
Is it behind that terrifying rock?

1233
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:04,798
Talk about your fixer-upper.

1234
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,314
I like what you've done with it,

1235
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,119
although a bit heavy on the carcass.

1236
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:09,919
Hey, hey, look. A bird.

1237
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,675
Timon, Pumbaa, this is Zazu.

1238
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:15,038
Oh, wow! It's a puffin.

1239
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,560
Charming.

1240
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,710
Simba, we are with you until the end.

1241
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,111
We are at your service, my liege!

1242
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,199
Follow me.

1243
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:40,914
Hyenas everywhere.

1244
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:42,355
I hope it's a quick death.

1245
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:43,840
You know, just not a lot of chewing.

1246
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,056
What's your plan for getting us

1247
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:46,230
past the slobbering guards?

1248
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,792
Live bait.

1249
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,713
That's a great idea.

1250
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,156
Those guys could never resist fresh meat.

1251
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:00,353
So all we need to do is find something that's, like, big...

1252
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,557
and plump, and juicy.

1253
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,837
Maybe like a gnu?

1254
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:08,357
Why is everyone looking at me?

1255
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:16,316
It is with deepest pride

1256
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,437
and greatest pleasure...

1257
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:23,479
that we proudly present... your dinner.

1258
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:29,829
Be our guest

1259
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:35,675
It's working, Pumbaa!

1260
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:10,675
My old friend.

1261
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,551
Sarabi, why put yourself through this?

1262
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:16,349
All you have to do is be my queen.

1263
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,954
You're suffering for what?

1264
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:19,952
The memory of a life you once knew?

1265
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:22,112
A king you once loved?

1266
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:26,677
I tried to make you understand what a true king can be.

1267
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:31,517
Scar, a true king's power is his compassion.

1268
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:33,751
I am ten times the king Mufasa was!

1269
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:36,520
You are nothing compared to Mufasa!

1270
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,155
Mufasa?

1271
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:50,356
It can't be.

1272
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,837
Get away from my mother.

1273
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:56,840
Simba.

1274
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,277
You're alive?

1275
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,750
How can that be?

1276
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,037
I'm here, Mother.

1277
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,240
I'm home.

1278
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,800
Simba...

1279
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,237
I'm so happy to see you.

1280
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:12,320
Alive.

1281
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:17,760
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1282
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,031
I can give you more than one.

1283
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,316
You see...

1284
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,558
they think I'm king.

1285
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,752
Well, we don't.

1286
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,957
Your reign is over, Scar.

1287
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,520
Simba is the rightful king!

1288
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:38,196
If you wanna get him, you have to get through us.

1289
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,437
Are you with me, lions?

1290
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:47,589
The choice is yours, Scar. Step down or fight.

1291
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:50,680
Must this all end in violence?

1292
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:55,591
I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member.

1293
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:59,074
To feel the shame of knowing...

1294
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,550
I took the life of someone I love.

1295
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:03,554
I put all that behind me.

1296
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,958
But have they put it behind them?

1297
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:09,919
Do your faithful subjects know what you've done?

1298
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,594
What is he talking about?

1299
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:15,037
So you haven't told them your little secret?

1300
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,556
Well, Simba...

1301
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,993
now's your chance to confess.

1302
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,797
Tell them who's responsible for Mufasa's death.

1303
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,832
It was me.

1304
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,032
It's not true.

1305
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:40,037
Tell me it's not true.

1306
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,919
It's true. I'm sorry.

1307
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,878
He admits it.

1308
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:45,040
Murderer!

1309
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:47,078
No, no. It was an accident.

1310
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,152
If it weren't for you the king would be alive.

1311
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,880
It's your fault he's dead! Do you deny it?

1312
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,040
I'm not a murderer.

1313
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,875
We should believe a son who takes the life of a father?

1314
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:58,475
We should believe a son who takes the life of a king?

1315
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:00,957
A son who abandons his mother?

1316
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,640
No. I'm...

1317
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,713
You're what? Say it! Are you the king?

1318
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,030
No. No, I'm...

1319
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:08,616
- Are you the king? - No, I'm...

1320
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:10,313
- You're what? Say it! - I'm...

1321
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:12,956
I'm nothing.

1322
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,794
Then bow to your king!

1323
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:18,750
Simba!

1324
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,437
This looks familiar.

1325
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:40,919
Where have I seen this before?

1326
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:44,034
Oh, yes, I remember.

1327
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,032
This is the way Mufasa looked before he died.

1328
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:53,995
I looked down... saw the fear in his eyes.

1329
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,958
And here's my little secret.

1330
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:03,999
I killed Mufasa.

1331
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,240
No!

1332
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,160
My father!

1333
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:20,520
Your own brother!

1334
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:21,670
How could you?

1335
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,559
First he kills Mufasa...

1336
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,520
and now he wants to kill me!

1337
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:26,909
You killed him!

1338
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,400
Tell them the truth!

1339
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,074
Don't believe his lies!

1340
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:31,475
Scar...

1341
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:34,838
you told us you didn't get to the gorge in time.

1342
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,509
That's true!

1343
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:39,832
Then how did you see the look in Mufasa's eyes?

1344
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,000
Murderer!

1345
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:45,120
Kill them all!

1346
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,440
Lions, attack!

1347
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:09,999
Simba!

1348
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,593
- Pumbaa, I think we lost them. - That was terrifying.

1349
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:21,633
Do you hear a low growl?

1350
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,075
Looks like we'll be having pig for dinner.

1351
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,197
Plump and chubby.

1352
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:28,949
Chubby?

1353
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,357
- Did he just call me chubby? - Uh-oh.

1354
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,955
It sounded a lot like he just said "chubby".

1355
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:35,918
Which would be a mistake because...

1356
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,356
I will not be made to feel ashamed of who I am!

1357
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:39,440
Oh, boy.

1358
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,318
I may run from hyenas...

1359
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,631
but I will always fight a bully!

1360
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:53,520
- You feel better, Pumbaa? - I do.

1361
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,696
You got that out of your system?

1362
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:55,720
I did.

1363
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:13,591
Now, this is a meal I've waited my whole life for.

1364
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:16,750
I've been waiting too.

1365
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:18,877
And I'm not a cub anymore!

1366
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:26,157
For king and country!

1367
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:29,836
It's the bird!

1368
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,400
I got him! I got him!

1369
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,280
Tally-ho!

1370
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,520
Oh! No! He's got me!

1371
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:36,795
He's got me! Ooh!

1372
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,480
Get that bird!

1373
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,710
Please! Let's discuss this.

1374
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,719
That never gets old!

1375
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,235
It's over, Scar.

1376
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:41,800
Have mercy. I beg you.

1377
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:43,394
Mercy?

1378
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,835
After what you did?

1379
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:47,118
It was the hyenas.

1380
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,636
Those revolting scavengers made me do it.

1381
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,917
I was planning on killing them all.

1382
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,760
You fooled the hyenas.

1383
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,273
Just like you fooled me.

1384
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:01,555
Simba...

1385
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:03,877
you wouldn't kill your only uncle.

1386
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:06,756
No, Scar.

1387
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:10,039
I'm not like you.

1388
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:15,116
Oh, Simba... you are truly noble.

1389
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,999
And I will make it up to you.

1390
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:20,039
Just tell me how I can prove myself.

1391
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,795
Tell me what you want me to do.

1392
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,360
Run.

1393
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:30,837
Run away, Scar.

1394
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:34,472
Run away and never return.

1395
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:37,400
Yes.

1396
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,192
Of course.

1397
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:44,509
As you wish... Your Majesty.

1398
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,916
Aah!

1399
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:58,720
You can't win, Scar!

1400
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,360
This is my kingdom!

1401
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:01,749
My destiny!

1402
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,280
My friends.

1403
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:57,840
It will take some time,

1404
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:00,395
but together we will build our army.

1405
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:01,960
"Friends", huh?

1406
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:06,116
I thought you said we were "revolting scavengers"?

1407
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:09,193
Yeah. That you wanted to kill us?

1408
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:10,360
No.

1409
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,675
No, let me explain.

1410
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,710
I was trying to fool him.

1411
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,314
We will rule together!

1412
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:20,672
There's only one true thing you ever said, Scar.

1413
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:27,072
"A hyena's belly... "is never full."

1414
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:34,230
No!

1415
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,317
Your Majesty.

1416
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:25,357
Remember.

1417
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:20,039
Till we find our place

1418
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:24,875
On the path unwinding

1419
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:30,511
In the circle

1420
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:34,993
The circle of life

1421
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:41,874
Circle of life

1422
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:29,671
It's never too late to turn things around

1423
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,754
Recover, unravel the path to confound

1424
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:37,550
The doubters and losers that line up despair

1425
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:41,395
Who tell you it's over, you're goin' nowhere

1426
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:46,316
It's never too late, I hope It's never too late

1427
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:53,080
It's never too late to get back on track

1428
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:56,949
To get at least some, if not all of it back

1429
01:48:57,040 --> 01:49:00,750
I thought I was happy, and sometimes I was

1430
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:04,311
But sadness is just as important because

1431
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:07,632
Got to carry the weight and hope

1432
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:09,200
It's never too late

1433
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:14,439
Never too late to fight the fight

1434
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,637
Never too late to cheat the night

1435
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,518
Never too late to win the day

1436
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:20,319
Never too late to break away

1437
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,278
Time will start to move too fast

1438
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:24,033
But time is now, my friend

1439
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:27,756
I'm a long way from the start But further from the end

1440
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:32,513
Oh, no, it's never too late

1441
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:39,555
It's never too late to get up off the ground

1442
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:43,316
Don't have to be noticed, don't have to be crowned

1443
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:47,235
I did what I've done, and I don't try to hide

1444
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:51,200
I've lost many things, but never my pride

1445
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:56,230
It's never too late, I know It's never too late

1446
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:00,958
Never too late to fight the fight

1447
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,032
Never too late to cheat the night

1448
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:05,032
Never too late to win the day

1449
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:06,958
Never too late to break away

1450
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:08,759
Time will start to move too fast

1451
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,559
But time is now, my friend

1452
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:14,475
I'm a long way from the start But further from the end

1453
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:19,038
Oh, no, it's never too late

1454
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,713
Never too late

1455
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:35,717
I used to say I don't have time

1456
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:37,519
I'm sleepin' tonight

1457
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:41,480
A day doin' nothin' is doin' it right

1458
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:45,315
No hurry, no hurry, it takes as long as it takes

1459
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:46,914
You might as well sleep

1460
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,912
for all the difference it makes

1461
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,755
I didn't find love or peace on the breaks

1462
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:56,629
These aren't excuses, but a string of mistakes

1463
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:59,599
I won't go back there

1464
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:03,473
Not going back there

1465
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,877
Never too late to fight the fight

1466
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,838
Never too late to cheat the night

1467
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:12,832
Never too late to win the day

1468
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:14,752
Never too late to break away

1469
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:16,672
Never too late to fight the fight

1470
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:18,513
Never too late to cheat the night

1471
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:20,557
Never too late to win the day

1472
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:22,393
Never too late to break away

1473
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:24,199
Time will start to move too fast

1474
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,118
But time is now, my friend

1475
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:29,631
I'm a long way from the start But further from the end

1476
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:35,116
Oh, oh, it's never too late

1477
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,678
It's never too late

1478
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:42,197
Oh, never too late

1479
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:46,112
Oh, it's never too late

1480
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:50,075
No, it's never too late
