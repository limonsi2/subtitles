00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:33,300
If you make smart,
strategic choices

6
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:36,900
you can maximize your efficiency
every single day.

7
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:43,133
If you save 10 minutes a day,
that adds up to 41 hours a year.

8
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:45,900
We're implementing
Nicky's strategic plan

9
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:48,100
and you'll all be receiving

10
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,433
a little extra gift
in your paychecks.

11
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,834
Christmas bonuses.

12
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:57,433
Congratulations.

13
00:01:57,567 --> 00:02:00,367
And you'll notice that we
finished 10 minutes early.

14
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:02,633
Thank you all
for your attention.

15
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:03,900
Happy Holidays.

16
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:12,166
Excellent presentation, Nicky.
Thank you so much.

17
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,700
Oh, I'm so glad.

18
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,000
You know I could've spent more
time on goal setting, but...

19
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:17,066
No, it was perfect.

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,867
What's your availability
like in January?

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,834
I'd like to bring you back.

22
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,033
I'm free.

23
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,133
You're going to be busy.

24
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,333
That's me!

25
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,333
I can't wait to see you.

26
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:32,867
I know, I'm so excited.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,500
Oh, hey!

28
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:34,734
Hi Nicky.

29
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:37,000
Anthony, is that you?
How tall are you now?

30
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:38,233
Five six and a half?

31
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,367
Your mom told me that
you made the JB team.

32
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,700
Yup. Youngest on the team.

33
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:43,900
Yeah. He eats all the time.

34
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,633
Oh, get the pie out.
Please?

35
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:46,900
Hey, so we're on for Friday,
right?

36
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,200
Yes. Uh, we will meet
at the flower shop.

37
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,700
I will order some lunch.

38
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:52,033
Can't wait to see you.
I love you.

39
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,066
Love you, bye!

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,066
Bye.

41
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:02,266
I'm serious, you're going
to spoil your dinner.

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,600
I'm making pork chops.

43
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:05,033
We're just going to grab
a pizza.

44
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,400
Oh.

45
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,266
Jeremy's taking me and Chad
to work on free throws.

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,367
I thought I mentioned it.

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,734
Nope, but that's fine.
It's just fine.

48
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:13,467
That's Chad. I'll get it.

49
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,633
Okay.

50
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,133
-Hello beautiful.
-Hi.

51
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:19,066
Mwah.

52
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,033
-How was work?
-It was fine.

53
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,200
You're taking the guys
to the gym?

54
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,600
I thought you had to work late.

55
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:26,300
No, the presentation got
postponed just like I predicted.

56
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:27,200
Right.

57
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,266
Oh, it's my mom.

58
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,300
She probably wants
to tell us

59
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,600
what day she's coming
for Christmas.

60
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:33,734
Well, I'd really like
to know that

61
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:35,767
so I have time to mentally
prepare.

62
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,567
She'll leave a voicemail.

63
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,033
Really not going to help me
that much.

64
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,633
-Hey Anthony, you ready buddy?
-Yup!

65
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:42,300
Oh, I'm going to show these kids
how it's done.

66
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:47,900
-I'll see you tomorrow, babe.
-Yeah, bye.

67
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:49,800
I hate this kitchen.

68
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:57,667
-Thank you so much.
-Happy Thanksgiving.

69
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:00,800
Hi! Mom!

70
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:02,266
You're here.

71
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,166
Hey sweetheart.

72
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,600
It's so good to see you.
Hi Dad.

73
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:06,500
Hi honey.

74
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:07,934
Let's get inside.
It's cold.

75
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:08,867
-Here, let me get your bag.
-Okay, yeah. Absolutely.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,266
Thank you so much, Dad.
Okay.

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,166
So, how was your trip?

78
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,300
Hey, hey, hey.
Come in here.

79
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,834
I got it.

80
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:24,967
It's a done deal.

81
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,700
Are you serious?

82
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:26,767
Yeah.

83
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,767
We can surprise her
at Christmas.

84
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,867
No way.

85
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:30,834
What did I miss?

86
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:33,266
Uh, nothing. Um, we were...

87
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,367
We were just talking about
how great the table looks.

88
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,633
Oh!

89
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,600
Yeah, that thing in the middle
is very cool.

90
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:39,433
It's fun, right?

91
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:40,934
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

92
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:41,867
Yeah.

93
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:44,934
Uh, I'm going to get the turkey.

94
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,033
Me too.

95
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,900
They're being helpful.

96
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:55,266
Nicky, why don't
you start first?

97
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,467
Oh, okay.

98
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,166
Well, I am grateful to be
spending Thanksgiving

99
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,000
with my two favorite people.

100
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:06,567
I am grateful that we were
both able to retire this year.

101
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,834
Yeah.

102
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,700
And embark on a whole new phase
in our lives.

103
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,667
Wherever that takes us.

104
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,934
Near or not so near.

105
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,066
Why do I get the sense

106
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,700
that you two are trying
to tell me something?

107
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:23,433
Honey, um...

108
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:27,166
Your mom and I have decided
to downsize.

109
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,233
We're selling the house.

110
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:31,367
We wanted to tell you
in person.

111
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,066
This is the house
that you grew up in

112
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,200
and well we weren't sure how
you were going to take the news.

113
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,000
I think it's terrific.

114
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,066
You do?

115
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,433
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
I think it's great.

116
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:49,667
Good for you.

117
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,233
You know what?
You should travel to Europe.

118
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:53,567
You, you could take that trip
to Alaska

119
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,066
that you've always dreamed of,
that cruise.

120
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,066
You should do all the fun things
that you want to do

121
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,100
that you worked so hard for.

122
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:03,400
Thank you so much
for your support.

123
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:05,800
We thought that you might feel
like you're losing

124
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:07,100
a piece of your childhood.

125
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,834
What? No.

126
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:11,800
My home is wherever
you two are.

127
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:12,900
Aw.

128
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:14,567
But I have a great idea.
You know what?

129
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,133
You should go look at property
up in upstate New York.

130
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:18,967
I love it there,
it's so close.

131
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,133
It would be beautiful.

132
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:21,633
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

133
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:23,433
We're not leaving Marsden.
We love it here.

134
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,600
We just need something smaller.

135
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,567
Oh. Yeah.

136
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,967
Of course.

137
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,266
Okay. Well, uh, I'll help
you find a local realtor.

138
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,233
We hired one.

139
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:36,300
Simone's fiancÃ© has a friend,
Derrick.

140
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:40,400
Wow. You two are further along
than I... than I thought.

141
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,800
Honey, if you really wanted
to help

142
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,600
maybe you could stay
a little longer.

143
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:47,400
We've got a lot to pack
and purge.

144
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:51,066
Of course, Mom. I would love
to help.

145
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,400
That's wonderful.

146
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:54,967
I'm so excited, you'll be here
for Christmas.

147
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,800
Christmas?

148
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:58,967
What? What, what are you
talking about?

149
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,533
No, no, no. I said I would
help, you know.

150
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,500
A couple days I would stay,
speed pack.

151
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,533
And then you two can come
see me on the 22nd.

152
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,033
Your mother and I thought
it might be nice

153
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,900
to have one last Christmas
in this house.

154
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:13,467
For old times' sake to go
and pick a tree

155
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,200
at Jensen's farm together
and decorate it.

156
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,867
Just like when you were little.

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,333
I would love that.

158
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,033
All right. To Christmases past.

159
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,166
And new beginnings.

160
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,266
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

161
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,533
Oh no, Mom.

162
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:30,800
I was such a nerd.

163
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:33,133
I can't believe I kept
all my old textbooks.

164
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:36,000
You said you wanted to reread
them over the summer.

165
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,700
No wonder no one wanted
to hang out with me.

166
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,000
Come on over, we'll redo
our trig assignments.

167
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,567
Yeah.

168
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,333
Well, it's not like you had a
whole lot of time to socialize.

169
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,467
You were in math competitions
almost every weekend.

170
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,500
I mean... look.
Look how many you won.

171
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:53,800
Yeah. I...

172
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,467
Mom, why did you frame
my Valedictorian speech?

173
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,700
So, it wouldn't get ruined.

174
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:02,200
You thought I would want
to keep something

175
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:07,233
to remind me of literally
the worst day of my entire life?

176
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,133
So, a few people didn't connect
with your speech.

177
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:11,433
It came from your heart.
I loved it.

178
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,767
Mom, half the kids laughed
and the other half thought

179
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,867
I needed to be
under observation.

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,100
I think that's just because
they didn't expect you to sing.

181
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:23,266
Yeah, I wasn't expecting
that either.

182
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,934
No. That is when I learned
not to trust my instincts.

183
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:29,233
Oh! Look.

184
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:32,266
This is from when Simone
lived next door.

185
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,734
You two decided that you wanted
to dress exactly alike

186
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:38,367
that entire year,
so I just gave up

187
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,767
and started buying
two of everything.

188
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,233
Oh, honey, nobody remembers
that speech

189
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:47,233
and you were not an outcast
in high school.

190
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,900
Why did I even keep this book?
I tested out of...

191
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:53,333
What's that?

192
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,333
I don't know.

193
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:01,533
-Who's it from?
-I don't know.

194
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:10,266
Uh, it's not signed.

195
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,867
"Dear Nicky.

196
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,367
"I guess I'm too shy to tell you
this in person,

197
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,300
"so I figured an anonymous note
is the way to go.

198
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:23,500
"You're an amazing person,
I hope you know that.

199
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:25,467
"The time you complimented
my drawing

200
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,633
"and when you congratulated me
last week

201
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,934
"on winning against
Mountain Point

202
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:33,767
"it really put a smile
on my face.

203
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,934
"Hopefully this card
makes you smile.

204
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,900
"Merry Christmas".

205
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:41,600
And, and there's a phrase
written in it.

206
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:47,166
"With love's light wings
did I o'erperch these walls,

207
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,000
"for stony limits cannot
hold love out."

208
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:54,200
Hmm. What a beautiful sentiment.

209
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:06,600
Oh, oh honey.

210
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:11,133
No, it's, it's just that whoever
wrote this was right.

211
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:13,867
It's true I never smiled, ever.

212
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:21,000
I just don't know how
I missed it, you know?

213
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:25,200
I really needed to have
found this then,

214
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:32,300
to know that someone felt
this way about me back then.

215
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:35,133
Maybe you needed
to find it now.

216
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:42,700
Maybe.

217
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,700
Oh, my gosh,
you are here!

218
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:58,000
I have missed you so much!

219
00:10:58,133 --> 00:10:59,000
Wait, let me see it.

220
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:01,233
Oh, yeah.
It's beautiful.

221
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,867
I can't wait to see you walk
down the aisle.

222
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,667
You are going to give a toast at
the reception this time, right?

223
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,000
What? No.

224
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:09,266
You don't need me to do that.

225
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,433
You have a Best Man for that.

226
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:11,500
How many speeches
do you need?

227
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:12,533
You are the Maid of Honor.

228
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:13,667
Besides, if you don't do it

229
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,934
it'll just be Jeremy's
gym buddies.

230
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,033
Please, please, please. Please?

231
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,567
Yes, of course.
Of course, I will.

232
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,667
If you want me to make a speech
I'm going to make a speech.

233
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,033
-I can do it.
-Yes, you can.

234
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,934
You have waited so long
to find someone like Jeremy,

235
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,533
and I want to do whatever I can

236
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:30,033
to help you make this wedding
the most perfect day ever.

237
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,000
Thank you.

238
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:31,734
Oh, love you.

239
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:33,066
I love you too.

240
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,934
Well?

241
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,700
I know. Look at this place, wow.

242
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:38,500
You have made it so fantastic.

243
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:40,233
There's so much more here
than there used to be.

244
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,900
I know, I'm on track to do twice
as much as I did last Christmas.

245
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:44,100
Wow, look at you.

246
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:45,367
I know.

247
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,834
Well, I want to help out
or whatever I can do.

248
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:47,834
Okay.

249
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,900
But I have something
to show you.

250
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:52,400
"With love's light wings
did I o'erperch these walls,

251
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:55,367
"for stony limits cannot
hold love out."

252
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:59,100
Whoever wrote this clearly
thought a lot of you.

253
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:00,233
I know.

254
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,767
That's what's so hard
to understand.

255
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,734
Why is that surprising?

256
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:04,934
You remember me in high school.

257
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:06,233
Mm-hmm.

258
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:08,400
I was the kid that wasn't
in the play, you know?

259
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:09,800
I'm always on the sidelines.

260
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:12,767
Everybody felt that way back
in high school, Nik.

261
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,800
And there she is.

262
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,266
-Hi.
-Hi.

263
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,467
Oh, it's so nice to see you.

264
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,834
Good to see you.

265
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,734
I thought you guys might be
getting hungry.

266
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:22,600
Yeah, we were.

267
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:24,100
And where's Anthony?

268
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,066
Uh, I told him I'd pick him up
at his buddy Chad's house

269
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,633
and pry the video game
controller out of his hand.

270
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:28,333
Thank you.

271
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:29,467
Of course, yes.

272
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,900
Uh, so I'll leave you two
to, to dish.

273
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:31,934
Okay.

274
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:33,300
And I'll have Anthony back
at 9:00.

275
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:34,967
Oh, 9:00?
I'm done at 6:00.

276
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,266
Maybe we could all have dinner.

277
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,166
Oh I... I'm sorry, babe.

278
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,734
I... You know, I told Anthony

279
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:42,400
I'd take him Christmas shopping
for your gift.

280
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:43,567
Oh.

281
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,734
But uh, we'll grab some food
at the mall.

282
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:46,934
I'll make sure he eats
real food.

283
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,433
Or, you know, at least
the most real food

284
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,500
you can get at the mall.

285
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,300
Ok. bye.

286
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:52,734
Okay. Well, I'll see you at home
then, I guess.

287
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:54,033
All right. Bye.

288
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,967
He's really leaning into
this parenting thing, huh?

289
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,433
Yeah. He is definitely
the father figure

290
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:01,233
I always wanted for Anthony.

291
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:03,667
I mean, he even spent every
weekend over the summer

292
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,333
teaching him how to rebuild
the engine of an old Mustang
Jeremy bought.

293
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,533
That's great, right?

294
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,367
Yeah, it is.

295
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,800
But between Jeremy and
basketball and his friends

296
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:16,867
I just, I don't see him
very much.

297
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,333
Aw.

298
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:21,133
I know.

299
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,400
Derrick, hi.

300
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:35,900
Welcome home, boys.

301
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,667
Oh man I... I can't believe
it's actually ours.

302
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,200
Well, guess what?

303
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,500
It's going to feel a whole lot
more real once we're inside.

304
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:43,633
These are for you.
Closing docs and insurance.

305
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:44,667
Great.

306
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,734
And I will let you do
the honors.

307
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:46,467
Oh.

308
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,567
Woah!

309
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,834
Or of course, Anthony.

310
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:50,667
After you.

311
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,834
Age before beauty, bud.

312
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,233
Two ovens?

313
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,000
Mom's going to love this place.

314
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,934
So, what now?

315
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:02,533
We list my condo.

316
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:05,066
But don't go public with it till
after the Christmas surprise.

317
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,266
You know I can keep a secret.

318
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,133
I do, yeah.

319
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:08,467
How about you, buddy?

320
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,133
Won't breathe a word.
Can I go pick out my room?

321
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,233
Yes.

322
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:15,967
Do you remember the look
on my dad's face

323
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,800
when he sipped that eggnog?

324
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:20,066
He was trying so hard
not to hurt our feelings.

325
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,033
We had no idea what tempering
eggs meant.

326
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:29,266
You still have the stockings
that we made for your hamsters?

327
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,700
Yeah.

328
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:33,033
I mean, come on, they're cute.
I couldn't let them go.

329
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,500
Of course not.

330
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:39,133
You couldn't let
this go either?

331
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:40,633
I know.

332
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:43,266
I... I just kept that in case
Anthony wanted it one day.

333
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
Does he ask about Ryan?

334
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,400
Uh, no.

335
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:51,567
The last time was, uh, right
after Jeremy proposed.

336
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,367
He wanted to know if Jeremy
would leave us

337
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,233
the same way his dad did.

338
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:58,533
What did you say?

339
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,133
It caught me so off-guard

340
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,533
I just said, "No, Jeremy's
in it to win it."

341
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,767
Well, he is.

342
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,000
Jeremy is such a good guy.
He was even in high school.

343
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:12,266
And you deserve that.
So, does Anthony.

344
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,834
Thanks.

345
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:14,800
Hey!

346
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:16,300
Hey, come and say hi
to Nicky.

347
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:18,266
-Hey bud!
-Hi Nicky.

348
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,333
Oh, look at you.

349
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:21,967
So good to see you.

350
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,367
Where are you off to
in such a hurry?

351
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,266
Snack.

352
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,500
Oh, uh yeah.
Well, go get it.

353
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,533
Help yourself.

354
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:29,967
And that right there is why I
will never be able to retire.

355
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,200
He eats all the time.

356
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,033
So, are you going to try
to find him?

357
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,300
Who?

358
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:40,200
The guy who wrote the mystery
card obviously.

359
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,300
Aren't you curious?

360
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,033
Of course, I'm curious.

361
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,934
But how am I supposed
to figure out who it is?

362
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:47,533
There were 250 people
in our graduating class.

363
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,834
Well, um, okay.

364
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:53,000
I think he was an athlete,
right?

365
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:54,767
Because he said that
you congratulated him

366
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,333
on the win against
Mountain Point.

367
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:58,967
Hmm. That's very good, Sherlock.

368
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,066
And it was a Christmas card, so
I mean, probably a winter sport.

369
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,233
Football.

370
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:06,834
Oh, my god.

371
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,533
Only you could go to high school
for four years

372
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,700
and not know that our
high school football team

373
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:12,800
never won against
Mountain Point.

374
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,400
But I bet you it was basketball.

375
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:17,533
Yeah.

376
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:18,734
And obviously he knew
about literature

377
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:20,400
because that last quote,
it was...

378
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:23,400
it could have been out of
a Jane Austen or something.

379
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:24,567
You know, I could look it up.

380
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,100
-Yes, yeah, okay.
-This is fun.

381
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:28,033
Yeah. This is fun.

382
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,333
Okay.

383
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:37,133
Um, "With love's white wings
did I o'erperch."

384
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,066
From Romeo and Juliet.

385
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,834
Oh!

386
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,734
Shakespeare's most famous story
about unrequited love.

387
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,867
That's telling.

388
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,367
Maybe it was Reggie.

389
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,900
Do you remember how cute
that boy was?

390
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:53,066
Reggie Green.

391
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,100
Oh, he was cute.

392
00:16:54,233 --> 00:16:56,533
Or Treyton Vega.

393
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,834
Damian Wenzel.
Do you remember him?

394
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:01,467
He worked part-time
at that bakery and he...

395
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
he always gave you those um,
the free...

396
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:04,633
-Crullers!
-Crullers!

397
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:06,967
They were very good crullers.

398
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,934
Hey. The good news is

399
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:12,033
that you have a whole month
to figure this out, right?

400
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,166
What?

401
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,667
Come on. What is it?

402
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,934
Well...

403
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:23,500
What?

404
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:34,266
What if I find him and...
and he forgot that he wrote it.

405
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,100
I mean, I just don't want to put
too much stock in this

406
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:41,934
in case it... it doesn't mean
anything, you know?

407
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:45,066
Hey Nick, you're more memorable
than you realize.

408
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,934
And nobody is going
to have forgotten

409
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,233
writing a card like that.

410
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:51,333
Even all those years ago.

411
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:54,500
It was Shakespeare.

412
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,667
Obviously, he really loved you.

413
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:00,667
Okay, okay.
We'll try to f find him.

414
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,500
-Okay.
-Okay.

415
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:02,367
Yeah.

416
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,967
Okay, here it is.
My favorite house.

417
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,400
I know, I know,
they usually have

418
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:17,667
way more lights up
at this time.

419
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,600
Usually they have it all done
by Thanksgiving.

420
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:21,000
They're incredible.

421
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,066
I just can't believe that
you dragged me out here

422
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,433
in the middle of the night
to look at a house

423
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:26,767
that isn't even for sale.

424
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,633
Shut up, a girl can dream.

425
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:29,433
Yes.

426
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,266
Yes, you can.

427
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,300
And you should dream.

428
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:32,467
Thank you.

429
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,467
But just don't turn
into a stalker okay?

430
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,633
I can't afford the bail.

431
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,266
Well, you know,
they could report me.

432
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,633
It'd be worth the jail time.

433
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:40,433
I'm serious, I love this place.

434
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:42,567
Remember when we were kids
and we used to play house?

435
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,333
This is exactly the type
of house I dreamt about.

436
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:49,467
I love it.

437
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,433
Okay.

438
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:51,633
Now, you have to take
me home,

439
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:52,900
because I think my parents

440
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,400
are going to start selling
my old math awards

441
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,633
for their retirement trip
around the world.

442
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,166
I love you so much.

443
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,200
They're not going far.

444
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,200
They're not going to go far,
yeah.

445
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,867
But we are right now,
let's go.

446
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,300
Let me get your stuff
out of the car.

447
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:10,867
-Okay, let's do it.
-Okay.

448
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,967
We're here.
We made it.

449
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,467
All right. We get...

450
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,800
-Woah, these are-
-Oh, oh! Let me help you.

451
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:19,467
These are bigger and heavier
than I had intended.

452
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,333
Okay.

453
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:21,867
No, they're perfect.

454
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,967
They're perfect and it's going
to look so great on the mantle.

455
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,233
-Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

456
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:26,467
Perks of the trade, you know.
Are you okay?

457
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,967
Oh, yeah. I got it.
I got it now.

458
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,967
-I love you.
-Love you too.

459
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,000
Mwah! Bye.

460
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,000
-Goodnight, drive safe.
-Goodnight.

461
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:35,100
-It's so nice to have you back.
-Oh, it's so nice to be back.

462
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:48,734
Oh, hey. Oh, thank goodness.

463
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:50,200
-Good timing too.
-Yeah.

464
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,867
Yeah, anything to make
this house have

465
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,533
a little holiday pizzazz
is great.

466
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,533
Sorry, um, who are you?

467
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:57,567
Oh, I'm the, I'm the realtor.

468
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,233
Yeah, the homeowners are
on the way back from dinner

469
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:02,667
but I've got a buyer swinging
by here in about 10 minutes,

470
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,633
so, this'll be really helpful.

471
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:06,867
You know, it's amazing.

472
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,033
I can't believe Simone sent this
to us so late.

473
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,367
She's amazing.

474
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,934
Oh, I gotta get rid of this.
This has got to go.

475
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:16,000
What are you doing?

476
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh, I've just got to elevate
this room a little bit.

477
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:23,333
I mean, look at this painting.
Isn't it beautiful?

478
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:26,133
Oh, I love the snow on the trees
and the interplay of light,

479
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,633
I like how the, the flurries
descending.

480
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,700
It's almost like you can sense
the movement, huh?

481
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:33,433
Movement. Mm-hmm.

482
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,467
Yeah.

483
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,233
Movement.

484
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,533
Um, yeah. It's like, whether,
you know,

485
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:47,333
whether it's Baroque or Rococo
or Luminicsm like this piece is.

486
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:48,333
Luminicsm.

487
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:49,400
Yeah.

488
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:51,900
Sure, yeah.
Tell me more.

489
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:54,367
Well, uh, it's uh, this is
a really good friend of mine.

490
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,734
He's extremely,
extremely talented.

491
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:57,834
Mm-hmm.

492
00:20:57,967 --> 00:20:58,967
His name is Reggie Green.

493
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,233
I think his goal...

494
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:01,867
Reggie Green?

495
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,233
I went to school with him.
He's on my list.

496
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,300
Huh.

497
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,700
What do you, what do you mean
"list?"

498
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,133
Oh uh, nothing.

499
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:11,533
I didn't mean to say that.

500
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:12,700
Uh, you're...

501
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:13,900
We're home.

502
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:15,133
We brought cake.

503
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:16,867
Hey Derrick, I see you've met
our daughter.

504
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,533
Yeah. Sure did.

505
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,266
We'll make coffee
while you do the showing.

506
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,133
Okay.

507
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:22,867
Come on, honey.

508
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,233
Oh, yeah. Okay.

509
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:32,333
Okay.

510
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,033
-Thanks so much for coming by.
-Alright, thank you, Derrick.

511
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,133
-Okay, goodnight.
-Goodnight.

512
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,033
Well, that went very well.

513
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,600
I think they may make an offer.

514
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:46,700
Good.

515
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:48,633
There's a cup on the counter
if you want some coffee.

516
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:49,767
Holiday blend.

517
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,567
Do you take cream?

518
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,433
Yeah, no. It's very kind.

519
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:52,934
No, I'm, I'm uh, I'm fine I...

520
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:54,734
Oof, it's getting late.
I should get going.

521
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:56,734
But there is a condo I want
you guys to see, okay?

522
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:57,934
I talked to the owner.

523
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,233
They said we should swing by
Monday at noon.

524
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:00,133
How does that sound?

525
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:01,133
-Great.
-Yeah.

526
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:02,233
All right.

527
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,033
You're welcome to join us
if you'd like.

528
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,266
It's Nicky, right?

529
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,900
Yeah. Do I know you?

530
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,166
I, I saw your name all over
your awards in your room.

531
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,600
I'll take those down before
the next showing, I'm sorry.

532
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:22,533
No, it's, oh, it's fine.

533
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:25,000
Um, text you the address
for Monday, all right?

534
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:25,800
Thanks Derrick.

535
00:22:25,934 --> 00:22:26,633
Right. Goodnight.

536
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:27,367
Have a good night.

537
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,100
-Okay.
-See you Monday.

538
00:22:28,233 --> 00:22:29,367
Yep.

539
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,166
What a great guy, huh?

540
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:55,367
Bradley Duncan,
Damian Wenzel.

541
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,000
Hmm.

542
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,567
Um, should I just make
some more?

543
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,033
Because it doesn't look like
we'll have enough for the tree.

544
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,867
You know what this weekend is,
right?

545
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,166
The next Cavaliers game.

546
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,600
Oh! Yeah, Sunday night.

547
00:23:26,734 --> 00:23:29,166
That's great. But you know
what else it is?

548
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,333
It is the first weekend
of the craft fair.

549
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:32,767
And you know what that means?

550
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,867
We get to have our famous
Christmas card photo taken.

551
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
What? No, you promised last year
I'd never have to do it again.

552
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,667
Oh, come on.

553
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,433
Everybody loves to
get a Christmas card
with you and Santa.

554
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:46,166
Okay, this was the first one.

555
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,500
Aww!

556
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:48,867
Look at his little
chubby cheeks.

557
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,433
Okay, see this?
Look at that.

558
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,400
You wouldn't let go
of Santa's beard

559
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:57,000
and everybody was laughing.

560
00:23:57,133 --> 00:24:00,333
Oh, what a sweetheart.

561
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:02,133
Why don't I... why don't I bring
my camera over

562
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:05,100
and take a photo of you two guys
in front of the tree together?

563
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:07,467
Yes, that's a way better idea.

564
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,000
You know what? We can take
that picture

565
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:11,433
but for, you know, for
the Christmas card

566
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:13,567
I'd really like to stick
with our tradition.

567
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,133
Well he's 15, he's a...
a little old.

568
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:18,667
What if someone from school
sees him?

569
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,433
Exactly. It would take months
of therapy to get over that.

570
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:22,834
The tree is a perfect backdrop.

571
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:24,400
I vote for the tree.

572
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,500
You know, if you guys have
this handled,

573
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:32,900
I think I'm going to go make
some popcorn.

574
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:39,667
I'll talk to her.

575
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:48,066
I'm sorry for getting involved
in that.

576
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,166
I shouldn't have.

577
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,433
I want you to be involved,

578
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:55,133
I just don't like being
teamed up on.

579
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:59,500
But, you know, that's going
to happen, right?

580
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:01,033
I mean, if I take your side

581
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,000
then that's how Anthony's
going to feel.

582
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:05,800
And most of the time I'm going
to take your side.

583
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:08,333
You know, our picture
with Santa.

584
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,967
I know that it's silly
and it seems ridiculous

585
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,133
but it's always been
our Christmas tradition.

586
00:25:14,266 --> 00:25:15,734
I know.

587
00:25:15,867 --> 00:25:17,700
But he doesn't want to do it.

588
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:19,300
And since there are
so many things

589
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:21,233
that he doesn't want to do
that he has to do,

590
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:24,300
maybe you can let him
off the hook on this one.

591
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:26,467
You can't keep him
little forever.

592
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,300
Jeremy, I have three years
left with him.

593
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:31,800
Three years before he goes
off to college and,

594
00:25:31,934 --> 00:25:32,867
and everything changes.

595
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,066
And it just doesn't need
to change yet.

596
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,433
I don't want it to change yet.

597
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,033
his 20th wedding anniversary
last month.

598
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,967
Pictures were all over
social media.

599
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,133
That doesn't mean he couldn't
have written the card.

600
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:07,734
He married his
high school sweetheart.

601
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:10,200
Oh, okay. Yeah, that does
rule him out.

602
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,300
But it means the search
continues.

603
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:14,867
No, I am getting carried away.

604
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,734
I don't think I should do
this anymore.

605
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:17,567
Let's talk about you.

606
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,967
All right.

607
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,867
Um, what are you going to get
Anthony for Christmas?

608
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,300
Well, I was going to get him
a guitar

609
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:23,500
but apparently he told Jeremy

610
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:25,200
that he wants to go to
snowboarding camp.

611
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,066
Well, that sounds fun though.

612
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,400
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

613
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:29,533
Here we are.
Reggie's exhibit.

614
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,133
What? No.

615
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:32,867
I thought we just agreed that I
wasn't going to do this anymore.

616
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,967
No, we did not agree to that.

617
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,133
This isn't a good idea.

618
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:37,734
I think this is a great idea.

619
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:39,400
In fact, I think that he
probably wrote the card

620
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:41,400
because he's artistic.

621
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,066
Just let the conversation
flow naturally.

622
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,967
You're not 17-year-old Nicky.

623
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,567
You are successful,

624
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,367
well-adjusted
adult Nicky, right?

625
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,667
I feel like the first thing.

626
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,333
Oh, come on.

627
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:57,233
Thank you so much.

628
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,967
I'll have it delivered tomorrow.

629
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,867
Okay, take care.

630
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:07,066
Um, your favorite season
must be summer.

631
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,467
Well, I... I find the winter
scenes tend to sell

632
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,066
a little better during
the holidays.

633
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,900
Oh, that makes sense.
Yeah. Of course.

634
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:14,300
Yeah.

635
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:17,300
Uh, I really like the interplay
of light in this one.

636
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:19,233
Yeah, it's... it's subtle.

637
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:21,700
I'm surprised you picked up
on that. Thank you.

638
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:23,734
You're welcome.

639
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:28,567
I'm a big fan of
the luminicsm style.

640
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,867
You know art?

641
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
A little.

642
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,900
What's your favorite period?

643
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:36,133
Um... a favorite?

644
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:37,600
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

645
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:39,433
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,
if I had to pick a favorite

646
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:45,133
I guess it would be, it could be
the ro... coco. The ro-

647
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:46,600
-The Rococo.
-The Rococo style.

648
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:48,266
-Yeah.
-Yeah same. Yeah, it's great.

649
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,567
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it is great.

650
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,567
I mean, what I love about it
is how it's so...

651
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:55,500
Artistic.

652
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,367
Yeah, it is. Yeah.

653
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,567
Excuse me. Hi.

654
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,100
I think that gentleman
over there

655
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:02,934
has been trying to get
your attention.

656
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:04,033
Yeah him.

657
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,000
-Okay, excuse me.
-Sure.

658
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:07,100
Psst.

659
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,533
What are you doing?

660
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,500
Trying to find
something in common with him.

661
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:14,000
He doesn't even know
who I am.

662
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:15,834
I don't even
know who you are either.

663
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:17,967
Just... just be
a normal person.

664
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,333
Just breathe in and out,
deep breath.

665
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:21,100
And out.

666
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:22,867
You're foxy.

667
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,467
Okay.

668
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:33,467
Oh, hey, um, you know
what I just realized?

669
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,934
I think we know each other.

670
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:37,300
That maybe we went to
high school together.

671
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:39,600
I'm Nicky Beaton.

672
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:42,133
Oh, that's right.

673
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:44,200
Yeah. You were valedictorian,
right?

674
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,333
Yeah. Yeah, I was.

675
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:48,533
It's nice to see you again.

676
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:50,266
How have you been?

677
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,467
I've been great, uh,
thank you.

678
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,867
Yeah.

679
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,300
I'm here just visiting my
parents for the holidays.

680
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:57,867
I live in New York now.

681
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,667
No way. I... I just spent three
years on the Upper West Side.

682
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,000
Really?

683
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:03,667
-Yeah, I loved it.
-I love it too, yeah. Excellent.

684
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,667
I'm at 86th and Broadway.

685
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,266
-Oh, so nice.
-Yeah.

686
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,600
I'm actually just about
to move to Paris.

687
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:12,400
That is the home of
the Rococo...coco coco.

688
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:15,066
-Right.
-Yeah.

689
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,433
It's famous.

690
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:18,033
Yeah. I've... I've just always
wanted to live there

691
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:20,600
and I figured why not
give it a shot

692
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:22,066
rather than wonder
"what if?"

693
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,600
Yeah.

694
00:29:23,734 --> 00:29:25,500
Yeah, those what-if's
will kill you.

695
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:26,533
Yeah.

696
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:32,533
I, um, I wish that I had known
you were in New York.

697
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:33,900
Why, would you have
looked me up?

698
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,900
You didn't even remember me.

699
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:39,266
I didn't recognize you.
There's a big difference.

700
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,233
I remember, I remember
a lot of things about you

701
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:44,400
from high school.

702
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,934
We definitely had chemistry.

703
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:50,600
I thought so too. You know,
I really thought that-

704
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:53,200
It was the hardest class
that I've ever taken.

705
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,433
And I remember you got
straight A's.

706
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:59,400
That class was hard.

707
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:01,200
Mrs. Epp, she was so tough.

708
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,533
I was always...

709
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:05,567
I was always envious of
how easy that was for you.

710
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,333
I would study for hours
every night

711
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:10,400
and I could not get better
than a B.

712
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:11,834
You were envious of me?

713
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:12,867
Oh, yeah.

714
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,500
You're good at everything.

715
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:16,233
Weren't you on
the basketball team?

716
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:18,734
Yeah, until I blew my knee out
during the summer.

717
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:20,266
Oh.

718
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Yeah, I didn't play at a single
varsity game after that, so.

719
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:26,700
Wait, you didn't play against
Mountain Point our junior year?

720
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:30,266
Uh, nope. Why?

721
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,333
No reason.

722
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,000
Wait, wait, wait!
Your mom.

723
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:42,834
Hi guys.

724
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:43,834
Hey.

725
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,266
You finish up, okay?

726
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,433
I'll help her.

727
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:49,200
Thanks, love you.

728
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,233
Good to see you.

729
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:51,066
Mwah.

730
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,266
You too.

731
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,934
Hey kiddo.

732
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:54,834
How was practice?

733
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:55,834
Good.

734
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:57,233
Nice.

735
00:30:57,367 --> 00:30:58,900
Hey, do you think I could
go over to Chad's tonight?

736
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:00,600
Why don't you have him
come over here?

737
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,000
I could make you a big pot
of spaghetti

738
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:03,333
with the pink sauce you like.

739
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:05,433
I... I think he's looking after
his little sister

740
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:07,633
so, we have to study there.

741
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:09,433
Sure. Next time.

742
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,233
I'll go call him.

743
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:11,567
Okay.

744
00:31:16,934 --> 00:31:18,667
Yeah, of course.
I will just...

745
00:31:22,934 --> 00:31:23,900
Come on.

746
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:28,233
-Hi.
-Hey sweetie, how was it?

747
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:29,800
Oh, it was super fun.

748
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:32,133
It was really nice catching up
with Reggie

749
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:34,967
but he definitely did not
write the card.

750
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,967
So, I haven't made any progress
with that.

751
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,133
But I did find lots of fun stuff
at the craft fair.

752
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:41,467
Well, he may not have written
the note,

753
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,533
but whoever did is left-handed.

754
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,433
How do you know that?

755
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:48,633
I might have done a little
sleuthing online last night.

756
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:49,734
Here, let me show you.

757
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,066
Have you got the card?

758
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,900
Oh um, yes, of course.
Yeah, I have it right here.

759
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,700
See, people who are left-handed
cross their T's

760
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,333
from right to left,
not left to right.

761
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:07,900
So, it looks like this.

762
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:10,734
Wow, yeah. I can see
what you're saying.

763
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:12,033
That's great Mom,
thank you.

764
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,233
Jessica Fletcher has nothing
on your mom.

765
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:16,200
Yeah.

766
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:19,400
-Okay, so... well hey.
-Hi.

767
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:22,166
All right, so what do you
guys think?

768
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,066
Two bedrooms, two baths,
upgraded kitchen.

769
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,400
-I love it.
-Yeah.

770
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:27,000
Are you looking
at another house?

771
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:30,667
Derrick wanted us to look at one
more before we made our offer.

772
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,233
It does have everything
we want.

773
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,834
Yeah. I mean, it's my listing

774
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:35,633
but it's not officially on the
market till after Christmas, so.

775
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,667
You have photos?
I'd love to see it.

776
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:44,200
Oh, it's beautiful Mom.
I love it.

777
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,834
Isn't that Jeremy's place?

778
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:50,934
Uh-huh.

779
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:58,633
e news.

780
00:32:58,767 --> 00:32:59,900
Uh-oh. What?

781
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,533
It's not bad news.

782
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,266
Well, when you have good news
you say you have "good news,"

783
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,767
when you have bad news,
you say you have "some news."

784
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,433
Well, Mom's coming on Thursday.

785
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:09,500
On the 23rd?
Okay, okay.

786
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:11,600
Well, it still gives me time
to prepare for her

787
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:13,633
and, you know, make sure
everything is just as
she likes it.

788
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:15,266
This coming Thursday.

789
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,700
What?!
No, no, no, no, no, no.

790
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:18,834
Your brother has a party
on the 18th, remember?

791
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:20,266
Tasha's parents are flying in.

792
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,667
And you know how mom feels
about Tasha's mom.

793
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,266
Yeah.

794
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,533
Exactly how she feels
about me.

795
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:28,600
Not even close. She despises
Tasha's mom.

796
00:33:28,734 --> 00:33:30,166
Mm-hmm.

797
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,667
Look, with the wedding coming up

798
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,834
I think it's a good opportunity
for her to spend some time

799
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:35,800
getting to know you
a little better.

800
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,834
Let her teach you how
to bake a ham.

801
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:41,433
I know how to bake a ham!

802
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:43,166
Well, pretend you don't.

803
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,100
It... that worked for Tasha!

804
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,834
Seriously?

805
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:49,600
Listen, I know that my mom
can be somewhat opinionated.

806
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:51,166
Uh-huh.

807
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,600
I want you to feel good about
your soon-to-be mother-in-law.

808
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,133
It will mean something to me.

809
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:03,000
So, covering a ham keeps it
from drying out?

810
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:04,500
That's fascinating!

811
00:34:04,633 --> 00:34:06,800
But we may want to reign it
in, you know, just a little.

812
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:09,533
No. I just want to see it.

813
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:12,066
She's been my best friend
since I was five years old.

814
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,834
I know, I know. And that's
precisely why

815
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:15,333
I don't want to show you
the house, okay?

816
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:16,767
Oh, you can trust me.

817
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,934
I promise you I'm not going
to say anything to Simone.

818
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:22,667
Besides, Christmas spirit.
Please help this man see sense.

819
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
Okay, fine.

820
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:28,834
Yeah, you can't argue
with the Christmas spirit.

821
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:29,600
Yeah, well...

822
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,734
Are you driving?

823
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:32,233
Uh, it's kind of my car.

824
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:33,367
Fantastic.

825
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:43,400
Are you serious?
This is it?

826
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:44,900
Simone loves this house.

827
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:46,433
I know. I know she does.

828
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:47,834
And Jeremy says
they always drive by

829
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:49,033
every time they're
in the neighborhood.

830
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:50,233
Yeah.

831
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:51,734
I figured, you know,
why don't we find out

832
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:53,834
if the owners want to sell,
so I put a note on the door.

833
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,266
And it was just that easy?

834
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,900
Well, I wouldn't say
it was that easy.

835
00:34:57,033 --> 00:34:58,066
First time they called me

836
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,400
they said that they
weren't interested.

837
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:01,066
But then after that snowstorm
we had in October

838
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,900
they called me again
and they said,

839
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:04,266
"You know, we've had
a change of heart.

840
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,500
"I think we're going
to move to Phoenix."

841
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,900
So, I said "Okay, well I'll show
you some listings."

842
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:10,567
And I negotiated the sale.

843
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,800
Wow, you're really good at this.

844
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:13,000
I don't know about that.

845
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:17,133
I think there might be
someone here.

846
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:18,867
Well, I hope it's Jeremy.

847
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:26,800
Hey man. How's it going?

848
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:29,133
Hey, hey, listen.
Are you at the new house?

849
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:30,433
No, no.

850
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:32,900
Because we just heard,
uh, a noise inside.

851
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:34,133
I hired a plumber

852
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,834
but he's not going to be there
until next week.

853
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,333
-Well...
-Okay hey, hang tight, okay?

854
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:38,633
I'll be there in five minutes.

855
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:40,000
All right buddy, thanks.

856
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,600
Hey hon.
Uh, what are you doing?

857
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:46,600
Um, uh...

858
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:48,567
Anthony, Anthony
forgot something

859
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,567
and he needs me to bring it
to him.

860
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,800
Really? Why didn't he call me?

861
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:55,133
Because the thing he needs
is in my truck,

862
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:57,467
and so, I'm just going
to run it over to him.

863
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,767
I'll get my coat, and on the way
back we can go to Damian's.

864
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,667
I really like those
hot chocolate cupcakes.

865
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

866
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:04,333
No.

867
00:36:04,467 --> 00:36:06,533
You, you...

868
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,834
Tell you what, okay?
You stay here, okay?

869
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:13,500
And I'll get the muffins
and a latte,

870
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:16,000
and I'll... I'll be back soon.

871
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,133
Oh, there's definitely someone
in there.

872
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:27,500
-Yeah, come on.
-What?

873
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:28,700
-Let's take a look.
-Don't you think it's dangerous?

874
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:30,467
This is Marsden Ohio Nicky,
not New York.

875
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,734
-I'm sure we're fine.
-Okay.

876
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:33,967
No, no, no, but maybe we
don't want...

877
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,333
Shhh!

878
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,066
Anthony!

879
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,700
Hi. Can you help?
This is kinda heavy.

880
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:47,300
I got it, I got it, I got it.

881
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:48,233
Oh.

882
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,500
Are you okay?

883
00:36:51,633 --> 00:36:52,834
What are you doing?

884
00:36:52,967 --> 00:36:54,667
I wanted there to be a tree
in the new house

885
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,066
when we surprised mom.

886
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,533
The guy said it should just
screw into the stand

887
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,300
but it keeps falling over.

888
00:37:00,433 --> 00:37:02,367
Wait, you brought this tree
in yourself?

889
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,367
One of the seniors on my team
has a car.

890
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,200
But there's still two weeks
till Christmas

891
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,633
so, I hope it doesn't die.

892
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,633
Anthony trust me,
it'll be just fine.

893
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:12,200
Does anyone know
you're here?

894
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,266
They think I'm at a friend's.

895
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,433
Anthony!

896
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,133
What? How else could I keep
it a surprise?

897
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:18,266
Well, Jeremy's on his way.

898
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,467
You called him?

899
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,800
Of course, I called him.

900
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,567
Come on.

901
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,233
Wait, what are you two
doing here?

902
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:26,600
Oh, I asked Derrick to bring me.

903
00:37:26,734 --> 00:37:27,867
I want to check out
your new house.

904
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,133
You weren't supposed
to say anything.

905
00:37:29,266 --> 00:37:29,867
I know. I know.

906
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,033
Come on, we had a pact.

907
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,100
Buddy, I'm sorry,
but I just- it slipped.

908
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:34,934
I'm not going to ruin it,
I promise.

909
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,133
All right.

910
00:37:37,266 --> 00:37:39,200
I really like your tree.
Your mom's going to love it.

911
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:42,600
You brought in all
these decorations.

912
00:37:42,734 --> 00:37:44,767
I don't know, I...

913
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,433
I don't think I have enough.

914
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,367
Hmm, really?

915
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,333
Maybe I can help you
with that.

916
00:37:57,433 --> 00:38:00,333
Derrick, these candles are real.

917
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:01,800
Yeah, they lived a lot
more dangerously

918
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:03,133
in the Victorian age.

919
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:06,800
How do you know
about this place?

920
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:08,934
Well, this store's been here
for about six years.

921
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:11,300
Yeah, Genevieve the owner,
started it in Connecticut,

922
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:13,200
and when she moved here
she brought it with her so.

923
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,533
I actually hire her sometimes
to stage the homes I'm selling.

924
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,700
This is a mid-century modern.

925
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:19,934
Wow.

926
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:22,667
That over there would be
Pennsylvania Dutch.

927
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,467
Oh, here we go. This is what
we want right here.

928
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,033
Oh.

929
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:27,200
Look, bubble lights.

930
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,266
Yeah.

931
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,767
These were popular in the '40s

932
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,433
when they were introduced
all the way up into the '80s.

933
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:32,800
You know what?
Tell me what you think.

934
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:34,100
I thought this might be
kind of cool

935
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:35,367
to decorate Simone's new home

936
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,100
the way she was
when she was a kid.

937
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:38,100
What do you think?

938
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:38,934
-She'll love that.
-Yeah.

939
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,100
It's a great idea.

940
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:41,000
It's a bit like going back
in time, right?

941
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:42,333
Yeah, it really is.

942
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,133
How do you know all this stuff
about time periods

943
00:38:44,266 --> 00:38:45,767
and Christmas?

944
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,000
I mean, it's not like that's
a course they teach

945
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:49,300
in real estate school, right?

946
00:38:49,433 --> 00:38:50,834
Uh yeah. No, no.

947
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:54,166
Actually, my... my ex-wife
was an interior designer

948
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,834
so, I learned it from her.

949
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,100
I, uh, didn't know you were
divorced, I'm sorry.

950
00:38:58,233 --> 00:39:00,734
No, no, no, don't be sorry.
It's for the best.

951
00:39:00,867 --> 00:39:02,600
Six years ago,
we both realized

952
00:39:02,734 --> 00:39:04,500
we were not as compatible
as we thought.

953
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,033
Right.

954
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:07,834
Um, do you want a coffee?

955
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:08,700
-Sure, yeah.
-Yeah.

956
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:10,433
-Two.
-Thank you.

957
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:11,767
Why do we do that?

958
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,900
Fall for the person
that's totally wrong for us?

959
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:15,667
I don't know, it's um...

960
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,767
For me personally,

961
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,500
Jess and I just... we just
weren't friends, you know?

962
00:39:21,633 --> 00:39:23,233
I really believe that you can't
love someone

963
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:25,400
if you can't ask yourself you
like them in the first place.

964
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:26,333
You know what I mean?

965
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:27,533
Yeah.

966
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:29,367
Yeah, that's really perceptive.

967
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,533
Yeah. Well, I had a lot of time
to think about it, so.

968
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:36,867
So, um, well what about you?

969
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,834
I mean, married, divorced?
It's complicated?

970
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:43,200
Single, single and single.

971
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:44,433
Oh.

972
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:45,934
You know, I guess I'm just
working on myself

973
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:49,100
so, I can be the right partner
for someone else.

974
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:50,367
Mm.

975
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,000
That sounds like a little bit
of an excuse.

976
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:56,200
It actually sounds like
that parable of that writer.

977
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:57,700
What do you mean?

978
00:39:57,834 --> 00:39:58,834
Well, she's the perfect author

979
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:00,700
who never sends out
her manuscript.

980
00:40:00,834 --> 00:40:03,033
And as long as she keeps
working on it

981
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:06,166
she'll never have to feel
any rejection.

982
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,533
I send out my manuscript.

983
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,200
Sometimes it just gets lost
in the mail.

984
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,000
Oh, yeah.

985
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:12,166
But you said you don't.

986
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,400
You said you don't,
you're not confident

987
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:16,600
you'd be a good partner.

988
00:40:16,734 --> 00:40:19,834
No, no. You're just twisting
my words.

989
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:22,867
I think you might be a little
afraid of rejection.

990
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,533
Ah.

991
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:33,633
I'll just uh, yeah.

992
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,367
Can you believe that he actually
said that to me?

993
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,266
Like I'm afraid of rejection?

994
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,300
Please.

995
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:45,600
Well, you kind of are though,
right?

996
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,133
What?

997
00:40:47,266 --> 00:40:49,133
I'm not saying that you don't
take risks because obviously

998
00:40:49,266 --> 00:40:51,867
starting up your own consulting
business was a huge risk.

999
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,967
But, I think, Derrick's right,

1000
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,700
when it comes to
your personal life,

1001
00:40:55,834 --> 00:40:58,633
if you think that somebody's
going to reject you,
you back away.

1002
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:02,934
I love you and you know me
better than anyone,

1003
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:04,834
but I think you are
way off base here.

1004
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:06,800
All right. Well then, come
to the Christmas party

1005
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:08,800
with Jeremy and me
on Wednesday.

1006
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:10,867
Okay fine. I would love to.
Thank you.

1007
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,433
Fine.

1008
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:14,500
My last few hours of freedom
before Jeremy's mom gets here.

1009
00:41:14,633 --> 00:41:16,867
Oh.

1010
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,266
Hey. Maybe some of those guys on
the list will be at that party

1011
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,700
and I can finally figure out who
wrote me that Christmas card.

1012
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:23,266
That's a great idea.

1013
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,000
All right. It's at Yvette
Tipton's house.

1014
00:41:27,133 --> 00:41:29,700
Yvette Tipton?
The cheerleader?

1015
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:32,467
That was 20 years ago.
She owns a hair salon now.

1016
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,433
Well...

1017
00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:35,633
People move on Nik, right?

1018
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:39,000
They've had some bumps
in their lives too.

1019
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:41,133
Right. Of course.

1020
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:42,467
Good.

1021
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,767
Okay.

1022
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,166
But you're going to have
to pick me up

1023
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,600
because my parents have
the car that night.

1024
00:41:46,734 --> 00:41:47,967
Sure.

1025
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,000
Do you have a curfew?

1026
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,867
Really lovely, yeah.
Yeah, beautiful.

1027
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,767
-And here we are ladies.
-Oh hi.

1028
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,333
-Christmas cranberry coolers.
-Lovely.

1029
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:04,734
I hope they're made correctly.

1030
00:42:04,867 --> 00:42:06,100
You know, it's been a while
since I was a bartender.

1031
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,100
I'm sure they're great.
Thank you.

1032
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:09,066
All right.

1033
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,734
Cheers.

1034
00:42:09,867 --> 00:42:11,200
Yes. To the search.

1035
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:12,600
Mmm.

1036
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:14,433
Ooh, these are very good.

1037
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:15,667
Yeah.

1038
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,867
Oh, there's Derrick.
You could talk to him.

1039
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:21,867
No? Okay.

1040
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,166
Hey wait.
Is that Treyton?

1041
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,734
Which one was he again?

1042
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:27,567
Remember, the really cute one.
He could've written the card.

1043
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,400
Yeah. Yeah, he could've.

1044
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:31,667
-I'm going to ask.
-Do it.

1045
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,433
-Okay.
-You got this.

1046
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:36,333
-Okay, okay.
-Okay.

1047
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:39,033
-I'm doing it. It's happening.
-Okay.

1048
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:43,200
Nicky Beaton?

1049
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,066
Hi.

1050
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,367
Merry Christmas.

1051
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,333
You look fantastic.
You haven't changed a bit.

1052
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:48,667
Well, I don't know about that.

1053
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,900
I've definitely changed
a little.

1054
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:51,934
But you look exactly the same,
Treyton.

1055
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:53,533
Well thanks.
I do my best.

1056
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:55,100
How long has it been?

1057
00:42:55,233 --> 00:42:57,266
Last time I saw you
was at graduation.

1058
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,500
That's probably right.

1059
00:42:58,633 --> 00:43:00,667
Yeah, yeah. I remember
the speech you gave.

1060
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,233
I remember it too.

1061
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:04,433
The one where you sang a song
about following your dreams

1062
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:06,266
and discovering who you
truly are.

1063
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,800
Yeah. Yvette.

1064
00:43:07,934 --> 00:43:11,567
Oh, I felt so bad when everyone
started laughing at your song.

1065
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,567
I didn't laugh.
It was inspiring.

1066
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,667
But it was no surprise

1067
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,567
you'd come up with something
like that.

1068
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,934
Thank you.

1069
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:20,266
Oh, well, I... I didn't mean
that everyone laughed.

1070
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,934
I mean, besides... I could never
even give a speech

1071
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,600
in front of that many people,
so.

1072
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,433
Well, at least it was memorable,
right?

1073
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,633
Yes, it was.

1074
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:29,467
Feel free to help yourselves
to the hors d'oeuvres.

1075
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,667
We have vegan, vegetarian
and fruititarian options.

1076
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,066
Oh, great.

1077
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,900
And I should circulate.

1078
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,767
Okay.

1079
00:43:40,633 --> 00:43:41,600
Thank you for saying that.

1080
00:43:41,734 --> 00:43:44,100
That was really,
really nice of you.

1081
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:46,033
I meant every word.

1082
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:50,567
Treyton, can I ask you
a really weird question?

1083
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,567
If you don't mind
a weird answer.

1084
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,734
I don't mind.

1085
00:43:54,867 --> 00:43:56,300
It's about a Christmas card.

1086
00:43:56,433 --> 00:44:00,500
That is it. No more work calls,
phone is off.

1087
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:01,867
This is Nicky, a friend
from high school.

1088
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,200
Nicky, this is my fiancÃ©,
Richard.

1089
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,333
Hey, nice to meet you.

1090
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:05,734
It's really nice to meet you.
Hi.

1091
00:44:05,867 --> 00:44:08,233
Nicky was just inquiring
about a Christmas card?

1092
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:10,533
Yeah, yeah.

1093
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:14,467
Um, I was just... I was going
to ask if you had written me

1094
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,200
this romantic Christmas card
in high school.

1095
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:19,467
Not unless your name
was Jeffrey.

1096
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:25,333
Okay. Well, do you mind if I,
um, show it to you?

1097
00:44:25,467 --> 00:44:28,066
Maybe you would recognize
the handwriting.

1098
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,900
It's definitely someone we went
to school with.

1099
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:32,700
No.

1100
00:44:32,834 --> 00:44:33,900
But listen, I'm not surprised

1101
00:44:34,033 --> 00:44:35,900
someone would write you
something like that.

1102
00:44:36,033 --> 00:44:39,533
You're always complimenting
people and lifting them up.

1103
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:41,000
Thank you.

1104
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:41,967
Wow.

1105
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,500
Well...

1106
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:46,133
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1107
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,300
To you both, and congratulations
to you both.

1108
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:50,633
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1109
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,266
Okay.

1110
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,967
-Okay. This is not going well.
-Talk to me.

1111
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:01,266
-Definitely not.
-All right.

1112
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,700
He was really sweet-

1113
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:05,367
So, look who I found.

1114
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,133
Hey.

1115
00:45:06,266 --> 00:45:07,066
Hi. Derrick.

1116
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,400
-Hi.
-Hi.

1117
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:09,900
Simone, Andrea's here.

1118
00:45:10,033 --> 00:45:11,266
Oh, right.

1119
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,967
I have to talk to her
about the flower order.

1120
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:13,934
-Really?
-Yep.

1121
00:45:14,066 --> 00:45:15,033
Okay.

1122
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:16,633
-Okay. We'll see you in a bit.
-Bye.

1123
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:22,934
Uh, listen Nicky,

1124
00:45:23,066 --> 00:45:24,934
I hope I didn't offend you
with what I said about you

1125
00:45:25,066 --> 00:45:27,433
not sending your manuscript out
I just that conversation...

1126
00:45:27,567 --> 00:45:30,033
No. No, not at all actually.

1127
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:32,800
You gave me something
to think about and...

1128
00:45:32,934 --> 00:45:34,233
and I appreciate that.

1129
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:36,567
You're right. I do need to
put myself out there more.

1130
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,600
-So, thank you.
-You're welcome.

1131
00:45:38,734 --> 00:45:40,367
I mean, look at you, you're
here, you're at this party.

1132
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,567
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

1133
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,800
Manuscript published.

1134
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,567
Manuscript published,
that's good.

1135
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,467
Did you see the hors d'oeuvres?

1136
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,300
-Woah.
-A little like, scary.

1137
00:45:50,433 --> 00:45:51,100
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1138
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:52,266
Slightly.

1139
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,266
It's like everybody
that knows Yvette

1140
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,734
is either on a starvation diet

1141
00:45:54,867 --> 00:45:56,133
or they're allergic to food
that actually tastes good.

1142
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,600
I think it might be both.

1143
00:45:59,734 --> 00:46:01,200
Yeah, you're probably right.

1144
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,633
Listen, you want to um,
you want to bail

1145
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:11,700
and go have ourselves some,
some real Christmas fare?

1146
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:13,367
I'd like that.

1147
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,500
I'm actually starving.

1148
00:46:15,633 --> 00:46:16,467
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1149
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,433
Me too. Who knew?

1150
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:24,767
Mexican?

1151
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,433
Well, you know, nothing says
Christmas like a great tamale

1152
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:27,367
in my opinion.

1153
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,867
Well, thank you for leaving
to bring me here.

1154
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
It was my pleasure.

1155
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:35,834
You know, I overheard Yvette
say something

1156
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:38,934
about a graduation speech?

1157
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:40,266
Yeah.

1158
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,967
Well, as you probably gathered
it was a disaster.

1159
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:43,767
You sang?

1160
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:46,467
-Derrick.
-Hi.

1161
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,467
I have your table ready.

1162
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,800
Thank you very much.

1163
00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:50,266
Is there no one in this town
that you don't know?

1164
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,934
Well, I found her a terrific
little bungalow

1165
00:46:52,066 --> 00:46:53,367
down on Riverside.

1166
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,500
You stop trying to change
the subject.

1167
00:46:56,633 --> 00:46:57,533
Fine.

1168
00:46:57,667 --> 00:46:59,300
I didn't start singing,
you know,

1169
00:46:59,433 --> 00:47:01,433
it was just a traditional speech

1170
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:03,767
about closing one chapter
and opening another one.

1171
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,233
And I had written this song

1172
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:08,667
which is weird because I can't
even read music.

1173
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,867
And in a complete lapse
in judgment

1174
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,400
I, I just decided to sing it.

1175
00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:14,867
Just like that, like right there
in the moment.

1176
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,834
Yeah.

1177
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,100
Off the cuff and acapella.

1178
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:19,834
Okay. Wow.

1179
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:23,500
See, in my mind, it was going
to be really touching

1180
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:26,934
and it was going to bring
people to tears.

1181
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:30,233
But, in reality, it brought
people to, you know,

1182
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:34,200
tears of laughter after
a very awkward silence.

1183
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,867
Okay. So... so what did you do?

1184
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,767
I stopped singing.

1185
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:37,767
Uh-huh.

1186
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,066
And then I just rushed
off stage.

1187
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,033
Ouch.

1188
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,367
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1189
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,266
In high school nobody knew
who I was.

1190
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,500
Right.

1191
00:47:46,633 --> 00:47:48,367
Unless you went to like,
a math competition.

1192
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,667
And when they asked me
to do the graduation speech

1193
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,400
I just thought this was
my chance.

1194
00:47:52,533 --> 00:47:53,700
Mm-hmm.

1195
00:47:53,834 --> 00:47:55,600
You know, for my classmates
to really know me.

1196
00:47:55,734 --> 00:47:57,100
Right.

1197
00:47:57,233 --> 00:47:58,367
I put all this pressure on
myself to make it really good

1198
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,166
and it just wasn't.

1199
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,400
You know? It wasn't that good.

1200
00:48:02,533 --> 00:48:07,233
And about halfway through it,
it came to me that I could,

1201
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:09,000
that I could sing that song.

1202
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,266
And I did.

1203
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,967
And I humiliated myself.

1204
00:48:17,867 --> 00:48:21,900
Well... I will tell you that
on the humiliation scale

1205
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:23,734
I'll give you a nine,
nine-and-a-half.

1206
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:25,333
-Well, thank you.
-You're welcome.

1207
00:48:25,467 --> 00:48:27,900
But I got a solid 10.

1208
00:48:28,033 --> 00:48:29,000
-What?
-Yeah.

1209
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,567
All right, let's hear it.

1210
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,767
What do you mean,
like right now?

1211
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:34,767
Yes.

1212
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,900
I just poured my heart out
to you.

1213
00:48:37,033 --> 00:48:38,967
I just gotta make sure no one
was in my high school here.

1214
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,433
Okay. Alright.
Here it goes.

1215
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:42,633
Um, when I was in high school

1216
00:48:42,767 --> 00:48:43,967
I was on the debate team,
right?

1217
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,300
So, one night before
this big debate

1218
00:48:46,433 --> 00:48:48,600
I decide I'm going to go home,
I'm going to stay up all night,

1219
00:48:48,734 --> 00:48:50,100
I'm going to study,

1220
00:48:50,233 --> 00:48:51,300
I'm going to be super prepared
and obviously very tired.

1221
00:48:51,433 --> 00:48:52,333
Mm-hmm.

1222
00:48:52,467 --> 00:48:54,000
The next day when I got
to the debate,

1223
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:57,967
Nicky, I was so exhausted.
I fell asleep.

1224
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,767
And you snored?

1225
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,400
Uh, no. Worse.
Yeah, way worse.

1226
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:05,200
I had a dream about my mom.

1227
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:06,834
And in my dream
while I was sleeping,

1228
00:49:06,967 --> 00:49:08,633
I said "I love you too, Mom."

1229
00:49:08,767 --> 00:49:11,967
The whole auditorium
heard me say it. Everyone.

1230
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,000
Yeah, boom.

1231
00:49:13,133 --> 00:49:14,400
The next day I walk down
the hallway

1232
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:15,967
and everybody's looking at me
going "I love you son!"

1233
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,567
I mean, it was brutal.
It was like...

1234
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,166
I was like "Oh my.
This is the worst."

1235
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,834
No, that is
the worst, that is actually.

1236
00:49:22,967 --> 00:49:24,000
I was just hiding
in the back...

1237
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:25,300
-Hey!
-What is this?

1238
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:27,333
This is pozole.

1239
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:28,367
Wow.

1240
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,166
When I was growing up in Mexico

1241
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,967
this is what we would have
after coming home

1242
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,533
from caroling on Nochebuena,
Christmas Eve.

1243
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:36,400
Oh.

1244
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,633
It's good for the voice
after singing.

1245
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,834
Oh, perfect for Nicky.

1246
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,000
Thank you, Elvira.

1247
00:49:44,133 --> 00:49:45,300
-Enjoy.
-Thank you so much.

1248
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:46,967
Provecho. Thank you.

1249
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,467
All right.

1250
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,967
Well, after those two stories
I think I'll make a toast.

1251
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,800
To being humiliated
in high school.

1252
00:49:54,934 --> 00:49:56,567
I'll drink to that.

1253
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,734
Don't mind if I do.

1254
00:50:38,867 --> 00:50:40,667
Ah, ah, ah!
Hands off.

1255
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,266
Not until Miriam has the first
one and then you get three max.

1256
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,700
Ugh. So many rules.

1257
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:48,066
Yeah. That's the way it is.

1258
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,900
Now, Miriam lives
in a perfect house,

1259
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:53,100
so, for the next two weeks
we are going to pretend

1260
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:54,934
that's the way we live too.

1261
00:50:55,066 --> 00:50:56,567
Don't you want Miriam
to see the real us?

1262
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,000
Hmm?

1263
00:50:58,133 --> 00:51:00,567
And don't call her that.
Not unless she says it's okay.

1264
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,166
It's Mrs. Winters, huh?

1265
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,333
Oh, that's her.

1266
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:11,367
Here we go.

1267
00:51:12,533 --> 00:51:14,300
Miriam, hi.
Come on in.

1268
00:51:14,433 --> 00:51:15,767
Grandma M.

1269
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,967
You must be Anthony.

1270
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:22,400
Jeremy told me you're a pretty
decent point guard.

1271
00:51:22,533 --> 00:51:24,734
Maybe even better
than he is.

1272
00:51:24,867 --> 00:51:27,100
Hardly. He destroyed me
the other day on the court.

1273
00:51:28,567 --> 00:51:30,667
Don't worry, sweetheart.
He'll age out soon enough.

1274
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,000
We are so happy that
you decided to come early.

1275
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,734
I didn't have much of a choice.

1276
00:51:36,867 --> 00:51:38,934
Well, the roast
is almost finished

1277
00:51:39,066 --> 00:51:40,233
so why don't you make yourself
at home?

1278
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:41,967
Oh, good.

1279
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,700
You know, you have to cook it
right or it gets tough.

1280
00:51:48,467 --> 00:51:50,133
Everything is delicious, honey.

1281
00:51:50,266 --> 00:51:51,767
It really is.

1282
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,233
Thank you.

1283
00:51:53,367 --> 00:51:54,567
You wouldn't happen to have
a steak knife, would you?

1284
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,400
Oh sure, Mom.
Anthony?

1285
00:52:01,133 --> 00:52:05,467
So, Mom realized in the car
that she forgot the gifts

1286
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,300
that she was going to send
to Tasha and Jason.

1287
00:52:07,433 --> 00:52:10,066
I could just kick myself.

1288
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,700
Well, I'm sure
they wouldn't mind

1289
00:52:11,834 --> 00:52:13,567
receiving them
after the holidays.

1290
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,500
Actually, Mom wanted to buy
them something new to send,

1291
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,000
so, I thought that maybe
you could take her

1292
00:52:18,133 --> 00:52:21,400
to the craft fair on Sunday.

1293
00:52:21,533 --> 00:52:23,300
Uh, you know, honey...

1294
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:26,867
I would love to but Anthony's
game is on Sunday.

1295
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,033
Well, you can't miss that.
Jeremy will take me.

1296
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:32,633
No, I have to be there
to videotape it, remember?

1297
00:52:32,767 --> 00:52:34,333
Jeremy's making me
a highlight reel.

1298
00:52:34,467 --> 00:52:36,400
It's kind of a big deal.

1299
00:52:36,533 --> 00:52:37,867
You basically need one now
to get a scholarship.

1300
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,934
Yeah, you do.

1301
00:52:40,467 --> 00:52:41,567
Sure.

1302
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,567
Yeah, you two go to the game
on Sunday

1303
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,300
and Miriam and I
can go shopping.

1304
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:48,400
Great.

1305
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,567
Good.

1306
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,133
It really is.

1307
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:57,400
Oh no, Dave. Don't pack
the red tablecloth.

1308
00:52:57,533 --> 00:52:58,467
We'll need it for Christmas.

1309
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,100
Red tablecloth, check.

1310
00:53:00,233 --> 00:53:02,200
Mom, what's in this?

1311
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:03,600
Those are the extra decorations

1312
00:53:03,734 --> 00:53:05,700
you said you wanted
to look through?

1313
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:06,800
Oh.

1314
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:07,934
If you don't want
to deal with it now

1315
00:53:08,066 --> 00:53:10,033
we can just ship it
to New York.

1316
00:53:10,166 --> 00:53:12,600
No. Actually, if you don't mind

1317
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:15,133
I have someone I'd like
to donate these to.

1318
00:53:15,266 --> 00:53:16,633
Are you sure?

1319
00:53:16,767 --> 00:53:18,800
I have plenty of decorations
in my apartment in New York.

1320
00:53:18,934 --> 00:53:21,567
And really, I shouldn't be
holding on to a bunch of stuff

1321
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,000
that I don't even have room for.

1322
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,800
This is good quality.

1323
00:53:35,934 --> 00:53:39,400
Oh yes. Very, very good.
Very, very, very cute.

1324
00:53:39,533 --> 00:53:40,800
Perfect for Tasha.

1325
00:53:40,934 --> 00:53:41,633
Good.

1326
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:42,934
I'd get you some,

1327
00:53:43,066 --> 00:53:46,133
but I don't get the sense
that you cook much.

1328
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:48,967
Really? I cook all the time.

1329
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,367
Oh.

1330
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,266
Usually when I phone Jeremy
he says he can't talk

1331
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,033
because you're going out to eat

1332
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:58,100
and they won't hold
your reservation.

1333
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,700
Oh, thanks Jeremy.
Thank you.

1334
00:54:07,567 --> 00:54:09,133
...Come and take a picture.

1335
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,133
Is there any place
we can sit down here?

1336
00:54:23,266 --> 00:54:26,133
Oh, yes of course.
Just right over here.

1337
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:29,967
Maybe we could get some hot
chocolate or something to eat.

1338
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,767
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.

1339
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,667
-Glad you found a table.
-Mm-hmm.

1340
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,333
I must say that these
cinnamon rolls look so nice.

1341
00:54:39,467 --> 00:54:41,533
I might have to steal a bite.

1342
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:44,567
Oh, well, they certainly
are big enough for both of us.

1343
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,633
Hmm.

1344
00:54:48,133 --> 00:54:49,300
Okay.

1345
00:54:51,266 --> 00:54:53,166
Mm. Ours were better.

1346
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:57,200
Cinnamon rolls were a Christmas
staple at our house.

1347
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:58,600
Really?

1348
00:54:58,734 --> 00:55:01,867
When Jeremy was little he and I
used to get up 5:00 AM

1349
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,934
on Christmas Eve and bake,
oh, about four dozen.

1350
00:55:06,066 --> 00:55:07,600
And then we'd take
them around

1351
00:55:07,734 --> 00:55:09,166
to all our friends
and neighbors.

1352
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,600
That was sweet of you.

1353
00:55:10,734 --> 00:55:12,667
Mm, I miss those days.

1354
00:55:14,467 --> 00:55:16,967
Yeah. Me too.

1355
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:23,867
Anthony used to, he used to bake
with me when he was little.

1356
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,333
Anthony's at that age now

1357
00:55:25,467 --> 00:55:27,567
where he wants to do everything
on his own.

1358
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:33,900
Yeah. And that's okay.
You can't baby him forever.

1359
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:36,600
Well, I like to think that
wanting to be

1360
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:40,600
a part of my son's life
isn't babying him.

1361
00:55:40,734 --> 00:55:44,266
The worst thing a mother can do
is to hold on too tight.

1362
00:55:47,467 --> 00:55:48,967
You don't say.

1363
00:55:52,033 --> 00:55:53,834
It was all I could do
to remain civil.

1364
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:56,200
I mean, who is she to tell me
that I'm hanging on too tight.

1365
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:58,000
It's not like she's the most
amazing mother in the world.

1366
00:55:58,133 --> 00:55:59,767
Jeremy barely takes her calls
half the time.

1367
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,066
Well, maybe that's why
she's saying it,

1368
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,266
from experience, you know?

1369
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,567
She knows that she was
hanging on too tight

1370
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,333
and that that's why Jeremy
keeps his distance.

1371
00:56:06,467 --> 00:56:09,967
Yeah, but she's also overbearing
and she complains all the time.

1372
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,767
Look it's not about her, right?

1373
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,333
Yeah.

1374
00:56:13,467 --> 00:56:18,467
Maybe you have been holding on
too tight to Anthony lately.

1375
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,467
Don't you think?

1376
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,900
No, no I'm not.

1377
00:56:23,033 --> 00:56:24,433
I have three more years
with him.

1378
00:56:24,567 --> 00:56:25,800
Three, and then he's gone.

1379
00:56:25,934 --> 00:56:26,934
There is nothing wrong

1380
00:56:27,066 --> 00:56:29,333
with wanting to make
those years count.

1381
00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:30,900
Of course, there's not.

1382
00:56:31,033 --> 00:56:33,800
But you put so much pressure

1383
00:56:33,934 --> 00:56:35,633
on the time that you spend
with him.

1384
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,333
Trying to force these memories
to happen

1385
00:56:38,467 --> 00:56:40,667
instead of just letting them
happen naturally.

1386
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,000
Don't you think if you
relaxed a little,

1387
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:44,100
you and Anthony would have
more fun together?

1388
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:45,233
But there is no together.

1389
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:46,600
He doesn't want to spend time
with me.

1390
00:56:46,734 --> 00:56:48,400
He's always,
he's off with Jeremy

1391
00:56:48,533 --> 00:56:51,233
and they don't include me.

1392
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:55,400
You know, for years
he needed me.

1393
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:57,800
And now Jeremy comes
into the picture and he-

1394
00:56:57,934 --> 00:57:00,867
I just... I can't compete
with that.

1395
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,200
You don't have to compete.

1396
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:04,667
Listen to me,

1397
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,900
your son loves you more than
anything in the world.

1398
00:57:08,033 --> 00:57:11,166
And Jeremy loves you
just as much.

1399
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:16,700
So, maybe, you should think
about just taking a step back

1400
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:20,467
and letting them create a bond
with each other.

1401
00:57:22,533 --> 00:57:24,867
You know I figured you
of all people

1402
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,567
would understand
where I'm coming from.

1403
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,900
I do.

1404
00:57:31,433 --> 00:57:32,767
I don't think so.

1405
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:34,400
Simone.

1406
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,033
Thank you so much.

1407
00:57:54,066 --> 00:57:55,233
Hello?

1408
00:57:56,567 --> 00:57:58,700
Oh wow! This looks great.

1409
00:57:58,834 --> 00:57:59,767
Hey Nicky.

1410
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,100
You know what's funny?

1411
00:58:01,233 --> 00:58:02,433
Derrick was just talking
about you.

1412
00:58:02,567 --> 00:58:03,533
Oh?

1413
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:06,700
Actually, I mentioned
your parents.

1414
00:58:06,834 --> 00:58:08,767
Yeah. I just got off a call
with the seller's realtor.

1415
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,367
He accepted your parents' offer.

1416
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,867
That's fantastic!

1417
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,200
Oh wow!

1418
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:16,400
Can we go tell them right now?

1419
00:58:16,533 --> 00:58:17,867
Of course. Absolutely.

1420
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,834
Jeremy, you should tell her
about the party.

1421
00:58:19,967 --> 00:58:23,166
Oh yeah. Anthony thought it
might be fun to have some people

1422
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,100
over here on Christmas Eve
when we surprise Simone.

1423
00:58:26,233 --> 00:58:28,033
She would love that.
That's a great idea.

1424
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:30,266
Hey, you know,
maybe you can sing.

1425
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,934
I so regret telling you
that story.

1426
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:33,100
Okay.

1427
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:34,934
We'll be back in 20 max,
all right?

1428
00:58:35,066 --> 00:58:36,433
-Okay. Come on.
-Okay, bye.

1429
00:58:36,567 --> 00:58:38,600
Bye. Have fun.

1430
00:58:38,734 --> 00:58:40,433
-Thank you. I appreciate this.
-No problem, are you kidding?

1431
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:43,233
Does Derrick...
Does Derrick like Nicky?

1432
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:44,867
What makes you say that?

1433
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,233
Sometimes the way
he looks at her.

1434
00:58:47,367 --> 00:58:49,834
It's the same way
you look at Mom.

1435
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:52,000
Well, you pick up on a lot
for a 15-year-old.

1436
00:58:52,133 --> 00:58:53,734
Hey. 15-and-a-half.

1437
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:56,367
All right. 15-and-a-half.

1438
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,834
Gotta be specific.
Look at that.

1439
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,900
-Oh, yeah.
-That's great.

1440
00:59:02,033 --> 00:59:03,133
Doesn't that look good?

1441
00:59:03,266 --> 00:59:04,834
A couple of hard workers here.

1442
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,500
Mom?

1443
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,066
What are you doing here?

1444
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,800
Oh, I figured I'd come see
your big surprise for Simone.

1445
00:59:12,934 --> 00:59:18,800
I heard you two on the phone.
Couple of spies you're not.

1446
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,500
Well, what do you think?

1447
00:59:22,633 --> 00:59:23,967
It's pretty awesome, huh?

1448
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,800
Oh, it's a beautiful home.

1449
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:31,233
Although it looks like
you've lost a bulb up there.

1450
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:32,667
Oh, yeah.

1451
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,934
Sometimes it's easier
to see things

1452
00:59:34,066 --> 00:59:35,800
when you're not so close
to them.

1453
00:59:35,934 --> 00:59:37,266
Hmm.

1454
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,667
I think it's really nice what
you're doing for Simone.

1455
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,100
I'm sure she'll love it.

1456
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:44,233
I hope so.

1457
00:59:44,367 --> 00:59:46,300
We spent a lot of time
getting it ready.

1458
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:49,500
-Maybe too much time.
-What do you mean?

1459
00:59:49,633 --> 00:59:53,400
Well, you think she'd be
any less surprised

1460
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:58,266
if you didn't take time to do
all these decorations?

1461
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,500
Not really.

1462
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:02,500
She might even like helping
you out.

1463
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:05,567
Spending time working
on it together.

1464
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,000
I don't know Simone that well,

1465
01:00:07,133 --> 01:00:10,667
but no one likes to be
left alone.

1466
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,066
Especially during the holidays.

1467
01:00:14,767 --> 01:00:16,767
She's right.

1468
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,834
We've been skipping out
on a lot to focus on this.

1469
01:00:19,967 --> 01:00:22,100
I guess, we should've thought
about that before.

1470
01:00:22,233 --> 01:00:24,467
Well, like I said, it's easier
to see something

1471
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,066
when you're not so close to it.

1472
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,367
Hmm.

1473
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:48,600
I haven't been to a Christmas
concert in forever.

1474
01:00:48,734 --> 01:00:51,066
Well, you're going to see
something really special.

1475
01:00:56,767 --> 01:00:59,734
Ring out wild bells,
to the wild sky

1476
01:00:59,867 --> 01:01:02,567
The flying cloud,
the frosty light

1477
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,633
The year is dying
in the night

1478
01:01:04,767 --> 01:01:08,000
Ring out wild bells,
and let him die

1479
01:01:08,133 --> 01:01:09,533
Ring out the old,

1480
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:10,900
ring in the new

1481
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:13,333
Ring, happy bells,
across the snow

1482
01:01:13,467 --> 01:01:16,500
The year is going,
let him go

1483
01:01:16,633 --> 01:01:19,166
Ring out the false,
ring in the true.

1484
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,467
Woooo!

1485
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
-Wow!
-Amazing, right?

1486
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:32,033
Yes.

1487
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:33,300
Amazing for an eight-year-old,
huh?

1488
01:01:33,433 --> 01:01:35,467
I bet you helped her parents
find a house.

1489
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,033
Well, not yet, but
I'm working on it.

1490
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:38,300
Mm-hmm.

1491
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:39,633
No, no. Truth be told,
actually her mom and I

1492
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:41,000
graduated from high school
together so...

1493
01:01:41,133 --> 01:01:42,867
Oh, yeah?
Where'd you go?

1494
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,033
Lakeview.
Yeah, same as you.

1495
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:47,467
Were you there when I...

1496
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,200
No, no, no. I graduated
a year before you.

1497
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:50,900
Oh. Right.

1498
01:01:53,467 --> 01:01:54,900
You're right-handed, right?

1499
01:01:55,033 --> 01:01:56,033
Yeah, yeah, I am.
Why?

1500
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:57,800
No. I was just curious.
I've meant to...

1501
01:01:57,934 --> 01:01:59,000
Oh!

1502
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,533
Oh no. I got it, hey.
That's ok, I got it.

1503
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:01,867
No problem.

1504
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,734
Uh, this is uh...
It's old.

1505
01:02:08,867 --> 01:02:11,100
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's nothing.

1506
01:02:11,233 --> 01:02:14,367
It's just a Christmas card
someone gave me a long time ago.

1507
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,266
And you, uh, you've been
carrying it all these years?

1508
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,300
No, no.
Oh, my gosh.

1509
01:02:19,433 --> 01:02:21,300
No. Um, I mean, I have it now.

1510
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:23,033
It just... it's that I found it

1511
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:25,433
at my parents' house in an old
box and so I just...

1512
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:27,700
I don't even know why I have it
with me really, to be honest.

1513
01:02:27,834 --> 01:02:29,266
It's just... It's that,
it's the thing.

1514
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,033
Never mind. Anyway um,
I'm going to donate.

1515
01:02:31,166 --> 01:02:32,066
-Right.
-If you don't mind.

1516
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,266
Oh, uh, listen.

1517
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,567
Sorry, listen, I gotta
take this.

1518
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,934
It could be about your
parents' house.

1519
01:02:39,066 --> 01:02:40,233
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah great.

1520
01:02:40,367 --> 01:02:41,900
Hello? Derrick here.

1521
01:02:42,033 --> 01:02:43,033
Hey.

1522
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,633
You're going to need
more icing than that.

1523
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:50,266
Okay.

1524
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,934
Here, let me do it.

1525
01:02:52,066 --> 01:02:54,467
You know what?
Thank you, Miriam. Thank you.

1526
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,066
Hey honey. Are you going
to go to the gym

1527
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,400
and practice basketball
with Jeremy?

1528
01:02:59,934 --> 01:03:01,967
Actually, I was wondering
if you wanted to go

1529
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,033
to the Handmade Holiday Fair.

1530
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:05,800
I haven't been and it's
the second last day.

1531
01:03:06,734 --> 01:03:07,767
I would love to, honey,

1532
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,633
but Miriam and I have
to finish this up.

1533
01:03:09,767 --> 01:03:13,100
Oh, no, no, no. Please.
You two go.

1534
01:03:13,233 --> 01:03:15,033
I'm more than happy
to do this on my own.

1535
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:15,800
Are you sure?

1536
01:03:15,934 --> 01:03:17,800
Positive.

1537
01:03:17,934 --> 01:03:19,333
I'll mix up another batch.

1538
01:03:19,467 --> 01:03:21,367
Okay. Thank you.

1539
01:03:21,633 --> 01:03:23,166
I know Christmas is only
a couple days away

1540
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,700
and it's too late for
a Christmas card

1541
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:27,767
but if you'd really like
a picture of me with Santa

1542
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,066
we can do it.

1543
01:03:30,767 --> 01:03:31,867
Really?

1544
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,266
What made you decide that?

1545
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:38,333
You love that tradition.

1546
01:03:38,467 --> 01:03:40,700
I do. But I love you more.

1547
01:03:40,834 --> 01:03:42,033
I just want to spend time
with you.

1548
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:44,000
We don't need
to include Santa.

1549
01:03:44,133 --> 01:03:45,266
Really?

1550
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,700
Because I'd rather go look
at snowboards

1551
01:03:46,834 --> 01:03:48,133
and skip the whole craft fair.

1552
01:03:48,266 --> 01:03:50,000
Okay, snowboards it is.

1553
01:03:50,133 --> 01:03:54,367
And maybe grab lunch afterward,
just you and me?

1554
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,934
Yes.

1555
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:57,600
Honey, these are the things
that I'm going to miss

1556
01:03:57,734 --> 01:03:59,033
when you're gone someday.

1557
01:03:59,166 --> 01:04:01,900
Just 'cause I leave doesn't mean
I'm gone, Mom.

1558
01:04:02,033 --> 01:04:02,900
Aww, kiddo.

1559
01:04:03,033 --> 01:04:05,233
I just styled it, Mom.

1560
01:04:05,367 --> 01:04:06,233
But it's so pretty.

1561
01:04:06,367 --> 01:04:07,567
Ugh.

1562
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,500
You never let me touch
your hair anymore.

1563
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:21,500
-Santa's here.
-Hi.

1564
01:04:22,533 --> 01:04:23,700
Okay, okay.

1565
01:04:23,834 --> 01:04:26,767
Woah! Yeah!

1566
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,166
Are these all for us?

1567
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,367
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

1568
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,000
Well, my mom and I went
shopping yesterday.

1569
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:32,166
Aww.

1570
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,166
And also, it's a bit of
a peace offering.

1571
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,734
Our last conversation
was a little tense.

1572
01:04:36,867 --> 01:04:38,433
No, you were absolutely right

1573
01:04:38,567 --> 01:04:41,567
about Anthony and Jeremy
needing space. It's fine.

1574
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,000
Yes, you were.

1575
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:44,166
-Okay.
-Okay.

1576
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,233
-Thank you.
-Okay.

1577
01:04:45,367 --> 01:04:46,333
Yeah.

1578
01:04:46,467 --> 01:04:47,433
Um, Miriam and I
are playing trivia.

1579
01:04:47,567 --> 01:04:48,767
Want to come on in?

1580
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,066
-Yes, I do.
-Okay.

1581
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,333
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt your game.

1582
01:04:53,467 --> 01:04:55,400
Perfect timing. I was
losing anyway.

1583
01:04:56,734 --> 01:04:58,000
Uh, Miriam, this is
my best friend, Nicky,

1584
01:04:58,133 --> 01:04:59,433
also the Maid of Honor.

1585
01:04:59,567 --> 01:05:00,900
Nicky, this is Jeremy's mom.

1586
01:05:01,033 --> 01:05:02,600
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you,
Mrs. Winters.

1587
01:05:02,734 --> 01:05:05,400
Call me Miriam, please.

1588
01:05:05,533 --> 01:05:06,767
Here honey.

1589
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:10,100
Sit down and play this Christmas
trivia game with us.

1590
01:05:10,233 --> 01:05:11,600
Oh.

1591
01:05:11,734 --> 01:05:15,467
Simone, we have to start over
now that we have a third.

1592
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,300
That is convenient.

1593
01:05:17,433 --> 01:05:19,166
I'll just have to beat you both.

1594
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,834
I need to find a game
she isn't good at.

1595
01:05:20,967 --> 01:05:21,600
Oh, I've tried.

1596
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,266
-Yeah. Good luck with that.
-Yeah.

1597
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:29,166
Nik, we have been discussing
how difficult it was

1598
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,000
when Jeremy and Jason
went away to college.

1599
01:05:32,133 --> 01:05:34,834
Oh, I missed them both
like crazy.

1600
01:05:34,967 --> 01:05:38,266
Now Jason, he phones
every couple of days.

1601
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,000
But Jeremy on the other hand,

1602
01:05:40,133 --> 01:05:41,333
if he doesn't
feel like talking

1603
01:05:41,467 --> 01:05:43,233
he just doesn't answer
his phone.

1604
01:05:43,367 --> 01:05:44,133
It's true.

1605
01:05:44,266 --> 01:05:45,400
At least I have
the pictures.

1606
01:05:45,533 --> 01:05:46,767
Oh, yeah.

1607
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,800
Miriam says she has old photos
I haven't seen yet.

1608
01:05:48,934 --> 01:05:50,900
Photos from when Jeremy
was young?

1609
01:05:51,033 --> 01:05:51,934
-Yes.
-Mm-hmm.

1610
01:05:52,066 --> 01:05:53,333
You know, if they're
embarrassing

1611
01:05:53,467 --> 01:05:55,934
we could put them up on the wall
at the rehearsal dinner.

1612
01:05:56,066 --> 01:05:57,433
That would be great.

1613
01:05:57,567 --> 01:06:00,834
When I get home, I'll find
the box they're packed away in.

1614
01:06:00,967 --> 01:06:02,066
Perfect.

1615
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,166
Mm. Speaking of things
packed away in boxes,

1616
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,367
did you find out
who wrote that card?

1617
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,367
Nothing yet.

1618
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,633
Card?

1619
01:06:09,767 --> 01:06:11,066
It's just an old Christmas card.

1620
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,834
No, it is an anonymous
love letter from high school.

1621
01:06:13,967 --> 01:06:15,133
Oh!

1622
01:06:15,266 --> 01:06:16,533
You have it, don't you?

1623
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:18,633
Oh, Miriam you have to see it.

1624
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:20,667
I just wasn't able...

1625
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,200
It is so sweet and sincere.

1626
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,900
He even quoted
Romeo and Juliet.

1627
01:06:25,033 --> 01:06:26,633
Let me see.

1628
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:32,233
Oh.

1629
01:06:33,767 --> 01:06:34,734
What?

1630
01:06:36,767 --> 01:06:38,133
Oh.

1631
01:06:38,266 --> 01:06:39,166
Nothing.

1632
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,800
No, really, tell us.

1633
01:06:40,934 --> 01:06:47,033
Well, uh, it's just that...
I recognize the writing.

1634
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:48,333
You do?

1635
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:52,767
Whose is it?

1636
01:06:55,767 --> 01:06:57,333
It's Jeremy's.

1637
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,367
Um...

1638
01:07:08,467 --> 01:07:10,333
wrote this?that Jerey

1639
01:07:10,467 --> 01:07:11,000
It can't be.

1640
01:07:11,133 --> 01:07:12,467
It is.

1641
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,600
I spent weeks working with him
on his penmanship.

1642
01:07:16,734 --> 01:07:19,266
See how he makes his R's?

1643
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,000
Never did get 'em right.

1644
01:07:21,133 --> 01:07:22,467
He does do his R's that way.

1645
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,467
Oh, no. I'm sure lots of people
do their R's like that.

1646
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,767
And he is left-handed.

1647
01:07:29,233 --> 01:07:32,500
My fiancÃ© was in love
with my best friend. Great.

1648
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:33,767
Okay. No, no, no, no, no.

1649
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,133
We are not jumping to
conclusions here, okay?

1650
01:07:35,266 --> 01:07:38,300
What we're going to do is we're
going to ask Jeremy.

1651
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:39,433
Ask him what?

1652
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,400
What's going on?

1653
01:07:44,533 --> 01:07:46,300
Hi, um...

1654
01:07:46,433 --> 01:07:48,033
Did you write this?

1655
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,834
Oh.

1656
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,500
Oh, yeah, I did write this.
I'd forgot all about it.

1657
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:03,800
No. No, no, no.

1658
01:08:03,934 --> 01:08:07,300
I mean, yes. Yes, I wrote
the card.

1659
01:08:07,433 --> 01:08:10,734
But I uh... someone gave me
this card,

1660
01:08:10,867 --> 01:08:13,166
and they, they gave me
a piece of paper

1661
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,533
with what I was supposed to copy
down and asked me to do it.

1662
01:08:16,667 --> 01:08:19,467
Why in the world
would he do that?

1663
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,400
Uh, because they had
terrible writing.

1664
01:08:21,533 --> 01:08:23,900
I mean, you would've needed
a degree in hieroglyphics

1665
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:25,300
to decipher it.

1666
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:30,767
So, uh, who was it?

1667
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,300
I can't tell you that.

1668
01:08:35,433 --> 01:08:37,700
I... I promised I wouldn't.

1669
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:38,667
Wha?

1670
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,166
Oh, come on, honey.

1671
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,500
Nicky's been trying to figure
this out for three weeks.

1672
01:08:41,633 --> 01:08:43,000
She really wants to know.

1673
01:08:43,133 --> 01:08:47,066
I mean, it's been 22 years.

1674
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,467
Yeah, I know.

1675
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,567
But, I uh, I made a promise
and I keep my promises.

1676
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:56,567
See? That's the boy I raised.

1677
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:00,834
Thank you, Mom.

1678
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,300
I'll talk to him tonight.

1679
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,533
Listen, I know that you said
you weren't going to tell Nicky,

1680
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:28,233
but I am your fiancÃ©e. So...

1681
01:09:29,867 --> 01:09:32,300
I promised I wasn't going
to tell anyone.

1682
01:09:32,433 --> 01:09:34,367
She felt like an outsider
in high school.

1683
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,400
It would be really nice
for her if she,

1684
01:09:36,533 --> 01:09:37,800
she knew that somebody
liked her.

1685
01:09:37,934 --> 01:09:41,200
It would just... it would mean
a lot to her, you know?

1686
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:42,467
Yeah.

1687
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:46,767
I think that Nicky should focus
less on the past

1688
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,934
and more on the present.

1689
01:09:48,066 --> 01:09:49,233
What do you mean?

1690
01:09:49,367 --> 01:09:51,400
Well, Derrick seems to have
taken an interest.

1691
01:09:51,533 --> 01:09:53,533
Really? He's such a great guy.

1692
01:09:53,667 --> 01:09:54,967
I know.

1693
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,100
But Nicky doesn't seem to be
picking up on the signals.

1694
01:09:57,233 --> 01:10:00,633
Oh, well. I'll just talk to her.
It'll be fine.

1695
01:10:00,767 --> 01:10:01,533
-No.
-Yeah.

1696
01:10:01,667 --> 01:10:02,233
No.

1697
01:10:02,367 --> 01:10:04,133
I know you love her,

1698
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:06,567
but this is something they need
to figure out on their own.

1699
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,066
But, you know,
the thing with her is

1700
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,734
she just needs a little nudge,
like the tiniest little...

1701
01:10:11,867 --> 01:10:15,800
Ugh, fine. I will stay
out of it.

1702
01:10:15,934 --> 01:10:18,066
You're not any fun.

1703
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,066
So.

1704
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,300
So, how'd it go today?

1705
01:10:20,433 --> 01:10:21,600
Was Nicky here to run
interference?

1706
01:10:21,734 --> 01:10:23,567
No, actually.

1707
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:26,367
Your mother and I are getting
along quite well.

1708
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,066
I think I understand her
a little bit better now.

1709
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:34,133
Yeah. Um, in fact,

1710
01:10:34,266 --> 01:10:37,467
I think that you could be
a little bit more attentive.

1711
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,200
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.

1712
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:41,967
I'm attentive.

1713
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,433
Yes, of course.

1714
01:10:43,567 --> 01:10:45,600
But, you know, this week
I have spent more time with her

1715
01:10:45,734 --> 01:10:47,233
than you have.

1716
01:10:47,367 --> 01:10:51,567
Well, in my defense we didn't
expect her this early,

1717
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:54,033
and I've been...
I've been busy.

1718
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:55,934
Okay. Well, why don't you
take her calls?

1719
01:10:56,066 --> 01:10:57,967
I... I love talking to her.

1720
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:01,800
I just... she always calls
at the worst possible moment.

1721
01:11:01,934 --> 01:11:04,867
And when would
the right moment be?

1722
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,266
Because you know,

1723
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:10,000
you're always at work
or here or with Anthony.

1724
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:12,100
And she gets left out.

1725
01:11:12,233 --> 01:11:13,500
You're right.

1726
01:11:13,633 --> 01:11:17,767
A mother needs to spend time
with her son.

1727
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:20,100
That sounds a little familiar,
yeah.

1728
01:11:21,734 --> 01:11:25,033
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1729
01:12:02,967 --> 01:12:04,066
Hey!

1730
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,867
Happy Christmas Eve, kiddo.

1731
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,934
What do you want
for breakfast?

1732
01:12:07,066 --> 01:12:08,200
I'll make anything you want.

1733
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:09,233
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1734
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:10,433
Anything?

1735
01:12:10,567 --> 01:12:11,567
Yes. I think it's time
that we come up with

1736
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:15,000
some new Christmas
traditions together.

1737
01:12:15,133 --> 01:12:17,200
Waffles? Omelettes?

1738
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,767
How about both?

1739
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,433
Yes!

1740
01:12:20,567 --> 01:12:21,767
Womlettes, waffles.

1741
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,100
Wafflettes! Huh?

1742
01:12:24,233 --> 01:12:25,567
Okay.

1743
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:26,867
You get to crack the eggs.

1744
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,233
All righty.

1745
01:12:28,367 --> 01:12:29,166
Okay.

1746
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,400
-The best part.
-I only need...

1747
01:12:31,533 --> 01:12:32,400
-Two?
-Careful.

1748
01:12:32,533 --> 01:12:33,333
All right.

1749
01:12:35,633 --> 01:12:37,834
This goes in at 350.

1750
01:12:37,967 --> 01:12:39,533
-That gets turned down to 275.
-To where?

1751
01:12:39,667 --> 01:12:41,934
-The prime rib.
-275.

1752
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,333
And then what...

1753
01:12:43,467 --> 01:12:45,333
-Don't burn the house down.
-Did you?

1754
01:12:45,467 --> 01:12:46,600
I just touched that.

1755
01:12:46,734 --> 01:12:48,000
Oh. We need to get the cake
out of the fridge.

1756
01:12:48,133 --> 01:12:49,500
Right.

1757
01:12:49,633 --> 01:12:51,367
And then once the water's
boiling then we do the crab dip.

1758
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,900
I gotta tell you, Nicky.
I love your efficiency.

1759
01:12:55,033 --> 01:12:56,000
Well, it is my job.

1760
01:12:57,033 --> 01:12:58,400
It's also who I am.

1761
01:12:58,533 --> 01:13:01,100
Alright. I hope you don't mind
if I drop and run.

1762
01:13:01,233 --> 01:13:02,633
I got a mammoth to-do list.

1763
01:13:02,767 --> 01:13:04,000
No problem.

1764
01:13:04,133 --> 01:13:05,166
I was able to get the roasting
pan out of the house

1765
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,266
without Simone cluing in.

1766
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,633
Fantastic.

1767
01:13:07,767 --> 01:13:09,066
Are you guys sure everything
will be ready by 7:00?

1768
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,467
I told her we have reservations.

1769
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,300
Guaranteed.

1770
01:13:11,433 --> 01:13:12,667
Okay.

1771
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,767
Oh, and don't forget to turn
the outside lights on

1772
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:15,433
so that she can see them
when we pull up.

1773
01:13:15,567 --> 01:13:16,900
Jeremy, Jeremy, calm down.
We got it.

1774
01:13:17,033 --> 01:13:18,834
All right.

1775
01:13:18,967 --> 01:13:20,266
Thank you guys both
so much.

1776
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,934
I mean, there is no way
I could've pulled this off

1777
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:24,500
without you two.

1778
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:28,333
All right, I am off to pick up
dry cleaning and a tree skirt

1779
01:13:28,467 --> 01:13:30,934
and about 900 other things
left on my to-do list.

1780
01:13:31,066 --> 01:13:31,967
Jeremy, we got it.

1781
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:32,667
Okay.

1782
01:13:33,934 --> 01:13:35,300
Okay.

1783
01:13:35,433 --> 01:13:38,400
And Nicky, I just, I wanted
to say again how sorry I am

1784
01:13:38,533 --> 01:13:41,166
I can't tell you who,
who wrote that card.

1785
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,800
I understand.

1786
01:13:42,934 --> 01:13:44,266
A promise is a promise.

1787
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,333
Okay. I'll see you guys tonight.

1788
01:13:46,467 --> 01:13:47,400
Yeah.

1789
01:13:47,967 --> 01:13:49,066
Drive safe.

1790
01:13:51,033 --> 01:13:52,100
Okay.

1791
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,433
That was uh... was Jeremy
talking about that card

1792
01:13:55,567 --> 01:13:57,400
that fell out of your purse?

1793
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:59,166
Yeah, he was.

1794
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,066
You know, I know you said
earlier that it was nothing,

1795
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,834
but it sounded like
there's a story there.

1796
01:14:04,967 --> 01:14:06,367
I shouldn't have said
it was nothing.

1797
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,333
It was really sweet, actually.

1798
01:14:09,467 --> 01:14:12,233
In high school someone
slipped a Christmas card

1799
01:14:12,367 --> 01:14:13,867
into one of my school books.

1800
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:14,900
Uh-huh.

1801
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:18,533
It was actually more of
a love note.

1802
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:21,900
And, um, anyway I just found it
the other night.

1803
01:14:23,633 --> 01:14:26,233
Wait...
you just found it?

1804
01:14:26,367 --> 01:14:29,166
On Thanksgiving.
Can you believe that? Yeah.

1805
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:32,133
Anyway, I was trying to figure
out who had given it to me.

1806
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:34,367
Jeremy knows and he
won't tell me.

1807
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,834
Will you hand me the stars?

1808
01:14:35,967 --> 01:14:37,700
Uh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

1809
01:14:37,834 --> 01:14:39,333
You got some, some cranberry
on there.

1810
01:14:39,467 --> 01:14:40,400
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

1811
01:14:40,533 --> 01:14:42,166
So, if you can't get it
out of Jeremy

1812
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,300
how are you going to find out
who this person is?

1813
01:14:44,433 --> 01:14:45,533
I'm not.

1814
01:14:45,667 --> 01:14:47,300
I was just trying
to figure it out

1815
01:14:47,433 --> 01:14:50,900
because I wanted to
have something good from
high school to remember.

1816
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:53,500
It doesn't matter now.

1817
01:14:53,633 --> 01:14:54,700
What changed?

1818
01:14:54,834 --> 01:14:56,300
Me.

1819
01:14:56,433 --> 01:14:57,834
I changed.

1820
01:14:57,967 --> 01:14:59,667
I realized that high school

1821
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,033
wasn't as bad as I thought
it was.

1822
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,533
Can we put those on
the other tray?

1823
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:05,400
Right, yes.

1824
01:15:05,533 --> 01:15:06,433
Yeah.

1825
01:15:06,567 --> 01:15:08,433
Um, so, let me get
this straight.

1826
01:15:08,567 --> 01:15:11,567
So, you... you're totally okay
with not finding out

1827
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,200
who wrote you the card?

1828
01:15:13,333 --> 01:15:15,300
Yeah.

1829
01:15:15,433 --> 01:15:17,467
I really am.

1830
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,533
Hmm.

1831
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:19,633
I have to get
the crab dip going.

1832
01:15:19,767 --> 01:15:20,633
Right.

1833
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:22,367
Okay, let's see.

1834
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,066
How's, how's that look?

1835
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,600
Perfect.

1836
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:40,000
You know, I forgot how much
fun this is.

1837
01:15:44,433 --> 01:15:47,734
We better get going on
those deliveries.

1838
01:15:47,867 --> 01:15:50,133
You don't want to be late
for your big surprise.

1839
01:15:50,266 --> 01:15:51,834
Right.

1840
01:15:56,734 --> 01:15:59,700
Anthony, come on.
Jeremy and Miriam are waiting.

1841
01:16:01,367 --> 01:16:02,600
Right.

1842
01:16:02,934 --> 01:16:05,233
Oh, honey. You made
it almost on time.

1843
01:16:05,367 --> 01:16:06,533
Don't want to miss
our reservation.

1844
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:07,667
Oh, good.

1845
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,867
Hey sweetie, do you think
we have time

1846
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,734
to drive by my favorite house
on the way?

1847
01:16:10,867 --> 01:16:12,500
Yeah. I think we can.

1848
01:16:12,633 --> 01:16:14,166
-Thank you, love.
-Yeah.

1849
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:16,133
-All right, let's go.
-Yeah. Let's go.

1850
01:16:16,266 --> 01:16:17,567
You are going to love
this house.

1851
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:20,233
I'm telling you, it is probably
one of the best houses

1852
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:21,800
I've ever seen.

1853
01:16:26,133 --> 01:16:27,166
Oh, look.

1854
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,467
They changed their decorations
this year.

1855
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,667
I love what they did.

1856
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,400
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

1857
01:16:34,834 --> 01:16:36,166
We should tell 'em.

1858
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:39,033
What?

1859
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:42,500
Come on, we should tell them
we like their decorations.

1860
01:16:42,633 --> 01:16:44,033
No, I don't...

1861
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:46,133
-Jeremy, what are you doing?
-Come on, let's go tell them.

1862
01:16:46,266 --> 01:16:47,667
This is a horrible idea.

1863
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,667
Jeremy, you can't just pull
into somebody's driveway.

1864
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,800
Yes, you can.
It's, it's Christmas.

1865
01:16:51,934 --> 01:16:53,066
Come on.

1866
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:57,367
Your son may be losing
his mind.

1867
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,734
It was only a matter of time.

1868
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:03,367
Okay, let's go say hi.

1869
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:03,967
No.

1870
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:04,633
Come on!

1871
01:17:04,767 --> 01:17:05,767
Come on, Mom.

1872
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,100
Like Jeremy said,
it's Christmastime.

1873
01:17:07,233 --> 01:17:08,400
Oh, my gosh!
This is crazy.

1874
01:17:08,533 --> 01:17:09,567
We don't even know
who lives here.

1875
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,100
Yes, we do.

1876
01:17:11,233 --> 01:17:13,734
No, no, no, no, no, Jeremy.
I really don't want to do this.

1877
01:17:13,867 --> 01:17:16,633
The joke is funny but it's-

1878
01:17:16,767 --> 01:17:17,867
Oh, this is humiliating.

1879
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,400
Okay. Come on.
Let's just go say hi.

1880
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:20,600
Ok. You ready?

1881
01:17:20,734 --> 01:17:22,533
Oh, my gosh.
You are actually in.

1882
01:17:25,066 --> 01:17:28,133
I mean, my goodness.
It is exactly as I imagined it.

1883
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,734
What are you doing?

1884
01:17:30,867 --> 01:17:32,367
Surprise!

1885
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,533
What is happening?

1886
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:37,967
What?

1887
01:17:40,734 --> 01:17:42,400
Jeremy, what is this?

1888
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:44,633
It's your Christmas gift, Mom.

1889
01:17:44,767 --> 01:17:46,233
What?

1890
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,600
For the last two years you've
made me drive past this house

1891
01:17:47,734 --> 01:17:50,033
every time we've been
in the neighborhood.

1892
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:52,066
I know you've dreamt about it
for a long time,

1893
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,300
and I've dreamt about having
someone as incredible as you

1894
01:17:55,433 --> 01:18:00,533
and Anthony in my life for,
for just as long.

1895
01:18:00,667 --> 01:18:02,333
It seems like the perfect place
for us

1896
01:18:02,467 --> 01:18:05,500
to start our new life together.

1897
01:18:05,633 --> 01:18:08,567
-I love you.
-I love you.

1898
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,166
Well, I couldn't have done it
without this guy.

1899
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,333
Oh, my sweet guy.

1900
01:18:20,467 --> 01:18:22,266
You were just putting up
with mama, right?

1901
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,500
He's so weird.

1902
01:18:23,633 --> 01:18:26,166
And, of course, Derrick.

1903
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,834
He went to such great lengths
to get this house.

1904
01:18:27,967 --> 01:18:29,200
Thank you.

1905
01:18:29,333 --> 01:18:32,767
And Nicky, who somehow managed
to keep it a secret.

1906
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,967
-I'm so happy for you.
-Thank you.

1907
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,834
Oh wow, I'm just so happy
and overwhelmed

1908
01:18:37,967 --> 01:18:39,367
and I don't know
what to say but, yay!

1909
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:42,600
Mom, come check out
my room.

1910
01:18:42,734 --> 01:18:43,667
Have fun!

1911
01:18:47,567 --> 01:18:51,333
Thank you everyone.
Eat, drink, enjoy yourself.

1912
01:18:51,467 --> 01:18:52,834
What do you think?
You think she likes it?

1913
01:18:52,967 --> 01:18:53,934
It's hard to tell, right?

1914
01:18:54,066 --> 01:18:55,266
Just a little bit.

1915
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,367
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1916
01:19:04,133 --> 01:19:06,767
And then the look on her face
when she came through that door.

1917
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,333
I mean, I couldn't believe
she was so surprised.

1918
01:19:09,467 --> 01:19:11,233
Hey Nicky!
Come here.

1919
01:19:11,367 --> 01:19:12,834
Oh, excuse me.

1920
01:19:12,967 --> 01:19:14,000
I want to take a picture

1921
01:19:14,133 --> 01:19:15,433
with you in front of
the Christmas tree.

1922
01:19:15,567 --> 01:19:16,367
Yeah.

1923
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:17,333
Honey, can you take
a photo?

1924
01:19:17,467 --> 01:19:19,266
-Oh, yeah.
-Great. Thank you.

1925
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,867
-Isn't this so exciting?
-Yes.

1926
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,100
Okay, at least we're not
wearing matching outfits

1927
01:19:22,233 --> 01:19:23,400
like we did when
we were kids.

1928
01:19:23,533 --> 01:19:25,266
Yes. There's definitely
been progress.

1929
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,767
Okay. On the count of three
say Christmas.

1930
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:28,900
One, two, three.

1931
01:19:29,033 --> 01:19:30,333
Christmas.

1932
01:19:33,867 --> 01:19:36,367
-Love you.
-Love you too.

1933
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,433
Watching for Santa?

1934
01:19:50,633 --> 01:19:52,667
A star to wish on?

1935
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:57,734
Well, they do both bring you
what you want.

1936
01:19:57,867 --> 01:20:01,667
I was just thinking about that.

1937
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,000
But I have everything I want.

1938
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:06,066
I don't need to keep striving
for more.

1939
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:11,433
I should just learn to be
grateful and enjoy it.

1940
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:16,367
What about someone
to enjoy it with?

1941
01:20:19,033 --> 01:20:20,400
If the right person came along,
yes.

1942
01:20:20,533 --> 01:20:22,867
Oh, okay.

1943
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,900
And what would make him
the right person?

1944
01:20:28,467 --> 01:20:30,700
Would he have to write you
a romantic Christmas card?

1945
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:38,700
Because, um...

1946
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:42,400
I don't like to be upstaged.

1947
01:20:42,533 --> 01:20:44,633
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1948
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,166
What...

1949
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,700
If you can't read my writing
it says "Love Derrick."

1950
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,433
I can read it.

1951
01:21:00,567 --> 01:21:06,567
But you didn't... you didn't
write anything.

1952
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,867
At least I signed it
this time.

1953
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:16,600
"With love's light wings
did I o'erperch these walls,

1954
01:21:16,734 --> 01:21:19,600
"for stony limits cannot
hold love out."

1955
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:26,767
You? That was...

1956
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,166
Yeah, I probably should've
put it in your physics books

1957
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,500
instead of your calculus.

1958
01:21:32,033 --> 01:21:33,834
I tested out of calculus
in the first semester.

1959
01:21:33,967 --> 01:21:35,233
Of course, you did.
Of course, you did.

1960
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,767
Look at those two.

1961
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:41,433
But you weren't on
the basketball team.

1962
01:21:41,567 --> 01:21:43,333
That's true, I wasn't.
And, and you're right.

1963
01:21:43,467 --> 01:21:46,467
Mountain Point did have
a great basketball team.

1964
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,967
But they weren't so good
in debate.

1965
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:49,533
I beat 'em every year.

1966
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,934
You were right.

1967
01:21:54,066 --> 01:21:56,100
They needed to work
that out themselves.

1968
01:21:57,767 --> 01:22:00,800
Yep. Yep.

1969
01:22:00,934 --> 01:22:02,900
Sort of, yeah.

1970
01:22:03,033 --> 01:22:04,500
Wait a minute.
What did you do?

1971
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:06,734
Well, sometimes Derrick
needs a nudge.

1972
01:22:06,867 --> 01:22:09,667
Just a little, little
tiny nudge.

1973
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,166
You!

1974
01:22:13,133 --> 01:22:18,000
Why didn't you say
anything at the church
when the card fell?

1975
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:19,300
What was I supposed
to say, Nicky?

1976
01:22:19,433 --> 01:22:20,567
I mean, I was stunned.

1977
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:21,834
I still couldn't believe

1978
01:22:21,967 --> 01:22:23,033
that we were spending
all this time together

1979
01:22:23,166 --> 01:22:24,700
and that you were still
holding onto a card

1980
01:22:24,834 --> 01:22:25,900
I wrote to you years ago.

1981
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,767
It was overwhelming.

1982
01:22:30,266 --> 01:22:33,500
Nicky, 22 years ago I,

1983
01:22:33,633 --> 01:22:37,633
I didn't have the courage
to tell you how I feel.

1984
01:22:37,767 --> 01:22:39,333
But I do now.

1985
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:44,567
Well, 22 years ago I probably
couldn't have heard it.

1986
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,066
Maybe not seeing that card
back then

1987
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,166
gave us a second chance, huh?

1988
01:22:50,834 --> 01:22:52,100
Nicky.

1989
01:22:53,834 --> 01:22:56,967
I've always believed that
you were special and amazing,

1990
01:22:57,100 --> 01:23:03,133
and that you deserve
to be happy.

1991
01:23:03,266 --> 01:23:05,467
I'm so glad that it was you.

1992
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:12,233
And I am so glad
that it is you.

1993
01:23:17,433 --> 01:23:20,567
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.
