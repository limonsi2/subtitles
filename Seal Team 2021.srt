00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,875
[thunder rumbling]

4
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,041
[dolphin call]
It's go time!

5
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,375
Target is half a klick southwest.

6
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,000
Don't mess this up, seals.

7
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,166
I don't make mistakes.

8
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,708
Oh? The X47 death balloon.

9
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:06,333
This one's really deadly.
Uh, I'm gonna call a human.

10
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,708
No. We got this.

11
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:15,500
Uh, Claggart? You-- You sure
we shouldn't get a human?

12
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,208
I-I feel like we should get a human.

13
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:22,000
You know, you cut the wrong wire,
we'll all be boom! Agh!

14
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,083
-The pain! The pain!
-Switch! Focus.

15
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:28,041
-Yeah, focus. Focus.
-What's taking so long, Claggart?

16
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,916
I got a photoshoot
with <i>National Aquatic </i>after this.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,875
This isn't as easy
as going "Ek-ek-ek-ek-ek," Dolph!

18
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,458
-[gasps]

[chomp]

20
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,375
Ten-hut!

21
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,125
[baby-talk] Do my good boys
want some tasty sardines?

22
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,125
We don't do this for tasty treats.

23
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,708
We do this for honor, for duty, for--

24
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,458
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf!

25
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,083
[baby-talk] Yes, you do!

26
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,708
Now, give me a thumbs-up!

27
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,208
[whirring]

28
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,500
[slow-motion] Run!

29
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,875
[explosion]

30
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,791
[screaming]

31
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,666
[bellowing]

32
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,125
Claggart, I don't want to die

33
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:59,250
before... I have... my photoshoot!

34
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
[screams]

35
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,083
[screaming]

36
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,791
Oh, wait, I'm a dolphin. I'm totally fine!

37
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,166
[squeaks]

38
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,791
[sighs]

39
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,458
Brace for impact!

40
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,166
[whispers] So, what's the plan?

41
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,875
Really obvious head-first charge.

42
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,291
Got anything less stupid?

43
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,666
How about the old 1-2-17, back,
forward, inside-out maneuver!

44
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,833
Huh?

45
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,958
Yeah, too complicated.

46
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,458
Ooh! Surprise attack!

47
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,166
-Too obvious.
-Hm.

48
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,500
Super-secret surprise attack?

49
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,583
[both] Hm.

50
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,083
Three.

51
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,416
Two...

52
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,375
Super-secret surprise attack!

53
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:02,625
Quinn, why do you always have to
shout out the name of the plan?

54
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,875
I got carried away.
But it was such a good plan.

55
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:05,791
Come on!

56
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,791
[indistinct chatter]

57
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,250
[gasps]

58
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,625
What are you doing?

59
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,666
There could be you-know-what's
lurking out there!

60
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,500
A few ravenous seal-eating sharks

61
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,541
is nothing for
the bravest seal in the ocean.

62
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,791
I, the Great Geraldo,
once escaped from an aquarium

63
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,416
using only my wits
and perfectly symmetrical features.

64
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,458
Have you been waiting for someone
to come past so you could tell that story?

65
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,125
Perhaps.

66
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,708
Perhaps not.

67
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:48,750
It's all part of my mystique.

68
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,708
[Quinn] We can still see you.

69
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,791
[stomach gurgling]

70
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,583
Oh, come on. Let's go home.

71
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,541
We'll catch a fish tomorrow.

72
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:06,041
No. We're gonna get a fish today.

73
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,500
-I don't know, Quinn.
-Stay here.

74
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,125
I'll be back before you can say,
"This is a really stupid idea."

75
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,250
This is a really stupid... Ugh!

76
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,125
Quinn! Wait up!

77
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,500
Ha!

78
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,000
Hm.

79
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,458
Oh.

80
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,416
Come on, man.
This is way better than a fish.

81
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,375
Oh, yeah?

82
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:38,083
-You don't even know what it is.
-Oh, come on.

83
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,458
Of course, I do.

84
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,875
It's a super-awesome, um, shiny thingy.

85
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:46,833
-A super-awesome whaty-whaty?
-[gasps] Did you see that?

86
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,791
Do you think it would make
a difference if I pretend I didn't?

87
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,666
[both exhaling]

88
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,375
Who wants to get in my face-hole?

89
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,083
[screaming]

90
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,750
-Out of the way!
-No! Find your own lunch!

91
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,500
-Swim for your lives!
-We're doomed!

92
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,416
I don't wanna be food!

93
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:13,333
[laughs]
Hey, Snap, your face went right into...

94
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,541
[chuckle]

95
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,125
[whimpers]

96
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:29,583
[screaming]

97
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,500
[chuckles]

98
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,958
Other way, man. Other way!

99
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,708
Are you crazy?
There's sharks back there!

100
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,375
Turn around! Turn around!

101
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,083
Benji?

102
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,041
Benji!

103
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,458
Whoo!

104
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,125
Oh. That was too close.

105
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,125
Come on. We're almost home.

106
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,041
I said, you're going in the face-hole!

107
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,208
No! My face-hole!

108
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,375
Any ideas?

109
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,583
Don't say super-secret surprise attack!

110
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,208
The corkscrew spin!

111
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,000
-You sure about this?
-Nope, not at all.

112
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,750
Three... two...

113
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,250
[laughing]

114
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,458
Corkscrew spin!

115
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,583
No wonder they didn't wanna
go in your face-hole.

116
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,333
It's disgusting in here.

117
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,750
After them!

118
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,541
[screaming]

119
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,916
[groans]

120
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,958
-[exhales]
-[Benji] Quinn?

121
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:31,791
Yeah?

122
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:35,916
You shouted out
the name of the plan again.

123
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,583
But we totally nailed it that time.

124
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,250
Do you count not catching a fish

125
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,625
and almost being eaten by a shark
three times as "nailing it"?

126
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,875
Yes.

127
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,166
Kinda, sorta, maybe,
not really, no not at all.

128
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,041
Definitely not. That was
a complete, total failure.

129
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,750
-This is my spot!
-No, it's mine!

130
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,458
Mine, mine, mine.

131
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:02,083
You do know what you did out there
was really stupid, right?

132
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,125
Stupidly worth it! Check it out!

133
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,000
We could use them to make light signals!

134
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,166
[yelps] My eyes! My eyes!

135
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,875
[chuckling]

136
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,625
I wasn't talking about the thingies.

137
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,291
I meant coming back for me.
You could've been eaten.

138
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,666
We gotta look out for each other, right?

139
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,541
Yeah. No matter what.

140
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,583
[laughing]

141
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,166
Rah! I'm a seal-eating sharky!

142
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,250
-[roars]
-[giggling]

143
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,708
Tag. You're part of the food chain.
[chuckles]

144
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,958
All right, little predator.
It's time for dinner.

145
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,583
Mmm. Barnacles.

146
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,708
[screaming]

147
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,541
-Barnacles!
-[both] Ugh!

148
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,958
They taste like sand and disappointment.

149
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,041
[munches, coughs, groans]

150
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:07,500
[munches, coughs, gasps, groans]

151
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,208
[coughing, groaning]

152
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,083
And they're particularly
disappointy-ish today.

153
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,250
Ugh! There has got to be
a better way than this.

154
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:26,083
Oh, there is.
Trick is to lick a rock for flavor.

155
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,791
[slurps] Then stare directly at the sun.

156
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,583
[groans]

157
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,291
The searing pain
removes the disappointment.

158
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,208
Uh... thanks, Beth.

159
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,250
But I was talking about all of this.

160
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,541
Risking our lives every day
to maybe get a fish?

161
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,208
-I'm so sick of barnacles!
-Barnacles are the worst!

162
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:49,958
Don't worry, seals.
It is almost time for the sardine run.

163
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,375
We'll all get to eat.

164
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,000
-Yeah!
-I love sardines!

165
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,208
-That totally averts any worries I had.
-What about the sharks?

166
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,541
-Sharks?
-Good point.

167
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,583
-Oh, I did not think of that!
-Ha! Hardly a concern.

168
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:05,458
I can count the amount of sharks
I've seen there on one flipper.

169
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,000
I'd buy that.

170
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,958
-Nothing to worry about.
-That's pretty convincing.

171
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,541
-[stomach gurgling]
-Quinn?

172
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,333
Yeah?

173
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:25,541
I really hope we catch more of them
awesome shiny thingies tomorrow.

174
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,708
I'm so hungry.

175
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,291
What do you think these things really are?

176
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,083
[yawns] Who knows?

177
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,291
All kinds of shipwrecks around here

178
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,583
filled with weird human stuff.

179
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,583
Yeah.

180
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,041
[snoring]

181
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:43,958
My spot.

182
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,625
In your dreams.

183
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,166
He is dreaming.

184
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,500
[exhales]

185
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,791
Benji?

186
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:18,375
-What are you doing out here?
-I'm gonna get us some food.

187
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,208
All kinds of shipwrecks
around here, right?

188
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,083
And humans never
go anywhere without snacks.

189
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,541
Now, go back to sleep.

190
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,333
Breakfast is on me.

191
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,500
Trust me, that's all I wanna do right now.

192
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,791
Some idiot once told me
that we gotta look out for each other.

193
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,041
Well, that guy
must have been pretty stupid.

194
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,166
Uh-huh!

195
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,958
[gasps] Over here.

196
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,000
Humans sure have some interesting snacks.

197
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,333
-Junk.
-Trash.

198
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,041
-Worthless.
-Yum!

199
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,333
-[both yelping]
-Sideways! Sideways! Attack!

200
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,000
La la la la!

201
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Wow! This is a rough part of the ocean.

202
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,291
[gasps] Tell me about it.

203
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,333
Oh, there's gotta be some food out there.

204
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,250
Yeah, like us, if we go out there.

205
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:18,291
Come on. We'll be in and out before you
can say, "This is a really stupid idea."

206
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,875
This is a really stupid...
[sighs] I don't know why I bother.

207
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,958
[grunts]

208
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,250
What do you think happened...?

209
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,625
Why would you even think
about asking a question like that?

210
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,250
Just looking for trouble.

211
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,333
It's just that, you know, this is totally
the kind of place that you would find a--

212
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,291
-Don't say it!
-Oh, relax, man. I'm sure we'll be...

213
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,875
Sorry!

214
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,958
[indistinct chatter]

215
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,833
Hello there, little fellas.

216
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,750
-Hello.
-Hello.

217
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:09,833
'Sup?

218
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:17,041
[chuckles] What's the rush?

219
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,291
I haven't even introduced myself.

220
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:24,958
My name's Grimes.
How are you doing today?

221
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,541
-Are you good?
-Are you well?

222
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:31,208
-Are you fine? [laughs]
-[exhales]

223
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,791
What? I asked if they was fine.

224
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,166
Like you wanted to pick
the scraps off their bones.

225
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,958
Isn't that what we're doing here?

226
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,333
[groans] Obviously,
but we don't want them to...

227
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,833
[screams] My eyes!

228
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,375
We can lose them in there!

229
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,083
-Corkscrew spin?
-Are you sure?

230
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,166
-Hm.
-[sighs] Thought so.

231
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,291
Three.

232
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,666
Two.

233
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,916
One!

234
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,958
[grunts] Whoo-hoo!

235
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,291
See? I'm learning! I didn't even
shout out the name of the plan!

236
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,666
Benji?

237
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,250
Come on. Come on, come on.

238
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,625
Come on, Benji.

239
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,750
[exhales]

240
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,416
[cackles]

241
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,500
[grunts] Benji!

242
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,875
-Did he just...?
-No ways.

243
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,000
Ooh!

244
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,208
You're food.

245
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,916
You're food!

246
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,000
[screams]

247
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,541
[yelps]

248
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,541
[grunts] No! No! Stop it!

249
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,333
This is so undignifying!

250
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,250
[grunts]

251
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:52,791
This is what happens when you
go up against the food chain.

252
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,291
Food chain can kiss my tailfin.

253
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,375
[grunts]

254
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,833
[gasps]

255
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,791
Hmmf.

256
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,333
-Hm?
-No! You can't eat him!

257
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,125
I thought you'd learned your lesson!

258
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,333
[both yelp]

259
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,458
So, so sorry. We thought
you were, oh, you know...

260
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,125
KIA, roger.

261
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,833
My name is Diving Dee. This is Roger.

262
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,125
-Roger.
-That eloquent lady is Mayday.

263
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,458
[comical gibberish]

264
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,833
Is she all right?

265
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,500
Yeah, she's been trying
to eat that starfish for years.

266
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,541
[comical gibberish]

267
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,250
I think they've formed
a symbiotic relationship.

268
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,250
I'm Quinn.

269
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:11,458
Well, Quinn, what brings your
unconscious body to these waters?

270
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,333
I went looking for food
with my friend. Benji.

271
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:25,333
[gasps] An old seal.
He saved me from a shark.

272
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,291
Big mustache. Angry. Face like this.

273
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,583
[grunts]

274
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,458
-Ooh, Claggart.
-Roger.

275
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,041
You know where I can find him?

276
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,625
You're probably safer
going back to the shark.

277
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,208
That old grouch
does not like visitors. Nope.

278
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:55,000
He does seem to enjoy
inflicting pain on them, though.

279
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,958
Oh, well, it's nice
having known ya, Quinn.

280
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,375
Enjoy the last few moments
of your short, short life.

281
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,583
Over and out. Over.

282
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,041
[grunts]

283
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,166
[growling]

284
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,500
You have exactly ten seconds
to get off my ship

285
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,208
before I teach you the meaning of pain.

286
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,500
Ten, unbelievable pain.

287
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,166
Nine, ridiculous pain.

288
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,791
Eight, worse pain.

289
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:49,750
The way you took on that shark.
How did you do that?

290
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,375
Ha! Basic flipper-to-flipper combat.

291
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,791
Could you teach me?

292
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,416
[sighs]
That's what my crew used to call an RSI.

293
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,791
R-S...?

294
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,583
A really stupid idea!

295
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,625
Why would you wanna throw your life away?

296
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
The other super awesome shiny thingy.

297
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,208
The whata-whata-whata-whaty?

298
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,416
It belonged to my best friend.

299
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,500
Oh. I see.

300
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,416
Well, it's a cold, dark,

00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,625
and-get-your-whole-team-disbanded
kind of ocean out there, pup.

303
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,875
Weirdly specific.

304
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,791
It's best to go home,
move on with your life,

305
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,125
and leave complete strangers alone!

306
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,458
The only way you're getting rid of me
is to teach me how to fight.

307
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,375
Or throw me off this boat.

308
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,875
-Oh.
-I--I phrased that badly.

309
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,625
I phrased that badly!

310
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,791
-[grunts]
-[screams]

311
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,916
That lesson's for free. Now get lost.

312
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:02,083
Teach me or the sardines are gonna get it.

313
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,916
You wouldn't dare.

314
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,208
Oh. Wouldn't I?

315
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,250
[singing in Russian]

316
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,625
Not the Tsardines!

317
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,333
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is to get those?

318
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,125
More than anyone.

319
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,333
[sighs]

320
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,458
Come with me.

321
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,500
[gasps]

322
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,875
My years in the service taught me

323
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,958
that this is what you need
to accomplish any mission.

324
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,500
-A photo?
-No! In the photo!

325
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,125
A dolphin smoking a cigar?

326
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,291
No!

327
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,791
A team of soldiers,

328
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:05,541
brave, stupid, or crazy enough
to follow you into any mission.

329
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,000
No matter how dangerous.

330
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:13,125
You mean, I should form
some kind of seal ensemble?

331
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,083
-Wanna sing acapella?
-Seal club?

332
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,708
You <i>obviously </i>haven't been to the Arctic.

333
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,833
Wait. I've got it.

334
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,333
Flipper Patrol!

335
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,291

336
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:28,750

337
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,500
Have fun with the sharks!

338
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,916
[groans]

339
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,208
My name is Seal.

340
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,625
You seals have been an amazing audience.

341
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:48,208
Now, this is the part of the evening
where I want you all to sing along.

342
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,875
Say, "Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf."

343
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,166
[all] Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf.

344
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,166
Now say,
"Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf. Arf. Arf!"

345
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,875
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf! Arf! Arf!

346
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,125
Now say... Quinn?

347
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,083
[all] Quinn?

348
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,291
-Where have you been?
-[all] Where have you been?

349
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:03,541
Cut it out!

350
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,833
Benji and I went to...

351
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,750
[sighs] There was a shark.

352
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,625
[coughs]

353
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:19,375
Well, it's best to forget
about all that and have a barnacle.

354
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:25,708
No! I am so sick of disgusting barnacles.

355
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,708
Don't worry. There's always the...

356
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:30,250
What, the sardine run? Please!

357
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,916
We all just go into the water

358
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,833
and hope that we're faster
than the next seal.

359
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,875
Aren't you tired of leaving
your friends behind?

360
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,625
I hate to bring up
the painfully obvious,

361
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,458
but it's a shark-eat-seal world
out there, right?

362
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,875
Every seal for themselves.

363
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:47,041
If it's between him or me,
I'm choosing me.

364
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,291
You jerk! I thought we were friends!

365
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,625
-My spot!
-I've been sitting here for years!

366
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:54,375
Well, I'm through running.

367
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:57,208
I'm gonna make sure
we never lose another seal.

368
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,625
-I'm gonna fight back.
-[gasping]

369
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:04,375
Is there anyone here brave, stupid,
or crazy enough to help me?

370
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,083
Actually, this isn't my spot.
You can have it.

371
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,875
Not even Crazy Steve is that crazy.

372
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,416
[blabbers]

373
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,125
And a shark once spat him out
because he tasted too weird.

374
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,958
All right, back to the music.

375
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,666
Please! Stop!
You guys gotta listen to me.

376
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,708
<i>♪ Quinn is never gonna survive ♪</i>

377
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:29,083
<i>♪ Because he's a little crazy ♪</i>

378
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,708
Those stupid seals.

379
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:35,333
Not even stupid enough to fight sharks.

380
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:39,041
[coughs, groans]

381
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,000
Eh?

382
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,833
Eh-heh?

383
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,583
Thanks, Beth.

384
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:48,625
But it's gonna take more than rocks
and searing pain to help me.

385
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:52,041
You need seals brave, stupid,
or crazy enough to fight sharks.

386
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,625
You were there.
How'd it go? Scale of one to ten?

387
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,083
Oh, Quinn.

388
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:59,125
They haven't invented a number
low enough to describe that.

389
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,541
But look on the bright side--

390
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,833
if you want to fight sharks,
you're obviously very, very stupid.

391
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:04,750
Hm.

392
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,375
So you're already a third of the way
to forming your own team.

393
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:10,833
Yeah, you're right.

394
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:13,583
All I need is someone brave and someone...

395
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,208
Beth!

396
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,333
Me?

397
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:22,916
Yeah! You're always helping others!
By forcing them to lick rocks.

398
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,958
And you stare directly at the sun
for hours, so you gotta be tough.

399
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,250
I do have a lot of skills.

400
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:33,208
But fighting sharks is
a little certain death-y for my taste.

401
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,500
I'll get you all the sardines you can eat.

402
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:40,208
If you really wanna die
a horrible death involving sharks,

403
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:41,958
I'm gonna help you achieve your goal.

404
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,208
Yes! Thanks! I think.

405
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,291
All we need now is someone brave.

406
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:50,125
Oh, easy. I know the bravest
seal in the ocean.

407
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,750
Wow, it's a little cold tonight, hm?

408
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:56,416
Hm, it is a bit chilly.

409
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,416
A slightly chilly evening

410
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,250
is nothing for the bravest seal
in the ocean.

411
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,041
What about fighting sharks?

412
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:06,875
Fighting sharks is noth...
Actually, it is quite something.

413
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:09,416
You brave enough to help us do it?

414
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,458
Me? Brave enough?

415
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:14,541
[chuckles]

416
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:21,250
I laugh in the face of danger
so much danger says to me,

417
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,625
"Oh, Great Geraldo,
you hurt my feelings."

418
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:26,833
And then I hold danger
in my arms and I say,

419
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:30,208
"Sorry, I never meant to hurt you."

420
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:34,208
So is that a yes on fighting the sharks?

421
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:38,166
-Perhaps. Perhaps not.
-All a part of your mystique, huh?

422
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,625
[chuckles]
You're a fast learner. I like you.

423
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:44,875
Uh, one question?
How do we fight the sharks?

424
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:47,416
The Great Geraldo
also wonders about this.

425
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,541
But does not care about the answer!

426
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:53,375
I have no idea,
but I know a seal who does.

427
00:26:56,708 --> 00:27:00,041
I found seals brave, stupid,
and, uh, "Beth" enough

428
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,541
to follow me into this mission.

429
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,208
Now will you train us?

430
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:06,041
You're persistent, pup,
I'll give you that.

431
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,625
But only that!

432
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:10,958
This is the most blubbery,
pathetic mess of a team I've ever seen!

433
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,083
You don't look so hot yourself, walrus.

434
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:16,833
[scoffs] And insubordinate, too?
Forget about it!

435
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,458
No. If you don't teach us how to fight,

436
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:24,416
we're gonna eat every can
of sardines on this entire ship.

437
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,166
I can't promise I won't do that anyway.

438
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:29,875
Hmmf.

439
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:35,375
His mystique, it's... magnificent!

440
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:40,833
So, you pups think you have
what it takes to be in the HMMF?

441
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:43,000
-Wait, your team was called "hmmf"?
-Hmmf!

442
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,458
Kinda makes sense, I suppose.

443
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,916
It stands for Hydro-Marine Military Force,

444
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,708
the most elite fighting animals
ever to swim in the ocean.

445
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:52,500
And I don't think you have what it takes.

446
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,125
[grunting]

447
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:03,125
You gotta be fighting fit, on land...

448
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:04,625
and in the water.

449
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:06,833
[gasping]

450
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,625
[thunder rumbling]

451
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:20,000
You gotta have discipline.

452
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:26,625
-You ready to quit?
-[all] Seal, no, seal!

453
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,416
A lie-down would be nice, though.

454
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,250
[Claggart]
You gotta be a master of stealth.

455
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,291
Who said that? [screams]

456
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,041
You gotta learn how to do a thumbs-up.

457
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:41,416
Yeah, we'll come back to this one.

458
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:43,375
You're gonna need...

459
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:47,208
-Air support to spot the enemy!
-Roger that. Over.

460
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:50,458
Shoo, you stupid birds!
This is my training!

461
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:51,958
Now, where were we?

462
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:54,708
You were gonna ask if we're ready to quit.
And we were gonna say...

463
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:57,291
-[all] Seal, no, seal!
-Hmmf!

464
00:28:57,958 --> 00:29:00,375
You're gonna learn pain.

465
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,875
More pain.

466
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:04,625
Pain! Pain, pain, pain, pain!

467
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:07,250
Pain! Pain.

468
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,708
[grunts]

469
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:20,625
You ready to quit?

470
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,500
Never!

471
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:26,541
Huh, you might just be HMMF
material after all.

472
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:27,708
Hmmf!

473
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:31,500
That's the spirit!
But you still have to pass the final test.

474
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,333
What test?

475
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,708
Fighting a shark, of course.

476
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:41,083
Meet the fiercest predator in the ocean.

477
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,625
Bob.

478
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,166
[chuckles]

479
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,416
An inanimate object is no match--
[yelps]

480
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:56,708
Is that all you've got?

481
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:59,958
Internal hemorrhaging is no mat--

482
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:02,000
[grunts]

483
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,750
Bob! Please stop!

484
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,541
-Bob!
-[chuckles]

485
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,666
Touché, Bob.

486
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,166
[groans]

487
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,333
One down, two to go.

488
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:14,750
Next!

489
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:16,125
[grunts]

490
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:22,458
[yawns]

491
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:25,916
Mm-hmm.

492
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,083
[screaming]

493
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:32,916
[grunts]

494
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,791
[grunts]

495
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,250
How did she...?

496
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,666
The secret is the element of surprise--
[yelps]

497
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:49,166
[laughs] Bob, two! Cheeky pups, zero!

498
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:54,208
Now hurry up and fail.
I've got a military-grade nap to get to.

499
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:58,208
[sighs] A seal is no match for a shark.

500
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:00,958
That's why we gotta work together.

501
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:03,666
-Come on, guys.
-Hey! They've had their turn!

502
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,125
You said it yourself.

503
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:07,875
You can only achieve
your mission with a photo.

504
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:09,333
I mean, a team.

505
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,166
Three.

506
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,041
Two.

507
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,500
One!

508
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:24,500
Not bad, pups. Not bad.
Now get some shut-eye.

509
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:27,000
You're in for more P-A-I-N tomorrow.

510
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,583
-P-A-I-...
-That one just means pain.

511
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,625
[mutters]

512
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:42,125
[screams]

513
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,791
Bad boy! Bad, bad boy!

514
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:48,000
[screams, gasps]

515
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,083
Oh.

516
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:52,041
[sighs]

517
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:09,291
-What are you doing out here, pup?
-Nothing.

518
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:12,250
Can't sleep.
Coming up with, uh, strategies.

519
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,458
What are <i>you </i>doing out here?

520
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:17,375
Same thing.

521
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,041
Is it even possible?

522
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,166
Fighting sharks?

523
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,583
Well, it's stupid
and will probably end in death.

524
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:29,625
But that never stopped my old team
from diving into action.

525
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:34,916
Uh, doesn't seem
like that ended super well.

526
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,708
Yeah.

527
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:38,416
What happened to the rest of your team?

528
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:43,333
There was an accident,
and HMMF was disbanded.

529
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:46,458
Dolph went into show business.

530
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:49,375
And our gear expert, Switch,
he went crazy.

531
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,583
-Gear expert?
-Well, more crazy.

532
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:53,291
Crazy enough to fight sharks?

533
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,625
Forget it. Not gonna happen, pup.

534
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:58,708
I already led him on
one starfish-brained mission.

535
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,791
I'm not gonna do it again.

536
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:04,333
Okay, you leave me no choice, then.

537
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,708
-Hey! Give those back!
-Or what?

538
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:10,375
Teach me all of your moves?
Military mistake of the century!

539
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,833
[grunts, groans]

540
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,875
I don't get it.
Your old teammates are out there,

541
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:21,041
but you just sulk here by yourself.

542
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,750
I would do anything to see Benji again.

543
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:38,666
Pick up the pace!
Stragglers will be left behind!

544
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,625
Then captured.
Then left behind again. Then recaptured.

545
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:44,250
Then tail-slapped. Then left behind.

546
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:47,291
Wow, he's particularly hmmf-ish today.

547
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:50,500
He's just nervous because we're
gonna see an old friend of his.

548
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,916
The Great Geraldo also knows this pain.

549
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,916
When I escaped from the aquarium,

550
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,166
using only my wits
and perfectly symmetrical features,

551
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,750
I had to leave my one true love behind:

552
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,958
Magnificent Jing!

553
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:07,375
Shut it, seal!
Anything could be listening.

554
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:10,666
You mean like the biggest shark
you've ever seen in your whole life?

555
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:30,625
Hi. I'm Dave.

556
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:33,333
Uh... are you gonna eat us?

557
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:38,833
Nah. I'm a basking shark.

558
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,625
I only eat plankton.

559
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:43,833
And one time,
a little wooden boy by mistake.

560
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,291
He really liked to sing.

561
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:50,625
But that's cool
'cause I really like to sing, too.

562
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:53,625
My favorite song is the one that goes...

563
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:58,166
Wah, wah, wah, wah-wah, wah.

564
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,958
What's that one called again?

565
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:06,333
Wow. There's worse things
a shark can do than eat you.

566
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:07,750
We're here.

567
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,708
Hold it right there or you're gonna get...

568
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:30,750
the shrimp.

569
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,833
Hello, Switch.

570
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:39,625
Claggart? Is that really you?

571
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:43,666
I haven't seen you since... Boom! Agh!

572
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,208
Yeah, I know.

573
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:48,083
Oh, Claggy!

574
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:51,125
It's been too long, my old friend.

575
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,958
It's good to see you, too, Switch.

576
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:56,458
Sheesh, what's it with you HMMF seals

577
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:58,291
living alone on spooky wrecks?

578
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:02,041
Oh, I'm not alone. No, no, no.
I stay with my old friend, Señor Echo.

579
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:04,583
Is that just your echo?

580
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:08,041
No! No, he's a sophisticated
but aloof gentleman.

581
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:11,166
Señor Echo, say, "Hi, everyone!"

582
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,875
[echoes] Hi, everyone!
Everyone! Everyone! Everyone!

583
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:16,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you...? Is this...?

584
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:18,791
Is the HMMF getting back together?

585
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,708
Uh, not quite.

586
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:22,291
We formed a team to fight sharks.

587
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:25,416
[lights buzzing]

588
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,250
That's a serious RSI.
Did you tell him that's an RSI?

589
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:32,000
Kinda why we're here.
We're gonna need some heavy firepower.

590
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:35,958
Hm. I don't have access
to the HMMF armory anymore.

591
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,458
So I've had to improvise.

592
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:42,958
With some unstable
experimental biotechnology!

593
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:45,625
[echoes]
Unstable experimental biotechnology!

594
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:47,708
Gy-gy-gy!

595
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:50,250
They know, Señor Echo.
They know, they know. I just told them.

596
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,208
[Señor Echo]
Oh, sorry! My bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!

597
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,416

598
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,208
Oh, excuse... Watch out! Watch out!

599
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,375
Electric eel bolts. Just what you need.

600

Puffer mines!

601
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,833
Watches! For synchronizing.

602
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:14,750
Um... what is this?

603
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,666
<i>I love you.</i>

604
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,958
Ugh!

605
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,541
Ooh!

606
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,041
Barazooka!

607
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,083
Yeah. Well, um, that one works,
uh, works better underwater.

608
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,958
And you've already seen the pistol shrimp.

609
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:36,666
-Ah! He's kinda cute!
-No!

610
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,375
Are you insane? That's one of
the most dangerous weapons here.

611
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:42,375
One click of his claw and pow!

612
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:45,458
Anywho, moving swiftly on.

613
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:49,583
Now this one is super exciting.
This is my latest project.

00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:05,750
-[whispers]
-How dare they!

704
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:07,416
What?

705
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:10,625
[whispers]

706
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:14,708
We'll show them.

707
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:18,375
-[whispers]
-That is ridiculous!

708
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:19,916
[whispers]

709
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,666
Oh, yes, of course,
I know seals attacked a shark.

710
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,166
-How do you think I got here?
-All right, sorry.

711
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:31,541
[rumbling]

712
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,500
[squeaking]

713
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,500
Oh, nothing to see here.

714
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:56,625
Go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep.

715
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:09,250
-I'm too talented to be eaten!
-[comical chatter]

716
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:12,083
Mommy, help me!

717
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,333
All right, seals,
your next mission is to party!

718
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:21,083
We took down a shark and didn't die!

719
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:25,250
-Let's see what you got.
-[chittering]

720
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:28,375
Let's bust up the dance floor HMMF style.

721
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:43,333
What's wrong, pup?

722
00:46:43,416 --> 00:46:47,958
Moping around in the shadows is
the one move I didn't want to teach you.

723
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:51,333
Oh, nothing. It's just seeing you guys.

724
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:53,458
It reminded you of your friend.

725
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:56,833
Benji wasn't a friend.
He was a TBFITEO.

726
00:46:56,916 --> 00:46:57,916
Oh.

727
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,208
The Best Friend In The Entire Ocean.

728
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:03,375
See? We'll make a military seal
out of you yet.

729
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:06,875
Benji was loyal, brave.

730
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:09,750
Telling me how stupid my ideas were.

731
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:13,166
Looking out for me, no matter what.

732
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,958
[sighs] That really is a TBFITEO.

733
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:20,000
And... he paid the price for it.

734
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,666
Sharks!

735
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,250
[screeching]

736
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:28,208
They've surrounded Seal Island!

737
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:31,333
Though it could be they just want
a little chit-chat,

738
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:33,750
but I think you guys
made them really angry.

739
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:35,375
-Roger.
-[exclaims]

740
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:37,541
Gear up, team. We're heading out.

741
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:39,375
That's a serious RSI, pup!

742
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:41,666
We barely survived a fight with one shark!

743
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,083
If we caused this, we have to fix it.

744
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:49,291
Not by just rushing in blindly.
That's how you get your friends hurt.

745
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:52,083
Wait, Quinn, uh...

746
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:56,041
I'm gonna save those seals,
with or without your help.

747
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:57,166
Wait, pup.

748
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:02,375
-[screams]
-No! My canapés!

749
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:04,166
How could you do this?

750
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,375
Quinn! I was talking about me.

751
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:10,625
[whimpers]

752
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:13,541
The accident that destroyed
the <i>Good Boy...</i>

753
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:15,958
it was my fault.

754
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:20,791
I cut the wrong wire on a mine because...

755
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:24,583
because I'm colorblind!

756
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:30,583
Um... all seals are colorblind.

757
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:32,041
-What?
-Uh-huh.

758
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:34,500
Yeah, for all I know,
our camouflage could be bright pink.

759
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:38,666
Oh, man. I gotta rethink everything.

760
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,958
You sure? Whoo!

761
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:44,333
[breathes heavily] Brrr!

762
00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:47,291
All right, all right, all right. [exhales]

763
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:48,375
I'm okay.

764
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,458
Ah! I threw my life away!

765
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:54,291
[screams]
It's ruined everything!

766
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:56,000
Whew. [pants]

767
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:57,500
Pull it together.

768
00:48:57,583 --> 00:49:00,583
The point is I was proud, overconfident.

769
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:02,375
And I rushed in without thinking.

770
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,708
My crew... my friends...
they paid the price.

771
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:10,416
Ah, come on.
It's water under the exploded bridge.

772
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,416
We all make mistakes, right?

773
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,250
But you don't have
to make the same ones I did.

774
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:18,666
So, what do we do?

775
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:22,041
The seals are trapped over here
on Sentinel Rock.

776
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:25,000
There are sharks
here, here, here, here, here.

777
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:27,875
Little bit over here.
This one, no, don't go there.

778
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:29,583
There's a shark here, here, here.

779
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:32,666
There was a baby shark over here.
Doo-doo-doo-doo.

780
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,083
Uh, Mommy shark here.
Yep, a shark here.

781
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:37,833
Grandpa shark over here.
He did not look very happy.

782
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:39,541
-There was a shark--
-Okay, we get it!

783
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,958
We got eight hours
before the tide comes in.

784
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:45,000
We need to rescue those seals
without engaging the sharks.

785
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:46,708
Sounds like a job for the...

786
00:49:46,791 --> 00:49:48,583
[deep voice] Octo Suit.

787
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:52,166
Yeah, probably an RSI.

788
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,500
I think I have something else
that could work!

789
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,250
My special formula chum.

790
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:59,250
[groaning]

791
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:03,000
Irresistible for sharks. One drop
will lure them all away from the island.

792
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,291
The sharks are gonna be on us
as soon as we put that stuff in the water.

793
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:06,833
We need a boat.

794
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:08,750
Not this boat, though, right?

795
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:11,166
-Hey, the <i>Good Boy </i>can still sail.
-[clank]

796
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:14,791
You mean in reality,
or in our hearts and minds?

797
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:18,166
The Great Geraldo
knows where we can get a boat.

798
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,916
The harbor near my old aquarium.

799
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,708
It's the last place I saw my great love,
the Magnificent Jing,

800
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:26,750
before I escaped using only my wits.

801
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:28,291
All right! We've got our plan.

802
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:30,958
Get a boat, chum the water,
and rescue the seals.

803
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:34,333
Synchronized watches, in three, two, one.

804
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:37,250
<i>I love you.</i>

805
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,375
I really hate this thing.

806
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:10,458
[snoring]

807
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:13,500
[muttering]

808
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:16,500
-Hey! What are you doing here?
-Locals only!

809
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:19,875
-Get lost, bruh.
-Hmmf. Harbor seals.

810
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:21,291
No honor, no bravery.

811
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:23,708
They just laze around
doing tricks for snacks.

812
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:27,708
You think you can just roll
into our territory and insult us?

813
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:28,875
We'll show you.

814
00:51:30,125 --> 00:51:31,166
Summon...

815
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,875
the Harbor Queen!

816
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:36,208
Summon the Harbor Queen!

817
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:39,083
Uh, who's the Harbor Queen?

818
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:41,500
I don't know,
but she sounds kinda dangerous.

819
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:44,000
Eh, what's she gonna do,
spin a ball on her nose?

820
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:50,416
[grunting]

821
00:51:53,041 --> 00:51:56,791
Give it up. You are no match
for the Great Geraldo.

822
00:51:57,208 --> 00:52:00,333
It is you who is no match

823
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:02,291
for the Magnificent Jing!

824
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,250
Huh?

825
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,166
We need a song to lift our spirits.

826
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:15,791
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf.
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf.

827
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,666
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf.

828
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:21,416
Report back to Grimes.

829
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,458
Yes. Tell her to join
the attack from the north.

830
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:39,000
[whispering]

831
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:41,750
Huh? What do you mean he's lost?

832
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:44,208
Sharks have a built-in navigation system.

833
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:48,625
[sighs] Fine. Left at the reef,
right at the canyon.

834
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,583
And he can't miss it. [grunts]

835
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:55,625
If you give me bad news,
I will eat you right now.

836
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,416
[sighs] Just spit it out already.

837
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,625
[spits]

838
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:01,875
The news!

839
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:06,375
The tide's almost up, but still
no sign of them pesky action seals.

840
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:07,458
Doesn't matter.

841
00:53:07,541 --> 00:53:12,208
As long as they stay out of my way,
the plan will proceed.

842
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:14,208
And if they do show up?

843
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:17,250
Save a bite of the cheeky one for me.

844
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:23,166
No! Right at the reef! Right!

845
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:25,583
Jing! My love!

846
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:27,000
Geraldo!

847
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:31,125
You useless, good-for-nothing,
self-involved coward!

848
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,666
Hold up, is this <i>the </i>Jing?
The one who escaped from the aquarium?

849
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,791
[all] "Using only his wits
and perfectly symmetrical features."

850
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,500
"Escaped"?

851
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:42,083
The Magnificent Jing laughs

852
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:45,083
with all the sarcasm she can muster.

853
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:48,708
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

854
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:51,666
The Great Geraldo notes your sarcasm,
but does not appreciate it.

855
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:55,041
Ugh. Two of them. Help me.

856
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:57,500
Please, my love,
we do not have time for this.

857
00:53:57,583 --> 00:54:00,916
No one is going anywhere
until he tells the truth.

858
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,958
-I...
-Please be dramatic.

859
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:04,958
I...

860
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:10,708
Escaping the aquarium was Jing's plan.

861
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:15,250
-But I... I couldn't go through with it!
-[all gasp]

862
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:17,458
I am not disappointed.

863
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:20,458
As unbelievably difficult
as that is to believe,

864
00:54:20,541 --> 00:54:24,250
the Great Geraldo was scared of...

865
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:25,250
Love... Love...

866
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:27,166
I hate this stupid watch!

867
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:30,625
-This... this stupid watch! I hate it!
-Love... Love...

868
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:34,083
So, if Jing's the one who's all brave,
smart, and symmetrically featured,

869
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:36,333
how did you escape the aquarium?

870
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:39,000
I was thrown out.

871
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:43,333
Without the Magnificent Jing,
our show was an absolute failure.

872
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:47,750
We always were better as a duet, my love.

873
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:50,208
<i>Were </i>. Past tense.

874
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:53,625
[glass cracking]

875
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,708

01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:24,458
You know what? The next time
anyone wants to speak,

1053
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:25,958
raise your fin.

1054
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:27,041
Now where was I?

1055
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:30,333
Every year,
seals head out for the sardine run.

1056
01:08:30,416 --> 01:08:33,791
And every year, we eat our fill.
Who do we catch?

1057
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:35,208
The old, the slow,

1058
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:38,416
and that weird-tasting seal
that's frothing at the mouth.

1059
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,166
-Ew, gross!
-That guy's the worst flavor!

1060
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,833
Hey! What did I just say?

1061
01:08:43,791 --> 01:08:47,916
But as a team we'll make sure
no seal is left behind.

1062
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,625
Because we'll eat them all!

1063
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:54,916
[sighs] Yes?

1064
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,541
Could I eat two seals?

1065
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:58,041
More.

1066
01:08:58,125 --> 01:08:59,500
Five seals?

1067
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:00,625
More!

1068
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:02,166
Seven seals?

1069
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:05,250
You will eat as many seals
as you can count!

1070
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:08,041
Huh, huh, huh. Seven seals!

1071
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:11,041
[cheering]

1072
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:19,333
Uh, Guys?
We have a little problem.

1073
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:22,416
-[grunts]
-Eat seals for breakfast.

1074
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,833
Seals for second breakfast.

1075
01:09:24,916 --> 01:09:27,000
Seals for elevenses.

1076
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:29,000
Seals for luncheon.

1077
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:31,583
-Seals for afternoon tea!
-[squeals]

1078
01:09:31,666 --> 01:09:33,208
-Seals for dinner!
-Hm.

1079
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:35,291
Seals for supper.

1080
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:37,083
Seals, seals, seals!

1081
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:38,750
[chittering]

1082
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:42,041
Hold it together, guys.
Just a little bit longer!

1083
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:44,666
Let me out! He's over here!

1084
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:52,666
[whirring]

1085
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:01,000
Uh...

1086
01:10:01,083 --> 01:10:02,916
Activate countermeasures?

1087
01:10:04,041 --> 01:10:05,750
Oh, right, I gotta do the voice.

1088
01:10:05,833 --> 01:10:07,916
[deep voice]
Activate countermeasures!

1089
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:35,166
[Grimes]
Hello there, little fella.

1090
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:39,125
You're a bit early for the feast,

1091
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:41,958
but I can always have a pre-dinner snack.

1092
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:43,958
Yeah, I get that.
You must be pretty hungry

1093
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:47,541
after monologuing for, like, seven hours.

1094
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,416
How do you guys deal with the boredom?

1095
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,250
Staring into the distance.

1096
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:52,750
I do crossword puzzles.

1097
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:54,291
Plotting betrayal, mostly.

1098
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,250
First, I'm gonna stop you.

1099
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:59,625
Then I'm gonna tail-slap
that stupid smile right off your face!

1100
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:08,500
<i>We're </i>gonna tail slap
that stupid smile off your face!

1101
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:12,083
Ooh! You brought me more friends to eat.

1102
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:15,833
But you're not the only ones
with reinforcements.

1103
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:23,500
Any ideas?

1104
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:27,625
Get outta here. I'll keep 'em busy.

1105
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:30,708
[chuckles] I thought I was
the one with the stupid plans.

1106
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:37,583
Uh-uh. No. Forget it. No way.

1107
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:39,166
Listen to me, pup.

1108
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:42,250
When we met, I was an empty wreck.

1109
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:44,583
I'd given up on everything.

1110
01:11:45,916 --> 01:11:47,083
But you.

1111
01:11:47,166 --> 01:11:51,291
You're crazy, stupid and brave enough
to never surrender.

1112
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:54,583
You'll always be there for your friends.

1113
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:57,208
That's why you gotta get out of here.

1114
01:11:57,291 --> 01:12:01,250
No! Please! [sighs] I can't.

1115
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:05,708
I believe in you, pup.
You are natural-born HMMF.

1116
01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:07,333
Come on!

1117
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:08,750
[laughs]

1118
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:16,666
No! I'm never leaving him!

1119
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:19,833
If we stay here, we're all done for!

1120
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:23,000
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain!

1121
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:25,958
You're gonna have
an honorary doctorate in pain!

1122

[whimpering]

1127
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:53,833
I lost him again, guys.

1128
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:56,791
Quinn, where you going?

1129
01:12:56,875 --> 01:12:59,708
The sharks are planning an ambush
during the sardine run.

1130
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:01,583
I need to warn everyone.

1131
01:13:01,666 --> 01:13:02,750
What's the plan?

1132
01:13:04,916 --> 01:13:05,916
There isn't one.

1133
01:13:07,791 --> 01:13:10,541
Everyone keeps paying for my stupid ideas.

1134
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:14,250
Benji. Claggart.

1135
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,083
One of you will be next.

01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,375
All right, Team Beth!

1137
01:13:20,458 --> 01:13:22,666
We're gonna find
a way to stop those sharks!

1138
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:25,041
Hey! Since when are we Team Beth?

1139
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:27,166
No questions allowed on Team Beth!

Stop! Everybody, come back!

1150
01:14:07,416 --> 01:14:09,625
Quinn? What are you shouting about?

1151
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:12,375
We've gotta stop them.
The sharks are waiting.

1152
01:14:12,458 --> 01:14:14,458
-They're what?
-[shouts] The sharks!

1153

I don't have time for this.

Quinn.

1156
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:23,291
Can I tell you a secret?

1157
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,041
There are sharks out there.

1158
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:30,625
-Really?
-You know why I don't admit it?

1159
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:34,375
Out there you might not come back.

1160
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:36,708
I might not come back.

1161
01:14:37,416 --> 01:14:39,875
But the community will survive.

1162
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,958
If we don't go on the sardine run,
everyone will starve.

Oh, things got out of hand,
so quickly without you!

1169
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:20,500
We were training with Bob, and
next thing I knew, he had taken over!

1170
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:22,916
Bob... can be very persuasive.

1171
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,333
Why did you come back?

1172
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:28,416
The seals have already left
for the sardine run.

1173
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,000
Gotta try to protect them.

Let's do this.

-What do you mean "gone"?

-AWOL, Roger.
-What they said.

Here's the island.

1181
01:15:57,166 --> 01:15:59,000
This is where the sardines will come past.

Whatever you do, don't make eye contact.

1185
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:43,583
Uh... I thought the point of this thing
was to not get eaten by sharks?

-Actually, I only eat plankton.

We wait for the tasty seals
to pass overhead.

1212
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:34,666
And then, when they're
cut off from the island...

1213
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:37,041
[sniffs] ...we attack.

1214
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:42,458
This year, no one's coming back
from the sardine run.

the chain with my teeth. Ah.

Sorry, sorry.

[snaps teeth]

1232
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,750
Go, my love.

1233

No ways.

1234
01:19:56,750 --> 01:20:00,625
I have spent my whole life
proclaiming my bravery

1235
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:04,708
but being a coward when it really counts.

1236
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:06,083
[shouts] Not today!

1237
01:20:06,166 --> 01:20:10,083
If you don't come back, I will find you.

1238
01:20:10,166 --> 01:20:11,875
And I will hurt you!

1239
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:14,833
I wouldn't expect any less, my love.

1240
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:22,750
[grunts] This puny door

1241
01:20:22,833 --> 01:20:26,708
is no match for the Great Geraldo!

1242
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:30,958
Sorry, my friends.

1243
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:38,541

-This way!
-Not this way!

[roars]

1247
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:17,666
Why, hello there, little fellas.

1248
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:19,708
Shut it, you creep!

1249
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:22,791
Why always the eyes? [grunts]

1250
01:21:22,875 --> 01:21:26,458
First, I'm gonna eat
every seal you've ever met.

1251
01:21:26,541 --> 01:21:28,958
Then I'll be back for you.

1252
01:21:29,916 --> 01:21:31,916

01:21:42,791 --> 01:21:44,791
[screaming]

1254
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,208
No! No!

1255
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:55,083
No.

1256
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:57,708
[sighs]

1257
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,875
It's over, isn't it?

[sighs]

1259
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:05,000
For all of us.

1260
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:06,708
Well, this mission did have

1261
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:10,208
that classic, uh,
certain death-y kind of feel to it.

1262
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:13,458
[sniffs] Then why'd you come?

1263
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:16,458
Because of you, dummy.

1264
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:23,041
My whole life I believed that it was
every Beth for themselves.

1265
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:27,875
Then some starfish-brained idiot
showed me another way.

1266
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:31,791
A very stupid way. But a better way.

1267
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:36,416
[chuckles]
We gotta look out for each other.

1268
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,625
-No...
-Matter...

1269
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:41,541
What? Oh, oh! What.

1270
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:43,166
Come on.

1271
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:46,666
Let's see if we can take down
a few of those sharks with us.

Told you a puny door is
no match for the Great Geraldo.

1275
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:57,708
[muffled] Whoo-hoo!

1276
01:22:57,791 --> 01:22:59,333
Why are we swimming?

Yeee-haw! Yeah, okay, maybe
I shouldn't have done this!

Ow!

Prepare to have your fins handed to you!

And the Magnificent Jing! [chuckles]

01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:36,166
You're surrounded.

You're outnumbered.

1304
01:25:38,041 --> 01:25:39,833
You're about to be food.

1305
01:25:39,916 --> 01:25:44,041
Give it up, little fella. You can't win.

1306
01:25:44,125 --> 01:25:46,666
[sighs] I know.

1307
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:50,458
But we're brave, stupid
and crazy enough to try anyway.

1308
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:06,666
Sorry I'm late.
I had to fetch reinforcements.
