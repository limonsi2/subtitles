00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,500
[wind blowing]

4
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,333
[suspenseful music playing]

5
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,750
[narrator] Though many know
the tragic love story

6
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,541
of Antony and Cleopatra,

7
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,625
the wayward Roman general

8
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,833
who fell madly in love
with the enchanting Egyptian queen,

9
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,916
both of them taking their lives

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,083
rather than face a world
without each other,

11
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,041
few know the secret story

12
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:09,500
of the most sought-after prize
and unsolved puzzle of their time.

13
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,625
The mystery of Cleopatra's third egg.

14
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:17,541
On their wedding day,
as a symbol of his undying devotion,

15
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:21,625
Mark Antony presented Cleopatra
with three bejeweled eggs,

16
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:24,166
each one more exquisite than the last.

17
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:29,750
For centuries, these eggs were thought
to be nothing more than myth, rumor.

18
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,041
But then, in 1907,

19
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:36,625
just outside of Cairo,
a local farmer unearthed two of them.

20
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,833
Some say the third egg was never found.

21
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,708
Others claim it was discovered,

22
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:45,791
but just as quickly lost,
never to be seen again.

23
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:49,166
Join us as we explore that very question.

24
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,791
What happened to Cleopatra's lost egg?

25
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,833
Who may hold it in their possession?

26
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,916
And most importantly,
will we ever see the day in which

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,208
all three eggs are reunited
for the first time in over 2,000 years?

28
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:06,375
Cleopatra's first egg
is on display for all to see

29
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:10,333
at the world-famous Museo Nazionale
di Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome.

30
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:13,875
The second egg has been
sold at auction numerous times

31
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,375
and currently is held
in a private collection.

32
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,625

00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,166

36
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,666
[brakes screeching]

37
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,208
[indistinct chatter]

38
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,375
You're not a cop.

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,041
You're right, I'm not.

40
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,500
You know what I mean, Agent.
Your badge is no good here.

41
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,208
So no American cowboy stuff.

42
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,083
Don't worry. Left my chaps at home.

43
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,625
You sure about this?

44
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,541
I know how he thinks.
He's gonna do it today. Trust me.

45
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,041
All right, then, here we go.

46
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:36,458
[woman speaking Italian]

47
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,666
-[man in English] Impossible.
-I'm not asking.

48
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,166
You need to shut the museum down,
evacuate your visitors,

49
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,458
and seal all ingress
and egress points immediately.

50
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,000
And Interpol has the authority
to compel me to do so?

51
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,500
Don't test me, Director.

52
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,625
You should listen to her.

53
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,208
And who are you? Her bodyguard?

54
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,791
This is Special Agent John Hartley
of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit.

55
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,791
He's a consulting profiler
who specializes in art crime.

56
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,166
You don't look like a profiler.

57
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,958
Yeah, I get that a lot.

58
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,541
Forty-one hours ago, Agent Hartley
received credible intelligence that

59
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:10,000
the most wanted art thief in the world,
a man named Nolan Booth,

60
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,583
intends to steal
the Egg of Cleopatra today.

61
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,750
Who provided you this information?

62
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,833
The Bishop.

63
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,458
You cannot be serious.

64
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:23,125
My dear, The Bishop is nothing more
than a boogeyman story in the art world.

65
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,250
It's a catch-all concept.
It's someone to blame

66
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,041
when you and your friends
in law enforcement

67
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,541
are too incompetent to solve the case.

68
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:33,208
Listen to me, unless we stop it,
that egg is gonna be stolen today.

69
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,000
In fact, it may already be gone.

70
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,333
[guard speaking Italian]

71
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,416
[regal musical flourish]

72
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,416
[in English] Already gone, you say?

73
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:58,833
Now, if you'll excuse me, Inspector,
I believe I owe your supervisor a call.

74
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you have thermal sensors in this room?

75
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,041
-Of course we do.
-Show it to me.

76
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,833
[director] You're wasting our time.

77
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,708
What, may I ask, are you looking for?

78
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,333
Well, you see, Cleopatra's first egg
is covered in 18-karat gold.

79
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,916
And gold reflects radiation.

80
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,958
That egg should be
reflecting the heat in this room.

81
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,833
It should be red, not blue.

82
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,541
It's probably just an error
in the thermal sensor.

83
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,500
Well, there's only one way to find out.

84
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:46,583
Hey, sorry, big man, but there's
no food or drink in the museum.

85
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,541
Thank you.

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,083
No, no, wait a moment.
What do you think you're doing?

87
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,083
[woman] Relax, it's fine.
He knows what he's doing.

88
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,291
[crowd murmuring]

89
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,541
[crowd gasping]

90
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,541
[sizzling]

91
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,666
Seal the room. Now!

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,458
-[alarm blaring]

93
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,083

[people screaming]

95
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,083
Move! Move!

96
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,583
He's heading for the exit.

97
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,291

98
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,666

102
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:57,875
Oh.

103
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,833
[device emitting high-pitched sound]

104
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:05,958
Freeze!

105
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,333
[people screaming]

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,708

[both panting]

109
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,041
[guard 1 in Italian] He is here.
Send reinforcements.

110
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,083
[panting]

111
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,291

[guard 2 grunts]

119
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,416
He's on the scaffolding.

120
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,375
We're gonna need more-- [grunts]

121
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,875

-[chuckling] Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Ah. [tuts]

131
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,208
[in English] Jesus,
you scared me. [chuckles]

132
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,833
I know you. You're the… You're the slow
bald guy that's been chasing me.

133
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,291
What do you got in the bag?

134
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,125
You're American. What brings you to Rome?

135
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,000
Gelato, the Colosseum.

136
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,791
-Oh, it's beautiful. Beautiful place.
-Yeah.

137
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,833
-First time?
-Yep.

138
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:42,583
[Booth] That was a fun foot chase, right?
Lots of twists and turns. Hijinks.

139
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,875
Who knew it'd end up like this?

140
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,833
-I did.
-Right.

141
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,750
Fun's over, Nolan Booth.
Give me the bag, turn around,

142
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,833
put your hands behind your back.
You're under arrest.

143
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,875
Okay. Well, hold on one sec.
I just have two questions.

144
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,458
Okay. Um…

145
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,125
First question,
where'd you get that jacket?

146
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,458
It's a statement piece.

147
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,916
Somewhere there is a very nude cow
whispering…

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,958
[whispers] …"Worth it."

149
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,541
And number two, on the whole
arresting me thing, I totally get it.

150
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,208
You know, baby did a bad, bad thing. Yeah.

151
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,250
But you don't happen to have,
like, a badge or somethin'

152
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,791
tucked away in the turtleneck, do you?

153
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,708
I don't need to show you my badge
because I've got a gun.

154
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,750
Here's the thing.
You're putting me in a pickle.

155
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,791
Without identification,
how do I know who you are?

156
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,666
For all I know, you could be the bad guy,

157
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,291
and I could be the other bad guy.

158
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,875
You're right. I am the bad guy.

159
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,750
Now shut up and give me the bag
before I shoot you in the mouth.

160
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,083
-I'm gonna give this to you.
-[Hartley] Good.

161
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,750
Yeah, I'm just gonna give it to you
'cause I don't even want it.

162
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,750
For the record, none of this feels good.

163
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,000
Booth, don't move!

164
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,083

Special Agent John Hartley, FBI.
We met earlier.

Aren't you a little outside
your jurisdiction?

204
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,083
I am.

205
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,791

Wow!

209
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,666
Hi, guys.
Don't take your shoes off or anything.

210
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,208
You sure you brought enough guns?

211
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,250
What can I say? I like to be thorough.

212
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,041
[Booth] No way, José.

213
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,791
-The intrepid Inspector Das.
-[scoffs]

214
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:34,375
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
I'll take that. Thank you.

215
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,833
-It's nice to meet a fan.
-[Das] Oh, that's cute.

216
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,583
You wanna know what else is cute?

217
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,750
Because you're wanted
in 18 separate countries,

218
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,083
I get to choose which one of them
detains you until trial,

219
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,583
given your escape history.

220
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,833
What are you, six for six now?

221
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah. One more
and I get a Shawshank jacket.

222
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:48,958
Keep making your jokes

223
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,416
because I'm about to send you
to the worst place in the world.

224
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,708
Your Instagram account?

225
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,875
You know,
I'm really starting to not like you.

226
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,166
Oh, come on!

227
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,583
Not like me? You don't even know me.

228
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,791
We could have a lot in common.

229
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:05,625
[scoffs] Maybe I don't know you,
but I've been building a profile on you,

230
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,625
ever since you stole William Strang's
Lady with a Red Hat from the Tate

231
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,958
back in 2014.

232
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,375
You can't prove that was me.

233
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,416
I got that on Etsy.

234
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,625
I've been tracking
your scores for a while.

235
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,041
So let me take a crack
at who I think you really are.

236
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:26,916
Sure thing. Yeah.

237
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,333
-Only child.
-Mmm-hmm.

238
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,375
[Hartley] Dad's a Swiss cop,
Mom's an American professor.

239
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,708
You started stealing
between the ages of six and eight.

240
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,791
You found out
you had a real talent for it.

241
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,750
It made you feel special, different.

242
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,583
You like to work alone.
You don't like a team.

243
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,708
The only jobs you take are the ones
that make the big, splashy headlines,

244
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:51,833
which tells me that you only do it
for the thrill and not the money.

245
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,458
Are you insane? I love the money.

246
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,750
I'm not done yet.
I'm just getting to the good part.

247
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,208
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

248
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,250
A lot of thieves out there
who claim to only do it for the money.

249
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,625
That's not unusual.

250
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,375
But what is unusual
is the risk that you take.

251
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,250
The chances.

252
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:15,916
It's as though you wanna get caught
so you can escape,

253
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,791
just to prove yourself all over again,

254
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,416
and prove that
you're better than everybody else

255
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,833
and that you're worthy.

256
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,583
Worthy of what? This speech?

257
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,041
Your father's love.

258
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,750
Congratulations.

259
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,458
How'd you find me?

260
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,708
Well, the same way I knew that
you were gonna steal the egg in Rome.

Booth, I'm curious.

How does it feel to be sold out
by the most wanted art thief in the world?

267
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,500
I'm the most wanted art thief
in the world.

268
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:17,708
You were.

269
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,291
[Das] Wait. Wait here.

270
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,500
There's no chance I'm putting
that thing in the same van as him.

271
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,166

283
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,416
You could say that. Hmm.

284
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,000
Okay. What's going on?

285
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,375
[chuckles] Funny,
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

286
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,083
What are you doing with that?

287
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:32,125

290
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,583
Oops!

291
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,166
Booth gave us a fake egg.

292
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,500
I'll admit,
Booth was my first thought too.

293
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,750
Then I asked myself,
"How well do you really know someone

294
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,708
you only met 72 hours ago?"

295
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,458
And someone whose official credentials

296
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,083
came solely by
a written interagency communiqué.

297
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:57,875
So I called up the Assistant Director
of the BAU at Quantico, really nice lady.

298
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,083
She'd never heard of you.

299
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,708
-That's impossible.
-[Das] Is it?

300
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,875
Yes, it's impossible.

301
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,166
As impossible as a John Hartley
with a Swiss bank account

302
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,458
that received an $8 million wire transfer

303
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,500
from an encrypted third-party
on the same day the egg was stolen?

304
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,875
Quite a coincidence,
wouldn't you say, Agent?

305
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,791
[officer 1 shouting in Italian]

306
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,958
[officer 2 over radio]
We have eyes on target.

307
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,875
Listen, whatever you think this is,
whatever you think I did, I didn't do.

308
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,333
Someone's behind this.
The Bishop, maybe even Booth himself.

309
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,458
-I'm being set up.
-Maybe you are, maybe you're not.

310
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,958
Until I figure it out,
I'm gonna keep you where I can find you.

311
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,416
Now, normally,
I'm not a vindictive person, but,

312
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,250
well, I trusted you
and you hurt my feelings.

313
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,458
So I picked someplace extra special.

314
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,500
It's a bit of a black site.
Kind of the land due process forgot.

315
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,750
You're under arrest, Agent Hartley.

316
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,083
Das, look at me. Look at my eyes.

317
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,791
I didn't do this.

318
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,708
I don't believe you.

You a top or a bottom? [grunts]

323
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,500
Doesn't matter.
Prison's gonna decide for us.

324
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:01,833
You gotta be shittin' me.

325
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,583
[Booth] Well, I'll say one thing
about ol' Inspector Das,

326
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:05,958
she's got a real sense of humor.

327
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,833
Put 'er there, roomie.

328
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,708
You're right, we should wash up first.

329
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,708
It's okay. You're safe here.

330
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:19,666
Except if they find out you're a cop.
Then they're gonna wanna kill you.

331
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,041
[alarm buzzing]

332
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:27,625
[indistinct chatter]

333
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:31,125
[Booth] Bishop must have seen you
coming from a mile away.

334
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,125
Got your trust after selling me out.

335
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:36,541
Can't run a con without gaining
the mark's trust first, that's page one.

336
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,500
I know how a confidence scheme works,
trust me.

337
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,666
[Booth] Well, you do now, that's for sure.

338
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,000
The same mystery thief who ratted me out
is the same one who framed you.

339
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,958
That seems like a coincidence,
don't you think?

340
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:50,083
This is not a coincidence. This is a plan.

341
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:54,166
In one move, The Bishop took out
her lead competitor and lead investigator.

342
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,541
-Two birds, one stone.
-Egg.

343
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:59,041
-What?
-Two birds, one egg.

344
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,625
It's kind of a lay-up.
Even Post Malone gets it.

345
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,791
This is farm-to-table, right? Thank you.

346
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,500
I don't understand why.

347
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,750
Why would The Bishop go to the trouble of
framing me when she already has the egg?

348
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,166
I mean, what's left?

349
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,166
Three hundred million dollars?

350
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,958
You're kidding.
I never heard of a price tag like that.

351
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:17,958
No one has.

352
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,000
But you don't understand,
that's not the price for just one egg.

353
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:22,750
Here's the deal.

354
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:26,375
Whoever brings
this Egyptian billionaire all three eggs

355
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:30,583
by the night of his daughter's wedding
gets all the marbles.

356
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:33,958
Turns out,
Mr. Big Daddy Big Bucks' daughter,

357
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,166
guess what her name is?

358
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,666
Stop guessing, it's Cleopatra.

359
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:41,458
I mean, these people are horrible.
But I like money, so…

360
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,208
So how does that work?

361
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:46,458
No one knows where the third egg is.
It's never been found.

362
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:49,833
I'm not gonna lie,
that's a bit of a problem.

363
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:51,958
I was gonna deal with
the second egg first.

364
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,333
Then the rest.

365
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:56,666
[sighs] All right, well,
Bureau intel says that the second egg

366
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,458
is owned by an international arms dealer.

367
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,250
Sotto Voce. I know all about this guy.

368
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,666
His dad tried to strangle him
when he was 14.

369
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,041
Nobody can stand
this son of a bitch. [chuckles]

370
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,125
Apparently, it left
quite the impression on him.

371
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:11,500
And strangling folks
became sort of a hobby for him.

372
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,291
He's a big fan.

373
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,625
[man choking]

374
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:17,041
[Booth] Sotto Voce is super scary.

375
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:18,666
But he's not above having a good time.

376
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,000
Throws a masquerade party every year
for his top buyers

377
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,208
in his I-probably-have-a-tiny-penis villa
in Valencia.

378
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,500
Gunrunners are a little touchy
about their identity.

379
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,958
So the Eyes Wide Shut thing
takes the edge off for everyone.

380
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:34,000
Now, what none of these
evil one-percenters know

381
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,583
is that upstairs,
locked away in a secret vault,

382
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:39,458
Dr. Shirtless has in his possession

383
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:42,375
an ancient piece of pricelessness
that I like to call…

384
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,541
Cleopatra's second egg.

385
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,875
And it's just begging for me to steal it.

386
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:52,708
I'd be on my way there right now
if you weren't such a super cop.

387
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,000
-Don't do that.
-[whispers] What?

388
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,708
-Don't do that.
-[whispers] Do what?

389
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:01,416
-I know what you're doing. Listen.
-[whispers] I'm not doing anything.

390
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,750
[whispering] These guys here,
if they find out you're a C-O-P…

391
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:08,250
This is a room full of convicted murderers
and toilet vodka enthusiasts.

392
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,416
We gotta make sure
they know you're not a cop.

393
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,791
-[yelling] Nyet politsiya.
-[in English] Listen to me. I beg…

394
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,958
Guys? Nyet politsiya. Not a cop.

395
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:21,458
This man is not a cop, all right?

396
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:23,625
Get that through
your thick skulls right now!

397
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:26,375
He's a profiler for the FBI,

398
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:30,416
which does fall under the umbrella
of law enforcement, but not a cop.

399
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,916
It's similar, but it's not the same thing.
It's a complicated backstory.

400
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,666
This is our good friend,
Special Agent John Hartley.

401
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,208
Let's give him a warm welcome
to the prison, guys.

402
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:40,916
[prisoner 1 clears throat]

403
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,916
[prisoner 2 coughs]

404
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:48,000
Thank you, guys. [whispering]
I don't think anyone heard me. We're good.

405
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,833
All's quiet on the western front.

406
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:52,166
-Nobody's… Oh, no.
-[objects clattering]

407
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,375
[Booth] Yep.
Drago Grande heard. Here he comes.

408
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,291
[whispering] Okay, be cool.
Don't embarrass me.

409
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:03,958
[normally] Hello, sir.

410
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,500
Politsiya.

411
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:09,375
You die.

412
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:11,125
[whispering] Okay, he knows.

413
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:13,125
He knows you're a cop.

414
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:14,791
The jig is up.

415
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:24,916
[all exclaiming]

416
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,083
[whispering] It's okay.

417
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,375
You can…

418
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:31,458
You can have mine.
You need some nourishment.

419
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:36,833
[all exclaiming]

420
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:40,000
[whispering] You should get up.
You look like a little bitch right now.

421
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,416
I say that as a friend.

422
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,416
[Hartley sighs]

423
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:46,958
Okay, look.

424
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,083
I don't wanna do
the whole prison fight thing with you…

425
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:54,375
-[soft] You got this. I'm in your corner.
-So please, no fight.

426
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:56,750
Let's just go back and finish our meals.

427
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,583
[both grunting]

428
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,125
[grunts, groans]

429
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,208
[all cheering]

430
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:13,708
-No. No--
-[guard in Russian] Back to your cell!

431
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,958
[Booth in English] God…

432
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,458
All that working out.

433
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:21,750
You still get your ass spanked
by a toothless man with tuberculosis--

434
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,958
Okay. Okay.

435
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:27,083
If you ever pull shit like that again,
it'll be the last thing you do.

436
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,250
Right.

437
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,625
-You don't know me, Booth.
-No.

438
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,291
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

439
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:34,416
Okay. Thank God, you're here.

440
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,750
[in Russian] The captain wants to see you.

441
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:38,666
Let's go!

442
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,875
[in English] Him?

443
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:41,583
Oh, no, us. Okay.

444
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:50,666
[Booth sighs]

445
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:54,708
Hello, boys.

446
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:56,625
Oh, my God.

447
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:57,791
Wow.

448
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,250
You're the captain?

449
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:03,250
You might benefit
from a little career change. [chuckles]

450
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,208
I mean, I'm… I don't think runway,

451
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:08,250
but definitely
regional catalog work, fliers…

452
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,333
She's The Bishop.

453
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,958
No shit, dipdick!

454
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,208
It's so nice to finally meet you,
Mr. Booth.

455
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,916
Such a thrill to be face-to-face

456
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,416
with the second-best art thief
in the world.

457
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,875
Oh, I see what you did there.
That's… [chuckles]

458
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:28,083
Yeah, you got lucky
a couple of times early on, you know?

459
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,250
But you can't name one time
in the past year that you beat me.

460
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,041
-Helsinki.
-My parachute failed.

461
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,041
Jakarta.

462
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:36,166
-My Segway sank.
-Macau.

463
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,208
Nobody knew that Miley Cyrus
was going to be there.

464
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:39,916
It was a completely unannounced show.

465
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,875
You can have excuses or results.

466
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,625
-[whispers] Not both.
-[scoffs]

467
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:46,791
What are we doing here? What do you want?

468
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,750
To have a chat.

469
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,166
First of all, Agent Hartley,

470
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:54,041
please accept my sincerest apologies
for the whole mix-up in Rome.

471
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,666
You see, after I stole the egg in Bali,

472
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:01,958
I then made an $8 million deposit
into an account registered in your name.

473
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:06,916
Then, all I had to do was sit back
and wait for Das to take the bait.

474
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,666
[cell phone ringing]

475
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,541
A few clever keystrokes
and a well-timed call intercept.

476
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,791
[The Bishop] FBI BAU Director's office.

477
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,958
And poof. [gasps]

478
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:19,333
[mockingly] Bye-bye, Agent John Hartley.

479
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,583
Hello, suspicious suspect.

480
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:24,333
Funny, don't you think?

481
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:26,125
[laughing]

482
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:28,083
Shut up. You deleted my life.

483
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,208
And now I'm stuck in a cell
with this idiot.

484
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:34,041
Well, down to business then.

485
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,750
At the risk of stating the obvious,

486
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,375
I have the first egg in my possession,

487
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:43,666
and in less than 48 hours,
I'm gonna have the second one as well.

488
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:49,416
But that leaves an issue. The final egg.

489
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,000
Well, too bad for you.
Nobody knows where the third egg is.

490
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:54,166
He didn't tell you?

491
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,125
You didn't tell him?

492
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:59,000
-Didn't tell me what?
-I don't know what she's talking about.

493
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,458
Your cellmate here
knows exactly where the third egg is.

494
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,833
She's lying. I do not know
where the third egg is. I swear to God.

495
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:08,208
[Booth] I know where the third egg is.
I swear to God.

496
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,291
Yes, that is me. Scratch that.
That was me. I did say that.

497
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:14,625
When were you gonna tell me
about the third egg?

498
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:18,000
I was never gonna tell you
about the third egg because you're a cop.

499
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:20,458
[The Bishop]
My offer to you, Mr. Booth, is this.

500
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:24,750
Tell me where the third egg is,
I'll get you out of here and give you 10%.

501
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:26,041
Rock-hard pass.

502
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,125
I'm sorry we couldn't do business.

503
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:31,166
Well, perhaps a few more days in here

504
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,125
with the prospect
of thousands more to come

505
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:37,875
will help change your mind. [chuckles]

506
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,916
I'll stop by once I have the second egg.

507
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:44,625
Oh, and when I do,
the offer's gonna be 5%.

508
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:48,291
[in Russian] Thank you, Captain.
Labor detail for them both.

509
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:52,625
[in English] Bye. Don't miss me too much.

510
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:53,916
Ta-ta!

511
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,083
Oh, hey, guys. [chuckles] Okay!

512
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,958
[Hartley]
If we work together to catch her,

513
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,333
I can do things
to The Bishop you can't do.

514
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:05,000
[Booth]
There's no need to be disgusting.

515
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,541
[both grunting]

516
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,916
Here we go. Three, two, one.
Lift with your neck.

517
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,250
I mean put her in prison. For life.

518
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:18,625
When that happens, guess who becomes
number one art thief in the world again?

519
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:23,708
Teamwork? It feels weird in my mouth.

520
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:24,875
Are you carrying your side?

521
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,833
-I'm offended you'd even ask me that.
-[grunting]

522
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:30,750
-Do something. It's slipping.
-Oh, relax, baldylocks.

523
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:32,500
[grunts]

524
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:38,041
See? Teamwork.

525
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:43,208
Team. Team. Team.
[chuckling] It feels weird in my mouth.

526
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,125
It does.

527
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:49,083
Say what you will about Russian prisons,
the soap is incredible.

528
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,875
-Are we doing this together or not?
-No added chemicals or perfumes.

529
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:54,500
It's just pure
good ol' fashioned glycerin.

530
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:58,083
-Ooh. Smell it.
-I'm not gonna smell it.

531
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,791
Sotto Voce's masquerade ball
is tomorrow night,

532
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:03,250
which means, if we're gonna beat
The Bishop to the second egg,

533
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:06,291
we have to be on the other side
of these walls by tomorrow morning.

534
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,875
I already know how I'm gonna steal it.

535
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:10,791
It'll take adjustment now The Bishop'll
be there, but I'll beat her to the punch.

536
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:13,083
"I"? What about "we"?

537
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:16,041
Why are you wearing the hairnet?
You're bald.

538
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,625
Okay, fine. You can be my plus-one
to Sotto Voce's party.

539
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:27,583
[Hartley] Thanks. Clock's tickin'.
We gotta get outta here. What's the plan?

540
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,250
[Booth] I'm working on it.

541
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,166
You're working on it?
You sound like you're working on it.

542
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,583
They say the most important part
of any plan is a good night's sleep.

543
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:40,666
Isn't the actual plan part
the most important part of the plan?

544
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,541
A lotta people make that mistake.

545
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:50,583
Back in Bali, that thing you said,

546
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,916
about me and my father, how'd you know?

547
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,625
I hate to break it to you,
but you're not a complex case.

548
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:01,208
The one thing
that doesn't quite line up for me is

549
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:04,958
how the son of a Swiss police captain
turns to a life of high crime.

550
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,083
Short version?

551
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:11,833
My father was a prolific asshole.

552
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:13,875
Long version?

553
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,125
When I was eight years old,

554
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:21,083
my dad thought I stole his watch.

555
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:24,125
He loved that piece of metal
more than anything.

556
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:29,000
He asked me if I stole it.
I told him I didn't.

557
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:32,625
He said he knew that I had
and that I was lying.

558
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:35,708
He didn't speak to me again after that.

559
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:38,541
Not on Christmas. Not on my birthday.

560
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:45,291
He went almost a full year,
just utter silence.

561
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,916
Like I didn't even exist.

562
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,000
Then one night, he…

563
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,750
He comes home
and he sits down at the dinner table…

564
00:34:58,625 --> 00:34:59,958
And there it is.

565
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,250
There's the watch, the missing watch,

566
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:04,541
right there on his wrist.

567
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:07,416
Found out later that he put it
in his desk at work

568
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,208
and it got buried behind some papers
or something like that.

569
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:12,500
But he never apologized. He just, uh…

570
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,333
He just looked me in the eye
and said, "How was your day at school?"

571
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:21,833
Then he kept askin',
"How was your day at school?"

572
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:23,458
And I never answered him.

573
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:27,458
I just stared at him.
I didn't eat. I didn't drink.

574
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,083
Next week,
I found myself in boarding school.

575
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:35,833
[snoring]

576
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:36,916
Really?

577
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,041
[laughing]

578
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:41,083
[inhales] I'm kidding.

579
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,375
Hey.

580
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:46,083
I'm sorry about all that.

581
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,958
Oh, no, no, no, no,
it's all right. [sniffs]

582
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,750
You learn a valuable lesson, you know?

583
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,166
It doesn't matter what you do,

584
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,125
only matters what they think you've done.

585
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:01,041
How about your old man?

586
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:03,875
I don't talk about him.

587
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,083
[Booth chuckles]

588
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,125
That bad, huh?

589
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:11,375
[suspenseful music playing]

590
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,416
[Booth] Good news.

591
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,541
I slept like a baby after
our little therapy session last night.

592
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:27,875
Better news,

593
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:31,375
I've got our escape plan
down to a simple three-step process.

594
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:33,750
All right, I'll bite.
What's the first step?

595
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:36,208
-[whistles] Create a distraction.
-With soap?

596
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:39,416
You know what happens
when you mix soap, which is pure glycerin,

597
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,291
with a cleaning solution
that's essentially nitric acid?

598
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,416
-You get nitroglycerin.
-You get nitroglycerin.

599
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,375
We should run.

600
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,375
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

601
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:49,500
[machine whirring rapidly]

602
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,541
[man grunts]

603
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:54,166
[guards shouting in Russian]

604
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,833
[all grunting]

605
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:58,000
[screams]

606
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:01,000
-[guard 1 grunts]
-[guard 2 speaks Russian]

607
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:03,666
[grunting continues]

608
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,375
[all straining]

609
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:12,541
[all grunting]

610
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,583
[inmates clamoring]

611
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,291
[in English]
It's locked. We need a key card.

612
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,541
Step two, plan ahead.

613
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,791
-Where'd you get that?
-Nyet politsiya.

614
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:37,208
He's not a cop!

615
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:38,416
[grunts]

616
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,625
[phone rings]

617
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:54,916
What's the plan-- Son of a bitch!

618
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:59,041
-[in Russian] What? Understood.
-[indistinct chatter on phone]

619
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,583
[in English] What are you doing?
What's step three?

620
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:06,791
[shushes]

621
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,166
[Booth] Step three…

622
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,208
Rock Jenga.

623
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:30,833
You first.

624
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:33,958
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

625
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,250
[in Russian] Get back!

626
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:36,458
[gun cocking]

627
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,458
This way.

628
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:55,625
They're outside the walls.
Secure the perimeter.

629
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,291
[guards exclaiming in Russian]

630
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:11,416
[Hartley grunting]

631
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:15,416
[Booth exclaiming]

632
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,750
[breathing heavily]

633
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:18,291
[in English] Thank you. [panting]

634
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:21,541
[breathing heavily]

635
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:24,375
Okay. Okay.

636
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,625
Can you fly a helicopter?

637
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:44,083
Does the back of your head
look like a huge penis?

638
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,791
The answer is yes!

639
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:50,291
[Russian pop music playing]

640
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:58,166
Oh, that's fun. This is my best friend.

641
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,291
[guard grunts]

642
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,083
-We're not friends.
-We're best friends.

643
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:05,750
-[in Russian] They're over here!
-[in English] Go!

[grunts]

645
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:26,875
I can't believe nobody saw that.

[guards shouting]

647
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:30,333

[guards continue shouting]

649
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,041
[Booth in English] Okay.

650
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:43,000
Oh.

651
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:44,125
That's in Russian.

[guards speaking indistinctly]

656
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,375

677
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,791
I was praying for you.

678
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,958
Don't give me that shit.
You were gonna leave me?

679
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:00,375
You said, "Save yourself."

680
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:02,250
I said, "Go,"
but I didn't mean without me.

681
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,416
You said, "Go save yourself."

682
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,500
And I was gonna carry you with me
in my heart like an eternal flame,

683

[triumphant music playing]

692
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:40,166
[exhales]

693
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:43,583
[Hartley panting]

694
00:43:43,666 --> 00:43:45,708
See? Easy-peasy.

695
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:55,583
[The Bishop] I know it sounds
like a tough childhood,

696
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,916
but my father made me who I am today.

697
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:01,541
Maybe that's my problem.

698
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:07,250
I'm so focused on winning all the time,
on being the best at what I do,

699
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:11,458
that I can never
just fully relax and just be.

700
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:14,791
Is that normal?

701
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:16,958
[muffled] How the fuck would I know?

702
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:24,083
[The Bishop] What?

703
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:26,958
I'm not a therapist.
I'm an intelligence analyst.

704
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:28,000
I'm sorry.

705
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,666
[sighs] I'm just dealing
with a lot right now

706
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,833
and you seemed like
someone I could talk to.

707
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,041
And it's so rare in my line of work

708
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:38,333
to find someone
who's just there to listen.

709
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:39,791
Thank you.

710
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:44,333
Anyway, I'm sorry
to rope you into all of this,

711
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:46,166
but just using your terminal here

712
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,625
to ensure that the origin point
of my message is untraceable.

713
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:52,333
Best way to do it is
from within the system itself.

714
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:55,791
They should really work on
patching the security vulnerability.

715
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:56,916
It's embarrassing.

716
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,875
Did you know that 99%
of all tracking protocols

717
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:02,041
focus on third-party movements? [scoffs]

718
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:07,291
No one ever expects the call
to come from inside the house, as it were.

719
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,083
Hence, your computer, your office.

720
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:13,916
Oh. Here we go.

721
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:18,166
Just need to slow down my competition,
such as they are.

722
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:44,375
I'm afraid that's
all the time we have for today.

723
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:49,125
I'm gonna have to end our session here.
Have a lovely day.

724
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:50,166
Freeze!

725
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,625
-[grunts, groans]
-[winces]

726
00:45:58,708 --> 00:45:59,833
[sighs] See?

727
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:03,291
This is why we can't have nice things.

728
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:07,125
'Cause the moment I trust someone,
they tap the foot alarm beneath their desk

729
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:09,250
and then I'm forced
to do things like this.

730
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:13,041
I'm not angry. I'm just disappointed.

731
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:15,500
I really thought you were different.

732
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:18,666
Well, fool me once…

733
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:22,625
I'm gonna leave now and when he wakes up,

734
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:25,333
you're going to tell him
that you triggered the alarm falsely

735
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:28,041
and in his haste,
he tripped coming through the door.

736
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:30,708
And if you decide not to do that,

737
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,708
I want you to remember
one critically important thing.

738
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:39,625
I know everyone you work with
and every member of your family.

739
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,208
And I also know your browser history.

740
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:45,875
-[clicks tongue]

741
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,000
[aircraft whooshing]

742
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:52,916
[triumphant music playing]

743
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,416
[both laughing]

744
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,333
Nolan.

745
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:05,666
Tambwe! Come on, bring it in.

746
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:07,416
[Tambwe] Oh.

747
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:10,416
I can't thank you enough for this.

748
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,625
I'm just glad
I could finally repay my debt to you.

749
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:13,833
And now I'm in yours.

750
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:15,291
[Tambwe laughs]

751
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:16,666
-Come, everything is ready.
-Alright.

752
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,250
-I have juice boxes.
-That's very good.

753
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:21,708
Hey. Tambwe got us a costume change,
so we can get out of these filthy duds.

754
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:22,875
Oh. I'm so sorry.

755
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:26,000
Tambwe, this is Agent John Hartley

756
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:29,291
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It's a funny story.

757
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:32,166
A lot of his colleagues have
put a lot of your colleagues in prison.

758
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,250
It's exciting.

759
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:36,125
No juice boxes for you.

760
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:58,750
[exhales]

761
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:00,750
Oh, I see.

762
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:03,458
Nice jacket, while I "Gotta dance."

763
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:06,083
All right, man.
Don't even start with me, okay?

764
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:07,875
At least you're comfortable.

765
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:12,958
Well, clearly you have
this whole thing figured out.

766
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:16,041
-You wanna walk me through it?
-I do. Here's the deal.

767
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:17,208
During the party,

768
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:20,208
the guests and the staff
are required to stay on the main floor,

769
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:21,791
and upstairs, the door to the egg room,

770
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:24,541
well, that's locked and heavily guarded.

771
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:27,083
But there's another way in.
Hidden entrance.

772
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:28,375
Here's what I'm thinkin'.

773
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:31,000
We dress up in matching black pajamas

774
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:34,000
and sneak past the featured extras
and into the bedroom.

775
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:39,625
Then, we slip through the study
and get our hands on his precious.

776
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,708
-Is that the egg?
-[shushes]

777
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:43,750
I'm sorry.

778
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:51,333
-You are amazing.
-I know.

779
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:53,625
Wow.

780
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:56,291
-Hey, dickhead.
-Hmm?

781
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:58,583
Your last brilliant plan
had some kinks in it.

782
00:48:58,666 --> 00:48:59,583
Mmm-hmm.

783
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:01,916
So, what kinda security surveillance
are we looking at?

784
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,291
Well, the guy's an arms dealer,

785
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:06,416
so, you know, every square inch
of this place is gonna be on lock.

786
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,416
Two-man guard teams at every access point
are signal rotated to keep them frosty.

787
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,458
Once they're on the move,
you only have 45 seconds until they land.

788
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:15,875
It's a pretty tight window.

789
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:19,750
The eyes and ears are
in a secure room in the west hall.

790
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:24,375
Eighty-seven motion-sensitive 8K cameras
with an overlapping field of vision,

791
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:26,583
so there are no natural blind spots.

792
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,958
They're always watching, always listening.

793
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:30,708
Kinda like Alexa but with guns.

794
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:32,791
Now, here's where
things get a little tricky.

795
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,708
The vault door to the egg room
is a military-grade,

796
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:39,458
biometric portal made out of
a foot and a half of solid titanium.

797
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:42,666
So you can't drill it
and you can't make it go boom.

798
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,583
The only way through it
is with facial and voice recognition.

799
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:48,541
And there's only one face
and one voice that opens it.

800
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:50,541
Sotto Voce.

801
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:52,958
How are we gonna get
his voice and his facial?

802
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:55,625
Well, first off,
a positive mental attitude helps.

803
00:49:56,125 --> 00:50:00,291
But so does some pretty kick-ass
deepfake technology.

804
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,750
Spooky, right?

805
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:05,958
If you have
more than 12 images on the Internet,

806
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:09,958
I can send your mom
a video of you mouth-sexing a goat.

807
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:13,416
I'm not saying I'm gonna do that,
I'm just saying I could if I wanted to.

808
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,666
If I had enough time and enough pictures.

809
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,791
[shutter clicking]

810
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:20,000
But wait, there's more.

811
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:24,333
There's also a 12-digit randomly-generated
passcode that's changed every six minutes,

812
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:26,958
and that code can only be found
in Sotto Voce's phone,

813
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:29,958
and Sotto Voce's phone can only be found
in Sotto Voce's pants.

814
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:32,875
So, yeah, easy-peasy.

815
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:35,625
Oh, no, no, no! There's one more thing.
Kinda important.

816
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:40,875
We're gonna need his thumbprint 'cause
he never upgraded his iPhone -4, so…

817
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:43,416
So if we don't get his thumbprint,
we can't get the egg.

818
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,083
Oh, my God.

819
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:48,875
You can learn. This is amazing.

820
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,166
You are not sparkly enough.

821
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,416
I'm gonna get you a matching vest
to go with those pants.

You don't have to do that.
I'm standing right next to you.

827
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,250
I'm not used to using these stupid things,

828
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:47,291
and I'm not used
to working with a partner.

829
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:49,916
We're not partners.
This is a marriage of convenience.

830
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,166
I want a divorce
and I'm keeping the kids.

831
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,583
Let's just do this.

832
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:56,833
I'll get the thumbprint,
you get Sotto Voce's phone.

Yeah, it's no biggie. No biggie.
We knew she'd be here.

837
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:37,750
We're here for the egg, not her.

838
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:40,041
Speak for yourself. I'm going in.

839
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,208
What are you doing?
That's not part of the plan.

I'm sorry, do we know each other?

846
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,791
It's just impossible for me
to tell who you are with that mask on.

849
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:10,875
So it was you all along.

850
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:13,708
Such a clever disguise.

851
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,583
Well, I suppose you and Mr. Booth,
wherever he is,

852
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:21,125
are here to try to beat me
to the second egg.

853
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:23,791
-Even the playing field.
-Don't tell her anything.

854
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:26,291
I'm not here for the egg.
I'm here to clear my name,

855
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:27,541
which means all I need is you.

856
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:29,250
You're literally telling her everything.

857
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:34,458
We both know that this whole thing
is gonna end with you in handcuffs.

858

00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:57,583
Careful now. We don't wanna cause a scene.

861
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:59,500
Don't care.
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

862
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,083
Oh, good, you're dancing with her.

863
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:10,708
Not bad for a convict.

864
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:15,583
Speaking of which,
how's it going with your partner in crime?

865
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:18,083
Has he told you
where the third egg is yet?

866
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:20,041
Well, if he did, I wouldn't tell you.

867
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,583
That's a no. He must not trust you.

868
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,416
You trust your partner?

869
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,666
[The Bishop]
What makes you think I have one?

870
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:32,833
Well, no one would be able to pull off
the scores you have alone.

871
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:34,083
It's impossible.

872
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:35,125
[scoffs]

873
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:42,041
So what now?

874
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:44,083
You're gonna arrest me right here,

875
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:48,416
without a badge or a gun,
outside of your jurisdiction,

876
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:52,250
and in front of a room full of criminals?

877
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,666
Is that your plan, Agent Hartley?

878
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:57,791
[laughs]

879
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,583
Shit!

880
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:09,291
[Booth] Incoming! Got the print.
Get the hell out of there.

881
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:15,333
Or perhaps you just
didn't think this all the way through.

882
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:21,416
You're coming with me. Party's over.

883
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,541
[Sotto Voce clears throat]

884
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:31,583
Watching you dance with this man
at my party has made me quite jealous.

885
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:33,875
Well, I had to get your attention somehow.

886
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,708
Didn't I?

887
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:39,291
May I?

888
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:41,916
Like you said, it's your party.

889
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:47,583
Apologies.

890
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:52,541
We needed to get his phone,

891
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,833
not waste time
playing footsie with The Bishop.

892
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:57,458
Don't worry. I got it.

893
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,625
Excuse me.

894
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,958
You're kidding. Nice pull!

895
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:04,750
How'd you know Sotto Voce would cut in?

896
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:09,458
Well, Sotto Voce is a 5'5" alpha male
with textbook Napoleon complex.

897
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:13,666
So any time another male dances with
the most desirable woman at his party,

898
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,666
well, he has no choice
but to step in and assert his dominance.

899
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,708
You sneaky little minx.

900
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:21,708
Where'd you learn that? Profiler school?

901
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:22,791
High school.

902
00:56:32,541 --> 00:56:35,500
[song ends]

903
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:44,041
Ladies and gentlemen,

904
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:49,958
it is my sincere pleasure
to welcome you all to my humble home.

905
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:52,375
-[crowd chuckle]
-Now's the time. He's speechifying.

906
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:54,125
[Sotto Voce] My father
was a man of conviction…

907
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:55,208
[Booth] Moving to two.

908
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:57,291
[Sotto's speech continues indistinctly]

909
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:02,625
[both exclaim]

910
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:04,791
Oh! Terribly, terribly sorry, sir.

911
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:06,416
You imbecile!

912
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:09,416
-Oh…
-Don't put your hands on me, peasant.

913
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:13,000
[in Spanish] I'm so sorry, sir.
[in English] A thousand apologies.

914
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:15,458
I don't need your apologies,
I need a washroom.

915
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:16,541
Take him.

916
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:18,375
Right this way, sir.

917
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:20,208
[whispers] Let's get you hosed down.

918
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:24,333
[Sotto Voce] This pistol
was my father's prized possession.

919
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:27,583
I've kept it close to my heart
since the day I killed him with it.

920
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:30,541
I was never permitted
to touch this as a boy.

921
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:31,625
[Booth] Right this way.

922
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:36,708
[Sotto Voce] It's just like the one
used by the Lone Ranger.

923
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,333
[in Spanish] Hey.

924
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,166
What's going on there?

925
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,083
Someone spilled wine on a guest.
They're cleared.

926
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:46,166
[speech continues indistinctly]

927
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:03,333
Something's off. I'm calling it in anyway.

928
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:07,000
Don't be an idiot.
You read too many spy novels. [scoffs]

929
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:10,125
[Sotto Voce in English]
I miss you every day, Pop-Pop.

930
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:13,166
And in his immortal words,

931
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:18,500
"The skilled hunter needs but one bullet."

932
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,500
[guests gasp]

933
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:26,291
[guests cheering]

934
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:29,458
-[guest] Bravo!
-Enjoy your evening.

935
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,083
No, no, no, no, no.

936
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:26,041
We gotta go.

937
00:59:48,041 --> 00:59:50,250
[Booth] Here we go, nice and easy.

938
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:52,833
[both grunt]

939
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:55,500
Oh, my God!

940
00:59:55,583 --> 00:59:57,458
You're like a well-dressed wall.

941
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:58,583
What are you doing?

942
00:59:58,666 --> 00:59:59,750
Trying to ruin the mission.

943
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:02,166
Well, mission accomplished.
Find the print.

944
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,083
God damn it!

945
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:07,166
Come on, come on, come on,
you little bastard. Where are you?

946
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,833
Shit!

947
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,625
Gotcha.

948
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,708
Phone, phone, phone, phone.

949
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:53,416
Okay, it's deepfake time.

950
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:56,333
Sotto Voce.

951
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:05,083
Right.

952
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,208
[in Spanish] I thought
Mr. Voce was still at the party?

953
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,750
Send a team.

954
01:01:14,416 --> 01:01:17,166
Security, we have a code red.

955
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:21,125
[Das in English] Hey!

956
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:26,458
You know,
for a guy who claims he's innocent,

957
01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:28,916
you sure do hang around
with a lot of criminals.

958
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,375
I am innocent.

959
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:32,791
He's a pretty damn good thief
for his first time.

960
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:34,333
-I'm not good at it.
-[Booth] You are.

961
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:36,041
-Don't say that.
-Don't sell yourself short.

962
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:37,625
-Shut up.
-Hector Deflector over here.

963
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:39,333
He's not good at taking a compliment.

964
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:42,625
I need you to understand,
The Bishop is behind this entire thing.

965
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:43,666
She set me up.

966
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:47,666
Well, if this is all The Bishop's doing
and you really are innocent, prove it.

967
01:01:48,916 --> 01:01:52,208
Go on, detain your friend.

968
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,333
We're not friends.

969
01:01:53,416 --> 01:01:55,291
-We're work wives.
-We're not work wives.

970
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:57,208
-We're sister wives.
-We're not any kind of wives.

971
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:58,416
Shut up! Both of you.

972
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,125
You either arrest him
or I arrest you both.

973
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:06,041
What's it gonna be, Agent Hartley?

974
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,041
-I'm sorry, man.
-Oh…

975
01:02:13,666 --> 01:02:14,875
Oh, come on!

976
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:16,541
-You're under arrest.
-You're gonna listen?

977
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:18,500
After all we've been through together…

978
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:25,541
[whispers] You love me?

979
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:26,791
[whispers] I hate you.

980
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:30,666
-[in normal voice] Tight enough? Jesus!
-[sighs] See?

981
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,333
I'm a good guy.

982
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,291
But sometimes I do bad things.

983
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,500
[Hartley grunts]

984
01:02:36,583 --> 01:02:37,916
[Booth grunts]

985
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:43,166
-Hartley!
-Let's grab that egg and get out of here.

986
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,000
You don't wanna talk
about what just happened?

987
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,708
-What you talking about?
-We had a moment.

988
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:49,333
-We didn't have a moment.
-No, we had a moment.

989
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:56,750
[regal music playing]

990
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:05,583
Looking for something specific
or just browsing?

991
01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:08,916
You look awful.

992
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,041
Hmm. You know, there was an easier way in,

993
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:16,208
but I doubt very much
that you could've managed it.

994
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:17,458
[Booth scoffs]

995
01:03:17,541 --> 01:03:20,791
Now that I have two out of the three eggs,

996
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:25,958
I'll give you one last chance
to take me up on my offer.

997
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:28,625
-Well, here's my counteroffer.
-[The Bishop] Mm-hmm.

998
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:30,125
-You're under arrest.
-Oh, my God.

999
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:31,375
Read the room.

1000
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:35,958
I told you, this would end
with you in handcuffs.

1001
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:38,541
You're so embarrassing.
He's so embarrassing.

1002
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:41,125
Tell you what, Agent Hartley.

1003
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:44,083
You wanna arrest me?

1004
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:46,000
Come…

1005
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:49,833
Arrest me.

1006
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:52,833
I just want the egg. So, uh--

1007
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,208
[choking]

1008
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:56,583
[all grunting]

1009
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,416
Take it easy.

1010
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:11,458
This is easy.

1011
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:15,208

[The Bishop grunts]

1019
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:12,875
Sir, we have a problem in the vault room.

1020
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:16,458
Excuse me.

1021
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:17,875

[both groaning]

1026
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:04,375
Bro, I didn't…
I didn't see the handcuffs coming.

1027
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:06,916
Mm, was a nice touch.

1028
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,166
God, this is such a confusing erection.

1029
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,750
You can't ever tell anybody about this.

1030
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,125
-[Booth] I'll never tell anybody. Promise.
-[Hartley] Okay.

1031

[footsteps approaching]

1032
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:18,833
[Booth] Okay.

Oh, whoa, hold on, hold on.
No, don't shoot.

1034
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,750
I'm not trying to be a tattletale.
We didn't steal your egg, okay?

1035
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:27,041
I mean, we tried.

1036

But she got it.

1038

Is that so?

1039
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:37,708
Thank you. Oh. All right.

1040
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,958
Would you like to make
a confession, my lady?

1041
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:51,166
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

1042
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,250
I told you they'd come.

1043

1050
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:32,291
Down here, beneath the bulls,
no one will hear your screams.

1051
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:34,291
[exhales] That's called foreshadowing.

1052
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:35,916
-I know what it's called.
-Was making sure.

1053

You don't look like an English major.

1054
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:40,875
-Shut up.
-Buongiorno, everybody!

1055
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:43,208
-Perfect!
-[sing-song] I brought champagne.

1056
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:45,750
I would introduce you,
but I believe you've already met

1057
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,250
my lovely business associate.

1058
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:48,166
[Booth] Yes.

1059
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,291
I told you The Bishop
was working with somebody.

1060
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:52,541
It's a marriage of convenience.

1061
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:55,416
You're familiar with that concept,
aren't you?

1062
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:59,708
You see, the dashing Mr. Voce here

1063
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:02,125
already held the second egg
in his possession.

1064
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:05,000
So, I approached him with my own offer,

1065
01:08:05,083 --> 01:08:07,458
which brings us to the part

1066
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:12,166
where you tell us where the third egg is.

1067
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:15,958
[both laugh]

1068
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:21,958
Piss off for a thousand years.

1069
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:25,916
Oh, bummer.
I really wanted to do it the easy way.

1070
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:31,625
That's okay. I'll get the information
from you by hurting him.

1071
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,208
I'm sorry, what?

1072
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:35,666
I love this plan.

1073
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:41,333
[The Bishop] You two share a special bond.

1074
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:43,833
Otherwise, why would you
risk your lives together

1075
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:45,250
attempting to steal the egg?

1076
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:48,125
Isn't that right, Agent Hartley?

1077
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:50,875
There is no bond between us.
I barely know the guy.

1078
01:08:50,958 --> 01:08:52,916
Booth, tell her we're not friends.

1079
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:56,791
-She knows about us, pal.
-That's bullshit.

1080
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:59,250
She knows about our special bond,
that you were my best man.

1081

Son of a bitch. He's lying.

If she hurts you bad enough,
if she gets really creative with it,

1083
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:06,208
I'm gonna have no choice
but to tell her everything.

1084
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:11,333
Now, Mr. Booth, where is the third egg?

1085
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:15,583

[crowd cheering]

1203
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:17,583
[indistinct chatter]

1204
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:23,458
[bellows]

1205
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:24,916
Oh, shit!

1206
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:28,291
I think we're gonna get out of here.

1207
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:30,125
[exclaims] Shit!

1208
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:37,666
-No, no. Don't move. Don't move.
-Why?

1209
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:40,708
Bulls have terrible eyesight.
But they can sense motion.

1210
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:42,208
You're thinking of Jurassic Park.

1211
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:45,708
No! I saw a nature documentary
starring David Attenborough.

1212
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,958
You're thinking of Richard Attenborough
from Jurassic Park.

1213
01:15:49,041 --> 01:15:50,916
[all yelling in Spanish]

1214
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:56,083
Vámonos. Vámonos.
They're telling me to run.

1215
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:58,125
If you run, you die.

1216
01:15:58,208 --> 01:15:59,541
[snorting]

1217
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:02,666
All right, yes or no,
was Jeff Goldblum in it?

1218
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:05,750
Oh, my God! It was Jurassic Park.
That's Jeff Goldblum.

1219
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:06,750
Asshole!

1220
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:08,208
-[bull snorts]

-[groans]
-[crowd gasps]

1222
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:15,333
[Booth] Run, run, run, run, run
or you will die!

1223
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:16,791
[bellowing]

1224
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,041
A-ha-- [grunts]

1225
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,541
[crowd cheering]

1226
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:30,791
Ah.

1227
01:16:32,166 --> 01:16:33,291
Thank you!

1228
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:38,333
What's your problem?

1229
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Don't run?

1230
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:41,958
Don't run?

1231
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:45,000
[Booth] You gonna be
this grumpy the whole trip?

1232
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:47,166
Wait till you see our ride.
You're gonna love it.

1233
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:58,750
This is fun, isn't it?

1234
01:16:58,833 --> 01:17:01,000
Riding the rails hobo-style.

1235
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:04,166
You ever see, um, uh, Sullivan's Travels?

1236
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:05,708
No, I haven't.

1237
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:07,833
And no, it's not, all right? Cough it up.

1238
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:09,708
Where are we headed?
Where's the third egg?

1239
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,416
All right, fine.

1240
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,041
I've been thinking about this a lot,
and I can't tell you.

1241
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,208
What do you mean, you can't tell me?

1242
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:20,083
It's not so much of a "can't,"
it's more of a "won't."

1243
01:17:21,458 --> 01:17:22,375
[exclaims]

1244
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:25,375
Take me to the third egg, Booth.

1245
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:26,958
[train horn blowing]

1246
01:17:31,125 --> 01:17:32,083
You wanna do it?

1247
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:33,416
[suspenseful music playing]

1248
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,541
Do it.

1249
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:36,583
You can't, can you?

1250
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:40,000
'Cause even though you're
running around with me, playing the thief,

1251
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:42,916
you're not a real bad guy, Bubba.

1252
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:49,458
[suspenseful music builds]

1253
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:51,166
[Booth screams]

1254
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:56,833
Let's get something straight right now.

1255
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,416
That was terrifying.

1256
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:03,791
Look, it's not that
I don't care about you.

1257
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:06,041
It's that I don't care about anyone.

1258
01:18:08,458 --> 01:18:09,416
My dad was a crook.

1259
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:13,083
A con man, actually.

1260
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:15,291
[emotional music playing]

1261
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:16,375
He was the best.

1262
01:18:17,708 --> 01:18:20,833
Then on my 13th birthday,
he didn't show up.

1263
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:23,291
My mom and I never saw him again.

1264
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:28,750
Wow.

1265
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:32,916
We really got some dads, huh?

1266
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,041
It's a miracle we're not both strippers.

1267
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:36,833
[chuckles] Yeah.

1268
01:18:36,916 --> 01:18:39,250
[chuckles]

1269
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:43,666
Look, your dad was a cop,
so you became a crook.

1270
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:46,583
My dad was a crook, so I became a cop.

1271
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:48,500
We're not that different.

1272
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:51,291
I'm not asking you
to care about me, Booth.

1273
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:53,791
I'm asking you to help me.

1274
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:58,625
Help me catch The Bishop
and clear my name,

1275
01:18:58,708 --> 01:19:02,916
and I will help you become the number one
art thief in the world again.

1276
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:07,250
It's the only chance I have
to get my life back.

1277
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:09,291
Please.

1278
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:21,791
April, 1945.

1279
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:27,625
The Red Army's at the gate,
days from taking Berlin.

1280
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:30,041
It's game over for the Nazis,

1281
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:33,416
and that's when a forgotten Mr. Nobody
named Rudolph Zeich,

1282
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:36,166
Hitler's personal
art and antiquities dealer,

1283
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:39,916
and the only man ever rumored
to have held Cleopatra's third egg

1284
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,583
in his hands,

1285
01:19:41,666 --> 01:19:45,583
hopped a steamer ship
and fled Germany for Argentina.

1286
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:48,333
The manifest shows
he traveled with just a single suitcase.

1287
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:55,333
Oh, and sixteen five-ton cargo containers
logged only as holding machine parts.

1288
01:19:57,375 --> 01:20:00,291
Now, why would an art dealer
leave his patron's side

1289
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:01,791
and travel halfway around the globe,

1290
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:06,041
with nearly 100 tons
of so-called machine parts?

1291
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:10,208
For 70 years,
amateur sleuths, treasure hunters,

1292
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:14,083
and adult virgins everywhere
became obsessed with this question,

1293
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:20,208
obsessed with finding what they believed
had to be Hitler's lost bunker,

1294
01:20:20,291 --> 01:20:23,083
hidden somewhere in South America.

1295
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,583
And my dad was one of them.

1296
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:30,583
He'd spend weekends
holed up in his office,

1297
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:33,375
poring over old maps
and declassified files.

1298
01:20:34,583 --> 01:20:37,708
Holidays, he'd drive hours away
to obscure auctions,

1299
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,958
where he'd bid on the strangest things.

1300
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:45,666
Including a watch.

1301
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:54,583
And not just any watch.
Creepy Nazi art guy Rudolph Zeich's watch.

1302
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:58,791
That same watch
my father chose to love more than me.

1303
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:00,958
What a dick.

1304
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:07,000
Never wanted anything to do
with his treasure hunt,

1305
01:21:07,083 --> 01:21:08,458
even after he passed.

1306
01:21:09,583 --> 01:21:11,958
That was my father's thing,
and he could have it.

1307
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:23,916
But when I discovered what was inside it,

1308
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:28,916
I knew right then that I held in my hand

1309
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,750
the secret to the third egg's location.

1310
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,625
[Hartley] Booth,
you've had me traveling for three days

1311
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:07,125
and hiking in circles for eight hours.

1312
01:22:07,208 --> 01:22:08,750
That map better be right.

1313
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:11,000
[Booth] Relax, we'll find it.

1314
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:12,750
[Hartley] Say we find it.

1315
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:14,916
How can you be sure
the egg is actually there?

1316
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,166
-[Booth] What do you mean?
-I get that Rudolph the red-nosed Nazi guy

1317
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:21,166
is rumored to be the last person
to ever hold the egg in his hands,

1318
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:25,666
and that this mystery bunker is rumored
to have all this stolen treasure.

1319
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:28,708
How can you be sure
the third egg itself is actually there?

1320
01:22:28,791 --> 01:22:29,625
Faith.

1321
01:22:31,916 --> 01:22:32,750
Faith?

1322
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:34,291
I'm sorry, I just wanna be clear.

1323
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:37,541
So we're out in the middle of nowhere
based on faith?

1324
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,458
Or "gut vibe" if you're
not into the whole religious thing.

1325
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:41,375
No.

1326
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:44,708
You know, the kinda thing I'm into
is a good plan.

1327
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:47,083
A smart plan, the opposite of this.

1328
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:50,250
Relax. I have good news.
If I'm reading this map right…

1329
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:52,666
We're here.

1330
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:54,083
-We're where?
-We've arrived.

1331
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:55,208
X marks the spot.

1332
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:58,041
X… What spot? X marks the spot.

1333
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:00,416
We're here. Here it is. Great job!

1334
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,875
-Please don't yell at me.
-You found it! Booth found it.

1335
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:04,750
There's no bunker. There's shit here.

1336
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:06,958
-I'm just telling you what the map says.
-There's no bunker.

1337
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:08,416
Tell me, what does the map say?

1338
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:11,125
Oh, shit!

1339
01:23:13,166 --> 01:23:14,916
Yeah, it's gonna be a long walk back.

1340
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:17,875
You know what I blame?
I blame the compass.

1341
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:20,541
I got this thing back in Scouts.
It's been a little wonky.

1342
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:22,208
It was never my strong suit.

1343
01:23:22,291 --> 01:23:23,416
-Can I see this?
-Absolutely.

1344
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,708
-Can I see this?
-Of course.

1345
01:23:26,375 --> 01:23:27,375
I see what the problem is.

1346
01:23:28,125 --> 01:23:29,916
-That's the problem.
-Oh. That is not kind.

1347
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,583
You know what's not kind?
Dragging me out in the middle of nowhere,

1348
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:35,166
halfway around the world,
based on a goddamn hunch!

1349
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:36,458
[metal clangs]

1350
01:23:38,375 --> 01:23:42,125
[triumphant music playing]

1351
01:24:29,916 --> 01:24:31,000
[Booth] Holy shit!

1352
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:46,708
[Booth whistling "The Raiders March"]

1353
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:51,958
[whistling stops]

1354
01:25:00,583 --> 01:25:02,583
Guess they're paying the utilities.

1355
01:25:04,291 --> 01:25:06,041
It's gotta be hydroelectric power,

1356
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:09,083
which means there's
running water somewhere down here.

1357
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,750
Look at that door.
Nothing hiding behind there.

1358
01:25:19,708 --> 01:25:21,291
How are we gonna get through this?

1359
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:28,041
Oh, shit!

1360
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:32,375
You have got to be kidding.

1361
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:39,833
Is that your father's watch?

1362
01:25:39,916 --> 01:25:43,083
No. It's the watch from Pulp Fiction.

1363
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:45,375
Yes, it's my father's watch.

1364
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:49,458
-I thought you said you smashed it.
-I had it repaired. Is that a problem?

1365
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:52,125
No, it's not a problem.
Glad you're not touchy about it.

1366
01:25:52,208 --> 01:25:53,208
Please shut up.

1367
01:25:56,416 --> 01:25:57,250
[clangs]

1368
01:25:57,333 --> 01:25:59,250
Uh, fun with magnets. All right.

1369
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,875
[clicking]

1370
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:12,833
Dad…

1371
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:16,875
Please be good crazy.

1372
01:26:21,416 --> 01:26:24,166
-[clicking]
-[dull thud]

1373
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:26,500
-[chains rattling]
-[metal thudding]

1374
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,750
[thudding stops]

1375
01:26:40,791 --> 01:26:42,208
[both grunting]

1376
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:22,208
Forget the egg,
let's just steal this stuff.

1377
01:27:22,291 --> 01:27:24,166
[Hartley]
We're not here to steal anything.

1378
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:27,375
Uh, actually we are.
We're here to steal the egg.

1379
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:28,666
[Hartley] You know what I mean.

1380
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:32,083
[Booth] Oh, I steal it, it's stealing,
and you steal it, it's what?

1381
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:34,250
How about we just shut up?
And by we, I mean you.

1382
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:35,791
[Booth] You're also rude too.

1383
01:27:36,833 --> 01:27:38,666
Rude to boot.

1384
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:41,541
[Hartley] How are we gonna find this egg?

1385
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:42,833
[Booth] I don't know.

1386
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:45,750
Look for a box that says "MacGuffin."

1387
01:28:02,625 --> 01:28:03,791
Oh!

1388
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:05,333
Do you know what this is?

1389
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:07,708
This is…

1390
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:12,875
Yes, this is
a 1931 Mercedes-Benz Grosser 770.

1391
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:16,041
I could flip this for $25 million, easy.

1392
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:18,625
There's, like, three of these left
on the planet. Four!

1393
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,000
There's four now.

1394
01:28:21,083 --> 01:28:22,458
Three quarter-inch steel,

1395
01:28:22,541 --> 01:28:25,125
reinforced armor-plating,
bullet-resistant glass,

1396
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:27,625
and a 24-karat gold inlay.

1397
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:29,833
This is a convertible tank.

1398
01:28:29,916 --> 01:28:32,833
And it's in mint condition.
I bet you this thing still runs.

1399
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:34,750
Too bad it was driven by Nazi scum.

1400
01:28:34,833 --> 01:28:36,333
It's a shame we're gonna have to burn it.

1401
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:38,250
How did they get it down here anyway?

1402
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:41,416
They carry it down the stairs
in tiny pieces and reassemble?

1403
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,416
Through there.

1404
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:47,416
Place must have been built off
one of those old copper mines.

1405
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,208
The shafts down here are massive
and go on for miles.

1406
01:28:50,791 --> 01:28:53,958
Build the bunker, bring in the loot,
seal the shaft…

1407
01:28:54,041 --> 01:28:55,083
Bob's your uncle.

1408
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:57,000
Who's your daddy?

1409
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:58,708
[Hartley] That's not how it goes.

1410
01:28:58,791 --> 01:28:59,875
[Booth] I know.

1411
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:08,458
Well, labels, Nazis, dum-dums.

1412
01:29:13,583 --> 01:29:15,750
[Booth guffawing]

1413
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:19,000
[triumphant music playing]

1414
01:29:22,916 --> 01:29:23,791
[clangs]

1415
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:29,833
Five-second rule.

1416
01:29:29,916 --> 01:29:33,791
It's fine. Totally fine.
Not a scratch on it.

1417
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:36,625
Are you sure you don't wanna
flip this one? I got a guy.

1418
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:38,416
Let me save you the trouble.

1419
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:40,666
[sighs]

1420
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,916
Your entrances are bullshit.

1421
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,375
Egypt? [scoffs]

1422
01:29:45,041 --> 01:29:48,458
Did you really think I ran right off
to the pyramids on your good word?

1423
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:51,500
All I had to do was wait for you two
to escape from Sotto Voce,

1424
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:53,750
and you led me right to the third egg,

1425
01:29:53,833 --> 01:29:55,875
which I'm going to take from you now.

1426
01:29:56,666 --> 01:29:59,333
So, uh, hand it over.

1427
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:01,916
Come on, don't be shy.

1428
01:30:05,083 --> 01:30:07,583
[mockingly] Good job. Attaboy.

1429
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:09,625
-[door opens]
-[cocks gun]

1430
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:10,833
Drop your weapon!

1431
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:14,875
[rapid gunshots]

1432
01:30:14,958 --> 01:30:16,791
[in Spanish] This way! On that side.

1433
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:22,291
[in English] How did she find us?

1434
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:24,791
I followed you. She must have followed me.

1435
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:27,791
No shit!

1436
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:33,458
Why are you shooting at them?
I thought you were on their side.

1437
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:35,666
I am on their side. They shot at me first.

1438
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,166
How are we gonna get out of here?

1439
01:30:41,916 --> 01:30:42,833
We take that.

1440
01:30:43,416 --> 01:30:45,583
I don't think that's
gonna make it up the stairs.

1441
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:48,500
-[cocks gun]
-It ain't going up the stairs.

1442
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:51,166
Cover us.

1443
01:30:53,458 --> 01:30:55,208
[officers shouting]

1444
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:03,333
[engine cranks]

1445
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,416
-Go, go, go!
-I'm trying!

1446
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:10,500
Let's go.

1447
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,916
-[engine starts]
-Huh? Ha-ha!

1448

[officers shouting in Spanish]

1449
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:30,791
Let's go!

1450
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:34,375
-Throw it.
-What?

1451
01:31:34,458 --> 01:31:35,291
Now!

1452
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,166
[Das in Spanish]
You two with me, the rest of you follow.

1453
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,083
Go!

1454
01:31:52,625 --> 01:31:53,958
[engines revving]

1455
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,250
[in English] I'm all out.

1456

[grunts]

1457
01:32:33,916 --> 01:32:35,416
[in Spanish] Pull over!

Whoa!

[grunts]

[grunting]

1478
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:40,458
[Booth] You saved me.

1479
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:43,500
You love me. You love me like crazy.

1480
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:52,958
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
-Shit!

1481
01:34:58,208 --> 01:34:59,458
We're running out of road.

1482
01:35:00,041 --> 01:35:02,916
Hold on to something!
If we stop, they'll catch us.

1483
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,583
Then let's get caught.

1484
01:35:04,666 --> 01:35:07,416
We can escape later.
It works for me all the time.

1485
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,666
Make sure to kick clear of the car.

1486
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:12,333
-I would like to workshop this idea.
-Oh, shit!

1487
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:18,500

[panting]

1494
01:36:12,583 --> 01:36:14,291
It's just like we drew it up, right?

1495
01:36:16,375 --> 01:36:17,375
Hartley?

1496
01:36:20,041 --> 01:36:21,083
Hartley?

1497
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,458
Hartley?

1498
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,166
You will be missed.

1499
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:44,916
[groans softly]

1500
01:36:47,791 --> 01:36:51,125
Oh, shit! God damn it.

1501
01:36:51,208 --> 01:36:52,125
Hartley?

1502
01:36:53,291 --> 01:36:56,000
Hartley? Hartley?

1503
01:36:56,541 --> 01:36:58,708
Hey, where are you, you big idiot?

1504
01:36:58,791 --> 01:37:00,375
[Hartley] Who are you calling an idiot?

1505
01:37:01,541 --> 01:37:02,458
I'm right here.

1506
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:12,291
-Did you just choose me over the egg?
-No.

1507
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:14,791
-Well, it kinda looks like you did.
-I didn't.

1508
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:16,541
You went running in there to rescue me.

1509
01:37:16,625 --> 01:37:18,041
I left my phone in there.

1510
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:21,000
You only have
a finite amount of time to save it.

1511
01:37:21,083 --> 01:37:23,000
Stick it in a bag of rice,
it's a whole thing.

1512
01:37:23,083 --> 01:37:24,291
You thought I was dead.

1513
01:37:24,375 --> 01:37:26,291
I didn't think you were dead.
I wished you were dead.

1514
01:37:26,375 --> 01:37:28,958
I saw you splashing around.
"Hartley! Hartley!"

1515
01:37:29,041 --> 01:37:31,791
Yes, okay, I wanted to pull you out,

1516
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:35,250
save you, get your hopes up,
and then pull you, shove you under.

1517
01:37:35,333 --> 01:37:37,333
[panting]

1518
01:37:49,333 --> 01:37:52,291
Look, I'm not gonna
make a big deal out of this.

1519
01:37:53,166 --> 01:37:55,250
I'm not gonna gloat. It's not who I am.

1520
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:57,791
Would some people say
that this is very embarrassing for you?

1521
01:37:57,875 --> 01:37:59,958
Yes, of course. Of course they would.

1522
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:02,125
Probably everybody.

1523
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:04,541
But that's not important right now.

1524
01:38:04,625 --> 01:38:08,000
What's important is that
you realize you lost and I won.

1525
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:08,916
We.

1526
01:38:09,791 --> 01:38:13,125
We won. Together. Friendship. Teamwork.

1527
01:38:13,208 --> 01:38:14,875
It's called the moral of the story.

1528
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:18,041
And something that I've been
wanting to say for years

1529
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:19,541
to your face is…

1530
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:21,500
Checkmate.

1531
01:38:22,375 --> 01:38:23,625
Oh, that feels good.

1532
01:38:23,708 --> 01:38:26,291
I've got two eggs, you've got one,
and you think you won?

1533
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:28,708
How's that work exactly?

1534
01:38:28,791 --> 01:38:31,333
I don't have to win
in order for you to lose.

1535
01:38:31,416 --> 01:38:33,500
That's the best part of this whole thing.

1536
01:38:33,583 --> 01:38:36,416
As long as I have the third egg,
you can't win.

1537
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:38,708
I don't care about the money anymore.

1538
01:38:38,791 --> 01:38:40,416
Honestly, look at your face right now.

1539
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:42,583
That face right there.
Just… Yeah. Perfect.

1540
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:46,666
Resting failure face.
I mean, in a word, priceless.

1541
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:48,625
Also, it just gets better.

1542
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:51,541
As an added bonus,
my friend here, at no extra charge,

1543
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:55,500
is gonna give you
