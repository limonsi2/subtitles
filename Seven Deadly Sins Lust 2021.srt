[Tiffanie]
Tomorrow is my wedding day,

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,057
and I'm about to make the biggest mistake of my life,

6
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:20,769
because this man
isn't my future husband.

7
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:23,063
This man is my weakness.

8
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,649
I know it's wrong,
but I can't stop.

9
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:28,643
My desire for this man
consumes me.

10
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:32,531
It overrides reason,
morals, everything.

11
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,951
This is lust.

12
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:38,078
[vocalization]

13
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:46,828
But I'm getting ahead
of myself.

14
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,505
Let's go back to the beginning,

15
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:52,885
before Trey Taylor
shook up my life.

16
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,428
Damon King.

17
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:00,017
You want my arm to fall off?

18
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,514
-Billy Dee Williams...
-Lady Sings The Blues.

19
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:09,684
I know. You need to work
on your game, Mr. King.

20
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:12,071
Why are you so much trouble?

21
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:15,908
Because I'm your fiancee.
It's my job.

22
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,870
Damon, Damon.

23
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,580
Can I get a couple of minutes
for my viewers?

24
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,999
Sasha, of course you can.
How you doing?

25
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,417
I'm doing good.

26
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:28,036
You excited about the wedding,
Tiffanie?

27
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,089
I am. Very.

28
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,541
-I'm ecstatic.
-So when's the big day?

29
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:35,677
That's one week.
You know this is my masterpiece.

30
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,046
Talking about a masterpiece,
King Enterprises

31
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,225
is one of the biggest companies
on the sea.

32
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:44,895
What would you say
to aspiring entrepreneurs?

33
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,557
You know, you gotta wake up
every day and grind, 24/7.

34
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:51,902
Rumor has it
that you're opening a spa.

35
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,395
-Oh, yeah, that's right. Yes.
-Yes.

36
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,364
Urban Utopia's the name.

37
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,700
You know, we wanted to create
an oasis for the people.

38
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,746
You know, the average person
that can afford a nice getaway.

39
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,239
You come by the office tomorrow,

40
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,575
I'll have a letter of intent
for you.

41
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:09,461
Look, at the end of the day,

42
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:12,747
publicity alone is gonna garner
thousands of streams, Justus.

43
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:14,466
Listen, I know Damon
got the game on lock.

44
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:16,084
-Absolutely.
-But I'mma be honest with you.

45
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,095
[Justus] I need to meet
more people.

46
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,588
[Eric] Justus.
[Justus] Make it happen.

47
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,431
[Eric] I'll make it happen.

48
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,112
-Hey.
-Hey, babe.

49
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,613
-Mm.
-Thank you.

50
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,615
You want some
before I put it all up?

51
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,159
Oh, totally.

52
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,245
You ain't talking about food,
are you?

53
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,164
Mm-mm.

54
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:48,292
[both moaning]

55
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,669
On the counter.

56
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,964
Baby, it's unsanitary.

57
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,184
[moaning]

58
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,968
Take it out.

59
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,063
Hey. You can't talk like that.

60
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,611
[instrumental music]

61
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,034
Can we go upstairs now?

62
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,537
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

63
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,835
[moaning]

64
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:36,048
Well, that was so hot.

65
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,167
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

66
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,345
-[cell phone beeps]
-Oh.

67
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,726
Eric says that
we are at the top of the list

68
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,062
for Justus' album release party.

69
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,181
You know, if we get that, it's
gonna take us to the next level.

70
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,524
-Right?
-Mm-hmm.

71
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:58,946
We're gonna be the king
and queen of Atlanta.

72
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,690
I must have missed
the coronation.

73
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:04,859
[chuckles]
What's up with you tonight?

74
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:08,697
[exhales sharply]
It's Urban Utopia.

75
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,166
Baby, we're just a few days
behind the opening.

76
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,459
-Uh, uh...
-I got you.

77
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,503
I took care of it already.

78
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,038
You agreed to be
a silent partner.

79
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:21,260
Making decisions about my spa
is so not silent.

80
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:24,045
All right, I might not be
college-educated,

81
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,216
but I think I've opened up
a few businesses.

82
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,936
And I've had some failures.

83
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,898
Tiff, I'm just trying
to shield you, that's all.

84
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,728
Hot shower's calling my name.

85
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,321
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey...

86
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,368
We good?

87
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,913
King and queen of Atlanta,
right?

88
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,041
[shower running]

89
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:03,585
[Tiffanie] Something was off
with me and Damon's sex life.

90
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:07,422
I remember the cheesy romance
novels I'd sneak around with.

91
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,726
The passion! The orgasms!

92
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,596
Why wasn't I experiencing that?

93
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,525
Something was missing between
us, but I didn't know what.

94
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,866
He says the treatment tables
are in Idaho.

95
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:31,613
Oh, uh, we open
in less than two weeks.

96
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,624
[sighs] That would be
a saving grace.

97
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,589
Actually, I'm the signer
on the account, not Mr. King.

98
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,509
Yeah. Oh, is that right?

99
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,305
Y-you can just change that back.

100
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,223
Under my name, yes.

101
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:53,894
Okay. Thank you, Marjorie.

102
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,814
[sighs]

103
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:07,824
[sighs]

104
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,583
-[Damon] I mean, and timing is--
-[Phyllis] I got you.

105
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,159
I can go bigger
if you want me to.

106
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,661
Just say the word, I got you.

107
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,421
If you need anything,
you just call me.

108
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,997
Okay. All right.

109
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,675
[instrumental music]

110
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,169
Oh.

111
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,138
-[chuckles]
-Oh.

112
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,685
I cannot wait for you
to walk down those stairs

113
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,312
on our wedding day.

114
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,349
How on Earth do you look
so chic? I mean, look at me.

115
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,685
-You look comfortable.
-Child, stop.

116
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,362
That's a nice way of saying
sloppy.

117
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,447
-Pick one?
-Uh-uh.

118
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,740
This is Damon's taco stand.

119
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:52,536
I was told
to just show up on the day.

120
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,204
Geometrics, please. Thank you.

121
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,699
-[cell phone beeps]
-Let me take care of this.

122
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,751
-I'll see you in a second.
-All right.

123
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,711
-[chuckles]
-Mm...

124
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,756
-This wedding keeps expanding.
-You're not happy?

125
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,384
I always thought I'd get married
in my grandfather's church.

126
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,211
You know,
something small, simple.

127
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,880
You should have seen the look
on Damon's face

128
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,723
when I suggested it, you would
have thought I asked the man

129
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,350
to marry me in a barn
or something.

130
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,477
[laughs] Well, he does love
this house, doesn't he?

131
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,554
-Mm.
-Okay.

132
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,606
-It's ostentatious.
-Yeah.

133
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:24,401
I mean, how many great rooms
does one need?

134
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,563
-I'm sorry, I don't...
-No! No, no, no.

135
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,065
You're my bride.
I'm here for it all.

136
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,567
-Even the complaints.
-Yeah.

137
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,737
-Now, how's Urban Utopia?
-Oh, it keeps evolving.

138
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,790
-[gasps] Okay, well?
-[chuckles] Yes.

139
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:42,377
Well, I want Urban Utopia
to be more than a spa.

140
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:45,338
I want women to come, like,
even if they just wanna

141
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,415
visit the sauna
or the quiet room

142
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,677
or have some tea and journal.

143
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,971
I want it to feel
like a sanctuary.

144
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,756
-I like that.
-Oh.

145
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,558
And we hired a hairstylist,

146
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,935
'cause you know what our hair
does with the steam.

147
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,439
Child, you have single-handedly
figured out the problem

148
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,608
for every black woman
using the spa.

149
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:07,769
I mean, seriously,
that's exactly what we need.

150
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,029
Always think about
everybody else.

151
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,656
-Mm. That sounds great.
-Babe.

152
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:12,824
Uh, we gotta go.

153
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,611
-Phyllis, tall one.
-Okay.

154
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,246
-All right, we're all good.
-You got me, huh?

155
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,831
Uh, we're in the final stretch
now. You guys ready?

156
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,000
-Yes, we are.
-All right.

157
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,377
[chuckles] Okay.

158
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:28,957
[Tiffanie] Hi, grandpa.

159
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,792
[Damon] We're ready.

160
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:35,430
-Uh, we finished the exercise.
-What did you discover?

161
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,307
Well, we discovered
that we pretty much

162
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,967
problem-solve the same.

163
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,969
-Mm-hmm.
-[Tiffanie] We're lists people.

164
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,972
We pretty much jot down
the areas of concern

165
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,399
and compare notes.

166
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:47,651
Well, good luck with that.

167
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,195
-[chuckles]
-Grandpa...

168
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,198
It takes years for couples
to learn how to argue

169
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,483
in a healthy manner.

170
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,818
How long have y'all
been together?

171
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,578
A year and a half.

172
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,990
Tiffanie, your grandmother and I
have been married over 55 years

173
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:05,159
and we're still
trying to figure it out.

174
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:09,497
-Well, maybe we're an anomaly.
-Maybe.

175
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,466
But I'm concerned that you all

176
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,677
are being completely honest
with each other.

177
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:17,389
Trying to please each other
is very temporary.

178
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:21,476
And the truth,
as ugly as it can be,

179
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,479
is the key
to a very successful marriage.

180
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,147
You understand?

181
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,067
We agree.

182
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:34,698
-Don't we, babe?
-Yes.

183
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,742
Now, I want you all
to read and discuss

184
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,912
Ephesians chapter five,

185
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:44,708
verse 25 through 30, okay?

186
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,211
Ooh! Sweet! Hm!

187
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,546
Boy, nice!

188
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,047
[indistinct commentary on TV]

189
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,215
Hm.

190
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,260
Babe, your shirt's unbuttoned.

191
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,878
Oh.

192
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:01,215
Oh, this game...
Man, I knew I should've went.

193
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,477
I'm here for my interview,
Mr. King.

194
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:09,149
[chuckles] Interview?

195
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:13,987
My name is Angela,
and I'm here for our interview.

196
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,615
But, oh, I,
I don't have any experience.

197
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,618
Is there anything I can do...

198
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,914
Baby, you're so beautiful.

199
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,627
But all this kinky stuff,
you know,

200
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:33,048
I kinda, I did that stuff
in the past life.

201
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,584
I wanna leave it there.

202
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:40,472
Now, what we have is, is pure
and I love it.

203
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,850
I need you to do me a favor,
though.

204
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,227
I need you to pick up Trey
for me.

205
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,981
Can't Magic do it?

206
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,693
Yeah, he can do it, but you know
I have the meeting with Jaleesa

207
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,437
and her record label,
and he just came home,

208
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,698
and I want you to do it for me.

209
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,609
[sighs]

210
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,953
[chuckles]

211
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,415
-It is Magic's job.
-Mm.

212
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,919
Trey's leaving right after
the wedding, right, baby?

213
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,132
I'm sorry, but the man just got
out of jail five seconds ago.

214
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,178
I know, but he's changed.
Give him a chance, okay?

215
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,391
What time does he land?

216
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,187
You know you're my angel, right?

217
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,151
[chuckles]

218
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,489
Come on! Damn!

219
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,118
[Tiffanie] I know Shelly doesn't
have a ton of experience,

220
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,619
but she's a single mom.

221
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:48,623
Mm, you know, she did give me
that bomb deep tissue,

222
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,918
but she's not coming in
with any existing clientele.

223
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,004
We're a new business, Tiff.
It's risky.

224
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,331
-We're hiring her.
-[scoffs]

225
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,334
-All right, boss-lady.
-[chuckles] What's next?

226
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,096
You gotta pick up El Chapo.

227
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,765
-Yeah.
-You want me to go with you?

228
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,059
No.

229
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,149
It's not getting
any better, Sonia.

230
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:19,854
I warned you, do not give it up
before marriage.

231
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,690
Are you really saying that if I
stayed a virgin until marriage,

232
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,860
the sex would have been better?

233
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,662
Look, it was for me.

234
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,198
So God is punishing me?

235
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,701
No, but there are consequences
to your actions.

236
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,703
But I can't re-virginize myself.

237
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,206
-And that is not a word.
-It is now.

238
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,841
[both laughing]

239
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,093
I feel like I should get points
for waiting as long as I did.

240
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,095
I was practically
the 30-year-old virgin

241
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,263
when I met Damon.

242
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,348
You're right, exactly.

243
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,392
I mean, you waited this long,
so you could have just waited

244
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,853
a couple of years longer, 'cause
y'all are getting married,

245
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,230
what, after only
a year and a half?

246
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,065
-Yeah.
-In the grand scheme of things--

247
00:12:56,193 --> 00:13:00,228
-I was just so ready.
-Yeah, to lose 'em draws.

248
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,113
[chuckles] Shut up!

249
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,284
[sighs] Okay.

250
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,827
How bad is it?

251
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,836
It's not, it's not terrible.

252
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,466
It's just vanilla yogurt.

253
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,751
But you, you look like

254
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:27,806
you like
that vanilla yogurt. Hm.

255
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,891
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm.

256
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,100
I was reading online...

257
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,727
Yeah, that's the problem
right there.

258
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,312
Do not ever go to the web

259
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,314
to self-diagnose yourself.

260
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,399
Uh-uh. Don't do that.

261
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,068
[doorbell rings]

262
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,165
Uh...

263
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,919
Ah, hm...

264
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,884
[instrumental music]

265
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,979
Oh.

266
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,106
Oh.

267
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,193
Baby.

268
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,116
[sighs]

269
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,653
That is a good man right there.

270
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,488
Talk you later.

271
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,957
Love you.

272
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,837
[Damon] The story of our lives
is just beginning.

273
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,391
And I can't wait to fill all
of these pages with you.

274
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,894
-[doorbell rings]
-[glass shatters]

275
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,106
Damnit! Ah...

276
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,484
Ah! Just a minute!

277
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,195
[groans]

278
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,239
[wincing]

279
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,371
Uh, can I help you?

280
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,369
Um, you're bleeding.

281
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,630
I'm Trey.
You're Tiffanie, right?

282
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,873
Oh. I was supposed
to pick you up. I'm sorry.

283
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,052
It's all good.
I got an earlier flight.

284
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,769
[chuckles]

285
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,355
-Vanilla yogurt.
-Hm.

286
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,150
What's wrong
with vanilla yogurt?

287
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,402
It's boring.

288
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:54,118
[sighs] You're not gonna
cause trouble here, are you?

289
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,622
I can go.

290
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,125
Trey?

291
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,046
I'm sorry. Come in.

292
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:18,101
[Tiffanie] I realized later that
Trey never answered my
question.

293
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,270
[exhales sharply] Does it hurt?

294
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,931
[sighs] I can do this.

295
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:27,360
No, you can't be trusted at all.

296
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,271
This one here for you.

297
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,773
[wincing]

298
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,776
Minute ago you were just trying
to kick me to the curb.

299
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,954
Now I'm your hero.

300
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,948
I wouldn't say all that.

301
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,918
Look, I'm sorry about what
I said earlier. It's just...

302
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:48,506
Damon has worked really hard
changing his image...

303
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,426
So you think I'm bad for him?

304
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,596
I don't know. Are you?

305
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,800
There you go.

306
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,302
Let's get you all healed up.

307
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:04,022
[mumbling]

308
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,777
-Thank you.
-You're good. You're welcome.

309
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,782
You ever been inside a cell?

310
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,993
Uh-uh.

311
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,655
There's no fresh air.
There's no trees.

312
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,001
Only nature you get
is cockroaches.

313
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:29,839
And everything's hard
like concrete.

314
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,508
Even the people.

315
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:36,837
I haven't seen anything
beautiful in seven years.

316
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,174
It's like, all this time

317
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:44,020
I've been cravin' things
I can't have.

318
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:49,692
And it's, it's just
been getting built up.

319
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,327
So I got to watch myself.

320
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,663
[Damon] Anybody home?

321
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,366
[chuckles]

322
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,376
Nice to meet you, Tiffanie.

323
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:13,841
[Trey] Yeah, somebody home.

324
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,594
[laughing] Oh, my dawg!

325
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,222
Ah...

326
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,140
Oh, I missed you, man.

327
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,266
-I missed you.
-A lot.

328
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,552
A lot of nice things here, man.

329
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:28,106
-I missed you, man.
-I missed you, too, brother.

330
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:31,317
-Look at all this, man.
-Let me show you something.

331
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,446
[Trey] Yeah, you got this. Yeah.

332
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,869
[instrumental music]

333
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,404
Half-back option pass.
The bottom line is...

334
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,206
You've always been a better
defensive player than offense.

335
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,074
Stop deflecting.

336
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,627
You had everybody
in the class believin'

337
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,129
that you were
the principal's nephew.

338
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,913
And even had the teachers
believing it.

339
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,716
Oh! That sounds like Damon.

340
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,252
Out of control. He'd been
out of control since then.

341
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,347
Hey, D, remember our first deal?

342
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,923
-Don't you tell that stor--
-Oh, bro, they jacked us--

343
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,433
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
We don't talk about...

344
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,476
I don't talk about that.

345
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,436
Especially in front of my lady.

346
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,263
Okay. My bad.

347
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:13,276
So, Tiffanie, how'd he bag
a dime piece like you?

348
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:17,071
I worked at King Enterprise.
That's how we met.

349
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:20,441
That's right, the first day
she was in the boardroom

350
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:21,659
trying to run things.

351
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,870
My pitch
made your company money.

352
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,705
You still work there, Tiff?

353
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,448
[Damon] No, she's about
to open up her own joint--

354
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:30,293
Hey, my man,
let your woman talk.

355
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:36,716
I'm excited, but all I can see
right now are problems.

356
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,635
Baby, I told you,

357
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,263
I can help you with that,
it's okay. I got you.

358
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,634
You can't just write a check
for everything, Damon.

359
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,812
So, D, how's your
mom and pops, bro?

360
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,982
They're happy that I'm finally
getting married.

361
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,310
Tiffanie,
your parents excited, too?

362
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,488
Well, her grandparents
raised her.

363
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,703
This tea, right here, dawg,
this tea is crazy, man. You...

364
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,655
-Can I get some more of this?
-Of course.

365
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,490
Baby, ba... Relax.

366
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,659
I'll go get it.
I'll get the tea.

367
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,962
-What happened to your finger?
-I cut it earlier.

368
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,006
-Oh.
-Baby, it's okay.

369
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,384
Uh, hey. Do not believe a word
that this man is telling you.

370
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,886
-I got you.
-Man...

371
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,723
-[Damon laughs]
-This guy right here, man.

372
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,187
I lost my parents, too.

373
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:36,350
[sighs] My mom was in a car
accident when I was a kid.

374
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,353
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-[Tiffanie] Thank you.

375
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,823
You know, Damon,
he was raised by the Huxtables,

376
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,659
you know what I'm saying?

377
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,027
At least when the Huxtables
meant somethin'.

378
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,362
Messed my boy,
I love him to death,

379
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:53,000
but... he don't know real pain.

380
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,711
Damon has a good heart.

381
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,214
Next to my grandfather,
he's the best man I know.

382
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:02,385
No doubt.
If you ever need to talk...

383
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,548
What'd I miss?
Here you go, bro.

384
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:08,716
Oh, thank you, brother,
appreciate that.

385
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,385
-I have to go.
-Babe, wait.

386
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:15,889
Where you going? Chef Louise
is about to hook up some steaks.

387
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:19,819
-Trey, you hungry?
-I can eat. I can always eat.

388
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,240
Yeah, I've got to meet
grandmother at the, uh,

389
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,701
the bridal shop.
I'll be back.

390
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,077
Uh-uh.

391
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,457
-I'll text you.
-Okay.

392
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,876
Bye, Tiffanie.

393
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,216
Mm-hmm. Mm.

394
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,888
Ain't got to make love
to it, man.

395
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:51,091
Man, you just don't know.

396
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,768
[chuckles]

397
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,596
Make sure you save some room
'cause Chef Louise is gonna

398
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,598
bring out that double-chocolate
pudding.

399
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,567
I'm telling you now, it's nuts.

400
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:03,270
Look, bro, I appreciate you
hooking up this trip.

401
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,273
Man, my room,
my room is something like

402
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,743
Obama was staying in.
You know what I'm sayin'?

403
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,202
It is crazy, bro!

404
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:14,123
I tell you, that's, uh,
Tiff's and I's favorite spot.

405
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,792
Mm. Mm-hmm.

406
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,962
Yeah, she's gonna be there
the night before our wedding.

407
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,298
What can I say?
My girl's traditional.

408
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,009
How traditional?

409
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,179
[laughing]

410
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:33,601
You know, I, I appreciate
all this, man. Yeah.

411
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:37,188
Trey... I got you, man.

412
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,566
You sure about that?

413
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,533
I know we got
some unfinished business.

414
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,411
But let's take care of it
after the wedding, okay?

415
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,624
-Fair enough.
-[chuckles]

416
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,632
-Hey, grams.
-[chuckles]

417
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,968
-Hey, bride.
-Oh. I'm so happy you're here.

418
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,887
Oh. I'm so happy, too. Oh.

419
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,015
We will see you at your final
fitting in just a few days.

420
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,392
And here's that other order.

421
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,176
Would you like me
to get you some tea?

422
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,896
-Uh, yeah. Tea would be nice.
-Mm.

423
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:26,529
Uh, Tiffanie, what's happening?

424
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,200
For you.

425
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:35,329
It's...
It's beautiful!

426
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,789
Oh!

427
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:41,001
Oh. I hope you and Damon
didn't spend a fortune on this.

428
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:44,255
Come on. Nothing is too good
for my grams.

429
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,008
[chuckles] Love blue,
love sparkles.

430
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:53,597
What's the matter?

431
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,229
Okay, come on.

432
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,232
Let's go sit down.

433
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,392
[Tiffanie] I was
clearly desperate.

434
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,236
Talking
to my saintly grandmother

435
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,280
about what was going on
in my head...

436
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,900
But that's how rattled I was
after meeting Trey.

437
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:15,569
So what's going on?

438
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,746
I'm going to tell you.

439
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,790
But you're not allowed
to smack me, grandma.

440
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,542
I'm grown now.

441
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,712
I can always smack you.

442
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,422
[laughs]

443
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:30,584
I'm not a virgin.

444
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,511
[coughs]

445
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,265
[laughs]

446
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:40,260
Did you think
I didn't know that?

447
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,397
Well, Damon is the only man
I've been with.

448
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:46,358
-Well, thank God for that.
-Yeah.

449
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:50,604
And I don't have anything
to compare him to, so this,

450
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:54,241
this is purely a gut feeling...

451
00:24:56,245 --> 00:25:01,248
but I think our sex life
might be lacking.

452
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,417
Oh.

453
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,955
Well, before we go down
the Viagra route--

454
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:11,625
No! Uh-uh! No.
That's not the problem.

455
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,762
I thought... I can't talk to you
about this.

456
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,181
Well, maybe I can help.

457
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,103
Was there ever a time

458
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:26,732
that you wanted to experience
another man?

459
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:33,313
I married your grandfather
when I was just a girl.

460
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,699
And I wouldn't change that.

461
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:41,705
But, yes,
there were some times when...

462
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:47,378
I became interested
in other men.

463
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:51,131
And that was challenging.

464
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:55,502
Was there a someone
that you ever felt a,

465
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,180
like, a real connection with?

466
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,141
"Walk in the Spirit,

467
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,343
and you will not give way

468
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:06,680
to the desires of the flesh."

469
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:11,902
Our marriage vows
are not just for our husband...

470
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,688
they're for God.

471
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,908
And whenever I was tempted,

472
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:20,786
I reminded myself of that.

473
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,498
Is there someone

474
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:29,628
that you are craving for?

475
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:33,882
No.

476
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:38,137
No, grandma.

477
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:43,726
Do you love Damon? Hm?

478
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,146
Yes.

479
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,567
Do you feel it in there?

480
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,064
Mm-hmm.

481
00:26:57,158 --> 00:27:00,993
Then it's real. Mm.

482
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,954
God made this union, baby.

483
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,909
He wants you and Damon
to be together.

484
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:11,545
But you watch out.

485
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:15,466
You watch out for the devil
because he will be on the hunt.

486
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:20,304
So you watch out for him.
You hear?

487
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,473
[Tiffanie] Was Trey the devil?

488
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,517
Was he sent
as some kind of test?

489
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:28,312
I don't know, but I intended
to avoid him

490
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,897
at all costs.

491
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,278
[instrumental music]

492
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,530
[whirring]

493
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,908
Let me hire more people,

494
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,494
I'll get you up and ready
by opening day.

495
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,953
[clears throat]

496
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:48,448
Were you supposed to be
in this meeting?

497
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,793
Well, hello to you, too.

498
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:56,790
Warner, can you do me a favor
and brief Tiffanie?

499
00:27:56,884 --> 00:28:00,460
Yeah, sorry to make you recap,
Warner.

500
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,970
No problem.

501
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,516
The patio can't be salvaged.

502
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,686
And we're blowing circuits
all over the place,

503
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:12,356
so I suggest
we rewire the whole place.

504
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,566
-Ah...
-Mm.

505
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,152
How much?

506
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,446
Uh...

507
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:26,653
[chuckles] We are hemorrhaging
money at this point.

508
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,372
Let me take care of the tab.

509
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:33,168
[clears throat]
I, I can do the rewiring.

510
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,131
Yeah, I mean,
just buy the supplies.

511
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,498
I won't charge for labor.

512
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,427
I can set up each room
on its own GFI outlet,

513
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:45,347
um, that way, like, let's say a
circuit blows in this room, th--

514
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,974
[Tiffanie] We could keep
the spa running.

515
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,308
Yeah. Exactly.

516
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:51,520
Well, hell,
if you won't hire him, I will.

517
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,605
Man knows his stuff.

518
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:56,150
So what's it gonna be?

519
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,611
We need a beat to discuss.

520
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:04,357
Uh, that's fine, but if you
wanna be ready and open,

521
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,201
I need to know ASAP.

522
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,288
Okay. Can you guys
just give us a moment?

523
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:10,914
-Please?
-Sure.

524
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:18,371
-Why didn't you wait for me?
-Time is money, Tiff.

525
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,799
And you were late.
We had to start the meeting.

526
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,210
I don't want you
to use Trey, okay?

527
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:26,180
-Why?
-'Cause I wanna offer him a job.

528
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,883
I need to see
where his head is at first.

529
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,102
-I'll hire someone else.
-Mm-hmm.

530
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:35,314
You just work out your stuff
with Trey.

531
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,390
[Damon] Do you know
how much I love you?

532
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,559
Mm-hmm.

533
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:43,781
Okay. Go, go, go.
Go. I've gotta get to work.

534
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,076
[Rhona] So if the role play
don't work,

535
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:50,913
we're gonna bring out
the big guns.

536
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,916
Don't fret, baby,
we're gonna change

537
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,585
that funky sex life around.

538
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,580
You see these pills right here?

539
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,801
It's gonna get you just right.

540
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,388
-[clears throat]
-Trey!

541
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:12,142
[Rhona] So if the role play
don't work, we're gonna change

542
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:15,354
that funky sex life around.
You see these pills?

543
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,980
[clears throat]

544
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:21,443
Uh, that was,
I was, uh, researching.

545
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,104
Uh, so what are you doing here?

546
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:26,073
I've been thinking about you.

547
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,451
Tiffanie, you need me.

548
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,996
You need me to...

549
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,332
you need me
to do your rewiring.

550
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:37,626
Oh.

551
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:40,254
Mm-hm.

552
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,840
Right. Rewiring.

553
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:46,459
-What's all this?
-Oh, these are essential oils.

554
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:49,462
We use them for treatments.
Yeah.

555
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:52,299
That's eucalyptus.

556
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:55,135
[sighs]
It's very therapeutic and, uh...

557
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:57,470
They actually, they smell
way better on the body.

558
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:01,024
-You got some on?
-Mm-hmm.

559
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:04,027
My, uh, my wrist.

560
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,315
Mm.

561
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:10,650
-You got something else on?
-Lavender.

562
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,495
-Ah, yeah.
-Yeah, it's calming. Mm-hmm.

563
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,873
Man, that's nice, that's nice.

564
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:19,751
Well, look, I'm not leaving
until you say yes.

565
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:25,257
-Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right.

566
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:31,763
Yeah, can we just, uh,
keep this between us?

567
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,766
Until I tell Damon, that is.

568
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:37,510
-Oh. It's cool.
-Okay.

569
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:40,355
Let's do another one, um...

570
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,734
How about this one right here.

571
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,518
This looks like rose.

572
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:48,697
-That's rose. Mm-hmm.
-That's rose?

573
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,825
[instrumental music]

574
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:00,751
Um...

575
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,755
-[Tiffanie clears throat]
-That's nice.

576
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:08,550
That's real nice.

577
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,598
[Tiffanie] I should have said no
to Trey.

578
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:18,101
But my common sense
had been hijacked.

579
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,854
I was in the throes of lust.

580
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,064
[exhales sharply]

581
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,699
Must've been some night.

582
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,118
What do you mean?

583
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:38,071
You slept in your clothes.
Here.

584
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,625
[sighs]
I'm so tired, babe.

585
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,586
[exhales sharply]

586
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,716
You know, everybody wants to be
a entrepreneur.

587
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,426
They all want the glory,
but they don't wanna

588
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,261
put in the work.

589
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:57,641
But you, you been grindin'
since day one and...

590
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,311
I'm so proud.

591
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:04,064
Thank you, Damon.

592
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,444
You know, I was up late
last night, too.

593
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:15,275
I just kept replaying
that look on your face

594
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:19,496
when, uh, you walked in
to the meeting. You were hurt.

595
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,457
And I was the cause of that.

596
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:26,503
And I don't ever
wanna hurt you, Tiff.

597
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,458
It wasn't intentional.

598
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:34,428
No. I could do better.

599
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:38,965
I'm gonna take a step back,
you hear me?

600
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:42,060
And if you want my help,
you're gonna have to ask for it

601
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:43,645
from here on out.

602
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,772
Deal.

603
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,945
So what's the plan today?

604
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:54,647
My surprise bridal shower
is today.

605
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:57,325
Wait.
You already know about it?

606
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:59,152
Sonia knows I wanna look good.

607
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,413
[chuckles]

608
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,082
Well...

609
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:07,419
Mm-mm! I haven't brushed
my teeth yet, baby.

610
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,172
-You think I care?
-Oh, you should.

611
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,642
All right.

612
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,729
[inhales sharply]

613
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,856
Mm!

614
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:30,776
-Lavender.
-Mm-hmm.

615
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:41,787
[cell phone beeps]

616
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,958
[Tiffanie]
Hey Sonia, something came up,

617
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:49,419
I'll just be a few minutes
late. okay?

618
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,838
[upbeat music]

619
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,966
[knocking on door]

620
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,565
[Trey] What up, Tiff?

621
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:15,562
Hey, I came by to talk
about the light fixtures.

622
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:18,731
You didn't have to come
all the way down here for that.

623
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,568
They're pretty important,
actually,

624
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,245
the fixtures, aesthetically.

625
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:27,240
So... can I come in?

626
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:30,210
Yeah. I'm sorry. Come on in.

627
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,546
[music continues]

628
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,924
So I know I said those first,

629
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:48,261
but I have landed on that one.

630
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:50,430
What do you like about that one?

631
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:53,608
Ah, it's delicate, but, um,

632
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:57,770
it seems pretty robust.
You know what I mean?

633
00:35:57,865 --> 00:36:02,409
I m... I mean...
[winces] Oh, shoot.

634
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,288
-Hm.
-What's wrong?

635
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:09,499
Was playing a little basketball
and I think I pulled somethin'.

636
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:10,917
-Oh.
-Right there.

637
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,119
Hm.

638
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,629
Oh. Um...

639
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:17,007
Right there.

640
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:20,760
-Feel that?
-Yeah, actually, I, I do.

641
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,637
Okay.

642
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,183
Let me just, uh...

643
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:27,559
Right there.

644
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,940
-[cell phone beeps]
-[gasps]

645
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,609
[exhales sharply]

646
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:42,199
Um... I have to go.

647
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,816
You gotta go right now?

648
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:47,454
Yeah. Uh, I gotta go.

649
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,469
I mean, uh, can you believe
that she's on her third divorce?

650
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,804
-With six kids?
-Like, can you keep a man?

651
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,765
-Hey!
-Oh!

652
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,642
-Oh! Surprise!
-Surprise!

653
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:12,103
Oh, my goodness!

654
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:13,563
I had no idea!

655
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:16,399
-We know! We know.
-[chuckling]

656
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:18,443
-Hey, beautiful!
-Hey.

657
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:22,155
Oh, Sonia, when did you have
time to decorate?

658
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,532
-[chuckles] Whatever, Tiff.
-[chuckles]

659
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,743
[pop music playing]

660
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:33,366
So, and that's like, three
different kids...

661
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,502
My car wouldn't start.

662
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,007
Girl...

663
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,803
I know when you're lying.

664
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,937
This really is beautiful.

665
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:58,358
Well... wait till
you see the cake.

666
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,735
-[Brenna] Ooh!
-Can I say what this one is?

667
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,730
-Go out with a bang.
-Whoa.

668
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,898
-Oh...
-Mm-hmm.

669
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:08,735
-[Brenna] I got you lace.
-[laughter]

670
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:11,997
It's about being classy
and naughty.

671
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:15,292
-[laughter]
-[Tiffanie] So give me the real.

672
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,545
Does sex get better or worse
over time?

673
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,673
Oh, girl, every marriage
is different, right?

674
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,083
-Yeah, yeah, we schedule it.
-Wait, what?

675
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:27,387
Okay, wait, so I, you know,
I schedule nail appointments,

676
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:31,424
hair appointments,
but I have never scheduled a...

677
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,761
Yeah. Have three kids
and then come talk to me.

678
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:37,430
Oh, you got it. Okay.

679
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:41,318
Have any of you
ever had an affair?

680
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:45,780
Okay, you know what?
Ground rules.

681
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,909
Uh, no guilt-trippin',
code of silence.

682
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:51,778
-Okay.
-Okay.

683
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:55,248
Have you two done anything?

684
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,283
-He touched my wrist.
-[laughs]

685
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:59,753
Okay. Wait a minute.
It's not funny.

686
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,287
-We cannot laugh.
-No.

687
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,791
You mean to tell me
this man touched your wrist

688
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:06,676
and got you acting like that?

689
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:11,306
-I wasn't done. Um, he...
-Okay.

690
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,600
He grazed my neck with his...

691
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,478
-With his?
-With his, his what?

692
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:19,439
-His lips, Janice, okay?
-Oh.

693
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,901
-[laughs] Okay.
-Wrists and lips, girl...

694
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:26,196
Sometimes I wonder,
have I ever experienced

695
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:30,533
everything I need to experience?

696
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,827
I, um, ahem...

697
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,455
I stepped out on Drew.

698
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,665
What?

699
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:40,585
-[Sonia] When?
-Couple of years ago.

700
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,330
We've been trying
to work it out ever since.

701
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:47,166
Been to therapy,
couples retreats, you name it,

702
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,637
and it just hasn't been
the same.

703
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:56,008
Tiffanie, word of advice.

704
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:58,436
It's not worth it.

705
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:05,318
Okay, this is a bridal shower,

706
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:07,195
not Fix My Life.

707
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,021
[laughter]

708
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:12,024
-Tiffanie girl, we love you.
-Yeah.

709
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,527
-And Damon's a good man.
-Mm-hmm.

710
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:18,665
He's gorgeous,
and most importantly,

711
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,033
he loves some Tiffanie.

712
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:23,378
[Janice] Yeah. Yeah, he does.
[Sonia] He does.

713
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,004
Look, we are your tribe, girl,

714
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,040
and we are here to protect you,
so, ladies, let's make sure

715
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:30,710
we stay prayed up for Tiff,
all right?

716
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,095
You might wanna start
them prayers now.

717
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,889
-You think?
-After communion.

718
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,382
[laughter]

719
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,226
[Brenna] We love you, girl.
[Kaya] Love you.

720
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,728
♪ Tell me what you wanna do

721
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:43,648

723
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:48,945
Chef Louise, thank you.

724
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:53,399
[Damon] Come on now,
say something.

725
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,869
I never thought I could make
this kinda money going legit.

726
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,580
This is crazy!

727
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:01,082
But I got some things I gotta
take care of at the house.

728
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:04,294
Come on now, talk to me, man.

729
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:08,089
I ain't seen my son yet.

730
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:11,009
Wait.
Since you've been released?

731
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,219
Yeah.

732
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:15,430
It's been like four months, man.
What you been doing?

733
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:18,641
I've been working. I ain't
trying to go home empty-handed.

734
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,853
I was right there when your pops
pulled a no-show every weekend.

735
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,689
All those hours you waited
for his ass to show up.

736
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:28,485
You know what it's like
to not have a father around.

737
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,769
[Eric] Hey, hey.

738
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:33,031
-[Damon] Hey. Ah.
-Yeah, what's happenin'?

739
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:37,109
Hey, Trey, this is Eric,
my chief operating officer,

740
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,037
my confidante and all that.

741
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:42,582
Uh, Eric, this is Trey, that's
my brother from another mother.

742
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,293
Trey, yeah,
I've heard wonderful things.

743
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,128
-I'm honored.
-Well, listen, uh...

744
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:50,632
I come bearing exciting news.

745
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,217
We have landed Justus.

746
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:55,386
-Oh, yes! Ah-ah!
-Yes.

747
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:57,931
-Oh, man, I am so proud of you!
-[Eric] Hey.

748
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,799
-Thanks for giving me the shine.
-I knew you had it.

749
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:03,636
I knew you had it. Ah! Whoa!

750
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,355
I'm telling you,
let's drink to this.

751
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,357
Yeah.

752
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,976
This is it, Trey,
definitely wanna jump on there.

753
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,195
It's actually
a really generous offer, Trey.

754
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,148
Yeah, our entry-level positions
actually start out at half that.

755
00:42:16,243 --> 00:42:19,285
Well, I'm worth it, though.

756
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:20,787
Ain't I, bruh?

757
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:24,657
Hey, bro, but how about
we have some sushi, huh?

758
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:26,826
-Mm. Hey.
-Yeah.

759
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,327
So where'd you go to school,
man?

760
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:31,047
Uh, Vanderton.
Well, for law school, that is.

761
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:34,500
-[Trey] Vanderton. Wow.
-Yeah. Uh-huh.

762
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,262
I'm trying for my GED.
You think I can get in there?

763
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:40,006
I mean, brother, I think
you could do anything you want.

764
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,474
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

765
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,685
-[Eric] Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
-Yeah, right.

766
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:46,771
Oh, man, you know,
back in the day--

767
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,148
You know what?
Let's bow our heads, okay?

768
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,401
[Eric] Dear Heavenly Father,
please bless the food

769
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:55,113
that is on our plates and bless
the hands that prepared it.

770
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:58,524
In Your Son's name we pray.
Amen.

771
00:42:58,618 --> 00:42:59,951
Amen.

772
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,912
Like I was saying, you know,
back in the day,

773
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,530
the only lawyer
Damon ever needed

774
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,541
was a public defender.
You know what I'm sayin'?

775
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:08,376
Please, do not tell
those stories.

776
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:09,869
Ah, this-this one's funny, man.

777
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:12,371
Look, it was like
a buck twenty and--

778
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:15,592
Damn it! Trey, please.

779
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:17,302
I said enough.

780
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:21,264
Well, let's have some sushi,
all right?

781
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:24,100
[Damon] It's a good day. Hey.
[Eric] Yeah.

782
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:35,111
[Tiffanie] Do you think we
should have waited till marriage

783
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,821
to have sex?

784
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:39,198
Do you?

785
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,118
[Tiffanie] I don't know.

786
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,371
Maybe.

787
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,544
And why are you asking this now?

788
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:57,050
Hm, maybe we should try.

789
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:01,512
Try what, baby?

790
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,557
Celibacy.

791
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:08,269
Let's wait
until our wedding night.

792
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:10,855
You okay?

793
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:15,276
[chuckles]
That is just silly.

794
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,820
Why is it silly?

795
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:22,200
Because we're get married
in a couple of days.

796
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:27,038
-So what's the point?
-[sighs] Forget it.

797
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:30,282
Oh, what, what's goin' on
with you?

798
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:33,628
You have not been
acting like yourself lately.

799
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:36,339
What, is a wisp of hair
out of place?

800
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:44,964
Well, where are you going?
Back to your apartment?

801
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:46,432
[sighs]

802
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,686
Downstairs.

803
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:51,229
Cooling off.

804
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:56,192
[dramatic music]

805
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:22,969
Trey...

806
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:27,432
Yes.

807
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:29,100
[Damon] Tiffanie?

808
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,024
Compromise?

809
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:41,738
What?

810
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:47,368
Pastor Cooper said
that compromise

811
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:50,455
was one of the bedrocks
of marriages.

812
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,377
And if you wanna be celibate,
it's okay with me.

813
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:02,133
[sighs] Thank you.

814
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:06,012
The food tasting's at 4:00,
and I want you to come.

815
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:12,018
What? You actually
want to include me?

816
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,353
Yes. And I have a surprise
for you.

817
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:15,721
And if you don't show up,

818
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,890
I'm gonna start buying you
Prince CDs.

819
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,650
[both laughing]

820
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:21,736
Love Jones.

821
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:24,238
Come on, challenge me.

822
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:30,036
Tiff, you still love me?

823
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:33,664
Of course I do, silly.

824
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:37,835
Okay. I'll see you then.

825
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,631
[Damon chuckles]

826
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:46,928
[instrumental music]

827
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:06,605
-What are you doing?
-Nothing. Damn!

828
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:09,608
Since when did we start talking
to each other like that?

829
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:11,277
I don't have time for this.

830
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:13,287
You were supposed to wire me
the money.

831
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:16,666
We had to press pause
on some stuff.

832
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,417
I'll handle it.

833
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:22,046
-Are you sure, boss-lady?
-Yeah.

834
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,625
[Tiffanie] I was officially
in the danger zone.

835
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,054
Not handling my business,
being a bad friend

836
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:33,432
and a worse fiancee.
I didn't know this woman.

837
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:37,270
This self-destructive mess
was a stranger to me.

838
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:42,149
-I got two sandwiches.
-I can't. I'm meeting Damon.

839
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:45,528
Come on. Even CEOs got to eat.

840
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:48,573
All right. What you got?

841
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:56,247
This is the one
with him in his costume.

842
00:47:56,332 --> 00:48:00,543
Aww, look
at your little superhero.

843
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:03,504
Aww, it must have been
really hard to be away from him.

844
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:04,714
It was.

845
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,999
So, why a spa?

846
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:10,011
Oh, self-care, you know,

847
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:12,004
it strengthens the foundation.

848
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:15,507
Alleviates stress,
which increases happiness.

849
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:19,520
You'd be surprised what
a simple head massage would do.

850
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,606
I've never had one.

851
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:24,016
-No way.
-Ever.

852
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,359
Come here.

853
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:32,199
Mm! Okay.

854
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:34,577
Damn, girl.

855
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:39,749
[intense music]

856
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:49,541
Trey, we can't.

857
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:52,637
Baby, we've already started.

858
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:58,517
[instrumental music]

859
00:48:58,603 --> 00:48:59,718
[footsteps approaching]

860
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,270
[Phyllis] Everything is ready.

861
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:05,232
Heard anything yet?

862
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,904
You know, she's probably
just caught up at work.

863
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,565
Yeah.

864
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,701
Let's stick with the lobster.

865
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:17,736
Okay.

866
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:21,374
Well, the, uh, stylists

Y'all know I don't like
to get too raunchy,

1214
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,560
but sex feels good.

1215
01:13:19,646 --> 01:13:21,729
-Come on, somebody!
-[indistinct chatter]

1216
01:13:21,815 --> 01:13:24,148
[Cooper] But you know
what the problem is,

1217
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:27,068
you got to pay the piper.

1218
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:28,986
If you gonna invite
the devil in

1219
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:33,282
and you gonna dance with
the devil, you gotta pay up!

1220
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:34,575
You gonna pay the devil back

1221
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:37,912
the way
he wants to be paid back.

1222
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:42,750
And the reason for that is
because now the devil owns you!

1223
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:45,795
[indistinct chatter]

1224
01:13:46,673 --> 01:13:48,539
[woman] Come on, pastor.

1225
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:52,552
But I'm here to tell you,
God ain't going nowhere.

1226
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:54,545
[congregation] Amen!

1227
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:57,765
[Cooper] Now, you may, uh,
turn your back on God,

1228
01:13:57,851 --> 01:14:02,052
but you see, God ain't gonna
never turn his back on you.

[Sonia] You seem better.

1232
01:14:15,577 --> 01:14:19,370
[Tiffanie] I am. I don't know
what's next, though.

1233
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:22,373
Well, how about opening up
Urban Utopia?

1234
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:27,211
You do remember the spa, right?
Your lifelong dream?

1235
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:31,632
-I blew the opening.
-Look, we'll open when we open.

1236
01:14:34,888 --> 01:14:36,754
Enough, sis.

1237
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:39,807
Look, you gotta stop
giving Trey all your power.

1238
01:14:48,485 --> 01:14:49,901
Okay.

1239
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:54,822
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

1240
01:14:54,908 --> 01:14:56,941
Let's do it.

1241
01:14:57,035 --> 01:14:59,368
Hm. I got you, girl.

1242
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:01,621
[Sonia] So listen,
I did get some things,

1243
01:15:01,748 --> 01:15:02,947
the color scheme
that you wanted.

1244
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,457
Don't you even worry about that.

1245
01:15:06,711 --> 01:15:08,628
[knocking on door]

1246
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:35,312
I came to say thank you.

1247
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:37,982
When you said that I was hiding,
you were right.

1248
01:15:38,076 --> 01:15:40,826
I'm glad I could do you a solid.
Looks like my job is done here.

1249
01:15:40,954 --> 01:15:45,665
My only regret is that
I hurt Damon in the process.

1250
01:15:47,252 --> 01:15:49,210
He's a good man, Trey.

1251
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:52,838
Whatever happened between you,

1252
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:56,092
he would never hurt you
intentionally.

1253
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:58,553
This girl
trying to guilt-trip me?

1254
01:15:58,638 --> 01:16:01,931
Just so you know, I didn't lose
a wink of sleep last night.

1255
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:03,224
Okay?

1256
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:21,025
-Father God in heaven--
-Oh, damn, here we go.

1257
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:24,203
Please heal
Brother Trey's heart.

1258
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:28,207
Please remove that anger.

1259
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:32,044
-Set him free, Lord.
-Look.

1260
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:33,546
Hey, get the hell
outta here with all that.

1261
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:35,840
I'm not doin' all that.

1262
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:42,880
Let him know

1263
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:47,051
the way to freedom
is forgiveness,

1264
01:16:47,145 --> 01:16:50,146
because there is good in him.

1265
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:52,648
-Leave.
-He's a good man, Lord.

1266
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:55,818
He's just in pain.

1267

Please let him know
that he's loved,

1268
01:17:00,575 --> 01:17:02,491
that he matters.

1269
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:07,997

Um, I didn't wanna do this,
um, on your voicemail, I...

1275
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:50,948
You just,
you won't take my calls. I...

1276
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:54,284
And you have,
you have every right not to.

1277
01:17:54,379 --> 01:17:56,587
I want you to know, though...

1278
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:03,552
I will never stop loving you,
Damon King.

1279
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:05,221
Ever.

1280
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:08,933
My soul has this...

1281
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:13,979
this big, gaping hole in it
and...

1282
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:21,278
[sighs] I'm so sorry.

1283
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:27,201
I should have never tried to be
perfect, 'cause I'm far from it.

1284
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:33,582
But I like this Tiffanie, too.

1285
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:36,377
And, you know...

1286
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:39,505
and I want you to meet her.

1287
01:18:42,093 --> 01:18:44,510
I hope you call me back, Damon.

1288
01:18:49,142 --> 01:18:54,270
Even if it takes 50 years,
I hope you call me back.

1289
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:00,443
I love you, Damon.

[Trey] I don't know
what's up with your boys.

1292

Wilding on me.
You better tell 'em who I am.

1293
01:19:30,183 --> 01:19:31,849
You slept with Tiffanie?

1294
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:36,553
-You abandoned me that night.
-I told you to pack it in.

1295
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:39,064
I gave you a call as soon as
I found out the place was hot.

-You left me a voicemail!
-I got two strikes!

And I wasn't doing life
for your greedy ass!

You know what your problem is?

1299

You have always been hard-headed
and you ain't shit!

Your girl would disagree.

1301
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:59,460
Look at you.
She got you whipped like that.

1302
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:01,587
I didn't sleep with her.

1303
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:04,924
I could've, though.

1304
01:20:05,051 --> 01:20:07,092
You should have came after me.

1305

No fun in that, playboy.

1306
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:13,974
You got to take better care
of your women, D.

1307

This was like
taking candy from a baby.

Damon, what happened?

1329
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:53,532
Why?

1330
01:21:56,454 --> 01:21:59,079
He-he was just a deflection.

1331
01:22:11,928 --> 01:22:16,513
I just couldn't get a grasp on
what was happening between us.

1332
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:20,017
And I, and honestly
I don't know if you...

1333
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:25,564
if you saw me
for who I really am.

1334
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:29,393
And that scared me.

1335

You're an amazing man, Damon.

1336
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:36,533
Please tell me
you didn't do anything stupid.

1337
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:38,410
I came close.

1338

But that's not me anymore, Tiff.
