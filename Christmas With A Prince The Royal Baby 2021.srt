181
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:20,837
in an inappropriate manner.

182
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:28,497
But you must always remain
one step ahead of them,

183
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,759
at all times.

184
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,673
[giggles]

185
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:38,507
The best course of action is
to turn the tables on them,

186
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:40,248
and ask them a
question in return.

187
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:42,554
I'm sorry Your Royal Highness.
Am I boring you at all?

188
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:43,817
[stifles a giggle]

189
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:48,125
[Alexander and Tasha laugh]

190
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:55,393
Your interview technique
is absolutely awful.

191
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,744
Now, at least we can
make you look the part.

192
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:08,624
For a two weeks trip, a
Princess traditionally requires

193
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:12,367
a minimum of 38
unique ensembles.

194
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:14,021
[Tasha]
Seriously?

195
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:16,719
Where the style of the
Royal Family is concerned,

196
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:19,461
I'm always serious.

197
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:24,248
Sporting attire, formal
attire, interview ensembles,

198
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:30,472
lunch-ready looks, gowns, ball
gowns, red carpet eye-catchers,

199
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,651
respectable cocktail hour
style, wardrobe for teas,

200
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:39,307
conservative business looks
for diplomatic photos,

201
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:43,137
active wear for planned
candid outdoor walk photos,

202
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:46,488
and that's just for
the first three days.

203
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:49,796
Ideally all with an
additional dozen as backup,

204
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:52,668
just in case of emergency.

205
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,801
[Tasha]
Emergency?

206
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:57,194
Besides a spill,
what could happen?

207
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,893
With you, Ma'am, I believe
anything is possible.

208
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,590
Aw...

209
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,419
[Tasha] Well, I'm sure I can
figure something out

210
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:05,725
with the clothes
I already have.

211
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:10,294
What do you think?

212
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:12,644
Hmmm.

213
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,604
How do you feel?

214
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:19,956
Um, well...

215
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,051
Like I might need some help.

216
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:31,663
That's what I'm here for,
Your Royal Highness.

217
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:34,536
Let's get to work!

218
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:49,856
Oh!

219
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:52,119
How do you feel now?

220
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,257
I feel ready.

221
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:03,043
What do you say, Blevins?

222
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:07,482
We've done all we can.

223
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:09,049
Time to go!

224
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:30,374
For my beautiful wife
on her first royal tour.

225
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:32,028
Oh Alec!

226
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:35,118
It's beautiful.

227
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,860
You're such a fabulous husband.

228
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:40,645
Only because I have
a fabulous wife.

229
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:26,343
[Alexander]
Darling,

230
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:30,870
[Tasha laughs]
That's easy for you to say!

231
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,610
You just need a few
suits and a tuxedo.

232
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:34,917
You're forgetting about
my military jacket

233
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:36,571
with all the medals
and ribbons.

234
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,138
It's very heavy.

235
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:39,052
[Tasha laughs]

236
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:41,793
I'm so glad that you're here.

237
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,273
How are you feeling?

238
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,188
I'm excited!

239
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,190
A little tired.

240
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:50,541
But mainly I'm craving a big
old American cheeseburger.

241
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:53,980
Now the first stop is
the ribbon-cutting

242
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,766
of the new San Savarre wing at
the Natural Historical Society.

243
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:00,987
No, the first stop
is Burger Cave.

244
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:39,068
Ummm...

245
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,375
One of the many
reasons I love you.

246
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:45,422
On behalf of the
country of San Savarre,

247
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:48,556
I'm sorry you had to
witness that spectacle.

248
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:50,340
It's so good. So good!

249
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:51,428
Uh huh.

250
00:15:57,782 --> 00:15:59,871

peek at the baby bump,

Very good, Sir.

It's been brilliant!

291
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:09,175
Oh, I must congratulate
both of you

292
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:11,655
on your extraordinary
diplomatic skills.

293
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:14,876
You have far exceeded my
hopes and expectations.

294
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,748
You have endeared yourselves
and, by extension,

295
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:21,100
all of San Savarre to
North Americans everywhere.

296

It's been our pleasure, Father.

297

reports have been exceptional.

Oh and Tasha, your
personal touch, well,

00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:32,546
may be a little non-traditional,
has worked like a charm!

Well done!

301
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,202
You're very welcome,
Father-in-law.

302
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,726
So, just one last stop,

303
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:41,903
and then we have to get you on
that plane back to San Savarre!

304
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:44,558
I was actually hoping we could
spend a little extra time

305
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,299
in my hometown.

306
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:48,692
I'm just, I'm so excited
to see my brother Jeff.

307
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,738
Yeah, I know it's
important to Bella too.

308
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:53,175
She has some personal time
booked while we're there.

309
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:55,438
Oh. Is that so?

00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:56,526
Um...

I think.

312
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:05,274
Do you think it's wise
to delay your departure?

313
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,971
Tasha is carrying a
very important part

314
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:08,886
of San Savarre with her.

315
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:12,368
I'm sure she's eager
to get our heir home

as soon and as
safely as possible.

317
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,590
Well I...

318
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:18,069
I can assure you, Sir,

319
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:19,897
that I will escort the Prince
and Princess onto the plane

320
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:21,986
in accordance with our
original time line.

321
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,294
And before any potential flight
restrictions for the Princess.

322
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:27,905
Time is of the essence!

323
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:31,039
You don't want to let the
country down, do you Tasha?

324
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:34,782
You absolutely must
get home on time.

I thought you hated tea.

326
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:56,195
[Jeff]
Oh, I do.

327
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:58,109
It tastes like dirty dishwater.

328
00:19:58,284 --> 00:20:00,373
But Bella loves it.

329
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:03,463
And, I put a ring inside.

330
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,638
Because today's the
day that I'm gonna...

331
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:06,161
No, don't care.

332
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:07,858
We've got enough going on with
this whole Royal production.

333
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:13,255
All this planning and protocols
are taking me away from my...

334
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:15,649
and making me lose
my patience.

335
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,912
Ha! I see what you did
there, Dr. G. Good one!

337
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:22,656
But surely you're excited about
the new wing they're opening?

338
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,310
Of course I am.

339
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:25,572
I just think it would
be so much easier

if they didn't have to
come here to open it.

Coming through.

It's so good to finally see
the little boy or girl!

-Good to see you, brother!
-Hey, brother!

00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:54,122
Or should I say, Dad-to-be?

351
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,432
Hello.
What can I do for you?

352
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:01,260
Excuse me Prince Alexander.

353
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:03,784
May we please show you something
we made in the craft room?

354
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:05,002
I would love that.

355
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,395
Lead the way.

356
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:11,226
'Craft room' is not
on the itinerary!

357
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:14,925
Okay, come on now.
Come on then.

358
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:16,057
Here we go.

359
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:23,456
[slurping]

360
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:39,994
Hey.

361
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:41,256
Hi.

362
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:45,826
It is so great to see you.

363
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,176
It's nice to see you too.

364
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:53,137
Come here!

365
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:57,446
-Ahem.
-Oh right.

366
00:21:58,882 --> 00:21:59,753
Hmmm.

367
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,512
Well, it seems like you're
holding down the fort over here.

368
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:21,340
Yeah, yeah.

369
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,907
Dr. Gonzales still isn't a big
fan of my hilarious jokes,

370
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:26,170
but she's seems to be coming
around on my nursing skills.

371
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,650
Well, that's because you're
great at what you do.

372
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:29,173
Minus the jokes, of course.

373
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,697
Very nice.

374
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:33,264
Ah, how about you?
How are you doing? Really?

375
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:35,484
I'm good. Yeah.
I'm, I'm really good!

376
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:38,966
Okay. Now, I know that face.

377
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:40,750
What's going on?

378
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:43,013
It's just...

379
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:45,189
I slowed down my work schedule

380
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,277
when we found out
I was pregnant.

381
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,497
King's orders.

382
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:50,499
And, I miss practicing.

383
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:52,458
I really miss the kids.

384
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:54,547
There are so many of
them that need help.

385
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:56,766
Can you believe that there isn't
a dedicated children's hospital

386
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:58,594
in San Savarre?

387
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:00,727
I just wish I could
be more helpful.

388
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:02,293
It's just for now.
It's not forever.

389
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:03,773
You know that?

390
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,514
I don't know about that.

391
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:07,864
I don't know if I can
handle having a family and

392
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:11,390
Royal duties, while maintaining
a career that I love.

393
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:14,175
You can handle anything
you put your mind to, Tash.

394
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:16,220
That's always been true.

395
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:17,961
You really think so?

396
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:19,833
I know so.

397
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:24,011
And I might be able to help.

398
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:26,492
Ah, there's this
special case that only

399
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:29,799
your outstanding doctoring
abilities can help with.

400
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:31,018
Would you be willing
to take a look?

401
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:32,802
Yes. Absolutely.

402
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:33,716
Right this way.

403
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:38,460
-Scalpel.
-Scalpel.

404
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,899
-Forceps.
-Forceps.

405
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:47,861
-Felt.
-Felt?

406
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:49,819
Yes, felt. It's the
only thing that will do.

407
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:52,648
Felt.

408
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:57,653
Buttons.

409
00:23:57,784 --> 00:23:59,786
You really do things
differently in San Savarre.

410
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,875
Just pass me the buttons, Nurse,

411
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:04,355
and I'll have the patient
recovering in no time.

412
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:06,662
Buttons.
You're the boss.

413
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:14,409
Is Peanut all better?

414
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,368
Yes ma'am. All better.

415
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:19,153
Thank you Dr. Tasha.

416
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:20,981
Hey, Verity. What about me?

417
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:23,505
What about you, Jeff?
She's the boss.

418
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,552
-That's true.
-No respect.

419
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:29,119
No respect, I tell ya.

420
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,557
She's actually having
a really tough time.

421
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,863
That's the closest to a smile
I've seen since she got here.

422
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:37,084
Really? What seems
to be the problem?

423
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:39,739
She just isn't responding
to treatment how we'd like.

424
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:42,437
I mean, the treatments
themselves are working fine,

425
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:44,091
but she's just so down.

426
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:45,484
Hmm.

427
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:47,747
Mind if I look at her chart?

428
00:24:47,877 --> 00:24:49,313
Yeah. Go ahead.
It's right there.

429
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:58,453
The treatment seems right.

430
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,890
She's in room 104?

431
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:02,762
Yeah, why?

432
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:04,677
That room doesn't get
very much natural light.

433
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,548
Try supplementing a
sun lamp in there.

434
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:08,507
I bet she perks up a little.

435
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:11,422
Anyone ever tell you
you're pretty clever?

436
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:16,602
We sure miss having
you around here.

437
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:20,127
I miss practicing here.
I miss practicing there.

438
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:23,260
I miss making a difference
on a daily basis, actually.

439
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:25,219
You're still working
part-time in San Savarre,

440
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:26,350
and that's just for now.

441
00:25:28,918 --> 00:25:30,441
How do you know?

442
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,619
Cuz you're the best.

443
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:36,883
The world needs more
doctors like you.

444
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:38,624
You always know
exactly what to say.

445
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:40,669
Hey, speaking of...

446
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:42,628
When are you
going to propose?

447
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:46,153
Oh! I have to read
the tea leaves first!

448
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:54,248
You know, I think a sticker
might look quite good here.

449
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,424
Yes! Wow!

450
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:58,078
What do we think?
We like this, right?

451
00:25:58,165 --> 00:26:00,646
You know I think a sticker
might also look good...

452
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:03,039
Here.

453
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,301
[Kids laugh]

454
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:05,999
I think I might also need one...

455
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,217
Right here.

456
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:08,741
Perfect.

457
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:09,829
-What about this giant one?
-Yeah.

458
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:10,873
Like an earring.

459
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,572
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

460
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:15,008
Now, how about more on the card.

461
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:16,531
I think we need to decorate
this guy a little bit more.

462
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,011
-Okay.
-Yeah?

463
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:19,752
I'm sure the Queen is
going to love chocolate.

464
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:21,101
She's going to love it.
Here we go.

465
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:22,102
Oh wow.

466
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:32,416
Ah. Ring a ding ding.

467
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:33,722
Jeff?

468
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,506
[ring clatters down drain]

469
00:26:36,203 --> 00:26:37,596
We have to go.

470
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:40,033
Oh okay?
Where are we going?

471
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,297
No, the "Royal we".
I mean that literally.

472
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:45,255
What? Already?

473
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:47,518
Right after the ribbon-cutting.

474
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:49,608
I'm doing security
for three now,

475
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:53,002
so the King is motivated to have
everyone home safe and sound.

476
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:57,006
But you can't, uh, you
can't leave just, just yet!

477
00:26:57,093 --> 00:26:59,748
I don't want to.

478
00:26:59,922 --> 00:27:03,404
We'll spend more time
together soon, okay.

479
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:07,669
Look, I know this whole long
distance thing is hard.

480
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:11,020
But I promise you,
it will be worth it.

481
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:13,327
It already is.

482
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,808
[alarm beeping]

483
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:16,722
Oh!

484
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:22,336
Ah, yes. I just need to
let everything sink in.

485
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:23,642
Okay.

486
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:34,653
It's truly an honor
to be present

487
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,698
for the opening
of the new wing.

488
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:39,309
At the place where
I first interned,

489
00:27:39,396 --> 00:27:42,051
the place where I became an
attending pediatrician,

490
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:44,097
and the place where I
reunited with the charming man

491
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:46,926
who is now my husband.

492
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:49,493
The staff here are
like family to me.

493
00:27:49,624 --> 00:27:51,539
Well, I should hope so!

494
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,368
I'm her brother.

495
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:57,327
All this to say, is I'm very
proud of where I come from.

496
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,068
It's made me who I am.

497
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,809
And I hope that this new
wing will help the children

498
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:02,855
who need it the most.

499
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:06,206
Thank you.

500
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:14,518
All right Your Royal Highnesses,

501
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:16,869
if you'd like to say your good
byes and we'll get on the road.

502
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:20,133
It'll be all right.

503
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:23,223
Yeah.

504
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:26,443
I'll have to meet my
little niece or nephew.

505
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:27,836
That's true.

506
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,751
And there's a little
unfinished business

507
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:30,839
that I still need
to attend to.

508
00:28:31,057 --> 00:28:32,449
Right.

509
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:33,407
All right brother.

510
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:34,713
Good luck.

511
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:41,284
Hi.

512
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:43,939
Will you give this to
the Princess, please?

513
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:46,115
It would be my honor.
Thank you.

514
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:52,731
Next time.

515
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:54,645
I'll see you soon.

516
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,605
See you soon.

517
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,302
[Blevins]
Time is not on our side!

518
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:02,741
We must get going at once!
Come along Bella.

519
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:06,701
Come along! Chop chop! Come on.

520
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,661
[Dr. Gonzales] Let's go
everybody! Party's over.

521
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:16,058
Sorry!

522
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:17,625
It's all right.

523
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,714
I'll see them again
before too long.

524
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:22,151
No, sorry, can you move please?

525
00:29:22,238 --> 00:29:23,631
Oh, sorry.

526
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:25,676
[Mel] Someone's got
to clean this up!

527
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,417
I'm getting back
to work, Doctor G.

528
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:29,289
Yeah, you better be.
[clears her throat]

529
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:34,947
So. Did you pop the question?

530
00:29:35,077 --> 00:29:38,341
Because I didn't see
a ring on her finger.

531
00:29:38,472 --> 00:29:42,519
No, unfortunately the plans

you get to help people.

But being a Princess
is also cool because

ways, like charities and stuff.

According to our ambassador, all
we have to do is convince our

temporarily declare Tasha's room

Of course.

815

We would absolute need
your approval first.

I'm not so sure you're
going to get it.

817

Dr. Gonzales, why ever not?

818
00:44:02,944 --> 00:44:04,424
Well because our ward
has it's own set of

819
00:44:04,598 --> 00:44:07,819
protocols and standards
that need to be upheld.

820
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:09,951
Not to mention there would be a
whole river of red tape to make

821
00:44:10,038 --> 00:44:11,474
something like this happen.

822
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:13,694
And I am but only one chief.

823
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:20,701
Would monetary remuneration
be an incentive?

What are we talking about here?

825
00:44:22,964 --> 00:44:25,314
Well, if the hospital is
willing to cooperate,

826
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:28,404
Tasha's room will qualify for
the very generous funding

827
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:30,972
of the San Savarran
health system budget.

828
00:44:31,146 --> 00:44:34,062
Money can't solve all
problems, Your Highness.

829
00:44:34,193 --> 00:44:37,675
But it can provide a worthy
hospital with much needed

830
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:39,589
and brand new
medical equipment.

831
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:44,203
Doctor, I'm not
trying to bribe you.

832
00:44:44,377 --> 00:44:47,119
But you'll need increased
staff to help move patients,

833
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:48,773
extra security to help
deal with the media,

834
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:50,949
that sort of thing.

835
00:44:51,036 --> 00:44:52,124
We would more than
compensate the hospital

836
00:44:52,298 --> 00:44:53,778
for the inconvenience.

837
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:07,879
Would this about cover it?

838
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:17,932
Welcome home, Prince Alexander!

839
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:23,982
What percentage of the hospital

840
00:45:24,112 --> 00:45:26,462
does San Savarre
intend to assume?

841
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:28,987
The Princess' room is

842
00:45:29,074 --> 00:45:31,598
four hundred and thirty-two
square feet.

843
00:45:31,816 --> 00:45:34,079
We would require no
more and no less.

844
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:36,298
Is the attached restroom
included in that square footage?

845
00:45:36,429 --> 00:45:37,952
Indeed, Ambassador McDavid.

846
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:39,867
And is that
absolutely necessary?

847
00:45:39,998 --> 00:45:42,043
I should say so,
Ambassador McDavid.

848
00:45:42,174 --> 00:45:44,654
Huh! Very well.

849
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,961
Next order of business.

850
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:49,834
How will the San Savarran health
system budget contribute to the

851
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:52,053
betterment of the
hospital room in question?

852
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,840
Well we have here is a
detailed and itemized list

853
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:59,452
including all the
innovations and improvements.

854
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:02,107
For not just the Princess's room
but to all the maternity suites.

855
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:04,413
The total's at the bottom there.

856
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,460
This is in San Savarran
dollars, I presume?

857
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:10,158
US dollars.

858
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:14,902
Well, I'm surprised to admit it,

859
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:16,904
but your requests are
completely reasonable,

860
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:18,993
and your contributions
are more than generous.

861
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,387
I believe we can
come to an agreement.

862
00:46:21,517 --> 00:46:22,780
Very good.

863
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:25,521
On behalf of San Savarre,

864
00:46:25,608 --> 00:46:29,134
to mark this momentous,
historic occasion,

865
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:32,615
I should like to bestow an
annual gift upon your country.

866
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,532
A small thank you, if you will,
for the generous hospitality

867
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:38,143
which you are showing
the Prince and Princess.

868
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:39,666
Completely unnecessary, Blevins.

869
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,016
I must insist.

870
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:45,803
5,000 San Savarre fir trees
will be shipped every year

871
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:48,893
on this precise date and planted
near your nation's capital.

872
00:46:49,023 --> 00:46:50,851
Hmmm.

873
00:46:50,938 --> 00:46:53,506
Playing hardball I see.
Very well.

874
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:57,510
In that case, 5,000 waffles,
baked in accordance with the

875
00:46:57,597 --> 00:47:00,121
secret San Savarran recipe, will
be delivered to you every year

876
00:47:00,252 --> 00:47:01,514
for Waffle Day.

877
00:47:01,601 --> 00:47:03,298
Waffle Day?

878
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:05,648
You don't celebrate Waffle
Day in North America?

879
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,737
It's not a major holiday.

880
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:09,261
I fear they would spoil

881
00:47:09,348 --> 00:47:11,524
before we were able to
distribute them, anyhow.

882
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:15,093
You're firm but fair, Ambassador
McDavid. Firm but fair.

883
00:47:15,267 --> 00:47:16,572
Very well.

884
00:47:16,703 --> 00:47:18,226
My final offer then is inspired

885
00:47:18,357 --> 00:47:20,663
by the Princess's passion
project in our homeland.

886
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:25,146
We shall deliver to you 5,000
baby boxes on this occasion.

887
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,845
Starter kits with
everything a newborn needs.

888
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:33,241
Diapers, clothing, sleeping
bundles, outdoor wear, etc. etc.

889
00:47:33,415 --> 00:47:36,027
The one where the shipping box
turns into the baby's first bed?

890
00:47:36,114 --> 00:47:37,332
Of course.

891
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:39,291
In fact there is a small
mattress inside every box.

892
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:40,988
Just the thing to
give little ones

893
00:47:41,075 --> 00:47:43,077
the right start in life.

894
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:44,557
We could help a
lot of new parents.

895
00:47:44,644 --> 00:47:45,819
Is that a 'yes'?

896
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,125
Throw in some toys
and it will be.

897
00:47:47,255 --> 00:47:49,867
Toys are included,
in the 'etc. etc.'

898
00:47:49,997 --> 00:47:52,565
We will also require
a gift certificate.

899
00:47:52,695 --> 00:47:54,654
Hmmm...

900
00:47:54,784 --> 00:47:57,744
Your countrymen are rather fond
of Burger Cave, are they not?

901
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,920
Not that kind of certificate.

902
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:02,227
Should we require
your assistance,

903
00:48:02,401 --> 00:48:05,534
we can call upon
you at any time.

904
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:07,972
A perfectly elegant solution.

905
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,159
You were right from
the beginning.

906
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,552
I shouldn't have never
come on this trip.

907
00:48:23,726 --> 00:48:27,295
Everything has gone wrong!

908
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:32,126
I just, I wanted to
make San Savarre proud.

909
00:48:32,257 --> 00:48:35,608
I wanted to make you proud.

910
00:48:35,695 --> 00:48:39,655
I have never been more proud
to be your husband, Tasha.

911
00:48:39,742 --> 00:48:42,223
I know things haven't
gone quite as planned,

912
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,312
but we're making it work.

913
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:46,706
Are we?

914
00:48:46,836 --> 00:48:51,015
Our child won't be heir to the
throne, and it's all my fault.

915
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:56,194
Papers, please.

916
00:48:56,324 --> 00:48:59,545
What's going on, Alexander?

917
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:02,417
We may not be able to take
you to San Savarre...

918
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:08,075
But we can bring
San Savarre to you.

919
00:49:11,513 --> 00:49:14,168
Welcome home.

920
00:49:17,084 --> 00:49:19,521
I don't understand.

921
00:49:19,695 --> 00:49:21,741
The government of
the United States,

922
00:49:21,828 --> 00:49:24,396
along with the hospital board
of this revered institution,

923
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,876
represented here by Dr.
Gonzales, has reached

924
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:30,619
a diplomatic arrangement with
the Principality of San Savarre.

925
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,839
I'm hereby delighted to announce
that as long as you are in this

926
00:49:33,057 --> 00:49:35,929
room, you are on
San Savarran soil.

927
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,800
So, our baby...

928
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:39,933
Will be heir to the throne.

929
00:49:41,674 --> 00:49:42,892
Oh!

930
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:44,546
Pretty clever, huh?

931
00:49:44,677 --> 00:49:45,939
No.

932
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:48,072
My water just broke!

933
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:53,251
It's happening.

934
00:49:55,818 --> 00:49:57,429
It's really happening!

935
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,003
[Dr. Gonzales]
Prince Alexander?

936
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:08,657
Prince Alexander?

937
00:50:08,788 --> 00:50:10,137
Alec!

938
00:50:11,138 --> 00:50:13,184
There you go.

939
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:15,838
No no no!
Don't try to get up.

940
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,101
Have a sip of this first.

941
00:50:20,843 --> 00:50:23,107
There we go. How's that?

942
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:26,023
Thank you. I apologize.

943
00:50:26,153 --> 00:50:28,068
I think I got a bit overwhelmed.

944
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:32,333
That's normal. Come on.
Let's get you up.

945
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:48,306
[baby cries]

946
00:50:48,436 --> 00:50:49,698
It's a girl!

947

[baby cries]

948
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,224
Uncle Jeff has a niece!

949
00:50:54,355 --> 00:50:55,661
Ho ho ho. Not so fast.
Not so fast.

950
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:56,792
We're not done yet.

951
00:50:56,966 --> 00:50:58,533
[baby cries]

952
00:50:58,664 --> 00:51:00,666
And a boy?

953
00:51:00,796 --> 00:51:02,146
Tw -- Twins!

954
00:51:02,276 --> 00:51:03,930
Twins!

955
00:51:08,848 --> 00:51:11,764
[babies crying]

956
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:13,505
Well done.

957
00:51:13,592 --> 00:51:14,593
[babies crying]

958
00:51:15,855 --> 00:51:20,164
[babies cooing]

959
00:51:45,363 --> 00:51:48,279
Ah! You're awake, Your
Royal Highnesses.

960
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:50,933
It is indeed a day to celebrate.

961
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:54,676
Your first born child was a boy.

962
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,113
And the natural
heir to the throne.

963
00:51:56,243 --> 00:51:58,724
The King will be pleased!

964
00:51:58,811 --> 00:52:00,726
Back that up, Blevins.

965
00:52:00,856 --> 00:52:04,295
Tasha's first born was a girl.
I was there. Don't test me.

966
00:52:04,382 --> 00:52:06,645
Oh, never mind that. He's the
next male heir to the throne.

967
00:52:06,732 --> 00:52:08,429
And the heir has
always been a male.

968
00:52:08,603 --> 00:52:10,431
That doesn't really seem fair.

969
00:52:10,518 --> 00:52:12,868
Our daughter was born first.

970
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:15,219
Oh, it's not about fairness,
Your Royal Highness,

971
00:52:15,393 --> 00:52:17,438
it's about tradition.

972
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:19,136
The King would like to
speak to both of you

973
00:52:19,223 --> 00:52:20,311
as soon as it
is convenient.

974
00:52:20,615 --> 00:52:22,095
We'll schedule something
later with him today.

975
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:23,575
He's available now.

976
00:52:26,317 --> 00:52:28,493
Ah, congratulations, my boy!

977
00:52:28,623 --> 00:52:31,148
Well, you're not a
boy anymore, are you?

978
00:52:31,278 --> 00:52:32,975
You have a boy of your own.

979
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:34,847
And an heir to the throne!

980
00:52:34,934 --> 00:52:37,241
Our son wasn't the
first born, Father.

981
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,286
No, our daughter was.

982
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:40,722
Shouldn't she be the
heir to the throne?

983
00:52:40,809 --> 00:52:42,768
We can quibble about
the details later.

984
00:52:42,898 --> 00:52:44,683
The important thing
is that you get that

985
00:52:44,857 --> 00:52:47,512
little girl and little boy back
here as soon as you can!

986
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,340
I suppose we can't
keep calling them

987
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,777
"little boy" and "little
girl" much longer.

988
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:53,953
No, I guess you're right.

989
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:56,129
We had it figured out when
we thought it was just one,

990
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,131
but I guess we'll
have to rethink.

991
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:01,003
Well, they'll be named
according to family tradition!

992
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,746
After my great grandparents:
Englebert and Gertrude!

993
00:53:07,662 --> 00:53:10,796
Well, we can quibble
about the details later!

994
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:11,623
[slams tablet shut]

995
00:53:13,886 --> 00:53:16,280
Did you just hang
up on the King?

996
00:53:16,454 --> 00:53:17,977
Again?

997
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:20,893
No, I hung up on our
children's grandfather.

998
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:23,461
[tablet ringing]

999
00:53:23,635 --> 00:53:25,114
Your Majesty?

1000
00:53:25,245 --> 00:53:27,073
I don't know what
happened there.

1001
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,293
Must be going through a tunnel
or a black spot, or something.

1002
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:32,252
Did Mommy just
hand up on Grandpa?

1003
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:34,123
Ah! She did!

1004
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:35,386
[baby cooing]

1005
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:46,397
[light music, chattering]

1006
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:50,618
It's a "Mom-Mo-Sa".

1007
00:53:50,705 --> 00:53:52,054
Pretty good, huh?

1008
00:53:52,446 --> 00:53:55,319
Jeff has been waiting his
entire life to be an uncle.

1009
00:53:55,449 --> 00:53:57,451
Well, he's a natural at it.

1010
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,544
Jeff! You didn't have
to get us a gift!

1011
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:05,111
Oh! Well that's a relief,
because I didn't.

1012
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:07,983
This is way better!

1013
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,898
It's a suggestion box
filled with baby names

1014
00:54:10,029 --> 00:54:10,638
from everyone at
the hospital!

1015
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:11,639
Oh!

1016
00:54:14,903 --> 00:54:18,255
"The men's bathroom
needs nicer hand soap"?

1017
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:21,649
Oh? Oh! I used the suggestion
box from the staff room.

1018
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,172
That was my idea.

1019
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:24,435
I think it's been
really helpful, too.

1020
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:26,437
Right Mel?

1021
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:28,787
There's a suggestion
box in the staff room?

1022
00:54:28,874 --> 00:54:31,529
Yeah, I suggest
you check it out!

1023
00:54:31,616 --> 00:54:33,008
Sorry, I should have
probably emptied it out.

1024

Here, why don't you
keep digging, Tash.

1025
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:35,446

1027
00:54:39,145 --> 00:54:41,756
Yeah. The kids were allowed
to put some in too.

1028
00:54:41,843 --> 00:54:43,323
Ah, yeah.

that one's from.

could have hoped for.

loved the name Grace.

think about that, my love?

Do you think you're a "Grace"?

Well all right
then, Grace it is.

1049

You know...

1050
00:56:07,973 --> 00:56:10,758
I've always thought the name
"Albert" was rather regal.

1051
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,806
What are your thoughts
on that, young Prince?

1053

Well, then it's decided!

Oh no!

-Both of them?
-Uh hm.

00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:36,741
Yeah. They're ganging
up on us already, huh!

Aren't you ready yet?

1063
00:56:40,222 --> 00:56:42,964
We haven't prepped for your
interview with Gabriella Kahn.

00:56:43,138 --> 00:56:46,054
It's your first
engagement of the day.

1065
00:56:46,185 --> 00:56:49,101
I'm so sorry, Blevins.
I completely forgot.

1066
00:56:49,231 --> 00:56:51,582
I'm a little exhausted.

1067
00:56:51,712 --> 00:56:54,541
We'll prepare first,
then we'll tuck you in.

1068
00:56:54,672 --> 00:56:56,195
Now tomorrow morning,
first thing,

1069
00:56:56,325 --> 00:56:58,719
we do the exclusive with
Gabriella Khan about the twins,

1070
00:56:58,850 --> 00:56:59,851
and then...

1071
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:01,766
We travel home.

1072
00:57:01,853 --> 00:57:04,377
San Savarre can't wait to
meet it's two newest Royals.

1073
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:06,510
Duty calls!

1074
00:57:06,684 --> 00:57:08,860
Yeah, well... Ugh...

1075
00:57:09,034 --> 00:57:10,731
Doody also calls.

1076
00:57:12,254 --> 00:57:13,560
So, I'll go get ready.

1077
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:15,954
And you take Albert?
Thanks Blevins!

1078
00:57:16,781 --> 00:57:18,217
Albert?

1079
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:26,094
So. You have a name, do you?

1080
00:57:26,225 --> 00:57:27,879
Come over here, Blevins.

1081
00:57:28,053 --> 00:57:30,447
Grace and I will show
you how it's done.

1082
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,019
It's very dandy Warhol,
isn't it?

1083
00:57:40,021 --> 00:57:41,675
[show opening music]
[audience applause]

1084
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:46,245
Here you are,

1085
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:49,640
at the end of your unexpectedly
extended North American tour.

1086
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:52,425
I would say it's been
a raging success.

1087
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:53,905
[audience applause]

1088
00:57:54,035 --> 00:57:55,994
How do you feel about
it, Prince Alexander?

1089
00:57:56,081 --> 00:57:58,387
San Savarre couldn't have
asked for a better ambassador

1090
00:57:58,562 --> 00:58:00,564
than my beautiful wife.

1091
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:03,392
We're both very grateful
for the warm welcome.

1092
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,351
Princess Tasha...

1093
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,005
Oh, you can call me Tasha.

1094
00:58:07,135 --> 00:58:09,050
Tasha.

1095
00:58:09,224 --> 00:58:11,662
You have been photographed on
red carpets eating cheeseburgers

1096
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:14,186
and hugging grumpy politicians.

1097
00:58:14,273 --> 00:58:16,580
For anyone else, this would
have been spun into bad press.

1098
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:20,192
What is your secret?

1099
00:58:20,322 --> 00:58:24,196
I don't actually know.

1100
00:58:24,326 --> 00:58:27,286
Honesty, I suppose.

1101
00:58:27,373 --> 00:58:30,332
Alexander and I don't do
anything as a PR stunt.

1102
00:58:30,419 --> 00:58:32,334
We are who we are,

1103
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,380
and we just hope that the
people we meet feel that.

1104
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:36,338
Well they certainly seem to.

1105
00:58:36,425 --> 00:58:39,167
Now, you've had a few 'baby
bumps' along the way,

1106
00:58:39,298 --> 00:58:41,387
but you don't seem any
worse for the wear.

1107
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,389
How are you two managing?

1108
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:44,651
Are you exhausted?

1109
00:58:44,738 --> 00:58:45,609
[both together]
Yes!

1110
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:49,656
Gabriella, I have
never been more tired.

1111
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:52,529
I've also never been happier.

1112
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:55,053
I'm in awe of my wife.

1113
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:58,099
I have a healthy
baby boy and girl.

1114
00:58:58,317 --> 00:59:01,668
I'm living in a dream.

1115
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:04,192
And your father, King
Edward, has just announced

1116
00:59:04,366 --> 00:59:05,977
the date of the christening,

1117
00:59:06,107 --> 00:59:08,675
where your son is going to be
named heir to the throne.

1118
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:12,244
Oh, that hasn't
been decided yet.

1119
00:59:12,331 --> 00:59:16,030
Well, it certainly seems as
if His Majesty thinks it has.

1120
00:59:18,337 --> 00:59:19,556
Did you know about that?

1121
00:59:19,773 --> 00:59:22,036
No. No I didn't

1122
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:23,690
We'll sort it out.

1123
00:59:23,864 --> 00:59:25,431
Well, I just don't
want "His Majesty"

1124
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,520
to sort it out without us.

1125
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:29,783
I'll fix it.

1126
00:59:32,917 --> 00:59:35,659
Well, you heard it here first.

1127
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:38,226
Good night and tune
in again tomorrow.

1128
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,401
[audience applause]

1129
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,534
[babies cooing and gurgling]

1130
00:59:43,928 --> 00:59:46,713
I can't believe
you did this to us!

1131
00:59:46,844 --> 00:59:48,889
He's just a bit of
a traditionalist.

1132
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,499
It comes with being a monarch.

1133
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:51,413
Do you think he's right?

1134
00:59:51,544 --> 00:59:52,980
Shhh!

1135
00:59:56,984 --> 00:59:58,943
[Alexander] I think there's
value in some traditions.

1136
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,509
But I want both of our children

1137
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,207
to be loved, honored
and respected!

1138
01:00:02,337 --> 01:00:03,600
I want that for them too!

1139
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:04,688
Then you need to
stand up for us!

1140
01:00:04,862 --> 01:00:06,080
[Jeff]
Shhh!

1141
01:00:06,211 --> 01:00:07,647
[quietly] Then you need
to stand up for us!

1142
01:00:09,127 --> 01:00:12,043
I would. But you're always
standing up to him first!

1143
01:00:12,173 --> 01:00:13,653
He doesn't listen to me!

1144
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:21,182
I don't think he listens
to me either, Tasha.

1145
01:00:21,313 --> 01:00:23,402
So what do we do?

1146
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:25,752
We talk to him together.

1147
01:00:31,018 --> 01:00:32,150
Come on.

1148
01:00:37,024 --> 01:00:39,244
[Tasha]
I wish we could stay longer.

1149
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:41,681
But, looks like we've
passed our medical checks.

1150
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:44,466
I get it.
It's time to go home.

1151
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:46,251
Listen Jeff.

1152
01:00:46,381 --> 01:00:49,254
Thank you. For everything.

1153
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:51,691
I couldn't have done any
of this without your help.

1154
01:00:51,778 --> 01:00:53,301
Well, yeah.
What else is new?

1155
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:55,477
Oww!

1156
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,784
You got that mom strength.

1157
01:00:57,958 --> 01:01:00,700
It was hard enough saying
goodbye last time.

1158
01:01:00,787 --> 01:01:04,704
Now it's not only my sister and
my best friend and my girlfriend

1159
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:08,708
and the snooty guy, but also my
favorite two little bunnies!

1160
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:11,406
I'm gonna miss you all so much.

1161
01:01:11,537 --> 01:01:12,756
I know.

1162
01:01:12,886 --> 01:01:14,540
We're going to miss you too.

1163
01:01:14,714 --> 01:01:16,107
You better.

1164
01:01:19,501 --> 01:01:20,981
-Take care.
-You too.

1165
01:01:25,899 --> 01:01:28,032
Sorry we didn't get to
spend much time together.

1166
01:01:28,162 --> 01:01:29,729
Me too.

1167
01:01:30,077 --> 01:01:34,081
When I'm back, we can plan a
real trip, start that countdown.

1168
01:01:34,212 --> 01:01:36,475
And we can be on the phone
every night until then.

1169
01:01:36,605 --> 01:01:38,259
Every night.

1170
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:39,913
Every night.

1171
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:48,400
-Bye.
-Bye.

1172
01:01:48,574 --> 01:01:49,967
-Making a break for it!
-Bye.

1173
01:02:12,337 --> 01:02:13,991
Look at you. Hi!

1174
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:19,474
[cooing]

1175
01:02:19,605 --> 01:02:21,259
-He's so tired.
-I know.

1176
01:02:23,174 --> 01:02:26,568
Your Royal Highnesses,
King Edward heard about

1177
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,833
your little outburst on
the Gabriella Kahn show.

1178
01:02:30,007 --> 01:02:33,706
He's requesting a video
call with you both.

1179
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:35,795
Well, you can tell the King
that we'll talk to him

1180
01:02:35,926 --> 01:02:37,318
when we're good and ready!

1181
01:02:39,016 --> 01:02:42,193
Oh! Hello, Your Majesty.

1182
01:02:42,323 --> 01:02:44,238
What was that you
were saying, Tasha?

1183
01:02:44,369 --> 01:02:47,241
Um. Well I, ah...

1184
01:02:47,372 --> 01:02:48,416
We...

1185
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,549
We're concerned that
you're making plans

1186
01:02:50,723 --> 01:02:53,073
ahead of time for the
twins without including us.

1187
01:02:53,247 --> 01:02:54,858
And we don't like that
you've arbitrarily decided

1188
01:02:54,988 --> 01:02:56,729
that our son
will be the heir.

1189
01:02:56,903 --> 01:02:58,122
Of course he's the heir.

1190
01:02:58,252 --> 01:03:00,472
He's the first born
child of the Prince!

1191
01:03:00,602 --> 01:03:02,953
Technically, our daughter
was the first born.

1192
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,085
[King Edward]
The heir is always male.

1193
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:06,608
Why does it have to be our son?

1194
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:08,436
Why not our daughter?

1195
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:11,222
[King Edward] I understand
that some of our ways

1196
01:03:11,396 --> 01:03:14,355
may seem antiquated to
you, a "modern woman",

1197
01:03:14,442 --> 01:03:17,358
but traditions are
there for a reason.

1198
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:19,534
The San Savarran crown
has passed down through

1199
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:22,276
the male line
for centuries.

1200
01:03:22,363 --> 01:03:24,713
Okay, but don't you think
that San Savarre should,

1201
01:03:24,888 --> 01:03:27,673
I don't know, move
along with the times?

1202
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,806
It's just tradition!
It's not the law.

1203
01:03:30,023 --> 01:03:33,157
Yes, well as far as I'm
concerned, tradition is the law,

1204
01:03:33,287 --> 01:03:34,898
and that's all I want
to hear about it!

1205
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:43,123
Did the King just
hang up on you?

1206
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:45,082
Yes.

1207
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:48,520
Yes he did.

1208
01:03:48,694 --> 01:03:52,567
[babies fussing]

1209
01:03:52,654 --> 01:03:55,092
Hey, you're awake.

1210
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:57,529
[babies fussing]

1211
01:03:57,659 --> 01:03:59,096
[Alexander]
Mean old king.

1212
01:04:14,502 --> 01:04:17,027
Are you happy to be going
home to San Savarre?

1213
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:19,464
When's your next royal tour?

1214
01:04:19,594 --> 01:04:22,423
I think I can safely say that
there's no place like home.

1215
01:04:22,554 --> 01:04:25,035
Princess Tasha, what's it
like being mother to twins?

1216
01:04:25,122 --> 01:04:27,559
I think it means double
the diaper changes

1217
01:04:27,689 --> 01:04:29,604
and double the love.

1218
01:04:29,691 --> 01:04:32,172
Can you comment on your
Royal disagreement

1219
01:04:32,259 --> 01:04:35,001
between you and His Majesty?

1220
01:04:35,175 --> 01:04:36,916
We're not at liberty at this
time to talk about that.

1221
01:04:37,047 --> 01:04:39,310
And yet, we will.

1222
01:04:41,138 --> 01:04:42,661
Yes.

1223
01:04:43,096 --> 01:04:45,446
The simple fact of the matter is
that there was a disagreement.

1224
01:04:45,533 --> 01:04:47,187
We're a family.

1225
01:04:47,361 --> 01:04:50,147
Differences of opinion happen.

1226
01:04:50,277 --> 01:04:52,105
It's not juicy
gossip, we're just

1227
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:54,455
overdue for a
heartfelt discussion.

1228
01:04:54,629 --> 01:04:56,936
And I'm very much
looking forward to it.

1229
01:04:57,023 --> 01:04:59,330
Right! Thank you.

1230
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,288
Um, moving on.

1231
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,494
Home at last!

1232
01:05:35,844 --> 01:05:37,281
[Tasha]
Finally.

1233
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:44,853
A little time to ourselves.

1234
01:05:44,984 --> 01:05:46,203
We haven't had much of that

1235
01:05:46,507 --> 01:05:48,901
since Gracie and Albert came
into our lives, have we?

1236
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:52,687
I don't think I've
ever had that.

1237
01:05:52,818 --> 01:05:54,124
Good point.

1238
01:05:54,298 --> 01:05:56,343
Heavy weighs the
crown and all that.

1239
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:59,259
[baby fussing]

1240
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:02,306
Oh, I think she's fussing
because she wants the crown.

1241
01:06:02,393 --> 01:06:05,178
Do you want the crown, Gracie?
Hmm?

1242
01:06:05,352 --> 01:06:07,311
Oh I'm not done
with that fight yet.

1243
01:06:07,398 --> 01:06:09,487
I would expect
nothing less, my love.

1244
01:06:12,925 --> 01:06:14,840
Oh, please, come in!

1245
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,496
Well, no sleeping on the job!
There's much to be done.

1246
01:06:18,626 --> 01:06:22,282
There's documents to sign
and a baptism to plan.

1247
01:06:22,413 --> 01:06:24,197
Chop chop!

1248
01:06:26,852 --> 01:06:28,593
There's no place like home, huh?

1249
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,768
Yeah, welcome back.

1250
01:06:31,726 --> 01:06:33,554
[Blevins] These are
formal thank you's

1251
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:35,382
that require both
of your signatures.

1252
01:06:35,556 --> 01:06:39,430
[baby gurgling]

1253
01:06:39,604 --> 01:06:42,085
Albert wants to help.

1254
01:06:42,172 --> 01:06:43,303
Yes, well, if you could
tell Albert not to help,

1255
01:06:43,477 --> 01:06:45,001
that would
be very helpful.

1256
01:06:45,175 --> 01:06:47,046
It's just a lot harder without
an extra pair of hands.

1257
01:06:47,177 --> 01:06:48,743
Jeff made it so much easier.

1258
01:06:48,874 --> 01:06:50,789
Well, yes.

1259
01:06:50,919 --> 01:06:53,313
But you do have an entire staff
at your disposal, Your Highness,

1260
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,402
ready and willing to assist.

1261
01:06:55,533 --> 01:06:57,100
Thank you, Blevins.

1262
01:06:57,274 --> 01:06:59,189
It's just not the
same as family.

1263
01:07:01,452 --> 01:07:02,888
Oh here.

1264
01:07:13,464 --> 01:07:15,727
Hey Blevins.

1265
01:07:15,814 --> 01:07:19,296
Since Albert is going to be
presented to the country as

1266
01:07:19,513 --> 01:07:21,254
heir, I was wondering if
you'd be willing to share

1267
01:07:21,428 --> 01:07:24,779
how succession in the
Royal Line actually works.

1268
01:07:24,866 --> 01:07:28,566
It's good of you to take an
interest in matters of state.

1269
01:07:28,653 --> 01:07:31,873
Yes. You're blossoming into
your role here very well.

1270
01:07:32,091 --> 01:07:33,962
Ah, well. It's my
duty, isn't it?

1271
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:36,704
It is indeed!

1272
01:07:36,835 --> 01:07:38,793
San Savarre has always
followed the principles of

1273
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:40,882
"primogeniture".

1274
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,711
This means that the monarch's
eldest, and his descendants,

1275
01:07:43,885 --> 01:07:46,105
take precedence in
matters of succession.

1276
01:07:46,192 --> 01:07:49,500
The first born becomes the heir
apparent, and so on so on so on,

1277
01:07:49,587 --> 01:07:50,370
down the line.

1278
01:07:50,675 --> 01:07:52,894
-That's fascinating!
-Yes indeed!

1279
01:07:52,981 --> 01:07:57,421
So fascinating that Grace and
Albert have fallen asleep.

1280
01:07:57,638 --> 01:08:00,902
Yes, I would of thought it was
be of the utmost interest to you

1281
01:08:00,946 --> 01:08:03,644
Your Royal Highness, as
father to the rightful heir.

1282
01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:06,386
Of course it is,
isn't it sweetie?

1283
01:08:06,473 --> 01:08:11,739
Ah, yes. It is fascinating,
in its own way.

1284
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:14,220
Where can I learn more?

1285
01:08:14,394 --> 01:08:17,571
The library holds many
historical documents about

1286
01:08:17,702 --> 01:08:20,792
the little history of our
little hereditary monarchy.

1287
01:08:20,966 --> 01:08:25,884
Heirs apparent, patrilineal
continuity, and, well of course,

1288
01:08:25,971 --> 01:08:27,973
that one time King Leon
the Third passed away

1289
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:29,366
without having
named his successor.

1290
01:08:29,496 --> 01:08:30,584
That caused quite a
headache, I can tell you!

1291
01:08:30,715 --> 01:08:32,369
Well I'm sure!

1292
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:36,634
Well, I must say I had
no idea this would

1293
01:08:36,721 --> 01:08:38,462
hold such interest
for you, Ma'am.

1294
01:08:38,636 --> 01:08:40,681
His Majesty will
be very pleased!

1295
01:08:40,855 --> 01:08:43,554
Now, when you finish
signing all this,

1296
01:08:43,728 --> 01:08:45,251
there are hundreds more
in the antechamber.

1297
01:08:45,338 --> 01:08:47,471
And I'll go and get them.

1298
01:08:47,558 --> 01:08:50,474
And perhaps...
A cheeseburger?

1299
01:08:50,517 --> 01:08:51,518
Oh!

1300
01:08:58,395 --> 01:09:00,048
What's gotten into you?

1301
01:09:00,223 --> 01:09:01,528
Well, a cheeseburger,
soon enough.

1302
01:09:01,615 --> 01:09:03,356
You're scheming.

1303
01:09:03,443 --> 01:09:05,532
You've that scheming
look on your face.

1304
01:09:05,619 --> 01:09:07,839
It's just an idea.

1305
01:09:08,013 --> 01:09:09,536
Hmm.

1306
01:09:22,027 --> 01:09:24,595
[Tasha reading]
Heir male or heir general...

1307
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,014
There you are.

1308
01:09:57,454 --> 01:09:58,716
Ahem!

1309
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:04,069
His Royal Highness requests
your immediate presence for, ah,

1310
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,854
baby bath time.

1311
01:10:06,985 --> 01:10:08,682
Is it bath time already?

1312
01:10:08,856 --> 01:10:10,249
Yes.

1313
01:10:11,903 --> 01:10:13,470
Alexander?

1314
01:10:13,644 --> 01:10:15,515
[Alexander]
We got started without you

1315
01:10:15,602 --> 01:10:17,387
and it got very wet
very quickly in here.

1316
01:10:17,561 --> 01:10:19,476
I recommend you stay
outside and save yourself.

1317
01:10:19,606 --> 01:10:21,086
[Tasha]
Are you sure?

1318
01:10:21,173 --> 01:10:22,087
[Alexander chuckles]
Positive.

1319
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:24,263
Clever girl.

1320
01:10:36,144 --> 01:10:37,842
I found something
in the library.

1321
01:10:37,929 --> 01:10:39,278
It's important.

1322
01:10:39,496 --> 01:10:40,714
[Alexander]
Oh?

1323
01:10:40,845 --> 01:10:41,672
So, technically,

1324
01:10:44,936 --> 01:10:48,331
Meaning that it has a hereditary
line of succession in which

1325
01:10:48,548 --> 01:10:51,421
the heirs male or heirs
general are stipulated.

1326
01:10:51,551 --> 01:10:54,815
[Alexander]
Heirs male or heirs general?

1327
01:10:54,946 --> 01:10:57,688
Meaning the oldest child
succeeds the throne.

1328
01:10:57,818 --> 01:10:59,907
Regardless of gender!

1329
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:02,432
So Gracie could be the heir!

1330
01:11:02,519 --> 01:11:03,346
Exactly.

1331
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,480
Although...

1332
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:10,657
I'm pretty sure someone's
going to need some convincing.

1333
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:13,225
I'm sure these two
could convince him.

1334
01:11:13,356 --> 01:11:15,836
Going to bring out
the big guns, huh?

1335
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:22,756
He's already fast asleep.

1336
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,547
[Bella] The Archbishop will be
presiding over the event

1337
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:32,418
with only immediate
family in attendance.

1338
01:11:32,592 --> 01:11:34,072
No media will be allowed.

1339
01:11:34,202 --> 01:11:35,813
Save for the Royal
photographer.

1340
01:11:35,943 --> 01:11:38,163
We'll release the photos
the day after the baptism

1341
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:39,773
at a scheduled media event,

1342
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,733
so we can circulate the
images of Grace and Albert

1343
01:11:42,863 --> 01:11:46,911
in their gowns while keeping the
actual event a private affair.

1344
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:51,437
Uh, yeah, it sounds like you
have everything under control!

1345
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:54,005
I just really miss you, Jeffy.
I wish that you were here.

1346
01:11:54,092 --> 01:11:55,354
Surprise!

1347
01:11:58,662 --> 01:12:00,098
Hi!

1348
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:01,578
You didn't think I'd miss
the big day, did you?

1349
01:12:01,752 --> 01:12:03,275
You're here!

1350
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:07,453
Now that's more like it.

1351
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:11,283
-I missed you.
-I missed you too.

1352
01:12:11,457 --> 01:12:12,893
[Bella's phone buzzes]

1353
01:12:13,024 --> 01:12:14,373
Duty calls.

1354
01:12:14,504 --> 01:12:16,506
Okay. Take me to your leader!

1355
01:12:16,636 --> 01:12:17,550
The King?

1356
01:12:17,637 --> 01:12:19,247
Oh, right. No, ah, I meant:

1357
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:20,814
Take me to my sister!

1358
01:12:20,945 --> 01:12:22,555
Of course.

1359
01:12:25,297 --> 01:12:26,342
-Come one!
-Okay.

1360
01:12:28,953 --> 01:12:30,302
[babies fussing]

1361
01:12:42,706 --> 01:12:44,403
I can't believe you're here.

1362
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:47,667
Well, I thought you'd need this,

1363
01:12:47,841 --> 01:12:50,191
and it was the fastest
way to get it to you.

1364
01:12:50,322 --> 01:12:53,194
Okay, what hilarious thing are
you going to prank me with?

1365
01:12:53,281 --> 01:12:55,066
No joke.

1366
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,372
Here.

1367
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:05,337
They were yours and mine.

1368
01:13:05,424 --> 01:13:07,774
I found them in the attic.

1369
01:13:07,905 --> 01:13:11,865
Oh Jeff. Thank you.

1370
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:14,955
I'm so glad you're here.

1371
01:13:15,042 --> 01:13:16,914
It's been a little hard
looking after these two

1372
01:13:17,044 --> 01:13:18,219
without your help.

1373
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,091
Aw, you're a natural, Tash.

1374
01:13:20,178 --> 01:13:21,440
I see the same
spark in you now

1375
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:24,138
as when you're
treating patients.

1376
01:13:24,269 --> 01:13:26,402
Do you think it's bad to
admit that I'm kind of sad

1377
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:28,969
to have left that part
of my life behind?

1378
01:13:29,753 --> 01:13:32,016
But, do you really have to?

1379
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:34,148
I mean, what about opening
a children's hospital

1380
01:13:34,366 --> 01:13:35,976
here in San Savarre?

1381
01:13:36,107 --> 01:13:37,021
Well, you know how it is.

1382
01:13:41,112 --> 01:13:44,202
the schedule of a working
doctor a little difficult.

1383
01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:45,812
Maybe you can take a
more passive approach

1384
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:47,118
until you're ready.

1385
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:48,728
Like what?

1386
01:13:48,902 --> 01:13:50,817
Well you open the hospital,

1387
01:13:50,948 --> 01:13:53,516
and then until you're
ready to run it yourself,

1388
01:13:53,646 --> 01:13:56,127
you just fill it with
people you trust and love.

1389
01:13:56,301 --> 01:13:58,346
Yeah, like you?

1390
01:13:59,304 --> 01:14:02,046
Oh!

1391
01:14:02,089 --> 01:14:05,310
Yeah! Yeah, like me.

1392
01:14:05,528 --> 01:14:07,965
Wait, really?

1393
01:14:08,139 --> 01:14:10,750
Are you saying you'd be willing
to stay here in San Savarre?

1394
01:14:10,924 --> 01:14:12,448
Move your entire life here?

1395
01:14:12,665 --> 01:14:17,191
Well, I mean, with Bella and
you and Alec and the babies,

1396
01:14:17,322 --> 01:14:20,194
I mean, my entire life
is kinda here already.

1397
01:14:20,412 --> 01:14:23,023
The promise of a job, it'd
be hard to keep me away!

1398
01:14:28,072 --> 01:14:29,029
It could be fun.

1399
01:14:29,203 --> 01:14:30,596
Could be!

1400
01:14:30,683 --> 01:14:32,903
The Jeff Memorial Hospital.

1401
01:14:33,077 --> 01:14:34,470
Okay, no no no no.

1402
01:14:35,558 --> 01:14:39,344
Oh! Gorgeous, isn't it?

1403
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,303
It's traditional
and it's appropriate.

1404
01:14:46,133 --> 01:14:47,700
Oh!

1405
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:50,921
Change of plans.

1406
01:14:51,051 --> 01:14:54,011
I absolutely adore them!

1407
01:14:54,098 --> 01:14:55,708
Perfection.

1408
01:14:56,753 --> 01:14:59,712

to you before the baptism.

[King Edward]
Oh!

1417
01:15:39,926 --> 01:15:41,885
I haven't been this excited
since, oh I don't know,

1418

I suppose!

[Tasha]
Jeff brought the outfits.

1422
01:15:55,725 --> 01:15:58,162
They were ours when
we were christened.

What do you think?

1424
01:15:59,903 --> 01:16:01,948
[King Edward]
Absolutely charming!

1425
01:16:02,122 --> 01:16:04,560
It's a wonderful new
tradition, Tasha.

1426
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:08,128
Many thanks to your brother
for his inspired contribution.

1427
01:16:08,259 --> 01:16:09,260
Thank you, Father.

1428
01:16:13,351 --> 01:16:16,659
[King Edward } Ah yes, Tasha,
I thought as much.

1429
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,356
So I've been doing
my research...

1430
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:21,315
Oh I am well aware.

1431
01:16:21,446 --> 01:16:26,494
Blevins has informed me of your
little digging expedition.

1432
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,714
And he has shared with me

1433
01:16:28,845 --> 01:16:31,369
some of the relevant
history, actually.

1434
01:16:31,456 --> 01:16:33,893
Tasha...

1435
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:37,680
You weren't exactly the
'traditional' choice of bride

1436
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:41,684
for my son, and no one
could consider your

1437
01:16:41,858 --> 01:16:45,296
'cheeseburger diplomacy'
exactly traditional.

1438
01:16:45,383 --> 01:16:49,039
But every step of the way you
have taught me that, well,

1439
01:16:49,126 --> 01:16:52,172
that traditions are
what we make of them.

1440
01:16:52,303 --> 01:16:55,262
It takes bravery to step
away from the old path

1441
01:16:55,436 --> 01:16:58,570
and forge a new one,

1442
01:16:58,657 --> 01:17:02,879
and thanks to you, well,
I'm beginning to understand

1443
01:17:03,009 --> 01:17:05,925
the value in both
the old and the new.

1444
01:17:06,056 --> 01:17:07,361
Thank you.

1445
01:17:07,492 --> 01:17:09,102
[King Edward]
However.

1446
01:17:09,276 --> 01:17:12,976
There are certain traditions
that must be honored

1447
01:17:13,106 --> 01:17:15,413
no matter how 'old-fashioned'
they might appear.

1448
01:17:15,587 --> 01:17:18,503
Which brings me to the
future of San Savarre,

1449
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:20,679
and the naming of
its eventual heir.

1450
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:21,898
But, Father...

1451
01:17:22,028 --> 01:17:25,031
Don't you "but Father," me,
my boy.

1452
01:17:25,205 --> 01:17:28,078
[King Edward }
The fact is...

1453
01:17:28,165 --> 01:17:31,211
Tasha was correct.

1454
01:17:31,298 --> 01:17:34,214
The "Hereditary Line of
Succession" book does not

1455
01:17:34,301 --> 01:17:39,219
strictly stipulate that the heir
to the throne has to be male.

1456
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:43,136
Blevins here was good enough
to point that out to me.

1457
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:46,052
[King Edward] And if the
founders of our great land

1458
01:17:46,183 --> 01:17:49,665
decided it was unnecessary
to so stipulate, then...

1459
01:17:49,795 --> 01:17:52,406
Who am I to do so?

1460
01:17:52,537 --> 01:17:53,712
So, you're saying that...

1461
01:17:53,843 --> 01:17:57,542
Today we will
christen and present

1462
01:17:57,716 --> 01:18:03,722
the very first female heir and
eventual successor to the throne

1463
01:18:03,809 --> 01:18:08,335
the future Queen
Grace of San Savarre.

1464
01:18:08,466 --> 01:18:10,381
Thank you, Father.
Thank you.

1465
01:18:10,511 --> 01:18:13,253
Um, I'd actually

1466
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:15,299
like to ask your permission
for one more thing.

1467
01:18:15,429 --> 01:18:18,171
Well, you've got me in a
very good mood right now,

1468
01:18:18,258 --> 01:18:21,566
so you might as well
proceed while you're ahead.

1469
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,350
Well...

1470
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,397
I'd like to open up a children's
hospital here in San Savarre.

1471
01:18:26,484 --> 01:18:29,574
And I recognize that my plate is
very full with Albert and Grace,

1472
01:18:29,748 --> 01:18:31,097
along with my Royal duties.

1473
01:18:31,271 --> 01:18:32,620
Yeah, I think...

1474
01:18:32,969 --> 01:18:34,579
And I know I can't do it on my
own, and I don't plan to.

1475
01:18:34,753 --> 01:18:36,712
But the fact of the matter is
looking after all children,

1476
01:18:36,842 --> 01:18:39,671
not just my own, is
more than a job to me.

1477
01:18:39,845 --> 01:18:42,718
It's, it's my entire life.

1478
01:18:42,848 --> 01:18:44,284
Yes, Tasha I think that...

1479
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,460
A very young, wise patient,
Verity, once reminded me

1480
01:18:46,591 --> 01:18:49,202
the benefits of being both
a Princess and a doctor.

1481
01:18:49,246 --> 01:18:51,074
And I'd like to be like Verity.

1482
01:18:51,204 --> 01:18:54,120
I'd like to be both,
but on my own terms.

1483
01:18:54,251 --> 01:18:56,949
And that's it.

1484
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:00,344
Now you can tell me why
that's such a terrible idea.

1485
01:19:00,474 --> 01:19:03,564
Tasha, if you'll just let
me get a word in edgewise,

1486
01:19:03,651 --> 01:19:05,958
I was going to
say that I think

1487
01:19:06,045 --> 01:19:09,179
it's an absolutely
wonderful idea.

1488
01:19:09,309 --> 01:19:10,267
Thank you.

1489
01:19:10,354 --> 01:19:11,703
Wait. What?

1490
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:13,096
Well, it's not
going to be easy,

1491
01:19:13,313 --> 01:19:16,229
but then wonderful
things seldom are.

1492
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,188
But it's a terrific
goal to work towards.

to allow the babies
