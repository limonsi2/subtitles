00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,232
<i>Diving is the most fabulous distraction</i>

4
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,442
<i>you can experience.</i>

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,154
<i>I am miserable out of the water.</i>

6
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,117
<i>It is as though
you have been introduced to heaven,</i>

7
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,203
<i>and then forced back to Earth.</i>

8
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,061
<i>It's a beautiful sight.</i>

9
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:04,731
Okay.

10
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,734
Captain, This is Jennifer.
Jennifer.

11
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,611
Um, what's it like down there?

12
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,991
Okay.

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,868
It's fantastic.

14
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,914
Imagine having no weight.

15
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,334
Imagine that this would be underwater.

16
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,171
You would just inhale your lungs
and you would float around.

17
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:34,052
You would move like this swimming in space
above all your little friends.

18
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,471
It's beautiful.

19
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,139
Captain,

20
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,682
we have a question here.

21
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,750
<i>I am fascinated by the element, water.</i>

22
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,843
<i>The world we live in on Earth,
it is a struggle against gravity.</i>

23
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,848
<i>But, by diving, when you put
an Aqualung on your back,</i>

24
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,725
<i>you suddenly are turned
into an archangel.</i>

25
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,230
<i>In harmony with the one single thread</i>

26
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,358
<i>around which all forms of life
have been created.</i>

27
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,612
<i>It's liberation.</i>

28
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,082
<i>You describe yourself
as a witness to change.</i>

29
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,253
<i>When in fact did you first
become aware of the way</i>

30
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,547
<i>that the planet we're on
was changing?</i>

31
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,802
<i>Well, when my friends and I started,</i>

32
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,764
<i>it was for us, for ourselves.
The pleasure of discovering.</i>

33
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,100
Look sharp, they're diving!

34
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,812
Stand by with the buoy!
Falco and Piel, get ready!

35
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,318
<i>I thought that my job
was to show what was in the sea,</i>

36
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,236
<i>the beauties of it...</i>

37
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:20,408
<i>so that people would get to know
and love the sea.</i>

38
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,747
<i>Then we began to see that the things
that we had admired</i>

39
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,999
<i>were beginning to decay.</i>

40
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,002
<i>And we said, "We have to do something."</i>

41
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,172
<i>"We have to enter the fight."</i>

42
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:41,012
<i>Because you will only protect
what you love.</i>

43
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,817
Good evening.

44
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,404
I have no doubt that you'll recognize
the face on the screen behind me.

45
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,865
It's that
of Captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau.

46
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,326
<i>For the past 25 years,
Captain Cousteau's</i>

47
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,287
<i>books and films and television series</i>

48
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,040
<i>have reached hundreds
of millions of people all over the world,</i>

49
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:12,126
<i>sharing with them
one of the great discoveries of our time,</i>

50
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,630
<i>the mysterious, incomparably
beautiful world under the sea.</i>

51
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,968
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau.

52
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,477
First, Captain Cousteau,
I'd like to ask you

53
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,523
how you account for this lifelong
preoccupation with the sea?

54
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,150
When I was a very small boy,

55
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:41,698
I was fascinated by the fluid element

56
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,284
that was capable of supporting
very heavy ships.

57
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,869
I couldn't understand
very well how it did it.

58
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,539
But you could have learnt
all that in museums,

59
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,751
and by walking about on the surface,
what extra insight did you get by diving?

60
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,714
Uh, you never experience a difference
between reading a book

61
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,258
- and doing it yourself?
- Good point.

62
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,680
If you read a book about love making,
it's not the same.

63
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:20,987
<i>"Every explorer I have met
has been driven by curiosity.</i>

64
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,243
"A single-minded, insatiable,
and even jubilant need to know.

65
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,540
"We must go and see for ourselves."

66
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,217
<i>Since I was a kid,</i>

67
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,347
<i>I had a tremendous desire
to search and go further.</i>

68
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,312
<i>So, at the age of 20,
I entered the Naval Academy.</i>

69
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,649
<i>And I chose, as my specialty,
airplane pilot.</i>

70
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,575
<i>And I was at the pilot school
of the Navy,</i>

71
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,285
<i>when I was driving at night.</i>

72
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,750
<i>But then I had an accident,
a very bad accident.</i>

73
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,421
<i>I had a right arm paralyzed,
12 bones broken,</i>

74
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,423
<i>I... I was in a bad state.</i>

75
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,515
<i>"I was alone at night, bleeding,
on a country road,</i>

76
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,308
<i>"with nobody to come.</i>

77
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,894
<i>"It was 2:00 in the morning.</i>

78
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,604
<i>"I was losing blood.</i>

79
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,275
<i>"Turning to the sky, looking at the stars,
I thought I was going to die.</i>

80
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,780
<i>"But strangely enough, that became for me,</i>

81
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,990
<i>"a wonderful opportunity."</i>

82
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,911
<i>Cousteau was told</i>

83
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:55,706
<i>that he should go,
and see my grandfather Philippe Tailliez,</i>

84
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:01,170
<i>who was one of the very early free divers
in the Navy, and Frederic Dumas,</i>

85
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,300
<i>who was not in the Navy, but he was
a very famous spearfisher at the time.</i>

86
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,140
<i>And Tailliez and Dumas thought that
they could probably help Cousteau</i>

87
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,308
<i>recover, through swimming.</i>

88
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,136
<i>When my grandfather and Cousteau
started freediving,</i>

89
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,847
<i>they had the whole sea to them,</i>

90
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,392
<i>because nobody else
was doing that at the time.</i>

91
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,314
<i>All the fishermen were jealous
about these three guys</i>

92
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,276
<i>that would go straight into the water,
and come out with the biggest fishes.</i>

93
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,757
<i>They were quite famous
on the French Riviera.</i>

94
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:38,179
<i>The local press would call them,
"The three diving Musketeers".</i>

95
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:34,944
<i>Simone wanted
a life as a sailor on the sea.</i>

96
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,448
<i>Her two grandfathers were admirals</i>

97
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,368
<i>and all of her family were sailors.</i>

98
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:48,708
<i>She said, "I don't have blood.
I have saltwater in my veins."</i>

99
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,717
<i>When she married Cousteau,
she made a deal with him.</i>

100
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,346
<i>"I give you two children,
Jean-Michel and Philippe,</i>

101
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,933
<i>"and you give me the sea."</i>

102
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:38,257
<i>Simone started coming with us,
on all my expeditions.</i>

103
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,847
<i>And after two years,
we already knew how to dive very well.</i>

104
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:52,146
<i>But we had an inner urge
to go deeper and further.</i>

105
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,234
<i>It's always the same, necessity.</i>

106
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,072
<i>In order to go deeper,
in order to stay longer,</i>

107
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,284
<i>I became an inventor by necessity.</i>

108
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,560
<i>"I took normal breaths in a slow rhythm,</i>

109
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,897
<i>"bowed my head and swam smoothly
down to 30 feet.</i>

110
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,816
<i>"I felt no increase in water pressure"</i>

111
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,613
<i>"It was a new and promising device,</i>

112
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,116
<i>"the result of years
of struggle and dreams,</i>

113
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,494
<i>diving could be revolutionized."</i>

114
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,559
<i>"We had been years in the sea
as goggle divers.</i>

115
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,521
<i>"Our new key to the hidden world
promised wonders.</i>

116
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,779
<i>"But unfortunately,
our Utopia was doomed to disappear."</i>

117
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,374
<i>Within four short weeks,</i>

118
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,335
<i>French defenses
had been utterly shattered.</i>

119
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,463
<i>And Adolf Hitler
has claimed Paris as his own.</i>

120
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:12,513
<i>After France surrendered,
my wife and I didn't sleep much.</i>

121
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,308
<i>I always had a gun in my pocket,</i>

122
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,103
<i>I was looking outside before I went out.</i>

123
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,692
<i>But during all that time,
we still had the sea.</i>

124
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,410
<i>For my grandfather
and for Cousteau,</i>

125
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,204
<i>diving was an escape from the war.</i>

126
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,209
<i>Because above the sea, nothing made sense.</i>

127
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,097
<i>"I was determined to have a career.</i>

128
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:00,602
<i>"And it was during the war that I realized
that the autonomous diving suit</i>

129
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,479
<i>"could be a serious business.</i>

130
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,525
<i>"There were hundreds of jobs for divers
in the scuttled fleet,</i>

131
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,485
<i>"and in the ships torpedoed at sea.</i>

132
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,491
<i>"So when the war was over,
I told officials at the Navy Ministry</i>

133
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,953
<i>"about this entirely new system
we had developed."</i>

134
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,240
<i>Cousteau got a boat from the French Navy.</i>

135
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,159
<i>And the whole team
was supposed to go diving.</i>

136
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,872
<i>Cousteau was trying to finance
a new boat</i>

137
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:50,129
<i>and he wanted to prove that the Aqualung
could go more than 100 meters deep.</i>

138
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,713
<i>Which had never been done.</i>

139
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,189
<i>It was like electricity
in the air,</i>

140
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:14,903
<i>a mix of excitement and fear,
with all the journalists taking pictures.</i>

141
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,992
<i>Cousteau was going to make
the Aqualung famous.</i>

142
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,580
<i>And they were going to try
to break a record.</i>

143
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,385
LUC BÉ

144
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:50,415
<i>The first person to go down,
Maurice Fargues, died that day.</i>

145
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,020
<i>"Fargues is the first of my team
that I see disappear.</i>

146
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,065
<i>"This drama upsets me for months.</i>

147
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,862
<i>"I start to wonder if what I am
undertaking makes sense.</i>

148
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,324
<i>"If it is not asking
too much of these men</i>

149
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,286
<i>"to risk their lives
for a hypothetical conquest."</i>

150
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,838
<i>After the death of Fargues,
it was no longer the "Three Musketeers".</i>

151
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:44,886
<i>My grandfather just knew
it had to be different for him.</i>

152
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:52,102
<i>He said, "His death must not be in vain.</i>

153
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:57,357
<i>"It is up to us to learn from it,
and the lessons it contains".</i>

154
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,115
<i>My grandfather was also
an early ecologist.</i>

155
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,871
<i>And he was one of the first to realize
how precious the reef is...</i>

156
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,790
<i>and how quickly it can disappear.</i>

157
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:20,172
<i>And he told Cousteau
they have a role to play to protect it.</i>

158
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,801
<i>He said, "We are opening Pandora's Box."</i>

159
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,558
<i>But at the time,
Cousteau had another agenda.</i>

160
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,236
Calypso <i>was basically a minesweeper,</i>

161
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,114
<i>built in 1942 in America.</i>

162
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,534
<i>And I acquired her for very little money,</i>

163
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,287
<i>thanks to a grant given to me
by a British citizen.</i>

164
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,834
<i>And she has gone practically everywhere
around the world with me.</i>

165
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,631
<i>Journal number one.</i>

166
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,554
<i>We are at sea, at long last,</i>

167
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,349
<i>enjoying this first day of navigation
on the</i> Calypso.

168
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:04,354
<i>We have started
with a full-scale expedition</i>

169
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,315
<i>to explore the reefs of the Red Sea.</i>

170
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,938
<i>Journal number two.</i>

171
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,235
<i>Since we left,
bad weather has never stopped.</i>

172
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,239
<i>It is raining, it is cold,</i>

173
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,702
<i>and the swell is at least force six.</i>

174
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,417
<i>We are thrown from one side
to another, 24 hours a day.</i>

175
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:15,050
<i>And I spent a horrible night
fearing for my vessel.</i>

176
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:21,348
<i>So we sailed north again
and found a very good shelter.</i>

177
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,892
<i>A poetic and desolate island.</i>

178
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,281
<i>"I have that feeling
of trespassing when I submerge.</i>

179
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,118
<i>"The feeling that you're cheating.</i>

180
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,745
<i>"We're land animals</i>

181
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,581
<i>"and we're not supposed
to cross the threshold.</i>

182
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,710
<i>"Nature warns us 'Don't go.'</i>

183
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,215
<i>"But we do go,
and the sense of trespass vanishes."</i>

184
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,346
<i>The whole world was being discovered.</i>

185
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,850
<i>And we had no idea
that we were destroying it.</i>

186
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,855
<i>Setting off dynamite to count
the fish at the surface, you know,</i>

187
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,565
<i>to see how many fish lived underneath.</i>

188
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,068
<i>We just didn't know
any better at the time.</i>

189
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,672
<i>This is an underwater hunt</i>

190
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,174
<i>by Captain Cousteau's group
in the Persian Gulf.</i>

191
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,386
<i>These men are searching
not for pink pearls,</i>

192
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,680
<i>but for black gold. Oil.</i>

193
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:45,570
<i>"The only field in which I know
I am gifted is cinema.</i>

194
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,031
<i>"It's a built-in sickness.</i>

195
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,242
<i>"I feel miserable if I don't make a film."</i>

196
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:08,509
<i>When I was about 12,
I saw my first underwater films.</i>

197
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,971
<i>And I found them miraculous.</i>

198
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:18,061
<i>People at that time had no idea
what was going on under the surface.</i>

199
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,397
<i>So that was a revelation for me.</i>

200
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:27,362
<i>That's when I understood
the strength, the power of images.</i>

201
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,954
<i>I started taking movies at the age of 13.</i>

202
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:43,044
<i>I began to make little stories
about the marriage of my cousin.</i>

203
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:49,717
<i>And also, with my brother,
we imagined a gangster story.</i>

204
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,265
<i>During all those years,</i>

205
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,727
<i>everywhere I went,
my notebook was a camera.</i>

206
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,899
<i>And after I invented the Aqualung,</i>

207
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,485
<i>I wanted to show my friends
what I was seeing.</i>

208
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,699
<i>But, to photograph underwater
I had to put a camera in a housing.</i>

209
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,451
<i>So I had to invent that too.</i>

210
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,154
<i>Action!</i>

211
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,532
Action!

212
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,535
<i>"I become furious</i>

213
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,872
<i>"when they label my films
with the word 'documentary.'</i>

214
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,375
<i>"That means a lecture by a guy
who knows more than you."</i>

215
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,296
<i>"Our films are not documentaries.</i>

216
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,924
<i>"They are true adventure films."</i>

217
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,015
Bridge, engine room! Bridge, engine room!

218
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,267
Something has just stalled
the port engine!

219
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,852
<i>We've crashed into a whale.</i>

220
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,272
<i>The cuts are so deep, it cannot survive.</i>

221
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,984
<i>We speed up to put the whale
out of its misery.</i>

222
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:49,290
<i>"I dreamed of being the John Ford
or John Huston of the ocean."</i>

223
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,583
Action!

224
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,004
<i>"To offer beauty
to my fellow human beings."</i>

225
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,432
<i>"A moment of grace,</i>

226
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:34,979
<i>"I slide into the depths,
aware of living in harmony</i>

227
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,898
<i>"with an environment very different
from the world above.</i>

228
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,279
<i>"I swim almost effortlessly,</i>

229
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,614
<i>"like the fish I meet.</i>

230
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,245
<i>"I am an unexpected guest,</i>

<i>"This silence.</i>

233
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,003
<i>"This harmony."</i>

234
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:08,095
<i>In London last night,
a man gave a lecture</i>

235
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:13,017
<i>paving the way to a time when human beings
will live continuously under the sea.</i>

236
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,313
<i>Commander, is this development
of the ocean bed</i>

237
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:20,775
<i>an adventure to you,
or does it have practical applications?</i>

238
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:26,655
I don't think we can name it
an adventure.

239
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:31,160
It is a succession of carefully planned

240
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,620
and prepared steps.

241
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:38,959
<i>We are moving into the sea,
deeper and longer.</i>

242
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,087
<i>In the coming years,
we will establish settlements</i>

243
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,715
<i>where men will live completely
in the water.</i>

244
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:37,137
<i>So this is a bright future for diving.</i>

245
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:41,225
<i>Because it will eliminate
all ties to the surface.</i>

246
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,435
<i>Cousteau said to me many times</i>

247
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:10,230
<i>that an explorer has no right
to be a family man.</i>

248
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,277
<i>He's off following his nose,</i>

249
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,655
<i>to the future and to the universe.</i>

250
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,867
<i>And that's how it needs to be.</i>

251
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,501
<i>The children,
they were not cared for.</i>

252
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,380
<i>They went to boarding school.</i>

253
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:40,719
<i>And Simone, she was more interested
in a life on the sea.</i>

254
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,224
<i>She had only one passion,</i>

255
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,893
Calypso.

256
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,025
<i>What most people don't realize</i>

257
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,486
<i>is that my mother spent more time</i>

258
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:00,531
<i>on the ship than my father, my brother,
and myself together.</i>

259
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,952
<i>She doesn't like to be on film,</i>

260
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,620
<i>and that's why she has avoided it.</i>

261
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,748
<i>She stays away from the cameras.</i>

262
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,257
<i>She's the strong person behind the scenes.</i>

263
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,720
<i>Uh, people confide in her,
and she makes a lot of decisions,</i>

264
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,221
<i>which most people don't even know about.</i>

265
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,181
<i>They don't even know she exists.</i>

266
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,512
<i>Jean-Michel,
what was it like on Calypso</i>

267
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,847
<i>as a young kid?</i>

268
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,977
<i>I cannot compare with anybody else,</i>

269
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,354
<i>since this was a natural thing.</i>

270
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,899
<i>I was invited there for my vacation.</i>

271
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:21,487
<i>And it took many years for me to realize
that this was very unusual.</i>

272
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,414
<i>You have to be prepared
to make all kinds of sacrifices.</i>

273
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:38,921
<i>You have to agree to have
a very sketchy family life.</i>

274
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:43,592
<i>Philippe,</i>

275
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,719
<i>what's the biggest blunder
your father ever made?</i>

276
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,934
That's too hard
to answer, really.

277
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,268
Okay.

278
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:52,035
<i>Philippe was like his father.</i>

279
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:57,124
<i>Always doing dangerous things,
fearing nothing.</i>

280
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,963
<i>Cousteau was like a king with his empire.</i>

281
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,926
<i>And Philippe was the next king.</i>

282
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,140
<i>In the perpetual darkness,</i>

283
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,726
<i>Philippe Cousteau
focuses his underwater camera</i>

284
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,102
<i>on a unique experiment.</i>

285
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:21,398
<i>The oceanauts will try to repair
a production type oil wellhead,</i>

286
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,358
<i>370 feet deep.</i>

287
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,906
<i>The petroleum companies
had given Cousteau a contract</i>

288
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,616
<i>to do scientific research.</i>

289
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:36,038
<i>And he used the money to fund</i> Calypso,
<i>and to continue his explorations.</i>

290
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:44,671
<i>It may have been a wrong turn
in his path to the future.</i>

291
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,884
<i>But the world at that time</i>

292
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,720
<i>didn't understand the danger
to the environment.</i>

293
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:58,977
<i>So, for Cousteau,
that was a means to an end.</i>

294
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,867
<i>Once we had finished
this chapter,</i>

295
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,620
<i>we had done the work of a pioneer.</i>

296
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:22,125
<i>So we turned this over to the industry,
to use it.</i>

297
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:29,174
<i>But we wondered
if we were doing the right thing.</i>

298
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:11,341
<i>They put
the Jacques Cousteau footage on the air,</i>

299
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,968
<i>and it was a big success.</i>

300
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,179
<i>One day I'm sitting in the house
and I tell my wife,</i>

301
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,181
<i>"I bet you that'll be a great series.</i>

302
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,018
<i>"Jacques Cousteau going underwater,
around the world,</i>

303
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,936
<i>"The Seven Seas, was my thought."</i>

304
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,941
<i>So I flew to Monaco
and spoke with Cousteau.</i>

305
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,168
<i>He says, "I just figured the money,
you have to do 12 hours.</i>

306
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,836
<i>"I can't do it in less than 12 hours."</i>

307
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,798
<i>So I go back to New York
to sell the 12 shows.</i>

308
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,885
<i>I go to NBC, they don't even know
who Jacques Cousteau is.</i>

309
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,763
<i>Who is he? "Well, he's the undersea guy
who invented the Aqualung."</i>

310
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,097
<i>"We don't care."</i>

311
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,684
<i>I go to ABC,
who is there but Tom Moore.</i>

312
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,605
<i>He looks at this thing,
this is terrific, but I can't take 12.</i>

313
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:10,067
<i>But he says, "David, you know,
I'm a member of The Explorers Club</i>

314
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:14,362
<i>"and I have not been able to find
an explorer to speak at my goddamn thing.</i>

315
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,365
<i>"Can you get Jacques Cousteau to speak?"</i>

316
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,243
<i>I said, "Well, you know I could ask him."
He said "I tell you what.</i>

317
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,789
<i>"You get Jacques Cousteau to show up,
I'll put the 12 shows on the air."</i>

318
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,917
<i>And the rest is history.</i>

319
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:37,928
Action!

320
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:43,642
<i>I started on the Cousteau series in 1967.</i>

321
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:50,190
<i>And I was given a huge editing room
because there was so much footage.</i>

322
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,820
<i>Sharks, whales,</i>

323
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,532
<i>and things I had never seen before.</i>

324
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:12,295
<i>The shark is said to be
a fearsome brute.</i>

325
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,464
<i>But this is not always true.</i>

326
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,302
<i>Many harmless species exist,</i>

327
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:24,850
<i>sand sharks, spotted dogfish,
nurse, and leopard sharks.</i>

328
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:29,354
<i>But for a diver, a shark bite,
whether accidental or deliberate,</i>

329
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:32,566

330
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,370
Hello, Raymond. Hello, Raymond.

331
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:48,498
What depth are you at?
What depth are you at?

332
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:52,627
<i>I have abandoned
or almost abandoned feature films,</i>

333
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:57,090
<i>the production of feature films
for television, for only one good reason.</i>

334
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,093
<i>Though it is an aesthetic sacrifice,</i>

335
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,140
<i>it is a way to reach,
by the only real mass medium there is,</i>

336
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,934
<i>millions of people rapidly.</i>

337
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,520
Well understood, Raymond,
well understood.

338
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,731
We are all okay.

339
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:16,401
<i>He had that wonderful persona.</i>

340
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:21,156
<i>But the general audience at that time
didn't know who Jacques Cousteau was.</i>

341
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,701
<i>As our assistants logged him,</i>

342
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:29,539
<i>"There's an old man
in a red beanie cap on deck."</i>

343
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:37,505
<i>So, we had a lot of discussions about,
how are we going to present him?</i>

344
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:41,468
<i>Is he a scientist? Researcher?</i>

345
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:45,972
<i>Or is he a philosopher? Or an inventor?</i>

346
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,059
<i>But in his close-ups,</i>

347
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:54,147
<i>he really looked like a man
looking at the future.</i>

348
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:59,152
<i>So we decided, he's the explorer.</i>

349
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,573
<i>Because his motto was,
"il faut aller voir."</i>

350
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:07,619
<i>You know, "We go see it for ourselves."</i>

351
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,336
<i>The</i> New York Times <i>says</i>
The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau

352

362

363
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,985

<i>to have been invited to come here today</i>

377
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:05,987
to talk about the element
to which I have devoted my life.

378
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,365
The sea.

379
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:11,159
The sea that is today,
as everybody knows, in distress.

380
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:17,248
<i>I spent my life sailing
and swimming through the seas.</i>

381
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,961
<i>In 30 years, I have seen coral reefs
turn into wastelands,</i>

382
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,589
<i>rich fishing grounds depleted.</i>

383
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:29,219
<i>And when I was diving recently,
in the Gulf of Lyon,</i>

384
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:33,598
<i>I was disturbed to find
that we have practically destroyed</i>

385
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,351
<i>the original fauna
of the continental shelf.</i>

386
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:44,317
What we are facing
is the destruction of the ocean

387
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,487
by pollution and by other causes.

388
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,746
<i>For the past two centuries,</i>

389
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:00,959
<i>people have been totally unaware
that there was an ecological problem.</i>

390
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,464
<i>It was understood that the sea
was a vast expanse,</i>

391
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:10,301
<i>a body of water so big
that you could throw anything in it</i>

392
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,261
<i>and it would not matter.</i>

393
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,930
<i>So that is what we did.</i>

394
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:21,563
<i>Last year, in America first,
and then in Europe, and Japan,</i>

395
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,982
<i>people began to understand</i>

396
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,735
<i>and there was an environmental
protection movement created.</i>

397
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:31,990
<i>People start pollution,
people can stop it.</i>

398
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:36,578
<i>Along with my son,
and with my friends,</i>

399
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:39,789
<i>we decided to create The Cousteau Society.</i>

400
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,169
<i>Together with thousands
of concerned citizens, like you,</i>

401
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:48,923
<i>we have begun a nonprofit organization
to save not only the sea,</i>

402
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,926
<i>but the precious living systems
of our water planet.</i>

<i>The awareness of the people is growing.</i>

405
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,230
<i>But there is still a lot of work to do.</i>

406
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:11,196
<i>So I am dedicating
all the rest of my film activities</i>

407
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,531
<i>to try to convince people</i>

408
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,743
<i>that they have to do something about this.</i>

409
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:21,206
<i>So, films that are no more
just about beautiful little fish,</i>

410
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,501
<i>but that are dealing
with the fate of mankind.</i>

411
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,437
<i>For example, more than 600 drums</i>

412
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:29,983
<i>containing deadly lead tetraethyl</i>

413
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,403
<i>were onboard a Yugoslav freighter,</i> Cavtat.

414
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:38,533
<i>And the ship was rammed
and sank in the south of Italy,</i>

415
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:41,869
<i>three miles off shore
at a depth of 300 feet.</i>

416
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:48,626
<i>Some of the drums are already opened up,
and they are going to release</i>

417
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,879
<i>this deadly poison
into the Mediterranean Sea.</i>

418
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,634
<i>So it's a difficult problem to solve.</i>

419
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,971
<i>And all governments
are turning their back to it.</i>

420
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:06,102
<i>Judge Maritati orders
the Saipem Company to begin salvage,</i>

421
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:09,772
<i>helped by the</i> Calypso <i>divers,
Albert Falco and Raymond Coll.</i>

422
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:13,484
<i>I, of course, was involved
at various stages of the operation.</i>

423
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,030
<i>And once the ships were there,

425
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,462
<i>Ninety-seven percent of the lead

426
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,508
<i>The rest is lost,
because some of the drums</i>

427
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,177
<i>had already been damaged.</i>

428
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,764
Captain Cousteau,
I know you have thoughts

429
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,975
about the world's resources
being used up.

430
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,353
And you've seen it happening
year after year.

431
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,897
Apparently a lot of people
who should have didn't.

432
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:53,816
Do you have anything
you want to say about that?

433
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:58,154
Well, uh, I was already involved

434
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:01,199
in, how to say, scanning,

435
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:04,994
the possibilities of extracting energy
from the sea.

436
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:09,332
<i>It was a choice that I made
many years ago.</i>

437
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:13,461
<i>But what I was shocked by,</i>

438
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,422
<i>is the speed and the shamelessness,</i>

439
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:21,135
<i>with which the industrial interests
have threw to the waste basket,</i>

440
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,887
<i>all of the environmental measures</i>

441
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:26,057
that had been very laboriously taken.

442
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:33,815
I feel responsible, I feel guilty
as everybody else, as you should

443
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:39,278
that we are drawing blank checks

444
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,280
on future generations.

445
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,157
We don't pay. They are going to pay.

446
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,956
<i>One of the jobs of The Cousteau Society</i>

447
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,542
<i>is that we want the truth
to come to the people.</i>

448
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:57,630
<i>And we are amazed to find out
that we became the fastest growing</i>

449

<i>non-profit organization
in just two years.</i>

450
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,845
Now you're talking about
the Cousteau Society in the United States,

451
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:07,014
and that is, what's its membership
at the moment?

452
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,558
A hundred and sixty thousand.

453
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,936
And it's growing fast,
because we are a young society.

454
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:14,063
What are you aiming for?
What sort of membership?

455
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,273
Several million.

456
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,983
- How many?
- Several million.

457
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:24,532
<i>In Houston, USA,
11,000 people flocked to listen to the man</i>

<i>Involvement Day

<i>that our actions will not further abuse
our life systems.</i>

463
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:52,852
<i>And in the words of Captain Cousteau,
it's going to be up to ordinary citizens.</i>

464
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:55,730
Captain, this is Matt.

465
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,108
Well, I'd like to ask you
how you feel about

466
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:00,818
underwater civilizations in the future?

467
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,571
Ooh.

468
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:08,826
I must admit that I once proposed this,
but I don't think

469
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,996
that we are going to develop
an underwater civilization.

470
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,039
I think, uh...

471
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,293
we should first build
a good civilization on land.

472
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:08,135
In 1954,

473
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:12,014
I shot a feature length film
called <i>The Silent World.</i>

474
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,392
Where in which there was a sequence,

475
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:19,522
where we saw sharks feed dramatically

476
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:22,149
on a damaged baby whale.

477
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:28,531
<i>And, uh, our men got so furious,
that they brought them on board the ship,</i>

478
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:32,743
<i>and they began to hit them
on the head, and to kill them.</i>

479
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:37,206
<i>It was a real slaughter of these sharks,</i>

480
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,667
<i>a kind of age-old revenge of seamen,</i>

481
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,919
you know, that hated sharks
for generations.

482
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:46,299
All right. Now, recently,
I saw that film again

483
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,552
because I was asked to show it again
in Paris.

484
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,847
And you just... I couldn't...
I couldn't agree.

485
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,850
I cannot show it anymore
because we all have changed.

486
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,435
Mentality has changed

487
01:04:57,518 --> 01:05:00,229
and we couldn't handle the shark
in the same way today.

488
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:51,155
<i>I think that we are lucky.</i>

489
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:55,493
<i>We travel a lot
and we see things that the others don't.</i>

490
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:59,830
<i>So it is a duty for us
to share these things with them.</i>

491
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:02,750
And to think a lot about
our responsibility.

492
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:06,420
And we often discuss this,
Philippe and I,

493
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:10,508
and Philippe shares my philosophy
on this 100 percent.

494
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:14,720
It's a great satisfaction
to find the same understanding

495
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,306
with your main collaborator.
You know?

496
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,225
- That's wonderful.
- Well, the basic philosophy I think

497
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,936
is that you cannot really enjoy
what you're doing if you don't share it.

498
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,062
That's right.

499
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:39,972
<i>December five.</i>

500
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:43,559
<i>I commit</i> Calypso
<i>to the perilous Drake Passage</i>

501
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:46,562
<i>that lies between
the extreme tip of South America</i>

502
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,105
<i>and the Antarctic Peninsula.</i>

503
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:54,570
<i>But at the approach of these polar waters,
we feel alien.</i>

504
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:22,723
<i>We dive in fairly muddy water.</i>

505
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:27,478
<i>The red algae gives us a waving,
inviting welcome.</i>

506
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:36,362
<i>Along the cliff,
down to one hundred feet,</i>

507
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:39,406
<i>we discover an unexpected
profusion of life.</i>

508
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,671
<i>I am eager
to take down the diving saucer,</i>

509
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,549
<i>to explore the deeper polar waters.</i>

510
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,267
<i>Falco will pilot the saucer while I film.</i>

511
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:26,453
<i>A little lower,
an opening gapes in the wall.</i>

512
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:35,045
<i>Dull, cracking sounds
are warnings</i>

513
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,965
<i>that the iceberg is under
immeasurable internal stress.</i>

514
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:46,223
<i>It is a giant crystal,
melting under my eyes.</i>

515
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,064
<i>We are witnesses
to the vanishing of an eternity.</i>

516
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:27,264
<i>You know, I must tell you
that I hate danger.</i>

517
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:32,144
<i>I'm not one of these people
who have to have a thrill.</i>

518
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:36,649
But you too, I think we,
we all in the family,

519
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:38,692
we are not daredevils at all.

520
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:39,985
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

521
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,238
Oh, but you're flying planes.

522
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,115
Mm-hmm.
You don't like him...

523
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,117
- I don't know.
- You don't like him to fly planes?

524
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,286
- Well, I'm not so sure.
Hmm.

525
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:13,310
<i>Philippe had this idea
to make a film in North African countries,</i>

526
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:15,020
<i>and I approved it.</i>

527
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:18,399
<i>And he started with his airplane.</i>

528
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:20,484
<i>And...</i>

529
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:23,362
<i>that was it.</i>

530
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,258
<i>Why? How?</i>

531
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,885
<i>Philippe was an excellent pilot.</i>

532
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:51,682
<i>A poorly latched hatch
on the nose of the plane</i>

533
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:56,812
<i>had just annihilated my beloved son
and a part of me with him.</i>

534
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:22,880
Arms, present!

535
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:19,520
<i>We are here in joy.</i>

536
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:25,109
And I share that joy with you,
with tears in my eyes

537
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,447
because of the great absence tonight --
Philippe.

538
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:43,335
<i>After Philippe died,</i>

539
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:47,548
<i>Jacques' entire physical appearance
was absolutely different.</i>

540
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:50,300
<i>He had aged ten years.</i>

541
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:54,012
<i>He was bent over, his skin was sallow.</i>

542
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,144
<i>And, as time went by,</i>

543
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:06,442
<i>he became more pessimistic
about the environment.</i>

544
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:20,247
<i>In 1977, Cousteau
and the</i> Calypso <i>divers returned to Veyron.</i>

545
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:27,880
<i>In only three decades,
the sea floor has become a desert.</i>

546
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,799
<i>Bleak as the surface
of some barren planet.</i>

547
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:39,057
<i>In this submerged desolation,
the water temperature seems to rise,</i>

548
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,560
<i>burning our hands in spite of our gloves.</i>

549
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,938
<i>Our eyes are burning.</i>

550
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:48,942
<i>Tears pour down our faces,
blurring our vision.</i>

551
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:51,403
<i>The pain is unbearable.</i>

552
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:55,157
<i>We have penetrated a zone of death,</i>

553
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:59,369
<i>a region where no living thing
can long survive.</i>

554
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:10,714
<i>ABC dropped him
because he was getting too dark.</i>

555
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:16,887
<i>They didn't want him
browbeating the audiences</i>

556
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:19,223
<i>with these, uh, dismal stories.</i>

557
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:25,312
<i>He was more strident,
trying to convince people</i>

558
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:27,064
<i>rather than just showing them.</i>

559
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:32,402
<i>And I think he became somewhat cynical
at that point in his life.</i>

560
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:39,952
<i>Can you tell me what you think
are your greatest accomplishments</i>

561
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,245
<i>and your greatest phase?</i>

562
01:15:42,162 --> 01:15:45,207
This is... This is impossible to answer

563
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:49,294
because I am not interested
in analyzing myself.

564
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:50,879
Why haven't you?

565
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,757
I am not interested in myself
once and for all.

566
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,385
I am interested in the world outside me.

567
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:59,304
My world inside is nothing for me.

568
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:18,198
<i>I keep thinking of a day
that we spent together.</i>

569
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:22,703
<i>We were working on our book
and he had flown to Paris to meet me.</i>

570
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:27,124
<i>The people on the plane
had formed a line in the aisle</i>

571
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:28,917
<i>while they awaited his autograph.</i>

572
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:33,338
<i>And he said, "I spend every day,
all day long going to meetings,</i>

573
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,800
<i>"doing films, doing research,
and the only thing they want</i>

574
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:39,595
<i>"is a piece of paper
with the name Jacques Cousteau.</i>

575
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:42,180
<i>"And that's what they are
going to enshrine."</i>

576
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:45,642
<i>And he got more and more angry about it.</i>

577
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:36,985
<i>I think the two
of us were needing</i>

578
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:39,780
<i>to have a new life, when we met.</i>

579
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:47,496
<i>But in my mind and in his mind...</i>

580
01:17:47,954 --> 01:17:51,458
<i>it was not linked
with anything romantic.</i>

581
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:56,922
<i>I was 31, and I was a diver.</i>

582
01:17:58,548 --> 01:18:02,344
<i>So at that time,
it was just about diving.</i>

583
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:08,642
<i>We had organized,
what we called at the time,</i>

584
01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:11,228
<i>Involvement Day in Houston.</i>

585
01:18:11,978 --> 01:18:16,400
<i>And I went diving with a club,
and she was there.</i>

586
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:19,361
<i>And I thought she was an interesting girl.</i>

587
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:26,368
<i>At that time,
she had a brilliant career</i>

588
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:32,207
<i>at Air France, in charge of diplomatic
travels for the French government.</i>

589
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:38,922
<i>I think what Jacques
wanted the most probably at that time</i>

590
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:41,758
<i>was to have a place with a family.</i>

591
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:47,264
<i>Not that he didn't have a family before,
but because of the kind of life he had,</i>

592
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:49,391
<i>he was never two minutes
in the same place.</i>

593
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,062
<i>His wife was on the boat.</i>

594
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:57,816
<i>And the kids were in boarding school.</i>

595
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:02,487
<i>And him, he was traveling everywhere,
so there was no family,</i>

596
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,489
<i>what we call "foyer," in French.</i>

597
01:19:04,781 --> 01:19:08,910
<i>It's a place where the family goes
together, regularly.</i>

598
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:10,620
<i>Home.</i>

599
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:13,915
<i>He needed to have that.</i>

600
01:19:19,337 --> 01:19:23,842
<i>We knew a little bit
about his relationship with Francine.</i>

601
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:30,724
<i>And Cousteau, during that time,
he had two children with her.</i>

602
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:34,394
<i>But we never talked about them.</i>

603
01:19:34,978 --> 01:19:36,938
<i>But everyone knew.</i>

604
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,900
<i>And I think Simone knew too.</i>

605
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:05,175
<i>"The last time
we had dinner together,</i>

606
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:07,177
<i>"I knew she was not well.</i>

607
01:20:08,261 --> 01:20:10,472
<i>"But I had no idea
what was wrong with her.</i>

608
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:14,601
<i>"She had made the doctor promise
not to tell me,</i>

609
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:17,229
<i>"so as not to disturb my work".</i>

610
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:10,740
Calypso <i>has given me everything.</i>

611
01:21:11,741 --> 01:21:16,079
<i>No man in the world could ever offer me
what this vessel has.</i>

612
01:21:18,498 --> 01:21:20,500
<i>This boat is my paradise.</i>

613
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:24,671
<i>And it's a wonder to pass my hand
over the hull.</i>

614
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:26,673
<i>To breathe its paint.</i>

615
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:29,551
<i>To feel its vibrations.</i>

616
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:34,306
<i>Its soul, the only reason
for my being alive.</i>

617
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:21,102
<i>Jacques never explained
to anybody our private life.</i>

618
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:26,775
<i>But he was getting worried
that if anything happened to him,</i>

619
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:28,360
<i>we would not be protected.</i>

620
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:31,947
<i>So that was the reason
we were married so early</i>

621
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:34,240
<i>after his first wife died.</i>

622
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:45,961
<i>When Francine married Jacques,</i>

623
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:49,923
<i>I don't think that the French
were shocked or cared.</i>

624
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:55,845
<i>What mattered to them
was what is Cousteau accomplishing.</i>

625
01:22:57,514 --> 01:23:00,934
<i>Francine started writing the narration
for his films.</i>

626
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:04,896
<i>And helping him to lead
The Cousteau Society.</i>

627
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:11,486
<i>And he said that their kids
gave him a new beginning.</i>

628
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:36,177
<i>And he said that even though
he knew he was at the end of his life,</i>

629
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:38,596
<i>he wasn't finished yet.</i>

630
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:46,312
<i>Antarctica, it of course
is the remote region</i>

631
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:49,733
at the center of a fierce
international debate this morning.

632
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:52,819
Should the majestic continent
forever remain untouched

633
01:23:52,902 --> 01:23:54,070
<i>underneath the ice?</i>

634
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:55,989
<i>Or in a world of diminishing resources,</i>

635
01:23:56,072 --> 01:23:59,034
<i>should Antarctica be tapped
for oil and precious minerals?</i>

636
01:23:59,909 --> 01:24:03,079
You've said the survival
of Antarctica, um,

637
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:05,623
and the survival of the human race
are linked.

638
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:08,168
Is that alarmist,
or explain how that would be?

639
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:12,464
Yes, the science today,

640
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:15,175
understands much better

641
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:20,221
the role of the Antarctic system
in the making of our own climates

642
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:21,556
all over the world.

643
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:28,521
<i>The combination of industrialization
and deforestation</i>

644
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:32,817
<i>have increased the carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere,</i>

645
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:37,155
triggering a dangerous warming up
of our planet.

646
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:43,495
<i>The Antarctic, this mass of ice,
90% of the ice of the world,</i>

647
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,331
governs the climate
even in the United States

648
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:47,874
or Europe in the northern hemisphere.

649
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:52,754
<i>If we touch Antarctica with industry,</i>

650
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:54,964
<i>with explosions and et cetera,</i>

651
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:56,883
we don't know what can happen.

652
01:24:57,050 --> 01:25:00,053
And we may bring
about famines in Africa,

653
01:25:00,136 --> 01:25:03,181
and even droughts in the United States.

654
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:06,851
Because we now understand
that our globe

655
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:11,898
is just one single thermodynamic machine,
that it works simply

656
01:25:11,981 --> 01:25:15,568
with a heat source from the sun,
and a cold source from Antarctica.

657
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:17,237
And we must not touch it.

658
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:36,673
<i>I decided to start a petition,</i>

659
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:40,885
<i>to put pressure on the industry leaders
and the politicians.</i>

660
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:47,433
<i>Because they will not do it
by their own incentive.</i>

661
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:49,853
<i>It has to be under pressure.</i>

662
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:57,485
<i>Now recently, I even had an opportunity
to tell our story</i>

663
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:59,988
<i>to the President of the United States,</i>

664
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:02,991
<i>and I think that he was very receptive
to what we said.</i>

665
01:26:04,617 --> 01:26:08,163
<i>Jacques Cousteau has forced
a change of policy towards Antarctica,</i>

666
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:11,166
<i>against mining
or any exploitation of resources there.</i>

667
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:15,753
<i>Twenty-six nations agreed
to leave Antarctica untouched</i>

668
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:16,963
<i>for at least 50 years.</i>

669
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,113
Distinguished ladies and gentleman,

670
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,782
it is my privilege to talk to you

671
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:48,578
in the most important conference

672
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:51,539
on the environment
that has ever been imagined.

673
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:55,668
<i>The biggest
summit meeting ever has finally begun.</i>

674
01:26:56,252 --> 01:26:58,087
<i>The Earth Summit as it's called.</i>

675
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:03,051
<i>Representatives of 170 nations
have a very tall order,</i>

676
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:06,179
<i>how to prevent making the Earth
an unlivable place.</i>

677
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:09,515
<i>Among the thousands who
are taking part in the Earth Summit,</i>

678
01:27:09,807 --> 01:27:12,435
<i>one man can claim
to have molded public opinion</i>

679
01:27:12,685 --> 01:27:14,479
<i>even before this conference began.</i>

680
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:18,149
<i>Jacques Cousteau's enthusiasm,
his scholarship,</i>

681
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,193
<i>and his reach toward ordinary people</i>

682
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:22,904
<i>have motivated pressure groups
and governments alike.</i>

683
01:27:23,446 --> 01:27:26,115
<i>At the age of 80,
he can take no little credit</i>

684
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:28,076
<i>for bringing the Earth Summit into being.</i>

685
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:37,543
<i>He says he's optimistic
about the outcome of this conference,</i>

686
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:40,672
<i>but warned of continuing threats
to the world's environment.</i>

687
01:27:41,547 --> 01:27:43,841
Non-renewable resources are depleted.

688
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:48,096
Biodiversity shrinks to alarming levels.

689
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:52,725
Energy is in unreasonable demand.

690
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:57,397
And above all,
the melting of glaciers and of ice caps,

691
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,983
and catastrophic rise
of the ocean levels,

692
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:00,942
has already begun.

693
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:05,113
But listen to this,
all the people of the world,

694
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:07,907
the beginning of everything is in Rio.

695
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:11,536
For the first time,
the immense majority of the leaders,

696
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:14,497
they have promised beautiful things.
All of them.

697
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:19,460
Now we have to force them
to transform these words into acts.

698
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:06,299
<i>Captain, are you optimistic
about the way that nations</i>

699
01:29:06,382 --> 01:29:08,426
<i>are going to handle
this resource of ours?</i>

700
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:13,931
<i>I was asked this question
very often and I ask myself this question.</i>

701
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:19,020
<i>When I reason, I put things together,</i>

702
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:24,067
<i>I am optimistic because I have
a great faith in human beings</i>

703
01:29:25,276 --> 01:29:28,738
<i>and I believe that someday
people are going to revolt</i>

704
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:30,698
<i>and begin to care.</i>
