00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:24,208
Who are you guys?
What? What the--

4
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,041
Get out of here.
You're not invited.

5
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,250
Where's your invitation?

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,709
This is a royal wedding.

7
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:32,375
Okay? Don't make me
call security, because I will.

8
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:39,083
Come back here!
This is a very special day,
it has to be perfect.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,417
Whoo. Okay. As your bride
and Queen of Auradon,

10
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:53,583
I vow to accept with
humility and reverence.

11
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:56,917
I pledge my loyalty to...

12
00:00:57,417 --> 00:01:02,083
the, uh, people...

13
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,792
...that I'm not marrying?

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,583
To the United--

15
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,041
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
to the, uh,

16
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,208
the-the United States of
Auradon and Isle of the Lost.

17
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,542
You got this.

18
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:15,000
MAL: Easy. So easy.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
EVIE: Oh, no!

20
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,709
Oh!

21
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,709
Can you help me up please?

22
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,125
MAL: Oh, well, okay.

23
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,291
EVIE: Thanks.

24
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,792
Think the bouquet
is big enough?

25
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,333
MAL: Oof. Wow!

26
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,667
DIZZY: Oh, mon dieu.
Voila!

27
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:33,166
Thank you, Dizzy.
The hair is perfect.

28
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,917
Fun fact.

29
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:38,583
That bouquet is made up
of every single flower
grown in Auradon.

30
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,542
Oh, really?

31
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:44,542
Yeah, but wouldn't it be nice
if people saw the dress too?

32
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:48,000
Some people worked
very hard on it.
And I mean me.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,250
EVIE: I'm some people.

34
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,792
And the hair.
Don't forget the hair.

35
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:53,250
And some people have
other things to worry about,

36
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,000
like thousands of invites,
food, flowers, seating charts,
entertainment.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hello?

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,834
Are the doves here yet?

39
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,959
What do you mean
you don't know?

40
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,333
I'm doing my best.

41
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,667
Audrey, You have been
an amazing wedding planner.

42
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,041
The wedding is going
to be perfect.

43
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,250
Beyond perfect.

44
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,625
I mean, all my friends
are going to be there.

45
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,041
Even my dad is coming.

46
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,291
Oh. Don't forget your mom.

47
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,208
There. I almost forgot.

48
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,000
Aw!

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,583
Dude!

50
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,291
No growling at the
lizard of the bride.

51
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:30,208
I can't help it.
It's instinct.
Take it up with mother nature.

52
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,750
AUDREY: No! Come here,
doggy, doggy.
Come back!

53
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,250
DUDE: I just want to talk!

54
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,625
Is that--?

55
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,208
She got away again.

56
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,792
What? What?
What are you doing here?

57
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,667
I came to check on Mal.

58
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:46,792
M, you aren't supposed
to see each other.
It's bad luck!

59
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,667
Sorry.

60
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,625
Do you think
the bouquet is big enough?

61
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,291
Ugh! Get back to
the palace, Ben.

62
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,458
And catch your mother in law!
BEN: But I--

63
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,709
Uh, okay.

64
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,500
That was close.

65
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,125
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

66
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,875
Nothing could ruin this day.

67
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:07,917
JAY: Welcome.

68
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:10,792
Uma!

69
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,000
Up top!

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,583
I mean-- Ahem!

71
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,041
Welcome to the Royal Wedding.

72
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,709
Um-- My lady, Uma?

73
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,458
Just stick to "Uma", Jay.

74
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,667
That's my name.

75
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,542
Father of the bride! Welcome!

76
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,083
Nice do.

77
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,792
Want me to show you inside?

78
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,333
Okay.

79
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,000
Wait! Wait! come here!

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Lizard of the bride.

81
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,333
Make room for the groom.

82
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,041
Did you see Dude and
the mother of the bride
come by here?

83
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,834
Yeah, they ran inside.
And you just
missed the father of the--

84
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,000
Whoa!

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
...bride.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,834
GUEST 1: Out of the way!
GUEST 2: Help!

87
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:11,083
GUEST 2: Hades has gone mad!
GUEST 1: Help! Help please!
Please help!

88
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,417
GUEST 3: Exit is this way!
Come on, everybody,

89
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:18,291
Please proceed to the nearest
emergency exit in an
orderly fashion.

90
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,208
He just threw water on me.

91
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,125
My outfit is ruined!

92
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,166
Who does that?

93
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,417
And my hair,
I spent hours
on this this morning.

94
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,041
UMA: I can't believe this.

95
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,583
Uma, what happened?

96
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:44,625
Hades. He just toasted
the whole wedding.

97
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,208
Where are you going?

98
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,250
UMA: Hold up.
You're gonna need backup.

99
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,333
Wait.

100
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,583
What do you mean
the doves flew away?

101
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,208
Flew away?

102
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,583
I planned a dove release!

103
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:06,458
Well, you can call Snow White
up and tell her
to figure it out!

104
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,583
It's chaos out there.
What's going on?

105
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,583
It's Hades.

106
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,875
He destroyed The Great Hall.

107
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,583
AUDREY: Oh, no, no! My decor!

108
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,458
AUDREY: My beautiful...
JAY: If it helps,

109
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,792
JAY: he tried to be friendly.
AUDREY: ...perfect decor!

110
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:24,458
I mean, he bared his teeth,
which is kind of like smiling.

111
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:28,583
I know how disappointed
you are, but we'll be here.

112
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:32,709
I'm not disappointed because
my dad would never
purposefully ruin my wedding.

113
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,792
This is just some kind
of big misunderstanding.

114
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,375
Okay?
Misunderstanding?

115
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,125
The wedding is on fire.

116
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,959
And if it was a mistake,
why did he run away?

117
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:47,125
Even if his heart
is in the right place,

118
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,041
maybe it would be smoother
if he isn't there.

119
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,208
Well, I'm not getting
married without him.

120
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,125
My father is walking me
down that aisle,

121
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,875
and I'm gonna find him,
and I'm gonna talk
to him myself.

122
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,250
M, you're not running off
to the aisle on your own!

123
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,375
Well, then come with me.

124
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,583
If anyone can bring
him back, we can.

125
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,208
Because we're rotten.

126
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,458
ALL: To the core.

127
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,417
Send out the mini tacos.

128
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,166
There's going to be a delay.

129
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,500
Uh, Mal, could we not
adventure in these dresses?

130
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,417
Oh, yeah, totally.

131
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:19,667
I totally get that.

132
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,000
Thanks.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,375
That's better.
Right?

134
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:28,250
I know. I am doing my best
to keep her on schedule.
Work with me here.

135
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:31,000
What?

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,166
What do you mean the swans
have a thing? What could swans
possibly have to deal with?

137
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,875
Oh.

138
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,208
Isle of the Lost, here we--

139
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,291
Hold on.

140
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,291
Mal?

141
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,875
Mal. Are you okay?

142
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:48,959
Yeah. No, I just, um
I really wish Carlos was here.

143
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,959
We all do.

144
00:06:55,125 --> 00:07:00,959
We were going to wait until
the reception, but now seems
like a better time.

145
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,166
Oh. Wow.

146
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:12,208
It is so beautiful.

147
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:17,041
It's our crests.
The four VKs.
Linked together forever.

148
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:20,083
I love it.

149
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,083
Thank you, guys.

150
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:30,500
Uh, so I really hate
to interrupt this,
but you should see this.

151
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,709
ALL: What?

152
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,291
Whoa.

153
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,291
Dad!

154
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:44,875
EVIE: Uma, what happened?

155
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,542
UMA: Hades happened.

156
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:51,083
Wow. When your dad
burns bridges, he literally
burns bridges.

157
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,959
Look, I tried to catch
him, okay?
And get him to chill.

158
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,750
But his hair was wild and
it was blowing the wind
and set the bridge on fire.

159
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,667
I need to get
to the aisle and
bring my dad back.

160
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,542
If you could help me, please.

161
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,667
For the queen
on her wedding day, I got you.

162
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,583
Ya'll might wanna stand back!

163
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,625
I told you...
JAY: Audrey! Look out!

164
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,500
Thank you, Uma. Uma!

165
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,542
JAY: Whoo! Way to go!
Uma, you're amazing.

166
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:39,667
Hurray, Uma!
You're so great.

167
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,250
Consider it my
wedding present.

168
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,583
Now go get your dad.

169
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,375
I'll get all your guests
back to the reception.

170
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,250
JAY: Up top.
EVIE: Thank you, Uma.

171
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,458
JAY:
I'll see you at the wedding.

172
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,583
Hey, I'm never
going to forget this.

173
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,959
MAL:
Home sweet home.

174
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,792
I love that the Isle
has had a major glow up!

175
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:21,709
Yeah, wow.
it's a lot cleaner now, too.

176
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,750
Define "a lot."

177
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:35,709
Hold it, hold it.

178
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,166
Boss says nobody gets inside.

179
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,750
Dave, what? Come on.
It's me.

180
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,583
Sorry, Mal.
Orders is orders.

181
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,333
Hey, it's my wedding day.

182
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,750
Oh, yeah. Happy wedding day.

183
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,458
Unfortunately,
can't let you in.

184
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,000
But congrats on the big day.

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,458
Save us some cake.

186
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,750
Ugh, guess I'm going to have
to do this the hard way.

187
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,917
Whaa...

188
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,125
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, woah! Mal!

189
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,083
Mal, calm down.
Calm down.

190
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:32,834
Hi, Dad.

191
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,500
We need to talk.

192
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,625
Mal.

193
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,625
Ben.

194
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,792
Hey, you're not
supposed to see me.

195
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:54,083
Whoa! Close your eyes.
Bad luck.

196
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,125
What are you doing here?

197
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,458
Getting this guy
back to the ceremony.

198
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,083
Even if I have to drag him
by his freaky blue hair...

199
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:07,333
or appeal to him
with logic and reason.

200
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,875
I knew you would want
him to be there
no matter what he did.

201
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:15,083
Oh! I caught your mom too.

202
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,500
That's her, all right.

203
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,500
I'd recognize those cold,
dead eyes anywhere.

204
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,625
Looking good, Maleficent.

205
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,834
Dad, please come back.

206
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:29,083
You know how much
it means to me
to have you there.

207
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,792
And I wanted to be there,
believe me.

208
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,542
But I still terrify people.

209
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:40,250
I can't help it.
Especially when
I lose control.

210
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,834
You should have seen the--

211
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:42,834
MAL: Dad.

212
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:50,000
All right, look in my heart,
I'm still a ruthless villain,

213
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,959
but I'm not ruthless enough
to ruin the happiest day
of your life.

214
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,417
I'm sorry.

215
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:58,375
You don't have to be.

216
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,583
I know what happened
wasn't your fault.

217
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,500
Hmm, it really wasn't...

218
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,000
HADES: I'm not a fool.

219
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,667
I know everyone
expects the worst of me.

220
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:14,959
But I didn't want
to ruin your day. So...

221
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:25,709
HADES: I did my best
to be friendly, to keep
cool. Until...

222
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:27,667
DUDE: Come over here!

223
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,083
Come back!

224
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,583
HADES: I thought if
I helped, it would
ease the tension but...

225
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,875
Hey!

226
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,000
DUDE: That one's mine!
Get your own Lizard.

227
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,417
HADES: I tried to put
it out. I really tried.

228
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:54,542
FEMALE VOICE:
Remain calm! Don't panic.

229
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:08,250
CHAD: Is there fire
on me? Help! I think
there's fire on me.

230
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,125
Help! Help!

231
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,166
CHAD: Is there fire on me?
Somebody help me out!

232
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,291
HADES: Okay, full disclosure.
Chad wasn't on fire,

233
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:22,750
but I couldn't resist
because he's the worst.
So that one's on me.

234
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,792
Understandable.
He's the worst, right?
Yep. Chad is the worst.

235
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:29,917
My hair, my hair! Anyone?

236
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,000
CHAD: It's so cold!

237
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,583
WOMAN: Please proceed to
the nearest emergency exit
in an orderly fashion.

238
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:51,000
HADES : I know,
I ruined everything, but
I swear it wasn't on purpose.

239
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:00,625
Dad, I never thought
for a moment that you
did it on purpose.

240
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,333
It's not going to be
my happiest day
if you're not there.

241
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,208
I want to be surrounded
by the people that I love.

242
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,542
And that means you.

243
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,125
And I love you, Mom.

244
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:22,625
Whether you have skin or
scales. Or you fit in my
pocket or you breathe fire.

245
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,625
You'll always be my mom.

246
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,041
There you are!

247
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,333
Ben! Mal!

248
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,667
BEAST: Oh, you guys!
We were so worried about you.

249
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:43,041
Okay, yes, Very emotional.
Loving it. But tic-tok people!

250
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,750
Chop-chop!
Let's hustle, everybody.

251
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,083
Bippity boppity--
Hold on!

252
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,750
You want to be
married surrounded by
the people you love.

253
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:55,291
So do I and here they are.

254
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:59,500
Hades, we love you.
I want you to feel welcome.

255
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:05,291
Mal, I want you to enjoy
every moment of today.

256
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,125
So what do you say?

257
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,625
Will you marry me
here? Right now?

258
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,834
Yes, That would be... perfect.

259
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:17,166
Wait, wait, wait!

260
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:21,208
No, no, no. The orchestra!
The swans! The fireworks!

261
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,250
The dress.

262
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,000
Kind of what I do.

263
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,542
Hey, FG, you think you can
help with, you know...

264
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:41,834
the atmosphere,
because this place...

265
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,500
Bippity! Boppity! Woooo!

266
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:57,667
Wow!

267
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,458
Okay, I can work with this.

268
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,291
It just needs a little...

269
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:05,375
VK flare?

270
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,792
That is exactly what it needs.

271
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,583
Let's do this!

272
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:11,458
Mal Bertha, with this ring,
I pledge everything
that I have to you.

273
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:15,041
My life, my kingdom, my heart.

274
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,959
I promise to always
be there for you,

275
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,667
to accept everything
that you are and to always
put you first.

276
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:37,792
MAL: With this ring,
I pledge to you
all the days of my life,

277
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:41,291
all of my burdens
and all of my joys.

278
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,625
I promise to be
my best for you,

279
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,625
to share all my secrets,

280
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:51,333
and to keep yours
and to choose good always.

281
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,375
Do you, Ben, take Mal
to be your wife,

282
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,000
to love and cherish forever?

283
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:00,792
I do.

284
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,959
Do you, Mal, take Ben
to be your husband,

285
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:09,500
to love and cherish forever?

286
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:11,250
I do.

287
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,000
By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you...

288
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,625
husband and wife!

289
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:20,542
Bippity boppity woooo!

290
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,041
I love you guys.

291
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,500
Whoo!

292
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:20,959
You're so muscular.

293
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,125
Do you want to dance?

294
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,417
Mind if I join you?

295
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:46,250
I'm married!

296
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:01,041
BEN:
So this is what happily
ever after looks like.

297
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,083
For us?

298
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,750
Yes.

299
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:10,166
But somewhere another
story could be just beginning.
