3
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,083
Come on, everyone.

4
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,250
What did you steal?

5
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,875
-I got a sugar cube.
-I got a biscuit crumb.

6
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,541
-I got a toenail.
-Oops.

7
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,458
-Dad?
-Yes?

8
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,291
On the next sneak,
can we break into the house with the…

9
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,583
What's that?

10
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,083
Oh, it's a…

11
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,333
Inside! Now!

12
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,458
It's a… It's…

13
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,541
Funny-looking. Can we eat it?

14
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,875
No! It's a…

15
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,791
Well, it's a robin, I think.

16
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,875
Hi, Robin.

17
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,666
Can we keep her?

18
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,541
Well, maybe.

19
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,958
After all, she's only one little…

20
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,333
robin.

21
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:42,958
Wait.

22
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:45,833
Wait for it.

23
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,666
Okay, let's go slowly--

24
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,041
-Yes!
-Hey!

25
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,791
We're on our way to break into a house

26
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,666
Might be a bird
But I sneak just like a mouse

27
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,500
-So, what are you getting tonight?
-I might get a pie crumb?

28
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,833
-Something moldy, I think.
-Well, I'm gonna sneak a whole crust.

29
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:26,791
Well, I'm going to sneak
a whole sandwich. Yes.

30
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,750
-You can't sneak a whole sandwich.
-How do you sneak a sandwich?

31
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,166
Like this.

32
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,000
Race you to the fence!

33
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,916
That's in my eye!

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,958
Don't do that.

35
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,375
-Pip, you're up front.
-Yes, Dad.

36
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,000
-Dink, don't drag your tail.
-Okay.

37
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,000
-Flynn, Flin, no showing off.
-All right.

38
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:48,916
And, Robin…

39
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,500
Got it, Dad!

40
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,875
I didn't say anything.

41
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:54,791
Robin!

42
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:56,791
Robin?

43
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,791
The rules of the sneak are simple and thus

44
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,791
Follow them close
You could steal a crust

45
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,833
-Or a crumpet rind
-Or a pinch of pie

46
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,708
Or the grease from the tip
Of a soggy french fry

47
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,333
Crumbs and crusts and stale bread

48
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,458
Soggy flakes and bin dregs

49
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:27,208
Any old leftovers
We'll sneak home with us

50
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,791
First find a secret entrance

51
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,750
Keep your eyes open wide

52
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:32,833
-For a hole
-Or a crack

53
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:36,166
-Or a window with a gap
-Just enough to squeeze inside

54
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:42,583
Once we're in, we creep around
Tiptoe past without a sound

55
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,750
Keep to the shadows
Don't get heard

56
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,333
Whisper every single word

57
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,583
-What?
-Come on.

58
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,416
Last, the most important
Remember in the who-man place

59
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,750
They're choosy who's invited

60
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:03,291
So we must never leave a trace

61
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,458
Crumbs and crusts and stale bread
Soggy flakes and bin dregs

62
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:11,750
Any old leftovers
We'll sneak home with us

63
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,875
A whole sandwich!

64
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:21,250
When we're done, we disappear
Nobody knows that we were here

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,291
-With crumbs in our hands
-And warmth in our hearts

66
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,833
And the sludge from the tin
Of a moldy jam tart

67
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:30,750
-Don't make a sound
-Robin!

68
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,833
Don't leave a trace

69
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,708
Keep to the shadows
Take what we need

70
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:40,166
The rules of the sneak are these

71
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,250
Who-mans!

72
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,458
Robin!

73
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,291
Well, let's not go back there again.

74
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,541
They'll be setting out traps
or maybe even getting a kitten.

75
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,583
Kittens!

76
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,416
Don't listen to them.

77
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,375
-Nice one, Robin.
-What?

78
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,125
Well, the spoon, and the sandwich, and--

79
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,750
Pip, enough of that.

80
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,875
Come on. We've still got plenty to eat.

81
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,625
There's the bag of Earl Grey.

82
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,250
I'm sick of Earl Grey!

83
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,166
All right. Well, come on now. Off to bed.

84
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,416
It's okay, Robin.
We'll figure this out together.

85
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,541
Yeah. I mean, next time, I'll just…

86
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:57,166
Stay away from spoons. Yeah.

87
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,375
All that mold!

88
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,791
Sandwich…

89
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,875
"Hi, Robin. What's all this?"

90
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,250
"Crumbs? For the whole family?"

91
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,583
"Yeah. It was easy.
Just got them from a who-man house."

92
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:50,250
"Oh, wow, Robin!
You're the most amazing sneak ever!"

93
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,208
Can't wait to see the look on Pip's face

94
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,250
when I come back
with a crumb the size of his head.

95
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:10,041
No. No. No. No.

96
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,708
Oh, excuse me.

97
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,458
-Do you know where the--
-No.

98
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,375
Okay. Thanks anyway.

99
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,458
The who-man house.

100
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,500
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize this was a…

101
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,458
cat house!

102
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,625
No. No.

103
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,958
Now, that's a yes!

104
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:55,875
Cat!

105
00:08:58,875 --> 00:08:59,708
Oh dear.

106
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,791
Silly bird, fly!

107
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:04,916
What? Wait!

108
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,916
Why aren't you flying?

109
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,583
I can't fly.

110
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,375
Why aren't you flying?

111
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:24,958
-Well, I've got a broken wing!
-Oh no. How did that happen?

112
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,958
Magpie? Wait for me!

113
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,875
-Let's get you safe indoors, hey?
-Thanks. Is the cat still--

114
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,833
Poor little thing.

115
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,875
Oh, awful!

116
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,750
Out there all by yourself--

117
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,791
-Are we safe in here?
-Yes. We're safe.

118
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,708
The thorns keep unwanted visitors out.

119
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,750
Usually.

120
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:04,958
Oh, good.

121
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,666
Is this your house?

122
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,333
It's very…

123
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,291
Why, thank you. I suppose it is rather…

124
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,416
Perfect.

125
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:18,958
Well…

126
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,291
A who-man house.

127
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,791
Bet they've got loads of crumbs in there.

128
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,083
Them. Yes.

129
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,708
They've got loads of everything.

130
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:36,583
And all because of that
magic shiny wishing star, eh?

131
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,416
Yeah.

132
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,541
The magic shiny…

133
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,708
Wait. Sorry, what?

134
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:43,625
The star.

135
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,083
You don't…

136
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,000
Right!

137
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,583
Okay. It must be here somewhere.

138
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:57,291
Once a year, the who-mans
take the spikiest tree in the woods,

139
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,750
cover it in tin-soil and boo-bells,

140
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:04,166
until their tree
is all twinkling and beautiful.

141
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,166
Just like mine.

142
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:14,833
Then, they put a shiny magic star on top,
make a wish,

143
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:19,375
and in the morning,
they get anything they want.

144
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,291
Like crumbs.

145
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,000
Crumbs?

146
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't be absurd.

147
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,916
Well, what could be better than crumbs?

148
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,208
"What could be better than…"

149
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,458
Things!

150
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,166
Things, they make you happy

151
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,166
Things won't fly away

152
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,500
Things will stick with you till the end

153
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:51,083
Oh yes, on things you can depend

154
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,208
See my bathtub? It's designer

155
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,916
Finest china! Well, kinda

156
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,916
Simply must have the latest bottle top
I love it so, I'll never stop

157
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,750
This chair? Hedgehog hair

158
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,416
Pamperclips? I've got the pair

159
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,333
This is a limited-edition piece of string

160
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:13,958
I was a bird who couldn't fly
Felt tiny while they flew up high

161
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,625
Surrounded myself with things so gorgeous

162
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,750
Felt enormous!

163
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,500
So afraid and alone

164
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,125
Things turn a hovel to a home

165
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,500
Got no personality?
I let my lampshade speak for me

166
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:31,916
Hollow inside? You're not enough?
Just stuff that hole with lovely stuff

167
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,083
Things are things that make you happy
Who needs friends? I've got a shoe chair

168
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:40,708
No one there for you to care for?
Polish up your silverware for?

169
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:47,791
There's no better company than one penny

170
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,875
Look, my point is,
wish for something far better than crumbs.

171
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,500
Right.

172
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,416
Better than crumbs?

173
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,250
Like a whole sandwich!

174
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:18,708
Never mind.

175
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,250
Okay, then.

176
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,791
I'll do it.

177
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,791
-Do what?
-I'll go get the star.

178
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:27,416
Impossible! It's inside the who-man house.

179
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,625
Maybe I forgot to mention?
I was raised by mice.

180
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,791
Explains the ears.

181
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,833
And if there's one thing
us mice are good at, it's sneaking.

182
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,250
Sorry, what?

183
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,416
Oh, like, into houses.

184
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,250
To get stuff. Like, stealing it.

185
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:47,791
Right.

186
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,916
Right!

187
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,500
Show me.

188
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,000
Okay. I'm in.

189
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,750
What are you doing?
You're supposed to wait outside.

190
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,916
-I thought that we were--
-Who-mans!

191
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,833
Okay.

192
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:33,625
We're going to have to be
the sneakiest mice we've ever been.

193
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,208
I'm not a mouse.

194
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,208
Just do exactly what I do.

195
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,833
What are you doing?
You'll wake the who-mans.

196
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,833
I'm being a sneaky mouse.

197
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,458
That's not sneaking.

198
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,208
The whole point of being a mouse

199
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,916
is that you don't draw attention
to yourself.

200
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,708
Careful.

201
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,416
Careful.

202
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,583
Got it!

203
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:00,833
Who-mans!

204
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,750
Not bad for a couple
of flightless fools, eh?

205
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,958
Why is it you don't fly?

206
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,500
I just never learned.
I mean, mice don't fly.

207
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,291
Well, it's easy! You just flap!

208
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,625
No, thanks. I'll just…

209
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:28,791
All right!

210
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,333
Oh, you're a natural!

211
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,541
Oh dear.

212
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,375
The star!

213
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:22,375
Perfect.

214
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:31,916
Hello.

215
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,125
What's this?

216
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,916
An unexpected visitor.

217
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,125
Why…

218
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:49,500
it's the little bird
who sneaks about on the floor like a…

219
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,916
mouse?

220
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,708
And who are you trying to fool
with those…

221
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,541
funny things?

222
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,708
-My family are mice, so…
-Mice?

223
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,500
Oh, and the ears are…

224
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,583
Oh, I see.

225
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,250
So tragic. So sad.

226
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,750
Trying to fit in.

227
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,333
You know you'll never be a real mouse.

228
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh, no, I…

229
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,416
You see,

230
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,916
you're a misfit.

231
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,750
You're an oddball.

232
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,625
You're a freak.

233
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,000
No, I'm not.

234
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,541
Micey ears atop a birdy beak

235
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,541
Well, yeah.

236
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:39,666
But I've never seen a bird
So peculiar, so absurd

237
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,375
How about we play a game
Of hide-and-seek, if you can?

238
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,416
As a mouse, to me
You seem to be just terrible

239
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,875
Fitting in is more
Than dress-up and pretend

240
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:57,125
If it's fitting in you're desperate for
Come down, search no more

241
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,041
I know the perfect place
For you, my friend

242
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,500
For you, I've the perfect place

243
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,375
Not picky, stick with me
What's in a name?

244
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,666
A robin or a mouse?

245
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,750
After all, under the skin
You're all the same

246
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,291
It's what's inside that counts

247
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:23,125
Fitting in could be a breeze

248
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,750
Just a squash and a squeeze

249
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,583
Brush out those ears
Come along with me

250
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:35,125
Quick as a glug
You could be sitting snug, perfectly

251
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,416
You don't fit in
But you'd fit into my belly

252
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,416
For you, I've the perfect place

253
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,500
For you, I've the perfect place

254
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:50,583
You really are a terrible mouse

255
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:54,541
with nowhere left to sneak.

256
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,625
Robin! And the star!

257
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,541
And the…

258
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,208
This is bad.

259
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,375
Get back!

260
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:04,708
Oops.

261
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,833
That's made it worse.

262
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,083
We did it! Everlasting happiness awaits!

263
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,916
Told you us mice are good at sneaking.

264
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:30,916
Sneaking?

265
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,208
You know, I think we make very bad mice.

266
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,208
Yes. Quite terrible.

267
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,833
But who cares? We got the star!

268
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,458
Terrible?

269
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,791
I'm not a terrible mouse.

270
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,291
Am I?

271
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:04,750
This goes here.

272
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:06,791
There we go.

273
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,541
Isn't this wonderful?

274
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,041
Suppose so.

275
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,041
Well, I hope you thought
of something better to wish for

276
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,666
than a soggy old sandwich.

277
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:24,708
You know, like a hubcap.
Or a shiny fork. Or a pincil sharpener.

278
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:30,000
Or a thimble. Or how about a safety pin…

279
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:36,750
Yeah.

280
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,333
Well, I wish I wasn't a bird.

281
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,291
I wish I was a mouse.

282
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
A real one.

283
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:13,833
Magpie?

284
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,250
Robin?

285
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,166
It…

286
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,875
It didn't work, did it?

287
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:29,958
No.

288
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,833
Come now.
It was always a bit of a long shot, eh?

289
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,083
Stars and wishes.

290
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,166
A fool's dream

291
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:46,958
was what it was.

292
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,291
A mad…

293
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,000
fool's…

294
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,625
dream!

295
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:07,291
It works! Robin! The star!

296
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:08,875
It works!

297
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:16,916
A real one.

298
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,375
What's that? For me?

299
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,833
A lovely, shiny…

300
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:23,916
Wonderful!

301
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,458
What the…

302
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,125
-Robin!
-Robin!

303
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:31,875
Robin!

304
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:34,708
Dad?

305
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,583
We've been looking everywhere for you!

306
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,958
-Robin?
-Sorry, I…

307
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,666
I went to sneak us some crumbs, but…

308
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,375
it all went wrong.

309
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,375
Because, well,

310
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,250
I think I'm a…

311
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,541
terrible mouse.

312
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,458
Robin…

313
00:23:57,541 --> 00:24:00,208
I couldn't have said it better myself.

314
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,041
In!

315
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:06,750
A kitten.

316
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:14,833
It's all right.

317
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,958
Don't worry.
There's no way she could fit through the…

318
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:23,291
door!

319
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,208
Oh, look.

320
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:30,541
It's the whole family.

321
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,083
What are you doing?

322
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,541
-Robin!
-What is she doing?

323
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,666
She's being a terrible mouse.

324
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:07,333
The rules of the sneak are these

325
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:08,416
And that!

326
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,708
And this! And that!

327
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:36,875
You really are

328
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,625
a terrible,

329
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:44,416
terrible, terrible mouse…

330
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:52,208
with nowhere left to sneak.

331
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:54,000
Wait.

332
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,625
I don't need to sneak.

333
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:59,666
I'm a bir…

334
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:03,291
d.

335
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:07,916
Robin!

336
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:12,958
Robin!

337
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:44,916
-Robin!
-Dad!

338
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,000
Robin!

339
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,000
That was the most un-sneaky…

340
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,875
-And stupid…
-And brilliant…

341
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:53,583
Birdy-mousy thing we've ever seen!

342
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:56,583
Robin, you were marvelous.

343
00:26:58,666 --> 00:26:59,708
Thanks, Dad.

344
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:03,125
Robin, you're not a mouse.

345
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:07,250
But, of course, you're a mouse.

346
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:11,375
-Sorry, is that confusing?
-Yeah, what? She's a bird.

347
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:14,875
Exactly. She is a bird,
and that's wonderful.

348
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:20,708
And what I mean is,
we're the mouse family. All of us.

349
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:26,166
-Is the cat one of the family?
-No, Dink. The cat tried to eat us.

350
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:30,250
-Because she loves us?
-No. Because she's a predator.

351
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:33,958
-So, you fly now?
-Well, yeah. I guess so.

352
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:37,833
But we're all still hungry,
and you've ruined Magpie's house.

353
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:40,833
That's okay. They're only things.

354
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:45,666
Yeah, and I'm bad at sneaking.

355
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:49,041
If anything,
I just draw attention to myself.

356
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:10,916
Hey! Over here!

357
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,875
A song for your ear

358
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,625
While we keep to the shadows

359
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:22,041
Don't get heard
Whisper every single word

360
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:29,708
Look at me fly
Catching your eye

361
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,875
-With crumbs in our arms
-And a raisin or two

362
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:37,333
And a coin from the middle
Of this sticky brown poo

363
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:41,625
Look at me
