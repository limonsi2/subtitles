00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,846
I got my revenge, though.

187
00:13:09,864 --> 00:13:13,032
Now her daughter keeps
her up half the night.

188
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:16,035
And you know,
I don't feel any sympathy!

189
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:17,111
Oh boy.

190
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,187
Nice to meet you.

191
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:21,691
Uh, I know this
might sound weird,

192
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:24,877
But I think I've
seen you here before?

193
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,031
It's possible,
I'm here almost every day.

194
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:29,307
I'm cathy.

195
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:30,533
Cathy driver.

196
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:31,726
Taylor, hi.

197
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,887
And this little one is maya.

198
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,773
Well hello, maya.

199
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:44,155
So, do you just take photos
of the pond mostly?

200
00:13:44,232 --> 00:13:46,140
The woods, animals.

201
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,160
But I'd really like to
get into portrait photography.

202
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:51,554
People...

203
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:53,480
Yeah, I prefer infants
and toddlers though,

204
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,225
Because they're
so much fun to shoot.

205
00:13:56,244 --> 00:13:58,244
Problem is nowadays
everyone that has an iphone

206
00:13:58,396 --> 00:13:59,896
Thinks they're a professional.

207
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:02,006
That's why I
still shoot on film.

208
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:03,416
It sets my work apart.

209
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:04,917
I think it gives
the photos a warmth

210
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,421
That you just can't
replicate with digital.

211
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:12,666
Yeah, we tried to do a shoot
when maya was born.

212
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:16,079
They put her in those
ridiculous vegetable costumes

213
00:14:16,097 --> 00:14:17,838
Against a garden backdrop.

214
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,149
Maya wasn't having any of it.

215
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:23,820
I'm sure she was still adorable.

216
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:27,590
You know...

217
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:30,017
I'd be more than happy to setup
a photo shoot with maya.

218
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,928
Totally free, of course.

219
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:34,521
Oh, no. I couldn't--

220
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,541
Why not?
It's a win-win for both of us.

221
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:37,858
You get free photos

222
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:41,671
And I get to build up
on my portrait portfolio.

223
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:44,531
I couldn't.

224
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,625
I understand.

225
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:47,443
Just know the offer
is always open.

226
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:49,053
It was really nice meeting you.

227
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,631
And nice to
meeting you too, maya.

228
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:54,017
It was nice to
meet you too, cathy.

00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:30,137
I just heard a loud noise
in the house.

242
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,548
I think someone might be inside!

243
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:33,899

You okay?

247
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:49,156
My officers have been
through the entire house.

248
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,416
Top to bottom.

249
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:51,901
Twice.

250
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,012
Let me guess, you didn't
find anything?

251
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:57,240
I didn't imagine the noise.

252
00:16:57,258 --> 00:16:58,407
It woke me.

253
00:16:58,426 --> 00:16:59,500
It woke her, too.

254
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,077
I'm not saying you did.

255
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,836
But the fact remains,

256
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,414
We found no evidence
of a break-in.

257
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:08,751
Can't you check for
fingerprints, or something?

258
00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:11,678
We really only do that when
something of value was taken.

259
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,440
And even then, only when
there's a strong possibility

260
00:17:14,592 --> 00:17:16,592
That we'll be able to
pull prints from somewhere.

261
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:18,185
It's not like you see
in the movies.

262
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,930
Well, what about the curtains?

263
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:23,266
My six-month-old didn't
climb up out of her crib

264
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:24,834
And open them herself.

265
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:27,962
Show me.

266
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:49,458
When I came to check on her,
I made sure they were closed.

267
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:51,903
But when I came back,
after I heard the noise,

268
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:54,130
They were open like this.

269
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:58,467
Look, mrs. Lewis, can I
tell you what I really think?

270
00:17:58,486 --> 00:17:59,969
Something woke you.

271
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:03,063
Could have been water in
the pipes, air in the ducts.

272
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,566
Maybe even something
falling off the shelves.

273
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,234
You were in a deep sleep.

274
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,478
You woke up
confused and frightened.

275
00:18:09,497 --> 00:18:11,405
Things you wouldn't think twice
about during the day,

276
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,907
Now seem scary.

277
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,167
I promise you...

278
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,428
All of this will look
different in the morning.

279
00:18:18,673 --> 00:18:20,932
I can have a car stay outside
your house until dawn

280
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,008
If it will make you feel better?

281
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:24,268
No.

282
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,345
That's okay, I'll be fine.

283
00:18:26,497 --> 00:18:28,831
You sure?

284
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,015
All right.

285
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:32,235
Anything else happens,
you give me a call.

286
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:05,701
Oh, cathy!

287
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,311
Cathy, over here!

288
00:19:09,465 --> 00:19:10,815
I thought that
was you over there.

289
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:12,208
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:14,727
I didn't even notice you
until you called my name.

291
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:17,971
I was tracking a lady bug,
I guess I spaced out a little.

292
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,158
Sometimes I get like that
when I'm shooting.

293
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:21,659
I hope I didn't disturb you.

294
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,327
Oh no, I got all
the shots I wanted.

295
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:25,554
I was gonna head home anyway.

296
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:29,834
Before you go, I wanted
to ask you a question.

297
00:19:31,078 --> 00:19:34,005
If your offer still stands,

298
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:35,673
You know, about the photos?

299
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:38,401
I would love to
take you up on it.

300
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:39,752
Really?

301
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:41,495
Well, of course it does!

302
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,588
Yeah?

303
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,516
I just thought your offer
was so generous.

304
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:50,188
And new photos of maya would
be such a great gift for dean.

305
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:52,248
That's my husband.

306
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:54,174
Yes, they will make
a fantastic gift.

307
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,693
I promise you.

308
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:58,029
Great, so where do we do it?

309
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,864
Do you have a studio, or...?

310
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,365
Oh, I wish.

311
00:20:02,443 --> 00:20:05,018
Actually, if it isn't
an imposition for you,

312
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,538
I was really hoping
to do this at your home.

313
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:11,434
I don't know--

314
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:12,376
Or not.

315
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:14,194
You know what,
I can rent a place.

316
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,454
Make it look as good.

317
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:17,548
I was just thinking it
might be more intimate.

318
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,291
Maya might feel
more comfortable.

319
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:21,110
But you know what, little maya?

320
00:20:21,112 --> 00:20:22,294
Don't you worry.

321
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:25,297
You will look absolutely
adorable, no matter what.

322
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,058
Listen, here's my card.

323
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:30,061
It has all my information on it.

324
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:32,396
And when I find
the perfect place,

325
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:34,065
I'll let you know.

326
00:20:36,644 --> 00:20:38,069
Cathy?

327
00:20:39,814 --> 00:20:42,798
Let's just, let's do them
at our house.

328
00:20:42,817 --> 00:20:43,966
You sure?

329
00:20:43,968 --> 00:20:45,634
Yeah.

330
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:47,411
Tomorrow then?

331
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:48,487
That's not too soon?

332
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:50,473
Not for me.

333
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:51,824
How about noon?

334
00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:53,918
Maya usually wakes up
from her first nap by then,

335
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:56,145
So she'll be in a good mood.

336
00:20:56,147 --> 00:20:57,421
Perfect.

337
00:20:57,573 --> 00:20:59,423
I am so excited, taylor!

338
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:01,092
This is going to be so much fun!

339
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:02,593
I'll see you then.

340
00:21:13,347 --> 00:21:15,422
<i> And you made sure they</i>
<i> all knew it was you?</i>

341
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,941
That you were
the one responsible

342
00:21:17,018 --> 00:21:19,110
For the new idea
for the platform?

343
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:21,112
<i> I told them it was a</i>
<i> collaborative effort.</i>

344
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:23,096
Modesty is very important
over here.

345
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,264
Just don't be too modest

346
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,509
When it comes time
for your raise.

347
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:28,119
You know me when it
comes to negotiation,

348
00:21:28,195 --> 00:21:29,787
I'm as tough as they come.

349
00:21:30,681 --> 00:21:31,772
I really hate to say it,

350
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,625
But I didn't think
I'd miss you this much.

351
00:21:34,777 --> 00:21:38,963
I'm not gonna lie,
I kind of like hearing that.

352
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:40,873
And I have a big surprise
planned

353
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:42,616
For when you get back.

354
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,194
I've been thinking
about that every night.

355
00:21:45,212 --> 00:21:46,362
Not that kind of surprise,

356
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,639
But I promise you're
still gonna like it.

357
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:52,551
I can't wait.

358
00:21:52,703 --> 00:21:55,538
You know, you sound really good.

359
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,373
I have to be honest,
I didn't want to say anything,

360
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,318
But the last couple of days,
you sounded kind of off.

361
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,156
I'm sure I was just tired.

362
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:10,494
It's not so easy with you gone.

363
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:12,888
I'm going to remind you
of that when I get back.

364
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,999
I have no doubt.

365
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,335
Well, I've got to get to bed.

366
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:19,061
Maya and I have a big day
tomorrow.

367
00:22:19,063 --> 00:22:20,729
Oh yeah? What?

368
00:22:20,748 --> 00:22:23,674
I already told you.
The big surprise.

369
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:25,009
Oh, the surprise.

370
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:27,511
I love you.

371
00:22:27,588 --> 00:22:29,347
<i> Love you too.</i>
<i> Goodnight sweetheart.</i>

372
00:22:29,498 --> 00:22:31,015
Okay, bye.

375
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:45,863
Hi cathy!

376
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:47,365
Come on in.

377
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:48,866
Thank you.

378
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:57,208
Taylor, I'd like you
to meet skylar.

379
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,543
Hi, nice to meet you.

380
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:01,027
Are you a photographer too?

381
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,046
Oh no, hardly.

382
00:23:02,123 --> 00:23:04,215
I just help out
where I'm needed.

383
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:06,884
Which makes it a lot harder
for me to say no

384
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:09,136
When you ask me to help you out.

385
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:13,616
I have a nine-month-old at home.

386
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,560
So I know exactly
what you're going through.

387
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:20,898
Oh, no!

388
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:23,067
You were right,
she's a little princess.

389
00:23:23,144 --> 00:23:26,737
I told skylar that maya is going
to make our job a lot easier.

390
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,156
You can't take a bad photo
of her.

391
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:33,411
So where would you
like to set up?

392
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:35,579
Just let me know.

393
00:23:35,731 --> 00:23:37,581
Wherever you need.

394
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:39,324
Maybe let's take
a look around first

395
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:43,087
And then we can decide
on the best spots.

396
00:23:43,164 --> 00:23:44,755
Bring the gear?

397
00:23:44,832 --> 00:23:46,239
Leave the gear.

398
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,093
It might be nice to use
some of this natural lighting.

399
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:50,428
Oh, cathy.

400
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,004
You're going to be
using actual film

401
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:53,931
Like you did in the park, right?

402
00:23:54,008 --> 00:23:56,675
Uh, normally yes,
but we thought

403
00:23:56,827 --> 00:23:59,011
We might be taking
a lot of photos today,

404
00:23:59,163 --> 00:24:01,272
So digital is just a bit more
practical.

405
00:24:01,348 --> 00:24:04,108
Plus, I can play around
with it in photoshop after.

406
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:05,526
Okay.

407
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,282
Oh, this is going to be perfect.

408
00:24:12,526 --> 00:24:14,368
Just perfect.

409
00:24:21,352 --> 00:24:24,110
So skylar,
do you have a boy or a girl?

410
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,796
A little girl.

411
00:24:25,873 --> 00:24:27,965
Who keeps me plenty busy.

412
00:24:28,116 --> 00:24:29,133
You're telling me.

413
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:32,361
Nine months,
what's happening then?

414
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:34,196
I have so much to focus on,

415
00:24:34,198 --> 00:24:37,032
I haven't had time to
read ahead in my baby book.

416
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:39,459
Oh, you know.

417
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,479
They grow up so fast.

418
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:43,981
They're doing new things
every day.

419
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:47,968
Growing like a weed,
that's for sure.

420
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,820
I think we should start
in here, taylor.

421
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:52,064
I already have so many ideas.

422
00:24:52,216 --> 00:24:53,473
Are you okay with that?

423
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:54,492
Of course.

424
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:56,309
We're in your hands.

425
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,162
Okay everybody, well...

426
00:24:59,406 --> 00:25:00,831
Let's get started!

427
00:25:03,911 --> 00:25:05,169
You ready?

434
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:47,878
I know this might be overkill,

435
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:51,440
But I'd hate to think we brought
any germs into this house.

436
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:53,609
You can't be too careful
nowadays.

437
00:25:53,627 --> 00:25:54,777
She may be a photographer,

438
00:25:54,795 --> 00:25:57,796
But she's a mom and
a grandmother first.

439
00:25:57,948 --> 00:25:58,781
Okay, okay.

440
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,226
I am... Finished.

441
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:04,044
I know, it's a little weird.

442
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,621
I appreciate it.

443
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:07,731
The last thing I want
is for maya to get sick.

444
00:26:07,883 --> 00:26:10,475
Especially while
daddy's out of town.

445
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:15,221
Taylor, do you mind if I use
your bathroom before we leave?

446
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,490
Yeah, of course.

447
00:26:21,972 --> 00:26:24,248
So, what happens next?

448
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:27,659
<i> I'll call you and</i>
<i> we can set a time</i>

449
00:26:27,812 --> 00:26:30,312

450
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:33,315
<i> But from what you saw</i>
<i> while you were taking them,</i>

451
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:35,317
<i> They looked good, right?</i>

452
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,760
They're great.

453
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:38,912
I'll just need to do a
little digital enhancing.

454
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,657
You know, play around
with color and shading.

455
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:43,934
So I'll need a
few days for that.

456
00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:47,012
But then I'll put it all
on a usb stick for you.

457
00:26:47,164 --> 00:26:50,332
And I'm guessing you'll want
some actual prints as well?

458
00:26:50,351 --> 00:26:51,609
Oh, definitely.

459
00:27:31,892 --> 00:27:32,983
She's sleepy.

460
00:27:33,135 --> 00:27:34,151
Yeah.

461
00:27:34,228 --> 00:27:36,545
It's about time for
the nap, isn't it?

462
00:27:36,563 --> 00:27:38,155
Maybe she's not cut out

463
00:27:38,232 --> 00:27:40,491
For the fast-paced,
modeling lifestyle.

464
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,160
Yeah, I got that.

465
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:44,495
So you'll call me?

466
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:48,724
Definitely, we'll see
each other soon.

467
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:49,750
Thank you, cathy.

468
00:27:51,745 --> 00:27:53,337
Thank you.

469
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:55,506
It was my pleasure.

470
00:27:55,582 --> 00:27:58,008
Don't forget what
you promised me.

471
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,843
Soon as I get my
website up and running,

472
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,179
I want maya to be
the face of it!

473
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,183
You have my word.

474
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:09,269
Night night, maya.

475
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:11,522
Bye bye.

476
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:13,524
-Nice meeting you.
-You too.

477
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:15,609
-Bye.
-See you.

478
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:20,197
<i> I'll believe it when</i>
<i> I see the pictures.</i>

479
00:28:20,348 --> 00:28:22,015
I've never heard of a
professional photographer

480
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,368
Giving away their work for free.

481
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:26,111
I already explained
all this to you.

482
00:28:26,263 --> 00:28:28,872
She's not really a professional.

483
00:28:29,024 --> 00:28:30,782
And she's not doing this

484
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:32,935
Just out of the goodness
of her heart.

485
00:28:32,953 --> 00:28:35,604
She wants to
build up her portfolio.

486
00:28:35,606 --> 00:28:37,548
Still.

487
00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:39,383
She's putting maya
on her website.

488
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,385
Front and center.

489
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:43,053
Yeah, you told me.

490
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,391
What?

491
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:49,226
Nothing, it's just...

492
00:28:49,377 --> 00:28:52,212
Didn't you say she
had a granddaughter?

493
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,230
Yeah.

494
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,903
Maybe she had too many photos
of her already.

495
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:07,302
I will say, it's been nice
having your company.

496
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:10,230
Tell me again why you
can't just quit your job

497
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,809
And come and stay with me
until dean gets back.

498
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:16,587
If I could, I would.
Believe me!

499
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,258
For real though,
you've been feeling okay?

500
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,929
You and dean,
between the two of you.

501
00:29:27,007 --> 00:29:28,932
Yes, I'm fine.

502
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:32,252
Hey, I'm just making sure.

503
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,753
I know you got
through it quickly,

504
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,607
But postpartum depression
is no joke.

505
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:39,943
And it can manifest itself
in a lot of ways.

506
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:42,354
I don't think
this was postpartum.

507
00:29:42,506 --> 00:29:46,283
I think it was just
good old-fashioned anxiety.

508
00:29:47,694 --> 00:29:50,788
That doesn't mean it
wasn't scary, though.

509
00:29:52,032 --> 00:29:55,017
I've freaked myself out
plenty of times.

510
00:29:55,035 --> 00:29:58,629
I mean, if I had a nickel for
every time I went to web md...

511
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,522
You could pay for a real doctor.

512
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:02,448
[giggles]

513
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:03,634
Yeah.

514
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,386
<i> This one might be my favorite.</i>

515
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:16,888
<i> It's almost like she's</i>
<i> posing for the camera.</i>

516
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:19,132
Like a little diva.

517
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,151
I don't know which one
is my favorite.

518
00:30:21,228 --> 00:30:24,154
You weren't kidding,
they're all amazing.

519
00:30:24,306 --> 00:30:26,824
I might have picked up a
few tricks over the years.

520
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:28,550
Cathy, when people see these,

521
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:31,311
Your business is
going to take off.

522
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,072
Well, from your lips
to god's ears!

523
00:30:34,224 --> 00:30:36,316
Now remember, I'm giving
you all the files.

524
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,726
So if you ever want to go back

525
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:40,228
And print out any more,
then you have them.

526
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:42,989
Cathy, I don't
even know what to say.

527
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,825
This is so incredibly generous.

528
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:49,162
People would pay a small fortune
for a set like this.

529
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,997
Just spread the word.

530
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,684
That's all the thanks I need.

531
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:56,854
So have you decided which ones
you want me to print out?

532
00:30:58,006 --> 00:30:59,022
All of them!

533
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,437
When did you say your husband
is coming home again?

534
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:07,197
Uh, a week from today.

535
00:31:07,274 --> 00:31:08,590
Why?

536
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:10,926
I was just thinking
about the timing of it.

537
00:31:10,944 --> 00:31:12,035
You know, if I...

538
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:13,353
But I should be fine.

539
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,205
I'll be able to print
them out before then.

540
00:31:15,282 --> 00:31:18,375
Some of these would look great
in black and white, too.

541
00:31:18,452 --> 00:31:20,360
Is that possible?

542
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,879
Anything is possible.

543
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:25,299
I don't know I
can ever repay you.

544
00:31:40,474 --> 00:31:42,900
Okay, that's enough of that.

545
00:31:46,146 --> 00:31:47,404
Oh yeah?

546
00:31:57,808 --> 00:32:00,334
Okay, come on sweetie.

547
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:15,390
Okay, yeah.

548
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,603
Good night, girl.

549
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:51,259
Sweet dreams...

550
00:34:41,822 --> 00:34:42,746
Hi...

551
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:49,377
My precious...

552
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:54,883
I'll take such good care of you.

553
00:35:00,324 --> 00:35:03,058
Shhh... You're going to be okay.

554
00:35:13,003 --> 00:35:14,569
<i> [door shuts]</i>

555
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:38,593
What the hell?

556
00:35:43,216 --> 00:35:44,099
Oh my god!

557
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:55,735
It's okay baby, I'm coming.

558
00:35:57,805 --> 00:35:59,156
It's okay, maya.

559
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:10,500
[screaming]

560
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,967
[crying out]

561
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:44,868
There's no sign of forced entry,
mrs. Lewis.

562
00:36:44,945 --> 00:36:46,369
Just like the other night.

563
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:48,613
There's no sign that anybody
was ever here.

564
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:51,190
Except now my baby is gone!

565
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,692
Why can't you just go find her?

566
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,118
Mrs. Lewis, I know you're upset.

567
00:36:54,271 --> 00:36:55,194
I really do.

568
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:57,605
This is a terrible situation.

569
00:36:57,624 --> 00:36:59,365
But you need to trust me.

570
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,884
There's nothing
more important right now

571
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:03,869
Than you telling me
everything you know.

572
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,388
Okay.

573
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,058
Now, let me ask you again,

574
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:10,785
There's no one you know
who would want to hurt you?

575
00:37:10,804 --> 00:37:12,637
Enemies you may have made?

576
00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:17,475
Enemies?
No, I don't have any enemies.

577
00:37:17,627 --> 00:37:19,051
What about your husband?

578
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,980
Are there any people he may have
had a business dispute with?

579
00:37:22,132 --> 00:37:23,965
Not that I know of.

580
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:25,575
Did you work before
having your daughter?

581
00:37:25,652 --> 00:37:27,635
Yes, I worked at a
small marketing firm.

582
00:37:27,654 --> 00:37:30,488
But everyone there
pretty much got along there.

583
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,731
I just...

584
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,209
I don't understand
why anyone would do this.

585
00:37:36,146 --> 00:37:37,570
What about fingerprints?

586
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,089
We're still dusting for them.

587
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:41,833
But assuming the person
left any,

588
00:37:41,985 --> 00:37:43,485
That they didn't wear gloves,

589
00:37:43,503 --> 00:37:45,653
It's going to take some time
to match them against your own.

590
00:37:45,655 --> 00:37:48,932
Plus anyone else who has
recently been in the house.

591
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,512
Mrs. Lewis, what is it?

592
00:37:54,664 --> 00:37:56,231
I know who did this.

593
00:37:57,851 --> 00:38:01,503
Last week, we met
this woman in the park.

594
00:38:01,521 --> 00:38:03,021
A photographer.

595
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:06,449
And she came here and she
took photos of maya.

596
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:09,101
Okay.

597
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,029
Okay, well she must have maya!

598
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:12,938
So why don't you go
and talk to her?

599
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,457
Go and talk to her, right now!

600
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:15,959
Okay, we will.

601
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,353
Just calm down, we will,
I promise.

602
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:20,705
Now, this woman, you
have her name, I assume?

603
00:38:20,857 --> 00:38:23,300
Yes, yes, it's cathy driver.

604
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,210
Spelled like it sounds?

605
00:38:26,363 --> 00:38:27,304
I think so.

606
00:38:30,534 --> 00:38:31,975
What makes you think
she took your daughter?

607
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:33,310
Because she's the
only one that's been here.

608
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:36,220
And she's the only person
that I don't know.

609
00:38:36,373 --> 00:38:38,964
And yet you let her
into your home?

610
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,317
She said she was a photographer.

611
00:38:40,393 --> 00:38:42,301
I'm sure you've let people
into your house.

612
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:44,712
I mean plumbers, electricians...

613
00:38:44,731 --> 00:38:47,549
But why do you think this
woman wanted your daughter?

614
00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:49,067
I don't know.

615
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:50,902
She has a daughter of her own.

616
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:52,478
The daughter came here
to help her.

617
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:56,074
She even has a granddaughter.

618
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:58,226
This doesn't make any sense.

619
00:38:58,244 --> 00:39:00,895
Do you know where
this cathy driver lives?

620
00:39:00,914 --> 00:39:04,082
No, I had her card, but
I don't know where it is.

621
00:39:04,234 --> 00:39:06,509
It's okay, we can find out.

622
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:08,845
In the meantime, I think
what makes the most sense

623
00:39:08,922 --> 00:39:10,513
Is if I paid her a visit.

624
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:11,681
Okay.

625
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:14,909
What do I do?

626
00:39:14,911 --> 00:39:16,669
You stay here in case
anyone calls

627
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,913
With any additional information.

628
00:39:18,915 --> 00:39:22,192
And in the meantime,
if you think of anything else,

629
00:39:22,268 --> 00:39:26,254
No matter how insignificant,
you call me.

630
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:28,031
I have to call my husband.

631
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:33,261
And if you have any friends
that you can call.

632
00:39:33,263 --> 00:39:34,779
I don't think it
would be a bad idea

633
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:36,623
For you to have some company.

634
00:40:06,646 --> 00:40:07,979
I don't understand.

635
00:40:08,131 --> 00:40:09,814
There's no flights
for three days?

636
00:40:09,966 --> 00:40:12,316
What kind of
weather delay is that?

637
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:13,576
They say there's an ice storm

638
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:15,803
Coming down from
the arctic circle.

639
00:40:15,822 --> 00:40:17,897
No planes in or out.

640
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,565
He's talking to our consulate

641
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,325
To see if there's anything
they can do.

642
00:40:21,478 --> 00:40:24,087
And in the meantime, his company

643
00:40:24,164 --> 00:40:26,831
Is trying to get him home
through copenhagen.

644
00:40:26,983 --> 00:40:28,407
Don't worry, taylor.

645
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:31,502
He'll be here as soon as he can.

646
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:33,821
By then it might be too late.

647
00:40:33,823 --> 00:40:36,099
Hey, look at me.

648
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,919
Maya is going to be fine.

649
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,180
How do you know that?

650
00:40:42,332 --> 00:40:45,349
Because I know in my heart
we will find her.

651
00:40:45,502 --> 00:40:47,259
I don't know why she took maya,

652
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:49,595
But there's definitely a reason.

653
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,865
She doesn't want to hurt her.

654
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:57,102
How about I make you some tea?

655
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,530
I can't stomach anything.

656
00:40:59,683 --> 00:41:02,792
Besides, detective gallagher
should be here soon.

657
00:41:02,944 --> 00:41:06,087
Okay, I'll put the
kettle on just in case.

658
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,142
<i> [camera snap]</i>

659
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,432
Did you find cathy driver?

660
00:42:08,585 --> 00:42:09,341
Mmm-hmm.

661
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:11,010
Okay, what did she say?

662
00:42:11,938 --> 00:42:14,697
She said she's never
seen you before in her life.

663
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:19,093
What?

664
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:20,428
She says she's
never seen you before.

665
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,039
Or even heard of you.

666
00:42:23,116 --> 00:42:24,782
I don't understand.

667
00:42:24,934 --> 00:42:26,191
I asked her about the park.

668
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,769
About her coming to your home.

669
00:42:27,787 --> 00:42:30,529
The baby photos, all of it.

670
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:31,881
And what did she say then?

671
00:42:32,033 --> 00:42:33,675
She denied all of it.

672
00:42:35,628 --> 00:42:37,220
How is that possible?

673
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:39,538
There's only one way.

674
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,307
Someone must be lying.

675
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:45,453
Well it's her, obviously!

676
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:47,379
Can't you see that?

677
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,315
My baby is somewhere!

678
00:42:50,718 --> 00:42:52,960
Can't you go arrest her?

679
00:42:52,979 --> 00:42:54,720
And make her talk?

680
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,556
You see, mrs. Lewis,
that's where we have a problem.

681
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:00,301
There's just no evidence
to support what you told us.

682
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,819
None at all.

683
00:43:01,971 --> 00:43:03,471
I'm not saying I
don't believe you,

684
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:04,972
But I am saying
we can't just go in

685
00:43:04,991 --> 00:43:07,642
And grab mrs. Driver
with no evidence.

686
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,901
Okay, you were in her house.

687
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,478
You must have found something.

688
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,570
We went through the darkroom.

689
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,405
She let us look at her computer.

690
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,483
There's no pictures that look
like the one

691
00:43:15,501 --> 00:43:16,667
You gave me of maya.

692
00:43:16,744 --> 00:43:18,986
Okay, then she must
have deleted everything!

693
00:43:19,005 --> 00:43:21,431
Then there's the
biggest issue of all.

694
00:43:21,507 --> 00:43:24,175
There's just no sign of a baby.

695
00:43:24,327 --> 00:43:26,494
Then she must have
brought her somewhere.

696
00:43:26,496 --> 00:43:28,771
Maybe to her daughter's house.

697
00:43:28,848 --> 00:43:32,257
I'm sure her daughter
is on it as well!

698
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:35,002
Taylor, you're exhausted.

699
00:43:35,021 --> 00:43:37,429
Why don't you go
and get some rest, okay?

700
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:40,358
And I'll talk to
detective gallagher.

701
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,535
I think that's a good idea.

702
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,015
Mrs. Lewis, I promise you,

703
00:43:48,034 --> 00:43:50,109
We're going to do everything
we can to find her.

704
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,045
We're not going to stop looking.

705
00:43:58,378 --> 00:43:59,469
It's okay.

706
00:44:08,888 --> 00:44:11,296
How well do you know mrs. Lewis?

707
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:12,815
She's my best friend.

708
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:15,300
I've known her for years,
since college.

709
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,654
And she's never been one
to embellish things?

710
00:44:17,805 --> 00:44:18,655
To make things up?

711
00:44:18,806 --> 00:44:20,381
Come on, detective.

712
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,235
You can't actually think that
taylor is making this up?

713
00:44:24,387 --> 00:44:26,663
I mean, if that were true,
where's maya?

714
00:44:28,408 --> 00:44:30,391
I'll level with you, miss walsh.

715
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,168
There are three kinds
of these cases.

716
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,230
The most common, an estranged
spouse kidnaps the child.

717
00:44:36,249 --> 00:44:38,991
The rarest is what
mrs. Lewis claims,

718
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,678
A stranger kidnapped her baby.

719
00:44:41,754 --> 00:44:43,096
And what's the other one?

720
00:44:47,427 --> 00:44:49,093
Oh my god.

721
00:44:49,245 --> 00:44:53,505
You can't think?
I mean, you can't believe?

722
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:55,507
Taylor loves her daughter.

723
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:57,752
Unfortunately,
I've seen it before.

724
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,254
More times than
I'd like to remember.

725
00:45:00,273 --> 00:45:01,923
But you met taylor.

726
00:45:01,941 --> 00:45:05,201
Does she look like someone
who could hurt her own baby?

727
00:45:09,115 --> 00:45:10,289
What is it?

728
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:12,934
Nothing, it's not relevant.

729
00:45:12,952 --> 00:45:16,103
Miss walsh, right now
everything is relevant.

730
00:45:16,122 --> 00:45:17,362
Now, if you're not willing to--

731
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,531
She had postpartum depression.

732
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:21,033
Pretty bad right
at the beginning.

733
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,553
But taylor is fine now.

734
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,557
We're going to keep
looking into her story.

735
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:28,783
But at this point,

736
00:45:28,785 --> 00:45:30,952
We're gonna keep all
our options open.

737
00:45:30,954 --> 00:45:32,353
All our options.

738
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:46,968
Are the police still here?

739
00:45:46,986 --> 00:45:48,995
A few are still outside,
but they're almost done.

740
00:45:50,656 --> 00:45:53,583
The detective,
he doesn't believe me, does he?

741
00:45:55,995 --> 00:45:57,879
I think he does, actually.

742
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:00,998
But he's a cop.

743
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,484
They need to consider
every possibility.

744
00:46:03,503 --> 00:46:05,319
But we're losing precious time!

745
00:46:05,338 --> 00:46:06,654
I know.

746
00:46:06,656 --> 00:46:08,598
And that's why I'm here to help.

747
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:10,600
You and I, we're
not going to stop

748
00:46:10,676 --> 00:46:13,677
Until we get maya
back safe and sound.

749
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:14,996
Thanks, linds.

750
00:46:15,999 --> 00:46:18,733
But right now, you need
to get some rest.

751
00:46:20,003 --> 00:46:21,669
Come on.

752
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:24,530
With maya gone, I could never
sleep, you know that.

753
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:27,909
Then let's get to work.

754
00:46:35,943 --> 00:46:37,460
I got you...

755
00:46:38,855 --> 00:46:40,963
Skylar driver.

756
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,048
I got you.

757
00:46:45,044 --> 00:46:47,136
Linds, linds wake up!

758
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:49,263
I'm up.

759
00:46:51,868 --> 00:46:53,384
What'd you find?

760
00:46:53,536 --> 00:46:56,370
It's what I didn't find
at first.

761
00:46:56,389 --> 00:46:58,205
For hours, I looked online

762
00:46:58,207 --> 00:47:02,801
And I couldn't find anything
about cathy or skylar driver.

763
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:04,895
Maybe that's not
their real names?

764
00:47:05,048 --> 00:47:05,988
No.

765
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,882
The cops went to their house.

766
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,474
Plus, I found them.

767
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:12,736
In the white pages and on
the tax assessment website.

768
00:47:12,889 --> 00:47:14,221
I hear a "but" coming up.

769
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,892
But that's literally all
I could find about them.

770
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:20,336
They have zero
social media presence.

771
00:47:20,487 --> 00:47:22,821
Is that really that odd?

772
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:24,823
Maybe not for a
middle aged woman,

773
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:26,658
But for someone
like her daughter?

774
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:29,570
In her twenties,
who just had a baby?

775
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:31,238
It's practically impossible.

776
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,923
Plus, the mother, cathy.

777
00:47:33,076 --> 00:47:35,910
What type of photographer,
even an amateur,

778
00:47:35,928 --> 00:47:38,503
Doesn't blanket the web
with their work?

779
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:39,930
So what are you saying?

780
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:42,191
What I'm saying
is that these two

781
00:47:42,268 --> 00:47:44,360
Made a deliberate
effort not to reveal

782
00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:46,087
Anything about themselves.

783
00:47:46,105 --> 00:47:47,846
Unless they couldn't prevent it

784
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:50,257
Because it's in
the public record.

785
00:47:50,276 --> 00:47:51,868
Okay, I'll buy it.

786
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:53,119
But then...

787
00:47:55,098 --> 00:47:56,205
Look at this.

788
00:47:57,709 --> 00:47:59,876
Skylar driver, that's her?

789
00:48:00,027 --> 00:48:01,452
Absolutely, a hundred percent.

790
00:48:01,604 --> 00:48:02,879
When's this from?

791
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:04,271
A couple months ago.

792
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:07,108
She looks exactly the same.

793
00:48:07,126 --> 00:48:08,609
A staffing company?

794
00:48:08,628 --> 00:48:09,627
I looked it up.

795
00:48:09,779 --> 00:48:12,889
They do mainly medical
and tech fields.

796
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,039
Near here?

797
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,726
Twenty minutes away
without traffic.

798
00:48:16,877 --> 00:48:18,135
We're heading over?

799
00:48:18,287 --> 00:48:20,730
First thing in the morning,
as soon as they open.

800
00:48:41,994 --> 00:48:43,544
[car doors shut]

801
00:48:56,509 --> 00:48:57,825
Hi.

802
00:48:57,827 --> 00:48:59,936
Hi ladies, how may I help you?

803
00:49:00,012 --> 00:49:02,271
We're here to speak
with ellen mckay.

804
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:05,516
We don't have an appointment.

805
00:49:05,668 --> 00:49:08,778
It's extremely important
that we speak to her.

806
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:11,596
I'll see what I can do.

807
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:13,507
We appreciate it.

808
00:49:13,526 --> 00:49:15,534
Tell her it's
regarding skylar driver.

809
00:49:17,863 --> 00:49:19,455
I'll let her know.

810
00:49:35,381 --> 00:49:37,223
Ms. Mckay will see you now.

811
00:49:42,629 --> 00:49:44,205
That's her all right.

812
00:49:44,223 --> 00:49:46,298
Just like the caption says.

813
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,375
That's skylar driver.

814
00:49:48,394 --> 00:49:53,063
But you can't tell us how
long ago she worked here?

815
00:49:53,216 --> 00:49:55,216
All I can tell you
is that she's no longer

816
00:49:55,234 --> 00:49:57,142
An employee of this company.

817
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:02,164
Can you tell me if she left,
or if she was let go?

818
00:50:02,316 --> 00:50:06,560
I'm sorry, can you tell me again
why you can't go to the police?

819
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:09,154
We've been to the police
and they're working on it.

820
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:12,066
But they don't have the time
to chase down every lead.

821
00:50:12,084 --> 00:50:14,659
Look, I'd like to help you.

822
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:15,903
I really would.

823
00:50:15,905 --> 00:50:16,920
But I'm prevented by law

824
00:50:17,073 --> 00:50:19,073
From divulging any
of this information.

825
00:50:19,091 --> 00:50:21,434
Unless of course,
you have a subpoena.

826
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:25,271
Do you have kids?

827
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,509
A boy and a girl.

828
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,361
Both in college right now.

829
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,450
Can you imagine if something
happened to them, ms. Mckay?

830
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:43,264
Look, I really
can't tell you anything.

831
00:50:43,282 --> 00:50:45,766
I could lose my job.

832
00:50:45,785 --> 00:50:47,768
And this is a good company.

833
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:53,174
The kind of place that people
don't usually leave voluntarily.

834
00:50:56,445 --> 00:51:01,039
I'm sorry you couldn't
be more of help, ms. Mckay.

835
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:03,726
But I do appreciate your time.

836
00:51:15,055 --> 00:51:16,697
She's beautiful.

837
00:51:21,654 --> 00:51:23,746
You know, she has your eyes.

838
00:51:23,897 --> 00:51:25,247
You think?

839
00:51:25,324 --> 00:51:26,415
For sure.

840
00:51:28,644 --> 00:51:29,585
I hope so.

841
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:33,089
Mom?

842
00:51:35,668 --> 00:51:37,551
We did the right thing,
didn't we?

843
00:51:39,322 --> 00:51:41,597
Sweetheart, of course we did.

844
00:51:43,676 --> 00:51:47,995
We couldn't let this little
angel stay with that woman.

845
00:51:47,997 --> 00:51:49,105
But...

846
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:54,110
She seemed like she was
taking care good care of her.

847
00:51:55,688 --> 00:51:58,114
At least she did when
we were at their house.

848
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:05,621
And you know that's
what someone might have

849
00:52:05,772 --> 00:52:08,682
Once said about
your biological mother.

850
00:52:09,685 --> 00:52:12,419
Can you imagine if I had
left you with her?

851
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,360
Okay, so we know
that skylar driver

852
00:52:19,378 --> 00:52:22,138
Is involved somehow,
it's not just the crazy mother.

853
00:52:22,214 --> 00:52:23,530
You're sure?

854
00:52:23,549 --> 00:52:25,549
I mean come on,
you heard the same thing I did.

855
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:27,201
I heard that she was let go.

856
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:28,644
We don't even know why.

857
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:30,980
But taylor, it's a long ways
from getting fired

858
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:32,606
To kidnapping a child.

859
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,560
It's too much of a coincidence.

860
00:52:36,712 --> 00:52:39,822
She gets fired from her job
right before all this happens?

861
00:52:39,899 --> 00:52:42,716
No, it has to be connected.

862
00:52:42,735 --> 00:52:44,493
So what should we do now?

863
00:52:44,645 --> 00:52:46,328
Go back to the police?

864
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,554
Not without more information.

865
00:52:47,573 --> 00:52:50,891
I mean, they already
don't trust me.

866
00:52:50,893 --> 00:52:52,501
I can only imagine
what they'll do

867
00:52:52,578 --> 00:52:55,504
If I accuse additional people
without proof.

868
00:52:58,417 --> 00:52:59,508
Okay.

869
00:53:01,995 --> 00:53:02,903
What will we--

870
00:53:02,922 --> 00:53:04,013
[banging on the window]
[scream]

871
00:53:04,164 --> 00:53:06,423
I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

872
00:53:06,575 --> 00:53:07,666
I overheard you
talking to ellen.

873
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,018
Can I get in?

874
00:53:12,431 --> 00:53:13,480
Okay.

875
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:19,920
I'm jess.

876
00:53:19,939 --> 00:53:22,423
-Lindsay.
-Taylor lewis.

877
00:53:22,425 --> 00:53:24,366
I'm so sorry to hear
about your baby.

878
00:53:24,443 --> 00:53:25,659
I really am.

879
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:29,371
What can you tell us, jess?

880
00:53:29,523 --> 00:53:32,766
Well, it might be nothing.

881
00:53:32,768 --> 00:53:35,102
On the other hand, if I could
help you find your daughter.

882
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,379
I couldn't live with myself
if I didn't say anything.

883
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:40,532
But you didn't hear
from me, okay?

884
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:43,277
Technically, I'm bound
by confidentiality as well.

885
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,387
You can trust us.

886
00:53:46,115 --> 00:53:49,466
Okay well, skylar
was fired from here.

887
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,728
But before that, I worked
quite close with her.

888
00:53:54,473 --> 00:53:57,066
In fact, I was probably
her best friend at the company.

889
00:53:58,477 --> 00:54:00,461
So what happened to her?

890
00:54:00,479 --> 00:54:03,239
Skylar, she wanted a baby.

891
00:54:03,315 --> 00:54:07,576
In fact, I never met anyone who
wanted a baby more than she did.

892
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,579
And when she couldn't
get pregnant, it ate her up.

893
00:54:11,991 --> 00:54:13,249
You know she became...

894
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,085
Obsessive.

895
00:54:16,236 --> 00:54:20,147
The desire to have a baby
literally began to consume her.

896
00:54:20,165 --> 00:54:21,982
And eventually,
her husband left.

897
00:54:22,001 --> 00:54:23,484
He simply couldn't
take it anymore.

898
00:54:23,502 --> 00:54:26,411
And work, work was understanding
for as long as possible.

899
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,747
But eventually, they had
to let her go, too.

900
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:29,823
She'd get nothing done.

901
00:54:29,842 --> 00:54:32,009
She'd just sit at her desk
all day,

902
00:54:32,161 --> 00:54:33,936
Looking at mommy blogs.

903
00:54:34,087 --> 00:54:37,422
So after she was fired,
what happened to her?

904
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,775
Well like I said,
she was only a work friend.

905
00:54:39,926 --> 00:54:43,353
I didn't really keep in touch.

906
00:54:43,506 --> 00:54:46,507
Do you happen to know
where she lives?

907
00:54:46,525 --> 00:54:48,617
I don't know the address,
but I can show you on a map.

908
00:54:48,694 --> 00:54:50,577
I mean, if she
still lives there.

909
00:55:01,874 --> 00:55:03,966
So this is it?

910
00:55:04,117 --> 00:55:06,468
It looks just like jess
described it.

911
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,363
What do you think?

912
00:55:09,381 --> 00:55:12,123
Go right to the front door,
try to catch her off guard?

913
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:14,643
No, if she sees me
she won't answer.

914
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,145
Especially if maya's inside.

915
00:55:17,222 --> 00:55:19,815
Okay, then what's the plan?

916
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,339
Does it look like
anyone is home?

917
00:55:43,415 --> 00:55:45,674
We should probably try
to get a closer look.

918
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:02,524
See anything?

919
00:56:03,602 --> 00:56:06,177
No, it's too dark.

920
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:08,530
Doesn't look like
there's anyone home, though.

921
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,184
Let's get out of here.

922
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:15,537
We're not going to find anything
by spying on an empty house.

923
00:56:15,614 --> 00:56:17,931
Think we should try and
talk with the neighbors?

924
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,433
See if they know anything?

925
00:56:19,451 --> 00:56:20,934
No.

926
00:56:20,953 --> 00:56:22,269
At this point I should probably
check in with the police.

927
00:56:22,287 --> 00:56:25,381
Fill them in on what we
found out about skylar.

928
00:56:25,532 --> 00:56:27,274
You want me to come?

929
00:56:27,292 --> 00:56:28,717
No.

930
00:56:28,794 --> 00:56:32,221
I think I should talk to
detective gallagher alone.

931
00:56:32,297 --> 00:56:33,614
Besides, I'm sure
you're exhausted.

932
00:56:33,632 --> 00:56:36,617
You should go home
and get some rest.

933
00:56:36,619 --> 00:56:37,801
Okay.

934
00:56:37,953 --> 00:56:39,395
But if you need me,

935
00:56:39,471 --> 00:56:43,214
I don't care what time it is,
you call me right away.

936
00:56:43,234 --> 00:56:44,641
You got that?

937
00:56:44,793 --> 00:56:46,068
I do.

938
00:56:46,145 --> 00:56:47,628
Thank you.

939
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:50,406
Come on.
Let's get you home.

940
00:56:50,482 --> 00:56:52,574
It ooks like it's gonna
rain again.

941
00:56:59,158 --> 00:57:00,398
Oh my god!

942
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:01,642
Skylar, look!

943
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,252
What's wrong?

944
00:57:03,328 --> 00:57:05,379
Taylor, she's here.

945
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:11,260
Don't let her see you,
just turn this way.

946
00:57:40,516 --> 00:57:41,790
Did they see us?

947
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:44,293
No.

948
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:49,465
How'd they find us
so quickly, mom?

949
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:57,030
[sobbing]

950
00:57:57,049 --> 00:57:58,548
If they're looking for us,

951
00:57:58,701 --> 00:58:00,309
That means the cops
didn't believe them.

952
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,478
But how'd they find our house?

953
00:58:02,629 --> 00:58:04,371
I checked every search engine.

954
00:58:04,373 --> 00:58:06,148
That information isn't anywhere.

955
00:58:06,299 --> 00:58:07,816
I don't know, honey.

956
00:58:07,893 --> 00:58:10,227
I don't know, but right now,

957
00:58:10,379 --> 00:58:11,820
We have the advantage.

958
00:58:13,565 --> 00:58:14,490
Okay?

959
00:58:17,569 --> 00:58:19,828
I want to see what
they're up to.

960
00:58:21,982 --> 00:58:22,998
Follow them?

961
00:58:24,743 --> 00:58:28,128
I won't get too close,
I promise.

962
00:58:30,082 --> 00:58:31,632
We'll be fine.

963
00:58:41,593 --> 00:58:45,020
After all,
they're looking for us.

964
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:48,857
Shhh... Shhh...

965
00:58:50,677 --> 00:58:51,985
Look at me.

966
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:43,704
What now?

967
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:46,915
We follow the friend.

968
00:59:46,992 --> 00:59:49,084
I want to know who she is.

969
00:59:50,737 --> 00:59:52,421
You sure you don't want me
to come with you

970
00:59:52,497 --> 00:59:53,422
To the station?

971
00:59:53,573 --> 00:59:55,239
No, it's okay.
You should go home.

972
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:56,407
Okay.

973
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:57,818
But I'll call you first
thing tomorrow.

974
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:59,152
We'll go out again
looking for them.

975
00:59:59,171 --> 01:00:00,487
I appreciate it, linds.

976
01:00:00,505 --> 01:00:03,265
But I understand you have work.

977
01:00:03,342 --> 01:00:06,676
It's time for the police
to start doing their jobs.

978
01:00:06,829 --> 01:00:07,828
Hey!

979
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:09,846
Don't you worry about work,
okay?

980
01:00:09,998 --> 01:00:12,441
I told you, I'm with you
until the end.

981
01:00:12,592 --> 01:00:16,002
I'm going to be right by
your side when we find maya.

982
01:00:16,004 --> 01:00:17,946
And we will find her.

983
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,617
I love you.

984
01:00:21,768 --> 01:00:22,951
I love you, too.

985
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:31,960
After this, I'll
take you home okay?

986
01:00:32,037 --> 01:00:33,962
You can be with
your beautiful daughter.

987
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:36,781
What are you going to do?

988
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,617
I need to find out how
much they know about us.

989
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:42,362
What they told the police.

990
01:00:42,364 --> 01:00:45,198
But taylor knows who you are.

991
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,200
What if she sees you?

992
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:49,703
Don't worry sweetie, okay?

993
01:00:49,705 --> 01:00:52,463
Mommy's going to fix everything.

994
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:53,649
Okay?

995
01:00:55,394 --> 01:00:57,486
Mommy's going to fix everything.

996
01:01:04,903 --> 01:01:06,995
Okay, let's go. Come on!

997
01:01:13,912 --> 01:01:16,154
That's all very interesting,
mrs. Lewis,

998
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:18,899
But I wish you'd leave
the investigating to us.

999
01:01:18,901 --> 01:01:20,825
My daughter is missing,
detective.

1000
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:23,904
And I'm going to do anything
I can to get her back.

1001
01:01:23,922 --> 01:01:25,422
And with all due respect,

1002
01:01:25,574 --> 01:01:27,182
I haven't seen your department
doing too much investigating.

1003
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:29,167
We've already put out
an alert for your daughter

1004
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,520
And distributed photographs to
all nearby police departments.

1005
01:01:31,671 --> 01:01:34,338
What you should be doing
is finding skylar driver.

1006
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:36,841
So first it's cathy driver,
now it's her daughter?

1007
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:37,842
Exactly!

1008
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,102
But didn't you
originally tell me

1009
01:01:39,254 --> 01:01:40,862
That skylar driver
had her own daughter?

1010
01:01:40,939 --> 01:01:42,364
Why would she kidnap yours?

1011
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:43,940
Have you not been
listening to anything

1012
01:01:44,092 --> 01:01:45,516
I've been telling you?

1013
01:01:45,536 --> 01:01:48,186
According to her co-worker,
skylar couldn't get pregnant!

1014
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:50,539
Well, maybe she got pregnant
and didn't tell anybody.

1015
01:01:50,615 --> 01:01:52,933
Maybe she adopted.

1016
01:01:52,951 --> 01:01:55,602
There's plenty of ways to have
a baby without kidnapping one.

1017
01:01:55,604 --> 01:01:57,546
Then where's my daughter,
detective?

1018
01:01:58,716 --> 01:02:00,623
You tell me, where's maya?

1019
01:02:00,776 --> 01:02:03,552
That's what I'm trying
to figure out, mrs. Lewis.

1020
01:02:06,114 --> 01:02:08,181
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

1021
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:15,063
<i> [phone ringing]</i>

1022
01:02:16,308 --> 01:02:17,381
Hey linds.

1023
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:19,142
How did it go?

1024
01:02:19,294 --> 01:02:20,477
He's not going to be any help.

1025
01:02:20,629 --> 01:02:23,146
He completely dismissed
everything we discovered.

1026
01:02:23,298 --> 01:02:26,057
And worst of all,
I can't tell

1027
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,559
If he thinks I'm crazy
or if I'm a suspect!

1028
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,303
You're not crazy.

1029
01:02:30,305 --> 01:02:31,580
We'll figure this out.

1030
01:02:33,325 --> 01:02:35,642
We'll start again
first thing tomorrow.

1031
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,043
Get some sleep.

1032
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,600
<i> [doorbell rings]</i>

1033
01:02:54,254 --> 01:02:55,228
Yes?

1034
01:02:56,832 --> 01:02:57,847
Lindsay walsh?

1035
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,274
Yes.

1036
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:02,502
Hi there, I'm detective
cindy winters.

1037
01:03:02,504 --> 01:03:04,613
I work with jim,
detective gallagher.

1038
01:03:04,764 --> 01:03:06,430
Do you mind if I speak with you
for a moment?

1039
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,341
Come in.

1040
01:03:08,343 --> 01:03:09,359
Thank you, miss walsh.

1041
01:03:09,511 --> 01:03:11,344
Please, call me lindsay.

1042
01:03:11,346 --> 01:03:12,788
Can I get you
something to drink?

1043
01:03:12,939 --> 01:03:14,456
Water, soda?

1044
01:03:14,607 --> 01:03:16,349
I can make coffee if you'd like?

1045
01:03:16,351 --> 01:03:18,126
No, I just had dinner.

1046
01:03:18,203 --> 01:03:19,127
Thank you.

1047
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:25,801
I assume you don't
have any good news?

1048
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,303
I'm afraid not.

1049
01:03:30,532 --> 01:03:32,623
I would never ask this
in front of taylor,

1050
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:36,536
But is it true that
if the child isn't found

1051
01:03:36,555 --> 01:03:39,481
Within the first 48 hours,

1052
01:03:39,558 --> 01:03:42,150
Well, the prospects
aren't so good?

1053
01:03:42,227 --> 01:03:43,543
Well, we're not there yet.

1054
01:03:43,545 --> 01:03:46,154
So let's try to
keep an open mind.

1055
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:50,808
Did you speak to taylor today
when she went to the station?

1056
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:52,719
Uh no, I didn't.

1057
01:03:52,721 --> 01:03:54,663
I was working on something else.

1058
01:03:54,814 --> 01:03:55,997
That's why I came
to speak to you.

1059
01:03:56,149 --> 01:03:58,983
Jim, detective gallagher,
wanted me to.

1060
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:01,670
He said you and mrs. Lewis

1061
01:04:01,746 --> 01:04:04,822
Had discovered something
very interesting.

1062
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:07,901
Well, I have to be honest,
we thought we did.

1063
01:04:07,903 --> 01:04:09,569
But according to taylor,

1064
01:04:09,571 --> 01:04:11,847
Detective gallagher
didn't agree.

1065
01:04:19,431 --> 01:04:20,689
Between you and me...

1066
01:04:22,342 --> 01:04:25,919
Detective gallagher can get
a little stuck in his ways,

1067
01:04:25,921 --> 01:04:27,863
So why don't you try me?

1068
01:04:29,682 --> 01:04:33,093
Well, the main thing
we found out

1069
01:04:33,111 --> 01:04:36,371
Is where cathy driver's daughter
used to work.

1070
01:04:36,448 --> 01:04:39,541
We spoke to a former
co-worker of hers.

1071
01:04:39,618 --> 01:04:42,878
And it turns out skylar driver
didn't have a kid.

1072
01:04:47,292 --> 01:04:50,610
I was under the assumption
that she had a daughter.

1073
01:04:50,629 --> 01:04:52,036
That's what we thought.

1074
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:54,389
That's what she and
her mother told taylor.

1075
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:57,392
But according to the coworker,
this wasn't true.

1076
01:04:57,469 --> 01:05:00,896
Skylar wanted a baby,
but she never had one.

1077
01:05:04,126 --> 01:05:05,125
Crazy.

1078
01:05:05,143 --> 01:05:07,551
I know, tell me about it.

1079
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:11,722
And did you tell all of this
to detective gallagher?

1080
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:13,408
Taylor did, yeah.

1081
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,078
Didn't he tell you that?

1082
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:22,492
I'm sorry lindsay, to make you
go through all of this again.

1083
01:05:22,644 --> 01:05:24,160
I know it's frustrating.

1086
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:31,927
So tell me, did you
find anything at the house?

1087
01:05:32,078 --> 01:05:35,321
No, we just looked
around the outside.

1088
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,323
But it didn't look
like anyone was there.

1089
01:05:37,325 --> 01:05:39,768
So then taylor, umm...

1090
01:05:42,347 --> 01:05:44,272
Detective winters,

1091
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:47,943
How did you know we went
to skylar driver's house?

1092
01:05:49,854 --> 01:05:54,765
Oh, well detective gallagher
told me, of course.

1093
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:56,600
Please continue, go on.

1094
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,602
You know what...

1095
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:01,456
Do you mind if I use
your bathroom?

1096
01:06:01,533 --> 01:06:02,515

We follow the friend.

01:08:00,726 --> 01:08:02,393
No, it's okay.
You should go home.

1106
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:03,561
Okay.

1107
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,971
But I'll call you first
thing tomorrow.

1108
01:08:04,973 --> 01:08:06,306
We'll go out again
looking for them.

1109

I appreciate it, linds.

1110
01:08:07,659 --> 01:08:10,418
But I understand you have work.

1111
01:08:10,495 --> 01:08:13,830
It's time for the police
to start doing their jobs.

I'm going to be right by
your side when we find maya.

1116
01:08:23,158 --> 01:08:25,100
And we will find her.

1117
01:08:26,752 --> 01:08:28,770
I love you.

1118
01:08:28,921 --> 01:08:30,105
I love you, too.

1119
01:08:36,004 --> 01:08:39,114
After this, I'll
take you home okay?

1120
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:41,116
You can be with
your beautiful daughter.

1121
01:08:41,192 --> 01:08:43,934
What are you going to do?

1122
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:46,770
I need to find out how
much they know about us.

1123
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,515
What they told the police.

1124
01:08:49,517 --> 01:08:52,352
But taylor knows who you are.

1125
01:08:52,354 --> 01:08:54,354
What if she sees you?

01:08:54,372 --> 01:08:56,856
Don't worry sweetie, okay?

Okay, let's go. Come on!

1131
01:09:21,065 --> 01:09:23,307
That's all very interesting,
mrs. Lewis,

1132
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:26,052
But I wish you'd leave
the investigating to us.

1133
01:09:26,054 --> 01:09:27,978
My daughter is missing,
detective.

1134
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:31,057
And I'm going to do anything
I can to get her back.

1135
01:09:31,075 --> 01:09:32,575
And with all due respect,

1136
01:09:32,727 --> 01:09:34,335
I haven't seen your department
doing too much investigating.

1137
01:09:34,487 --> 01:09:36,320
We've already put out
an alert for your daughter

1138
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,673
And distributed photographs to
all nearby police departments.

1139
01:09:38,824 --> 01:09:41,492
What you should be doing
is finding skylar driver.

1140
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:43,994
So first it's cathy driver,
now it's her daughter?

1141
01:09:44,014 --> 01:09:44,995
Exactly!

1142
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:46,255
But didn't you
originally tell me

1143
01:09:46,408 --> 01:09:48,016
That skylar driver
had her own daughter?

1144
01:09:48,092 --> 01:09:49,517
Why would she kidnap yours?

1145
01:09:49,594 --> 01:09:51,093
Have you not been
listening to anything

1146
01:09:51,246 --> 01:09:52,670
I've been telling you?

1147
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,339
According to her co-worker,
skylar couldn't get pregnant!

1148
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:57,692
Well, maybe she got pregnant
and didn't tell anybody.

1149
01:09:57,769 --> 01:10:00,086
Maybe she adopted.

1150
01:10:00,104 --> 01:10:02,755
There's plenty of ways to have
a baby without kidnapping one.

1151
01:10:02,757 --> 01:10:04,699
Then where's my daughter,
detective?

1152
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:07,777
You tell me, where's maya?

1153
01:10:07,929 --> 01:10:10,705
That's what I'm trying
to figure out, mrs. Lewis.

1154
01:10:13,268 --> 01:10:15,335
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

He's not going to be any help.

1159
01:10:27,782 --> 01:10:30,299
He completely dismissed
everything we discovered.

And worst of all,
I can't tell

1161

or if I'm a suspect!

You're not crazy.

1163

I'm afraid not.

01:11:37,685 --> 01:11:39,777
I would never ask this
in front of taylor,

Did you speak to taylor today
when she went to the station?

1190
01:11:57,981 --> 01:11:59,872
Uh no, I didn't.

1191
01:11:59,874 --> 01:12:01,816

That's why I came
to speak to you.

Well, I have to be honest,
we thought we did.

Between you and me...

1200
01:12:29,495 --> 01:12:33,072
Detective gallagher can get
a little stuck in his ways,

1201
01:12:33,074 --> 01:12:35,016
So why don't you try me?

1202
01:12:36,836 --> 01:12:40,246
Well, the main thing
we found out

1203
01:12:40,264 --> 01:12:43,524
Is where cathy driver's daughter
used to work.

1204
01:12:43,601 --> 01:12:46,694
We spoke to a former
co-worker of hers.

1205
01:12:46,771 --> 01:12:50,031
And it turns out skylar driver
didn't have a kid.

1206
01:12:54,445 --> 01:12:57,763
I was under the assumption
that she had a daughter.

1278
01:19:37,422 --> 01:19:38,439

1297

This doesn't make any sense.

1301
01:20:46,491 --> 01:20:49,234
Look, mrs. Lewis,
in cases like this

1302
01:20:49,236 --> 01:20:52,404
We usually look at
the mother because, well,

1303

Unfortunately that's
what history tells us.

1304

1306
01:21:00,915 --> 01:21:02,081
No.

I don't care what you say.
