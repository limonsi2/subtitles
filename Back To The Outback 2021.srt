00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:36,666
-No, no. We're not like that. We just--
-Shh.

1020
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,333
-He'll hear you.
-Huh?

1021
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,208
-[zipping]
-[sniffing]

1022
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:45,416
In case you kids are thinking
of helping these vermin…

1023
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,541
let me remind you what they can do.

1024
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,791
Once the most famous koala in the world.

1025
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,833
He had 100 million fans in China alone.

1026
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:01,750
-Hundred and twenty.
-Now he's dead.

1027
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:03,083
I saw his lips move.

1028
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:05,500
Murdered by those monsters.

1029
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,541
At least we've still got Giggles.

1030
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:10,916
[Pretty Boy] No!

1031
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:15,458
Now, where are they?

1032
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:22,708
He's just scared
'cause he thinks you're gonna bite him.

1033
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:25,416
But I reckon you're just a bit lost, yeah?

1034
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,000
Probably trying to get back
to the outback.

1035
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,291
[chuckles] Deadly.

1036
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:34,750
Thanks. You're pretty deadly too.

1037
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:38,625
Good luck. Hey!

1038
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:40,833
Hope you find your way home.

1039
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:44,666
Aw, you made a human friend.

1040
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:46,500
Guess they're not all like Chaz.

1041
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,416
[Nigel] Hey, where's Pretty Boy?

1042
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:57,041
Aw, poor guy!
He must've fallen off this treacherous--

1043
00:48:57,125 --> 00:49:00,583
-Whoa!
-[all screaming]

1044
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:05,833
[screaming]

1045
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:07,583
-[grunts]
-[all grunting]

1046
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:10,541
Ooh! Sweet!

1047
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:12,791
Like a tiny cloud filled with hate.

1048
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:14,166
[groaning]

1049
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:18,458
I just… A little bit more eucalyptus oil.

1050
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:20,375
Get up. We've gotta keep moving.

1051
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,500
-No.
-Snap out of it.

1052
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:25,041
No, Giggles. They're my fans.
What? Meet the Pope? Hmm?

1053
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:26,583
[gasps] Oh, it's you.

1054
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:28,625
-We have to keep moving.
-No!

1055
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:33,958
Please! Move!
[grunting] Chaz'll be here soon.

1056
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,750
Good! I want to go home.

1057
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:38,083
He threw you out of a bus.
He's not taking you home.

1058
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:41,125
Besides, you'll have a new home
with all our families.

1059
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:42,333
They're gonna love us!

1060
00:49:42,416 --> 00:49:44,833
[chuckling] You're a bunch
of creepy animals.

1061
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:47,750
-No one is ever going to love you.
-[all gasp]

1062
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,916
Why do you have to be so mean
all the time?

1063
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,041
Uh, I'm sorry.

1064
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:58,666
"It's so hard being a snake. Look at me!
Everybody hates me. Boo-hoo-hoo."

1065
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:02,083
Because they do.
Because all they see is a killer.

1066
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,458
"Oh, check it out, mate!
She can kill 100 people in ten seconds!"

1067
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:08,875
How'd you like to spend your whole life
being treated like a freak?

1068
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:11,458
I've got a webcam up my jacksie 24-7.

1069
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,083
The whole world watches me
when I take a whiz.

1070
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:17,125
That's different.
People love you. Your life's perfect.

1071
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:19,958
So just 'cause I look perfect,
my whole life is perfect.

1072
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:21,583
-Is that what you think?
-No, but--

1073
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:25,125
I had one thing going for me, my looks.

1074
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:27,041
And look what you've done to them.

1075
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:29,583
I'm slightly less attractive
than I was before!

1076
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:30,583
Oh brother!

1077
00:50:30,666 --> 00:50:33,875
I want to go home! [sobbing]

1078
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:35,833
I want my snuggly.

1079
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:41,375
I just… I want to have a massage
and to sleep for 17 hours.

1080
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:42,458
[wailing]

1081
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:45,416
Okay, look, I'm… I'm sorry
I took you away from the park.

1082
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,791
But a… a cage with a snuggly
is still a cage.

1083
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:51,958
At least out here, you know,
we're free to be whoever we want.

1084
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:55,500
Haven't you ever wanted
to be more than just pretty?

1085
00:50:58,291 --> 00:51:00,291
[laughing hysterically]

1086
00:51:02,666 --> 00:51:04,750
More than… More than…

1087
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,875
Where'd they go? Can you see 'em?

1088
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:11,875
Nah. Too much bush, I'm afraid.
We'll never find 'em out here.

1089
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:13,833
-[rock cracking]
-[screaming]

1090
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:16,708
[grunting, screaming]

1094
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:24,625
[grunts]

1095
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,416
[panting]

1096
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:31,208
Ahh! Get off! Get off me!
Get off me now! Get off me!

1097
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:33,625
Wow! That was amazing, Dad! You got her!

1098
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:35,250
Huh? I did?

1099
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:36,916
[grunting]

1100
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:39,083
I did! [chuckles] I got her!

1101
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:41,166
-[all] Maddie!
-Run!

1102
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:44,666
Never! I've always hated
your preference for beige.

1103
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:47,750
-Guys, charge!
-[Zoe] Yahh! [grunts]

1104
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:50,833
I saw that playing out a lot differently
in my mind.

1105
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:55,208
[laughing] I got em, Chazzie!
I got 'em all. I… I actually did it!

1106
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:56,458
I knew you would, Dad!

1107
00:51:56,541 --> 00:52:00,625
Who ya gonna call? Chaz Hunt.
What's the name again? Chaz Hunt.

1108
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:04,125
Yeah, I think we got it.
About time you showed up. Take me home.

1109
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,958
[grunts] Back off, you filthy has-been.

1110
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:07,958
[grunts] "Has-been"?

1111
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,750
-And as for you, you treacherous snake…
-[whimpering]

1112
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:13,791
No. [gasps]

1113
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:17,041
-Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing to her?
-Don't worry, Maddie.

1114
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:19,125
-No.
-[Chaz] It's just a tranquilizer.

1115
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:21,875
[groans] I can't believe
I'm about to say this.

1116
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:26,166
-[Chaz] I'm gonna take you back alive.
-I'm ug… I'm ug… I'm… [blabbers]

1117
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,083
Ugh! I'm ug…

1118
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,125
Come on, just spit it out, Pretty Boy!

1119
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:33,375
-[Maddie] No.
-[Pretty Boy] I'm ugly. You're ugly.

1120
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:36,875
We should all be this ugly.
Ugly is the new beautiful! [echoing]

1121
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:38,958
[rustling]

1122
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,208
[rapid footsteps]

-[snarling]
-[screaming]

1124
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:46,875
Ow! Chazzie!

1125
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:48,708
Good on ya, Dad! You're a legend!

1126
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:50,000
[screaming]

1127
00:52:50,916 --> 00:52:52,750
[snarling]

00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:56,208

1129
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:58,291
[screeching]

1130
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,708
[roaring]

1131
00:52:59,791 --> 00:53:01,666
Wait. Aren't you Tasmanian devils?

1132
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:05,958
That's us. This is my mate Lucifer,
Beelzebub. And I'm Dave.

1133
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:07,541
So why aren't you in Tasmania?

1134
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:10,458
Vacation. But always happy
to help out a fellow Ugly.

1135
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:13,791
Oh, no, it's not for me.
I'm actually famous for my beauty.

1136
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:16,541
Right. And I'm a French poodle.

1137
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:19,166
-Are you okay, love?
-[sighs] Yes. Thanks, Dave.

1138
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,666
Too easy. Boys, free the others.

1139
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:25,166
[growling]

1140
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,458
-[groaning]
-Ahh!

1141
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:29,000
My bloomin' onions!

1142
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:33,041
Help me, son! Throw me a rope!
I'm being attacked by savage predators!

1143
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:35,375
This is just like
the time you had to climb--

1144
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:37,750
-Just throw me the damn rope!
-[snarling]

1145
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:40,750
Up, Chazzie! [screaming]

1146
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:43,416
-[growling, screeching]
-[Chaz whimpering]

1147
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:46,416
-Wow. Thanks, Mr. Lucifer.
-That was amazing.

1148
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,500
Boy, you Tasmanians don't mess around.

1149
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:50,458
Too easy. All right, boys, let's dip.

1150
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:53,416
We'd better get goin'
before Terry Tight Pants calls in backup.

1151
00:53:54,041 --> 00:53:57,375
Thanks, Pretty Boy. You saved my life.

1152
00:53:57,458 --> 00:54:01,416
Don't mention it. Seriously, not a word.
And do not hug me.

1153
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,500
You know what this means?
You don't hate me anymore.

1154
00:54:04,583 --> 00:54:06,625
I'm a Capricorn. I hate everybody.

1155
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:08,083
Can we please just go?

1156
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:11,291
As soon as I find a private jet,
I'm outta here. Gone.

1157
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:12,666
[giggling]

1158
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,541
[panting]

1159
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,375
[grunts, pants]

1160
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:21,750
Dad, come on!
They're getting away! Get up!

1161
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:29,916
[panting] I can't. I need a rest.
I'm parched. Where's the FIJI Water?

1162
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,708
We drank it all, but here.

1163
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:33,791
[slurping, gulping]

1164
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,041
-What is it?
-My urine.

1165
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:37,416
[Chaz spitting]

1166
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,208
I got the idea from that time
you were tracking those lions.

1167
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:42,875
-What?
-You went ten days without food or water.

1168
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:45,875
And you had to lie in manure
so the lions couldn't smell you.

1169
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:47,708
Hey, maybe we should do that. Maybe--

1170
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:50,041
-I never tracked a lion!
-[gasps]

1171
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:54,208
Or rhinos. Or wolves.
Or even a package online!

1172
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,875
But you grew up in the outback.

1173
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:56,958
No, Chazzie.

1174
00:54:57,041 --> 00:55:00,833
[clears throat] I grew up
above my auntie's lingerie store…

1175
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:03,250
[in American accent] …in Tampa, Florida.

1176
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:06,000
But what happened to your voice?

1177
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,708
This is my voice.

1178
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:10,666
My real voice. Okay?

1179
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:15,250
You see, son, when I was a kid,
I got picked on a lot by other kids.

1180
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:16,666
[indistinct chatter on TV]

1181
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,041

So glad he's gone, right?

1350
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:21,291
Did he seem kinda clingy to you?

1351
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:22,333
Not really.

1352
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:24,250
Yeah, no, he was definitely clingy.

1353
01:04:24,333 --> 01:04:26,625
I mean, he hides it,
but he is gonna miss me.

1354
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:29,875
I mean, us.
He is gonna… he's gonna miss us.

1355

It's okay if you miss him too, Maddie.

You know that he's actually a marsupial?
Not even a bear.

we're from the city?

But you're supposed to be our families.
You're the reason we came all this way.

1437
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:44,833
Sorry, love,
but none of us have ever left before.

1438
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:46,833
Then it's about time you did!

1439
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:49,333
Yeah! And if you don't help us,
we'll rip you apart

1440
01:09:49,416 --> 01:09:50,958
and turn you into a pair of shoes!

-Not a nice pair of shoes either.

Yeah, I'm talking to you, brown snake!
Don't you turn your backs on--

1444
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:01,500
They turned their backs.
Yep, they're definitely gone.

1446

What are you doing here?
Why aren't you with the other koalas?

1447
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:09,625
Yeah, nah, that…
Yeah, that didn't really work out.

it was going to be.

She's my best friend, but did you see
how many gumnuts she ate?

1450
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:17,958
Sorry. That is not fur. That is fat.
We need to kick her out of the tree.

1451
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:21,458
Be honest. Do you think
koalas can be a little bit shallow?

1452
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:23,375
-Um…
-I don't belong with them.

the only place I do belong is… with you.
