coming right up!

On your left, baby girl.

And bonus, he’s actually
wearing a costume

836
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:43,492
like he’s not
embarrassed to be

837
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:45,065
in a superhero movie for once.

838
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:46,561
I don’t understand.

839
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:47,463
You said my universe is dying

840
00:32:47,463 --> 00:32:49,971
because this sack of nuts
got himself killed.

841
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:52,534
- Well, problem solved.
- My God.

842
00:32:52,534 --> 00:32:57,715
You actually think you can
replace an Anchor Being

843
00:32:57,715 --> 00:32:58,848
with this?

844
00:32:58,848 --> 00:33:01,983
I wouldn’t have accepted
any other Wolverine, BT dubs.

845
00:33:01,983 --> 00:33:03,820
But you have outdone yourself

846
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,086
and brought me
the worst Wolverine!

847
00:33:06,086 --> 00:33:07,791
What do you mean,
the worst one?

848
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:08,726
Mr. Wilson.

849
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:12,620
This Wolverine let down
his entire world.

850
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,700
He’s the stuff of legend,
but not in a good way.

851
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,064
And what he did,

beyond forgiveness.

Okay.

855

How do I... How do I make
this right? I’ll do anything.

856
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,637
I gave you
a chance at greatness.

857
00:33:29,637 --> 00:33:32,475
Because my superiors
deemed you "special."

858
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:34,279
Clearly not special
in a good way.

859
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,049
Apparently you have some

860
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:37,546
important future purpose
to serve.

861
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:38,690
With Thor. He holds me.

862
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,054
But I did my duty.

863
00:33:40,054 --> 00:33:42,221
I gave you the opportunity
to be somebody.

864
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:43,992
And instead of
accepting my offering

865
00:33:43,992 --> 00:33:47,061
with humility and gratitude,
you broke my nose.

866

[sighs] It looks great.

867
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:49,800
And you decimated
dozens of my men

868
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,131
with the exhumed corpse
of a hero.

869
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:53,969
Dishonoring not only
his remains but his memory.

870
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:55,465
What are you, the Internet?

871
00:33:55,465 --> 00:33:57,742

The humane thing to do

of vaporizing my universe

making you peckish?

Mm-mm.

But I’ve had several STDs,

01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:36,532
plus, you guys.
We can put Cassandra

1743
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:39,007
over our knee and force her
to let us out of The Void.

1744
01:10:39,007 --> 01:10:40,767
I know what it means
to feel self-doubt.

1745
01:10:40,767 --> 01:10:42,010
- I don’t feel that at all.
- I’m good.

1746
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:44,408
[Deadpool] Gnawing at your gut
like a coked-up tapeworm.

1747
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:46,080
It’s like you’re holding up
a mirror to my soul.

1748
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,950
[Deadpool] You guys
may not have been able

1749
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:49,710
to save your universes.

1750
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:51,613
But you can avenge them.

1751
01:10:51,613 --> 01:10:53,219
It’s what Johnny
would have wanted.

1752
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:56,926
Wait. You knew Johnny?

1753
01:10:57,058 --> 01:10:57,993
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.

1754
01:10:57,993 --> 01:10:59,621
Dickhead here talked him
into a team-up,

1755
01:10:59,621 --> 01:11:02,459
and Johnny came down with
a little case of the deads.

1756
01:11:02,459 --> 01:11:03,691
[Deadpool] No, no, no.
We don’t know that.

1757
01:11:03,691 --> 01:11:06,067
It was just a flesh wound.
He may have survived.

1758
01:11:06,067 --> 01:11:08,861
If he survived that,
he is prayin’ for death.

1759
01:11:08,861 --> 01:11:10,533
[Deadpool] Thank you,
Doctor Wolverine!

1760
01:11:10,533 --> 01:11:12,942
- Spill it!
- What’d you do to Johnny, huh?

1761
01:11:12,942 --> 01:11:14,009
Talk or I’m gonna
start dealin’.

1762
01:11:14,009 --> 01:11:16,737
[Deadpool] Okay. Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.

1763
01:11:16,737 --> 01:11:17,309
Look.

1764
01:11:17,309 --> 01:11:19,707
He ran his fat-ass mouth
about Cassandra.

1765
01:11:19,707 --> 01:11:21,082
Then she zip-zapped his skin,

1766
01:11:21,082 --> 01:11:23,051
leaving his organs to splash
crudely onto the ground

1767
01:11:23,051 --> 01:11:26,681
while the soil
greedily drank his blood.
It was horrible.

1768
01:11:26,681 --> 01:11:27,814
He was like a brother to me.

1769
01:11:27,814 --> 01:11:31,356
Look, he died before he could
make a difference. But...

1770
01:11:31,356 --> 01:11:32,819
- [laughs]
- Look, maybe you couldn’t

1771
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:33,963
save your worlds, but...

1772
01:11:33,963 --> 01:11:36,559
but Jesus Christ,
you can save mine!

1773
01:11:36,559 --> 01:11:38,825
I don’t give a shit
about your world, but

1774
01:11:38,825 --> 01:11:42,136
if these two made it out of
there alive, maybe together,

1775
01:11:42,136 --> 01:11:43,830
we can get back in
and take her down.

1776
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:46,899
Where I come from,
we call that suicide, Chere.

1777
01:11:46,899 --> 01:11:49,176
[Deadpool] If we can block
her psychic powers,

1778
01:11:49,176 --> 01:11:51,244
we can get a leg up.
I know it.

1779
01:11:51,244 --> 01:11:52,982
Now, I know Magneto’s dead.

1780
01:11:52,982 --> 01:11:55,380
But I’d venture to guess
that his helmet is lying

1781
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,679
- around here somewhere--
- Cassandra melted the helmet.

1782
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:58,988
- [Deadpool] Fuck!
- After she killed him.

1783
01:11:58,988 --> 01:12:00,847
- [Deadpool] Fuck!
- She don’t play.

1784
01:12:00,847 --> 01:12:02,420
She knows that helmet
was the only way

1785
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:03,883
to protect anyone
from her powers.

1786
01:12:03,883 --> 01:12:06,226
The only other helmet that
strong is Juggernaut’s,

1787
01:12:06,226 --> 01:12:07,095
but he works for Cassandra.

1788
01:12:07,095 --> 01:12:08,459
[Deadpool]
Juggernaut’s helmet.
That’s it.

1789
01:12:08,459 --> 01:12:10,395
Yeah, and we done be knowing
that lid ain’t comin’ off

1790
01:12:10,395 --> 01:12:12,001
without that dome
gonna come off wit’it.

1791
01:12:12,001 --> 01:12:13,497
[Deadpool] I’m so sorry, beautiful.

1792
01:12:13,497 --> 01:12:14,333
I want this to be gentle.

1793
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:16,203
Who is your dialect coach?
The Minions?

1794
01:12:16,203 --> 01:12:20,735
I feel like we are missing
critical exposition here.

1795
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:24,838
I’m sick of this shit.
I’m sick of hiding.

1796
01:12:24,838 --> 01:12:27,247
Let’s face it,
our worlds forgot about us.

1797
01:12:27,247 --> 01:12:29,183
Or never learned about us.

1798
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,778
The heroes we were.

1799
01:12:30,778 --> 01:12:32,021
Lives we saved.

1800
01:12:32,021 --> 01:12:33,187
Or wanted to save.

1801
01:12:33,187 --> 01:12:35,585
Maybe these two
are our chance.

1802
01:12:35,585 --> 01:12:36,784
[gurgling]

1803
01:12:36,784 --> 01:12:38,522
To be remembered.

1804
01:12:38,522 --> 01:12:40,260
The way we deserve.

1805
01:12:40,854 --> 01:12:41,987
[Deadpool] Yes.

1806
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:43,593
An ending.

1807
01:12:43,593 --> 01:12:44,891
- Legacy.
- [Deadpool] Yes!

1808
01:12:44,891 --> 01:12:46,101
Yes! Let this man cook.

1809
01:12:46,101 --> 01:12:47,630
This is what
I’m talking about.

1810
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,797
Big slow-motion fights,
sad music.

1811
01:12:49,797 --> 01:12:50,666
Everybody working together.

1812
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,701
Who knows if you live or die?
That sorta thing.

1813
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:55,143
- Who’s ready?
- I was born ready.

1814
01:12:55,143 --> 01:12:56,474
[Deadpool] Yes!
Gambit?

1815
01:12:56,474 --> 01:12:57,244
I ain’t know my daddy,

1816
01:12:57,244 --> 01:12:59,147
but I’m sure I shot out
of his dick ready.

1817
01:12:59,147 --> 01:13:00,775
[Deadpool] Jesus Christ,
that is graphic.

1818
01:13:00,775 --> 01:13:02,744
Yeah. He was layin’ them
buttery nuts all up in my mama

1819
01:13:02,744 --> 01:13:04,845
and I shot out there
and I said, "What’s up, Doc?"

1820
01:13:04,845 --> 01:13:07,749
[Deadpool laughs]
Johnny must have loved you.

1821
01:13:07,749 --> 01:13:10,191
X-23, what’s it gonna be?

1822
01:13:10,191 --> 01:13:10,884
The name’s Laura.

1823
01:13:10,884 --> 01:13:14,096
- Let’s fucking go.
- [Deadpool] Let’s fucking go!

1824
01:13:14,096 --> 01:13:15,196
It’s on like chicken and corn.

1825
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:17,066
- [Deadpool] Yeah!
- We’re doing this.

1826
01:13:17,066 --> 01:13:17,825
You’re all fuckin’ dead.

1827
01:13:17,825 --> 01:13:21,169
[Deadpool] My God!
Read the room.

1828
01:13:23,897 --> 01:13:26,306
[crickets chirping]

1829
01:13:29,771 --> 01:13:30,607
[exhales]

1830
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:35,150
Hey, hey. I’m not lookin’
for company. Get out of here.

1831
01:13:36,613 --> 01:13:38,153
You remind me of him.

1832
01:13:38,153 --> 01:13:39,517
Angry. Drunk. Mean...

1833
01:13:39,517 --> 01:13:42,850
- Sounds like a great guy--
- Wasn’t finished.

1834
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:46,260
Showed up when
it mattered the most.

1835
01:13:47,855 --> 01:13:50,165
Couldn’t help it.

1836
01:13:51,232 --> 01:13:52,662
[sighs]

1837
01:13:52,662 --> 01:13:54,829
You might not know it, but...

1838
01:13:54,961 --> 01:13:56,699
you’re a good man, Logan.

1839
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:58,173
[chuckles]

1840
01:13:58,173 --> 01:14:00,241
You might not know it,
but apparently,

1841
01:14:00,241 --> 01:14:02,309
I’m the worst Logan.

1842
01:14:03,145 --> 01:14:06,038
I got to have a life
because of you.

1843
01:14:08,007 --> 01:14:10,680
I got to grow up
because of you.

1844
01:14:12,044 --> 01:14:13,122
A lot of kids did.

1845
01:14:13,122 --> 01:14:16,389
A lot of kids didn’t grow up
because of me.

1846
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:20,195
Trust me, kid, I’m no hero.

1847
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:22,725
That suit says different.

1848
01:14:22,725 --> 01:14:25,761
- Yeah. Do you like it?
- Mm.

1849
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:29,336
Scott used to beg me
to wear it.

1850
01:14:30,832 --> 01:14:34,209
So did Jean, Storm, Beast.

1851
01:14:35,738 --> 01:14:36,970
All of them.

1852
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:40,842
They wanted me to be part
of the team, but I wouldn’t.

1853
01:14:40,842 --> 01:14:45,418
Told ’em they all look
fucking ridiculous. I mean...

1854
01:14:45,946 --> 01:14:49,983
I couldn’t have ’em thinkin’
I wanted to be there.

1855
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:57,089
And then one day,
while I was off on my own,

1856
01:14:57,089 --> 01:14:58,893
the humans came...

1857
01:14:58,893 --> 01:15:00,994
and went mutant hunting.

1858
01:15:01,566 --> 01:15:02,831
I can guess the rest.

1859
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,668
No, no, let me...

1860
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,099
Let me say it. I...

1861
01:15:09,068 --> 01:15:10,905
I need to say it.

1862
01:15:12,104 --> 01:15:15,547
By the time I stumbled home
shitfaced from the bar,

1863
01:15:15,547 --> 01:15:17,384
it was too late.

1864
01:15:20,145 --> 01:15:22,851
They were dead. Every...
[stifling sob]

1865

[♪ mournful music playing]

1866
01:15:27,592 --> 01:15:32,091
This suit’s all I got to
remind me of who they were.

1867
01:15:33,565 --> 01:15:35,127
And what I did.

1868
01:15:42,475 --> 01:15:43,971
[sniffles]

1869
01:15:47,007 --> 01:15:49,911
We’re headed to Cassandra’s
at sunup.

1870
01:15:50,043 --> 01:15:52,749
Have fun. Not my fight.

1871
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:57,688
We won’t pull this off
without you.

1872
01:16:03,155 --> 01:16:07,962
Hey. Whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.

1873
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:12,406
You were always the wrong guy.

1874
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:21,074
[♪ mournful music continues]

1875
01:16:35,462 --> 01:16:37,695
[cell phone ringing]

1876
01:16:37,695 --> 01:16:38,190
What?

1877
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:40,027
Alioth didn’t get them.
[sniffs]

1878
01:16:40,027 --> 01:16:43,470
Cassandra wanted to
play with them herself first.

1879
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:44,097
They got away.

1880
01:16:44,097 --> 01:16:45,868
- Did they find the others?
- No.

1881
01:16:45,868 --> 01:16:46,902
Good. All right. Phew.

1882
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:49,069
- The others found them.
- Oh, very cute.

1883
01:16:49,069 --> 01:16:50,741
Well done, Pyro.
Classic bait and switch.

1884
01:16:50,741 --> 01:16:53,414
- You really got me there.
- Relax.

1885
01:16:53,414 --> 01:16:55,878
If they come after Nova,
she’ll handle it.

1886
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:57,682
Cassandra is
a lunatic wild card.

1887
01:16:57,682 --> 01:16:59,948
Why do you think we put her
there in the first place?

1888
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:02,049
Thank God she’s never chosen
to leave The Void.

1889
01:17:02,049 --> 01:17:05,492
The Time Ripper is hours away
from completion.

1890
01:17:05,492 --> 01:17:06,856
I cannot take any chances.

1891
01:17:06,856 --> 01:17:07,989
Well, maybe not.

1892
01:17:07,989 --> 01:17:09,496
But I can.

1893
01:17:09,496 --> 01:17:10,090
For a price.

1894
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:11,993
Why do you have to
say it in that silly voice?

1895
01:17:11,993 --> 01:17:12,631

And there’s the lights.

2849
02:02:25,638 --> 02:02:26,903
For medical research.

- Bye-bye, video. [smooches]

[Deadpool] I’m tired of
these absolutely vile rumors

2854
02:06:45,832 --> 02:06:47,900
that I got Johnny killed.

2855
02:06:48,098 --> 02:06:50,001
Let’s look at the tape.

02:06:50,606 --> 02:06:51,574
In The Void,

2857
02:06:51,574 --> 02:06:53,774
you’re either food for Alioth

2858
02:06:53,774 --> 02:06:55,743
or you work for her.

2859
02:06:57,910 --> 02:06:59,043
[Deadpool] Go on, Johnny.

2860
02:06:59,043 --> 02:07:01,177
And I’ll tell you
who "her" is.

2861
02:07:01,177 --> 02:07:01,782
Cassandra Nova.

2862
02:07:01,782 --> 02:07:03,982
A megalomaniacal,
psychotic asshole.

2863
02:07:03,982 --> 02:07:05,621

dead-inside pixie slab

And I’ll tell you

- what she can do.
- [Deadpool] I’m listening.

2866
02:07:09,559 --> 02:07:11,528
She can lick my goddamn
cinnamon ring clean

2867
02:07:11,528 --> 02:07:12,892
and kick rocks
all the way to bald hell.

2868
02:07:12,892 --> 02:07:15,499
In fact, I don’t give a shit
if she removes all my skin

and pops me like some
nightmarish blood balloon.

is light
that fuck-box on fire,

02:07:22,935 --> 02:07:23,672
I still won’t die happy.

Holy shit, girl. You crazy.

2875

That’s right, Wade.
I won’t be happy
until I’ve urinated

on her freshly
barbecued corpse

the charred remains
