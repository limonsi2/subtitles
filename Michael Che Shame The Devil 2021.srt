00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,364
Whoa, what's up, Oakland?

5
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,791
Please, please, please.

6
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:43,668
Thank you.

7
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,795
Oh.

8
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,464
[audience cheering]

9
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,468
This is exciting.

10
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,595
[man] Yeah!

11
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,681
Thank you so much.
Thank you for coming to this.

12
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,475
And I really appreciate it.

13
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,020
This is gonna be fun.
I had to do this special in Oakland.

14
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,064
[audience cheering]

15
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,072
Oakland is one
of my favorite cities in the world.

16
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,657
-It's like-- It is. It is.
-[audience cheering]

17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,453
It's a very unique city.

18
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,831
It's the one place where you can get
stock tips from a pimp.

19
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,458
[audience laughing]

20
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,714
The whole bay is dope.

21
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,219
I didn't wanna tape in San Francisco.

22
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,763
[audience laughing, then cheering]

23
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,855
Nothing against San Francisco,
just a little too whimsy for me.

24
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,315
[audience laughing]

25
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:51,194
You know what I mean? It's just too--
There's just too much hope.

26
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,779
[audience laughing]

27
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,740
I didn't think my jokes
would do well there.

28
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,283
[audience laughing]

29
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,869
When a parent says,
"You can be anything you wanna be,"

30
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,331
I feel like that sentence should end with,
"In San Francisco."

31
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,791
[audience laughing]

32
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,462
You wanna open a bakery,
but you only make cupcakes?

33
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,798
You can be anything you wanna be...

34
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,801
in San Francisco.

35
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,969
[audience laughing]

36
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,724
You wanna smoke crack
in front of the library?

37
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,143
[audience laughing]

38
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,898
Oh, you know that guy?

39
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,275
[audience laughing]

40
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,160
There's so much to talk about. This is
my first special in five years. I--

41
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,327
[audience cheering]

42
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,961
I got so much on my mind, man.

43
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,258
You ever see a homeless guy with a dick
so big, you stop feeling sorry for him?

44
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,759
[audience laughing]

45
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,566
You could be whatever you wanna be...

46
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,817
[audience laughing]

47
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,695
...in San Francisco.

48
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,740
[Che laughing]

49
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,785
I saw that recently.
I did see a homeless guy--

50
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,830
Uh, a gentleman.
I don't know what you call him, but...

51
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,165
[audience laughing]

52
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:32,378
His dick was so big that I started to
think maybe that's why he was homeless.

53
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,838
[audience laughing]

54
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,886
Maybe he went through life
with too much confidence.

55
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,054
[audience laughing]

56
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,974
People warned him, "Get a better job
or you'll lose everything."

57
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,435
He's like, "Job? I don't need money.

58
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,897
I got a big-ass dick. I'll be fine.

59
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,983
Just whip this shit out in CVS.

60
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,652
[audience laughing]

61
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,323
See where it takes me."

62
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,491
[audience laughing]

63
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,165
That sounds like just
a gross dick joke, but, you know...

64
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,001
[audience laughing]

65
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:16,965
Maybe it's insight into the fragile
male ego. Okay, now it's smart.

66
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:23,554
It's true. A gainfully employed man
can see a homeless guy with a giant penis

67
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,181
and be like, "Lucky motherfucker."

68
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,516
[audience laughing]

69
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,561
"Some dudes just get
all the breaks, I guess."

70
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,771
[audience laughing]

71
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,821
I don't know why men are so obsessed
with their dicks. It's funny.

72
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,532
Every man here knows
what I'm talking about.

73
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:49,080
Every dude here has measured his dick,
and I don't mean just with a ruler.

74
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,418
Anything that could be
the shape of a dick.

75
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,669
[audience laughing]

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,047
Hairbrush, shampoo bottle.

77
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:02,051
Ladies, if you go in the bathroom
and see the remote control in there.

78
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,137
You're like, "Why is the remote in here?"

79
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,930
[audience laughing, applauding]

80
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,309
'Cause we gotta get scale.

81
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,476
[audience laughing]

82
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,273
Women don't measure their genitals.

83
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:19,235
Either because you're smarter
or you haven't figured out how yet.

84
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,528
[audience laughing]

85
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:24,240
What would you do? Fill it
with water and stand over a bucket?

86
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,450
[audience laughing]

87
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,454
[audience applauding]

88
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,624
-"I got two cups of pussy." Ew.
-[audience laughing]

89
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,710
[Che laughing]

90
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,173
"Two cups of pussy" sounds like
a Megan Thee Stallion song.

91
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,633
[audience laughing, then cheering]

92
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,223
Two cups of pussy.

93
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:57,482
I like Megan Thee Stallion, but...
I did not understand "WAP."

94
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,486
Like, wet-ass pussy?
All the time? For real?

95
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,030
You got, like, a condition?

96
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:09,202
"That's right.
My pussy's wet all the time.

97
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,662
Funerals, birthday parties.

98
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,789
[audience laughing]

99
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,709
Court."

100
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,960
[audience laughing]

101
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,968
Men are obsessed with their dicks.

102
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,680
I've been trying to figure that shit out
my entire life. Why?

103
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:34,477
It's not because women like them.
We'd prefer if you didn't like it.

104
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,772
[audience laughing]

105
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,777
You don't believe me? Go home.
Go home. Tell your boyfriend one day.

106
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,573
If you're watching this at home,
go to your boyfriend and say, "I'm leaving

107
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,700
'cause your dick is way too big.

108
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,077
[audience laughing]

109
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,037
I hate having sex with you.

110
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,998
I need a much smaller man."

111
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,336
He's gonna smile and say,
"You gotta do what you gotta do.

112
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,462
[audience laughing]

113
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,883
This ain't going to ever change."

114
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,395
I think men know
that women like big dicks,

115
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,022
but we just don't know how big is too big.

116
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,568
So we think the number's infinity.

117
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,694
[audience laughing]

118
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,658
It can't be infinity.
At some point, it's too much, right?

119
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,829
At some point, you're standing in front
of a vending machine with a $100 bill.

120
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,038
[audience chuckling]

121
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,836
They're like,
"It's nice, but it ain't going in.

122
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,212
[audience laughing]

123
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,803
I sure wish I had a five on me now."

124
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,929
[audience laughing]

125
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:04,442
This is weird, seeing you in your masks,
but this audience is fully vaxed.

126
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,776
Uh, I don't really--

127
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,236
[audience cheering]

128
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,078
I don't have a strong stance
on whether you wanna be vaxed.

129
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,957
I asked for it to be fully vaxed
because I wanted the audience

130
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,501
to understand my jokes.

131
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,960
[audience laughing]

132
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,379
[audience cheering]

133
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,811
That doesn't make sense. I just talked
for 15 minutes about homeless-guy dicks.

134
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,104
[audience laughing]

135
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,069
I'm pandering.

136
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm with you, though, I wear my mask.

137
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,203
If I wasn't performing, I'd have mine on.

138
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,540
I started wearing mine when they said,
"We don't need masks anymore."

139
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,291
I was like, "I want my mask."

140
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,376
[audience laughing]

141
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:08,214
Remember? "We don't need masks
this summer." I was like, "Uh, no, we do."

142
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,632
[audience laughing]

143
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,095
I'm serious.

144
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,097
When they first said
we needed those masks,

145
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,558
I was like, "Fuck the mask.
That mask can't work."

146
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,978
Then they're like, "We don't need masks."
"I want my mask."

147
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,354
[audience laughing]

148
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,734
It's like when a girl says "You don't
need a condom." "I need two condoms."

149
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,069
[audience laughing]

150
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,992
"I never wanted a condom more
until you said that nasty shit."

151
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,875
That's right. You better be vaccinated
if you wanna come to my show.

152
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,753
You got to be vaccinated.
Get one of the three--

153
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,921
[audience cheering]

154
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:54,594
Everybody's gotta be vaccinated,
or, you know, get one of them cards.

155
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,053
[audience laughing]

156
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,977
That's the rule. Get vaccinated,
or, you know, a card.

157
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,230
Just some card stock in a printer.

158
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:12,111
Anything will do. We're not looking.
Don't laminate it. Doesn't matter.

159
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,362
[audience chuckling]

160
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,948
That's our defense.

161
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:22,121
I'm trying to get my mother
to get the vaccine. She's scared.

162
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:28,753
Well, it's not her fault. Her neighbor got
the vaccine, and he died three days later.

163
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,880
He got hit by a truck.

164
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,256
[audience laughing]

165
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,344
She thinks the vaccine is unlucky.

166
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,511
[audience laughing]

167
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,100
I got the vaccine,
but I'm still skeptical. I don't know.

168
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,687
Is anybody skeptical?
Does anybody feel safer?

169
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,064
[audience cheering]

170
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:53,277
They make us feel stupid for being
skeptical. I took it, but I don't know.

171
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:57,114
You know why I was skeptical?
Because the vaccine was free.

172
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,324
[audience laughing]

173
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,370
I was like, I don't know about that shit.

174
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,290
Free medicine in America? Uh...

175
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,793
Since when?

176
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,294
[audience cheering]

177
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,261
If the vaccine was $3000, I'd be like,
"That sounds right.

178
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,931
They trying to keep
rich niggas alive. I get it."

179
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,519
But free? That just sounds like a setup.

180
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,312
[audience laughing]

181
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,940
I grew up in public housing, you know...

182
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:37,446
I remember what the government gives you
for free. It's not usually their best.

183
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,449
I don't know
if you've tasted their cheese.

184
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,534
[audience laughing]

185
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,246
I wouldn't trust them with vaccines
after that.

186
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,330
[audience laughing]

187
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:51,544
I asked my doctor. I want the vaccine,
but give me the one that costs some money.

188
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,003
[audience laughing]

189
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:59,635
He was like, "What?" I was like,
"Give me the fucking... The real one.

190
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,387
[audience laughing]

191
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,099
I don't want that free shit.

192
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,768
Give me the $3000 one."

193
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:13,357
He was like, "They're all the same." Okay,
but which one are you gonna give Rihanna?

194
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,442
[audience laughing]

195
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,569
She's important.

196
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,284
You tell me to trust science.
I don't know science.

197
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,827
[audience laughing]

198
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,036
I trust history.

199
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,041
History says, if this was any good,
you'd be charging us for it.

200
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,376
[audience laughing]

201
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,257
I took that COVID serious.
I stayed in for the first three months.

202
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,594
I didn't go nowhere.
I didn't protest. I didn't even loot.

203
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,012
[audience laughing]

204
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,768
I really needed some shit too.
I didn't loot.

205
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,563
I wanted to be a part of that.
I did not loot.

206
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,400
It's embarrassing!
I gotta tell my grandkids about that.

207
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:00,279
Greatest time to be alive as a Black man,
I didn't get in on it.

208
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,572
[audience laughing]

209
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,617
Imagine asking your grandpa,
"What was it like marching in Selma?"

210
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,620
He's like, "There was a nasty flu
that summer, so...

211
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,913
[audience laughing]

212
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,665
I stayed home because of germs."

213
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,875
[audience laughing]

214
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,420
"My grandfather
was a bitch-ass nigga, man."

215
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,588
[audience laughing]

216
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,216
Fucking coon.

217
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,804
I had to watch
all the looting and protesting on TV.

218
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,392
It was dope too.
I've never been prouder to be a Black man.

219
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,104
I'm serious. Watching Black people
come together and tear shit up?

220
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,732
That shit was a sight to see. I was proud.

221
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,108
[audience cheering]

222
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,698
I was calling all my white friends,
"Colin, you know what it is." Hanging up.

223
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,116
[audience laughing]

224
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,411
I was showing off. I was excited.

225
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:59,838
I was so excited. I was so proud.
Up until January 6th.

226
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:00,965
[audience booing]

227
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,716
When they stormed that Capitol.

228
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,678
And I saw how real niggas loot.

229
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,887
[audience laughing]

230
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:13,310
-That was impressive! Holy shit!
-[audience cheering]

231
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,442
Say what you will, but that was
some good fucking looting, goddamn.

232
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,238
Black people did okay.
We were stealing, like, from Target.

233
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,615
We got Gucci belts.

234
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,618
The motherfuckers tried to steal
the Constitution

235
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,079
of the United States of America.

236
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,914
[audience cheering]

237
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,292
I didn't know that was up for grabs.

238
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,626
[audience laughing]

239
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,213
I was watching that on TV, like,
"Fuck, let's get another go!"

240
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,384
Like watching Supermarket Sweep,
they go for the caviar.

241
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,095
You're like, "Oh, this nigga-- a genius."

242
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:55,811
All types of racist white groups
I'd never heard of.

243
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,773
I was watching that. "The Proud Boys
are coming." The Proud Boys?

244
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,110
"The Boogaloo Niggas."
Who are the Boogaloo Niggas?

245
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,445
[audience laughing]

246
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:10,534
Why are they dressed like Vikings?
What happened to sheets?

247
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,660
[audience laughing]

248
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,872
Y'all too good for sheets now?
You're Vikings?

249
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,670
I was embarrassed, dude.

250
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,717
I was like, "Fuck that.
I gotta start protesting.

251
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,262
We're not as far ahead as I thought."

252
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:35,643
I went to a Black Lives Matter rally
right after that to support.

253
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,519
But I must have gone too late.

254
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,689
It was all white women there.

255
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,566
[audience laughing, then cheering]

256
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,821
Holy shit. You ever...

257
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,492
You ever end up at a whites-only
Black Lives Matter rally?

258
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,118
That shit is confusing.

259
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,080
You gotta prepare for that shit.

260
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,250
They had signs. "Stop racism!"

261
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,127
I'm like, who are you talking to?

262
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,295
[audience laughing]

263
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,213
Each other?

264
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,050
Just call your fucking dad!

265
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,301
[audience laughing]

266
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,638
[audience cheering]

267
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,102
That shit was crazy.

268
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,648
I saw a white lady with a sign that said,
"Fuck the police."

269
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,066
[audience laughing]

270
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,193
I wanted to rob her on principle.

271
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,444
[audience laughing]

272
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,281
Just to see how committed she was.

273
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,366
[audience laughing]

274
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,413
"Fuck the police."

275
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,135
It wasn't all bad. We got some good shit.

276
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,595
Black people got some good shit
out of them protests.

277
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,680
What we get?

278
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,143
What we got? We got Aunt Jemima fired.

279
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,397
I'll take it.

280
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,734
I don't know how high
that was on the docket but, sure.

281
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,194
It's about time, I guess.

282
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,698
Some liberated pancakes.

283
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,621
What else we get?
We got Juneteenth. Oh, yeah.

284
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:24,168
That fucking holiday we didn't definitely
just find out about two years ago.

285
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,879
You know.

286
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,338
Juneteenth.

287
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:33,552
The thing we definitely didn't just see
one TikTok video about and now we want it.

288
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,265
We need a new fucking negotiator,
Black people.

289
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,059
It's frustrating.

290
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,644
Like watching the Knicks
in the off-season.

291
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,149
Juneteenth? Who wanted that shit?
I thought we were getting Durant.

292
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,076
Where the fuck is Kyrie?

293
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,662
And I like Juneteenth.

294
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:05,000
It's just not as fun now
that white people get to celebrate it too.

295
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,254
It's your fault!
You shouldn't get the day off!

296
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,632
[audience laughing]

297
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,344
[audience cheering]

298
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,934
It's like celebrating the day
you stop hitting your wife.

299
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,061
[audience laughing]

300
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:30,067
This would be so much better
if we had Black leadership.

301
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,902
Real Black leadership.

302
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,904
All our Black leaders is just...

303
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,032
celebrities and niggas on Twitter.

304
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,325
[audience chuckling]

305
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,540
You a celebrity or nigga from Twitter,
people think you a Black leader.

306
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,417
I have kids that come up to me,
"I get all my news from you."

307
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,086
I'm like, "You don't know shit."

308
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,379
[audience laughing]

309
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,467
I'm not doing news. I'm telling jokes.

310
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,264
I'm not saying you shouldn't use
your platform for good,

311
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:04,768
but I'm just saying celebrities
are too busy to be actual Black leaders.

312
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,063
We need motherfuckers
that can do this shit full-time.

313
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,442
You know why Martin Luther King
got so much work done?

314
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,487
'Cause he wasn't also small forward
for the Lakers.

315
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,282
[audience laughing, applauding]

316
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,874
Too many small forwards
leading these marches.

317
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,005
That's why we don't got shit.

318
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,925
Everybody's getting shit but us
'cause everybody got leadership except us.

319
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:42,055
Asians got a hate-crime bill.
I don't remember their riot, but I'm glad.

320
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,432
[audience laughing]

321
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,560
[man] Talk about it.

322
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,728
Am I bullshitting?

323
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,770
[man] You're not.

324
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,440
-I was happy they got one too.
-[man] Me too.

325
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:57,362
Asians and Blacks, we get along great.
We have a beautiful relationship.

326
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,822
[audience cheering]

327
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,163
I love the Chinese. Chinese people
brought broccoli to the 'hood.

328
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,372
[audience laughing]

329
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,087
There was no broccoli in the ghetto
before Chinese people got there.

330
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,881
Don't you fucking start lying.

331
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,216
[audience laughing]

332
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,346
I didn't know what that was called.
Used to call it "little trees."

333
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,513
[audience laughing]

334
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,975
"Let me get an order
of beef and little trees."

335
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,813
Black people are very thankful for that.

336
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,652
Yeah, thank you.
I don't know how much we can thank you.

337
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,572
Why do you think there are so many
Black girls named China, Asia...?

338
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,199
[audience laughing]

339
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,828
We love you niggas.
For the broccoli, thank you.

340
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,539
[audience laughing, applauding]

341
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,462
I challenge you
to find one Black neighborhood

342
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,548
without at least
37 thriving Chinese businesses.

343
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,468
Not just Chinese. Everybody.

344
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:05,264
Everybody comes to a Black neighborhood
to open up their business. We know that.

345
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,100
Black people are like
the first boss in a video game.

346
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,351
[audience laughing]

347
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:14,022
"You want the American dream,
open up your store here first.

348
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,817
See what them chicken wings hit like."

349
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,110
[audience laughing]

350
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,575
And we don't mind it because
at least you sell shit we like.

351
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,454
Chicken wings, ponytails,
wave grease, do-rags.

352
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,622
[audience laughing]

353
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,624
Cigarettes one at a time.

354
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,750
[audience laughing]

355
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,962
DVDs, everything we like.

356
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,756
I don't know who's doing y'all research,
but they are nailing it.

357
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,636
What in-flight magazine are you reading
before you get to the 'hood?

358
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,805
But you know everything.

359
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,891
White people don't know that shit,

360
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,019
and we've been here
the whole time with them.

361
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,856
You ever needed wave grease
and went into a CVS?

362
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,190
[audience chuckling]

363
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,696
White people don't know shit.
That's why we never feel welcome here.

364
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,241
People come here
knowing more about us than you do,

365
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,701
and we're neighbors.

366
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,869
Isn't that crazy?

367
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,872
And I know this. Like, I'm American.

368
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,583
I'm born and raised in this country.

369
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,627
But I don't feel American.

370
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,007
[audience applauding]

371
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,887
I feel American
until I'm around something very American,

372
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,097
then I'm like, "I don't like this."

373
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,557
[audience laughing]

374
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,350
I think that's the better...

375
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,395
You know what I'm saying?
I'll give you an example.

376
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,898
I was driving through Texas one time.

377
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:38,982
[audience clamoring]

378
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,358
Oh, you heard of it?

379
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,526
[audience laughing]

380
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,988
I hit one of them small towns in Texas,

381
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,241
and there was
an American flag on every house.

382
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,368
And we all
looked at each other in the car,

383
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,412
like, "Let's get the fuck out of here.

384
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,456
[audience laughing, applauding]

385
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,504
This is way too American for us."

386
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,630
[audience laughing]

387
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,300
Somehow the American flag
is just too American.

388
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,761
I feel the same way
about the American flag

389
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,388
that I imagine white people
feel about Black people.

390
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,142
Like, I don't wanna
be around a lot of them.

391
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,352
[audience laughing]

392
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,150
Three or four is fine,
that's plenty, but, you know...

393
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,820
I don't wanna be surrounded.

394
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,071
[audience chuckling]

395
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,077
[Che laughs]

396
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,581
Black people love this country.
We're just more specific about our love.

397
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,125
You ask any nigga here:

398
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,752
"You love America?"
He'll be like, "I love Brooklyn.

399
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,003
[audience laughing]

400
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,549
Atlanta's cool.

401
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,677
I don't know shit about them Dakotas."

402
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,303
[audience laughing]

403
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:54,182
If there was a Black American flag,
there'd be, like, 11 stars.

404
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,144
For cities. Not even the whole state.

405
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,438
They'd be like,
"All right, Detroit, Oakland, D.C."

406
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,774
[audience cheering]

407
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,824
Everything else would be a question mark.

408
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,033
[audience laughing]

409
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,039
Black people
don't fuck with anything too patriotic.

410
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,417
Weirds us out.

411
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,546
You don't see American flags
in Black neighborhoods.

412
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:28,133
You'll see more Puerto Rican flags
in a Black neighborhood.

413
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,426
[audience cheering]

414
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,844
Ain't that crazy?

415
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,098
It's too patriotic.
White people love patriotic shit.

416
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,018
I get it.
It reminds you of America's history.

417
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,061
[audience laughing]

418
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,651
But for Black people,
it reminds us of America's history.

419
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,528
[audience cheering]

420
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,031
[Che chuckles]

421
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,749
Even the national anthem.
The national anthem, uh...

422
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,919
Remember when Kaepernick
kneeled for the anthem?

423
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,421
White people say,
"How the fuck could he do that?"

424
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,840
Niggas was watching like, "I get it."

425
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,008
[audience laughing]

426
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,260
'Cause you don't know
what it sounds like to us.

427
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,263
This is gonna be fucked up.

428
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,431
[audience laughing]

429
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,060
You know what
the national anthem feels like?

430
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,687
It feels like
I'm listening to R. Kelly now.

431
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,606
[audience cheering and clamoring]

432
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,444
It's still good.

433
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:37,786
It's still good. It's just hard
to not think about that other thing.

434
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,204
[audience laughing]

435
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,754
Look at this white guy.

436
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,050
R. Kelly's an R&amp;B singer
from the '90s who...

437
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,510
[audience laughing]

438
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,225
He made a lot
of important music for Black people

439
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,853
and two very important songs
for white people.

440
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,565
"I Believe I Can Fly"...

441
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,777
and the remix to "Ignition."

442
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,153
[audience cheering]

443
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,326
I love announcing that

444
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,371
'cause there's always a white girl like,
"Fuck. He made that too?

445
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,580
[audience laughing]

446
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,249
That's my wedding song."

447
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,583
[audience laughing]

448
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,211
It's a good song.

449
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,803
He also peed on a 15-year-old girl,
which white people just found out about,

450
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:40,181
and niggas have to pretend
we just found out about too.

451
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,349
[audience laughing]

452
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,813
We've known for a while. We saw the tape.

453
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,317
That's how long ago it was.
It was on tape.

454
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,819
This nigga set up a tripod for that shit.

455
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,237
[audience laughing]

456
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,740
Nobody here saw the tape?

457
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,161
I saw it. That was fucked up.

458
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,246
I don't know if you've seen it.

459
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,582
Not only does he pee on the girl,

460
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,584
which is already horrible,

461
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,545
but he also pees on his own couch.

462
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:11,921
[audience laughing]

463
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:20,055
When I saw that shit, I was like,
"This nigga's insane, man. Ooh.

464
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,849
Who would do such a thing?

465
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,227
Not gonna move that shit
to the linoleum or nothing?"

466
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,270
[audience laughing]

467
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,987
I'm not saying it's just as bad,
but one of them's a lot harder to clean.

468
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,322
[audience laughing]

469
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,997
Is that the line?

470
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:50,960
I have to ask, guys.

471
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,213
If I go too far,
let me know, I'll rein it back.

472
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,464
[audience clamoring]

473
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:59,928
I like making fun of dark shit.
That's just how I process information.

474
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,304
[audience cheering]

475
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,809
And it doesn't make me better or anything.
It's just how I do it.

476
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:11,147
Some people... Uh, some people don't.
Some people like to make sad shit sadder.

477
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,774
[audience chuckling]

478
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,317
You know. I disagree.

479
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:19,280
I like making fun of sad shit.
I don't like people who make fun shit sad.

480
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:23,743
What's worse, making fun of something sad,
or making sad of something fun?

481
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,871
You know? Who'd you rather be with?

482
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,667
Somebody that's gonna make you laugh
about that time you got molested, or...

483
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,793
[audience laughing]

484
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,467
Or somebody that tells you
scrambled eggs are just chicken abortions?

485
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,718
[audience laughing]

486
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,443
I'm asking, 'cause I like to make jokes
that are terrible to some people.

487
00:28:56,526 --> 00:29:01,156
-[woman] Whoo!
-Yeah. I'm always getting into trouble.

488
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:05,535
One time, I got in trouble
'cause I said I liked Donald Trump.

489
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,245
[audience laughing and clamoring]

490
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:11,875
Well, in fairness, he had just hosted SNL,
and he was fucking nice to me.

491
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,003
He was. He even gave me a nickname.

492
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,881
He called me
"One of the good ones," and, uh...

493
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,799
[audience laughing and applauding]

494
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,641
I don't know what he meant by that.

495
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,895
[groans]

496
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,567
I'm kidding. I don't like Donald Trump.

497
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,653
[audience cheering]

498
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,036
I don't hate Donald Trump.

499
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,080
I didn't love him, I didn't hate him.

500
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:55,126
I just wish he wasn't our president,
if that makes sense.

501
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,419
[audience applauding]

502
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,214
But if Trump was
the president of anywhere else,

503
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,383
I would have been like,
"This nigga Trump is hilarious.

504
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,885
[audience laughing]

505
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,054
Why can't we ever get somebody this fun?"

506
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,433
But he's ours, so it wasn't that funny.
Know what I mean?

507
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,813
Like, everybody loves drunk dad,
but not when he's your drunk dad.

508
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:20,026
Like, "Your dad's great."
"Yeah? Well, he hits us, so I'm glad...

509
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,654
I'm glad you're enjoying this."

510
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,205
Democrats hate when you say that shit.
Liberals?

511
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,623
[audience member clapping]

512
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:37,377
People assume
all Black people are Democrats...

513
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,588
because we always vote Democrat.

514
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,382
[audience laughing]

515
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:46,469
But we don't really vote Democrat.
We vote not Republican, if anything.

516
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,888
[audience cheering, applauding]

517
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,306
You know what I mean?

518
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,561
We vote defense first.

519
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,187
[audience laughing]

520
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,982
We vote like the Baltimore Ravens draft.

521
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,193
Democrats are like condoms.

522
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,864
We'll use you, but,
you know, it doesn't feel good.

523
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,532
[audience laughing]

524
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,451
We're just trying to prevent
some other shit from happening.

525
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,622
That's why Black voter turnout's
always so low.

526
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,416
"Who would you rather have?

527
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,710
Old rich white dude,
or old rich white dude?"

528
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:22,547
I'm like, "I'd like to
just enjoy my Tuesday, honestly."

529
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,636
I didn't like when Trump was president.
I could be honest now.

530
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,889
-[woman cheers]
-[Che chuckles]

531
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,683
I can. I didn't like it.
It was frustrating.

532
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:36,853
Because he'd say
some nasty, ugly shit sometimes.

533
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,564
You know,
like, really, really racist shit.

534
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,442
And then right after that...

535
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,235
[sighs]

536
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,114
...he'd say something
that'd just touch my old Black heart.

537
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,949
[audience chuckles]

538
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,743
You know? He'll say something racist,

539
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,245
then he'd be like,
"The FBI be setting niggas up

540
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,455
and the media be lying."

541
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:58,207
And white people be like,
"No, they don't." I'm like, "Well...

542
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,293
[audience laughing, clapping]

543
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,212
He's not wrong.

544
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,549
Just the worst possible guy
to be right at this time."

545
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,594
It's like if Bill Cosby was like,

546
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,596
"The justice system's
unfair to Black men."

547
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,559
You're like, "Not for you. You can't...
We don't wanna hear you say that shit."

548
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,645
[audience cheering, applauding]

549
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,398
[chuckles]

550
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,319
That's not the only time
I got into trouble.

551
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,156
I did a thing
I didn't even know was a thing.

552
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,366
You ever do that?

553
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,662
It's called "dead-naming."
I'd never heard of it before.

554
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,581
But I made a joke
on Saturday Night Live...

555
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,253
where I dead-named--
I don't know if you know what that is,

556
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:48,132
but it's when you make reference
to a trans person's former self.

557
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,343
That's what I did.

558
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:54,973
I made a joke
about Bruce Jenner the track star

559
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,226
instead of
Caitlyn Jenner the race-car driver.

560
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,311
[audience laughing, clapping]

561
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:10,697
I called her a race-car driver
because she killed somebody with her car.

562
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,782
[audience cheering, clapping]

563
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,288
Caitlyn Jenner
killed somebody with her car,

564
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,041
and my joke was so bad,
America took her side.

565
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,627
[audience laughing]

566
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,715
Did you guys not know that?

567
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,801
Of course you didn't.
No one likes to talk about it.

568
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,679
They did a whole
Comedy Central Roast about Caitlyn Jenner

569
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,557
and nobody brought up
that she killed somebody with her car.

570
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,769
That'd be like if they roasted O.J.
and just stuck to football jokes.

571
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,354
[audience laughing]

572
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,940
That's not why
we know this motherfucker anymore.

573
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,026
[audience cheering]

574
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,278
[snickers]

575
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,322
They accused me of punching down.

576
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,952
If I can't make fun of rich white women,
who can I make fun of?

577
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,038
[audience laughing]

578
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,667
She was the 2015 Woman of the Year.
I wasn't even nominated.

579
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,879
How the fuck is she down?

580
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,926
I got in trouble for that one.
I learned my lesson too.

581
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:18,222
From now on, the only pronouns I use
is "this nigga" and "that nigga."

582
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,933
[audience laughing, applauding]

583
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,776
As in, that nigga Caitlyn Jenner
killed somebody with her car.

584
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,653
[audience laughing, cheering]

585
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,614
And I'll never forget it.

586
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,699
[audience applauding]

587
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,995
I could joke about it now, it's funny.

588
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:46,417
But at the time, it was not very funny.
I was... I was humiliated, embarrassed.

589
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:51,089
I felt terrible. I felt bad. They was
writing articles calling me homophobic.

590
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,382
I have gay friends.
I work with gay people.

591
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,844
I don't want that going around.
I felt terrible.

592
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,141
But I started to look into myself.
Maybe there's something I don't know.

593
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,311
Am I homophobic?

594
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,688
[high-pitched laughter]

595
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,357
[audience laughs]

596
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,652
When you did that laugh, I was like,
"That's a gay-ass laugh."

597
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:16,739
[audience laughing, cheering]

598
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:23,704
I'm kidding. That was a joke.
It was just... I couldn't pass...

599
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:32,588
I guess I realized how little
I understood about homophobia.

600
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,590
Like even on a base level.

601
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:39,679
I don't even know why gays get a phobia
and everybody else gets an "ism."

602
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,973
[audience chuckling]

603
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:51,107
If you don't like Black people,
that's racism.

604
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,734
If you don't like women, that's sexism.

605
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,113
If you don't like poor people,
that's classism.

606
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,991
If you don't like gays, homophobia.

607
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,036
I thought that was for
clowns and spiders and shit.

608
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,747
[audience laughing, applauding]

609
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,839
I looked it up, what a phobia was.
You know what it is?

610
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:18,176
It's an extreme
or irrational fear of something.

611
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,344
I'm like, "Okay, that makes sense.

612
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,598
If you're afraid of gay people,
that's extreme and irrational."

613
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,268
If you're afraid of Black people,
that's extreme.

614
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,021
[audience laughing]

615
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,777
It's not irrational.

616
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,326
If you're at a ATM late at night
and a Black dude run up behind you

617
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,078
and you freak out,
that's an extreme reaction.

618
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,247
It's not irrational.

619
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,916
[audience laughing]

620
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,543
Look, I'm Black.
If a nigga run up on me, I'll be like,

621
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,420
"Please be gay. Please.

622
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,340
Please have a lisp or something."

623
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,092
[audience applauding]

624
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,932
It's not irrational.

625
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,392
Why wouldn't you
be afraid of Black people?

626
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:12,063
All they do is tell you
to be afraid of us. Everybody is.

627
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,315
Cops are afraid of us.

628
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,818
These motherfuckers we pay to protect us,
they the most afraid of us.

629
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:23,407
Cops are so afraid of Black people
that I'm starting to believe in myself.

630
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,493
[audience laughing]

631
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,789
They think we magical or some shit.

632
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,750
We could be holding anything,
they' be like, "Put that gun down."

633
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,461
I'm like,
"These are flowers. What the fuck?"

634
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,381
"Yeah, they're flowers now.

635
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,218
You niggas are tricky."

636
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:47,556
I'm like, "Can I kill this nigga
with flowers? What the fuck?

637
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,892
What does he know that I don't know?"

638
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,688
Do you know how that feels?

639
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,857
For a motherfucker
to believe in you so much

640
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,279
that you actually believe
what they believe you to be?

641
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,992
I had an ex-girlfriend like that.
She was jealous.

642
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,370
Super jealous. She used to
always think I was cheating on her.

643
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,871
Even when I wasn't.

644
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,957
[audience laughing]

645
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,215
I'm not saying it's her fault
I ended up cheating on her, but she...

646
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,427
She gave me the confidence I needed...

647
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,721
[audience laughing]

648
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,393
...to meet other people.

649
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,938
I could introduce her to anybody.

650
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,773
Models.

651
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,985
Women I could not fuck if I wanted to.

652
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,989
She was like, "You fucking her,
ain't you?" I'm like, "I can't."

653
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,074
[audience laughing]

654
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,579
She'd go,
"I see the way she looks at you."

655
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,914
I go, "She do be looking? Oh, my God."

656
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,000
[audience laughing]

657
00:38:58,878 --> 00:38:59,962
[chuckles]

658
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,007
That's a stupid joke.

659
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,800
[audience laughs]

660
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,011
It's true, though.

661
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:12,058
We'd fight all the time.
We'd fight over stupid shit.

662
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,477
Just because I didn't know.
Stuff I didn't know.

663
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,355
I always hated that
she assumed that I would know things

664
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,440
that I couldn't possibly know.

665
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,817
I didn't know periods weren't fun.

666
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,404
It looks fun in the commercial.

667
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,490
[audience laughing]

668
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:34,789
I have sisters. They'd get their periods.

669
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,999
They didn't even call it a period.

670
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,751
They'd be like,
"It's my time of the month."

671
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,836
And I'd be like, "Okay, have a good time.

672
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,922
[audience laughing]

673
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,760
Can't wait till I grow up
and get some time for myself."

674
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,266
And that's all they'd say about it.
Nobody talked about it.

675
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,311
They didn't talk about it
the way I would if I got a period.

676
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:01,107
If I got a period,
it'd be all I talked about.

677
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,819
It'd be my excuse for everything. Like,
"Che, you're three hours late for work."

678
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,404
"Nigga, I got my period."

679
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,489
[audience laughing]

680
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:11,992
"We understand that,

681
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,829
but it's the third time this month
you've used that excuse."

682
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,207
"I played sports in high school,
my shit's irregular.

683
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,583
What you want from me, man?"

684
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,045
I'm all bloated and shit.

685
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,717
My girl get her period, man,

686
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,928
and she wouldn't even say
nothing about it.

687
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,056
She would just be suffering.
I would feel so bad.

688
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,891
I know she didn't wanna talk about it,

689
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,352
maybe she thought
she couldn't talk to me about it.

690
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,439
So I would try to say something
to let her know she could talk to me

691
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,400
if she wanted to talk to me about it,
like I'd ask her, I'd say,

692
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,735
"Hey, what are you,
on your period or something?"

693
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,821
[audience laughing]

694
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,865
And she--

695
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,701
Yeah, that's not how you do that.

696
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:58,330
She would get so mad.
"Why the fuck would you ask me that?"

697
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,958
"'Cause you're miserable?

698
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,461
And I would be too
if I was stuffed with cotton."

699
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,921
[audience laughing]

700
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,177
She made it seem like it was a dumb guess.

701
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,720
Like, it was a good guess.

702
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,807
She had her period for a week every month.

703
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:22,354
It's like a one-in-four chance I'm right
any time I ask that question.

704
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,689
[audience clapping]

705
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,399
It's not a stupid question.

706
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:29,195
If you knew that I smoke crack
for one week every month...

707
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,490
and then you see me outside
butt-naked in Timberlands,

708
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,533
trying to sell a refrigerator door...

709
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,411
[audience laughing, clapping]

710
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,413
"Che, are you smoking crack this week?"

711
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,915
"Why would you ask me that?

712
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,251
It's dismissive."

713
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,337
[audience laughing]

714
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,552
She called me toxic.

715
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,348
That's a rotten thing
to call somebody, right?

716
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,937
Especially if it's true.

717
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,105
[audience laughs]

718
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,901
She left me and I don't--
I miss her-- I don't miss her.

719
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,194
I miss...

720
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,613
[audience chuckling]

721
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,864
I miss...

722
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,035
I miss all the work that I put
into the relationship...

723
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,164
and now it's non-transferable.

724
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,333
[audience laughing]

725
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,709
You know what I mean?

726
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,505
Like when I date someone new,
she's like, "You never take me anywhere,"

727
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:34,343
I can't be like, "What about that time
I took my ex to her sister's wedding?"

728
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,428
[audience laughing]

729
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,641
I gotta start all over again.

730
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,060
I'm not gonna.

731
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,314
I'm not gonna start
all over again. I quit.

732
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,942
I'm just gonna be single
for the rest of my life.

733
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,360
I really am.

734
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,404
[audience applauding]

735
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,823
Just gonna grow old by myself.

736
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,576
I just bought a house
from a couple of lesbians.

737
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,746
I said that wrong. Can we do it again?

738
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,041
I just bought a house
from a lesbian couple.

739
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,127
[audience laughing]

740
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,339
We'll fix it.

741
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:19,847
It's a beautiful house upstate.
It's in the country. Upstate New York.

742
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,890
I'm really excited about it, man.

743
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:26,020
It's too white, though.
It's like the town is very fucking white.

744
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,980
It's so white. It's like...

745
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,774
me and one black bear, and that's...

746
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,067
[audience laughing]

747
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,527
That's it.

748
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,740
That is all.

749
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,743
I can't wait to meet this motherfucker,
to be honest with you.

750
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,871
Finally. Somebody I can talk to.

751
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,999
Somebody that's not gonna
cross the street when I...

752
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,710
He's gonna be so surprised.

753
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:53,255
Imagine when he sees me, he's like,
"Oh, shit, when did you get here?

754
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,799
Where's your fur?

755
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,802
This nigga got alopecia."

756
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,888
[audience chuckling]

757
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,895
I didn't know black bear was a species.

758
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,607
I had no idea that that was
a real fucking species.

759
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,192
Because we had a town meeting,

760
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:16,195
they said, "There was a black bear
sighting in the neighborhood."

761
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:19,114
"Just say bear.
You don't gotta be nasty about this shit."

762
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,200
[audience laughing]

763
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,495
They judge the motherfucker
for being black.

764
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,084
[chuckles]

765
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,589
I was scared when I found out
there's a black bear in my neighborhood.

766
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,966
I never seen no black bear.
I'm from New York City.

767
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,426
You ever seen a bear?

768
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,304
"Do I have to shoot this motherfucker?
What do I gotta do?"

769
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,515
But I found out what to do.

770
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,809
You know what to do
if you ever encounter a bear?

771
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:51,271
You have to make yourself really big,
and you gotta make a lot of noise.

772
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,274
Because a bear won't eat you
if they think you're retarded.

773
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,026
-[audience laughing]
-They would--

774
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,572
[chuckles]

775
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,414
[chuckles]

776
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,874
What if that's true?

777
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:15,045
What if you do that and the bear's like,
"Chill. Chill. Not him. Not him.

778
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,172
[audience laughing]

779
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,883
I'm not hungry no more.

780
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,636
Let's just eat some berries, man.
Leave him alone."

781
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,600
That's not a nice word to say,
I know. Uh...

782
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,395
But I only said it
'cause I thought it would make you laugh.

783
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,938
[audience laughs]

784
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,315
And it did.
That's why I did it in Oakland.

785
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,943
[audience laughing, cheering]

786
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,988
'Cause you guys wanna be woke,
but you don't know how.

787
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,910
I'm trying not--
I don't like to use that word.

788
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,912
I literally did it for a joke.

789
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,916
I don't like-- I don't like
that word as much anymore.

790
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,042
I'm learning a lot.

791
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,172
I got a nephew who's just diagnosed
with autism.

792
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,048
I'm really excited about it.

793
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,134
[audience chuckling]

794
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:07,014
I'm excited about it 'cause I didn't know
that Black kids could get it.

795
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,308
[audience laughing]

796
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,561
Did you? I had no fucking...

797
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:18,275
They don't really diagnose Black kids'
mental health, historically.

798
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,068
I don't know if you realized that.

799
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,653
They don't really diagnose us.

800
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,656
When I was growing up, there were
two diagnoses of mental health.

801
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,283
We had "crazy"...

802
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:29,495
and we had "Ain't nothing wrong
with that nigga."

803
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,580
[audience laughing]

804
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,085
And now we got autism,
and I think that's progress.

805
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:41,006
They're finally checking in
on Black mental health.

806
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,258
I'm sure I grew up with kids
that had autism,

807
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,593
but nobody called it that.

808
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,012
"Ain't nothing wrong
with that nigga, he just like to count."

809
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,096
"Uh...

810
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,098
[audience laughing]

811
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,309
I don't know if that's the whole story.

812
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,854
He's blinking an awful lot."

813
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:02,444
Black people know I'm not lying.
They don't diagnose Black kids with shit.

814
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:06,031
I got an uncle who's deaf,
we didn't know until he was 27 years old.

815
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,449
[audience laughing]

816
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,869
My grandmother's like, "Ain't nothing
wrong with that nigga, he hear you."

817
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,914
I was like, "I don't--
I don't think he does.

818
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:16,208
He didn't flinch."

819
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,882
Of course I know Black people
have mental-health issues.

820
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,970
You know how many Black girls
I dated that's clearly bipolar?

821
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,638
[audience laughing]

822
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,641
Walking around like, "Ain't
nothing wrong me. I'm just a Gemini."

823
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,101
You're like, "Uh-uh.

824
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,562
[audience laughing, applauding]

825
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,647
You need medicine, Keisha.

826
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:42,568
This ain't got shit to do with the moon.
You bit me."

827
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,653
[audience laughing]

828
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,121
Now we know about mental health.

829
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,707
That's why it makes me happy.

830
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,334
But it also makes me sad.

831
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,212
I'm like, "You know
how many niggas we could've helped

832
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,381
if we knew about mental health sooner?"

833
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:09,219
DMX was barking like a dog for 25 years.
Nobody said shit.

834
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,722
[audience laughing]

835
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,559
"Ain't nothing wrong with that nigga,
nigga just like dogs a lot."

836
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,150
Flavor Flav is 60 years old.

837
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:28,780
He wears a Viking helmet
and a clock every day.

838
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:31,992
That's not nothing.

839
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,494
[audience cheering, laughing]

840
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,130
You know where I learned
about mental health?

841
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,716
I realized this conversation
was open for everybody.

842
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:50,677
You know where I learned
about mental health? Sesame Street.

843
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,346
[audience applauding, cheering]

844
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,388
Yeah.

845
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,391
I did an episode of Sesame Street.

846
00:48:56,475 --> 00:49:00,854
And when you do Sesame Street,
they give you a tour of Sesame Street.

847
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:03,148
I was excited.
I was raised on Sesame Street.

848
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,901
Sesame Street almost taught me
how to read.

849
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,361
[audience laughs]

850
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,363
When I get there, the lady says,

851
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,783
"We have a lot of diverse puppets now
on Sesame Street."

852
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,953
I was like, "Yeah, I know, you have
Big Bird, a hairy elephant-- I get it."

853
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,956
She said, "No.

854
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,377
We have an African-American puppet.

855
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:26,129
We have a Latina puppet.

856
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,591
We have an HIV-positive puppet."

857
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,844
Yeah, I don't know how he got it either.

858
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,930
[audience laughing]

859
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:35,847
See--

860
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:41,103
Seems like a very strange
and avoidable thing to give to a puppet.

861
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,897
I didn't ask any questions.

862
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,734
But the whole time I was thinking,
"Who the fuck is raw-dogging puppets

863
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,278
on Sesame Street...

864
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,031
getting these niggas sick?

865
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,618
We gotta catch this motherfucker."

866
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,704
[audience laughing]

867
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:10,507
Then she goes,
"And we have our first autistic puppet."

868
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,176
I was like, "First?"

869
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,221
[audience laughing]

870
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,600
Well, "first autistic puppet"

871
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:24,730
implies that all the other puppets
are fine.

872
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,648
[audience chuckles]

873
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,443
I don't know if you remember
Sesame Street,

874
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,445
they got this one nigga named the Count.

875
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,613
[audience laughing]

876
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,618
He dresses up like a vampire

877
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,580
and just counts all the shit
in his apartment.

878
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,665
[audience laughing]

879
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,002
[audience applauding]

880
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,550
I'm not a doctor...

881
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,386
but I'm pretty sure

882
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,597
he shouldn't be allowed
to touch the stove.

883
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,891
[audience laughing]

884
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:08,648
Is it a good sign when the audience
is covering their face during a show?

885
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,484
[audience laughs]

886
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:14,362
I didn't know about mental health.
I'm learning about it now.

887
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,989
I know about crazy.

888
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:19,201
Now, crazy, I grew up with crazy.
I've seen crazy, growing up.

889
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:20,786
But crazy is different.

890
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,371
'Cause there ain't no medicine for crazy.

891
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:26,291
Ain't no compassion for crazy.

892
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,043
You know what you get for crazy?

893
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,169
A nickname.

894
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:33,048
And that nickname's
whatever your name already is

895
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,883
with the word "crazy" in front of it.

896
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,927
[audience laughing, clapping]

897
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,888
If your name is Joe, you're Crazy Joe.

898
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:43,642
That shit is not to help you,
it's to warn others.

899
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,146
"Crazy Joe's wearing
his trench coat in July.

900
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,815
Maybe we should cross the street."

901
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,948
In fact, the only time I heard the phrase
"mental health"

902
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,409
is when a white guy does something
fucking crazy.

903
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,956
Then you hear all about mental health.
I don't care how crazy that shit is.

904
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,333
A white guy could shoot up
a whole office building,

905
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,419
the first thing they ask on the news,
"What was his mental health?"

906
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:13,839
Bad! I'm gonna say bad.

907
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,215
[audience laughing]

908
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,258
Put the puzzle away.

909
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:19,344
This motherfucker
shot up an office he don't work at.

910
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,184
All the shootings and violence

911
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,520
that you hear about
in Black neighborhoods...

912
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,231
that make you so afraid of us...

913
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:35,443
you've never heard anybody
ask anything about mental health.

914
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,946
You've never heard...

915
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,489
[audience applauding]

916
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,490
It's true.

917
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:48,540
You never heard them on the news say,
"Two Crips shoot up a liquor store

918
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:51,042
after a long battle with OCD."

919
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,128
[audience laughing]

920
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:56,840
It's not supposed to be funny,

921
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,259
that's just what I think
a Crip would have, is OCD.

922
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:03,471
It's a grown-ass man who refuses
to wear anything that's not blue.

923
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,557
[audience laughing]

924
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,728
"Ain't nothing wrong with that nigga,
nigga just hate red.

925
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,313
Don't like his ears touched."

926
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,196
But now,
they're looking into Black mental health.

927
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,324
It's a fucking different day.

928
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,411
There was a tennis player,
Naomi Osaka, right?

929
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:29,122
[audience cheering, applauding]

930
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:35,003
She took a mental health break
from the French Open.

931
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,630
That's fucking crazy.

932
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,006
I never heard of that.

933
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:42,969
Simone Biles took a mental health break
from the Olympics.

934
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,680
[audience cheering, applauding]

935
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:52,854
I know you're clapping, but do you realize
how progressive that shit actually is?

936
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,940
[audience cheering]

937
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:59,361
You can't even take a mental health break
from the Special Olympics.

938
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,446
[audience laughing]

939
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:20,090
Niggas get mental health breaks now.
This is fucking awesome news.

940
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,425
Not just mental health, for anything.

941
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,260
We could be bipolar...

942
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,430
Didn't Kanye say he's bipolar?

943
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:32,102
He doesn't have to worry about
being attacked by a bear any time soon.

944
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,187
[audience laughing]

945
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,529
Niggas have anxiety now.

946
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:47,283
You know how white a lady
you had to be to get anxiety before?

947
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,369
[audience laughing]

948
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:53,415
Now I could get it too. Thanks, Obama.

949
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:57,544
[audience laughing, applauding]

950
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,214
This is an incredible time.

951
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,093
I know a nigga diagnosed with depression.
I'm so proud of him.

952
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,470
[audience laughing]

953
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,889
That's the most privileged disease of all.

954
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,685
White people hate when I say that shit.

955
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:17,147
I say depression is a privileged disease

956
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,607
because it implies
your life is good enough

957
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,359
that you shouldn't be sad.

958
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,445
[audience laughing]

959
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,658
[audience applauding, cheering]

960
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,496
That's not something Black people
could claim for years.

961
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,540
I don't know if you guys
are history buffs.

962
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,585
Imagine two slaves in a cotton field,

963
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,212
and one of them was like,
"Hey, man, what's wrong?

964
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,298
[audience laughing]

965
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,010
You seem down."

966
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:56,102
"Yeah, master says
I got seasonal depression.

967
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,813
[audience laughing, clapping]

968
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:04,861
He said these pills are gonna take
my cotton-picking blues away."

969
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,204
Imagine that. Right?

970
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:20,668
All these years in this fucking country,
400 years of bullshit.

971
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,421
And Black people...

972
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,175
finally have mental health issues.

973
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,345
What a coincidence.

974
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:35,850
You know why I think they don't like
to diagnose Black mental health?

975
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,937
'Cause then they'd have to tell us

976
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,731
what's making us so fucking sick
in the first place.

977
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,901
[audience cheering, applauding]

978
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,825
I don't want this show to end sad.

979
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,203
Don't you hate when comedy ends sad?

980
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,579
[audience cheers]

981
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,332
Feel like a fucking Lizzo post
or something.

982
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:01,835
[audience laughing]

983
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,922
[audience applauding]

984
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:11,386
I remember my ex told me something--
This is the last time I'll bring her up.

985
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,263
[audience laughs]

986
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:19,435
One time she said, "I can't expect
the thing that's making me sick

987
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,020
to make me better."

988
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,067
And, uh, I said...

989
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,944
"What are you,
on your period or something?"

990
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,655
[audience laughing, clapping]

991
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,036
All right. Let's cut it. Good night.

992
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,747
[audience cheering, applauding]

993
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,170
[cheering, applause continues]
