00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:37,341
Woo!

5
00:00:57,753 --> 00:00:59,711
Hello!

6
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:03,193
Where have you been?

7
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:05,500
People are already
heading to the next stop!

8
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:07,415
- Merry Christmas.
- Did you use your app on me?

9
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,417
- All me.
- Okay.

10
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:12,985
Miranda!

11
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:16,641
How did you know? I love
this scarf and this company.

12
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:18,730
Well, I know you like
sustainable fair trade.

13
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:20,341
And you're always freezing so...

14
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:24,127
I wish my ex paid as
much attention as you.

15
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:26,216
The best gifts
make you feel seen.

16
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,696
How is the app going?

17
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:29,567
Well, if only I could get my
gift-giving mojo

18
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:30,873
into it, you know?

19
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,048
I'm so sorry I'm late--

20
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,223
No! Fine. Forget it.

21
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:34,790
Why are we here today?

22
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,922
- We are-- -Mingling! Yes!

23
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:38,794
Woo!

24
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:40,883
Ohh!

25
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:43,146
Santa Claus! Santa Claus!

26
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,148
Yeah. I really needed this.

27
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,976
Woo hoo!

28
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:50,545
- What?
- Sheryl's here.

29
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:51,633
Who?

30
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:53,200
My head investor!

31
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:55,767
I have a progress
meeting with her tomorrow!

32
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:56,899
I can't look foolish.

33
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:57,900
Okay. Easy fix, compadre.

34
00:01:57,943 --> 00:01:58,944
Just hold on, okay?

35
00:01:58,988 --> 00:01:59,989
Mm hm.

36
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:09,825
Here we go.

37
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:11,914
- Okay...
- Voilà!

38
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:16,005
Now I really don't
look foolish at all!

39
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:18,442
Okay. I have to go and
pretend to be interesting now.

40
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:20,096
Just give me one minute.

41
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,184
You're gonna leave me
like this?

42
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:22,272
Yes.

43
00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:23,491
Okay.

44
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,019
Cute!

45
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:31,847
I look like Movember Claus!

46
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,848
No you fit right in here.

47
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:36,156
Wait 'til you meet
Santa's wife, Mrs. Claus.

48
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:38,549
Oh. Well, Merry Christmas.

49
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:39,681
Merry Christmas.

50
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:44,860
Paul... Paul.

51
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:48,429
Are you gonna put that away?

52
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:50,474
Yeah, I'm ordering a drink.

53
00:02:50,518 --> 00:02:52,911
And, you know,
our app isn't gonna fix itself.

54
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:56,350
Oh no, what going
on with the... Oh no!

55
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,004
Did you get shut down?

56
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:02,356
Mrs. Claus plays for your team.

57
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:04,096
Okay, I'll make you a bet --

58
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,490
if I get her number I get
my phone back.

59
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:07,839
Fine, whatever.

60
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,627
But you're going to have
to use your personality only.

61
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,978
- You're so annoying.
- That's what family's for, bro.

62
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:17,849
All right, time me.

63
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:18,676
Okay.

64
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,855
Come on, guys,
let's go. Let's go!

65
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,907
Hey! I, uh...

66
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,258
I didn't know
Mrs. Claus had a moustache.

67
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:38,566
Oh these are lip mittens.
It's cold in the North Pole?

68
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:41,743
Come on, Mr. Claus, you don't
recognize your own wife?

69
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:45,964
Nah. No, I mistook you for the
angel that fell from the tree.

70
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:49,881
Oh,
wow. Not on the Nice List.

71
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:56,540
- Uh, I ordered--
- That's mine! Sorry.

72
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:58,020
- It's yours.
- No, I insist.

73
00:03:58,063 --> 00:03:59,456
- I can't.
- Why not?

74
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,110
- Take it.
- You take it.

75
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:02,851
Please will you take the drink?

76
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:06,202
Oh, I'm sorry,
that's... that's our drink.

77
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:09,988
- Uh, I ordered this.
- Oh, so did we.

78
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:12,164
You all did. I'll be back.

79
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:14,254
Hey, listen,
we really need that drink.

80
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:16,517
I'm thirsty.

81
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:18,954
You're thirsty but
we're... celebrating!

82
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,651
- Oh, really?
- Mm hm.

83
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:22,914
Yeah, we're...
we're celebrating that...

84
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,526
we're going out... on a date.

85
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:26,701
We are?

86
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:28,703
She seems uncertain.

87
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:32,097
Well, maybe after
a credit check or showing me--

88
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:34,622
A lovely evening out.

89
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,540
Gentlemanly acts of
character, kindness and wit.

90
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:43,935
But we're mourning your attempt.
May your flirting rest in peace.

91
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:48,505
Good luck, pal.

92
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:51,769
You know I'm
genuinely intrigued.

93
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:52,944
That was easy.

94
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:55,947
The night is young and
my flirting ain't dead yet.

95
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,297
No, it's not.

Merry Christmas!

98
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:03,520
Do you know her?

99
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,479
That's my best friend.

100
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,089
Wow.
- She's awesome.

101
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:14,009
I'm smiling
underneath the beard.

102
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:15,706
So am I.

103
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,969
We could just take
the facial hair off.

104
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,536
Oh, why ruin the mystery
just yet?

105
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,842
We could be ugly
under here.

106
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,672
I uh...

107
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:28,328
I doubt that.

108
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:31,374
Where did
you learn moves like that?

109
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,507
<i>Dirty Dancing</i> was
the only DVD at summer camp.

110
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:36,336
Cute.

111
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,178
Please head to
the next Santa Crawl stop.

112
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:55,398
The last shuttle leaves in five.

113
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:57,182
Ooh! Where's the next one?

114
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:58,923
Let's catch
some air before we go.

115
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:01,970
- Merry Christmas!
Oh, excuse me.

116
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,799
Oh, our turn.

117
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:13,242
So do you believe
in destiny, Mr. Claus?

118
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,462
Ah, it's probability.

119
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:19,117
- Set patterns over time.
So romantic!

120
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:22,556
What about coincidences?

121
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:23,992
It's perspective.

122
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:25,689
You suddenly realize

123
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,648
what's been
in front of you the entire time.

124
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:33,349
What about you?

125
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,090
What's meant to be will be.

126
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,529
Oh!

127
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:42,184
Oh. Whoa! Careful.

128
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:43,925
Right? It's icy out.

129
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:46,275
Oh, candy canes.

130
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:50,279
Oh.

131
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:54,414
Thank you. You're not so bad.

132
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:57,112
How do you know?

133
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:04,206
So, tell me something personal.

134
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:06,469
Single father.

135
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:08,253
Seven-year-old.

136
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:10,125
Greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

137
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:11,256
Keeps me humble every day.

138
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,562
So cute.

139
00:07:13,955 --> 00:07:15,652
I've always wanted kids, too,

140
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,437
but I always pretend like
I don't.

141
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:19,439
Greatest fear?

142
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,136
Letting my parents down.

143
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:23,268
- You?
- Regret.

144
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:24,792
I've had enough of that already.

145
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:26,576
What do you want for Christmas?

146
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,708
This.

147
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,449
You?

148
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,582
More of this.

149
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,586
You better make
that Christmas wish.

150
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,565
I don't even know your name.

151
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:02,046
Yes, you do.
It's Mrs. Claus, silly.

152
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,922
- Oh, we're gonna miss
the shuttle! -Okay, let's go.

153
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:14,363
Oh my glove!

154
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:16,191
Oh, um, I'll be right back.

155
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:19,673
Oh, wait!

156
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:24,634
Wait!

157
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:27,681
No, wait!

158
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,379
No...

159
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,132
There you go. Thanks again.

160
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:16,207
Hey. Gift
recommendations are still off.

161
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:18,819
Yeah, it just needs
more data, lots more.

162
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:21,822
Well, we are running
out of Christmas, Paul.

163
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:24,564
And fields tests have already
started, you've got to go.

164
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,478
What do you think?

165
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:28,568
I'm posting on the Santa Crawl
page to find her.

166
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:31,353
"Looking for Mrs. Claus.

167
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:34,661
"We met on the crawl,
talked destiny and danced.

168
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:36,053
"I have your glove."

169
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,666
Okay, don't use
your own profile.

170
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:41,102
Why not?

171
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,625
Uh, people know your name,

172
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:43,931
anyone could mess with you?

173
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:47,021
Scammers, corporate espionage?

174
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:48,544
What if she's a con artist?

175
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:51,286
I mean who dresses
like a mustached Mrs. Claus?

176
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:53,331
Right 'cause, you know,

177
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,159
that's a political statement,
isn't it? Yeah.

178
00:09:55,203 --> 00:09:58,162
Uh, all I'm saying
is just be cautious.

179
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:02,776
Okay, so... what,
make a fake profile?

180
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:05,953
Um... yeah, like, Mr. Claus?

181
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:08,782
Why do I have to hold
your hand through everything?

182
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,480
Because you're five minutes
older and you're so wise.

183
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:13,917
Hmm, it's true, isn't it?

184
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,921
Okay, you gotta go.

185
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,707
Call me after.
Yeah.

186
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,407
<i>♪ Christmas, Christmas is here</i>

187
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,451
Hey.

188
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:30,064
Hey! Would you like to try my--

189
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,374
Hey! Would you like to try
the gift recommendation app,

190
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:37,506
Giftverse?

191
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:38,768
How does it work?

192
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:40,161
Giftverse analyzes

193
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:41,771
a person's social media account

194
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:43,120
along with other info

195
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:44,556
to suggest
the perfect gift.

196
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,776
Like that app,
the Present Ninja.

197
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,694
Oh, no, we don't
push mass-produced junk.

198
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:53,348
We actually link to local
businesses

199
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:54,610
and independent
artists.

200
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,307
High-quality gifts.

201
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:57,874
You just want to enter your name

202
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:59,659
and the recipient's name
right there.

203
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:01,878
I never know
what to get my sister.

204
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:03,706
Well, with
machine-learning algorithms

205
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,665
I might be able
to help you with that.

206
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:11,018
Oakwood exercise bike?

207
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,239
We still have
some bugs to fix...

208
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:17,024
- Uh hm.
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:20,767
You're not following the script.
Do... do you need a T-shirt?

210
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,813
I worked a summer in
college selling phones.

211
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:27,251
I usually start with,
"Hey, can I ask you a question-"

212
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:29,514
Can I have my phone back?!

213
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,429
This isn't our, uh...

214
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:34,084
Do you usually go around
plucking strangers' phones?

215
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,391
- Who are you?
- Who are you?!

216
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:38,741
Paul Dennis, Present Ninja CEO.

217
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:42,092
Oh, "Christmas
brought to you by..."

218
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:44,442
"Present Ninja,
the gift-giving app."

219
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:45,748
Let me ask you a question.

220
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:46,706
You ever get someone a gift

221
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:47,794
they didn't like?

222
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:48,969
No.

223
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:50,448
Okay, well, our app

224
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:51,885
is going
to disrupt bad gift-giving

225
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:53,190
using technology.

226
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:54,931
Sounds fancy.

227
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,454
It's actually
really complicated.

228
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:57,847
I won't bore
you with the details.

229
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:58,892
So thoughtful of you.

230
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:01,285
It recommends
the perfect Christmas gift.

231
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,463
No more returns, no more
stress shopping, just hot deals.

232
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:08,162
You get more for
less. You follow me?

233
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:11,208
Huh. Well, aren't
you a dumpster fire of tact.

234
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:12,819
Sample?

235
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:15,560
- Take it.
- No, I insist.

236
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:16,997
- It's yours.
- You take it!

237
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,650
- I can't.
- Why not?

238
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:20,087
- Take it.
- You take it.

239
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:23,438
Oh, thank you.

240
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,354
Mm!

241
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:29,052
Mmm...

242
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:31,272
Your voice
sounds really familiar.

243
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:32,752
Well, maybe
you saw an interview of me.

244
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,406
I'm Miranda McCauley.

245
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,625
Giftverse founder?

246
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,627
Your app rival.

247
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,368
I'm sorry. I thought you were--

248
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:43,545
One of your corporate
lemmings?

249
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:45,765
Wow, I'm getting
the you-don't-like-me vibe.

250
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,592
It's not personal,

251
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,029
you represent everything
I'm against.

252
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:49,899
What's that?

253
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:52,119
Pushing meaningless chain
store junk

254
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:53,598
instead of promoting
independent artists

255
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:54,904
and local businesses?

256
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,341
I sell affordable.
You don't know me.

257
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:59,517
I knew you the second you
slapped your ad on Christmas.

258
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:01,215
It's business.

259
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,826
- Gift-giving is more than that.
- I agree.

260
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,654
It's gonna be a hot day
in December

261
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,787
before you and I agree,
Paul Dennis.

262
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,137
Well, good thing it's
cold. Would you like a T-shirt?

263
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,095
Actually, you know
what? I'll take a T-shirt.

264
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:14,489
Mm!

265
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,058
- Merry Christmas!
- Happy Holidays.

266
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:19,102
See ya.

267
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,377
I know we all work remotely

268
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:36,250
other than these holistic
team-building exercises,

269
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:39,514
but I like to think
of Giftverse as a family.

270
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:41,777
So know that I am here 24/7,

271
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,867
even if you just need an ear
to talk to.

272
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:48,305
I'm here both as
your leader and spiritual ally.

273
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:50,873
- Thank you, Miranda.
- You're welcome.

274
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,527
Sheryl, hi!

275
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,529
Hi! Sorry I'm late.

276
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:57,271
I just got off the phone
with the other investors.

277
00:13:57,314 --> 00:14:00,840
Boutique Thrive has
made an offer to acquire us.

278
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:07,194
You're not actually seriously
thinking of selling to them?

279
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:09,500
No, no, no.

280
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,024
We're making progress!

281
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:13,156
Yes! The app no longer suggests

282
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,637
"Grandma, I get you lingerie."

283
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,118
No, but people are
using the app, Sheryl.

284
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:20,337
People are deleting the app

285
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:22,905
once they see that the gift
recommendations are off.

286
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:24,820
It's been months since launch

287
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,910
and the accuracy
has barely improved.

288
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,738
Okay, but we're so close.

289
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,696
Please. You know me.

290
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,089
I need the algorithms

291
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,743
to understand people
a little better.

292
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:37,746
Listen, it's not
personal, it's business.

293
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,405
I brought these over
from the house for you.

294
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:45,232
Oh, cute!

295
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:48,148
Agh!
What's wrong, Dad?

296
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:50,585
I can't get my holiday
kombucha anywhere else now

297
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:54,110
but that soulless e-commerce
juggernaut Boutique Thrive.

298
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:55,677
They're not so bad.

299
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:58,071
I mean, they're
committing to sustainable energy

300
00:14:58,114 --> 00:14:59,899
and shipping, so...

301
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:01,901
Any dates?

302
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,078
No one? Nothing?

303
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:09,952
Well, I actually met
someone the other day.

304
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,868
You did? What does he look like?

305
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:18,221
Uh, he's tall with a beard,
likes red, always wears a hat.

306
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:20,484
Maybe he's balding.

307
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:22,008
Mm, I don't think so,

308
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:23,792
but his hair
is completely white.

309
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,449
How old is this gentleman?

310
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:31,278
Oh, elderly, in a timeless way.

311
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,975
Listen, Mira, we always said

312
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,194
that you could fall in love

313
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:35,630
with whomever you like but--

314
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:38,067
It was a Santa Crawl, Dad.

315
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:40,200
Very funny, ha ha!

316
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:43,551
Maybe a Santa Crawl isn't
the best place to meet someone.

317
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:46,989
There's more to life than work.

318
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,512
Yeah, so...

319
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,907
My app was
acquired by Boutique Thrive.

320
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,256
It wasn't my choice.

321
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,562
Well, what...

322
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:55,302
what does this mean for you?

323
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:57,521
I work for a soulless
juggernaut now,

324
00:15:57,565 --> 00:15:58,696
I guess...

325
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,002
Or I could quit.

326
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:02,004
Hey, McCauleys don't quit!

327
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:05,094
All I wanted was to recreate
the same care and insight

328
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:08,010
that the local shopkeeper
would have like you guys did.

329
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:11,057
You know, promote the same
artists that we worked with.

330
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,277
But now Boutique Thrive
just swooped in.

331
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:16,758
Well, 'cause it's a great
idea, that's what they do.

332
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:19,935
They stomp on acquisitions
like a mindless child.

333
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,373
Times change and
our shop wasn't going to last.

334
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:25,767
Hey, maybe...

335
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:29,423
maybe you could, uh...
push for change on the inside.

336
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:33,644
You know, like a Trojan Horse
with good intentions.

337
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:37,257
- Yeah, we could help, too!
Yeah!

338
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,085
We could protest anything.

339
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:41,043
- Yeah, um...
- Your mom and I, we could...

340
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,176
we could chain
ourselves to whatever you want!

341
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:44,525
Like those trees!

342
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:46,440
Okay, yeah.

343
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:48,485
So I'm just
going to see how it goes first

344
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:51,140
and then I'll give you guys
a call... if I need you.

345
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,576
- Okay?
Okay.

346
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,406
All right. Rum and eggnog.

347
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,539
Okay, let's get
the party started!

348
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:00,367
- Woo!
- Yeah!

349
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:06,895
Thank you so much.

350
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,899
Ah.

351
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:14,598
What are you doing here?

352
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:16,252
Apparently you know as much as I do.

353
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:17,862
Good morning.

354
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,953
Hi. What are you doing here?

355
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:23,520
Good to see you too, Miranda.

356
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:26,741
Grant Boyd.

357
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:29,918
Boutique Thrive hired
me to oversee the process.

358
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,702
- Hey, how are you?
- Hi.

359
00:17:31,746 --> 00:17:34,227
Hey.
- I'm really good.

360
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:39,710
Do you guys...

361
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,190
know each other?

362
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,626
Yeah, well, we...

363
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,193
well, we used to...

364
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:45,803
a long time ago, but it was--

365
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:47,762
Yeah, we worked at
a start-up together.

366
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:49,416
Ah, right.

367
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:52,723
Hey, sorry... what process?

368
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,595
Well, as you know,
your two companies

369
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,423
have been
acquired by Boutique Thrive.

370
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:59,904
But what you do not know
is that they have now merged.

371
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:03,125
That makes no sense.

372
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,171
Why would
Boutique Thrive want two apps?

373
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:07,129
They want to corner

374
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,870
all the gift recommendation
apps on the market.

375
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:11,090
But that's
combining apples with oranges.

376
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,744
- Mainstream and a bargain bin.
- Water and a gas fire.

377
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:15,442
Charm and you.

378
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:16,834
Okay, uh...

379
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:18,923
You know what?

380
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:21,404
You two are going to be working
together as partners.

381
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:23,711
That's a good one.

382
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:24,625
Yeah.

383
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,323
Improve the gift
recommendation accuracy

384
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,716
so that we can release
an update

385
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,152
to target last-minute shoppers.

386
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:32,023
We're fine, we don't need to--

387
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,416
Yeah, my app works fine.

388
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,115
No, no, your apps don't work.

389
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:39,292
Otherwise, I would not be
standing here in front of you.

390
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:42,251
Boutique Thrive wants
an increase by 20% in buys

391
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:43,339
for last-minute shoppers

392
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:46,473
and you two are going
to help us reach that target.

393
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:48,953
So can you double

394
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:51,130
the gift recommendation
accuracy in five days?

395
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,568
- Uh...
- Phew...

396
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:58,137
Okay, well, that is
why we are here, team.

397
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:02,706
You two work together, use
your expertise and your data.

398
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:06,580
Which data platform are
we using? Uh, both, for now.

399
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,191
Do that and you'll
retain your positions.

400
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:11,759
Oh, and we're gonna
be unveiling both versions

401
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:14,414
at Boutique Thrive's Christmas
party on the 23rd.

402
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:16,198
- Uh, okay.
- Any questions?

403
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,548
- Yeah, yeah-- -Okay, great!

404
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,159
I'm pumped.
You pumped?

405
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:23,118
Go get 'em! All right.

406
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,467
See you.

407
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:29,646
So, where did that adorable
name come from, Present Ninja?

408
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,431
Oh...

409
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:33,215
Wow, you're the gift that keeps
on giving,

410
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,260
aren't you?

411
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:35,522
I'm a giver.

412
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:37,350
What can I say?

413
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:42,181
So, you ready to
collaborate... partner?

414
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,532
Gonna be so much fun.

415
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,580
<i>It's
a lack of data problem.</i>

416
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:52,408
It's not just about shoppers'
trends --

417
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:53,844
it's understanding people.

418
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:54,628
Trust me, okay?

419
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:57,500
I have five start-ups under
my belt,

420
00:19:57,544 --> 00:19:59,110
three e-commerce sites

421
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:00,721
and an Entrepreneur
of the Year Award.

422
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:03,376
Wow. So where's the trophy?

423
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:06,248
That's
not what I'm saying.

424
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:09,382
Hmm. Do you bring it with
you everywhere, show your mom?

425
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:11,862
I'm simply saying

426
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:14,169
that I have recognized
experience in this field.

427
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:17,346
Okay. Well, I actually
grew up in my family's shop.

428
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,348
So knowing customers and
suggesting the perfect gift

429
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:20,306
is in my blood.

430
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:23,265
Okay, so you're going to
personally figure out

431
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:24,658
each gift recommendation?

432
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,226
Mm hm. Oh, wow! It's...

433
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,098
beautiful.

434
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:34,581
And the Entrepreneur
of the Year goes to... Paul!

435
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:36,974
Yeah! Woo!

436
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:38,715
That's exactly how it went down.

437
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,196
Yeah. I'm sure. I'm sure it did.

438
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,894
Also know
his merger isn't my idea.

439
00:20:43,938 --> 00:20:46,027
Well, we both
have that in common.

440
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,116
- Where's the data reports?
- Right there.

441
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:50,684
Hey.

442
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:52,555
Oh, have we met before?

443
00:20:53,164 --> 00:20:54,557
I don't think so.

444
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:57,386
- I'm Miranda.
- Jackie.

445
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,693
Product manager
here. Wiser sister.

446
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:00,911
Hmm.

447
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,609
Hmm.

448
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:06,482
Okay, you said before
that finding the perfect gift

449
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:08,397
wasn't just
about business to you.

450
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,617
So what did you mean by that?

451
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,795
Everyone in tech talks about
disrupting,

452
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:16,318
but what about mending?

453
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:17,537
Hmm.

454
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:20,061
Elevating the quality of how
people

455
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:21,584
give and receive gifts.

456
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:23,673
That would
bring the world closer,

457
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:25,632
certainly the people I love closer.

458
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:31,725
So what now? Do
we start sharing?

459
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:35,206
Oh, do you... do
you want a T-shirt?

460
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:37,644
Huh? It's blue.

461
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:39,210
It's definitely your color.

462
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:40,951
This is going to
be a long December.

463
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:42,779
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

464
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:44,128
- Here!
- Thank you.

465
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,439
Oh, so they hired Grant as
a consultant

466
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:52,006
to oversee the merger.

467
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:54,487
Grant. Uh huh.

468
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:57,577
Do they know that you two...?

469
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,405
Okay, but you're over him

470
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:02,146
so just make sure you look
fabulous, okay,

471
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,974
and leave this guy in your dust!

472
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:04,845
Yeah.

473
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:09,415
- You are over him, right?
- Yep.

474
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,026
Miranda, no!

475
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:14,463
It was just easier when
he wasn't around, you know?

476
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:16,073
I thought he was the one, Erika.

477
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:17,901
It's not just something
you toss away!

478
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:18,641
We were perfect...

479
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,644
until we were
a complete disaster.

480
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:22,689
Thank you! Thank you.

481
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:26,040
You haven't been able
to trust another guy since.

482
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:33,613
What about Mr. Claus
from the Crawl?

483
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:37,660
Oh, it was magical.

484
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:41,664
We talked about
Christmas, destiny...

485
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:43,449
female mustaches...

486
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:46,843
So how did you not
see his face...

487
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:48,192
or get his name?

488
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:50,238
We were being so cute

489
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:52,762
keeping the Mr. and Mrs. Claus
thing going, you know?

490
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:56,418
Hold on. Hold
this. Uh huh, continue.

491
00:22:57,114 --> 00:23:00,161
I've just never felt
a connection so quickly before.

492
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,079
It was perfect, like everything
was supposed to happen.

493
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:06,994
Did you check
the Crawl's social media page?

494
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:08,474
Hm?

495
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:10,867
Okay! Okay, okay, okay.

496
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:14,349
"Looking for
Mrs. Claus. We met on the Crawl.

497
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,699
"Talked destiny and
danced. I have your glove!"

498
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:18,048
Do you think it's him?

499
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:21,356
I don't think it's a ransom
note for a glove, Miranda.

500
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,705
What's his profile pic?

501
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:25,099
Okay. Oh, it's empty!

502
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:27,797
- Fake.
- What does that mean?

503
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:30,147
It means he has
something to hide.

504
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:32,585
Okay, well, maybe
he's just being cautious.

505
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:34,587
Or maybe he's a criminal.

506
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,850
But you should
totally respond.

507
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:39,113
You literally just
called him a criminal.

508
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:42,159
Yeah, but what if he's
a really hot, charming criminal?

509
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:45,989
Make a fake profile,
too, if you're worried.

510
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:48,209
But this is a fun mystery.

511
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:50,341
You know, I didn't know I needed
this in my life.

512
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:51,081
Thank you so much.

513
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:54,781
I'm glad that my life is
entertaining you.

514
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:55,956
Really wonderful.

515
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:10,927
"Mr. Claus, thanks
for finding my glove.

516
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:13,539
"Sorry I left. Had to...

517
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:16,585
unexpectedly dash to
the North Pole for a friend.

518
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:20,023
"I had a magical evening..."

519
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:25,159
That was too
desperate. "I had a good time...

520
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:27,988
"Fun time."

521
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:32,732
Don't overthink this, Miranda.

522
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,823
<i>So why
the fake profile?</i>

523
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:39,173
Don't know yet if
you're on Santa's nice list.

524
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:44,352
How do I know you're not
really some 70-year-old man?

525
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:50,358
'Cause I'm the angel
that fell from the tree.

526
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:57,757
All right, buddy.

527
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,068
Play it safe.

528
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:07,506
"Why ruin the mystery just yet?"

529
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:09,725
<i>So now what?</i>

530
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:12,032
Let's pretend
that that night never ended.

531
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,471
<i>So what do
you do for work, Santa?</i>

532
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,038
What do you think I do?

533
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,997
I imagine
a clean-shaven predator

534
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:25,132
in a glass jungle fantasizing
of conquering the world

535
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:26,829
<i>with an empty in-box.</i>

536
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:32,531
Suppose so. I work in tech like
half the people in this city.

537
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,750
<i>I imagine
you're the type of person</i>

538
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:37,536
<i>who organizes their books by
color and cries during movies.</i>

539
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,626
I actually cry
during savvy commercials, too.

540
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:42,410
<i>Also work in tech.</i>

541
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:45,195
This is a very
important question.

542
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,806
<i>Is it cheating if you watch
a TV show</i>

543
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,242
<i>without your significant other?</i>

544
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:50,853
Definitely.

545
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:52,072
Mm hm...

546
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:54,814
If there was an Olympic
sport everyday activity,

547
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:56,555
what would you win?

548
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:58,557
Misplacing things.

549
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,082
I have a label maker.

550
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:03,692
Nerd.

551
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:06,129
<i>What about you?</i>

552
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:07,957
Accidentally killing indoor plants.

553
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:10,656
Well, I can help.
I've got lots of plants.

554
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:11,874
Plant dork?

555
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:16,009
is a hotdog a sandwich?

556
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:17,445
No.

557
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:21,928
Glad you have principles.

558
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:32,634
<i>You have no principles.</i>

559
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:35,376
Look, I had a single
mother and she could not afford

560
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:38,292
extravagant Christmas gifts, so
I want the gift recommendations

561
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:41,034
to be in reach of
single mothers like mine.

562
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:44,515
Accountability is my
principle, which you get

563
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,996
at scalability
with chain stores.

564
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,259
Okay, but
affordable junk is still junk!

565
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,566
We can do better

566
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,612
and support local businesses
at the same time!

567
00:26:54,264 --> 00:26:56,179
Wait, why are we here?

568
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:57,703
I need a tree.

569
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:59,574
So you double-booked
our meeting.

570
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,270
I'm busy.

571
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:02,882
This is the only
free time that I had.

572
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:04,144
- You're incredible.
- Thank you!

573
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:06,407
- Dad!
- Hey!

574
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,323
Thanks for
dropping him off. Hey, buddy.

575
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:14,545
Hey, this is Miranda. She works
with your dad.

576
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:16,199
Miranda, this is my son Ryan.

577
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:19,202
- Hello, sir.
- Hi. You can call me Ryan.

578
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:20,943
Oh! Hi, Ryan.

579
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:25,252
I bet these trees
aren't even sustainably grown.

580
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:29,691
But we're gonna find
a perfect tree, aren't we?

581
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:31,693
Yes, we are! You know what?

582
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:33,956
I'm going to find
you the perfect gift.

583
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,001
Come with me.

584
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,873
Let's see... Ooh!

585
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:40,571
- What about this guy?
- Perfect!

586
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,185
- Thank you, Miranda.
- You're very welcome.

587
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:47,143
Dad, I want to pick a tree!

588
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:48,971
Yeah, go check.

589
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:50,930
We need boots on
the ground to figure out why

590
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,105
the algorithms are off.

591
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:53,715
What does that even mean?

592
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,762
What about this one? Whoa!

593
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:59,416
Well, it's
a little crooked, bud.

594
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,462
Yeah.

595
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:03,377
Okay, listen.
I found the perfect candidate.

596
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,032
Veronica S. Prolific,
online reviewer, shops local.

597
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:08,382
We understand her gift-buying
habits for her family,

598
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:10,471
we understand
half of our demographic.

599
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:12,691
Okay, so what?
We follow her like a safari.

600
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,128
You're finally catching
on, Entrepreneur of the Year.

601
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:17,217
This makes no sense.

602
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,393
Okay, well, it's time
that we try something different.

603
00:28:19,436 --> 00:28:21,134
What about this one?

604
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:24,528
Wow! Yeah, it's a good
shape. This could be a winner!

605
00:28:24,572 --> 00:28:27,531
Yeah. Color's off, not fresh.

606
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,577
Okay.

607
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,971
You want me to
help you pick a tree?

608
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:33,233
Yeah.

609
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:34,495
Okay, choose any one here,

610
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:35,670
show me which one you like.

611
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:36,802
This one.

612
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:38,194
Good choice.

613
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:39,761
Let's check the trunk,

614
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:41,284
see if it's sticky.

615
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:42,895
No, Ryan, don't...

616
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:44,200
Ew!

617
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:50,163
That means it's fresh! Okay,
now let's check the needles.

618
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:52,774
They shouldn't
snap. Hold the branch.

619
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:54,689
See how it doesn't come off?

620
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,647
- Fresh!
- You got it.

621
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:58,301
You're a tree-picking
expert now!

622
00:28:58,345 --> 00:28:59,563
Thank you!

623
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:03,872
Thank you.

624
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:06,005
Veronica. Indulge me.

625
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:09,269
Okay. Got the tree, let's go.

626
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:11,401
Come on, Ry.

627
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:12,925
Uh, I'll just...

628
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:16,755
Don't worry about
me. I got it. Yeah.

629
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,287
- Hey.
- Hi!

630
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,158
Oh...

631
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:30,769
I just wanted to apologize

632
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,814
for the professional distance.

633
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,860
I didn't want to
show any favoritism.

634
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:37,253
- Wouldn't want to do that.
- Uh uh.

635
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,648
How's everything?

636
00:29:40,691 --> 00:29:43,085
Good! Great, yeah.

637
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:45,131
You look really, really happy.

638
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:46,523
You're glowing.

639
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:47,742
Thank you.

640
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:50,919
So how are you? What's going on?

641
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:54,662
Oh, you know, saving the world
one start-up at a time.

642
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:58,405
No, no. In all
seriousness, I am phenomenal.

643
00:29:58,448 --> 00:30:00,842
I love consulting,
coming in, helping businesses

644
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:02,583
with their acquisition
transitions.

645
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:04,237
Uh huh.

646
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,630
Look, I wanted to apologize

647
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:09,720
for the way
things ended between us.

648
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:13,463
You know, I really
hope things won't be weird!

649
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:17,772
Oh, no. That's like
years ago. I'm so over it, yeah.

650
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,643
Great! Whew! Yeah!

651
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:20,775
Okay.

652
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:26,781
Hello. Thank you, Mr. Claus!

653
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:30,524
I wanted to set aside
some time for update meetings.

654
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:31,699
Is this for me?

655
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:32,961
Yes, for you...

656
00:30:33,005 --> 00:30:35,572
update meetings on the progress.

657
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:37,096
Just you and
I. What do you think?

658
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:39,925
- I-- -No, no, no.

659
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:42,449
I'm doing
the same thing with Paul.

660
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:43,842
Also, uh...

661
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:48,411
Truffle or pumpkin spice?

662
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:50,152
Look you don't
have to do all this.

663
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:51,806
You know, you deserve better,

664
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,547
plus they're from
your favorite spot.

665
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,854
You know my weakness. Oh!

666
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:59,466
And they're also
a work expense write-off.

667
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:03,296
So, how's working with Paul?

668
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,691
Um... we're going on a safari.

669
00:31:08,692 --> 00:31:11,043
Yeah. I'm
excited. It's gonna be fun.

670
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:13,349
- Mm.

671
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,177
Okay.

672
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:26,710
So, Veronica,
how do you get inspired

673
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:28,277
for your Christmas Day shopping?

674
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:34,762
Okay, listen, are you guys
okay? You just seem tense.

675
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:36,329
Like you don't like each other.

676
00:31:36,372 --> 00:31:37,460
What?!

677
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:38,635
I'm sorry.

678
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,202
I just don't want you

679
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:41,769
ruining my Christmas shopping vibe.

680
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:42,639
- No, we're cool.
- Yeah.

681
00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:46,252
I so look forward
to hanging with Miranda.

682
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:48,602
Yeah, we're blessed. So fun!

683
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:52,823
Fine. Prove it.

684
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:54,651

Veronica!

706

These are all yours?
Yes!

707
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,332
How do you pick Christmas
presents for your family?

708
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,812
Well, I walk as if I'm
in the receiver's shoes.

709
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:10,466
Like my cousins are into fashion

710
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:12,947
so I check which influencer's
they're following.

711
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,775
Knowing that,
I see what speaks to me here.

712
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:15,602
Got it.

713
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:17,343
Also makes me
feel closer to them.

714
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:21,825
Okay, my aunt loves sweets
so we'll hit up a chocolatier

715
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:24,872
and my uncle's into vintage
books and I know this guy who...

716
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,528
What... is that?

717
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:36,275
- What did we learn so far?
- A lot, actually.

718
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:37,537
Really?

719
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,581
Well, if you were observing

720
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:39,843
instead of grinching

721
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:41,323
maybe you would have noticed.

722
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:44,283
Is that a smile I see?

723
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,067
- Ooh...
- What are you doing?

724
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,200
Looking for the fun.

725
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:49,897
You're worse than Jackie.

726
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,638
Fine. You want
a full Christmas spirit?

727
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:52,552
Uh hm.

728
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:54,989
Let's go. The wild
life's getting away.

729
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,382
Oh!

730
00:33:59,863 --> 00:34:03,519
Wow! One, two, three...

731
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:06,653
Why are you so
far apart? Closer.

732
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:07,567
Okay.

733
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:10,570
Ah! It's so cute. Aww.

734
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:14,269
- Hey!
- Hi!

735
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:17,011
So I'm double-booked
for a snowball fight meetup

736
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,145
0but I will try and
catch up for curling later?

737
00:34:20,623 --> 00:34:22,538
Mm hm.
- Sounds good.

738
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:27,239
Let's see this on you.

739
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:29,197
Okay.

740
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,247
Hey, you look...

741
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:38,598
- Never mind!
- Yeah.

742
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:40,730
Curling?
Yeah.

743
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:47,215
Hey, listen, this has been
a lot of fun,

744
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:48,608
but what are
we doing here?

745
00:34:49,348 --> 00:34:51,089
Veronica confirmed what I thought.

746
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:53,091
Which is...?

747
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:54,657
Okay, let me ask you a question.

748
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:56,398
What was the best
Christmas gift

749
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:57,878
you've ever received?

750
00:34:57,921 --> 00:35:00,228
- A basketball.
- Why?

751
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:02,709
Because I knew money was
tight and I wanted something

752
00:35:02,752 --> 00:35:04,537
that Jackie and
I could both play with.

753
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,452
- Okay, it brought
you closer together. -Yeah.

754
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:09,498
Mine was hockey skates.

755
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:10,760
I wanted to be a figure
skater

756
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:11,805
like Kristi Yamaguchi.

757
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,982
But playing hockey
with my dad was everything.

758
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:17,593
It brought us closer.
And I'm thankful for that.

759
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:21,815
The basketball is
your story, not demographics.

760
00:35:24,296 --> 00:35:25,253
To fix the apps

761
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:28,126
we need to understand
our customer story better,

762
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:29,475
their values.

763
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:30,519
We need to really see them

764
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:33,435
just like how Veronica
steps into her loved ones' shoes

765
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:34,654
to be inspired.

766
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:36,264
So it's a data problem,

767
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:37,657
like I said days ago.

768
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,311
No, you're not listening to me.

769
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:41,400
It's how we interpret the data.

770
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:44,229
It's an intimacy
problem but with our users.

771
00:35:44,664 --> 00:35:46,622
Okay, so I'll just book some
therapy sessions

772
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:47,797
for our apps then.

773
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:53,107
Listen,
I should be at the office

774
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,196
instead of
indulging in this field trip.

775
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,851
- I'm trying to save our apps.
- So am I!

776
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:00,636
Oh!

777
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:04,553
- Great, come here! -You're
really something tonight!

778
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:06,990
- Come here.

779
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:08,427
All right?

780
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,558
Ow!

781
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,517
Leave me alone, you grinch!

782
00:36:13,997 --> 00:36:16,304
So, how's working
together?

783
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,176
Productive!

784
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:20,047
Paul?

785
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,051
We... we actually
learned a lot from Veronica so--

786
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:27,141
Sorry, did we?

787
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,751
What are you talking about?

788
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:30,231
I'm really wasting my valuable
time

789
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,711
listening to her pontificate

790
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:33,060
about hippy-dippy feelings

791
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:34,235
instead of getting it done.

792
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:35,105
- Okay--
- Hippy-dippy?

793
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,717
Well, if the app
doesn't work right

794
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,850
in the next two days Boutique
Thrive will shut you down

795
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:43,113
and re-appropriate
your intellectual property.

796
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:47,727
So get it done or go
home for Christmas with nothing.

797
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:52,210
Okay!

798
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,690
That went well.

799
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:55,691
I thought so.

800
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,521
How's the merger going?

801
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,089
Oh, the app is still off.

802
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:04,396
Then listen better.
We taught that at the shop.

803
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,833
Mom, it's getting the app
to understand users' values

804
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:08,051
through photos and posts.

805
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:11,533
No, it's about letting them
do the talking, Miranda. Listen.

806
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:14,710
Well, the app needs to
intuitively ask without asking.

807
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:16,886
Ah! You're the psychology major.

808
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,935
Oh, and I also have to work with
this arrogant CEO, Paul Dennis.

809
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:23,545
Comes with the territory.

810
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:25,286
What?! I'm a CEO, Dad.

811
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,767
But you're
kind of a new-age CEO.

812
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:31,292
- Is he... single?
- Mum.

813
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:33,729
Just curious. Love is love.

814
00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:35,992
Is he... handsome?

815
00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:38,560
Never give in to
the establishment.

816
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:40,954
- Taking it to 'em, Dad.
- That's my girl.

817
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:46,481
How did you find
out about this place?

818
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:47,569
This pudding!

819
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:49,267
A friend recommended it.

820
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,531
- I'm hungry...
- Uh uh.

821
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:53,532
Mm...

822
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:54,924
Come on.

823
00:37:58,754 --> 00:38:00,713
<i>"Dear Mr. Claus,
thank you for the tip.</i>

824
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:02,976
<i>"My parents loved the pudding.</i>

825
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:05,326
<i>"Your homework now is to send
me your favorite movie list.</i>

826
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,762
<i>"I'll send mine.</i>

827
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:08,460
<i>"I'm having trouble at work.</i>

828
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:10,375
<i>"Wondering if you have
any advice</i>

829
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:12,420
<i>"A difficult
co-worker won't compromise.</i>

830
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:13,813
<i>"What should I do?"</i>

831
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:17,817
<i>"Dear Mrs. Claus,</i>

832
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,646
<i>"managing people is, in fact,
my specialty.</i>

833
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:24,867
<i>"Get to know this person bette,

834
00:38:24,911 --> 00:38:27,217
<i>"See where you both

835
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:29,089
<i>"of what you'll
bring to the table.</i>

836
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:30,830
<i>"I'm sure they'll soften."</i>

837
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,706
Hey! What's
going on. Where's Ryan?

838
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,142
I got a babysitter.

839
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:40,840
So we can concentrate.

840
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:41,710
That's too bad.

841
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:43,973
I actually like spending
time with Ryan

842
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:44,757
more than you.

843
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:46,933
Do you want to grab food?

844
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:47,977
Absolutely.

845
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,676
I do need
your help on something else.

846
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:53,983
Okay, so you have no inkling
on what gift to get them?

847
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:55,376
Just recently met.

848
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:58,379
All right, well, what do
you love about this person?

849
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:00,816
She's a firecracker.
She'd run circles around you.

850
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:04,342
What makes her happy?

851
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,865
She's a dreamer.

852
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:07,083
Thank you.

853
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:10,304
A romantic. An idealist.

854
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,349
Hmm.

855
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:17,529
Mm, she likes gardening.
Should I get her a shovel?

856
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:22,447
What's her style?

857
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,711
I... I don't know.
I respect her privacy.

858
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:28,844
That's okay.
I don't need to know.

859
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:31,281
It's... it's a little
more complicated than that.

860
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:32,370
See, if you offered me
more details

861
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:33,458
I could probably

862
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:34,937
recommend an actual item.

863
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:37,331
But from the way
you smile about her

864
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,899
I think you need to get
her a romantically clever gift.

865
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,770
You're right.

866
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:44,077
Anyone else
you need to get gifts for?

867
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,208
Relatives, anyone?

868
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:48,081
See, you just need to
turn me into the algorithm

869
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:49,212
then we're gonna be fine.

870
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:50,692
How big are you?

871
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:52,390
'Cause could
you fit into this phone?

872
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:56,176
<i>♪ We wish

873
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:58,047

Santa is calling us.

874
00:39:58,091 --> 00:39:59,179
Should we?

875
00:39:59,222 --> 00:40:00,310
Hmm.

876
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:02,922

885

So why'd
you start Giftverse?

886
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:46,139
Well, my parents
ran a shop for years --

887
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:49,838
stationery, gifts,
art supplies, all locally made

888
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:52,798
until chain stores
put them out of business.

889
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:54,147
I'm sorry.

890
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:55,975
Yeah.

891
00:40:56,802 --> 00:40:58,456
He's really good.

892
00:40:59,805 --> 00:41:02,068
[Miranda[ I know that era's
over, but why can't my app

893
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:03,809
connect people
to those same artists

894
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:05,245
just like my parents did?

895
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:06,855
You know, if
small sellers united

896
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:08,509
they'd be bigger than chain
stores

897
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:09,858
and drive down costs too.

898
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:12,165
Passion doesn't come
from an assembly line.

899
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,297
And it's not just
knowing what customers want,

900
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:17,344
it's knowing how to
find those unique suggestions.

901
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:20,478
You know, quality and cheap
shouldn't be mutually exclusive.

902
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:21,304
That's all, just saying.

903
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:24,220
I'm just trying
to be the equalizer.

904
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:25,831
What about you, though?

905
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:28,616
How did you come up
with that name, Present Ninja?

906
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,661
Ryan.

907
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,228
Him sneaking around like a Ninja

908
00:41:32,272 --> 00:41:33,882
trying to find
his Christmas presents.

909
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:35,275
Oh, I feel so bad.

910
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:36,755
I'm so sorry that I said that.

911
00:41:36,798 --> 00:41:37,843
Yeah!

912
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:41,499
You should feel terrible,
judging before you know.

913
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:44,240
So where's his mom?

914
00:41:44,284 --> 00:41:46,852
Yeah, she, uh...
lives across the country.

915
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:49,637
I got custody.

916
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:51,378
We got married
when we were too young.

917
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:53,467
A couple of years ago

918
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:56,078
she got him
a hockey stick for Christmas

919
00:41:56,122 --> 00:41:58,037
and he doesn't even play hockey.

920
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,734
And he was really confused

921
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:01,562
why she would get him a gift
like that.

922
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:05,044
So after that I thought
I should create an app

923
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:06,915
that would improve gift giving.

924
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:09,222
You know, elevate
the quality of gifts,

925
00:42:09,265 --> 00:42:12,355
you know, to match the level
of love we feel for each other.

926
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:14,749
I think everyone could use that.

927
00:42:14,793 --> 00:42:16,229
That's really sweet.

928
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:20,581
Hey, you should look
at our algorithm parameters.

929
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:23,889
Maybe you could give your gift
insight to help rematch them.

930
00:42:23,932 --> 00:42:26,587
You have access to our data.

931
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:29,459
Sounds good. Thank you.

932
00:42:30,286 --> 00:42:33,899
No problem. Hey,
do you recognize that one?

933
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:36,597
Frosty? Yes.

934
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:39,295
Okay, that's who I thought it
was. It looked familiar, right?

935
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:41,210
It's Frosty. Frosty the Snowman.

936
00:42:49,218 --> 00:42:50,219
Oh.

937
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:00,316
Sorry.
- What's going on?

938
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,057
Oh, nothing.

939
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:04,799
You wanna get out of here?

940
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:07,715
And go where?
We can walk and work.

941
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:08,977
Grant!

942
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,066
Come on. You're always
go, go, go.

943
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,415
So, let's go.

944
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:15,157
I'll grant you some Grant time.

945
00:43:15,854 --> 00:43:17,769
You're still
using that line, hm?

946
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:20,467
It worked on you, didn't it?

947
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:23,731
Yeah, unfortunately it did.

948
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:31,217
So, I need
your help buying a gift.

949
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,306
Oh! For who?

950
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:35,134
For my girlfriend, Kelly.

951
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:37,527
Hm.

952
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:40,182
Can you do
your gift genius thing?

953
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:42,968
Yeah! What do
you love about her?

954
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,798
Her energy! I mean,
we feed off of each other.

955
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:49,061
She's a personal trainer.

956
00:43:49,104 --> 00:43:50,192
Hm.

957
00:43:50,802 --> 00:43:52,368
Why are you giving me that look?

958
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:54,153
I'm not giving you a look.

959
00:43:54,196 --> 00:43:55,807
- Uh...

960
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:57,809
No look here.

961
00:43:58,331 --> 00:43:59,680
No? I don't know.

962
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:02,596
I mean, she's not
into tech or fine dining,

963
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,468
but, you know, she's trying.

964
00:44:05,512 --> 00:44:08,036
There's not a lot of
three-star vegan restaurants.

965
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,126
But we do a lot of
outdoor stuff, skiing.

966
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,999
She calms me,
she laughs at my jokes.

967
00:44:14,042 --> 00:44:16,001
Well, what does
she love about you?

968
00:44:16,871 --> 00:44:20,527
- All of me.

969
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,050
Yeah, nothing in there.

970
00:44:22,094 --> 00:44:24,400
So what is
it that makes her happy?

971
00:44:24,444 --> 00:44:26,141
Challenging herself.

972
00:44:26,185 --> 00:44:26,838
Hm.

973
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:30,015
And what's
your favorite memory of her?

974
00:44:31,146 --> 00:44:32,365
Uh...

975
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:37,500
Snowed in at
the chalet on New Years'.

976
00:44:38,414 --> 00:44:40,286
You took her to the chalet?

977
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:41,679
No I'm...

978
00:44:43,376 --> 00:44:45,987
The day she said, "I'm yours."

979
00:44:49,164 --> 00:44:51,427
- Grant, I don't...
- You know? Forget it.

980
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:53,386
I already have
something in mind.

981
00:44:53,429 --> 00:44:55,083
Why don't we hit up Sombrillo's
for a bite?

982
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:56,389
You always liked
it there.

983
00:44:56,432 --> 00:44:57,912
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

984
00:45:00,741 --> 00:45:02,177
<i>So Grant
has a girlfriend.</i>

985
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:04,179
She's a personal trainer.

986
00:45:04,223 --> 00:45:06,225
She is... vegan.

987
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:09,794
Sorry.

988
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:11,752
Oh my gawd, he's such a foodie.

989
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:13,275
What do they do together?

990
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:14,712
I don't know. He seems happy.

991
00:45:15,408 --> 00:45:16,626
See? This is great news.

992
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,498
He's moved on and so should you.

993
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,325
Yeah.

994
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,676
So we're really
gonna go meet Mr. Claus?

995
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,898
Yes! Come on,
Miranda, this is so exciting!

996
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:29,770
This is like
a game show prize reveal.

997
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:33,208
Behind door
number one is Mr. Claus!

998
00:45:34,035 --> 00:45:38,518
Or... like in a movie where
a spy just rips off his mask.

999
00:45:39,171 --> 00:45:41,303
What if he doesn't
live up to my expectations.

1000
00:45:41,347 --> 00:45:43,523
- What if he does?
- What if I don't?

1001
00:45:43,566 --> 00:45:45,351
Look, we have a lot
of fun just chatting.

1002
00:45:45,394 --> 00:45:46,744
You don't need a pen pal.

1003
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,529
That's true...
and he has my glove.

1004
00:45:49,572 --> 00:45:51,226
Okay, so we're
really going to do this.

1005
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:53,620
We're gonna go meet him.

1006
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:58,581
Okay, so if she's... she's
crazy or weird,

1007
00:45:58,625 --> 00:45:59,974
I need you to intervene.

1008
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:01,497
Okay, what's the signal?

1009
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:03,369
Uh... oh,
I'll scratch my head.

1010
00:46:03,412 --> 00:46:05,545
Okay, yeah,
that doesn't look weird at all.

1011
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:07,547
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

1012
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:08,940
Ugh!

1013
00:46:08,983 --> 00:46:10,245
Grab it, grab it, grab it.

1014
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:11,464
But it's wet!

1015
00:46:11,507 --> 00:46:13,422
Hey!
- Hi.

1016
00:46:13,466 --> 00:46:15,033
Why are you here?

1017
00:46:15,076 --> 00:46:16,164
Ahh...

1018
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:18,427
We... we were here first.

1019
00:46:18,471 --> 00:46:19,689
Why are you here?

1020
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:21,343
We always come here.

1021
00:46:21,387 --> 00:46:22,910
How come I've
never seen you here?

1022
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:24,042
How come I've never seen you?

1023
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:26,871
Do you always answer
a question with a question?

1024
00:46:26,914 --> 00:46:28,786
- Do I?
- Okay. Hi, I'm Erika.

1025
00:46:29,134 --> 00:46:30,962
Hi... Jackie.

1026
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:35,314
This is Present Ninja Paul,
the one I was telling you about?

1027
00:46:36,054 --> 00:46:38,970
Oh, yeah. Right!

1028
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:41,929
So what are you two up to?

1029
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:43,235
Um, uh...

1030
00:46:43,757 --> 00:46:45,628
Oh, well, he is
looking for--

1031
00:46:47,152 --> 00:46:48,980
Looking for what?

1032
00:46:49,632 --> 00:46:50,808
- Well, um... women.
- What?

1033
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:52,984
Just... women.

1034
00:46:53,027 --> 00:46:54,115
- Women.
Plural.

1035
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,943
Women.

1036
00:46:55,987 --> 00:46:57,510
Well, you found them.

1037
00:47:01,514 --> 00:47:03,168
Okay, this has been fun.

1038
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:05,213
So fun.

1039
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:07,085
We're gonna go,
though.

1040
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,130
Erika? Let's go.

1041
00:47:09,174 --> 00:47:11,176
Yeah, Jackie.

1042
00:47:12,481 --> 00:47:14,266
Bye.

1043
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:16,834
This is gonna be so
awkward with her here.

1044
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:19,358
Watch, he's probably gonna
ruin my night... just watch.

1045
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,188
No guy with
a glove. She's cute, right?

1046
00:47:33,111 --> 00:47:36,027
So did you know that Christmas
pudding

1047
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:38,029
was originally a meat soup?

1048
00:47:41,249 --> 00:47:43,034
I don't see
anyone here with a glove.

1049
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:45,732
Okay, hold on, all right?

1050
00:48:17,546 --> 00:48:19,809
No guy with a glove.

1051
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:21,681
Maybe he's running late?

1052
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:24,553
Yeah, yeah, it's only
been a... couple of hours.

1053
00:48:25,685 --> 00:48:27,426
Yeah, he stood
me up. Yeah, mm hm.

1054
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:32,387
She stood you up, dude.

1055
00:48:33,432 --> 00:48:35,564
I'm gonna go talk to her friend.

1056
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:36,870
You're gonna ditch me?

1057
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,089
Yeah!

1058
00:48:42,571 --> 00:48:43,703
Hi.

1059
00:48:43,746 --> 00:48:44,791
Hi!

1060
00:48:45,574 --> 00:48:47,228
- Hey!
- Hi!

1061
00:48:49,883 --> 00:48:53,278
Mm hm. Okay...

1062
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:04,550
Itchy?

1063
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:05,290
Uh uh.

1064
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:11,252
So after
the app works, then what?

1065
00:49:11,513 --> 00:49:13,298
- Oohh!
- Yes!

1066
00:49:14,473 --> 00:49:16,127
- Sorry.
- What do you mean?

1067
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:19,260
What, you don't have
like side hobbies or a passion?

1068
00:49:19,304 --> 00:49:21,088
Giftverse is my passion.

1069
00:49:22,307 --> 00:49:23,656
What's yours?

1070
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:26,311
- I want to find a house.
- Then buy one.

1071
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:31,620
Nah, it's... like the challenge
of a start-up is addictive.

1072
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:33,274
But most of those businesses,

1073
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:34,928
they don't do anything
meaningful.

1074
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,626
And I get bored and I jump ship.

1075
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,324
I wanna find something that...

1076
00:49:39,933 --> 00:49:41,326
that lasts.

1077
00:49:43,763 --> 00:49:46,505
I want to
create non-profit apps.

1078
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:47,680
Like what?

1079
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,813
Like an app that connects woman
programmers

1080
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:52,119
to female mentors.

1081
00:49:52,163 --> 00:49:54,295
Or even an app that shows you

1082
00:49:54,339 --> 00:49:56,732
where the best Christmas
lights are in the neighborhood.

1083
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:00,301
You know,
Ryan... Ryan would love that.

1084
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:02,825
Have you started any?

1085
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:07,004
Oh! Honestly,
I haven't had the time.

1086
00:50:07,874 --> 00:50:09,963
Ahh, just do it!

1087
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:12,313
Like that... see that?

1088
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:13,923
That.

1089
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,493
I jump ship all
the time, you just gotta jump.

1090
00:50:18,537 --> 00:50:19,712
I'll help you.

1091
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:23,150
See where you wanna throw?

1092
00:50:24,195 --> 00:50:25,544
- I got this.
- Visualize it.

1093
00:50:25,587 --> 00:50:26,849
I haven't got one in yet.

1094
00:50:26,893 --> 00:50:28,025
Feel it?

1095
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:29,200
Mm hm.

1096
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,028
Fire.

1097
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:35,554
Woo!

1098
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,338
Got it!

1099
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:38,861
I wasn't expecting that.

1100
00:50:38,905 --> 00:50:40,994
Come on,

1101
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,561
we're gonna go
look at the Christmas lights.

1102
00:50:42,604 --> 00:50:44,258
Wanna go... see the lights?

1103
00:50:44,302 --> 00:50:47,566
Your head still
itchy or you good to go?

1104
00:50:49,176 --> 00:50:50,656
Really? You're
gonna bring that up again?

1105
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:52,136
Unbelievable. Unbelievable!

1106
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:53,528
Too funny.

1107
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,059
So what do
you want for Christmas?

1108
00:51:02,624 --> 00:51:04,278
Just for Ryan to be happy.

1109
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,585
- Oh!

1110
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:08,369
Her!

1111
00:51:10,502 --> 00:51:12,243
- I dare you!
- No, I dare you!

1112
00:51:13,287 --> 00:51:15,768
One, two, three...

1113
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,084
Gotcha!

1114
00:51:44,536 --> 00:51:46,364
Okay, well, I better go.

1115
00:51:46,407 --> 00:51:48,540
We've got that presentation
tomorrow so...

1116
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:50,846
- Yeah, yeah.
- We gotta get to it, right?

1117
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,500
Erika? We gotta go.

1118
00:51:52,544 --> 00:51:53,980
- What?
- Come on.

1119
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:55,634
Oh, okay. Uh, I'll call you.

1120
00:51:56,635 --> 00:51:57,636
- Okay.
- Okay, bye!

1121
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:01,248
- Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Bye!

1122
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:02,641
All right!

1123
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:09,952
Come on, Jackie.

1124
00:52:33,976 --> 00:52:35,674
<i>Jackie and
Camilla have finished</i>

1125
00:52:35,717 --> 00:52:36,805
merging your data with ours.

1126
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:38,067
Great.

1127
00:52:38,111 --> 00:52:39,939
I think it's pinpointing

1128
00:52:39,982 --> 00:52:41,158
a person's style and hobbies
much better.

1129
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:42,159
Thanks to you.

1130
00:52:43,377 --> 00:52:45,771
Whoa. Okay, I'm
gonna write that one down.

1131
00:52:46,337 --> 00:52:49,340
That was what...
sorry, December 19th.

1132
00:52:49,383 --> 00:52:52,778
Miranda actually thanks me?

1133
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:54,127
Stop.

1134
00:52:54,432 --> 00:52:56,477
I'll just stick
that right there.

1135
00:52:56,521 --> 00:52:59,176
I'm just gonna
stick that right there.

1136
00:53:06,574 --> 00:53:08,054
Why isn't this working?

1137
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:10,883
Let me see.

1138
00:53:15,104 --> 00:53:18,499
There's one last trick
that I know. Just gotta...

1139
00:53:18,543 --> 00:53:21,285
No! Don't do that!

1140
00:53:21,328 --> 00:53:23,330
Just needed
a little manly touch.

1141
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:24,897
Caveman touch.

1142
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:31,904
Well, I think Grant will
be pleased with the progress.

1143
00:53:33,514 --> 00:53:35,560
You guys have a thing...?

1144
00:53:35,603 --> 00:53:37,126
Had a thing?

1145
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:39,738
Oh, I'm sure he'll be impartial.

1146
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,353
Um?

1147
00:53:46,832 --> 00:53:47,963
I have a system!

1148
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:50,618
Uh huh. What's
that, utter chaos?

1149
00:53:53,012 --> 00:53:54,622
This looks... a little
wasteful.

1150
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:56,233
I thought you were
a tree-hugger.

1151
00:53:57,103 --> 00:53:58,583
I recycle.

1152
00:53:58,626 --> 00:54:00,237
Mm... okay.

1153
00:54:01,673 --> 00:54:03,370
I'm helping you.

1154
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:05,416
- You've got to live
a little, Paul. -No, no.

1155
00:54:08,723 --> 00:54:10,508
Here, have a cookie.

1156
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:11,900
Oh, thanks.

1157
00:54:11,944 --> 00:54:13,728
Ah!

1158
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:17,428
Thank you.

1159
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:19,778
How good are they?

1160
00:54:20,735 --> 00:54:22,433
These are horrible.

1161
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:24,609
Just horrible.

1162
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,963
Okay. I gotta
head back to the office.

1163
00:54:31,006 --> 00:54:32,356
What are you drawing there?

1164
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:35,097
We're picking
a Christmas tree in the forest.

1165
00:54:35,141 --> 00:54:36,403
I'm an expert.

1166
00:54:36,447 --> 00:54:37,535
Oh, yeah?

1167
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,276
Does your dad wear
a suit

1168
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:40,451
to the forest?

1169
00:54:40,494 --> 00:54:42,235
He always wears a suit.

1170
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,150
Hmm, maybe he works too much.

1171
00:54:44,193 --> 00:54:45,325
You were leaving?

1172
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:47,371
Yes, um...

1173
00:54:47,414 --> 00:54:49,460
So, you know, if
the presentation goes well

1174
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:50,765
they're gonna have to name

1175
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:52,114
someone in charge eventually.

1176
00:54:52,158 --> 00:54:53,290
Yeah.

1177
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,030
I've been coordinating

1178
00:54:55,074 --> 00:54:56,510
with Boutique Thrive's
tech department

1179
00:54:56,554 --> 00:54:58,686
and they've
been hinting for us

1180
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,209
to nudge the gift
recommendations

1181
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:01,776
towards their merchant partners.

1182
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,647
Favor their products?

1183
00:55:03,822 --> 00:55:06,433
In an un-biased,
uh, very biased way, yes.

1184
00:55:06,477 --> 00:55:08,914
So they're seeing if
we're team players over Miranda?

1185
00:55:08,957 --> 00:55:10,481
I like her.

1186
00:55:10,524 --> 00:55:12,657
She's cool, little man.

1187
00:55:13,135 --> 00:55:14,136
Go and do it.

1188
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:15,312
Yes.

1189
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:18,445
Bam, bam,
bam! Slam, slam, slam!

1190
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:20,447
Boom!

1191
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:22,971
What, it's my thing?

1192
00:55:23,015 --> 00:55:24,364
See ya later.

1193
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:26,497
- Bye!
- Bye.

1194
00:55:26,845 --> 00:55:28,325
Don't start this.

1195
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:33,634
Oh, no!

1196
00:55:34,156 --> 00:55:36,333
No, no, no, no, no!

1197
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:40,337
Okay, okay!
Surrender, surrender.

1198
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,643
I have to go to work. You have
to go to the babysitter.

1199
00:55:42,687 --> 00:55:44,993
Come on, come on. Come on, oh!

1200
00:55:49,476 --> 00:55:52,523
Sheryl, I know
you care about vegan leather,

1201
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:53,959
ethical treatment of animals...

1202
00:55:54,002 --> 00:55:55,177
Yes!

1203
00:55:55,221 --> 00:55:56,222
What does it say?

1204
00:56:03,011 --> 00:56:04,012
Oh!

1205
00:56:10,628 --> 00:56:12,891
That accuracy
rate is not acceptable.

1206
00:56:16,547 --> 00:56:18,026
We've seen enough.

1207
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:21,378
Grant, wait. Just
give us some more time.

1208
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:23,858
I've been working
on Giftverse for years.

1209
00:56:23,902 --> 00:56:26,165
Just to be shut
down over one test?

1210
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:28,428
You guys didn't
double the accuracy.

1211
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:31,605
This debacle could hurt
sales more than help them.

1212
00:56:31,649 --> 00:56:32,998
Give us the weekend.

1213
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:35,087
Please. Sheryl, you owe me.

1214
00:56:38,786 --> 00:56:40,440
Let's give hem the weekend.

1215
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:42,268
Monday morning...

1216
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:44,226
but build off of
Present Ninja's version.

1217
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,402
What? Why?

1218
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:46,925
It uses the data better.

1219
00:56:46,968 --> 00:56:49,057
Pillage whatever
you need from Giftverse.

1220
00:56:49,101 --> 00:56:50,102
You're in charge.

1221
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:53,105
Miranda, I'm sorry.

1222
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:59,894
- We'll talk.
- Yeah.

1223
00:57:07,162 --> 00:57:08,903
Let's talk!

1224
00:57:15,606 --> 00:57:16,824
What's the plan?

1225
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:18,173
I'm shut down.

1226
00:57:18,217 --> 00:57:20,654
This is our app, together.

1227
00:57:20,698 --> 00:57:23,091
You don't need me.
Boutique Thrive doesn't care

1228
00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:25,398
about the right gift,
just percentages and sales.

1229
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,095
I care!

1230
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:29,489
Look, I'm naive to think
that I could change anything

1231
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:30,621
from the inside.

1232
00:57:30,664 --> 00:57:31,665
I'm just going to be

1233
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:32,971
a part of the problem.

1234
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:35,103
We determine the app, not them.

1235
00:57:35,147 --> 00:57:38,193
A working app is too valuable
for them to tinker with.

1236
00:57:38,237 --> 00:57:40,979
We'll promote the artists
and sellers you want,

1237
00:57:41,022 --> 00:57:43,460
alongside affordable, mixed in.

1238
00:57:44,286 --> 00:57:46,071
Mixed in?

1239
00:57:46,114 --> 00:57:49,030
Calm your righteousness,
okay? This is a victory.

1240
00:57:49,074 --> 00:57:49,814
Why would you do that?

1241
00:57:50,989 --> 00:57:52,556
You know, I would
hate to see the world

1242
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:54,645
miss out on
another pair of ice skates.

1243
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:56,647
I'm doing this for Ryan.

1244
00:57:58,823 --> 00:58:00,302
I need to do this right.

1245
00:58:04,959 --> 00:58:06,178
I need you.

1246
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:09,486
Can I trust you?

1247
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:14,099
That we're not just going
to be helping the same type of

1248
00:58:14,142 --> 00:58:17,319
business practices
that shut down my family's shop?

1249
00:58:17,363 --> 00:58:19,147
I know how much
this app means to you.

1250
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:31,638
Okay, let's, uh...

1251
00:58:32,073 --> 00:58:33,553
let's go do something fun.

1252
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:35,512
Yeah. I have an idea.

1253
00:58:46,218 --> 00:58:48,394
Yes! Perfect.

1254
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:51,702
Cool! Up you go!

1255
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,531
Yay! Woo!

1256
00:58:56,315 --> 00:58:58,099
This was a really good idea.

1257
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:00,885
Okay, one final little touch.

1258
00:59:04,062 --> 00:59:06,543
- Nice!
- Yay!

1259
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:09,067
Dad, I wanna play.

1260
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:10,721
Yeah, go play, go play!

1261
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:14,289
So what's your favorite
Christmas tradition?

1262
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:17,249
When my brother and I were
little, my parents used to hide

1263
00:59:17,292 --> 00:59:18,293
our Christmas gifts.

1264
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,558
But like really,
really hide our Christmas gifts.

1265
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:24,604
One year my present was
in the back of the freezer.

1266
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:26,171
My mom and uncle
did the same thing.

1267
00:59:26,214 --> 00:59:27,476
Really?

1268
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,130
Yeah, they made it special

1269
00:59:29,174 --> 00:59:30,436
even though
we didn't have a lot.

1270
00:59:30,479 --> 00:59:32,220
Aww...

1271
00:59:32,264 --> 00:59:33,831
Looks amazing.

1272
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:35,223
Keep going.

1273
00:59:35,267 --> 00:59:37,791
Jackie was super competitive.

1274
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:40,446
They would hide scrap pieces of
paper

1275
00:59:40,489 --> 00:59:42,317
with little riddles
as clues.

1276
00:59:42,361 --> 00:59:44,015
We got a gift treasure map.

1277
00:59:44,058 --> 00:59:45,799
How far did they make you go?

1278
00:59:45,843 --> 00:59:46,800
Up a tree.

1279
00:59:47,932 --> 00:59:50,630
A park,
a mile away. No joke.

1280
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:52,414
Okay, more hair?

1281
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,938
Hair!

1282
00:59:57,985 --> 01:00:00,814
One little final touch.

1283
01:00:03,904 --> 01:00:05,602
He looks like shocked!

1284
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:08,213
Oh, it's a he?

1285
01:00:08,256 --> 01:00:09,170
Yeah.

1286
01:00:10,302 --> 01:00:11,433
Are you just
gonna leave your scarf?

1287
01:00:11,477 --> 01:00:13,218
Oh, he seems cold.

1288
01:00:13,261 --> 01:00:15,133
He... is a snowman.

1289
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,136
Well, I knitted it so
I could just make another one.

1290
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:20,312
May be we tilt gift
recommendations

1291
01:00:20,355 --> 01:00:21,792
towards family activities.

1292
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:24,490
- Home.
- Home.

1293
01:00:25,665 --> 01:00:28,363
Maybe we need to
go back to my roots.

1294
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:31,671
Yeah. How good are
you with defending yourself

1295
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:33,499
from people with
strong opinions, hm?

1296
01:00:36,371 --> 01:00:39,157
I can charm anyone.

1297
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:42,943
Yeah, we'll see.

1298
01:00:45,163 --> 01:00:46,338
Look what I made!

1299
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:49,558
Okay, Ry, woo!

1300
01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:51,648
Ry! Ryan, yes.

1301
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,302
Weee!

1302
01:00:55,347 --> 01:00:57,349
- You're fun, Miranda.

1303
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,354
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay!

1304
01:01:02,397 --> 01:01:04,051
Hey, buddy! Hey, hey, hey.

1305
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,489
Miranda's family might be
a little strange,

1306
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:09,274
so just be polite, okay?

1307
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:11,406
I'm always polite, Dad.

1308
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:13,321
Are you polite?
Yes, you are.

1309
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:14,018
Okay, come on.

1310
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:17,238
Hello?
Hello?

1311
01:01:17,282 --> 01:01:20,241
Well... hello there!

1312
01:01:20,285 --> 01:01:21,808
You must be the oppressor.

1313
01:01:23,244 --> 01:01:25,333
- Hi.
- Hello, how are you?

1314
01:01:25,377 --> 01:01:26,726
Good, how are you?

1315
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,946
I'm very well, thank you.

1316
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,643
Well, hello!

1317
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:31,905
Hello!

1318
01:01:33,515 --> 01:01:34,778
Paul Dennis.

1319
01:01:35,387 --> 01:01:36,344
Miranda's told me all
about you guys

1320
01:01:36,388 --> 01:01:37,737
and your shop.

1321
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:39,260
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1322
01:01:39,304 --> 01:01:40,609
I'm Judy, this is
Michael, come in.

1323
01:01:40,653 --> 01:01:41,828
We're so glad to have you.

1324
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:43,134
Come on in, guys.

1325
01:01:43,177 --> 01:01:44,352
We've got lots of food.

1326
01:01:44,396 --> 01:01:45,397
I hope you're hungry.

1327
01:01:49,009 --> 01:01:50,054
Miranda!

1328
01:01:50,097 --> 01:01:51,229
Hi!

1329
01:01:54,754 --> 01:01:56,103
This is for you.

1330
01:01:56,147 --> 01:01:57,931
What is this?

1331
01:01:57,975 --> 01:01:59,367
I didn't use the app,

1332
01:01:59,411 --> 01:02:00,760
if that's what you're asking.

1333
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:02,370
It's an organizer!

1334
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:06,157
You're not supposed to tell.

1335
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,419
Sorry.

1336
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:10,552
It's a padfolio for your bag.

1337
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:13,555
Thank you. It's very sweet.

1338
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,079
Trying to buy her off?

1339
01:02:15,122 --> 01:02:16,820
Park the crusade, Michael.

1340
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:20,998
So, Paul, how many
people have you laid off today?

1341
01:02:21,346 --> 01:02:23,043
Okay, why don't we eat?

1342
01:02:23,087 --> 01:02:24,436
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

1343
01:02:24,479 --> 01:02:26,220
Yeah, I'm starving.

1344
01:02:26,264 --> 01:02:27,656
Yum, yum, yum.

1345
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:28,875
This looks good.

1346
01:02:28,919 --> 01:02:29,789
Uh huh! Dig in.

1347
01:02:30,921 --> 01:02:32,270
Wow! This
looks really amazing.

1348
01:02:32,313 --> 01:02:34,663
Well, Christmas
dinner is our specialty

1349
01:02:34,707 --> 01:02:36,753
and we expect
it all to be eaten.

1350
01:02:37,971 --> 01:02:39,103
Oh!

1351
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:42,149
Good.

1352
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:43,847
So, you guys,
you do this every week?

1353
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:44,978
Uh huh.

1354
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:47,024
It's like a chef's challenge.

1355
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:49,026
We pick produce from
the local farmer's market

1356
01:02:49,069 --> 01:02:50,767
and then we have to
come up with dishes.

1357
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:51,768
And I eat.

1358
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:54,683
You poor thing, how do you cope?

1359
01:02:54,727 --> 01:02:56,860
Well, they get to eat
whatever and look great

1360
01:02:56,903 --> 01:02:59,036
and then I have to
bike it off the next day.

1361
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:00,385
I bike too!

1362
01:03:00,428 --> 01:03:01,778
No way!

1363
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:03,214
That's so cool, where do you go?

1364
01:03:03,257 --> 01:03:04,476
My mainstay is the loop

1365
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:05,782
down by the marina.

1366
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:06,826
I used to do that.

1367
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:07,784
You bike?

1368
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:10,177
Yeah, yeah.
You been up to Baldwin Hill?

1369
01:03:10,221 --> 01:03:11,309
Of course!

1370
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:14,094
They finally repaved
it so the asphalt's grippy.

1371
01:03:14,138 --> 01:03:15,704
- No way.
- Yeah.

1372
01:03:15,748 --> 01:03:17,271
Well, you're
not what I expected.

1373
01:03:17,315 --> 01:03:18,229
Neither are you.

1374
01:03:18,969 --> 01:03:21,623
So, um... gift-giving?

1375
01:03:21,667 --> 01:03:23,321
Yes, as you know,

1376
01:03:23,364 --> 01:03:24,583
it's all about knowing
the recipient,

1377
01:03:24,626 --> 01:03:26,280
their story.

1378
01:03:26,324 --> 01:03:28,108
Well, the relationship
with the giver.

1379
01:03:28,152 --> 01:03:30,067
I mean, you guys are
basically matchmakers.

1380
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,938
You're essentially
doing a dating app, in a way.

1381
01:03:31,982 --> 01:03:34,071
You guys are doing a dating app.

1382
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:36,943
Yeah, gift giving is love.

1383
01:03:36,987 --> 01:03:41,078
It's giving a love of someone,
of a hobby, of a memory--

1384
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:42,862
Lots of lovin', Dad. We get it.

1385
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:44,864
You have to pay attention.

1386
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:46,605
People want to feel heard.

1387
01:03:46,648 --> 01:03:48,259
Feel seen by
the gifts they receive.

1388
01:03:48,302 --> 01:03:49,608
Well, sure.

1389
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:50,696
We used to ask people questions

1390
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:51,828
when they came in the shop

1391
01:03:51,871 --> 01:03:53,264
and we got to know them.

1392
01:03:53,307 --> 01:03:54,656
Won't be fully automated.

1393
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:55,875
Maybe you can't automate

1394
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:58,095
what has to come from the heart.

1395
01:03:58,138 --> 01:04:00,793
Like a questionnaire,
the answers are the story.

1396
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:01,838
Mm hm.

1397
01:04:03,187 --> 01:04:04,884
For example, what do
you love about the person

1398
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:06,625
or what do they love about you?

1399
01:04:06,668 --> 01:04:08,540
Yeah. Favorite memory of them.

1400
01:04:09,628 --> 01:04:11,412
Listen to your heart speak.

1401
01:04:11,456 --> 01:04:13,371
Instead of sizing someone up.

1402
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,244
Hm.

1403
01:04:17,288 --> 01:04:18,811
So who wants
s'mores for dessert?

1404
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:19,768
Yes!

1405
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,119
Ryan and I got this.
- Oh ho!

1406
01:04:22,162 --> 01:04:23,816
High five! Let's go.

1407
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,991
Okay.

1408
01:04:29,387 --> 01:04:31,911
Oh, I'm stuffed.

1409
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,394
So, Judy, what would
you like for Christmas?

1410
01:04:36,437 --> 01:04:38,004
Oh, I don't need anything.

1411
01:04:38,048 --> 01:04:39,136
Ahh, okay.

1412
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:42,617
You're that family member
who nobody knows what to get.

1413
01:04:42,661 --> 01:04:45,316
What if you had
to choose a gift?

1414
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:48,145
Well, I have
everything I need...

1415
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:52,889
but I guess it would have
be something that fed that need.

1416
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:56,153
Something that brought you together more?

1417
01:04:56,196 --> 01:04:57,023
Uh huh.

1418
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:00,940
They're having so
much fun over there.

1419
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:02,463
I'm missing all
the fun with Ryan.

1420
01:05:02,507 --> 01:05:03,900
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.

1421
01:05:05,336 --> 01:05:07,555
My parents love
doting over Ryan.

1422
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:10,558
Yeah, well, do not let
him trick you. He is demanding.

1423
01:05:11,298 --> 01:05:12,778
Okay, I'll be on guard.

1424
01:05:15,433 --> 01:05:16,782
This is perfect.

1425
01:05:17,739 --> 01:05:19,611
Yeah, it is.

1426
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:28,663
Do you have a charger?

1427
01:05:28,707 --> 01:05:30,927
Yeah, in my
office. Just over there.

1428
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,981
<i>I got you! And you too!</i>

1429
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:43,722
Hey, I'm gonna
join the festivities!

1430
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:44,941
Let's go!

1431
01:05:51,904 --> 01:05:53,427
<i>Oh!</i>

1432
01:05:57,997 --> 01:05:59,477
I'm so sorry!

1433
01:06:00,478 --> 01:06:02,045
Who's team are you on?

1434
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:03,568
We traditions here.

1435
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:06,310
We have our marshmallow
fight before s'mores

1436
01:06:06,353 --> 01:06:07,920
and Ryan here seems deadly.

1437
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,313
- You're on our team.
- Yes!

1438
01:06:09,878 --> 01:06:11,489
- Let's go!
- Wha...?

1439
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:19,845
He's the family!

1440
01:06:27,244 --> 01:06:28,723
Hey! You're my son!

1441
01:06:28,767 --> 01:06:29,855
- Yeah!

1442
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,345
Um...
Um...

1443
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:50,180
Ah, that was fun. Thank you.

1444
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:52,051
What do you say?

1445
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:53,357
Thank you.

1446
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,707
Aw, it was my pleasure.

1447
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:01,017
So we'll implement
those questions into the app?

1448
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,627
Yeah, the five --

1449
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:04,368
What do you love
about this person?

1450
01:07:04,411 --> 01:07:05,673
What do they love about you?

1451
01:07:05,717 --> 01:07:06,761
Favorite memory of them?

1452
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:09,112
Uh, what makes them
happy? And their style.

1453
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:10,200
Exactly.

1454
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:11,984
Merry Christmas.

1455
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,507
Will you come back and visit us?

1456
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,031
Oh, yeah.

1457
01:07:16,249 --> 01:07:18,034
- Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1458
01:07:18,338 --> 01:07:19,513
You too?

1459
01:07:19,557 --> 01:07:20,645
Bye, Ry.

1460
01:07:20,688 --> 01:07:21,820
Bye.

1461
01:07:21,863 --> 01:07:22,734
See ya!

1462
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:28,609
- Well, he's not the worst.

1463
01:07:28,653 --> 01:07:30,220
It was a great night.

1464
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:15,961
"Dear Ms. Claus,

1465
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:19,399
"I don't know why
you didn't show up that night.

1466
01:08:19,443 --> 01:08:21,227
"Hoping you weren't
just a fairy tale.

1467
01:08:21,271 --> 01:08:22,402
"Hope to hear from you."

1468
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:26,276
He was there.

1469
01:08:37,635 --> 01:08:39,158
What's Grant doing here?

1470
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,249
Hey.

1471
01:08:43,293 --> 01:08:45,121
Hey. Sorry to drop in like this.

1472
01:08:45,164 --> 01:08:47,645
Oh, okay. We're sitting.

1473
01:08:47,688 --> 01:08:49,995
Yes. I wanted to apologize.

1474
01:08:50,038 --> 01:08:51,518
I had to put Paul in charge.

1475
01:08:51,562 --> 01:08:52,867
Yeah, I understand.

1476
01:08:52,911 --> 01:08:54,913
No. Boutique Thrive wanted me to

1477
01:08:54,956 --> 01:08:56,741
push the Present Ninja
platform, too.

1478
01:08:56,784 --> 01:08:58,656
It was already decided.

1479
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:00,658
Why?

1480
01:09:00,701 --> 01:09:03,095
Paul is a... team player.

1481
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:03,965
Oh.

1482
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:06,446
But if you can get
the app to work

1483
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:07,839
that's a big cash-out.

1484
01:09:08,318 --> 01:09:10,058
Grant, I'm not
doing this for the money.

1485
01:09:10,102 --> 01:09:11,973
You could start
another app with that payout.

1486
01:09:12,017 --> 01:09:14,019
Or you could join me.

1487
01:09:15,499 --> 01:09:17,675
Really, work for you?

1488
01:09:18,328 --> 01:09:20,068
Yeah, come work for me.

1489
01:09:20,112 --> 01:09:21,331
It'll be fun.

1490
01:09:22,854 --> 01:09:24,203
You've got to start
thinking about your next gig.

1491
01:09:24,247 --> 01:09:25,944
- Engine slows for no one.
- Hmm...

1492
01:09:26,466 --> 01:09:27,772
It's an open offer.

1493
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:29,687
I thought
the engine slows for no one.

1494
01:09:30,514 --> 01:09:31,863
For you I'd wait.

1495
01:09:31,906 --> 01:09:33,517
That doesn't sound like you.

1496
01:09:34,257 --> 01:09:36,868
Look, uh, I want you back.

1497
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:39,784
You have a girlfriend.

1498
01:09:39,827 --> 01:09:41,177
I want you.

1499
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:45,224
I made the biggest mistake of my
life messing things up with you.

1500
01:09:45,268 --> 01:09:48,488
Well, what about Kelly?

1501
01:09:48,532 --> 01:09:51,578
You and I, we really
suit each other. You know that.

1502
01:09:51,622 --> 01:09:53,537
Yeah, I don't know

1503
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,365
how I'm supposed to feel
about this right now.

1504
01:09:55,408 --> 01:09:56,975
You don't have to say anything.

1505
01:09:57,018 --> 01:09:59,543
Just know
that I am here for you.

1506
01:10:01,849 --> 01:10:03,068
Yeah.

1507
01:10:03,677 --> 01:10:06,376
Well... you know what I think?

1508
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,206
I think that...

1509
01:10:11,381 --> 01:10:12,904
you should go
home to your girlfriend.

1510
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:15,646
Okay.

1511
01:10:15,689 --> 01:10:16,734
So...

1512
01:10:19,084 --> 01:10:20,564
We can forget
this ever happened.

1513
01:10:20,607 --> 01:10:23,131
Okay. I'll see you Monday?

1514
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:24,524
- Yeah.
- Good luck!

1515
01:10:24,568 --> 01:10:26,091
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1516
01:10:39,713 --> 01:10:40,758
Hello?

1517
01:10:43,413 --> 01:10:45,066
I've got to talk to you.

1518
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,419
I messaged Mrs. Claus again.

1519
01:10:49,462 --> 01:10:50,724
What, why?

1520
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:57,122
Well, there has to be a good
reason why she disappeared.

1521
01:10:58,341 --> 01:10:59,733
What about Miranda?

1522
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,431
What about?

1523
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:05,739
Um... you seem to really
enjoy spending time together?

1524
01:11:05,783 --> 01:11:06,610
We're working.

1525
01:11:07,698 --> 01:11:10,222
Oh, yeah, you're
just working. Okay.

1526
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,311
I can't have
her getting attached to Ryan.

1527
01:11:12,355 --> 01:11:14,705
And if I never meet Mrs. Claus
again I'll never know.

1528
01:11:14,748 --> 01:11:16,533
She didn't show up. Miranda has.

1529
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:19,753
But... hey,
she's too good for you.

1530
01:11:21,929 --> 01:11:22,887
Listen,

1531
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,716
I don't think we're gonna get
this new app build

1532
01:11:25,759 --> 01:11:27,326
done in time

1533
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:29,241
with all these
new questions added.

1534
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,330
It's a complete
overhaul, okay, in two days.

1535
01:11:31,374 --> 01:11:32,636
How do we solve this?

1536
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:36,553
Well, we could full-on
push Boutique Thrive's products.

1537
01:11:36,596 --> 01:11:39,120
They've hinted that the accuracy
won't matter then.

1538
01:11:39,164 --> 01:11:41,079
And plus it buys us a little
more time

1539
01:11:41,122 --> 01:11:42,646
until after the holidays.

1540
01:11:42,689 --> 01:11:44,735
But I know
that you promised Miranda.

1541
01:11:44,778 --> 01:11:46,084
So I don't think we should--

1542
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:47,303
Do it.

1543
01:11:48,173 --> 01:11:49,653
Just for now.

1544
01:11:49,696 --> 01:11:51,611
Alright, we'll
change it back later.

1545
01:11:51,655 --> 01:11:54,005
I'm not going to wase
two years over sentimentality.

1546
01:11:54,962 --> 01:11:56,181
Okay.

1547
01:11:56,616 --> 01:11:58,314
Thanks, Jacks.

1548
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:06,496
So Grant wants me back.

1549
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:10,543
Hmm.

1550
01:12:10,587 --> 01:12:12,328
I thought he had
a vegan girlfriend.

1551
01:12:12,371 --> 01:12:14,025
Maybe he finally
wants to settle down.

1552
01:12:14,068 --> 01:12:15,418
Maybe he's changed.

1553
01:12:15,461 --> 01:12:16,941
Oh!

1554
01:12:16,984 --> 01:12:19,204
That sounds really
bad out loud. Really bad.

1555
01:12:19,247 --> 01:12:22,686
Okay. Well, have
we heard back from Mr. Claus?

1556
01:12:22,729 --> 01:12:25,689
Yeah, he messaged me
saying he was there that night.

1557
01:12:25,732 --> 01:12:28,256
There was no guy with a glove.
I checked everywhere, Miranda.

1558
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,823
Okay, well,
maybe he's lying too.

1559
01:12:29,867 --> 01:12:31,172
Maybe he's a hot criminal
like you said.

1560
01:12:31,216 --> 01:12:32,260
I don't know.

1561
01:12:33,566 --> 01:12:34,915
I just actually
don't know anything anymore.

1562
01:12:34,959 --> 01:12:36,482
What about Paul?

1563
01:12:38,571 --> 01:12:39,572
Are we just going
down a list of names?

1564
01:12:39,616 --> 01:12:40,356
No! He seems cool!

1565
01:12:41,531 --> 01:12:43,228
And you guys had
a lot of fun that night

1566
01:12:43,271 --> 01:12:45,361
and why have you been
acting so cheery lately?

1567
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:47,493
You're just saying this
because now you're dating Jackie

1568
01:12:47,537 --> 01:12:49,365
and you want to do
a double-date wine tasting.

1569
01:12:49,408 --> 01:12:50,801
- No!
- Oh, yeah.

1570
01:12:50,844 --> 01:12:52,193
Okay, maybe once in a while.

1571
01:12:53,891 --> 01:12:54,892
I don't trust him.

1572
01:12:56,328 --> 01:12:58,417
You haven't trusted
any guy since Grant, Miranda.

1573
01:12:58,461 --> 01:13:00,550
I think it's time to
take a leap of faith, you know?

1574
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:03,727
Maybe you're right... again.

1575
01:13:04,902 --> 01:13:06,425
Okay, you got the chocolates?

1576
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:07,861
- Uh huh.
- Let's go.

1577
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:11,996
You guys actually did it!

1578
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:13,258
Woo!

1579
01:13:13,301 --> 01:13:15,260
- 86% accuracy.
- Woo!

1580
01:13:16,435 --> 01:13:18,916
Well, Miranda did it.

1581
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:20,744
Their team did all the legwork.

1582
01:13:21,222 --> 01:13:23,007
Uh, yeah we did.

1583
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:25,096
Bam, bam, bam! Slam, slam, slam!

1584
01:13:25,139 --> 01:13:27,272
Jacks, no.

1585
01:13:27,315 --> 01:13:28,534
You're awesome.

1586
01:13:28,969 --> 01:13:30,797
Ah, I love this energy.

1587
01:13:30,841 --> 01:13:33,452
I will let Boutique Thrive
know the great news.

1588
01:13:33,496 --> 01:13:35,933
Get this live immediately

1589
01:13:35,976 --> 01:13:38,414
and I will see
you all at the Christmas party.

1590
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:39,806
Alright? Huh?

1591
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:41,286
Ah, we'll party.

1592
01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:49,555
For you, Mom and Dad.

1593
01:13:53,516 --> 01:13:55,082
Hey!
- Hi!

1594
01:13:55,692 --> 01:13:56,910
We did it.

1595
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,912
Yeah, we did.

1596
01:13:58,956 --> 01:14:00,610
Paul, where'd you go?

1597
01:14:01,741 --> 01:14:02,786
Come on.

1598
01:14:04,048 --> 01:14:05,223
See you tonight?

1599
01:14:05,266 --> 01:14:06,137
Uh huh.

1600
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:09,967
Storm's coming
in. It'll be cold.

1601
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:11,621
It's a short walk.

1602
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:13,797
Hang tight.

1603
01:14:20,717 --> 01:14:22,980
<i>"Dear Mr. Claus,
I was at the bar that night.</i>

1604
01:14:23,023 --> 01:14:25,461
<i>"I waited for
you. Where were you?"</i>

1605
01:14:28,551 --> 01:14:31,597
Hey. That's better.

1606
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:34,339
Thank you.

1607
01:14:37,342 --> 01:14:39,126
I'll see you tonight.

1608
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:40,345
Yeah.

1609
01:14:40,388 --> 01:14:42,042
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1610
01:14:42,086 --> 01:14:44,784
Okay.

1611
01:14:44,828 --> 01:14:46,656
- Bye.
- Good...

1612
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,881
Miranda!

1613
01:15:38,664 --> 01:15:40,710
Ah!

1614
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:42,973
Larry Sosa.

1615
01:15:43,016 --> 01:15:44,801
Boutique Thrive CEO.

1616
01:15:44,844 --> 01:15:46,803
Wow, it's so nice to
finally meet you, sir.

1617
01:15:46,846 --> 01:15:49,675
Now do you have, um... a moment?

1618
01:15:49,719 --> 01:15:50,720
Yes, of course.

1619
01:15:53,374 --> 01:15:55,463
Paul said that you solved
the algorithm issue.

1620
01:15:55,507 --> 01:15:57,074
An expertise
from our background.

1621
01:15:58,205 --> 01:16:01,687
You know, Paul changed the
algorithm to push our product

1622
01:16:01,731 --> 01:16:03,341
so he would get
into my good graces.

1623
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:04,560
He did what?

1624
01:16:05,996 --> 01:16:08,085
But he didn't have to
because you figured it out.

1625
01:16:08,912 --> 01:16:10,783
I need people
who know what they're doing

1626
01:16:10,827 --> 01:16:12,872
to take this
app into the future.

1627
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:14,047
Not a 'yes' man.

1628
01:16:15,483 --> 01:16:18,965
I want you to be in
charge of the app going forward.

1629
01:16:19,749 --> 01:16:21,707
What about
favoring your products?

1630
01:16:21,751 --> 01:16:23,622
Oh come on,
come on, come on, come on!

1631
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:25,537
Gotta be a team player, too.

1632
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,800
Shouldn't we be
pushing the best gift possible?

1633
01:16:28,322 --> 01:16:30,063
We have the opportunity here

1634
01:16:30,107 --> 01:16:32,457
to promote independent
businesses and artists.

1635
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,851
Boutique Thrive is still
gonna get a cut from the app.

1636
01:16:34,894 --> 01:16:36,809
I know this is personal to you.

1637
01:16:36,853 --> 01:16:38,768
Can I keep
the app unbiased, Larry?

1638
01:16:38,811 --> 01:16:40,117
No.

1639
01:16:41,988 --> 01:16:45,731
Think it over
and, um... we'll talk.

1640
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:04,968
Miranda? Kelly!

1641
01:17:06,273 --> 01:17:07,884
Grant's girlfriend.

1642
01:17:07,927 --> 01:17:09,320
Hi.

1643
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:10,930
Listen, I want to thank you.

1644
01:17:10,974 --> 01:17:12,105
Oh. Thank me?

1645
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:13,890
I was freaking out

1646
01:17:13,933 --> 01:17:15,674
when I heard
Grant was working with you.

1647
01:17:15,718 --> 01:17:17,415
But he's
suddenly been opening up,

1648
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:19,243
showing me this
sensitive, caring side.

1649
01:17:19,286 --> 01:17:21,158
He's been a changed
man the last two weeks.

1650
01:17:22,115 --> 01:17:23,682
Has he?

1651
01:17:23,726 --> 01:17:25,292
I don't know what
you said to him,

1652
01:17:25,336 --> 01:17:26,163
but thank you.

1653
01:17:27,077 --> 01:17:28,513
Well, I...

1654
01:17:30,123 --> 01:17:31,298
Nothing.

1655
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:32,865
I guess Grant realized

1656
01:17:32,909 --> 01:17:34,388
how much he's truly yours.

1657
01:17:34,737 --> 01:17:36,347
I'm really happy for you guys.

1658
01:17:36,956 --> 01:17:40,830
Hey,
what are you two chatting about?

1659
01:17:40,873 --> 01:17:43,702
Just how silly you are.

1660
01:17:43,746 --> 01:17:45,182
I'm funny?

1661
01:17:45,225 --> 01:17:47,401
He's so funny!

1662
01:17:47,445 --> 01:17:49,752
I'm going to get vegan
eggnog. You guys want anything?

1663
01:17:49,795 --> 01:17:51,188
I'm fine, thank you.

1664
01:17:52,755 --> 01:17:54,670
You owe me like
a bajillion cupcakes.

1665
01:17:54,713 --> 01:17:56,019
- Miranda!
- Don't worry about it.

1666
01:17:56,846 --> 01:17:57,977
I made a mistake.

1667
01:17:58,021 --> 01:17:59,500
Seeing you again,

1668
01:17:59,544 --> 01:18:00,850
all these
emotions came rushing back.

1669
01:18:00,893 --> 01:18:02,112
Me too.

1670
01:18:02,155 --> 01:18:03,548
But then I realized

1671
01:18:03,591 --> 01:18:04,810
that they're just
memories.

1672
01:18:04,854 --> 01:18:06,246
Like a photo album

1673
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:08,031
that just
keeps all the good stuff.

1674
01:18:08,074 --> 01:18:10,033
Well, I'm sorry, again.

1675
01:18:10,947 --> 01:18:12,383
She's head over heels for you.

1676
01:18:13,514 --> 01:18:14,690
I know.

1677
01:18:14,733 --> 01:18:16,474
Be worthy of that.

1678
01:18:16,517 --> 01:18:17,693
I will.

1679
01:18:17,736 --> 01:18:19,390
- Okay, good.
- Okay,

1680
01:18:20,913 --> 01:18:22,567
Merry Christmas, Grant.

1681
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:24,221
Merry Christmas, Miranda.

1682
01:18:34,144 --> 01:18:36,059
You look stunning!

1683
01:18:36,494 --> 01:18:38,278
You promised me.

1684
01:18:38,888 --> 01:18:40,977
You said you wouldn't
push Boutique Thrive's products

1685
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,065
over the right gift.

1686
01:18:43,414 --> 01:18:44,850
I was making sure
that we didn't get shut down.

1687
01:18:45,372 --> 01:18:46,547
You used me.

1688
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:48,636
We can change it back.

1689
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,247
That's not the point.

1690
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:52,162
Here I am helping
the same profiteers

1691
01:18:52,205 --> 01:18:54,033
that shut down my family's shop.

1692
01:18:54,077 --> 01:18:57,471
It's business.
Get off your high horse.

1693
01:18:57,776 --> 01:18:59,038
You're ruthless.

1694
01:19:00,605 --> 01:19:03,434
I am not some corrupt person
that you have in your mind.

1695
01:19:03,477 --> 01:19:04,783
No, you're worse.

1696
01:19:04,827 --> 01:19:06,176
You've tainted my dream

1697
01:19:06,219 --> 01:19:07,568
and now I've let my family down

1698
01:19:07,612 --> 01:19:08,831
because of you.

1699
01:19:08,874 --> 01:19:10,267
Listen to me, okay?

1700
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:11,659
It was just the backup plan,

1701
01:19:11,703 --> 01:19:12,922
and we will change it back.

1702
01:19:12,965 --> 01:19:15,141
Not according to Larry.

1703
01:19:15,185 --> 01:19:18,057
You need to start trusting your
feelings and not your doubts.

1704
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:20,625
You're right. I should
have trusted my instincts.

1705
01:19:22,496 --> 01:19:24,455
You've lived up to
my expectations, Paul.

1706
01:19:25,151 --> 01:19:26,283
So have you.

1707
01:19:29,286 --> 01:19:31,941
Oh, they offered
me your position.

1708
01:19:32,942 --> 01:19:34,508
Well, you deserve it.

1709
01:19:34,552 --> 01:19:35,901
I'm quitting anyways.

1710
01:19:35,945 --> 01:19:37,076
I don't want it.

1711
01:19:38,469 --> 01:19:40,253
I'm not willing to
betray everything I stand for.

1712
01:19:40,297 --> 01:19:42,778
Then make it what you stand for.

1713
01:19:46,433 --> 01:19:48,479
Your jacket's in coat check.

1714
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:51,351
You know, you can step down

1715
01:19:51,395 --> 01:19:53,614
and act all high and mighty
about this

1716
01:19:53,658 --> 01:19:54,964
or you can fight for it.

1717
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,489
Like I said, it's business.

1718
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:02,101
Merry Christmas, Miranda.

1719
01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:14,810
I accept.

1720
01:20:14,853 --> 01:20:16,681
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

1721
01:20:17,464 --> 01:20:18,814
Let me introduce you.

1722
01:20:20,554 --> 01:20:24,210
Welcome, everyone, to Boutique
Thrive's Annual Holiday Party!

1723
01:20:26,212 --> 01:20:28,649
We have much to
celebrate and be thankful for.

1724
01:20:28,693 --> 01:20:32,871
Including the integration
of Present Ninja and Giftverse

1725
01:20:32,915 --> 01:20:35,700
into Boutique Thrive Family!

1726
01:20:38,355 --> 01:20:41,488
Now before I get
into my little speech here,

1727
01:20:41,532 --> 01:20:43,142
I want to introduce the person

1728
01:20:43,882 --> 01:20:46,145
who's going to be leading
the gift recommendation apps

1729
01:20:46,189 --> 01:20:47,016
into the future.

1730
01:20:47,886 --> 01:20:49,714
Miranda McCauley!

1731
01:20:52,195 --> 01:20:53,849
Thank you, Larry.

1732
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:56,677
- Merry Christmas, everyone.
Merry Christmas!

1733
01:20:57,156 --> 01:20:59,855
I'm humbled by this opportunity.

1734
01:20:59,898 --> 01:21:00,681
But, most importantly,

1735
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,859
I'm humbled by Boutique Thrive's
commitment

1736
01:21:03,902 --> 01:21:04,903
to the Christmas spirit.

1737
01:21:06,296 --> 01:21:07,732
I am pleased to announce

1738
01:21:07,775 --> 01:21:09,386
the Best Gift Initiative...

1739
01:21:12,084 --> 01:21:14,913
Boutique Thrive's commitment
to suggesting the perfect gift,

1740
01:21:14,957 --> 01:21:16,219
no matter the seller...

1741
01:21:16,959 --> 01:21:19,526
and to provide
users balanced options

1742
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:22,399
that promote local businesses
and independent artists

1743
01:21:22,442 --> 01:21:24,488
alongside Boutique Thrive's

1744
01:21:24,531 --> 01:21:26,055
always affordable
merchandise!

1745
01:21:26,098 --> 01:21:27,056
Woo!

1746
01:21:27,839 --> 01:21:28,709
What are you doing?

1747
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,756
All thanks to
the vision of Larry here!

1748
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:36,108
Those are my terms.

1749
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:39,242
We all know
that gift giving is about love.

1750
01:21:41,548 --> 01:21:43,768
But I've learned
that it's more than just that.

1751
01:21:47,293 --> 01:21:50,906
It's about trusting and opening
up our lives to one another.

1752
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,304
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

1753
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,046
Merry Christmas.

1754
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:14,668
Wow, what a speech!

1755
01:22:14,712 --> 01:22:15,931
Thank you, Miranda.

1756
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:19,456
Wow!

1757
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:35,298
Hey! Here's
an article in Italian!

1758
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,648
Look at that!

1759
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:40,303
Your dad's been
saving all the online articles

1760
01:22:40,346 --> 01:22:41,869
on your initiative speech.

1761
01:22:41,913 --> 01:22:43,871
He keeps finding
new ones for his archive.

1762
01:22:43,915 --> 01:22:48,964
Yeah, well... she did what
we could never do with our shop.

1763
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:51,096
You won.

1764
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:52,271
Thank you.

1765
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:55,492
And we're still
available if you need to boycott

1766
01:22:55,535 --> 01:22:56,580
or protest in the buff.

1767
01:22:56,623 --> 01:22:57,798
Oh, yeah.

1768
01:22:57,842 --> 01:22:58,974
I got it, Dad.

1769
01:23:00,192 --> 01:23:01,324
How about Paul?

1770
01:23:02,325 --> 01:23:03,152
What about him?

1771
01:23:04,457 --> 01:23:06,068
He's got a good arm
for marshmallow fights.

1772
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:07,156
Ow!

1773
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:09,506
Well, he... he let me down.

1774
01:23:11,377 --> 01:23:12,683
I'm sorry to hear that.

1775
01:23:13,684 --> 01:23:16,513
Anyway. Stuff
your face for me, Dad!

1776
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,298
If I must.

1777
01:23:19,342 --> 01:23:20,473
Come on.

1778
01:23:27,263 --> 01:23:29,004
So how are things with Jackie?

1779
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:31,310
Well, if you must know,

1780
01:23:31,354 --> 01:23:33,095
we're going on a Christmas Eve

1781
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:34,487
Santa Crawl
tonight if you want to join?

1782
01:23:34,531 --> 01:23:35,662
Definitely not.

1783
01:23:35,706 --> 01:23:36,881
Okay.

1784
01:23:36,924 --> 01:23:38,491
- Milk?
- Yes.

1785
01:23:42,887 --> 01:23:43,975
Don't ask.

1786
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,063
I wasn't.

1787
01:23:45,107 --> 01:23:46,760
- Sugar?
- Yes.

1788
01:23:46,804 --> 01:23:48,371
But really, come on, Miranda!

1789
01:23:50,068 --> 01:23:51,852
He lied to me, Erika.

1790
01:23:52,114 --> 01:23:53,550
He promised me.

1791
01:23:55,073 --> 01:23:57,075
He was fighting for you,
just not in the way you wanted.

1792
01:23:58,294 --> 01:24:01,601
People surprise you, Miranda.
You just need to let them.

1793
01:24:02,385 --> 01:24:04,735
And you had feelings
for the guy, too --twice!

1794
01:24:05,518 --> 01:24:06,563
Right?

1795
01:24:09,566 --> 01:24:10,828
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

1796
01:24:11,437 --> 01:24:12,525
Did you send me a gift
or something,

1797
01:24:12,569 --> 01:24:13,222
or did Aunt Kathy?

1798
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:15,311
Well, I got a present
in the mail

1799
01:24:15,354 --> 01:24:16,225
but there's no tag.

1800
01:24:17,704 --> 01:24:20,403
The return address
says "The North Pole."

1801
01:24:22,753 --> 01:24:24,537
Yeah, okay, I'll see you at 7.

1802
01:24:33,938 --> 01:24:36,767
"The app suggested a cake
tester to use with your mom."

1803
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:40,945
What?

1804
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:47,256
"The app suggested bolt
cutters to use with your dad."

1805
01:24:51,738 --> 01:24:52,783
What?

1806
01:25:12,063 --> 01:25:14,892
Okay, that's
a nine. What's this one?

1807
01:25:14,935 --> 01:25:16,285
Ten.

1808
01:25:16,328 --> 01:25:18,287
A ten? That can't be a ten.

1809
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:19,375
What about this one?

1810
01:25:19,418 --> 01:25:20,506
Ten!

1811
01:25:20,898 --> 01:25:22,204
What about this one?

1812
01:25:22,813 --> 01:25:24,423
- Ten.
- That's also a ten?

1813
01:25:31,256 --> 01:25:32,127
This one?

1814
01:25:32,562 --> 01:25:33,780
Ten.

1815
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:35,391
Another ten.

1816
01:25:35,913 --> 01:25:37,741
Wow! Okay,
this is a good street.

1817
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:40,135
Merry Christmas, Dad.

1818
01:25:40,178 --> 01:25:41,179
Merry Christmas.

1819
01:25:42,572 --> 01:25:44,139
Did you tell Santa
what you wanted for Christmas?

1820
01:25:44,182 --> 01:25:47,142
I did. But I already got you.

1821
01:25:47,838 --> 01:25:49,492
I'm not a present.

1822
01:25:50,797 --> 01:25:52,016
Miranda!

1823
01:25:53,452 --> 01:25:55,150
Hi!

1824
01:25:58,805 --> 01:26:00,938
Part of me
always knew it was you.

1825
01:26:00,981 --> 01:26:02,157
You did?

1826
01:26:03,549 --> 01:26:05,160
What's meant to be will be.

1827
01:26:06,335 --> 01:26:08,119
I thought
you didn't believe in destiny.

1828
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,164
I don't.

1829
01:26:09,903 --> 01:26:11,253
I believe in you.

1830
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:16,171
Well, I found this
in your jacket pocket.

1831
01:26:17,824 --> 01:26:19,522
And I got your gift.

1832
01:26:19,565 --> 01:26:21,219
Did you use the app on me?

1833
01:26:21,263 --> 01:26:22,742
Nah, the skates were all me.

1834
01:26:22,786 --> 01:26:24,353
Romantically clever.

1835
01:26:25,615 --> 01:26:28,487
I realized that it's
best to listen to the heart.

1836
01:26:30,576 --> 01:26:32,317
Can I make snow angels, Dad?

1837
01:26:32,361 --> 01:26:33,362
Yeah, sure, bud.

1838
01:26:36,495 --> 01:26:38,236
Hey, look, I'm sorry
that I changed the app

1839
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,324
without asking you.

1840
01:26:39,368 --> 01:26:40,586
You were right.

1841
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:41,674
I should have stepped up

1842
01:26:41,718 --> 01:26:43,241
instead of stepping out.

1843
01:26:43,285 --> 01:26:45,156
And my publicity
stunt forced their hand.

1844
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,854
I got full control,
at least for awhile.

1845
01:26:47,898 --> 01:26:50,335
Well, it's enough time
to prove to them your ideas.

1846
01:26:50,379 --> 01:26:52,337
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

1847
01:26:52,381 --> 01:26:55,427
I just... I was so
worried about what might happen

1848
01:26:55,471 --> 01:26:57,255
I didn't even
consider what could be.

1849
01:26:58,082 --> 01:27:00,215
Hey, I need help
finding a Christmas gift.

1850
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:03,740
Five questions, that's all I need.

1851
01:27:05,176 --> 01:27:06,743
What do you love
about this person?

1852
01:27:07,787 --> 01:27:10,921
She's witty, she's charming...

1853
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:13,402
she always pushes me.

1854
01:27:14,403 --> 01:27:15,926
What does she love about you?

1855
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:18,929
My stubbornness.

1856
01:27:19,364 --> 01:27:20,409
Are sure?

1857
01:27:20,452 --> 01:27:21,758
It's mutual.

1858
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,586
What makes her happy?

1859
01:27:24,326 --> 01:27:25,762
Making others happy.

1860
01:27:26,763 --> 01:27:27,764
What's her style?

1861
01:27:28,982 --> 01:27:30,419
What I'm missing.

1862
01:27:31,724 --> 01:27:33,117
Favorite memory of her?

1863
01:27:34,292 --> 01:27:35,598
The next one.

1864
01:27:37,077 --> 01:27:38,383
What does she want?

1865
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,429
To jump.

1866
01:27:42,082 --> 01:27:43,258
Me too.

1867
01:27:44,737 --> 01:27:47,174
<i>♪ It had to be you</i>

1868
01:27:47,653 --> 01:27:49,264
<i>♪ It had to be me</i>

1869
01:27:50,134 --> 01:27:53,398
<i>♪ There had to be
Christmas lights on the tree ♪</i>

1870
01:27:54,486 --> 01:27:56,401
That was my Christmas wish.

1871
01:27:57,533 --> 01:27:58,969
Let's go make snow angels!

1872
01:27:59,012 --> 01:28:00,623
- Come on, Ry!
- Woo!

1873
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,931
<i>♪ It had to be you</i>

1874
01:28:12,025 --> 01:28:14,158
<i>♪ It had to be you</i>

1875
01:28:16,508 --> 01:28:19,294
<i>♪ It had to be you</i>
