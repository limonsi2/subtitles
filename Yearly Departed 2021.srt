Oh!

181
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,852
And executive producing Jeopardy
just to name himself the host.

182
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,105
Quick clue, it was not
Levar Burton.

183
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,731
We love him.

184
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,735
For the longest time,
these assholes were allowed

185
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,570
to hide in plain sight.

186
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,654
They harassed.

187
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,615
- [crowd] Mmm!
- Berated!

188
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:37,076
And acted as conservators
of their daughter's estates.

189
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,077
Free Britney!

190
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,453
[cheering]

191
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,414
Uh-uh, girl, the podcast
already freed her.

192
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,874
My tweet freed her!

193
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,668
Our tweeting freed her!

194
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,379
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

195
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,423
But after this year
the receipts came out

196
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,048
like cancellation confetti.

197
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,259
A reckoning happened,

198
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:56,138
and being an asshole
has gone to that great

199
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,014
NDA in the sky.

200
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,017
Yep, yep.

201
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,852
But for some reason, our
tolerance for them disappeared.

202
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:06,690
And I can't exactly put
my finger on why.

203
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,317
Actually, I can.

204
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,902
We got stuck inside again!

205
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,946
We got stuck inside.

206
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,197
And there was no hope.

207
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,865
And we lost it.

208
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:19,161
And everybody snapped,
we snapped.

209
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,288
I snapped like
Snap, crackle, pop.

210
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,706
We gone! We snapped!

211
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:26,168
And we needed to direct
our rage and frustration

212
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,296
at something tangible
to restore some justice

213
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,548
in an unjust world.

214
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,384
And assholes are right there
for the mass public shaming.

215
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,053
Uh, Lynae, what
is the expression

216
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,638
you're always using
on Instagram?

217
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,807
I'ma keep it Black,
but I'ma keep it brief.

218
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,518
Ah, that's the one, okay.
That one.

219
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,062
Now, you can't get away
with shit anymore.

220
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,606
Because right now everyone
is carrying around

221
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,567
the most powerful weapon
on earth.

222
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,360
A hydrogen bomb.

223
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,486
What?

224
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,404
No, friend.
A smart phone.

225
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,323
Oh.

226
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,991
Now, listen, you can't be rude
to a hostess at a restaurant

227
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,119
and not think she's going
to go viral on TikTok

228
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,828
telling the world about it.

229
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,082
You can't go on stage and
be flat out homophobic.

230
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,208
No.

231
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,918
And you can't be a movie star

232
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,547
and privately tell women
you want to cannibalize them.

233
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,966
You cannot have your pussy
and eat it, too.

234
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,594
[cheering]

235
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,096
For the rich, powerful assholes,

236
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,431
there'll always be
public apology tours

237
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,308
and a Notes app mea culpa.

238
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,895
And eventually, that asshole
will join The View.

239
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,188
Oh!

240
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,149
Or be on "Dancing
with the Stars."

241
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,693
Or show their dick
that no one wants to see

242
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,363
to a bunch of aspiring comics

243
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,907
and sell out entire theaters
in Boston and Chicago

244
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,033
a few years later.

245
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,368
[gasping]

246
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,327
Yo.

247
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,623
You know what?

248
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,625
I gotta get canceled.

249
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,210
Mm-mm.

250
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,628
I've been playing this
all wrong.

251
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,171
I got to get canceled!

252
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,713
And I know exactly
what to say.

253
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:55,798
Uh-huh.

254
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,591
All [bleep] are [bleep].

255
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,592
[gasping]

256
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,260
No!

257
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,929
And that's why you can't [bleep]
mangy [bleep]

258
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,682
to the [bleep] [bleep]

259
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,226
which is why I [bleep]

260
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,854
Ha ha!

261
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,187
Oh...

262
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,605
Dulce, Dulce, hey.

263
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,066
I just got off the
phone with Hollywood.

264
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,525
This is my agent.
What's up, darling?

265
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,777
You're the next James Bond.

266
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,446
Ah! Look at Jesus.

267
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,447
Let's go.

268
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,447
[cheering]

269
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,865
[James Bond theme plays]

270
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,658
Look at Jesus!
Won't he do it!

271
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,326
- I got canceled.
- Can you do a British accent?

272
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,955
[British accent] Oh, yeah,
I can do a British accent.

273
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,081
She can do a British accent.

274
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,375
Chip, chip, cheerio,
come get these towels.

275
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,044
We're doing this all wrong.

276
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,963
Wow.

277
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,799
All right, y'all, get ready, and
I do mean prepare yourselves,

278
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,678
because anything can happen when
Megan Stalter takes the stage.

279
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:43,889
Megan?

280
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,850
[cheering]

281
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,730
I'm just gonna
touch up my face.

282
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,198
My magic 8-ball.

283
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,365
Just a second.

284
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:11,625
Okay.

285
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,086
Um... hi, yucky bitches.

286
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,837
Kidding.

287
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,255
You're all nice.

288
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,383
Well, most of you.

289
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,010
Um... anyways,
we are gathered here

290
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,264
to bid farewell to our
sweaty, beautiful

291
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,850
drunk friends with benefits,
Hot Vaxx Summer.

292
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,480
[cheering]

293
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,815
And if you don't know what
I mean by Hot Vaxx Summer,

294
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,734
you may know her by
her Christian name,

295
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,070
Slut Girl Summer.

296
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,905
Whatever you call her,
she was our horny little season

297
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,075
that could get it in
and get it down.

298
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,370
Reverse cowgirl style.

299
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,371
Wine me, dine me, 39 me.

300
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,999
Which is like 69,

301
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,669
but... shorter with
longer tongue.

302
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,090
And a shorter time.

303
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,883
That makes sense.

304
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,553
Anyways, even though she only
lived for a brief sticky season,

305
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,639
Hot Vaxx Summer gave me
a lifetime of memories

306
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,142
and unidentifiable
phone numbers.

307
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,227
Like hot accountant
with hair.

308
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,937
Spooky Michael, he was fun.

309
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,066
Woman who looks like
Susan Sarandon, but mean.

310
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,568
She wasn't mean, but
she looked mean.

311
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,115
It was hot.
It was really hot.

312
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,576
You don't have any idea
where this will fit.

313
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,786
Let's just say that.

314
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,538
Dizzy just thinking
about her.

315
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,792
Anyway, when I think
about Hot Vaxx Summer,

316
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,751
I'm reminded of her
most important lesson:

317
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,462
sure, you can be vaccinated
against Corona virus,

318
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,508
but you cannot get vaccinated
against HPV.

319
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,926
Oh, actually, you can.

320
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,635
I love that energy, girl.

321
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,722
No, Meg, there's a real
HPV vaccine.

322
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,393
Love your spirit, biotch.

323
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,936
She don't even know me.

324
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,105
Anyways, Hot Vaxx Summer
is survived by

325
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,606
Force Fiancé Fall.

326
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,859
The only comfort I derive
from this is

327
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,653
how fitting it is that
in her final act,

328
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,697
Hot Vaxx Summer is
getting laid... to rest.

329
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,865
Love you, cunt.

330
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,326
My God!

331
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,952
- [piano plays]
- Thank you.

332
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,081
Woo-ooo!

333
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,586
That was... very Megan.

334
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,342
Oh.

335
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,636
All right.

336
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,971
And now we are going to hear
from someone very special.

337
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,890
Guys, she's
a little nervous,

338
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,436
so please join me in giving a
very warm welcome

339
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:41,024
to the extremely funny
Aparna Nancherla.

340
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:44,110
[cheering]

341
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,528
Girl, I have got
to take this off.

342
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,740
I can't look like this,
hold on.

343
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,240
- I hear you. Let me put it up.
- Thank you.

344
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,118
[cheering]

345
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,047
Hi.

346
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,383
Hello.

347
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,259
Salutations.

348
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:15,933
So, um... anyone here
from out of town?

349
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,726
No crowd work!

350
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:23,399
Okay, I was just trying
to connect to my fellow humans.

351
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:28,071
Well, I'm here to say
goodbye to the hermit life.

352
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,782
[applause]

353
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,451
This was the year we took off
the quarantine sweatpants

354
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:38,331
and put on the
socializing sweatpants.

355
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:41,292
Which are in fact
the same pants.

356
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,043
They were.

357
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:47,215
It's all about intent.
Like money laundering, you know?

358
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,802
I remember when
my hermit life all began.

359
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:55,056
I was watching TV, one of my
many friends who is a screen,

360
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,475
and, uh... it suddenly
blared,

361
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,562
"Breaking news!
The CDC recommends

362
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,148
everyone stay inside
indefinitely.

363
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,153
Yes, we will continue to
be this ominous and vague."

364
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,280
You know, with my
bubbly personality,

365
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,743
pathological addiction
to drama,

366
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,039
and cocaine filled
social calendar,

367
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,625
this was a big
sacrifice for me.

368
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:27,630
But like millions of others,
I answered the call of duty,

369
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:32,885
even though I prefer texts,
I've made that very clear.

370
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:37,848
I immediately adopted
two small hangry cats.

371
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,434
I always bought a
Himalayan salt lamp.

372
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,019
No, I still don't
know what it does,

373
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,230
and yes, I have licked it
more than once.

374
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,983
I organized all my
mystery cords.

375
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:52,529
I advised my therapist
on jazzing up her background.

376
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,325
I stayed in shape by
doing the same workout

377
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,827
as Jennifer Lopez's
character in the movie "Enough."

378
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,998
Being a hermit was
a natural fit for me.

379
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,334
Actually, did you know
the word hermit

380
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,127
comes from the Greek word,
Eremites,

381
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,547
meaning "of the desert?"

382
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,343
Yeah, I know that because
I took an online Greek class

383
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,803
for eight days.

384
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:18,263
Day nine, the free trial
ended, so, you know...

385
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,932
Mm-hmm.

386
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,601
You know, without the
shackles of society

387
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:25,980
and peer pressure, I became
the most fully realized

388
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,106
version of myself!

389
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,817
- Good for you!
- [cheering]

390
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,653
I see you, girl.
Live your truth.

391
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,656
But then it all came
crashing down.

392
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,326
[crowd] Oh.

393
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,829
Okay, I'm done crashing.

394
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,837
Reintegrating to society
was culture shock.

395
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,798
You know, my mind erased things
that weren't important anymore

396
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,093
like how to make small talk.

397
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,302
I tried to bring up
the weather recently,

398
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,888
and I said, "Oh, Sun,
Moon to rain, huh?"

399
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,723
[laughing]

400
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,228
Luckily, I learned
a few new tricks

401
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,856
from a very credible source
known as WikiHow.

402
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,651
If you're at a social function
where you don't know anyone,

403
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,653
try walking up to a stranger

404
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,365
and reciting an interesting
fact in an enthusiastic tone.

405
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,950
Like, "Hello,

406
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,660
did you know
the word hermit

407
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,872
comes from the Greek word,
Eremites,

408
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,455
meaning of the desert?"

409
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,917
Next, always have exit excuses
locked and loaded

410
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,961
whenever you're at a party.

411
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,008
For example, "Oh, I have to go!
I forgot I'm a doula!

412
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,467
We're always on call."

413
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,266
Or, "Oh, the line to the
bathroom is very long.

414
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,808
I'm going to use mine."

415
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:54,109
And finally, don't forget about
your non-verbal communication.

416
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,738
You know, here's some classic
facial expressions

417
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,615
for everyday settings.

418
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,157
The "listening" face.

419
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,497
The "I think this story
is supposed to be funny

420
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,833
but it's not really
going anywhere" face.

421
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,965
The "I spaced out for
30 seconds and am now

422
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,593
overcompensating" face.

423
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,101
And finally, the "I have
clinical depression

424
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,313
and constantly remember that
none of this matters" face.

425
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,820
That's actually my resting
face, so...

426
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,531
Oh, I have to go,
I forgot I'm a doula!

427
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,992
[cheering]

428
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,619
We know that's a lie.

429
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:46,788
Duty...

430
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,373
Best of luck, Aparna,

431
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,833
and I hope you have a
safe and healthy delivery.

432
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,044
Thank you, it's my first time.

433
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,588
All right. And now...

434
00:20:56,631 --> 00:21:01,219
Laying to rest something
gone far, far too soon.

435
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,637
Please welcome X Mayo.

436
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,390
[cheering]

437
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,184
That was fast.

438
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:10,519
I'm very good.

439
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:20,195
Ladies, I am here today
to lay to rest

440
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:24,241
"My Body My Choice"
bumper stickers.

441
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:25,576
R.I.P.

442
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,744
The slogan had a great run.

443
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,872
It was a mindset,
a movement.

444
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:33,417
And a hard-earned victory
we won decades ago.

445
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,170
And it was a bumper sticker
that proudly declared

446
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,382
to all who passed, yes,
I am a white woman,

447
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:44,011
and I am listening to
Alanis Morisette in this Subaru.

448
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,596
But then 2021 happened.

449
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:50,308
And the Supreme Court
had the caucasity

450
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:54,689
to roll back
reproductive rights.

451
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,566
Unless you're rich.

452
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,443
First things first,
now that the Supreme Court

453
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,778
has ruled that our bodies
ain't none of our business

454
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,407
sex can have more consequences
than it has in a long time.

455
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,243
Now every time you hook up,
you have to ask yourself,

456
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,662
would this stranger
with no bedframe be

457
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,205
a good co-parent to my child?

458
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,624
No!

459
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,044
He don't even have sheets,
ladies.

460
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:20,506
Which is why I have a very
special presentation for you.

461
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,717
Hot wordless man?

462
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,219
[cheering]

463
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,387
Yes!

464
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,724
Ladies, I present
the 2021 Fuckbook.

465
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,477
[cheering]

466
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,772
Here are the people
you can have sex with

467
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,942
without the risk of
an unwanted pregnancy.

468
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,778
Yes, take a look.

469
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,655
This married family
values senator

470
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:49,242
and only man who's needed
a circumcision for his neck.

471
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,579
If he gets you pregnant, you
won't stay pregnant for long.

472
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:55,249
You may even get a private jet
to a clinic in Puerto Rico.

473
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,959
Mm-hmm.

474
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,420
All right, next step.

475
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,507
We have your Dad's
golf friend, Alan.

476
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,509
He's not going to let
a little mistake ruin things

477
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,303
for him and Eileen, oh, no,
she put him through law school.

478
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:11,432
Sleep with Alan, consider your
reproductive rights restored.

479
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,144
And last, you're going
to love this one.

480
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,105
Oh, yes.

481
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,148
[cheering]

482
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:26,780
Yes, the safest sex
of all is sex with yourself.

483
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,662
We all laughed at Gwyneth
Paltrow's vibrating jade egg

484
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,454
and now look at us,
we're sitting on them.

485
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,749
Facts, facts.

486
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,000
Which brings... you can go.

487
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,336
Which brings me to
another helpful idea

488
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,714
and you know how much
I have to get politi-cal.

489
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:49,095
But we need to regulate sperm
like we regulate guns.

490
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,721
Yes!

491
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,224
Everyone needs a sperm permit.
A spermit.

492
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,893
Speak on it.

493
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,645
And if that doesn't
solve everything right now,

494
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:01,731
as a special surprise,
one lucky audience member

495
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,358
has an IUD under her seat.

496
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,153
- Ooh!
- Yes, everybody look.

497
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,575
Oh, oh!

498
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,076
I got it.

499
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,201
Yes.

500
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,744
I never win these things.

501
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,663
Woo!

502
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,208
Sorry we can only afford one,
ladies, they're so expensive.

503
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,667
- Mm-hmm.
- That's it.

504
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,586
But let's just be clear,
this is not about

505
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,422
the horizontal mambo,

506
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,215
the ooey-gooey ciabatta.

507
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,634
The two headed beast.

508
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,510
You can just say sex.

509
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:33,013
Right, it's about so much
more than that.

510
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:36,267
It's about things hopefully
everyone agrees on.

511
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,685
Ending the cycle of poverty
by ensuring

512
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:39,729
people aren't forced
to have children

513
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,856
they cannot afford to raise.

514
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,984
[cheering]

515
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:48,237
And the government's interest
in babies shouldn't stop

516
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,279
as soon as they're born.

517
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,073
Yes!

518
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,034
And season three of "Succession"
took way too long to come out.

519
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,326
Yeah!

520
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,536
And where the
fuck is "Boondocks"?

521
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,163
Yeah!

522
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,374
What I'm saying is
we have to keep fighting.

523
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,960
Let's be honest, many of you
thought a new president

524
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,212
would solve all of our
problems,

525
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:08,007
and that is because many
of you are white.

526
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,342
Yeah!

527
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,719
And ultimately, even though

528
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,221
"My Body My Choice" bumper
stickers are gone,

529
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:17,892
we can honor their legacy
by not giving in to apathy.

530
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,185
By not falling asleep
behind the wheel

531
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:22,896
because do you know who
sure as shit hasn't?

532
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,606
The motherfuckers who thinks
the vaccine

533
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,108
turns you into a magnet
and thinks JFK Jr.

534
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:30,238
is a guy living in his van
in Pennsylvania.

535
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,240
They're dying for us
to lose momentum,

536
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,240
but will we?

537
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,909
[crowd] No!

538
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,911
That's right, because if we
can muster up enough

539
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,913
fan outrage to bring back
our favorite cancelled show,

540
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,583
"The Connors"...

541
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,042
It's a good show.

542
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:46,420
Then we can do it for
our reproductive rights.

543
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,088
[cheering]

544
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,718
So I stand here before
you today

545
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,387
itching in lace.

546
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,682
To ask you one simple question:

547
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,892
will you take this
fear and anxiety

548
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,269
and commit to doing everything
you can to make sure

549
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,605
we unfuck what
they fucked up

550
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,816
so we can get
back to fucking?

551
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:07,983
[cheering]

552
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,109
Fuck yeah.

553
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,569
That sounds real good to me.

554
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:14,699
And with that...

555
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,285
I have plan B for everybody.

556
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:18,786
[cheering]

557
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:22,080
All right, let's go...
One, two, three.

558
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,833
[cheering]

559
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,797
You're not gonna get pregnant,
you're not gonna get pregnant,

560
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,715
you're not gonna get pregnant.

561
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,049
Yes!

562
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,509
Thanks, ladies.

563
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,058
Wow, okay.

564
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,936
The ooey-gooey ciabatta.

565
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:48,523
Can't lie, I'm interested.

566
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:51,861
All right, ladies, we have
said goodbye to so much tonight,

567
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,570
but before we...

568
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,155
I'm sorry I'm late.

569
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,574
[gasping]

570
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,784
But you know I am
a living legend.

571
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,827
[cheering]
[music playing]

572
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,875
Miss Fonda, please.
It's an honor.

573
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,461
The podium is yours.

574
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,253
[cheering]

575
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,089
It's an honor.

576
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:19,680
Hello, my name is Jane Fonda,
I'm um...

577
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,515
[cheering]

578
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,642
Thank you.

579
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,603
Oscar, Emmy, Golden Globe
winning thespian.

580
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,188
[cheering]

581
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:31,358
Environmentalist,
political activist, arrestee.

582
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,278
And either I'm Grace
or Frankie, I'm not sure.

583
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,781
Um... Google me.

584
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,201
This year we said goodbye

585
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:45,038
to Ignoring the Climate Crisis.

586
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,376
The world's top 200 climate
scientists have called this

587
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,755
a code red moment
for humanity.

588
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:56,092
Texas froze over.

589
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,676
Then the ocean caught fire.

590
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:02,972
New York City subways turned
into white water rapids

591
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:07,936
and Seattle got hotter than
that hotty from "Bridgerton"

592
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,355
who has nothing on you, dear.

593
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,981
Woo!

594
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,234
When things get
this cataclysmic,

595
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,320
I usually file for divorce.

596
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,115
Now that's a legend!

597
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,741
You probably assume that
I'm up here ready

598
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:26,872
to give a doom and gloom speech.
But no.

599
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:30,667
I've had a martini and a doobie
and I'm feeling kinda hopeful.

600
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,796
[cheering]

601
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,923
The fossil fuel corporations

602
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,384
aren't going to give up
fracking our future

603
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,219
and buying off our politicians,

604
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,681
so... we might as well
look at the bright side, right?

605
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,182
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

606
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:49,103
Nobody talks about how
the haze from wildfires

607
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:54,023
creates such incredibly
flattering light.

608
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:58,153
And sure, sea levels are rising
at an accelerating rate,

609
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,949
but doesn't that mean there's
more ocean front property

610
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,576
becoming available?

611
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,288
My grandson might never
see a coral reef,

612
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,207
but he will snorkel high
above the gorgeous

613
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,251
underwater city of Miami.

614
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:21,050
Plus, protesting the fossil
fuel industry is amazing cardio.

615
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,345
If I hadn't been
arrested repeatedly,

616
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,681
I wouldn't have this butt.

617
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,433
[cheering]

618
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:33,605
Stepping into police vans
has replaced my Stairmaster.

619
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,523
Talk about resistance training.

620
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,358
Yes, clever word play.

621
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,944
So basically, unless major
corporate polluters

622
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,697
are held accountable

623
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:44,950
and we vote out the politicians
beholden to them,

624
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,410
our days are numbered.

625
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,538
If it's just fossil
fuel corporations,

626
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,748
does that mean I shouldn't
feel bad about

627
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:52,665
my Fiji water soaking bath?

628
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:56,586
No, you should feel very,
very bad about that, Maggie.

629
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,214
Oh my God, Jane Fonda
knows my name!

630
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,548
That's not your name.

631
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,092
It is now.

632
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:05,261
So, let's enjoy the earth
while it lasts.

633
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,056
[cheering]

634
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,814
I'd like to propose a toast

635
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,650
to the planet.

636
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,151
Our only home.

637
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:24,573
[cheering]

638
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,366
And now if you'll excuse me,

639
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:29,077
I have to go scrub the oil
off a blue whale

640
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,828
down on Huntington beach.

641
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,163
[cheering]

642
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,056
Wow.

643
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:53,560
Jane "fabulous at any age"
Fonda. Oh my God.

644
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,061
We should all be so lucky.

645
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,730
Because if I'm being honest,

646
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,357
with everything
that's going on,

647
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,111
I don't know about
y'all but I am tired.

648
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,570
Mm-hmm.

649
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:04,904
Nah, nah, scratch that,
I'm "tiH'd"!

650
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,532
With a capital "H'd."

651
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:08,992
Actually, if you don't mind,

652
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,786
I can't live like
this no more.

653
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,204
- Take them off!
- What am I trying to prove, ok?

654
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:14,205
- [cheering]
- Do it.

655
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:15,415
Do it, do it, do it!

656
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,791
My foot hurt.

657
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:19,336
As I was saying,
a hoe is tired.

658
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:24,048
And that's why I'm saying
goodbye to hustle and grind.

659
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,759
[cheering]

660
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,930
We live in a culture that
celebrates being on and popping.

661
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,599
All the time? Everywhere
we turn, we're being told.

662
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,809
that we always have
to be hustling.

663
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,936
What you doing?
What are you doing?

664
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,605
What are you doing?

665
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,983
You know, you work five jobs
and you have #nodaysoff.

666
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:44,737
You at the gym.
Yeah, you, at the gym,

667
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:47,030
and posting it on the 'gram,
look at me, it's leg day.

668
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,740
Ah!

669
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,409
Because if you don't post it,
did it ever happen?

670
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:52,201
Well, did it happen, Morty?
We get it.

671
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,122
Close your shirt up.
Close your shirt!

672
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:59,960
[chanting]
Close your shirt!

673
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,962
Just saying, like, what if
I'm too tired to go to the gym?

674
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:05,840
This is how tired I am,
my shoulders are high.

675
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:08,926
Just like this.
I'm so tired.

676
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:12,765
We're so afraid that
if we just sit down

677
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:15,476
for one dag'gone second,
we're going to be left behind.

678
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,019
Left behind where?

679
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,064
They're already going
to space without us.

680
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,816
But this year, so many of
us said, you know what,

681
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:26,528
- mmm-mm, enough is enough.
- Yes!

682
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:30,199
And Black women who have had
to hustle and grind

683
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,076
twice as hard led the charge.

684
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,451
True!

685
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,413
Simon Biles put her
3'4" feet down

686
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,708
and she stopped tumbling just
to prioritize her mental health,

687
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,794
and you know what?
She still won a medal.

688
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:46,131
Naomi Osaka taught us that,
"mm-mm" is a complete sentence.

689
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,967
"I don't want to"
is a good enough reason.

690
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,720
And Meghan Markle
was so tired,

691
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,890
that that chick gave up
a whole entire castle, y'all.

692
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,808
That's how tired
Black women are.

693
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,603
We don't even want to be
princesses no more!

694
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,189
Speak for yourself, honey.

695
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,231
Okay, first you want
to be James Bond,

696
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,607
now you want to be a princess?

697
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,778
I'm trying to take over
England, baby.

698
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,115
No, everybody's tired,
even essential workers.

699
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:15,493
They rightfully asked,
"Y'all, if we're so essential,

700
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,078
then how come y'all won't
provide us with,

701
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:19,163
I don't know, a living wage
and health care?"

702
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,165
[applause]

703
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,960
'Cause if covid don't get
you, a milk crate will. Ah!

704
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,755
I got that challenge
on my first try.

705
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:27,756
Oh, really, your first one?

706
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,090
You want to show us?

707
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,009
It takes me two hours
to set it up.

708
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:36,056
[laughing]
[sighs]

709
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,349
I'm too tired to even mess
with you right now, Aparna.

710
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:39,893
That's how tired I am.

711
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:44,397
You know, this was a year
that it became crystal clear

712
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,982
what we really wanted.

713
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:48,777
Some people moved out of
big, expensive cities

714
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:52,655
to live slower lives in
smaller towns closer to family.

715
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,950
And other people traded in
high powered corporate gigs

716
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,952
they have been working towards
since graduation

717
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,538
only to pursue their dream

718
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,749
of selling homemade
snicker doodle cookies

719
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,209
or mimosa scented
body scrubs.

720
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,545
If anyone's interested
in hand-knitted dog booties,

721
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,172
you can visit my Etsy store.

722
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,923
Rachel, you got an Emmy
and an Etsy?

723
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,467
Girl, ain't you tired.

724
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:13,969
I love dogs.

725
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,679
At some point I'm going
to have to answer

726
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,264
to my mama when she asks,

727
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,682
"When are you going to stop
posting on Instagram

728
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,518
and give me some grandbabies?"

729
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,438
How does she think
I'm supposed to get the man

730
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,731
to give her these grandbabies?

731
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,358
Do you understand how
hard it is to explain

732
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,777
what a thirst trap is
to an immigrant mom?

733
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,403
Let me show you.

734
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,907
[chanting]

735
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:45,876
That is a thirst trap.

736
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,835
[applause]

737
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:50,130
Basically, y'all, the
pandemic made me realize

738
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,173
that life is short.

739
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,425
And tomorrow's not promised.

740
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,012
So Drake, you really need
to answer my DMs.

741
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:59,014
[cheering]

742
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,724
And I'm proud of us,

743
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,266
because we're all
ending this year

744
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,436
very differently
than when we began it.

745
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:07,438
We're getting rid of everything
that did not serve us,

746
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:10,525
and we are embracing these
newer, beautiful versions

747
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,735
of ourselves

748
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,152
with a new set of priorities.

749
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,780
I mean, what are we all
working so hard for

750
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,574
if we can't enjoy
the fruits of our labor?

751
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,617
Yeah!

752
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:19,992
So tonight

753
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,619
I'm putting down
hustle and grind.

754
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,913
Bye bye.

755
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:27,000
And I am picking up
ease and flow.

756
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,001
Mmm.

757
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,753
[cheering]

758
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:34,757
Because you know what? Resting
is being productive, too.

759
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,594
When you're rested up,
you can show up for you

760
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,347
and for the people and causes
you actually care about.

761
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,599
You can't pour from
an empty glass.

762
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,101
And speaking of glasses,

763
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:49,063
it is time for me
to fill me up. Hello.

764
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:51,858
- [cheering]
-That's right.

765
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,570
Yeah!

766
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,990
So, as we bid farewell to this
year, let's raise a glass.

767
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:02,286
[cheering]

768
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,496
Pour out a little liquor for our
homies that couldn't make it.

769
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:05,873
No pouring out.

770
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:09,585
Okay, well, more for me.

771
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,920
So as we leave 2021 behind,

772
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,465
I am going to vow
to stay hydrated, hello,

773
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,427
moisturized, and
apparently BFFs with Jane Fonda,

774
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,094
'cause she looks amazing.

775
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:21,429
[cheering]

776
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:22,972
I'm gonna relax.

777
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,266
I'm gonna be rich and married!

778
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:26,518
Woo!

779
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,103
And I'm gonna go
platinum again.

780
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,606
Oh my gosh, Alessia Cara?

781
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,233
Hey, Yvonne, love all this.

782
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:34,985
Girl, we are about to
do an in memoriam.

783

No, I wouldn't want to...
intrude.

Mm-mm, stop it.
I insist.

786
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,242
No, I really, I couldn't.
