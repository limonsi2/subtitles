3
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:06,166
They say Bene Gesserit only exists

4
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:09,748
to serve the greater good.

5
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:12,862
I mean no disrespect to your mother,

6
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:16,193
but they also pursue their own interests.

7
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:18,795
What are you saying?

8
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,095
Be careful.

9
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:27,621
Don't talk to anyone.

10
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:45,038
Remember your training.

11
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:38,640
Prepare for violence.

12
00:45:48,914 --> 00:45:50,521
What is the Emperor's message?

13
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,343
He will strengthen your hand.

14
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,102
With his Sardaukar armyâ€¦

15
00:52:50,643 --> 00:52:52,137
I know who you are.

16
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,436
He will know his uses
as if he was born with them.

17
01:10:01,887 --> 01:10:03,580
Why does Baron need us?

18
01:10:03,664 --> 01:10:06,353
The Harkonnen outnumber Atreides.

19
01:10:06,437 --> 01:10:08,114
The Baron doesn't need us.

20
01:10:15,866 --> 01:10:18,217
We are the Sardaukar -

21
01:10:18,722 --> 01:10:19,596
Emperor's blades.

22
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,974
Those who stand against us
meet their death.

23
01:10:33,603 --> 01:10:35,536
As the Emperor commands,

24
01:10:36,269 --> 01:10:37,176
it will be done.

25
01:21:42,557 --> 01:21:45,217
We will drop them in the desert.

26
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:46,783
And leave them to the worms.

27
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:50,809
Why not just cut their throats?

28
01:21:51,961 --> 01:21:55,381
They could be the Truthsayers.

29
01:21:57,273 --> 01:21:59,689
We can say we didn't kill them.

30
01:22:05,724 --> 01:22:07,594
The one with the scar is deaf.

31
01:24:47,762 --> 01:24:49,582
No! You're not ready.

32
01:25:05,317 --> 01:25:07,957
Find the right tone.

33
01:25:14,111 --> 01:25:14,998
We are far enough.

34
01:25:15,885 --> 01:25:17,639
Throw the boy out.

35
02:07:11,869 --> 02:07:13,422
We are not alone.

36
02:08:03,684 --> 02:08:05,637
How can he be Lisan al-Gaib?

37
02:08:06,614 --> 02:08:07,834
He hasn't proved himself.

38
02:09:59,143 --> 02:10:00,730
The sun is about to rise.

39
02:10:01,616 --> 02:10:03,177
We must reach Sietch Tabr.

40
02:10:05,237 --> 02:10:07,483
The fate of the strangers
will be decided there.

41
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:14,206
Until then,

42
02:10:15,241 --> 02:10:17,389
they are under my protection.

43
02:10:18,887 --> 02:10:20,634
I give you my word.

44
02:11:05,985 --> 02:11:07,151
We must go.

45
02:11:07,818 --> 02:11:08,999
We must go.
