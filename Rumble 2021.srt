00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:12,898
[narrator] From the bowels
of the earth

4
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:15,336
and the depths
of the oceans,
they came.

5
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:19,166
Titans. Kraken. Kaiju.

6
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:22,299
Their earth-shattering battles
thrilled mankind.

7
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:26,999
Human and creature teamed up
to create the greatest sport
of all time:

8
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:29,915
Monster Wrestling!

9
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,135
From the ancient arenas
of yesteryear

10
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:34,572
to the cutting-edge stadiums
of today,

11
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:36,574
these rare beasts wrestle

12
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:39,534
for the glory
of their hometowns and cities,

13
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:43,712
fighting for the World
Monster Wrestling championship.

14
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:46,323
And it was the town
of Stoker-on-Avon

15
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:50,153
that gave us the greatest
wrestling team of all time--

16
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:52,764
Rayburn
and Coach Jimbo Coyle.

17
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:54,853
Yeah! That'’s how
you do it, champ.

18
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:58,770
Nine-time winners
of the Big Belt,
they dominated the sport...

19
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:02,557
until tragedy stuck.

20
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:05,908
En route to
a championship match,

21
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:08,650
Rayburn and Jimbo
were lost at sea...

22
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:14,090
and Stoker was left
without hope.

23
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,310
[sirens wailing]

24
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:20,792
But now, Stoker dares
to dream again.

25
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:26,058
Jimbo'’s protégé, Siggy Marlon,
has found a new monster:

26
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:28,017
Tentacular.

27
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,847
Tonight, Stoker unveils
their newly renovated
Jimbo Coyle Stadium,

28
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,200
where their phenom hopes
to claim the biggest prize
in sports:

29
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:39,159
the Big Belt!

30
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,773
[announcer]
Welcome to match night
at Jimbo Coyle Stadium,

31
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:47,167

wrestling universe.

33
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:55,175
Hey, Fred!Hiya, Winnie!

34
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:57,612
Your new tentacle sign
looks amazing.

35
00:02:57,655 --> 00:03:01,181
Thanks, Winnie!
It'’s in honor of Tentacular!

36
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:02,921
Pretty clever, huh?I love it.

37
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:05,010
-Stoker!
-Stoker.

38
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:07,012
-Stoker!
-Stoker!

39
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:09,232
-Stoker!
-Stoker-- Aah!

40
00:03:09,276 --> 00:03:11,713
Wha--[both] Stoker!

41
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:14,063
[all] Stoker!

42
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:16,239
Wait!See you up there, Fred.

43
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:18,894
Yep! Oh, I hope we win.

44
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:25,509
[people chanting]
Tentacular! Tentacular!

45
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:28,512
Tentacular! Tentacular!

[sighs] Wish you were here
today, Dad.

[exclaiming]

51
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:54,103
Live in five, Mr. Remy.All right, ready?

52
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:56,671
[exclaiming, gibbering]

53
00:03:57,976 --> 00:04:00,501
[announcer]
Slime Zone ticket holders
enter through gate C.

54
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:02,981
-Hey, Winnie.
-Hey, Susie. Up top.

55
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:04,896
Bring it.

56
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,291
Oh! Oh, yeah!
This is gonna be awesome.

57
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:09,771
-Whoop! Oh, sorry.
-Hey, Winnie!

58
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:11,773
Pineapple-slaw dog with
extra ketchup coming at ya!

59
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:14,732
Yes! Thank you, Hoppy.[shouts]

60
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:17,561
[all exclaiming]

61
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:20,564
[clerk] Fifteen dollars.
That'’s 22.54. Two for 25.

62
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:25,090
There'’s enough for everyone.
Calm down. Everybody,
please be patient.

63
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:26,831
Hey, Mom! Coming in hot.

64
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,486
Oh. Thanks, Win.
Been a while since
we'’ve been this busy.

65
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,923
-See you in the stands, Mom.
-That'’s 25 even.

66
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,969
Coach Siggy,
as Jimbo'’s assistant,

67
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:36,276
you were such a huge part
of Stoker'’s wrestling history.

68
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,061
Now you have a chance
to make your own
with Tentacular.

69
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:41,324
But first, you gotta beat
the champ tonight.

70
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:43,239
King Gorge was
a great champ.

71
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,329
But he'’s never fought
anyone like Tentacular.

72
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,853
Oh, man!
Siggy wants this
in the worst way.

73
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:51,116
No, way, bro.
Two rounds, and it'’s over.

74
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,901
It'’s gonna be Tentacular
in the third.

75
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:55,077
Dude,
that'’s Winnie Coyle!

76
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,558
[chuckles] You know it.Jimbo'’s daughter?

77
00:04:57,601 --> 00:05:00,169
-No way, bro.
-You got this.

78
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:01,301
Hey, Carl.Hey, Winnie.

79
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:03,041
Wearing
your lucky socks?

80
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:04,695
Going on
three weeks now.

81
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:05,827
[sniffing]

82
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,657
Smells like... victory![exclaiming]

83
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:13,965

[announcer]
World Monster Wrestling
presents

85
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:42,080
The Smackdown in Stoker!

86
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,997
Live from Stoker-on-Avon,
I'’m Marc Remy,

87
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,521
welcoming you at home

88
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:49,827
to the biggest night
of monster wrestling
in years,

89
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:53,222
right here in the house
that Rayburn and Jimbo built.

90
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:55,006
And I'’m
Lights Out McGinty,

91
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,009
and I could not be
more excited.[groans]

92
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:01,012
But with that excitement
comes some sadness, Marc.

93
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:03,450
I can'’t believe
it'’s been nine years

94
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:06,322
since we tragically lost
Rayburn and Jimbo.

95
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,803
Nobody was greater.
We all miss them.

96
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:12,197
[crowd chanting]
Rayburn! Jimbo!

97
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:15,331
[Marc] Just listen
to this crowd.
Boy, this is special!

98
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,378
Jimbo! Rayburn! Oh!

99
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,902
But now
we are moments away

100
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:23,208
from seeing
if Tentacular can bring

101
00:06:23,252 --> 00:06:26,386
the glory days
back to Stoker.

102
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:30,825
Welcome, monster wrestling fans
from every corner of the globe.

103
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:35,133
For tonight, we wrestle
for the Big Belt!

104
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:38,354
-Yeah!
-Stoker!

105
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,489
And now,
from Stoker-on-Avon,

106
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:45,405
the hometown hero,

107
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,537
the challenger,

108
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:51,846
Tentacular!

109
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:55,110
Yeah! [laughs]
Light '’em up!

110
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:57,460
[upbeat music playing]

111
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:01,246
-[McGinty] The new
pride of Stoker...
-Oh, yeah!

112
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,900
...is in the house!

113
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:05,729
He'’s ready.
Look at him go.

114
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:07,209
Do it for Stoker, T!

115
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:09,994
[Marc laughs]
Just listen to that passion.

116
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:11,431
Yeah! Tentacular!

117
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:15,304
I'’ve got your whole life story
tattooed on my body!

118
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:19,090
Whoa, whoa. I hope
you saved room for the win
I'’m gonna have tonight.

119
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:23,791
[McGinty] He just tore
through the Western Division
to set up this match.

120
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:27,055
-Cheese!
-[Marc] Yes, sir.
He sure did.

121
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:31,015
Who wants a selfie? I do!Oh, yeah!

122
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:32,582
[chuckles] Hey-o!

123
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:34,628
I'’m so pretty!

124
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:39,284
[McGinty]
Look at those muscles!

125
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:43,114
The guy'’s traps
are busting out
of his neck, Marc.

126
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:45,639
Yeah, T! Pop those pecs!

127
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:48,380
Come on, come get
some of this. Here I am.

128
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:50,034
Uh-huh!

129
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:53,385
[announcer]
Here comes the king.

130
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:55,257
[fanfare playing]

131
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,520
Sixty-two feet
of pure pain.

132
00:07:57,564 --> 00:08:02,699
The slimy limey!
The no-bull British bulldog!

133
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:06,877
King Gorge!

134
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:07,748
[roars]

135
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,011
[upbeat music playing]

136
00:08:10,054 --> 00:08:11,360
Boo!

137
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:13,928
Bow to your king.

138
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:17,366
Bad dog! Bad dog!You'’re going down, Gorge!

139
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:21,588
[McGinty]
Listen to the crowd.
They are heated!

140
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:24,068
[Marc] This home crowd
does not like the king.

141
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:27,028
-No one'’s bowing
in this stadium.
-Boo! Boo!

142
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:31,859
[roars]

143
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:35,166
[exclaiming]

144
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,344
[ring announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen
and monsters!

145
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:44,393
-Let'’s get ready to rumble!
-[both growling]

146
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:46,874
I am so ready for this.

147
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,440
You ready?
Who needs a stress ball?

148
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,617
You look stressed, Maddie.
Here'’s a stress ball.

149
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,315
I got you.
Take a stress ball.[bell rings]

150
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:56,797
[Marc]
And this championship match
is officially under--

151
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,495
This is awesome!
Spectacular! Electrifying!

152
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,410
Whatever word
you wanna come up with!

153
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,194
Okay.
Breathe, Fred. Breathe.

154
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:05,109
There it is:
the Inverted Cloverleaf.

155
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:07,242
Siggy got that
right out of Dad'’s playbook.

156
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:09,200
He might have this, Fred.

157
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,594
Come on. I'’m not watching.
I'’m watching,
but I'’m not watching.

158
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,378
[wrestler groans]Oh, wake up, ref!

159
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:15,598
That'’s a gill gouge, again!

160
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:19,254
[Winnie scoffs]
What is he doing?
He'’s gotta stick to the plan!

161
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:23,737
Gorge is doing the Irish Whip
into the Flying Right-Hook
Lariat every time!

162
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,478
Come on, T.
Don'’t let him get the--

163
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:28,045
Watch that Elbow Smash!

164
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,395
[Marc] Tentacular came in
to this match the hot favorite.

165
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,920
But the wily old champ,
he'’s got some other ideas.

166
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:34,486
Did you see that?Yeah. I saw it.

167
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,488
He licked his nose again.
You saw that, right?Yeah.

168
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:39,579
Just before he looked up--
There! He did it again.

169
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,711
Did what?
I'’m not watching!

170
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,235
It'’s so...I know, right?

171
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,890
...obvious.

172
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:49,545
Winnie!
Where you going?

173
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,678
Sorry! Watch your head.

174
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:54,594
-Hey!
-My bad! Watch your back!
Sorry.

175
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:56,334
Whoops! Heads up!

176
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,425
Whoa! Whoa!

177
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:01,992
[exclaims]

178
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,217
[Marc] Ooh! Gorge has got him
in the Chickenwing
Over-the-shoulder Dropface.

179
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,091
[McGinty] Oh! And Tentacular
is in real trouble
early in this match.

180
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:16,050
I'’m gonna go out
on a limb here and say

181
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:19,836
that we'’re in for
another coronation
of King Gorge.

182
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,100
-[bell rings]
-[Marc] There goes that round.

183
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:25,276
What are you doing?
This is your chance.

184
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,671
Listen to me.
Look at me. Focus, T.
Remember the game plan.

185
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:32,632
Get him up on his hind legs,
and then you wrap him
up with your tentacles--

186
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,546
Wait a second! Wait.
He'’s got--

187
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,548
Winnie!He'’s got a tell!

188
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:39,769
How many times do I have
to tell you? Ringside'’s
no place for no little girl.

189
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:41,771
He licks his nose
every time.

190
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:43,512
What are you talking about?

191
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:45,340
He licks
before he strikes!

192
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:47,429
Is Winnie right, Sig?

193
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:55,132
You'’re a good boy, aren't you?
Yes, you are.

194
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:58,092
Good boy.
Who'’s a good boy, then?

195
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,878
Pull up your socks
and take this guy out.

196
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:04,098
[bell rings]Good call, Winnie.

197
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:09,843
[snarling]

198
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,065
Ah! Yeah!

199
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:25,162
-Yes!
-Whoa!

200
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:28,165
Yay! Go, Tentacular, go!

201
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,474
Yeah, T! Finish him!

202
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:42,092
[McGinty exclaims][Marc] T with the Shark Fin
Super Stunner!

203
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:49,752
-He'’s out!
-[bell ringing]

204
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:52,059
[cheering]

205
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:55,758
We did it, Sig.
Stoker'’s back on top.

206
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:58,413
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, sure is, kid.

207
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:02,765
Oh, yeah, Stoker!
I'’m going to an unnamed
theme park!

208
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,549
[laughing]

209
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:06,290
T, get over here,
big guy.

210
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:08,684
You did it.
You are the champion.

211
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,600
You got the job done.
Can you tell us
what this means to you?

212
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:15,865
Marc, let me tell you.
This means so much
to Tentacular.

213
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:19,564
But first,
I just have to thank Stoker.

214
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:22,132
I love you, Tentacular!

215
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,919
Oh, this town,
you have given Tentacular

216
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:28,312
everything Tentacular needed

217
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:31,620
to realize
Tentacular'’s dream!

218
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:33,840
I love you, Stoker!

219
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:36,059
[all] Aw!

220
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:37,626
So, thank you, Stoker.

221
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:42,065
You will always have
a special place in my heart

222
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:44,764
as the place
that Tentacular left

223
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:48,593
to go somewhere much,
much better.

224
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:50,334
-What?
-Huh?

225
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:51,988
What?

226
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:54,817
Are you serious?
You'’re really leaving Stoker?

227
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:56,514
Of course, Marc.

228
00:12:56,558 --> 00:13:00,083
I'’m about to make history.
My own history.

229
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:04,871
Can'’t do that in Stoker.
There'’s too much history
here already.

230
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:10,615
That'’s why I'm taking
my talents to Slitherpoole.

231
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,791
No!

232
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,184
What'’s happening, Daddy?

233
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:17,057
Why? Why?

234
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:19,537
Jimothy! Come here.

235
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:23,106
This is my ticket to bigger
and brighter things, Marc.

236
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,589
Oh, ho, ho!
Just let me finish
this killer tweet.

237
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,983
Marc, you look good.
Can we take a quick pic?

238
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:32,115
And send. Perfect. Okay.

239
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,769
That is right, Marc.

240
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,817
Now the big guy
can actually win
somewhere that matters,

241
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,123
on a stage as big
and beautiful--

242
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,212
you know you are--
as he is.

243
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:44,780
I'’m talking about Slitherpoole.

244
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,261
And, Marc, can I just give
a big shout-out to Pop-Pop

245
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:49,045
for buying me the franchise?

246
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:53,484
We did it! Anything is possible!
Thank you, Pop-Pop.

247
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:59,839
So thank you again, Stoker.
Much love. T out.

248
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,841
[upbeat music playing]

249
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,494
[feedback squeals]

250
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:07,585
Come on, Sig.
Time for the T train
to leave the station.

251
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:10,937
I'’m sorry, Winnie.
I gotta go where he goes.

252
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:21,121
[audience booing, jeering]

253
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:32,610
[Marc] The sports world
is absolutely abuzz

254
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:35,918
with Tentacular'’s
shocking departure
from Stoker last night.

255
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:38,965
Why did I buy
this stupid sign?

256
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:41,402
-You gotta be kidding.
-What do we do?

257
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,186
Can you believe it?
I can'’t.

258
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,188
Mom,
are we gonna be okay?

259
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:47,887
I don'’t know, hon,
but we'’ve been
through worse.

260
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,891
"Do you want neon?"
"Sure," I said.
"Money'’s no object."

261
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,718
Have you seen
my hair salon?

262
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:57,809
Your hair salon?
What about that tattoo
I just got on my--

263
00:14:57,853 --> 00:14:59,942
[all clamoring]

264
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:03,119
All right everybody,
now, settle down.
Just settle down.

265
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:05,034
[clears throat]

266
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,731
Look,
I know you'’re all worried.

267
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:10,518
After all, each of us owns
a piece of Stoker Stadium.

268
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:13,260
But what
you don'’t realize is

269
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:17,568
that things are actually
much, much worse
than you know.

270
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,179
Hang on. What?

271
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:22,051
Uh, our councilwoman
over here can explain
everything to you.

272
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:23,966
Probably her fault
anyway.

273
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,535
Wow. Thank you so much,
Mr. Mayor.

274
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:29,406
Pretty sure
it'’s your fault, though.

275
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,539
Okay, let me
make it simple.

276
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:34,237
Very simple.

277
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:38,067
The stadium costs
lots of money. Okay?

278
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:42,811
No monster means
no money.

279
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:46,815
No money means
no stadium.

280
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:49,470
Which is bad for Stoker.

281
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,084
Oh, my gosh!
Remember when Pittsmore
lost LeBrontosaurus?

282
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:56,607
[all] Not Pittsmore!

283
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:58,653
That'’s right.
All they have left

284
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:01,264
is that illegal
monster wrestling club

285
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,875
in that abandoned
bobblehead factory.

286
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,791
[thunder crashes][voices scream]

287
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:10,012
Ooh.
Scary lightning.
[imitates wind gust]

288
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:11,666
Okay, hold on,
everybody.

289
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:15,061
I'’m here to tell you
that there is a solution.

290
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:17,454
The owner of
the Slitherpoole franchise

291
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:20,892
has offered us a lot of money
to buy the stadium.

292
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,112
Yes!We'’re saved.

293
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:25,071
Yes, yes, that is great.

294
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:29,075
He'’s gonna blow up the stadium
and turn it into a parking lot.

295
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:31,251
-What?
-What?

296
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:33,383
-A parking lot?
-Yes!

297
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:36,473
With shuttle service
to Slitherpoole.

298
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:40,173
You can'’t do that
to the Jimbo Coyle Stadium!
That'’s-- No!

299
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:43,654
Sorry. The whole town
will go bankrupt
unless we sell to Jimothy.

300
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:46,788
But without monster wrestling,
we'’re not Stoker.

301
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:49,138
-We'’ll have nothing.
-We'’ll have a parking lot.

302
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:53,142
You can'’t just tear down
everything my dad
and Rayburn built here.

303
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:54,622
They never quit.

304
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:56,841
You know what
my dad always said?

305
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:59,192
"When you get knocked down,
you get back up."

306
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:01,759
Getting back up isn'’t gonna
pay my bills, Winnie.

307
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:05,067
I invested
everything in him.What am I supposed to do?

308
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,634
Winnie, look, I'’m sorry.

309
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:09,724
The loans on the stadium
are due in 90 days.

310
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:13,641
And if you think we can
replace a champion
like Tentacular before then,

311
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:16,818
that-- that'’s just--
it'’s crazy!

312
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:21,214
Get real.We'’re doomed.

313
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:01,210
[crowd cheering]

314
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:03,778
[ring announcer]
And in the blue corner,

315
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:06,476
the hometown hero:

316
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,653
Rayburn!

317
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:13,744
Hey, Win,
what do you think?

318
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:18,140
It'’s gonna be tough,
but Rayburn has one thing
Gargantuan doesn'’t.

319
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:20,186
Oh. What'’s that?

320
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:21,578
You, Dad.

321
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:23,754
[chuckling]
Better watch out, Siggy.

322
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:26,583
Looks like Jimbo'’s got himself
a new assistant coach.

323
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:29,717
You'’re a riot, Rayburn.
Now can we please
focus on the match?

324
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,112
Okay, Rayburn.
You know what to do.

325
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:36,419
Everything we need to win
is in here,

326
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:39,814
in here, and in here.

327
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,991
Now, go make
Stoker proud.

328
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:45,124
[announcer]
And here we go!

329
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:48,170
Take him down!

330
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,955
And there it is!
The Reverse STO

331
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:54,176
and another championship
for Rayburn,
the greatest of all time!

332
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,179
He did it!
He got the Big Belt, Dad!

333
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,618
[gasps]

334
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:10,540
Bye, Mom! I'’m going to Pittsmore
to find Stoker a new monster.

335
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:11,541
What? No.

336
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:13,587
This isn'’t
your responsibility.

337
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,198
You don'’t have to do this.It'’s what Dad
would have done.

338
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:20,637
I'’m Jimbo Coyle's daughter.
How can I do anything less?

339
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:26,382
[person]
Now approaching the station,
the Pittsmore Local.

340
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:38,177
[person 2]
Last stop, Pittsmore.What? Wha--

341
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:48,578
[upbeat music playing]

342
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,232
[sighs]

343
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,539
[people whooping, cheering]

344
00:19:57,892 --> 00:19:59,633
[bodies thudding]

345
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,897
[cat snarls][gasps]

346
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,380
[crowd cheering]

347
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,866
[crowd chanting] Axehammer!
Axehammer! Axehammer!

348
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,128
Hey, watch it!

349
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,305
Five minutes till bets close!
Place your bets!

350
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:22,264
[monster roars]Sorry.

351
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,137
Yeah!

352
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:30,359
Come on, give me a challenge.
Axehammer wants a challenge!

353
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:32,535
[wrestler]
Ah! Just take it easy.

354
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:35,843
[Axehammer] Oh, you want
some more of that? You want
some more of the Axehammer?

355
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:38,715
No, bro! No, no,
no, no, no, no--
[groans]

356
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,064
[chuckles]

357
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:41,283
[roars]

358
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:44,112
That is so much pain, bro.
[screams]

359
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:45,418
Ooh!

360
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:48,769
You like that?
Axehammer is the man!

361
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:50,727
[laughing]

362
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:53,643
[crowd chanting]
Defenestrate! Defenestrate!

363
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:56,385
[chanting continues][exclaiming]

364
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:01,564
Ooh.

365
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:03,827
[wrestler screams, body thuds]

366
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,960
[roaring]

367
00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:08,571
Just think about it.
Sign up with Stoker.

368
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:11,008
I can get you matches
in a real stadium.

369
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:12,923
You'’ll be wrestling
in the big leagues,

370
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:16,536
and, as a bonus,
you'’ll get me
as your coach!

371
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:18,842
It'’s a win-win-Winnie!
[chuckles]

372
00:21:20,627 --> 00:21:22,629
You'’re the coach, huh?

373
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:39,907
Oh, too much.

374
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,824
And me as your coach.
It'’s a win-win-Winnie!

375
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:47,001
It'’s a win-win-Winnie?

376
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:50,396
-Win-win-Winnie?
-[braying]

377
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,832
Winnie?

378
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,836
Another root beer
on the rocks.

379
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:59,100
[glass shatters]Ugh!

380
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:00,623
Tough night, huh?

381
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:03,496
Eh, don'’t worry. Your luck's
gotta change, right?

382
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:04,975
I mean, look at me.

383
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:08,327
I just put
every last cent
I have on that guy.

384
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,416
[Winnie]
Uh, the guy with the tusks?

385
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:11,982
Looks like a pretty sure thing.

386
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:16,857
No. The slobby-looking guy
with the horns.

387
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,467
[Winnie] Oh!

388
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:21,209
That there is
Steve the Stupendous.

389
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:24,647
-He'’s...
-He'’s never won
a single match.

390
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:26,388
He'’s a thousand-to-one odds!

391
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:29,391
He wins,
I get a hundred grand!

392
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:31,785
Okay, you asked for it.

393
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:34,570
Get ready for the Moon Boom!

394
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:38,052
-[gasps]
-Get ready for the Moon Boom!

395
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:40,750
Oh, careful, Son.

396
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:41,925
[giggling]

397
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:46,321
Rayburn Jr.?
This is perfect!

398
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,540
[chuckles] Huh?

399
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,280
-Wha--
-[gasps]

400
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:52,414
I said, here it comes!

401
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,939
Bring it on,
you sack of warm puke.

402
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:59,639
Oh, I'’m bringing
the warm puke.
Don'’t worry.

403
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:02,511
There'’s gonna be a lot of puke
coming outta me,

404
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:04,861
which is obviously
super gross.

405
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:07,037
You know, um,
I can'’t jump that far.

406
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:08,735
Why did you have to
climb up there?

407
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:11,825
I thought it would look cool.
This looks cool, right?

408
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:13,261
This sucks!

409
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:16,307
You suck! Just come closer.

410
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:18,571
Rayburn Jr.!
What are you doing here?

411
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:20,660
Hmm? [exclaiming]

412
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:22,792
Dang it.

413
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,359
Come on, man.
What are you doing?

414
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,883
You'’re supposed to
land on me.
Then I reverse you--

415
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:28,755
-Ray-Ray! Yoo-hoo! Up here!
-Who is Ray?

416
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,713
No one.
I'’ve never heard of Ray.

417
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:33,107
Did you see that?
Yeah, Steve!

418
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,502
Quit messing around, Steve.
You'’re supposed to lose.

419
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:38,939
What'’s wrong with you?[chuckles] Nothing.

420
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:42,682
Stick to the script, fellas.
Don'’t wanna get
the boss upset, do we?

421
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:47,817
No, we do not. Okay, Klonk,
let'’s end this with a bang.

422
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:49,515
I'’m gonna go for
the Kesagiri Chop,

423
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:52,735
but you catch it
and finish me off
with a Reverse Clothesline.

424
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:55,434
[chuckles] Classic.

425
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,305
This little piggy'’s
coming home!

426
00:23:57,348 --> 00:24:00,917
Hey! Over here! Rayburn,
I can'’t believe it's you!

427
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:04,443
-This has gotta be fate.
-Hey, get off the ropes, kid.

428
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,576
Steve,
just go down already.Got it.

429
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,579
Sorry, buddy.
Just clothesline me.

430
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,714
Ray-Ray, come on.
It'’s me, Winnie Coyle!

431
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:16,629
Uh-oh.
Would you get outta here?

432
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:19,458
Rayburn, when you'’re done
doing whatever this is,
we should talk.

433
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,808
I said, get outta here!

434
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,987
No!

435
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:32,166
-[crowd exclaims]
-Oh, no.

436
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:38,215
-Uh, one.
-[monster snarls]

437
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,130
-[gasps]
-Two.

438
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,958
Klonk! You gotta get up.

439
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:43,525
Three...Get up, get up!

440
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,832
And Steve the Stupendous
seems to be trying--

441
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,138
unsuccessfully--
to lose now.

442
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:50,445
Six. Seven.He'’s up, he's up!

443
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,492
-Eight. Nine.
-Really?

444
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,624
Nine and a half.Come on, Klonk!

445
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:57,234
Nine and three-quarters.

446
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:01,935
Get up, Klonk.Nine and nine-tenths!

447
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:04,633
Ugh. Ten. Takedown.[bell rings]

448
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:06,505
Fight'’s over.[gasps]

449
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:09,159
I won! I won, I won!

450
00:25:09,203 --> 00:25:10,552
[gasps]

451
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:13,033
[buzzer sounding]

452
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:15,818
[gasps]

453
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,779
I'’m out of here.

454
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:22,303
[door creaking][gasps]

455
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:25,088
Oh. Whoa.
Hey, Denise.

456
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:27,656
Where do you think
you'’re going, Steve?

457
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,267
Uh, nowhere.

458
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:40,669
[sinister chuckle]

459
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:43,716
Steve. Steve.[people gasping]

460
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,023
Steve, Steve,
Stevie, Stevie, Steve.

461
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:06,303
Looks like we have
a little bit
of a problem, Stevie.

462
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:09,698
I paid you
to lose tonight,

463
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:12,353
like I do every night.

464
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:15,617
It was an accident, I swear.
You know me. I love to lose.

465
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:17,532
I'’m the best loser
in the biz.

466
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,490
Yes, you were.

467
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:21,231
[laughing] I won!

468
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:24,583
I won a hundred grand!
I can go to college now!

469
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:29,675
Do you know what happens
to those who betray Lady Mayhen?

470
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:31,633
Very...Yeah?

471
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:33,156
...bad...Uh-huh.

472
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,245
...painful things.

473
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:38,988
[chuckles]
Lady Mayhen wants her money.

474
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:40,860
Listen,
I'’ll make it up to you.

475
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:43,819
I'’ll wrestle for free.
I'’ll clean the toilets.
Whatever you want.

476
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:48,432
You know what I really want?
The money, honey!

477
00:26:48,476 --> 00:26:51,958
All of it, times ten.

478
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:54,134
Honestly,
I'’m not great with math,

479
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:56,440
but I don'’t know how
I'’m ever gonna be able
to pay you.

480
00:26:56,484 --> 00:26:59,356
-I think I can help.
-I don'’t know you.
I don'’t know her!

481
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,839
Sure, you do. It'’s me.
Winnie Coyle? Come on.
You remember me, Rayb--

482
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:06,233
My name is Steve.Hello!

483
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:09,628
I hate to interrupt
this charming little
reunion you'’re having,

484
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:12,456
but, Steve, there'’s still
the matter of my money.

485
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,939
I don'’t want to see you again
until you have all of it.

486
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:20,116
Every last dollar bill.

487
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:23,816
Oh, Klonk! Where are you?

488
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:27,820
Clock is ticking, Steve.
Ticktock, ticktock.

489
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,344
Whoa!

490
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:32,389
[grunts, groans]

491
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:34,827
Hey! Wait up!

492
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,133
Man, I never thought
I'’d see you again.

493
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:39,309
Oh, won'’t you just
leave me alone?

494
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:43,531
Just hear me out.
I can help you get that money.

495
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:45,533
Tentacular turned heel
and bailed,

496
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:48,579
and you probably saw that,
along with everyone else
in the stinking world,

497
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:49,798
which was awesome.

498
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:52,758
But that means
Stoker needs a monster.

499
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:54,760
Yeah, no.

500
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:56,239
Listen to me.

501
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:59,155
I can help you.
Just come with me to Stoker.

502
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:02,985
I'’m not going back...
to that place that
I'’ve never been.

503
00:28:04,073 --> 00:28:07,163
Ha! Wow. You are not
good at lying, Rayburn.

504
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:10,166
Hey, kid.
You got the wrong monster.

505
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,821
I don'’t think so, Rayburn.

506
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:17,696
Rayburn was my dad.
And I'’m not gonna cash in
on his name. Ever.

507
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,176
[laughs] I knew it!
I knew it was you!

508
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,352
[groans]I mean, it'’s been forever,

509
00:28:22,396 --> 00:28:24,833
and I was yea small,
and you were yea tall,

510
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:26,269
and now you'’re, like, yea!

511
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:28,924
Hey, you think
monster puberty was easy?

512
00:28:28,968 --> 00:28:32,623
Sorry. This is a real thing
I'’m offering you.

513
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:34,103
Look, I have my dad'’s playbook.

514
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:36,932
I could coach you up,
get you a big match in Stoker,

515
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:39,543
and, boom,
both our problems are solved.

516
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:43,286
[chuckling] You think
you'’re gonna coach me?

517
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:47,029
Oh, Stevie!

518
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:51,033
What are you still doing here?
Go get me my money, man!

519
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:53,732
Help me.

520
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:56,517
Oh, Klonk,
you'’re on mani-pedi duty.

521
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,214
[Klonk] Oh, no. No!

522
00:28:58,258 --> 00:28:59,128
So, Coach...

523
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:01,304
[clears throat] Stoker?Yes!

524
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:06,788
Isn'’t this just great?
It'’ll just be like old times
again, you know?

525
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:10,270
Pretty sure that doesn'’t
mean the same thing
to me as it does to you.

526
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:14,448
Hey. Are you gonna make me
walk to Stoker?

527
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:15,971
Yep. I am.

528
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,234
All the way?All the way.

529
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:20,628
Come on.
Just give me a ride, Rayburn.

530
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:23,370
Never call me
that name again.

531
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:27,417
Okay. I'’ll never
call you that again...
if you give me a ride.

532
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:28,767
[groans]

533
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:33,946
[yawns]

534
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:41,257
Comfy up there?

535
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:44,913
You must be exhausted
from ruining my life.

536
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:47,611
Need a pillow?
Maybe a chocolate?

537
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:50,440
Sorry we don'’t provide
turndown service.

538
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,013
[sighs]

539
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:10,373
Whoa.

540
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:16,945
Wow. This place
hasn'’t changed a bit.

541
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:20,122
[Winnie] I know.
It'’s magical, isn't it?

542
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,820
It'’s still got that--
[sniffs]

543
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:25,040
mmm, that smell
of sweat and feet.

544
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:27,260
Ah. Really big feet.

545
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:31,090
You'’re a real weird kid.
Real weird.

546
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,135
[Winnie] Yeah, I know.
[chuckles]

547
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,835
You know, Steve,
you'’re not the first person
to say that to me, actually.

548
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:38,401
You'’re really not.

549
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:51,501
Whoo!

550
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:55,679
It looks
just like you, Dad.

551
00:30:55,723 --> 00:30:57,986
You wanna live up
to the Rayburn name?Yeah.

552
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:02,556
It'’s gonna take a lot more
than some fancy dance moves,
Junior.

553
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,384
Time to get serious.

554
00:31:06,603 --> 00:31:07,996
[Winnie] Steve?

555
00:31:08,736 --> 00:31:10,085
Steve?

556
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:12,827
-Steve!
-[shouts]

557
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,004
Are you okay?Oh, sure. Never better.

558
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:17,571
[sighs]

559
00:31:21,053 --> 00:31:24,404
Look, I know
you don'’t wanna be here.

560
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:29,365
And I'’m really sorry
that I messed things up
for you in Pittsmore.

561
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:32,629
But if we don'’t do this,

562
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:36,982
they'’re gonna knock down
the stadium and turn it
into a parking lot,

563
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:39,375
and that'’s all
I have left of Dad.

564
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,901
And your dad is
part of that too.A parking lot?

565
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:44,250
Yep.

566
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:46,252
No monster, no money.

567
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:48,515
Maybe it'’s for the best.What?

568
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:51,561
How can you say that?
That'’s our dads' legacy!

569
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:55,435
I hate to break it to you,
but saving that stadium
won'’t bring him back.

570
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:58,917
I know that. I just thought
you might actually care
about helping--

571
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,095
Let'’s get something straight.
I love wrestling.
I loved my dad.

572
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:04,705
But I'’m not gonna be him.

573
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:06,533
Especially for you.

574
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:07,969
I'’m gonna be me.

575
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,841
And who are you, Steve?

576
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:15,716
I'’m the guy
who'’s here for the money.
You got me?

577
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,587
Oh, I got you.

578
00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:19,415
Money all the way.

579
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:24,464
You should probably
get some rest.
We start training tomorrow.

580
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:26,509
[chuckling]

581
00:32:26,553 --> 00:32:28,947
Training.
Yeah, right. Good one.

582
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,340
6:00 a.m. Sharp.

583
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,908
You'’re-- You'’re serious?

584
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,997
[crickets chirping]

585
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,521
-[alarm blaring]
-[gasps] What?

586
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,272
-Good morning.
-Hi, Mom.

587
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:53,014
How are you feeling?
You ready?

588
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:54,885
[sighs]

589
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:57,149
Do you think
I can do this?

590
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:59,934
I think you won'’t know
until you try.

591
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,457
Just remember:

592
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:05,157
Train the monster you have,
not the one you wish you had.

593
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,072
Did Dad say that?

594
00:33:07,115 --> 00:33:10,031
Uh, no.
Mom did, just now.

595
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:11,990
[sighs] Okay.

596
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:14,035
Hey. You forgetting
something?

597
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,951
Oh. Mwah!
See you tonight.

598
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,997
I meant these.

599
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:22,304
Dad'’s keys?

600
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:25,829
You tell Rayburn--
I mean, Steve--

601
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:27,657
that Mrs. C says hi.

602
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,007
Now, go coach him.

603
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,660
Yes!

604
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:34,099
[gasping]

605
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:39,147
[shouting]

606
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:44,892
Whoa!

607
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:46,763
Whoo!

608
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:49,853
Morning, Fred!Whoa!

609
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:52,204
Namaste, Winnie!

610
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:58,688
Whoo-hoo!

611
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:02,127
Whoa!

612
00:34:06,435 --> 00:34:07,871
What-- Hey, come back!

613
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:09,482
[door closes]

614
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:12,485
Steve.

615
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,443
You ready?

616
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:17,881
Hey. Rise and shine.

617
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:19,970
Hey, Steve, wake up!What?

618
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:23,322
I had this terrible dream
that I promised I would
get up and train.

619
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:24,540
Oh, it'’s real!

620
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:26,977
So, are you ready?
Let'’s do this.

621
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:29,676
Go ahead. You start.
Set up all the cones
or whatever.

622
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,853
Oh, ho! No, you don'’t.
Up and at '’em, sunshine.

623
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:37,205
It is go time. Game day.
Ain'’t no time like the present.

624
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:39,468
Man, why can'’t I think of
more sports clichés?

625
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:42,384
Uh... Well, until I do,
let'’s train.

626
00:34:42,428 --> 00:34:44,865
You are a rude little girl.

627
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:47,215
Scooch your booty!
[grunting]

628
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:49,043
This is important.

629
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,610
With a capital I.

630
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:55,180
Yeah, well,
I never really felt
training was important.

631
00:34:55,832 --> 00:34:57,399
I can tell.

632
00:34:57,443 --> 00:35:00,620
No one thinks we can do this,
but we'’re gonna show them.

633
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:05,190
I'’m going back to sleep.

634
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:07,105
You are not, mister!

635
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:10,891
You just go get me that match,
and I'’ll take care of the rest.

636
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:15,548
Okay. I'’ll get you a match.

637
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,073
[hooting]

638
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:23,121
[announcer] Welcome,
everyone, to an evening
of monster wrestling!

639
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:24,731
Weighing in at 18 tons,

640
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:28,430
you know him, you love him,
you'’re scared of him:

641
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:32,608
Wham Bam
Ramarilla Jackson!

642
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:35,568
Here comes the Rammer Hammer!

643
00:35:36,873 --> 00:35:40,225
-Rama, Rama, Rama!
-Rilla, Rilla, Rilla!

644
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:43,880
Boom! Boom!
It'’s Ramarilla time!

645
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:47,449
[exclaiming]

646
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:49,973
Oh, wow. This guy'’s
a real showman.

647
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:52,150
Okay. Everything we need

648
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:54,804
is in here, in here,
and in--

649
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:56,980
Oh, this is original.
Are you for real?

650
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:59,809
What do you think
you'’re doing right now?I'’m doing my coach speech.

651
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:03,683
Do I look like the kind
of guy who'’s gonna go
for the "rah-rah" stuff?

652
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:08,296
Fine.
Then let'’s talk strategy.

653
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,080
You wanna feint
a Reverse STO.Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

654
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:12,344
And then when we get him
behind you--You know what?

655
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:14,302
I think I'’m just gonna go
with what I know.

656
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:15,956
-For reals?
-Yeah, for realsies.

657
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:18,741
No. I'’m your coach,
and we need a strategy.

658
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:21,657
Trust me. I got this.
Watch and learn.

659
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:25,313
You know the rules.
I want a good,
clean wrestling match.

660
00:36:25,357 --> 00:36:28,186
So if you'’re gonna do
something illegal,
don'’t let me see it.

661
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,449
Go to your corners
and come out wrestling!

662
00:36:30,492 --> 00:36:33,060
Not too hard, right?

663
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:36,368
Sorry. I just love
to laugh. That'’s me.I ain'’t laughing.

664
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:38,674
But I will be
when I pin your face
in the dirt

665
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:40,720
and break your jaw
with my horns!

666
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:44,332
Boy, does that sound painful.
Can'’t wait.

667
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:46,073
[bell rings][roars]

668
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:49,772
[announcer]
And here come the wrestlers,
circling each other.

669
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:53,559
Hey, why don'’t you circle down
to Georgie'’s Mattress Outlet?

670
00:36:54,864 --> 00:36:58,128
Oh, gosh, you really
got me on that!

671
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:00,392
I think I'’m knocked out.

672
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:03,525
I am going down. Timber.

673
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:06,136
-[all gasp]
-[announcer] Wow.

674
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,531
Usually these things last
long enough for me to
get through a few more ads.

675
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:11,098
-One!
-What are you doing?

676
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:12,708

when he'’s all punched out,
we make our move.

00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:24,634
-Or sitting is another one.
I like sitting.
-Not helping.

844
00:45:24,678 --> 00:45:27,550
Did I mention sitting?
I feel like I did. Oh, eating!

845
00:45:27,594 --> 00:45:29,639
Is there anything else?

846
00:45:29,683 --> 00:45:33,948
Oh, there'’s also salsa,
but, uh, yeah, that'’s it.
That'’s probably it.

847
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,821
Like, with chips?

848
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:39,562
I said it very clear.
I said salsa.

849
00:45:39,606 --> 00:45:42,652
Like salsa, salsa?

850
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:44,219
I don'’t like dancing.

851
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:46,613
Is that so?

852
00:45:46,656 --> 00:45:48,876
[salsa music playing]

853
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:54,447
Okay, yes!

854
00:45:56,623 --> 00:45:59,669
There'’s nothing on this planet
I love more than dancing.

855
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:02,455
I mean, you know, I prefer
traditional Cuban salsa,

856
00:46:02,498 --> 00:46:05,327
but this up-tempo stuff'’s
pretty cool too.

857
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:07,373
Ha! You'’re a surprisingly
good dancer.

858
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:11,899
I ran with a pretty fast crowd
in Cuba when my dad
wrestled down there.

859
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:14,859
Wrestling is 80% footwork.

860
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:19,515
Yeah, I learned
the tango in Argentina,
the flamenco in Spain.

861
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:23,693
Well, anyway,
that was a different life.
How about this?

862
00:46:23,737 --> 00:46:26,784
Hold on.Not bad for 22 tons.

863
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:29,308
[salsa music continues]

864
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:57,118
Whoa! [groans]

865
00:46:58,554 --> 00:46:59,860
Left foot.Left foot.

866
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:01,166
Right foot.Right foot.

867
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:04,473
Left.And big finish!

868
00:47:04,517 --> 00:47:05,997
[laughing]

869
00:47:09,435 --> 00:47:10,958
Oh, yeah!

870
00:47:11,002 --> 00:47:13,874
[crowd cheering]

871
00:47:17,356 --> 00:47:18,618
[exclaims]

872
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:21,273
[Winnie]
You'’re doing great!

873
00:47:22,143 --> 00:47:24,450
All right, where is he?

874
00:47:24,493 --> 00:47:25,886
[growls]

875
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,409
I can'’t even see him.

876
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:34,852
This guy is crazy fast.

877
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:36,288
[trilling]

878
00:47:36,331 --> 00:47:39,465
You'’ve gotta slow him down.
Execute Plan Tango!

879
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:53,392
Yes, yes! Keep it up!
It'’s working!

880
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,438
Yes! Now!

881
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,963
-[groans]
-[gasps]

882
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:01,661
[bell rings]Steve won!

883
00:48:01,704 --> 00:48:03,532
Yeah! Oh!

884
00:48:03,576 --> 00:48:06,448
This is embarrassing nonsense
we'’re witnessing right now.

885
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:10,452
[upbeat music playing]

886
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,371
[Steve] What are you doing?

887
00:48:16,415 --> 00:48:18,939
I'’m learning to dance
so I can coach you better.

888
00:48:18,983 --> 00:48:21,246
No, no, no, no.
You are not dancing.

889
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:23,639
See? Look.
See what I'’m doing?

890
00:48:23,683 --> 00:48:26,904
[chuckles] I'’m trying.Man, you gotta get out more.

891
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:32,605
Hey, Steve, wake up!
Are you pretending
to be asleep right now?

892
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:34,389
[gasps]

893
00:48:34,433 --> 00:48:35,477
[exclaims]

894
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,224
-[panting]
-Two!

895
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,282
[exclaiming]

896
00:48:59,414 --> 00:49:00,938
[screams]

897
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:05,290
Come on, push it, Steve.
Pain is weakness
leaving the body.

898
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,468
I'’m awake! Whoa!

899
00:49:14,342 --> 00:49:15,387
Yes.

900
00:49:25,136 --> 00:49:28,748
-Yes!
-Steve! Whoo-hoo! Up top.

901
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:30,315
Now you'’re dancing.

902
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:48,550
Okay, so, there'’s no spots
left in the Saturday
Super Smashdown.

903
00:49:48,594 --> 00:49:53,033
But some lizard dude
in the Eastern League is
shedding his skin right now.

904
00:49:53,077 --> 00:49:54,861
Ew! Gross!

905
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:56,428
Ugh! I know.

906
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:59,344
So, they'’ll take us
as a replacement!

907
00:50:00,736 --> 00:50:03,609
The only catch is,
this guy you'’re gonna wrestle,

908
00:50:03,652 --> 00:50:06,090
he is really big.

909
00:50:07,134 --> 00:50:08,657
Like, I mean, huge!

910
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:12,531
Think of the biggest thing
you'’ve ever seen. Enormous!

911
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:16,709
Oh, come on.

912
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:21,018
-It'’s in my mouth!
-Ugh!

913
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:24,543
The only way
we'’re gonna beat him is
by getting him on his back.

914
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:27,546
-So how do we do that?
-[Winnie] Wait for it.

915
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:30,244
-[cries out]
-We'’re gonna need some help.

916
00:50:30,288 --> 00:50:34,683
Long time no see, Steve.

917
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:37,512
What? [gasps, groans]

918
00:50:37,556 --> 00:50:38,644
Okay, get ready.

919
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:41,560
Nobody puts Ray-Ray
in a corner.

920
00:50:41,603 --> 00:50:43,127
[chortling]

921
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:45,346
[Winnie] Now, lift!

922
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,174
Come on.Lift me!

923
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:49,742
[Winnie]
Do it again! Again!

924
00:50:51,004 --> 00:50:52,571
That'’s it. You got it.

925
00:50:53,876 --> 00:50:55,443
Whee!

926
00:50:55,487 --> 00:50:57,576
[Winnie]
And now, do the lift!

927
00:51:04,757 --> 00:51:06,324
[grunting]

928
00:51:07,238 --> 00:51:09,414
[screaming]

929
00:51:09,457 --> 00:51:11,024
[sighs]

930
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,113
[groans][bell rings]

931
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:14,854
You did it! You won!

932
00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:17,987
Oh, come on, Mac.
This ain'’t monster wrestling.

933
00:51:18,031 --> 00:51:20,381
It'’s an affront to the sport,
and you know it.

934
00:51:20,425 --> 00:51:22,209
We all should be shocked
and appalled.

935
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:25,517
But somehow they'’ve won
three in a row.

936
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,129
And the way he combines
traditional Cuban salsa

937
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:30,870
with a hint of modern swing

938
00:51:30,913 --> 00:51:33,873
and then finishes
with a lovely technical lift,

939
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:37,442
that is a high degree
of difficulty right there.

940
00:51:37,485 --> 00:51:40,532
Your knowledge of dance moves
is mystifying to me.

941
00:51:40,575 --> 00:51:44,362
Still waters run deep, Marc.
Still waters run deep.

942
00:51:44,405 --> 00:51:47,582
Right, Mac. Joining us now
from their latest match

943
00:51:47,626 --> 00:51:50,237
is Winnie Coyle
and Steve the Stupendous.

944
00:51:50,281 --> 00:51:52,152
-[cheering]
-Well, guys,

945
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:54,067
congratulations
on your latest win.

946
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,808
But, please,
somebody admit it.

947
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:58,637
This is hardly wrestling.
Y'’all know that, right?

948
00:52:01,727 --> 00:52:03,903
Uh, Coach Winnie,
we'’re live.

949
00:52:03,946 --> 00:52:06,645
Live? We'’re-- We're live.
Right. Right. We'’re live.

950
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:08,908
[chuckles] You know--
You know what?

951
00:52:08,951 --> 00:52:12,085
It is a little hot in here.
I could use a fan.

952
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,479
Speaking of,
I am a fan to you, Marc.

953
00:52:14,522 --> 00:52:18,570
Big fan. Uh, you know,
but just what you said before--

954
00:52:18,613 --> 00:52:22,617
If it is hardly wrestling,
then how come we just
keep winning?

955
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:25,794
Ho, ho!
She got you there, Marc.Whatever.

956
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:28,754
You won a couple
against some very, very
questionable opponents.

957
00:52:28,797 --> 00:52:32,323
I'’ll give you that much.
But what'’s next
for Steve the Stupendous?

958
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:34,629
You know, I was hoping
you would ask that.

959
00:52:34,673 --> 00:52:36,501
We are ready
for our next match.

960
00:52:36,544 --> 00:52:40,244
And you know where we want it?
Back in Stoker!

961
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:41,984
Stoker!Stoker!

962
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:43,551
You tell '’em, Winnie!

963
00:52:43,595 --> 00:52:46,641
That'’s right! We'll wrestle
any monster anytime!

964
00:52:46,685 --> 00:52:50,079
So, monsters, coaches,
you think you want a crack

965
00:52:50,123 --> 00:52:54,171
at the undefeated, unbeatable
Steve the Stupendous,

966
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:55,694
you give me a call.

967
00:52:55,737 --> 00:52:58,479
You think you'’re ready
for a big match in Stoker?

968
00:52:58,523 --> 00:53:01,178
Jimothy.
Hey, you watching this?

969
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:04,703
Look at me. I'’m shaking.

970
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:07,009
Oh, my gosh.
I'’m still shaking so much.

971
00:53:07,053 --> 00:53:10,926
Look at my hands!
Was I too much back there?
I was too much, right?

972
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:13,233
Yeah, well,
when it comes to wrestling,

973
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:15,279
"too much" isn'’t really a thing.

974
00:53:15,322 --> 00:53:18,717
-Oh, right.
-Okay. What do we do now, Coach?

975
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,327
Now? We wait.

976
00:53:20,371 --> 00:53:22,460
[ringtone: monster roaring][gasps]

977
00:53:22,503 --> 00:53:26,246
Hello. This is
Coach Winnie Coyle.
Uh-- Oh.

978
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,074
It'’s King Gorge's coach.
It worked!

979
00:53:28,117 --> 00:53:31,860
Really? He wants to wrestle
Steve the Stupendous?

980
00:53:31,904 --> 00:53:34,776
In Stoker?
He'’ll gladly accept.

981
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,866
[exclaims]
We got a match in Stoker!

982
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:42,044
All right. Okay, King,
I'’ve got you a match
you can'’t lose.

983
00:53:42,088 --> 00:53:44,090
[whining]

984
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:45,700
Oh, come on, King!

985
00:53:45,744 --> 00:53:49,095
It'’ll get
your confidence back up.
Make you feel good.

986
00:53:49,138 --> 00:53:50,792
[whimpering]

987
00:53:52,881 --> 00:53:55,362
New sign is looking good,
Fred.

988
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:57,930
Thanks, Winnie.
I made it myself.

989
00:53:57,973 --> 00:54:01,368
Took me seven sheets
to spell "stupendous" correctly!

990
00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:04,197
S-T-O-K-E-R!

991
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,285
Stoker!

992
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:07,548
[Winnie] S-T-E-V-E!

993
00:54:07,592 --> 00:54:11,683
-[Steve] Steve!
-[both] Stoker! Steve!

994
00:54:14,947 --> 00:54:16,035
What'’s going on?

995
00:54:16,078 --> 00:54:17,515
I'’m sorry, Winnie.

996
00:54:17,558 --> 00:54:20,082
I know all of this
really old,

997
00:54:20,126 --> 00:54:23,521
completely useless stuff
means a lot to you,

998
00:54:23,564 --> 00:54:24,957
but we gotta
clear it out.

999
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,699
They need to rig this place
to blow...

1000
00:54:27,742 --> 00:54:29,918
-What?
-...up and explode.

1001
00:54:29,962 --> 00:54:33,008
No, no, no. They can'’t
do that! We don'’t need
to sell to Jimothy.

1002
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:36,360
That'’s mine.We just got a match
right here in Stoker.

1003
00:54:36,403 --> 00:54:40,581
Listen, Jimothy sweetened
the deal if we moved up
the signing date.

1004
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:43,932
So, it'’s a lot of money.Uh, what? [sighs]

1005
00:54:43,976 --> 00:54:46,283
Please, there must be
something you can do.

1006
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:48,110
I'’m sorry.
You'’re too late.

1007
00:54:48,154 --> 00:54:52,419
The mayor is signing the deal
at Slitherpoole Stadium
this afternoon.

1008
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:53,768
Drink Tentaculade,

1009
00:54:53,812 --> 00:54:56,684
the official drink
of the greatest time of--

1010
00:54:56,728 --> 00:54:58,120
Uh, line?

1011
00:54:58,164 --> 00:55:02,124
Tentaculade,
the official drink
of the great-- Um, no.

1012
00:55:02,168 --> 00:55:05,432
The official great--
Drink greatness! This time--

1013
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:08,000
Oh! This tastes disgusting.

1014
00:55:08,043 --> 00:55:11,090
I can'’t believe
this is my drink.
Who approved this?

1015
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:12,700
That was you, T.Oh, me? Oh.

1016
00:55:12,744 --> 00:55:14,702
Okay, let'’s take five,
everyone.

1017
00:55:14,746 --> 00:55:16,791
[bell ringing][cameraman] All right,
everyone. Let'’s reset.

1018
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:20,142
Mr. Jimothy? Uh, the mayor
of Stoker is here for you.

1019
00:55:20,186 --> 00:55:22,319
I'’d really just like
to thank you, Mr. Jimothy.

1020
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:25,496
You'’ve really saved our bacon.
Gosh, I'’m hungry.

1021
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:27,672
Oh, me too.
Intermittent fast day.

1022
00:55:27,715 --> 00:55:30,805
I'’ve been doing it for
a week now, and my blood sugar
is going banana--

1023
00:55:30,849 --> 00:55:33,721
I'’m having a cookie.
Can someone grab me
a cookie real quick?

1024
00:55:33,765 --> 00:55:38,465
Stop! We don'’t need to do this.
Mr. Mayor, don'’t sign.

1025
00:55:38,509 --> 00:55:40,728
I already did.I love this part.

1026
00:55:40,772 --> 00:55:43,078
I'’m nervous.
I was practicing
my signature yesterday.

1027
00:55:43,122 --> 00:55:45,429
I realize that
I just scribble,
but watch.

1028
00:55:45,472 --> 00:55:46,821
Just hold on!What?

1029
00:55:46,865 --> 00:55:48,954
Mr. Jimothy, Stoker has
a new champion wrestler

1030
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:51,173
that everyone in Stoker
is gonna come see.

1031
00:55:51,217 --> 00:55:52,610
So we don'’t need your money.

1032
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:54,481
Is that true, Winnie?Yes.

1033
00:55:54,525 --> 00:55:58,572
Steve over here
just got a big-time match
in Stoker against King Gorge.

1034
00:55:58,616 --> 00:56:00,008
That'’s right.

1035
00:56:00,052 --> 00:56:01,401
[laughing]

1036
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:03,838
King Gorge? Oh, man.

1037
00:56:03,882 --> 00:56:07,102
He hasn'’t come out
of his kennel
since I destroyed him.

1038
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,278
He'’s broken.

1039
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:10,976
Everybody in the game
knows that.

1040
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:14,980
This is so embarrassing for you.
You haven'’t seen this?

1041
00:56:15,023 --> 00:56:17,678
[Tentacular]
Old Gorge is never
gonna wrestle again.

1042
00:56:17,722 --> 00:56:19,985
And even if he did,

1043
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:22,422
it ain'’t gonna be
in Stoker Stadium.

1044
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:24,163
Sign the papers,
Jimothy.

1045
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:26,383
I don'’t understand.

1046
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:28,385
Oh, you still don'’t get it,
do you?

1047
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:30,212
It was never
about the money.

1048
00:56:30,256 --> 00:56:33,868
Stoker Stadium
is coming down
because I want it to.

1049
00:56:33,912 --> 00:56:35,609
But why?

1050
00:56:35,653 --> 00:56:39,874
Because no matter how many
championships I win,

1051
00:56:39,918 --> 00:56:45,706
some chump'’s always
gonna be telling me that
I'’m not as good as Rayburn.

1052
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:49,580
So I figure I can live
in his shadow,

1053
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:53,061
or I can tear down
everything

1054
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:55,107
that casts that shadow.

1055
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,630
Boom!

1056
00:56:56,674 --> 00:56:59,981
Wow. And I thought I had issues.
That'’s just crazy.

1057
00:57:00,025 --> 00:57:03,028
Who asked you?
You make me sick.

1058
00:57:03,071 --> 00:57:05,291
Dancin'’ ain't wrestlin'’.

1059
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:07,249
You'’re pathetic.

1060
00:57:07,293 --> 00:57:09,513
-Hey, hey, put him down!
-Okay.

1061
00:57:09,556 --> 00:57:11,558
[grunts, groans]

1062
00:57:11,602 --> 00:57:14,996
Oh! This is gonna go
so viral!

1063
00:57:18,783 --> 00:57:21,176
Please don'’t do this.

1064
00:57:22,003 --> 00:57:24,658
That stadium is
everything to that town.

1065
00:57:25,311 --> 00:57:26,617
To me.

1066
00:57:27,313 --> 00:57:29,489
Please don'’t take that away.

1067
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:32,274
Winnie,
this isn'’t about you.

1068
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:34,102
It'’s all about me.

1069
00:57:34,146 --> 00:57:35,669
Sign the papers, Jimothy.

1070
00:57:39,847 --> 00:57:42,633
[seethes]
You'’re okay with this?

1071
00:57:42,676 --> 00:57:45,287
With him destroying
everything you and Dad built?

1072
00:57:45,331 --> 00:57:48,508
Winnie,
let me tell you something.
I loved your dad.

1073
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:50,467
And he did great things
with Rayburn.

1074
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:53,818
But now it'’s my chance
to do great things
with Tentacular.

1075
00:57:53,861 --> 00:57:55,297
That'’s just wrestling.

1076
00:57:55,341 --> 00:57:56,777
[groaning]

1077
00:57:58,257 --> 00:58:01,826
What you'’re doing
with this dancing,

1078
00:58:01,869 --> 00:58:04,872
I'’m just glad
Jimbo ain'’t around
to see it.

1079
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:33,988
[sighs]

1080
00:58:34,032 --> 00:58:35,555
[sighs]

1081
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,602
[groans]

1082
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:42,649
You have enough money
to pay Lady Mayhen now.

1083
00:58:42,693 --> 00:58:46,131
You don'’t need me.
Just leave me alone.

1084
00:58:46,174 --> 00:58:47,524
Even if I wanted to...

1085
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:48,742
[grunts]

1086
00:58:48,786 --> 00:58:51,049
...I'’m pretty sure
I live here now.

1087
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:55,053
[sighs] I thought I was
saving my dad'’s legacy.

1088
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,709
And instead, I ruined it.

1089
00:58:58,752 --> 00:59:01,929
I'’ve made
the Coyle name a joke.

1090
00:59:01,973 --> 00:59:03,365
Well, the good news is,

1091
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:06,325
you can always
change your name
and run away.

1092
00:59:06,368 --> 00:59:08,196
That worked for you, Steve.

1093
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,853
But if I'’m not Winnie Coyle,
I'’m nothing.

1094
00:59:14,246 --> 00:59:15,943
Come on, Winnie.

1095
00:59:20,774 --> 00:59:24,561
What a sad end
to the legacy of Stoker.

1096
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:26,301
I told you, Mac! I told you!

1097
00:59:26,345 --> 00:59:29,609
The whole thing was a joke
and a disgrace to the sport!

1098
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:32,046
To the Coyle name!
I'’ll tell you that too!

1099
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:34,571
And I for one
am glad it'’s over.

1100
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:38,444
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

1101
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:39,967
And I still think

1102
00:59:40,011 --> 00:59:42,927
Steve has a bright
dancing future ahead of him.

1103
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:45,364
Oh, please! Who cares
about dancing, anyway?

1104
00:59:45,407 --> 00:59:48,236
Everyone cares about dancing!
Live a little, Marc!

1105
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,282
[thunder crashes]

1106
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:57,463
Look who'’s back.

1107
00:59:57,506 --> 00:59:59,900
[sighs] It'’s all there.

1108
00:59:59,944 --> 01:00:03,556
I should know,
'’cause I counted
every dollar bill,

1109
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,776
and they are--
they'’re tiny.

1110
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:09,649
Ah. Your old locker'’s
waiting, Steve.

1111
01:00:12,304 --> 01:00:13,610
[sighs]

1112
01:00:15,133 --> 01:00:18,397
[Lady Mayhen]
Welcome back, twinkle toes.
We missed you.

1113
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,443
It seems like you are
the hot new favorite

1114
01:00:21,487 --> 01:00:23,358
after all of your adventures.

1115
01:00:23,402 --> 01:00:25,186
Cha-cha-cha!

1116
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,841
We got a lot of money on you
to win tonight.

1117
01:00:27,885 --> 01:00:33,760
And I'’m gonna keep all of it
when you lose.

1118
01:00:33,804 --> 01:00:35,762
Yeah, I know the drill.

1119
01:00:35,806 --> 01:00:39,810
You always were
my best loser.

1120
01:00:42,551 --> 01:00:46,077
[door opens, closes]

1121
01:01:02,354 --> 01:01:06,010
[people chattering][vehicles revving]

1122
01:01:18,196 --> 01:01:19,371
[sighs]

1123
01:01:23,854 --> 01:01:27,771
Hey. You did
everything you could.

1124
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:30,730
Then why do I feel like
I let everyone down?

1125
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:32,732
Oh, honey, you didn'’t.

1126
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:36,257
What you did out there,
coaching Ray-Ray,

1127
01:01:36,301 --> 01:01:37,955
you were incredible.

1128
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:40,131
You should be so proud
of yourself.

1129
01:01:40,174 --> 01:01:43,874
It'’s okay, Mom.
I don'’t care
about that anymore.

1130
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:48,748
Froyo. Froyo makes
everything better.

1131
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:50,576
What flavor do you want?

1132
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:52,404
Chocolate.You got it.

1133
01:01:57,931 --> 01:01:59,716
[door closes]

1134
01:01:59,759 --> 01:02:01,456
[sighs]

1135
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,371
[screams]

1136
01:02:03,415 --> 01:02:05,722
Oh, my gosh.
What are you doing here?

1137
01:02:05,765 --> 01:02:08,028
Ow! Right in the eye!

1138
01:02:08,072 --> 01:02:10,204
I'’m sorry!No.

1139
01:02:10,248 --> 01:02:13,120
That'’s all right.
I should'’ve called first.

1140
01:02:13,164 --> 01:02:16,689
But, you know,
I don'’t have a phone.
Or pockets or...

1141
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:20,127
[chuckles] Look,
I need my coach back.

1142
01:02:20,171 --> 01:02:22,564
[scoffs] Don'’t you get it?

1143
01:02:22,608 --> 01:02:25,567
We'’re a total joke.
We don'’t belong in the ring.

1144
01:02:25,611 --> 01:02:29,354
Hey, you know that feeling
that you'’re feeling
right now?

1145
01:02:29,397 --> 01:02:31,008
That'’s how I felt
my whole life.

1146
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:33,750
I spent so much time
running away

1147
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:35,839
from what I thought
I should be

1148
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:38,798
or what people
expected me to be

1149
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:40,931
that I never found out
what I could be.

1150
01:02:40,974 --> 01:02:44,238
And now-- now I have.

1151
01:02:44,282 --> 01:02:48,329
And I know that
I'’m never gonna be the GOAT

1152
01:02:48,373 --> 01:02:51,768
or win the Big Belt,
and that is just fine.

1153
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:54,988
But I am not going back
to being a loser.

1154
01:02:55,684 --> 01:02:57,251
And that'’s on you.

1155
01:02:57,295 --> 01:02:59,166
You ruined losing
for me.

1156
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:02,387
And you know what?
It feels good.

1157
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:06,260
I feel good for, like,
the first time.

1158
01:03:06,304 --> 01:03:08,785
So, thank you.

1159
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:11,265
Rayburn, I...

1160
01:03:14,486 --> 01:03:16,140
Thank you.Mmm.

1161
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:20,231
Okay, okay.
Enough with the sappy stuff.

1162
01:03:20,274 --> 01:03:21,362
Ugh.

1163
01:03:21,406 --> 01:03:24,278
I am here to help you
save that stadium.

1164
01:03:24,322 --> 01:03:25,584
What?

1165
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:29,588
[Jimothy]
With this super-sweet
satellite parking lot,

1166
01:03:29,631 --> 01:03:32,460
you'’ll be able to park
on quality asphalt.

1167
01:03:32,504 --> 01:03:34,898
Stuff you guys haven'’t seen
in a while.

1168
01:03:34,941 --> 01:03:38,162
And we'’ve put some beautiful
yellow lines right on there.

1169
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:40,468
And then you can take
the shuttle--

1170
01:03:40,512 --> 01:03:43,776
Uh, is that a fin on top?
[laughs] I'’ll never tell--

1171
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,953
and see Tentacular wrestle
once again

1172
01:03:46,997 --> 01:03:50,957
in classy and distant
Slitherpoole.

1173
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:53,133
-[jeering]
-[Fred] Hot dogs are on you!

1174
01:03:53,177 --> 01:03:56,484
Hey, buddy. I'’m getting hurt.
If we can blow this up
and get out, that'’d be great.

1175
01:03:56,528 --> 01:03:57,834
With pleasure!

1176
01:03:57,877 --> 01:04:00,227
Five, four, three,
two, one. Go!

1177
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:02,403
[gasping]

1178
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:07,669
-Ha!
-[quizzical grunts]

1179
01:04:08,888 --> 01:04:13,110
-Well, that was disappointing.
-[hip-hop music playing]

1180
01:04:13,153 --> 01:04:16,983
What'’s the matter, boys?
You show up, but no blow up.

1181
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:19,986
-Oh, not these clowns again.
-That'’s right.

1182
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:21,770
What,
are you scared of clowns?

1183
01:04:21,814 --> 01:04:25,513
I mean, obviously some
of them seem kinda creepy,
but, you know, us?

1184
01:04:25,557 --> 01:04:29,735
Yeah! And we'’re here
to challenge you,
you big jabroni!

1185
01:04:29,778 --> 01:04:31,258
Jabroni?You heard her.

1186
01:04:31,302 --> 01:04:34,087
I'’m calling you out,
"Spentacular."

1187
01:04:34,131 --> 01:04:38,352
I'’m gonna wrestle you
right here in Stoker.

1188
01:04:38,396 --> 01:04:39,788
No. Yeah, right!

1189
01:04:39,832 --> 01:04:44,924
Why would I wrestle
a nobody loser
like you, Steve?

1190
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:48,623
Oh. My name is not Steve.

1191
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:53,585
I'’m the son of the greatest
monster wrestler of all time.

1192
01:04:53,628 --> 01:04:54,760
[all gasp]

1193
01:04:54,803 --> 01:04:58,024
My name is Rayburn Jr.

1194
01:04:58,068 --> 01:04:59,896
That'’s--It can'’t be.

1195
01:04:59,939 --> 01:05:03,682
Oh, yeah!
Feel the burn--
the Rayburn!

1196
01:05:03,725 --> 01:05:05,423
Yes!Rayburn!

1197
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:10,732
There is absolutely no way.
Are you kidding me?

1198
01:05:10,776 --> 01:05:13,387
-Oh, I see it.
-[panting]

1199
01:05:13,431 --> 01:05:14,693
Are you okay?

1200
01:05:14,736 --> 01:05:17,391
Yeah. Felt pretty good
to get it off my chest.

1201
01:05:17,435 --> 01:05:21,395
-You'’re Rayburn's kid?
-You bet he is.

1202
01:05:21,439 --> 01:05:24,050
If you really wanna blow up
Rayburn'’s legacy,

1203
01:05:24,094 --> 01:05:25,834
then fight his son.

1204
01:05:25,878 --> 01:05:28,881
He'’s standing right
in front of you.[crowd chanting "Rayburn"]

1205
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,362
I would destroy you!

1206
01:05:31,405 --> 01:05:33,364
Oh. Like you destroyed
King Gorge?

1207
01:05:33,407 --> 01:05:36,497
Why don'’t you "tell" us
all about that one.

1208
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:38,195
What? Oh, no.

1209
01:05:38,238 --> 01:05:41,285
What was it? The third round?
I bet we could beat that,
Rayburn.

1210
01:05:41,328 --> 01:05:44,984
We said one, not three.
We were gonna go for one round.

1211
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:46,681
I got excited.
Just go with it.

1212
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:50,598
[clears throat]
Um, right, three.
That'’s right.

1213
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:53,601
What? You think
you could go three rounds
with Tentacular?

1214
01:05:53,645 --> 01:05:56,561
[chortles]
I think we should make a bet.

1215
01:05:56,604 --> 01:05:59,346
A bet?We'’ll go
three rounds with you.

1216
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:03,698
And if I survive,
Stoker keeps the stadium.

1217
01:06:03,742 --> 01:06:08,660
I mean, unless
you'’re ch-ch-ch-chicken.

1218
01:06:08,703 --> 01:06:11,010
[imitating chicken clucking][crowd laughing]

1219
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:14,927
Fine! It'’s on!
By the time
Tentacular'’s done,

1220
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:19,236
there'’s not gonna be
a thing left of you,
this town,

1221
01:06:19,279 --> 01:06:21,281
or your overrated dads.

1222
01:06:21,325 --> 01:06:24,023
Tentacular'’s
gonna bury it all.

1223
01:06:25,372 --> 01:06:26,721
Let'’s see you try.

1224
01:06:26,765 --> 01:06:30,203
Let'’s see you try
right here in Stoker.

1225
01:06:30,247 --> 01:06:34,512
[crowd cheering,
chanting "Stoker"]

1226
01:06:36,949 --> 01:06:38,995
[seethes]

1227
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:50,049
Incredible scenes in Stoker.
Rayburn Jr.

1228
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:52,182
That'’s right, son of
the legendary Rayburn...

1229
01:06:52,225 --> 01:06:53,574
What did he just say?

1230
01:06:53,618 --> 01:06:55,924
[speaking French]

1231
01:06:55,968 --> 01:06:59,493
[speaking Japanese]

1232
01:06:59,537 --> 01:07:03,628
-Holy--
-Guacamole and chips
for lunch today.

1233
01:07:03,671 --> 01:07:05,369
[bird caws]

1234
01:07:05,412 --> 01:07:08,850
And everyone is totally
super excited

1235
01:07:08,894 --> 01:07:12,680
for what they are calling
the match of the century.

1236
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:14,987
And though Rayburn Jr...Whoa!

1237
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,859
Steve is Rayburn Jr.!

1238
01:07:17,903 --> 01:07:21,080
Big boots to fill, Marc.
Well, if he'’d worn boots.

1239
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:25,041
But I'’m thinking about it now,
and I don'’t remember him
wearing boots. So scratch that.

1240
01:07:25,084 --> 01:07:28,348
But for now it'’s goodbye
Steve the Stupendous,

1241
01:07:28,392 --> 01:07:31,612
and hello, Rayburn Jr.!

1242
01:07:31,656 --> 01:07:34,093
[groans, sobbing]

1243
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:35,747
[groans]

1244
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:38,097
[Winnie] Okay, the town
has come together and built

1245
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:42,145
this spectacular
anti-Tentacular agility
and evasion training device,

1246
01:07:42,188 --> 01:07:46,236
otherwise known as
the Gauntlet of Doom!

1247
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:48,281
[Rayburn]
That'’s not a fun name.

1248
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:51,110
[Winnie] Nothing we'’ve done
comes close to going
three rounds with Tentacular.

1249
01:07:51,154 --> 01:07:52,807
But we might just have a shot

1250
01:07:52,851 --> 01:07:56,420
if you can survive the gauntlet
and reach my dad'’s statue.

1251
01:08:01,555 --> 01:08:02,469
Uh-oh.

1252
01:08:02,513 --> 01:08:04,384
All right, twinkle toes.

1253
01:08:04,428 --> 01:08:07,039
Put on your red shoes.
Let'’s dance.

1254
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,823
["Tubthumping" playing]

1255
01:08:08,867 --> 01:08:10,390
[shouts]

1256
01:08:10,434 --> 01:08:12,262
Ooh![Winnie]
Let'’s do it again.

1257
01:08:12,305 --> 01:08:14,568
[Rayburn exclaiming]

1258
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,617
[snoring]

1259
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:22,359
[Winnie]
The most important thing
you gotta do

1260
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:24,230
is neutralize Tentacular'’s
biggest threat.

1261
01:08:24,274 --> 01:08:26,102
His right hook.No, it'’s in his name.

1262
01:08:26,145 --> 01:08:28,800
[Rayburn] Oh, his tentacles.
I was gonna say his tentacles.

1263
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:34,240
We'’re gonna use every trick
you learned in the underground,

1264
01:08:34,284 --> 01:08:39,158
every step you learned
on your global dance journey
that you do not talk about.

1265
01:08:39,202 --> 01:08:40,594
Oh, come on!

1266
01:08:40,638 --> 01:08:43,249
[Winnie]
Every fake-out and foxtrot.

1267
01:08:47,297 --> 01:08:48,646
Singin'’ in the Rain.

1268
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:50,169
The Worm.

1269
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:51,692
Pop and lock.

1270
01:08:51,736 --> 01:08:54,347
They say offense
is the best defense?

1271
01:08:54,391 --> 01:08:57,133
No! Defense
is the best defense!

1272
01:08:57,176 --> 01:09:00,875
It doesn'’t have to look pretty.
It just has to get us through
the third.

1273
01:09:00,919 --> 01:09:03,139
Come on. That was pretty.

1274
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:04,618
To survival!

1275
01:09:04,662 --> 01:09:06,664
[cheering]

1276
01:09:11,669 --> 01:09:14,498
Ah-ah! You'’re not done yet.

1277
01:09:24,334 --> 01:09:26,901
[gasping]

1278
01:09:26,945 --> 01:09:29,165
[grunting]

1279
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:30,992
[panting]

1280
01:09:31,036 --> 01:09:33,952
[grunting]

1281
01:09:42,961 --> 01:09:45,050
Am I ready now?

1282
01:09:45,093 --> 01:09:48,271
Mm-hmm.
You'’re ready, Rayburn.

1283
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:55,234
Oh, yeah! I'’m stoked
to be back in Stoker.

1284
01:09:55,278 --> 01:09:58,455
[laughs] We all are!
Whoo!

1285
01:09:58,498 --> 01:10:01,284
Tonight is going to
go down in history

1286
01:10:01,327 --> 01:10:02,981
as the greatest match ever

1287
01:10:03,024 --> 01:10:05,113
or the shortest,
most painful embarrassment

1288
01:10:05,157 --> 01:10:07,290
to ever happen
in professional
monster wrestling.

1289
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:09,857
I'’m praying it's a great match,
'’cause I got something
to tell you.

1290
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:12,730
I am not interested
in going home tonight.

1291
01:10:14,558 --> 01:10:16,255
It sounds like
there'’s a story there,

1292
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:18,039
but I'’m gonna have to
cut you off, Marc,

1293
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:21,391
because I am just hearing
we'’re moments away

1294
01:10:21,434 --> 01:10:24,481
from the competitors
entering the ring.

1295
01:10:25,395 --> 01:10:27,527
[exhales sharply]You ready, champ?

1296
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:29,268
It'’s show time.

1297
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:35,753
[joints crack]

1298
01:10:45,371 --> 01:10:46,677
[groans]

1299
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:49,201
Well, that ruined
my cool entrance.

1300
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,855
[ring announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

1301
01:10:50,898 --> 01:10:55,163
World Monster Wrestling
presents a special event.

1302
01:10:55,207 --> 01:10:58,732
One stadium.
One last chance.

1303
01:10:58,776 --> 01:11:00,299
Two monsters.

1304
01:11:00,343 --> 01:11:04,434
The Smackdown
to Save the Stadium!

1305
01:11:05,783 --> 01:11:08,002
Let him win!In this corner,

1306
01:11:08,046 --> 01:11:10,527
weighing in at 22 tons,

1307
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:14,705
standing 43 feet tall,
from Stoker,

1308
01:11:14,748 --> 01:11:18,186
Rayburn Jr.!

1309
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:20,319
[salsa music playing]

1310
01:11:20,363 --> 01:11:22,669
[crowd cheering]

1311
01:11:22,713 --> 01:11:23,844
Oh, yeah.

1312
01:11:25,716 --> 01:11:27,761
-Rayburn Jr.!
-[Fred] You got this, Winnie!

1313
01:11:27,805 --> 01:11:29,763
[laughing]
Hey, everybody.

1314
01:11:29,807 --> 01:11:32,549
I know her!
She eats in my diner!

1315
01:11:32,592 --> 01:11:34,681
[Mac] Look at
the confidence, Marc.

1316
01:11:34,725 --> 01:11:36,857
[Marc] Somebody'’s gotta
say this about Rayburn Jr.

1317
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:41,035
We know he'’s audacious,
he'’s courageous, but three
rounds with Tentacular?

1318
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:43,560
What is he thinking?
He might be losing
his monster mind.

1319
01:11:43,603 --> 01:11:47,477
-I just don'’t know.
-[Mac] There is so much
riding on him tonight.

1320
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,306
Let'’s not forget to mention
that in his corner

1321
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:53,265
is the young rookie coach
Winnie Coyle.

1322
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:58,052
That'’s right: daughter
of the legendary coach
Jimbo Coyle.

1323
01:11:58,096 --> 01:12:00,968
Winnie, no matter
what happens tonight,

1324
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:03,884
your father would be
so proud of you.

1325
01:12:03,928 --> 01:12:05,364
Thanks, Mom.

1326
01:12:06,713 --> 01:12:09,934
[ring announcer] And now,
in his return to Stoker,

1327
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:13,938
the undefeated reigning
holder of the Big Belt:

1328
01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:16,941
Tentacular!

1329
01:12:16,984 --> 01:12:20,423
[crowd jeering]What'’s going on, Stoker?

1330
01:12:20,466 --> 01:12:22,207
Oh, you miss this?

1331
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,774
Forget about it!

1332
01:12:23,817 --> 01:12:26,516
'’Cause you ain't ever seeing
one of these again.

1333
01:12:33,044 --> 01:12:35,263
[Winnie] Ray, you okay?

1334
01:12:35,307 --> 01:12:37,483
Rayburn!
Are you with me?

1335
01:12:37,527 --> 01:12:39,398
[gasps]

1336
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:42,532
I am literally terrified.

1337
01:12:42,575 --> 01:12:46,274
I don'’t think I can do this.
I can'’t be him.

1338
01:12:46,318 --> 01:12:48,538
[Winnie] No, you can'’t.

1339
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,584
But we don'’t have to
be our dads.

1340
01:12:51,628 --> 01:12:55,066
We just have to be ourselves.
You showed me that.

1341
01:12:55,109 --> 01:12:59,375
They wrote their stories,
and we'’re writing ours
right now.

1342
01:12:59,418 --> 01:13:03,161
And, yeah, maybe theirs was all
dramatic and super serious,

1343
01:13:03,204 --> 01:13:07,252
and maybe ours is more like
a slapstick comedy.

1344
01:13:07,295 --> 01:13:08,471
Oh, I love those.

1345
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:10,995
Me too.
Especially ones about friends.

1346
01:13:12,475 --> 01:13:15,695
So, are you ready
to go out there
and look ridiculous tonight?

1347
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:17,610
Yes.How ridiculous?

1348
01:13:17,654 --> 01:13:19,656
Very, very ridiculous!

1349
01:13:19,699 --> 01:13:21,614
-And do we care?
-We don'’t care.

1350
01:13:21,658 --> 01:13:23,268
Uh, I can'’t hear you.

1351
01:13:23,311 --> 01:13:25,052
We do not care!

1352
01:13:25,096 --> 01:13:27,925
Now, buck up,
put your game face on,

1353
01:13:27,968 --> 01:13:31,363
because it'’s time
to wrestle.

1354
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,409
And dance. Both!

1355
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:38,196
Whoa. Time out.
Was that a coach speech?

1356
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,633
Man,
I feel so inspired!

1357
01:13:40,677 --> 01:13:42,113
You do?Yeah.

1358
01:13:42,156 --> 01:13:43,941
You should'’ve done that
before every match.

1359
01:13:43,984 --> 01:13:46,900
All right, wrestlers,
to the center of the ring.

1360
01:13:46,944 --> 01:13:49,076
Okay, let'’s go make it
through the third.

1361
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,427
And if you live,
let'’s get froyo afterwards.

1362
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:54,560
Oh, I love froyo.
Wait, if I live?

1363
01:13:54,604 --> 01:13:56,867
Okay, champ,
let'’s get this over quick.

1364
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:59,870
I got a hot date
at the Kaiju Lodge with Edna.
[chortles]

1365
01:13:59,913 --> 01:14:01,611
[growls]

1366
01:14:01,654 --> 01:14:04,309
I want a good, clean match,

1367
01:14:04,352 --> 01:14:06,267
and obey my rules
at all times.

1368
01:14:06,311 --> 01:14:09,532
Okay, touch appendages
and come out wrestling.

1369
01:14:10,968 --> 01:14:12,796
Ow! Ow!

1370
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,545
Let'’s dan--

1371
01:14:22,588 --> 01:14:24,068
-[gasps]
-[all gasp]

1372
01:14:24,111 --> 01:14:26,592
[sighs]
Guess I'’m going home.

1373
01:14:26,636 --> 01:14:27,941
Looks that way, Marc.

1374
01:14:27,985 --> 01:14:29,943
Yeah!What? I'’m texting.

1375
01:14:29,987 --> 01:14:31,771
Oh, did we win?
Should I celebrate?

1376
01:14:31,815 --> 01:14:34,208
No, wait. I'’m up.

1377
01:14:34,252 --> 01:14:37,951
That was a good shot.
Kind of lucky,
but I'’m all right.

1378
01:14:38,822 --> 01:14:40,084
What?

1379
01:14:40,867 --> 01:14:42,826
What are you waiting for?
Go get him.

1380
01:14:43,566 --> 01:14:45,524
[Marc] Oh, come on.
Really? Really?

1381
01:14:45,568 --> 01:14:47,091
Rayburn isn'’t even
trying to wrestle.

1382
01:14:47,134 --> 01:14:49,180
He thinks he'’s gonna dance
his way through this.

1383
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:53,184
It would appear that way, Marc.
And I gotta say it'’s working.

1384
01:14:53,227 --> 01:14:56,013
Watch his hands,
not his shimmering
salsa feet!

1385
01:14:56,056 --> 01:15:00,844
-Yes! That'’s it!
-[Marc] Really?
We came out here for this?

1386
01:15:00,887 --> 01:15:03,629
[Mac] Look at that!
Tentacular can'’t get near him!

1387
01:15:03,673 --> 01:15:05,631
Look out!

1388
01:15:05,675 --> 01:15:07,503
[Mac] Missed again.

1389
01:15:10,157 --> 01:15:11,855
[Marc] Here we go!
Oh, there it is!

1390
01:15:11,898 --> 01:15:14,205
Watch the tentacles!What?

1391
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:15,511
[Mac] Oh, and he gets away.

1392
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:17,382
-Oh! Right into the post!
-Yes!

1393
01:15:17,425 --> 01:15:19,515
[Marc] I can'’t believe
what I'’m seeing.

1394
01:15:19,558 --> 01:15:22,779
Rayburn hasn'’t landed
a single blow, and he'’s
still in the match.

1395
01:15:22,822 --> 01:15:24,258
[Rayburn]
Take that, traitor!

1396
01:15:25,259 --> 01:15:29,394
[Fred] Tonight'’s special:
fried calamari!

1397
01:15:29,437 --> 01:15:32,832
[Marc]
Tentacular is seething mad,
and I don'’t blame him one bit.

1398
01:15:32,876 --> 01:15:34,921
I mean, can we have
our money back?

1399
01:15:34,965 --> 01:15:38,534
Yeah, I really hate to sit here
and say that you'’re right
about anything, Marc,

1400
01:15:38,577 --> 01:15:42,276
but I'’m not even sure
we can call this a monster
wrestling match right now.

1401
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,932
We'’re doing this.
We'’re actually doing this.

1402
01:15:45,976 --> 01:15:48,631
Hey, stay focused.
We'’re not ordering
froyo yet.

1403
01:15:48,674 --> 01:15:51,416
Okay, champ,
he thinks he'’s got us
with his sweet moves,

1404
01:15:51,459 --> 01:15:54,550
but he don'’t know
we got a few moves of our own.

1405
01:15:54,593 --> 01:15:56,552
Why don'’t we ask him
to dance?

1406
01:15:56,595 --> 01:15:58,249
Don'’t mind if I do.

1407
01:15:58,728 --> 01:16:00,077
[crowd cheers]

1408
01:16:02,253 --> 01:16:05,430
Come on, Rayburn!
Dance around him, not with him!

1409
01:16:05,473 --> 01:16:07,998
[Mac] Looks like Siggy'’s
done his homework.

1410
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:10,348
Is that a Paso Doble
step routine?

1411
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:12,916
[Marc]
They'’re both dancing now.
Good grief.

1412
01:16:12,959 --> 01:16:15,048
I can'’t take this.
I can'’t take this.

1413
01:16:15,092 --> 01:16:18,399
[Marc] Look at Tentacular go!

1414
01:16:18,443 --> 01:16:20,053
Attaboy!

1415
01:16:20,097 --> 01:16:22,795
-[shouts]
-[Marc] What a sweet move.

1416
01:16:22,839 --> 01:16:24,797
-I'’m not watching.
-[Marc] There it is!

1417
01:16:24,841 --> 01:16:28,322
Don'’t let him corner you!
Get out there![Marc] This match is over.

1418
01:16:28,366 --> 01:16:30,237
[Mac] Not yet.

1419
01:16:30,281 --> 01:16:32,892
I don'’t know what
we'’re watching at this point,
but you know what?

1420
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:35,460
I like it. I like it a lot.

1421
01:16:35,503 --> 01:16:38,942
Maybe more than
monster wrestling.[Marc] Oh, come on!

1422
01:16:40,117 --> 01:16:41,553
[Mac] Oh, man.

1423
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:46,776
Tentacular is all over him
like a bad rash right now.

1424
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:52,433
Ah, this is too easy.

1425
01:16:52,477 --> 01:16:54,827
You like that, Stoker? Bam!

1426
01:16:58,483 --> 01:17:00,572
Suplex!

1427
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,530
[Mac]
Oh, this is a massacre.

1428
01:17:02,574 --> 01:17:05,664
The ref'’s gonna have to
step in and stop this.

1429
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:06,926
[Winnie] Rayburn, heads up!

1430
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,449
-[Marc] Oh!
-Oh, no!

1431
01:17:08,493 --> 01:17:11,191
[Marc] It'’s a wrap, y'all.
This match is over.

1432
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:13,454
[grunting]

1433
01:17:13,498 --> 01:17:14,978
[jeering]

1434
01:17:19,112 --> 01:17:21,506
[Tentacular]
You'’re an embarrassment
to your dad'’s name!

1435
01:17:22,594 --> 01:17:25,423
You come out
this next round,
I'’m gonna end you,

1436
01:17:25,466 --> 01:17:29,557
then bury what'’s left
under the ruins
of the stadium.

1437
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:33,126
All right, that'’s the bell!
Break it up, break it up!

1438
01:17:34,519 --> 01:17:35,781
[sighs]

1439
01:17:35,825 --> 01:17:37,478
Tentacular didn'’t want
that round to end.

1440
01:17:37,522 --> 01:17:39,350
I can'’t see this lasting
much longer, Mac.

1441
01:17:39,393 --> 01:17:42,440
[Mac] All he has to do
is hold on for this

1442
01:17:42,483 --> 01:17:45,008
one last round,
and he saves the stadium.

1443
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:46,749
[Marc] Not happening, Mac.

1444
01:17:46,792 --> 01:17:50,796
Tentacular'’s about
to destroy Rayburn Jr.
You can book that.

1445
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,581
Winnie, listen to me.
This ain'’t good.

1446
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:56,497
There'’s no stopping T
when he smells blood
in the water.

1447
01:17:56,541 --> 01:17:59,413
I'’m begging you,
don'’t put Ray-Ray
back out there.

1448
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:03,417
You wanna be a real coach?
Think of your monster first.

1449
01:18:03,461 --> 01:18:04,941
[gasps]

1450
01:18:08,335 --> 01:18:10,729
[Rayburn panting]

1451
01:18:10,773 --> 01:18:12,165
[Mac] It'’s over.

1452
01:18:12,209 --> 01:18:15,038
Winnie Coyle
is throwing in the towel.

1453
01:18:15,081 --> 01:18:16,866
Wait. What are you doing?

1454
01:18:16,909 --> 01:18:19,303
It'’s just a building, Ray.

1455
01:18:20,652 --> 01:18:22,436
Winnie. Ray-Ray.

1456
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,351
I want you to remember:

1457
01:18:24,395 --> 01:18:27,441
This stadium
isn'’t your dads' legacy.

1458
01:18:28,225 --> 01:18:29,269
You are.

1459
01:18:34,797 --> 01:18:38,931
Who'’s chicken now, huh?
You'’re nothing, you hear me!

1460
01:18:38,975 --> 01:18:41,542
You'’ll always be nothing!

1461
01:18:41,586 --> 01:18:44,415
[crowd chanting "Rayburn Jr."]

1462
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:48,071
[spectator]
We love you, Rayburn Jr.!

1463
01:18:49,899 --> 01:18:51,030
I wanna keep going.

1464
01:18:51,074 --> 01:18:54,251
No. Ray, it'’s not worth it.

1465
01:18:54,294 --> 01:18:55,774
Yes, it is.

1466
01:18:55,818 --> 01:18:59,038
But we'’re gonna have to try
a radical new strategy.

1467
01:18:59,082 --> 01:19:00,736
You ready for it?

1468
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:02,781
-Try to win.
-To win.

1469
01:19:02,825 --> 01:19:04,391
We gotta take
the fight to him.

1470
01:19:04,435 --> 01:19:06,872
He can'’t hit me
if I'’m hitting him, right?

1471
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:08,569
Right.It'’s just one round.

1472
01:19:08,613 --> 01:19:11,921
We can do this,
but you'’ve gotta do
something for me.

1473
01:19:11,964 --> 01:19:14,880
Anything.You gotta coach me up.

1474
01:19:14,924 --> 01:19:16,969
Are you coming back out?

1475
01:19:18,449 --> 01:19:21,278
Hey, Siggy.
We'’re not quite done.

1476
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:22,583
Oh, yeah.

1477
01:19:22,627 --> 01:19:24,455
[crowd cheering]Hmm?

1478
01:19:29,286 --> 01:19:32,419
Wait a second.
It looks like Rayburn'’s
gonna fight on.

1479
01:19:32,463 --> 01:19:35,074
I am not sure
that'’s a good idea.

1480
01:19:35,118 --> 01:19:38,121
Are you serious right now?
I cannot believe this.

1481
01:19:38,164 --> 01:19:41,559
Tell me when
it'’s over, Marc.
I can'’t watch.

1482
01:19:41,602 --> 01:19:43,169
Do it for Stoker!

1483
01:19:43,213 --> 01:19:46,085
Then combine the Renegade
with the Roundhouse Tail Whip,

1484
01:19:46,129 --> 01:19:48,000
and if he anticipates
and gets a hold of you,

1485
01:19:48,044 --> 01:19:51,177
hit him as hard as you can
right in the tentacles.

1486
01:19:51,221 --> 01:19:55,268
Just to be clear,
you are saying "tentacles,"
right?

1487
01:19:55,312 --> 01:19:57,444
Yeah. Tentacles. Okay.[relieved sigh]

1488
01:19:57,488 --> 01:20:00,447
Everything you need to win
is in here,

1489
01:20:00,491 --> 01:20:02,536
in here and in here.

1490
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,495
[chuckles]You got this.

1491
01:20:04,538 --> 01:20:07,367
You should'’ve stayed down,
chump!

1492
01:20:07,411 --> 01:20:09,630
You don'’t know
what you'’ve got
yourself into!

1493
01:20:09,674 --> 01:20:12,198
-[shouting]
-[shouting]

1494
01:20:15,985 --> 01:20:17,638
Yes!What is this?

1495
01:20:17,682 --> 01:20:20,554
Rayburn knocked
the champ down!
I can'’t believe it!

1496
01:20:20,598 --> 01:20:22,208
[chuckles] It'’s on.

1497
01:20:22,252 --> 01:20:25,124
[Marc] It'’s almost like
we finally got
a wrestling match.

1498
01:20:25,168 --> 01:20:27,866
[spectator]
Come on, Rayburn!

1499
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:31,391
[Marc] Now they'’re actually
going toe-to-toe,
like it'’s supposed to be.

1500
01:20:31,435 --> 01:20:33,654
Come on, huh?
What are we waiting for?

1501
01:20:33,698 --> 01:20:36,832
He shouldn'’t even be
in the same ring with you.
Throw this bum out.

1502
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:38,877
No, no, no!
Don'’t let him in so close!

1503
01:20:38,921 --> 01:20:40,792
[Marc] That'’s what
I'’m talking about.

1504
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,838
Time to shut
this dance club down.

1505
01:20:42,881 --> 01:20:44,970
[Mac] Oh!
That can'’t feel good!

1506
01:20:45,014 --> 01:20:46,754
Yeah!No, it didn'’t.

1507
01:20:46,798 --> 01:20:50,497
Rayburn!
Don'’t play his game.
Feel the rhythm.

1508
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:54,588
[Mac] Well, this is
way more of a match
than we were expecting.

1509
01:20:54,632 --> 01:20:56,721
[Winnie] Come on, Rayburn.
Let me see those sweet feet.

1510
01:20:56,764 --> 01:20:59,158
[Marc]
Coach Winnie'’s invented
a whole new style of wrestling,

1511
01:20:59,202 --> 01:21:00,768
and Tentacular
can'’t deal with it.

1512
01:21:00,812 --> 01:21:02,640
He looks completely lost.

1513
01:21:02,683 --> 01:21:05,556
I'’m seeing ghosts
out there, Sig!He'’s making a joke out of us.

1514
01:21:05,599 --> 01:21:07,950
He switches it up every time.T, look out!

1515
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:10,039
[Mac] Rayburn,
out of nowhere.

1516
01:21:10,082 --> 01:21:12,041
He'’s on his heels.
Keep it up!

1517
01:21:12,084 --> 01:21:14,826
[Marc] Oh, this is special.
I'’ve never seen a match
like this before.

1518
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,482
[Mac] Slams him down.
Oh, but Rayburn comes back
with the clothesline.

1519
01:21:18,525 --> 01:21:20,527
I'’m not saying I was wrong,
because I'’m never wrong,

1520
01:21:20,571 --> 01:21:24,357
but I may not have been
entirely correct
about these kids.

1521
01:21:24,401 --> 01:21:26,925
[Mac] I mean,
this is truly incredible.

1522
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:29,449
I never thought
I would see the day

1523
01:21:29,493 --> 01:21:32,496
that Marc admitted
he was wrong
about something.

1524
01:21:32,539 --> 01:21:34,454
[Marc]
First time for everything.

1525
01:21:35,978 --> 01:21:38,328
The round'’s almost over!
Just hold on!

1526
01:21:38,371 --> 01:21:40,939
Holding on is the only thing
I'’m doing!

1527
01:21:40,983 --> 01:21:44,464
[Mac] Oh, no.
Tentacular has got him.

1528
01:21:44,508 --> 01:21:46,640
Oh, the piledriver!

1529
01:21:46,684 --> 01:21:50,296
[Marc] What? He'’s back up?[Mac] He'’s spinning
like a B-boy!

1530
01:21:51,036 --> 01:21:53,256
But Tentacular
was ready for it.

1531
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,608
This is not looking good
for Rayburn.

1532
01:22:01,046 --> 01:22:02,743
[Winnie] Suckers!What?

1533
01:22:02,787 --> 01:22:06,399
-The suckers!
-Oh!

1534
01:22:06,443 --> 01:22:09,750
-[laughs] Sucker!
-[Marc] What is this?

1535
01:22:09,794 --> 01:22:13,276
[Mac chuckling]
Rayburn landed
a huge blow there.

1536
01:22:13,319 --> 01:22:15,060
Okay, Ray,
make this count!

1537
01:22:15,104 --> 01:22:17,149
I got this, Winnie.

1538
01:22:17,193 --> 01:22:19,804
[Marc] I can'’t believe it!
Tentacular actually looks like
he'’s in trouble!

1539
01:22:19,847 --> 01:22:21,588
Come on!

1540
01:22:32,904 --> 01:22:34,950
Huh?

1541

1542
01:22:37,822 --> 01:22:40,607
Why?

1543
01:22:50,269 --> 01:22:53,316
[Marc] Did you see that?
Did you see that?

1544
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:55,100
Oh! They'’re both down!

1545
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:56,493
No! Rayburn!

1546
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:59,975

-Yes!
-Oh, yeah! Feel the burn!

1561

Oh, my goodness,
Rayburn is up!
I can'’t believe it!

1562
01:24:00,209 --> 01:24:02,385
What is even happening
right now?

1563
01:24:08,869 --> 01:24:12,090
[Marc] Oh!
Rayburn psyched him out!
Are you kidding me?

1564
01:24:12,134 --> 01:24:14,527
-Looks like we'’re all tied up.

[Marc] Rayburn'’s got him with
a Tentacle Whip. The champ'’s
up against the ropes.

1567

Hey, Winnie.Uh, hey, Siggy.

1599
01:25:52,582 --> 01:25:56,716
I was wrong.
You got a heck
of a monster there, Winnie.

1600
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,328
And he'’s got
a heck of a coach.

Thanks, Siggy.

1602

That'’s an actual thing.
It'’s medical.
