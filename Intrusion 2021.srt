<i>We used to be tied to 'em. Especially me.</i>

721
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:29,416
<i>I had to find a way</i>
<i>to bring construction costs down.</i>

722
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:32,875
<i>The first step was</i>
<i>taking over as contractor,</i>

723

<i>and the second step was</i>

724
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:39,166
<i>making the IRS think</i>
<i>I pretty much built it alone.</i>

725
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,916
<i>But you had dozens of people building it.</i>

726
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,625
<i>Yeah. And that girl's father</i>
<i>was one of them.</i>

727
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:48,666
<i>And I knew he was a junkie,</i>
<i>but I didn't know he was violent</i>

728
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:52,625
<i>until one day</i>
<i>his daughter drops by the job site,</i>

729
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:54,916
<i>the same day</i>
<i>that photo must have been taken.</i>

730
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,500
<i>And she crashed his truck, like,</i>
<i>jumped the curb or something.</i>

731
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:02,833
<i>And he just starts wailing on her</i>
<i>in front of everybody.</i>

732
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:05,625
<i>I couldn't believe it. And I fired him,</i>
<i>right there on the spot.</i>

733
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,833
<i>And he promised me</i>
<i>that I was gonna pay for it,</i>

734
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:11,250
<i>which I did, literally, for…</i>

735

<i>almost a year.</i>

736
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:18,708

<i>which is what I was hoping</i>

<i>If money was the issue in the first place,</i>

739

<i>why would you pay him?</i>

<i>I could've gone to prison.</i>
