3
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,907
And the answer is

4
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,453
four reichsmark.

5
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:49,424
So, if the German family
costs 5.50 reichsmark a day to live,

6
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:54,054
but the cost to feed and care
for one person with a hereditary disease

7
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,431
is 12 reichsmark a day,

8
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:02,145
what is the difference in value lost
to the German people?

9
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,695
Karl.

10
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:15,283
Well, if it costs so much
to take care of these people,

11
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,118
what do we do?

12
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,622
You kill them.

13
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:31,674
Does anyone have
a more productive and humane solution?

14
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,141
All right. Well, why don't we focus
on the arithmetic instead?

15
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,811
Well, we put zero here.

16
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,687
And we carry the one.

17
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,568
Six.

18
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,245
Give us this day our daily bread

19
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,038
and forgive us our trespasses

20
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,707
as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

21
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,001
-Lead us not into temptation--
-Even the Nazis?

22
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,092
We all have a part to play, sweet boy.

23
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,762
Do you really believe
all that stuff from today?

24
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:22,475
That is only
the curriculum they give me, Peter.

25
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,977
We've talked about this.

26
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,979
You have to think for yourself.

27
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,815
No calculation

28
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,067
can measure the worth of a life.

29
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,070
But what I do know

30
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,614
is that I love you.

31
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,119
Will you stay until I fall asleep?

32
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,203
Of course.

33
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,625
And lead us not into temptation,

34
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,419
but deliver us from evil,

35
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,296
for thine is the kingdom,

36
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,257
the power, and the glory forever and ever.

37
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,717
Amen.

38
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,834
You, there.
Where is the Weber household?

39
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,715
Do you know?

40
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,850
Subject lives here.

41
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,771
-Weber family!
-Now!

42
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:50,730
No.

43
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,482
One moment!

44
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,486
-No. I don't want to go.
-Remember.

45
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,571
-Weber family!
-Everything is at the barn.

46
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,782
Everything is at the barn,
and they will meet you there.

47
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,617
We know you are in there!

48
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,535
Kick in the door.

49
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:07,538
Move away!

50
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,834
Go, go, go! Now!

51
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,065
Looks damaged! Check the boards.

52
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,714
-It won't hold.
-Go around!

53
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,676
Back up. Back up!

54
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,554
It's okay.

55
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,725
You, look over there.

56
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,773
There are reports
of this barn being used for resistance.

57
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,989
Stay here.
I'll lead them away from you.

58
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,166
Search back there.

59
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,670
Over here!

60
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,241
-Out for a run, are we, huh?

61
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,457
Quite a day rounding up
all the loose ends in the cow towns.

62
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,792
Anything to say, boy?

63
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,716
Heil Hitler!

64
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,928
-Enough!

65
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,349
You're just saving us the trip.

66
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,027
-<i>You kill them.</i>
