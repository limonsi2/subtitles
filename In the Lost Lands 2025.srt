1
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,960
If you've got the time
and the stomach for it,

2
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,970
I've got a story for you.

3
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,140
A tale of magic and witches,

4
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,870
of quests and of monsters.

5
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,780
Of good and of evil.

6
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,080
But make no mistake.

7
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,890
This is no fairy tale.

8
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,360
And there are no happy endings.

9
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,010
The world you know is gone,

10
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,510
consumed by the flames
of a great war long ago

11
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,780
when death
rained from the sky.

12
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,220
All that's left now
are the Lost Lands,

13
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,190
filled with twisted creatures
that dwell in the shadows.

14
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,530
What remains of humanity
takes refuge in a single city.

15
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,400
Long ago, a mysterious witch,

16
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,030
Gray Alys,
emerged from the Lost Lands.

17
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,410
This is the story
of how we met

18
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,110
and how she saved
the both of us.

19
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,960
Stop your work!

20
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,160
Stop your work!

21
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,000
Let this be an example to all.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,670
No one shall defy the church.

23
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,800
They say you can buy anything

24
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,070
you might desire from Gray Alys.

25
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,480
But it's better not to.

26
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,250
And still the people
seek your help.

27
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,650
They're ignorant, uneducated.

28
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,650
Some are poor, some rich.
All are desperate.

29
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,620
I refuse no one.

30
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,920
Do you know what the church says
about the likes of you?

31
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,790
I'm sure
you're going to tell me.

32
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,260
That you are of the devil

33
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,970
and it's our duty
to root you out.

34
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,140
In the name of the Overlord,

35
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,870
ruler of
the City Under The Mountain,

36
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,470
High Priest of the Faith,

37
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,940
I sentence you, Gray Alys,

38
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,080
to death by hanging.

39
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,880
Repent, woman.

40
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,350
What is happening to me?

41
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,110
You cannot be trusted.

42
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,280
You're a slave to the witch.

43
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,790
Hunt her down.

44
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,510
- To me.
- Yes, ma'am.

45
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,960
Show yourself, witch.

46
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,690
Do it.

47
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,990
Do it.

48
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,490
Witch!

49
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,570
I will find you.

50
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,330
You will burn in hell.

51
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,310
You will burn in hell, witch!

52
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,180
The witch that will not hang.

53
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,480
The witch
that will not hang.

54
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,510
The witch that will not hang.

55
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,920
The witch
that will not hang.

56
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,190
The witch that will not hang.

57
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,750
The witch
that will not hang.

58
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,020
The witch that will not hang.

59
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,190
The witch
that will not hang.

60
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,260
The witch that will not hang.

61
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,760
If a man wanted
to ambush another man,

62
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,830
this would be
the perfect spot.

63
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,410
Jump him while his eyes were
still adjusting to the dark.

64
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,390
Maybe even bring three,
four friends.

65
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,920
Make sure the job
got done right.

66
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,210
This thing has never worked.

67
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,360
But this never fails.

68
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,500
Gray Alys.

69
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Did you recognize my footsteps?

70
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,740
No. Your kindness.

71
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,200
This city gets
worse and worse,

72
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,070
but you have always
been so generous

73
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,110
ever since I was a child.

74
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,910
Only to you.

75
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,280
You never ask anything of me.

76
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,620
Strange.

77
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,890
You sound no different
to when I was young,

78
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,090
but you must
be old now like me.

79
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,430
Older.

80
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,800
Much older.

81
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,960
- I'm Jerais.
- Captain of the Overwatch.

82
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,660
Have you come on behalf
of the Overlord?

83
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,830
Or perhaps his queen?

84
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,810
What brings you
to visit one like me?

85
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:30,120
It is said that for a price,
you grant wishes.

86
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,350
What do you wish to buy?

87
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,160
Leave us.

88
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,630
I'm not sure if that is wise.

89
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,550
Some say you came
from the Lost Lands

90
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,120
and that you know the things
that live there.

91
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,820
Dark, unnatural things.

92
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,790
Is this what
you want from me?

93
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,690
To tell you fairy tales?

94
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,630
I want from you the power
to become a beast, Gray Alys.

95
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,530
To be more than human.
Does that shock you?

96
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,800
I have seen too much
to be shocked so easily.

97
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,940
So you can sell me
the secret of shapeshifting?

98
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,510
To a wolf?

99
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,760
Are you certain you want
what you ask for?

100
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,720
You might not be happy
with what you receive.

101
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,430
- This is not your concern.
- I am compelled to help.

102
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,670
- But I warn all who come to me.
- I'm not all.

103
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,870
- Mm.
- Will you accept my offer?

104
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,040
I refuse no one.
I'll hire a hunter.

105
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,180
We'll find you a shapeshifter
and take its power.

106
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,950
Give me until the full moon

107
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,720
and I will bring you
what you desire.

108
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,990
Where will you go?

109
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,420
To the Lost Lands.

110
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,580
What is it, Jerais?

111
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,150
Do you refuse no one?

112
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,920
No one.

113
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,300
Then accept it as my payment.
I wish to buy for myself.

114
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,900
This timepiece has been
in my family for generations.

115
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,940
It's my most valuable
possession.

116
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,900
And what do you wish for?

117
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,440
I want you to fail her.

118
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,510
The Overwatch
is sworn to loyalty,

119
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,350
yet you betray your queen.

120
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,350
I am loyal.

121
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,950
I know what's good for her
better than she knows herself.

122
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,920
This power that she seeks
will destroy her.

123
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,290
I only want to help.

124
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,360
You lie, Jerais.

125
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,490
You reek of jealousy.

126
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,360
I will not argue with you.

127
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,870
If you will not sell to me,
I will leave.

128
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,740
I refuse no one.

129
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,150
You shall have
what you want.

130
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,620
Argh!

131
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,230
Argh!

132
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,590
I'm sorry.

133
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,260
What is it you want?

134
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,960
Help me.

135
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,070
Shit.

136
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,500
Did you wet yourself again?

137
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,900
Can't you use the bell,

138
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,840
you old disgusting fool?

139
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,680
The mighty Overlord.

140
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,480
Hard to believe
you built all this.

141
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,450
And that they still fear you.

142
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,920
You're nothing more
than a filthy pig,

143
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,260
just like all men.

144
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,990
My queen?

145
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,400
All men, except for one.

146
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,940
Don't leave yet.

147
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,310
I have to.

148
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,880
Before they see me.

149
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,880
I can't stay here.

150
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,660
Hurry back. Please.

151
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,790
I will.

152
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,260
Perhaps.

153
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,270
Halt, in the name
of the Overlord.

154
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,240
What are you doing here?

155
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,410
The stronger the spirits,

156
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,880
the weaker the senses.

157
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,750
You're coming with us.

158
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,360
Stop!

159
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,230
That was half full.

160
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,550
I hear you're a hunter,
that you travel the Lost Lands.

161
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,290
I have use of such a man.

162
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,800
Came here to play cards,
not to talk.

163
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,640
All in.

164
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,000
You ready to talk now?

165
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,870
What's your name?

166
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,670
Boyce.

167
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,540
I'm looking for a guide.

168
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,470
Someone who knows
the Lost Lands.

169
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,880
- I'm expensive.
- I have money.

170
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,550
I know you do.
Most of it's mine.

171
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,550
Are you worth it?

172
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,980
Would you be here
talking to me if I wasn't?

173
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,890
The Lost Lands
are no place for city folk.

174
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,020
Why is that?

175
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,460
Because they're weak.

176
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,500
Do I look weak to you?

177
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,030
Look.

178
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,140
Outside these walls,
the laws of the city,

179
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,510
of man, even of nature,
they don't apply.

180
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,140
So whoever
you think you are here,

181
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,250
out there you'd
just be a hindrance.

182
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,250
Let's make a deal.

183
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,150
If I ever slow you down,

184
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,390
you have my permission
to leave me behind.

185
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,320
And I'll do the same to you.

186
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,630
Why do you want
to leave the city?

187
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,270
I'm looking for a man
who can turn into a beast.

188
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,940
All men are beasts.

189
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,210
But not all men are monsters.

190
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,710
You're looking
for a shapeshifter.

191
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,090
Yes. I need to kill it
in its lair to take its power.

192
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,220
I've heard of such a man.

193
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,730
What do you know of him?

194
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,130
They call him Sardor,
the Great Wolf.

195
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,100
Where does this man,
this Sardor, live?

196
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,610
In a place called Skull River.

197
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,980
Skull River.

198
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,150
That's my destination.

199
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,790
Not many have
travelled there.

200
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,460
- No one's come back.
- Guide me...

201
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,700
and this can be yours.

202
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,540
I've heard of these.
Never seen one.

203
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,440
I'll take it.

204
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,510
And the coin
you stole from me.

205
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:36,150
You'll receive your payment
once I get to Skull River.

206
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,820
Friends of yours?

207
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,430
Yeah, I don't have
many friends.

208
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,490
Me neither.

209
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,030
Gun!

210
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,240
Argh!

211
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,530
Find them.

212
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,500
That bitch killed my snake!

213
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:44,420
No one shall defy the Church.

214
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,490
It is the Church
that protects the peace

215
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,920
of this city with its laws.

216
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,760
The Church that puts fear
into the hearts of the godless.

217
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,030
The Church that keeps the evils

218
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,830
of the Lost Lands at bay.

219
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,270
We are God's instruments,

220
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:08,410
placed on this earth to
protect you from such evils.

221
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:12,610
Hunt down the sinners,
the heretics, and the witches.

222
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:17,050
Bring them to me
and you shall be rewarded.

223
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,740
Gray Alys, with a man.

224
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,040
They left the city together.

225
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,140
The people lose respect for us.

226
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,550
"The witch that will not hang."

227
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,480
Gray Alys has become
a symbol of their defiance.

228
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,250
She left you alive on
that cross to humiliate us.

229
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,220
This woman needs to die.

230
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,760
There is another matter.

231
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,770
- What is this?
- Tell him.

232
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,980
Tell him.

233
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,490
A man and a woman
went to see her.

234
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,430
I heard their names.

235
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,160
It was Jerais and the queen.

236
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,430
If the queen has been
consorting with a heretic,

237
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,940
it would be her downfall.

238
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,010
Make sure the witch
makes a full confession

239
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,710
before she hangs.

240
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,210
No mistakes.

241
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,550
No good.

242
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:37,590
Never saw a man get emotional
about a snake before.

243
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:42,200
I'm not emotional, it just--

244
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,970
It was a damn good snake,
that's all.

245
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,570
Here. The pin was bent.
It should work well now.

246
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,940
As long as you stop
beating men to death with it.

247
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,920
A clever man might choose
to kill his client on the road

248
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,450
and take his payment early.

249
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,430
But no one ever accused me
of being a clever man.

250
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,180
This is Ross's place.

251
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,690
He and his sister Mara
are old friends of mine.

252
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,290
Are we?

253
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,130
Hey, Ross.

254
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,060
It's good to see you.

255
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,800
And Mara.

256
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,340
- Welcoming as ever.
- It's been a while.

257
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,010
You look soft.

258
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,970
The City has been
treating you well.

259
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,440
- As have the women, I bet.
- Mm.

260
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,420
Ooh-ooh!

261
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,760
Uh, meet my traveling
companion, Gray Alys.

262
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,260
Welcome.

263
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,430
A friend of Boyce
is a friend of ours.

264
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,070
Gray Alys: The powers
I want from Sardor

265
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,210
will be strongest in his lair.

266
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,340
How much longer
till Skull River?

267
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,450
- A week, maybe longer.
- I need him as a wolf.

268
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,250
So we need to get there
before the full moon.

269
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,620
That won't be easy.

270
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,450
Well, if it was easy,
I wouldn't need you.

271
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:01,060
The only way would be
following the train tracks.

272
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,930
The tunnels cut
through the mountains.

273
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:08,340
It'd be dangerous, but we'd
save maybe a day or two.

274
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,780
Yeah.

275
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,280
You need another drink.

276
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,250
Always happy to see me.

277
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,590
It gets boring out here.

278
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,490
Lucky her.

279
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,900
So, who is this woman

280
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,630
you're traveling with?

281
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,330
None of your concern.

282
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,670
Do you like her?

283
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,510
Not the way I like you.

284
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,610
Ah.

285
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,120
Will it be another year
until I see you again?

286
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,450
Mm. If I'm still alive.

287
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:03,720
One year--a long time
in the Lost Lands.

288
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,230
You come, you go.

289
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,330
I don't know
anything about you.

290
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,600
What do you want to know?

291
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,540
Do you ever get lonely?

292
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,840
I do.

293
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,340
Let me tell you
about loneliness.

294
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,310
Think of a child...

295
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,480
out there in the darkness.

296
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,220
Afraid.

297
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,990
His parents beaten to death...

298
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,660
right in front of his eyes.

299
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,560
The boy travels
the wasteland,

300
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,160
hiding from the outlaws

301
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,830
and the raiders
during the day,

302
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,030
and the creatures
and the ghouls at night.

303
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,210
Till one day
that boy becomes a man,

304
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,840
and his heart
and his mind harden.

305
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,380
But still he travels on,
silently,

306
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,750
scared to get close to anyone
for fear of losing them.

307
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,060
That is loneliness.

308
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,760
And that little boy was you.

309
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,660
No. Hell, no. Of course not.

310
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,900
I've never cried
a day in my life.

311
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,040
You really don t know
anything about me.

312
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,460
Those are the last
friendly faces we'll see.

313
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,760
There's only the Lost Lands
ahead of us now.

314
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,470
What are you doing here?

315
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,510
Offering a prayer for
the Overlord's swift return.

316
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,410
Patriarch, the train
and a large contingent

317
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,280
of your enforcers
have left the city.

318
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,680
- Who authorized this?
- I did.

319
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,950
- Where are they going?
- To catch the witch Gray Alys.

320
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,490
- She is wanted for heresy.
- Your men are needed here.

321
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,090
There is growing unrest
in the streets.

322
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,190
You leave us vulnerable,
Patriarch.

323
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,300
Witchcraft is
punishable by death,

324
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,970
both for the witch
and all who consort with her.

325
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,600
I do not care about her
or what she does.

326
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,340
- And why is that?
- Do not question me.

327
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,310
- I speak for the Overlord.
- Forgive me.

328
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:16,120
But you are right,
these are dangerous times.

329
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,950
The Overlord's hand
is losing its grip.

330
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,690
I see defiance everywhere.

331
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,990
- And there are rumors.
- What rumors?

332
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:27,960
- I cannot.
- What rumors?

333
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,000
Of your infidelity.

334
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,670
Nothing but lies.

335
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,970
Yes. Vile words spoken
by the basest of tongues.

336
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:41,680
But even amongst the scum
and rabble, lies have power.

337
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,550
The queen is guilty
of consorting with a witch.

338
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,250
I see it clearly now.

339
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,490
Bring me Gray Alys
and her confession.

340
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,160
I will do the rest.

341
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,990
The Overlord is dying,

342
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,760
and with no heir,
the queen is weak.

343
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,600
Soon, there will be
a new day in the city.

344
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:09,600
And with the new dawn,
a new Overlord.

345
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,610
Aah! Please!

346
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,180
- God.
- No!

347
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,720
I told you all I know!

348
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,950
Aah! I swear!

349
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,630
No! No! No!

350
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,370
Stop! No!

351
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,600
Skull River!

352
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,270
That's where they're going.

353
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,570
Skull River!

354
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,040
That's where they're going.

355
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,470
Burn it.

356
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,880
Do you have a family
out here, Boyce?

357
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,780
A home?

358
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,350
The Lost Lands
are a lonely place.

359
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,960
The city, too.

360
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,870
They call it the Rift.

361
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,180
There's a place up ahead where
we can make a safe crossing.

362
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,100
Sirus!

363
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,170
Where you at, old man?

364
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,510
That's my friend's cable car.

365
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,310
Old Sirus will take us over
for a silver coin.

366
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,080
He keeps fresh horses
on the other side.

367
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,550
You're paying.

368
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,620
Sirus?

369
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,770
Sirus?

370
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,640
Wait here.

371
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,140
Boyce?

372
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,810
Seems Sirus had visitors.

373
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,050
So do we.

374
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,300
So you're Boyce. The Hunter.

375
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,500
We asked the old man
if you had already crossed.

376
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,440
He wasn't very helpful.

377
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,670
I always liked Sirus.

378
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,540
Who is that with you, hunter?

379
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,450
None of your tricks, witch.

380
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,220
You can't look us in the eye.

381
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,720
Hand her over
and we'll let you live.

382
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,690
There's a bounty on her head.

383
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,530
Sorry, she hired me first.

384
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:07,030
A man of principle.
Who'd have thought?

385
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,570
Give us the witch
or you both die.

386
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,380
No.

387
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,490
No one shall defy the Church.

388
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:31,990
You say you're servants of God?!
What kind of God is this?!

389
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,690
The vengeful kind.

390
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,430
You came here
looking for a monster.

391
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,130
Now you found one.

392
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,210
Boyce...

393
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,250
Behold.

394
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,050
A resurrection.

395
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,090
No!

396
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,630
Boyce, we have to go.

397
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,500
- Argh!
- Let's go!

398
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,990
Quick!

399
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,360
Argh!

400
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,610
Ah!

401
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:39,910
Cut the cable.

402
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,450
Cut the cable!

403
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:49,820
Cut it!

404
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,100
Argh!

405
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,650
We have to climb!

406
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,730
Come on!

407
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,020
Argh!

408
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,190
Why didn't she finish me?

409
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,460
She tried.

410
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,030
A witch, indeed.

411
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,430
How do we cross?

412
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,870
We have to go around.

413
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,370
Then let's move.

414
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,110
They'll be headed
for the mountains.

415
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:23,240
No. Hell is where
they're headed.

416
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,730
You all right?

417
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:44,230
Drunk.

418
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,570
Hmm!

419
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,240
Thank you.

420
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:54,910
I could've died back there.

421
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:56,580
No, you couldn't.

422
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:00,180
Not until you get me
to Skull River.

423
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,760
Okay. I'm ready.

424
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:42,790
Would you mind
stitching me up?

425
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:45,030
Of course.

426
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:51,060
I think I'd like
to pass out now.

427
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:18,690
Nice work.

428
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,260
Still hurts.

429
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:26,900
Drink this.

430
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,520
You're thinking
about your friends?

431
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,290
I'm sorry.

432
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,230
Ross was a good man.

433
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:02,540
Known him a long time.

434
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,870
Mara.

435
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,380
I'm going to kill them
for what they did.

436
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,830
Why do you travel
out here, Boyce?

437
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,000
I love the city, the people.

438
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:41,140
A strong drink, good food.

439
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,910
Yet a part of me
only feels at home here.

440
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,950
Listening to the wind.

441
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:52,590
Watching the shadows.

442
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,160
See there, Gray Alys?

443
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:03,760
See the way the lights
shimmer and shift?

444
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:07,770
You can see shapes in them
if you look long enough.

445
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,770
Yes.

446
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,810
It's beautiful.

447
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,180
I knew you'd see.

448
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,950
We're alike, you and I.

449
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,780
In our blood.

450
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,990
We're two of a kind.

451
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,990
I could see it in your eyes.

452
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,180
You are pregnant.

453
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,650
You may go now.

454
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,400
Did you hear?

455
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,570
Of course you didn't.

456
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,670
We have an heir.

457
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:21,710
Not that you had
anything to do with it.

458
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:24,880
Do you want to know
who the father

459
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,910
of the new Overlord is?

460
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,380
Boyce.

461
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,920
That's his name.

462
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,950
A simple hunter.

463
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,260
I once was
a simple girl myself.

464
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:43,400
Look at me now.

465
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,070
The train.

466
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:01,570
We'll need to take the pass
or they'll run us down.

467
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:02,810
It'll be dangerous.

468
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,740
When night falls,
demons roam these mountains.

469
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,980
We have no choice.

470
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,700
This is where
we make a stand.

471
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,270
Help me with these.

472
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:36,280
We need a fire all night.

473
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,310
Flame is the only thing
they fear.

474
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,220
We don't have long.

475
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,560
Prepare yourself.

476
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:10,670
Here they come.

477
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:49,070
Gray Alys.

478
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,170
You should not have

479
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:57,880
come back here.

480
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,410
Leave him.

481
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:34,080
Boyce!

482
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,450
Help me! Boyce!

483
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,270
The fire from your hands,

484
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:30,970
I didn't feel it.

485
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:33,170
There was no fire.

486
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:34,870
It couldn't have hurt us.

487
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,780
But to them the illusion
was real enough.

488
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:41,080
Why do you suffer then?

489
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,280
The powers I wield
come at a price.

490
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:51,720
I heard the monster
talking to you.

491
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,560
Gray Alys: He knew me.

492
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,960
A long time ago.

493
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,470
How?

494
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:05,440
There is a great treasure
inside of this place.

495
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,170
An immense power.

496
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,240
A man came to me.

497
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:15,180
He was greedy,
power hungry.

498
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,820
They all are.

499
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:22,520
But I can refuse no one,
so I helped him.

500
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:26,890
But this place is poison.

501
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:29,160
It turned him and his men
into what you saw.

502
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,330
He shouldn't have
asked me for help.

503
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:38,440
No one should ever
ask me for help.

504
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,280
I should just be left alone.

505
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:49,750
You're with me now.

506
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,100
There are tracks
to the west.

507
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,270
They are close.

508
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,360
The Overlord is dead,

509
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,200
but the queen is with child!

510
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,600
All hail the new Overlord!

511
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,480
The Overlord is dead!

512
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:03,250
All hail the new Overlord.

513
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,390
And all hail the queen.

514
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:08,460
All hail the queen.

515
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:47,130
Hail the Overlord
and hail the queen.

516
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:48,870
Thank you, Patriarch.

517
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:52,970
Now we both
have what we wanted.

518
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:58,780
You have your heir
and I have his power.

519
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:02,480
16 years until your child
will be of age.

520
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,520
We couldn't ask
for his authority

521
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,620
to be in better hands.

522
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:09,020
You are too kind.

523
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,390
I wouldn't have
anything, Patriarch,

524
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:17,030
not without your wise advice
and unfailing support.

525
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:21,130
- I hope that will never change.
- Your loyal servant.

526
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:23,340
Always.

527
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,670
A dirty whore sits upon
the throne of the city.

528
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:31,840
An affront to all
that is good and pure.

529
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,540
Our time is running out.

530
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:36,550
Her power grows stronger
by the day.

531
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:39,980
Find me the witch.
Bring me her confession.

532
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:44,490
Then the witch and the whore
will hang together.

533
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,790
But hurry.
Do you hear me? Hurry!

534
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:24,660
Tomorrow we'll
reach Skull River.

535
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:32,400
- Will he be there?
- Sardor?

536
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,770
I don't know. I hope not.

537
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,740
I need to face him alone.

538
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,410
Then you will die.

539
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:50,120
One always has to die.

540
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,830
This is madness.

541
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,070
You should leave.

542
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:03,640
You did what I paid you to do.

543
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:06,840
I never should have
accepted your offer.

544
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,170
But you did.

545
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:11,110
Leave, Boyce.

546
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:14,510
- Save yourself.
- No.

547
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:17,620
Forget this. Turn around.

548
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,480
I cannot.

549
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:22,150
Why?

550
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,060
Because I have no choice.

551
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,400
No one should ever
ask me for help.

552
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:37,040
Gray.

553
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:41,170
Come back.

554
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,710
With me.

555
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,010
Don't you understand, Boyce?

556
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:49,850
I'm cursed.

557
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:54,050
No one should ever
get close to me.

558
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:57,690
I don't care.

559
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:19,540
The Patriarch
calling to the faithful.

560
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,980
This is the moment
we've been working for.

561
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:29,020
What we've been dreaming of
since we were small,

562
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:31,390
looking up at this place.

563
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:33,860
But he can take
it all away from us.

564
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:36,930
My Overwatch
outnumber his men now.

565
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:39,260
But he is still dangerous.

566
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,670
Would you do
anything for me?

567
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:45,870
Anything.

568
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:53,450
You are my good soldier.

569
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:04,860
Gray Alys: You're quiet.

570
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,230
Skull River lies up ahead.

571
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:20,470
They're coming.

572
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:22,770
We can't outrun 'em.

573
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,010
We won't have to.

574
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:56,110
- The witch!
- Yes!

575
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:02,480
Our time is upon us.

576
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,780
Make haste!
Do you hear me?

577
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:05,880
Make haste!

578
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:10,220
You will not escape us
this time!

579
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:14,290
There will be
a new day in the city.

580
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:20,070
Repent, witch!

581
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:32,480
No!

582
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,170
Without the witch,

583
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:29,230
we must take the throne
by force.

584
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,440
Assemble my guard.

585
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,640
Do you hear me?

586
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:44,050
Brothers! Brothers, to me!

587
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:47,080
There is no use.
Your brothers are dead.

588
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:50,750
You heretic.

589
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:56,860
In the name of the Overlord,

590
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:58,630
protector of
the City Under The Mountain,

591
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:04,130
I hereby sentence you,
Patriarch, to death.

592
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,000
Gray Alys: My God.
How many has he killed?

593
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,900
Everyone
that's come against him.

594
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:13,970
Look at all this.

595
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,540
Someone lives here.

596
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,210
Sardor.

597
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:27,350
This fire hasn't
been lit in weeks.

598
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,150
Tonight will be
the full moon.

599
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:33,090
He will come then.

600
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,000
It's not too late
to turn back.

601
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:45,040
We could leave now.

602
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,510
You think he would let us?

603
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:51,710
Do you think
he's not watching us?

604
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:58,550
You could go.
I could hold him back.

605
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,790
No.

606
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,490
It is too late for that.

607
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:18,870
It will be a full moon tonight.

608
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,880
You're still thinking
about that witch.

609
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:29,050
She promised me.

610
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:35,950
You don't need
what she promised.

611
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,930
You have everything now.

612
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,900
Not everything.

613
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,190
Silver?

614
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:16,830
Silver.

615
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,230
Your weapons will be useless.

616
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:23,130
They've come against him
with silver.

617
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:26,640
Silver swords, silver knives,

618
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,310
arrows tipped with silver.

619
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:31,170
They're all dust now,

620
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:35,050
all those brave,
silvered warriors.

621
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,960
Please, don't do this.

622
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,530
We have no choice.

623
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:25,100
I think he's very
close now, Boyce.

624
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:28,330
What say you?

625
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:31,300
Not yet.
There's still time, Gray.

626
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:34,140
I think you lie, hunter!

627
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,040
There was never any Sardor.

628
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,780
Only you.

629
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:45,220
You knew? You knew what I was?

630
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,460
I cared for you.

631
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:55,530
All this time,
you tried to deceive me.

632
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:58,100
You thought
you could bring me here

633
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,260
and kill me like the rest!

634
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:06,500
You shouldn't have ever

635
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:09,570
come here--here, Gray Alys.

636
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:13,780
I tried to warn you.

637
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:13,470
Argh!

638
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:57,840
Calm.

639
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:03,040
You need to rest while
the moon is still covered.

640
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,480
You have a gift I'd kill for.

641
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:13,380
You change at will,
full moon or not.

642
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:17,520
No. It was just an illusion.

643
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:23,490
To distract you,
to leave you vulnerable.

644
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,730
We're the same, Gray.

645
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,570
- Don't you see?
- Yes.

646
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:35,170
Two of a kind.

647
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:46,890
You are still weak.

648
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:51,090
Sleep.

649
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,280
Hmm?

650
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:25,560
Untie me.

651
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:29,890
I don't understand.

652
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:33,600
Why? You saved me.

653
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,600
You would not
like my answer, Boyce.

654
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,700
It's the moon.

655
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,940
Are you afraid of what'll
happen if I change again?

656
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:45,680
I won't harm you, Gray Alys.

657
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,450
- Not now.
- I do not fear you, Boyce.

658
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:52,050
I know you too well.

659
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:54,290
I learned all your
weaknesses along the way.

660
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,650
I even added to them.

661
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:00,790
What are you talking about?

662
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:02,460
I'm so sorry.

663
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:06,700
But your fate was sealed
when you met me.

664
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,330
You were right, Boyce.

665
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:37,260
Silver weapons
were not enough.

666
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:40,160
You poisoned me?

667
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,830
I had to put silver
in your blood.

668
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,570
Why didn't
you just let me die?

669
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,950
Because dead things
have no power.

670
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:57,220
Hey, wait, wait, wait!

671
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,280
You--you have
to grant my wish.

672
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:04,390
You can refuse no one.
Those are your words.

673
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:12,400
- What do you wish for, Boyce?
- I want you.

674
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,330
I want us to be together.

675
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:18,340
I want us to hunt together,
to fight together.

676
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:21,000
To find an end
to all this loneliness?

677
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:24,440
Yes, you want it, too,
I know it.

678
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,480
I refuse no one.

679
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:30,710
But there is a price
to be paid.

680
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:32,720
Name it. Anything.

681
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,390
Very well.

682
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:00,330
The witch is back!

683
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:02,830
Man 2: It's her! It's her!

684
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:06,100
- She's back!
- She's back! The witch!

685
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,110
The witch that will not hang!

686
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:10,310
The witch
that will not hang!

687
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:12,140
The witch that will not hang!

688
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,880
Get back to work!

689
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:24,620
The witch that will not hang!

690
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:26,290
- The witch that will not hang!
- Down with the Overlord!

691
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:28,660
Down with the Church!

692
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:30,160
Down with the Overlord!

693
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:32,160
Down with the Church!

694
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:35,530
Down with the Overlord!
Down with the Church!

695
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:37,030
Down with the Overlord!

696
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,340
Down with the Church!

697
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:11,500
Gray Alys: Take this.

698
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,370
Tell the queen to cut herself,

699
01:25:13,370 --> 01:25:16,940
to drip her own blood
onto the skin and wear it.

700
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:19,010
Tonight will be the end
of the lunar cycle.

701
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:22,080
She must do it
before the end of the night.

702
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,180
Then the power will be hers.

703
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:26,350
Wolf skin?

704
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:30,690
The skin of a shapeshifter
killed in its lair.

705
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:34,060
Well, Gray Alys, you have
done what she asked of you,

706
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:35,730
but you have failed me.

707
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:37,930
I did not pay you for success.

708
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:40,400
Now, give me
my timepiece back.

709
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:43,070
No, Jerais. I've earned it.

710
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:45,130
But I did not get
what I asked for.

711
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,940
But you got
what you wanted.

712
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:51,540
- And what is that?
- The queen herself.

713
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:56,050
There was a man,
the father of her child.

714
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:58,520
You wanted her, but knew
he stood in your way.

715
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:01,420
I have changed that.

716
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:10,560
Who was this man?

717
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,600
What was his name?

718
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,670
His name was Boyce.

719
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:21,640
No!

720
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:25,110
She killed Boyce!

721
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:26,780
No, please.

722
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:31,780
It could never have been.

723
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:34,280
What are you talking about?

724
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:36,550
He was a beast.

725
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:40,090
Beast?

726
01:26:40,090 --> 01:26:41,790
What do you know of it?

727
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:46,800
He twisted you. You changed.

728
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,100
You did this.

729
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:52,540
I did what I had to do.
I protected you.

730
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:56,670
- You betrayed me.
- No, no. I--

731
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:59,780
You had him killed.
The father of my child!

732
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:02,380
Oh!

733
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:04,450
- Please.
- No!

734
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:06,820
I would do anything for you.

735
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:12,920
Then die for me.

736
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:20,160
I did this for you, Boyce.

737
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:24,670
So we could be together,
hunt together.

738
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:39,320
The witch that will not hang!

739
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,150
The witch
that will not hang!

740
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:42,920
The witch that will not hang!

741
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,920
The witch
that will not hang!

742
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,920
The witch that will not hang!

743
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,590
The witch
that will not hang!

744
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:51,030
The witch that will not hang!

745
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,150
Down with the Overlord!

746
01:30:01,490 --> 01:30:04,930
So, how'd you like my story?

747
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,500
I still don't know how it ends.

748
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:11,330
Maybe with me
skinning you alive,

749
01:30:11,330 --> 01:30:13,070
just like you did to me.

750
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:19,510
I'm not sure
I like that ending.

751
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:21,710
Too bad.

752
01:30:21,710 --> 01:30:24,620
I knew you were
the queen's lover.

753
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:27,680
- Don't leave yet.
- You know what I am.

754
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:29,550
- I can't stay here.
- You said the only woman

755
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:32,660
you could truly love
would be someone like you.

756
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:35,760
- You are not that.
- But what if I could be?

757
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:39,160
I want from you the power
to become a beast, Gray Alys.

758
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:43,500
- I refuse no one.
- I want you to fail her.

759
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,240
- I refuse no one.
- I want you.

760
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,240
I refuse no one.

761
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:51,340
Gray Alys: I knew
that the queen's desires

762
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:53,380
would lead to revolution.

763
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:57,280
And that she would
never wear your skin.

764
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,580
I knew you would live.

765
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:04,250
You're lying.

766
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,590
Just like I know
that'll misfire.

767
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:21,740
They say you can buy
anything you might desire

768
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:23,170
from Gray Alys...

769
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:28,450
...but it is better not to.

770
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:33,820
And isn't this
what we wished for?
