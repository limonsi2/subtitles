00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:34,240
AND THAT'S WHEN WE FIRST HEARD
THE WORD "CANCER."

502
00:25:34,344 --> 00:25:38,240
KELLY GOT DIAGNOSED WITH
MYELOMA.

503
00:25:38,344 --> 00:25:45,723
>> YOU'VE GOT A CANCER WITH NO
CURE.

504
00:25:45,826 --> 00:25:47,034
UM... THAT'S REALLY HARD.

505
00:25:47,136 --> 00:25:50,067
I HAD ALL KINDS OF THOUGHTS GO
THROUGH MY HEAD, YOU KNOW, HOW

506
00:25:50,172 --> 00:25:54,136
MUCH TIME DO I HAVE LEFT WITH MY
CHILD, WITH YOU?

507
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,205
>> WE REALLY ARE STRONGER
TOGETHER IN THE FIGHT AGAINST

508
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:00,136
CANCER.

509
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,309
I JUST KNEW I COULDN'T COLLAPSE.

510
00:26:02,413 --> 00:26:09,413
YOU KNOW, FOR OUR CHILD, FOR
YOU, AND SO, I DID RESEARCH.

511
00:26:09,517 --> 00:26:12,240
THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE REALIZED
THAT WE NEEDED TO GET TO A

512
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:18,172
MYELOMA SPECIALIST, THAT GREATLY
INCREASES A PATIENTS CHANCES OF

513
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:22,067
SURVIVAL, REMISSION.

514
00:26:22,172 --> 00:26:24,172
WITHOUT RESEARCH I WOULD NOT BE
IN REMISSION.

515
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:26,275
I TOTALLY BELIEVE THAT.

516
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:29,862
BECAUSE IT'S THE RESEARCH THAT
DRIVES NEW MEDICATIONS AND NEW

517
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:34,275
TREATMENTS THAT ARE MORE
EFFECTIVE AND THAT LEAD TO

518
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:46,240
YOU KNOW, LONGER AND DEEPER
REMISSIONS.

519
00:26:46,344 --> 00:26:50,240

MYELOMA, WITH PEOPLE THAT END UP

GETTING MYELOMA SO THAT WE CAN
PREVENT THE KIND OF PAIN THAT

521

KELLY FACED.

522
00:26:56,826 --> 00:26:59,931
SINCE AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND
FAMILY MEMBERS OF MYELOMA

523
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:02,309
PATIENTS ARE MORE AT RISK FOR
THE DISEASE, NOW WE CAN TEST

524
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:08,481
THEM AND LOOK TO INTERCEPT THE
CANCER BEFORE IT STARTS.

THE THING I'VE LEARNED ABOUT

526
00:27:10,413 --> 00:27:14,136
CANCER IS THAT IT'S NOT A DEATH
SENTENCE.

527
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,000

HOW CLOSE WE ARE.

HE HAD RED HAIR AS A LITTLE BOY.

855
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,965
HE WAS A SERIOUS KID AND HE
LOVED BIRDS.

856

IN HIS 28 YEARS, HE TAUGHT ME
IN HIS THIRD YEARS, OWEN THOUGHT

868
00:46:49,862 --> 00:46:52,550
I WENT TO THE DERMATOLOGIST FOR
A SCREENING.

869
00:46:52,655 --> 00:46:58,585
AND THEY FOUND A BASAL CELL
CARCINOMA.

870
00:46:58,688 --> 00:46:59,724

GO TO THE "STAND UP TO CANCER"
WEBSITE TO FIND OUT WHICH

889
00:47:54,931 --> 00:47:55,447

>> Vergara: AT 28 YEARS OLD,
DURING A ROUTINE DOCTOR'S VISIT,

891
00:48:10,103 --> 00:48:12,724
MY DOCTOR FELT A LUMP IN MY
NECK.

892
00:48:12,827 --> 00:48:14,965
THEY DID A LOT OF TESTS AND
FINALLY TOLD ME I HAD THYROID

893
00:48:15,068 --> 00:48:17,000
CANCER.

894
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,000
WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG, AND HEAR
THAT WORD "CANCER," YOUR MIND

895
00:48:19,103 --> 00:48:22,137
GOES TO SO MANY PLACES.

896
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,896
BUT I TRIED NOT TO PANIC, AND I
DECIDED TO GET EDUCATED.

897
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I READ EVERY BOOK, AND FOUND OUT
EVERYTHING I COULD ABOUT IT.

898
00:48:30,103 --> 00:48:33,516
I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE CAUGHT
IT EARLY, AND TO HAVE THE

899
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,757
SUPPORT OF MY DOCTORS AND, MOST
IMPORTANTLY, MY FAMILY.

900
00:48:36,862 --> 00:48:38,931
I LEARNED A LOT DURING THAT
TIME.

901
00:48:39,034 --> 00:48:42,827
NOT JUST ABOUT THYROID
CANCER, BUT I ALSO LEARNED THAT

902
00:48:42,931 --> 00:48:46,309

BETTER TOGETHER.

903
00:48:46,413 --> 00:48:48,827
WE HAVE ALL WITNESSED THE POWER
OF COMING TOGETHER JUST

904
00:48:48,931 --> 00:48:50,931

943
00:50:54,447 --> 00:50:57,034
WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH

AND LIKE COUNTLESS OTHERS,
CANCER HAS AFFECTED ME IN A

DEEPLY PERSONAL WAY.

961
00:51:48,965 --> 00:51:54,793
I LOST MY HUSBAND, JAY, IN 1998,
TO COLORECTAL CANCER, AND

962
00:51:54,896 --> 00:51:58,000
WHEN HE WAS JUST 42.

963
00:51:58,103 --> 00:52:00,827
SHE WAS 54.

964
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:02,896
A FEW YEARS LATER, MY OLDER
SISTER, EMILY, DIED OF

965
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,585
PANCREATIC CANCER.

966
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,481
I REALIZED I HAD TO DO
SOMETHING.

967
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:08,206
I JOINED FORCES WITH EIGHT
REMARKABLE WOMEN AND WE LAUNCHED

968
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:10,931

MISSION TO MAKE EVERY CANCER

COLLABORATION BOTH INSIDE AND
OUTSIDE THE LAB.

971
00:52:18,724 --> 00:52:22,000
WHEN BUD SELIG AND LEW WOLFF SAW
HOW "STAND UP TO CANCER" BROUGHT

972
00:52:22,103 --> 00:52:24,862
TOGETHER SCIENTISTS AND DOCTORS,
THEY DECIDED TO DO THE SAME.

973
00:52:24,965 --> 00:52:27,309
THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY
WERE PART OF "STAND UP TO

975
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:34,275
AND SO, THEY FOUNDED THE LEGACY
CIRCLE, AND INVITED LIKE-MINDED

00:54:30,965 --> 00:54:33,206
>> I'M MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY.

1022
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:34,965
NOW, I FIRST GOT INVOLVED WITH
"STAND UP TO CANCER" BEFORE

1023
00:54:35,068 --> 00:54:38,896
CANCER AFFECTED ME PERSONALLY.

1024
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,516
BUT SHORTLY AFTER I DID, DEAR
FRIEND AND MENTOR OF MINE,

1025
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:43,862
PENNY, WAS DIAGNOSED.

1026
00:54:43,965 --> 00:54:46,103
NOW, AS TOO MANY OF YOU KNOW,
NOTHING CAN REALLY PREPARE YOU

1027
00:54:46,206 --> 00:54:46,862
FOR THAT NEWS.

1028
00:54:46,965 --> 00:54:48,862
ONE: IT'S SCARY.

1029
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:50,896
TWO: IT'S OVERWHELMING.

1030
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,827
THE BARRAGE OF INFORMATION, ALL
THE NUMBERS, THE VARIABLES, IT'S

1031
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:56,585
A LOT.

1032
00:54:56,688 --> 00:54:58,655
I DID WHAT I COULD TO SUPPORT MY
FRIEND THE BEST WAY I KNEW

1033
00:54:58,757 --> 00:54:59,965
HOW.

1034
00:55:00,068 --> 00:55:02,447
I ASKED THE HARD QUESTIONS, I
GOT AS EDUCATED AS I COULD, I

1035
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,896
LEARNED ABOUT THE NEWEST
TREATMENTS.

1036
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,172
AND I TRIED TO WALK THAT TIGHT-
ROPE QUESTION THAT WE ALL HAVE

1037
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:10,931
OF QUALITY VERSUS QUANTITY OF
LIFE.

1038
00:55:11,034 --> 00:55:14,965
SADLY, MY FRIEND IS NO LONGER
WITH US, BUT I WAS AND STILL AM

1039
00:55:15,068 --> 00:55:19,068
FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR THE TIME
THAT WE DID HAVE TOGETHER.

1040
00:55:19,172 --> 00:55:22,931
I'M ALSO GRATEFUL THAT THERE'S
AN ORGANIZATION LIKE STAND UP TO

1041
00:55:23,034 --> 00:55:25,413
CANCER DOING THE WORK THAT NEEDS
TO BE DONE SO WE CAN STOP LOSING

1042
00:55:25,516 --> 00:55:30,862
SO MANY FRIENDS AND FAMILY
MEMBERS TO THIS DAMN DISEASE.

1043
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:33,516
SO, IF YOU CAN, PLEASE DONATE.

1044
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:38,862
TOGETHER, THIS KIND OF
HEARTACHE, IT CAN END.

1045
00:55:38,965 --> 00:55:42,896
JUST KEEP LIVING.
