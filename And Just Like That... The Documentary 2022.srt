176
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:04,585
- Yeah.

177
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,254
- I appreciate that,

178
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,756
but we're okay.

179
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,591
It's all in the past.

180
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,717
- I've only ever seen
every episode once.

181
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,221
We never got to do any scenes
together since one.

182
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,098
I mean, not like
sitting and talking.

183
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,432
You're chasing, running.

184
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:22,603
- Carrie. I see you. Wait!

185
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,731
- The--the luncheon, remember?
You interrupted my luncheon.

186
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,068
- Oh, my God, that's right.
- My teeth.

187
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,321
This tooth is still a different
color than this tooth.

188
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,990
- Having to find out
where you were having--

189
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,741
- 'Cause you're a stalker,
clearly.

190
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,326
[both laugh]

191
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,869
Professional stalker.

192
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:39,996
I'm gonna scream.
- Please don't.

193
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,163
I'm only gonna stay a minute.

194
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,541
David Eigenberg, we've never
had a scene together.

195
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,960
Steve?
- What you want?

196
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,336
- I think we have.
- We did.

197
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,504
We--I know we did one
on the stair.

198
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:50,298
- Yeah, and it was about what?

199
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,841
- We're sitting on the stair.
- I was sitting on the stoop.

200
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,342
- I was sad.
I was getting beat up again.

201
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,469
By that woman.
[laughs]

202
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,014
It's Miranda, right?
She doesn't want me

203
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,141
calling so much, right?
It's fine. Whatever.

204
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,352
- And it wasn't about Aidan?
Maybe it was about both.

205
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,147
Maybe it was about both.
- It might've been about Aidan.

206
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,648
- How does Aidan feel about me?
- Aw, jeez.

207
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,359
- Might've been about both.
- The age of Aidan.

208
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,362
- That--that woman and Aidan.
- That would then--

209
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,905
- Maybe they--
there were storylines

210
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,199
that called for compatriots.

211
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,744
- Yeah. Is that--
- Can you open that?

212
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,538
Sorry. No one can.
Can you believe it?

213
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:23,873
- Miranda!

214
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,043
[laughter]

215
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,210
- God bless. Thank you.

216
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,719
- She's--she empty--she--she
emptied the hard drive.

217
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,722
- Did we kiss
on the Eagle Justice?

218
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,890
- Yes.

219
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,226
[both laughing]

220
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,353
I mean...

221
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,441
We had bed scenes.

222
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,693
She's gonna forget
this entire thing happened.

223
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,321
[both laugh]

224
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,655
- Tomorrow, I'm gonna say,

225
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,325
"When should we do
our interview?"

226
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:10,086
- Are you coming with me
when I go to check...

227
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,341
Willie Garson and Mario

228
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,344
and make sure they got
their underwear on right?

229
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:22,014
Hi, can you grab anybody
that can bring me the Roger?

230
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,350
- This was Pat's idea,

231
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,435
was you should try
to get Molly.

232
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,897
And it would--you know, it's
the right and perfect handoff

233
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,777
because Molly was there
with us from the beginning.

234
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,947
- I came to New York in 1984,

235
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,241
and the first person I met

236
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:45,287
on Friday the 13th, 1984--
it was very witchy--

237
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,206
was Pat, Pat Field.

238
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:51,627
We did season one through six,
both movies.

239
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,671
In between one
of those movies,

240
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,382
we did
"The Devil Wears Prada."

241
00:11:56,465 --> 00:12:03,139
So it's been a real
fashion career alongside Pat

242
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,808
and now on the reboot
with Danny.

243
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,184
It's kind of a natural--

244
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,561
it feels
natural progression to me.

245
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:13,065
- Molly coming back
to do this show

246
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:18,195
was incredibly necessary.

247
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,198
- Do you have any berets, dear?

248
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,661
- Packing hats
for the black event.

249
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:26,996
- Background.

250
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,000
- Listen, MPK is supposedly
coming here

251
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,918
to go through and approve

252
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:38,841
or kill fittings that
we have spent two days doing.

253
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,011
- Molly, at some point,
needs a villain,

254
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,055
and it's me coming down
and going, "No."

255
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,349
She goes,
"He's going to ruin our day."

256
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,269
And I love it
because it's partly true

257
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,855
and not at all true.

258
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,025
- Okay. Thank you for coming.

259
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,360
- Oh, my God, are you kidding?
- We need you.

260
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,362
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

261
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,655
No!
- What?

262
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,574
[laughter]

263
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,284
- One of my favorite,
most favorite

264
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,411
processes in the show

265
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:13,459
is Molly and me and Danny

266
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:17,254
and them saying,
"Here's the pictures."

267
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,174
And I'm like, "Why are they
all wearing turbans?"

268
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,550
Great.
- Okay.

269
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,219
There's no surprises,
but there is a hat

270
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,178
being made for her
that you haven't seen yet.

271
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,222
- All right.
- It's funny 'cause I wanna

272
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,432
have the hat call conversation.
- Okay.

273
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,228
- It's color restraint.

274
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,897
I can't look out there and see

275
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,774
"Ascot Gavotte"
from "My Fair Lady."

276
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,235
It cannot be Danny.

277
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,320
[laughter]

278
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,823
- Blame the gays
whenever you can.

279
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,617
- You know what it's gonna be.
Hmm, and a huh, and a huh.

280
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,871
This isn't a peacock walk.
This is a--

281
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,248
- Somber.

282
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,750
- Sombery tasteful
business people event.

283
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:59,421
It's about where we tip into...
- Okay.

284
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,425
- Mocking a funeral.

285
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,095
Just don't make them fall
in love with the hats

286
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,097
or style the hair
around the hat.

287
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,973
So if I take the hats off--

288
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,225
- Then you're--
- We're in a hole.

289
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,393
- Okay.

290
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:26,365
[gasps]
Oh, my--Andy.

291
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,117
- There's more, there's more.

292
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,662
There's more.

293
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,623
- [gasps] Oh, my God.
- Okay.

294
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,543
- Let me find something great
before Danny gets here.

295
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,253
Hurry. Hurry.
What's the best thing?

296
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,297
[gasps]
What?

297
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,756
- Vivienne Westwood.
- Get out.

298
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,926
- Missing a belt,
but it's still good.

299
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,306
- I've only got
one fall episode.

300
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,433
Miranda all day long.

301
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:56,437
- This is 1981 Yohji Yamamoto.
- [gasps]

302
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,524
Didn't I tell you?
He's like a mad scientist.

303
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:07,323
- This is years of collecting.
This is '70s Saint Laurent.

304
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,658
Just travels.
You know, people's homes.

305
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,911
Maybe some eBay, but I'm not
gonna say that publicly.

306
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,416
Probably, like, 10,000.

307
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,252
- Danny.
- Yes, ma'am.

308
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,963
- There's a lot to see.
- Mm-kay.

309
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,592
- Andy, you--you know
I can't buy all this

310
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,845
until I try it on SJ, right?
Right?

311
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,138
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Okay.

312
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,890
And I won't
abuse the privilege.

313
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:33,849
- I know.

314
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:36,101
- Danny! Ezzeddine.

315
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,563
- I know, I pulled that out
to look at the color.

316
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,483
- ♪ You're taking the color
out of the show ♪

317
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,359
- Yeah.

318
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,611
- We'll put something
neon under it.

319
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,532
[inhales sharply]
Bergdorfs.

320
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,992
- Mm-hmm.

321
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,203
Isn't that beautiful?

322
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,788
- Gaultier '96 or '97.

323
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:59,625
- I think it's great.
It's cool.

324
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,876
- So cool.

325
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,544
- But look how pretty
'cause its back--

326
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,047
the back is open on it,
so it's sexy.

327
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,216
- What do you think?
- I love it.

328
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,426
- I know you love it,
but there's no way

329
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,346
she's gonna wear that color.
Do we have anybody?

330
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,556
Do we have someone
that works at Sachs

331
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,184
and comes up to her
and is like, "Hi!"

332
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,646
Let's try.
This belongs on our show.

333
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,651
- The institutional
knowledge is here.

334
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,862
It's being protected by
the very person who should be.

335
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,449
- So this is new.
- Okay.

336
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,411
- Normally, you start with new
and we talk about it.

337
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,286
- Let's do that.

338
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,957
We need tank tops,
that's your point.

339
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,209
- We just saw 'em.
We liked them. We grabbed them.

340
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,378
- Great. Were they expensive?

341
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,921
- No.
- Okay.

342
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:46,922
- There.
- Vintage Gucci.

343
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:49,466
- I mean, that is so good.

344
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,926
Not helpful.

345
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:55,264
This is unbelievable.

346
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,767
Unbelievable!

347
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,437
Oh, my God, is this
an old Brownie uniform?

348
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,855
- It's Gaultier.

349
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,274
- It's like a kitchen in 1979.

350
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,942
- Yes, it is.

351
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,402
- But it's unbelievable.

352
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,487
[lively piano music]

353
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,864
Yeah, but don't do that.

354
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,657
Let's just let that be
for a minute,

355
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,951
and you'll just do the back.

356
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:19,204
Okay. So wow.

357
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,585
It's so good.
My physical therapy outfit.

358
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:29,006
We have to wear this
for something.

359
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,674
And then we'll have to just
take care of some business

360
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,134
'cause we want it to fit

361
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,927
a little better
than it's fitting now.

362
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,888
But this is so good.

363
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,808
I mean, it's hideous. Hideous.

364
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,644
- You know, you need to step
outside your comfort zone,

365
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,980
which is what this show
is famous for

366
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:48,233
as far as a television show
and its fashion.

367
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,779
And we did it,
and we had fun styling it

368
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,405
and using it in the scene.

369
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,073
- Like, this is the kind
of thing you want on a shelf,

370
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,617
like, on her bookshelf
in her house.

371
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,993
- Yeah.

372
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:01,288
- Like, this is literally
on a shelf for no reason.

373
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,165
- I know you keep putting
that egg in front of it.

374
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:03,791
Egg that outfit.
- Egg!

375
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,376
- Every time.
- Egg!

376
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,836
- Someone's gonna get
knocked out.

377
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,007
[laughter]

378
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,593
Closer. Much closer.

379
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,928
There.

380
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,767
We don't happen to have
a gingham belt, do we?

381
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,812
Like a--like a crazy,
amazing belt?

382
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,523
Where's the belt that I think
is a piece of art?

383
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,358
That should be hanging
in Carrie's apartment.

384
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,195
- Oh, God, isn't that great?
- Kinda great.

385
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,446
- Okay.

386
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,864
- Thanks, Loughlin.

387
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,410
- It's almost too much,
but it's beautiful.

388
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,663
- What are we gonna do
with a big coat like that?

389
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,915
- Oh, we don't care.
We highlight it.

390
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,959
Try to make sure the camera
focuses on it.

391
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,545
Safe to come in?

392
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,505
[laughter]

393
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,299
- And you wear that open?
- Yes.

394
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,885
- And what do you want to do
with those ties?

395
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,929
Do them off the cuffs?

396
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,056
- Yeah, maybe.
- Or is that too...

397
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:03,141
- We'll just leave 'em.
- Leave them?

398
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,603
Let them--I'm going to look
for a handbag.

399
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,480
- Let 'em live.
- Okay.

400
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,982
That's so pretty coming--
- That's so pretty.

401
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,733
- Okay, and then
you go downtown...

402
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,820
- We need a shoe.
- There's that too.

403
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,073
- Maybe Molly mends that.

404
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,366
- Maybe?
- Pretty good.

405
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,451
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

406
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,286
- That's gorgeous.
- That is so beautiful.

407
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,580
- Yeah.
- That looks so pretty.

408
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,914
- What's the bag, do you think?
- I'm looking.

409
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,667
So beautiful.
- Is that good?

410
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,628
- Perfect. Time for a cocktail.

411
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:36,133
- We have vodka here
and tequila and...

412
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,845
- What?
- If you want a shot.

413
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,764
- And you waited until freaking
10:00 to tell me that?

414
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,351
- Someone. Whoo!
[laughs]

415
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,442
[lively percussive music]

416
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,569
- I am the still photographer.

417
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,071
You're documenting
everything they shoot.

418
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,824
You're almost shooting
your own movie in stills.

419
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,747
I did the pilot,
did the first season,

420
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,459
survived that, surprisingly.
- Action.

421
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,460
- And then did
all the seasons,

422
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,463
all the movies,
and I'm still standing

423
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,174
and no one's more surprised
than I am.

424
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,261
- Oh, nice touch, Cassette.
- We're just setting up.

425
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,055
- All the background drinks
right now.

426
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,391
I mean, we can't have people
getting drunk on camera, right?

427
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,101
Uh, the tequila
can go way too long.

428
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,313
No, we use juices
and do coloring of water

429
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,273
and, you know, other secrets.

430
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,775
- Cassette, Cassette!

431
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,946
[overlapping chatter]

432
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,740
- Whenever actors
are interacting

433
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,576
with all these other props.

434
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,995
- You take my soul. Help.

435
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,748
Help, someone.
Don't you see what she's doing?

436
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:50,832
- Sarita, can you be--
in this part could be

437
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,168
a little bit to your left.

438
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,836
I'm the cinematographer.

439
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,505
Michael and I wanted
to be true to--

440
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,340
to the original series
but also give it a new look,

441
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,718
and I think we've managed
to sort of update it,

442
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:06,014
present the women in the most
realistic yet beautiful way.

443
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:06,556
- I am the gaffer on the set.

444
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,976
The gaffer

445
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,686
is responsible
for the lighting.

446
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,770
I work with the director
of photography,

447
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:15,691
Tim Norman, and Gary Martone,
the key grip,

448
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,610
and we try to get things done.

449
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,528
- I'm the key grip.

450
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,072
We're responsible
for camera movement.

451
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,366
How the camera gets
from point A to point B.

452
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,702
We also control the lights.

453
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,079
- Believe it or not,
I did--I was the gaffer

454
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,707
on the pilot.

455
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,668
However many years ago
that was.

456
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,670
- Uh, 24.
- Yes.

457
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,715
- My station.

458
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,300
I'm just trying to get
the best sound,

459
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,052
and it's tricky

460
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,556
because the fashion has
definitely been challenging.

461
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,307
- Naughty, naughty Mike.

462
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,185
- I wanna twirl like this too.

463
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,562
[chain jangles]
- Wow.

464
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,605
Picture Charles
and the sound department.

465
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,566
I'd have to be still
in a scene, right?

466
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,901
He would--he would kill me.
He would kill me.

467
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,903
- All right.
Good morning, friends.

468
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,073
Happy Wednesday?
Jeez, it's only Wednesday.

469
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,783
- Did you see Cynthia?

470
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,994
She might not recognize you
with the mask.

471
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,710
- Luca.
- Luca.

472
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,794
- Luca!

473
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:22,090
- I assigned all
the scene numbers

474
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,092
and keep track
of which takes are good

475
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,053
and which takes are bad.

476
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:30,766
I make sure that the actors
say their lines correctly.

477
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,434
- Luca, is it
exceptionally pretty?

478
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,935
- On a shelf in my closet.

479
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,062
Got it, got, got it.

480
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,397
- Last time we were single.

481
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,107
- Who?
[laughter]

482
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,817
- One at a time, Luca.

483
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,277
- One at a time.

484
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,446
- Don't ask for the moon.

485
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,031
- I'm on the turn.
It's like we get there,

486
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:49,117
and as SJ starts to go,
even then, we're pushing.

487
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,620
- Be nice to see you
in more than just the red.

488
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,621
- Pebbles, you okay?
- Pebbles.

489
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,791
- Pebbles.
- Pebbles told me to do that.

490
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,794
- That's a good question.

491
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,129
Maybe because it's fun
to scream Pebbles.

492
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,381
I don't know.

493
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,716
[all saying "Pebbles"]

494
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,301
- Pebbles, let me know.
- We're set.

495
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:10,806
[all saying "Pebbles"]

496
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,475
- And action.

497
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,311
- They scream my name often
because I'm sort of a bridge

498
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:20,482
between the director
and the DP

499
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,692
and the actors and the camera

500
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,611
and how all of that's
working together.

501
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:28,198
- Oh, Pebbles.
Hiding behind the plants.

502
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,953
- This is
"And Just Like That..."

503
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,621
episode 106, "Diwali,"

504
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:40,418
written by Rachna Fruchbom
and directed by Cynthia Nixon.

505
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,171
[all cheering]

506
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,714
- We knew from the beginning.

507
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,050
Michael Patrick and I
had talked about that

508
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:51,012
before she even
signed on as Miranda.

509
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,514
- I knew Cynthia
was the director

510
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,558
because I'd seen plays
that she's done.

511
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,685
And I knew that
she had that in her.

512
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,395
- The cue should be for SJ.
- Feel her.

513
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:02,357
- And then you feel S--
when you feel SJ, you turn.

514
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,817
Cut.

515
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,735
When you're an actor,
you're very loved,

516
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,237
and you're very included,
but at a certain time,

517
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,866
it's 9:00,
and you've got to go to bed.

518
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,369
And you know that the grownups
are still out there

519
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,205
having a cocktail and chatting.

520
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,374
And it's sort of like
turning 18 or something,

521
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:22,544
and it's like
other people go to bed,

522
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,713
but you're allowed to stay.

523
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,632
- I'm really excited to see
how this all--how we--

524
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:31,887
- Yeah, show you
how the sausage is made.

525
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,057
I guess my question to you
is this--in your--in your head,

526
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:40,979
this particular episode,
just thinking purely of tone,

527
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:45,609
do you--do you see this episode
as different in tone?

528
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,403
- I am fully confident
you know the tone

529
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:53,116
of what we've been doing
for the last 23 years

530
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,035
and how it needs to evolve
and change

531
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,953
depending on who we are.

532
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,957
I'm very confident
or we wouldn't be sitting here.

533
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,753
- It was really hard for me
to know how prepare.

534
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,837
Like, there
were certain scenes that

535
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,715
they really wanted a shot list
from me early on

536
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,134
before we had ever rehearsed
or anything.

537
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,510
My thought was, right?

538
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,346
They come in here
and pause for a minute.

539
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,681
- Okay, what is the goal
for today?

540
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,308
- They walk down
to the middle aisle,

541
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,143
and then they kind of
gather their strength,

542
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,479
and then Carrie
gets overwhelmed.

543
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,772
- Oh, shit.

544
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,191
- And then Carrie
notices the pan.

545
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,400
- Okay, now can go.

546
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,277
- I'm a very decisive person.

547
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,322
And I think that's a good thing
in a director

548
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:35,200
because people are constantly
coming up to you

549
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,744
and asking you what you want
or what your--

550
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,622
what your preference is,
and you need to have one.

551
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,124
Or if you don't have one,

552
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,542
it's good to say
"I don't know."

553
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,294
- And the question
I have for you is,

554
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,297
do you want this dishwasher
on this so she's facing this,

555
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:53,134
or do you want the dishwasher
that she's facing that way?

556
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,719
You know what I mean?
- Right.

557
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,179
- That's something to--
- Yeah, I don't know.

558
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,433
- A few.
- [chuckles]

559
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,518
- I probably asked more than
I answered, though.

560
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,938
- And when in doubt, say yes.
- Say yes.

561
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,356
- When in doubt, just yes.

562
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,149
- We're the--we're the
anti-Nancy Reagan.

563
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,610
Just say yes.
- Yes.

564
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:14,322
- Sorry, if you could just
come this way, okay.

565
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,658
My first strength is,
of course,

566
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,661
the actors and understanding
and scene

567
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,204
and working with them.

568
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,249
- I know. They were so lovely.

569
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:28,044
- Ten. Background!
- Whoo.

570
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,587
- It's exciting.
- Action.

571
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:33,174
- What? What? Action?
Wow. Oh. Hey. Wow.

572
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,803
Um, yeah, 15 years gone.

573
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:37,679
I love that scene.

574
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,098
She and Charlotte
were having a thing.

575
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,391
Like, a real thing.

576
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,936
My character was like,
"Ooh, wait."

577
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,939
- Say something.
- Cheese?

578
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,025
- She gave me a really
good note in the middle of it

579
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,359
to the point where I was like,

580
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,861
"Oh, I forgot
that you were directing."

581
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,529
And then also that's
an excellent note

582
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:57,198
because she knows us so well,
you know what I mean?

583
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,200
And she knows acting
so brilliantly.

584
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,370
You brought it up,
and we talk about everything,

585
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,914
so you can't suddenly
just change the rules.

586
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,083
I had to really,
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!"

587
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,626
which is hard for me sometimes.

588
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,796
You know, Charlotte's like,
"Ooh-do-do, do-do-do."

589
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,381
Not like, "Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah."

590
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,134
You are married to a man.

591
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:21,014
And now you're just suddenly
having non-binary sex.

592
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:24,934
I mean, why can't people
just stay who they are?

593
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,603
- Ask me again.

594
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,980
- Why does everyone have to
suddenly change who they are?

595
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,358
- I was going like a train,
right?

596
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,694
So then in the middle of it,
Cynthia very quietly said,

597
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,571
you know, "Make your point."

598
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:39,866
You are not progressive enough
for this

599
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,035
[overlapping chatter]

600
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,162
[cheers and applause]

601
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,747
- The best part
is when she's in a scene,

602
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,290
and then she says, "Cut."

603
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,167
That's my favorite.
I love that.

604
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,919
- She's really great,
just as we suspected.

605
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,463
- Yes.

606
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,091
Also, she told me to be
like a fawn in the episode,

607
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,426
which possible is
my favorite direction ever.

608
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,095
- Aw.
- [laughs]

609
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,930
- And I was like, "Uh.

610
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,433
That's gonna take
a lot of work."

611
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,435
And she's like,
"I added eyelashes."

612
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,937
[both laugh]

613
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:17,904
- We're on the subway
for the first time

614
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,198
on "Sex and the City" history.

615
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,618
Technically,
we're at the Bowery Station.

616
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,787
Shh. Don't tell anyone.

617
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,539
But story-wise,

618
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:31,459
we're at 116th street
up in Columbia and Broadway.

619
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,380
We've been wanting to get
our gals on the subway,

620
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,715
I would say, well,
now it's more than 20 years

621
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,634
we've been trying,
and we made it.

622
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,469
[soft jazz music]

623
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,347
- Just getting to know
our new cast members

624
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,976
has just been like one gift
after another gift

625
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,227
after another gift
after another gift.

626
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:54,482
And we all have something new
brought to us by them.

627
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,694
[overlapping chatter]

628
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,869
- Just wearing a pink pussy hat
wasn't gonna cut it anymore!

629
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:10,999
- I'm super proud of that.
And that's Nya!

630
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,251
[laughs]

631
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,713
What I think I didn't expect
the camaraderie

632
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,466
and the real sisterhood

633
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:23,845
and, you know, that experience
and the laughter and the funny.

634
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,514
Like, it's as funny
behind the scenes

635
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,017
as it is in front
of the camera.

636
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,685
- You did make
a 7:30 reservation.

637
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:31,853
- Thank you.

638
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,688
- At our San Francisco
location.

639
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,023
- Should I call them
and tell them

640
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:35,899
we're gonna be
a little bit late?

641
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:39,694
- Nya was there
to be many things.

642
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:42,947
She's a leader,

643
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,949
she's the teacher,

644
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,952
and then she's the student
with Miranda.

645
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,704
- Miranda Hobbs,
are you about to tell me

646
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:50,413
that motherhood isn't worth it?

647
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:54,334
- Um...it depends on the day.

648
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:59,380
- Miranda, who's always had
a ambivalence to motherhood.

649
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,674
It almost--Brady was
almost an abortion.

650
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,551
- Charlotte, I didn't do it.

651
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,721
I'm keeping the baby.

652
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:08,223
- That's amazing.
- Dan, shut up!

653
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,892
- Start rolling. Oh, my God.
More later!

654
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,479
- So originally, when Michael
was sort of trying to think

655
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,731
about what would happen
in our season,

656
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:21,903
he talked about Nya, you know,
Miranda's professor,

657
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,821
being the
romantic relationship.

658
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,282
You--you're the professor?
- Yeah.

659
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,243
- You're Nya Wallace?
- [laughs] Yes.

660
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,911
Why do you seem so surprised?

661
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,329
- Nya was a straight character,

662
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,497
and Miranda's
a straight character,

663
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,124
and I was like, that doesn't
sound very sexy at all.

664
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,501
Do you know what I mean?

665
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,835
To women who've gotten
to this age

666
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,754
and are now just sort of
fumbling around,

667
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:41,339
that doesn't seem great.

668
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:45,176
And--and I was like,
why couldn't it be, you know,

669
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,638
why couldn't it be
this butch person

670
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,640
that you're talking about
having for Carrie?

671
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:54,769
- I am Che Diaz,
your host and queer

672
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:59,148
non-binary Mexican-Irish diva
representing everyone else

673
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,651
outside these two
boring genders.

674
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,279
"Sex and the City"
was really inspiring to me

675
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:08,575
and empowering around exploring
my own sexuality

676
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:12,787
and my own just empowerment
as a person

677
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,747
who is not a man in the world.

678
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,040
Look at me, listen to me.

679
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,500
Are you listening to me?
- I am.

680
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,211
- I can't give you
anything traditional.

681
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,630
- We built that character
for them

682
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,842
based on their
gender identifications.

683
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,302
- You need to dialogue
with us more.

684
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,303
That's the last time
to try them.

685
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,805
- You need to dialogue
with us more, ding.

686
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:32,140
Okay, so I--and I said--

687
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,766
I said, I really
want this working.

688
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,476
- It's like it's missing.
- And I say this with love.

689
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,478
- Good. Okay, thank you.
That's great.

690
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:41,441
I say this with love.
You better step your pussy up.

691
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,859
- Oh, okay.

692
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:43,776
I've got a bunch
of stuff with Sara,

693
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,323
which has been great
and really fun.

694
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,659
The podcast stuff
is so much fun.

695
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:56,831
And included in that is
Bobby Lee, who is heaven sent.

696
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:59,125
- You still with us?

697
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,001
- I'm in the scene.

698
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,962
I'm doing a fucking scene
on the show.

699
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:03,838
[laughter]
God.

700
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:06,841
- This kind of dollop
of something.

701
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:10,303
Oh, I've never tasted that
bef--you know, like.

702
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,681
- You gotta stroke it, Lee.

703
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,310
- This is the longest day.
[laughing]

704
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:22,148
- Seema was brought into
the show to be another version

705
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,442
of somebody
we haven't seen in the show,

706
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:27,487
a South Asian woman
from Queens,

707
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,197
first-generation daughter
of immigrants.

708
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,156
- It's such a pretty name.

709
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,034
- It means "boundary" in Hindi.
- Oh.

710
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,161
- Which is hilarious
because I have none.

711
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,330
- She comes in
as a real estate mogul.

712
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,873
She owns her own business.

713
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:40,124
She even has a license plate
that says SEEMA NYC.

714
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:45,380
I mean, you don't need more
than that to say, "Baller."

715
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,964
And then we have Sarita,

716
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:52,387
who is the most quiet baller

717
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,097
in the entire world.

718
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,392
- 4-16, take one.
A-mark.

719
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,893
And action.

720
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:01,896
- It's gorgeous.
It's all gotta go.

721
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,400
- Try--I think
a harder version

722
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,277
and then punctuate it.
- Okay.

723
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,406
It's gorgeous.
It's all gotta go.

724
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:17,245
- She's a very interesting,
quiet kind of stealth

725
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,997
way about her
that's really cool to see.

726
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,459
- You staged me
like an apartment?

727
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,711
When?

728
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,421
- Valentine's Day
on my lunch break.

729
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,383
Nobody buys real estate
in the winter, so I listed you.

730
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,761
I know those scenes
at the table.

731
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,640
And then when they told me
I was in a scene at the table,

732
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,184
by then I'd shot a lot,
so I was at ease

733
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,270
with doing the show.

734
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,646
But that day was different.

735
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,773
- Nice and quiet, please!
Let's hold for...

736
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,776
- There was something
about the table and that scene

737
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,904
that was so iconic
that to enter into it,

738
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:55,324
it was not
a normal human feeling.

739
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,619
- What?
- Yes.

740
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:04,876
- Yes.
- Oh, Sarita!

741
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,670
- And she lives to tell.
- Welcome to the table.

742
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,672
- I was very nervous.

743
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,924
They're super nice.
I survived them.

744
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,427
- And you know, we asked Sarita
what she was drinking,

745
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,970
or Seema what she was drinking,

746
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:18,306
and she's drinking
her own version of a Cosmo.

747
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,099
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't realize.

748
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,976
- It's a new day.
- With mint.

749
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:25,188
- With mint.
- Whoo.

750
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:32,361
- Five, six, seven, eight.

751
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:32,987
- Back to work. Come on.

752
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,491
- Nine, ten.
- Action.

753
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,036
- [sighs]

755
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,012
- Cut.
[bell rings]

756
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,523
- The great thing
about Sarah Jessica is,

757
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,858
she just keeps going.

758
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,360
- Where's his wallet stuff?

759
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,070
Where's that--all the stuff
in the wallet?

760
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,696
- That's all in the wallet.
- Wouldn't it able to be--

761
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,198
- It can all be
wherever you want it.

762
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,033
- Yeah, like the picture
and the Pinkberry, and...

763
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,868
- Yeah, it's all here.

764
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,162
- And a Pinkberry punch card
is on the walk to here.

765
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,622
- Yeah.

766
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,710
- Okay, so just roll the--
the punch card's over there.

767
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,962
- And here's my wallet.

768
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,213
That's his wallet.
- Okay, perfect.

769
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,882
Until I really figure it out,

770
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:39,762
it doesn't feel like
it can be real on screen.

771
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,515
Like, I almost
have to be super technical

772
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,058
over and over again.

773
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:45,893
So then I've gotta find her
on Instagram, right?

774
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,521
- Yeah, that's on your phone.
- Lord have mercy.

775
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,730
If you're not living
in the apartment

776
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,109
and you're not handling
the food or looking at a phone

777
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:57,071
or dealing with a plastic bag
or waking your computer up.

778
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:59,198
Oh, I-I-I-I found
her Instagram.

779
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,284
I'm gonna send her a--
I'm gonna DM her.

780
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,119
Just, you know, in case
she didn't get the email.

781
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,913
- I say let's give her
another day.

782
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,915
All right, I'm gonna change.
It's gonna be a long one.

783
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,667
- All right.
- And action.

784
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:14,005
- Did you know that Big had
a dog named Gogi?

785
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:18,217
I have been spiraling all--
I've been spiraling all day

786
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,427
about him and Natasha.

787
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,761
Damn it! Son of a bitch.

788
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:25,558
I know. I know. You're scared.

[voice muffled]
It's a cashmere something.

791
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,563
She blocked me on Instagram.

792
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,647
- Okay, the woman
is a total bitch.

793
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,066
- Oh, what a mess.

794
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,280
- I think maybe 'cause
I wasn't formally trained,

795
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:43,451
I can't count on a class
or a masterclass or a teacher,

796
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,370
so you look to others.

797
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,288
I remember being in a theater

798
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:52,126
with both Mary McDonnell
and Claire Bloom,

799
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,920
and they were, like...

800
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,382
Involved in everything.

801
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,675
Hi, what do you do?

802
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,760
- I'm an assistant
set director.

803
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,930
- Oh, nice to meet you.
Why are you guys hiding?

804
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:08,476
I can get closer to being
whole and alive and real

805
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,978
if I am head to toe
a living person.

806

You know,

when someone yells action,
I just feel more whole.

810
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:22,990
I wanna definitely do this
with Molly, you know,

811
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,993
so I don't mess up
stuff of Molly's.

812
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,038
I just--it--we can't ha--

about what we're saying

And I know that's
a huge undertaking.

- Yeah.

823

- Yeah. I'll let you do that.

839
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,271
Sarah Jessica is so tactile.

840
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:39,692
She needs to feel like
she lives in her house.

841
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:40,776
That's why all of a sudden,
we're throwing stuff

842
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,446
all over the set--
because it makes her feel

843
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,739
not like a set.

844
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,615
It makes her feel
like she lives there,

845
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:50,703
and that's necessary
because Carrie is true to her

846

and true to the audience,
which is why we're back.

847

shoe bags in her now.

She needs. I do that.
Old shoe bag in this row.
