Whatcha doing?

376
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,958
Having a bad day.

377
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,041
Well, just keep hanging in there.

378
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,000
Very funny.

379
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,375

385

Why is she purple?

386
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,416
It's hair dye. I love purple. [laughs]

00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,625
So,

389
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,625
what are you doing out here?

390
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,958
It's noon.

391
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,458
We're right on schedule.

392
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,333
But I didn't--

393
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,458
Get ready for your mind
to be blown. [grunts]

394
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,500

the glass is cracked,

I didn't walk.

482
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,166
Flamenco. It was our thing.

483

I've never seen you dance flamenco.

But I haven't in a while.

486

-Keegan and Benny, you're the lucky ones.
-No, I really don't want to.

748

This is the exact opposite of lucky!

749
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,208
Benny, you're goalie.

750
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:21,083
Keegan, you're corner forward.

-Taught me everything.
-Well, then make him proud.

754
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:33,541

Great. We lose our two best players
and get stuck with these guys.

00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:09,750
I wouldn't tell anyone you saw me

Uh, can somebody help me up?
These new antlers are really heavy.

1468
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:39,583
What a jerk.

1469
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:42,208
-Oh, what a disappointment.
-Let's get outta here.

1470
01:20:42,291 --> 01:20:43,958
I'm… I'm sorry. I'll do better.

1471
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:47,000
It's my first day at this,
and it kind of went to my head.

1472
01:20:47,083 --> 01:20:47,916
Literally.

1473
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,083
Hmm, classic Benny disaster-piece theater.

1474
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:52,333
Well, bye.

1475
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,791
Megaloceros Giganteuses?

1476
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:58,250
Friends-euses?

1477
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:00,666
Where my friends-euses at, huh?

1478
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:02,541
Wanna help?

1479
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:05,541
Wanna help your old pal Benny up?
Anybody wanna help Benny?

1480
01:21:05,625 --> 01:21:07,833
Benny? Wanna help Benny,
your old buddy Benny?

1481
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,583
Anybody, buddy, Benny, help Benny?

1482
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:11,375
Ah.

1483
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:12,291
Poo.

1484
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:15,375
What if I have to poo? What do I do?

1485
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:17,208
[Keegan] Hey, everybody.

1486
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:22,833
This next one is for Megaloceros
and mega grandparents everywhere!
